"Interesting but maybe not for me."
""
""
""
"4/4/15 (Bottle) - Golden pour with generous white head, mild carbonation. Yeast and bread aromas, with a hint of citrus. Excellent taste of malts, yeast, somewhat sweet and balanced. Excellent feel, smooth, nice kick to it, and with the large bottle you are set for the afternoon.Overall excellent beer!"
""
"I drink it an awful lot, though admittedly not my preferred style. Fortunately, it seems to get better the more you drink it. Well done Canada!"

"1 of my favorite beers of all time"
""
""
"Man, just not my thing.  I heard great things about the beer, but I just don't like the taste.  I've got friends that love it and drink it all the time.  Not me."
"I will confess that I like -- but do not love -- Tripels, but enjoyed this offering from Canada.  Very yeasty, and quite smooth for a high-octane brew."
""
""
""
"A fantastic Belgian pale. The active effervescence adds to a great feel. At 9% I'm wondering if there's booze in there.  Hidden beautifully. Yeasty banana bread and clove."
""
""
"On point in every way, full disclosure I haven't been to Belgium but this is as solid an expression of the style I've experienced. Those Canucks have nailed it."

"First sip with Guillermo and Bob at deli in DTLA during Artwalk summer 2011. Buy at Trader Joes $7.50 for bomber or Total Wine $9.99 four small bottles."
"o: This tastes like a hot toddy cooked down and chilled. A beautiful beer for the winter or Christmas holiday but not so obvious it can't be had all year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Thanks to you guys/gals here on Beer Advocate, I decided to go for a beer that I passed by without taking a second look every time I was at the Liquor store. I'm thankful that I finally picked it up! Top notch, word class beer that is easily the best example of the style that I've had."
""
"I love this beer. The bar that I frequent for six packs usually carries La Fin Du Monde and 9/10 times I pick up a six pack, I get one of these. If you've never had one, do yourself a favor and try one. It's got a smooth taste with hints of citrus and a tiny bit of clove. It's light and drinkable but I find it to be heavy on the stomach."
""
""
""
""
"This is by far my favorite beer in the whole wide world.  The sweet hints of citrus and clove make this beer so tastyall year around."
""
"I ended up just smelling this beer over and over once it hit its stride and opened up.  Amazing.  Just swirled it around and stuck my nose in deep into my snifter and teased my lips several times without taking a sip.  Yeah this beer brought out the giddy junior high foreplay in me I thought was long gone.  True Quebecois flirtatious romance."
""
""
""
"Bottle of la fin du monde drank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Deliciously strong and flavorful.  A damn good tripel, that has smoothed down a bit with age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be my favorite North American brew in a Belgian style. I love Belgian beer and most attempts fall flat to me. This was outstanding."
"Good enough to make me want to be Canadian!"
""
"Poured into snifter, with a thick head. The color is a gold with a slight red to it. Smells like wheat and apple on the nose.  Taste is smooth with some bitterness towards the end. This is an amazing beer."
""
""
""
"One sip of this and I'm back in some medieval cloister with torches on the stone walls and evensong through the window. A head you have to see to believe."
"Bottle poured into tulip. Two plus fingers of off-white head that slowly collapses to a ring and a few small foamy islands. Pale apricot gold color that is hazy. Bubbles rise single file - cool to watch. Aroma is apple/pear cider, doughy yeast, clove, alcohol. Clove flavor up front then malty sweetness followed by drying alcohol. More hints of cider. A touch of hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied, creamy texture, lively carbonation, drying finish."
""
""
""
""
"Would recommend if you've got the deep pockets for this one."
"O (3.75) - This beer was alright.  Not especially flavorful, or anything of note.  I feel if it was produced by a less prestigious brewery, people would rank it lower.  I also am not going to get overly excited for ""High ABV.""  High ABV is fine, but it doesn't make a mediocre beer good."
""
""
""
"Too heavy on banana & clove."
"Wow!  This is a world class, tasty brew. After a large crab dinner, wine just couldn't refresh. Fortunately I found this tripel at total wine this afternoon. Beautiful, white foamy head, spices that tease the palate and a smooth, creamy mouth-feel.  All that and I didn't notice the 9% ABV. A Belgian triple that's brewed in Quebec. I will definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great taste, good color and smell."
""
""
"This brewery crafts some of the best beers on the planet...however, I can't help thinking, ever time I purchase, drink some, or discuss it, of my third Grade teacher Mrs. Dragon ( no kidding ) who left her eyebrow(s ?) to grow as wild and unfettered as the most enormous English hedgerows. Unibroue change your name and not to Bacc Herre Brauerei."
""
"I was totally spellbound with this Beer. Tasted like a Lager but had 9% ABV which was good ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer many, many times so this review is from memory (shared a 750 last night). I always serve chilled to well chilled, pours golden/ light orange with a billowy head that disappears within a few minutes. smell is fruity, spicy, slightly herbal. Taste has a wide range of flavors that seem to show out at different times, banana/ clove, sweet almost caramel malt flavors, some how dry and effervescent yet with a smooth creamy finish all at once. great for a toast, nice to sip (or guzzle) with food, just watch out for the 9% abv 'cause you cant tell it's there."
""
""
"O: As close to perfection as it gets. Bar none one of the most well-structured and well-balanced brews out there. Its potency commands respect, and when sipped slowly and contemplated it offers a most memorable and rewarding experience.  A must-drink for any enthusiast of Belgian-style beers."
""
"Hazy orange. Small white head. Smell is fantastic; belgian yeast esters throwing out sweet banana aromas, maybe some funky apple and a hint of orange.  This tastes sweet, banana like and just a hint of booze.  Highly carbonated, and a warming sensation from the alcohol.  This is an outstanding tripel."
"Overall this is a great beer that definitely hides its 9% alcohol.  It really is quite refreshing for a heavier beer, almost like a lager or pilsner, but it has way more flavor than most beers in those categories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite brews. First time I had it, there was a match lit inside my cheeks and the parade had begun."
""
""
"Was a great beer overall. Was very smooth an had a nice fruity taste. The alcohol was well hidden. Can't wait to have this one again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this is great, it is different from what I would expect in a triple, being hazy and more on the sweet side, but that by no means takes away from how great this is.  It has a great complex fruity Belgian yeast character and is very refreshing. I had this first probably 9 or so years ago when I first started getting into craft, and didn't like it then.... Now this has got to be one if not my favorite triples."
""
""
"Very smooth. Hard to believe that it is 9% ABV. Nice fruity (pear) flavour. I would buy again."
"Had this in a bottle and really enjoyed it.  I've been getting more into Belgians lately, and this Tripel was a strong representative of the style.  Great balance and very well crafted.  It's dangerous because it's 9% ABV but you don't feel the alcohol, so be careful!  But do make sure you try this if you find it anywhere, because it's well worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I liked the MadElf (my first ever full Belgian style beer) better, but I can imagine why this is rated higher.  It is well-made and well-balanced.  I have opened up a whole new beer chapter."

"It's a Belgian golden.  It has Belgiany banana and clove stuff going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"La Fin du Monde is ""Quebec's pure gold", probably a reference to its secret ingredient = Maple sirup = Quebec's ""gold"". This is just a theory and an opinion from someone who eat Maple sirup every weeks of the year. More bitter than the smell, still this is one of my favorite beers ever. Extremely well crafted and balanced, this is the only beer you'll ever need living through the end of the world!"
""
""
""
""
"I've never quite understood the fascination with this one. Cloyingly fruity, watery, and metallic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy golden with a towering head considering how gingerly I poured.  Bubbly visible carbonation helps to maintain the head for quite a while.  Some pretty lace.  Great aroma.  Strength as well as quality.  More of a grainy scent with very little sweetness.  Taste follows the nose.  Very well balanced in all directions.  No one characteristic leaps out at me.  Wonderful feel.  Medium-bodied with a dry, tingly finish.  No discernible alcohol at all.  If you're scared off by sweet bubblegum Tripels this one is for you."
"I'm noticing that metallic taste as well, but it's not too off putting when the  rest of the beer is quite good. A lot of carbonation in it, pours fantastically with a small amount of head."
""
"Taste is very weak--like water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one that everyone loves and with good reason. The taste is great, pours lovely."
""
""
"Drank as part of a bottle share.  Not what I was expecting in a Tripple.  Overly fruity and off-putting metallic aftertaste.  Not horrible but I am glad I got to fast prior to laying down 10 bucks for a bomber of this. Many better choices available  imho"
""
""
""
"I hate being the odd man out and having the unpopular opinion, but consistently throughout my entire craft beer drinking lifetime, this brew has always tasted metallic to me."
""
""
"O: Excellent, very drinkable tripel"
""
""
""
""
""
"Really is a thing of beauty. After the first sip i knew this deserved the praise it receives. Unbelievable taste for such a well balanced, good tasting experience. Very fruity and delicious. Hard to believe its nine percent and really hits you all the sudden haha. I understand they sold out to bigger company but high quality is still present."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heard noting but good things about this beer and have been wanting to try it for a while. Poured into a tulip. Nice 3 finger head that dissipated rather quickly with minimal lacing. Amazing nose, lots of clove, banana, cinnamon...and hints of apricot, pine, and orange. Easy going feel, the high alc is non apparent..complex taste that lingers and leaves you wanting another sip .. a must try for any beer lover"
""
""
"one of my favorite trippels and probably my favorite beer by these guys"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly one of my all time favorite beers. Let it warm up sufficiently and the flavor really pops. Definitely my go-to Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But there are many Abbey Biers that are superior."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally had one. Great Belgian flavors. Enjoyed the aroma and taste was excellent from start to finish. KO'd me as I had the big 25.6 oz bottle. Will make sure to occaisionally have again."
""
"Medium body, medium-light carbonation, a really delicious spiced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"These are bottle conditioned with high abv so could be cellar-ed. Weather they improve with age is unknown to me although the Unibroue website claims its best after 3 years in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Straw golden colored with a murky complexity that is impenetrable to light.  Aroma is Belgian yeast,orange peel,and coriander.  The flavor is a blend of orange peel,coriander,and Belgian ale yeast.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours beautifully - cloudy gold in a glass with a substantial, frothy white head that lingers throughout. Yeasty nose - definitely leaning toward the blood orange spectrum for smell. This beer tastes delightful - akin to a freshly baked loaf of bread, but with a peppery and dry finish. The heavy alcohol content is well hidden and this beer sneaks up on you. This would be a delightful beer to pair with a Christmas ham, which is exactly what I plan to do."

"The end of the world...a solid non Trappist tripel.  It as good as it is ubiquitous, meaning it is the everyday tripel (if there can be such a thing).  Heavy taste of banana and clove, mouth-feel is nearly perfect.  Drank in the past, drinking now, and will drink in the future; not a perfect beer but a damn good one."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"This is a nice example of a triple considering it is actually Canadian. I'm curious where the yeast came from. Overall it might have been a tad too yeasty which took away from some of the drinkability."
"12 oz poured into Sam Adams glass.  BB date 12/2016, poured a dense gold color with fluffy white head. Minimal head retention with virtually no lacing.  Very effervescent maintaining a 1/4 inch head throughout.  Kind of a sour bready aroma.  Taste was a bit more sour than I expected and lingered on the tongue.  Nice round mouthfeel and well-hidden alcohol.  It is a well-crafted beer but I don't understand this as the highest rated Tripel."

"A huge foamy head appears above a straw colored liquid. Lace stays throughout the entire drink. A solid smell is followed by a tremendous taste, with a definite alcohol taste coming through at the very end. A tremendous beer!"

"I am no expert.  This ale is very carbonated, small bubbles, light amber like a highly carbonated wheat beer.  Lots of deep, light flavors, fruit and spice. These flavors are what I characterize as barleywine, very alcoholic.  Tasty and entertaining.  Sweet."
" The beer has multiple layers and is a real experience. One of the best available from Canada."

"Overall: Good beer, pairs nicely with spicy & Italian food"

"O: [3.75] Out of the gate this was a typical yeasty mess.  But as it warmed the body and flavor came out.  It was really enjoyable.  I'd like to age a few of these and see how they change.  This is a really good brew.  The alcohol isn't totally hidden - but that is okay.  The taste migrates away from the wheat/yeast bomb and has complex tones of banana and bubble gum."
"Appearance 3.75, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4.25"

"So overall would I recommend it ? You know it and you know my answer. You have to give it a try at least once in your life. This is a beer on the top really hard to fins an other like this one. That rust and that burn due to that 9% ABV is to present for me but still what a beer man !"

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 3/28/2017. Pours lightly hazy deep golden color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange peel, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange zest, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon. pear, apple, apricot, pineapple, orange zest, banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, bread, candi sugar, herbal, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Insane complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; with a pretty much perfect yeast/spice/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly/dry mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class tripel style. All around insane complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely amazing offering."

"Pours a hazy deep straw color. Smells sweet, earthy, yeasty, spicy, and aromatic. The flavors in this beer are so well balanced and the alcohol is so well hidden. Strong wheat flavors and sweet belgian candy sugars are cut by an overall fruity dryness in the beer. The  carbonation is strong.  I cannot express how easy and enjoyable this beer is to drink."

"I was introduced to Unibroue on my first visit to Montreal in 2012.  La Fin Du Monde is a fine example of what they have to offer.  This is a heavier, strong beer yet very smooth to drink.  It has a complex flavour which is difficult for me to describe."

"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a medium white lasting fluffy head. mild lacing. Aroma is of sweet spicy fruit, Belgian yeast, some notes of citrus and banana, some biscuit malt as well. Taste is same as aroma with a good spiced hops bitterness. A medium body, with lively carbonation, almost champagne like. The finish is a combination of sweet spiced fruit, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt with spicy hops bitterness on the end for balance. This brew has some nice champagne like effervescence. Overall a very good, delightful, and tasty brew. very nice."

"La Fin Du Monde was a great ale for the price or even not considering the price it was great.  Cheaper and better tasting than most from Belgium and America.  Unique malt, yeast, and candi taste that was one of the most drinkable Tripels I have had. Maybe similar to St. Bernardus but it's been a while sinc I have had that.  But at $8.50 a bottle a lot cheaper than many others with comparable excellent taste level."

"Had this beer a few times and I don't see why it's such a great beer. I've had my fair share of great beers, but La Fin Du Monde for me is an overrated beer, one that overshadows many other great Canadian beers such as Creemore Springs, which I think is a far superior tasting beer than this. Personally, I think this beer doesn't rival Unibrue's Blanche De Chambly. The taste is very fruity and it has a high alcohol content. This is one of my least favorite beers, and I don't recommend it."
""
"This beer goes down smooth and tastes fantastic. The alcohol is hidden well, but watch out the 9% will sneak up on you after you have had a couple. Florida has recently started stocking this beer at the regular sales locations and I recommend it to any beer lover. Good for most all pallets."

"This beer has a fantastic pour right out of the bottle! Rich head followed by a great golden ale has just the right right amount of spices to make you think about it. At first my thought were what is this but as I took a sip I began to notice the intricate spices hidden within. At the time of this writing I would say this beer is better than my previous favorite of Chimay (Blue)."

"Yellow-orange pour, slightly hazy, with a thin dissipating white head. Fruity aroma, with mandarin orange, peach, and Belgian yeast. Flavour is sweet and almost syrupy, with a slightly bitter edge, reminiscent of orange marmalade or peach syrup. Bready notes and lots of Belgian yeast in the flavour too, classic Unibroue taste. A bit of caramel and apple as it warms. Dry, sweet, bready finish. A great Tripel."

""
""

"Overall: I enjoyed this one much more out of the corked bomber. The beer seemed a bit fuller and a tad smoother, likely due to the differences in bottle conditioning. A marvelous beer and one I'll keep coming back to in the future. Would highly recommend."

"One of my favorite tripels. I'm drinking this one in lieu of champagne to celebrate a special occasion right now."
"O: I'm used to pretty one or two dimensional blonde ales, so it was a real pleasure to have one of such rewarding complexity. My personal favorite from Unibroue is La Terrible, but this one is definitely up there. It's perfect for a night where you crave a well crafted beer, but don't want to down something thick, filling, or hop-heavy."

"O - Very good tripel. But I still prefer Tripel Karmeliet (the top tripel for me) and De Dulle Teve (it is more dry so more easy drinking)"
""
"I am not sure what all the hype about this beer is. I assume I much have gotten a bad bottle. Pours hazy golden color with finger width foamy head, which doesn't seem to last long. Slight lacing on side of glass. Of course there are pieces of cork in my beer because it broke apart, trying to get it out. Not good. Smell of bananas and cloves with slight hint of citrus. The taste is very similar to the smell, but there is little to no carbonation and very slight hop bitterness. That is hard to discern as well. Very sweet taste. I really wanted to like this beer, but it is not really my cup of tea."

"I was always a little wary of this beer because when I visited Montreal, this is the beer that most of the vagabonds drank. But upon my taste I now know that Canadian vagabonds know whats up. This beer was outstanding. The appearance was a nice hazy yellow with a smell of floral notes with some citrus behind it. The taste was great with a hint of banana to it. Loved the feel of the beer as it seemed to just be a perfect balance. Overall I think this is a great beer and would wholeheartedly recommend to people to at least give a try."

"Pours golden honey with a tight three finger pure white head - overflowed the glass. Spicey nose with cloves and pepper. Very subdued pepper and maybe cardamon spice combined with lots of honey and apricot/peach. I've not had a lot of Belgian-style beers, but this is my favorite so far."

"Pours a hazy light gold from the tap. Big, foamy white head that holds for a bit. Smells of hay and fruit. Nice blend of apples and pears hits the tongue, with a touch of white grape. Smooth, crisp mouth. This is an excellent tripel that is light and refreshing."

"Haven't had this in years and was surprised by how much I loved it. Its a light orangey, yellow straw color with an incredibly soft white head and a little lacing. The smell is all stone fruits at first, Belgian yeast spiciness (white pepper, clove), banana, a little honey, vanilla and citrus peel. The taste follows the smell starting with strong peach and stone fruit notes, some candied pineapple, sweet honey, banana, and the spice profile grew as the beer warmed. A little bit of classic bubblegum flavor started to come out a bit too alongside of the clove. No traces of the booze. The clove was unique in that you would taste it and then feel all over the mouth like the way in which you feel clove. Really smooth with high level of carbonation. Could of drank this all night. Again, I had sort of considered this a gateway beer and hadn't thought of it much in a while but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one - really wonderful still."
"Overall, this is a very nice Tripel. Probably not the best I have ever had but it is up there. I would say this is the best non-Belgian example of the style I have come across."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a straw color with voluminous eggshell-colored head comprised of small bubbles; moderate retention with minimal lacing. The aroma is of lemon and orange citrus, white pepper, faint straw/hay, and grass. Quite the emphasis on the citrus. The taste begins with similar citrus, but almost immediately gives way to a rush of funk and clove. There is some white pepper, straw, grass, and another appearance of lemon zest on the finish. Great belgian yeast flavor throughout. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing, but does have a bit of a sticky, resinous finish. Overall, this is a very well done and traditional tripel that is very drinkable. The alcohol is completely hidden behind a nice, complementary bouquet of refreshing flavors."

"absolutely incredible. and especially for 9 abv. has all the earthy, banana type characters but the thing I love about this is the lemon juice that shines through. exquisite balance drinkability sweetness tartness and bitterness, rich feel, a big sugary. its just really nice"
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner. It hazy a hazy unfiltered amber color that I like. There is so much carbonation rising for the first couple minutes that it looks like an underwater volcano. Nice persistent lacing. The aroma is lemon, a bit nutty, and a bit too yeasty for my tastes. The flavor is rich, grain and mild hops, nutty, yeasty, and a bit herbal--like Ricola cough drops. Mouth feel is thick and creamy. This is a style of ale that I am not familiar with. I see so many if you rating this ale very high, and saying it is a perfect example of a tripel. I think my rating is influenced by my limited experience with and understanding of this style. Certainly very good, to most everyone else, outstanding."

""
""
""

"(I had this blind taste tested with Westmalle and Chimay. This was first. One of the best tripels I’ve had. This is where you want to be if you want sweet and fruitiness for tripels. For more dry and vinous, Westmalle, Long Strange Tripel, and some others is where it's at.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Delicious. This stuff is dangerously easy to drink with the 9% ABV hardly there. I haven't had a great deal of tripels, but this is easily the best so far. The flavor and body is just so harmonious."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was a big tripel fan when I first got into craft beers, and La Fin du Monde was a favorite. I noticed I never reviewed it, so picked up a bottle. My tastes have shifted over the years, so I wasn't as impressed, but this is still a high quality beer. I think the bottle may have been a year or two old, which may have subdued some of the flavor."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this years ago and, for whatever reason, I found it to be the least impressive of the Unibroue brews. Upon revisiting, I have to say, this is damn good. Not groundbreaking in any sense, but just a really good all-around golden ale with great balance and a luxurious mouthfeel. It's crisp enough to be refreshing in the summertime, but it also has enough warmth to be appropriate in colder months as well. Another winning effort from the Unibroue crew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall - Tasty! I like the lack of bitterness and the maltiness. The color makes it almost look less tasty, maybe because I am used to liking darker beers, but the taste is really good. It is a pretty heavy beer, so I wouldn't drink it fast. The only thing is that it almost tastes like it is missing something. Maybe a bit more spice? Still, a really nice beer, especially for the price."

"La Fin Du Monde is a tripel with a big 9% ABV. Great balance of spice, butter and citrus. Easy enough to drink that if your not careful, it could get in trouble. One of the finest Belgium doubles I've ever tasted. Near perfect~"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Unlike traditional Tripels with their ubitiqtious lemony citrus aroma and flavor, this beer is brew has the taste of orange. This beer taste like a descent Witbier."
""

"O: This is one of my favorites. It is very flavorful and yet balanced. Exactly what I look for in a trippel."
""

""

"Had it bottle in a Goblet. It pours a golden yellow, with a white head that dissipates slowly. It has a strong nose. I got a lot of floral hints and some coriander. It is a medium body with slightly high carbonation and also dry. On the taste I pick up some fruits such as apple and pear. I also get a little bit of spice. Overall this is a really good beer. Has an amazing aroma and tastes amazing. Overall this is one of my favorite beers now!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Picked this up solely on reputation as I recently had a local tripel which left me wanting to explore this style. This is pretty dang good."

"It's been many a fortnight since I've enjoyed this brew last; plucked it from the wine shop shelves as the first drink of 2014. Here's to a year of gaining weight, drinking more and being less productive. La Fin Du Monde pours a dull, effervescent copper orange with fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Opaque body, not a whole lot of lace. Sweet and spicy on the nose, with notes of coriander, oranges, bready yeast and assorted citrus. One previous reviewer likened the scent to ""salt sea air and steel."" Sure, why not? Spices and citrus carry through to the palate in a big way. It's a complex profile that's hard to tease apart, with sweetness and spice and everything malty. Something about the moutfeel has always felt a bit off to me. Heresy, I know. My expectations for the style don't mesh well with the heaviness and aggressively carbonation. It goes down tasty but I'd be lying if I said it goes down smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice fruity sweet start to the taste, malty and bready at first. The hops try to break through the sweetness and banana/apple character and do so subtly. The end is a very spicy clean taste almost like crushed pepper, warms the soul. Nice champagne-like carbonation is the perfect fit on this beer and one could be fooled into thinking it was more like 4%ABV and not the 9% that it is. Super well done belgian triple."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- This is a good beer, but one I would need to be in the mood for due to the spice."

"This is a beer that I'll always enjoy, but it's a bit too heavy for me. Given its similarity to a hefeweizen, I'd probably grab a Weihenstephaner instead. That isn't much of a knock, since the other is one of my favorites, but as the former is widely available, it does mean I won't buy this often going forward."

"Bottle at Ava's in Easton, MD. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a creamy white head in a Chimay glass. Aroma of pears, spice, yeast. Flavor follows with lots of fresh juicy pears, honey, some spice, and lingering yeast ones on the palate. Medium bodied, slightly dry finish yet still juicy, adequate carbonation. Such am easy drinking really world class brew."

"Overall it is a flavorful beer that is heavy and hits you hard with the ABV, but the taste, ABV burn and general composition are spot on for a Triple and this beer nails it. It is intense and has heat, but in a good way that reminds you of why you would drink a beer like this – because it is everything an Adjunct Lager is not: it’s complex, meant for sipping and each sip is different as the beer/yeast morph from exposure to air, temperature changes and fermentation. This is craft beer Monk style and not an attempt to mass produce a dull consistent flavor; this beer sits in the bottle and turns into an experience, and once again for me this brew was a great experience. A high recommendation, his is a great beer."
"O - 4.5 - Probably the best belgian strong pale ale that I've had. It's pretty amazing."
""
"Love, love this beer. The taste is phenomenal. The aroma makes my nose smile (if it could). The only reason it doesn't get perfect 5's is the high ABV. I want to be able to drink more of this beer in one sitting but 1 bottle does it for me. I'm so glad it is available year round at any decent bottle shop."

"I've found a Tripel in North America that isn't merely a clumsy tropical cordial aged for funk--this is a true craft that I'd drink way too much if I could. Good news is that it seems to be better (stronger spice-stone fruit flavor, cleansing salinity, and right-tuned malt) with some conditioning time in the bottle, so perhaps it will travel well to me in the future..."

"One of the first craft brews I enjoyed. Cloudy yellow in color with a two-finger white head that quickly disappears. It smells like banana and dried chili peppers. There's not a whole lot of funky yeast on the nose, as in more typical trippels. The taste is sweet with banana and maybe a little bit of mango flavor. There's also a spicy clove flavor and a low level of barnyard funk, but these flavors are rather low-key and it's much sweeter than your traditional dry Belgian trippel. There's huge carbonation in this beer and it has a medium body. Scarily easy to drink at 9%. It may not fit the style exactly but it is very good."
"Overall - Delicious, well crafted tripel that may be my favorite I've had in the style. Complex enough in that it is fun to identify all the different flavors and features of the beer, but at the end of the day the most enjoyment from this beer is still generated by actually just drinking it. Should I ever be stranded on a desert island with only one beer until the end of time in an ""end of the World"" scenario, La Fin Du Monde is certainly one I could live with and enjoy."

"A world class beer from Quebec. Pours a luminescent golden treacle colour with an attractive white head that leaves lacing throughout the glass. Warming aroma of caramelized malts with a Belgian yeast backbone and their cloves and spices. The flavour is well balanced, with malt and yeast depth from start to finish. Banana notes transition into caramel before a warming bitterness. The 9% ABV is scarily well hidden!"

"This complex and heady brew pours a beautiful lemon drop yellow with ample haze and copious quantities of white foam that holds up well. The aroma is potent yeasty esters, apple pomace, doughy malts, a little citrus, candi sugar, and aromatic alcohols that hint at what's ahead. This is a boozy, spicy blast of a tripel, with apple and pear, sweet doughnut malt, orange, musky grapes, and black pepper all vying for your attention, with a more subtle backdrop of dark dried fruits and unripe green stone fruits lurking amidst the pungent alcohol. Fizzy. Smooth dry finish but some residual yeasty sweetness lingers for up to an hour post-indulgence. One of the world's finest and easy to find on the prairies. Hard to knock this masterpiece, maybe the alcohol is a tad forward but its a tripel after all."

"Many of the triple's I have tasted over the years have been very good and clean. But what I think makes this one even more special is that it is so crisp and clean. I know a few that are NOT big fans of Triples, but this one, they would have a hard time not liking this one."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, almost opaque, orange-gold coloring with a filmy, sparse, white surface coating of head. Nose of significant spice blend first, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander in the mix. Bready notes, with some hints of citrus fruit, as well, but the spice dominates nicely. Flavors of banana bread forward, with another heavy dose of spicing that keeps the sweetness in check. More coriander and nutmeg, with some clove highlights in there, too. The body is smooth, with an effervesced feel that provides a crispness in combination with the spice profile. Bready sweet aftertaste supports the retaining spice blend, which also makes the transition into the finishing linger, with a clean, smooth feel. Solid representation of the style....very solid!"

""
"O- Top of the line Tripel for sure. It wouldn't be a reach for me to say it is maybe the best I've had yet. Sweet, fruity, complex, and delicious. Seems to have a lot of hefeweizen similarities with the wheat and clove character dominating throughout."

"O - This is not a subtle Tripel; there's quite a bit going on. Everything you'd expect is there, however, and every flavor is tasty. I can see what the (Uni)broue-ha-ha is about. This isn't my favorite Tripel, but it's very good."

"I hear the same things about this beer from anyone who has tried this beer, they cant believe its %9. It is rare to have people who do not usually like the taste of beer in general appreciating a %9 beer! I think it is the licorice that transforms the strong alcohol note into a spicy one, I perceive the same thing with sambuca or ouzo."

"I'm always cautious to rate beer too high because I don't always trust myself. With the number of different types of beer and personal taste preference it'll take way more practice to truly identify the best of each bunch. Besides, what lies between ""outstanding"" and ""perfect""? Regardless, this beer was incredibly good. I'm realitively new to the Tripel and got LFDM because of the high ratings on BA. That said, the flavours of this beer were very distinct, well balanced and downright tasty. There were so many different taste regions affected on my palate that I had a very tough time identifying the medley of flavours. The malts were not in anyway overpowering as one might think of a Tripel and a 22oz. bomber at 9% disappeared rather quickly. I'd venture to say that this is one beer deserves a place on every beer rack and should be brought our to impress the advocates in your circle."

"O – Wonderful Tripel, stays true to the style. Does a good job of bringing lots of complex flavors to the table without letting any one of them overpower another. Great balance, and highly refreshing. I can't think of a better time to sip this one than outside on the patio on a warm day. Wonderful, big bodied, delicious beer."
""
""

"This is my first review but what can I say I am in love with this beer. The color is a nice cloudy golden hue. With a nice bubbly 2 finger head. The smell is fruity with spice notes mainly clove or coriander. The taste is amazing. It has a very nice fruity taste with a slight bitterness and hints of clove which for me the clove seemed to lesson after a few sips. It has just the right amount of carbonation and has a bubbly pleasant mouth feel. What else can I say this is a world class beer. I would drink again in a heartbeat. This has become one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - IMO this is the best Tripel made outside of Belgium. We all know Belgium brewers produce some of the worlds best tripels, but this one compares to many of them. It's done in a traditional Tripel style and has the class to back it up. Unibroue aren't playing around with this brew and Its honestly a must have for just about anyone. A great big abv brew for warmer weather for sure."
""

"I dove deep into the Triple scene. My first was the Westvleteren 12 that my dad sent me. From what I've heard, this was the closest readily available beer to that. I have since tried the Rochefort 6-10 and I will say that I'd take the 8 and 10 over this if I had to. The LFDM has a perfect smell (once you get past the mile high fizzy head) and its initial taste is spot on. However, this beer took my breath away from the pure alcohol finish. Still a great beer but not what I was expecting"

"O: While the flavors on this one excel far beyond most, I'm just not flabbergasted by how good this one is. It's definitely a beer to be sipped slowly and respected. Well-rounded flavors and a smooth, creamy drinkability make this a wonderful beer to relax with an truly enjoy. It's just not something that'll find its way into my regular pick-ups."

"Rusty orange in color. Short lasting head with little or no lacing Okay this is my first Trippel rating. Not my favorite beer Lot's of clove flavor Recommended serving temp is 45-50 so even though I let it warm up a bit its not likely I let it was to warm. I don't have much experiance with this type of beer and its unlikely I'll be getting more any time soon. The brewer made a good clean beer...just not my speed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Too much of an alcohol taste. I don't know if I got my hands on a bad bottle, I wouldn't say it's undrinkable, I did finish the bottle, but it was way too boozy for my taste. The alcohol taste and aftertaste just overshadow everything that could be great about this beer. I understand that it's a tripel, and supposed to be alcoholic, but this is a little above and beyond to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Very very good. I was expecting to be overwhelmed by this Belgian Tripel after reading all the rave reviews, but to be honest I prefer their Don De Dieu. Maybe because I just had a Hef from a local brewer that tastes very similar this."

"O: This is an alright beer, though I do not like clove. That said, the clove is a little too much for me. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a huge fan of this beer. I appreciate the complexity, but the only thing worse than clove in a beer, in my opinion, is anise."

"This poured a hazy sunshine yellow with a tall head of loose bubbles that receded to an attractive collar and cap. Good lacing and alcohol legs. On the nose is plenty of yeast, sweet malt, sugary lemon and tangerine. On the palate it’s buttery smooth, spritzy carbonation and a little thin. It reminds you of a hefe with a little banana but it’s too sticky and the alcohol warms you and gives it away that this is a tripel. Short sweet finish, no hops on the palate at all. Understated and bewitching. This is a very well turned out tripel that would meet the end of the world with an attitude of aplomb."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much all the flavors and aromas that I look for in the style and it was pretty dry, might be the driest Tripel I have had and I thought it worked well with this beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, the alcohol was hidden well, it was pretty crisp and refreshing, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, this may be the most drinkable Tripel I have had so far, I would have no problem drinking a whole bottle and I don't think I would rule out having a couple glasses of this on a warm summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style and balanced it was, it's just what I want in a Tripel. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, and I would for sure like to try a fresher bottle, it's priced pretty fairly for what you get and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style and I think it would be a nice beer to introduce someone to Belgian beers. All in all I enjoyed this beer, I think it's one of the best Tripel's that isn't made in Belgium, it's very hard to compete with the Belgians when it comes to this style, but this beer can hold it's own. Good job guys, I really need to get around to trying more Unibroue beers, I haven't had a bad one yet. So far this my favorite beer from them and Unibroue is my favorite Canadian brewing company."

"Overall - This is a top-of-the-line Tripel. Thoroughly enjoyed and would definitely recommend for those into this style."

"Overall this beer reminds me of their belgian counterpart; in particularly, it reminds me of Tremens and Westmalle."
"overall: Probably my favorite from Unibroue. All of their beers are well crafted and do not disappoint, but this one is a step above the rest. Has characteristics of all the great trappists, if I had this blind I would guess it was from Belgium and brewed by monks. This was a steal at Trader Joes, for the price it is the best beer you can buy. Probably the best outside-of-Europe take on a trappist i've had besides Final Absolution by Dragonsmead (Michigan Microbrewery)."

"Unibroue tried to reduce the gas in its product, but couldn't manage the variation which is producing a very large number of flat or very nearly flat beers. La fin du monde shoulld have some gas, enough to push the cork from the bottle. Their quality control has become pathetic, i am very sorry to say."

"So, there seems to be a love hate kind of thing with this beer, so I will be as frank as I can. The past reviews seem to be between 3 and 5. I give it a 4.25. This brew was on sale at kroger at 7.99, so I got one to drink and one to age. The one I drank opened with apricot and yeast. The fruitiness covers the 9 abv, but can still taste the booziness. This is one to age, in my opinion. For the here and now, it just doesn't seem ready to drink right off the shelf. not ready yet. Just tastes like a young barleywine, sorta. Of course, I will finish this bottle, but I look forward to tasting the one that I will age for at least one year."

"Day drinking at the Downey brewery, an alpine backwoods bar in the middle of urban sprawl, in a well-stocked but completely empty bar(the guy drinking a Stella doesn't count). It poured a thin white head, with color like a ray of sunshine through the clouds at Diamond Head. Tightly carbonated with lingering head. Hay, black currant, and crisp alcohol notes dominate the initial impressions. Lingering flavors of balsa wood sans spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy but robust with aftertaste to spare. Overall, it stands out above most other Tripel's and enjoys an easy drinkability."

"Overall: My first Unibroue beer was an excellent one. This beer is an excellent representation of the tripel style, and the famed Unibroue yeast only serves to improve it. As others have mentioned, it is the taste that is the highlight of this beer, though no other aspect is really a slouch. While the alcohol is noticeable, the beer still drinks less than its posted alcohol content, and could definitely sneak up on the drinker if he or she is not careful. Here’s to hoping the rest of my journey into Unibroue is as great as this one was. 17/20"

"The highlight of this beer is the taste. I don't think I've ever tasted a better tripel in my life. A variety of spices and fruits blend together smoothly in a pleasing manner that reminds me of cool fall afternoons in New England. It is completely unique and it must be tasted to be understood."
"Final Thoughts: As of the writing of this review, we have a new champion as La Fin Du Monde has unseated Peche Mortel & Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier as my highest ranked beer. Unibroue has shown me the folly of not partaking in more of their beers."

"If you are in Nashville sometime, La Fin is on draft at The Pharmacy in East Nashville. They have a number of other fine beers on draft, of course, along with a terrific beer garden out back to serve great brats, burgers, etc. You can find it by the bottle in most places that serve high gravity beers, including the Flying Saucer. The Saucer, by the way, also has Chimay on tap just in case you want to do a taste test between the two."

"O: worth the 3 months it took to get my hands on a bottle. Phenomenal tripple, I could sip this all freaking day. Words fail. By the way, that never-ending head is still there after like 10 minutes. I know a tripple and a strong are different but I would say that this is on par with Duvel but a little sweeter for when I am in a semi-dry mood rather than a dry mood."

"maybe it's because ive never had a tripel before, but this was a serious let down for the money. people go on and on about bananas and cloves and this and that... all i got was the impression that a heavy ale had sex with an underdone mead and this was the result. there was a slight fruitiness that was quickly overtaken by a hot alcoholy quality. it was more like drinking medicine than beer. i wont be trying this one again."

"It pours a hazy orange with a white head. There are a lot of bubbles rising to the top of the glass. Head retention is good with decent lacing. it smells of yeast and fruit. Apples, grapes, peaches, and I think it smells a bit like coconut as well. It's like a huge fruit bowl condensed into one 12 oz bottle. The taste it a bit sour and the fruit flavors transfer over well from the aroma. I don't detect much hops, and there is hardly any bitterness. It's medium bodied on the palate. The carbonation is very high, but it works with the tart flavors to produce a surprisingly refreshing feeling. Try it if you haven't already."
""
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers, in my favorite style. They do a great job with this one getting all sorts of flavors but leaving out the alcohol bite that are in some tripels."

"Bought a bottle from Safeway. Had wanted to try for sometime now. Aromas are tart. I thought I picked up a bit of a tart cherry scent. Yeasty notes also. Beautiful looking pale gold, very hazy. Head so white it might be neon, lingers then recedes to tiny bubbles. Slightly tart taste, pear maybe. Has a bit of clove spiciness too. Very carbonated with a very dry finish. Overall, very good offering. Nice warming effect yet refreshing at the same time."
"This is the beer that lets you know that developing your palette for superior beers paid off. You moved from mediocre Buds or skunky Heiniken, to the Sam Adams variety pack, or the Belguim variety pack (Stella, Hogarden, Leffe), and now you're ready for the Big Leagues of beer. The welcoming committee comes out for this one. They say yes, you thought Sierra Nevada Pale Ale was the end-all of beer. But now you've had the best! No longer can you settle for Shock Top. No longer does it makes sense to put an orange in your Blue Moon. Welcome to a mature natured beer!!!"

"Poured this Tripel from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color, produced a thick creamy white head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma consisted of pale malt, peach juice and yeast. Medium bodied,a base of sweet malted grain, spicy white pepper, apple and pear juice followed by floral hops, and alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel and dry finish makes this the most outstanding Belgian beers I have sampled. Everything from Unibroue Brewery has been outstanding-"

"Best 9.00% beer I've ever had. I prefer it when poured correctly, which most bars that I frequent don't do. For best flavor, use a Duvel-like chalice and pour at an angle slowly until about one inch of head is achieved. Then pour rest of beer into glass after about a minute or so. It has a very distinct bitter-sweet taste, although once you have acquired a taste for La Fin, it goes down very smoothly. One of my favorites, although a 4-pack where I live goes for around $11, and the bars usually charge $8-10."
"""It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feeeel fine," wrote one particular band of New Foundland origin. I can totally agree with that statement and if the world's ending, grab a bottle of this bigtime Belgian. These Unibroue folks are giving Belgians a run for their money and they have absolutely perfected all styles. I cannot find fault in this beer, but it's not for the faint-of-heart. It pours big and frothy, with the hint of sweetness you would expect from the Belgian yeast. I poured it into a snifter, like you should, and I let it relax and warm for a few minutes before inhaling. It warmed me right up and gave me the feeling like that if the world did end there and then, this beer was taking me into a world of its own! I would say that this is a beer for someone who's open-minded. Someone who likes to sit and sip a beer or two while those around him/her down pint after pint. A beer for old souls who know that if the world ends, they lived a pretty damn good life and they let out a big, cheerful ""Salut!"" in jest."

"Objective review time. Best by 1/15 you say? Pours a hazy gold color with fast fading white head, thin ring with no lace on the glass. Smell: candy sweetness, clove, pear note. Taste: clove infused pale malt, mildly spicy and alcoholic, pear, golden raisin. Light+ bodied, then the carbonation goes a little over the top, finishes drying with clove and a little lingering sweetness. I haven't had one of these for 4 or 5 years. It's totally decent and enjoyable, but, wow, is it massively overrated on review sites."

"Lemony taste. Nice and frothy. Goes really well with bready cheesey food. Does not overpower what you are eating and washes it down nicely. Nice light in color. Finish is pleasant. We get so many bad beers from Canada, it is nice to get a truly exceptional beer from north of the border"

"Silky smooth, creamy body approaches perfection. Rich malts, a kiss of Belgian yeast and spice, hints of sweetness and more malt. I always forget how good this is. Superb."
"Random notes on this beer: This is my second time having it. This is the brew that introduced me to the glorious world of Unibroue. Its not my favortie from them but more than worth having. I'm having it now because when I started drink it it was 12/21/12 and I made a pleadge to have it at midnight as the name itself apparentlly means The end of the world. Ultimately I used that as an excuse to have this agian."
""
"Final Grade: 4.61, a virtually flawless A+. La Fin du Monde is one of Canada's finest beers, though I'm not entirely sure it would be my first ""last"" beer choice if I believed we were all completely doomed. It remains an unbelievably great value purchase for any tripel fan, both in terms of price point, quality, and wide accessibility/distribution. For these reasons, it is well worth a purchase for anyone interested in the style. I've had this before, and I'll probably have it again, and would recommend everyone else follow suit."
""

"Overall, this beer is unique in the style and has an unbelievable amount of flavor, very hard to tame if you are not familiar with belgian ales, it is very complex. From start to finish this beer is incredible, make sure it is not served to cold."
"The beer pours an ugly piss yellow with hints of orange and with a very soapy head on it that fizzles away slowly, and sits over the beer as the color of soap bubbles. The beer’s body is cloudy like piss, but allows a fair amount of light through. On the nose, this beer smells of soy sauce and banana phenol notes with some very slight bubblegum hints. Fruity soy sauce is really what comes to mind when you smell it, though not in an entirely bad way. On the tongue, the beer tastes of creamy banana, soy, and some nice clove-like spice. The beer really begins with light soy notes that grow in fruitiness until they hit banana flavors, and all the while the spicy clove also builds on the sides of the flavor, and leaves the aftertaste to ring lightly of spice and slight banana. The middle of the taste is really where this beer shines, with big spicy cream banana notes that are quite pleasant on the taste buds. On the mouth, this beer feels quite fierce with carbonation, though the beer below it sits with a nice medium body that sticks to the tongue, and leaves the mouth clean, but with sticky saliva along the sides of the mouth. Overall, this is a nice tripel-style ale with some great phenolic notes, and some nice spicy complexity. A fitting beer to end the world with, I suppose, though it isn’t my favorite in the style. Still, this beer is worthy of a try."

"-Overall 4.0: A very good tripel, triple, etc. However, I have to state that, to my tastes, it is a bit too dry and lacking in depth of flavor. The middle, especially, should have had more depth. Unibroue is a legend, and for good reason, but it is my opinion that this is not the best beer they produce."
""
""
""

This seems to be a basic ""Triple, Golden Ale."" Maybe I just don't get it or the style but this isn't something I'd try again."

"O - wow. Tough to pick between this and karmaliet, either way this is one of my favourite beers."

"Pours a cloudy yellow with a small head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is spicy bananas, cloves, coriander and pepper. Taste is a sweet-and sour medley of bananas, funky spices and coriander. Mouthfeel is alive, bubbly like champagne. Alcohol is well hidden but you still get a slight taste - nothing overbearing. Overall a great tripel and another home run from Unibroue."

"O: This is a great beer, no doubt about that. It hits all of the right notes in terms of aroma and taste for a Tripel. It's especially impressive for the price. I'm not sure why it took me so long to have a La Fin Du Monde but I'll be seeking this one out more often now."
""
"Fuller medium body, slightly higher carbonation, bubbly and crisp on the tongue. It's been years since I've had this, but Unibroue really makes a nice tripel. The ABV is right on point, but not overbearing, and I enjoyed the balance of spice and hops."
""
""
""
""
"If confronted with ""la fin du monde", or ""the end of the world", this would be the my first choice of brews to sip on. It's tasty and refreshing."
""
"Ready-Set-Enjoy a super fun drinking beer! The pour is sophisticated and just the correct beautiful foam lingering head. The spices are correctly proportioned, somebody said grapefruit, maybe, but absolutely a nice citrus, then comes banana and a hint of coriander. Nothing overdone, well balanced, smell so intriguing, almost a sexy come on. Unibroue always seems to hit it out and this tripel certainly maintains their tradition of excellence. As with all high ABVs, think about it before driving after a couple of these, but that said, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
"Very strong carbonation up front. The body is light-medium. Ending is lightly bitter."

"O-this is my 3rd Unibroue, all 3the are my favorite belgian style beers. This one is a liquid fruit cocktail. So many different fruits attack the senses that i'm sure i missed some in my review. For a 9% abv brew the alcohol is extremely tame, enhancing the flavor and leaving a somewhat white wine like flavor. Spices and sparkling apple cider round out this amazing brew."
"On tap at kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Huge white, fluffy head, high retention, soapy,sticky lacing. Aroma includes lemon peel, banana, clove, nice white pepper spiciness. Taste includes all of the same, also some candi sugar. Deliciously ""wispy"" and certainly deserving of all of its accolades."
""
""
""

"O. I really enjoyed this beer but expected more complexity in the flavor. I would not hesitate to get another bottle as it is delicious."

""

""

"O: This is a very well enjoyable beer. It's not overly complex, flavours are a bit hidden and it is sweeter then bitter on the balance scale. I think it's a great introduction to a Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Unibroue is one of my favorite breweries as almost every Unibroue drink I have had has exceeded my expectations by miles. La Fin Du Monde is no different. This is one of m favorite beers by them and one of my favorite beers in general. It's an extremely well made Triple ale on lees. If you took Blue Moon and made it 10x better, you would have La Fin Du Monde. I also enjoy it with slices of grapefruit (that's right, not oranges). I drink this beer regularly and recommend it to all beer-curious folk. Just be careful that hidden 9% ABV doesn't sneak up on you!"
""

""
""
"This is my favorite beer in the world. Pouring it angled properly yields little head, sometimes I get a thick foamy white head. There are tons of sweet and fragrant aromas that I'm not so good at identifying, but it is quite pleasant. I know cloves are in there. The taste is similar, with many different flavors. VERY smooth, flavorful, yet robust with a well-hidden 9% kick that you feel in your head rather than your tongue. The label of the bottle is amazing, and the title is French for ""The End of the World."" For me, personally, this is the end-all-be-all of great beer. I also love the sound of the cork popping. These are now available at my local grocer (the nice one, anyway) for around $7 a bottle. Awesome deal."

"O: I'm still trying to find a spot in my heart for Belgians. Usually they are too malty and peppery for me, and I find myself disliking the flavor. This was a decent beer with an adequate taste that many would find very enjoyable, but what I really liked was the overall mouthfeel. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"341mL bottle. Pours a beautiful cloudy golden with a modest white head and some yeast particulate floaties. Nose is spice, orange peel, yeast, granny-smith apples. Initial taste shows how high the carbonation is in this tripel. Lots of yeast, bubblegum, citrus, cloves, and tropical fruit. Very smooth and creamy rather than watery and acidic. Alcohol is perfectly hidden. Refreshing, not too light, and awesome! One of the first beers I ever fell in love with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably my favorite beer in the style (Tripel) and a great example of it... The alcohol is extremely well hidden making the beer quite easy to drink but I know it needs to be sipped or it really sneaks up on you. Definitely one to have again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall – A very tasty and enjoyable to drink beer. This beer has one of the best feels of any beer I have ever had, as it seems to match and complement the flavor transitions perfectly. This is definitely one to try."

"Hazy straw color; very fizzy to style; malty / spicy nose; 9% alcohol comes through immediately on first sip; wide complexity of flavors from spices, vanilla, clove, lemon and banana with mild lactic sourness; moderate late hop presence with long spicy hop finish. A beautiful and complex ale."
"Holy Cow... Go Quebec! This is a wonderful beer. Fruity nose, but with no cloying, too-sweet flavors. You get the pears and tropical fruit, but when coupled with gentle hopping the flavor profile mellows into a balanced, pleasant drinkability. The hazy appearance is lovely and golden. This is a great late summer beer. I will certainly get it again!"

"	Overall Impression: honestly, I was hoping for something more, and admittedly my expectation may have colored my impression of the beer; I love Belgian Ales and this was supposed to be a great one...it's just good; it's certainly not as sweet as it smells and not as sweet as some other Belgians that I have had, especially since it ends on a dry, bitter note that I am not wild about; it is complex, it has a richness of flavor; the best part of the taste is the middle, where some of the characteristics of a classic Belgian come out-but I think that the best part of the beer is how it looks...it looks perfect and pretty"

"This is a well done tripel ale. Balanced extremely well and fairly complex - load of fruits and esters can be picked out of this one. Sweet, without being too sweet, and fairly mild on the palate for a 9% ABV brew. Bravo."
"O- this is a tripel. A tripel that is brewed in Quebec, Canada. Now these are the most well known people to brew a Belgium to the rights of a standard Belgium tripel. This brewery holds the closest path to Belgium from America... you want a good Belgium?! Look for uniboure.... not a let down at the least!"
""
""
"O-Fin du Monde remains one of my favorite beers of all time. Everything is just done so well...the smell, the flavors, the feel, c'est magnifique. if you are looking for a pale brew to sip on or pair with some cheese, look no further."

""
""

"O: An excellent and faithful example of the style. Crisp and refreshing. Excellent complexity while maintaining balance of flavors. Very strong belgian yeast presence - that one really stands out. Definitely seek this one out if that is your thing."

""
"To me, this tastes like a hybrid between a tripel and wit. The alcohol is hidden and it's very easy to drink. One of my staples."

"2 thumbs up"

"O- This is an extremely well-rounded tripel that I won't think twice about purchasing in the near future. Probably my favorite beer as of now."

"Pours a hazy golden sunrise color with a tremendous towering white head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a rocky lace and spider webs across the glass. Nose is of fruity esters with notes of banana, clove, bubblegum, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Fairly full in body with a very fine champagne-like carbonation that is oh so smooth. Taste begins with a good deal of fruitiness (nectarine, pear, peach, mango, and white grape) and flowery honey blended with peppery clove. Next comes some powdery yeasts and a bit of bready malt followed by a touch of drying alcohol"
""
""
"O - This was one of those perpetually available, phenomenal beers that I pass up on every time at the store because it will always be there anyway. I decided to grab a single during a recent haul, and I was not disappointed. The aroma is amazing and the flavor is good, although I found it to be a little bit too sugary sweet at some points. Not one I get regularly, but certainly a benchmark for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Overall this is just one of my favorite beers out there. Great Belgian yeast going on it here, so spicy, mildly fruity, sweet and slightly bitter, and utterly drinkable. I love this beer. Probably in my top ten."

""

"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice hazy color body with a small fizzy white head. The smell is fruity and yeasty. The taste is banana up front with a hint of spice.

"Bought a bottle of this from M&R Liquors in Vernon, Connecticut. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Beautiful light gold bubbly ale with a petry dish foam and a semi-clear consistency. Smells of green apple, clove, banana, pear, wheat, hops, and honey. Taste similarly follows with the green apple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. The only flaw of this is how the flavor dies off a bit as the brew begins to warm (uncharacteristic of a stronger brew), and it has a bit too much excess gas. Other than that, this is an outstanding brew that is easily one of my all-time favorites. Enjoy!"

"O-It was a really good beer, however I did not see what everyone is crazy about. I'll have to try it again sometime."
"Overall it's a solid beer. Haven't had it in about a decade. Don't need to have it again any time soon."
"Taste is banana up front with a nice chewy bready malt middle. A very nice sting from the carbonation with some bitter spice notes - clove. An excellent beer, maybe not a lot going on, but the few notes are played excellently and come together in a beautiful harmony of flavor."
"Will get it again."
"Overall: an excellent, excellent beer. I was skeptical after my first sniff, but it still blew my socks off."
"WOW !!.... What a shock.... I'm not a big fan of lagers, but this lager is anything but.... The look of it as you pour it into a glass is that of an unfiltered wheat beer.... A thick golden color with a well balanced head.... It has a strong nose of citrus with a taste to match it.... Your mouth is left with a strong, yet pleasant, aftertaste that lingers.... I enjoy this brew as much as any from this Canadian based brewery.... A must have."
""
""
"o: Although a little yeastier than I personally prefer, but was my first Tripel foray and I was impressed. This took me around 1 hour to finish one bottle, and should be respected by drinking slowly. This is definately not my style of beer, but I respect the complexity of this brew enough to weed through my own personal bias and rate it on my interpretation of the style."

"D - A complex but accessible tripel from one of my favorite breweries. I can't help but feel a touch disappointed in the end though. While this is definitely a world class beer, and one of the best tripels period, this didn't totally blow me away, and it wasn't really miles apart from similar offerings from Unibroue. I would consider Blonde de Chambly, La Gaillarde, and Eau Benite to be, in ways, quite comparable to La Fin Du Monde. But that's no knock on this brew, as I've enjoyed all of those afformentioned comparisons immensely."

""
""
""
"I really like this beer. The pour is quite light and yellowish. The smell is very clear with dominate fruits at its core. The taste was one of the best I've had. It is quite smooth, and despite 9% alcohol, it doesn't overwhelm the beer. The fruitiness (orange? apricot?) is very pleasant. There are also a slight caramel malt taste to it. Overall, those folks up in Quebec done did it good."

This is a strong candidate for one of the best beers I've ever had, and I wouldn't be ashamed to show up at any beer party with this in tow."
""
""

"Overall a very nice showing. Certainly shines above most tripels. It's pretty widely available and worth checking out."

"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a light copper with a one finger head with carbonation bubbles rising steadily. Leaves decent lacing. The smell is of wheat, citrus, and perhaps a little bit of grapefruit. Tastes very much like a wheat ale, Although very pleasant without the lemon dish soap aftertaste. Some mild citrus, very faint hops, And light malt. The mouthfeel keeps the same flavors although it greatly opens ip the wheat. the citrus also comes through a bit more. Overall, It reminded me of a very good wheat ale. Would I buy it again? Yes, although I am not a huge fan of any beer with wheat flavor. But this one was good."
""
"An outstanding beer, I can see why even though this is not rare by any means, this beer is still clinging to its place in the top 100."
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers. If you like tripels this is a must try. Unibroue is one of the best breweries in north America."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't let the appearance fool you; this is a pale, clearish straw golden beer with large-ish bubbles (it seemed to me) that were bolder than the measley, weakling bubbles produced by Cristal, for example. However it is no Pabst!! You'll notice it stinks; spicy is a good start but the banana and fruit really clobber you after that. Once drinking is commenced the Fin du Monde tastes like a perfectly spiced Indian dessert- cardamom and clove flavors are present. The carbonation is just about spot on. For my first ever restaurant-beer and a blind choice by me with no prior knowledge of Unibroue or La Fin other than a love of the trippel style, I'd rate this a 6/5."

"Overall - As with the last 2 Unibroue brews I've tried (and I'm guessing the 4th too) this beer rides on it's excellent mouthfeel to give it it's distinctive mark in the beer world. Entirely smooth and drinkable; deceptive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - This is one of my favorite beers for a reason: it is unique and absolutely huge given the sweet nature. Truly the pinnacle of what Unibroe has produced and I will be drinking this one until they cease production."
""
""
"O - Glad to get around to reviewing this one. Perhaps Unibroue's best offering. Easily a top shelf tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Excellent."
""
""
"Drinkability: it goes down well without offending the senses, and while it is not to my usual taste, it is quite nice, with a pleasant buzz to boot."
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy golden pour, 3 inch cream head, good lacing.Reminds me very much of other Unibroue brews in smell (and taste) smell of almond, pear, raisin. Taste much the same, light creamy, flavorful, amazing mouthfeel. Probably the most 'easy' of all the unibroue's in terms of drinkability and find-ability. Highly recommended."
"The taste is very light for such a big beer. The aftertaste is the highpoint - wonderful. I would like the beer if it were more tart, but I like it the way it is just fine as well. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After trying many other Triples I came back to La Fin Du Monde and remembered why it was so highly rated. There aren't many tripels made outside of Belgium that are this good, maybe none."
""
"O: very good tripel, but I am just about done with spice as I've had a lot of spiced beers in the last couple of days. Will come back to it, but I don't think it's quite on par with the trappist versions."

"Bottle poured into glass. Pouts mostly clear gold with white head that leaves considerable amount of lacing. The nose is full of fruity esters, notes of banana, heavy clove, some notes of lemon. Taste features more of the same as the nose. Very estery, lots of spice, and nice balance. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall, delicious example of style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great tripel. Recently, I tried the St. Bernardus tripel, which is much smoother and more malty than the fin. I also like the Allagash tripel. So when it comes to tripels, one of my favorite styles, it is best to try a lot of them and rotate tastings."
""
"O: Most of the attributes of this beer are good, but the taste is just spectacular, world-class in my opinion. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow. Thick white head. Excellent retention. Excellent lacing. Smells a bit on the boozy side. Some fruits and spice there too. While the alcohol scent is strong, it isn't bad at all. The taste is something else. Very floral and grainy. Belgian yeast gives it a nice flavor. Bananas, clove, citrus. So much going on here. Feels thick with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"love this classic. pours cloudy but radiant orangey gold with a moderate white head with reaosnable lacing. smells like epic fruity and spicy belgian yeast. fermented pear, allspice, and citrus dominate the nose, while wheat malt and banana creep into the flavor profile. the balance and complexity of this beer are unrivaled. heaps and heaps of floral notes as well, yeasty but crisp at the same time. there is also an alcohol warmth which is rather addicting, especially as it warms. the mouthfeel, is near perfect. absolutely brilliant carbonation that just dances in the mouth, jivey and fresh. medium body but light color, can be heavy at room temperature, but spot on when chilly. this is one for the ages. maybe the best tripel out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you haven't tried this, you really have to. Very worth the positive ratings it receives. One of the best beers I've tried to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At first it is sweet and maybe a little bland, then the heavier yeast flavor kicks in a with a slight choppy aftertaste. Sits well in the mouth, easy to drink but feels substantial. Not complicated tastes, but not a shallow beer either"

"Before summing this up, let me say that Tripels are not my favorite style. That said, this beer is the perfect Tripel to complement Trois Pistoles (the Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Unibroue). Both have enigmatic flavor profiles that are difficult to wrap your head around. You think you know what's coming when you take a sip, but somehow the flavors seem surprising. This beer (and it's cousin) are not everyday pours, but definitely deserve repeated visits from every Beer Advocate."

""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. For 9% it is easily approachable and enjoyable but carries with it a warmth that is to be respected. It has a good rounded character about it that makes it dangerously light and refreshing. I could see myself getting in trouble with several bottles of this despite the warming impact it has. Certainly worth a try."

"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours slightly cloudy yellow-orange amber. Slight head, but a bit of lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and fruit, very nice. Slightly dry, sweet malt, caramel, fruit and Belgian spicing. Delicious and wonderful. Perhaps the best non-belgian tripel."

"poured into a pint glass. This beer had an orangish color with medium head. Carmel and other spices mad this beer taste rare. Very strong tasting but it is worth it. Mouthful is about the same. Not your usual beer, but a walk on the canadian side this beer is one of canada's finist"

"More often than not, I have been disappointed with Unibroue as a whole. But, La Fin Du Monde is an elite beer, no question. I can do without many of their strong darks, wits, fruit beers, and pales; but, I’ll be back now and again to enjoy this here tripel. 4.5"

"This is my favorite beer by far."

"Poured a 12-ounce bottle into a Mad Elf tulip glass. Pours golden- pretty much a standard appearance for a tripel. Aroma is extremely fruity; almost overwhelming. The taste almost completely matches the aroma- such an aggressive spiciness to this beer that it borders on perfumy. Overall a decent beer fr an excellent Canadian brewery, but probably on the average end of beers I've had in this style in my opinion. When I go for a Unibroue brew I go for Maudite- I find it so much better."
"Drinkability: Always a winner, great Belgian tripel from Canada."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours very hazy golden with a finger length white head that dissipates slowly. A nice cap of lacing is left on top and there is some lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma is of fruit and yeast. It reminds me of a Hefeweizen, only the smell is a little more potent. The flavors of fruit and malt really come through in this brew, but it is not too sweet. The alcohol does come through only slightly in the flavor. There is a pleasing balance to this beer from the spice and the flavors from the malt and the yeast. The flavors of fruit really come through in this brew, but it is not too sweet. The alcohol does come through only slightly in the flavor. There is a pleasing balance to this beer from the spice and the flavors from the malt and the yeast. It is very easy to gulp, but you want to sip this and savor it.

"Poured into a snifter, heightening the perfume-like spice aromas, which I am not a fan of. It pours a nice cap of head with a beautiful golden glow and such wonderful texture. Unfortunately, this was the only part i found appealing about this beer. The taste is way over spiced and borders on the artificial for me. It is this observers opinion that this beer, along with the rest of the Unibroue line, are cheap imitations of noble beer styles, all with an artificial tasting backbone. I really don't understand all the acclaim this beer continues to receive, but there must be something wrong with me, as just about everyone from the uninitiated to the most seasoned beer enthusiasts seem to give it such high praise. Incredibly disappointing, each and every time i've revisited it."
""
""
""

""

"This isn't a bad beer at all, but I don't really see it being the most addictive beer I'll ever have per se. You do get your money's worth though, and if you like tripels, I can see you liking this beer. If nothing else, La Fin Du Monde has me curious about the tripels now..."

"This is a really good beer, the alcohol is well hidden and is very drinkable."
"Real fruity with all kinds of things going through nose. alcohol in smell but not noticeable in taste. Spicy in nose and taste, rounds out with yeasty aftertaste. High Carb pops hops in mouth and swallowing keeps taste in mouth for days. Overall a delicious triple offering from Canada with great burps!!"

"O - I've heard a lot of good things about this beer and it was definitely tasty. I'm not going to say I haven't had better Tripels, but one sure positive regarding this beer is the way it hides the alcohol. No sign of it anywhere at any point. The major downside is that it just smells and drinks way too much like a witbier for my taste. Nevertheless, it is highly drinkable and seems well-suited for a hot summer day."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a bleach white head, some light orange hues are noticable the longer I look. Oh how I love the smell of a Tripel! Apple, pear, clove, black pepper, yeast, and booze. Getting some earthy tones off the first sip, that black pepper is back also. This beer definitely doesn't hide the fact that it's 9%. This beer is smooth at first, but i'm not digging the carbonation on the way down. Overall a very very solid Tripel, but I've had better."
"O: Incredibly smooth, complex, and balanced. It should be hard to find a better tripel."
""

"Pours like a murky apple cider with a couple of fingers of delicate, short-lived white froth. Minimal beading. Smells lovely - cloves, banana, soft citrus, candy-like booze. Very unique taste. It's got all the elements of the nose with the addition of some white grapes or apple? Very smooth and virtually zero traceable alcohol burn. The body is light, easy-drinking which really goes a long way here. A well executed, refreshing Tripel."

"M-light and bubbly, does not taste like 9%!! Very light."

""
"O- This is a very complex, well made triple with a huge flavor profile. I really want to give this a 5 but I didn't get the big creamy head that is supposed to be typical for this style. I'm not sure it is reasonable to expect a creamy head since this is bottle conditioned with carbonation that reminds me of fine Champaign. I am going to make this a regular part of my lineup and look forward to pairing it with food."

""
""
""
""
""
"D: La Fin du Monde is a crisp and dry offering from Unibroue that is reminiscent of a dry bubbly champagne and is easy to drink. I think of this as a champagne like beer, drink in moderation for optimal enjoyment. Try with spicy thai red curry soup. The malty sweet and sharpness of the carbonation balanced off the sweet and salty. Also paired with a more classic french dish of creamy potatoes, pan fred trout and asparagus. The full flavour and dry aftertaste compliment the fish and butter in the dish - great offering."

"Pours a golden color with a nice white head. There's definitely a high sweetness level here that is cut nicely with some doughiness, in both flavor an taste: yeast, banana, pear, apricot, spice. The doughiness cuts into that sweetness nicely and allows me to really enjoy what would otherwise be a overl sweet beer for me, personally. A nice medium bodied, maybe even a little heavy creamy moutfeel. I had tried one Unibroue offering prior to this and really disliked it and almost wrote the entire brewery off. So glad that I didn't as this is a mighty fine brew that I would have hated myself for if I never gave it a try."

"I have had this beer several times. While I am impressed by the beer, I am not as overwhelmed as others. Poured from the bottle, the beer radiates a pleasant sour but fruity aroma. The scent gives a positive hint of what is to come. Giving a moderate head, the color is a cloudly golden color. The initial taste is a nice fruity sour flavor. It almost seems like a orange flavored Belgian. For some reason, I feel like the taste should be somewhat more complex. Being a Tripel, it is somewhat thick. Some might even describe it as being slightly chewy. There is some degree of spiciness in the aftertaste that is accompanied by a slight warming sensation as the beer goes down. While the aftertaste is mild, it does leave a pleasant reminder."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"To me, this transcends not only the tripel style, but beers as a whole. There's something really magical happening here amid the purposefully over-the-top recipe that makes you sit back and relax and enjoy life. No matter how insane and alcoholic it is by the end, it's a balanced beer unlike anything else. I'm having trouble describing it myself. However, it's a good pairing with any cuisine – especially spicy Mexican or latin food. Thai food could also work well. If not pairing with food, I recommend that it be consumed with patience and respect. This is intense yet marvelous stuff."
""
"Pours a cloudy gold/straw color with a one finger white head. Retention isn't great but that is to be expected with a 9% ABV beer. Smell is bready, and of apples, and cloves. Taste first comes through with soft and sweet wheat, a hint of apple, A touch of alcohol, smooth sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy. This is a fantastic triple, though not my personal favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is baked apples, croissant-like buttery bread, soft alcohol. It has a crisp resonance on the tongue from the carbonation that I think is truly awesome in the way it balances out both the beer’s pillowy softeness and alcohol content. La Fin Du Monde’s tasty characteristics certainly place it ahead of the pack. I tried a Green Flash tripel last week on tap and it was good; this is much better."
""
""
"O - This has awesome drinkability. I could drink this all night. It is just delicious and the feel is great. I really enjoyed this beer, and it is a wonderful representation of the style. I should not have put off trying this beer for so long. I highly recommend trying it out. I will be picking more bottles of this up."

"I tried this beer once several years ago on a whim, just to try something different (I was amused at the name and graphic depiction of Quebec). At the time, I thought, ""this is the best beer I've ever tasted"". I have tasted many fine beers since that time, always thinking I'd find something better. I haven't yet, but I have held off a few points on the off chance that I will, someday. But if I don't, I'll still die happy."

I would recommend this beer, though personally would choose something different in the future for myself: I think Allagash Tripel and Curieux are both similar and better than La Fin Du Monde. It's a well made belgian style beer, however, and I'm very happy to have enjoyed it. I have another that I'll plan to age to see how it does."
"O- OK beer for me but not my top choice. would prefer more malt."

"A magnificent tripel, and one of my personal benchmarks of the style. I think I've had this bottle a while (in the fridge albeit), and it still drinks great. Can't help but wonder what actual cellaring would do for it. Easily classable with tripels twice the price."

"finally reviewing this one...pours an opaque and dull golden orange with a thin pillow soft layer on top this beer just looks cream already, not a lot of retention. 2nd pour: i poured it much more aggressively and it gives such a nice fluffy 2 finger head that shows great retention. the aroma is of orange peel, some hay and a slight medicinal powder. soft on the palate with oranges and citrus peel, slight lemon, yeasty, a mild sweetness with some hay characteristics everything just goes well together and precise. a little alcohol as it finishes. the mouthfeel is very creamy and it is carbonated lightly. this beer is so easy to drink and i take it for granted for sure. overall, this is the best in its style and its from canada. anytime someone says ""i don't like beer"" this is what i suggest...or arrogant bastard! last time i had this was for the rapture, idiot. unibroue makes such solid brews drink em."

" I have seen this beer on the shelf at my local grocery store for sometime now. Judging by the strange name and label, I dismissed it in the past. It had a price of $7.50 for the 750ml bottle. I was in the mood for something different with a high ABV(had a bad day). I held it up to the light and to my surprise I saw a nice cloudy haze with a decent amount of sediment on the bottom. Poured it into my trusty DFH pint glass. The color was a bright orange-yellow with a one finger head. It aroma was glorious, with citrus, clove, and the obvious high ABV. The first sip was a revelation. I am a BIG hefeweisen fan, and this tripple was a close cousin. The high ABV was overshadowed by the fruit and yeast notes. This might be my new favorite brew, and that is saying alot. It turned my bad day around 180 degrees. Prost!"

"Overall, this is a great beer that betrays its alcohol content. I could not tell it was 9% ABV, but it is still not a session beer. Truly, it is worth trying. I'll have this in my fridge again."
""
"Dr: Very drinkable, especially for the high ABV - which doesn't come through. I'd like to try it aged, but I don't know that it'd be best on-draught. A nice little tripel that deserves revisiting. At $6.99, there's no reason not to age it. I just wish they'd tone that damned lemon down."

"If you consider price and availability there isn't a better tripel.

"O: Please understand that I was really impressed with Westmalle's tripel and was briefly addicted to Gnomegang (a strong pale Belgian by name, but reminiscent of a tripel). I must give props to one of the brewers that really inspired me to drink beer. Unibroue makes nothing but quality beer - Canadian, but in the Belgian style. This is a worthy tripel, nice and full, strong, and flavorful. Get one if you don't know what I'm talking about."

"One of my favorite Tripels. The wheat-like malt effortlessly blends with the yeast esters and spice to create a smooth easy drinking beer."
"not that this beer needs more good press, but it is quite representative of the style. golden colored tripel with noticeable Belgian yeasty esters on the nose. mouthfeel is light, with a touch of creaminess on the end. lots of fruit qualities waft up when the beer is consumed and seem to linger in its long finish."
"O - Excellent beer and a treat to enjoy. A great Tripel. The sweetness and bready flavors are outstanding and well balanced. The high ABV is only noticeable after finishing your second glass! Would highly recommend"
"O: The only reason I bought this was because it was on the top 100 and I wanted to try a tripple. I was not impressed and I am surprised it was on the list to begin with."
"O: There's a reason why this is cult status at this point. Very easy to drink and well made."
"O: Wow – this brew kicks some ass. Definitely a sipper at 9% abv"
"This is a well balanced, rather complicated tripel. The flavors mesh well though the coriander can be overwhelming at times. Overall, though this is a great example of the style."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet, best before 2-8-14 date on the back. This pours a nice hazy light golden color with a decent white head which quickly dissipates. Smells of cloves, banana, coriander, malts, very nice. Feel is medium with high carbonation. The tastes are many of the same spices and malts with a nice dry finish, this beer is excellent and meets expectations."
"Overall: A wonderful beer. Flavorful, complex, easy to drink. It doesn't get much better than this."
"O - A nice belgian tripel."
"Overall a delicious beer."
"I always have a stash of 750ml bottles around for consumption."
"Phenomenal beer full of flavor. Large chewy full carbonated body. My perfect non-stout morning beer with to sit around and be lazy watching college football/basketball (go jayhawks)"
"O - Excellent tripel with ABV very well hidden. I would highly recommend it or drink again."
"Drinkability – This is a good beer, but as far as tripels go, it’s not one of my favorites. Too cidery for me."
"Thank you, Canada!"
"Sweet taste too. A very well blended mix of bread, banana, even peach. A bit more carbonated than I like for a tripel. But overall an excellent example of the style."
"Tastes delicious. Balance between hops & malts. Sweet. Alcohol is completely hidden for such a high ABV. Excellent beer. Could have used a touch more zest and complexity - that's all that kept it from being a ""5"."
"--Keith"
"This is an excellent example of a tripel. I recommend it."
"O - An easy go-to beer that I've had many times. I don't buy this as often as I should, because I'm always trying new beers. After I discovered Chimay, this was kind of the ""next beer"" to continue expanding my horizons. Maybe not for ""everyone," but it should be! Highly recommended. If you know someone who loves beer and has not tried this - help them fix that situation."
"The taste does not give away at all the potency of this brew. Very smooth taste, with little or no strong alcohol aftertaste. One of the few brews worth a perfect rating."
"this is one of my favorite beers"
"The carbonation is pretty strong on this one. The whole bouquet of flavors really sits on the palette. The body is pretty light and the finish is super smooth."
"O - Not for me."
"O- Best triple to date! need to try more offerings from this brewery"
"Overall: a truly unique and complex brew.. La Fin Du Monde goes down as one of my favorite tripels of all time."
"O - Alcoholic but smooth for 9% abv. Overall, a delicate but powerful tripel."
"This brew poured out as a hazy yellow color with a billowing white head on top. The foam leaves some scattered lacing on the glass with each sip. The smell of the beer is a little citrusy and has some sweet grainy aromas too in there. The beer smells refreshing, very lively. The taste of the beer was a little spicy, a little fruity and had a nice amount of bready yeast in there too. The mouthfeel was smooth and rather easy to drink, even for a strong brew like this one. Overall it's a damn good brew and I would enjoy this one again someday for sure."
"Overall (4.5) - I was hoping for more head (especially from a Tripel in a Tulip glass) and the aromas seemed to dissipate too quickly, especially compared to the fantastic, lingering and complex mouthfeel and taste of the beer itself. This is a fantastic tripel and one of my second or third favorites in the style. Very much worth picking up a bottle (or two) to savor."
"O: A great beer that I will definitely be drinking again in the future. Seriously, if you were like me and passed on this beer in the past, next time grab a bottle, maybe two!"
"O - A good brew. Characteristics of the yeast rule the taste and nose, this fits the bill when I feel like a solid Belgian style."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer that does so much, but can be enjoyed even in spite of its complexity. Without thinking, it just tastes so good. With thinking, there is a lot to appreciate."
"O - Excellent beer. Well balanced crispy-creamy beer. High in alcohol that makes this beer even more interesting. Floral, spicy, fruity, but a kick of nuts!"
"Poured into snifter this beer a bit hazy, golden straw color with a moderate white head that quickly diminished into a thin skim. The aroma is a wonderfully inviting complex mix of spicy phenols, banana, bubble gum, and sweetness. The flavor is much like the nose, delivered with a firm prick of carbonation. A mix of spicy, peppery phenols and fruity esters, the beer finishes dry and flavor lingers nicely. The body is medium and carbonation appropriately high. Overall fantastic, enough said."
"O: A fantastic Triple to be sure. This beer has great characteristics and may be the best non-Belgian Triple there is."
"O: Wonderful. My first tasting of La Fin du Monde (as well as my first review). I think I've found a new favorite."
"O: what can I say, this is an excellent beer that is best enjoyed by drinking very slowly as it is on the strong side (sipping beer I guess). It's definitely a quality product that shines in its complex aroma and taste. A must try for all the beer lovers out there."
"O: An awesome beer. I like the complexity of the flavors and the awesome nose. It is a sipper, but it remains drinkable and doesn’t exhaust my palate. A beer like this cannot be easy to make, but I'm glad someone has figured it out!"
"Overall: Smooth, regal sipping beer. Take your time, like it's the end of the world. Unibroue puts a lot of pride in every batch. Can't wait to try more of their offerings."
"Definitely don't have to be a snob to enjoy this. I bet my bigbeer-drinking family would instantly enjoy this too."
"12 oz bottle. In my opinion Unibroue is one of the top 10 breweries in North America. This beer is bears this out. It pours a very cloudy pale orange body. Cloudier, of course, if the yeast from the bottle is added, but I prefer the beer without the conditioning yeast. Fruity and yeasty aroma with lots of wheat, bubblegum, alcohol, and pepper. Intense fruity and alcoholic flavors over sweet malt, spices and yeast. Mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy in consistency. Intense fizzy classic Unibroue style carbonation. A very nice beer. The flavor and consistency is always high."
"97."
"M: soft and pillowy"
"I have also aged this for one and two years, and the complexity in fruits and malts develops further, becoming even more interesting. A world class beer."
"Overall: This is a good beer. To me it tastes like a really good wheat beer, with fruity notes, and a malty finish that lingers for a good time. Worth seeking out, and I probably will be trying this one again."
"O: Other than mediocre appearance and some evidence of alcohol, La Fin du Monde strikes me as a great interpretation of a Tripel. "
"O: This is probably my new favorite tripel. Very light, refreshing, crisp, and clean. Excellent."
"O: Very strong beer that is a tad too sweet for my tastes. Also has some taste that I can’t really describe, kind of like Saison style beer that is off putting to me. I would have it with a dessert if I were to have it again."
"O - Dangerously drinkable at 9%"
"O - Good beer but not one of my favorites."
"Overall great, perfect example of a Belgian tripel, but a bit hot."
"D - A well rounded brew. Good example of the style, the taste is excellent. This is a perfect sipping beer. Although the drinkability is nice, the alcohol is present and will sneak up on you fast. Just another impressive offering from Unibroue."
"Overall: A great tasting and complex brew that has a great balance of sweet fruits and spices."
"O- Nice example of a Belgian Tripel, very refreshing on a hot day"
"Overall Impression: This had a complex fruitiness to it, and seemed to fit the tripel style nicely. It was pretty drinkable despite the high ABV, which was only noticeable in the warmth of the finish. Overall, I thought this was a good, complex, Belgian style beer. However, while I appreciate Belgians, they’re not my favorite style, but if you’re a fan of the style, you’ll really like this beer."
"O- I've had this beer many, many times, and it never disappoints. It is widely available, not overly expensive, perfect by itself or with food, and for my money is better than the Belgian forerunners of the style (Tripel Karmeliet, St. Bernadus Tripel, Chimay), and it isn't often (in fact it is damn rare) for a North American brewery to pull of an Abbey style like this. I like tripels quite a bit, and this is easily my favorite. The praise this beer gets is well earned. Due to all of that, and trying to judge for style, I don't know how to not give it a 5 overall."
"O: a fabulous rendition of the Belgian Tripel, and one that I will definitely seek out again."
"O - A great beer in all catergories. If this had a lower abv, I would drink it constantly."
"O- This has become a favorite of mine now that I know my local store sells it for $2 less than Delirium Tremens. I'll be reaching for this one on a weekly basis!"
"O: An enjoyable lighter beer with plenty of Belgian character and phenolic notes with some softer hints at sweet fruit."
"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a nice creamy white head. The head is almost mousse-like which makes me happy. Stone fruit aromas with lots of other ester and banana aromas and some spicy phenolic notes. There is a lot going on here. A little spicy on the palate with a bit of warming alcohol behind that. A nice medium body with a really creamy mouthfeel from the very tightly bound carbonation. Long finish with that characteristic stale (read; subtle) hop finish that I look for in a Belgian beer. This is a delicious beer that I haven't had in a few years and almost forgot how much I like it. Especially when you consider that the Unibroue beers are generally pretty well priced when compared with a lot of American Belgian-style beers this might make it's way into my regular rotation."
"O- This is my first Unibroue beer and one of the better tripels I have gotten to try. They aren't really my style and I like this anyway. I'm definitely looking forward to trying the others from the taster pack."
"O- Who doesn't love this one? It's a near perfect example from one of North Americas best brewers. I love how they stay true to the roots of this fantastic Tripel, while adding a riff or two of their own."
"La Fin Du Monde pours a darkened goldenrod, almost 100% opaque. The pure white head only rises up to about a finger and a half in height, before very slowly collapsing down on itself. Lacing is a bit of a disappointment though. The nose is absolutely textbook tripel. It's redolent of apples and pears and white pepper and clove, all in relatively equal mesasure. The flavor is, quite simply, perfection as far as a tripel goes. There's a pale fruit sweetness (but not too sweet) to kick things off, and it's where the apples and pears from the aroma come in. The pepper and clove yeast phenols come in for the second half of each sip, and it's all held together by a subtle, warming, and pleasant touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is just a touch off to me. I don't know if the body's coming across as too heavy, or the carbonation as too low, but the result is a mouthfeel that's not quite as light and bubbly as the best brewed Belgians. La Fin Du Monde is possibly the best tasting tripel I've ever had, but some of the odds and ends (looks and mouthfeel) just don't quite live up to the same level."
"overall: prime example of the tripel style, highly acclaimed for good reason, very complex yet grounded, very drinkable."
"Prosit!"
"Cloudy golden color with thick bubbly head. Doesn't retain well. The aroma of the spicy Belgian yeast and sweet malt hit me as soon as I cracked the bottle and is magnificent! Taste is very balanced and compares favorably to some Belgians I've had... Mild fruit esters compliment the sweet, creamy malt. Slightly dry finish. Mild pepper notes. Mouthfeel is luxuorious and carbonation is medium to high, standard for the tripel style. Overall this is the best Canadian beer I've ever had and the subsequently the best from Unibroue!"
"O: A fantastic beer, and a classic in the style for sure. Dangerously drinkable for being 9%, but probably not a beer I want to have multiple of in a night. A nice sipping beer or one to pair with a meal."
"O: A great triple. Great for the style."
"Overall, solid tripel."
"If you are from Belgium and speak Dutch, op uw gezondheid! If you speak Francois, a votre sante! And for you lazy buggers, gosh darn you get on my nerves sometimes... it's Cheers! Or as O!Red likes to say, Raise your glass! I'd Tap That!"
"Drinkable yes but alot going on here with the spice, malts and alcohol."
"Enjoy, all Unibroue beers should be tried at least twice."
"O: Delicious beer. Very enjoyable to drink."
"This is one of my favorite beers to beer. It's spiciness is perfect for a cold winter night, but it is still crisp so it is refreshing enough for a scorching summer night. I recently was served this at a beer tasting and it was good even in a little 3oz. glasss, and stood up to the other beers on the menu."
"Overall, a tremendously good beer. I remember while I was a university student in Montreal people used to talk about how terrible this beer was (not 'la terrible'!). Neither I nor any of my friends knew anything about beer at the time. Can't believe what I was missing out on those years!"
"O: This has always been one of my favorite Tripels. The flavors are robust and complex with no hint of the 9% abv. FLAVOR is the key to this one. It's PACKED with FLAVOR! This is not a gateway beer and is meant for the more seasoned beer drinker."
"O: Overall, fantastic. It is the best example of one of my favorite styles, and all-in-all, one of a handful of my all time favorite beers. This is why I love craft beer."
"Overall, I was incredibly impressed with this juicy and delicious beer. And it's always nice to have one of those eureka moments when it dawns on you that you're smelling something so ludicrously awesome as Captain Crunch in a beer."
"O- A fantastic tripel, and an amazing beer all around. Also, a fair amount cheaper than an actual Belgian tripel import (about half as expensive at my local store). This one lives up to the hype and is extraordinarily good."
"Overall--I again cannot emphasize enough how refreshing this beer is, given the strength and style. This beer is absolutely exceptional. The only things that I can think to improve upon would be simply matters of personal taste. As far as that goes, I like a tripel with a very strong spice presence in the nose, which is a tad lacking here, but again that is no reflection upon this beer, but my own personal taste. This beer is an absolute must-try. Nearly perfect."
"Overall - Great tripel. I would love to see a bit more complexity and less carbonation, but a great go-to tripel."
"O - Given that a six pack is down the street and fairly priced, this is a beer I will have the pleasure of tasting many, many more times. A superb tripel."
"overall great triple - very enjoyable."
"O: A delicious beer. I haven't had a good belgian style in a while, and this was the perfect beer to fill the void. Everyone needs to try this beer. My favorite for the style, hands down"
"DRINK (4/5) super tasty and very drinkable - its dangerous because of it."
"O - A very impressive Tripel, no doubt about it. The alcohol is hidden wonderfully and all the fruit going on with this beer is refreshing and just plain excellent. Worthy of the high praise and would buy again for sure."
"overall: i love this beer. it emulates a duvel, at a relatively more modest price point and with an infinitely broader availability. its around enough to encourage you to drink it willy nilly, but it will catch up to you, i've met weaker wines than this strong boy. perfect when you want one before bed, or something to stand up to a steak. or even a cigar. njoy!"
"Overall, this is one of the best belgians I've ever had. It is frickin beautiful. Stellar example of this style."
"I was lucky enough to find a great bottle list of Belgian styled beers at a french restaurant. I had this paired with some garlic and scallion muscles and it was perfect. I couldn't have asked for more."
"O: I have had this beer quite a few times (it is one of my favorites), and I was shocked to see that I had not rated it. This is an amazing beer that defines rather than represents a Tripel. It has a great color and a large head, wonderful complex aromas and flavors, nice body, and balanced use of alcohol. I really enjoy the earthy flavors that add another dimension to this brew. It is called world class, and it deserves that title."
"Overall - I'll be drinking more of these."
"Pours out a light gold color, slightly hazy texture, with a light head, maybe a half finger. Pretty good head retention as well. Smell is very light, some minor hint of floral hops and light malts. Taste has some light malt sweetness and finishes with a hint of hop bite. Mouthfeel has a comfortable thickness to it, slightly reminiscent of the texture of a light hefeweissen. Overall, a very refreshing beer without the overpowering ""Belgian funk"" that one gets with the Belgian yeasts. Also hides the higher ABV% well. Definitely a ""must try", and one I would drink again, as well as getting to share with others."
"canadian brewery making belguin beer. To me that's a little weird, however canada is putting out some really awesome beers. I could pay a few dollars more and get a truth belguin beer. This is still a great beer. This will be the first and the last i will buy this beer. Not bad. I am kind of impressed. It has no business being with all the rest of the belguin beers. If you want a true Belguin beer please make sure you are reading the bottle. Cheers!"
"Overall - I wanted to like this beer more - I was very excited at the appearance and the smell, and while I liked the taste, it just didn't come together for me personally. It was like shifting 3 different gears - sweet fruits, floral meadows, then booze. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good beer, and we all have our personal preferences. Try this and see if you like it, there are many excellent reviews on this site for this beer. This beer reminded me alot of Sam Adams Imperial White actually."
"O - Overall, great. This has been one of my favorite beers for years. While I don't think it is easy enough to be as popular to drink as Guiness, I think it has a perfectly balanced flavor, at least for my tastes."
"poured into a tulip glass, color is a hazy straw color. Initiaal glass had 3 fingers worth of white head that faded quickly and left little behind. 2nd pour was less frothy. As said very little alcohol presence, until feeling it later on. Decent to high carbonation, big mouthfeel. Belgian yeast, bananas and bready malt are aromsa out of the glass. while cold, spice and bitterness is tasted immediately, but as the beer warms up, those traits fade away slightly. Excellent triple and very easy drinking."
"Overall this is a top notch tripel, very enjoyable and another good beer from Unibroue. Drink with caution, the 9% ABV does sneak up on you and will not care if it is ""The end of the world""."
"O: awesome beer, very nice flavors, well hidden alcohol"
"overall - when i go back to quebec, which im sure i will, this can be a go to drink. i remember it being ridiculously cheap there, too (i was poor theres no way i wouldve bought it otherwise)"
"Overall: This is an easy drinking, very complex and transcendent beer with many subtle characteristics that come together very nicely to form a smooth, clean, dry and fresh ale. This is one of my favorite styles and easily one of my favorite beers. A must try for the golden ale lovers!"
"O - Very solid Tripel. Very refreshing and just plain delicious."
"This beer pours a hazy yellowish color with a foam white head and looks a little bit creamy. It smells of sugar, yeast, cloves, and a bit of fruit. The taste is quite sweet and easy to get down, and the 9% is pretty well hidden. I drank quite a bit of this and got fairly drunk as I didn't feel the alcohol until it was too late. An accessible beer that is a great example of the style."
"O - Overall there is not much to set this beer apart from other beers out there. The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is very drinkable and smooth on the palate. There is some hop bite near the end of the sip that makes a little less enjoyable for me, but overall it is an above average beer."
"Overall, an outstanding version of the style. This beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods, strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. Just a world-class beer that I think anyone would enjoy."
"Overall - this is just a phenomenal beer that really gives a delicious yeasty and fruity flavor, but yet has some complexities that I will have to try it many more times to decipher it all. An amazing beer, a pleasure to drink."
"Why did I wait to try this? Pours a hazy, cloudy golden yellow, shiny white head that fades fast. Can smell the yeast in this beer from across the room. Huge. Taste: Yeast comes first, candy sugars. malt backbone is there. Balanced and drinkable. Mouthfeel was smooth, palate agreeable. Overall, best Tripel I think I've had."
"O: As I said: One of my favorite Belgian style beers. Infinitely drinkable, it balances all the flavors nicely and not only keeps the 9% alcohol from overpowering the taste of the other elements, but actually incorporates it into the balance. Really a great beer, worth going well out of your way for."
"Overall delicious beer. Definitely coming back for more and more of this. Highly recommended"
"Pours the perfect picture of a Belgian Tripel. Hazy, glowing golden yellow with a constantly effervescing, incredibly persistent and creamy white head. Aroma of light, sweet grains, esters of lemon zest and a hit of barnyard funk. Flavors of creamy, light grain with an ever increasing honey sweetness that tails off into a lemon zest, and earthy and slightly alcoholic finish. Highly carbonated, creamy and palate clinging with a persistent aftertaste. Fabulous!"
"O: I purchased this one after my last try of a tripel when I saw that this was the highest rated in it's style. It definitely is very good, I can't saw with certainty that it's better than all others in this style, but still very tasty. I would definitely be willing to shell out the money again to drink this one."
"O: This is a fantastic beer, the only one so far that has truly lived up to its hype. It has a high abv, but you don’t really notice it until you stand up after drinking 750 mL of it."
"Still my favorite beer - love the label, love the post-liminal. (On-tap - a dream unfulfilled)"
"This beer pours a golden straw color with a bit of haze to it and a big head that lasts a little while, though i don't know if that was from the beer itself, or the fact that i was the last pour from the 750ML bottle. The smell is is wonderful with belgian yeast notes up front with the floral spiciness following and finishing with malty breadiness. the taste is very similar to the smell with a great belgian yeasty spiceness up front and a bread like sweetness to finish it off. the mouthfeel is amazing as the beer seems pretty dry at first then in the finish rounds out with a little sweetness, and nice carbonation. overall this beer is an A+"
"Overall, a great brew. Now I believe all the raving about this ale."
"Overall, this thing is fantastic. At around $12 a four pack, its real affordable as well. One of the best Tripels I've ever had, hands down."
"O: An excellent beer. Easily among my top go-to choices. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a huge favor and buy a 750."
"Wonderfull treat Sean!"
"Overall-Just a world class beer. Perfect anytime of the year, when you just want something good. Very clean beer all the way around. Unibroue continues to be one of my favorite brewerys."
"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not fundamentally opposed to Tripel's, but they're not really my first choice in beer style. However, this one is just delightful :) The color is pretty beautiful, pouring as a opaque golden color. The head was a bit foamier at first (as with all Belgians) , but it soon settled into a nice, thin, creamy blanket resting on top. At 9% the alcohol content is relatively high, but the sweet honey flavors, malts, and yeasts balance each other very well, effectively masking any overwhelming taste of alcohol. Carbonation wasn't overbearing (my usual complaint with Belgian beers). Probably the best Tripel I've ever had. Definitely worth a try, even if you're not a fan of Belgian style beer (which I'm not!)."
"pretty good light belgian. not my favorite attempt but good."
"D: Not something you'd drink every day, but I drank the entire bottle by myself without any trouble."
"This is a very solid beer, and very easy to find. Unibroue makes quality stuff."
"O – A nice, complex brew that’s easy to drink at a slow-to-moderate pace, and easy to pair with a broad range of foods. A good cocktail-party beer if you will."
"Overall: This is always a go to beer for me and I finally got around to reviewing it. This is so highly rated that I can't really add to much more to it other than; If you haven't had it before...do yourself a favor and get it. So many people can't be wrong!"
"overall, every time I try this, I remember that it is one of my favorites of any tripels out there...and from Canada no less. Unibroue consistently puts out an incredible brew that I will always seek out. And for $10 a 4-pack, I dont mind purchasing whenever I find it."
"O: Excellent beer for its style. Could see myself sitting on a deck in the summertime drinking this with friends."
"M: Light/medium-bodied, good carbonation which cleanses the palate well. The 9% ABV is almost non existent. A very easy drinking tripel."
"O: For now, I can only say I like this one - although at times, I love it. At this range of wholesome beer goodness, it's tough to decipher my feelings. But, as it stands, this is not one I’ll be talking about for a while. That being said, it’s a great example of this style, with a clear emphasis on yeast and esters. This would be the perfect introduction to someone who’s new to this type of beer, or Belgians in general."
"Less head than I had expected, but quite thick one finger float. Lace is light but clingy. Color is a slightly hazy 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intoxicating, with sweet aromas of apple, melon, grapefruit, cranberries, and malt. Taste is fruity/flowery, with flavors of apples, grapes, figs, melon, grapefruit, and warm spices. Mouthfeel is a little bit sticky, but creamy with ample amounts of carbonation. Just a bit of drying on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. The warming effect from the ample amount of alcohol sort of hits you like ever increasing waves of the ocean. One of these will give you a great buzz. A little sweet to drink them one after another, but a great beer to sip while enjoying conversation or a good movie."
"Overall, excellent."
"O: This is easily one of my favorite tripels. Unibroue most certainly makes some of the best Belgians outside of Belgium and this one is at the top of their list in my opinion. Great stuff and I enjoy one every chance I get."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a small white head that disappeared almost instantly. Yeasty aroma with lots of fruits, and a bit of spice. Bready taste, malty, light sugars, a touch of spice, fruit salad: banana, peach, pear, and a lot of sour orange and grapefruit zest, giving an instant drying effect. Medium mouthfeel, a bit syrupy, with a crisp, dry finish. Pleasantly drinkable."
"a great belgian style brew ... surprisingly from Canada .... but then again, great craft need not to be limited to Europe ...."
"This is everything I could want in a Belgian style Tripel. The funky tones of the Belgian yeast are in full force without overpowering my palate. The body is not too thin but washes down quite easily. Everything is in perfect balance."
"The cream of the crop of the unibroue beers in my opinion. 9% beast that drinks like a session beer. Wonderful white foam that pours out of the bottle and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The smell is what gets me everytime, it just smells fresh and wonderful and begs you to drink it. Still in my top 10 of all time beers, would really like to go to the brewery one day!"
"M – The mouthfeel is where I think Unibroue excels. This has a medium body with just enough carbonation to compliment the higher ABV and big malt body very well. Finish is only slightly sticky."
"A great, affordable, available, delicious tripel."
"Overall: One of the best tripels out there, especially for the price. Love it."
"D - Very drinkable. The 9% abv here is dangerous, since it is hidden so well. Everything feels very well balanced and blends together very nicely."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a bright yellow with a small white head that goes away fast. The scent is of some spicy yeast with a sweet, bready background. The taste brings out more of that sweetness and the spiciness is right there with it. The bread flavor is lying around back there but isn't as prevalent. The mouthfeel is very carbonated but it doesn't feel over the top for this beer. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and will keep it in my fridge at all times."
"Not really sure what something like this is doing at a Cinco de Mayo tasting, but I'm not gonna argue with good beers being served to me. It pours a lightly cloudy straw topped by a tall tor of stark white foam. The nose comprises black pepper, clove, banana, orange peel, wheat, and cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light candi sugar and light caramel. This added bit of sweetness and minor complexity boost really makes everything come together nicely on my tongue. The body is a hefty light (or a really light medium), with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a great beer, one of the best tripels currently on the market. Get some!"
"O- its been to long since I've had one of these. Its a classic and a damn good triple. I like it fresh and with of time some cool things start to go down."
"Golden color with nice froth. Sticky lacing is present. Aromas are bright and fruity, the yeast has done wonders for this one. Flavor is fantastic, loads of tropical fuits and lightly sweet malt. Banana, apricot, lemon, orange, angel food cake, and pancake batter on the palate. Finishes bright and crisp, excellent fine carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Overall a killer Tripel, good standby selection."
"This beer looks good smells good and has some complex flavors. Again, with the high abv and the beer itself being very smooth makes this beer very good. One I will have again, looking forward to having it on draft."
"Drinkability is dangerously high considering the ABV. Although I am rather fond of the entire Unibroue lineup, I consider this to be my favourite. Picking up a heavily disocunted six-pack makes the occasional bottle return/refund at TBS all the more worthwhile."
"Overall I will revisit this one often it could become a favorite."
"D- 4 This is a very solid offering from Unibroue. It is well-balanced, smooth, and not very heavy at all. The flavor is not my personal top choice in profile but it is good. A few of these would be certainly doable. All around, a good wheat brew worth trying for certain."
"tripels are tough to brew perfectly - the delicateness of the style leaves nothing to hide any imperfections. la fin du monde strikes the perfect balance of a subtle, but huge beer. highly recommended."
"Overall - A good beer with A LOT of flavor. Fruity and hoppy, this beer should please even the most distinguished palates."
"Overall I would not buy this beer again. It might be good on a hot humid day to quench a bout of drymouth. But for a Friday night beer I don't think so."
"O - Just brilliant. Sweet, complex, and refreshing with well-hidden booze."
"O: This is a really delicious beer. 4.5"
"Awesome beer with a smooth taste and then it kicks in. Nice buzz will start after the second beer. The great taste keeps you coming back for more. Purchased the bottles in Canada. I purchased a 6 pack but also noticed a larger bottle. I definitely will be going back to the store for that! This beer is a must try."
"A very drinkable beer, well done, but not better than the real Belgiums, like many people claim."
"Overall this is an excellent example of the style. Very easy to drink and incredibly delicious."
"o: this is an amazing beer for spring/summer. I would classify it more as an imperial hefeweizen (if that's even a style) than a triple. Serve this at your next BBQ!"
"O: Pure delight and joy. One of my favorite tripels, or favorites of any style for that matter. Ridiculously inexpensive for the quality of brew. Have been enjoying this for many years, and hope to have at least as many yet ahead."
"O: Excellent tripel, one of my favorites in the style. High drinkability for a 9% ABV beer."
"Overall: An excellent beer from our brothers from the north. I would recommend this as a nice summer beer, but beware the alcohol; it can sneak up on you."
"Poured a cloudy opaque light brown colour with a tan head. It smelled yeasty and citrusy. The taste was strongly of cloves. There were also citrus notes and peppery hops. It was somewhat sweet and had some yeasty notes. Not as overbearing as I feared from the smell. However, the clove taste was too strong to be pleasant. It was the primary character of the beer. The actual ingredient was probably coriander, I suppose, which is frequently used to flavour trippels. However, I found its overbearing character unpleasant. It didn't form a piece of the beer's character. Rather, it was probably covering many other notes it may have had."
"Very good tripel, the best i've had outside of Belgium. Just a great marriage of flavors, loved it."
"O- Quite possible the most drinkable beer I have ever had, especially for 9% ABV. This is dangerously drinkable. There are so many delicious juicy fruit flavors in this beer and at this point in my craft beer drinking time this is one of the best tasting beers and best overall beers I have ever had."
"O: I’m starting to get more into this style of beer and this was a great beer. I will definitely be buying this again. The corked bottle is also a nice touch that I enjoyed."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter. Light golden, with a finger of thin, white head that fades quickly. Aroma is citrusy (mostly orange), spicy, malty, peppery. Mouthfeel is dry, heavy. Taste is of low hops, malty, toasty, some citrus, black pepper, lemon peel. Overall, I am not a big fan of Belgian type beers, but this one passes for me."
"D/O: Very drinkable and enjoyable. Next time I’ll try for a rougher pour to create that massive head. A very nice tripel."
"O-A truly superb tripel.Extremely drinkable and satisfying on many levels."
"The flavors are bold but not overwhelming, as La Fin Du Monde would pair nicely with a number of foods. I, however, prefer to enjoy this beer by itself, so that no foreign flavors can interrupt my enjoyment."
"Poured from the 750 ml bottle a very hazy bright yellow color with a big, fluffy white head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, light malt and lemon. Medium bodied, with flavors of bread, yeast, spices and light hops. Very crisp and drinkable, the bottle went way too fast."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is what really stands out to me. It's full and syrupy, almost a custard consistency. The real accomplishment is that this doesn't detract from the drinkability or overpower any of the beer's other characteristics. Otherwise the beer is quite good but unremarkable, but the overall package delivered by the taste and mouthfeel is what makes this a great beer."
"Overall, this is a good Tripel, but very dry. I would have liked a bit more sweetness to it. There's a very nice Belgian complexity to the beer, such that I rarely find in beers made outside of Belgium."
"O- Obviously a nice brew, my personal preference is for the Don de Dieu, but this is an all round well crafted beer. Hopefully this remains unchanged for years to come."
"As a canadian I feel a little more patriotic knowing this masterpiece was brewed here."
"I really don't like this style. I like this beer about as much as others I've had. I don't get it, I don't think I want to get it."
"Pours a beautiful paler-golden color in the glass and is exceptionally cloudy. It glows in the glass. Tons of beautiful creamy white head with only a modest amount of lacing on the glass. It's very fragrant and smells sweet with some fruitiness (peach? apricot?) and spice in the scent. Drinking it makes you feel warm. You get a lot of the spices (cloves?) along with a deliciously sweet maltiness. The fruit still plays a big part in the taste, and the warmth comes from the alcohol content which is definitely more present as you swallow the beer. The beer is super creamy in your mouth. I really enjoyed this beer experience."
"The mouthfeel seems thick and creamy, yet with a decent amount of carbonation. This goes down easily, with some great flavors that make it very enjoyable to drink. Overall, a great brew, and something I'll definitely be picking up again."
"Overall- First time writing an OVERALL (section of reviewing) a beer. I would say this bottle really sells by the appearance and then being one of the easiest beers to drink, this only makes you want another one! I will be buying by the 12oz instead of the bombers so I will know how many I've had in a night! Great!"
"O: A very enjoyable beer. Not as sensational as I recall it being, but having enough definitive character to keep me interested. I love belgian beers, and while I really enjoyed it, I feel like I have had better triples..."
"Overall: Certainly an interesting beer/style. Not my favorite style, but still very good. Great looking bottle btw."
"Overall Drinkability - Very enjoyable beer. It's a tripel with an alcoholic bite that well represents the ABV."
"Drinkabilitly - Very Drinkable, I found myself sipping this beer and savoring it, instead of wanting to gulp it down. A really great Beer."
"Overall this is an excelent beer, and my second favourite from unibroue."
"O: Really a fine Tripel, among the better ones I've enjoyed... and a shame to have so often neglected this when it's so readily available... and nicely priced! A sipper at 9%. No real flaws, just a solid version of the style, start to finish."
"Overall I thought that this is an excellent tripel. It is light and refreshing and very drinkable but still has excellent aroma and taste, and if it wasn't for the abv I could drink at least a couple of bombers of this on a nice spring day."
"Overall this is a very good beer that is widely available. a great intro into a tripel for those that are newer to the style, and one I'll still come back to."
"I am not a fan of this type of beer but do appreciate that many folks like them. I had it recently at a beer tasting. The appearance was cloudy and light yellow with a big head and a lot of carbonation. Taste was typical of a fruity vegetable beer. Mouthfeel was average. Smell was definitely fruity and citrus like. Overall this is a good beer for the style and is definitely drinkable if you are the pretentious type who follows the crowds who have nothing better to drink. However, it is better than an American adjunct brew."
"M - Not thin, bubbly. Good carbonation but not overly so. Very nice feel."
"O: A very fine beer overall. This one really stands up as a true Belgian. It's the first New World produced big beer that's worthy of an Abbey/Trappist level of quality."
"Ending notes: This is a very complex, but enjoyable brew. A perfect archetype of the style. I would highly recommend this to any beer enthusiast. Once you have a sip, you want to go back for more. Phenomenal. Best tripel I have had thus far."
"Pours a hazy light golden with a thin bubbly head. Nose is phenol, spices, banana esters, sweet light fruits. Taste is balanced, Belgian yeast like flavour mingles with the banana, cloves and candied fruits. Sweet on the palatte. Medium bodied, carbonated. Strange sense of metallic notes and strong yeast flavours kind of underwhealmed me here. ABV was well hidden but felt after one serving. Not one of my favourite Canadian breweries despite its popularity down south."
"Overall: I'm fairly happy with the La Fin Du Monde and is a pretty decent (cheap) alternative to the Tripel Karmeliet. While I still prefer the Tripel, I would not mind buying another four pack of the La Fin."
"O - Outstanding Belgian. Exactly what a Tripel should be."
"Overall Grade: B+/A-"
"D - Overall the high ABV is hidden relatively well, but I struggled to get through this one. The large amount of carbonation and the metallic taste just didnt grab me"
"D - good drinkability for me - but it does sneak up on ya! IMHO - one of the best belgian styled brews (i.e., one of the best ""belgian"" beers produced outside belgium)."
"Overall, this is certainly not one of my preferred styles, but this beer is addictive, which is troublesome when I'm drinking 750 mL of 9% abv beer by myself. I may not like many tripels, but I like La Fin Du Monde."
"I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try this one, I just won't be trying it again."
"Overall, a pretty good tripel. I've yet to have a tripel that particularly impressed me but this one comes close. I can see why this is such a popular tripel. I would recommend giving it a try. Cheers!"
"I don't think I'd have more than one of these in a night, partially because of the ABV and partially because I'm not really into this. It's a decent belgian, but it just doesn't quite click with me. That being said, I can recognize it as a quality beer."
"D- ABV is very well hidden. This goes down tasty and easy. A fine example of a Tripel and one that is reasonably priced and available....last I saw was 8.99 for a 4-pack."
"D-At $7 this is really a great buy. Pretty complex and well balanced, possibly a little hot, but it blends in quite nicely. Well done Canada."
"I think everyone should enjoy the end of the world."
"D- Very drinkable. Its complexity makes me want to figure this beer out. It might take a few!"
"Overall: A fine example of a Trippel from one of my favorite breweries. A word to those that have yet to experience Unibroue in quantities would be that their beers sneak up on you. One moment you're fine and next thing you know you're no longer sober and encroaching on ""I know I won't be driving for awhile"""
"the drink ability isn't bad although its high alcohol will catch up"
"Cheers"
"This is a beer you take to a wine party and convert some folks with."
"Love this beer! Finally reviewing it. Pours a very murky golden straw color with a big white head that slowly diminishes. Scent is nice and SPICY! Tons of spices and a good amount of pepper with some yeasty notes. I also pick up some hoppiness and white grapes. Taste is OUTSTANDING, as usual. This beer is so complex and full of flavor, it's ridiculous. I get delicious yeast flavors with some fresh bread. Tons of fruit: apples, bananas, white grapes, melon, and a hint of orange. There are some tasty peppery spices along with clove and some bitter hops. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. Very complex and full-bodied. Drinkability is very high considering ABV is well hidden. One of the best tripels there are!"
"Overall: Was this one of the best beers on earth? For the sheer taste alone, it is. Everything else was good, but man, the complex taste of this tripel was out of this world (pun intended)."
"Pours a small hazy yellow color with a rocky white head. In the aroma, fruity, yeasty, and dry candy sugar. In the taste, dry candy sugar, a nice fruitiness, and a small yeast presence, but very clean. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry candy sugar in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol, and feels lighter. nice mix of fruit notes to dry yeastiness."
"Pours a golden straw yellow, cloudy, with an irrepressible head that I had to wait to die down to pour the full glass. Head slowly withdraws to one finger (where it stays), but the strings of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass persist. Smell is sweet, like champagne, citrus, or apple juice and honey, and powerfully yeasty, but a lovely combination that's quite different from most beers. Taste is delicious, again fairly sweet, but complex. Hard to describe - a lovely light combination of peppery, sweet, citrus, and mild hops. The high carbonation, which is surprisingly not disruptive, does a really interesting thing - it bounces the flavors around, making them come in bubbly waves. It's a really odd sensation, like the bubbles are alternately masking, carrying away, and returning different flavors. Mouthfeel is nice, but rather light for a tripel, and carbonated as much as it could be without being too much. Alcohol kick is absent, despite it being 9%! All in all a delicious and very enjoyable drink; a fantastic combination of taste and tactile sensation."
"D: Drinkable, but not the best in show IMO. I find other triples more to my liking. their yeast is repulsive, and this is simply another stage for them to showcase the beast."
"D-Very Drinkable. Ordered this as my last beer of the night after having 2 other sours. GGreat beer to end a night one. GOt a great triple taste but also soo crisp and light that some other tipples don't have!"
"D: For a high octane Tripel, this was damn drinkable! It's no secret that this is amongst the best in its style class in this category and I totally concur...."
"Drink- Gone before I knew it. Sneaky good. A 12oz bottle is just not enough. A very good beer that could be enjoyed over a couple bottles."
"The 9% is fairly well hidden. This is a great sipper and it really gets a lot tastier as it warms. The last swallow which included the sediment was the sweetest and tastiest of all.. I think I will pick up a few more bottles and start the cellaring again."
"The liquid was murky, golden-yellow with a pillowy, towering, white head. It smells like a bouquet of fruits, I noticed lemon, banana, orange, peach, and spices. When I took a sip I did notice some alcohol on the back of the tongue. The taste was dominated by lemon and wheat, it was a bit sour and has hints of clove. This is a full bodied beer, the soft carbonation lightens it up creating a pleasing experience. I am not big on triples or wheat beers, but this one is on another level, the alcohol is hidden extremely well and I would love to have it again."
"Pours a medium yellow w/ three finger white head that lingers a while. The smell is of pears, fruit, spice, apple. The smell is a little more tame than I was expecting. Very light and pleasant though... The taste has a little more oomph to it. It's a pretty sweet beer, but good. Not much alcohol taste, and at 9% ABV, that's impressive. I'd actually like to taste a little alcohol burn with this one. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Nice fruity, light aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty high. I could drink several of these before the alcohol would catch up, it doesn't taste like a high ABV beer. Overall, this is a good beer that borders on great. It doesn't quite reach that level, but it's close. I'd definitely buy this again, especially in the warm weather months."
"This is strong with wheat and yeast. It does a great job masking the alcohol content."
"Verdict: World class ale from Chamble, Quebec. Absolutely must find."
"D: A standby throughout the US for those who love Belgian brews, but hate the import price. Unibroue does an outstanding job of recreating the Belgian style, while keeping things affordable. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - went down smooth, was quite refreshing, could be an all day/night beer if it wasn't for the high ABV. if you use it as a session beer, do not even look at a car....it goes down so nice that you can have too much without even knowing it!"
"D: I drink this much faster than most beers of this strength! It is not overpowering or overbearing, just amazing. Very high drinkability. This is not the sort of bottle which I struggle to finish even though I respect it. It just is awesome and easy to drink at the same time."
"D'ability - A really clean tripel, with enough complexity to give it an attraction beyond the 9% ABV."
"Canada does Belgium proud with their masterful rendition of a Triple. I prefer this to many Belgian offering, as a matter of fact. The softness. The sweet warmth. The marvel. World class in my book."
"Drinkability: It's a very smoott drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall amazing beer."
"Overall- Complex but tasty. Another reason why tripels are one of my favorite styles."
"All things considered. My palate may change as it frequently does. When/If that happens I will revisit this beer."
"Super drinkable. Light crisp and refreshing yet with flavor and character. No trace of 9%."
"Inexpensive to boot and makes for great drinkability. (4, 4.5, 4,5, 4.5, 4.5)"
"Very well balanced of carbonation, and alcohol. this beer at 9% drinks unnervingly easy."
"Overall a really nice beer. It's not one you could have a bunch of and survive a night. But very tasty and would try for anyone."
"La fin du monde is an amazing beer from an excellent brewery. I also enjoyed trois pistoles and maudite."
"D: This is a great triple that packs a nice punch. Might get in trouble drinking too much of this, and you'll do it pretty easily"
"The CPJ"
"D: Very easy to drink, especially with a steak meal or seafood. high alcohol with a low alcohol taste that will get yo in trouble after a few. (I'm starting to feel a buzz already) Love this one! Recommend it to all at least once."
"Overall, this is close to, if not the best trippel out there. Very, very good beer."
"D-wow...this is dangerously drinkable. I could drink so much of this...it goes down so easily. i can't believe this is 9%! I can't wait to have this one again!"
"I have had La Fin Du Monde at least three times now. I was very excited to try it after reading all of the reviews on BA, but I found myself disappointed. I have reviewed and re-reviewed it since then. While I can understand why someone would enjoy it, this beer is simply not for me. It's too tart, too acidic, and the yeast funk is too overpowering. I think the Unibroue yeast strain works better in some of their other beers."
"side note: this was served from a 12oz. bottle with a foil wrapped crown. i used an opener to pop it and was surprised/shocked to see that it was a screw top. hmmmm."
"D: This is as close as it gets to a belgian without being one. Outstanding representation of the style."
"D - Very easy drink; nice job from the brewery north of the boarder; a world-class beer that strands on its own; one of the best Tripels I have had"
"D: Great drinker. A benchmark to measure others of this style by. It is a excellent sipper to savor."
"D - Pretty good drinkability. I probably drank it a little too fast. I found the aftertaste somewhat tasty."
"I remember buying one of these once when I was traveling on business, before I started home brewing and really getting to know craft beers. I didn't remember much about it's flavor other than that I thought it was very strange and not something I'd want to drink much of. Now I can appreciate a lot more of the style and unique flavors these Belgians have."
"Color slightly veiled, like a wheat beer but darker and supported. Bouquet of Fruits, which are identified fairly exotic mango and pineapple and honey. The mouth is a bit hoppy, with fruity notes already mentioned above but you will also savor the spices, including cilantro. Quite drinkable but with a rather peculiar aftertaste, both bitter and very malty, giving it substantial power. It recalls both the Belgian Tripel Dubbelwit that it is probably the best compromise."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Pretty good example of the style. I'm certainly not the ""be all...end all"" on this particular style, while I definitely enjoyed this beer, I wasn't completely blown away by it either."
"D- Extremely drinkable, refreshing be it summer or winter."
"Top of its class. The right yeast characteristics in the right amounts. Dry, crisp mouth feel but with a wonderful array of flavors. Solid fruit flavors, well rounded on the palate. Not much banana, which I enjoy in others, such as Merry Monks, but LFDM is truly in a league of its own. And what a bargain. Consistently pleasing - truly proof that God exists and loves us."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel snifter glass. Hazy light gold color with very lively carbonation. Initial aromas of florally citrus mixed with clove and yeast. Balanced taste that moved from sweet to lightly bitter with hints of orange, yeast and light malts. Taste lingered nicely as it coated the tongue."
"A great example of the style and one of the best beers being produced in Canada."
"Drinkability- extremely drinkable for 9.0 abv. Doesn't do a harsh number on the taste buds and is smooth from beginning to end."
"Pours hazy golden yellow. A bit of white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of yeast and herbs and spices. Tastes sweet and flouwery. Lots of yeasty tastes some light citrus and lots of light fruity flavours. Very crisp and well carbonated. Highly drinkable. Overall a tasty beer and I can see why it performs so well but not one of my favourites"
"Future outlook: I've had and enjoyed this beer many times before...just never got around to reviewing it. An excellent brew that I'm sure I will enjoy again many more times."
"Delicious, and a good choice for a Belgian-style trippel."
"Overall a great beer. No surprise from Unibroue."
"The beer has exceptional head and aroma. The taste is very pleasing considering the alcohol content since alot of beer with this high of alcohol content the taste will not be as pleasing. Go out and by this beer, amazing. I have tried many different types of beer and this one takes the cake. A+"
"D: Love this beer. Dad bought it for me at World of Beer in Lake Mary, FL, and it was love at first sip. I love the prickly sensation on the tongue and the massive amount of flavor on the palate. Easy to drink, definitely a sipper, but could drink this all night."
"Drinkability: As said above and below, this beer is dangerous. If I didn't tell someone the content of this brew and just let them enjoy the taste, they'd drink themselves into a ""I did something regrettable"" position FAST. The alcohol simply is not tasted or noted."
"drinkability; really complex but light and smooth. The alcohol is unbelievably well hidden, this is a great session drink if one likes getting drunken. Still, have some respect."
"D: This is likely as close to perfect as the style can get."
"A fantastic Tripel. Definitely of the same caliber as the Westmalle Tripel. I'll be buying more of this very soon."
"Unibroue always delivers with their beers and this may be the flagship. It's an excellent tripel that I seem to always drain much quicker than I thought I would."
"All-in-all deliciousnessisity."
"Drinkability: This brew is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is insanely masked by the great combinations of spicy and fruity flavors."
"D: This was my first and last six pack of La Fin du Monde, although I eventually came to appreciate its flavour, I just couldn't get into this beer. If you enjoy beers like Blanche de Chambly or Hacker-Pschorr, I think you would find this beer rather agreeable, but if you enjoy darker brews with smoother tastes I'd keep clear."
"Decently bodied beer that seems royal in both appearance and taste."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimple glass. Pours an orange-hay appearance, very hazy, nice small, creamy head. Inital fruity aromas, tropical fruit, pineapples, pretty yeasty. Really nice, creamy on the palate, alot of fruits, with a soft, gentle washing effect. Some sweet banana bread fights through the mangos, peaches, and spices. Very nice drinkability. Although, I prefer the Maudite."
"A generous pour into my Unibroue tulip glass produced a gloriously hazy light orange body with a bubbly white head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves a tight lace all down the glass. The smell is all about the yeast and breads. Bready yeast and lemongrass are on the mouth with a slight bitterness and spiciness to it that leaves a crisp aftertaste. Light and crisp for a 9% beer you want to session this one, but the deceptiveness of that alcohol can leave you on the floor if you aren't safe."
"a hazy yellow/orange liquid puts up a nice tight 2 finger head that tames down to a consistent ring - interesting lacing slides down the inside of the glass - a nice zesty aroma - i'm getting the clove and yeast in the nose - tastes great! and follows the nose with a fruity/spicy crisp tingle on the tongue - clean and refreshing with nice prickly carbonation - no taste of alcohol - i could sip this beer all night - the flavors shine through with every mouthful -great stuff."
"D: See mouthfeel. What can I say? This beer is perfect."
"Drinkability: Classic example of the Tripel style. My favorite Unibroue beer."
"Smooth from start to finish. Spices that blend well--cinnamon, citrus..Nice head and lacing. The taste left on your tongue after a sip is where you can pick out the individual spices."
"D= Clean and crisp very drinkable for a higher ABV nice and smooth."
"Highly, highly recommended."
"Tangy grapefruit flavors hit the mouth first, with a substantial grain presence that hints at roast caramel. A slightly sweet after bite tempers the hops as the smooth carbonation trails lingering yeast-infused esters. Altogether a pleasure to drink."
"La Fin Du Monde is an excellent Belgian-style pale, though no aspect of it is necessarily unique, save for its refined eleagance. It's a pleasure to sip and, I would surmise, be perfect on a hot summer's day.  Unfortunately, it's freezing outside right now, but the 9% is quickly making itself evident and it's certainly feeling warmer in here."
"Taste: Yeasty with orange and lemon tartness coming through in the middle. There is a slight sourness that encompasses the taste. The finish is mildly dry and malty sweet."
"Taste is predominantly citrus, but there's an overpowered peach too ... again, sadly. GOOD but not that drinkable really --rather a very sharp, strong, spicy beer that you have to be in the mood for. In an excellent value 750ml bottle, best for sharing. Personally I don't care for the slight meaty/gym-sock pungency and the sour aftertaste. But at 9%, this beer is worth consideration."
"Notes: Recommended. This is a beer to be sipped and enjoyed slowly."
"This beer looks,feels and tastes like a triple should. It is as good as it gets for a North American brewed triple. I was able to buy for $6.49 on sale- bought 2 & should have bought more since it will store just fine."
"D_Most Belgians I've had are easy drinking. This is more of a sipper."
"D - Dangerously drinkable for a 9% ABV. Subtle and complex with plenty going on to keep me interested."
"O: In my honest and humble opinion, the best tripel in the world, even better than Westmalle. Simply a treat to drink, and a steal at $6 for a 750 or $10 for a four pack of 12 oz. bottles."
"D - High ABV but totally drinkable. This is a great beer."
"Great beer. I can see why it is so highly thought of."
"The carbonation seems a little high in this bottle, but not off-putting. No real notice of the alcohol so be careful of the high abv. Great beer."
"This is a go-to, readily available beer, and I really like it, but I don't love it. Not at all sure why it rates as the best Tripel here, although it is markedly better than most US brewers' attempts at the style. Give me Westmalle or Cinq Cents any day. I need to proper reviews for those soon."
"D-made to be sipped and savored. Delicious!"
"Interesting beer...average appearance, hazey yellow with moderate but quickly disipating foam head and light carbonation. Very light smell, perhaps fruity and slightly bitter. But the taste is excellent. No extremes of hops or malts, leaning towards light dry hops, yet a definite spicey tang with citrus notes including pear. A little peppery on the tongue, but honey-sweet overall, and lightly bready. Felt slightly creamy, but lighter-bodied. Very drinkable and almost champagne-like. Yet the higher ABV does sneak up on you quickly. Enjoyed!"
"D : alcohol is present , but not overwelming"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a thick three finger frothy foamy head which gives way to some lace. The beer is non transparent. The aroma is of belgium yeast with hints of citrus, pepper, clove and other spices. The taste is of belgium yeast and sweetness. There is hints of clove and citrus along with other spices rounding out the beer. The mouthfeel is well carbonated yet slighty creamy. The drinablity is very good its well round and an easy drink. Flavor makes you want more."
"D: This beer's alcohol is VERY well hidden; dangerously unnoticeable. A pleasure to drink."
"The beer pours a very cloudy yellow with a frothy white head that disappears pretty quickly. First impression of smell was of wet socks, but then the malts and spices came through. Tastes include bananas, cloves, grass, and various herbs. A frothy and very carbonated mouthfeel gives this beer a pretty enjoyable drinkability."
"D: Any day of the year. Period."
"This is a very complex and well done beer. At first the clove and spice notes were a bit over-whelming for my liking. As it warmed though and I got further into the beer the other flavors and the overall complexity really shined."
"Drinkability: A wonderful beer. In fact, the whole line Unibroue is awesome."
"Decently drinkable tripel style beer, that doesn't finish as dry as some of its Belgian inspirations. Still an excellent beer, a beer that I've used to entice non craft beer drinkers into trying a well made beer."
"I can appreciate that certain people might find this style to be too ""strong"" for their liking, but this is truly a world-class beer. The craftsmanship required to brew something with such complexity is astounding; the diverse assortment of flavors is balanced, but each is still distinct upon tasting. I don't get a chance to try Tripels or Belgian Ales too often, so I relish the opportunity to enjoy these beers when I can. My only gripe is that hoppiness seems to be a bit restrained, but I would probably attribute this to the style."
"d. i like the complexity and diversity of flavors, but the focuses themselves are a bit too sharp for me. hard to put my finger on, but its enjoyable... all in all a fine experience."
"D - Delicious. Perfect for sipping on a cold winter afternoon."
"M & D - sweet but yet dry at the same time. Nice balance. Perfectly carbonated. Some alcohol is noticeable but it is yet still sweet. Warms me up inside after about half the bottle. Mildly sweet aftertaste that lingers a very long time."
"While I admit I am not a fan of Tripels, this may be the best of the mediocre (to me) style..."
"D: Amazing beer, my favorite triple so far! Will definitely be storing some in the cellar."
"Just from the look of La Fin Du Monde, the experience had me thinking of champagne with the foil top and the cork. It even smells a bit like champagne and sweet grapes. The color is a delightful, hazy yellow. The taste starts citrusy, then on to grapes, and finishes a bit dry with a spicy, peppery bite. The 9% ABV is present, but not overpowering. This is complex, smooth, and quite enjoyable."
"This is good shit!!!"
"D- So, this beer has a smashing score on this site... It's good, but I just can't level it to so many other things I've had in the tripel category."
"La Fin Du Monde was light gold in color and cloudy. It had a short white head that was reduced to a ring with little residual lacing. The smell was fruit, yeast and malt. The taste was fruity and sweet upfront with candi sugar, yeast flavors and spices. The finish was lingering and semi-dry. It was medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. The drinkability was good and the alcohol well hidden. This is a good Belgian ale and worth seeking out."
"A Classic."
"Very light in the mouth and full of carbonation. This is an extremely easy to drink beer that could be dangerous given how easy it is to drink. An excellent beer. I'm not sure why my expectations were not high for this beer, buy boy, this did exceed them. Very nice beer."
"Pours a hazy golden hue with a nice, foamy, white head. Aroma is yeasty and fruity, one could smell tripel. Sweet fruity flavor is upfront with a lingering dry finish. Flavorful, complex, balanced, excellent brew. So far it is probably my favorite of the Unibroue brews I've tasted."
"This beer is perfectly balanced. It is absolutely the best non-Belgian tripel I've had, and I've had quite a number of the best of this style. It's a top beer and every beer lover should try this."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, and will buy again."
"Lovely to drink. Just a hint of warming, but virtually no trace of the taste of alcohol at any point in the experience. Rich and smooth mouthfeel, a great example of how good a tripel can be."
"This beer pours a nice hazy golden color with some thick head. Strong aroma of fruit and cloves which leads to similar flavor with an additional hint of bananas. The beer is very sweet and can be overpowering if it is not your style. Smooth finish with little lingering aftertaste and pleasant mouthfeel. Good beer for warmer times of the year."
"I love this beer, but its a little pricey ($10 for a 4 pack at Whole Foods). Still, its delicious, and like nothing I have ever had before. I definitely recommend it."
"After the first tastes set in there isn't much character to it. It's a very basic but well done brew. I prefer a bit more character for this style. It will remain a once a year choice for me."
"D: overall very drinkable. The ABV is well hidden and very refreshing."
"Drinkability: Being 9% ABV, you could have a few of these but not too many. The taste is so good you could rink many but your head might not thank you in the morning. I am glad our sad state does get Unibroue, and this one is an excellent example of a Tripel."
"D/O- Hard to believe this is 9% by taste alone. Would have another but want to save it to brighten the end of another day. Loved this one."
"D - I've had this numerous times and it's always been good but not amazing. Maybe I'm missing something but I've never been able to consider this a world class beer. It's delicious, but I've most certainly had better."
" Sorry for my lack of scientific beer knowledge please see my other review for you fellow beer geeks who like discriptions in laymen's terms"
"Rock-solid art of brewing!"
"Drinkability-Extremely drinkable! 9% abv is well hidden so watch out!"
"D - Quite drinkable even with the ABV, although it does start to catch up with you after a bit. One bomber was enough for me, but was quite an enjoyable beer."
"D - Maybe had a bad bottle, but don't let the smell deter you from enjoying this beer. Goes down smooth with little effect from the alcohol content. Flavors in the beer really come out after it warms up a few degrees. Definetely not a session beer but sure to be a favorite with most everyone who appreciates a good Belgian tripel."
"A world class beer and definitely the best tripel I have ever tasted. I have had many Unibroue beers, but this one stands out!"
"Perfect beer Karma in my opinion."
"T: The spiciness of the nose comes through in the taste with a hint of alcohol. This beer masks its 9% abv very well but you can tell that it is there."
"D- A sipper, and thats not to take away from its drinkability. A sipper to savor the great taste and complexity. I can see why this is so highly rated. A plus is that this is very easy to find, and its actually a quite cheaper then most other Tripel's out there."
"12oz. Bottle poured into a wide pint mug. Wonderful color of orange, smelling of wheat, citrus and a bit of spice. Definitely a top five or ten beer for me. The head dissipates fairly quickly. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth and very drinkable for the abv. I've exposed many a Blue Moon honk to this wonderful beer, I say that because that's what most tell me when I have them taste La Fin Du Monde. No orange needed, the wonderful all natural citrus taste comes standard."
"It's a dark golden color with a boat load of white foamy head that doesn't die easily. It's rather cloudy, and this one had a few chunks of dark sediment that my first one didn't. The aroma is mostly fruit with a bit of wheat. The flavor just blew me away. A bit of wheat, then lemon, orange, cloves, spices. A rather complex mix that are strong and plentiful. It knocks your taste buds out and makes you ask for seconds. It finishes just a tad tart but still sweet."
"D- While delicious, finishing one of these with a meal would be the most I could ask anyone."
"Time to actually review one of my favorite beers. What can be said. An incredibly complex beer that is priced well and can always be found. The mouthfeel is full with nice acidity to keep it alive. Bold dry malt right in the middle. Just a hint of the alcohol but this is so drinkable and refreshing, it could be dangerous."
"Great comfort beer."
"Drinkability: At 9%, this can really kick you if you let it. However, there are a couple of tripels I like better than this. To be fair, this is still a stellar beer."
"D: At a high ABV and a standard bottle size that's in the bomber category means I'm done after two. I could potentially drink it all night, but it's not likely."
"Overall: This is a pretty good triple. Not the best I've ever had but very enjoyable."
"D: It would be quite easy to finish off a glass (or more) very quickly, but the high alcohol content will put you down fast."
"D: Very good drinkability for being 9% and a Tripel. ABV is hidden pretty well. I wouldn't think I would like this beer this much, I was way wrong."
"D: Extremely high. Really love this beer."
"Next to Duvel this may be my favorite beer I've ever tasted. Sorry for gushing beer vets, but I feel like I've crossed some kind of threshold of flavor that I didn't know was possible for a beer."
"D- Much easier to drink than the 9% led me to anticipate. Very impressed and will buy again."
"Overall this beer has great complexity and satisfying flavors. Definitely one of my favorite and more flavorful triples around and I will most likely have it again."
"M/D: very smooth drinking brew, goes down smooth and leaves a nice lingering sweetness"
"Really, 9% ABV? This goes down so smooth, you'd never notice. Unibroue is a great brewery and is this is their pinnacle beer. It's clear, bright, sippable or drinkable straight. I woudl bribe friends to buy cases and drive them back over the border. This is a beer to seek out; it's a lot to pack into such a small bottle."
"Drinkabilty, well i'm borderline drunk and it's not all that expensive, will defs buy again"
"	Overall, what stands out most is the odorous punch to the nostrils when the bottle is first cracked, the freshness of both the aroma and the following taste, and finally the smoothness of consumption."
"Quite drinkable as the 9% is well hidden. Nice flavor and well worth a try."
"A top-notch triple. Great taste, excellent feel - something you could keep on drinking until the alcohol finally caught up with you."
"D- with no real alcohol taste or smell, this beer is highly drinkable. The flavor is outstanding, and this beer is one I could see myself having to many real quick of I'm not careful. Only thing hat would hinder it's drinkability would be the price! Where i'm at, a four pack runs about ten USD. It couldn't be more worth it though. A truly wonderful beer."
"A very nice fine beer."
"Notes - A wonderful Belgian tripel. This beer is what helped me overcome my initial distaste for Belgians, and is one that I keep coming back to time and time again."
"D-A very fine beer that is more affordable than many other triples."
"D- Creamy with a dry banana finish. Definitely can't tell its 9%. Smooth with a soft citrus finish. Dry bread with peach and banana. Sweet and bitter perfectly balanced. Very easy to drink. Will buy again."
"Nevertheless, it drinks very well and, in absence of a Hennepin Ale in my closest local grocery store, will pass for a Belgian-style ale if need be."
"D: Quite, don't even really notice the alcohol."
"Overall it was a good beer. Not quite as ""yummy"" or bold as I would like, but it's mouthfeel and drinkability is amazing."
"Overall very, very well balanced. 9% abv shows up as a nice medium warmth throughout. Good one to sit and enjoy!"
"Pours a good looking orange color with a beautiful 2 finger head that slowly dissipates. Smells of wheat, orange, and hops, with some bready undertones, along with a bit of spice. Delicious malts blend smoothly with a bit of wheat, orange, and a slight bit of hops all coming together to make this complex taste work, with a heavy aftertaste that leaves my mouth feeling dry but yearning for more. Goes down smoothly and sits just right in the stomach, it would be easy to accidentally sip on these all night."
"Picked up a 4 pack of Unibroue from Rays in Wauwatosa. La Fin Du Monde is an outstanding beer. Pours a pretty golden hazy yellow with rich white head. Easily drinkable with great tones of citrus, orange, yeast, fruits, and nice hints of alcohol. I'm looking forward to having this one again soon."
"I have experienced this beer many times before. I realized, however, that I have yet to review it. This beer really is an experience. Deliciousness. Amazing. Pours a beautiful yellow-orange color with a nice head. Smells like greatness. I know that is not that great of an adjective in terms of beer but it is the truth. Smells great, tastes great. This is one of the finest tripels outside the trappist world. Highly recommended."
"Very smooth and drinkable for the abv and over all style"
"This...beer...alas, a Belgian tripel...is so delicious. I could waste your precious time with the pedantic musings of others as to its clovey-sweet, perfectly-balanced super excellence. But there is no time for hyperbole. Time to drink, voyageurs! Time to quaff this mysterious bitch-goddess from La Belle Province! Bow to its wondrous, inexplicable enchantments! Drink it...like you know you like it!"
"D-Very smooth drinking, although the sweetness is a bit too much at times. Definitly a sipper at nine percent."
"Drinkability - I have been excited to try this beer for a long time, and it did not let me down. The beer offers a solid and well balanced taste. I am looking fwd to stocking these and enjoying them one night by the far. Great beer for great times!"
"D - There is something in this beer that does not quite make it authentic Belgian, although it's the best take on the style that you could hope for outside of Belgium. Not a patch on a Westmalle or Chimay Tripel though, as it does not have the depth in body or flavour of those beers. Not sure this should be classified as a Belgian Tripel."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/10/29/tasting-the-unibroue-la-fin-du-monde-2/"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer. The best in it's category."
"Drinkability: At 9 percent this is a dangerous beer because it drinks like a session beer but has the flavor of the tripel style."
"This is one of my most favorites from Unibroue, and with a name that translates ""The End of the World"" how could you go wrong? Everything is blended together so fantastically and each flavor compliments the next. Sophisticated in one sip and kick you in the face ballsy in the next. I love this beer."
"Alcohol is very well-hidden, and the beer is super-drinkable. If you did not read the label that this was 9% it would not be at all evident."
"D: INSANELY HIGH. This is a 5 our of 5 with out thinking twice and if there were a way to rate higher I would. I have had this beer with all walks of life and not only does everyone love it from people who want ""light"" beer to people who want ""dark"" beer, but the fact that this is 9 % abv is unreal. Not to mention that It is still very inexpensive for the quality of the product. I have never written so much in the drinkability category before but the end of the world deserves it... even if it is french canadian."
"D - Overall, this is a very tasty offering from Unibroue. I find some of the true Belgian offerings a little less harsh, but don't take that as meaning this isn't worthy. It's a very tasty tripel, I've just found some others that mask the ABV a little better. Worthy to any tripel fan, and I'm proud that a Canadian brewer is able to produce such a quality tripel."
"A fruit bouquet, with notes of spice and malt. Hazy golden appearance with a very thin head. Sweet taste with a slightly bitter finish, very slight. A full body with a clean finish, well carbonated. A very excellent beer, great balance. One of my favorite tripels."
"As mentioned above very smooth. Medium body, good carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding. You are left wanting another despite the ABV. What makes this pale ale like triple outstanding is the balance and smoothness. A top shelf brew."
"I just realized I hadn't reviewed this beer before, so here it goes. Pours a hazy pale orange colour with thick white head and lots of lacing. Smells very sweet, with some lemon and other citrus aromas and Belgian yeast. Some mild bitterness, but more sweetness in the flavour. I'm probably not doing this justice by the description, but a delicious tripel. Nice carbonation level. I have this frequently and glad I always have access to it at about $5 a bottle."
"Golden pour with a big, pillowy, white head with loads of champagne like bubbles emanating from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is a bright and delicate mix of wildflowers, orange peel, lemon zest, candi sugar, bread dough, and bubblegum esters. The taste is moderately sweet upfront but also very floral. There's some bright notes of citrus zest upfront as well. The middle is chewy and doughy with a little straw and estery notes. The finish yeasty, peppery, musty and funky in that classic Unibroue way. The alcohol is well hidden. Creamy medium body with lots of tingly carbonation."
"D- A Very nice beer to drink, I'll have to make sure I keep a few in me ""cellar"" for when I want one, the go out at the lcbo here quite often and now I can see why"
"Fantastic!"
"Overall: This is an exceptional brew. It is a very smooth, very drinkable brew. I cannot stress the drinkability on this enough! It is about as hard to down as soda and three-hundred times tastier. A great beer, all around!"
"Smooth body, slightly fizzy. It was easy to drink, but the complexity of flavors also made it easy to slowly savor."
"Overall impression: Very tasty, wish it was easier to find locally."
"It had a good mouthfeel - medium, carbonated. I am by no means a trippel connoisseur, but it was a good experience and I would definitely partake in it again."
"Yes, this is a very good and very well-crafted beer. Extremely flavoursome, but so well balanced and light enough that it's supremely drinkable. An excellent brew that I'll be sorry to see disappear."
"Overall impression: rich and tasty, this is an amazing tripel! buy a case if possible."
"D- A great beer from Unibroue. Really enjoy the yeast flavor. This is a nice full flavored beer that is easy to drink and very easy to enjoy."
"Pours a hazy pale gold with a rich snowy white head with alot of lacing. Smells like spicy sour apples. Yeasty and fruity. Taste is quite refreshing. Fruity apple in the body underpinned by sweet spicy flavors. Sour malt and yeast to finish. Smooth. And then very slowly, very subtly, the beer shifts into another gear and that dull alcohol warming comes through in the aftertaste. It's a thing of beauty. This is a gorgeous beer. A perfect sipping brew for a cold winter's evening."
"This could be dangerous! I don't feel the alcohol at all until I go to move, then the 9% slaps me up alongside the head. One of my favorite beers, just amazingly good."
"Pours a golden honey brew with a full beige creamy crown. Cloudy body, with nice carbonation. Very easy on the nose with some floral, banana, cloves and sweet malts notes, with a slight touch of alcohol. Very similar on the palate than on the nose, although the alcohol tends to come out as the brew warms up. Great drinkability and surprisingly refreshing for a 9%abv tripel."
"D- i really enjoy the style but i don't love it so matter the beer these points usually drop a bit; it's also 9%, but really well hidden"
"Bottle didn't pop when the cork was pulled yet this beer still poured an enormous head, though it pretty quickly settled down to just lace. A hazy yellow in color. Both the bouquet and taste are an explosion of intense flavors - tangy, tart, sweet, citrusy, and it has a long finish. It's like a Summer brew kicked up in every category, including the alcohol content. Top knotch."
"A great trippel available at a pretty great price for the style. Not quite as good a deal as Golden Monkey can be found for, but worth the premium."
"Any beer that tastes this good, smells this good, and has this high of an ABV, I'm down to drink. It's a great beer for conversations and relaxing. And I imagine it being a great dinner beer as well."
"Overall, it's pretty good, though definitely not my favorite tripel. Decent try, Unibroue!"
"Taste is super dry, a bit hoppy and slighty tart. It's got a really sulfury taste as well which is odd. Mouthfeel is huge and rich, very creamy."
"Overall this beer is definitely a classic and a hell of a Tripel. Revisiting this beer has reminded me that Unibroue does hold up to the great Tripels I have had in the past few years, and brings an excellent funk to the table that seems hard to find in the other examples. Literally no alcohol presence here either, making it easy to drink and enjoy. I would recommend this beer with Pad Thai, which I have paired numerous times with great success."
"d 4-4.5 dangit i was more in the mood for a deep, brooding dubbel. still, this cheerful and zippy 9% (!??) brew is amazingly well behaved for its strength. its popularity appears deserved. wow, you could hand this to someone who just finished the yardwork and he/she could probably drink it on down assuming it to be some sort of summer wheat refresher."
"D: For such a high ABV these are easy to quaff, so I would say yes on the drinkability and yes on the watch out."
"I expect more in other departments. Yet, the 9% is not noticeable at all! Amazingly done!"
"This is an easy drinker for %9 as the alcohol is well hidden. This is a good summer ale."
"I would drown myself in this beer. I could see myself skipping a meal and just drinking as many of these as I could."
"Drinkability: This beer seemed to evolve a bit throughout the drinking experience. The brightness seemed to decrease over time and the pepper flavor seemed to become more pronounced. Gave me pretty bad heartburn towards the end too."
"M/D: Good feel, a little over carbonated, pretty easy to drink, could easily drink a couple of them."
"drinkability: I could drink this beer all night but at 9% abv that may be a bad idea."
"At the end of the day I'd rather just be drinking a garden-variety amber or sour. Not sure what this beer brings to the table, honestly."
"Drinkability: Overall I liked this beer a lot. The sweetness kind of threw me a bit, but other than that no complaints. Definitely worth a try and another solid effort by Unibroue."
"D: The bomber split three ways was probably enough for me. I enjoyed it very much but the brightness and faux sweetness of the taste was pretty wearing on my palate. This will be a once in awhile treat for me."
"D: Another dangerous brew.. very tasty! I would definitely have this one again."
"Bottle pours cloudy dark golden color with white head. Aroma is yeast. Has a medium light mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Flavor is yeast. Not as strong as some of the other brews by this brewer. But it just dominates all their brews. That dark strong yeast aroma and taste is just too much for me."
"Cheers."
"At a grocery store this would often beat out a 6er at $7.99. For a Tripel craving I would have to seek out that bastard Westmalle."
"I bought four of these after I tasted my first in this review, and I plan to get 4 more. I'd dare to say this is my favorite readily available beer."
"This one, I could drink a lot of..."
"La Fin du Monde is officially a ""triple fermentation Golden Ale."" Like the best Belgian tripels, it's a strong pale ale that perfectly blends malt and hops. It's a big beer at 9% alc./vol., but not overpowering. It flavorful but not too spicy. It's certainly not the very best beer in the world, but it would be hard to find one that better incorporates all the best things about beer. ""This beer is brewed to honour of the great explorers, who believed they had reached the end of the world when they discovered America," Unibroue says on their website. One could argue that after La Fin du Monde, there's less of a need to keep searching for that desert island beer."
"D: Very easy to drink, no real indication that this is 9%. Definitely a regular go to beer for me"
"Orange-hay pour, very hazy, nice small, creamy head. Initial fruity aromas, tropical fruit, pineapples, pretty yeasty. Really nice, creamy on the palate, a lot of fruits, with a soft, gentle washing effect that I can't describe. Some sweet banana bread plays with the mangoes, peaches, and spices. Very nice, and one of the best, most accessible tripels out there."
"very nice darkish peachy hue to this beer. nice medium head of foam that quickly collapses upon itself to a fine layer. nice fruity smell mixed with a smidgen of hoppyness. very crisp fruity flavors, very tropical tasting to me. goes down the hatch with ease with a tiny bite of hops toward the end. this is a perfect summer beer for me"
"Upon opening this 750ml bottle a nice pop, on the pour a huge head and no beer in the glass. This fades to a nice small cap. Lots of carbonation. Huge smell of banana and cloves. Tastes of pear, banana, some bread and clove. Quite sweet that transitions to a medium dry finish. Just a hint of hotness once it warms up. Quite drinkable for this abv. Overall a nice beer during dinner with some fish."
"This is defiantly a great beer that I could drink a bunch more of. It is also the first Tripel I have tried so I am excited to try more and see how they compare."
"Nice thick white head. Slight fruity aroma. Easy drinker. Clove and corriander taste, Belgian yeast taste. Some citrus and bananna. Alcohol not evident. This one really goes down easy and is one of my all time favorites."
"geez any way its a good tripel not world class but decent, nothing beats a westmalle triple."
" Overall balance and tastiness keeps me wanting more and more~ I think I'll have another, GREAT STUFF!"
"It pours a single pinky full of snow white froth, excellent carbonation with hundreds of tiny bubbles floating freely as the aroma hits your nostrils with a sweet, strong, sparkling wine scent. It settles as a cloudy light amber concoction, resembling a wit, yet we all know better. A full bodied tripel with a taste almost as tempting as an authentic Trappist ale. Very sweet lacking the tang of more domestic Belgian style ales. Decently strong alcohol content, yet it barely hints wards this. Mild, not overbearing (read New Belgium Tripel), coriander flavor. Very delicious, a new favorite of mine, considering it's cost is very reasonable (6 bucks for a 750ml bottle). Will buy again, and again."
"Notes: A pretty good BSPA with a bit more of a mild flavor. Not my favorite beer, or even my favorite of the style, but it is quite a tasty beer. Definitely worth trying, and possibly worth getting again if the price is right."
"Cloudy gold in color. Nice small/tight bubbles translate in to almost a foam on the top. Very fruity smelling with a bit of tartness. As for flavor - I'm not a huge Tripel guy but this will be my ""go to"" as a change from my normal heavier beers. The taste is very complex with many malty/fruity flavors. Alcohol is dangerously hidded - you want to chug it but it'll hit you if you do. I didn't notice an alcohol flavor until I would breathe in after swallowing a mouthful. As it warms more pepper shows itself. The mouthfeel is what really gets you with this one. Very creamy feel. Great beer. You just want to keep drinking this one but have to be careful due to the 9% that I felt immediately (but didn't really taste). You have to remind yourself to slow down and really savor this one. Great beer (especially considering the price/availability)."
"This is beer is tasty and feels good going down. It hits you like a brick, so be careful as it is 9% abv. Please don't chug this beer, you will be a disgrace. It is Unibroue's best beer, although whichever one I am drinking at the time is my favorite. Definitely give this beer a try!"
"drinkability - complex and flavorful, big tripel flavor"
"Drinkabilty - Simply amazing, such a tasty, well balanced and enjoyable beer. This is my standard triple, i havent had anything yet thats its equal. Nothing about it is overpowering, you really can enjoy everything it has to offer. World class, a must try for a craft beer drinker."
"D - Great drinkability. I had a few friends who had tried this and didn't like it. Not sure what they were tasting. This is an amazing beer. For the ABV it is very drinkable. No alcohol taste or burn in the least. Balance between the malts and fruits make this a very easy drink."
"D- very drinkable"
"Pours a gold hue standard for most belgian ales/beligan style wits. Fluffy white head that dissipates after a few minutes. Sweet aroma typical for a Unibroue ale, somewhat of a honeysuckle smell. Has a semi hefe weissen unflitered look to it, with high carbonation. Sweet taste initially, with the carbonation definitely noticeable Slightly bitter and tart, defined spice and floral notes. Light citrus, perhaps a tangerine hits after the initial carbonation. A solid sipping beer, I'd rate it an A. Not mind blowing, but good for a cheaper beligan ale."
"Likely my favorite beer."
"Drinkability is great, thanks to the delectable taste and mouthfeel, which are tempered by the hefty 9% ABV. La Fin Du Monde is the beer that first got me into drinking craft and I wanted to give it justice in my review, because it is a very worthy example and is quite deserving of all the accolades. Even now, it's just as good as I remember it was the first time around. That's the mark of a great brew."
"Side note: I first tried this beer about (maybe) 10 years ago while on a ski trip in Quebec. I picked it up at a small package store just outside the tiny town of Magog. The only reason I bought it was because I like the label of the bottle. I placed this outside of my hotel balcony in the snow and drank it right from the bottle, ice cold. Immediately, this became one of my favorite beers and I did not realize it was available in my area until a few years ago."
"D- I could maybe take two of these bad boys in one sitting. The malt sweetness, combined with the distinct yeast note fills you up."
"D- One does not even perceive this as a 9% beer. Very deceptive. A very good beer that one could conceivably match with a variety of food pairings."
"D - This one is pretty drinkable at 9%, which is why I suggest you don't pound 4 packs of them on a regular basis. You can feel this stuff after one, but keep em coming for me."
"D- a nice offering. Drinks very easy. This is definitely a gateway beer. I will suggest this to my BMC schwag drinking buddies."
"D - This is good stuff. Not something I would drink regularly but certainly well enjoyed on occasion."
"This is a decent tripel but not one of the best I've had. Having just had the Westmalle tripel tonight, this doesn't quite measure up. It's really sweet and less balanced than the best in the style."
"A: Dark straw in color, initial head was hefty and rocky though it dropped relatively quickly leaving a thin layer up top - 4.00, S: Nose is quite light and fruity, alcohol is noticeable but not off-putting, some sweet bananas and frosted cereal, aroma is a touch spicy and with lots of golden apple, I get traces of a holiday fruit cake but without all the heaviness - 4.50, T: Sweet grains as well as a solid spicy hop bite, also a fair amount of candied sugar which provides a dry bite, yeasty and bready, some pear and apple as well as a touch of orange, very good flavor profile - 4.00, M: The beer is quite dry and almost creates a puckering effect, ever so slightly grainy, light bodied - 4.00, D: A very nicely crafted beer, very drinkable - 4.00"
"D - Great drinkability, could easily enjoy this all day. Unibroue crafts some very fine beer, this one being no exception. A true classic, world-class example of a Tripel."
"I've been waiting a long time to try Unibroue. This stuff was awesome. Cloudy and beautiful in the Duvel tulip. Three or four finger head which stuck around for quite awhile. Smell of bananas, other fruit and nice maltiness. The taste was super complex and delicious. Mouthfeel was medium and easily drinkable for such a strong brew. Nice!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Buy it if you see it. It is one I thoroughly enjoyed."
"Overall: very fine beer with a lot going on, kind of sweet and very warming that could sneak on yo giving you a fine buzz, would have it again without thinking."
"Drinkability: Not so good. Because of high alcohol, it seem to have some lingering sweetness from it. Though this is relatively ""dry", it's not that quaffable. It's a sipper for me."
"The ABV is somewhat high but not very noticeable. Altogether, this is a nice dry version of the tripel style that I find highly drinkable."
"Not an everyday beer but a good one to share with a friend, if you split a 750ml bottle."
"Overall, probably a very solid example of the style, but this is not a beer I return to often."
"Drink - for a 9% beer, this is scary drinkable. An amazing beer that gets the respect it deserves."
"A nice mellow drinking experince - drinkability is good."
"D: WOW this could be the end all be all to tripels a great rendition of the classic style. I find this to be both a great brew to sip anytime of the year. Could not even put the glass down, very well done. Tastes like it could use a bit of aging, but swell fresh too."
"Pours a cloudy dark straw color. Produces a big fizzy, slightly off white, head that dissipates quickly leaving little lacing. Smell is peppery and fruity. Taste is really complex between the maltiness, fruitiness, and spiciness, all of which are really well balanced with that distinctly Belgian flavor. Medium bodied with a a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol. The 9% is definitely well hidden but will sneak up on you quick. I will admit in my quest to expand my palate I have struggled with the tripel; however, brews like this help speed up the process."
"The sweetness and sour finish mask the alcohol making it very drinkable in quantity. I always look forward to this favorite tripel."
"D- Suprisingly good for the abv. Really not bad at all. I wish I had more to say about this beer!"
"D: Drink is just right. This higher then average ABV brew is well crafted. This is my second of the night."
"D - At 9%, this beer will leave you feeling good."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle dated 07-02-12. Sampled on August 5, 2010. It pours a cloudy, milky pale yellow with about a one inch silky and soft head. The aroma is bursting with yeast, malts, and grains that seem to have a wheat-like quality to them. The taste leans more on the malts, spices, and hops and less on the yeast. The alcohol is well-masked. A real good beer."
"This is my first post on beer even though over the past two summers I have tried over 100 beers (mainly this summer) I have just began drinking Belgium Ales but this is one of my favorite beers of all time. I drank it out of a Goblet and found it easily drinkable and loved the overall texture, smell, taste. I am definitely going to do this again"
"With a 9% ABV, I'd be careful about knocking down a bunch of these, especially in the 750 ml bottle size, but it's darn tasty, especially with the Italian sub I consumed with it. And now, naptime - Unibroue clearly knows what they're doing with tripels."
"D: There was a time when I considered this my absolute favorite beer. My tastes have changed, but this remains a very good beer. An excellent introduction to Trappist-style beers."
"This is a great Tripel. Though my score doesn't necessarily reflect it, I'd say that La Fin Du Monde is among my very favorite beers of the Tripel style. It is very tasty but light enough to make you drink more than you should. Definitely recommended."
"Damn good beer, one of my favorite abbey-style ales to date!"
"The taste is phenomenal. Apples, bananas, citrusy-fruit, and just a touch of bitterness. This beer is exceptional, and I could drink these all night long and still want more."
"D: At 9% abv, I expected a bit more bite. Not at all. This is one of the most refreshing beers I've had in my short journey through craft beer. Will absolutely buy again!"
"This beer poured a golden color with a nice sized head that stayed with the beer. It smelt of a typical tripel with a fair amount a spices. It tasted very strong, there was a fair amount of spies, but nothing overpowered. It was easy to drink, and had a lasting flavor. Overall a very good beer, very enjoyable."
"The body is light and airy with tons of carbonation. This is a beer that would fool most people with its easy drinkability but high ABV. An excellent tripel."
"O: Solid beer, though I was expecting it to be a little more impressive."
"Drinkability: A bit pricey for beer overall, but kind of cheap compared to most tripels, I would recommend for light food (pizza, salads, chicken dishes)"
"overall, this beer surprised me. upon pouring and smelling it, I anticipated a much rougher drinker. but after finishing most of the bottle, i wish i had another one. very good beer... and made here in the western hemisphere!"
"D - Very good beer. The bubbles just didn't stop coming! For a higher ABV, very easy to drink beer. Masked the alcohol a lot. Very much enjoyed this beer, thanks Pino!"
"Drinkability - Quite so. I'm still relatively new to this area of beer, but I know what I like. This is a very easy to drink beer that is being enjoyed on this amazingly cool summer night in Southern California. From the other tripels I have had, this one most certainly stands out as a beer that is balanced and downright quaffable for such a high ABV. Very good."
"D: One of the better tripels out there. There is nothing really wrong with this beer. Complex yet smooth flavors. Great head retention and lace. Fruity and spicy. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"D: Very drinkable, and well hidden ABV. This was a great alternative to the wine others in my group were drinking this evening. I would certainly pick it up again."
"Great Beer"
"M 0208|541Q stampped on the neck - whatever that means."
"Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. This is a beer for a night when you really want to take your time and enjoy yourself. Don't expect to chug it or take huge gulps; this is a beer that should be sipped and savored to fully appreciate its complexity. It does a great job of balancing complexity, flavor, and alcohol content (the last of which is rather hard to notice)."
"I will drink this beer anytime, anywhere. It is a masterpiece of brewing excellence. I think most beer snobs like me would agree."
"Drinkability - a truly great interpretation of a belgian tripel. The high abv accompanied with this style and the alcohol which is left in plain sight (or should I say taste) makes one bomber more than enough, but absolutely worth multiple purchases. I will be getting this again and it has definitely surpassed St. Bernardus as my favorite tripel."
"D: The alcohol is very well hidden, which makes this beer very drinkable. I will definitely be having this again as it is one of the best representations of a tripel."
"Overall this beer has great complexity and satisfying flavors. It doesn't quite live up to my favorites (St. Bernardus and Karmeliet) but I would have it again."
"Exceptional quality and highly enjoyable."
"Not to sound like a follower, but this is my favorite beer of all time. ""5's"" are supposed to be rare, well I think it is well deserved here. Been drinking it for 5 years now and haven't had anything approaching this. Oddly enough it is my favorite Belgian beer, and it's made in Canada. I don't know how they can make this beer any better. Unfortunatley I have seen this beer go from $5 to $6 to $7. I don't want to sound like a cheapskate, but I think Value needs to be part of the review process. Still, I pay it!!!!"
"D - Despite the ABV this drinks easy and seems light and refreshing for the style. One to go back to, and not too badly priced for the 12 oz bottles."
"all in all? super flavorful and really just an all-around fantastic tripel. don't be fooled by the wide availability of this one - no question this is an upper-echelon brew, one i have foolishly taken for granted."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a 4 oz. taster. The thin and quickly dissipating head may be connected to traces of soap on glass... not ideal Had two beers in a row pour thinly into it."
"D: This beer is full of flavor, alcohol, and carbonation -- putting these back would do a real number on you. For a Tripel, though, it is a real treat. I will enjoy this again for sure and would eagerly share it with friends."
"This is a great trippel. I thouroughly enjoyed it! It has a High ABV, I believe it is around 9% or so? The beer smells amazing! The color is beautiful, and it has a strong and sweet taste to it. This beer is definitely worth the price and the experience. The only downside to it is how big the bottle is. Sometimes I want just a quick beer. This is definitely a dessert beverage served best with a meal."
"All around a great beer and my favorite from Unibroue."
"Moderate in the body, it has a bit of a sticky, dry mouthfeel...which makes it extremely drinkable. All in all a very pleasurable ""Belgian"" experience."
"Bottle. Pale yellow pour with frothy white head and good lacing. Aromas of strawberries and bananas, apricot, unibroue yeast, coriander and cloves and alcohol esters. Taste is spices, apricot and alcohol flavors with banana yeast that lingers for a while. Nice full palate with appropriate carbonation. Somewhat hard to drink due to the apricot/alcool flavors."
"The bottle and style are appealing."
"Drinkability: This tripel may actually be better than most Belgian examples. A deceptively drinkable brew for its high ABV and one that, while full of flavor, could appeal to even those not as well exposed to craft beers. Highly recommended."
"Pours a pale almost orange golden colour with a thick white head. A little bit of lacing left on the glass. Smells of sweet fruit and yeast, quite lovely. Taste is incredible was overly cold when served but warms up brilliantly and only gets better as it warms. Nice mouthfeel, slightly thick all the way through. Drinks very easy for an ABV of 9. The best canadian version of the style, maybe one of the best examples of the style period. Highly recommended."
"D: Alcohol is well-concealed, the beer is delicious and drinkable. Recommended."
"D: Great drinkability. I wonder if they meant to have a dry aftertaste to make you drink more of it!"
"D - Very drinkable. Nice progression of bubbles, then flavor, then alcohol sweetness, then a wonderful finish."
"D: No way I could drink more than 2..."
"This was a very tasty beer. The flavor was good and it was very refreshing. The high alcohol was not very noticeable making it very easy to drink."
"Overall, this is only the second beer I've given all 5's to. Chimay White is one of my top 5 favorite beers and this may be a better example of the style. A serious must try."
"D: Overall a very good beer that is quite drinkable while offering complex flavors and a well hidden 9% abv."
"D- Very drinkable so beware the ABV!"
"Pours a hazy gold with a one finger white head that disappears quickly, no lacing. The scent is very yeasty along with spices and lemon zest. The taste has a strong lemon zest and hoppy flavors. The mouthfeel has a effervescent feel to it. Lots of carbonation. No alcohol presence makes this very drinkable."
"D: A smooth 9% tripel, very drinkable and could potentially get you into some trouble, but a nice solid ale."
"D- incredibly drinkable. With such a high ABV this beer is dangerous. Very well rounded and complex. World class tripel i would have to say."
"Pours a nice golden color with a haze and nice white head. The head lingers and fades into nice lacing that stays the length of the beer. Smell is wonderful citrus and spices also a hint of clove. Taste is delicous very bright floral citrus with undertones of yeast and hops, a very balanced taste not too sharp and very bright. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean not overly carbonated and not flat like some tripels. Drinkabilty is great except for the high abv but an exceptional tripel to have. Couldn't session it or it could spell trouble."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very good, lots of fruits and spices. Taste is also good, fruits, spices, hops, very complex. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"I liked this beer, citrus maybe a little too strong."
"What a great beer no matter how you have it. I've had the 750mL bottles and the 12 oz. The latter I don't think is bottle conditioned because there isn't any sediment so the flavors are clear and bright sweet and sour. In the larger bottle conditioned beer the flavors are more subtle with robust carbonation. A great beer all the way around."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, i have to remember this is a 9% beer since it doesn't have a hint of alcohol in its flavor. I could drink this all day and is by far my favorite triple yet."
"Overall: One of the most beautiful beers out there in any way."
"D: As drinkable as to be found for ABV. Flavorful, smooth and balanced without malt, yeast or hops dominating any part."
"cheers!!"
"Great Golden Triple!!"
"drinkability: the abv (9%) is the only probelm with this, otherwise I could drink it all day. long."
"A fantastic effort and my favorite from the Unibroue stable."
"drinkiability-could drink a lot of this it could sneak up on me."
"jd"
"I would not recommend this beer to most of my non-ba friends as it would simply overwhelm the uninitiated. Edging quickly toward the top of my list."
"One of the best tripel style beers out there. I put it up there with my all time favorite - Westmalle. The label boasts ""End of the World"" and I gotta say if it were coming to an end, this would be a beer I would consider going out on."
"d- a fantastic example of a Belgian Tripel for around $10/4pk. the ABV is exceptionally well masked and makes this a prime candidate for excessive consumption."
"We all have our perspective. This beer just doesn't resonate with me. I realize this is a top shelf brew for many folks, for me it is just another flawed brew that aspires to greatness. Definitely not the ""fin"" of my ""monde."" Having Quebec ties I'd like this beer to be special but for me, it's not."
"Drinkability - I never would have guessed this is 9% ABV. This beer hides its alcohol well."
"In my honest opinion, if you're talking value for your money, there are few beers in this world that can match it. The fact that it is Canadian made gives me great hope for the future of beer in my home country... world class indeed!"
"EDIT: I guess I'm not the only one who thinks the color is ""pissy", based on the review before mine. Ha! Still, not a big deal."
"I did enjoy this much more this bottle around, perhaps its the warmer season, perhaps its because last time around i was drinking many RIS, or perhaps my pallete has devoloped enough to appreciate this more, maybe all three."
"Very good, very strong."
"Price: $7.29 at D'Agostino's"
"Staggeringly drinkable. 9% ABV doesn't detract at all. Sure, I wish it fit my tastes a little bit better but deserves a wow for drinkability. It's definitely not a boring beer, which helps."
"D Very drinkable even as it warms. I like the level of carbonation."
" One of my favorite beers and to me the gold standard in Tripels. One I will seriously miss as long as I live in Australia. No longer distributed to Australia."
"D - A good Belgian triple, not my preferred style but still good."
"D - Very tasty beer that was very refreshing. Another great offering from Unibroue."
"pours a hazy orange yellow color with spare head, spare lacing, and average carbonation. harsh malt and yeast flavor with citrus, lemony hints. light body anfd thin texture. average flavor duration. very soft bitter tart finish. alcohol well hidden. thought this one would've been a lot better, must say i was pretty dissapointed with this one. not a bad brew just a dissapointment. probably wouldn't drink again."
"Extras: Combining the last sips with blue and cheddar cheese was a good idea!"
"world class tripel right here, well done (again!) Unibroue"
"D: Complex and absolutely delicious. more?!"
"D - Drinkability is great on this beer. I could drink it all night. It hides its ABV very well. Love the taste and pretty much every thing about this beer."
"I'm pretty sure that this was my first craft beer. I remember acquiring a bottle when I was 18, fresh in college, just because of the alcohol content. Well, I wasn't ready then. I remember just trying to get it down :) Times have changed, and I'm glad I can enjoy it now for all the right reasons."
"Tastes great, remarkably well combined flavors of citrus, clove like spices. Goes down really smooth, no suggestions of a 9% abv. Carbonation is right where I'd like it to be, I'd drink this almost any time of year in almost any setting."
"This may be the best Tripel I've ever had. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something both flavorful and refreshing for around $11, for a 4 pack. Those around me enjoyed this beer as well."
"Excellent beer a ""must have on hand"" year round."
"Really a fantastic beer. I can see why this is so well reviewed. Absolutely one of my favorite Belgian-style beers."
"WIFE EVEN LIKES THIS IT!"
"D. This is an easy to drink beer that is very enjoyable. Keeps you warm from the first sip. A wonderful sipper. My first Unibroue beer and one that I will buy again. Highly recommend."
"Edit: As the beer warms (and some of the carbonation dissipates), the beer becomes much more pleasurable and boozy. This only confirms that this would be splendid drawn from a cask."
"This is utterly fantastic."
"A good tripel from Canada!"
"This is just a great beer. Tons of traditional flavor characteristics for the style, and far too easy to drink."
"I've had this beer numerous times now and I always feel like I could drink several bottles in a row, though the 9% abv might make that difficult. There's really almost nothing in this beer that could be improved upon, and at less than three dollars a bottle, it's an absolute steal. A true gem of the beer world."
"A wonderful Belgian and probably my favorite from Unibroue, though the robust flavor usually leaves me satisfied at just one."
"For the price, we will enjoy this one again!"
"A very solid dopplebock. Has more on the malt side than most."
"EDIT: 750ml bottle dated on Sept 21, 2009; enjoyed on July 31, 2011. Excellent retention, good lace. Gold colour; mildly cloudy. Effervescence is high and flavours are fairly transient on the palate. Ripe pear, light green apple and some tropical fruits appear and disappear rapidly. Sweet and fruity; alcohol hides behind the scenes. Good spicing. Still exceptional. 45 4 45 45 5"
"Crisp, spicy, clean. EXCELLENT BEER that I would hightly recommend to anyone."
"D: Very drinkable, the taste and mouthfeel leave one desiring another sip. With the high ABV, the drinkability will quickly catch up to you."
"Also - Unibroue beers and great value for such high quality. At least here in Ontario. At the beer store, six pack of the stuff are no more expensive than any other premium beers, and I believe the 750ml are 5.95 (?)"
"Drinkability: For me this is an experience beer. Too strong and expensive to have all the time, but perfect with a meal (French ragout beans with couscous and goat cheese) and for savoring after the meal is done. Very nice overall."
"If comparing with another North American brewed trippel (Golden Monkey or Merry Monks come to mind), then you're going to want to limit the sample size and be sure to share. Your tasting will surely end quickly as this beer brings you back for another glass time and again and will render you incapable of taking the simplest of notes."
"D: La Fin Du Monde is the most solid offering from Unibroue's standard line up and was one of my original craft stand-bys. I remember marveling at the price ($7 for a bottle of beer?!?!), the ABV (Holy shit! This is like 2 drinks in one!) and how, after only two beers, I'd be walking crooked back to my apartment. Nowadays, after two, I just sit crooked in my house."
"Drinkability: Very strong example of a Tripel, which I could certainly have many more times. However,the body slightly misses the mark for me, and I could have used a touch more hops and a touch less clove. These are minor gripes - simply explaining why this is not my favorite for the style."
"I've had this a few times, time for a review. 12 oz bottle christens my newly purchased tulip. Pours hazy light orange, TONS of carbonation in this thing...pour this one easy, the head builds up crazy fast. Fluffy pillow of white head stays at 2 fingers for a while, a cap covers it the whole time leaving good lacing. Lots of peppery yeast and light fruits in the nose. Apple, peach, a little grassy. Definitely let this sit for a few minutes before sipping or the carbonation will kill you. The peppery yeast and spice is very up-front in the taste which may turn some people off, but I like it. Many great flavors are there such as clove, green apple, banana. A bit of a medicinal feel which seems common in tripels I've had. There is a nice subtle sugary sweetness. Booze is a little hot at first but nearly disappears after some time. Great aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, the extreme carbonation dies down after a few minutes. Like a good tripel, the alcohol is well-hidden. Very easy to drink, 12 oz is not enough, 750ml is a perfect amount for this. Good price for the quality. Excellent stuff, but I think Allagash Tripel remains my favorite for the style."
"Notes: My first tripel was Victory's Golden Monkey, which I won't ever be buying again. This is because the combination of Unibroue's availability, price, and sheer quality (a reflection of exceptional craftsmanship) cannot be overstated, and are simply unbeatable. Though I know there are probably superior Belgian Tripels out there, I also know I won't be able to help measuring other examples against this outstanding specimen."
"750mL cork and caged, best by date of 9/17/12, poured into a chalice a pale, golden straw colour, white and thin foamy head that doesn't cling well to the sides. Never ending stream of bubbles rise from the etching. Great looking brew. Smells of bananas and a bit of alcohol. Seems to have a spicy nose to it, more complexities that I can't seem to filter out. Overall, a very pleasing scent comes with this brew. Taste is great. Has that hint of banana and clove, truly appetizing. A bit of alcohol warmth follows up, but is a bit difficult to detect, possibly making this brew a dangerous one. Triple fermentation process gives this a nice tingly feel on the palate, though it is ultra smooth on the way down. This could be the End of the World, if consumed unwisely. The drinkability on this one is unbelievably high, especially for an ale of this strength. Two bottles of this wouldn't seem unreasonable, until after you finished the second. Then you may wish the world was ending. But who knows about that, I've only consumed one bottle. My world seems to be fine right about now."
"This is the first time I have ever had a Unibroue brew. I think I shall give there other selections a whirl."
"D: First Unibroue I've ever had, and this one had a lot of hype surrounding it; I'd have to say it lived up and I will gladly buy this again. Very tasty."
"Cheers!"
"I didn't know what to really expect with this one, as it is my introduction to the style, but I am blown away by it. Unbelievable beer."
"D - Moderate to low drinkability. Alcohol is pretty zingy, but the surprisingly not filling at all - against the carbonation of the beer."
"The sniffing session reveals intense and complex aromas of citruses (mainly orange), banana and bubble gum - which is not surprising as wheat is one of the principal ingredients, clove, faint pepperiness, refined sugar and perceivable alcohol. The sweet malty body with clovey phenolic character embraces intense citrusy esters which whip the palate with bites of orange, alcohol clearly shows itself, bitter ending probably due to abundance of yeast derived phenolics. The medium body is crispy but this is somehow balanced by wheaty texture of the beer that tends to create dextrinous coatings on the lips. The alcohol is a bit overpowering and somehow not well incorporated into the whole thus reducing the drinkability. A good brew nevertheless."
"A little spicy, but what I didn't enjoy the high amount of yeast in this one. Light fruit tones, and a slight bit of citrus, nothing big though. The light body made this different from most tripel's I enjoyed, but it was an overall enjoyable drink."
"D - Very drinkable and smooth with very little alcohol warmth. This is dangerously drinkable and delicious. Very nice offering."
"La Fin Du Monde is the best non-Belgian Tripel I have had to date. My first Unibroue beer and one that I will buy again. Recommended."
"M/D: Carbonation, sweetness, and thickness are all on the high end but balance each other nicely. End result is that it feels a bit foamy. Alcohol mildly apparent in the finish. Very drinkable."
"D: Well you can't drink it that fast, being a beer of bold, upfront flavors, but taken as a sipping beer, it's one you can just sit back and relax with."
"D- Easy to drink, and would be super amazing on a hot day with some light cheeses or fruits."
"This was an extremely good beer. I wish I got to drink it at home to enjoy it properly instead of being out with non craft beer drinkers. The last part of my notes says ""ABV snuck up on me"". LOL."
"Can be enjoyed strait up alone...or with anything you wish to cut with the dryness of a Tripel. To be savored, sipped. Highly recommended if you want to see what a great Tripel is all about."
"Medium/full bodied, smooth, creamy with mild carbonation."
"Big frothy white head atop a cloudy golden straw yellow out of a 750. Maybe it's just the warming weather, but I get vanilla ice cream and hints of orange sherbert right of the bat. It's also got a touch of caramel, banana, and clove. The taste is similar to the smell, only better. It was also missing the orange. Peppery and spicy vanilla followed by sweet caramel. Cloves tend to be more relevant here as well. Some warming alcohol, but the vanilla really plays well with that aspect. Very smooth and creamy. I did prefer this when it was on the cooler side, but all in all it was very good."
"Cheers!"
"The palate is surprisingly tame given how incredible the nose is. Opening with a light cracker-like sweetness with some sugar and honey, there's a delicate ripe orange character, some mild floral notes as well. Moderately yeasty, this really reminds me of rising bread. This character is especially noticeable mid-palate, along with some phenols. Spices are present as well, with a blend of clove and white pepper. Bigger in body than I like for the style (I love 'em bone dry), this beer is medium-light, with a high level of carbonation. It also doesn't seem as well-knit as it could be. The finish is quite excellent, with a touch of alcohol, fruit, spice and yeast. Very drinkable stuff, this. Also very delicate, and needs to be consumed on a clean palate."
"D: Very drinkable, but just short of absolute smoothness. High abv. is hidden extremely well, though."
"Notes: This goes down real easy for a high gravity brew. I shared this bottle with a friend and we finished it a lot faster than I expected and were kinda tipsy towards the end. Respect the brew as they say. Overall a good beer. Well balanced and tasty. Also I would suggest this as a good beer for the craft brew fan who is uninitiated into the world of Belgian style beers."
"In my top three beers of all time."
"La Fin Du Monde pours a hazy straw gold with a lively, fluffy head. The aroma is light and fruity, with plenty of yeasty phenolic character and some alcohol coming through. The flavor is sharp and sweet upfront. Lots of light, faintly tropical fruitiness. The sharp phenolic flavor sticks around and lingers in the aftertaste. Alcohol flavor comes through but it's mild for the strength. Not only is this a great beer, but I think it's the best value in Ontario."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation gives the impression that the flavors dance on the palate. Drinkability is good. Alcohol is nicely hidden for being 9 percent."
"d - A very nice tripel. Great fruity smell and taste and the high ABV doesn't affect the drinkability at all. A great beer by Unibroue that I've had many times and will surely have again."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with foil on top and freshness date on the back of the label. Golden copper color with 3 inches of head that retains very well. Scents of cloves, fresh cut apples and grapes. Lots of dry fruit flavor. Yeast esters are tastey. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Going very well with gourmet grilled cheese with basil."
"It was this orangy-yellow color, it smelled great, a sorta fruity taste. It had a big head on it. The bottle has this fancy silver foil that envelops the cap, giving this brew a regal air. I originally got this as part of their variety pack. Coulda done without that apple flavored stuff, though...."
"Pours cloudy, a gold that is slightly orange in the heart of the glass. The nice white fluffy head has very nice retention and good lacing. Strong Belgian yeast aroma. Sweet, clove, white pepper, apple and perhaps a little banana. The flavor has a surprising tart sour apple zing to it that makes this beer quite refreshing. Plenty of clove, pear and apple meld with sweet pale malt. Alcohol is perceivable, but does not take away from the beer's flavor. Flavors added by the yeast seem to be the star of the show. Medium body with ample carbonation that lends to a luxuriously effervescent mouthfeel. Finish is tart and dry. This beer is refreshing, but I would not necessarily say it is remarkably drinkable. A very well made beer, but not one of my favorites from this brewery."
"This beer poured (into a Brooklyn Brewery Tulip) a beautiful hazy yellow amber, with an amazing 3 finger width, white head. There were lots of bubbles seen and remained active for most of the beer's life. The head took quite a while to dissipate and eventually did so to a one finger width thickness. The lacing on the glass was thick and clung to the glass up until time to wash the glass. The initial smell of this brew was that of fruits, champagne and slight hint of alcohol. The initial taste was that of fruits, malt, champagne, and some possible floral notes. The beer had a light to medium body with a nice bite of the carbonation, and actually felt quite strange on the tongue (strange good, to me) even after it had been swallowed. What really knocked my socks off with this beer was its presentation and mouth feel. Absolutely fantastic beer, and one that could get none beer drinkers a second thought about the realm of craft beers. Will definitely buy this again/always be stocked with this."
"One of the best beers I have ever had, highly recommended"
"D - I feel that is has a very high drinkability which is bad because the alcohol will definitely sneak up on you and crush you. Could easily put this beer down in a few minutes, although I would recommend not too."
"La Fin Du Monde is quite simply one of the best beers ever made. I highly recommend it."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. My whole bomber was gone in about 20 minutes. Sweet and slightly spicy with a smooth finish (and a looker to boot) this is definitely a beer to try and maybe one to make your Top Whatever list if you're a big Belgian fan. Good stuff, Canada."
"Slightly sweet cakelike smell with subtle funky yeast, certainly not overpowering. Great mouthfeel, coats the palate and roof of mouth, hell I even feel it coating my teeth. The lingering taste is very nice. Seems a bit thin overall though, causing the alcohol to stand out a shade more, but very solid nonetheless."
"Overall, I like this beer. It's a challenge to describe, so it gets bonus points for confounding the senses. The high abv% shouldn't turn anyone off, as it is very well balanced with flavors."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and luscious, not thick or syrupy. Very refreshing, fluffy and velvety on the palette."
"Glad to have these readibly available in my area!"
"Verdict: A thoroughly satisfying experience, La Fin du Monde is complex, delicate, and well balanced. Who knew the Canadians were crafting such great Belgian beers this whole time?"
"Pours a light-yellow cider color with a very healthy foamy white head. Aroma has a mix of apple, some citrus and floral hints to it. Taste is a mix of apples, spice, and some malts. Alcohol is there also, but not too strong, which is surprising considering it's 9% ABV. Good thickness and carbonation. Definitely a drinkable beer for any occassion, but pricey."
"Overall, La Fin du Monde, is a undoubtedly a very good example of the style, but it lacks a certain something that is present in any other Belgian tripel. It's still, however, a refreshing and interesting beer that is heavy on the fruit tastes."
"Pours a cloudy yellow body, with a medium sized fizzy head. Aromas are herbal and fruity, with most of the aroma being the latter. Taste is fruity (citrus) with some subtle spicy notes. Some malt sweetness as well. Leaves a bit of a fruity aftertaste, which only left me wanting more. Cool bottle as always with Unibroue. 9% alcohol? Can't tell. Well done."
"Eh! Go Canada! Sidney Crosby! MAF!"
"Drinkability - This is also deceptively drinkable. I have to remind myself to sip it because it is in fact so light. You have to be careful, though, because it packs a hidden punch! Altogether one of my favorite beers!"
"D - Hides the alcohol pretty well, although I still feel it. This is a refreshing drink, but I still found the 25 oz serving to be pretty filling."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-Patrick"
"D- A nice drinkable beer for a strong triple, very good for the style, one 750ml bottle over an evening with friends with perfect."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Sip the goodness."
"Superb. You can stock up on this one."
"Overall one of the best Triples I had and I only had a few."
"A quality beer for sure. I had read the hype and since i'm all about Tripels now, I had to try it. Allagash's Tripel is my new favorite beer, but I wanted to see how this one stacks up. I wasn't disapointed...much. The beer looked terrific, a solid golden haze with a nice tall head and tons of lacing. Promising! Well, that faded as I smelled the beer and I must say, I couldn't stand they way this one smelled. Something was strange. It was a spicy Tripel smell, but a bit too unpleasant for me. Maybe too strong? I dunno what the problem was. The taste was outstanding, second only to Allagash's. A bit more apple in the taste in this one. I really enjoyed it and it was super drinkable. With the exception of the smell, this beer was about perfect. But because I didn't care for the smell, I gotta put his one as the 2nd best Tripel out there. Highly recommended."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I can appreciate it. It's amazing for what it is and at an excellent price point."
"Overall, this is a great tripel. Its light, sweetened taste masks the hefty alcohol."
"When I first bought this beer at the store, I thought it would have a very strong taste due to the high alchool content. WRONG! This beer is like a Leffe Blond, but 40X better! It is a bit sweet, nice smell, good carbonation! This is simply a wonderful beer to have! WARNING: Do not drink it too fast! ----I would definitely recommend this beer to a friend!"
"D=5.0 Great great beer with great carbonation. Drink 3 of these and I'd be done for sure."
"All in all, this brew disappointed me. If you like a refreshing beer comparable to sparkling water, then this is for you. If you like heavy hops or malts, then this one might not be for you. Good to try at least once to give it a chance, but otherwise, I do not recommend."
"Overall, this was amazingly drinkable, refreshing, and wonderful. A great beer!"
"Such a smooth beer, glad to have tried it; will definately try again."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. One of this beer's best attributes, in my opinion, is that there is absolutely no trace of an unpleasant aftertaste."
"J"
"Notes: This beer is world class and very accessible. One of my all time favorites."
"pours a hazy, light orange with a two finger, frothy white head with impressive lace. smells pungent and tart. fruit, ginger, cloves, and spices, especially banana. the taste is lively with champagne carbonation. coriander, sweet honey, yeasty and grainy. citrus lemon, with an amazing hop backround. One of the best belgiums i've had to date."
"An excellent Tripel, maybe one of the top 3 brewed in the world."
"Overall I LOVE this beer. I am so glad this is so widely avaliable and I can even get it at my local grocery store. I have had this many times and plan on having it many more."
"Very refreshing beer and you don't notice the 9% one bit."
"Drinkability - very easy going down for the alcohol content. You would never realize this is a 9% brew."
"Note: This beer has enough flavor to goes great with a wide range of heavier foods and is sophisticated enough to have with lighter fare as well."
"Pours a hazy and pale blonde color with a creamy two finger, white head. The aroma is very sweet and malty with estery banana scents, too. The body is creamy and flows smoothly with banana flavors backed by a semi tart maltiness. The finish fades slowly and tastes sweet. As it ends it leaves a lingering but subtle tartness."
"D – Nah. I'll pass. Give one to the Alstroms."
"M/D- Perfect amount of carbonation, overall a very good beer."
"O: good beer. Perhaps a little bit too spicy. Quite different from the Belgian Tripels I've tasted. Strong Unibroue character"
"12 oz bottle into a goblet. Bottle has a ""best by"" date of 07-09-12. Pours a rich orange color, with a moderate head, but good retention and lacing. Smells are very muted, but spicy yeast, apples, and a touch of pine are present. Tastes are spot on for a tripel, plenty of sweetness but a very good balance between hops and malt. Really not able to taste the alcohol at all, dry on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a nice creamy texture. This one is dangerous at 9% ABV, but it's one of my favorite tripels. Great beer, good price!"
"Drinkability- Lacks the complexity that would normally keep my interest."
"Very balanced and manageable 9% abv. This beer is never a bad choice."
"Drinkability: I liked this one a lot more than I was expecting. I think it was because it didn't have that strong Belgian yeast flavor. Not that I dislike that flavor, I just like when it's more mellow."
"Notes- This was my first non Belgian Tripel. Its all most perfect. It has a best by date of 12/12 so Im assuming its really fresh."
"Medium bodied, the beer is silky in the mouth and finishes with a nice bitterness. There is a lot of yeast and esters playing in the mouth. Overall a great beer and a good tripel. This is one of my standby beers, consistently wonderful."
"D- This wasn't 1 of my favorite Unibroue beers, but my palate must of changed because I'm really enjoying this one. Glad Unibroue is Canadian, great beer at a decent price."
"Tonight I saw a mixed eight pack of Unibroue ales, I will be trying them soon."
"pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a 2 finger head that recedes to a very white ring with some sticky clingy lacing..the smell is pears apples bananas and clove with some fresh bread and yeast the taste is the same lots of fruit mixed with clove and some spices some bread and malt and yeast...this is a flavorful tripel a nice example of the style and highly drinkable @ 9% ,,its one i can drink several times in a week between my other favorites"
"Defintely something I'll return to when I'm in the mood for Belgian Tripel."
"Very drinkable beer. If you like Belgians, go buy this beer, simply amazing."
"It is one of my many favorites around here in Montreal."
"Mouthfeel is slightly complex and full bodied for a Belgian Tripel. Carbonation is perfect. This beer is definitely a room temp beer. Wonderful!"
"M, D- Buttery, velvety quality makes this beer very drinkable."
"This one goes great with spicy food, and is strong enough to put a cap on consumption... Definitely falls into the buy again category. Honestly its a bit of a bargain compared to comparable Tripels from Belgium. After having most of their major products, its seems that Unibroue cranks out quality thats on par with Ommengang offerings....both offering widely available Belgian style beers, especially here in the mid-atlantic states."
"M- loose and fluffy with a slight tang on the tongue. Deff a one and done for me."
"High carbonation and noticeable alcohol assertiveness coupled with a flavor that doesn't quite hold the palate's attention leads to reduced drinkability. Personally I feel this beer would have been highly drinkable if it had a lower ABV. As it stands, this beer is a one and done either in the beginning or end of a beer series."
" This is one of the best offerings by unibroue and I feel it is a world class tripel and by far one of the breweries top offerings."
"Drinkability- It was really good. I enjoyed it immensely."
"D-First review and first time trying this style. Amazed at how the alcohol stays hidden, this is a great big beer that requires respect"
"The body is light and silky, with heavy carbonation and a lingering crispness. The light body and mouthfeel help to hide the alcohol content well."
"Pours clear yellow with a white head. The aroma is yeasty with some fruity characters. This is what I am looking for in a tripel. The taste is lots of fruit with Belgian yeast. You get a little bit of alcohol as well. The fruit is apples and white grapes as well as possibly some citrus. Thin bodied and medium to high carbonation. Finishes very dry."
"and excellent taste,and easy to drink if you like tripel"
"D: This is one of the first Tripels I've really enjoyed. Good solid Belgian yeast character and a fruitiness and sweetness that is well balanced. The only knock on the drinkability of this beer comes from the alcohol, but still easy to drink."
"I drank em out of tulips. Pours cloudy golden yellow color. Smells of belgian yeast, cloves, fruits kinda apple-ish. Feels good to the mouth with very adequate carbonation. The 9% is hidden very well, and I think keeping these has really no major positive or negatives, At least that I experienced in the 8 months. This stuff is really great and a good price, so I will most defiantly be buying again in the future."
"Overall probably the best tasting Triple I have had, this isn't my favorite style but I really enjoyed this one."
"A top-notch tripel and one of the best you're going to find outside of Belgium."
"All told, a very good beer though not my favorite Tripel."
"The feel of this beer is really light and quite enjoyable. It has a nice ammount of carbonation that is really pleasant and gives each sip a fizzieness that lightens the feel of this beer."
"Overall a true classic. A great Belgian tripel made in Canada."
"I swear the good people at Unibroue have kidnapped Trappist monks and brought them to their brewery in Quebec. They're making beers that are easily just as good, if not better in some cases, than the classic Belgian breweries."
"One of the finest brews around - very proud that this is a Canadian brew! Love having this one on hand around the house; I've got a couple in the cellar as well. Well worth a sampling!"
"A definite favorite of mine. Although I consume liquids like a fish, this brew demands respect. Drink slowly to get its full package."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a large white head and some lacing on the glass. Smells of peaches, pears, yeast, pepper, and cloves. The flavor has peaches, pears, pepper, and cloves. Mildly sweet, and easy to drink. Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation, very smooth. The 9% alcohol is well hidden."
"D-the alcohol is hidden very well and this has a sweetness after the initial yeast the is quite nice."
"D - This is a smooth beer considering the ABV. I would have given it a higher rate here, if it wasn't for the constant burping from the high carbonation."
"This tripel is probably one of the best I've had if not the best. I bought a four pack of this and didn't realize 3 were gone within a bit of time. Very drinkable."
"A very delicious Belgian style beer. I've had beers from Unibrou before and considered them just reasonably good Belgian imitations, but this is the real deal. It stands up to top shelf Belgian offerings and still remains unique."
"M/D-very light and highly carbonated body even reguardless of the abv (which is not even noted while drinking the beer) which combined with its exceptional taste makes this a highly drinkable beer"
"The beer pours to a opaque golden color. Nose is rather yeasty, I love it! The aroma has bits of fruit and a very slight spicyness. This is a very smooth drink, but rather alcoholic. It is rather good, but the only problem with it is that it is heavy and filling."
"If the End of the World ever does come I can only hope it is accompanied by copious amounts of this beer!"
"Perfume, apples, clove, maybe even vanilla. And you can't get rid of it for a little while. Sometimes, I've noticed aging the beer a year or three will make it a little less harsh in exchange for additional sweetness. I'd recommend that."
"341mL bottle poured into a La Fin Du Monde glass. Cloudy light copper color with a decent white head. Aroma of yeast, citrus, and green apples. In the taste there is more yeast, citrus, cloves, and a bit of alcohol. Really high carbonation and a dry finish. Body is maybe a little thin. Not my favorite tripel but this is still very good."
"Really great beer. Honestly I am not sure what could be better as a stylistic representation. Sublime presents itself as a good descriptor."
"Any beer drinker who enjoys fine beer would consider this, without a doubt, one of the best in the world. This, Maudite and Trois Pistoles are simply some of the best beer available in the world."
"Unibroue make a couple of Belgian beers that would make those from the native land quiver in thier boots upon tasting. This just happens to be the best of them!"
"I am looking forward to trying another one... without the unrealistic expectations"
"D - Little bitter and certainly not as sweet as many of the other Tripels I've had, but in a good way. Very drinkable and REALLY good. This is one of the better beers I've had."
"Great beer."
"Value: Awesome value. I paid $2.59 for a single and it was worth every penny. Can't wait to taste some more Unibroue brews."
"D/Overall: This truly is world-class. The bodega directly downstairs from me just started carrying this, and thank goodness for that. It'll certainly enter my regular rotation."
"D- The perfect balance of this beer makes it extremely easy to drink for a beer with a higher abv. Not favorite triple, but this is still an amazing beer."
"Color is hazy golden. Nice head that dissipates but leaves lingering lacing. The smell is great, although I'.m not sure how to describe it. Malt, citrus, tamarind. It's complex and deep. The taste is fantastic. Malt and yeast, a perfect amount of hoppy bitterness. The taste is complex and rich and remarkably balanced. The mouth feel is excellent. It's heavy and almost velvety without being cloying or thick. The alcohol asserts itself, but the beer is rich enough that it blends in. Overall, a fantastic beer. Complex, tasty, drinkable."
"i'm so glad i bought it and will be buying it again. highly recommended."
"D: I used to wonder why LfdM received the Top 100 love but no other Unibroue beers did. Now I no longer wonder. This is an outstanding tripel. The price keeps me buying other stuff, but when I'm in the mood for the style, this is where I'll go."
"D - This is a solid, reliable beer that's worth revisiting from time to time. Dangerously quaffable with its hidden alcohol of 9 percent."
"D. Very drinkable. Very smooth and refreshing. Lacks a touch of the sweetness that I prefer. I see now why this is so highly reviewed."
"drink: i wish i could get more of these easily cause this is all i would drink"
"D - Honestly, don't see what all the hype is about. Wouldn't mind having one or two but it's not something I'm going to return to or drink too much of."
"OVERALL size is not particularly evident. Pretty easy drinking. Blindfolded, one might think this was made in Belgium. Well done."
"Drinkability: Despite the high abv i could drink this all the time. perfect for all year round. Warms well too."
"D: Like any beer with complex flavors, more than a few of these would be difficult to finish. Not to mention the ABV. That being said, this is still an incredibly drinkable Tripel, and worthy to be in the same style as Westmalle and Tripel Karmeliet."
"Mouthfeel was incredibly crisp with a nice bubbly bite from the carbonation , almost champagne-like. It coated the mouth with a silky, foamy goodness. Finish was a just dry and chalky enough to keep me sippin'. Great beer, my first from Unibroue... I'll be back."
"Hands down one of the best beers I've ever had. The only brew that I have had that comes close to this is Chimay White, which still doesn't stack up. The brew pours a beautiful cloudy orange color with a very large and stable white head. The smell is typical for this type of brew with a slightly strong alcohol smell coming through. The taste and mouthfeel are at the top of the charts for any beer let alone one with 9%. Its sweet, very malty, and has a slight hop presence at the end. Finally, the drinkability is just incredible for any brew let alone one with 9%. I would highly reccommend this to anyone who wants a delicious brew to sip on and enjoy; maybe even have two."
"Overall a great beer. Instantly I was reminded of Mothership wit from New Belgium. I don't like that beer, but I know what they were trying to do now. Would buy this again for sure."
"I think this is a great beer all-around. If you see it, try it."
"A simply fantastic beer... have had it many times and it is absolutely one of my favorite beers. I would easily place it in my top 10. Pours with a fantastic off-white head. The aroma is sweet esters mixed with wonderful complex Belgian yeast. The flavor is sweet and fruity with lots of yeast characteristics. Love this stuff!"
"Thoroughly enjoyable, though probably more in moderation than in a session. Half way through a single 341ml bottle I had already begun to feel an alcohol buzz. Something for those miserable fall/winter days perhaps?"
"D- Exceptionally delicious and drinkable. None of the characteristics ever seem to become overpowering. I shall enjoy this entire bomber on my own, and would be tempted to open another!"
"This stuff is awesome, I simply love it."
"EDIT: I just ordered this at the Tap again, thinking maybe I shouldn't have given it all fives...until I drank it. I just can't find a flaw in this beer. Blows my mind every time."
"(Bottle poured into Trappist glass) Poured a beautiful golden color with small creamy head that faded fast. Aroma provided a good deal of sweet notes, most notable a strong fruit and flowery hint. Full bodied, the drink was very smooth with a very average carbonation -- there was just enough here! Overall the flavor did not disappoint in the sweet department, but it was not overly sweet. A great compliment to the hearty stew I had it with! This is one to go back to over and over again!"
"Drinkability: I tend to think of this as something that should be drank in the summer. It’s crisp and refreshing, but the yeast is at the forefront of this brew and in the end is just a bit too much. As mentioned, I’m reminded of a dry white wine which for me feels like over-fermentation which has lead to a boozy feeling. After 750mL of La Fin Du Monde I think I might have to drink some Monistat."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a pale wheat color with a clean, crisp, white head that dissipated quickly and didn't leave any lacing to speak of even with the high alcohol content. The nose is of thick floral beds, lots of clove, and sweet honey. The taste is heavy clove and warm alcohol coats your throat. There is a slight kick, but a good balance and if sipped rather than drank, it leaves a tingling sensation in your throat. This has a thin body, but moderate carbonation. This is a tasty drink, I say drink as some of these triples are more like drink rather than beer. Very fine choice!"
"Cheers y Salud!"
"Definitely a beer that I would love to get my hands on again, and something I would encourage everybody to try at least once."
"Also note: I have had this beer on tap at several bars and I have to say stick to bottle. This beer has a tendency to build up deposit in the lines and also sells slower than most taps so I have never had a completely 'sound' pour on draft."
"Drinkability: I really don't know how these Belgian style ales hide their alcohol so well. Its almost unbelievable that this is 9% abv, because it drinks like 4% or 5%. This beer is balanced yet flavourful, and goes down smooth."
"Poured a nice golden carbonated yellow into a snifter, with two fingers of bright white head, that laced very well. The smell was off the charts; cloves, allspice, coriander, banana, tart apple, pear, lime, bubble gum...and I know that I'm missing a few. Couldn't wait to start sipping, and when I did, what overwhelmed me was not all of the aforementioned flavors (and then some), but the BALANCE between all of those flavors. Furthermore, the alcohol content was not as evident as expected in the finish. The feel was nicely carbonated and medium, and when I was done with the bomber...which didn't take very long...I wish I had purchased several."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking. I love it."
"Find du monde is an interesting compromise between a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a true Tripel its as if you mixed duvel and westmalle very tasty!"
"Extremely drinkable and moreish, which is a dangerous quality in a beer of this ABV."
"I've had the Unibroue countless times, but this was the first time I've ever had the opportunity to put it up against other examples of the style. As a Canadian, I'm glad to say it held up well, and only lost my vote in its contest because the Karmeleit had slightly more complexity. The general consensus was also that the sweetness actually worked against it. On the nose, there's a wonderfully fruity and spicy aroma (which I now recognise as the house yeast strain). The initial flavour hit comes from cloves and cinnamon, but then transitions to sweet phenolic malts, that strongly emphasise apple and pear. I wish it had a slightly crisper finish, which I think would be more to style, but it's pleasant nonetheless."
"Drinkability: ok, I think the clove taste is a bit overpowering drowning out any other flavors that this one might have had so it looses drinkability there,"
"Drinkability: Good to enjoy over a period of time. Do not rush through this beer, it has a lot to offer that would be missed due to a hurried drinking."
"Poured a cloudy yellowish amber color with good carbonation and a white head. Nose is fruit, hops and belgian yeast. Taste is fruit, belgian yeast, spice and warming. I thought it was pretty good and smooth on mouthfeel and drinkability. It was warming, spicy and fruits on the mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly spiced with spritzy carbonation tickling the tongue."
"This beer is certainly different, and maybe that's why its been getting such stellar reviews. Great tasting but I just don't buy it. It doesn't seem to share the same complexities as many other top rated beers, although what flavors it has are very well balanced. Not my favorite, but definitely a quality brew."
"I'm not sure why i differ so much from everyone else, but i suppose it just happens. Ive been around the unibroue block a little bit, and i they're just not as good IMHO as other BA's say they are."
"I split a 750ml bottle with my wife. Poured carefully into large wine glasses, the beer produced a nice 3/4"" head in both glasses. The color is a pale straw and the beer is a little hazy. The smell is mild. Smells a tiny bit sweet and malty, and its got that ""Belgian"" phenol thing going, but faintly. The taste is fantastic. Up front, there's lemon, pear and yeast, and it has a nice sour middle followed by a very clean finish. The alcohol is very well hidden. This tastes like a Belgian beer without the earthy funkiness, but it is working for me in a big way. Very fresh and very clean. I wanted more when the bottle was empty."
"D- This beer is about as easy to drink as any beer i've had. I always forget how good this is."
"If the end of the world was actually coming, I would not be very happy if this was the last beer I ever had. Well done, Unibroue, you lived up to the hype."
"Easy to drink, but a real sipper. A great take on the tripel style."
"Fantastic example of the style. Skittles in a beer. Seriously, big Ivory head takes a while to dissipate leaving nice lacing in the tulip. Smells of yeast, pear, apple and banana. Hops are there but not very noticeable. Big time fruit like in the smell but with a boozy bite that brigs it together nicely. Great fluffy mouthfeel without getting foam in the mouth. Very drinkable."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice a golden yellow/orange with a quickly dissipating ivory head and little to no lacing.Smells of clove, spice,and fruit. Taste the same as the smell, sweet fruit, clove, with a semi dry finish, Just a fantastic taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and very carbonated. Drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV that is well hidden until the bottom of the glass( like I feel now drinking while reviewing). Overall a fantastic beer,although not at all like the St. Bernardus Tripel, the Corsendonk Agnus or the Chimay Tripel I have also tried."
"D: This is a very good beer, but perhaps just a bit too sweet for me to want to drink more than one. You'll probably want to sip this one and appreciate the complex fruity and spicy flavors here. Make sure not to drink it too cold or the sweetness will dominate."
"Unibroue makes a damn good tulip glass!"
"750ml bottle. Pours a orange/yellow golden clear colour. Incredibly easy to drink. This is 9%? Seriously? No hint of the alc.% at all. Very solid beer all around. Definately a fruity taste to the after taste. Very nice beer from Canada."
"D - Refreshing!"
"quality hoppy fruit aroma, nice pour, solid head that leaves its mark, slightly cloudy tanish-orange appearance, constant carbonation. Instant rush'o'strong flavor, just enough bitterness at the end to make you want more and more and more, potent shit, 9% to the face which you really cant even taste. All around great beer, wish it was more available."
"D- Outstanding. Really hides the alcohol content well, and only gets better as it goes."
"I picked up a single in a sixer mixer. Bottle to snifter. Golden brown with an off-white head and thin lacing. Congruent smell and taste--notes of young white grapefruit, a mild floral arrangement, and light hops. The mouthfeel was a smooth medium with light carbonation. Highly drinkable, definitely not abrasive considering the high ABV, and it's accessibility will allow for a pleasant return to the end of the world one day."
"Pours a cloudy golden/yellow color with a fluffy white head that fades to nothing - perhaps a slight whispiness, but no crown at all. Nose has a slight spiciness to it - reminds me of apple cider. Bit of citrus. Taste has slight spincess as well with nice fruity/floral layers. Moderate aftertaste that lingers for a bit. Mouthfeel is fairly medium with fairly mild carbonation, in my opinion. This brew kind of reminds me of chardonnay. Quite drinkable."
"Drink: Not my favorite tripel, but fairly drinkable considering the high ABV. The carbonation isn't particularly overwhelming either, a nice offering from Unibroue."
"Probably one of the better non-Belgian tripels I have had in a while, I am slowly making my way through a number of Unibroue offerings and I have yet to be disappointed."
"Overall: For someone like me, who doesn't normally appreciate this style, I was very surprised. Still I think it is overrated here on BA, and that the rates given at ratebeer.com reflect the quality of this beer much better. But again, decent brew, nice and drinkable, recommendable"
"over all this is a fantastic beer, and i recommend it to others, especially to those who want a drink that wont dropkick you in the face!"
":)"
"We shared a 750ml bottle into a maredsous chalice and a large wine goblet. Pours a delightful golden color with a quite vigorous amount of foam - very nice. The aroma, even upon warming up, was not particularly strong - some coriander and citrus but not a lot past that. The taste was also a bit of a letdown - it was very smooth but we were hoping for more belgian ester and yeast flavors."
"Overall this was a very good beer, I definitely suggest you try it! I feel that the smells and the head weren't as strong as some other folks here described, it could have been an older bottle. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the bottle, the bar tender tossed it immediately."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable; its so smooth and tasty and good you wont want to put this one down. And wow, this beer could really be dangerous! Its 9% abv and drinks like a 5. I would definitely session with this beer, but I would have to be careful of course."
"Overall: This beer reminds me of a witbier in certain aspects but the malt really puts it in it's place. It is quite light in character for a brew with such a big bodied reputation. Was quite delightful and would definitely have again."
"As i bought this beer i heard that there was a possibility that we may not see this fine brew in Western Australia again due to something with importers so its bittersweet that i get to try this fine brew again and review it and fingers crossed we do see it again,anyways it pours a cloudy honey colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with nice sporadic lacing,the aromas are wonderful so different to most other beers out there the aromas are fresh and dried fruits,baked bread,figs and even some pepperoni too quite a different smell altogether and the taste doesnt dissapoint either with tastes of bananna,dried figs,peaches,nectarines and yeasty bread very nice and the mouthfeel is very pleasant starting out full and finishing light,crisp and dry like a fine champagne with the alcohol very well hidden making this beer very easy to drink and i hope it doesnt dissapear from our shores."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy and has a dry finish."
"The key to this beer is knowing how to pour it / having the sense to not drink it straight from the bottle (but sometimes you have to do what you have to do)"
"So far this is on the top of my list!! What an incredible brew it is. If I could, I would drink it on a daily basis. I don't even get the alcohol it is masked so well... this is not a session brew!!"
"Pours a moderately carbonated hazy yellow color with a slight head. There is a nice spicy smell with a cloudy and alcoholic sweet aroma (banana maby). The best part... taste, wow more carbonated than visible and hints of lemon and spices with hops blending into a nice warming sensation of a finale. A great beer that is reminiscent slightly of champagne."
"It's hazy and the colour of sunshine. Golden and brilliant. It has a thick white head that leaves a good cap on the body after fading away a little. Good retention and nice lace. It smells of banana, cidery apple, and peppery spice. There's a boozy solvent character to it, and something vaguely suggestive of plastic, like a vinyl record. It tastes of sweet orchard and tropical fruits with some nice boozy alcohol and mild hop bitterness in the finish. The alcohol lends this beer a spicy character. The carbonation is fairly high and plays nicely with the peppery alcohol. It's so potent, but it just goes down like water - especially when it's just slightly cool. The alcohol doesn't hinder it at all in that respect. This is a 750mL bottle - when you think about it, you're really having a little more than two to begin with, and it's still going down like water towards the end. It has depth, well integrated complexity, and it's easy to drink. What's not to love?"
"Drinkability is average. A single beer of this style and strength is generally enough for me."
"D - High. This is fairly light despite being so tasty and the flavor really never gets overpowering."
"Complex and interesting - certainly a world-class tripel."
"(Tasting notes from 02 Sept 2009)"
"Just a phenomenal high ABV beer. On first impression the taste reminded me of Hoegaarden with a bigger but not obsessive alcohol back end. The wonderful/horrible thing about this beer is how easy it is to drink. It would not be hard to consume 3 or 4 with dinner. I had this beer paired with an Steak, medium rare, and it fit perfectly."
"Such as great beer. The color is a golden yellow. When poured it creates a lot of carbonation and head but quickly dissipates. The smell is mellow with hints of citrus. Taste is hard to describe except for the crispness and subtle hints of fruit and citrus. Great mouthfeel, all around anytime beer. Drinkability is great since at 9% abv I could drink at least four but who knows what would happen to me after that."
"Outstanding drinkability even at this ABV. This would make a great year round beer. A great tripel, especially given the price point."
"D- not the most flavorful tripel I've ever tasted. it actually gets much better as it warms and loses a bit of its carbonation. good beer but think I was expecting more due to its reputation."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with half a finger of white head that sits on top for a while. Smells of apples and yeast, a little clove and some alcohol. Taste more of the same. Quite delicious. Mouthfeel creamy, medium carbonation, a little bite. Very nice. Extremely drinkable, especially for 9% abv. I may be in trouble with how drinkable this one is. Alcohol barely noticeable."
"The after taste is ok. not great but it's the typical craft beer after. This is a good value buy as far a Tripel's go. I look forward to enjoying this beer again in the future."
"The carbonation is high enough to lend a bite that really keeps the palate clean between sips."
"Overall: Definitely a high-caliber beer that's well made. Everything is in the nuances though as it's not a in-your-face beer. I prefer more guts with my Belgian beers which is reflected in my score. Nevertheless, i like this beer and next time, i'll drink it at near room temp to get a better grasp on it. Is it the be all end of the world? Not quite...but it's right up there."
"Drinkability: Out of the Unibroue beers I have had this is one of the most drinkable (not in terms of quality, but in terms of it not being a sipper). I truly can't believe that this is a 9% beer when I am drinking it and the carbonation truly makes it perfect for summer, which just does not compute in my mind! Trois Pistoles is still my favorite Unibroue, but this is a close second."
" I'm in awe of Belgians, gotta try more."
"Drinkability: alcohol content notwithstanding, this is a highly drinkable beer. I like that fact that each sip brings another complex collection of flavors to contemplate."
"this is the best value I've come across in alberta with no questions asked. unibroue should be proud of their strong ales they are world class right here in my backyard. warning if experiencing la fin du monde consume la fin du monde it wont feel as bad"
"a bit syrupy on the mouth. the sweetness coats the palate."
"Drinkability: A great beer. This is something that I would certainly like to keep in the house for any occasion."
"I gave drinkability a 2 but only because I thought if Im drunk enough I could probably gag a few down for the high ABV but I dont get drunk to much and will probably never do this."
"Notes: a delicious tripel, to be sure, but the low carbonation leaves me wanting a bit more. Not my favorite example of the style, but definitely a beer I'll seek out again, especially for the reasonable price."
"Notes: La Fin Du Monde is definitely firmly entrenched on the 'refined' side rather than the 'explosive' side of the tripel category. There are others that are more explosively fruity, spicy, and powerful. But, this is a very well-made beer that stays in perfect balance throughout. Nice melding of harmonious flavors that make this quite enjoyable. I really wish Unibroue would ease up on the carbonation, but it deserves all of the praise that it gets, nonetheless. Recommended"
"A ridiculously good value. A must try if you like hefes or spicy beers in general!"
"Notes: A very nice tripel. Great appearance and a nice overall combination of flavors and aromas make this an very enticing beer. My first non-Belgian tripel and a very good one at that."
"Light straw color with a serious amount of carbonation. I had just cooled the beer. Nice smell not atypical of a tripel. Really enjoyed the taste. Obvious sweetness, but with a really solid earthy type dirt sort of flavor. Maybe the yeast got a little stirred up, but it really adds to the flavor. Good aftertaste and unusually drinkable for a tripel. Probably the best beer I've had from Unibroue."
"Notes: It's a nice beer... I confess that I'm not a big fan of tripels, whether Belgium or their American reinterpretations. I like them, sure. But I'm just not a big fan. So this one does not cut it for me as a favorite or an iconic reference. I think that for tripel lovers this is probably a delight. But being such a great beer there is something that does not quite gel in the end for me."
"D - Ridiculously drinkable. I could put these away often and quickly and probably drink myself to death. Maybe it's just the triple distilling, but this goes down too smoothly and too easily for how much alcohol is in there. Nice, mild tasting."
"D: Didn't finish it, but that might have been because of the great food. Will definitely have to try again."
"Pours a beautiful golden orange that's slightly hazy but with ample foam. The nose is very inviting, with crisp Belgian spice and orange zest complimented by just a bit of alcohol. This beer has a wonderful medium body with robust effervescence. The taste is quite sweet and is not spicy as the aroma may suggest. There are strong citrus (orange) notes with a surprisingly crisp bite of hops with a somewhat dry finish. Additionally, there is a lingering flavor or that great spice. This beer has a great complex flavor that's not PERplexing. A great and accessible tripel for all occasions!"
"Its taste very plain, its good, reminds me of Duvel. To me its a very high alcohol session beer. So I'd drink tihs when I get to drunk."
"A wonderful tripel! The alcohol is well hidden making this beer very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- Dangerously drinkable at 9%. This beer took some getting used to for me. This was my first tripel and after about the first half a dozen sips I was hooked."
"D - This is how a tripel should be made. I haven't had many but this is by far the best. It is in the top 100 for good reason. The alcohol is a bit high to get this a 5 but I can forgive the high alcohol here because it tastes VERY good!"
"Overall this is a sweet Tripel with good complexity. La Fin du Monde is an excellent beer, but it's kind of joke that it is the number one Tripel on BA, ranking higher than all of the original Belgian versions. But who am I to argue with 1500+ reviews? I prefer a drier Tripel. To each his own."
"With a fantastic spicy start, and a combination of hops, cloves, citrus and just a hint of something floral this is a truly great beer. Finishes with a crisp clean finish that makes it easy to drink this beer over and over again."
"Overall, a superb beer leaving me wanting more. Again, kudos to the chef!"
"Pours a hazy/sediment filled golden orange with a fizzy two finger head that disappears very quickly to a ring around the beer. No lacing is present on my glass halfway through the bottle. Not a very strong head/appearance. Smells like a good belgian beer, has belgian yeast, spice, a bit of fruit and maybe a smoked/malty smell to it. Tastes of belgian yeast, malts, a bit of citrus, some fruits and once again a malty/smoked taste. Good malty aftertaste toward the end. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, has a little cream in the mouth and leaves that good belgian taste lingering on the tongue. Drinkability is good here for a tripel, taste is great and the 9% alcohol is well hidden, no alcohol taste shines through at all, doesnt feel too heavy on the stomach. Definately has that signature Unibroue canadian-belgian taste."
"Great golden color with a nice head. Has a strong deep flavor with lots of yeast and a bit of spice to it. Nice fruity bouquet. Has just the right ammount of carbanation, has a great mouthfeel. Just a great beer in every aspect. Has little alcohol flavor, even though it has a 9% ABV."
"D - very nice could drink a bunch would have to be careful do to well hidden abv."
"A great beer. Very drinkable."
"One of the best tripels I've had, but not the best. Awesome brew."
"Overall this is a really good beer."
"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a two-finger off-beige head that lasted a little while. The smell is complex and represents some of the best parts about the style. There is some coriander and clove along with some fruitiness including tangerine, lemon, and a bit of banana. The taste is the same as the smell, you can almost taste something new every sip but it always seems to fit together perfectly to be complex and delicious without being overpowering or cloyingly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick with some moderate carbonation. This is probably in the top three of my varieties of tripel, which is one of my favorite styles."
"D: Tripels are probably my least favorite style of the high ABV Belgian styles, but I think I can go as far as saying that this is one of the best tripels I've ever had. Complex and balanced, yet with plenty of that Belgian edginess. This one is really easy to drink, but deserves to be sipped and savored at a gentle pace."
"Drinkability: Strong, deep flavors, this is to be enjoyed like a good book near the fire. Sadness will occur when the beer is no more"
"Drinkability, due to its 9% ABV, lack of any alcohol flavor or heat, crazy deliciousness, and perfect mouthfeel, is triple red flag warning dangerously excellent."
"Sweeter than most tripels Le Fin gets a little cloying towards the end of a bottle."
"This brew is delicious; very tasty, very drinkable. It could get me all kinds of shitty if I made a session out of this brew. This is why I prefer to sip and enjoy, after all it was probably meant for just that. If I could line this next to all of the other triples I have had and taste test them - I think this may be the one to beat. Very stellar."
"Unibroue's offering is certainly worthy of an excursion. Fortunately, it is significantly more readily available. La Fin du Monde has become a staple for me, even an ingredient, as few beers have such versatility. Yum!"
"D - A tasty tripel."
"Overall - Not a bad triple, but overall much too sweet for my taste. I don't think I could have two in a row."
"I'd imagine this is pretty versatile with food. Plus, if you get the corked and caged bottle...well that has class written all over it. I'll try it sometime."
"Cloudy, golden, yellow, thick, giant head, dissaptes slowly, thick lacing down sides, thin head remains, smell is yeasty, pear dominates, malty, grassy, taste is real nice, well played, booze hidden, but a slight hotness down the throat in the end, more pear in the mouth, sweet, but not cloying, very little bitterness in the finish, the mouthfeel is near perfect, slightly creamy, but very well carbonated, plenty of bubbles to scrub the ol' tongue, drinkabilty, this fucker is 9%?"
"An attractive hazy gold color with a generous inch thick head with staying power. I don't know what I am smelling, but I want more. The taste is sweet and fruity and wonderful. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth. This is a beer for the gods, thank you Unibroue for making this available to a mere mortal. It may be a little too sweet to rate very high in drinkability, but I'll definitely suffer this sipper. Absolutely great beer!"
"Drinkability: While the ABV is a tad high, the flavors and smell are just too damn good to pass up and not say that this is an especially drinkable beer -- the alcohol is so well masked that it's easy to get down and the strong, robust flavors would easily compliment any meal, making the ABV a little easier to deal with."
"Overall, one of the best tripels I have ever had and a great overall beer."
"(D)- What a great Tripel! Its got all the right flavors, but presents itself in a delicate and complex way. Crisp and refreshing for a summers day. If I didnt pass out due to the 9% alcohol, I would drink this all day long!"
"D: Probably the best Tripel I've ever had, a legendary beer well deserving of praise. Also my first Unibroue (though I had my 2nd later in the night) and I was equally impressed with the famous French Canadian brewery. This is a winner and one you should go out of your way to find! Huge shout out to Porter's Pub too, those guys rock!"
"D- Very nice and complex. Alcohol levels are approaching high. Im feeling their effects after half a glass, so this is a sipper for sure. I dont like bitterness, I prefer sweetness so this beer is going down very well. I wish I had a 750ml rather than a 12oz."
"D - This is a classic example of the style, one I have had so many times that it is almost difficult to review it objectively. The spice notes blend perfectly with juicy, tropical fruit notes and make for a very refreshing beer despite the high abv. The only real weak point is the appearance and the anemic head. Not quite as complex as La Chouffe but very good; probably the best Tripel made outside of Belgium."
"Overall- A refreshing (9% abv) beer. Very tart and fruity but good for a few."
"This is a must try, I highly recommend."
"Sip this not only for the subtle flavors but also out of respect for the potency."
"A beer you can sip all night and not get bored. But seriously, be careful drinking this beer because it deceivingly strong."
"All in all, it's a favorite of mine and I recommend it to anybody who loves Belgians...I also think it could be a good gateway beer to get people into better beer."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I'm not a big fan of Tripels, but I do appreciate them, this one was balanced well without being so alcoholic, overly bitey, and harsh, and the drinkability was great although the ABV is very high. I could easily put down a couple small goblets of this great brew on a cool day, I did however get a little tired of the flavors after a couple goblets, so I wouldn't really enjoy drinking anymore than that. Not much to say, if you enjoy this style than try this one, it's definitely the smoothest one Ive had so far."
"D - excellent beer in its class. not overly alcoholed like many other tripels and very very smooth"
"P.S. I know it's made in canada, but since we pretty much own them, it's like it's brewed here."
"I'm really not sure how people can drink these types of yeasty beers regularly."
"Poured with a large, off-white head that eventually diminished to about one-finger size. Body was hazy, with light particles, and a dark yellow color. Lacing was fair. Very nice aroma... average yeast, some fruitiness as well. Great on the palate... full body, creamy, with lively carbonation. You can taste light alcohol, but it's not overwhelming at all. The fruit comes through again, and stays with you for a good amount of time. Delicious. A fantastic tripel; I'm very happy Unibroue is here in Canada to provide us with authentic-tasting Belgium brews."
"As a final note, I would like to point out that, anecdotally, a beer with a lot of esters and fusel alcohols will tend to give you a bigger, meaner hangover than one without, so be careful if you're going to get all messed up on this brew. You may live to regret it."
"Notes: I am torn with this beer. I really enjoy it, but I prefer other tripels a bit more. While it is a delicious beer that I will continue to keep, it will find its way only occasionally to my glass."
"Poured into Victory Brewpub Golden Monkey tulip glass. Each made for the other."
"I scored low on this review because of the age of the beer. I could easily scored 5/5 on taste, appearance and mouthfeel on a fresh brew... Try this beer. It's really a must!!!"
"Overall, this is one of my favorite belgian style tripels, and I'm very glad I picked up a 4-pack instead of a single."
"great taste, and drinkability. awesome!"
"Overall this beer is delightfully executed. There's no caramely sweetness, nor overpowering bitterness, nor wacky, inappropriate ester flavors, and yet the 9% ABV is completely masked. There are better Tripels, but ones as pleasant to drink as this are rare."
"This one's much more drinkable than the high ABV would typically allow. Pretty amazing, really."
"D- one 750 ml bottle is enough for one sitting. Otherwise you can drink this quickly or have it a nice sipper."
"D- Great drinkability and very refreshing for warmer weather. Still had enough body to take it seriously though."
"Drinkability: A perfect and very tasty Tripel with outstanding flavor and no strong alcohol taste or warmth for a relatively high ABV brew. Could easily do a session with this one, and I have. For a Canadian made Belgian Tripel style, this is one of the tastiest examples of the style I can think of, beating out several Belgian made Tripels that I like quite a bit. Everything done to perfection for smell, taste and drinkability. You would be hard pressed to find a better Tripel out there."
"Great beer"
"I have had this beer a number of times. I normally buy the beer in the large bottle, the beer has an excellent and clean taste which actually expands in your mouth with a bouquet as some would describe wines. I recommend this beer to anyone who would like a beer for a special occasion."
"drinkability - is perfect - i would never turn down this beer anytime of year"
"The color on this beer is fantastic, but I'm a little turned off by the humongous head on it. While you're waiting for that to settle, you can pretty much smell this beer from across the room, as the spicy and citrusy aroma is very strong. The taste is, as you would expect from the smell, spicy and citrusy, but also much stronger than you would first expect. The complex tastes add to the feel of this brew, yet it lost points on drinkability because of my tendency to take small sips and savor each one."
"D - Sipping beer the whole way, but very nice."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. Great flavour, not too sweet for a triple and smooth as hell. I could drink this all night if I woudn't pass out way too early on."
"d- definately worth the money, i think i paid about $6.99 for this bottle but it tastes very expensive and well balanced. i will probably buy this again to share with a freind. this is a special occasion beer, although it goes down very easy and smooth i would not drink it every day. decent buzz after finishing bottle. everything about this beer reminds me of delerium tremons, of you liked delerium you will like this one."
"IMPORTANT: i would say a great beer the fresher it is. sugar makes it do weird things if it sits for a bit too long. starts tasting like an old oversweet bpa."
"I've avoided Unibroue because I've been rather isolationist... but score one for Canada, this is a tasty brew."
"Pours a pale, cloudy amber. Banana/clove and citric fruits in the nose. Taste is spices, banana bread, and pears in that order. Medium bodied, washes down clean and leaves a banana bread aftertaste. Nice beer here, not my style but still enjoyable and one I would buy again."
"Poured into a wine glass at my local bar. They don't have the proper glassware so it definitely deserved this over a pint glass! LOL Pours a very decent size head with smells of pepper, ripe apples, and pears. Carbonation is very high but works so well with this. Taste is outstanding with a crisp, spicy and fruity balance that is wonderful. Mouthfeel is near perfect and this beer will sneak up on you with it's 9% ABV. I had 3 after a few IPA's and they let me know it! A fantastic brew by the champs of Canada IMHO!"
"Pours a hazy golden/orange with sizeable white head. Very fruity aroma, lots of carbonation, spices, yeast evident. Slight bit of alcohol comes through in the finish, which is moderately dry. Good offering from Unibrou, but to me is does not fit the ""Abbey Tripel"" style. More like a fruity version of a Duvel."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, goes down quite nicely."
"m/d - Just a bit sticky which is to be expect from the style, ends a little dry which is nice in this high ABV brew. Really tasty and deceptive in terms of potency...this is something you could drink all night but would regret in the morning."
"D- Would I drink it again? Yeah. But not any time soon. I could see how lovers of this style would go crazy for this well made beer."
"Carbonation seems a little excessive, flavours definitely open up once it's died down a little."
"D - The alcohol sneaks up on you, but it is incredibly well hidden. I'd have another in a heartbeat, but I'd pay for it!"
"Nice warm alcohol notes."
"A decent beer that is a sipping beer for me. Not really a fan of the fizzy alka seltzer type carbonation."
"This really does feel light and refreshing, I dunno if it's possible to disguise alcohol as well as Unibroue have achieved with this beer. Sure there is a bit of a warming sensation but that really is the only hint at the ABV of the brew. For that I must give this a 5 for drinkability. Yeah, I'm not gonna session this beer, but as far as a strong beer that tastes so light and refreshing, this can't be beat!"
"My favorite Unibroue product which I need to cellar but is hard not to consume."
"Everyone should drink this brew at some time"
"Drinkabilty - Very high! This beer is appropriately named. If the end of the world was coming I would be consuming with reckless abandon."
"taste is dry, fizzy, yeast, some fruits, spice, and a touch of citrus, ends dry and a little bitter."
"Unibroue seems to churn out amazingly good beers at great price points."
"Trippels tend not to be my favorite style but this is an ale I have loved since I first had it years ago. Exceptional in every way."
"Drinkability: A little high on the ABV, but other than that, I could drink this stuff all day long."
"Pours medium golden, almost translucent, with a thickwhite had of both large and fine bubbles, dissipating into a nice thin rim of small bubbles. Nose is very fruity, light fruits and some tropical qualities as well, and some yeasty esters are present also. Palate is very sweet and fruity, some soft malt in there, very carbonated and prickly, and white pepper too."
"Really, a top quality beer with only a few quibbles that keep it from matching up to my all time favorites."
"D= pretty good. Ill most likely be seeking this one out again sometime. Fun little beer with just enough complexity and still your able to sit and sip it for a while without thinking too much."
"Overall this is very good, although triples may be a bit too high in ABV for my preference, I could easily drink one of these."
"D - This is a creeper. This beer goes down very smoothly but carries a velvet hammer."
"D: Very easy to drink, but at 9% you have to watch out."
"D- 9% what? This stuff drinks like uber delicious sparkling cider. Very light yet complex."
"Really nice example of the style. Very impressed."
"Pours a hazy oragne with a fizzy head. Nice clove, spicy and yeasty aroma. Taste is much of the same, somewhat complex, with a tart fruityness that has a cherry-like character, but its hard to put my finger exactly on it, and a slight note of alcohol. Nice level of carbonation and mouthfeel and really enjoyable to drink with all that complexity and alcohol. Good example of the style."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is."
"75cl bottle shared with larryLSB. Hazy golden orange color with a lasting white head. The aroma is yeasty and quite fruity with lots of tangy apricot and tangerine. The flavor is also yeasty, with some of that apricot sweetness, some citric tartness and alcohol. There is definitely some spiciness too. Full-bodied with lively carbonation. When I added the yeast at the end, the alcohol really smoothed out and this became a very nice tripel."
"It'd definitely a rich beer, and one that needs to be sipped. I shared a tall bottle of this with my old man for his birthday and I must say I think I'm partially glad I had someone to share the bottle with. But what can I say it went down smoothly and I savoured each and every sip, I didn't want to waste a drop without enjoying its complexities."
"D - A little too sweet and tart for my taste but a good example of the style."
"Overall, a very interesting, easy-to-drink brew. Lots of taste nuances in a powerful package. I think that this may not be my absolute favorite style of beer...I would choose a double IPA any day of the week. However, in the right setting...say, a hot summer day, sitting outside with friends with nothing pressing, when you don't mind tying one on...this is a great choice."
"D=very drinkable and enjoyable"
"This is a ""dangerously"" drinkable brew ... a sipper, for sure, at 9%."
"D = Anytime, anywhere, I'd even drink it warm"
"The mouthfeel is so creamy and lush and the flavor profile so delicate that this beer drinks extremely well. However, that 9% is no joke and can definitley pack a punch."
"Quite easily drinkable, and repeatively so, though be wary -- 9% can creep up on you, especially when contained in such a well-layered beer. A brew to sip, not chug."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, drink it slow because is very tasty. Perhaps a bit too carbonated for some. People complained of its sweetness but I just don't see it. This is very enjoyable and leaves your mouth tasting of clove and orange."
"D- I could stick with it for a while, but I prefer a good Belgian dark ale to the tripels."
"D- the ABV is masked well. id say its easy to drink in the tripel catagory."
"drinkability is off the chart sinfully good beer have not had a bad beer from unibroue."
"It's a shame about the alcohol poking its head out, really. But more than that, it's a disappointment that the delicious springlike flavours on this can't overcome, otherwise this would be an exceptionally drinkable beer. As it is, it's just delicious instead."
"Overall, an excellent beer and an excellent tripel. Highly recommend. Lately, I've been avoiding tripels and this one makes me wonder why. Not going to be a regular in the rotation but this should be worth couple bottles a year, especially the smaller size so I can have something else after."
"Quite delicious in the mouth. Finishes smooth and replenishing to the taste buds. A bit of tartness does not detract in the least from the superior drinkability of this beer."
"La Fin du Monde is definitely a great Tripel with fantastic qualities. Definitely a brew to be noted of and end a night with."
"Overall - Happy 100th review to me, and what a brew to choose for it. If this is the end of the world, bring it on!"
"Caveat: if you don't read the label about the alcohol content, you will be surprised. Ironically I think I tasted the alcohol more in the cleaner, slightly bitter body of the cold/clear pour. The sediment provides flavors that mask the alcohol, and warmth seems to potentiate those other flavors more than the alcocol."
"Beautiful radiant golden color with fizzy white head. Alcohol, orange peels, citrus, light fruit, apple skins, and cloves in the aroma. Wow, taste is quite the eye opener. Warming alcohol, spices, fresh-squeezed citrus rivers, then faint hops in the end. Crisp and fizzy in the mouth and greatly refreshing. Incredibly flavored and a sure delicacy to be considered."
"Overall, I'm not sure if I got a strange batch or what, but this beer was not what I was expecting. I'm a big fan of tripels, and La Fin kind of threw me for a loop. It wasn't bad really, just took me by suprise I suppose. I'll definitely be trying this again to see if I had a fluke experience or what."
"- Super drinkable for a Belgian... a beer and style all in its own though i think. More complex than the usual... and I can only compare this to the Stone Vertical that I tried and hated... but this is far better and actually might make me purchase a fine Belgian in the near future like this one. Doesn't hide its strength as well as a Ninkasi Tricerahops... but it is what it is!!"
"D: Sublimely drinkable. One of the beers that truly turned me on to the good stuff."
"Would definitely recommend and will try again."
"Poured a cloudy blonde with a thick head. The smell is the spicy aroma that I equate with all unibroue products. Very heavy flavor with cloves and other spices easily overpowered the pizza I was eating. Just a hint of alcohol to warn against the serious alcohol this beer packs."
"Taste makes it drinkable, carbonation cuts down on this a bit, as does the 9% ABV."
"This is so good the Belgians are probably considering declaring war. This beer is a favor to the wallet and a delight to the tongue."
"With that said La Fin Du Monde is easily one of the best triples ever brewed and makes a strong case for itself to be one of the best beers ever brewed. Its craftsmanship rivals that of even the top genuine Belgium breweries."
"M-D- First is a dry astringent feel on the mouth from the alcohol esters followed by a smooth finish that let the taste buds know it means business. Drinkablity is great. I plan to buying a larger amount next time."
"A brilliant beer, complex, spicy, and all-around tremendous."
"D: Dangerous. Crisp, highly drinkable. Cool on a hot day. I'm having to force myself to slow down, because I know otherwise this 9% is going to catch up and kick my butt!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D- It was good to enjoy one or two but more than that its sweetness and alcohol might get to you. Overall a great beer and a great Triple."
"This beer is an experience. Pours a hazy gold with a lively head and active carbonation. The smell is ripe with fruit, yeast and spice. There is some alcohol in the aroma, but I can't stay mad at it. The taste is tart and refreshing at the same time. It's a perfect example of the Tripel style."
"more please."
"Overall: Very interesting beer, I finished this about an hour ago and my palate is still smashed up with the flavors from it. Probably wont buy again, due to the session capabilities of it. None the less, it was a great brew."
"d- extremely drinkable. not a single un-enjoyable note"
"I am highly impressed with La Fin Du Monde. I'm even more impressed given the fact that this beer is readily available around home, and at killer prices ($6.99 for a 750? Yes please!). A exemplary beer, especially paired with fresh sushi (California and Rainbow Tuna/Salmon Rolls). I will be reserving a permanent place in my fridge for this beer as my go-to triple!"
"drinkability a very good tripel no complaints at all... on my list of approved tripels lol"
"Overall an excellent example of a trippel. I've tasted darker and heavier, but this golden version masks it's alcohol perfectly and leaves an excellent aftertaste. Not a session beer, but perfect for a first review. Respect beer!"
"D: VERY drinkable trippel. 9% ABV is too well hidden, more so than any other higher abv I had had. Much too easy to quaff."
"Bottom Line: Try this beer. It is one of those that everyone needs to have tasted at least once."
"This beer is a Tripel Belgian styled-ale. It has a nice orange and spicy aroma. The flavors are pretty complex and mostly great. To start, you get nothing except for a blast of carbonation that lasts at least a second. But finally that evolves on your palate. First tastes are of orange and other citrus along with spices, noticeably cloves and cinnamon. Lots of yeasty and doughy flavors as well. A nice finish and aftertaste too. The 9% alcohol warms you up but in a good way and is not annoying at all."
"Great brew overall, I am becoming a huge fan of Unibroue."
"12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop in West Hazleton. Poured into my tulip glass. After stirring up the yum-yum's in the bottom of the bottle, appears a cloudy golden copper color with about two fingers of tightly packed, small bubbled foam. A nice pour. Smells and tastes of sweet malts, candi sugar, cloves, spicy Unibroue house yeast, a touch of lemon peel and a hint of black pepper. Delicious! A notch above medium bodied and without a doubt, moderate carbonation. A classic!"
"D- A wonderful example of the style. A great beer that drinks easy and is easily obtainable."
"Notes: I've heard this beer called the ""Canadian stand-in for Duvel", and after just drinking Duvel a few nights ago I have to agree. While Duvel is a better beer across the board, this is still one very good beer. It isn't anything that will knock your socks off, but it's still a solid offering from Unibroue. Definitely something I'll buy again."
"Arguably Unibroue's finest (along with Maudite). Highly recommended."
"Homerism (hah - this is too much of a big-ass, geographically speaking, for now, country for that) aside, this is really a rather good example of the style, going down nice and smooth in spite of the big boy booze quotient. It's been their flagship beer since day one for a reason, and it's not hard to see why."
"Drinkability: One word ""INSANE"" in a fantastic way. It 9% abv and cant even taste the alc. at all could seriously drink these all day but the abv would for sure catch up to me."
"This started off as a very drinkable tripel. If I were tasting it blind, I probably would have guessed it to be a Chimay. I would drink this again. Next time I'm buying a 750ml."
"I don't know what everyone is so afraid of, the end of the world is delicious."
"Overall, pretty straight forward. Not the most complex belgian style I have had but nice and tasty none the less."
"One of the first beers that introduced me to the Belgian style. It is one of the best looking beers in the glass, with a bright yellowish orange color and a nice thick head on top. It smells potently of orange, yeast and spices. It has a sharp bite to it which is cooled by the flavors of the beer. Although I have branched out to other true Belgians, this is one of my favorite beers and I can't help but keep it in my regular rotation at the bar."
"Bottle Pours a golden orange with a fluffy white head which leaves a good lacing. Aroma is spicy yeast and fruits. Has a good mouthfeel and good carbination. Has a smooth taste well blended and not strong. A decent aftertaste. Overall a very good beer"
"D: Well, the richness of it will keep me from putting down multiples of these, but it keeps pulling me back as I drink it. A really fine brew."
"Drinkability: This beer outclasses most if not all of the competition and is on my ""return to again and again"" list. The drinkability is excellent. The beer tastes as fresh and complex at the end as at the beginning and could be a great session beer but for the high ABV. It is too good for my own good."
"An excellent beer from Unibroue, cloudy amber color, not a lot of nose but good carbonation and frothy head that leaves a good lace. Higher ABV is hidden. Flavor is sweet citrus and yeast, smooth. $5.79 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from Concord Cooperative Market Concord, NH."
"A wonderful cloudy orange glow emanates. It has a perfect citrus and bready aroma. The carbonation attacks the mouth which gives it a bit of spice. But plenty of orange, grapefruit, and yeasty baked bread permeate the flavor. It finishes clean. Really, one of the best brews ever crafted."
"O - La Fin du Monde is a go to for Triple. Top Notch."
"Poured a very light golden color. I must not know how to pour bottle conditioned ales because this is the second foamer I have opened this week. With the gentlest pour possible I ended up with a glass 50% full of foam. Smell was very spicy with a hint of vanilla. Tasted sour and spicy, not one hint of ethanol. Mouthfeel was good, lingering aftertaste of sweetness. Great beer!"
"Had at Marathon Grill in Philly. Poured a hazy golden amber with a frothy white head that dissipated quickly. Smelled of sweet oranges and biting lemons, as well very complex spices. Tasted as it smelled with predominantly orange flavor, quite sweet with mild carbonation, and others sweet citrus notes. The taste then turned to a pleasant spice which balanced out an otherwise sweet finish. Like Weyerbacher's Merry Monks but much better, much less overpowering. Absolutely fantastic beer, my favorite Tripel."
"Normally I don't review beers, but I thought Unibroue just did exceptional with this beer. Will be at the top of my list for a long time."
"From what I have had so far this is my favorite belgium style brew, I have had only a few tripels, however from what I have tasted I can not imagine a more flavorful 9% beer that hides the alcohol flavors so well."
"i love the unibroue brewery, every time i try one of their beers i declare it my favorite, until i try the next one that makes me reconsider. this tripel pours a very nice golden color, with snow-white head and good carbonation...looks like duvel to me. smells are spicy, citrusy, and a little hoppy. tastes great, floral hops, some citrus, hints of clove, and a nice, crisp and spicy finish. an interesting spicy taste makes an appearance, almost like cracked peppercorns, but not at5 all overwhelming. almost no alcohol flavor in this one, despite its powerful 9% presence. has a nice medium to thick body, and the lacy head stayed to the end. absolutely delicious brew. very drinkable, i had one, but could easily have drank a couple more with pleasure and without difficulty. i believe a more apt name woud be ""la fin du concurrence"" (end of competition) because its really that good."
"Like I said, I had a few distractions so I'd love to re-review this beer to get a more concice smell and flavor profile from it."
"12oz. bottle dated October 2004. La Fin Du Monde poured a yellow/gold color with a large 3 finger head. It smells bread like, citrusy and of nuts. Not a bad smell at all. However, the taste i where the beer went down hill. It tasted very much like Duvel, but a cheap, less appealing Duvel. It tasted like nuts, and I kept getting the taste of a cork.. strange. It's kind of bitter, but not too bad. You can definitely taste the citrus as well, but I can't get the cork out of my mind. Not very pleasing, not bad, but not good. Mouthfeel is fine and smooth. Drinkable? Eh yeah, for a while. It took me a while to finish the whole glass, but it went down. My bottle was obviously pretty old, so I'd like to try a fresh one and see how my opinion differs."
"Pours a cloudy light orange with a head the died quickly. Had a yeasty spicy aroma like most belgians. And was highly carbonated. Taste was very good at first, lots of yeast spice coriander citrusy flavors that gave way to a strong alcohol finish. There was a slightly sour taste at the finish also. This one was just ok at first, but it gets way better the more you drink and your tastebuds get used to it. It packs quite a kick."
"D: Considering the high ABV and my high expectations of this brew, it is drinkable for this style. I will try other beers from Unibroue and see if their other styles hit the mark for me."
"Carbonation is quite crisp at the beginning, providing an interesting dryness, but the beer still pulls off a creamy finish. Interesting flavor development in this beer - starts off light before exploding, matching the mouthfeel in development. An interesting take, excellent beer."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer and a great example of the style. A sipper, definitely, but the most enjoyable kind. The complex interactions between the fruit flavors and the spices never get old. However, while the 9% alcohol is well hidden, it defintiely will sneak up on you."
"I couldn't drink too many both because it's filling and the cider flavor is definitely not to my taste--I can see why this is so highly rated, though, so I would recommend giving it a shot."
"D 5.0 - Dee-lish! I have been waiting for an opportunity to try this Tripel and it lived up to my expectations. It was excellent!"
"750 ml bottle that somehow was available for purchase in my uber religious hometown. Nice golden pour with a huge white head and a nice big amount of lacing left behind. Fruity smell with a big flavor of bubblegum and fruit with some wheat thrown in as well. Tasty little ale, would definitely drink again. This was the beer I chose to ring in the new year with, hope the name is no indicator of what will happen in 09!"
"This is a very good beer. Not as complex as some tripels, but very well done overall. It's nice and crisp, and certainly sweet, but I was hoping for some funkiness to go with it all."
"Has a wonderful aroma the combines malty, fruity and honey tones; light, cloudy amber in colour with a fluffy head; smooth, malty and complex flavours do not carry any hint of its strength, just a subtle combination of spicy infusions with an effervescent texture; subtly spicy after taste."
"Very nice trippel, I've been waiting to try it."
"Notes: Another fantastic ale of notable strength that hides its ABV very well. Deserving of all the acclaim - I'll definitely be coming back for more!"
"D-Very pleasant to drink. An old favorite I'll consistently come back to."
"Pours an orangey, straw yellow with a huge, soapy, white head, which quickly dissipates. I smell a delicious, dusty blend of apple, plum, honey, and a touch of citrus. The taste follows suit with these same flavors; a wonderful, full, complex flavor. This is not overwhelming at all like tripels can be, even in spite of the ABV. The mouthfeel is equally pleasant--light, bubbly, and carbonated--and the alcohol is nowhere to be found. I found La Fin Du Monde akin to Brooklyn Local 1, perhaps a touch better, and I think this will be my tripel of choice for a while."
"d - another solid Unibroue for me. Not much new to report."
"Just a wonderfully made beer. Great taste, highly drinkable, not much more you can ask for. This is one that will always be in my house."
"D- Overall a great brew that did not disappoint. Highly drinkable but watch out for that 9% ABV, it will sneak up on you!"
"D: Very drinkable. However, its richness and high alcohol content really prevent a lot from being drunk."
"this one is one of my personal favorites. im actually drinking it tonight. the taste is unique and you can really taste the apples. its usually too expensive for me to want to buy but every now and then it can be found at a nice price. the 750ml is usually too expensive as well but worth it for a nice occasion. theres not too much carbonation in it either. real nice."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle it poured a light, hazy, honey, golden color and produces a nice huge fluffy head. The smell is spicy and yeasty. I think the spices come out more in the smell than anything else. The taste is slightly bitter, fruity, and sweet. The spices also come through on the taste and all that combined makes this beer taste very good. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and not thin at all. With a 9% ABV this beer is really drinkable. After a few I'm sure I would feel it but I wouldn't have problem drinking them. I haven't had many Tripels before and the ones before weren't bad but this beer makes me want to try more of the style and of course more from Unibroue as this is another fine beer from them."
"After having more of this, I have upped my rating of this one. One of my 1 or 2 favorite beers. Bliss in a bottle."
"D- I was expecting a beast, but actually didn't have trouble finishing the bottle in one night"
"-Dotson"
"Light orange cloudy beer with a head that overflows and takes a while to calm down.Aroma is vanilla and spices.Taste is orange and spices.This reminds me too much of a witbier which I am not a fan of.I would not recommend and I could have done without this."
"Pours a murky, cloudy light gold in color. Two fingers of head forms on the pour. Smell is highly yeasty, with some spice and a decent amount of lemon. Taste has actually quite a bit of yeast to it. There is more of the fruity overtones, with more than just the lemon flavor showing up. Decent mouthfeel and highly carbonated. Decent, but it's not ""The Don""."
"D - A very smooth and complex beer. Not my favorite style but undeniably good."
"D: For 9% abv, it is deceptively drinkable. For the price, it is hard to beat. IMO it is a very decent brew. I'd have to say drinkability is where this brew succeeds the most."
"D: This is definitely a sipper. ABV sneaks up at the end, but it's all worth it. I can't wait to try more from Unibroue!"
"Poured into a tulip pint glass and was extremely foamy, probably due to the extra bottle fermentation . Very pale straw yellow, very light, a little cloudy, nice sweet apple smell, lots of fruity tones, yeasty incredibly long lasting head. Very much like a Duvel, alcohol was balanced nicely with the malt and hops. Pretty full bodied, lots going on in this brew. Pretty good stuff."
"An excellent offering with wonderful taste and balance which proves that not all great Belgians come from Belgium."
"P.S. Drink responsibly, drink at home."
"The mouth is perfect, definitely perfect carbonation which marries so well with the ultra dry finish. Excellent example of a belgian from outside of belgium. Unibroue has yet to disappoint, this is another prime example from them."
"Overall as far as tripels go I much prefer the St. Bernardus but even that is comparing apples to oranges, this is a very spicy example."
"D - A delightful sipper... A stellar example of the style... If I had to point at one area for improvement it would be mouthfeel where a little more bite from the carbonation would add dimension to the near world class beer..."
"A magnificent beer and a spot-on example of the style that lacks really only in appearance, where a bit more head retention would serve it well for beauty's sake."
"I was really looking to this beer, but it did disappoint just a bit. Pale and no head, no lacing. Not even the full gold color I look for in a Tripel. Lots of spicy cloves and sweetness in the smell. The nose is slightly better than the taste. Its just not all that enjoyable. Cloves and spice, but not super tasty. A little too carbonated for my preference. Its not a bad beer, but I'm not convinced its one of the best in the world."
"D - Would it not be for the 9% ABV, this beer would be an all night drinker. This beer is so well done that all the flavors, aromas, and textures meld so well as to make this a really drinkable tripel. Possibly my favorite tripel."
"Restraint is the word I'd apply to this beer, which leads to sick balance. Fantastic mix of bright, lively fruitiness with a sock of malt and yeast."
"Wow! At first I wasn't quite sure what to think. It pours an orange/amber with about an inch head. You can smell the cloves as soon as you pour it. Then you can smell a peppery fruit. That was what caught me sort of off guard, but as soon as you taste it you know it all just works. The cloves are there above it all, wtih a fruit flavor following, followed by just a hint of hops. The aftertaste is alcohol and just a touch bitter. At 9% I couldn't drink more than one of these 750 ml bottles, but it would surely make me want to try. Thought the cork was nifty too."
"Radiant, hazy, orange with a huge, fluffy, white head. On the nose...spicy, herbal, coriander, fennel(?), banana, sweet caramel and burnt orange, Jesus, what doesn't it have?! Follows through with all the above on the palate with beautiful warming alcohol mouthfeel. Wonderfully complex. Doesn't get much better than this. Life is good."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers, and in the style of Tripel I can't think of a better one. I can think of others which come close to matching it, but when one considers the price ($9.99 for a 4-pack) there is nothing out there that matches it. The other beers which come close are all $10 for a 750ml so for twice the amount of beer I'll almost always turn to La Fin du Monde. Who also doesn't like a beer that translates to ""The End of the World""? Also this beer is easily the best I have had among the Unibroue offerings."
"Dangerously drinkable. Amazing brew."
"great beer, very new to tripels but enjoyed this. certainly not my favorite style, but for someone who really digs it, this seems to be near the top."
"This is an excellent triple by Unibroue. As I was drinking this I kept having flashbacks of a Weihenstephaner Hefe, but this brew is definitely different, more complex fruit flavors. Well balanced. Nice brew."
"D - Hands-down my favorite Tripel. I have a lot of respect for Unibroue, and this beer is one of my primary reasons for it. It's simply fantastic. It's enjoyable, smooth, and very easy to drink."
"D- I nurse the bottle slowly. This isn't a beer you can drink quickly but should sip and savor. Surprisingly the alcohol isn't overwhelming but very subtle"
"D: i could deffinaly have a few of these goes down real smooth no boozie feel at all"
"The Belgian yeast is definitly the overpowering taste here. Almost like a higher carbonated hefeweizen. Very smooth fruity flavors and goes down very easy. Not much of an after taste here."
"Huge billowing rocky head over amber/orange body, nice lacing. Citrusy nose, and oranges, banana and spices (coriander) in a nice balanced body. Very carbonated mouthfeel, gave me the tingles:) A bit of alcohol in the finish, but dangerously drinkable for ABV. One of North America's best interpretations of the classic Belgian tripel. A truly glorious beer experience, glad I have another bottle stashed:)"
"Very tasty, smooth, and quite drinkable. It hides the 9%abv so well. I can't even tell that it's there. I'm betting that it will sneak up on you, though. Be careful with this one."
"Notes: Definitely my favorite of the ""Unibroue"" ales."
" I normally don't like my beers this strong, but it all works here. The 9.00% ABV is not to be taken lightly, since it will be felt from the first sip to the last drop. This is a good beer for this time of the year, when you're sick of stouts and darker offerings but still need to be warmed up because spring is taking it's time to arrive! All the praise this beer gets is certainly deserved."
"I've always liked Tripels, but this beer just made Tripels my favorite style. Woody, sticky, light citrus, just about everything I've expected in Tripel... just better! I can see why this beer is in the top 100."
"MF&D - the feel is great, a creamy body that is not too thick with a large amount of carbonation. I could drink this into oblivion, which wouldn't be too hard."
"Hard to believe I've never reviewed this beer. It's one of my go-to beers. While not as complex as say a Westmalle or a Bernardus tripel, I can't walk into an average grocery store and pick up a better tripel. Availability/Price/Quality, this is a winner."
"served out of a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. pours a cloudy golden yellow color with lots of rising bubbles and a nice soapy head like most belgians, that faded slowly. the lacing is not too aparent at first, but as it warms it produces a nice sticky lace on the glass. the smell is almost all phenolics and such from the belgian yeast. tiny bit of a malt nose as well. a little sweet smelling with some alcohol. the taste is absolutely delicious. lots of bubblegum and bananna from the yeast, a little citrus, with some belgian malts aparent. very sweet as well with somewhat of a dry finish. it hides the alcohol very well, you cant taste it what so ever. mouthfeel is pretty medium. drinkability is pretty good considering the 9%, but it real creeps up on you so be carefull. like every unibroue ive had, its pretty damn good, they are all worth a try, exspecially this one. great tripel."
"This is a high ABV beverage, but sbeaky. YOu'll have a few before you realize just how much you've been affected."
"Overall: Another solid win from Unibroue, La Fin Du Monde is available, reasonably priced, and delicious."
"Medium body with lots of carbonation. Alcohol appears to be well-hidden for the most part. Cool and refreshing, well worth having a few more around."
"D - The alcohol content makes it hard to drink a lot of these but the taste is so wonderful that you just want to grab another one."
"The body is moderate and a bit sweet for style. Carbonation is high even for style with a bit of carbonic bite. Some warming effects on the back end. To me, this is more of a Belgian golden than tripple. Just a lot going on to more along the lines of a tripple. Some off notes in the nose and taste but some complexity and esters are worth trying."
"Drinkability: Could easily drink a few of these sitting down and not be able to stand up. So refreshing for the alcohol that exists, but packed with so much flavor you just want to keep going back for more."
"M/D - very carbonated, but very tasty. The carbonation keeps me from having alot, but not from lack of want. Good tasting for sure"
"D- One of unibroue's better offerings and is quite drinkable at the 9% but watch yourself after a few. This one is good fresh and great with a year plus. Buy some!"
"Drinkability- So dangerous and so delicious with high alcohol this is a truely legendary beer anyone could appreciate"
"I have quickly become a convert and eagerly look forward to trying the other two in the pack having been more than satisfied by this and Trois Pistoles. As much as I love Victory, this is everything that Golden Monkey is not."
"This was a good beer and I'd drink it again. I'm not a huge fan of the style but its very drinkable, and pairs pretty well too."
"Pours light amber and a thin white head, with a floral nose and touches of clove and banana. This was somewhat similar to the Eau Bénite but bigger, with a more pronounced fruitiness and refreshing spiciness. Again, given its ABV, this was a superbly smooth beer and not at all harsh."
"One of the best crisp beers I ever had. The crisp refreshing taste makes it an excellent choice with many foods. The pour is golden with a slight cloudy hue. Not to heavy whatsoever. I like the balance of a touch of white pepper, with mellow citrus/champagne like flavor. Be careful this is 9% alcohol, which you can't detect after its too late, have fun ;)"
"D: Very nice indeed. I'm glad I finally picked this up."
"Thanks pamola."
"D: Very drinkable, no problem drinking the 750mL bottle. Very smooth."
"D - Would make a decent session beer, but not one to impress would-be beer buddies."
"If you like Tripels, you'll LOVE this beer, and you'll want to stock up like I did!!!"
"By far the best value I have found in a tripel, around $7.00 for 750ml. This beer has huge flavor, which is good if you like the style. Carbonation is up there and poured a rocky head. Of the beers in this stlye that I have tried it is second only to Chimay's tripel."
"Enjoy!"
"I love this brewery, and am not sure if I have ever had this, so I bought a single today. Pours a nice hazed golden color, with lots of air bubbles, and small bits of sediment. Heading is about one fingers worth. Big whiffs of tropical fruit begin, with mango, papaya, pineapple, a bit of must and nectar in there as well.Taste is very fruity, with the fruits mentioned above included, but then there is a spicy character that comes in, followed by a solvent alcohol taste that can best be compared to vodka. Body is medium, slick on the mouth and pretty hot I have to say. I am glad I opted for the single instead of an entire bottle, as this one was really hard for me to finish. I know this one gets a lot of praise, bit what can I say? I am not a huge fan of Tripels, and am definitely not a fan of Tripels that remind me of my least favorite spirit, vodka. Worth a try for Belgian fans. Cheers"
"Spicy, banana/bubble gum right off the nose and into the mouth...a slight and not unpleasant medicinal note...definite pepper and licorice as well as some pome fruit and soft citrus. This one drinks well at any temp and I like to take my time and sip, sip, sip."
"D- Excellent. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. It's there, but it blends in very well with what's going on in the beer. Overall a fantastic brew."
"D- middle of the road. I think they overdid the spicing and I felt more like I was eating a pie than drinking a beer (though is that a bad thing all the time?)"
"D: 9% is strong, but this beer is still surprisingly drinkable; not too heavy either."
"Poured into chalice from 750 mL bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a half finger of head. Very sweet smell like cane sugar and syrup. Taste is kind of wheaty and sweet. Very strong and sweet flavor that masks the ABV very well. Light coating mouthfeel. Drinkability is only lost on the full flavor and sweetness of an otherwise top notch tripel."
"Finally got around to this after many recommendations, but sadly it wasn't much to my liking. It's gold in color, strong head, smells nice, but far too hoppy & carbonated for my tastes. Still, easy going and smooth, considering. It does have a nice sour taste, if savored. But not really my style, in the end."
"Very drinkable. One of my favorite go-to's when I'm not in the mood for anything in particular."
"Drinkability: I will have this again, but not for a while. I have other favorite from Unibroue. The alcohol content on this one is sneaky, so I do not think I would have more than two in a session."
"Drinkability - This is where we could get in trouble. Repeated consumption would not be a problem at all!! A very easy to drink beer."
"Very good, lives up to its reputation."
"Drinkability- high. La Fin Du Monde would be an easy pick for a session beer. Except for the fact that sessioning a 9% would knock most of us right on or asses."
"Easy to drink, but not somethinf I'd be trying every night"
"Good carbonation and maltiness made for a really nice mouth feel. This is my second foray into Quebecs Unibroue. This one beats 3 Pistols, without a doubt."
"Poured a hazy gold with a think head. Aroma of bread, and sweet, syrupy pineapple. Initial flavors are sweet bread and alcohol followed closely spices and honey. This is rich, complex beer that is so good I want to swim in it. It has X-factor."
"Well carbonated and medium bodied, keeps this as drinkable as possible. This is a long-time sipper -- an one a night is enough for me. Good example of this style. Worth a try, more than once."
"I may have been a little to easy with the pour as the brew did not have a very large head but what was there was a light white color with nice retention. The brew has a nice cloudy dull yellow color to it with a slight tinge of orange. Some lacing down the side but think it could be more with a slightly more vigorous pour. The aroma is very pleasing, with a good Belgium smells, citrus, pear, maybe slight apple cider like, spicy yeast with slightly sweet malt. This is a very inviting brew, with it weighing in at 9 % I am not picking up and hot like aromas. The flavors don't seem as complex as the aroma, but they are damn good. one the first sip the malt is the first thing to come out for me, sweetness, which then breaks to a mild spiciness that lingers at the back of the mouth. From the second sip on other flavors come out. Clove and peppers seem to add more to the spiciness that I initially picked up. Hops seem to add to the spiciness that also seems to tickle the back of the mouth and tongue. Alcohol is a little more present here and comes out more as this brew warms, but that flavor is very good as it still seems muted and is not in anyway over powering the brew. This is another brew which I have just walked by for years. I knew of the reputation of being a great brew but for some reason I passed, well I think my feelings have clearly changed. This beer is fantastic, drinks easy which is scary for a 9% brew. Each sip leaves you wanting more."
"Very good drinker, lots of similarity to Ommegang's Hennepin fairly fresh batch as far as I can tell."
"Pours with a very fine one finger head, quick to dissipate, very cloudy orange-yellow color, not gonna see through this, does hold the light for a soft glow. Closely knit nose of pressed lemon and tangerine peels, oats and yeast, light clove, dried flowers, not that expressive but the right parts come through. Medium-bodied with an outwardly expansive mouth feel, could seem hollow if you're looking for thick body. Carbonation level is above average and churns things up some. The lemon, tangerine citrus as well as clove, coriander, cumin spice remains a primary focus. Pine tar, floral sap come in too. Have to say that the yeast and hops seem more alive in the mouth than the malts. Lots of retronasal action after you swallow."
"Overall, this is a solid beer! I really enjoyed the full body flavor of this triple. I have another in the fridge, but that one will be gone soon!"
"The taste has a bit of citrus, and the flavor overall hides the alcohol content in such a way that I find it deceptively easy to drink. A good value for the money, too."
"I should have found someone to share this very large bottle with. I'm definitely looking forward to the other 3 bottles."
"This is a very nice tripel, but one 750 ml bottle is enough for me at a time."
"I really like most of Unibroue's beers but La Fin Du Monde has to be my favourite. Bright, flavorful and eminently drinkable. A truly fantastic beer."
"Maybe I need to try it more often. Maybe I had a bad bottle. I usually agree with The Brothers but this time I just didn't think of it as world-class as they do."
"Very drinkable, and highly recommended if you're into Belgian strong ales."
"My expectations where met with one of my top six rated active bottled beers for style."
"Note: Unlike many higher alcohol content beers the alcohol in this triple doesn't come through as much as the beer gets warmer and nearer the end."
"The best example of a belgium tripel I've had. completely enjoyable experience to sit down with one of these."
"D: A hell of a tripel. I wish they all had this kind of character in the place of just the strong phenolic alcohol tastes. If I had to pick one example of a tripel, this would be the one."
"Drinkability: Exceptional. My only regret is that I only got a 12 oz bottle of it, instead of the bomber. I will absolutely buy this one again. Exceptional beer."
"D: Very Drinkable. One of my favorites from Unibroue. The hop and malt balance is awesome without sacrificing anything. The alcohol is so well hidden. I think if I were blindfolded I would mistake this one for a hefe"
"Highly carbonated, but still smooth. Creamy, too. Very drinkable."
"D: The name on this beer alone is great and somewhat fitting for the times. Helps put a smile on your face. Truly delicious. Picked this up in a four pack and it worked out to about $3.47 for a 750ml bottle. Easily one of the best deals in beer I have had to date."
"D-9% is hidden very well,this is a very easy drinking beer with a great taste.If this is the end of the world I'm almost ready now."
"Drinkability is exceptional. I drank the whole 750ml in a little over 2 hours, enjoyed every last drop. The alcoholic burn is not significant enough to be annoying, its mainly enticing with a nice warming in the stomach. Wasn't too buzzed after the bottle was done, but i imagine if you drank this quickly in like 45 minutes or something it'd creep up on you. It's 9% after all. For 7.50 for a 750ml corkedbottle of stuff this great you can't go wrong."
"all and all a fantastic beer, why has it taken me this long to try it, will be having many more i'm sure."
"D: In a word, outstanding. Didn't notice the alcohol content until the second pour from the 750ml bottle. I think that I could sip this one for a long time."
"Nose is fruity and sweet, with a fair amount of spice. Flavors of banana and spice (clove?) dominate. Slight alcohol burn that comes in at the end, though it's pretty well hidden. Surprisingly light mouthfeel, but I have very little experience with tripels. Lots of small bubbles. Ends on the dry side, with almost a chalky feel."
"12 oz bottle poured to a unibroue tulip (new, on sale with the beer - it's a good day). Rich head, with a taste that tactfully holds back from all the sweetness in the aroma. Exceptionally clean feel and finish for such a tasty beer. Aftertaste leaves the mouth feeling clean, if not for the alcohol burn I would reach for another sip all too quickly. So glad I got the 4-pack."
"I'll start off by saying that I usually don't care for Tripels very much... that being said, I LOVED this beer.. It pours organish, very cloudy. the flavor is very organey/citrusy with some banana. The typical tripel spice/flavor is a bit subdued. Smell is typical of tripels but faint, def. has a bit of that spicey/fruitiness to it, though. IT is sweet and very easy to drink. The sweetness and such are not overpowering at all and leave you wanting more. Mouth is bubbley and light."
"A very refreshing and tasty brew with a lot of alcohol."
"Great flavor, great nose, and great feel. Light on the palette, without sacrificing taste. No strong alcohol taste, despite the alcohol content. Really subdued aftertaste, makes you to want to drink more to get back to that yeasty goodness. This is a really great quaff."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy gold with a fluffy white head. The head does not stay around long and does not leave any lacing. The aroma is fruity and spicy. The flavor is full of esters and spices. The beer is a medium bodied sipper that hides its alcohol well. IMO the beer is a bit overrated. While it is a solid triple I do not think it is that much better than some of the other triples I have enjoyed."
"Poured from a large bottle into a pint glass. Golden in color, with a head that lasted for a bit. Smell is yeasty with fruity tones. Also a noticeable hop bitterness. Taste is very complex. Fruit, spices, hop bitterness, alcohol. Amazing! I've never had a tripel before and this was a great introduction! Medium body. Very drinkable. The alcohol is very well masked, it's definitely there, but not unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination."
"Overall I'm disappointed in this beer. Had heard great things about it, but I just don't like it. Not really a fan of this style."
"I continue to try other Belgians and wheats, but I am not sure I will find a better flavor that continues to the end of the bottle."
"Poured a golden and hazy with a billowing head that dissipated into a thin head with nice lacing. I think I smelled a sour aroma with definite yeast as well. I defintiely tasted a citrus flavor with a slightly spicy characteristic. The mouthfeel was lively with a mild dryness. Really enjoyed this beer and will go back to it from time to time. Definitely a sipper at 9%"
"Pours pale, cloudy yellow into a goblet; the head is high, thin, white, and doesn't last, though enough lingers to leave lacing down the glass. The smell is straw, grain, fruit, and alcohol. The taste is biscuity, with some banana or papaya notes, giving way to a sharp alcohol burn followed by lingering hop bitterness. It's nicely carbonated, and thick enough to fill the mouth well without sticking in the throat. It's a sipper, for sure, but goes down quite pleasantly. A fine beer, though not my favorite of the style."
"Drinkability - Drinking this all night would not be a problem, at least until the next morning. A deceptively easy to drink beer."
"D - You'd never know this was 9%. Very smooth and enjoyable."
"The taste was slightly bitter as it went down, but the aftertaste had a pleasant sweetness. A fine flavor for a Belgian Tripel. The taste and the color make the high ABV of this beer slightly amazing."
"I would highly recommend this selection. Not quite a St Bernardus tripel, but a very nice runer up."
"Drinkablility- I only wish the bottle was bigger."
"Savor this one and drink it leisurely or just buy another and start a session. That 9% ABV creeps up on you because this is one sweet brew and I could definitely drink these all day! Without a doubt, this is a world class beer."
"Drinkability Very Very hard not to drink to fast. Can't down it to fast at 9% but I want to."
"(rated Feb 26, 2007)"
"Poured a wonderful goldish yellow coloration beer and came with a nice amount of foam. The sweet malt gives a great taste that was overwelming greatness that is just a makes it a wonderful flavoring. Overall it is a great beer to enjoy as the zest of lemon and pale malts just creates a wonderful impression."
"Drinkability: I could drink this until the end of the world..."
"If you want to turn someone on to this brewery, this is the beer to do it with."
"Their is a nice creamy feel to this beer with a good amount of carbonation. This is a tremendous beer which I could drink all night."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly spiced with spritzy carbonation tickling the tongue."
"Simply an excellent beer. Pours cloudy gold with a fat white head. Aroma is full of yeast and spice, with some lighter fruits. Perfect balance of malt, yeast, and spcie in the taste, with some hops for a nice bite in the end. One of the best, putting a lot of the brewed-in-Beligiums to shame"
"D-I need this one again! It's one of the more enjoyable Belgian brews that in which I have partaken. It's a very fun beer to drink and makes me excited to drink more high-quality Belgian ales."
"I remember liking this a lot more in the past, but maybe that was because I hadn't been exposed to the wide variety of US and Belgian brews that I know now. It's not my favorite Unibroue - prefer Maudite, Trois Pistole, and Terrible."
"Better results from 12 oz. bottles vs. a corked 750 ml. in this case, which is a bit at odds compared to most."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellow with a think wisp of a head. Smell is spicy with a clove/banana type of aroma. Taste is very reminiscent of a Hefe, but a tad spicier and beefier. 9% ABV is well hidden and this has superior drinkability. A great beer, I liked this one a lot."
"Poured this into a goblet, it bubbled forever. It has a lasting, creamy head. the color was golden with a slight cloudiness to it. The aromas were fruity and full nosed, with a slight hint of an alcoholic twang when I inhaled deeply. Sweet tasting but not overly so. A full bodied feel in the mouth, the carbonation tingles the tongue, the sweet fruity tastes are pleasurable and there is a slight alcoholic taste."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with a pure white foamy head. Small bubbles jet upward for days. Sweet, fruity aromas of watermelon and bit of bubblegum, also some yeasty notes in there in well. Taste explosion - it makes my head spin trying to comprehend it. I'll have to fill in the flavors on another bottle but for now suffice it to say that it's a 5 in the taste department. The medium body is perfectly lifted with the carbonation. Along with Trois Pistoles, this is one of tbe best beers I've ever had."
"D- Very good belgian tripel. If not for the poor scores I gave for appearance, this is right up there with the best trips I've drank. Also worth noting is how suprised I am that this beer is a product of Canada. CANADA??? Impressive!"
"D - High, since this is really delicious! Very well balanced and integrated throughout. Pretty complex. One of the best, if not the best of the non-Belgians."
"D: This is scary how drinkable this is at 9%. I will recommend this to everyone looking for a world class tripel"
"Or, ""The End of the World."" How could you not love this beer already? Out of a caged bottle at a beer tasting at the Fresh Market in Burlington this one was a pale yellow color. The head was two fingers of bright white foam that displayed good retention even as a skim and left streaks of nice lacing. The aroma was of lemon zest, dry wheat, floral hops and semi-sweet malt. The flavors were distinctly sweet, tart green apples, hints of pear, floral and citrus hops, some fruity alcohol esters that then finished on a tangy wheat note. The finish lingered but not unpleasantly. The carbonation and body were medium and the mouthfeel was quite smooth. Quaffable and pleasant yet punchy and refined, an impressive summery offering."
"Good beer, all around."
"High drinkability. Another deceptively strong one from Unibroue. A delicious brew that goes down smooth with little trace of alcohol."
"High quality tripel. Very easy to drink, made a good summer beer. Cloudy golden hue. Fruity, lemony smell. Taste is well rounded, fruity and spicey. Alcohol not very detectable. This isn't really my style but it's enjoyable. I just wish the Unibroue products were a little easier on the wallet."
"Overall an excellent example of the tripel style brewed in eastern Canada no less! Great beer and deserving of the great scores here. Try it."
"I'm glad I picked this up again since I don't thin I've had this since right when I started getting into craft beer. I think I enjoyed it a little more when I was just getting into it and my personal taste isn't really leaning towards Belgians in the long run but absolutely worth the buy."
"Ive been meaning to try this bad boy for awhile. Pours a hazy straw colour with a huge white fluffy head that quickly disappears. Citrus is the most prominent smell accompanied with a bit of malt. Taste matches the smell; nice sweet citrus with a very high amount of carbonation. Maybe this could explain why the 9% alcohol content is so well hidden. The first thing that I thought of when I tasted this was Mill St.'s Belgian Wit, just with more carbonation and a little more complex. This beer is very easy to drink considering its high abv. Overall, thought this was a very good brew just wish they lessened the amount of carbonation. This is a beer that I wouldnt have more than one in a night but would definately buy again."
"Pours a cloudy, golden-amber color with a thick frothy white head that dissolves into a lasting lacing. Aroma of apple, pear, grape, citrus and slight hint of alcohol. Very carbonatied up front with a fruity spiciness with hints of light crisp fruit and a sweet citrus finish."
"D - Drinkable beer, not a favorite, but good none the less"
"D: This one is too drinkable for your own good. With an ABV of 9% it still drinks like a session beer."
"This is a favourite that i keep on coming back to again and again. Insanely drinkable for a 9% brew. Has the typical Unibroue yeast-character but if you can't get past that, you're missing out! Recommended++!"
"3.5/5"
"Poured from a 750 mL corked bottle."
"Preface: I have enjoyed this beer for years, and having requested a case from brother Jer to celebrate my second son's birth (Michael Mark, 10lbs., 12 oz.), I revisit Unibroue's pride with a respectful confidence....thick, pillowy four-finger head froths the in THE La Fin Du Monde tulip... body is thick, orange/peach, and sediment-filled...tracings are like rhythmic ocean waves... flavorful, bright bouquet of yeast... hops are brisk and pleasant, with a slight citric injection... medium-bodied with a full finish--minimal alcohol presence, active but not obtrusive... reminiscent of the Schneider folk's brews--refreshingly clean, crisp, complex with clove, spruce, cinnamon, vanilla, watermelon, pear, and citrus ... palate-cleansing and complimentary to a host of foods--most notably these nachos! Cools and burns at the same time... an almost unbelieveable combination of refreshment and taste, readily causing amnesia at the thought this was ever a tripel at 9%....beautiful."
"An exceptional value in beer. At $6 for a 750-mL bottle, and less per oz for a four-pack of 12-oz, you won't do better. We can't buy it where we are right now (sigh), but we always buy out the store of this stuff when we go to the ""big city."""
"Pours a golden cloudy yellow-orange colored body, with a very large white head, and good lacing. Has an aroma of citrus, and hops. Smooth flavor, carbonated, and semi-bitter, but kind of flat(might be old). Has an acidic aftertaste. Tastiness."
"D: Very easy to drink, making it dangerous at 9%! An excellent cold weather beer."
"La Fin Du Monde is one of my favorite beers. It is not necessarily the best beer in the entire world, but it's widely available, comes in large and small singles and is a tremendous tripel, no mean feat. Unibroue beers have superb feel and delicious flavors. It's certainly the best tripel that I've tried that is not from Belgium. The beer has a somewhat inconsistent look. The head bubbles up, but it settles into a calm champagne look without much lacing. The misty liquid is quite appealing, on the other hand. The nose is earthy and spicy. It has a genuine Belgian flavor that is subtle and often lacking from American versions of Belgian styles. The flavor has this same Belgian earthiness, that quality that marks some of the best beers in the world. The feel is of a billion tiny needles gently exploding. The drinkability is incredibly high. This beer really made me a big fan of Unibroue. I've tried a lot of their styles and this one still stands as a top beer for Unibroue and craft beer, generally."
"At 9% ABV, a single person could drink all 75cl by ones self, but it's definitely best shared with a friend on a cold winter night. This is a very good tripel by the good brewers at Unibroue."
"Drinkability is good. A little too sour for my taste."
"Update: I get it now. After the first bottle of this I ended up craving another. I had another and then still wanted yet another. I'm going to review this beer again someday, and I think it might make it to ""world class"" in my world."
"Cheers!!"
"Taste: The taste is much like the smell with a nice pepper and alcohol spicy aftertaste."
"A good reminder as to why I really like tripels and glad to see a N. American brewery take on this style with so much success."
"Like so many Belgians, the high alcohol content will get to you. But if it was possible to drink this all night, I would."
"Exceptional in every way."
"I have to say I am not in love with this style. I have only tried a handful, but this is by far the most interesting. I recommend everyone try it once. It would be a nice change of pace to replace the bubbly to celebrate th new year. Cheers."
"D: expect the unexpected with this. while the beer is a delight, the biggest surprise to me was the complexity and pleasant character of finishing and aftertaste. balance is more to the sweet side and not much notable hop character. however, I would recommend this to my friends who like blue moon to expand their craft beer horizons."
"i buy this ruglarily and have tried it both fresh and aged, bottled and on tap and you simply cant go wrong."
"This stuff is for kings. Great beer. Pours blonde with a nice white head that could have better retention and lacing (like Duvel does). Smells and tastes fantastic - sweet and refreshing - very smooth and delicate. As the head died away, I wished every sip was like the first couple, though. I might open up my big Duvel after this for a back to back..."
"Delicious, addictive beer. Easy to drink, impressive to look at. And you can say you are drinking the end of the world."
"An excellent beer for those whose tastebuds like a little adventure."
"Drinkability isn't as up to par as the rest of the beer, but I don't mind."
"Pours an orange touched brown with a pillowy thick creme head. Nose is citrus, dough, and a minor funk. Flavor is an excellent mix of citrus, yeasty funk, sweetness, earth tones. It's all here. And in perfect harmony IMO. Feel has a full carbonation and the liquid is well bodied. This is an excellent beer. To have access to something so good at such a reasonable price is something that should be routinely taken advantage of."
"MF/D: On the lighter side with very high carbonation and a very low alcohol flavor if any at all. No heat from the alcohol either. Very nice tripel but with the high carbonation I could only drink a few."
"This was my second beer from Unibroue and both this and their Maudite have been excellent. I'm looking forward to trying more of their beers."
"Here's to hoping that the next 4 years are as awesome as this beer!"
"drinkability is amazing, as the flavors aren't overwhelming, the alcohol isn't overly apparent, and the mouthfeel is both tongue and heartwarming. The only drawback could be the carbonated thickness makes this one pretty filling... but that's far from a reason not to drink this one."
"This beer pairs wonderfully with a number of dishes and makes an especially great cheese pairing. While it drinks phenomenally fresh, it also ages exceptionally well. To speak matter of factly: Unibroue makes some of the finest Belgian ales outside of Belgium and 'La Fin Du Monde' is certainly amongst the best examples of a Belgian tripel."
"Cloudy caramel/yellow color. Fizzy head. Smell of a spicy apple juice. Some other sweet fruits in there. Tangy and sweet fruity taste. Peppery and spicy as well. Slight detection of alcohol. This is as good as it gets for a ""non-Trappist"" tripel. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Dangerous as its at 9% but incredibly smooth and well balanced."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable despite the high ABV, because everything just works so well together. I'm not sure what the right analogy is - is this the Porsche 911 of beers? That honor should probably go to a German brew, of course. In any event, I have made this beer a part of my regular rotation, and have nicknamed it ""Fin du Week"" because I like to reward myself with one on Friday (and I don't speak French)."
"Poured from a 750-milliliter bottle into a chalice. Has a nice brozenish/yellow colour to it. Has a very nice nose. Hints of cloves/spice and a hint of fruitiness. Fairly smooth, crisp taste but has a slight bitternes to it. Over all great beer, wonderfull winter warmer.(especially on a cold snowy evening)"
"D - Easy to drink.. gets better as it warms. The 9% is hidden well. But overall its to tangy and citrusy for my taste."
"Drinkability: Dangerously high for a 9% beer. As I said in the taste section, the alcohol taste is well hidden by the complex taste of this beer. Don't exaggerate too much on this one."
"M/D: Heavily carbonated but I think it went nicely with the style. The heavy yeast in this beer makes it hard for me to believe I could drink more than a couple, but it tastes so damn good, I can't tell for sure."
"Drinkable, not my favorite, but one to try once yearly."
"D - Although this is a very good brew, I would not recommend this as a session beer. Quite filling and has a high ABV."
"Notes: A classic, world class tripel from Unibroue."
"This is a style that I don't visit very often and am slowly developing an appreciation for. This seems like a solid example with a myriad of interesting flavors and aromas going on."
"D, notes: A very good tripel. Not overly sweet, clove phenolics are spot on."
"The high alcohol is definitely felt, but not overpowering. Bold through and through, this beer may not be a quaffer, but it is a wonderful beer experience."
"Available in both 12oz and 750ml bottles, I usually choose the 750ml bottles myself. Many a night has Fin put a smile on my face!"
"Drinkability for this one is very good."
"I like this tripel style and this beer makes me want to experiment more with other tripels. This beer is great and I'll give it more opportunities to grow on me."
"Pours cloudly yellow with thin white head. Smell - fruity, sweet and very much yeasty. Very nice smell actually. Taste is pretty much the same - yeasty, fruity. It's a strong beer but in the nice way. Very balanced. Very smooth. Easy to drink. Overall - it's a very good brew, excellent sipper, I truly enjoy it."
"Due to the 9% abv you might want to sip this with a really good meal."
"Golden bath with a high rise ivory head. No lacing, but there is an interesting fountain of bubbles rising from the center. A fruity aroma of apples and pears, with a gleam of hops, clove spice and bready yeast. A magnificent taste of fruits and spices and a light, very smooth mouthfeel that just barely conceals the alcohol. A world-class tripel that lacks the same complexity of premium Belgians of the style. I wish I would have taken greater advantage of Unibroue while I was going to school in Quebec."
"D: See above, I'd get it again, but it would be far from a top pick."
"If it were not for the 9% ABV I would sit and drink this all day. I think Unibrou hides their alcohol well - a sign of a truly gifted brewer. I will definately buy more of this excellent brew."
"D:"
"D- my favorite trippel, and something that would be much more sought after if the good people at Unibroue didnt make it available everywhere. i could easily finish the whole 750 by myslef, but at 9% abv wouldnt be able to take any more than that. theres a reason this makes the top 100 beers on planet earth. check this one out."
"The taste is very muted, mostly very subtle pears, winey grapes, light, soft yeasty grain. It has a warming alcoholic sweetness, fairly smooth with a light bitterness. It is light, zesty, and crisp at the same time that it is a bit almost oily soft and warming, which is an interesting point. The flavours, however, are subdued and it lacks richness or real complexity. There is a hint of some complexity, but the qualities seem so muted and muddled that not much is going on aside from alcoholic sweetness and tart, yeasty fruit."
"A cloudy orange with two finger head that leaves a lovely lace ring down the glass. A fragrant smell with some sweetness and something akin to citric notes in the smell. A ginger snap hit my tongue first in this medium-bodied beer. It also warms but is sweet and smooth and has that heavy and dark fruits taste that Belgians contain. Has a slightly dry backbite to complement the slickness the beer passes with over the tongue. This is one of the best beers around in any style, not just Tripels."
"Oh Nelly!!"
"This drinks at a very responsible pace. Not quickly but not too slowly. Matters, as it's a pleasure to enjoy. One of the best all-around offerings that has been given a ""good look"" in some time..."
"Drinkability: So fruity! A delicate, delightful tripel."
"D--For 9.0? Maybe the best!"
"Taste is yeasty, also consisting of acidic fruits. There is a quick, stinging bitterness to it. The alcohol is hidden nicely. Heavy carbonation with a medium body. The aftertaste makes is some combo of dry, yet sweet. This is my go-to Unibroue beer"
"This is clearly a quality beer, I'm just not sure its quite my type. Poured from a bottle, it boasts a powerful head. The color is golden and cloudy. The smell is dominated by the unique yeasts, as is the taste, which also boasts a bit of a hoppy flavor, at least to my palate. The dominating trait is the carbonation; I find it a bit overbearing. I'm not a huge fan of the taste, which is just a personal choice. I will say the the beer seems very much of good quality. I personally prefer something different."
"D: Easier to drink than some of the other tripels I have had, but the high alcohol content can seriously limit the ammount of these you could drink in a single session."
"Appearance is impressive--thick, champagne-like head with a cloudy gold color that seems to glow. It smells strongly of yeast, apples & cloves with hints of vanilla & spices, somewhat grassy. The taste is less apparent than the smell,--rather spicey, fruity, very little alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is crisp, strongly acidic. This is a drinkable beer that covers the high ABV almost too well, so pace yourself."
"this was a very aromatic beer from the start. nice head and fruity/spicey (cloves maybe ginger) smell as well as after taste. delightfully bitter and pretty strong as well. a nice color kinda cloudy but rich in color. i would say the mouth feel is very lively .a well firmented brew. drinkability is kind of slow after the 2cd one. but still over all very good . i really enjoyed this beer. i also enjoyed its sister.. maudite (pardon if misspelled). but thats another review."
"I was referred to this beer by a good friend who said it was right up my alley, which is most deffinately was. La Fin Du Monde deffinately has aromas and flavors I haven't tasted in most beers. I'm not the most educated beer advocate although this beer is a must try as well as other Unibroue beers."
"It has a reasonably crisp feeling in your mouth and is light bodied overall. Generally, I feel this is a good beer but a bit too much fruit for my palate."
"Overall - An excellent Tripel and almost up with the best of the Belgians... recommended..."
"Wow, I loved this beer. Drinking it reminded me of Christmas. You can definitely taste the coriander, which really gives it a spicy almost nutmeg on eggnog flavor. Wonderful smell and beautiful color. I really loved this beer and plan on having much more of it in the future."
"Overall, old Unibroue bottles are great. That's the second time I had a chance to have one (the other was Trois-pistoles) and both blew away the fresh ones. I tend to find their usual spiciness a bit overpowering and this fades away as they age."
"Overall: middle of the road for me, good but wouldn't seek it out."
"Smells floral at first, then hoppy. Great mouthfeel with natural carbonation just right. Very smooth drinking yet you can taste the higher alcoholic content. Had this at Walt Disney World - Epcot Canadian Pavillion and then had to buy some locally. Very good overall experience."
"Overall I'm glad I finally bought the beer that's been staring me in the face for so long. As good as any Trappist tripel and better than some."
"Prost!"
"Pours a cloudy golden/straw color with a rather large fluffy white head that sticks around for a while. Lots of carbonation here, I almost overflowed my glass. Aromas of bubble gum, fruity esters, spicy yeast, oh my this smells great! Taste is spicy, peppery but not over the top. A bit of alcohol lingers in the finish. Full body, prickly carbonation, almost creamy mouthfeel. Great brew! This was one of the first Belgian inspired beers that I tried oh so many years ago, I can't believe I'm just getting around to reviewing it now."
"D - This is one of those beer that I could drink way too fast its very easy to drink with a very good taste worth trying"
"This is probably one of my favorite beers of all time. Without a doubt the best triple I've tried so far."
"It is called a Tripel on BA, but I would call this one a BSPA.This is a world-class BSPA that is fairly easily accessable. Drink this one if you are just getting into Tripels, then drink De Dolle Du Teve when you are ready."
"Overall drinkability is also fantastic. With the ratings so high for everything else, how could drinkability be any less?"
"D: Like I said up front, this is one of my favorites! I could sip this one all night, but it is definitely a sipper."
"If you like this beer also try Unibroue's Don de Dieu"
"Drink by date is 04-03-11"
"I originally sampled this beer almost 4 years ago and didn't like it. I felt the need to re-visit it, especially since I have now sampled many more beers including Tripels. Pours a somewhat cloudy, thick, blonde color. Nice sized head that does fizzle down a bit. Strong aroma consisting of citrus bananas, cloves, vanilla and an overall strong alcohol presence. There's a lot there. The mouthfeel is pretty full although something seems a bit off with a tangy, somewhat sour, very yeasty, citrus (oranges and bananas) flavor. There is an alcohol rush in there so you know it's 9%. I've had other Tripels recently that are better, Karmeliet and Chimay Cinq Cents come to mind, but this is a better beer than I original though. 4 years ago I had said -- La Fin Du Monde does mean ""End of the World"" which is what's going to have to happen for me to ever try this crap again! Haha, Ok, so I lied. Just nearly 4 years."
"Drinkability is limited due to the high alcohol content. This is more a sipping beer than anything else. Everything about this beer is big, and I can't see having more than one or two in a single sitting."
"D: I cut my teeth on this so it does hold a special place in my heart. Now that I am grizzled I enjoy it more. I remember it tasting rough at time but now it is smooth thanks to me killing my palate."
"Man, this is some good beer. I picked up a four pack that 'expires' two years from now. It pours a very cloudy and dark blonde with a moderate head that disappears rather quickly. It left some lacing that looks nice on the glass. Smells and tastes fruity sweet with mild spice. It feels light in the mouth and a little bubbly. It goes down dangerously smooth and the flavor lingers for quite some time. I can't imagine myself enjoying a beer much more than I enjoyed this one. I had planned on drinking one but it was so damn good that I drank three, then fell into a wonderful comatose sleep. I will be buying more of this."
"D - Yesterday Maudite, today this, I live like a KING!"
"The beer is poured with a bronze colour and a decent inch head that seems to be filled with a lot of carbonation. The retention isn't very good, but that's alright for a triple. The nose on the beer is beautiful, it is fruity and loaded with complexity and spices. The most prevalent fruit is a citrus flavour. The beer tastes of citrus with some spices; what makes this beer the best is the sweet citrus flavour. The citrus flavour is mixed with some other flavours I can't pick up on. The mouthfeel is carbonated and creamy. This beer is drinkable as hell."
"Drink up!"
"M,D: The active carbonation leaves the mouthfeel superb, and the hiding of the alcohol makes this very, very drinkable!"
"Ahhh...Champagne memories. Flan, sweet custard, blended lychee on a cripsy bed. Subtle sweetness and remarkably thirst quenching...all the while inebriating with a 9%; you will never know it is there. A river of tang that flourishes in all aspects of its character."
"Overall, an excellent Tripel, and one that I think holds up nicely against even the finest examples from Belgium. Recommended."
"This beer is absolutely world-class and I could either drink one every night or a series of them in one night. Thanks to the local beer store (Wine and Cheese in Clayton) for marking these down last week, or I would have waited even longer before trying it."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, white head fades out quickly, leaves minimal lacing on the glass, and an astronomical amount of particles floating in the beer. Smell is juicy pears, some spicy clove, yeast, apples. Much more apple in the taste, spicy peppery notes, more sweet pear. Tart, drying, borderline puckering at times, but really refreshing. I have officially fallen in love with this style, and with this beer in particular. Delicious."
"Th beer poured a great hazy orange color with a light white head that dissipated farly quickly. The aroma was light but with the belgian accents you would expect, sweet, slightly malty, some spices and I swore that I smelled peppermint. The taste was excellent, the citrus and spices dominate the flavor and the alcohol is slightly noticeable. The beer had good carbonation and was light but smooth and very drinkable. I will definately be going back to the store for more of these. Overall, an excellent beer, highly recommend."
"Was able to pick up a four pack instead of the bombers which are typically offered. Sampled this on a few separate nights and had a couple tonight before, during, and after dinner. I'm a fan of Unibroue's darker Belgian Styles but this is an excellent Tripel and quite possibly my new favorite of their brews. Strong malty aroma with a nice earthiness and spicy accents. Great pour, orange-yellow dark in the middle and lighter around the edges with a monster of a head. This beer couldn't be smoother and a pleasant finish with a slight alcohol burn is perfect for me. Hearty flavor huge malt presence with some spicy goodness. Slight citrus tops off a marvelous brew. Overall this is near the top on my list."
"D - Pretty enjoyable and I know a lot of people love it but I personally think there are better examples of the style"
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is fine making for easy drinking, but alcohol is pushing the high end restricting it a bit."
"Without question a very delicious quality brew and very deserving of all the accolades. ABV makes for having only a couple in a setting but I would be willing to test the limits on that."
"D - VERY easy to drink - the alcohol is well hidden. Nicely balanced and an excellent representation of the style."
"Drinkability: Well done. There are better Tripels but not many in the Western Hemisphere can top this one."
"Served in my DT tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a 1.5 inch bright white, tight cap that eventually settled into a consistent slick of foam. Sheets of sticky lacing coated the glass throughout the tasting. Scents of spices and wheat. Flavors of lemon zest, pepper, coriander, yeast and alcohol. Green apple and pear were expressed as the brew warmed. Mouthfeel is very lively with a residual tingle that lingers between quaffs. Consistency is between light- and medium-bodied. What more can be said about this tripel; an excellent brew to slowly sip as the world comes to an end around you."
"I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes beer, very finely crafted and a fantastic brew overall. ""the end of the world"" this would be in my fridge during an armageddon!"
"D-Could easily have this around all the time one of the best balanced tripels i have ever had."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a big, frothy 2 finger head that melted into a thin layer on top of the beers surface. A steady line of carbonation shot up steadily rejuvenating the head. The aroma is citrus, lemons and oranges, up front with hints of clove and banana coming through. The taste is really sweet. Just a bit to much for me. It really overpowers the other flavors in the beer. I find it quite a bit distracting. Notes of vanilla, oranges and clove come through also. The mouthfeel is full bodied but still light on the tongue. While triples are not my favorite style, I definitely think I might have another one after this."
"Not one to drink a pitcher of mind you but it's by far one of my favourites. The few times I am able to treat myself to one, I get immensely nostalgic for my time spent living in Quebec and proudly recommend this beer to everyone who likes a good beer"
"Overall - I bought this particular one from a Unibroue variety pack that included one each of all of their year-round brews. I must say this is one brewery that makes nearly all exceptional beers. La Fin Du Monde is a great Tripel style ale and everyone should try this at least once."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a pale yellow with a BIG head and alot of carbonation. Smell is sweet and spicy. Taste includes a mixture of spices and some fruit. This beer had way too much carbonation for me to thoroughly enjoy. Made me burp after every sip. Still, a good tripel."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed and it was a little lighter than what I had expected"
"Hard for me to rate this one good on the drinkibiliby...maybe I just am not in the mood for this beer right now?"
"Beautiful beer. for 9% it is very easy to drink, and doesn't overpower in taste any direction."
"Drinkable?> Oh dear, yes. Mmmm"
"Drinkability: Very balanced, dry, complex, with high (though well hidden) alcohol. A classic tripel, and one that any self-respecting beer drinker should seek out at least once."
"750 ML corked bottle. Pours a dark hazy straw color. Sweet and sticky beer. Tastes like vanilla cake,citrus,apple, and bread. Very bubbly. Light bitterness on the finish. Good Triple but not the greatest. I'd take the Maudite or Trois Pistoles over this one."
"Everyone should try this beer at least once."
"So, I need to work on this one. It is a superb beer with immense complexity and I don't think my words scratched the surface of its being. I'll try at this one again in the future."
"Beer poured a dark-hazy orange-yellow, very deep hue. Smelled of fruits, cloves, and earthy spiced grains. The taste was majestic! It tasted slightly of either orange or fig, with a peppery undertone, perhaps some coriander, as well? I think there was a hint of ester of banana too. The alcohol bite was hidden well, smooth and effervescent with champagne-like bubbles. my favorite Unibroue, is still either Quelquechose or Ephémère, however. That takes nothing away from this one though."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good creaminess. Carbonation is quite fast paced as it rushes down with each sip. Overall, a very enjoyable triple that also packs a bit of a punch as well. A couple bottles and I'd be feeling quite nice."
"Highly recommended, there is always room for this beer in my fridge."
"This is one of my favorite tripels. Unibroue makes some great beer and this is another winner. For 9% ABV it's so drinkable it's dangerous."
""
"Wonderfully drinkable. Absolutely enjoy every sip."
"The beer pours a cloudy yellow golden color with an inch of nice white foam on top. The aroma and the taste is definitely Belgian. Fruit, clove, yeast, and sweet malt in the nose. Those same characteristics blend into the slightly medium bodied palate. Malty, fruity, and sweet up front complemented by cloves. This follows through to peppery alcohol notes in the finish along with a light layer of hops. A good beer. One of my favorite tripels, complex but not too sweet."
"Very drinkable! I wish Unibroue would import some more"
"D. Very enjoyable, have had it before and will have it again. The 9% is well masked."
"D: Easiest drinking Triple I've had. I think I still prefer Maudite and Trois Pistoles over this beer personally, but as far as Triples go, this is easily one of my favorites."
"I can't believe i never reviewed one of these yet, BBD 10-10-10, pours a cloudy yellow-gold w/ a white head that sticks around for a little while before coating my snifter with broken lacing ; a bready malt and cracker-like aroma laden w/ hot spice, some fruity esters, floral hops and alcohol present as well ; spicy, tart and bready taste up front, well balanced w/ hops, a bit metallic w/ a semi-dry, peppery and alcoholic finish ; a rich, creamy med.-full body, abundence of co2 ; a great beer, drinkable as hell for a 9% ABV tripel, tho the ""Unibroue spice"" gets to be a bit much in this one after a while compared to their other brews, i still love it..."
"M/D: Highly carbonated and a high alcohol feel light and easily drinkable as very pleasurable to drink."
"D: 9% hurts a bit, but it's still flavorful, crisp, and refreshing. Really a wonderful spring or summertime beer."
"D - Great flavor makes this easy to drink. THowever, high abv and the body is capable of being filling. Still, it's so good that it's still fairly easy to drink"
" This is an amazing brew overall. Very complex smells and flavors are found with every sip. Even towards the end of the glass I struggle to connect what I am tasting to other tastes and smells so I'm just going to give up and simply say that this is an excellent example of a tripel that I would gladly have any time."
"D: Given the 9.0% ABV this one will knock you out fairly quickly if you're not paying attention. Incredibly flavorful, and incredibly dangerous. I'd be willing to risk it just to keep tasting it!"
"D- overly drinkable, way to tasty and perfumey to even put the glass down, this could easily have me wandering toward the end of the earth and forgetting my way home. potent stuff, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden."
"Overall an incredibly easy drinking beer. A beautiful mix of sweet and sour with that delightful crispness."
"Notes: Outstanding and wonderfully complex with great drinkability."
"Unibroue La Fin Du Monde pours a dense opaque peach with a short fuzzy head. The smell is medium to strong of yeast. I don't typically like yeasty beer, but this has a fabulously smooth and slightly sweet yeast like flavor. Mouthfeel is really good, sporting a silky smooth feel that changes into a very unique foam like character with a swish. Overall this was quite enjoyable the whole way through. A good standard for what a yeasty flavored beer should be."
"This pours a pretty golden-orange, fairly clear, not a lot of head. Aroma is malty with a strong hint of citrus. Flavor is strong and malty and has some hoppy hints. Finish is smooth and refreshing. This is an insidious beer, though, as you don't taste the alcohol, so it can sneak up on you."
"Poured this into a tulip, pours a pale yellow in appearance with little bubbles of carbonation and a serious white head that leaves a bit of lace. You get the nice sweet smells of fruit and honey in the nose, this is a beer that has amazing aromas. Taste is differnt as it warms up, when its chilled its a sweet tangy tart of fresh ripe fruits with a bit of apple, pear, grapes, as this masterpiece warms the bread spice comes with a hint of a clean alcohol finish. I have to give it up for Unibroue they are an amazing brewary, they produce amazing products."
"This beer truly stands atop the summit of all brews and should be tried by all beer drinkers once."
"D - Not bad considering it's ABV. A little bitter and and pretty high on the yeast (which is a strong and strange-ish flavor to say the least), but I could definitely let a couple of these sneak up on me."
"D- I've decided that this is a very near perfect beer, but it is full bodied....that and the fact that I had 3/4 of a litre and I've had as much as I can handle for a night. This would definately be enjoyable with an old cheddar cheese. I recommend this beer for anyone who truly enjoys the finer brews in life and think this would be a great beer to celebrate with! With that said though, this beer is, in my opinion, a sipping beer and a single bottle would suffice for an entire evening."
"Drinkability is supreme for me, as good as it gets for the style. Big taste, but smooth and dangerously easy drinking...factor in the fact that Unibroue brews are such a great low price, this one should get a 5.5!"
"The most impressive thing about this very impressive beverage (which can hold a candle to a Tripel Karmeliet any day) is the aroma: beautifully complex, with phenolic, medicinal organic components and yeast and fruity malt. You definitely want to inhale before imbibing. On the palate you travel from initial sweetness to lingering slightly bitter end-notes. The beer has a lot of carbonation: it expresses in lively fashion from the bottle and continues the bead in the glass, but feels quite soft on the palate."
"Very drinkable considering the abv. I'll be back to this one."
"750mL bottle into a Tripel Karmaliet glass. Pours a nice hazy straw yellow with a frothy head that is slow to diminish and leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma is an amazingly fragrant blend of spice, yeast and sweet fruits. The taste is a wonderful blend of sweet fruits from the malts and citrus hops with a nice bit of spice to round things out. The beer is crisp and refreshing with some alcohol presence, but not 9% worth. This is a truly wonderful beer that is somewhat hard to believe was actually brewed in Belgium."
"Never had a tripel better than this one. Too easy to drink and so delicious, I cherished this glass of beer. On to the next Unibrue!"
"Pours orange-gold with a frothy head. Aroma of straw, banana, yeast, citrus, and spice. Taste is the same. Relatively low carbination. Finish is clean and slightly bitter. Has very nice balance, and the beer is interesting from start to finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. An excellent triple."
"Tripels usually are not my beverage of choice, so drinkability is affected, but it the best Tripel I've had to date. Highly recommended for this style."
"Definitely a regular buy for me since it is sold in small shop everywhere here."
"No trace of the potent alcohol, pas de tout, in this beer I find simply magnificent. My first Unibroue offering, too. Extremely impressed. Outstanding. Awesome. Kickass. Irony in the circumstances in my and the previous poster's review :)"
"D- A sipper beer and very strong. A six pack of this would be hard to put down. Two of these and i would be 'golden' for the night. a very nice triple with good flavor."
"Blew my expectations out of the water. It reminded me of a wheat beer and didn't have any alcoholic edge to it. In a word ""beautiful"""
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, and despite its sweetness, it's not cloying at all. There is a very noticeable alcohol warmth to it, but in a good way. I would definitely have another."
"D - A great tripel. Comparable to St. Bernadus."
"750ml bottle poured into my Leffe Goblet. Pours a cloudy golden brown with two finger head. Sweet to the scent and tastes even sweeter. Highly enjoyable beverage. Another winner from Unibroue, I'm yet to taste one of their offerings that I haven't liked."
"overall, probably my favorite Tripel, a well crafter beer."
"Very drinkable, one of the best tripels I have ever tasted..perhaps even richer than my original favorite from St Bernardus. Well done."
"Overall, a great drink. One of my favorites."
"D: for the price I can see myself drinking this quite often, this is my first Unidroue experience and I think I will try other products"
"I tried this beer on December 21, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a murkey golden brown with a generous white head. The aroma was a combinaion of malt and plums. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with high carbonation. The favour was spicy, malty, and slightly bitter."
"Pours a beautiful hazy amber with a fluffy white 1.5 finger head, which settled to a thin layer after a few sips. Leaves a smattering of lace down my Chimay goblet's interior. An amalgam of various fruits and the slightest hint of booze in the nose. Delightful pear, apple and banana notes come to the fore with the first sip, along with a bready/yeasty goodness. Taste finishes with a sparing tinge of herb. Medium viscosity gives this beer a very interesting feel...has a light creaminess to it that perfectly matches its other characteristics. 9% you say? I wouldn't believe you if I wasn't finishing up the bottle. Alcohol is wonderfully (and dangerously) masked. I don't know that I could drink a whole lot of this stuff because it's not exactly light, but it's a great pleasure to drink just one."
"D - A great tasting Tripel that almost everyone can find nearby. Always a good choice, but probably not my favorite of teh style. Alcohol is remarkable deceiving."
"This is a really good dark Belgian beer. Maybe the best I have tried that is not from a monastery. If you get a chance try this beer as soon as you can. Here is my opinion of taste - sweet initial taste goes down nice and smooth. You knew from the warm feeling that you have a ""strong"" beer, but you would not know it from the taste."
"I love this beer, even the packaging is beautiful. But when it hits the glass it looks like liquid gold. Slightly hazy with a pillowy white top that slowly drops down leaving sticky patches all over the glass, it begs to be enjoyed. The smell is fruity, like overripe peaches, and just a little boozy. The taste is sweet nectar. Light and fruity to open, given way to a slight yeasty flavor, while the great carbonation keeps it crisp. The alcohol is very well hidden, just an afterthought of the sip. One of my top beers."
"excellent tripel. Pours a murky straw color. Smell is citrusy and sweet. Taste builds on the scent adding floral notes. Gets a little bready when warmer. Does finish with some hops making tie whole sip a fulfillng jouney. Dollar for dollar, one of the best of its style, in my opinion."
"D: Vry tasty with a refreshing quality, absolutely drinkable. Greatness in a beer."
"This is the best beer coming out of Canada."
"Ordered a bottle last Saturday at Charlie's Kitchen in Harvard Square. It was poured into a Duvel chalice. Huge white head formed up the side of the glass. The color was school bus yellow. The smell was spicy and bready. Taste-wise, what a knock out. It's everything you could ask for in a tripel. Light, full of body and flavor, very drinkable yet just enough alcohol punch to let you know that you are drinking a quality beer. This beer easily has to be one the the best tripels made anywhere outside of Belgium. A shining star in the Unibroue portfolio."
"Poured into a snifter; it had a thick off white head about three fingers wide that was very bubbly with some lacing as well; the body itself is a hazy light golden/brownish color and has some good carbonation going on as well. It has a strong sweet aroma with lots a citrus smells like lemons and oranges. It has a good semi crisp feel on the tip of your tongue, it smooth overall with a medium body and leaves a faint hint a residue in your mouth. Its got a clean taste that's sweet and spicy and is followed up with a semi dry aftertaste with a little bit of bitterness in it."
"Another fine Unibroue offering. I cannot decide whether I prefer this or Don de Dieu, which is similar but with a somewhat wheat-y and slightly more citrus-y character. But this is good stuff. Cloudy amber glow, froths nicely during the pour with the head settling down to a 1/8 foam top after a couple of minutes. Complex, spicy notes to the nose that are well represented on the tongue. Slick mouthfeel with a bitter follow-through. One of my favorites."
"This is one of the best tripels out there, I'll dropkick anyone who disagrees with me."
"One of my favourite beers out there. If you're looking for something new and good, try this. It's a bit more expensive than the regualar case of beer by a few dollars but will be well worth it. It is one of those beers that after tasting it, none others are ever as good and will be constantly compared to it. It is the perfect drink to have with some good food or just alone in a nice setting. One of the most incredible things about it, is that it has such a great taste that it actually masks the 9% abv and will leave you wanting more all night. It also looks nice and has a nice feeling on the tongue. Cannot go wrong with this. The only problem with it is finding it sometimes in stores."
"Pours a copperish color with massive two inch head. Smell is heavy in phenol aromas with some maltiness too. Goes down extremely smooth with pure maltiness here.Taste is extremely complex with malts, phenols, and yeasty flavors all balanced. Overall this a decent triple, which is saying a lot since I don't care much for triples."
"The taste was again yeasty and spiciness which could not be named. In the mouth there was a bitterness on the finish which was nice. It was moderately to highly carbonated. One of the best Tripel's to date."
"This was the first micro brew I ever tried. It was at a coffee house in Orlando. This beer single handedly got me into the love of fine beers. Thank you Unibrau! Poured a cloudy goldish color with a nice head. Smelled heavenly with a mixture of raisons, candied fruit, apples, and dried apricots. Taste was spectacular with upfront fruit and spice and mild floral hop undertones. I just sipped away at this beer and listened to some great rifs on my friend's acoustic guitar."
"Super smooth with toned down alcohol and delicious pear, peach, and apple flavors, crisp herbal hops, and light fruity yeast. The vegetal flavors that occasionally sneak in with this brew are nowhere to be found. This beer is drinking excellently right now and it's hard to believe it will improve much more. Probably my favorite tripel, and I have been drinking a lot of Belgians (somewhat fresher but still with some time on them) lately."
"Big fan of triples and have herd nothing but great things of this beer. Pours a cloudy golden pretty much hefweizen in appearance. Head builds and dispates. Smell is exceptional. smashed fruits, alcohol soaked breads, malts, citrus, fresh cut grass and cedar. I could go on of about the complexity of this beer in terms of smell and taste very good. Taste is flowers fresh cut herbs very earthy in many aspects. Very drinkable the flavor of this beer hides much of the alcohol tones. Top ten beers of all time in my opinion simply beautiful."
"Wow. A truly remarkable beer in many ways. It pours your typical, slightly evervescent yet appealing pale body, and great lacing. The smell is malty, but sweeter than most of the style. From here, it only gets better with incredibly smooth complexity and a mouthfeel that has a great substance and presence but yet light with a cloud-like presence. Simply put, the most drinkable Tripel I've had. Exceptional."
"Tried this one at an informal tasting my friends and I threw ourselves. This was one of the highlights for most of those attending. Pours a nice deep honey colour, a little cloudy, with moderate head and lacing. The smell was warm and fruity with some strong spicy notes (even though it's not a heavy, wintry beer, the smell reminds me of X-mas timea bit). Mouthfeel was appropriately fizzy for a fruit flavoured drink, IMO. The taste borders on being sweet, but the spices stop it before it becomes too much. To me, to be perfectly honest, it doesn't really taste like my conception of what a beer should be; I'm not sure why exactly. Some of the people I was with declared it their favourite of the evening; I don't agree with this, but it was a fine beverage nonetheless."
"D= Really enjoyed this one. Just great, balanced complexity. Lots of things going on, and they all fit very well. Doesn't feel too heavy, and the alcohol is well hidden (until you stand up), so there's definitely a danger of having too many of these."
"Drinkability: One of my favorites. Delicately complex yet easily enjoyed. The alcohol is buried and always leaves you wanting more."
"Best beer I've had in ages. A+ to the French Canadians."
"D: this beer packs quite a potent punch (more so because of its spiciness than its alcohol - the 9% ABV is very well hidden, making it quite drinkable. Good complexity and it ignites all the senses - very satisfying. I look forward to another one soon."
"Also, whats up with the screw on caps on the bottles of this beer... thought that was BMC quallity..."
"Drinkability - though the tripel is not my favorite style, I found this to be a good sipping beer and a fine choice to help me get through the last week of winter 2008."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a huge, thick white head. Great retention, head never fully disappears. Aroma is fruity, with bananas and spice. Taste is of clove, pepper, fruit, and a bit of a grassy finish. Good beer but not up there with St. Berny's tripel in my opinion."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid tripel with good proportioning and great character. cheers!"
"d - I'll have to try the westmalle tripel again because I gave it a great review, yet it reads the same as this one. This beer is great, but the lack of a decent head and aftertaste keeps it from being spectacular."
"La Fin Du Monde pours a golden yellow with a very nice, white head. It smells very sweet, with hints of corrainder, some spices, and some earthy tones as well. It tastes very good. I picked up a lot of the stuff I smelled, with a combination of fruits and cloves. This is very is easy to drink, and the 9% abv is very well-masked, making this brew even more enjoyable in you like high alcohol beers."
"This poured a hazy light gold with white head. It smelled like yeast and grapefruit hops. It tasted like a blend of citrus hops and cultured yeast, with a hint of malt. It was oily and carbonated with a lasting lemon aftertaste. Overall this wasn't bad, but I'm still not a fan of the light Belgian ales."
"HV"
"Those Canucks sure do know how to brew some tasty beer. Carbonation is a little overkill at first but let this bad boy warm up a little bit and it will open into a perfect balance of fruit, spice, and everything nice. Dry, crisp, smooth and refreshing."
"D: The definition of. Extraordinarily drinkable. ABV be damned!"
"This is a pretentious beer and I'm not impressed. What more can I say? I'll drink it again, but I won't buy it again."
"I want to take a bottle of this camping this summer!"
"D- Pretty easy to drink once you get the ball rolling. Be careful, the alcohol will creep up on you."
"Drinkability. Not really. Maybe if I liked this style more. Apparently a lot of people think this is wonderful, but it doesn't do much for me."
"Drinkability- Be careful, as the 9% is in this beer somewhere. I intend on this being a staple in my fridge from now on."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with big white head which recedes nicely to 1 finger's width, then remains there throughout. Great retention and sticky lacing. Smells great; honey, clove, lemon, banana, fruits, yeast, wheat and a touch of peppercorn. Tastes sweet,tart and fruity; honey, clove, coriander, caramelized banana, grape, pear, apples, lemon, pineapple, and wheat with just a touch of yeastiness and even less of alcohol. Medium in body and well balanced, smooth with a crisp finish, good carbonation with bubbles dancing on the tongue. A great beer with lots of flavor, hides alcohol very well, and is very drinkable, a good choice even for those who don't necessarily care for tripels."
"D: High only if you like a strong beer which I prefer."
"Notes: If one can find this,it should be bought. It is one for the ages and truly remarkable."
"d: The carbonation is a bit off, but overall this is an outstanding beer."
"Taste is similar to the smell, in that this is a very fruity beer with a good tartness to it, strong citrus presence along with the tartness, carbonation is a bit high but I also expected it to be even higher, very crisp."
"D: I think something is to be said about the long tradition of brewing the belgians have perfected... unibroue has a good beer on their hands... it just needs a few tweaks..."
"Pours a hazy golden in color with a thick white head. Smells of Belgian sugars and yeast. Also a citrus type odor. Very smooth, balanced and refreshing. A slight, flavorful tartness, that takes away the potential for a sweet and strong alcohol taste. A highly balanced and drinkable beer. A fine Belgian outside of Belgium."
"Very flavorful beer, with 9% abv. it has all the good traits of the European Tripel beers. Good for special occasions."
"One of the most explosive beers I've ever poured - at only a drip's pace - lively carbonation races up the sides of the glass! The bubbles don't stop there, as the robust head continues to grow for a minute or two and ever so slowly begins to deflate into an off-white silken custard, scarcely down to three-finger's width before I must indulge in the first take. A zesty nose of cherries married with citrus, on my palate comes a hint of pineapples and pear. Extremely well balanced, especially considering its 9% abv. Playful on the tongue, strong but sweet, a definite refresher with a hidden strength that will sneak up on ya! ;]"
"This beer was highly carbonated, but medium bodied and very crisp. I got a slight warming sensation from drinking it and found myself highly refreshed."
"Flavors are clove, pepper, and a mild fruitiness. A lot drier than I anticipated. Just a hint of alcohol. Medium body with good carbonation that finishes clean. High ABV makes it a slow drinker and limits drinkability."
"Tasted on 2/24/08."
"DRINK - 1"
"La Fin Du Monde is a great Tripel and a great Belgian Strong in general. I'll have to go back and sample La Maudite somewhere and see if I can claim one as my favorite over the other."
"d: for me this is not the most flavorful tripel but still a very good offering with some interesting and complex flavors"
"D: Pretty textbook tripel but not quite as good as the Belgian types. Probably the best from this side of the atlantic."
"Pours an attractive orange/golden color with beautiful white head that stayed for a while. Aroma is of fruit and is sweet. The flavor is sweet and fruity up front that gives way to a peppery spiciness. Mouthfeel is good and the 9%alcohol is not evident until this beer is consumed. A really nice beer that is meant to be savored."
"I'll put some of these down in the cellar. I think it will mature nicely."
"Overall - Very popular among us craft drinkers, and deservedly so."
"D - A very good brew from Unibroue. Drinkability is high. I will be having this one again in the near future."
"Thank you Unibroue."
"D= This is my favorite beer from one of my newest favorite breweries. I consider it one of my ""staple"" beers and highly recommend it."
"It's an impressive beer to be coming out of Canada, in the sense that it isn't from Belgium! I look forward to trying other beers from Unibroue."
"D: My tastes have definitely matured. 6 months ago I can say without a doubt that I would have hated this. It's still not my favorite but I can definitely appreciate it."
"Tantalizing the tongue with notes of banana, plum and Irish soda bread, La Fin is so exceptionally drinkable and tasty that it's easy to forgot that it sours a bit towards the end of the glass. Yet, for the first 3/4 of a pint, this is an almost perfect replication of Belgian's finest ales."
"Will the head on this brew ever die?!? The thick, white foam that formed on this pouring of La Fin du Monde remained practically intact until the last sip was consumed! One has to peek underneath to examine the cloudy orange hue of this Canadian beer. The aroma is slightly underwhelming, but notes of spices and citrus are noticeable. Aspects of wheat are also (interestingly) present. The taste is light but complex: there are flavors of bright citrus and lighter malts-darker malt characteristics are present during the lingering aftertaste. What kills me the is smoothness of the mouthfeel; all the carbonation must be in the head! It nearly drinks like water, which is dangerous from a calorie/alcohol perspective."
"Pours a hazy golden orange-yellow with a big frothy off-white head. Smells of grains and tart fruits. Citrusy nose deepens with complex spice notes. Taste is herbal and fruity, with a light crispness flavored with spice and yeasty fruitiness. Very clean taste, lightly sweet, full flavored yet mild. Fruits decay to a nice yeasty aftertaste. Medium body and smooth on the palate. Soft full carbonation lends a creamy, slightly crisp feel. I'm a little scared of how drinkable this is. Watch out for the 9%abv. Overall a great tasting very drinkable version of the style. Not too strong in any sense of taste or smell."
"A wonderful Tripel that holds up to any other of the style that I've had."
"Very cloudy light tan with big white head and big lace. Sour hop aroma with crisp yeasty wheat. Sour tart lemon wheat flavor. Typical belgian strongish alcohol with a hint of licorice and biscuit. Great lively carbonation, good feel, average drinkability. I'm not a Belgian convert yet but i can see the quality of these beers as evidenced here. Not bad."
" Drinking most of this French-Canadian breweries beer is an experience that I can't recommend enough, and La Fin Du Monde is a brilliant example of their craft and skill. If this is the end of the world, then I really do feel fine."
"Overall- It's a great example of the style. I really like that it's so readily available and fairly priced."
"A superb example of a Canadian triple. So complex yet one of the most drinkable brews around."
"I could see this beer swaying BMC drinkers over to be beer advocates!"
"lol, way back in the day, before i even knew what a tripel was or that belgians even made beer, my friend and i would drink these out of the bottle in our dorms, saying, ""damn, this is one bomb ass wanna-be malt liquor!"""
"Drinkability is good for a 9% abv, although after one i had heartburn so that was my limit."
"A reliable favorite."
"Smells a lot like champaign with some hops. Pretty looking. Murky deep yellow with a white head that has excellent lacing. Taste is okay, but a bit off in the finish (don't like, what appears to be a peppery spice/apple taste). Finish has an alcoholic touch to it. Good, but not as good as I expected."
"D - I guess you could drink more than one, the fellas I was with did, but for me one was perfect. Recommended."
"750 ml bottle, poured into a Duvel tulip. Golden in color with a billowing white head. Nice retention and lacing. Aromas of soft esters with a spicy zing. Flavors of fleshy fruits like pear and apple, with some clove and pepper spiciness. With warmth, yeast becomes a prominent note. A bit high on carbonation, but overall quite smooth. Alcohol is hidden under the fruitiness. Body is medium."
"There are few beers a drinkable as this one. You barely notice that it is 9%. A true Gem, and a regular beer at this house."
"PS: After having 200+ beers, I figure I'm qualified enough to start reviewing. I definitely picked a winner to start with."
"Body is a lighter golden color, lots of little bubbles dancing around. Topping that is a big white head. Lots of malt on the nose, sweet candy, hints of citrus. The taste explodes on the tounge. Big sweet malt front, followed by some spicyness. Fair amount of hop, some fruit tones. Warm alcohol eventually shows up. A great mouthfeel. Very tasty and quite refreshing. Nice."
"D: Drinkability was incredibly good, with a vast complexity of fruitiness from the yeast. The 9.0% abv was hardly noticeable as this beer drank like a dream. Fulfilling at one drink, but easily drinkable in multiples until the alcohol catches up to you."
"M + D: Somewhat expressive, with a good zip of carbonation... and crisp. A medium body on there that makes for an easier drink. Sipping moderately, the flavours linger in the mouth to be savoured for some time in between. A fine drink, and one I'd like to keep on hand for social occasions."
"This is an awesome beer, one that I would drink all the time if I could."
"D: Very easy to drink despite high alcohol content, I would sip this beer forever if it weren't for the fact I'm poor and need a break to sip some Trois Pistoles."
"D - More please! A great canadian take on a belgian 3x strong, eh? You betcha."
"This one live up to, and exceeded, the hype."
"I rated this somewhat lower than other Unibroue beers I've had not because it's somehow worse, but rather because it lacks some of the bolder character that its compatriots from Unibroue has. Still, a darn fine beer that won't disappoint."
"Slightly hazy and orangish dirty-blonde in color, with a large fuzzy, bubbly white head. The smell is a bit sweet of caramel, with bushels of tart fruits and yeasty spice. The taste synch's with the smell nicely. Belgian candy sugar sweetness is light in comparison to tart green apples, pears, and lemony citrus. Bread-like maltiness continues to fill the body, and yeasty, light pepper spiciness closes this one out. Medium bodied with loads of fresh carbonation lead to a bubbly, yet creamy mouthfeel. This is my first--and a quite good offering--from Unibroue. It is not the equal of the Bernardus triple I recently had and, while I have not yet taken on the Westmalle, Karmeliet, or other big dog's of the style, it still seems a very good beer."
"La Fin Du Monde pours a golden blonde color with rapidly aspirating bubbles fleeing toward the frothy head. There is lots of action and eye appeal. The aroma is strongly suggestive of fruit - apples and grapes. The taste is of apples, with warming alcohol and yeast coming through. Carbonation s prevalent. While entirely pleasant, something is missing in intensity to make this an exceptional Belgian-style trippel."
"The flavor is wonderful too. Touch of maltiness, slight notes of cardamom, enough bitterness to just balance it, the alcohol even adds a nice note! I love this beer and have started keeping a few on hand at all times. I find the drinkability to be excellent as well despite the strength. Truly a world class brew!"
"D - I could easily drink two or three of these in a sitting. A strong but very drinkable 9%"
"It poured a cloudy golden color with a real frothy head. The head dissipated in about 5 -7 seconds. I took a big sniff and smelled of light fruit, possible apple and wheat. The first sip tasted of apples and something else that I couldn't just put my finger on...almost creamy like. A very enjoyable triple style beer. I enjoyed every last drop. Don't know what I'll try next from Unibroue but I'm sure I'll enjoy it."
"pours very pale gold, with a haze, and a nice, dense white head that lingers to the end. Aroma is all fruit, with very faint hints of white pepper. Big time tutty-fruity bubble gum! Flavor is very sweet. Sweeter than the last time I had it. I find it is missing some of the dryness and white pepper notes I enjoy in this style, and think I used to enjoy in this brand. The finish is a little cloying, and the body is a little to full for a tripel. A Belgian brewer will say it is to filling, and I would agree. Not sure why the change, this has been a great beer, and it still is good, just not as good as before."
"Pours a beautiful clear, crisp yellow with great carbonation and a nice head that dissipates quickly. The nose is of wheat, pepper, belgian yeast and light fruit/appley. Taste follows the nose, great yeast and wheat flavor with a creamy sort of pepper taste. Apple or other light fruit hints on the finish, slight(very) sourness, possibly from cellaring. great triple, and one that deserves alot of respect. Not my favorite (love my westmalle) but close to the top."
"What can I say? Every beer produced from Unibroue is certainly world-class and some of the best... This is another definite winner... Although this might be categorized as a ""Tripel""... I would more consider this as something as a ""super witbier"" and a step-up from their Blanche de Chambly... Pours a hazy, cloudy, yellow, straw-color with a decent frothy head... aroma is all fruits, with lemon, coriander, and citrus pouring through... taste is super-rich, thick, and creamy, and strongly complements the aroma with its fruit-like characteristic dominated by light, cloudy overtones... one of the better beers out there... every beer that I've sampled from Unibroue has been above and beyond and this one fails to disappoint... a definite must-try... Certainly recommended..."
"I think its a very enjoyable beer but the sweetness takes away from its credibility a little."
"La Fin du Monde is one of the first real Canadian beers I've had (I exclude Molson's and Labatt's on general principle). The appearance is an amber-brown, with a slightly opaque quality. The smell is pretty citrusy, though it doesn't overwhelm you. The taste is where this one shines. It gives you hints of apple and other fruits, along with a yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is very lively - some might say a little bit too lively - giving off a highly carbonated texture. Overall, this is an excellent beer and highly drinkable. It's something one could easily latch onto."
"I'm not giving this a 5 and I think I should explain why. I find that this beer, as good as it is, is too sweet. A little more bitter aftertaste and a little less sweet citrus flavor would move this beer closer to perfection."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange and topped off with a magnificent white head that fades eloquently with a small thin fluff left on top. Smells robust and complex with oranges, apples, bananas and spice. Some yeast mingles and a second takes reveals some furtive butterscotch. Tastes of apricots mixed with some breadiness. There's a tinge of alcohol heat left in the throat which lets you know what you're drinking. I like this, and would not change it. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied yet quite drinkable. This is a fulfilling sipper that will keep you begging for more."
"I am amazed that a beer can be this good. I rank this with Delirium, Chimay, and Duvel. I personally like it better than Duvel; not as sweet, but this is indeed a world-class beer."
"D- This is delicious. I am excited to finish this 750ml. I will be back for more."
"Hazy pale gold, visble yeast from bottle conditioning and an initial half inch head that dissipates to a layer which it is able to maintain. No lacing. Aroma is yeasty with a lot of mixed fruit and spices; bananas, pears and cloves come to mind. The taste reminds me a lot of Duvel and a little of Chimay at first and then as it warms it reminds me more of Chimay and less of Duvel. It would be interesting to do a side by side comparison of these three. The carbonation is coarse and bubbly leaving a very clean mouthfeel. This is a very good beer. I will be drinking it again."
"This beer pours into the goblet with a brilliant deep gold color with a frothy white head. The head dissipates to a nice film with whisps but does not leave too much lace. The smell of the beer is up front with sweet maltiness mixed in with the Belgian style yeast and some unknown spices. The taste is very complex. Just like the smell, the sweetness hits you first. This is very quickly followed by the belgian yeast along with the spiciness hitting you in the mouth like a punch. As the beer finished, a strong hop flavor is quite apparent and then the sweetness of the beer along with some fruitiness (apple?) returns and lingers on your tongue. The mouthfeel is low-medium with an incredible amount of effervescence. The finish leaves that sweet, yet dry feeling in your mouth. Overall, a highly drinkable triple. This is a very nice beer, and in a style I would not usually reach for."
"Overall- Great brew. Another winner from Unibroue. These guys really have their stuff together. They are one of the most consistant breweries that I have found so far. This beer will definitely be revisited again soon."
"pours a very cloudy, hefe like color, with a big sparkly white head. has tons of carbonation, it laces quite a bit as well. smells alot like a hefe as well. but with a more predominate alcohol scent. the taste is awesome, smooth and flavorful. has a slight spicyness to it with a fruity taste too. very complex. has a good mouthfeel to it, but it is very drinkable, just fantastic beer all around, a real treat. a world class beer"
"This is a thoroughly enjoyable brew. Delicious."
"Lot's of carbonation tingles your lips with every sip, with the body being slightly malt thick. It is wonderfully and easily drinkable, with a four pack of these easily consumed with the consequences being it is so high in alcohol."
"I've had this brew a bunch over the years and am always quite suprised that it's this good.... special for sure."
"D - This is my favorite brewery for a reason. This is just one more of the awesome beers they put out that is great. This is one of the beers that got me hooked on Unibrou."
"Pours a murky golden orange color with a thick, soapy, sudsy white head that builds up to almost 3-4"" and almost spills out of the glass. Dies down mostly but still leaves a thin white layer resting on top of this one. Smell is yeasty with belgian spices, I can pick up some orange peel, coriander as well. Taste is a sweet taste of dried fruits, with a creamy mouthfeeling."
"Drinkability: a great Tripel I have imbibed in quite a few of these and enjoyed them every time"
"Drinkability: Very tasty and bold brew. Enjoyable and satisfying to drink."
"Poured from a bottle into a warm glass. Instant thick head that made pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass an exercise in patience. Thick meringue-like foam that could just about float a Buick over a translucent straw yellow that was so totally absent of red that I was looking to see if was actually little greenish. Fine aroma of pepper and clove with a little apricot. A slightly sweet-tart fruit start to the flavor that is cleansed by the spicy yeast notes and a little solventy presence that gives away the 9% ABV, though the body and the alcohol work well to offset each other. Surprisingly drinkable for a high ABV brew, like many of the Belgians that it emulates, and is indeed worthy of joining their ranks."
"One of my all time favorites from the great north...while I prefer Duvel, this is a world class beer."
"Drinkability - this is my most important score for a BSPA, as I feel a good one should be very drinkable. I don't think a good BSPA's drinkability should be less than 4.5. That's part of the fun of this style...so easy to drink, yet so intoxicating. This fills the bill. I am pairing it with Cajun-smoked salmon on peppered water crackers, and it is working swimmingly."
"Hazy golden color with nearly 2 fingers of airy white head. Big lemon, lime zest aroma with minor notes of floral to herbal hop esters, slight pine, and a flash of clove. Starts with a lemony pucker, candy sugar, and a medium yeasty sourness. Midway becomes smoothed with a little sweet malt character and notes of banana and vanilla. The finish adapts a more rounded flavor with a smoother lemon, lime flavor, grassy straw, and buttery malt. Semi-smooth mouthfeel on a thin to medium body and a very big carbonation. A bit to sweet for me is this beers only miss, a well hidden alcohol makes this considerably drinkable though."
"This beer is polished! I could get my swerve on drinking this bad boy! Clearly my favorite Unibroue product."
"The 9% can catch up with you quick if you aren't careful. The ABV hurts the drinkability a little bit but this is still a very good beer. Different than anything I've ever had, but very good."
"This was an easy brew to sit there and savor. Not one of the best, but quite acceptable."
"One of my all time favorites."
"Overall - I used to enjoy this beer, but these days I find the yeast character to be overbearing."
"Drinkability and Notes: Hides its robust alcohol deceptively; only a few of these and youll be unexpectedly lit, a pleasure Ive enjoyed many times. Very flavorful but not overpowering in any one regard. This is the beer that really opened my eyes to the world of craft brewing; one that I often return to and am never disappointed with. Ive had to reserve it for celebratory occasions to make room to try new beers, but tonight Im celebrating only La Fin du Monde. Drink less, drink better!"
"Golden liquid with moderate head when poured in wide chalice glass. Light rounded malty smell. Light maltness with subdued fruit esters of pear and apple, accompanied by a mellow phenol spiceyness. Maltyness fades to noticeable alcohol presence and subtle hop bitterness. Bubbly almost foamy carbonation with a relatively thin malty body. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Is dangerously drinkable for its ABV. Really good stuff for those needing a gateway into Belgian styles."
"D - This is a decent Belgian strong ale, but it's a bit hoppy and thinner than I expected. I really wanted to adore this beer as I've heard so much about it, but it really didn't quite live up to my expectations."
"drinkability is good. well balanced, hiding its alcohol pretty well. funny that i'm within a few hours drive of quebec, yet it's easier for someone in minnesota to get most unibroue products than it is for me..."
"D: Relatively smooth drinkability for this style & alcohol content. Definitely enjoy this intriguing beer slowly - it has so many subtle chartacteristics - lot of fun to review."
"Great BSPA - one of the best non-Belgian BSPA I have had and better than some imported from Belgium. Another winner from Unibroue."
"A top-quality effort from Unibroue and probably one of the 4 or 5 best BSPA's that don't come from Belgium. I can't wait to try all Unibroue's beers and see if they compare."
"belle bière blonde trouble, la mousse se dissipe rapidement mais elle est très belle, petit nez de levure, belle pointe épicée en bouche, belle longueur, l'alcool se fait sentir, moins épicé que la don de dieu, moins bonne aussi, je la préfère aussi."
"D - One of the better offerings I have tried from Unibroue."
"One of the best Triples out there. Excellent throughout. Highly recommended."
"EDIT: so I have tried this brew again, and I now appreciate it as a very good tripel. For this reason, I am changing the drinkability score from 3 to 4!"
"D- I know lots of other people like this beer but I just don't dig it. For me the funk and sweetness combined with the stickiness makes it less than drinkable."
"A classic Tripel, and one of my top 5."
"Pours a straw color, nothing deep or special. A nice head, but no lacing. An odd scent, a mix of bitter and sweet, not really mixed, but neither one overpowering the other. Has a bubbly feel to it, but goes down smooth enough for a high ABV beer. Not much of a taste, rather bland, but with a bitter, high alcohol aftertaste."
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered yellow/orange color, Large white head, settles fairly quickly. This has a sweet somewhat fruity aroma, very bready, almost like a witbier, but with out the orange peel. Taste has faint notes of dried fruit, maybe even some oak? It also hides the alcohol quite well. Mouthfeel seems to start off somewhat fizzy, but finishes rather smooth. Drinkability is quite high, as this is a very well balanced brew. Definitly recommended."
"Edited Dec. 2, 2008, to say that I had another bottle aged one year and pretty much scored it 4.5 across the board. Overall impresson: under-stated bold and adventurous, much like the Quebec legend that inspired it, this was a very good example of the style. Keep up the good work Unibroue."
"Bought this bottle from CrackedKettle after reading and hearing so much about it. I thought I must give this a shot, being a fan of Unibroue's brews. I served the Fin Du Monde in my Duvel tulip and it billows up with a nice thick head good retention. The beer itself is a hazy orange golden color. On the nose, I have yeast, malts, some floral aromas as well as a light dash of apricot. The taste comes in with very subtle sweetness and clear yeast with a nice bready malt backing to it. It was somewhat similar to some blonds but very well done in this one albeit the fact that I am not to comfy with too much yeast jumping at me. Slightly citrusy in the taste but not much fruits detected which was a pity (think there was also a dash of apricot here). Some clear bready earthy tones too. The taste was generally strong and fairly complex, although I am not a big fan of yeasty tastes, I have to take my hat of this one. The finish was also yeasty but it unveiled a most wonderful after taste thereafter. I had apricots and then clearly apples with some very sublte malt sweetness. After the apples came delicious grapes lasting though a bit and ""strong", ""tasty"" and ""lingering"" would be how I describe the after taste! The Fin Du Monde is between medium to full body thickness and the carbonation was good and active. Alcohol warming and strength were clear but the smoothness was not taken away; it goes down a little dry. This is a nice beer and I am glad I tried it though I am not a big fan of blonds. This one is clearly a great blond style for whoever is into the style; it tastes more like a blond than a tripel but that's one hell of a great blond we are talking about. Although I still prefer the Westmalle and Chimay tripels, it is a different gratification that I am after. Fin du Monde is a great beer and albeit not exactly my taste, I do feel that the after taste was awesome."
"D: I was not overpowered by the ABV and the beer left enough room for a second. Would enjoy again, in a heartbeat!"
"Drinkability : good beer a little too high (style triple) brewed by Unibroue in Quebec."
"Not a session beer obviously but the noticeable alcohol is handled very well. It's warming and works well with the rest of the beer's characteristics. I see what all the fuss is about, a great beer."
"The only issue I have with this beer is that the alcohol content is noticeable. If you like this beer, try the rest of the Unibroue beers, they are all delicious, some more than this one"
"I had this beer at Callahan's and it was served in a large bottle with cork, not sure this is the regular serving, but it totally rocked. I had it put on ice while at the bar. It poured very red and golden and the head was not very large. The taste was very good, but not something I could drink all the time. It was very rich and sweet and would be best with a desert. It was a very strong beer. I only rated the drinkability a 4 because it is not something I would drink everyday and with any food, only with a desert. Everything else about this beer was perfect. It was recommended by an old friend who lived near the manufacturer."
"Drinkability: Decent. I couldn't have more than 1-2 glasses of this, but its pretty good. Carbonation is a distraction, very effervescent like champage. Taste is great, alcohol is barely noticeable, despite the high ABV. Pleasant yeast flavor, and delicous overtones of oranges and lemons. Excellent beer."
"Hazy, orangey-yellowish. Full white bubbly head. Warm alcohol-fruity aroma with a yeasty touch. Warm going down. High alcohol content obviosly contributes to this. Feels similar to wine in that aspect. For that reason, the drinkability is hampered. But the taste itself is a pleasant one. Fruity warm flavor with ample carbonation. This is the perfect beer to drink two of on an empty stomach before dinner. You drink two, eat like a slob, then fall asleep on the living room floor while watching the evening news. Hopefully the kid doesn't start crying..."
"D: Very drinkable. The construction of this beer is not only doing a service to Belgian-style ales brewed in North America, but to craft beer in general. Most noticeable to me is the hop character, jumping out, yet blending so well with the overall composition."
"D - A beer that I'll be drinking again for sure. The 9%ABV is quite well hidden but would creep up on you."
"Pours a nice golden color wiht thick head. Smell has fruit and yeast in it. The taste is really nice. Good balance and a subdued flavoring of citrus, sweetness and malt. The mouthfeel is quite light especially for the strength and it makes for a drinkable beer. I do wish it had slightly more character."
"Quite drinkable and soothing considering the high alcohol content. I would keep drinking these all night if they didn't hit me so hard!"
"Drinkability: Very good beer. Wonderful taste and complexity. This is a great brew that I will definitely be picking up in the future. Very highly recommended."
"Overall an outstanding highly drinkable and very special beer."
"D. The alcohol is well hidden. Not an everyday beer, but definitely one to be drank in place of a glass of wine at a fine dinner. A classy brew."
"This beer is very well done."
"D - Decent, although it is very tasty I can't give it a 5 due to the 9%, that would be dangerous after too many. I've done it quite a few times, but I wouldn't advocate that to anyone. All in all this is one of the best brews I've had the honor of consuming and it always makes for a great session."
"I dig it. I'm noticing this is my first Canadian review. This one's gonna be in my rotation from now on."
"taste is outstanding! Full, tons of flavors! yeasty, hoppy flavor. This is one of my favorites. My stand by when I can't decide what I want. I love this beer!"
"Quite frankly,this is not my type of beer with how fruity it is. It is obviously high quality, but hardly a beer that I would regularly spend the hefty price of $8 for a 25 oz bottle."
"ovverall the best belgian pale i've had to date. excellent beer, more than lives up to the hype"
"Overall - Bravo. If you are looking for a bubbly companion for the evening, maybe something that has all the fruit of a triple and drinkability of a Duvel, this is your beer."
"D - Overall a good Belgian style ale. I enjoyed it and would probably buy more of these in the future."
"single twist-off bottle from Total Wine Brier Creek"
"After a few more sips and after my palate gets more used to what it is experiencing, I'm beginning to really enjoy what is going on here.I'm finding it to be a smooth sipper; it has a medium mouthfeel to it and the carbo is also medium and it finishes on the vinuous side. Very tasty and the 9%abv adds a nice bit of warming after the swallow. I'd buy this one again."
"Overall, an OK Belgian - a bit over-priced though."
"I've had this beer before but this was the first time I actually took the time to review and notice all its subtle properties. I could definitely see myself drinking this all day long, but with the 9%...I'll need to take my time with it."
"Comment: This is my first from this brewery and it will not be my last."
"Bubble gum comes to mind again. Malty with no real noticeable hops."
"D: This is 9% but I couldn't detect even a trace of alcohol. This is what BSPA's aspire to be like and very few reach this pinnacle. A truly wonderful beer!"
"Very light mouthfeel,champagne like,velvety and creamy textute with a touch of grainyness. Pleasing,alcohol is well hidden dangerous beer drank a 750ml with ease left me craving more."
"Oh, and hooray to me for being the 1000th reviewer of this gem!"
"drinkabiliy- fantastic at first and getting easier all the time."
"Been hooked on Unibroue and this is next in line. Poured from 750 mL bottle. Pours a light, hazy orange in color, a golden orange if you will. A thick, rocky head first appears and takes its time to settle. Aroma is of sour fruits, yeast, and some sweets. Tastes is wunderbar! A mixture of various fruits (apple, some citrus, and maybe a touch of grape) and a touch of sour. Alcohol is present as well, the first sip leaves a brilliant warm feeling in the mouth. His a slightly creamy mouthfeel to it and goes down smooth leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Like many of Unibroue's other offering only a 4 on drinkability as 2 glass of this can leave your head spinning. A terrific beer."
"This is highly recommended, and it is laudable that this Belgian-styled brew is from Canada of all places. This sample is the second 750 ml bottle I've purchased, and I know that I will reach for this again some time."
"Poured into a snifter from a bomber. The beer pours a slightly hazy straw, forming a massive 3 fingers worth of head, that faded leaving some medium spots of lace. The aroma is delicious fruit and sugar. The taste is very much the same, consisting of sharp hops, followed by a sweet candy taste, and finishing with a very smooth fruity flavor. Higher carbonation than expected, but still an easy drinker. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. Full flavor and smooth mouthfeel made for a very enjoyable Belgian. I will be getting this again!"
"this beer is excellent with spicy food, but also just by itself."
"D - This is a really world class beer even if the name implies drinking on at ""the end of the world"". It is just drinkable in almost every sense w/ sweetness, Belgian character and spice. The 9% abv makes it more of a sipper, but pure pleasure in each sip."
"Overall: A good sipper but i have to be in the mood for spice to pick this one up again."
"Drinkability - Well, this beer is quite simply delicious. If it wasnt for the 9% abv, Id have a field day. A 750ml of this golden elixir of the gods is perfect. If you havent had this yet, get it."
"Drinkability - A long slow sipper that wears a little to much on my palate a little to quick."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with about an inch white head. The aroma isn't strong at all, but what I can smell is nice. Mostly there's just an overall fruity and sweet smell, along with some cloves, honey, pear and yeast. Luckily the taste is stronger, it tastes like fruit, cloves, pepper and honey. Mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation, a little too much, but not enough that it takes away from the beer. The drinkability is still pretty good, it goes down easy and the alcohol isn't noticable at all. I think this is a pretty decent beer. The aroma wasn't strong, but the taste and overall drinkability made up for it. Recommended."
"poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet,very hazy cloudy piss yellow that never did clear up,beautiful 2+finger head that stays put well and nice lacing.Really smell the spices in this one and yeast and faint fruityness to it.You can taste pears and bananas with a sweetness with a kinda sparkling fizzle to it.Goes down quite well with a heavinesss to it and you can feel the carbonation,no doubt about it.I tell you though...the alcohol in this one hits you quite rapidly,i get a decent beer buzz rather quickly due to the high alcohol content.Not a bad beer if you like this style but for me...not really my type,and i got 2 more 750 ml bottles to polish off still....oh well,it won't go to waste,i'll find some strong cheese and Bratwurst sausages to offset the taste and polish them off,watching a good NFL game....no probs."
"The clear light golden / dark straw hued brew is topped by a creamy, impressively thick head w/ stiff peaks of foam. Signature lace is left down the glass. Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew. Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise. Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest. Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability. Finishes dry w/ honey sweetness, lightly peppery alcohol and clove abruptly ending simultaneously. Fin Du Monde epitomizes the style and is delicious... the drinkability is superlative considering its strength."
"People I shared this with enjoyed it more than I did, but I still thought it was an above average beer"
"Re-edit: My opinion of this beer just keeps improving. I disagree with a lot of what I have originally written about it."
"In sum, this is a delicious beer. In fact, I just finished refinishing a wood floor, I'm tired as hell, really I just wanted a heavy night cap to put me asleep, but this thing is so tasty, and the qualities so evident, it just makes me smile."
"Pours a hazy strawlike yellow with a pillowy head that dies to a nice lace. Smells of sweet fruit, yeast, clove, and tea. Tastes of spicy clove, malt, pear, tea. Feel full in the mouth with a lively tickle on the tongue from carbonation. Finishes a little dry with a touch of alcohol and a big warming effect. This is a sipper for sure and a delight to drink."
"I love Unibroue, period. All their offerings are unique and interesting. It opens my mind to whats possible! I do like some of the others better then this one, the spicyness kind of turns me off but otherwise its great."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth the brew is of a lighter body, with lower levels of carbonation than I would expect for the style. The beer finishes fairly spicy and a bit dry, but not too dry. This is a beer that I'd drink just about any time, not sure if I prefer it over Duvel-sure they're not the same, but they do have similarities-but in my book it is definitely the same quality. I see the two as interchangeable."
"Great beer! I tried this at a beef fest about six months ago and really liked it. I saw this on the menu last night and couldn't wait to try it in a much larger quantity. It didn't disappoint. Very nice pour with a perfect smell for a belgian pale. Tastes delicious and was smooth the whole way down..."
"Not a bad brew, just ok - and quite overrated IMO."
"Drinkability- This beer is fantastic. Just when you think Canada has nothing but hockey, Strange Brew and Rush you find this!"
"D: Could drink this one all night if I didn't have pure abbey style ales around me. But great and tasty reproduction of the Beglain style. Yum."
"I'm giving an average drinkability because while the alcohol doesn't affect the taste at all, the beer is too tangy to give it a high drinkability rating, though it is still a great beer."
" ~ This is a very good beer. There is really something to be said for the 'head' offered by different brewing styles. This is a light almost out of body feel that makes me very pleased that I have another full pint glass of frothy goodness waiting for me in the oversized bottle. Don't pass this one by because before you know it, it's La Fin Du Monde (The End Of The World.)"
"D: Very drinkable, goes down too easy. It is not heavy or filling at all, this could be a session beer if you had nowhere to go :) Highly recommended"
"Every country has their brewers who try to recreate Belgium's best and Unibroue does it consistently brew after brew....Canada should be proud. Along with Maudite these two beers are perfect examples, yet different than the best that Belgium has to offer. I have had several dozen bottles of this beer and every time it leaves me all warm and fuzzy, especially those 750 ml. It is relatively cheap, and ohh soo good... eh? God love Canada for this one."
"For 9.99 a 4-pack, it's a bargain and I'm in love with it so my score is biased. Sorry, you may want to read the next one for objectivity."
"Tastes wet sweet with strong fruity. Some dried hay and quite a bit of phenol. I have a hard time with phenol and this beer is difficult for me to handle. Yeasty serves to temper the sweet and a strong sting from carbonation lifts the thickness from the tongue. ABV must be about 10%, but is quite well integrated with the other flavors. Clean, without fusels. Aftertaste is increasingly drying with an unpleasant phenol and aromatic oil that contributes a numbing or dulling effect. Md body and heavily carbonated. Very well balanced with an interesting story of flavors rising and falling. Judged to style, not to my particular preferences."
"Drinkability of this beer is good, I'll probably finish this 750ml without to much trouble."
"Has a hoppy bite on the tongue, along with the warming alcohol and some spice that lingers. A truly remarkable beer and this one should make any Canadian proud."
"D: For a beer of this complexity, drinkability is high. I split a 750 mL bottle with another person, and I can still feel the alcohol. I could surely have more of this beer for the taste, but it is potent stuff. Im sure one whole bottle is enough."
"Very drinkable, but the alcohol comes out much more than in the Maudite, its darker sister, and is less complex than Maudite, also. Still, preferable over a delirium Tremens and is quite delicious during hot summer days. A very good brew."
"Poured into a glass and the drink had a faint gold color with a nice head that dissapated slowly. Smell is reminiscent of the other Unibroue lines I have tried not that I am complaining(fruity). The taste was excellent no aftertaste very smooth. I could definetly drink this again and recommend this to anyone who can find it"
"I could do some serious damage ... to myself, probably ... if I ever saw this on tap."
"Surprisingly light bodied and despite the alcohol in the finish it really does not give away it's 9% ABV. An eminently drinkable Belgian style beer!"
"12oz brown bottle with silver foil at the neck and a label of Quebec surrounded with glowing light. Hazy gold color. Sudsy head with a clovey, spicey nose. Winey alcohol smell also present. Lemony taste upfront with Belgian yeast funk trailing it up. Dryish sweet finish with a rounded tang. At 9%abv this beer at first seems a Duvel clone, but a closer taste reveals far more Belgian yeast character that includes a sourness and a wet blanket funk. This complexity makes this beer a ""must try"". Try it with seafood dishes, herbed vegetables, cheese courses, or as a night-cap sipper."
"Pours with a furious white head of tight, dense bubbles which stick to the glass while the carbonation remains active for quit some time. color is a luminescent, soft, yellow. Nose is a true bouquet with natural suggestions of lime, banana, herbs and more. Taste is quite sweet and very fruity/cider-like, with a full mouthfeel and spicy finish which hides the high alcohol content very well. Alcohol burn is noticeably absent for a 9% beer. Certainly give this a try, easy to drink and a nice bellywarmer."
"A winner of a belgian from Unibroue!!!"
"Pours a pale straw hue, with the clarity greatly disturbed by the expressive carbonation(another gusher!). The fizzy snow-white head eventually drops to a sturdy cap leaving weak lacing. Pils malt, hay, earthy yeast tones and clean alcohol are the most apparent aromas, with belgian phenols and candy-ish esters become more pronounced as the bouquet opens up. Big Two-Row sweetness and sharp Pils malt upfront, followed by sugary esters and typical Unibroue phenolics. There is some lemongrass, and peach fruitiness in the back, coupled with a strong earthy yeast character that segues into a mellow but full noble hop flavor/bitterness. The hop presence is probably not needed to balance the taste given the drying alcohol and spiciness in the aftertaste, but is a nice accent to an already complex melange of flavors. The body is very thinned-down from presumably viscous and highly carbonated. The crisp mouthfeel is lively and works well with the Unibroue house yeast, but it also helps off-set the considerable residual sweethess left over, as well as lift some of the phenols before they become obtrusive. This ale posesses all the delicate flavors I have found in other Unibroue beers, but is less abbrasive in its alcohol perception with a less aggressive yeast pattern. The finish is surprisingly managable given the strength, probably one of the most drinkable BSPA I've tried. Easy to see why this is the most popular Unibroue ale."
"Pale golden color with a white head which sticks around for a while and sticks to the glass. Some apple in the aroma mixed in with hops and alcohol. The first taste is amazing, as good as anything I've had in ages. Apple, spice, a little bit of hop bitterness, some yeast. Very refreshing and thirst quenching for such a strong beer. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with some nice carbonation on the tongue. I haven't had this beer in a long time, but it was worth the wait. I would add some more to this review, but the more I drink the harder it is to write coherently. So I'll just leave it at this. This is one of the world's really great beers."
"This beer pours a beautiful pale gold color. Strong alcohol aroma with hints of spice and apple along with yeast, malt and some hops. Taste is well balanced with hints of apple, banana, clove, malt and yeast with that alcohol finish. At 9%, very drinkable but not for the faint of heart either. Complex and absolutely delicious. An outstanding Belgian ale!"
"D: Fair, due to the high alcohol and the complexity, but still a very good brew from Unibroue."
"Final Statement: A very well put together Belgian styled pale. A good drink, pretty high drinkability for the style. My favourite from this brewer, which means a lot because they're a very respectable company. Top Notch!"
"This brew pours a light gold, with a perfect 10 head into my Unibroue tulip glass. Aromas are light citric fruits, figs, honey, malted grains and a dash of brown sugar in there. The taste is also light, the alcohol is hiding well out of sight, with citrus fruits dominating the palate. The finish is pretty smooth with a slight bite as it goes down. Yes, definitely a top-notch brew from those crazy Canadians."
"An altogether excellent beer from Unibroue."
"Good drinker. Recommended. I can see this as a ""gateway beer"" into the more sour beverages i see more experienced tasters seem to have a thing for."
"Bottle smell is very earthy hopped with slight molasses and spices. Into my chalice it pours to a very cloudy pale yellow. The head is plentiful but dissappears quickly.. Mouthfeel is tremendous. The high AC is very evident. The carbonation is high but is a good compliment to the heartiness of this brew. The intial tartness and spicy taste is followed by a neutral bitterness. This is the closest thing to a good homebrew that i've ever had. A good starter beer but the drinkability will be low due the extremely high AC. Con cuidado, this brew will knock your socks off."
"This is a great beer that always finds it's way into my refridgerator. Pairs well with pesto and salmon."
"D - Exceptional taste but a bit flavorful and strong to be drunk in quantity."
"Quite a complex and enjoyable ale."
"Bought a four pack of bottles for 9.99 at a local liquor store-wanted a beer with a kick. This beer has a great appearance with a dishwater/cloudy gold appearance and thick head after intial pour that dissipates slowly with medium bubbles. Strong citrus malt smell. Taste is not bad for alcohol content and flavors mimic the scents but a background bitterness that leaves a slight aftertaste (usually killed after having the second one. The mouth feel is near perfect and it is easily drinkable but be wary if all you wanted was a two beer buzz b/c it goes down easy and it's kick is hard. Will buy again."
"Delightful. Unibroue is one of, if not the premium brewery in North America, IMHO, and La Fin is their premiere brew. Pours a cloudy golden, good lasting foam. Aroma contains tinges of apple, citrus, some lemon. Taste is crisp, clean, excellent fruitiness without cloying sweetness, light. Tasty and drinkable. Excellent paired with a meal of fish or chicken. The best feature of this ale is the way it covers a complete taste spectrum without heaviness or leaden weightiness. Unibroue's Maudite and Trois Pistoles are both close seconds."
"This is certainly an interesting beer. Right off the bat, it pours out of the bottle like champagne in a movie-scene. Once poured, it's a gorgeous golden color, with a fluffy white head. Smell is sweet, hints of caramel, a bit of floral hops, and a rather strong scent of spice. Taste is very much the same, with the caramel coming out a bit more, the spice holding it's own, and the hops taking a definite backseat to the sweet fruity flavor (apple/banana? this one's hard to pin down). Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and it goes down smooth. Drinkability is a bit TOO good for such a high ABV, this one is very easy to overdrink with. Despite that, it's still a great beer, and I look forward to having it quite a bit more in the future."
"""The end of the World"".. Nice. This is a beer I could drink all night. The 9% hides from you until the end. Crisp bite at the end is wonderful. It literary bellowed out of the bottle. Nice, thick head that left soap like stains on the glass. Smells of yeast and fruit. I had this beer about 5 years ago and forgot how good it really is. My favorite so far from Unibroue. More to come!! 750ml"
"D - Not bad but the overpowering rose flavor may tire."
"They've done this style well. It reminds me of Chimay and Duvel. Enjoy."
"Beer poured from the bottle a rich, hazy golden color. Gave off a very thick nice head, with great retention and lacing. Smell was very lively, some great fruit smells, citrus and something heavier, fig or raisins, and a nice spicy scent as well. Taste is pretty much as good as it gets, same type of stuff as the scent, only more pronounced on the palate than in the nose. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy, goes down smooth, excellent beer."
"D- Quite good, especially because of the light body and thoroughly refreshing nature."
"Eric"
"First off, the cork blows out of these babes like they were champagne. The pour is exceptional, beautiful foggy gold with a serious, off-white, cratered head (from those big, healthy bubbles) that hangs around quite a while. Thick lacing. As I have noted, childhood allergies completely screwed my sense of smell, but the fruitiness couldn't be missed. Maybe raspberries. I can't really say, but if I can smell it, it's there. The mouth feel is full, plenty of carbonation, though it sure doesn't get in the way. It seems like every taste bud is located and activated, lingering and lingering, kicking up the initial rush. Yeasty, but not in your face; some sweetness, but not at all cloying. It's a little peppery on the tongue, and closes with a nice warmth; pleasant, rather calm for a 9% ABV. Everything fits so nicely in this beer. If it were female, it would be powerful, sultry, and smooth. At the top of the pale ale pile. I'll be drinking this a bunch ..."
"Until recently I had been a bit reluctant to try Unibroue's beers due to the majority of their labels looking like art from a cheesy death metal album, however the adage of not judging a book by it's cover has never been more true. There is no doubt I will be trying this beer again."
"Very drinkable despite the high abv. One of the world's great beers, IMO."
"D- a fine brew but dare i say i prefer delirium tremens. This is just a touch too tart for my tongue compared to others. The beer looks great and i wouldnt knock it back, but i would take a tremens before it."
"La Fin Du Monde screams Belgium, straight from the heart of... Canada? Well, with a name like La Fin Du Monde, made it screams ""French-Canadian done in a Belgian style"". But that doesn't sound quite as sexy. I don't care. It's excellent under any name."
"I would highly recommend this beer and most other beers from Unibroue."
"D: This is a rather drinkable brew but the alcohol gets you in the end. A very potent beer and a very good example of the Belgian strong pale ale."
"Overall, I like it very much. However, due to it's high ABV (9%) I would not suggest to drink too many of these in one sitting if you would like to keep your composure."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and perfect for a hot day. Pretty drinkable considering it's 9%. Certainly too strong to session, but I could drink two or three. Overall, very good beer. Recommended."
"Overall im still in complete and utter amazement with Unibroue and their superior lineup of immaculate brews. A round of applause for the fine folks in Chambly Quebec."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer. Its 9.0% alcohol content by volume makes it one that you wouldn't want to drink all day, but this is a damn solid beer. Highly recommended."
"See you again in about a year for bottle #4."
"The end of the world eh? This baby pours a cloudy straw yellow with a huge snow-white head. Takes a good while before it dies down to a good lacing with quite a bit of stickiness. Smell is definitely a fluffy yeast with bananas and a smokey scent as well. A tiny hint of alcohol seems to tingle the nose as well. Taste has nice balance between the clovey yeast and the mandarine hop flavoring. A bit of metallic tingles in the mouth as well. Alcohol flavor is present but not overpowering at all, finishes somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is creamy with high carbonation. They make this beer very drinkable for this style at 9%. This is my first beer from this brewery and I know it won't be my last."
"This beer pours a mild pale-ish color. I never realized it was a pale ale, let alone a strong pale ale and I have had it in the past. Strong aroma with hints of spice and apple along with malt and some hops. Taste is somewhat mild with a very raisin like consistency mixed in with alcohol. Again, very strong and interesting for a Belgian-style Pale Ale. At 9%, very drinkable and not quite for the faint of heart either. Complex, yet delicious. Definitely something different for a pale ale, let alone a strong pale ale."
"D: Due to a high ABV of 9% and the rich and brilliant flavors, this is a beer to enjoy while smoking a pipe, but not one to take to a college party."
"This was tonight's great find at Whole Foods in Jericho, NY as I was thinking about a tripel. It poured with an extra foam that took a while to settle, so I just inhaled it in deep appreciation. The first taste was like the last, until I got to the extra yeast section. A plentiful array of sweet malts, the tangs of hops, and the slightly sour elements came together in a great tasting ale. It must be stellar on tap."
"This is a very special beer. I opened the bottle to the smell of New Belgium's Abbey (Double). The smell was clean and balanced. Nothing stuck out. The taste is very light on the tongue with a hint of ginger and sweet alcohol as pointed out before. What impressed me the most about this brew was its drinkability and mouthfeel. This feels like a slightly flat champagne and ends very crisp. This drinks like a normal beer but has twice the alcohol. Very nice. Will try to brew some of my own."
"At 9% this beer dont seem that high.Good stuff but I tend to like the darker belgians more.I would reccomend to any belgian lover.But its nothing to go out and hunt down."
"This was a rather complex and excellent offering. A variety of tastes experiences, sensations, ebbs & flows, etc. made for a great beer experience. Be warned that it does drink much easier than the high ABV it is. I would definitely drink this again, and would recommend it to anyone."
"D- I can't tell this is 9% ABV and it is very delicious. I will try this one again. Another great offering from Unibroue"
"Hazy straw yellow out of the bottle. Not much head. Lots of bubbles continuously rise. Aroma is bready and strongly sweetly alcoholic. Flavor is tart and sweet and bready in the finish. In looks and taste this beer is very reminiscent of a Hefeweizen. After warming there is a slight buttery wine-like flavor up front. Some citrus notes also start to come out as it warms."
"Drinkability: Tasty Belgian ale, very drinkable, a lot of fruity flavor packed into this one."
"La Fin Du Monde really holds its own in the Belgian Strong Pale category despite the serious competition at the top. I will absolutely revisit this beer again and again."
"Fantastic beer. With my admittedly brief experience with Belgian-style ales, I have to say that I've come to the conclusion that not much beats a great BSPA. This one is fantastic. Highly, highly recommended."
"D: Put this on my Wants list..."
"This beer pours a very nice pale straw gold color with a thick 2 finger pure white head. The head falls a bit but can be quickly called back by swirling the glass leaving tons of lace. The smell is dominated by the Unibroue yeast with a bit of summer fruit underneath. There seems to be three separate taste ""phases"" with this beer. First there is a lot of sweetness with orange and tangerine flavors. Second, a good deal of bitterness from the hops and a touch of warmth from the alcohol is noticed, both of these flavors are subtle but they do enough to balance the sweetness. Lastly, I get nice tart lemon along with a bit of grain and peppery spice. A bit of clove and banana are present throughout. The mouthfeel is good medium body with lively carbonation, a powdery dry finish and a pleasant aftertaste. Drinkability ranks very high interesting complexity with hidden alcohol makes this highly quaffable. If the end of the world were imminent I would be drinking a few of these."
"This is a pretty nice beer, don't get me wrong, but I've tried it numerous times and still don't think it lives up to the hype. It's pretty with a tall white head and hazy straw yellow body.It smelled sweet and spicy (corriander) with a similar flavor. I just find the flavor to fall flat, I get some, but not a great complexity out of it. Still, it's very easy to drink and with little hint of the alcohol. I'd probably go for Duvel instead of this though."
"D - Excellent. If it weren't for the high price tag, I would drink this all the time. 9% be damned...this thing did kick my ass at the end of the night however, so watch out."
"Poured a delicious looking golden yellow, with 2 finger of head, which dissolved quickly, leaving no lace on top. A great smell, floral and fruity, but not quite as fruity as an average weiss. Tasted as good as it smelled: delicious, fruity, with banana taste and orange hint, sugary/yeasty. At first taste, I thought it was slightly too carbonated. But as I drank it, the bubbly texture really started to compliment the tangy taste, leaving a sharp impression on my tongue. No taste of alcohol anywhere. A well crafted beer, leaving me a very happy drinker."
"D: Solid beer, easy to drink, easy to put back a 750mL bottle at 9%ABV and not notice!"
"D- This one is dangerously good. This might just be my desert island beer. I was wowed by this back in 1996 and I am wowed by it now. A masterpiece."
"Despite it's alchohol content, I'd actually consider it a session beer as it's very easy to drink. I'm not sure how long you would be coherent for at 9%, but up until that moment of black-out, you'd be enjoying every sip."
"d: i've enjoyed this one on many occasions, and will continue to do so as it's a solid beer that always satisfies"
"This beer is very drinkable and enjoyable, especially given the alcohol level. A great and well-crafted example of the style."
"I'd have a hard time finding something of this style/strength combination that is also this drinkable. In a word: 5"
"This was fantastic. Poured a deep hazy and very light amber with a big white frothy head. Quick fade left behind a nice quarter inch layer of head on top and nice lace down the glass. Smell was very alive, lots of figs and pears with hints of raisin and plum. Lots of carbonation gave this a great feel and only served to punctuate the great flacors. Lots of light fruitness here, again peachs, pears, figs, hints at nutmeg and some grape. Extrodinarily drinkable, with no hint whatsoever of the big alchol in this. Quite possibly one of my all time favorite belgian style ales. This was fantastic. Nothing over the top, just crafter perfectly. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
"M/D- Very light on the pallet, lots of bubbles, and smooth....Easy to drink, with the alcohol hidden well....A great beer to turn people on to Belgians with...easy to see why it is rated in the top of its style....again I really should have started drinking Unibroue a long time ago...great beer at great prices."
"drinkability - ill find out in a few hours"
"Has a good mouthfeel and drinking it was a nice experience. Couldn't drink too many, though."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Its a bright yet cloudy orange color. Had a nice foamy white head. Not as big as other Belgians and didn't take as long to dissipate. Not much in the way of the lacing department. The smell is of all things that make up a Belgian Ale, spicy and sweet, a nice powerful aroma. The taste is of orange peel, tartness of granny smith apples, cloves, Belgian yeast. The feel is moderate and well carbonated, champagne like. A very flavorful ale and worthy of another purchase. However it doesn't rank up there with my favorites due to the strong orange peel flavor and champagne like carbonation."
"The flavor is an apple tartness and lingering hop spiciness. I detect some other fruits in there too, maybe raisins. The mouthfeel is bold, with a full body accompanied by very nice tartness and tanginess. There is some warming alcohol flavor toward the bottom of the glass and this one finishes strong."
"Thanks for making me try this one again beer buddies!"
"Poured into tuliip glass. Enormous head took several minutes to die down. Aroma is sweet fruit and huge musty yeast. Taste is banana, cloves, pineapple, white pepper and alcohol. Very sweet. The comparison to cake batter is not unwarranted. Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is just right. Very drinkable, although I think two would do it for me in a session due to the ABV. Very interesting, very pleasant beer."
"But I like it."
"This beer does not allow itself to be guzzled. It forces you to take it in small sips, allowing for nice waves of flavor. Exceptional."
"No wonder the German's lost the war..sitting on their arses drinking beer like this in Belgium, would take the fighting edge off of any soldier...a great Canadian brew..OK Quebec..we'll let you stay so long as we can get this brew 'out west'."
"Drinkability: This is almost session-able. The only deterrent is the ABV."
"At first glance, this could pass for a run of the mill hefe given the cloudy, yellowish color and one inch foamy head. The taste at first could also be a bit deceiving in that it has a natural carbonation that is refreshing and clean. This beer is not your typical hefe in that it is quite a bit stronger, has much more of a bite, a stronger mouth feel, may be a little sweeter, and retains its natural carbonation a little longer than a typical hefe would. This is a very good beer, very enjoyable, and one that I would go back to again. You can't go wrong with this one. The brewery makes quality beers, and Fin Du Monde is one of their better products. L'Chaim."
"Drinks a bit slow, I'm sure this is better more matured. I fear this bottle has been opened at least a year too early."
"Truly a classic in nearly all aspects. One of the best strong, Belgian Pales west of the Atlantic."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of 7/6/09. Pours a hazy medium yellow with a two finger head, OK longevity and good lace. Aromas of citrus and bready malts. Smells ""refreshing"". Upon tasting its almost saison like. Some yeastiness mixed with citrus, bready malts with a definate alcohol presence. Fairly easy drinking considering its ABV. A well made and tasty beer."
"Taste is masked by the carbonation at first, but gets better as it sits. Wheat, citrus, and tart alcohol notes pull through. Mouthfeel is juicy and smooth, very carbonated throughout, with a nice strong bite on the end. Despite the complexity and decent taste of this Belgian Strong, it's a bit much to imagine having more than one of these in a single setting."
"So many things going on in delicate ways. Soft silky mouthfeel, spices like vanilla and clove, perhaps leather and fruity bubblegum as well. And then there is the lurking alcohol. What alcohol? Try standing up."
"Drinkability: Drinkable and enjoyable in moderation. I can't imagine having more than, oh, 2 of these in a night. It's no problem putting down one, I could do another, but beyond that it gets a little dangerous due to the high ABV. Will I seek this one out again? Perhaps, but not in the immediate future."
"A light gold in color with a nice foamy head that disapates quickly. Aroma scense of honey, fruit, a difinate belgian style. A spike of carbonation releasing fruity flavors and a note of cloves, having a light - med mouthfeel. A very good beer for the style it portrays."
"But I loved every one I tried so far. At 7.99 a 4 pack, I think it's a steal."
"D: Flavorful without being overpowering, easy to drink, despite the high alcohol content."
"La Fin Du Monde goes well with fish and chips, although, I think it would go well with anything. This brew sure lives up to its reputation  Canadians have a winner here."
"Slàinte!"
"Overall this is an OK beer. The first time I had this was as a 750 ml bottle. That was way too much. A 12 oz is about all you would want."
"The flavor is complex, laced with sugars and a bit of cooked corn, which is definitely a negative. I suppose I should have had this before have a Westmalle Tripel...not a fair fight, eh? Rather sweet and almost cloying. The alcohol is fairly well hidden for this strength of beer, which adds to drinkability, but I'm still left with that cooked corn character haunting my palate that almost has me wanting me to pour this out. The Westmalle may have ruined my palate for this beer, but I'm shocked at how poorly it measures up."
"Luckily Unibroue makes a great beer that is accessible so La Fin Du Monde is a great choice for any night. The color is exceptional: bubbly straw-colored. The smell is great with ripe fruit. The taste is crisp with a strong initial flavor. Carbonation is strong at first but it settles quickly. Drinkability... it's a beer that you can always drink even if it was the end of the world."
"Overall: In my opinion, this is one of the best Belgian-style ales brewed in all of North America."
"D - Really great beer - after smelling it I just hoped the taste would live up to it, and amazingly it was; possibly the best beer I've ever tasted, no matter the high alcohol content"
"The cellar comment is compliments of feedback enthusiastically endorsed in the cellaring forum. People speak of this aging well over up to 10 years. I'm setting down my stock to see how it goes over time as well. Looking forward to tasting this for years to come!"
"with flavors that saturate."
"A massive three finger off-white head erupts on top of a straw colored hazzy orange body. Bubbles do disipate rather quickly though. Nose is a very invigorating spicey wheat mix, very floral with hints of vanilla. Smooth and zesty with amazing balance as it enters the mouth. Raw wheat with nice compliment of spice and mellow honey notes. Warms the belly well, but the alchol is very well disguised. Amazingly drinkable with a charmingly clean mouthfeel. A truely delecious brew."
"Overall an exceptional example of the style. Very tasty, very agreeable. One of my favorites."
"A good beer, but I am not sure i would try it again. Fruity beers just dont do it for me, but its the best one i have had so far."
"Dangerously easy to drink, another great Unibroue offering, but Don de Dieu is a little better, on my opinion."
"D- Very drinkable with a great complexion to it. The combination of the carbonation and the flavors just make this beer pop."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is also of yeastiness, although the flavor is not tremendously complicated like other tripels I've had. There is not a lot of spiciness. However, the taste is simple, pleasant, and the mouthfeel is very evervescent and refreshing. I really like this beer!"
"Light to medium bodied, and very refreshing and drinkable, but also warming. Works on s cold winter night or a hot summer morning. In a word, awesome."
"Drinkability: Probably among the top five BSPAs made and so cheap it's just silly. Just an all-around treat, nothing to complain about and much to love. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"Not my favorite from Unibroue, but not a bad beer by any means!"
"For me, La Fin Du Monde is a treat to have. It gives off aromas consisting of orange rinds and freshly baked doughy breads. The brew produces a pure white frothy head that lasts quite a while. The body is quite cloudy due to the yeasts left behind. Every time I take a sip, it feels like Im biting into candied orange slices, with a moderate ginger spice. This feels a bit chewy at first, but seems to melt in my mouth. This is a greatly refreshing brew. Even with the moderate alcohol content, this could easily be enjoyable on a warm summer evening."
"This offering is sent directly to us from the great country of Quebec. One has to wonder, will its pale orange appearance and citrusy aroma leave me disappointed or will it deliver on all that has been promised? Oh oui! Kudos on a beer well built. I do enjoy Maudite more but whos to complain?"
"App. 4, Smell - 4.5, Mouthfeel - 4, Taste - 3.5 - Drinkability - 4"
"Ah, what a beer. Lovely white foam slowly makes it way down the glass, inviting you to drink the brew. At first it smelled and tasted more like a triple, the flowery aromas almost startling. But as this beer settlled in the glass, I could smell more the of malt, kind of a crystalized sweetness. I just loved this beer. It was complex and simple- it found the right balance. As it warmed slightly it became even richer, as most beers of this quality will do. An incredibly smooth beer for such high alcohol content. The heavy yeast the intially hit me also subsided, leaving this a wonderfully inviting ale."
"D - A very tasty beer. I will have this one again."
"Pours a very hazy golden with a beautiful creamy pure white head. The head retains well and the lacing is decent, but a little spotty. Smell isn't bad, there just isn't much of one. Faint hints of clove and other yeasty esters,and not too much more. The taste is better, and rather subtle. The alcohol is well camoflauged and there are nice yeast notes of clove, bubblegum, and spice. The finish is long and creamy. Nice mouthfeel, but perhaps could use a little more bite. Quite drinkable- maybe too much so."
"Poured cloudy yellow-orange with a huge off-white head that stuck around. Yeasty, estery Belgian aroma, subtle with a multitude of notes, banana and honey among them. Taste was a little sweet for my own liking, but probably not a flaw, and it was nicely balanced with a sour middle bite, and a dry finish. Another complex, challenging brew from the folks at Unibroue."
"pours out of the 750 ml bottle a hazy lemon yellow sun colour. a thin carbonation induced head appears and dies down to a thin lace. fruity esters in the nose....banana, clove, etc. dominate the aroma. oh so nice peppery and malt notes dominate the flavour profile. i love the fruity, spicy and yeasty nuances, just a damn tasty belgian strong pale ale. lemon pepper seems to dominate and i love it. i like the fact that the carbonation doesn't overpower the senses in a champagne sort of way, while the actual beer can speak for itself. that might be the difference between the belgian (duvel) and the north american (la fin du monde) interpretations of the style. regardless...i love the body of this beer and think the mouthfeel might be perfect for this style, even though i haven't much experience in said style. drinkability is great...i'd love an endless supply no matter what the season. especially in summer."
"Smell was fruity with a hint of alcohol. Taste was fresh and clear with alcohol finish. A great example of the Belgian style. The alcohol keeps it from being a real session beer for me, but for a great taste it is a good one."
"A must try, if there is anyone out there left who hasn't already had one or twelve."
"This is an outstanding example of the style, and a very tasty brew. The ABV is probably a little high to be sessionable, but having a couple of these is very enjoyable."
"A really good Belgian style pale ale and another winner from a great brewery."
"D: You have to be careful with this one, because even though it has a high alcohol percentage, it is very easy to drink."
"""The end of the world"" pours a hazy pale straw/golden color with a huge off-white head that recedes to about 1/4"" and doesn't disappear. The aroma seems to be that of apricot, cider, pepper/spice and yeast funk among other things. The flavor comes on with an estery, fruity malt presence. Pepper and clove follow along with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Very complex. Mouthfeel is smooth with lots of carbonation. Despite the alcohol content, this beer is very drinkable."
"i tried this beer not knowing what to expect as i was not familiar with this company. the 1st bottle was opened and the smell was enticing my 1st thought was this is going to be good. and i was right. tasted good in my mouth and went down nice and smooth . i am looking forward to sampling more from this brewer"
"I tried this from the bottle at our company Christmas party (I was in charge of the beer so it worked out nicely). I loved popping the cork and bumping a ceiling tile out of place when it jetted up from the bottle! Poured into the glass and got about 3/4 of an inch head. It looked like a nice wheat beer with bright straw yellow color. I got a hint of verbena in the nose. The flavor seemed to be a cross between a light sour belgian and a hefeweizen with lemon. Pretty darn refreshing for a relatively serious beer. Definitely would have it again and again."
"Overall, better than I expected, and if I had something to celebrate, like a visit to Quebec, I'd drink this all night, finances permitting. It's rare enough to even find it in Australia - if any distributors are reading this, please send more to Canberra - last time I've seen it was around 2000. Great beer."
"NOTE: The bottle was highly carbonated and the beer foamed up and out. This happened with all 4 beers in the pack and I did not shake it at all. This could have been an error from the store, or a defective bunch, but it was not a great way to begin this beer."
"What a great beer: like a Hefeweizen on steroids. I will have more of this! Thanks to my son for a nice early Christmas gift."
"This is only my second pale belgian strong (the other being Duvel, which I enjoyed), but this is first rate."
"La Fin Du Monde is really quite drinkable, and considering the advertised 9% abv, potentially dangerous. There are few 9% beers that I could immediately stomach another of, but La Fin Du Monde is one of them. (Dogfish 90 minute is another) Drink this Canadian nectar at your own peril!"
"A damn good beer, but more along the style of a Saison or Belgian golden ale than a Triple. Poured to a hazy golden orange, with good carbonation and a thick white head that lingered , then dissipated to little lacing. Aroma was very pleasant spices (clove and coriander) with a hint of apples. Taste was more of the spices, and a hint of cookie dough. Mouthfeel was tingly, as a result of the spices, and the finish was smooth and a little warming, due to the 9% abv. Left a lingering spicy aftertaste."
"This is a good triple fermented, bottle conditioned Belgian blonde. In a tulip glass, this beer is a cloudy pale yellow color with a large rocky white head that quickly disintegrates into almost nothing at all. The smell is both spicy and floral, with hints of hops and orange peel. The carbonation is initially very aggressive and reminiscent of champagne. As this beer warms, and the initial high carbonation subsides, the mouthfeel moves from light bodied to medium. The taste is mostly bittersweet and touch metallic. The finish is dry, but mildly bitter and alcoholic. Overall, a good beer if you like the BSPA style. Otherwise, it may be a bit much for the uninitiated."
"Not my favorite of the Unibroue crew, but still a tasty Belgian style ale from N. America. There is a nice complexity of flavor despite the light character of the ale, but if you dont like coriander this probably isnt for you. Nicely done Quebec."
"Drinks all too well, thanks to each sip being charmed along by that wonderful smell and finish. The actual body of this beer could be better, but the aroma could not."
"Nice looking bottle. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy golden-orange color with a white sparkling head. The smell is almost like a hefe, sweet with banana and clove, Belgian sugar. Taste is also strong on the clove/spice with no real hop taste and only a slight alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that burns the tongue. The overall drinkability is reduced by the very strong clove/spice taste. Overall, I think you're better off with Maudite."
"Pours a nice orange gold color with a 2 finger thick, foamy head and a bit of lacing. Smells very floral with fruits. Apricots, some floral hops, some banana, and yeast. Taste starts with some subdued floral hops, then moves back to the fruits I noticed in the smell, some apricots, some banana, some green apple, a bit of grain and some yeast. Good mouthfeel, good amount of carbonation, light, crisp, very refreshing. Great drinkability, surprsingly easy to drink. The 9% ABV could easily sneak up on you. Overall this is an excellent beer."
" This beer is every bit as good as I remember. This beer is malty sweet, with a medium dryness. The flavor is a thorough blending of banana and clove, a bright fruit flavor(strawberry?cherry?), a sharp yeast note, and dry, grainy malt. The flavors don't really stand out individually, but that was my crapshoot guess as to what might make this flavor. Mouthfeel is average I think for the style, but the drinkability is great. The 9%ABV is nowhere to be found."
"Overall, it is unfathomable that this beer is 9% alcohol. The balance is exquisite. Only wish there was more complexity."
"This beer is exemplary of the style and remarkably drinkable considering its high ABV. In my opinion, there is no finer Belgian strong golden ale available."
"Tried this at a restaurant. Served in the 12 oz bottle. No date on the bottle. 9% ABV. Poured into an over-sized wine glass. Appearance is a cloudy orange color, with tall head consisting of tiny bubbles. Great retention. Smells crisp and clean - citrus, pine, yeasty. Tastes of orange, yeasty, a bit bready, grapefruit, lemon, slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is fizzy all the way. Excellent sippable beer with dinner. Wonderfully fresh and sweet character."
"12 ounce bottle served in a Duvel glass. Gusher. Pretty clear golden color with a fizzy white head. Aroma of alcohol, herbs and spice, sugar. The flavor is pretty alcoholic with a long burn. Sweet lemony flavor. Maybe too sweet. High carbonation. Not something I will seek out again."
"Heard alot about this beer. Poured from a bottle into a snifter at Pazzo's in Lexington, KY. Has a nice yellowish color with a wonderfully full whitish head. Smells of citrus and spice. Nice fruit. Taste definetly citrusy, not what I expected. Alcohol is hidden very nicely for 9 percent. Fills the mouth just right. Had two of these and was certainly impressed ( and buzzed). Very well crafted beer."
"A delicate hand is required to pour this one. The billowy white head rests on the cloudy orange beer. The head leaves a nice lacing along the glass. It has a very floral and spicy smell. Some hints of alcohol and yeast are also noticeable in the aroma. The taste is complex, yet well balanced, consisting mostly of a spicy and sweet tones. The carbonation first tingles in the mouth then finishes off spicy. This is an interesting style that I always enjoy and always wish I had more."
"A brew that's both engrossingly complex and light on its feet, with very little of the rotten/oxidative notes that ruined the Trois Pistoles for me."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and one that I've enjoyed many bottles of, many times. It doesn't blow me away, but I do like it a whole, whole lot. (Note: all 4s are a conscious decision for each category, and not just me going down the list.)"
"Let this sit in your mouth for awhile. Swallow, then take a deep breath through your mouth and you will know perfection. Drink slowly and with great respect, as there is not a better tasting beer on the planet."
"Poured into a snifter style glass. Very cloudy, completely opaque and golden in color: there is indeed quite a bit of yeast in this brew. Initially the beer was chilled (don't know approx. temperature) and gradually warmed during the drinking session. It barely had a head (which soon disappeared...a bit unfortunate [though I quite enjoyed the opaque cloudiness!]), and it did have a quite pleasant smell. The taste was very well balanced between the hops and the malt, not too sweet and not too bitter. When it was chilled the flavor was more restrained yet reminiscent of apples. As it warmed up, it had more of a heavier banana flavor. Both the flavor and the feel of it (carbonation) immediately reminded me of champagne (though the comparison follows only to a point). This has definite cross-over appeal (considering the flavor, mouthfeel, as well as the presentation [both the caged and corked bottle as well as the appropriate glasswear]). Along with Stone's Double Bastard and Russian Imperial Stout, Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown Ale and Orval's Trappist Ale, this is truly my favorite beer so far."
"Pours a hazy gold with a substantial frothy white head that lingers nicely. Nose is of apples with some citrus notes and displays the complexity of a fine wine. Taste is well-balanced with some initial banana notes leading to a sweet and complex finish. A whole lot of complexity since it varies in description and sensation minute by minute, but always pleasing. Feels great in the mouth, steady stream of bubbles from center of tulip, and so drinkable that it's dangerous. Truly a remarkable brew."
"This is a nice foamy smooth beer in the mouth. Goes down way too easy for it's 9% ABV. This is an outstanding beer."
"Little too carbonated for my liking. I cant picture the drink location for this. Hot day? I dont think this is a winter beer."
"Poured out a lemon/golden color, with a bubbling head. Head calms to a thick cap of bubbly foam. Good lacing. Smells of sherry, port, apple cider, citric, and bready. Tastes light and fruity, with a slight citric hop character, finishing with pepper and alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is effervescent, light and refreshing."
"Excellent beer, I am glad I finally made the plunge. Very drinkable, even with 9% alcohol."
"This is a world classic and with due respect toward the also excellent Duvel, quite possibly the gold standard of the style."
"The beer poured a rich old gold with a good amount of effervesence developoing a fine white head with a few tan hints in it. The aroma was of citrus, bananna, and sweet malt underneath. The taste is sweet malt with a hint of citrus and some bananna, this is followed by a blast of spice and an alcohol burn in the finish. The feel is smooth oily, and effervescent. This a wonderfully drinkable beer. A fine example of a style that goes down easily."
"My first trippel and purchased due to rave reviews from friends. Initial pour had lots of white head, yellow-irange in color. Aroma of citrus at first, but with another smell I was able to pick out some bananas. Active palate, with plenty of carbonation. Had a yeasty, citrusy taste. Finish was bitter and alcoholic. At first I wasnt that big a fan, but as I sipped more, I enjoyed it and detected some peppery taste. I guess I'm not much of a coriander guy. I particularly enjoyed the last of the 750 ml bottle. A good beer and Im glad I tried it."
"Golden with lovely thick creamy head. Banana, spice, some sour notes, bubblegum in both smell and taste. Intense flavours. My wife reckons rhubarb but I'm not so sure. Strong alcohol is noticeable. Sweet on finish, then lingering bitterness. Lovely fine carbonation, oily mouthfeel. An excellent beer, but alcoholic taste may limit how many can drink."
""
"This one definitely lived up to its hype. Plenty of fruity flavors along with hidden alcohol. This one is at the top of the list of Strong Belgian Ales. Go get it. NOW!"
"d - you can taste the alcohol as expected but as it warms becomes pleasant and understated. complex beer."
"D- Easy and refreshing, I will pick this up sometime next summer."
"Very crisp citric mouthfeel with a subtle warming sensation from the alcohol. Very palatable and drinkable, the only hindrance being the strong ABV. Excellently crafted and balanced; it's brews like this that make brewing seem like a true art form."
"wow. my first unibroue and i'm hooked. very very smooth. creamy with citrus notes. bannana and clove. all good things. love it, but not as much as i love having 3 more in the fridge. not overly familiar with the style. i was really suprised at the alcohol content. it's extremely smooth for being 9%."
"Drinkability: One of the best in the style, good work, Unibroue."
"I wish I could drink this everyday."
"Pretty nice head with good carbonation. Nice aroma with hints of bannana. Now for the first taste of the night. I find this to have a nice fruity character with a slight warming aftertaste. I really am surprised by the 9% ABV. This beer hides it 's strength well. Very pleasant mouthfeel for this brew. Overall this is an excellent beer that I highly recommend."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Way too easy to drink given it's ABV."
"D: A great Belgian Pale, with phenomenal fruity character and fantastic balance."
"D- a very drinkable beer, especially for one with a 10% abv, could drink quite a few of them before noticing how drunk you are"
"Perfect texture with spot-on carbonation & a wonderfully balanced body. All put together, this is a dangerously drinkable beverage although that is at least held in check by its powerful 9% ABV. The best Ive had from Unibroue thus far."
"This is the epitome of a great beer. I don't think it could get any better. WOW!"
"D: Very drinkable in my opinion. The potency and excellent melding of flavors make this particular brew very easy to drink. Not to heavy and not to light, it nailed the right combination."
"Very drinkable for the style, I was ready for a second glass."
"D - I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time - not because of the alcohol, but because I wouldn't want to ruin the moment. Extremely drinkable and a complex taste lead to one of my favorite yearround brews."
"The alcohol is apparent - extremely welcome however. What a beautiful taste, the unique yeast strain, balanced malt and hops and a slight tartness. The spicing is just perfect. It has the drinkability of a thirst-quenching witbier in a very complex, gourmet beer. This could be enjoyed with about any dish you'd like: strong enough to stand with aged cheese but smooth and quaffable enough to enjoy with fish or a salad. After a few sips gets a peppery aftertaste."
"D- Despite strong yeast presence and high ABV, this is one of the easiest beers on lees to drink. I know from experience in my youth as I would split a six pack with a friend and get quite drunk. For the moment, enjoying a single beer with my meal and feeling great!"
"final verdict- very enjoyable. Alcohol is well hidden."
"An exellent pairing with strong flavored cheese. As reviewer prior stated, didn't have the aftertaste of high alcohol content."
"Notes: Overall a fine beer, I dont think I would want to partake in multiples of this one in a session though, not for the alcohol content mind you , but more for the pervading sweetness of the drink. I tasted none of the tartness that some of the other reviewers detected however I still have 3 brews to go so I shall update the review as needed."
"Note - One of the greatest beers i have had to date. Very complex taste. I enjoyed this beer from start to finish. Worth evey penny i paid for it. Highly Recommended."
"Very drinkable if you want a good beer to enjoy the whole experience of drinking beer. Not good for a six pack during a ball game and nachos."
"If I were rating taste based on this beer vs. other Unibroue beers, I'd give it a 5. But since I'm rating to style and to my personal preferences, I'm giving it a 3.5. It's definitely drinkable, and I can't say I dislike it, but given the ever-growing number of beers I truly enjoy and the nearly infinite number of beers I've yet to try, I probably won't be laying down any more dough for this brew again any time soon."
"While I am not very experienced with the style, I liked it for what it was, a new experience and an obviously well crafted beer. I can't say I am hooked on the style or this beer but it makes for an interesting tasting experience. I will be trying this again down the road. To rate this beer, I am rating it based on the very little I know and how I enjoyed the experience. The fact that this thing has aroma and flavors all over the place scores hi with me, it is certainly multi-deminsional."
"edit 10/17/08: Very interesting to try this after much more beer tasting experience. Still a great beer, but have tasted many better sunce I wrote the review. The flaw here is that the brew is too sweet. I have adjusted my ratings today."
"Maybe the best beer I've had so far since discovering craft beers. Smells like banana, cloves, and some apricot, but this is definetly the most complex beer I've tasted. I first tasted pineapple.. apricots.. bubblegum.. sour apples.. then the medium hop-y bitterness hit me. I didn't taste any alcohol until I was almost finished with the bottle. Drinkability is high - I seriously could go for another one, but I'll be passed out on the floor mid-way through. The alcohol is very well-hidden."
"Pours hazy yellow with a fizzy white head. Aroma is yeasty and reminds me a citrus fruits, maybe pineapple? Yeasty flavors, tartness are present and alcohol isn't as apparent as I would expect, but its there along with hop biterness. The mouthfeel is fizzy and somewhat thin. This is pretty easy to drink considering the alcohol content."
"p.s i did this about a year ago and now I know how horriable corriander is if you use it in every damn beer you brew."
"Appearance is a cloudy golden color with a two finger frothy white head. The head goes down some but lasts throughout. Nice lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and of citrus. The taste is peppery and of yeast. Citrus, especially pineapple, is evident. I had this right out of the fridge and it got smoother as it warmed. Alcohol can be sensed but its not overpowering. Mouthfeel is carbonated but pleasant. Drinkability is very good, especially for a 9.0% ABV. LFDM may be too sweet for some but I found it very well balanced. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer that I will have again."
"Highly drinkable, I could drink this all night long."
"The pour into a shaker raises a one inch plus head, off white , very solid, but becomes rocky over time. Recedes to a still very thick layer that lasts the whole glass. The body is hazy yellow translucent. The nose is yeasty, sweet, a bit peppery, slightly hoppy. The taste echoes the smell, with a focus on pepper and yeast characteristics. The mouth is medium, but the carbonation is a tad too high for me. The yeast adds more fun to the drink when poured in. A tasty brew, and quite good with vodka sauce."
"L.F.D.M. pours a moderately cloudy light honey color with a generous, frothy, and slightly chunky head that settles into a creamy-foamy slick. Vivacious carbonation ascends from all sectors of the glass. Luxurious nose of honeyed grapefruit and banana with essences of clove, allspice, and a hint of coriander wrapped around the fresh yeast. An element of lime rind and citric acids adds brightness to the mouthfeel. A very nice brew, reminiscent of Brewery Ommegangs Hennipen."
"Drinkability is also wonderful. This brew is incredibly tasty and enjoyable to drink. It would be easy to drink too many of these."
"This Quebecoise is fantastique. I wish I had a bowl of poutine to go with it!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"I have had this beer before, but mixed with many others, and it didn't really take me by storm. This time, concentrating on it alone, it was a delight. I defintely see more in my future--until the world ends, anyway, which could be any day now. But this is great beer to drink while everything is crumbling around you."
"The beer was a medium body that left a nice warming feeling in the mouth from the high alcohol. It was a wonderful brew that must be taken with respect and sipped throughout the night."
"Warning: If you haven't tried Belgian Style Ales and do not want to pay the high price demanded for them ($8.00), Do not try this beer as it is highly addictive!"
"Drinkability: Fantastic - dangerously easy to drink, though the sweetness definitely caught up with me by the end of a glass. Slightly abrasive grassiness and mild but dry finish certainly kept this pleasant."
"Taste; very fruity with oranges and lemons, and there's some other fruits that I can't quite place. The spices and sweetness are almost to overwhelming for me. Some alcohol makes it's presence felt in the aftertaste pretty strongly. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and with the sweetness and abundance of spices this is a bit hard for me to drink."
"D: The alcohol in this is masked so well making this a highly drinkable belgian, but the spices would hold me to just one. An excellent beer."
"Overall: I was wondering what all the fuss was over Unibroue....now I know!"
"D: This is great for a hot summer day I would imagine, quite refreshing and tasty."
"A surprising, highly drinkable treat and a wonderful example of the style. A stark testimonial to the quality of Unibroue"
"Overall...wow! I just can't get over the quality of this beer. You MUST try this beer if you like strong Belgian style ales. Just amazing."
"Strong to say the least. Nice mixture of lots of flavors though."
"Feels really good so it's easy to drink but the 9%ABV is going to limit the intake to a certain degree. high quality stuff."
"A regular in my beer fridge, and another reason Unibroue is such an incredible brewery."
"this wasn't as good as i expected. the smell was the dominate part of this brew. the taste and smell were way off from each other. not a bad brew overall, i just thought it wasn't as good as it seemed. oh well. was worth the try."
"I'll be returning to this one."
"the smell is great, like fruits, nuts and spices, sort of reminds me of Christmas! The taste is beyond expectations, simply put, the best belgin beer brewed outside Belgium! Now that's saying a lot and the price is nice too, compared to the expensive imports from Belgium. I could drink these all the time but they can fil you up pretty fast but I would recomend this to anyone who wants to try a good beer!"
"Overall: This beer has a very pleasant flavor, even if it isn't my favorite Unibroue offering. The sweet and spice are the dominant flavors, which makes it a bit unbalanced for a Belgian Strong Pale in my opinion. Even so, if this were my beer during the end of the world, I would certainly be content to check out on this note."
"Pours a bright golden-yellow with just a touch of cloudiness and a giant, large-bubbled pure white head that lasts well and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is crisp and fruity, with citrus and pineapple obvious, along with a yeasty tone and some grains. Taste is malty, the bright fruitiness and bready notes blending well, and spices becoming apparent in the finish. A touch of hop bitterness is present, and the aftertaste is sweet. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, and very warming, and drinkability is excellent. Tripels aren't always my cup of tea, but this one is an exception. Well crafted and greatly appreciated."
"I would have rated the drinkability higher on this one if it weren't for the carbonation. The flavor is excellent once the bubbles die down a bit."
"D - Great beer. Not the best in the style, but highly recommended."
"La Fin Du Monde pours an attractive orange color with a thick off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. This is a very nice smelling beer, citrus fruit and clove both seem apparent. Has that typical belgian yeast character in the flavor. Some citrus like fruit flavors are noticeable and some alcohol toward the end too. Bubblegum also seems to appear and disappear quickly in the flavor. The carbonation is quite active and is prickly on the tongue. This is a very tasty beer, highly recommended."
"This poured a golden color with cloudiness. The head was huge and persisted for several minutes. The smell is floral with a hint of coriander. The taste is floral and a bit citrus like. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with the carbonation noted. This is a nice example of the style."
"Aroma was sour, yeasty, with a hint of apple, pear and some spicyness. Big white head with big bubbles hung around for about 5 minutes but dissipated quickly after. I have read about insane carbonation but the head in my glass was tame. A beautiful honey-yellow color with a few shades of orange trying to show through. Heavy carbonation on the palate but pleasant. Yeast and alcohol are immediately present but the alcohol is NOT over-bearing. I had to let this beer sit and mellow to get some sweet malt to come through all the yeast. I caught a whiff of hops as it warmed but not much bitterness to taste. I could drink two at a sitting but this Ale on Lees will warm you up. My first Unibroue and it was excellent."
"La Fin Du Monde is a great brew. It's certainly one of the best beers to come out of Canada, but realistically, it's not something that anyone could ever drink regularly. This is a special treat, a beer you keep in the fridge for a special occasion - graduation, the end of exams, finding a job. It's *not* for sipping in front of the television."
"This beer did have very impressive characteristics, but the taste just did not suit me. Glad I tried it though."
"If I have one complaint, it's that this bottle is overly carbonated. The taste is smooth, but all the bubbles exploding in my mouth adds harshness that impairs drinkability a bit."
"A truly great beer, and a great Belgian beer from Canada?Boyam I pleasantly surprised!"
"Overall a fantastic brew and a great value."
"Drinkability: the only thing that detracts from the drinkability of this beer is the alcohol presence in the taste - you can taste it, and so you're conscious of how much alcohol you're consuming. Very good beer."
"Overall: One of my favorite, if not favorite Belgian Strong Pale Ales."
"There's a hint of sweetness left; umm, tangy meyer lemon rind, key lime pie, kiwi garnish. Alcohol in a stinging aftertaste, but not negative. Crisp and beautiful. I'm too enthralled to give a better review in words, but my taste buds are singing."
"-Oelergud"
"The only knock I had against this beer was the mouthfeel. It was thinner than expected and the carbonation was a bit overdone. Otherwise, I would consider this beer to be in a category all its own."
"M&D: Medium body and creamy mouthfeel. I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time, but I would enjoy this again after a nice dinner."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, high abv limits this to two, maybe three per session."
"Comments: Excellently crafted! This is my favorite beer at this time. Awesome. Very well balanced & flavorful. High ABV hidden with finesse behind the wonderful flavors. This is truly a delicious Belgian-style beer from Unibroue..."
"tip - serve in a tulip, perfect for the nose and helps with the head just a bit. great to share with friends and family. just a great beer."
"I rank this just under their Don De Dieu because I love banana."
"La Fin Du Mond, ""The End of the World"". Well, if you haven't tried this wonderful Belgian Style ale from Unibroue, it might damn well be the end of your particular world. This is truely a great product. Great Nose, yeasty, nice ripe fruit. Full mouth feel. Taste is outstanding with a sharp malt taste and mild alcohol burn(mostly due to the high percent). An excellent North American Belgian style beer, you wouldn't know that it wasn't Belgian, if not for the label."
"A fantastic choice for a beer to enjoy with a meal. I would recommend this with any smoked seafood, as the nutty flavor would help the smoke flavor come out in the meal."
"Poured from a corked 750ml bottle into a belgian style tulip. Formed a nice white head with a huge amount of tiny little bubbles. Almost bubblegum like nose, citrus, and coriander. The bubbles dance on the tongue. Easy to drink. Nice yeasty aftertaste. A superb beer. Try the end of the world today."
"It took me 24 years to find my first one of these, it probably wont take nearly as long to find the second one. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is okay. Like I said, I'm not a huge belgian pale fan, but this one comes across nicely balanced and well flavored. The prickly feel on the tongue and stomach warming nature hurt this a bit. I just think that a clean, light flavor natured beer with a lot of carbonation shouldn't feel heavy on the stomach."
"¡Salud!"
"D - Very nice. Not my favourite Unibroue offering, but no complaints."
"Honestly, I prefer the Maudite from Unibroue, but that's like saying I prefer lobster to cavier. This is delicious beer that begs to be savoured."
"This is a beer I am going to have to revisit, as I don't have the pallete to pick out all the flavors. Very enjoyable but dangerous, especially because the drinkability is so high."
"This pours a orange yellow with a large white foamy head. The carbonation is seen with all the bubbles. It's almost champagne like. The smell is unbelievable. The first scent that comes out is the strong candy sugar along with lemon, pepper, and cloves. The taste has a real sweet candy sugar flavor along with pepper, yeast, wheat, and citrus flavors. The m/f is light and the flavors are very well mixed. For a high alcohol beer, there is almost no smell or flavor of the alcohol. This is an excellant beer that deserves it's high praise."
"Among my favorites. La Fin Du Monde never disappoints me when Im thirsty for an outstanding beer."
"Very drinkable beer, even at 9.0% ABV. Refreshing and tasty. Looks like I was wrong aboot those Canadians."
"I'd always wanted to try one of these beers from Unibroue... finally decided to give it a try and picked this one on a whim. I was extremely pleased! An excellent ale that will surely catch your attention if you try it. I will definitely be having this again."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer and must try! The best part is that every good beer store would have some in stock! I could have another one and I'm betting that this beer would really sneak up on you after a few!"
"All in all, great beer which showcases the unique Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Not as good as Maudite by the same brewer, but definitley worth trying if you haven't. Probably wouldn't buy this particular brew again because of the price, but I am very impressed so far with this brewery"
"Very, VERY drinkable. If you really wanna rock."
"Little carbonation but a perfect medium body that doesn't overwhelm you. Fiercely easy drinking for a 9% belgian strong pale. Alcohol is barely noticable, even after warming, and it doesn't get mundane."
"Overall: A great Belgian strong pale, heartily recommended. I still prefer Unibroues Trois Pistoles (a strong dark), however."
"Again I could smell this forever."
"I was ready for more after this bottle. I will seek this out again! One of my new favorites."
"cellaring some to discern the effects of age on this special brew. near ideal as it is, though!"
"Poured from a bottle with a best before date of 02-23-09. It poured a clear golden color with a fluffy white head. There are all types of things in the smell, some banana, some orange, and a bit of clove. The taste is sweet and spicy, the tight carbonation really adds to the peppery bite. The sweetness is like a Clementine. The mouthfeel is medium-light with plenty of carbonation. There is a slight alcohol warming from the 9%, but all the flavors hide it in the taste."
"Poured into a tulip with a golden/light orange body and a beautiful three finger head. Aroma is a wonderful mixture of pears, bananas and yeast and other fruits. Taste much like the smell as it has an array of fruits and a very crisp finish. This is a sensational beer that actually resembles a hefeweizen in both smell and taste. Definately a world-class offering from Unibroue and a must try!"
"I like this and will look for another bottle, hopefully fresher."
"D: The yeast character masterfully disguises the alcohol content, which, along with the smoothness, makes this beer very drinkable. This was the first beer that I’ve had from Unibroue. It has left me with the impression that this brewery doesn’t mess around."
"Drinkability: This is an awesome beer. Respect it."
"A brilliant pour, nice with a thin frothy head comprised of smallish white bubbles. The color is straw yellow/orange amzingly clear, I could actually view an upside down transposition of the spurs mavericks game in the convex of my snifter, kinda neat. The smell is faint, very little if any aroma for my nose, a bit of soft yeasty sugar and some grassy organic notes. The taste is a knock out, a great smooth, sweet fruity beginning, a nice flowing center where the alchohol becomes more pronounced but not overbearing, then a mildly dry finish gives way to the creamy yeast notes. Really good. The mouthfeel is very full and creamy...which is offset nicley by the tingle of carbonation that rises while to beer is in your mouth. An unbelievably drinkable masterpiece, almost quaffable at...what...9% abv...remeber to call a cab if you are out with this one."
"This was okay I suppose..."
"ale from here in North America. I will definitely be seeking this out again."
"Overall: In my view, the best abbey triple available in Ohio. Beers from Unibroue are usually found here in very good condition, unlike some of the true Belgians which sometimes sit on store shelves for months or longer with wide variations in storage temperature. This is simply an outstanding beer and the epitome of the style."
"Wow, I'm truly impressed by this beer. Before this, I, like many others, sadly thought Labat and Molson was about it when it came to Canadian beer. I'm anxious to try some other Unibroue offerings. Great all-around beer that becomes and instant classic for me."
"Drinkability: Oh so good and it makes me feel good."
"Overall, a strong contender in the Belgian Strong Pale Ale category. I enjoy Duvel more, but this is definitely worth a try."
"Given the strength of this beer I was quite surprised by the taste and drinkability of it. Although it is strong this aint your brown bag beer...this one is great for sipping anytime. Would drink again. Thx."
"D: Very good"
"Drinkability- the High ABV catches up to you quickly, best in moderation"
"Drinkability - Great! Goes down easy. I have pretty well destroyed a 750 ml in the last 45 minutes, so watch out. It is easy to drink quick but a shame to not enjoy."
"Maybe I should have chilled it at least a few minutes."
"Pretty decent beer. Not the greatest thing ever in my opinion, but pretty darn good."
"This is a big beer. Lots of yeast, clove spiciness and banana. Nice golden haze. Head goes bye-bye really quickly. Good lacing, while it lasts. As with most Unibroue beers, there is almost too much carbonation. There is a bit of a sour finish. Seems more like a tripel than a strong pale ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Best before 6/12/06, enjoyed on 11/7/05. Pours a murky, pale yellow/orange with a medium sized, fizzy, white head. Mostly diminishing. Aroma is banana, orange, lemon and cloves. The flavor is very refreshing, oranges, apricots and bananas. The lively carbonation bites the tongue on the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. This one was quite enjoyable."
"A 750ml bottle. It was a cloudy yellow color with a small head and a little bit of lacing. It had a spicy fruit odor with some malt undertones. Taste was wonderful: fruit (citrus) with some nice spiciness that provided a lingering warmth. A little bit of hops. Very good mouthfeel, although a tiny bit too carbonated. Good beer, very drinkable. Reminds me a little bit of La Chouffe."
"A great belgian-style ale for any occasion. Very invigorating for its 9% abv...be careful or this beer might kick your ass..."
"Another quality ale by Unibroue"
"Kudos to Canada!!!"
"Again, this is not a bad beer, but I cannot understand why this beer gets these very high grades."
"Smooth and carbonated very refreshing and has a lemon zest to it not like any I've had before. This is a great Belgian Pale and thought nothing would beat Duvel, I was wrong. I hope the end of the world is this good!!!"
"A good beer, but I'm afraid I'm not a huge fan of the style. There's something about it, more than just the color, that reminds me of a cheaper wheat beer. Also, it doesn't hide the booze as well as say, Delirium Tremens. I'd drink it again for sure, but I would be reluctant to pay $8.xx for 4."
"Definately one of Unibroue's finest."
"I have only tried two Belgian Strong Pale Ales (Delirium Tremens being the other one), The La Fin Du Monde is very similar, but slightly better IMHO. Pours a cloudy dull gold/straw color with a nice carbonated head that slowly dissipates. Little to no lacing. Prominent nose of citrus...lemony aroma. The taste is really good....citrus, astringent, sweetness, All nicely balanced and very drinkable. The taste reminds me of Hefe's but the mouthfeel is richer. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well disguised, I could have enjoyed another one. Three would be be pushing it because of the high ABV. This beer, Delerium Tremens and Aventinus have sharpened my palate for astringent beers. This one deserves the reputation it has. Truly a great beer."
"Easily the most luscious and inviting head I've had the pleasure of seeing. It reminds me of the frothy top of a handmade milkshake; imparting the impression that it was homemade with lots of love. Body is straw colored gold with light carbonation. I would call the nose lemony, but with the disclaimer that it is in no way sour. Also along for the aroma ride is a smell I can only call pleasantly milky and a hefty amount of spice. Taste is at once full of mildly sweet lemon, spice, a dash of sweet milk, and smatter of bitterness. Says I to the mouthfeel, ""a winner is you"" as it is big and full. The light carbonation enhances its creaminess. The lacing looks like a work of art, or more aptly, something drawn from a nitro tap. Yet another head turning Unibroue beer. Thank you Beer Advocate, for had I not become a member, I would not know the pleasure of this fine brewery."
"D - moderate drinkability"
"Orangey apricot color appearance. Fairly murky too. Nice 3mm head remains throughout. Smell is clean and fruity. Taste is deep rich blend of fruitiness and some excellent effervescence on the mouthfeel. This is an often overlooked beer. It is tremendous."
"D - Very drinkable. Another excellent brew from Unibroue. Would highly recommend and buy again."
"I remember the 750ml I had a while back to be a tad better..maybe that's because by the time I was finished with that, I was not in the same state as I am now. A great North American-made Belgian..and another feather in the cap for Unibroue."
"Big, generous white head sits atop the hazy, golden-yellow body. A fresh, airy aroma of fruit features on the nose. Delicately spicy malt appears on the palate. Yeasty, slightly bready flavors give way to a semi-sweet medium finish. The ample head on this beer (not to mention the high ABV) belies its smooth, accomodating nature. La Fin Du Monde is highly satisfying and rewarding. This beer is becoming a classic in its own right."
" Mouthfeel is wine-like. I would call this medium bodied. Carbonation is slightly higher than expected, but overall it works well with this strong ale."
"Superb experience!"
"The beer pours out a straw gold, and has a magnificent head that stays around for minutes and leaves lacing down the side of the glass.. Has a very clean taste. The beer is very strong, but the alcohol is subtle. Excellent example of a non-Belgian Belgian; the flavor is very authentic, and can stand toe to toe with any Beligian tripel that I've tried. I definately recommend it"
"Where is the alcohol? This brew is damn drinkable for a 9%... another in a long line of many winners from Unibroue."
"Outstanding vision pours into the glass. Thick white head topping a hazy golden beer. Great retention and lacing. Aromas or citrus and bananas loft and linger even when the glass is away from your nose. Flavors of cloves, citrus, yeast and crisp sweetness. I could hardly sense the 9.0% alcohol in this beer. Outstanding!"
"Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, well-carbonated, texture like a wheat ale. Style exists somewhere between a Belgian tripel and a hefeweizen. Widely available and eminently drinkable, enough to get you into trouble."
"Even with a slow pour, this brew has a huge, fluffy, brilliant white head. Lots of yeast sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Not much head retention, fades to a paper thin white line. Color is light orange, very cloudy and lots of carbonation. Decent aromas of fruits, cider, yeast, apples and pears. Very well rounded taste, fruity, tart and sweet all at once. Alcohol is not a factor. Awesome mouthfeel, this beer dances all over your tongue and leaves you wanting more. So easy to drink and very enjoyable. My first from Unibroue. A great sipper. I will certainly try more of their beers."
"I am on a hunt for this beer in my hometown. Not to be missed, and cheaper than a true Belgian, for everyday drinking."
"Very drinkable...another amazing Unibroue...boy , can they make beer!"
" This is a quality product. It's not perfect but definitely deserves a place among the better Grand Cru types."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty light and no real warmth gained from the 9% alcohol content. But The hops are noticed more on the back of the palate with all the sweeter stuff shocasing in the front. Th ecarboantion helps to enhance the flavors all around."
"I'm not sure why, but I seem to think ""Imperial Wit bier"". Fantastic beer for the value, and great for a warm night outside on the balcony."
"Again... Absolutely great."
"la fin du monde is a medium yellow with heavy carbonation and a billowy, thick white head. i smell fruit and cloves and something faintly peppery(?) that i can't quite nail down any better than that. it tastes fruity sweet with the aforementioned peppery. dry and somewhat hot alcohol finish. this is an interesting and very drinkable potion."
"12oz. bottle: This beer come out of the bottle quite fizzy, leaving quite a head. It dropped away to nothing almost immediately. The beer itself is a cloudy, darker golden color. This has a very nice aroma. The spiciness (pepper and corriander) is the first thing that you note, followed off by a citirc breadiness. There is still a touch of the fiziness to the tongue, quite suprisingly. The taste is that of a good medium bodied beer, but the carbonation makes it taste lighter. Notes of breadiness, citrus and corriander to the taste. A very nice tripel."
"Wow. This stuff is good. I've just moved to Canada (from England) and I was perusing the shelves of a local liquor store and bemoaning the cost of import beer (UK and Belgium stuff costs a fortune here). I picked up a bottle of Unibroue Terrible and got into a conversation with a lady that was grabbing armfuls of Unibroue stuff. Anyway, to cut a long story short, she bought all the La Fin Du Monde they had, but told me it was great! I took my bottles over to the counter and found she'd bought a bottle for me! Thanks lady. I just finished gulping most of it down. It reminds me of one of my favourite Belgium beers - Delerium Tremens. It pours a hazy golden colour and once settled is very quaffable. Excellent stuff and I shall be trying more of this in the very near future."
"I'm delighted by the massive, three finger head on this brew. Retention is nice and lacing is also fine. Color is a deep orange/tan, and is very cloudy. Smell is a wonderful mix of citrus flavors, spice, wheat, and slight floral characters. Tastes very complex and strong. Spicy citrus, orange, lemon, etc, in a bready malt mix, which is both sweet and tangy with a slightly sour finish in which the 9% alcohol is well disguised. Immense carbonation strikes the edeges of the tongue, and the feel is rich with a nice medium body. Coats the palate well. With a near perfect balance of flavors it is a very drinkable selection, and a must have to be kept in your fridge at all times..."
"after i hit bpeters2 with the cork, we poured it. poured tan, orangy color with a huge foamy head. odor was spicey, kind of nutmeg-like. Taste was pretty darn delicious. nutmeg, cloves, spices. an excellent sour quality that i really liked. smooth. delicious. this is great stuff. not too spicy or harsh like some other belgian strongs. mmm. maybe i'll get another Unibroue for next month."
"I've loved this beer (and a few of the other Unibroues) for a long time, but this is my first time reviewing it. Pours a hazy gold with bubbles continuously fighting upwards from the bottom of my Duvel glass. Beautiful nose, big but still delicate, with loads of fruits and cloves... and an underlying nectary sweetness. Taste is huge, with fruity sweetness, clove, and a peppery alcoholic tinge. Lots of effervescent bubbles on the tongue and a nice, long, warm finish. This isn't a beer you can knock back (due to the ABV), but it's so rich in its flavors and light in its touch that it doesn't matter. You get a night's worth of flavors in one glass. Phenomenal. Vive le Quebec!"
"D: There's nothing amazingly original about this beer, but it is excellent all regards, and I will be drinking more of this in the future."
"Hazy yellow with thick head. Loads of retention with webby lacing. Sweet fruity nose... bananas and yeast with slight alcohol hints. Similar taste with a light spicy character to it. Smooth crisp taste with sharp but somewhat sweet alcohol flavor and warming. This is a great beer."
"Drinkability: Exceptional, but at 9% ABV the night wouldn't last very long"
"I've got a corked 750mL resting at home for me, so I'll give it another go with that one in a couple of years. Fin du Monde is a truly wonderful achievement from the people at Unibroue. I'm just glad that this was the first brew that led to my appreciation and enjoyment of finer beers. A great discovery."
"A fine interpretation of the style. Very quaffable, but really sneeks up on you. Hard to believe it is 9%."
"Served in a corked bottle conditioned 750ml bottle with freshness date. Pours a cloudy straw color with a large frothy head and last a while. Smell has hints of fruits, some pear scent. Taste is well rounded with tastes of yeast, malt, fruit, and some slight acidity. Tastes great and has some warming effect from the 9% ABV. Mouthfeel is good, fills the tongue with flavors. Very drinkable."
"This might sound dumb, but I could drink this all day. (Well, at least until I passed out!). This is delicious, complex, crisp, delicate and robust at the same time. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2 1/4"" white head above the translucent dark golden brew. Pillowy head lasts and lasts, a product of the active bubbling from the bottom of the glass, with ample sticky white lacing. Aroma is effervescent spicy pale malts. Taste is that Belgian-style spicy malt that we all know, closing with the most subtle alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is nice, but could be a bit smoother, and drinkability is only limited by the fact that the sweetness and alcohol finally begin to wear after awhile. A nice treat after a snowy day."
"Overall, this is a fine sipping beer meant to be savoured over a span of an evening. However, that said, I tend to lean away from most sipping brews."
"This is an excellent beer. Well balanced, and each sip leaves you wanting more. A little strong to drink a lot of, but an excellent choice that I will buy again."
"This gets a bit cloying after a bit, but overall this is a pretty drinkable beer. Enjoyable, but not for everyday."
"The taste started sweet and finished crisp and clean. I could taste malt, but not really a lot of hops. It felt incredibly lively in the mouth and was a pleasure to drink from beginning to end. Easily, this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Poured a light foamy and highly carbonated brew from my 750ml bottle. Unibroue always gives you away with their highly malty smell. Taste was rather sweet with ripe apples in the palate. Incredible smooth going down; fairly light body. I could drink this all night as it compares to a fine champagne. An excellent beer to toast with. Alcohol is very warming."
"No problem puttin this stuff away, I mean consuming. It's not my first and doubt it will be my last...cheers!"
"All in all I'd say it is one of the best beers available to me, and always a safe bet if I don't know which beer I want on a given night."
"This is insanely drinkable for 9.0% ABV. I must have been insane to only buy one bottle!"
"Very nice."
"This beer might not be a great session beer. The alcohol content is a little high. The flavor, though, is great, and not overly aggressive. This beer is definately worth a few tries."
"Served in a Unibroue snifter glass at Twains in Decatur, GA. Pours a hazy orange / yellow color with a massive sudsy white head (2+ inches). Impressive lacing that curtains the entire glass as I drink. The beer has a Spicy (cloves & nutmeg) and citrus fruit aroma, very nice. A gentle but full flavor of citrus and cloves with a very carbonated mouth feel. The taste includes some bread and banana notes as well. This is a really good beer. Everything I have had from Unibroue has been a smash hit."
"Notes: Please pick this up if you see it in the store. You will be glad you did."
"Despite the problems, it's highly drinkable if this style of beer is a favorite, but it's got nothing on the true Belgians in this style. I prefer the top-notch Maudite or Trois Pistoles when it comes to Unibroue."
"Overall- An excellent brew, but watch out the 9% abv will get you. Quality brew that is a staple in any beer lovers fridge. A fantastic brew!"
"This is a very intersting and enjoyable brew. Unibroue has another winner here."
"DIt will be a challenge to wait to drink the other 3.I love this beer and want to drink all four right now."
"D = 3.5"
"This beer poured a pale hazy amber color, with a foamy head about two finger-widths in height. Ther aroma was light and slightly fruity. The taste was mildly fruity, with a definite spicyness. only mildly bitter and quite smooth. this was a very drinkable beer and i enjoyed it very much."
"Drinkabity is extreme considering the ABV."
"Poured a hazy golden color into an oversized wine glass, thick and foamy white head exhibits nice retention before slowly giving way to heavy lacing. Smells of malts and spices, citrus, yeasty bread, slight sting of alcohol present on the nose. Tastes absolutely incredible, hits with citrus and hops first, then a little fruiter, banana flavor present some, finishing a little on the yeasty side with the malt flavor and a slight bite from the 9% abv that is easily forgotten when drinking this lighter ale. Mouthfeel is slick and moderately carbonated. Drinkability the lowest point of this brew, and although suprisingly light and refreshing as this ale is, still has far too complex of a taste and too high of an abv to want to just drink any more than two or three of these exsquisite brews in one sitting. Hats off to Unibroue with ""The End of the World."""
"This beer poured a slightly hazy, golden color with a half inch head. The aroma was fruity and also had undertones of bread/yeast. The taste was of candi sugar, citrus and sweet malt. Very tasty and without a doubt has a Belgian character. The finish was spicy and slightly alcoholic with the sweet/candi sugar taste making itself known again. This beer is a treat for sure, but 2 bottles is my limit. The 9% abv sneaks up on you if you're not careful."
"This is a truly exceptional Belgian Pale Ale. Just a shade less good than the vanguard of its class, Duvel. Pours a nice fizzy head with very tight carbonation. Taste is of all the good things you'd expect from the triple-fermentation process: currants, cinnamon, pepper, coriander. A bit heavy on the carbonation to score higher in mouthfeel, and its high ABV takes away from its drinkability. But there are few better ""sippers"" in the world..."
"Crisp, refreshing, but also feels heavy. A decent after dinner brew to sip and relax with."
"Light copper color with a fluffy white pillow of a head. Loads of tiny bubbles continuously rising to the surface. Lots of sticky lacing. The aroma is dominantly yeasty with some pepper and spices and a little orange zest. Biscuity taste with a nice spicy yeast taste. The champagne like mouthfeel helps make this a very refreshing beer."
"Cheers!"
"What's wrong with Unibroue? Jesus I've had so many of their styles and they all have been awsome, this doesn't happen!! Anyway this stuff pours a hazy orange color, non-long lasting head. Taste is a combination of dried apricot and yeasty notes with some alcohol, it blends all perfectly. Nice mouthfeel and finish. I'm glad Unibroue is widely avaliable in Maine, even if it wasn't I could make a road trip to Quebec. This is what beer should be!!"
"M & D: Very carbonated, almost takes away from the belgian taste. Love that its a high abv--can't taste the alcohol. Very smooth and refreshing with a nice dry fruity (pear) after taste. Drinkability is pretty high, on a summer day of course whlie basking in the hot sun."
"Drinkability: Despite the 9% abv, the ale is very drinkable, tasting so smooth and balanced, one does not even realize the alcohol until it is WAY too late. An excellent ale from a top notch brewery."
"This is very smooth for being a 9 percent ale. I'm reviewing outside my favorite styles to try something different. I expected to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised."
"Still have a 750ml bottle aging..."
"A classic, really good beer."
"Its drinkable depending on how you handle the bubbles. I drank the3 of the 4 pack over the course of 5 or 6 nights. (The most recent on NYE.Champagne of Beers I tells ya!) And one was good enough per time. And even though the alcohol wasnt as present as Id figured, Id still be careful, because maybe after 2 it could creep up quickly. Great beer."
"This is an exceptional brew, but I think it lacks a little depth. Especially in comparison to the excellent Trois Pistoles I had the other night. The ABV is sneaky here too. A little too sneaky actually."
"Edit: I recently picked up a bottle and some wild, barnyard-like flavors were present and became quite cloying. It may have just been a bad bottle."
"The flavor of this beer is very prominent, but mellow enough with a light enough carbonation to make this very enjoyable."
"Really good."
"This is a good beer and I'm going to have to return to it and conduct a more thorough review. The 12 ounce sample wasn't enough to get a feel for this beer. It seems like it deserves its reputation, but I'll need to try some more to be sure."
"I was amazed when I notice the other day that I've never actually written a review of my favorite beer. Not much to say that hasn't been said, but I'll give it a shot. The beer is a beautiful golden hazy yellow, with a big foaming white head that soon dissipates. The nose is classic, fruity and yeasty. The taste is an amazing blend of citrus, malt, and slight sweetness, with the littlest hint of hops. Incredibly drinkable for a 9.0% ABV. This is my go-to beer when I'm just looking for something great to entertain friends or kick back and relax."
"M&D: lively upfront and turning softer as it goes; the alcoholic warmth is pretty restricted and makes this drink more devilishly-drinkable than the famous Duvel!! although in the end the sticky sweet aftertaste proves a bit too much to my liking. That said, this is THE top dog in my book for the style of Belgian Strong Pale Ale!"
"This is an excellent beer, and one that I sometimes overlook. I really shouldn't. A year or more in the cellar will probably make this beer that much more extraordinary, and I have a couple down there waiting to find out."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with loads of white foam that sits statuesque and leaves behind intricate lacing patterns. Aromas of candy, alcohol, oranges, and white grapes seem to come out; very complex and enticing. The taste is a brilliant blend of fruit & hop bitterness and sweet candy. The limited carbonation and sour backbone of this beer work very well together. The texture is a bit sticky and mildly astringent; the only flaw I can really pin point with this beer. Despite the high ABV and the assertive flavors in this beer, it is very easy to drink and enjoy."
"This poured to a very quickly dissipating head leaving a slightly transparent golden brown brew. This stuff smells absolutely amazing. Honey and Bananas moved to the nose quickly by the very active carbonation. Taste is good, very full bodied, the High ABV is slightly apparent but warming. Mouthfeel is decent, a lot of carbonation in this that makes it something meant to be sipped slowly and carefuly. This is a good beer, especially on those cold days where it feels like it is the end of the world. Warms you right up."
"Notes: A well crafted Belgian brew. Truely is a fine example of North American breweries being able to keep up with the traditions from Belgium."
"This beer reminds me of the time that I went to Montreal. Granted I was a little under the weather and not with it the entire time, I had a great beer called, I think it was called, Boreale. If I recall correctly these beers are very similar and this Unibroue reminded me of the great times I had in Montreal. So in that case I say it is VERY drinkable. This brewery really captures the essence of Canada like a good Canadian brewery should. I would recommend any Unibroue to anyone."
"750 mL bottle, corked & caged, 2004 vintage. Pours a light golden amber into an oversized wineglass with a fluffy and billowy white head. Lovely citrus and yeasty-bready malt aroma; sweet orange and peach scents abound. Taste is a dry-sweet peach bread with golden raisins; spicy yeast and a strong dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and juicy. The 9% alcohol is utterly imperceptible. Absolutely sublime."
"i highly recommend this one. my favorite of all the unibroue's to date."
"Drinkability: Man, I could drink these suckers all night. Super refeshing and crisp. Not overly sweet and hops won't kill the palete. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste profile but you can definitely feel its warmth. A fantastic beer that is well worth anyone's time to seek out and enjoy."
"M: Light to medium body, bubbly over the tongue, smooth."
"This is a great beer. Another exceptional beer from unibroue."
"Notes: Simply beautiful presentation. Silver foil around the top of a bottle that slopes to resemble a woman's shoulders. Very inviting, and very tasty."
"I would highly recommend this. If you like sweet beers this one is for you."
"Thanks for the bottle Len!"
"This brew is big on head as it pours into a tulip glass. The yeast clouds the orange hue and swirls through the glass. The aroma is a flower that I just can't place. The taste is a sweet, peppery spiced ale; the alcohol is pronounced as is the yeast and malt. The consistency is smooth and chewy, a true mouthfeel. The drinkability suffers only because for what ever reason the brew dries out my sinuses everytime I dirnk it."
"Mouthfeel: carbination is perfect. it is high dont get me wrong but it works exceptionally well with this beer"
"It's taken me long enough to get around to this one and I'm glad I did! This one poured a nice light golden color with a slight haze and great carbonation bubbles. The head was very thick and frothy and managed to stay around till the last sip. The smell was very fruity and spicy due to the belgian yeast. The taste was outstanding with large pinapple notes and peppery spice mixed with a near perfect carbonation level that made for a great experience. If you are a fan of Belgian beers this one is defiantly worth a try!"
"Very nice! Smooth, almost creamy and very dangerously drinkable."
"Enjoyable to drink, with a body and fizz not unlike champagne. Only detractor in this case is ABV vs bottle size."
"One of the great beers of the world, even better than the Duval that inspired it, in my opinion."
"A really nice beer that i am glad to have sampled. Not one you want to pound due to the high alcohol but I could see how you could down 2 or 3 without realizing it. Also one that you want to savor and enjoy slowly for all the complexity. I would highly recomend this one."
"Unbelievably drinkable. This is one belgium strong that i can have as a session beer. Love it!"
"The taste was excellent, with an complexity as rich as I've tasted. Bananas, citrus, and clove were most present while sweet candy, yeasts, hops and fruits were defintiely there in spades. It was extremely creamy and enjoyable, with mild carbonation. This is truly an excellent beer."
"I will say it needed a tad more malt backbone and fruits in the quaff  which is pretty nitpicking, this is still a quality beverage."
"Drinkability: This is dangerously drinkable. The flavors are very much balanced. I wish I had more."
"Poured a gorgeous golden amber color with massive white head that left attractive lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is loaded with summer fruit (peaches, apricots) with a hint of alcohol noted. Sweet, candy-like aroma. Taste is spicy with more summer fruits to be found. Peaches, pears abound. Alcohol provides a warming note. Very carbonated feel with a bit of alcohol at the finish. an excellent beer."
"Pours a gorgeous crisp golden with a monsterous head that will rise from the glass. The smell is of banana yeast and butter cups. A nice buttered bread with honey tones. The taste is a banana spice with a nice sweet banana breat nutty finish. A well rounded explosive beer. Very nice."
"A clean warm finish. Nice for this first cold Western new york night. Perhaps not the end of the world here, but we're close by."
"How convenient. I even have a La Fin Du Monde glass to drink this beer from. Its an attractive bottle with its nice-looking front label, informative back label (recommend what glassware to use and warns about the yeast sediment), foiled cap and.... twist off cap? Strange, but whatever, Im not going to knock points of for something like that. Pours a light yellowish-amber with very small particles swirling about but never settling like the sediment I avoiding pouring out of the bottom of the bottle. I guess maybe I jarred the bottle a bit while pulling out of the back of the fridge. The head is very large, white, frothy and stubborn, diminishing very slowly leaving thick lacing just as it sits and slowly fades away. Almost looks like a meringue sitting on top of the beer. The smell is sweet and fruity, with wonderful aromas of Belgian yeast, clove and apple. The taste is marvelous! Clove, pepper and pear with a slightly medicinal twang... but in a good way. Finishes warm with lingering esters. It has a light body, and an effervescent mouthfeel that finishes smooth. This is a fabulous beer thats quite easy-drinking for a 9% brew. The higher price tag is the only think keeping from being a staple in my fridge."
"Ok, so I'm gonna change my rating. I'm finding everything almost perfect this time with the exception that I'd like to see it clearer and not so cloudy."
"Unibroue makes fine products and this is not exception. As I mentioned above, I have this somewhat regularly and I anticipate many happy returns."
"Yet another tasty Unibroue product. Pours a hazy gold with a generous white head. Aroma is yeasty sweet malts. some spicy cloves and banana. Taste is sweet malt with a spicy hop finish. Only traces or hints of alcohol. I do not know how they do it but this is a beer that truly hides its gravity."
"Cloudy fuzzy peach yellow with a large big-bubbled head. Smell is spicy, touch of ginger, citrus rind and Belgian yeast. Taste is dry, oh so arid, with rind and zest kicking in, the finish is long and hits like allspice, coriander, and some essence of clove. Mouthfeel is full on the top of the palate but dry underneath, very complex and satisfying. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV. This is a choice replacement for an aperitif cocktail or a dry wine. Next cocktail party, offer up a taste of this to your guests. They'll thank you."
"I'll have to find someone to give the rest of this 4-pack to."
"Anyway, my theory is Unibroue released its one or two lousy beers solely to make its mostly awesome beers taste better. Smart, eh?"
"This is very, very drinkable--dangerously so, with its 9% ABV. There's a pleasing sharpness to the flavor and mouthfeel that comes out better at a temp a bit lower than what might be recommended; when you try it, pour at fridge temp or just above and let it warm, and I think you'll enjoy it immensely."
"This is really nice in what it is trying to accomplish, its up there with Duvel, etc.; and is certainly less sweet than some of the Belgians. If beginners into craft beer could get by the high alcohol, this certainly is a beverage that could tease and convert the casual drinker to explore craft and Belgian beer."
"This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly, savored."
"750 ml corked bottle. After the cork exploded off the bottle, this beer poured out a hazy orange, with a big white head. Aroma is yeast, spice, and fruit. Tropical fruit flavor, especially apricots, pineapple, and mango. Spicy, with pepper and cloves, but not as spicy as most of their dark beers. No hop flavor. Sweet, but not overly sweet. This tastes very much like a Belgian beer. Full mouthfeel. Absolutely no sign of the 9% abv. A truly world class beer."
"This is just one exceptional brew. The effervescense cleans your palate for the flavors that are immediately following. I will keep this as a regular in my selection and will also cellar a few."
"Notes: Certainly a very unique style that I have ever had very drinkable with a it's complex flavors. Cheers!"
"I have been walking past Unibroue bottles for a while now. Theres just so much out there, I never made it to these guys...I'll probably get further into their line this winter"
"A great beer. I thought this was a triple, and it pretty much is, but apparantly it's a strong Belgian pale. I could see that too I guess. Pours a cloudy yellowy amber color with a nice head, which lasts til the end. Nice. Very yeasty, estery, and fruity, with plenty of Belgian spices of course. Vanilla, clove, corriander... you name it. Nice bite to it too, not quite as delicate as most triples I'd say. A bit bubbly on the palate. All in all an excellent beer, with a nice little story behind it too."
"this beer requires a second for reflection. i ordered only one in a mix case of 14 different kinds, but next time i will order several. this beer kicks ass."
"D: Wish I had another 750ml of this right now, though I likely wouldn't be in a condition conducive to writing this review if I had it. This beer is eminently drinkable, but take your time with it ... let the complexity of this north of the border tripel come through as you nurse the offering. It's worth it. This is one of my favorite beers ... period."
"If you read this and think that there is another Belgian Strong Pale Ale that is better, please beermail me."
"End of the world or not, this beer is the best in the universe. It pours a perfect golden sunset, with about a one-inch cloud atop. The smell is full of various fruits probably from all over the earth, including asian pear, costa rican banana, and washington apple. Dances on the tongue, and goes down oh so smooth. Drink slowly, or it'll be la fin du tu!"
"Pours a vibrant golden yellow with a couple fingers of snow white head that is fuled by a steady stream of carbonation from the bottom of the chalice. Nose starts off with strong clove, bitter grapefruit, and citrusy hops. Taste starts with green apple skins, pear and pineapple, floral hops and yeasty malts. Mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly, finish is dry like champagne. This is a tasty little Belgian Pale, make sure to let it warm up as it starts a little bitter when it's cold."
"Drink this one at room temperature or slightly chilled. Flavors are very sharp and harsh when cold, round out rather nicely as it warms. Score reflects drinking at room temp/chilled."
"Truly a world class brew. In the Belgian Strong Pale Ale category, I say this bad boy makes Duvel seem like nothing. Highly recommended."
"Settled and deep yellow beer; triple fermentation; grassy and floral smell; taste wide, strong, well ballanced; full, bodied, high ABV (9%), a great abbey example; try with most of mexican and american cuisine, chinese too; use for cooking is great for marinade; serve in a goblet fo course; use like appetizer; 93% recommended."
"A nearly perfect beer. So complex, so intriguing, but also so drinkable. It's smooth as silk (even at 9% ABV you'd have to struggle to detect it) and fun to sip. I'll definitely be stocking up on this one."
"One of my favourite beers of all time. Pours a very cloudy orange, huge fluffy white head, lots of sticky lace all over the place. Smell is honey sweetness, orange, coriander, yeast, some floral notes. Taste is sweet and spicy, orange, citrus, and lots of bready yeast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high carbonation, with a refreshing and dry finish."
"Drinkability- Probably the best Strong BPA I have had. Extremely tasty and drinkable."
"I'm afreaid that perhaps the complexity of this brew was lost on my tongue? It is very good, but it seemed very ""normal"" belfian style sweeteness with some sweet graininess. Again, it was good, but nothng out of the ordinary here. Refreshingly active carbonation with moderately ligh body."
"1/2 as much as other Belgians. That's enough for my endorsement."
"From a 750ml cage-and-cork bottle, pale yellow-orange in color, hazy, with a fine creamy white head. Beautiful. Smells of grain, yeast, lemon and orange zest. Lightly spicy (coriander?). On the palate there is an alcoholic warming sensation. Sweet malt and grain, spicy again. Smooth and yet spritzy in the mouth, full-bodied, and oh so drinkable, with a dry finish. Appetizing."
"Ooooh. This is good! Poured out to a cloudy off gold color with a nice white foamy head and rings of lace surrounding the interior of the glass. Higher level of carbonation. Nice. Aromas of citrus and floral notes fill the nose. Some hints of malt and yeast are present. Very nice. Taste is not as present as the aroma, but still very quaffable. Flavors of malt, spice, clove and yeast blend together in very heavenly harmony. Complexity is abound in this beer. Mouthfeel is full and savory. Not too heavy as to hinder the experience of this beer, yet not too light as to make it airey. A solid level of drinkability. A 4-pack of this would have a shorter life in my fridge than a snowball in hell. Highly Recommended."
"The beer pours hazy lazy yellow/orange with a fluffly head. The nose is pure yeast and fruit, almost Saison-like in temperment. The taste is big and restrained; citrus notes to the back and hops mixed with yeast to the front. What makes this beer a fave of mine is the balance and drinkability. A truly great beer."
"Very good, but not as refined as might be wished. Good with food."
"Refreshing mouthfeel. Carbonation makes for a light beverage and nice mouthfell. Three or four of these and Im gone. A refreshing and pleasant winter warmer."
"Drinkability -- Nice beer. Good drinkability. No more than one .750 every once in a while. Watch out for that abv. Unibroue is top notch!"
"Drinkability  Superb drinkability for any style. Deceptively drinkable for a ~9% abv beer."
"In the mean time, I will definitely still buy and enjoy this while I'm waiting on bottles to age."
"Just a tad too much carbonation, which detracts from the moutfeel. But not too bad."
"Overall, its a good beer, I'll have to come back to this one again."
"The time between sips keeps decreasing. I am growing impatient as my body and mind crave for this beer's wonderful flavor. Is it possible that the name refers to how you feel when you realize that you just finished your last bottle? I wouldn't mind if this was my last beer at the end of the world."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Notes: One of my favorites for a long time, I finally got around to reviewing it. Those Unibroue characters really know what they're doing."
"Overall: I'm not a belgian connoisseur first and foremost. I had a hard time finishing this."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite cleansing. Smooth. Overall, this beer is still quite impressive though it was slightly less so than when I had it previously. I found the alcohol presence quite strong and this made it less drinkable. Of course, still a beer that I will have again."
"This is a fantastic beer. One of the first 'good beers' I tried and definitely as good as anything you can get in Belgian."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow hue with a nice frothy white head that retains well. Aroma is impressive and shocking, huge grape and citrus scents, candy sugar sweetness, floral hops, spices (corriander, clove, anise) and a fruity yeastiness. Taste is very complex, flavors of grape, lemon and orange peel, spices (corriander, clove, anise), candy sugar, bready malt and light floral hops and phenols. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a slightly sweet finish and slight alcohol notes. Extremely impressive and delicious, alcohol is barley noticeable, definately one of the best beers in the world."
"golden in color somewhat unfiltered looking. No lacing to speak of. Chunky cloud like head that was mountainous. High alcohol content is evident, had a bit of spicy but fairly mild in that department. complex ale, but fairly mellow in the body...Hops were subdued. Malt character was mostly fruity and balanced the hops, but hops were the man of the house. tempered by the warming for sure. I liked this brew and would reccomend this as nightcapper material or pre nightcapper if your a veteran."
"Recommended to fans of good beer.... this is the one that Quebec should be proud of."
"It's the end of the world as we know it et je me sens très bien!"
"Very good beer none the less. I definitely reccommend it."
"25 oz bottle shared at Zeno's. Pour into a tulip a nice cloudy golden color with a very thick and persistant white head. Smell is light- sweet fruity and yeasty. Taste starts with sweet malt which turns into a very nice fruit flavor which is difficult to place. Perhaps very sweet oranges. There is also some good spicy hop flavor to balance it out in the finish. Very balanced and tastey brew. This has a very nice medium full mouthfeel with some significant carbonation that suits this beer very well. This is 9% ABV but it's hard to tell from the taste- very well hidden. I have no doubt that it is in fact present however- this stuff hits hard. Dangerous and wonderful. ""End of the World"" indeed."
"D - Not very good. I think I'll steer clear of La Fin du Monde in the future. It wasn't a terrible beer, but for the price and the brewery, I expected more. Its strong point is that the 9% abv is obfuscated, probably under the powerful carbonation."
"I do, however, have a serious question, are you supposed to drink the sediment at the bottom? I did and found it raunchy. I would appreciate an answer because I plan to try it again."
"overall- where is that 9% hiding at? besides the very faint hint of alcohol in the aftertaste, its very similar to a beefed up hefe. very smooth with a hint of hops makes for a very enjoyable beer."
"Poured a hazy yellow color, with a small, egg shell colored head that left no lacing on the glass. Both the aroma and taste was full of sweet citrus, light sourness, yeast, and some alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated, its not one of my favorite Belgian styled beer, but its retty decent."
"D- Wow for having 9% ABV this was a very gentle smooth beer that had lots of good qualities and a nice finish."
"Overall though, a tasty unique Belgian-inspired brew that I will most likely try again when I'm picking up an assortment of singles."
"but other than that, it's disguised very well. not bad, not as good as I expected. Paid $8 for this bottle but would probably only pay about $5 or so. Overpriced for the quality in my opinion."
"Overall: Quite nice; I had been slowly trying the Unibroue line when I couldn't find other, ""weirder"" brews, but I might run through all of them now."
"Extremely drinkable, especially since it's 9% abv. Very nice and clean and a great Summer refresher."
"Brown with gold hints, and a pleasing aroma of yeast and citrus fruit. It strikes a great balance between fruit and yeast flavors too, along with some sweet floral notes. Quite carbonated, with no overpowering alcohol flavors. Refreshing enough to be consumed in hot weather, yet warming enough to be consumed in the winer. Well done!"
"Its the end of the review, and I am feeling fine!"
"Even though Belgiuns aren't my favorite, this beer was pretty good."
"12 oz. bottle, approximately a year old - best before 6/15/07. Served slightly chilled in a tulip glass. Pours a golden orange/yellow that is slightly cloudy and has a 1 inch white head that sticks nicely. Smells like orange juice, lemons, spiciness, pepper, yeast, and cloves. The orange juice aroma is slightly off-putting. The taste is virtually the same but with coriander and a mild bitterness. It is very malty with a lot of sweetness and a thick body with medium carbonation. It's good, but I remember it being even better than this."
"Drinkability: ""The end of the world"" packs a serious punch of flavors, aroma, and brain kick. Remarkably good, but you may end up at La Fin du Monde if you go to nuts with this one. This is such and awesome beer!"
"La Fin Du Monde is a wonderful effort and is an admirable example of its style. However, it lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi' and therefore doesn't quite equal the best BSPAs. That said, I'm savoring the final few ounces and I'm definitely feeling fine."
"Hazy straw, white fizzy head with decent stay-time. Complex aroma of peppery spiciness, peach,mango, and banana fruitiness, flower petals, and sweet grains. Flavor starts very sweet and orangy with aforementioned pepper and high carbonation spritz. Ends in a nice balance as the acidity and sweetness fade away. Phenolics seem a bit minerally in a pleasant way. Alcohol is rather hidden in the flavor but not the effect. Pleasant fuzziness sets in quickly with this brew. Very well-rounded, but strong flavors and solid spiciness. Well-made and complex."
"Pours a solid, cloud, pale orange color. The head is enormous, bright white and fluffy, and lasts for the whole glass. The aroma is of citrus fruits with floral and herbal notes. This beer smells fantastic. The taste is citrusy and tangy with some alcohol in the background. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied. Overall, this is a great brew, and very enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants something big and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"This beer poured a deep gold color, mildly hazy with a thick egg-white colored head. The head continues to refresh itself via a thin stream of champagne bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The nose has a mild bread-dough aroma up front followed by citrus/orange and grapefruit rind, some coriander spice, finished by a mild caramel malt. The taste has more of the citrus up front backed by the spice, finished nicely by the malt in the form of toffee. This beer has a wonderful carbonation, a light and bright mouth feel, and a high drinakbility. A great NA Belgian style ale."
"I drank the beer with the current brewer at Shed Brewery and surprisingly it wasn't putrid. The alcohol had continued to develop for at least 3 of those years, because it nearly burned our eyes. But the yeast characteristics and maltiness maintained. I wouldn't recommend aging to the length that I performed, but La Fin du Monde has a life of it's own, a fighting will to survive and to be the better beer. Enjoy and appreciate."
"Served in it's glass, a pale hazy yellow with 2 fingers of frothy white head and a small amount of lacing. Smell is spicy apple skins, tangerine, bubblegum, bananas, grass, wonderfully complex. Taste is like smooth rich banana pudding, with some oranges, apples, spices, and cloves all thrown in the mix. Superb. Velvety mouthfeel throughout, and alcohol that is absolutely hidden from sight, this is a dangerously tempting beer. One of the best Belgians I have ever tasted from right here in North America."
"Drinkability. Very tasty. It meets my expectations from this beer, but doesn't really exceed them very much...But that won't keep this beer from me."
"Cheers."
"Though this is a nice tripel ale, I don't give it the praise that others share. It doesn't have the malty-dry, cracker-like character and well attenuated sweetness of Chimay Cinq Cents (white label), nor with it's floral, spicy, earthy hop presence. This beer just tastes muted, sweet, and over fruity in comparison."
"The taste is quite exceptional, though. I would go so far as to guess that it has a lot to do with water quality. There is no metallic taste to the foam, which is actually almost more tasty than the beer itself. There is an ever so slight banana ester to the taste, along with a bit of clove. The mouthfeel is very smooth, not too dry, and not too alcoholic for such a high ABV brew. Very creamy and highly drinkable for such a heavy beer. Highly recommended."
"Very drinkable, although I have no idea why I didn't get a nice frothy head. Alcohol will get even more dominate when it warms."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Tastes just like it smells, yeasty and herbal. Really wonderful flavors here. Orange and spicy hops, just wonderful. Great mouthfeel too. A lot of Belgian pale ales seem too dry too me. This one is perfect. A little dry, yes, but doesn't leave you feeling thirsty."
"Superb!"
"Great mouthfeel, sticks around for a bit after you swallow, but no bad aftertaste or anything of that ilk. I could, and have, drank more than one of these at a time on occasion. You know it has more alcohol than your average beer, but it's sneakily hidden. A lovely beer on the whole- definitely worth checking out, as are most Unibroue beers."
"superb. absolute nectar."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp on the tongue. Medium bodied beer. The finish is dry and the flavor components ride the tongue long after swallowing. It is extremely drinkable and one of my favorite brews."
"The hazy straw color with frothy head that slowly disperses is quiet nice. The aroma is soothing and full of complex notes that sometimes remind me of lemon, yeast, and other highly aromatic herbs that lean towards the floral end. It is most deffinately an ale that lingers in your mouth while it dances about your palate with is spiciness. A true treasure in a bottle."
"Aroma reminds me of a witbier; strong zesty lemon, some fresh floral notes, and possibly some coriander. Big, foamy, pale cream colored head leaves strings of lace as it pops its way to a dense foamy coating. Mildly sweet with a bit of orangey coriander up front. It's citrusy throughout and only slightly bitter towards the end. There's a yeasty vanilla flavor that fades in as the beer warms, and some other spices I can't point my finger on. Body is moderately light and the mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Imperial Trappist Witbier? Who cares what it is, it's frickin great!"
"Decanted into a tulip, this ale appears cloudy and orange-straw colored. Sticky white head sits atop. Yeasty bready aromas come to the fore, followed slight fruit and some spices. Lots of malt is apparent in the flavor, but the otherwise big mouthfeel is sharpened by crisp carbonation. Biscuity and bready, the large malt bill leads you into spicy hops with herbal notes. Finish is a little acidic and dry, but you are left with creamy malts and bananas lingering about your mouth. As far as I know, Unibroue can do no wrong. Cheers to the boys up north!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a cloudy light peachish yellow color. Nicely fizzy head that allows the beautiful aroma of this beer to escape. Smells of yeasties, bananas, cloves, basically like a belgian hefeweizen. Flavors on this one are spicey and phenolic. Once again, like a belgian hefeweizen, but not like a witbier. A very nice belgian pale ale, one of my favorites. Holy balls is this drinkable. What does 9% abv mean again? Yeah, just awesome."
"Cheers on Canada! Woww what a beer! Great and everlasting head that gets bigger bubbels but was there the whole time I had this wonderfull orange/golden brew in my glas. Nose is very fruity: hops, yeastfruit an probably litle koreander are present, munich and other malts as well as is yeastspice and alcohol. Taste is great also being strong but easy drinkable cause of perfect balance of taste. Malty, fresh, alcoholic, spicy( pepper) and good fitting bitterness make this into a great brew. Good carbonisation makes mouthfeel also perfect. Drinkability is great but maybe too easy for a brew of this strength."
"smell on this is very fruity, i picked up lots of citrus that smells of oranges mostly. i think that it also smells a little like apples. tastes is very smooth and mildly fruity. a nice cool crisp feel on the tongue. very well balanced. very drinkable. i will buy again. a very good choice to share with friends."
"Very good, Belgium style beer. Off white head with good lacing. Smell is clovey, and that same clove smell is found in the glass along with an orangey taste. Color reminds me of a light orange. Mouthfeel if spicy and effervescent. I'd drink this occasionally, but I don't think I'd could have more than one a month. Too many other beers out there."
"Taste: Delicious. Smooth and sweet on the front end, quickly morphing into a spicy pepper character towards the end. This is one to sip on and savor. Strikes a perfect balance between the alcohol content and drinkability factor. The carbonation seems to sneak in the warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is very pleasant. Like I said, this brew is sneaky so watch it. With all that said this is definitely a brew to end the night with. Well worth a try. Cheers."
"Well balanced, tart and sweet. Hints of spices and faint citrus. Mild hops at the end. Smooth mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness at the end from the hops. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is a great beer, and dangerously drinkable."
"Poured a hazy, golden yellow body with a large white, fluffy head, gorgeous lacing clinging to the glass. Spicy aroma, full of fruity notes, yeast and phenols. Taste was tremendously complex. Spicy, peppery, full of sweetness and fruit. Alcohol is nicely hidden. Slight bitterness, slick mouthfeel. Some peach and pears. Wonderful beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: Even with a year on it, the alcohol presence is a bit too strong. I was hoping it would have mellowed some more. But still, go Unibroue. I forgot what a good beer this one was."
"This a a beer to share and experience with others. Others who appreciate great beer, that is. This is deceptive...light and easy to drink...belying it's strength."
"Compares favorably to top runners of the style, nothing wrong with this beer."
"I love the name of this beer. Its about the only French I know but it sure is fun to say!!! Pours a very lovely, hazy golden color. Huge big head on top-wheres my spoon!? Really is beauty in a glass. Yeasty aroma-very earthy. Almost orange like in spots. Spicy fruit. Huge malty sweetness-more from adjunct sugar Im sure. Great phenolic notes. Nice lingering alcohol tinge. Killer body-somewhat syrupy sweet in spots. ""Bright"" on the tongue but not as much as say Duvel. A wonderful brew. Very drinkable. Thank you sir may I have another?"
"Drinkability: Hard to say. Sure, it's a nice light brew, and I can see pairing it with seafood or vegetarian dishes or enjoying a quiet spring evening with a glass. But at $7 a bottle I'm more inclined to pick up a Chimay or Hennepin. Certainly worth a look, particularly if you go for ales with a lighter profile than stouts or even ambers."
"This is an excellent beer from our kanuk friends to the North. Sweet, complex, perfect for summer sipping or as a fireside warmer. Definately one of my new favorites. I can't wait to try it again!"
"Hazy, light color. Many cascading bubbles. Thick head which settles into a nice lace. Sweat, malt aroma with citrus undertones. Alcohol scent is hiding in the background. Extremely light tasting, with a melting warmness from the alcohol which covers the tongue. The alcohol flavor is hidden behind a blend of light malt and citrus. Nothing is overpowering here. Everything is subtle. You might think you are drinking a ""small"" summer beer, as the 9% of this one is so well masked. This one could sneak up on you, if you had the opportunity to have more than a couple."
"I loved this beer."
"Although well put together, this beer tends to become cloying towards the end of a bomber- ultimately reflected in drinkability problems. Still worth a try."
"A revelation for my taste buds. Unbelievable!"
"But this is fancy beer. Drink better, drink less."
"The taste was very refreshing and crisp. These guys seem to be able to brew these styles with the perfect amount of spice character that doesn't leave you feeling like you just drank a glass of potpourri. Very tastefully done and delicious. Apple flavors and a pinch of hoppy dryness add complexity to the spice backbone. Good bite and a nice crisp mouthfeel with a slightly clovey finish left over. Very highly drinkable with a very pleasant flavor. Another solid brew from the Nordiques."
"This is a delicious beer. Very similar to Duvel in all aspects. Though, I think Duvel is slightly better."
"Comments - Pretty to look at, tastes great, likely to help you pick up chicks... What more could you possibly want? Seriously, this is a very good beer. This should be on every beer lovers must-have list."
"Made a nice complement to a steak that I cooked for dinner, but something darker would probably complement it better."
"Unibroue does fine work and this is yet another example of such."
"Drinkability: I'll definitely be buying this again for sure. I could see it becoming a staple for me, at least every once in a while. It's delicious and it's a sipper. I can hardly believe this is 9% ABV."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle, with a best before date of 09-09-07, into a goblet glass. Presented itself with an opaque golden color with a rich head which devolved into persistent lacing. Smelt fresh and spring-like with an effervescent scent. Initially tasted of apples with a slight alcohol aftertaste. As it warmed, I detected an increasingly pleasant taste that reminded me of cola with a hint of sweet citrus. Excellent balance of carbonation and smoothness. Easy to sip and equally easy to return to the cooler for another 750ml bottle. Fine example of this style. Kudos to Unibroue for another outstanding product."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and is highly recommended. Certainly, it is one of the better beers from my home country."
"Pours like a wit with a healthy white head and a cloudy golden body. The aroma hints at yeast and lemon zest. This is the most refreshing beer out there. Rorshack flavor test; orange, lemon zest, yellow cake, white pepper. I somewhat don't believe this beer is 9%. It just seems to disappear from the glass. This is my favorite widely available beer."
"Overall this is one of the best of this style. It's easy to find, so go out and have some!"
"This creamy opaque golden delight mounted a rich white two finger head that slipped down to a milky-like cover that made for a sticky lace. Throughout the length of the beverage there was a continuous feed of bubbles delivered in fizzures of fine streams reaching upward. Ripe apricot-peach, soft citrus, yeast, and a subtle clove and etoh made for a delightful nose. At times there was a lurking metal essence noted. A medium dimension filled the mouth with again, the fruit of the nose, a hay tang, with light floral and gentle spice. This stuff warms the belly. This La Fin Du Monde 12 oz. bottle was with much carbonation, for me it was too sparkling for balance. The finish was sweet with a dry, peppery, bubbly presence. Unfortunately a mucky aftertaste was left at the back of the mouth. I can appreciate the grand reviews this brew receives but for me, for this bottle, it was not there."
"The hidden alcohol gives this one extra points for drinkability."
"Drinkability: An easy to drink beer until the high abv catches up to you."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I would highly recommend to just about anyone. Even non-beer drinkers could appreciate it."
"Tasted: 03/09/05"
"Truly an exceptional beer."
"This fine beer leaves a wonderous full weight on the tongue while remaining light in comparison to the darker belgium styles. I say drink this as much as your beer exploration will allow and don't settle for only a 12 ounce when there is a 750ml available."
"This is an excellent beer and only leaves me wondering why I haven't had this beer before. Highly recommended."
"Gold in color with lots of beautiful cascading and a huge foamy head that clings to the glass. Lots of sediment floating in it as well. Great looking! Aroma is mostly citrus and sweet smelling hops. I also catch some hints of something reminding me of honeysuckle a little. Also, the yeast is apparent as well (unless I'm stupid). This could be a little honey or presence of the alcohol sugars I imagine. Nutmeg and spice up front with hints of sugar and citrus fruit. However, the alcohol kicks you in the palete real REAL hard also. Aftertaste reminds me of papaya fruit a little or a little like orange peel; kind of bitter yet sweet. Carbonation is well balanced and is not too strong on the sip, to which the alcohol burn hits your palete drying it out a bit before the swallow. I honestly wish I had a bomber of this one. Very easy to drink, refreshing, and tasty! Another Unibroue masterpiece!"
"Very Belgian in both taste and smell. It has many elements of a solid belgian blonde but it's stronger, rounder and creamier. Top notch!"
"cloudy yellow ale with a little yeast floating around. Thin white head, no lacing. Sweet aroma with a balanced taste of sweet malt and a little tartness in the finish. The aroma is faint and the taste is similar - not overpowering but a very nice ale, the unibroue's are really impressing me."
"A fine Belgian Strong pale, a pleasure to drink."
"I cannot say enough good things about this beer. If not for the high ABV, I could drink this all night."
"This is a darn good beer. While I would normally drink something maltier and darker on such a bitterly cold night, the higher ABV (while not noticible) of this one warmed me up fine. A very tasty brew indeed, one that I wil definitely be having again."
"""I can't believe it's not Belgian""... that was my first thought upon tasting this gem from Quebec for the first time. Wow, what a beer. Beautiful pouring brew, with rich golden translucent color and massive, thick, Duvel-style head. Smell also first-rate: various spices and fruits accompany a malty base. Taste is just about perfect. I don't feel that I've tried enough beers yet to be able to give one a 5, but this is the closest I've come. Lots of banana flavor - almost sweet, but not sickly sweet...I don't generally care much for sweet beer, but this one just works somehow. Very rich, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, an absolutely outstanding beer. Compared to a couple of the ""real"" Belgians I have tried, I would rank it slightly higher than La Chouffe and slightly below Duvel."
"I could drink this for eternity! Truly a beer worth seeking out!"
"This beer is first off great to look at. The color is a light golden honey color, with a slight bit of cloud in the body. A constant stream of bubbles comes up the middle from the bottom of the glass and the head is thick, white and foamy. The smell is crisp and spicy, with plenty of the typical wheats that you would expect from a Belgian. Various spices and fruity aromas as well as some nice grassy flavors are all underpinned by a subtle hint of alcohol. The taste is great on this beer. It is my first Belgian of any sorts in quite a while, and after drinking it, I remember why I like them so much. The body is full and thick with wheat flavors and some spices, very reminiscent of the Hennepin (as I'm sure they're brewed using essentially the same process). It's all very mellow but the more subtle tastes come through after sitting on the tongue for just a second or two, with flavors of cherry and grape, but nothing to overpower the wheat. There's really not very much hop flavor to this beer, but that would probably ruin the delicate flavors. Dry and heavy yet tiny carbonation. Very drinkable, belies the high alcohol content."
"Notes: Dear God, this is good. It looks as good as any trappist and tastes as good, too. Damn I love this beer, especially when it warms. Oh thank God for Unibroue."
"Pours a deep cloudy golden yellow with a bubbly white head. Aroma was pears, cloves, a citrus fruits, with some caramelly alcohol sneaking in as it warmed. Smells very very good. Taste was a spicy fruitiness up front, With some sugary sweetness in the middle, and a warming, malty finish with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel was very smooth, and you don't notice the high ABV at all. This is considerably better than I remembered it, and I used to really enjoy it. Now, I have found my New Year's drink... :)"
"i've had few brews of this genre but i will most definitely have more after this (or perhaps just more of LFDM). cheers, unibroue!"
"This beer pours a golden color with a huge thick white head that settles down quickly into a manageable size. This beer is highly carbonated like champagne and leaves belgian lace on the side of my glass. Aroma is malty sweet with plenty of fruitty esters and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is fruitty and spicy, clove with a hint of banana. Malt flavor is there in the taste and also a bit of hops to balance the bitterness. I wonder if this beer is spiced or if it is all from the yeast. Nice mouthfeel but a little to carbonated for my liking, however, once the beer breathes for awhile it dies down to a reasonable level. Good drinkability for the style and the abv but definately not a session beer."
"Drinkability is very good on this one. Definitly could be a decent session beer."
"Spicy and fruity to drink. Slightly heavy or syrupy, but not distracting. Sweet overall. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overbearing."
"A fantastic Belgian strong pale ale! The first example I had was in a 750 ml bottle, which was only decent and perhaps not well-handled. The current 12 oz bottles are exceptionally fresh and incomparable beers."
"Whoa! Maybe I've lived in North Carolina too long but I might not ready for a 9% ABV brew. Received this today in a beer of the Month Club and cracked this one first after checking out all these reviews. I have no comparisons in this style or alcohol content yet but I'm in for a treat. Poured a hazy yellow with very nice carbonation. Floral aroma and a real spicy kick to the taste. However, can taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel fantastic. One bottle went to the head . . . impressive. This is a different league for me and I may be ready to step up to the plate."
"After One Year: Head retains a little less after a bit of time, but the lacing stays. Aroma hasn't changed much, still very spicy, fruity and yeasty, but with a bit more of that oily orange peel bitterness. Taste is a little drier, a little yeastier. The flavours are melding into a more glorious whole and losing a bit of their distinctiveness, but that's not a bad thing. I'll come back to this in a another year."
"This beer is fantastic. I wholeheartedly believe that La Fin Du Monde can stand up to any beer in Belgium. I could drink this stuff all night, and on several occasions I have. This hazy masterpiece should be savored, but it's so tasty you can't help but to pound these down. Truly a ray of light on an otherwise cloudy day."
"A decent brew - but probably my least favorite offering to date from Unibroue."
"The color is hazy peack with 2 fingers of head that falls to a quarter inch over the beer. Looks nice. The nose is really strong in fruity esters, a good belgian nose. I dig it. The flavor is good and sweet, with lots of the fruity chatacters coming through. Nice malty characters in this beer. The feel is thick and creamy...nice body on a good beer. Drinkability is good for a 9% beer. It was easy and smooth and just good all around."
" This is truly an all season brew. Summer or winter, this concoction is consistent, delicious and dangerously easy to drink. Oh, Canada! Land of the 3 gallon per flush toilet and home of the Unibroue brewery."
"Poured a beautiful clear gold with a vouminous frothy white head that stuck around for awhile leaving nice belgian lace behind. Aroma is dry with an apple like ester and some clean pale malt with a hint of alcohol. The flavor begins with a a smooth sweet maltiness that is reminscent of a pale bock in that it has a light cereal sweetness. The flavor soon segues into a hoppy flavor that makes itself known but is not bitter or overpowering. The flavor finishes with no heat or any indicator of the high level of alcohol this brew contains which to me makes it a perfect beer to introduce a friend into the pleasure of a belgian style beer. Very beautiful beer though it definetly commands respect as it goes down smoother than a glass of milk."
"Unibroue is one of the most consistent north american breweries around, and La Fin is another perfect example of why they have such a reputation with craft beer fans."
"Drinkability- a great ale which comes in a 4 pack which should be perfect to last me through tonights baseball game. Go sox"
"Drinkability: One of the more drinkable Belgians I've had the privilege to try."
" A most excellent brew."
"Champange like mouthfeel, bubbly but with a creamy quality to the finish."
"I seem to be nearly done with the beer without noticing doing so (and I don't have a drinking problem, I promise!), so I guess it's damn drinkable. My *only* complaint is that I doubt I could have another and not be beset by the pain of (too-)rapid inebriation and overload of powerful flavor."
"Store this beer! I beg you!!!"
"In my review for Maudite, I mentioned that you can definitely notice the 8% abv, but I didn't notice the 9% abv in la Fin Du Monde at all. I'm not sure I'll ever drink a beer I like more than this in my entire life. Smells and tastes relatively sweet, and is a pretty cloudy golden color. Mouthfeel and drinkability are incredible as the alcohol is hidden so well that I could drink this like, forever. Now that I've tried Unibroue I'm gonna save them for nice occasions since I can't live my life spending this much on beer..."
"Drinkability is huge, only restriction is the 9% ABV. Otherwise, I could drink this all day."
"A very good beer. I like most of Unibroue's offerings, but this is a new one for me. Very drinkable, despite being 9% alcohol."
"I love this beer!"
"This poured out a murky golden orange with about a half-inch of white foam sitting atop the body. No lace was left as this was consumed. Aroma was very spicy with notes of a lemony zest and a bit of yeast as well. The taste stays true to the smell with spiciness really dominating with a touch of fruit over a doughy backbone. Lemon and apple notes were the most distinguishable. A nice spicy bitter after taste ending this lovely brew. Mouthfeel was bubbly with about a medium body. Drinkability was good and I would definitely have this again in the future. All around good brew."
"Well I finally got ahold of this guy and am I ever glad that I did. The color is of a typical triple light in color however I had very little head that didn't stick around and no lacing. The smell is that typical lovely belgian smell with sweet smells of citrus and sourness. The taste came as a shock. This beer is as good as everyone says it is. Complex and just all round wonderful fruity and a hint of hops. This is a nice complex beer and a mouthfeel that you don't want to miss especially when you can feel it run across your tounge like a nice cold peice of ice, or something like that. Anyway I glad I only got a 4 pack at 9% I wouldn't be able to last much longer. I am sure these will all be gone soon."
"drinkability: Very high! this is one of my favorite beers! but, I can't drink them everyday, as they are high in abv, not a session brew! but great for a little something special once in awhile. Great Stuff!!!"
"This is no doubt a good beer. It pours almost a dissapointingly pale yellow, with a nice head lace that remains fairly well. The smell is spicy with hints of fruit. The taste is indeed strong and over the top, as advertised. The alcohol comes through strongly, as expected. The clove spicincess of the yeast leads into the bitterness of the hops. I am not sure if I am missing something here, but to me, this is a good, but not neccassirily world-class beer."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with a small white head that sticks around. The aroma has a fruity and citrus-like feel. The flavor is yeasty and malty and has some fruit character. The alcohol is also apparent in the taste. Great carbonation. Very good for the tripel style - great representation. I'll have this one again and again."
"Overall this is a great brew. A very good representation of the Triple style. This is definitely one of my favorite belgian style ales."
"I am in love with this beer."
"Pours a deep golden yellow, with a smaller fizzy white head. Small bubbles continuously run up the side of my glass giving the beer a nice ring of lacing. The aroma is a wonderfully sweet malty smell, some citrus and many floral accents. The taste is a very sweet, malty flavour, much like the nose, great belgian taste, can taste the alcohol, but it is hidden pretty well under the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, but very carbonated. My mouth is tingling from the effervescence and alcohol. This beer is wonderful and i feel i could drink this forever"
"Had I not read a review for this beer, I would have never picked it up for the goofy label. Quite decent though. Citrus and bannana aroma. Tasted almost like a hefe at first. Clove and floral hops came next. Short lived head and carbonation. By the time I finnished the 750ml bottle, the taste was a bit too lingering. Perhaps it got a bit too much air. Good value for a belgian strong ale though."
"Overall Impression: This is a personal favorite and I saved it to put a splash into my mug for my 250th karma point. This beer turned me on to Belgian styles, and made me a HUGE fan of Unibroue in general. The yeast ties it to its cousins Trois Pistoles and Don de Dieu, but La Fin is drier, and cleaner. This is a great special occasion beer. Ive tried to turn a few people on to great beer with this one, but its a bit heavy and strong for most of the macro drinking crowd. Personally, this rocked my world at first taste. While this isnt a perfect 5 beer, its darn close. Drinkability in the short term is hampered by the heavy handed 9% abv. but I tend to buy this stuff by the case. I cant recommend this strongly enough to my fellow BAs that may not have tried this. Its a MUST TASTE beer."
"Poured a frothy, three-finger head atop a golden orange, slightly cloudy brew into a tulip. It looked so refreshing. The aroma was spicy, cidery and fruity... the immediate tangible smell was sour green apples. If I took a big enough inhale, I could feel the alcohol in my nose. Tastewise, it was tangy, sweet, and sour, once again with a focus on an apple-like flavor, with a nice warmth from the high ABV. It sometimes reminded me of reisling and/or champagne - maybe a white grape twang in there too. For all the apparent sweet tastes, each taste ended up surprisingly dry. Drinking it reminded me of Duvel sometimes and Orval other times... strange. The mouthfeel of this beer was wonderful - effervescent and smooth. Obvioulsy, like other beers with high ABVs, as it warmed and was consumed, the alcohol became more and more apparent."
"All in all, a very solid brew."
"Drinkability: Very tasty, with a distinct yeasty character; well made - as good a tripel as you will find"
"What a great beer! La Fin Du Monde is dangerously drinkable and must be accorded the respect a 9% ABV beer is due. It went great with my dinner and to relax with as I settled into the evening. Definitely worth picking up."
"750 mL brown bottle topped with cork, bottled on March 11, 2004 (code C114)."
"Taste: Honey-sweet at first, with alcohol rushing in and slightly numbing the tongue. Very warming, and quickly causes facial flush. Slightly cloying at times until the swallow, after which the taste is dry and very nearly wine-like. Phenolic is really the dominant taste here, with powdered sugar-like dextrins floating around as well."
"Pours a hazy, glowing gold color. Moderate silky white head. Smells fruity and crisp. This beer is excellent! Heavy and hard hitting, this beer has a powerful spicy taste and a malty punch. Slight hops combine with the sharp, alcoholic aftertaste. Extremely smooth and drinkable. An outstanding brew, and a great conversion brew as well."
"An excellent ale. Do try this one."
"Notes: one of the best beers ever. a must try for everyone."
"I will probably try this one again when I see it, to see if that bacon flavor was an anomaly... even if it wasn't. it was still worth havin again."
"Received this corked 750ml bottle as a gift. It had been sitting on top of a fridge for over a year. Exp. date put it good till 9/6/2005. I thought about keeping it awhile longer, but couldn't resist. Uncorked it, and carbonation slowly fizzed to the top. May have chilled it a bit too much. When it began to drip over, I poured. It had a nice frothy head that lasted throughtout the glass. Slightly toned down toward the end. Bubbles also lasted throughout, like a good champagne. The color was cloudy gold. Smells were very fruity, and maybe a touch floral. It tasted like apples, pears, and malt. Not bitter at all. As it warmed, it did take on an alcohol taste. Still nothing like I would have expected for 9% abv. Seemed almost rich in mouthfeel. Like a watered down milkshake consistency. As for drinkability, I found that it was gone too soon!!! Quick note on back of bottle, it was quite clear what type of glass it should be drank from. Showed correct picture, then a big X through incorrect one. I got a kick out of that."
"It pours to a generous white foam and cloudy gold color. Smell is floral, candylike and unbeerlike but good...smells like it has some good vitamins in it--real nutritious! Flavor is sweet and tangy and fruity with a weird after taste for which you have to acquire an appreciation. It's not awful, just different. Finishes fruity. Hops are detectable. This beer is exceptionally easy to drink so watch out for the buzz. It's like a ""hefe"" on steroids. A unique and unforgettable taste sensation."
"I just put a few imperial stouts in the basement for my first try at cellaring. I'll be adding one of these babies in the mix to see just how complex it can get. With the carbonation and alcohol, I'm hoping it will be even more tasty next year."
"Overall: I consider this beer to be the greatest beer made on the continent of North America, and the best beer by the Quebec based Unibroue. This is a phenomenal Belgian-style ale, but also very artisinal and unique for its style. There are simply no other beers in the world like this one. This is a must-try brew!"
"Pours a thick yellow amber color with a beautiful white head. Smells very yeasty and hoppy. I love the carbonation with the yeast floating in it. Very good looking beer. Tastes nice. A wonderful balance of hops and flavor. I expected this to be another ""in your face"" Belgian and that is not the case. This is very easy drinking. A lovely pale ale to be savored. Very flavorful without being overpowering. Besides being cost prohibitive, I would drink this more often."
"Drinkability: Also, very good. Drinks somewhat lightly, especially once one realizes it's high ABV of 9%. This beer is easily drank and tasty enough to captivate an interest throughout multiple bottles. My favorite beer from Unibroue that has made my list."
"After having read about this beer on BA for some time now, I finally got a chance to try it this past weekend, and I think I have a new candidate for favorite beer. OK, let's say in the top 10. Not because it is as complex as some others I've had, but because the balance is just right on, and I felt like I could drink it and keep drinking it (I'm glad I didn't- that 9% ABV would have done some damage)."
"Hints of medicine, but in a good way. This is some tasty stuff. Crisp and delightful with some metal qualitites. Very fresh tasting."
"I put it right up there with the closer to home New Belgium Trippel."
"Drinkability - I want more."
"taste was decent but It had an almost Malt Liquor quality about it, as if it was blended, strange. I experienced the same thing with the 11 offering as well. I did not have this with the darker beers such as Trois or Terrible. Again its a decent beer but not overly impressive for a so called Belgian Strong Pale."
"Caged and corked 750 ml bottle with very cool graphics, a best before date and even a suggested serving glass (tulip), which is exactly what I used. The cork comes off with a very nice resounding ""thump", which foreshadows that this is not an ordinary beer. A moderately heavy pour reveals an appearance that is not too out of the ordinary, it's a apricot/darkish yellow, but there is a good sized head and some short-lived lacing. The taste is where this beer really shines. It's at once smooth and creamy, with some orange and tangerine tastes in there, but it also has some zest and fizziness. It also has a great smell, and reminds me of a lighter version of a Chimay or a Duvel. I really liked this beer, and it was reasonably priced (6.00 for a 750 ml)."
"Serving a 12 0z bottle. Expiration date 2 years from now-gotta love that. This bottle poured a beautiful hazy golden yellow color. A very small head was all that formed, but this was not a major let down. Smell was wonderful: fruity and with hints of pleasant alcoho undertones. Taste was fruity sweetness. Finish is very crisp. The high ABV is there but hidden well. This is a highly drinkable beer. Enjoy!."
"Now this is more like it! Large bottle, corked and caged. Poured straw/golden and semi cloudy, white tiny bubble head and leaving lace.. Still not getting much of a nose, just a bit of wheat, bubble gum and yeast. Tastes/notes of wheat, yeast, bubblegummy phenolics, fruit, candy sugar, apricots, rum soaked grapes, yum yum. Finish is sweat and smooth. Crisp and nicely turned out Canadian Belgian."
"With a violent pop the cork came out, and out poured some liquid gold. The beer itself is thick, although pale looking, and pleasantly sedimentary and unclear, becoming more so with each glass from the 750 ml. Apple juice colouration, dull orange or yellow; I have seen better and more unique appearances in other Unibroue beers. It is still attractive, nonetheless. The head is near uncontrollable, gargantuan, soapy, bright aspirin-white, with good longevity. Soapy lace, large bubbles. The aroma is earthy yeast, citrus, coriander, apples, peaches, and actually reminded me of Hoegaarden, with more complexity. Belgian taste, slightly metallic, strong yeast, citrus, champagne-like, sweet on the front and surprisingly bitter on the finish, leaving a dry, port or sherry aftertaste. Strong spices, almost peppery, but with good enough maltiness and hop-level, leaving a clove-numbness on the palate. Mouthfeel is h-e-a-v-y. This has a very gassy carbonation, and is quite dry, leaving a feel similar to scotch or whisky in the mouth, which would prevent me from consuming these overly often, but this said, it is quite drinkable for such a highly flavourable and strong beer. Conclusion: for me personally, not my favourite from Unibroue, but compared to other breweries, this is still an absolute dream to consume. This Unibroue beer only tastes less-than-extraordinary when compared to its own line of products. Still a spectacular beer from Quebec. I have yet to taste the equal of Unibroue in North America."
"Drinkability: unfortunately just to overbearingly sweet for me, but I'm a crisp clean lager guy, I rate it above average for it's unique flavor and complexity"
"The end of the world is a golden orange sunset, adorned with an elegant  though dissipating lace. Theres no explosions, just a subtle fire to spicy a mellow, alcohol laden brew. The banana and clove aroma is soothing while the flavors are simple, delicate, and diverse. Hints of pineapple in the hops were most surprising while the majority of the notes were standard fruits and spices. This is an average interpretation of an awesome style. Though light on body, this brew was quite drinkable. Cest la fin du la monde, et je me sens bien."
"I used the glass I had available. Not a snifter. I used a Pint glass. Nice clean dark yellow color not much head. The aroma was spicey with a light fruitiness. the taste was at first sweet then a strong spicey, peppery middle with a kind of light malt sweetness on the finish. I probably would have gotten more aroma from the proper glass. Very tasty with a consistant prickly carbonation throughout."
"Quite appropriately this is sharp and spicy at various points. I get note of hay, bergamot, hint of pepper, lemon, an herbal bite, and some vanilla. Overall it definitely has some interesting soft citrus notes as well as some appetizing acidity. This is an awesome brew from a currently great brewery, lets hope it stays that way."
"notes: Not near as much yeast and fruit flavor as I was expecting from this beer. Nice with alot of flavors that need to thought about to really pick out of the beer. Good, but probably not my favorite style of beer to begin with."
"Bottle: Poured a golden beer with a huge bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is a mix between something sweet which might be candi sugar and wheat. Taste is very refreshing with again a nice mix of candi sugar, wheat and something a bit spicier, which I cannot identify. Body if medium with great carbonation. I truly love this beer even after more then ten years of drinking it. Must be commanded just for helping discovered the fabulous world of beer."
"Allagash take note, this is how it should be done."
"It felt like I had to wait until ""la fin du monde"" (end of the world) for the head to subside. Poured very cloudy for a Belgian Ale, but I was quickly taken by the plethora of hops that were readily apparent. Unfortunately having a minor head cold did not help the cause. The triple fermentation seemed to reduce any hard after tastes that are usual for high ABV ales. Overall; quite impressed. Unibroue has done ""la Belle Province"" proud."
"This is a very nice take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but is not quite in the same class as the great Duvel. I do hope the new owners of Unibroue leave this one alone."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thick white head. Rising from the frothiness of the head is a beautiful fruity aroma of bitter green aplles and pears. A slight hint of floral as well. The taste was very fruity with apples, pears, and the slightest hint of lime. There was also a strong bready taste, which I have never beed fond of. Too yeasty in my book."
"Pours golden yellow with a huge, hard to control pure white head - be careful on this pour. Head diminishes to 1/4 inch, where it resides until the bottom of the glass. Subtle lacing. Aromas of white grape, wine alcohol and freshly chopped wood shine through. Initial feel is intense carbonation - very fizzy and active on the tongue. First taste yields sharp grapefruit tartness with other miscellaneous fruity tones coming on strong. Sadly, this burst of flavor doesn't stick around long and abruptly gives way to an oaky and warm alcohol aftertaste. I found the flavor to be somewhat lacking in complexity compared to others I've had from Unibroue. The alcohol here is physically present (1/2 glass is enough to feel it) but hardly noticeable in the taste. This beer was good - I would have it again, but I was a bit let down by comparison."
"The glass rapidly fills with a big white head. The beer is golden, pale enough. It smells fruits, malt and spices. In mouth, the alcohol is on the frontline, more than for the Fringante who proposed 10% ABV. Lemon, coriander and other sweet components stick to this alcohol and malt and leave a warming astringent feeling."
"This is a damn tasty beer, it would go great with food or just sitting around with friends talking about beer. I hope to happen across this beer again, and soon."
"uni(brou)que brew."
"Ah! The end of the world is coming! Yup, it's sitting in my Corsendonk tulip glass and I love it. Poured out a dark pale yellow with a huge head that settled down quickly. Smell consisted of mostly citrius notes mixed in with some malts. A whiff of alochol is there too but not that much. Taste was great. Some sweeten malts mixed in with some spiciness and exotic fruits and/or pears. Smooth and creamy going down as well. Another terrific brew from Unibroue which is gaining quite a bit of respect from me lately."
"I've had other similar ales recently that let me down. La Fin Du Monde is exactly what they wish they were. This is strong yet balanced, and it is very good overall."
"Another good brew from Unibroue."
"Pale and clear big foamy head, but very little lacing. Smells real good, and the taste backs it up. Amazing flavor. I think this is a great beer. Better than the sum of its parts. Like everything from Unibroue its a tasty beer. Definitely will buy this on a regular basis."
"Very nice packaging is the best I can say about this brew. Having read the other reviews I had to check the bottle again to be sure we are talking about the same thing. Aroma was pleasant although not very pronounced. Carbonation was disconcerting and left the tongue tingling. Perhaps I just don't like this style but it appeared to be someones kid sister's attempt at making champagne in her Easy-Bake oven."
"Very drinkable brew, I could drink this all day."
"Not something I'll go out of my way to get again. There are better Belgian strong pale ales in my opinion (Delirium Tremens comes immediately to mind). Still not too bad, though. Glad I gave it a shot."
"Pours a beautiful golden hue with a nice foamy white head, which to my disapointment, didn't stick around too long. I believe this beer tastes like a clean duvel, faint notes of spice and hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Drinkability is great for a beer of this alcohol content (9.0). Unibroue makes some fine fine beers and this is one of my favorites. I think that this beer would make a great introduction to Belgian Pales."
"Pours a hazy golden sunrise color with a tremendous towering white head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a rocky lace and spider webs across the glass. Nose is lots of fruity esters with notes of banana, clove, bubblegum, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Fairly full in body with a very fine champagne-like carbonation that is oh so smooth. Taste begins with a good deal of fruitiness (nectarine, pear, peach, mango, and white grape) and flowery honey blended with peppery clove. Next comes some powdery yeasts and a bit of bready malt followed by a touch of drying alcohol (which, considering the 9% ABV, is very well hidden indeed). The End of the Worldthe flagship beer from one of the worlds finest breweries, and one of my all-time favorites. Simply delicious."
"A great beer. Tastes really good and goes down really smooth."
"Poured into a tulip goblet, beer poured a straw yellow with a nice fluffy head. Scents of fruit, belgian yeast and alcohol present. First sip, hints of apple, pear, and hops. Finish hides its 9% ABV well. This one had mellowed for about 6 months since I had bought it. Might try another for significantly longer. I should add that I am normally not a big fan of tripels, but this one pleased me greatly. A very smooth, drinkable beer despite its high ABV."
"The taste is outstanding. A blend of pear, hops and alcohol that don't overpower each other, but rather fit smoothly into one another."
"A fine product by Unibroue out of Quebec with 9% abv. Farily accessable here in Massachusetts and well worth the approximately $8.00 per bomber that it sells for."
"Best by date of 3/18/05. Poured a fizzy bubbly pale golden color. White head formed, but sank quickly. Smell was spicy, bready, yeast-dominant. Sweet scents slowly drifted upwards, along with a cidery fruitiness. Taste is unbelieveable. Peppery tartness, hint of alcohol, fades into a spicy dry finish. Mouthfeel is warm and smooth, not so much piqueing the interest of any particular sensation as much as massaging them all at once. This is one helluva beer, just wish the head lasted longer than 20 seconds."
"Pours with a firmly-retained head of foamy, small, pure white bubbles that clumps slightly and slides easily back into the glass after a swirl. Beer is a color like translucent (but not truly hazy) goldenrod with straw-gold highlights. Turbulent, racing carbonation sends a few yeasties into convection currents along the sides of the goblet. Almost all of the aromatic nuances seem to belong to the light, sweet, estery yeast. A consistent clove/coriander spiciness is, with warmth, joined by vodka-soaked bananas in a slightly bready nosefeel that finishes dry. Juicy and softly malty up front on the palate; sustained by a spicy tartness moving from clove to ginger (particularly in the aftertaste) and a finish of slightly grassy hops. At room temperature, flavors of banana bread crusts, lemon pith, and powdered sugar emerge. Spiky mouthfeel with an alcoholic warmth and a pearish mealiness; mellow dry spiciness in the finish. Although I love this beer, I prefer less breadiness and more effervescence in a Belgian Strong Pale. Perhaps this is why IMHO this beer is the perfect accompaniment to scrambled eggs or quiche."
"Popping the top you get a whiff of green apples and a puff of gunsmoke. Pouring this incredable beer results in a slightly hazy body crowned by a creamy mound of white foam. Sweet and fruity with apples and pairs in the begining a perfectly balanced bitterness give a dry, spicy finish. With a moderatly full mouthfeel, crisp carbonation, and peppery finish this beer even feels good to drink. At 9% this beer is no joke, but it hides it so well."
"Notes: I picked up a bunk 750ml once but haven't had any carbonation problems with the 12oz. bottles."
"This is a great beer. Some people I have talked to have said that it is way to sweet, but imo it's a great belgian style ale."
"I haven't tried many Belgians (or Belgian beers produced by Canadian companies and exported to France, as it were), but this is the best of the bunch so far. Reminds me of a more complex, better balanced version of Chimay Blue. I enjoyed it in France and I'll be buying more once I'm back in the US."
"Cloudy yellow color with a head that stays for a while, and leaves a lacing. Smells fruity, with some spice as well. The fruit seems like an apple smell. The taste is like the smell, some apple there, as well as a caramel flavor. This is well complemented by a sharp cheese. The mouthfeel is excellent, just the right amount of carbonation. Despite being 9% La Fin Du Monde is easy to drink, and I am usually not satisfied with only one. This is one of my favorite beers."
"Pours a beautiful golden cloudy color with a thick head that gives way to a thin head that lasts throughout the pour. The scent is alcoholic with a marked fruit aroma. The taste is liek a drier tripel. Subtle grassy notes, light sweetness with a crisp and slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, very carbonated but appropriate for the brew. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, as though it has very little residual sugars, but I love how it nips at the front part of my tongue and leaves it slightly sour. Love this stuff."
"Really one of my favorite Trippels out there. Very nice head, appropriate carbonation for the style, also appropriate light color. What I particularly like about this trippel is that it is nice and fruity. Something like Westmalle is a little dry and plain for me. La Fin du Monde is just a little sweet and fruity...really tasty."
"I think I've said enough for someone who has very little in the way of insight to share."
"Pours a bueatiful hazy golden color with nice white cap of ever rising bubbles. Smells good light fruity apples, bananas, oranges and spice. Tastes so smooth malty sweet fruity, zesty just the right amount carbonaton tantilizes the tounge. This beer is scary drinkable at 9%, never know by consuming one. Very good beer complex flavors that blend to one great brew from Unibroue, these guys rock."
"Presented in a 750ml bottle with a wire cage-wrapped champagne cork. Pours a cloudy golden-orange with a beautiful white, frothy head. Carbonation is right on, too - smallish bubbles just keep on coming, even after letting it sit a while. Wonderful nose of Belgian yeast, orange peel, herbal spice, and a whiff of alcohol. Even better on the palate - more orange peel, lemon, yeast, confectioner's sugar, hint of coriander. Frothy mouthfeel. Finishes mild, sweet, and dry. A beautiful beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Another great beer from Unibroue that I would be happy to drink over and over and over."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"This has been one of my favorites for a while, but the last time I cracked open a bottle, it was flat. An email to Unibroue got the answer that they were having cork problems, and that their distributors would replace defective bottles. When I mentioned this at my local beer store, they gave me a new bottle, gratis!"
"A very enjoyable beer."
"Pours out a cloudy orange-yellow with a nice fluffy head that's fairly well retained. Smell is malty and sweet with some spice and banana. Taste is exquisite, with peach overtones at first going into malt and clove-like spiciness with some banana essence amidst that lovely alcohol backbone. Another absolute winner from Unibroue. Vive la Quebec!!"
"High ABV is why I'm scoring taste and drinkability with a 4.5."
"The color is a golden-honey with white spongy-looking head that bubbles. It smells yeasty with a hint of cloves. It tastes spicy and it has an orange peel flavor. There is more carbonation than your standard beer, but it is very light and easy to swallow for a highly carbonated beer. Aftertaste leaves an alcohol flavor in your mouth. This beer is very good in my book. It goes down easy."
"The smell is classic Belgian strong pale ale. I am overwhelmed at first taste: there is so much going on here it is hard to pick out individual flavors. Very much like a smoother-on-the-palate Duvel. A beautiful blend of sugar, alcohol, grain, and effervescence. I'll have this one again."
"To date the best in the lot of the Beers of the World gift pack received for Christmas. This golden brew poured a generous fluffy white head that is lacing nicely down the side of my pint. Initially this had a bread like smell that was soon taken over by the spices and fruits that are in this beer. My first taste (not to mention the subsequent sips) was heavenly, an awesome piece of brewing that blends together a highly carbonated combination of malts, hops, fruits, and spices. The mouthfeel is wonderfully full. This beer is one I will seek out in the near future!"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass, with an everlasting medium-sized fizzy white head forming, which left behind thick lacing when the glass was tilted. The beer was a pale golden color, and cloudy, with a snowstorm of particulates swirling around driven by large fiz bubbles. After a few minutes, the fizzy head became much finer in texture, and remained voluminous. The nose was lovely, with juicy nectarine, dry yeast, coriander, subtler citrus aromatics and the slightest hint of alcohol. The taste was assertive and delicious, wtih a somewhat tart dry malt backbone, and an up-front sensation of coriander. This was followed by ample flavors of bitter orange , leading into lemony citrus, finishing dry with an appropriate bitterenss, lingering coriander, and refreshing zippy citrus. All flavors were balanced masterfully. The beer had a very satisfying body, with a good level of carbonation. This was a highly enojyable beer that I will certainly buy again. Unibroue knows how to whip-up a good Belgian."
"Nice stuff."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"Nothing about this beer is less than interesting, and everything is well more than just enjoyable. This beer, you savor. The flavor relegates the malt to second status, but it still manages to assert itself enough to joyfully balance the menagerie of buoyant tasty waves born elsewhere. The muscular but subtle high ABV serves to enchant, making it pleasantly subversive. It's a wonderful taste of Belgium via Canada, a most fortuitous and satisfying route of delivery. Keep this one coming."
"cloudy gold with a medium white head. smell bready, with a banana-y fruity smell, with a hint of cloves behind that i pick up a little lemon too. the taste is pleasntly bready with a slightly citrusy bite (grapefruit..?) the cloves are also apparent here too. there are some hops in there but they are too subdued by the malt and yeast to pick out flavors. good thicker medium body. not the best unibroue, but definitely very good."
"750ml bottle sealed with a cork."
"This is a beautiful milky orange beer with lots of head initially and lots of carbonation. The taste is very spicy, yeasty, and fruity. No evident hop aroma or taste. It is definitely one to drink slowly due to the carbonation and alcohol content. As the beer warms the flavor slowly changes as some flavors come to the forefront and others fade away. Very enjoyable!"
"Overall: A very good beer, and one I would definitely recommend to a good friend."
"Oh hell yes. Wife got me a 3-pack of Unibroue in a wooden case for Xmas. Fin du Monde was my first choice. Kind of a fruity Belgian, with gorgeous fragrance, beautiful sweetness with a good dose of yeastiness and malt. Just fantastic. Nice small bubbles after the initial froth subsides. Kind of a mediocre hazy yellow with no real head, but I don't really care too much about appearance so long as the beer is good, and this stuff is wonderful."
"Tried this for the first time recently and with every sip said to myself, ""Damn this is good!"". Pours a beautiful yellowish color with a nice head that lasts quite a while. Amazingly smooth for such a high alcohol content. Will definitely drink this often."
"Rest assured I will give this another non-inebriated review later on. But I do think my review is acceptable at the moment."
"Pours a pale golden color with a very large well-retained head. Lots of light fruit flavors. Some apricot and even a bit of pineapple. Some peppery notes as well. There is a slight warming alcohol sensation that lets you know this is a strong beer. Still very drinkable though."
"Wonderful stuff. Pours the beautiful hazy yellow with a sweet almost banana aroma. Pils malts and saaz hops marry with a fruity flavor. The alcohol is well hidden and you could get yourself in seroiously trouble with the drinkability of this. A classic in the making."
"Drinkability: Delicious... alcohol level is surprisingly treacherous."
"Pale peachy hue with honey highlights, hazy, some animation is noticeable, the white head was smaller than I expected; maybe a finger in height and the retention was passable. A loose cap remains throughout the consumption. The lacing is sub-par. The nose is fruity: mangos, passion fruit, and kiwi. Pepper and clove undercurrents. Alcohol hints at the back. The mustiness is noticeable throughout. The potency is modest. I was expecting more but what the nose needed the palate had and then some. The taste was splendid; simply divine with a glimpse of mango and pear fruitiness upfront that is very quickly overwhelmed by spicy alcohol, pepper, cloves, and surprisingly strong yeastiness. Some candied sugar sweetness but it cannot overcome the finish, which is tart (a green apple influence), spicy and peppery as well but with a blend of malty-bread too. The alcohol is very naked and taunting, maybe a little too much so, if it was softer the complexities would not be as drowned out. The palate is very tasty nevertheless. I detect cloves and apples in the aftertaste with a sharp peppery kick on the tongue, interesting! The body is medium with high carbonation, appropriate, very cleansing and refreshing, which is hard to do with such a high abv. Nicely dry as well. La Fin Du Mode is supremely drinkable and quite a pleasant quaff. It has been well worth the wait I scored a 750 ml of this dandy in Kansas City. Obliviously it is recommended but I might be the last person on earth to try it."
"A beautiful cloudy golden color with a large and fluffy near white head - plenty of lacing. The nose is vinous with plenty of spice and fruit notes. The flavor follows suit with nice vinous qualities and plenty of fritzy feel to go with it; almost joyous in its qualities. The feel is good and the drinkability is limited only by the unnoticed alcohol level."
"After warming to room temperature, you can taste some of the strong alcohol and the carbonation.Cloves detract. Popular with my friends but merely good. Have had every few months and observe that its not comparable to the best Belgiums, merely to the median good ones."
"Pours a nice honey color with a 1/4 inch with very intricate lace on the side and great carbonation. Lot of sediment in the bottle. Aroma produces sour apple, toffee, wheat and yeasty citrus notes. Mouthfeel is very clean and has that nice alcohol kick on the back end. Taste is a beautiful mixture of malts with some slight spiciness on the backside. My first experience with the Unibroue folks and certainly won't be my last."
"Not as complicated as other Unibroue brews, my least favorite from that brewery so far. Thats not saying much as it's still an outstanding beer."
"Poured a clear, light amber/gold that constructed a respectable off-white head that retained well. Aromas of sweet malt, wheat, and spices. Light in the taste with a fair presence of spices and citrus. Alcohol presence seems low for beer with this much abv. Smooth and refreshing with an edgy carbonation. I prefer the Maudite, but this is a great beer nonetheless."
"12 ounce bottle served chilled into a goblet. Murky honey colour with a tightly laced 2 cm head. Nose is very floral of apricots and apples, but citrus dominates. Clean and crisp in the mouth with plenty of carbonation to fizzle your tongue. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Caramel malt taste becomes evident halfway through the experience, and the hops appear about the same time to balance the predominant fruitiness. Excellent drinkability here, and really no faults. Fortunately, several Unibroue offerings are available at the Liquor Barn stores in Lexington, Ky, so I'm just a 2.5 hour drive away from sampling more of these fine Unibroue products. Trois Pistoles remains my favorite, but this one is an excellent choice as well."
"This is a gorgeous beer. A perfect sipping brew for a cold winter's evening."
"The real champagne of beers? Oustanding appearance...super carbonation..a head that won't quit with an opaque yellow appearance. Smell was like wheat with a hint of alcohol...well-rounded and inviting. Taste was slghtly citrus with a definite alcohol presence. Mouthfeel was definitely dry, but rounded out nicely...not a strong alcohol presence in teh aftertaste. I've just recently started sampling some of the stronger ales and this certainly ranks in my top tier."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle. Poured initally a translucent pale golden color, following with a definitive murkyness from the natural yeast sediment. This yeast sediment, like other Belgians and Belgian-styles, attributes significant flavor profiles that would not be present if either the beer was to be filtered in the brewing process or not decanted into the goblet as to freely distribute the sediment. I believe this beer is more enjoyable with the yeast thoroughly mixed with the beer. It is rather spicy in the nose (Unibroue tends to use many different spices and keeps those recipe formulas under wraps; I know this from talking to one of the brewers at a beer festival I was working at), with evidence of a healthy dosage of candi sugar and some subtle hops (most likely indigenous to North America). Initially sweet and the intricate smorgasboard of spices come through. Finishes drier yet the spice aspect of the beer still lingers. Mouthfeel's heavy yet smooth, not as invasive as one might expect for a Belgian-style at around 9%. Recommended."
"A nice sipper of a stong ale."
"John"
"IMHO: A good representation of the style, but a Duvel beats it on many fronts."
"The beer pours hazy golden with a white head that has real staying power. The lace also has staying power. Its a real pretty beer, even my wife liked the look of it. It had a fresh, fruity aroma with a malty undertone that became the dominant flavor. I can't imagine anything that tastes better from first taste to last. I have had equal quality beers but I don't know that I've had better. It explodes with flavor in the mouth and has that pale ale dryness to it, but this is much more than a pale ale. It is an eminently drinkable beer from an excellent brewery. They make Trois Pistloes that comes close to this, but after numerous taste tests to try to determine which is better, this is the one."
"Tastes fruity with a nice warming alcholic kick. A little spicy on the finish. Hops not noticeable. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth once the carbonation dies down. Very drinkable. Not the best belgian, but not bad for a Canadian-Belgian. Cheers."
"Bottle purchased from Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a cloudy gold color, with a big white head. The aroma is a blend of spices, citrus fruit, and bready yeast. The taste is a delightful blend of fruitiness and champagne like flavors, with a spiciness that balanced well with the lighter aspects of the beer. The high level of alcohol is detected at the end of the sip, betrayed by its warming. I can't really recomend this as a session beer, unless you find the idea of the local authorities pulling you out of the sewer in a comatose condition appealing to you. That, and the beer is surprisingly heavy for its appearance and taste. Still, it is a magnificent beer. Tis is just more proof that a trip to Quebec is in order."
"Poured a cloudy palamino with a white mane that left a very thin cover all they way down - heavier at the edge. Light lacing. The nose is of wonderful malts that jump right up at you and you can smell the sweetness before you even taste the end of the world. You can, at times taste the alcohol - but in a refreshing way not a let's-get-buzzed way. Nice mouthfeel. A bit of a surprise 'cause you expect some heaviness after all the nose and initial contact. But no. It is almost like a cream ale - almost. I goes down smooth with more surprises. A sense of sweet hops, and freshly picked apples in the aftertaste - almost like crab apples. I don't normally, like a fruity taste but I do here! A wonderful beer. End of the world, huh? Must be one of the beers of heaven."
"This beer poured majestically with a great looking head that retained almost the whole way down the glass. It smelled like something similar to a Hoegaarden white and tasted very much like one at first. The taste soon gave way to alcohol as the beer started kicking my ass. This brew can really put some hair on your chest (ladies beware). After finishing two thirds of the glass, the alcohol taste dissipated, but it still had the aftertaste of a white beer. Maybe my view is askew because I haven't had too many beers of this style, but I just don't like it."
"I like this as a drinkable heavy beer. Not as filling as La Maudite or trois pistoles. Bravo Unibroue...another great beer!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It has a nice present itself quality. The only pinch is with the alcohol when swallowing the ale. It leaves a great warming quality. It is fresh on the palate and is a great sipping ale. This one will take some time. I am glad I waited to try this ale. It was worth the wait."
"One of my first dips in to the big bottles. Pours a goregous gold with crisp white head. There is slight carbonation bubbling up the sides. The aroma had apples, bannanas, and yeast qualties. The taste brought along the yeast and fruity bite. Absolutly silky mouthfeel is a very nice touch to this one."
"Light gold color. Small head. Aroma is yeasty, fruity and citrusy. A medium bodied Belgian tripel. Fruity, bright, yeasty and spicy, all the things an Abbey Triple should be. Complex flavors are intermingling here. Apples, oranges and peaches mix with coriander, cloves and allspice (?) to make a very pleasant tasting beer. Add its extremely fine champagne like carbonation and this beer is a real winner. Very smooth. The 9% alcohol is hidden fairly well. It does peak out occasionally, as every once in a while there is a touch of alcohol bite and it is a real belly warmer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"This beer is a hazy yellow color with a medium thick white head. Not very much head retention, and thin lacing. Aroma is yeasty and spicy. Rather light-bodied and bubbly, with flavors of spice, hops, citrus and vanilla. The finish is light and crisp with a hint of alcohol. This is a pretty good Tripel."
"What in interesting little brew we have here. Lovely cloudy golden color. Look sort of like a good hefe, only without as much stuff floating in it. The smell is something unique, a sort of stong normal pale ale smell, with odd pungancies and astringencies behind it. The taste is somewhere between pale ale and fruit punch. Complicated, and interesting. A good reccomendation."
"What an intimidating beer. In fact, I have to admit that most Unibroue brews are intimidating (even ephemere). But mama likes. Scrounged up this bottle at the Utah State Liquor store in Park City--definitely the best beer selection in Utah. This fine offering poured a very hazy, tawny/orange, with a voluptuous white head. The Unibroue yeast is obvious in the smell, along with sweet banana bread, and slightly medicinal alcohol. Taste is wow. Sweet candy malts, with notes of pears, and plenty of yeasty goodness. Wheat-bitter finish. Very warming. I wish I had a 750 though..."
"750ml bottle pours a cloudy burnt yellow, foamy white head. Endless tiny cabonation bubbles rise from the depths. Aroma is strong and quite sweet, fruit and candy. OK mouthful with high carbonation, slightly too much for me. Taste is sweet fruity goodness with some nice toasty malt and whisky-like sourness in the finish. Yes, we have bananas. Sticky, dry puckering sensation lasts. A bit too much lasting sourness on the front of the tongue."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Super smooth. Medium...almost high levels of carbonation. Very easy on the palate. Drinkability is way up there. Such a complex flavor profile as it crosses the palate. Wonderful in every aspect. Another winner from Unibroue."
"Extremely light hazy color with a centimeters worth of head. Beutifully colored and a lot lighter than I expected. Good aroma but has an alomost rubbery smell which appears in the taste but not in a bad way. Aroma is light and wheaty. The taste is light, wheaty and incredible mellow for such a strong beer. The alcohol was almost none existant. Not very bitter and lightly spiced. Overall a great beer with a good balance of aroma and taste."
"Appearance all plosive, puffy and proud with a pinpoint prickly persona. Damn good brew! Pours yellow yet hazy and a touch golden. Champagne like carbonation with bubbles actively heading towards the beer's surface. Good headage that keeps puffing with swirling. Aromatics include tropical fruit, creme caramel and pecan pie. A wonderfully complex brew that hints of exotic fruits, anise, and ripe melon. In the mouth a nice interplay between sweet and bitter. Very warming indeed, with a touch of anteseptic!! One may be all I need, but this drinkability here is high as this beer simply rocks. It is sooo damn good! Practicably pornographic!!"
"Oh man, the stuff just flows in your mouth and the dried aged fruity tastes and malt explode across your palette! Tingly bubbly feel and slight hop to balance the big bold taste out nicely. A bigger beer in this style would be hard to attain. The alcohol is barely noticed until either it warms sufficiently or you try to stand up. Well done! Another winner from Unibroue, eh?"
"Beer poured with a small bubbly head that slowly dissipated to lace that was perpetuated by the carbonation cascading from the sides of the glass. Nice cloudy, light golden hue. Particles of yeast could be seen floating around the glass. Sweet, fruity malt aroma with notes of banana and yeast. Some slight alcohol was also apparent on the nose with a touch of hops. Carbonation hits the tongue first leading to a very fluffy mouthfeel. Nice combination of yeast, fruits and spices. Theres a slight alcohol warming sensation throughout the glass, but its never overbearing. Sweetness is well balance by mild hop bitterness and never becomes cloying. Finish is slightly bitter, but aftertaste is primarily a lingering of the spices. Quite a drinkable beer for the ABV level. Got to be careful with this one or there could be trouble!"
"Overall, a good beer, but definitely not my favorite Unibroue."
"Note: As I drink this beer more, I like it more. I am raising it's rating."
"The beer pours a cloudy light golden color with a 1/4"" frothy white head. The aroma is quite fruity. There are spicey accents with a hint of cloves. The taste is refreshing. Again, the spices are present. This a light beer that really goes down smooth. There is excellant carbonation and a low body. This is a great sessions beer."
"Wow, an exceptional brew that can fool you if you drink too many (and attack your pocket). Worth its place on the list."
"Update  The 2005 vintage lacked that explosive head of yesteryear that actually kind of annoyed me but otherwise was just about the same. I really enjoy the unique garlicky character of the aroma. Two thumbs up  a solid 4.5."
"Surprisingly mild for a 9% abv brew. Aroma is pleasant but not too strong. Color is quite pale and was a bit cloudy. Head was full with small bubbles that lasted through the finish. Both the mouth and finish a strong characteristic and typical for the style. It is quite polished and very much like a Chimay, and in this case a brew I slighly prefer to the Chimay."
"I hope it was just a bad sample, but if not, it really did taste like the End of the World."
"Quite a nice Belgian strong pale ale. It features a refined sophitication that I enjoyed."
"One of the better beers I've had to date. Definitely in the top 20."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable considering the 9%. I would have another one."
"Very coarse, foamy head. Brownish-yellow and hazy with some chunks that accidentally got poured. Lively, almost painful carbonation cause quite a row in the mouth. Once the beer had sat for 15minutes or so the bubbles because manageable. Spicy yeast give the beer most of its character. Good pale malt presence to spar with the yeast and hops. A good beer, but not one of my favorites from these guys. IMHO its way over-hyped."
"Drinkability: _Extremely_ drinkable, despite (and maybe in spite of) the alcohol content. I feel sorry I only bought one of these... thank God there's more at the store!!!"
"Went to a bar called ""Brude."" They had this on cask, and I knew I must try it. Oh Lordy, just beautiful. Dark gold hue, yeast sediment and a perfect head. The smell teases you, letting you know this is not just any beer, this is nectar. Beautiful, full bodied taste. Malty, nice bitter hops, fruity ester dances across your tongue in some sort of mystical ballet. Smooth, heavy mouthfeel that leaves you always wanting more, more, more. If their ever was a time I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it."
" Although not spectacular, I'd call the fin du monde eminently drinkable, and I'll indeed sample it again."
"Notes: I can't say I'm blown away. Complex, to be sure, but do all the varied notes add up to a ""top twenty"" brew? Mustard was hoping for a bit more ..."
"ng"
"Back in the day I used to jokingly refer to this stuff as a bowl of cereal in a bottle. Nowadays I'd agree to the fact that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and would advocate an ""end of the world"" to start off anyone's day."
"This was the first Belgian I ever had. The appearance threw me off a little b/c of the cloudy orangish color and texture. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I loved it. I have come back to this beer time and again. It has a very creamy smoothness that I really love. The taste is of tropical fruity sweetness and some spicy alcohol. Finishes long and dry with more fruityness. A great introduction to the world of Belgians for me!"
"My favorite offering from Unibroue,pours a hazy yellow with a gigantic blooming head,the aroma was very spicey and smokey with a slight tartness in the finish.There is a nice sweetness to this beer,a nice spiciness in the middle and a fruity finish.I get this underlying smokiness to this beer its very appetizing,a true hand crafted beer."
"Hazy pale yellow with a huge off-white head with quickly bursting tiny bubbles. The head drops quickly, but settles about a quarter inch above the liquid. Smell is mostly sweet lemon, some yeast, and a bit of pine. Flavor is rich and sweet. Flavor is a bit of yeast, then warm honey melts in the mouth, and finishes with some undertones of butterscotch and pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety. Aftertaste lingers long and delivers more honey. This beer holds its complexity to the last drop, and is surprisingly smooth for the alcohol that it delivers. Very tasty, but low drinkability because it is so rich."
"Another first impression Whoa! This brew foamed up 1/4 brew, 3/4 foam as I poured it into my glass. Its head was a very white color. The bubbles in the head ranged from small to large. Again, this is another very carbonated brew. This brew also had a very mild aroma. It too was hard for me to distinguish from other smells. It has a very light orange color with yeast particles floating in it. Its flavor contains a variety of different tastes. The carbonation once again rolls off the tongue. It is adding to my buzz tonight. I liked the flavor and taste of the brew. It agrees with me very much. All in all an excellent brew! This brew is very potent and it added to my buzz for the evening."
"Bring on the Maudite!"
"A very nice peachy, cloudy looking brew with a tall white head. The aroma is a huge winner here, with tropical fruits (kiwi,pinapple,banana, and coconut) all around, just perfect for what's to follow. A carbonated but smooth mix of spicy and tropical. The tropicals here are coconut and pinapple with spicy vanilla and yeasty flavors supplied in a light, airy body with a lightly bitter dry finish. Very delicious and unique."
"Originally sampled 31 July 2002. A cloudy, pale gold in appearance. It had a large, frothy white head and lots of champagne-like bubbles. It reminded me somewhat of a white beer. Its taste is slightly sweet & fruity. I found it to be very enjoyable and I'd have it again"
"Pop goes the cork, and rush goes the foamy head out of the bottle. Pour it and then gaze in astonishment at the hazy golden brew. Enjoy the enormous whipped texture head that seems to rejuvenate itself after every sip. Smell the wonderfully citric, yeasty and spicy aroma. And then sip it. YUMM! Perfect mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. This beer is full of spiciness, yeastiness, fruitiness, sweetness, sweetness, twanginess(if that's a word), and some alcohol of course. 9% at that. And it's barely noticeable. Most definitely my favorite Unibroue offering. Go drink this beauty."
"Must say, I love the labels on all of this brewerys beers. Very cool."
"Served out of the 12 oz. bottle into the Fin du Monde tulip glass. This beer poured a gold with a fair bit of head. The smell was very flowery and sweet. As for taste, the taste was as sweet as it smelled, with a strong element of fruit. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth. As for drinkability, it seems like having too many of them would be overwhelmingly sweet after a while. All in all, a great Belgian-style ale, and one that I would keep around to have one or two of in the future"
"Pours a spritzy champagne color with a spritzy 1/4"" head....nose is light with mainly yeast notes and some apples...body is firm and tight...carbonation seems perfect....boy is this smooth...no hint of the 9% ABV...very full-flovored beer...perfect sweetness..this is one of the best tasting Belgians I've had...so smooth, but flavorfull....great Belgian malts...a malty beer all the way...reminds me of a high quality Blonde Doppelbock made Belgian style.....some grassy hops are in the background but very small..Unibroue continues to impress me...this is one of the best beers I've had..."
"I had The End of the World in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a hazy orange-yellow with lots of bubble action. There is 2 fingers of foam that cut down to half a finger quickly. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. There smell is a citrus aroma with some light spices. The taste is fruity with a fair amount of hops to balance it out. The taste mostly reminds me of oranges. I was really surprised by the heaviness of the mouthfeel The drinkability is also fairly good for a 9% bew. This is a session beer with a punch."
"As is evident by my numbers, tasting the beer was not nearly as satisfying as looking at the beer. du Monde poured a foggy, light, straw yellow with an inflated head. The lace was exceptional. The smell was sweet and pungent with lime and other citrus flavors. The taste was a little too carbonated and it was a tad too tart for my liking. The alcohol and pepperness in the beer was just not balanced by anything else. It did have some good, rich malts and first rate bitterness. Overall a good brew, but I am not yet sold on them."
"I admit it. Pale ales are not my thing, especially those with really high alcohol content. This was no exception. It poured a cloudy yellow with a fuzzy white head. There was lots of spiciness in the smell, particularly ginger and arrowroot. Not much in the taste to mask the alcohol either, so I thought I was drinking a sloe gin fizz."
"$5.99 for 750ml or $7.99 per 4 pack."
"This is one of my favorite Unibroue's -- indeed, one of my favorite beers, as my numbers attest. If the end of the world is truly coming, make sure you bring one of these."
"In the mouth, it feels full and creamy without being heavy. The carbonation is a nice light interesting fizz. All in all, I think they've made a pretty delightful ale. This is a mighty fine beer, destined to become a regular in my house."
"Drinkability/notes: An extraordinary brew, one of stunning quality and devastating strength, to be accorded respect and savored with deliberation. This is a beer of rare quality."
"Drinkability: Damn good for it's strength. Not to sound like a broken record, but 'nobody' can hide alcohol like Unibroue. They make a 9%abv brew taste like a 5% brew, with only the aftereffect showing otherwise. Another great brew from Unibroue!"
"750 ml. Bomber. Poured a stickey, huge white foam over pale, golden yellow. Lightly fruity, clove-like, yeasty smell. Taste is a little spicey, but mostly sweet with a light fruit (mostly pear) taste. Extremely creamy with a medium to high level of carbonation. Definitely a beer to be respected. I'm paying the price for this one at the moment...drank it way too fast, but one that I'll come back to."
"A soft mouthfeel but a little fizzy feeling. Very easy to drink; best to sip but enjoyable in a gulp, too. Very tasty just not as complex as some Belgians. Even still, the best triple in the Americas."
"*This beer got me into craft brews. Still love it!"
"This beer poured a pale lemony color that was opaque but clear enough that I could make out that it was well carbonated. The head that was produced was thick, creamy and dense  white in color and stood till the last sip where there was a small skim left on top and a ring around the edges. It left behind a creamy sticky lace that was like a sheet being draped on the insides of the glass at the top then broke off into a delicate pattern at the end. The aromas that came from the glass, were of sweet malts and caramel, fruits (pears, apples) flowers, some hops, yeast, spice and a bit of alcohol (but well hidden). The flavors were of sweet and dark malts, caramel, fruits (more pears and dark apples), wood, citrus tones, light hops, spice yeast and alcohol. There was no aftertaste present anywhere on the tongue. The alcohol is big in this beer but you would never notice it unless you read the label, it is well blended all through the nose and pallet. This beer is smooth, creamy and complex, very drinkable, very, very drinkable. Just be careful because with the high alcohol content and its ability to hid amidst the other flavors you will not notice its bigness until you get up."
"Unibroue is one of the only non-Belgian breweries that can pull off the Belgian styles. They make some fantastic beers and this is definitely one of them! When tasting a Strong Golden ale, you always have to compare it to Duvel because it was the original and it still holds the title. This one comes pretty close, though."
"A complex beer. The aroma was lightly floral and yeasty. I detected aged coriander spice in the nose. This brew has a murky golden hue with a large, rocky white head which dissipates. Deliscious and malty, but well balanced. Not sweet. A touch sour with hints of citrus and alcohol. The 9% ABV is fairly well hidden. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. An acidic tad in the finish, but mostly just a long and dry finish to an excellent belgian style ale. Belgian Trippel fans must try this one."
"Drinkability - nothing coming back for."
"Tastes much the same -- but in layers of flavor. There's a definite pear and tropical fruit flavor upfront that forms a very inviting sweetness. A peppery, tingly clove spice flavor tickles the tongue. And finally, a warming alcoholic mouthfeel washes over the flavors and mutes them a bit as the beer is swallowed. It's astonishingly complex, and it's far and away one of the best beers in the world."
"Color a pale, cloudy yellow color with yeast floating around, nice white frothy head leaving clingy, patchy lace. Smells of lemon and tropical fruit, banana, with a hint of spice and sweet bitterness. Taste is more of the same, citrusy and tropically smooth and clean with a spicy lemon dry finish thats warming from the alcohol. Feel is medium body sweet and fruity flavors that dry out, nice, crisp and clean finish with warming qualities from alcohol. Pretty drinkable but is a sipper, 9%, it'll sneak up on you for sure."
"I picked this up at my favorite store in Cincinnati (Jungle Jims) along with it's next of kin Don De Dieu (reviewd later) and was pretty impressed. Like a novice I poured this wrong and the sediment came out into the glass, not a HUGE deal but it marred the taste a little. The look was a golden cloudy color with a tiny lace head that took a little time to dissappear. The citrus was strong in the odor and I could swear I tased some grapes. This was sweet, almost like a champagne with a lot of carbonation. Not a bad brew, smooth, almost too smooth. The 9% alchohol factor could definetly not be noticed. All around a nice beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Amazingly smooth. This is my favorite in its category, and one of my favorite three beers... ever!"
"This impressive beer pours a hazy dark gold with a very abundant and fluffy head. The head subsided slightly to a wonderful lace and foam that prevented me from every actually seeing the golden color from above. The slight bit of head I got with each taste added a very pleasant creamy flavor. The smell was predominantly spicy and yeasty. I could not easily pick out one flavor that dominated because the interplay of malt and spiciness was too well balanced. All the flavors also made my mouth sing in anticipation for the next sip. Each sip gives only a slight hint of the 9% ABV, which makes this brew dangerously drinkable. All in all this is an incredible beer that goes up there as one of the best I've ever had."
"My favorite Unibroue."
"The smell is spicy/sweet, with apples. The front is citrusy, spicy. Apples return in the middle along with the first hint that this is a relatively high-alcohol beer. The finish is crisp, clean, nice fresh bitterness with alcohol warming. The taste becomes more buttery as it warms. Overall this is a fantastic beer. I think it's more balanced than some of the other great Unibroues. It's sweet but not too sweet. The alcohol is somewhat obvious, but not bad at all for 9%."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, best before 10-24-05 date. Pours a pale cloudy yellow color with a lot of floaties, nice white frothy head that leaves a clingy lace in my glass. Has a clean bannana and spicy lemon aroma. Sweet and fruity flavors that dry out, nice crisp and clean finish, another great ale by this brewery."
"Whoa, this is one kick ass brew! I was skeerd(southern for scared) from it, cause it was from canada, and the only beers I had from canada pretty much sucked. I was so suprised. The head was one of the best I had gotten out of a beer in a while. It was very thick and lasted for a very long time. It never really went down to a laceing it was so thick. The color was a pale straw color. Oh, and it was bubbley too. The taste was complex. It had elements of wheat, citrus, flowers, and had a little tinge of alcohol in it. The aftertaste definately had some evidence of alcohol. I guess that was the only drawback, but it wasn't a bad one."
"A dangerous beer with a likeness to Duvel. Smooth, golden and full of hops and malt and the alcohol isn't present until after you try to stand up after a couple. It is a slow sipping beer or a summer refresher to be enjoyed with care. Seek this beer out is is the best of Unibroue's products."
"The folks at Unibroue never cease to amaze me. This is such a great beer. Pours a cloudy, golden color topped of by a huge fluffy white head, which settles down to about 1/4-inch. Aromas of cloves, yeasty bread, and spices entice the olfactory senses. Initial taste is sweet and malt, followed by a zing of spiciness. This is a medium-bodied beer finishes quite dry. Im amazed at the complexity of this wonderful nectar. La Fin Du Monde certainly holds true to its name; this is definitely the End of the World, as we know it."
"Nice 750ml corked bottle that pours a deep golden orange sunshine tone with a gleaming white head leaving a fair amount of lace around my tulip glass. High carbonation that tickles me nose hair and contains a deep syrupy sweetness with traces of honey and spice in the aroma along with the complement of the yeast strain scents. Tastes a very full complex sweetness with shots of bitter and dry sensations that run down the palate. Within the sweetness of the flavor lies a spiced up fruit like, thick mouthfeel of straight up refreshing goodness. Unibroue is amazing they are definitely capable of bringing the magic of Belgium beer to the North Americas, and for that I raise my glass to them. For making a beer with nine percent alchol that contains this level of drinkability and at the same time is staying within the guidelines of the style of any classic triple. Very good!!!!"
"I was hesitant in trying this beer since it came from Canada, but based on the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. Damn glad I did as it became one of my favorites on the first sip. Very competitive with the top Belgiums, yet at a lower cost (at last where I get my beer). Cloudy golden color with a nice light, but tight head. Despite a slight tartness, it is still somewhat sweet and very smooth. Also has a nice spice flavor, but not overwhelming. A tripel at its best! Despite the fairly high alcohol content (9%), there is very little alcohol flavor, but it is somewhat noticable on the after taste. Watch out Belgium. I am looking forward to trying the rest of the Unibroue beers. Well, time for another and another and ..........."
"Unibroue really amazes me. Their beer is as good as anybody's. As good as Chimay, Delerium, etc. Also, in that category, it is a relative bargain. The La Fin is not as spicy as the Don De Dieu. It reminds a lot of Chimay white, and maybe Delerium Tremens. Incredibly drinkable, potent as hell. As is the case with the others I've mentioned, pours a huge head, deep golden color, perfect balance. This is one of the few beers I could drink on a regular basis and never grow tired of. I give Duvel a tiny edge, as it is a little unique compared to the other similar beers, but the Unibroue 10, La Fin, and Don de dieu are right there (I also love Maudite and Trios pistoles). It's hard to believe people drink macro swill with stuff like this available in the grocery store!"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a cloudy golden color with a rising airy white head. Excellent head retention as it remained throughout consumption. Aroma consisted of yeast, malt, banana and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. There's peppery spiciness to the flavor, in addition to a sweet fruitiness and cloves. La Fin Du Monde seems to get creamier as it warms to room temperature. The 9% alcohol introduces itself in the finish as it warms the throat and belly."
"A nice dark gold color. Pours with a stiff tight white head. Clings all the way to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is slighlty sweet and spicey. Nice carbonation, a great warm flavor of spices mixed in with alcohol. An enjoyable brew ! Cant wait to try the others"
"The pour wasn't amazing. The beer is starting to flatten out. So I got sad for a second thinking that maybe the five year old La Finn Du Monde wouldn't deliver. Wrong! Holy shit! This is one of the best bottles of beer I have ever had! Damn! The flavor, mouthfeel, and drinkability have all made it to the realm of perfect scores. If anyone out there has any old unibroue they want to trade, I will forevermore be oh so very down for it! Please!"
" well, only when supplies of this beer Run Out for Ever."
"Excellent. Highly recommended. Mmmm...."
"An absolute treasure amongst beers, and an excellent triple in it's own right. World-class and highly recommended. This is just an exceptional brew and one of my personal benchmarks for the style. Ambrosia distilled."
" A terrifically engaging, hoppy mouthfeel, and an exceptionally warming feeling make this ideal beer for any sort of celebration, such as Anniversarys, holidays, Wednesdays, midnights, 2:45 A.M.s, anytime you're exultant that the world hasn't ended, didn't get fired, dog still loves you, etc., etc...."
"Backwash: This is a great beer, although I believe that it should probably sell for a bit less, considering the C$; and I think that Duvel (typically $6.99) is a better beer and costs more to ship. If this were priced like Ommegang (as it originally was), I would buy it by the case. Other than the limited Unibroue 10, this is probably my favorite Unibroue product so far (until I get my hands on the 11 and the La Terrible). Well worth the purchase. Thank you Canada!"
"There is no hint of alcohol in this at all... until about 15 minutes later. ""Oh, THERE you are!"" Definitely a sneaky ABV, but I'll forgive this brew, I doubt anyone can stay angry at it for long."
"Pale golden in color with a huge white head. Head stays fairly well. Excellent aroma that I'm taking great pleasure in. Black pepper spiciness, tart fruitiness, breadiness, and plain old yeast. Sure, it doesn't sound like much, but it certainly is a pleasure to sniff. And to drink...! Wow, I'm impressed. Sweetness and black pepper, odd combination? No way, it's great! Up front it's a little hoppy, then in the middle it gets to the sweet and peppery bit. Bready and a little yeasty as well, all the way through. Tangy citrus and fruitiness shows up at the back a bit more. Hop bitterness is really brought out in the finish, making it very crisp. Medium body. You'd never guess at the abv. Not a hint of it is detectable! A wonderful representation of the style, one of the best even. A wonderful beer in itself. It makes you think, what if the world was about to end? What would be your last beer? I'd say this wouldn't be a bad choice at all."
"The taste and sheer drinkability of this brew make it spectacular. Unless you read the 9% written on the bottle, it is very hard to detect. Alcohol flavor is only mild toward the end of each sip. Has flavors of clove, ripe fruits, banana, apple, and mild spices. A smooth, delicious mouthfeel make this a delight to drink a few of. Definitely one to enjoy in all its complexities."
"Keep your glass close by on this one, it is a bottle gusher. Popped the top on this one and it came rushing out. Once in my glass it was a hazy, golden-straw color, with a off-white head that left good lacing. The aroma was sweet, of candi sugar. Also in the aroma was spices, and graininess. The flavors I detected were of cloves, spice, and sweet candi sugar. It is fairly light to medium in body, and easy drinking. The alcohol warmth is in the finish, and the strength sneaks up on you. Tasty!"
"Notes: intense carbonation..Wheat,bread,grain,and malt noted..very complex."
"Drinkability: Very good. Very enjoyable."
"Nice appearance. Very hazy yellow-golden color. Nice thick white head, which sets uneven on the beer.Citrousy aroma, almost like sour apples. Alcohol almost ignites the nose hairs! Now the taste...Awesome!! Nice ciitrous taste on top of a doughy/alcohol base...lots going on here. Nearly goes down by itself...did I even swallow? Nice dry aftertaste with no syrupy mouthfeel..just taste and carbonation...warm belly to boot. Goes down nice & easy for a beer this high ABV...easy does it!!!!. One of the best belgian style beers I've tried....and it's not even belgian. Good stuff, in more ways than one!!"
"Pours a lightly hazed golden. Small champagne like bubbles race to the top, battling the sediment for the quickest path to join their fellows in the thick white head. Aroma is medium fruity (banana and apple), and lightly yeaty. Flavor is apple and banana, ending clean and dry with some yeast undertones."
"This one put the nail on the coffin for me. I had this one after a good night of beer tasting. The look was a golden blonde with the look that reminded me of champange with the head looking rather light. The smell is what resembled a sweet tangy candy with tints of spice, at some point it reminded me of apple pie. The taste was no doubt as close to the smell, has a tangy fruit based sometimes close to strawberries with an after taste of maple syrup. The drinkablity was the key point here, all that flavor with a 9% ABV in stealth mode, was the note the put me to sleep after. When having a beer for dinner consider this a candidate."
"Drinkability & Notes: One of my favourite Belgian style pale strong ales, a bit over the top for some people and one that I respect by sipping through the night."
"Cheers"
"Pours a hazy yellow you can not see through, big, big, head. Aroma of citris, lemon, grapefruit. Great clean, crisp mouthfeel with big carbonation, ala champagne. First sip reveals a little alcohol, but is soon hidden with complex fruit flavors and a small hop bite. Lace to the bottom of the glass, again, a slight alcohol finish, but still very drinkable. One of my favorites from Unibroue."
"Another very nice product from Unibroue. A refreshing Belgian style strong ale true to style."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a pale golden hue with a slight cloudiness(me like!) Dense creamy-white head which settles at about 1/4 inch. The carbonation won't let it get any less than that. Clean malty smell that reminds me of a fine Belgian. Spruce undertones. Alcohol warmth hits right away with a slight bitter bite. Smooth & creamy mouthfeel. Overall pretty impressive, but not my favorite Unibroue product."
"As it pours from the bottle, a slightly hazy lemon yellow, the head creamy in texture, the size masterful, the color a brilliant white, as it evanesces it leaves a silky sheet of fine lace to cover the glass. The aroma of finely malted grains dominates the nose, citrus crisp, lightly sweet and a pleasure to the senses. Start is ambrosial with lots of malt, the top middling in its feel with a spirited acidity, masterfully hopped, and a long drawn-out aftertaste that is dry. The 9% ABV, make this a real Belly Warmer, for these cold winter days and nights, a beer I love, and I always have a few bottles on hand as they age gracefully and I wish I could say the same for my own self."
"This beer poured a golden straw color and formed a bubbly white head that left circular lace. A small amount of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of citrus, spice(?clove) and some yeast elements. The flavor was of spice and citrus with a warming feeling of the alcohol present. The finish was a touch astrigent"
"First of all I feel bad about pouring this beer into a pint glass (it's all I have). But I'm really excited about trying it. I'm not well versed in the Belgian art (but not quite a virgin either). It pours a very effervescent yellow (lots of bubbly action in the glass) with a thin head. There's an appealing sour-lemon aroma with a little yeastiness. At first sip I'm thinking boy am I drinking this beer at the wrong time of year. Very refreshing, very summery. Comparable to some of the best Hefe's I've had but without the banana/clove flavors. Moderate body, very nice texture. The tart and sweet flavors compete but keep each other in balance. Tart in the beginning, more sweet in the finish. Clearly an accomplished brew even f you're not an expert in the style. I'll have more. Maybe in Quebec."
"An outstanding beer, one of my favorite Belgian styles and not too pricey to boot."
"the carbonation tingles your tongue as the smooth brew slides right down smooth as silk, leaving your tongue warm and leaving you warm and fuzzy. this is truly an incredible beer. i love Unibroue"
"A great beer."
"Very opaque hazy gold, big and generous head that laces in thick sheets rather than delicate threads. Champagne-like aroma, a sense of yeast as well. Great mouthfeel and moderate carbonation., malts of candied plums and cherries, slightest sense of a pithy hop bittering at the end. Just a hint of a wheat quality and little woodsy sense. A lot of fresh qualities. La Fin du Monde? Nah, this is just a beginning, one that gives me a sense of being live in Belgium and sampling the Ales fresh. Maybe my favorite Unibroue so far, powerful but tasty and drinkable"
"750 ml bottle - best before 7-4-05. Filled the tulip glass with a big and light head. It is blonde in color. Aroma of coriander but very light not overly so. Taste is of lemon and spices with a high alcohol content present. Leaves a sticky coating on the tongue after finishing but is quite drinkable for a something with 9.0% ABV. Very fizzy carbonation leaves light feeling in mouth. Drinking at 9PM on a Sunday night, it is a good way to cap off the night and the weekend."
"Pours a cloudy off yellow color with a small white head that didn't seem to last. The smell is fruity and a bit raw. Coriander, citrus and some other odd spices are what I taste in the beginning. The end is more like lemon and spices. A bit in your face at first but very smooth in the end. I am very impressed to say the least. Can this company produce a bad beer?"
"It's difficult for me to describe this beer because the flavor is pretty much all over the place. A floral taste equally combined with a bold wheat flavor kicks things off, and from there, you're on your own to figure out what flavors you encounter. I sure as hell have a hard time. Ripe fruit with a subtle but noticeable malt flavor might do the trick. I hated this beer at first, but I grew to love the complexity and richness of it. If you're kind of a rookie beer taster like me, check out the Unibroue variety case. It's bomb. When I drink this stuff, it makes me want to shake my skinny white ass to some Kool & the Gang."
" One execclent beer!"
"Pours a pale-straw color with tons of medium sized bubbles that float up to the huge, pure white, frothy head. Appearance is wonderful and does have nice rings of wispy lace and good head retention. Fruity, cider-like aroma with pepper and yeast. Medium bodied and very smooth on the palate. Starts with a sweet maltiness that makes way for clove and peppery flavors. Very complex, finishes slightly dry with some hop flavor. The alcohol is hidden very well, almost too well as after a few bottles of this tasty treat you won't be able to stand."
"Even a very slow pour will reveal a huge, foamy white head sitting atop this cloudy/golden brew. The maltiness & alcohol are big up front. Earthy notes and a hint of spice give la fin du monde a complex and dry finish. A definite classic out of Quebec."
"-F"
"La Fin Du Monde = The End of the World.  The first time I tried this beer... it was a whole new beginning.  What a wonderful beer... can't believe it took me this long to review it.... Cloudy brownish-gold with a lace that won't die.  Aroma of cloves, must, alcohol, and malt.  Flavor of fresh plums, bananas, cloves, and a lot of alcohol in the aftertaste.  Wonderful, creamy medium body, with moderate carbonation.  A favorite of mine for quite some time."
"Pours a dark golden color with a puffy white head.  Clove and a little banana flavours.  Very complex with alot of changing flavors.  Once again I am unable to verbalize what I taste in a beer. I need to go to Belgian Beer School."
"Exceptionally well-done tripel."
"As a warning, this beer will cause ""beer-inflation"" among its fans. Those once content to imbibe in a $6 six-packs of Sam Adams, will find themselves shelling out $8.50 for four-packs on Unibroue products on a regular basis. It's that good."
"Candied...Banana...Candy"
"This must be the champagne of beers.  Upon opening the bottle, the beer started to climb out the opening.  I poured it into a nice thistle style glass and was amazed by the fantastic head that seemed to only fade slightly.  The nice creamy head atop the beautiful pale ale is a sight to behold.  The aroma was delicate with a hint of vanilla and citrus.  While being high in alcohol, it was not evident at all.  This brew is well worth finding.  One of my all time favorites."
"It also is supposed to age up to ten years in a corked bottle- see my review for Maudite, and what aging did for that!"
"Pours a beautiful hazy, golden color with a huge, creamy white head that sinks slowly and leaves an excellent lace on the glass.  Definite orange peels, spices, and a slight tartness to the aroma.  Big fruitiness up front with some nice oranges, peaches, grapes, and some slightly tart fruitiness as well.  Nice spiciness as well with some pepper and coriander.  The brew finishes with a burst of sweetness from the candy sugar and a slight warming sensation from the alcohol.  A creamy carbonated feeling dominates the mouthfeel and helps to make this medium-light bodied beer extremely drinkable, especially for the amount of alcohol that is in it.  Yet another great beer from Unibroue."
"This beer should be outlawed. It pours nice, leaves no sediment. No hint of the alcohol content in the first taste, last taste, or any taste in between. You can taste every ingrediate in it. It is crisp, light, and the best ale hands down. I found only one bar in town that serves it. I find myself there at least twice a week. Be warned! This is the crack of beers. All else will seem pale in comparison. They better have this in heaven."
"This beer pours well with a large head.  The smell and taste are very complex and I found it very hard to pinpoint each flavor ( I thought I tasted citrus, some spice, ..)  The beer is very drinkable for such a strong beer, I would not have guessed that it had 9%.  I really enjoyed the layered flavors, it usually confuses and distracts me, but in this case it was great."
"I really enjoyed La Fin Du Monde.  Full flavored taste, with a slight bitterness.  This beer defines the term ""well-crafted"".  Robust and complex.  The alcohol is well blended in this beer. Excellent, Oui!"
"Unibroue, represents a vision of what sincere dedication to quality, patience, and character can bring out in the artform that is brewing."
"A short-lived head pours on this murky, hazy golden colored beer. Very carbonated.  Citrus and cloves in the nose, but a mild aroma compared to others in the style.  A nice malt taste, mixed with esters and yeast make the beer very pleasant.  I also get fleeting hints of sour apples.  I have to second other reviewer's notes that the beer hides it's alcohol well.  Nicely balanced, slightly grassy finish.  A very drinkable belgian style ale."
"Astonishingly different on tap than it is from the bottle - but not necessarily better. I think it benefits greatly from the high level of carbonation that can be lessened on tap. Cloudy, yellow-gold in color with a full, bright-white head that holds fairly well and leaves a decent lace. The body is similarly light-medium, but the mouthfeel is more creamy as the carbonation has been reduced. There's a lightly sweet ""tropical fruit"" note to the aroma. The flavor has a more ""orange-ish"" note, and a gentler spice. Overall, it seems to lose a bit of character which is normally derived from the assertive carbonation bite. Still a very good beer but on draft it seems to taste like many other beers in its category."
"The clear light golden / dark straw hued brew is topped by a creamy, impressively thick head w/ stiff peaks of foam.  Signature lace is left down the glass.  Fruit esters comprised of tart lemon flesh and rind, coupled w/ cidery light candi / beet sugar sweetness and raw honey lend an enticing aroma to this brew.  Phenolic clove and mustiness are subdued, but add complexity aromawise.  Prickly carbonation and cidery sweetness sharply hit the palate upfront, but quickly yield to yeasty, unbaked dough notes and clove more prominent in flavor than the aroma would suggest.  Well attenuated and fairly dry, but since hop bitterness is mild, the overall flavor is slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Lightly bodied due to the sugar used in the grist w/ a crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel that lends deceptively agreeable drinkability.  Finishes dry w/ honey sweetness, lightly peppery alcohol and clove abruptly ending simultaneously.  Fin Du Monde epitomizes the style and is delicious... the drinkability is superlative considering its strength."
"The hazy golden brew throws out a long-lasting bubbly white head that forms craters as it slowly dissipates.  Some nice yeast tones on the nose.  A little fruitiness.  And some bread qualities too.  This beer is quite smooth for the high alcohol punch that it packs.  Very nice taste.  Doughy and yeasty. Fruity esters are present. Subtle spicing accents also surface mildly throughout.  The body is light and the mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but still very drinkable.   Very nice Belgian style beer."
"Another winner from Unibroue, poours toa very nice color with a nice and lasting creamy head.  Nice but not overwhelming aroma and a taste that might be to strong for the novice.  Also be careful when imbiding this beer has a kick...........CHEERS"
"I tried a 750 mL corked bottle. This was my first Unibroue brew, and if it's any indication, it won't be my last. This was just a really good Belgian-style ale. It was a little tart with some warming alcohol (9% ABV) lying underneath. It reminded me a little of Duvel in that it hides that big alcohol content underneath a somewhat bittersweet taste and bubbly mouthfeel which just attacked my palate. This one worked well with teryaki marinated pork chops on the grill."
"Insanely active head. Big airy foam. It was difficult to pour it softly enough to keep it under control, but from the taste and the lack of foamy at opening, it wasn't infected. Aroma is lemon on top of apricots. Light lemony/apricot flavor that rides on a noticeable malt backbone. Has a little of the cottony mouthfeel but not enough to hurt the drinkability. Probably the best Belgian golden ale I've tried."
"This is another of my favorites from Unibroue. Pours with a nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly.  Has rather effervescent carbonation. Smell is citrusy with a spicy note to it. Not as creamy of a mouth feel as the Don De Dieu, but I suppose that's partly due to the carbonation. Flavor is citrusy, banana like. There's a spice that I can't quite put my finger on, tastes like allspice to me.  This is a wonderful beer for sitting back and relaxing on a hot summer day."
"750mL bottle (w/ cork).  The first pouring yielded little head, but the smell which hit me almost immediately as I started pouring was a beautiful citrus and peach odour.  The colour was a beautiful cloudy pale gold.   The taste is magnificent, completely disguising the high alcohol content.  The second pouring gave about 2cm of head, and tasted just as good as the first.  An extremely good and drinkable beer!!  Glad I am that I chose this to drink on my birthday."
"La Fin Du Monde is the best that ""Unibroue"" has to offer. I can taste the citrus flavor on my tongue which leads to a pleasant finish. Very smooth with not a lot of bitter after taste. I'm keep this brew for myself!"
"Translation of La Fin Du Monde is the end of the world. I would certainly travel to the end of the world for this beer. An amazing example ofthis style. The cloudy orange - yellow appearance with a beautiful white that clings to the glass. The complexity of the taste will have you thinking of adjectives to descirbe this beer. But simply out and in ine word ""incredible"""
"Hazy golden orange appearance, decent head and lace, steady supply of carbonation.  Wonderful aroma-  orangy citrus fruits, spicy yeast, alcohol.  Peppery spices, light malts, and orange and alcohol come back around in the flavor.  Drying finish.  Would I be hanged if I thought this beer was slightly watery?  It certainly wouldn't be the end of the world."
"Pours a cloudy yellow/amber color with a 2 finger pure white head that dissipates displaying large soap-like bubbles.  The smell is a pleasant fruity hoppy smell.  Similar in taste fruit-wise as some of the lower ranked Unibroue products, but the hop bitterness helps this brew.  I don't like this as well as Trois Pistoles, but it is still a little better than good.  Still a nice experience.  A votre sante!"
"PS...  The rest of the family might go like this Maudite is sweet mom, raftman grandpop, ""10"" of course little sister,  L'Eau Benite Dad, Blanche De'Chably (the playboy mag under the mattress, and  Trois Pistoles grand mom.... Adopt me please..."

"La Fin Du Monde: The End of the World.  Had it in a 750 ml bottle, with the cork top.  Until I joined BA, I would never have bought such a beer.  Until I reviewed so many (now 100! Beers), I would have gushed over this beer.  But I must say, it seems like a paler version of its Belgian counterparts.  It was a wonderful looking beer, but had huge chunks of the sediment floating in the second glass, despite my best efforts to pour it steady. Cloudy, golden appearance.  Aroma was very pleasant of citrus and yeast.  The beer itself was very nice, crisp and clean (almost airy) with a mix of bananas and citrus (fresh oranges).  All in all, this beer did not have the aggressive characteristics of a beer like Duvel, and at six bucks a bottle, I was looking for more."
"It's a nice gold with a white head that disappeared quickly.  The smell and taste are citrus and spice with just a hint of hops.  This is a beer that would probably be enjoyed by many who aren't accustomed to high-gravity beers because the smell and taste of alcohol aren't overwhelming.  However, the ABV could make LFDM dangerous for the uninitiated.  This is another nice beer from our friends up north."
"It's rather hard to believe that this brew contains 9% ABV. Pale, pale wonderfully pale. Fruity must and spice nose. The moment you notice the sweetness a rush of mellow bitterness tugs your buds for attention. At the ""End of the World"" there is a brewery that turns out some fantastic beers. Quality, Eh!"
"At warmer serving temps this is highly carbonated and will gush out of the bottle like champagne if you don't get in the glass fast enough. Has a lemony, sulfur like aroma. Vanilla, apple flavors blend well with phenolic alcohol flavors. Some mild spice taste. Just the right amount of sweetness from sugar additions. Dangerously easy to drink."
"(BB date 9-04) Pours a nice cloudy peach or light orange color (almost blond). Superb appearance! High alcohol kick and fruity character on the palate, with an ever so light tartness to it, and maybe notes of apple peels too. Over all this is an excellent Belgian Ale and another great one from Unibroue I thought this was going to be hard to top.Orval Trappist Ale was the next in line!"
"Well, on futher inspection, i find the alcohol to be to overwhelming, quite peppery and yeasty, with some mango nectar style stuff happening, with perhaps a bit of a white wine like character, a bit cloying and sweetish like many other Unibroue beers, but i still enjoyed it enough to give it a decent score."
"My second Unibroue, and I am hooked. I love the hazy, orange-yellow look of this beer. Someone mentioned mysterious, and I agree. The smell is intoxicating, fruity, peppery, an almost exotic spiciness. The taste is equally amazing, like a burst of flavors that go off in different directions that meld together to create a perfect balance of sweet fruitiness, bitter orange rind, and peppery spice. I want another."
"Simply outstanding. I wish I could bathe in this stuff. Cloudy straw in color. Some people may knock it for being so hazy and unrefined. I personally like beer that is cloudy..it adds to the mystery. The yeast really add complexities layed upon more complexities. I am somewhat at a loss as to how to describe the taste. Others have mentioned tart apples...yeah maybe, but so much more. Each sip is a new experience. A beer that no doubt would age well. Unibroue is an expectional brewery, and this is (in my opinion) their best offering."
"Tastes surprisingly like a mimosa, with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Deceptively high alcohol content.  I'm not a huge fan of the style, but it's clearly well made."
"Cloudy, blond, with a long lasting white fluffy head.  Spicy, bubbly, and slightly tangy.  There is an alcohol presence that is slightly warming, but it is not overwhelming. A strong, souring, complex, lengthy aftertaste."
"Fantastic beer! Truly a world class beer from Unibroue."
"One of the milder-flavored offerings from this brewery.  Nicely done, very smooth and drinkable."
"Notes: Truly a potent and delicious brew with many hard to achieve complexities. Unlike other brews of this strength, this one is extremely drinkable due to its balance of alcohol and dextrins. Outstanding."
