"O: You do not notice the alcohol while drinking this beer."
""
"My perfect look to a fresh poured beer out of a tap. I drank it out of a 13.5 Belgian Snifter. This allowed the trip!! I loved this beer after a long day of work. The smell was hoppy and citrusy but not overwhelming in either area. This was an easy drinking hop in the back of the tongue beer. I loved the alcohol content while being so easy to drink. Which can be risky business!"

""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex Belgian trippel."
""
""
"I'm a fan of both Dark Horse and tripels but his seems a rather poor effort that lacks refinement."
""
""
"There is a spicy note to this tripel. Clove and banana dominate here, with a yeastiness that comes right through. Has a dustiness to the mouthfeel. Good but muddled in a sense."
""
"If you are a tripel fan you may really enjoy."

"Orange golden color, hazy. Thin white head. Malts and orange aroma. Flavour is not far off of the aroma! Good beer!!!"

"Got me going! Pours a thick foggy amber with a ring of foam around the outside of the glass. Almost no initial appeal to this. In fact, there was a ton of sediment that I didn't care for at all. Looked like rocks in the bottom of my glass! Once I dove in it was a game changer. Great smokey, banana, clove nose despite the lack of head. ""Once it hits your lips, it's so good!"" Ready for whatever was to come, I was pleased. Slightly warming with the all the Belgian yeasty goodness. A beautifully crafted beer."

"Nice tripel characters, but just feels lacking in the complex sugars that makes the best Belgian versions sing in such beautiful harmony."
""
""
""
"Surely not the most complex yeast ester profile, and the malt is a bit heavy for the style, but a very approachable, inexpensive Belgian style beer. A minerally character emerges that is offputting, and the bitterness is more than I prefer."

"Sapent Trip pours a nice golden color with a good sized non lacing head. There is a strong ester and yeast like aroma. The flavor has a strong banana taste and is very creamy. There is a good feel and good body to this beer, with strong flavors. Overall its full of creamy banana flavors."

"12 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/6/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, orange, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of apricot, orange, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, golden raisin, pear, apple, light banana, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly crisp/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice tripel style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: I've had some great 'Murican-made tripels (Allagash Tripel, Boulevard Long Strange Tripel, hell, even Flying Fish's Exit 4 was damn enjoyable). This isn't even close to being one of those - it might even be the worst example of the style I've had yet. The best I can say about this is that I can power through it without dumping it. Even better, Dark Horse makes a bunch of solid beer that I can drink instead of this crap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: whilst I am a big fan of Tripels, this was a very poor attempt. No complexity and no body, leaving just a half-hearted awkward whack of Belgian-ish flavours. Add a price over AU$150 for a case, and this one doesn't make the cut."
""
""
""
"OK; NOTHING SPECIAL!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not terrible for the price, but not something to be amazed by. Middle of the line beer that is worth trying if you are in desperate need of a new beer, but not something to continue buying. Stick with Belgian produced beers if you want a satisfying Belgian style trippel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an okay american tripel. Mild spices and yeast fruity body. Just okay"

"I will be honest in that I am a bit intimidated with how folks can review beers like they do. I will say I am definitely in for some big time 'beer education'! I really enjoy this beer the more I drink it, which is interesting because at first I truly did not enjoy it. Particularly because it was way to hoppy for me. I have somewhat forced myself to drink more hoppy beers and my palate is being refined! That is all for now."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not too bad of a beer, but this isn't a great Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"P.S. Is there a way to dispense with the cheesy, comment-free smart phone 'reviews'? 'I'm just so busy, I cannot be bothered to comment...' Well then, don't bother!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tripels kind of have to work hard to set themselves apart, and this one is not the best I've ever had. But I really like the honey-orange angle on this one, and I would definitely spring for it again."

""

"O: strange tripel that tastes more like an eisbock or hefe-weizen than a Belgian Tripel."
""
"The feel is nice, low carbonation, and smooth but not particularly full. The 9.5 ABV is completely hidden as I was a touch surprised to read that figure on the bottle."
""
""
"This is a spicy Belgian tripel ale.  It pours a particulated orangish color with thin white head that is not lacing.  The scent is typical of most Tripels.   So is the taste but it carries a nice spice and clove.  The mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a good one for those that enjoy Belgian tripels."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A decent Belgian inspired brew. Not up there with the best Belgian tripels but ok. Ha s some nice dried fruit notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I rank this right up there with my other favorite Belgian trippels and would get it again."
""
""
""
"Poured into a goblet. Color was a medium amber, with next to no head. A few small streams of bubbles rose from the bottom. Aroma had a bit of alcohol, but shifted to a primarily fruity sweet, hints of prune. Reminded me a milder barleywine. Flavor was sweet, more on the sugary side, but not excessively so. Despite the sweetness, came across a little thin and watery. Overall it was pretty good, but not great."
""
"O: Overall worthy drinkability, dry grains and fruit touch. Light warming of alcohol but is highly manageable. Wont blow your socks off, but would readily reach for another one. A little loose, could use some tightening up (i.e. sharper, crisper flavor and carbonation)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not a big fan of this one. alcohol should blend better. other flavors should have more kick"

"From reading the review above, I'm sure it sounds like I hate this beer. I don't. I guess I was being hard on it because I expected much more. It's definitely ""good"" in the sense that I'd have it again (and I have), but it just doesn't stand up to some of the big-boy tripels out there. It lacks the robustness, finesse, and complexity that the style commands, although it's still a reasonably tasty and drinkable beer in a more broad sense."
""
""
""
"Pours fairly flat for a Belgian Trippel and has an pretty hazy orange look. The smell hit you with a little spice which is mostly cloves but nothing that seems to impressive. The taste is pretty lacking too. It hits you with some cloves and like the look, it was kind of flat. Keeps reminding me of a watered down version of Weyerbacher Merry Monk. Overall nothing great going on here. I probably will pass on this in the beer isle."
"O- Just great. I'll be repurchasing the shit out of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent tripel. Nice fruity esters with an underlying sweetness that works. It's a bit boozy though, which would probably be a big detractor for me. But it isn't like a lot of the disastrous tripels you see American breweries putting out."
""
""
""
"great addition to the mix six i picked out"
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm sorry to say that this is quite disappointing. First the appearance is frightening. It's murky and has a ton of stuff floating around. If this came out of a faucet I would have freaked out. The nose is almost nonexistent. The taste is intensely bitter which takes away from everything else. The booze is also intense. The finish is quite dry which seems to leave the intense bitterness on the palate. The esters that come through are nice, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it. I won't be picking this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"OK attempt. Flawed, but what works...works well. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall - This was my first Dark Horse beer. I know they are rated highly, but I would say that if you want a triple, get another brand. Nothing special here."
""
"Overall, a very ""different"" tripel, and I love that. I'm used to the typical banana and clove flavors (to the point where I've often had some trouble deciphering between a Dunkelweizen and a Tripel), so this is a welcome change. The bit of tartness is also nice ... a wonderfully fruity, tasty beer."
"O- This is a deliciously malty beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. I am more of an IPA/Imperial Stout guy, but this beer could certainly satiate my occasional thirst for something sweeter and maltier."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it quite good, smooth, mellow. Has good texture, not too pricey, local, I'd recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer definitely tastes strong but for the most part the alcohol is well masked from the taste. It's not very complex but is a pretty good American representation of a Belgian style."
""
"O - Overall, At 9.5% this beer is an easy drinking killer, Although it tastes nothing as I had expected. Not a great craft brew honestly, But I'd have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty triple, a touch less boozy smell and taste could help it quite a bit"
""
""
"O: I really liked this beer, but it had as much in common with some strong ales I've had as it did a tripel - fruity orchard flavors, but also savory, earthy, and musky - had a chewy consistency, whereas I think of tripels being a little more soft and fuzzy. Again, this was a great beer. I suspect it may be better than the reviews its getting simply because it is a little ""off"" as a tripel."
""
""
"O- Overall, im from Marhsall, Home of the Dark Horse, and this is one of my my favorite regular beers, it is no Westmalle, but is a fantastic american version of a tripel, and a Dark Horse staple that means spring has arrived and Scotty must leave"
"I am not a huge fan of tripels, but overall I think this is a nice example of the style and a fine part of Dark Horse's stable. For big fans of the style or fans of this brewery only. There are far better tripels out there if you're just starting to explore."
""
""
""
"O: Not a terrible tripel, but not very good, either. It lacks complexity and attenuation and is a bit too boozy as well."
""
""
""
"A decent sipper."
""
""
""
"Overall this tripel is not delivering, there's no body, no malt sweetness, no candy tasting goodness, even the wonderful bouquet on this is not coming out in the palate. Too bad because it smells really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- Nothing jumped out at me. I had thoughts of drainpouring but I finished it. Pass on this one, there are better Tripels out there."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Just sort of unpleasant in the mouth. Quite bland and simple. The ABV is completely hidden under the wheat malt. I like Dark Horse as a brewery, but this one just really didn't do anything for me - compared to other dark horse beers as well as tripels."

"Came from a tap, head was fine and lingered - nice lacing. Golden color, slightly cloudy. Smells of apricots, malt, some spice. Tastes of biscuit, banana. Not a bad mouthfee - crisp came to mind. Overall a nice beverage, not really what I have learned to expect from a triple - but quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is an adventure. It is novel. It is cool. A beer definetly worth experiencing, even if it is just to say ""been there, done that."" This is really what craft brewing is about: diversity. The boldness to put something different out there. Something that is really one of a kind. This beer may not please everyone, but it is definetly worth the expereince."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Certainly not that sweet as most tripels but it's still drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
"Not bad, but not a great tripple. Drinkable enough, and I will enjoy it, but probably wouldn't seek it out again. The taste in particular is a little bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good flavor. I was disappointed at first, but it's grown on me. The dry, yeasty finish helps. This has been an inconsistent six-pack though. Flavors and haze have fluctuated."
""
""
""
"D-What a nice surprise....great tasting triple with a lot of sweet fruity flavors....just enough clove on the finish to add some complexity...definitely worth buying....only thing I don't care for is the slight B.O. yeastiness aroma..."
"I cannot really recommend this one."
""
""
"Drinkability: Not the best tripel, not even the best out of Michigan I've had recently ... but a solid one nonetheless, and if you like yours on the fruitier side of things, it's worth a try. Then again, a lot of this could be the age on this bottle (it's at least three years old), so who knows. Worth a try either way, though I wouldn't imagine it being a go-to for me, if I had the opportunity to make it as much."

"Pours a two-finger off-white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy light amber color, some yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light fruity nose and flavor is fruit and caramel. Higher ABV is hidden. $2.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Too mild, flavorless and bland for me. This is way to easy to drink, and lacks flavor. Not very good, maybe good as a starter tripel, other then that, alot better out there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a smallish tightly bubbled white head that displays moderate retention. Smells of sweet malt and candy sugar, slightly spicy and peppery with some Belgian yeasty esters. Taste starts off sweet and malty with some sweet candy sugar that slowly gives way to some peppery spicy notes. Finish is a long lingering spicy earthy Belgian yeast kind of thing. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Decent triple ale but not my favorite. This really needs more of a sweet malt backbone to stand up to the spicy peppery flavors at work here."
"All my friends and I are obsessed with this beer come summer. Screw oberon, this tastes better and is a lot stronger for the same price. Very pleasant balance of grainyness, slight citral and clovelike flavors with some banana as well. Hides alcohol very well. A staple to all my summers."
"Like it? Yep"
"d - One and done. Not liking this at all. Love the Black Ale....this...nope. Just too messy. Spicey....dry...no malt...no hops...no real fruit notes. Not a huge Tripel fan but I've had better."
"I like the style, but this one seems so clean and flavorful, My pick for best Tripel this year. Rich yet well balanced."
"Pours a very nice bright copper/orange color with some nice initial head and a bit of lacing. Nice deep aroma with good malt sweetness and a huge hit of spice. Decent thick malt flavor, with a huge sweetness and huge spiciness (peppery a bit); although it's almost too much and slightly cloying. Nice thickness, but a bit too much spiciness that causes some roughness."
"What the hell's going on on this label? Anyway, the contents pour a clear auburn-brass topped by a finger of cream-white foam and populated by streaks of floaties (kinda reminds me of liquid sandstone). The nose comprises clove, light maple syrup, lemon zest, orange zest, black pepper, light banana, and a touch of toasted caramel in the back. The taste holds notes of heavy clove, black pepper, light banana, toasted caramel, honey, mandarin orange syrup, and a pinch of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly syrupy feel. Overall, an interesting and solid brew. As a true tripel, I think it misses the mark a bit, but its unique take on the style is still pretty easy to appreciate. Not bad."
"While I'm still getting my bearings regarding tripel style beers, it is my distinct impression that they would not typically be as sharp as this one is. Still, I found it to be a pleasant brew overall, and am glad to given this Dark Horse offering a try."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden /brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, yeast, some alcohol, not overly flavorful. Taste is the same, yeast, fruits, alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Pours a dark yellow color w/ decent one finger off white head. Average carbonation and lacing on this beer. On the lighter side for the style. Nose is yeast, fruit, some hops, and a little clove. It's ok, but everything seems a little off balance to me. Taste is the same as the nose profile. It's just not quite right. Feel is decent. I had high hopes for this beer, but it's definitely a substandard tripel. I would drink this again, but only if there weren't any better offerings."
"O- it's average to below average. Won't try it again."
"It tastes good, it's easy to drink, but I think I'd rather have a Rochefort 10 or La Trappe Quad anytime."
"I've liked all the DarkHorse brews I've sampled, but this one, I do not like it Sam I Am. Next time I'm in I'll ask for a sample of Sapient, make sure I got the right stuff."
"A very mediocre tripel."
"Overall a little washed out."
"Overall an enjoyable beer. I just wish the alcohol content was covered bettered."
"O: Not bad at all. I wasn't expecting a stellar tripel for a whole $10 for a 6pk. They've kept it simple and smooth - very drinkable. Sometimes you don't want a beer with 20 different characteristics. I like it!"
"I love Dark Horse's beers, so glad I tried it. It's not their best offering, but not bad."
"Poured a hazy Orange with a quick receding white head. A light spotted lacing remained. Aroma was sweet with a peppery edge to it. Sweet light fruit and yeasty notes were barely there. Flavor was cloves, sweet caramel malt and earthy fruitiness, well-blended with a nice spicy/sweet finish. Great balance between the spicy and sweet notes throughout. Medium bodied, smooth. I can't believe it is 8.5% abv. Not 1 hint of Alcohol. Good stuff."
"O - good belgian, could use a little work, mainly as denoted in the T category."
"O: got for only 2.25 due to the stock crash at kzoo beer exchange. Not super well balanced but overall a good beer."
"Pours an extremely murky, reddish-golden orange color with a medium white head that settles slowly. Scent is filled with a lot of clove and banana. Some nice Belgian yeast as well. Taste is initially spicy with nice pepper flavors...then it gets yeasty. Tons of Belgian yeast and clove, mixed with alcohol flavors. Banana flavors throughout. The flavors are all quite nice, they just seem to be a little unbalanced to my palate. Mouthfeel is a little on the chewy side for a tripel, as I like mine to be a little more crisp. Drinkability is high, as this beer is pretty tasty. Overall, not the best example of this particular style, but it is definitely a beer worth drinking."
"Triple that I don't expect to remember, although there was nothing close to unpleasant about it either."
"V: At 10.99, it's a decent price for a tripel, but the quality just isnt there"
"Taste-Belgian yeast, earthy hops, orange rind. Very smooth for the strength, with a refreshing, Saison-like quality. Tasty and very drinkable. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall, this tastes more like a strong Belgian style wit beer. It seems too light/watered down for a tripel. The flavor is decent and nice for a warm weather beer but for the style not great."
"The flavors are too earthen and muddy to accurately represent the style. Not quite my taste, but pleasant qualities (e.g., aroma, mouthfeel, and appearance)."
"MF: Very crisp, very smooth with a nice warming effect @ the finish."
"D – Good tasting brew, not overly strong in general except some sweetness up front. More bready and wheat then expected. Couldn’t drink too many of these but glad I tried this one. I recommend it"
"Good thing I just have the one, or this could get dangerous quick.."
"O. This is a great tasting beer that hides its 8.5% ABV very well and if most tripels taste this good than this could easily become one of my favorite styles. If anyone has any suggestions on what other tripels to try than let me know."
"Overall- Good, I wish it was warmer out. It seems like it would be more appreciated. The alcohol is hid rather well."
"Served on tap in a tulip glass. Pretty nice. Packed a flavorful punch, a little less on the hoppy side, and more on the floral side, if that's what you look for in a tripel. Hazy amber color with moderate head. Floral aroma with light fruits. Light fruits in the taste, peaches, apricot, banana, light sugar. Light-medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable."
"o - Overall a really nice trpiel and another very good beer from Dark Horse. Something I would love to have again."
"Overall I did have a good portion of sediment in the bottom so I give some leeway to Dark Horse that this bottle might be old but I did like how hop forward this was and how well the ABV was concealed. Might consider buying it again fresh to try or maybe pick up another single from D's. For me this is one drinkable Tripel!"
"Pours a clear amber beer. Nice amber light. this is amedium quality white head for my part. Herbal in the nose, malty smooth in the mouth. European hops background. Maybe more intresting with sa little bit of yeast sleeping in the bottle. Nice belgian tribute."
"A sipping beer for sure with an 8.5& alcohol level, but the alcohol is not overpowering or dominant here. It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall: Dark Horse makes some interesting and fine beers. This one is good. Simple, and could creep up on ya."
"Murky dark orange with a slight lumpy head. Barley, orange peel and burnt sugar in the nose, not much in the way of ""Belgian"" spiciness in the aroma. Tangy malt flavors, citrus and a cookie-like sweetness. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. A tasty beer but not the best from Dark Horse and not really true to the style."
"They'll find their groove with this one. It's a strong Belgian contender and better than many US Belgoans, but is just not quite there yet."
"Not the best tripel around (still a bit too sweet), but quite good. Would buy again."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV & style. A good example, not as epic as I hoped"
"d - while the nose is sweet and zesty (tropical fruit & exotic spice) the taste is dry, earthy and uninspired. possible overfermentation or overhopping plus too much sediment. reminds me a little of bit 'o honey candy - seems exciting and sweet at first, but ends up flat and almost flavorless halfway through. perhaps this brewery should stick to american ales."
"D: Goes down better than most Belgians I've tried. Well-done ale. This is one of the only Tripels I've liked - ever."
"D--I remember liking this one a bit more in previous visits. Certainly a very solid Tripel but not a standout...I recommend the brew for people who enjoy the style and Dark Horse is great brewery."
"This is another winner for Dark Horse. The Sapient Triple Ale has most of the attributes of its Belgian fore-bearers but, doesn't have to cross national borders and comes at a much more reasonable price. Despite its high alcohol content this triple is very drinkable...one's good, two is better."
"-Bye"
"I was excited to get this beer home...I love the beers Dark Horse produces,But this is not my favorite beer from their but it is my top three. The beer pours as a trip ale would, with foam not hanging around long, The flavor is nice.This beer would be refreshing on a spring day ...thanks Dark Hourse"
"Overall impression: Not exactly memorable, but worth a shot."
"A good looking tripel with a golden brown color that is slightly hazy. The nose reminds me of pears, golden dirt and macha root. The taste is very similar with more fruit nuances and bready yeast characteristics added into the heavy macha and earthy flavors. A good smooth clean mouth-feel, slightly chewy and a good medium low carbonation level. Overall, this is an interesting beer that brings some flavors out I just don't want in a beer. Macha is not a flavor I would ever seek out in a beer and dirt flavors are best suited to adventures in funk. Not something I will be seeking out again."
"Overall: Not an overly impressive triple and probably not one I would seek out again."
"Taste is delightfully smooth and the alcohol is well hidden under a nice amount of yeasty fruit and liquid bread flavors. Grainy malts and some darker fruits show up a bit as it warms, which is surprising - almost raisiny. Mouthfeel is decently full, but the carbonation is low, which is odd for a tripel. All in all, this is a unique tripel and is pretty good, but lacks in a few areas that is pretty crucial for the style. Easy to finish, but not necessarily craving another one."
"Poured into a tulip. Color is a bright honey gold with a mild white head and not much in the way of retention or lacing. Nose is strange with some cardboard and phenols plus a great deal of slice. Taste falls under the same rubric. Body is off with fairly low carbonation. While the off flavors weren't terribly apparent, when combined with a lack of true character, this just wasn't my favorite brew, especially coming from a brewery whose beers I normally enjoy very much."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, fruit hints and an underlying of candy sugar. In the taste, dry fruit hints and a dry bubblegum like taste. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry bubblegum aftertaste. I kind of feel like I ate a piece of Bazooka Joe, not bad but bubblegum like."
"d- not great drinkability, i wouldn't pick this up again, the metallic tinge was off putting."
"Nice triple ale. Hazy orange appearance. Complex yeasty flavor expected from a triple. The beer was deceptively smooth for 8.5% and it wasn't until a few of these were consumed that this became apparent. Overall it was very good, would definitely have again."
"Light-medium bodied. Not what I originally asked for, but I had no problem finishing it."
"12 ounce bottle, comes with no freshness or bottling info. Pours clouded orange hued amber, under a fairly skimpy light tan head, that leaves scattered lace after a moderate swirl. Fruity nose, then a booze, hot first sip. Yikes, this one is a mess, on the unpleasant side. Unfortunately it lacks the characteristics of a well crafted tripel. Pass this one by, so many other more enjoyable Belgians out there..."
"Sweet and yeasty flavor. Lots of up front alcohol. The yeast is subtler on the tongue. My first thought was barley wine at a far higher abv. The carbonation is quite high--too much for the body. Overall, it's probably easier to grab a true Belgian Tripel, even though this is a decent American version."
"I really like Dark Horse Brewing Company. They make great beer. Unfortunately, Sapient Trip Ale is one of their weaker releases. Perhaps Belgian beer isn't their thing. Frankly, it needs much more of a Belgian yeast presence to succeed. It just doesn't have it. It's not terrible. If you see a single bottle, it's worth a try. But, I wouldn't pick up a six pack."
"An interesting American Tripel - but a little odd. Not as overly sweet and simple as Victory's, its flavors are perhaps strangely balanced."
"MAN. I love tripels, and this one in particular. I tried it back in June but never got around to reviewing it, and then couldn't find it up until now. The mouthfeel really does it for me with this one...I rarely find a beer that I would rate a 5 in anything, but this beer gets a 5 for that. Absolute flavor explosion followed by a smooth, clean rinse."
"D - Not drinkable. Might not be able to reasonably drink more than 1 of these and I don't think I'd want to. Thick, overly sugary, and a maze of flavors which all taste musty and not very fresh."
"Mouthfeel is ok, there's decent body making this medium and the carb is refreshing and zippy. This one goes in the pile with all the other ""something-style"" somethings that really mean ""a poor substitute for"". Just underwhelming."
"This one's pretty good, though I'd prefer more balance, heavier malts presence, and a more effectively masked alcohol presence. That said, I won't shy way from having this again."
"The appearance is cloudy golden color with a thin white head that quickly becomes a faint ring. The smell consists of various spices, yeast, and clove seems to specifically stand out. Taking a sip, the Sapient from Dark Horse tastes vaguely appropriate for the style. The overall taste seems too metallic with a drier aftertaste than I would expect, good idea to have water nearby. Drinkability is average, proper ABV for the style, but not as enjoyable as others produced in Belgium and the U.S. Still, a good beer all in all."
"Overall this is another great brew by Dark Horse and i am glad i picked this one up. I really dont have too much experience with tripels, but this beer may have sparked an interest to explore this style a little more. Keep up the good work Dark Horse."
"The nose is pleasant as is the taste up front, but I just find the lingering flavor to be less than desirable."
"I would definitely buy it again."
"F: Lots of that weird off flavor, with boozy malty wheat and bad bitter flavor. I wish I knew what it was. It also has a creamy flavor, that bad flavor that is. The bitter root earthy flavor just doesn't go away. Perhaps it's a form of diacetyl, with some almost butter popcorn flavor in that weird creamy bitterness. Not a great finish. Some boozy tingly warming alcohol on the finish as well."
"D: Drinkability is good for what it is. It's a tripel, so it's heavy and strong, but it'd be hard to drink a bunch of these in quick succession."
"Not bad. Fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability: It may go down smoothly, but I couldn't incorporate this beer into a feasible diet. It is not for the meek or casual beer drinker, but one who desires strong and unique flavors, and does not mind syrupy-ness."
"D- A slow drinker with lots of complexities to savor."
"Good beer and something I would drink again."
"M- Very dry, thick side of medium body."
"This was my first beer from Dark Horse, I look forward to trying more. This beer started a little slow for me, but by the time I finished I was in love. Great American Tripel, recommended."
"Very pleasant. Highly recommended for those wishing to visit Brussels or Ghent, without leaving the comfort of their living room chair."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid overall; I've had better versions of tripels (La Fin Du Monde comes to mind), but it does the trick. Dark Horse is kind of a hit or miss brewery with me, but this would be on the hit list and I would mind getting some more of this later on and try it from the bottle."
"D - Just too much clove for me to be something I would buy again, if you like cloves and bananas then you will definitely like this."
"I love this beer, it is the first craft brew that I fell head over heels for. It starts a little bitter then turns sweet with a finish that is a nice spice like nutmeg or allspice. The fact that I live 20 miles from the brewery makes life awsome! They have inspired me to get serious about my own beer making. The one draw back is that this beer must be enjoyed draft rather than in the bottle."
"D- Not a bad beer, split a sixer with a good friend and enjoyed the experience, nothing too special about this though"
"Edit: The next 5 bottles in the sixer I bought didn't have that salty thing I mentioned before. Maybe it was my palate and not the beer. So, I enjoyed the next five bottles, but still wish there was a bit more of those classic Belgian flavors. I also wish you could get a better head. You really have to pour hard to get anything going. Anyway, I'm bumping my taste score up a half point."
"D- Fairly easy to drink but just something seems off on this one."
"This beer pours orange light amber and is slightly hazy. The head is minimal, bright white and leaves fairly nice lace. The aroma is sweet, fruity and spicy with plenty of white pepper and some clove, though it is not overpowering. The flavor is quite nice with a very round, fruity malt sweetness that is accentuated by the spicy yeast and soft herbal hops. While not as pronounced as usual for this style, I am definitely picking up some pear and green apple notes. This is a very mild rendition of a triple, but the flavors work well together and I am very much enjoying drinking this. Medium body with a nice soft mouthfeel that could maybe use a bit more carbonation for style, but is pleasant none the less. This is one extremely drinkable triple, and while it may not be exactly to style, I still find it to be a solid offering."
"a bit too much clove, not enough fruit, not enough complexity, but overall not a bad beer by any means."
"So far, everything I've had by Dark Horse has been great or fairly good (this falling into the latter group). Better tripels out there but not always available in a 12oz portion as this is."
"Drinkability: A slightly above average tripel. The spicing is good and hits the mark. However, nothing really jumped out to me about this one."
"M/D: Medium carbonation. Lots of fine carbonation makes for a slicker mouthfeel. Drinkability is okay, I would get sick of this after 2 or so."
"Smells of fruit and spice. The taste is of apple and spice clove. Very good."
"D- I always look for this beer when it comes into season. Nice springtime beer. Could and have drank a sixer of this."
"D: Not up on my list as a session beer due to the 8.5% abv but very enjoyable...will come back for this one later in the summer."
"Drinkability was good, I'd have another. Not La Fin du Monde, but a very respectable tripel."
"Without a doubt this is the most clove I have ever tasted in a beer. The smell was great for the style but upon tasting I was overwhelmed and squinted from the cloves. I love most beers that come from dark horse but this is not on my wish list. i should give it another try but i don't know if i can."
"It's easy to drink once you get past the alcohol, but I think I really needed to have it fresh."
"D - This is a pretty good Tripel from an American brewery. It tastes like an authentic Belgian ale."
"Quite the murky trip ale with a deep bronze/golden body and a bright white head, pretty clouded. Lacing is fine and even carbonation was effervescent and smooth versus most of the recent Dark Horse brews I've had with supper fizzy carbonation. Blasts of sugar and booze, tropical fruit including mango and pineapple. For sure there's a bit of nutty yeast like notes and mild spices. Flavor brings out more tropical fruit content with excellent spicing balance, a bit of alcohol in the finish enough to make it a rough experience slightly fusel. The yeast dough/nut combo is almost like one of those Italian nougat desserts. Not much in the way of an evident hop profile here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly cloying with residual sugars this one has a ton of malt in it, carbonation is better than most of their other offerings still not world class but acceptable. Drinkability is solid an Americanized version of the style one of the better ones in that regards but compared to a Belgian tripel it's hard to compare the two."
"Not sure if a whole lot of love went into this triple. A bigger body and more fruit would have been nice. In the mean time i'll go to my staple of mad bitch and be content. If DH would have named this a saison than I would have been satisfied. A OK attempt that perhaps will be tweaked in the future."
"12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice. A cloudy golden color (possibly unfiltered?) and well carbonated. The overwhelming smell I detect is canned fruit (either peaches or general fruit cocktail), very sweet and syrupy. The taste is actually much more sour, best described as yeasty lemon juice. There's not much of the spiciness found in many tripels. Alcohol is hidden fairly well, but the taste just isn't that pleasant."
"Drinkability? The booze and the mouthfeel are factors here that slow down the session more than should be but seeing that's it's like 12F outside, the significant warming is actually welcomed. A prety good example of the style, overall."
"An okay tripel. I would avoid this one next time. I'll stick to the true belgians as the ones I've had have been outstanding."
"A nice apple cider-ish orange color with minimal white head. Smell is of sugar and alcohol phenols. Some cloves. Taste is fruity, with nice alcoholic notes to it. Apples and spiced rum. Creamy and very effervescent. A somewhat dry finish. Drinkability is fine for that abv, but I probably won't be having it again."
"D: Not the best Belgian but not terrible for an American attempt at the style. Not Dark Horse's best brew by a long shot."
"Dark Horse makes some really good beers... and some not so really good. Sapient Trip Ale is about as bastardized a version of the style as its spelling of it would let on. In all fairness, however, it might have earned (and may deserve) higher scores than the ones posted above if it weren't for the fact that the best examples of this style also just so happen to be some of the best examples of beer, period."
"Some ok hops and flowers, nothing that you would go out and look for."
"D - This triple has come work to do to fix itself a bit but it's close. It also could be a bit old too. The alcohol really hinders it in the drinkability category do to it's high level. It's too off-putting because it dominates everything else. Not a bad beer though."
"Feel and Drinkability: This is one that is easy enough to drink and one that I rather enjoy. Feel is medium-light bodied and works well for what this beer is. Finish is semi-dry and there's a bit of alcohol warmth there. This is one that I'll not hesitate to buy again, however, I'll be going after more tripels before I come back to this one. This is a very good beer, but I'll want to try more before coming back to this one. A solid offering."
"D - pretty good triple, I was very impressed. I really like Dark Horse's stouts, but this is a totally different style. I wasn't expecting something like this from Dark Horse. Well done."
"This beer pours an light amber-orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is orange and lemon zest, and floral funk. It is a nice aroma, but could be a little more forward. The taste is like the aroma, but less prominent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied which I consider way too light for a tripel. Carbonation is also to low for the style. Overall, this tripel leave almost everything to be desired. I can't see myself drinking this again."
"Notes: I am disappointed due to the potential that this beer had. I will take Merry Monks from Weyerbacher any day over this tripel."
"I was happy to see Sapient back on the shelves for the season, it was my introduction to Dark Horse last year. The color is an odd cloudy orange with a white bubbly head that does not retain for to long. The smell is a little boozy with banana bread, raisin, and spice. The flavor is similar with an accent on the spice and a backing of almost bitter alcohol. I could only take a couple of these in a row. I would guess the alcohol with mellow with time. My memory of this beer from last year is a little better than this experience. I will have to lay one down for a little while and see how it is around Christmas."
"Drinkability is respectable. More balanced than some of it's genre, and adequately tasty. Alcohol is present without ever becoming so prominent that you really start dwelling on it."
"It pretty much tastes like it smells and if you enjoy tripels then this one is a good bargan if you can get it for about $10 bones per six pack."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Sometimes, I like the spicy character in tripels, sometimes not so much which this is one of those times but that's just personal since this beer fits the style reasonably well."
"D - I'm iffy on this beer. It's not terribly bad, per se but on the whole it comes off as too murky. It it approachable, just do so with caution."
"Hazy, amber gold with a medium size bubbly white head that recedes to a thin film and streaks of wet lacing. Not sure what's going on with the aroma from this bottle, fairly pungent and sour, strong dark fruitiness, mild alcohol burn, not very pleasant all together. Medium creamy body with sharp carbonation and a mild alcohol finish, though the mouthfeel is much softer and less crisp than I would expect for this style. Flavor is of malt and candy sugar, fruity but again some lingering sourness. I'll have to review this beer again when I get another bottle since this doesn't seem to match other reviews well, but nothing seems obviously ""wrong""."
"Pours a murky golden color with a lot of particulate matter involved. The head was small and faded almost immediatly. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of a lot of spice, malt, and brown sugar. Smells more like a Quad. Some alcohol is also detected. Starts of with a sweet taste but it is fleeting. The spice and malt takeover and dominate the flavor. A little warmth is sensed in the finish. This Tripel is missing the vinous and fruit qualities I love in them. Medium body and nice carbonation goes well with the flavors. Not that good of a Tripel but it is a nice Belgian type beer."
"Murky golden/brown color with about a finger of quickly receding head. Smell is strong spices, caramel, clove, and super sweet dark fruit. Taste is upfront malt overload before the subtle spices kick in to wash it down. No sting or harshness from the spices which I often find to be the case, but there is a bit of an odd lingering cinnamon/nutmeg on the back of the throat. This is very easy drinking, not bigger than medium bodied but there is a slight sense of creaminess. Overall this is a very solid beer that I probably wouldn't buy again simply because it is not a preferred style, but I definitely would recommend it to others."
"Another Dark Horse drinkable treat, this one at Ashley's on-tap. Hazy light golden with Caesar head. Decent yeast aroma. Above average mouthfeel, good fresh yeastiness, and it is fruity,bannana and apricot, with some bitter hop in the finish. A sipper."
"Very good offering from Dark Horse, I will pick this up again."
"Overall, not a bad attempt. It's a good beer, kind of a homebrew tinge to it...but over all decent. I'd like to try this one at the bar."
"pours a hazy straw color with a 1 "" head that leaves a nice fresh ring til the end..the smell is good lots of fruits in this one.. bananas apples pears melons..spices like coriander cumin pepper and cinnamon..the taste is the same as b4 mentioned smell with some sweet malts and belgium yeast tastes that nicely balance the fruit and spice..this is a very good tripel that is well balanced with nothing dominating the palete just a pleasure to drink...i like this one and several other dark horse offerings ..a top notch brewery from michigan..recommended"
"Eric"
"The beer does a lot to immulate what's going on in traditional Belgian tripel ales, but the lack of hop flavor and the richer textures to start are just a few reminders that this is in fact a Belgian-inspired American tripel ale."
"(D)- This is a great representation of the triple style. Its got all the right flavors in the right places. But its still a triple, and thus is indeed a sipper, but a good summer sipper at that. The smell department was very disappointing though."
"Overall, this is a good beer and fairly easy to drink. A bit of alcohol comes across but not enough to make it less drinkable. Overall, a decent tripel."
"12oz. Poured a rusty color with suspended particulates throughout. Thin off-white head left a nice lacing on the glass. Aromas were of over-ripened fruit - apples and pears; maybe some banana. Also some Belgian yeasts on the nose with a hint of alcohol. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and somewhat syrupy. Tastes are over-ripe fruity esters, especially notes of pear with hints of apple as well. Alcohol is present and warming on the throat. Finishes dry with some white grape flavors and some spiciness, white pepper perhaps. Decent tripel and represents the style finely. I just find it very hard to compete with the authentic Belgians. Still very enjoyable none-the-less."
"This beer is one of the worst I have had in a while. I don't care for Belgian Ales to begin with, but this exibits flavors that are pretty offensive. Not recommended, but give it a try if you are feeling brave."
"This was a decent beer. If I want a tripel there are far better examples of the style, but if offered this again, I would gladly drink it."
"D- A nice take on the style. Goes down smooth. Enjoyable."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my tulip glass. The ale appears a clouded dark amber color with barely a finger of off white head that faded with in seconds. Smells and tastes of sweet malt, slightly spicy yeast, candi sugar, tart green apples, honeyed bananas, pepper. A notch better than medium bodied and dry with decent carbonation. Overall, a crisp, fruity tripel."
"D- Goes down pretty well, but the metallic taste puts this one off vs. other tripels. Further, the mouthfeel isn't quite right. Not a bad brew, but nothing special."
"D- With the off flavors and just general mediocrity I'm not sure that I would care to have a second."
"A burnt orange color pour with a thin off-white head that dissipated quickly, light carbonation,spotty lacing. Aroma seemed to be a light citrus zest with banana and some clove spiciness. Flavor is more malty than expected,bready, a little yeasty,some fruit, some grain and cloves, just the right amount of alcohol flavor,dry finish,medium body,medium mouthfeel. Very good brew."
"The Trip Ale has a bright orange haze appearance, with savory creamy top. Thick and delicious. Smells deep wheat sweet. Right of the bat, the texture is robust, yet smooth and flavors subtle. The taste transitions slowly into a slightly sour graininess, with some sweetness. Overall it's a really smooth, drinkable brew. Not too intense on the palate, but a very respectable Tripel."
"Overall, decent but unspectacular."
"Over all a fairly mellow brew, but tasty. I could easily kick back quite a few of these.."
"A: The color and consistency of peach nectar, a minor head on the pour - 3.50, S: Very spicy and floral, some sweet earthiness and clove, a touch on the side of mild but still quite pleasing - 3.75, T: The booze is upfront and a touch aggressive - reminds me ever so slightly like a grain alcohol, a bit on the dry side like, there are also some dried fruit flavor - maybe apricots - 3.50, M: The faintest hint of grittiness that is probably the result of the dryness of the beer - 3.50, D: I do enjoy this beer but I don't think it is one of Dark Horse's better showings when placed side by side to their IPA or Blueberry Stout - 4.00"
"This is merely ok. I don't find the yeast strain all that interesting and as previously mentioned I think it needs to be a tad sweeter. Worth a try, but not something I'd be likely to come back to."
"d- this is really a very tasty beer that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the style- had this @ the brewery and really enjoyed it w. pizza!"
"Overall this was a solid trippel, but there are better ones out there. That being said, I still appreciate ShrLSU giving me the chance to try this."
"I've had my eye on this one for a while, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. My only past experience with a tripel was via the good folks at Chimay, but this one kept me quite intrigued throughout the entire glass. Another solid offering from Dark Horse. Very much worth trying if you can find it in your area."
"This is a decent tripel though probably a bit too sweet for my liking. Still pretty drinkable."
"This is the worst by far of the Dark Horse beers that I had, but it's not horrible by any means and it might be a good introduction to a new style of ale for novice drinkers."
"D: Bitter taste that does not go down easily. Not a beer I would seek out again."
"Conclusion: Dark Horse has an ok beer here, but nothing special. Their true genius lies in their CT and DCT IPAs. For the price, I'd deft. pick up a 4 pack of La Fin Du Monde instead."
"Out of the bottle, I would recommend pouring half, swirling the remaining contents in the bottle, and pouring the rest to get all of the yeast into the glass. I noticed a fair amount of yeast left in the bottle when I did not follow this procedure. Definitely a solid tripel from Dark Horse."
"D- The alcohol is well hidden, helping to make this an easy drinker."
"D- Very drinkable overall good."
"D- Don't like this one much."
"I am enjoying Dark Horse's offerings more and more, luckily they are not that far away."
"D - Killer drinkability! No ABV listed, but I can bet it's pretty high...who cares? I'd still session this one! This is honestly one of the better tripels our there IMO, especially for an American take on the style...I think I'm a sucker for the hops, and the high level of malt sweetness in this one is just the perfect balance for the flavors presented here."
"Pours a dark cloudy gold in color with a slight ring of froth sitting on top. There are a bunch of floating yeasties in the glass. Smell and taste is very yeasty and musty. Taste there is some Pear flavors as well as slight bubblegum. Decent mouthfeel. A little cloying and tiring. I love Dark Horse brewing, but this was a miss for me."
"Overall, I think of this as a near miss on the style, but not a bad beer at all. I'm betting (from my armchair) that a different yeast, and a little wheat could make this good beer into a great beer."
"Poured into my Westmalle chalice, a hazy orange color with yellow around the edges, no foam and very little lacing. Has a powdery cotton-candy aroma with hints of grassiness and light citrus zip. A sweet malty nose to say the least. Plenty of tropical fruit flavors, certainly sweet, notes of licorice, pineapple, pear and light citrus. Some bready malts make their way to the front mid-sip and turns somewhat dry and yeasty on the finish. Not sure what the ABV is, but it's well-hidden as there is not much of a warming effect. Full bodied, almost creamy, not a lot of carbonation going on. Drinkability is on the lower side, as I usually prefer Tripels as a sipper. As I get further into the glass, the alcohol lets itself be known. A nice version of the style."
"Another good beer from Dark Horse Brewing. Keep up the good work."
"Pours hazy orange with thick, fluffy, white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is of a typical Belgian. Some alochol, fruit, and a sweet malt. Taste is good but a bit much on the candi sugar side. Some sweet fruit, malt, and a light grassy and alcohol bite to it. Mouthfeel was nice and a bit on the light side. Overall not a bad beer but not amazing. Something about this was just a little lacking for me. Perhaps it was just a little too much like many others of this style and it didnt stand out."
"I'm not sure what the ABV of this brew is, but watch out. For me, this one was certainly enough. The heavy nature and the strong alcohol content make it deliciously dangerous. This would make a great capper or even an event in itself. The artwork on the bottle is dead-on appropriate."
"edit: I should have been more patient. as this glass warmed, the alcohol bite disappeared, and the beer became much more balanced. as a result I took my taste rating from 2.5 to 4.0."
"Haven't had anything else from Dark Horse, hopefully their other brews shine brighter..."
"Pours a cloudy honey amber color with the thinnest head, no retention and no lacing. Smells of oranges, spices like clove and coriander, bready yeast, banana, and alcohol. Tastes of bubble gum, orange peel, banana, clove, coriander, and bread with a finish of candy, pineapple, alcohol, and a touch of peppery spices. Medium in body with good carbonation despite the lack of head. Smooth and sweet with good bready notes and nice touches of citrus. Very interesting flavors, not my favorite tripel, but not terrible."
"Pours the exact color of honey, head fades really fast leaving some spots of lacing on the glass. Smell is green apples, banana, yeast. Taste follows right along, with a slight burning alcohol taste and a bit of bubblegum. Mouthfeel seems a little thin to me, boozy aftertaste. It's good. I'm not losing my mind over it, but I can see this pairing up nicely with the right meal."
"Drinkability - This is a little off the beaten path of the classic tripel example. Can't say I cared for it too much compared to most Dark Horse stuff. Way too boozy for it to be a revisited beer."
"D- it would be easy enough to have a couple of these even though its pretty strong. an interesting choice for a summer seasonal brew."
"This certainly was my wife's cousins favorite beer of the night. Certainly a well crafted belgium Ale. It poured a cloudy golden color with a very slight head. It was pretty much exactally how a belian ale should taste imo but they are not my favorite so oh well. The smell was nice and the flavors were very deep, I am not sure what the overlying flavor is but its the same flavor from all the other belgian ales I have drank. It is a nice beer to drink I would suggest it to any belgian ale lovers out there."
"This is a struggle to get through. My first impression is fermentation problems... too hot too soon."
"Thanks to iceicebaby for the opportunity to try this one out. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy burnt orange with very little light penetration. Half-inch off-white head dissipated within seconds into a light oily slick; remnants coalesced around the perimeter into a thin band of foam. Nose consists of candy sugar, light fruit and a trace of the alcohol character is revealed, but not at all boozy. Flavors consistent with nose. Perhaps a hint of peach, as well as a subtle spicy character. Mouthfeel is medium bodied in consistency, gravitating slightly towards syrupy, but not unpleasantly so. Also a light effervescence present across the palate and tongue. Alcohol is well-hidden, but packs a punch. I'm two-thirds through and really starting to feel it. Can't wait to try the rest of the line."
"Not a bad Tripel, but not my favorite, either. It lacks the complexity that characterizes Belgian Tripels. Not one to reject outright, but there are much better examples of the style around."
"Drinkability: Has some potential, sure, but as it stands it's not the tripel for me."
"The mouthfeel is creamy but with moderately strong carbonation. Overall this is a pretty drinkable beer but nothing unexpected for an American Belgian-style triple. It's good but just not terribly remarkable."
"overall drinkablity is limited due to abv and how much this demands to be drunk slowly and enjoyed"
"An interesting take on a the style, and definately stronger than most."
"D - Overall, this was one rather tasty tripel that exceeded my expectations. It had a ton of flavor and was easy to drink as well. My one criticism was that the nose did not come close to mirroring the other factors of this beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a bright orange with a slight haze and a thin head of off-white foam. Not much lace. The aroma of the beer was made up of oranges, spicy yeast, and some bread. The flavor was much the same with a more pronounced hoppy citrus note. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with mild carbonation. A pretty decent tripel."
"Sapient Trip Ale is a fine beer overall, but simply nothing great. It's good, but could use some more depth, complexity, and carbonation to up it's status on my Tripel list."
"A gentle beer and tasty too."
"Spicy clove in the flavor, with a big wheaty, yeast-enhanced mouthfeel. Bitter lemon peel. Sweetness is there, but in check. Some phenols tingle the palate. It feels a little heavier than the first time I tried this on tap. Easy to have a couple bottles or drafts."
"Very drinkable with a sweet and fruity flavor profile. No off flavors here. High ABV is concealed. I could go for more complexity in a true Belgian tripel, but this really isn't bad at all."
"Overall a very good American Belgian tripel (which seems to becoming the norm these days) from a brewery I'm very proud to have in the midwest."
"Sapient (adj): having or showing great wisdom or sound judgment. Anyone who is a huge fan of Belgian tripels would show great wisdom and impeccable judgment in choosing Tripel Karmeliet, Gouden Carolus Tripel, St. Bernardus Tripel, De Dolle Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch), or any number of others, before Dark Horse Sapient Trip Ale. Passable at best."
"D: Nice balance of malts, yeast and hops. Pleasant mouth feel and modest ABV. It is an interesting enough Tripel to hold my interest....if only I had a second, third and fourth bottle. I obviously need to get back to the Midwest soon."
"Pours to a hazy , murky straw colored body with tiny bits of sedimet floating around the glass. Head is an almost white inch and a half of fuzzy foam that leaves lots of consistant lace on the glass. Nose is full of sweet floral notes ans spicey vanilla, banana and yeast. As you take first sip you get a syruty battle of thick sweetness and a slight tangy sour spiceyness. There is a smooth creamy feel to the mouth all over created by the yeasty sweetness. Jlavors of mellon, honey, vanilla and softly rich spice makes up a solid palate. This is nicely drinkable but very sweet. Slightly unbalanced feel keeps it from being rated a bit higher."
"D: Kind of a yeasty aftertaste that leaves your mouth a bit sour and pasty, but this beer is good nonetheless."
"Overall Impression: Honey malt and candi sugar taken to the logical conclusion. Good flavors simply done. Good stuff!"
"Cloudy golden color but zip for head. No lacing due to the total lack of a cap on this one. Smell of candied sugar sweetness and belgian yeast spicyness. Sweetness takes the forefront in the taste too. Some citrus fruityness shows itself and a little bit of spice but not enough to balance out the sweetness. I wanted to like this one but it just dosn't hold my interest. The sweetness becomes cloying and drinkability really suffers. A really have no interest in trying this one again."
"This was okay, but I wouldn't get it again."
"Overall, it seemed very flawed to me, while still drinkable, not worth drinking again."
"D: Just another tripel on the market. Not bad."
"Overall, I would probably not grab this brew again. It might be skunked. I guess I could give it a shot however I dont know how much better it would be fresh."
"The mouthfeel is average to solid in respects to the style."
"D: Lacks the complexity of a good Belgian Tripel, yet I found this to be strangely appealing. Quite easy to drink"
"A medium bodied selection with a somewhat heavy, bread-like texture. Moderate carbonation thins out the starchiness a bit. A classic tripel for the most part. Flavorful and well balanced. A very solid selection. Certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability - it's a decent attempt on a Belgian trippel. A few years wouldn't hurt it, maybe mellow it out some and meld the flavors. I gotta be in a mood to drink a high octane brew like this again, but it happens now and then."
"This is a good [American made] representation of the style."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid pale malt scent along with an earthy/fruity Belgian yeast aroma. It appears warm with some sweet malt character. The taste is decent as well. I actually like the taste. It's sweet, yet very smooth with some Belgian fruit esters. It's not very aggressive with an in your face alcohol blast. There is a bit of earthiness in the finish. I feel it's too sweet for the style. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer. I'm just not sure how true to style it really is."
"Overall: pretty solid brew, well made and I like how drinkable it is, but the flavors were not quite as vibrant and enticing as some others in the style. Fruity notes seemed a bit toned back with spicyness taking a front seat."
"Cheers!"
"D- This beer had some nice flavor but not very complex especially for this style. It didn’t really have any sweetness and the bitterness was much stronger than most beers in this style."
"Pours darker than most tripels I've experienced so far, and seems a lot cloudier as well. A dark apple juice color with a shallow white head that's gone in a flash. A little bit of lacing at the end. Smells a little heavier and spicier. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is less carbonated than most also. The texture is on the syrupy side. The flavor is good, spicy and yeasty. I think it's a really nice drinker, but I'm not sure how true style it is. I'm really glad that I was able to experience this one; my second Dark Horse."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange, nice thick white head forms, settles down to a thin layer, nice lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet, nice and malty, grass, bread, citrus, floral/fruity alcohol, bit of yeast, quite nice. Taste is sweet, caramelized, almost a sour/citric tinge, spices, bread, yeast, orange, bit of toast in the finish, touch of alcohol, pretty nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, warmth going down. Maybe not as attenuated as the best tripels, bit thick feeling, but everything else is there, very nice. Thanks Alexa!"
"[Served chilled, in a chalice]."
"Pours a delicious looking orange color, slighlty foggy, with a finger of white head on top that leaves a few trails of lace as it disappears. Looks solid, although it's not quite as puffy and billowy as some tripels. Nose is lots of sweet malt, light corn, strong spiciness as well. Taste is same, just stronger. Sweet citrus, lots of spices on the tip of your tongue, and some light hops that linger on the back. A very sweet beer. Body is solid, medium bodied, with solid carbonation. Even though the alcohol is high (8.5% according to the web site), I think I could go back for a few of these. I think I might be a sucker for tripels, because they never seem to disappoint me (with the possible exception of Golden Monkey). This one goes up there with the Chimay White as a really fantastic beer that I'll look for again."
"This could easily be an obese gooey blob of a tripel, but the persistent, tiny carbonation slakes the mouth, and forms scaffolding that brace the sweetness to give it support and functionality, and create a numbingly drinkable nectar...in the literal sense, as this often seems pollinated rather than brewed."
"D: For a Belgian Tripel this was dangerously easy to consume. Still somewhat on the sweeter side, but still rather tasty. Nicely done."
"Overall a great example of the style. Big and robust but yet very smooth and surprisingly light. Highly recommended."
"Golden-orange hue. Carbonation surfaces at a good clip. Frothy snow white head lasts long and laces nicely. Good aroma of bread and yeast. Warm memories of bread baking in the oven come to mind. Some candy like sweetness too. Impressive flavor. Nice blend of sweetness and yeasty esters and biscuity malt tones. Alcohol presence is perceptible but in no way overbearing. The beer melts away and dissolves softly in the mouth. Light-medium in body. And VERY drinkable. Very enjoyable tripel. One of the better ones I've had in quite some time."
"D - A really nice triple. Dark Horse is getting to be a favorite brewery, and this beer is right in line with that. I gave it a 3.5 because it's not something I would choose to drink often, but it's good."
"Just a plain version of a tripel. It's a little over spiced, like too much corriander and pepper flavors. The malt is too mellow and while it's smooth, there's no depth to the taste. The only redeeming thing about this beer is that it's high alcohol and pretty drinkable."
"Dark Horse's Belgian style Tripel is excellent. Pours a cloudy orange with a nice white head with moderate lace. Smell is fresh fruit with a hint of banana beneath. The taste is satisfying, sweet and complex. Nice smooth yet heavy mouthfeel invites you to ask for a second anda third pour. Highly drinkable with alcohol subtly distinctive in the finish. Pairs well with sausage, burgers and fruit pies. Kudos to a small establishment for creating such a big beer. A real winner from a Michigan stand-out brewery!"
"Pretty good, but not great. Fairly different than most other tripels. Recommended."
"This is the second beer that I have had from Dark Horse and I really think these guys are the real deal! Seek them out if available in your area. As a homebrewer, this is definately a brewery that I would model myself after with pride."
"Taste starts off with sugary fruits, doughy sweetbread, and mellow yeasty soft mouthfeel. Tropical fruits, pear juice, and candied apples. Very nice. Spicy bitterness, with a peppery, yeasty edge into the finish. Could maybe be a little more complex, but still good. Slightly warming, but not boozy at all. Very soft and creamy, full-bodied feel. Exceptional feel with perfect bottle-conditioned carbonation. Dangerously drinkable."
"Originally reviewed on February 9, 2005. Hazed golden pour with a slicked head of whitish. Lemon, tarragon and typical estery belgian yeast aroma. Flavor is bright and effervescent lemon with chewy bread and saccharin candy. Glowing and warm, the 8.6 really shows through. Although, it is quite drinkable, although after half of a pint, it gets a little hard to sup. Cantelope smack. Finish of sweet sugar and grapes."
"Almost feel like I'm drinking a glass of Kool-aid or juice with this, between the honey, lack of alcohol, and no carbonation. Either this take on the style isn't for me, or I got an off bottle. I'll have to try again some day and update if necessary."
"This is a very enjoyable tripel. A light amber body props up a solid frothy head that leaves slight lacing. This beer seems to be almost meady with its honey sweetness. Little spice, perhaps a bit too dry on the end. The alcohol is nice, very drinkable."
"Great tripel color cantaloupe and honey with some orange as well. But,,,, hardly any carbonation, lacing, or bubbling. Doesn't ""look"" like a tripel to me. The aroma is a very sweet fruity and suagry malt. The flavor makes me think of candied apples, honeydew, and cantaloupe. An overall, candy like beer. The palate was ok, but take into consideration the lack of carbonation. This is not a real tripel if you can't feel the carbonation."
"D - I won't get it again. It's far too sweet for the style, imo."
"This is the first of any of the Dark Horse brews that I have had. To say the least I am impressed! This is a very interesting Belgian Trippel that I would buy again!"
"Barlafumble! This acopon is acclumsid enough to cause a reelpot to break one's Steven. Givel and glop some bellytimber lest ye quop and paggle. Five eggs to you fleaks and fizgigs! I am merely a erendrake here to fage thy farnets. Hadavist a kidliwink and a kill-priest were so enjoyable I'd not been a kexy and mulwined meself more often. Merry-go-down! Don't misgloze thee it's a slibber-sauce to lovedrury while snapsaucing. Uh huh."
"Poured out into a pint glass, beer is a hazy peachy gold color with a sparkly white head that quickly settles to a thin rim. Lacing is good, and slides down the glass with the beer. Smell is of spice and cloves. Taste is initially of hops, but is quickly overpowered with a banana-caramel malt taste. Aftertaste is good and lasting, definitely of malt and a slight tinge of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very good, a light bodied beer with excellent carbonation; it dances on the tongue and finishes smooth. This beer is a good tasting beer, but I'm not sure I could drink too many of them in one night. I would recommend this beer as a nightcap."
"I'd say the drinkability is better than 'good'"
"Pours out a cloudy dark honey color with big white creamy head. Big, drippy lacing. Smells are hefe-like phenols, alcohol, honey, and a very faint spice. This is a very light and fresh tasting beer. Honey, berry, fig, sugar, peppery spice , grassy flavor and tart alcohol come out more or less in that order. Mouthfeel is mid-bodied with very active but really teeny-tiny carbonation bubbles that give it an over-all fuzziness. May come off a little flimsy compared to its begian couterparts but for the price difference it is well worth considering."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, sugary, medium bodied, and warming."
"Overall impression: Nicely done. Not the typical punch-in-your-face yeasty trippel. Seemed very balanced and accented the ripe fruit characters well. Another good offering from a solid brewery."
"No thank you."
"The mouthfeel is full and syrupy. Needs a bit more dryness. Definitely needs something to balance out the banana as well, or at least less of it. Drinkable, but could be much better. This is the weakest of the Dark Horse beers my roommate brought back from MI."
"This bottle had to have been aged over two years. It was old when I got it and I've had it forever. Aside from that, I can't wonder where all the MOR reviews are coming from. This is an exceptional American-Belgian!"
"Light copper color with short white head. Odor is of spices and alcohol. Taste is not super strong. some sourness. lots of alcohol evident. i actually like it because most tripels are too spicey/strong for my taste. A vaguely malty finish. good, pretty smooth mouthfeel. alcohol hits hard. This has got to be above 6-7%. good drinkability, i would recommend it."
"Overall impression: Individually all the traits of this beer seem good, but when you add it all up it comes up a bit short. Nothing particular, it just didn't strike me as a great example of the style. Still tasty, but not great."
" Taste is OK. Not Belgian enough for me. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, which is good for this beer, I think. Drinkability is average."
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing to get excited and run to the store about. A nice offering, especially among a limited selection."
"The medium-body is smooth and enjoyable, but what detracts from the beer's drinakbility is its sweetness. A noble, though slightly flawed effort at a difficult style from Dark Horse. This is certainly worth trying if you happen to come across it, but probably not worth adding to a list of must-trys."
"The mouth is full with the citric notes and carbonation cutting through and washing everything clean. A solid Triple, I could drink a sixer over the course of a night."
"Taste; yeasty bread dough, as with the nose the bananas and cloves really come through, and it has a bit of a citrus zing to it. Slightly sweet on the finish, with just a touch of bitterness. This was much better than I had anticipated. Mouthfeel was was full, and just a bit syrupy. Really good beer."
"A good place to start when getting into Tripels, Dark Horse has got this one down. Poured out to a slightly hazy rich yellow golden color wiht an nice 1/2 inch head. No lace noted. Medium carbonation. Aromas could have been stronger, but hints of zesty yeast and weak hops were noted. The taste was complex and very well balanced. Flavors of buttery biscuts, malt, yeast and some citrus notes meshed very well. Finished crisp and a bit dry. Quite sweet all around. Good drinkability, this would go well with many meals, or just fine on its own. Recommended."
"This beer finishes a bit heavy, but it is clean and very quaffable. I like it, I would buy it again. I would like it more, with its sweetness, if it had a more pronounced yeast character to go with it. It's nice to see D. Horse stray from the British Iles."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Overall this is an eminently flavorful and very sippable beer. It carries enough bite to be substantal and is definately a 'dark horse' among American brewed Belgians."
"Pours a deep gold/light copper with w quite persistent 1/2 inch white head. Aroma is a mixture of tropical fruits, coriander, and pepper, quite a lovely smelling brew. Flavor doesn't have quite the depth that the aroma would suggest, beginning slightly sweet, then finishing with some light fruit and spice notes. As it warmed a bit, the flavor began to take a little more shape. Has a medium body with medium carbonation... quite smooth actually. Overall this is a pretty good Tripel... pretty much right on for the style."
"The taste and feel of this beer run together to deliver a smooth and delicious treat. Well drinkable density in body. The spice factor is just perfect here. No over""beering"" attributes to the flavour. In my estimation this is right up there with the Chambly stock. Delightful and soothing. Brilliant sweetness that never becomes a burden. The flavours dance across the palate, creating a crisp brunt and a welcome afterglow of sweetness. The spice character that so often over-emphasizes the Belgian style is tuned to precision here. I love it when a beer I hypothesize to be be ""not my cup of tea"" turns out to be an absolute pleasure to consume. Fine craftsmanship Darkhorse!"
"Thanks to Hopdog for a great trading experience."
"I highly recommend."
"Nice a drinkable and I will buy again when in Indiana."
"In general, I would say this beer is decent, but I expect great things from Belgian style beers, and for my money this isn't even the best example of the breed from Michigan (Dragonmead's Final Absolution). Worth a try, but I probably won't pick this one up again."
"This is a good beer worth trying, but I am not going to stock up on it... By the way, my wife has said I am nuts, it does not smell like hot dogs."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden color. Somewhat phenolic aroma-spicy and malty as well. Theres obviously something to this beer. Big, bold spicy flavor upfront. A tad bready. Malty with a lingering sweetness. The spiciness is great here. Cloves and coriander. Mouthfeel is very appropriate-not overly syrupy or sweet as some US examples are. A definate asset to the US triples out there. This has to be the best US interpretation I have had so far. Well worth seeking out. Thanks again to eyedrinkale. Killer trade..."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a frothy white head. Extreme effervescence is noted. Aroma of bananas, yeast, and alcohol. High carbonation is prickly on the tongue. Bitter lemons balance with sweet bananas and candy sugar. Lots of clove and other spices come in fighting. Spicy hops and alcohol cap off the flavor. The brisk carbonation breaks up what would otherwise be quite a thick mouthfeel. Good American take on the tripel."
"I have to say that is an interesting label on this beer and the beer inside is just as interesting.Pours a deep hazy dark yellow with some orange tint with a big fluffy head that leaves nice lace behind,big yeasty aromas very spicey and clovey with a splash of tropical fruit.Flavors as well in this beer are dominated by big yeasty notes,cloves and apple are very noticable with a touch of alcohol as it warms a little.A good stab at the style maybe could have a little more fruitiness but pretty damn good."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours a hazy medium gold with a huge head that lasted forever with great lace. Great wheat malt aromas with some citrus and banana notes. Tripple flavors abound. Cross a hefe with with a strong english ale and you get this. First sip gives the appearance of a hefe but it immedately fades into the fruityness that tripples are known for. Nice hop presence also, not sipcy at all just a nice presence. Due to it's complexity it lowers the drinkability, that is to say you can't drink a bunch of them. A very nice beer."
"I have to disagree with one reviewer's belief that this is a fairly low ABV beer...I was feeling woozy about halfway through."
"this was #99 on my ratebeer site thought I would finish with 2 mich. beers. poured cloudy yellow gold with a medium sized head. aroma, citrus, yeast, some sweetness, fruity.flavor fruity sweet like pineapple and hints of orange.I would buy this beer again"
"I wonder if this might benefit from aging. It costs about 8-9 bucks a sixer. I should try it. I finished this beer with my dinner of omelet and toast. My conclusion is that this would make a great breakfast beer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" of white head over the cloudy honey amber hued brew. Head is short-lived, but returns upon swirling, and laces well. Aroma is sweet, wheaty, lightly fruity, and alcohol presence is apparent. Taste is everything the nose portends it to be, which is great. Seems more generic bitterness than hops character. Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability, well, I'd be looking for another, if I had one. Another Dark Horse to be rooting for..."
"Thanks, TikiGod!"
"I'm glad I was able to try this brew."
"Hazy copper colored, murky body with a thin white film of head. Sweet bublegum and spice aroma. Flavor is sweet and fruity. Just a touch of bitterness and sour in the finish. Theres a tanginess and brisk carbonation that keeps the mouthfeel light. There were a couple very slight off flavors, but nothing to keep it from being a good beer. I'll definatly try it again."
"I could tell this wasn't from Belgium (more spices, too sweet not as dry) but I don't really care."
"Thank you to trbeer for the gift to take home. Well, all I can say is that this is an outstanding tripel!! Maybe those who prefer it on the drier side wouldn't like this one, but since I like that candi sugar sweetness, I'm loving this one. I'm just upset that I heard that Dark Horse was coming to Pittsburgh, but I confirmed with Aaron at the Summer Beer Festival that event was far away (which is a shame, since Dark Horse is an amazing brewery). Still, I'll be enjoying this beer whenever I get the chance."
"Sampled from a 2L growler. Poured a clear orangish yellow with a thin off-white head. Candied sugar on the nose with some tropical fruits & spice. Flavors of butterscotch, banana, pineapple, and spicy yeast. Very syrupy in the mouth & finishes leaving you with a long lasting flavor of sweet candy, fruit, & licorice. Definitely a unique version & worth trying."
"I am floored. One of the best Trippels I've ever had, let alone the best tripel in Michigan. This reminds me in many ways of Unibroue 10 or 11...it's that good or better. Perfectly drinkable, satisfying, complex, rich...what can I say? Do yourself a favor and try this! Highly recommended."
"This little brewery is a hidden gem. Get on board and try their beers if you can get the chance."
"Hard to drink to much of this, more of a strong sipping beer."
"What a great American tripel. I think I may prefer Great Lakes Brewing Anniversary Ale, but this beats my beloved Bell's Sparkling Ale hands down. Pours a cloudy, honey and mango color with a nice lace rim. Smells . . . like fresh spring air. There's no real character but freshness, perhaps after a rain. Nicely carbonated, fizzy and spunky that you don't taste actual flavors until swallowing. At first, I thought I perceived an orange honey, yeast, and tangelo flavor. But as I began to write the review, I swiped a drink without concentrating and epiphany! This tastes like a malolactic, not over-oaked California style chardonnay with a yeast and malt twist. The very final note of flavor is in the aftertaste: bitter, but understated."
"On the palate it is sweet and juicy with pulpy, plump red apple flesh, tangerine, hot electrical wires and powdered sugar. There is a naiive candied sweetness to this beer that prevents it from acheiving much better than average drinkability,"
