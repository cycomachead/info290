A bit more aroma would've been nice too. Props to a domestic brewery though for puttin out a Belgian. We need more of these.","irishguybeer86","Sep 13, 2014"

There is sweetness and breadiness from the malt with some back end bitterness and spiciness. The alcohol is detectable in the taste. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation.

Tangy citrus orange up front that immediately transitions to banana that carries through to almost the finish. Strong musty belgian yeast flavor from beginning to end.

The mouthfeel is well carboanted. Overall it is a solid beer but not the top of the glass. The spiciness of the taste brought a nice balance to the beer.

First taste is a lightly spiced Belgian wheat with yeast, some of that clove and citrus previously mentioned, banana, and some light flavors that are escaping me at the moment. Finishes sweet and a little thick, a little lingering citrus and spice. Carbonation lightens the body to medium-ish, otherwise it would be a thick and chewy texture. The amount of yeast floating around was a little surprising, and it doesn't really settle out, but that's not really a hindrance. Easy to drink, and hides its ABV dangerously well. Doesn't taste quite as mature as your typical triple, but still delicious. This has become one of my more regular purchases.","Thanby","Dec 05, 2010"

There is a flowery ginger quality to the beer as well, but the sweetness and the too pronounced ABV do diminish this beer and its potential.

This is a good tasting version of a tripel... very yeasty with lots of esters, a nice warming alcohol sensation, and a tart/crisp finish. By no means the best tripel out there... but not bad.

It has a nice medium-heavy body with a slight oily quality with plenty of fine carbonation. But this stuff is just to heavy on the alcohol dominance for my tastes. I lose the other qualities. It's probably more my aversion to the style than to the brewer here but I am not into this. Not at all drinkable, as far as having more than one although the flavor becomes a little more refined as your taste buds try to adjust to the alcohol bashing.

This doesn't smell like a tripel; it smells more like an English barleywine. On the palate, thick and sweet initially, although some hops do come up toward the mid-palate and stay into the finish. The light sweetness of pale Belgian malts is replaced with thick, graham-and-honey elements more befitting a barleywine than a triple. Overall, this is a poor example of a tripel. It's too dark, too sweet, not bitter enough, and has some odd fruit notes. Style isn't everything of course, but I don't see how you can call this a tripel under any circumstances.

There a certain hints of banana and caramel in the nose. Some presence of pale malt and a strong dough like yeast scent. Quite a complexity of fruit tones mixed in. Taste is smooth and mild. Lots of banana up front with a mild tone of yeast and a hop mix in the aftertaste. Very dough like, hides the alcohol rather well with no real strong over powering alcohol flavor. Very enjoyable with lots of changing flavors tones of plum and raisin mild caramel and lots of other essence. Maybe some light lemon hints. Quite drinkable but still can take some getting used to the flavor. Not for everyone's pallet. Still packs quite a punch form the ABV.","bigone4","Jan 07, 2007"

Pleasant, fruity aromas of apricot, pear, green apple are dominant with some notes of spices, malts and banana lingering in the background. Mouthfeel was disappointingly flat and sticky for a Belgian-style Triple. One would expect a much more lively level of carbonation for this style. Flavor was quite authentic to style revealing sweet, ripe fruit, caramel malt, spices and a touch of pepper, lemon juice and a restrained hop bitterness which kept the sugary sweetness in check. An admirable attempt at the style, but if Im in the mood for a Triple Id prefer the real deal from Belgium over this anyday.","macster","Jan 05, 2007"

3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Marginal foam in pour. Fruity golden colour a la peche/.apricot. Yeasty fruity aroma. Smooth drink, well balanced. Fruit yeasty taste, but also drying metallic. Light carbonation, some spice and banana. Alcohol kicked in prematurely, but a good sleep on a hot summer night. A good effort.","Sammy","Jun 09, 2005"
3.4,-7.9,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a mily-orange brew with a modest white head. It presents a yeasty, slightly tart aroma, with a bit of yeast in the background. Theres a little tart, citrusy-reminiscent fruit in the smell as well. Fleeting phenols and a distant funky aroma are also thrown in the mix. Its not a very sweet brew, but instead presents an almost medicinal flavor. Slightly harsh, and notably alcoholic in taste. Its got a nice, heavy body, with a moderate to low carbonation and a solid hop finish. All in all, I really expected more from this brewery. The beers good qualities are not folded into the experience, and the unfavorable ones are too pronounced. I really appreciate the drinkabilty and how the brew is satisfyingly full and smooth. It just doesnt come together as a singularly flavorful and complex beer.","Suds","Jun 08, 2005"

3.75,1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4," A noble attempt at the style, and a drinkable drink, but nothing to jump up and whoop about, really. Keep on trying...needs something more elevating, more ethereal, more unexpected...to really rank as a tripel.","feloniousmonk","Apr 24, 2005"
3.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"With considered attention to the pour, a good film of multi-sized bubbles covers the offering and has a medium stick throughout the libation. Hue is deep gold and hazy orange with a not insubstantial amount of continuous action. Tart lemon/lime, coriander, and lemongrass on nose. Cloves and light cinnamon on mouth initially followed by a tinny characteristic that detracts; malt is very full and nice though. Almost a velvetiness to this which makes it more than medium-bodied. Pretty good Belgian-style ale.","Truh","Apr 02, 2005"
4.49,21.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Taste is a horse kicking me in the kidneys. In a good way. Everything from the nose, plus a potent alcohol, esthery near-graininess. Sweet and pungent. Very heavy, thick, fruity. Good consistency and cloys just enough to make you want to drink faster than is advisable. Sticky in the mouth and on the lips. Very very nice. Excellent drink with which to start a night of boozing or to have after dinner, to my taste.","cooter","Feb 21, 2005"
3.58,-3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A sip of this beer brings on many of the tastes of a Tripel  plenty of yeastiness, clove spice, and banana backed up by a weak hop background. The alcohol taste is quite prevalent, and the hop characteristic is simply a background player. This causes a bit of unbalance, but nothing horrible. The mouthfeel is quite nice, a syrupy thickness combined with spot on effervescence.","foXXtail","Feb 02, 2005"
3.4,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"12 ouncer sampled w/o any freshness dating to be found. Pours a cloudy orangy light amber, minimal white head and minor lacing left on the glass. Strong nose of alcohol, paint thinner. This one is a fairly nasty brew with overpowering notes of hot alcohol. Heavy thick bodied, not very pleasant stuff. A healthy dose of nutty yeast on the botom of the bottle did add a softer layer to the finish., For a tripel lover this was quite a let down, obviously finer tripels are out there.","Billolick","Jan 28, 2005"
3.67,-0.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"It came served in a Chimay goblet, with a thick, foamy white head that slowly subsided, leaving behind a wispy head in its wake. It had a very sweet nose. It was a clear, light amber liquid without a lot of carbonation in evidence. It had a medium mouthfeel with a very sweet finish. Had I had more time, I would certainly have ordered another.","woodychandler","Jan 26, 2005"
1.67,-54.7,3.5,1.5,1.5,3,1,"EDIT: Now that some of the CO2 has faded, it IS cloying. This triple has moved from "not bad" to bad in a hurry. Looks like a dumper. If you are going to try this beer drink it quickly.","krberg","Jan 25, 2005"
3.53,-4.3,4.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Definately one of the more interesting looking brews I have seen before. It was a cloudy cream color with a white head. The beer was so cloudy, I couldn't see through it. The head was fluffy and white, lasted only a short a while. The taste was a little bit on the hoppy side, when compared to other Triples I've had. It was also a little too strong in the alcohol department. Overall an interesting brew. I'd like to see how this one would do after being set aside for a short while.","JISurfer","Jan 14, 2005"
3.26,-11.7,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Not all that bad, but this Tripel seems to lack some balance, thus the alcohol is allowed to be the more dominant character. I would have preferred a bit more hop character and dryness, less sweetness, and a sneaking alcohol.","Todd","Jan 10, 2005"
4.12,11.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured a nice orange color with a fluffy white head that quickly fell and left some lacing. The smell was of belgian candi sugar, and some spices. The taste was of candy, oranges, spices, and a touch of alcoholic warming and hoppy bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was full bodied and well carbonated. This was a pretty good beer. Lots of flavor and fairly complex, I would have no problem drinking more of this.","soulfly967","Jan 10, 2005"
4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark orange color with a puffy, white head. Very striking color. The nose had a wonderful fruity character, full of juicy peach and orange peel citrus with a sweet syrupy undertone. The flavor was tart and flavorful with a nice yeasty baked note coupled with a warming alcohol distinction and a creamsicle finish. Nice zesty mouthfeel. Another big beer from Stoudt's that impressed me.","GreatPondBrewer","Dec 20, 2004"
3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: I like this example, it seems to have an aire about it that makes it special, and perhaps even different than any other beer out there. It certainly doesn't compare to the Belgians, but it does offer up a nice spin on this classic style of beer. I'd be interested to see how these age, especially with the huge amount of sludge put in to conjure the bottle conditioning. Overall, a pretty nice beer. Very satisfying, as if made for a chill evening. One note: when I poured the 1/2" I let in the bottle down the sink, it oozed out and was the color of a cappucino. Quite the yeast-beast.","99bottles","Dec 06, 2004"
4.02,8.9,4,4.5,4,3,4,"Pours a hazy orange color with a thin tan head. Leaves little lacing anywhere. On the nose it is initally malts, with fruit background. A tiny trace of hops come through. Quite a sniffer. Tastes fruity as can be, with a very tart, citrus appeal. A little too tart on the finish though, not as well rounded as the 750ml version. Feels too carbonated and light in the mouth. Just an average mouthfeel though, not too bad. Needs to be a bit chewier. When it's all said and done, this is a very solid Tripel. The 750ml version is a little better. As for most of Stoudt's beers, it's a consistent and very good beer. But, again as with all Stoudt's beers, it's nothing unique or spectacular. Try it anyways, you'll probably like it.","santoslhalper","Nov 30, 2004"
4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 oz. bottle. poured out a nice cloudy orange color with a stiff white head. The smell was malty and sweet. The taste was good. Very bready with a banana like taste. Noticeable alcohol in the taste. Hops well balanced. The mouthfeel was rich but not thick and well carbonated. The drinkability was good.","heidelbeerg","Nov 29, 2004"
3.28,-11.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Smelled of sweet malt and wheat. I would describe the color as a lighter shade of pumpkin which was topped off by a bright white head. Mouthfeel was full-bodied with tight, abrasive bubbles. Taste was complex and spicy with sugary notes of banana, as well as a surpising hop bitterness. Not a very unique interpretation of the style, but a solid representation.","tenant","Nov 24, 2004"
