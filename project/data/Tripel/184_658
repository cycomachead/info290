Smells of bread dough and honey. The taste is bready with a quick whack of cinnamon. Does cinnamon come in whacks? There is also a slight earthy flavor, with a really nice aftertaste that just makes you want to have another sip. It is a straightforward tripel, not like the Westmalle, but very refreshing. The mouthfeel is spot on, tingly and buttery. Overall, I like this beer quite a bit. It is very good in a very simple way. I've been called worse, so I imagine the monks would be OK with that description.","roblowther","Mar 19, 2014"

A rather unique color, a clear brownish yellow that somehow manages to fall right between my conceptualizations of ""light"" and ""dark", almost a translucent butterscotch hue. Aroma was sweet, fruity, floral, and moderately spicy, some of those classic Belgian esters and phenols are certainly present but are less aggressive than with many other tripels. I get some caramel, yogurt, baked pear, sweet citrus fruit, peach, plum, banana, and clove elements, on the nose and the palate. The malts are pound cake sweet and the hops (or yeast?) yield some floral chamomile and tobacco notes. Semi-aggressive carbonation and the alcohol does peak through near the end of the experience. More smooth, more mellow, and less boozy than other tripels I've tried and I appreciate the subtlety and near-creamy mouthfeel, although thankfully you won't forgot you're drinking a Belgian style ale.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 27, 2014"

Others find tripel's deceptively light, but I found that the smooth mouthfeel really made this one feel heavier on the tongue than you would assume from the color. The head also stuck around a lot longer than I'd expect from something with 8% ABV. Overall, a great beer, and one I would get again. Look forward to trying more tripels.","Beric","Sep 14, 2013"

Some slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, pear, apricot, grape, candi sugar, biscuit, honey, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas, with good strength and complexity. Taste of big lemon, grape, pepper, pear, apricot, clove, candi sugar, bread, coriander, banana, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of grape, pear, lemon, coriander, pepper, clove, and big yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great balanced flavor profile of sweetness with spicy character; and no cloying sweetness at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick and prickly mouthfeel as expected for the style. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all on the finish.

The La Trappe is cloudy, and has a straw yellow color, with a hint of red if held up to the light. There is an aroma, but it is subtle. So far, not outstanding, but take a sip. The La Trappe is clean and crisp, very champagne like at the start, and staying light and flavorful to the end. This is a great tripel for newcomers and beer advocates alike.","iSip","Mar 29, 2012"

Big alcohol, nice twinge of lemony hop bitterness, and malt body full of character, roasted, peaty, and lightly sweet. Delicate balance for a powerful ale. Medium bodied and a drying finish.

Fluffy and somewhat sticky/dense walls of lace. Nose is mildly yeast, green apple, raw pear. Some bruised banana phenolics. Quite dry, not showing alot of sweetness. Taste is a caramelly-green apple, pear again and some yeastiness. Some fusel alcohol along with a peppery spice in the midmouth., which continues into the finish. Mild dryness and some stickiness. High carbonation and with a lot more caramel-like malt body than most other tripels I've had. Warming and nice overall, but something I'm more accustomed to having in the cooler months, although not completely inappropriate for the heat here now.","liamt07","Jun 05, 2011"
3.38,-14.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from bomber into a snifter glass. Pours hazy orange/amber color with a medium sized bright beige head along with decent lacing throughout. Aroma is yeasty and sweet with notes of dried fruit, pomerans, clove, some almond paste and spice. Taste is thick and candyish yeasty sweet (caramel) with citrus, fermented apples, coriander and spice. Sweet, yeasty, acidic and spicy without much bitterness. Body is first sweet and big just to falter a bit towards the end, in other words, flattening. Carbonation is quite smooth and tickeling. Too simple and underwhelming of a tripel for me.","CuriousMonk","Jun 05, 2011"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a golden body a little bit of head. A standard Belgian aroma as I pick up touches of sharp citric/banana/orange and yeast as well as something tropical like pear. Also some clove/pepper and a good touch of sugary sweetness. Sharp and lively, the taste kicks off with a touch of funk but then this light to medium bodied brew goes down smooth and filling thanks to the yeast. Other flavor notes include citric lemon zest, apple or pear notes, some spice, as well as caramel and sugary malt goodness. The ABV is about right as the beer has a little kick but not overpowering, enabling both the fruit and malt tastes to balance and come out and finishing easy.","clayrock81","Jun 02, 2011"

3.51,-10.9,3.5,2.5,4,3,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This came as a nice surprise after the aroma fell a bit flat.

It pours a cloudy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, pepper, Belgian yeast, and lemon zest. The taste holds notes of wheat, clove, pepper, Belgian yeast, and orange peel. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid tripel, but not as strong as other similar offerings.

I took care in the pour to avoid getting a bunch of yeast into the beer, so there's little to no head on this one. Nice carbonation levels, it bubbles like a sparkling champagne or something similar. Kind of a hazy appearance, with a really nice amber color that reminds me of sun tea. Initial impressions of the aroma is that it's much more ""beer-y"" than I was expecting. I get grain and malt, almost like a basic amber ale. That doesn't last long though. The second sniff hits with you with that classic Belgian estery sweetness. I get green apples and dried apricots in the nose. First taste is rich with an almost velvety mouthfeel. It's a heavy beer, with lots of dark toffee malt sweetness chased by warm fruits. You get a warm rush of alcohol in the finish. This beer shines in the finish. I haven't had a beer with this kind of aftertaste. It's like the opposite of hoppy. There's just this huge brown sugar and roasted cereal finish that's quite delicious. The alcohol level prevents this beer from being anything more than a special occasion, but there's no denying it's doing something right. Very solid example of a Belgian Trippel.

The aroma was light for a triple (?!), sugary malts, vanilla, caramel and some molasses. The flavors were a pleasant yet understated blend of caramel, sugars, spices, vanilla, nuts and a grip of alcohol heat that led to the dry finish.

A second whiff reveals some oranges, apples, grapefruits and phenols. Tastes obviously malty up front with some bananas, butterscotch, taffy, spices and a faint bitterness to fruition. Mouth-feel is rich, creamy and almost full-bodied, but not quite. There's a definite alcohol heat on the way down, and I'm lovin' it.

The beautiful orange/copper appearance and spicy aroma were good omens and to my surprise, the taste was not as massive as I expected for 8% ABV. The malt is pronounced but not dominant and there was a nice spiciness from the coriander and banana cake notes.

Good, rich, creamy mouthfeel with relatively easy drinkability, even for an 8% ABV... Definitely recommended...

The mouthfeel is good, balanced between moderately carbonated and a tad syrupy smooth, making this all in all a very good Tripel well worth buying.

Pear fruits come toward the end, along with a bubble-gum and clove combination. Mouthfeel is just medium, with sharp carbonation -- typical for the style.

To the fore of the scent are juice cut pear, plum and apple esters supported by a mix of banana and apricot. Hints of spice maybe coriander, clove and a slight yeast character. Taste wise this strike me as rather creamy, with lots of smooth esters jumping on the flavor ride. All the same fruits come into play, I get the pear and plum, with yeasty notes, a touch of coriander and a noticeable bit of carbonation. Hops as expected are not really noticeable, they just provide support for the esters and malts. This is tasty as far as I am concerned, its not my favorite tripel, but its got some of the character of my favorite tipels, and its lands just under being cloying.

Tasted strongly of butterscotch, caramel, and bananas, with a nice smooth finish. It has a surprisely light mouthfeel for such a rich beer, and was dangerously drinkable.

Closer sniffing reveals clove, and a hint off-key mustiness that makes me think I may have let this one sit just a little too long. Beautiful carbonation - the tiny champagne bubbles just keep on coming. Buttery, creamy body is as close to perfection as I can imagine. Palate holds light, sweet fruit, brown sugar, bubble gum, and a hint of amaretto. Nice, sweet finish, with very little aftertaste.

Smell is a subdued mellow mix of very dulled melons and lemon with some yeasty grab and a nice spicyness and alcoholic warmth over lays. Taste is quite quenchingly yummy and mellowing. Nice mild citrus of dullish lemon, melons, and dried orange and apricot all have a certain impressionable mix and lightly souring tartness kick thats mostly upfront. Hops add to the boost some, then it begins to fade some as it reaches farther past midway. Just after midway it mellows out with some spicyness and lingering lightly into the finish with some malty chewyness and more dulled citrus mix. Solid medium body feel with some creamyness at first, picking up a small surge on its way to a mellowing smooth and lightly chewy sweet finish. Not overly complex but very enjoyable, a nice drinkable thickness and lush feeling as it begins to warm after half a glass or so.

The aroma displays a clean, lightly honeyish malt that's accentuated by a light fruitiness and gently floral background hops. In the mouth it's creamy and smooth with a very fine, restrained, natural carbonation and solidly medium body. Delicate, sweetish malt dominates the flavor, but gives a burst of light fruit at the swallow. It finishes surprisingly dry considering the candyish malt, with a low-key bitterness and some grassy hop flavor becoming evident. It's exceptionally well balanced and quite enjoyable, though it lacks a little bit of complexity. Still, it's well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jul 22, 2003"

After the complex smell I was ready for a complex taste but no such luck. The taste was rather bland with none of the aromas really jumping out in the taste. I guess the most notable flavor is the hops. Sort of a grassy bittery taste but this beer isn't totally without any malt flavors. The aftertase leaves a sort of sugary taste in the mouth.

Honey laced sweetness in aroma combined with mild notes of pear, and unripe citrus. Undertones of banana esters and clove. Hint of peppery alcohol. Clove is more pronounced in flavor, but remains pleasantly mild. It couples with residual sugars to lend an herbally sweet impression that briefly lingers. Notes of black licorice and cidery tartness emerge mid palate. Understated hop bitterness leaves the flavor profile skewed towards malt sweetness, which unfortunately consists of seemingly simple residual sugars-- almost one dimensional in overall malt character. Lightly bodied and a touch thin in mouthfeel, but this helps lend a deceiving lightness on the palate. Finishes w/ notes of white bread sweetness, but otherwise clean.
