"O - Looks and smeel of this one are only slightly above average for the style low head retention is a slight problem but the taste and Mouth feel help to keep it up there. Overall the balance is good."

""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is rich, spicy, a little sweet and great!!!  A must have for Tripel lovers."
""

"Medium body, high stingy carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Overall a fresh and crisp sipping beer, hiding its strength well."

"Pours a slightly hazy gold with two fingers of dense white foam, thick sheet of lace for a couple of inches down. Smell: some ""import grain"" character which faded quickly, then... pilsy, floral, white grapes, candied lemon peel note. Taste: sugar cookie, overripe pear, sugared dried apricot blip, lemon-pepper and some citric bite. Really fine, velvety feel, finishing drying with grassy hopping punching through a sugary base. Best by 12/15. Pretty good."

"O - I like the flavor and aroma, which are appealing and well balanced.  Definitely a flavor profile I enjoy.  I'll definitely try this again and hope for less carbonation."

"Had a nice crackery, doughy sweetness, and was dry and crisp through and through. Had lots of tropical fruit, with white grape skin, apple, pear and some peppery spice. At the finish there was a healthy amount of spicy, yeasty notes. Really nice, yes indeed! Zum Wohl!!"

"Pour into a brandy glass (no I don’t have a glass for each brewery). Large fluffy head about 3 inches that dissipates well at room temp 65F to a thin layer. Smells like daisies, herbs, honey…mead, lemongrass. It looks golden, golden ale, see through, like if the rivers were made of gold, it should look like this. Tastes like what an amazing beer should taste like. An explosion of flavors, medium carbonation then low at room temp. A balance of flavor and alcohol. Not a lot of bitterness. An aftertaste that makes you want more. Win"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy, caramel orange with a massive coarse white head that dissipated quickly to a more persistant thick cap with great lacing. A bit of a gusher, lost a quarter of the bottle, but managed to save most of this nectar. Great aroma of bready malt, Belgian yeast and spicing and nicely balanced light and stone fruit. Flavor follows with excellent mixed light and stone fruit, bready malt, nice strain of Belgian yeast, clove and coriander. Flavor reserved but nearly perfect. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A classic Belgian ale, leaning more towards a dubbel than a tripel, but just what it claims to be, a Belgian blond ale. After a week of some pretty big ales, its nice to return to something a bit reserved but beautifully balanced and flavorful. An excellent Trappist ale deserving its reputation."

"OK but not exceptional. Looks nice, and the aroma is a lovely blend of fruity, spicy hints rounded off with booze. However, the flavour lacks the complexity and balance of the aroma - harsh bitterness is a dominant feature. Body is alright but feels a shade too spritzy. Perhaps this bottle is just a bit too old - I may re-review in the future. Drinkable enough but no need to run out and hunt it down."
""
"Overall a very nice Belgian ale, well put together."
""
"O: A great springtime beer. Highly carbonated. Exploding with fruits and yeast. What's not to like?"
""
""
""
"D- A decent brew. Would have trouble drinking a lot of it. Mouthfeel was much too effervescent for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely a solid no-frills tripel, can't quite hang with some of the best of its kind but a fine example, quite easy drinking as well."

"Essa cerveja é realmente surpreendente. Antes de prová-la eu havia lido sobre ela em vários lugares, os quais não davam tanto elogios a ela. Porém na minha primeira oportunidade já senti que não concordava com a opinião da maioria dos especialista. Na segunda vez, eu tive certeza. É com certeza uma das melhores cervejas trapistas da humanidade."

"O - More subtle and delicate than most Belgian tripels, Achel 8° exhibits some awesome traits of the style but without underlying complexity, only to show shallow yeast characteristics of coriander spice and clay with sugary sweetness taking over most of the profile. It's carbonation level aids in the drinkability of such a sweet beer but, it's also the cause of the beer exploding all over the place, and it's not the first time it's happened to me. Be cautious opening the bottle and don't expect a smack-in-the-face Belgian tripel from this one."
"O- Very tasty. The delicate feel of this makes it really enjoyable and really showcases its sweet flavors."

"Drink slowly and enjoy."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy light orange with a two finger white head. It looks fantastic, a good tripel in appearance. Scents of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, moscato wine, apple juice, slight honey, slight spice, caramel sweetness, and very faint hints of bubblegum. A very Trappist aroma, quite sweet, yeasty, fruity and deep with faint spice. Quite nice, excellent, enticing and complex. Flavor follows the aroma, quite sweet upfront, with hints of moscato wine, apricot, slight citrus peel bitterness and sour tang especially in the middle, candi sugar, some hints of Belgian yeast, and spices, some very faint alcohol, and some graininess on the finish. The finish is also quite dry. Very nice combination of flavors, on style for a tripel, which is certainly what this beer is. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Quite on style for a tripel, yet again. Overall this is a very good tripel, one of the better ones I've had. I recommend getting a bottle and giving it a try. It's got an excellent and complex aroma, and a nice taste that melds with a very nice mouthfeel. It's not the best Trappist, but it is one of the better beers I've had."

"Pours cloudy yellow with frothy white head that keeps on going. Aroma screams tripel, with a sweet honey nose, some spice, and lots of dry yeasty characteristics. Taste is banana and citrus, dry yeasty finish. This one goes down pretty easy and I enjoyed it. Could drink it in any occasion. While this was a nice beer, the premium price that comes from the ""Trappist"" label puts this out of reach as a regular brew. Solid beer though."

"O: Great aroma - complex and very well integrated. The aromas go very well together. The flavor, though, is not great. Tangy, a bit too dry, without all the complexities of the aroma."

"Pairs well with: margarita pizza, traditional Caesar salad, and Alfredo pasta"
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Hazy and golden, with a substantial head, and lots of thick lacing. Nose is yeasty and hearty. Grainy flavor, very yeasty, accentuated with a citrus tones. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
"O: Achel 8 is a Trappist Trippel of high class, very smooth and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nearly clear gold with a creamy white head that remains dense throughout the session. Excellent balance between fruity esters, hop spice, and a slightly rustic but crisp malt. Faint banana, coriander, nutmeg, pear, black pepper, with a slightly chalky bitterness. Dry and airy in the mouth. Goes down way too easy. An excellent Trappist ale."
""
"Overall: This is a good tripel, not great, but good. Not sure it is worth the $5 per 12oz price tag, but if you have the extra cash, go for it."
"O: A disappointment for a Trappist tripel and the resounding loser to Chimay White, which I scored 4.23. The unappealing plasticky sweetness is the memorable feature, and that's a drag,"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit sluggish, could use a bit more carbonation, but not bad for the style. Overall a bit of a sweet mess. I wouldn't know what to do with another bottle of this. The kind of thing that that gives Tripels a bad name."

"330 ml brown bottle, at home. Poured into a tulip glass. I have this bottle for almost one year in my cellar. ABV 8%. Slighty hazy, deep orange colour. On top, two fingers of snow white, sopay head, very good retention. Leaves light lacing around the glass. Aroma was all malts when I opened the bottle, now that it sits in the glass, aroma is fruity, a bit yeasty, some notes of the alcohol too. Very nice flavour, very complex as well. Quite bitter, even from the beginning. Again, lots of fruity notes, a bit of malts. Aftertaste is sharply bitter. Alcohol very well hidden.Great. Full body, a biting carbonation, but only for a second.Quite dry on the palate. Overall, a very good belgian strong ale, the amount of bitterness surprised me on this one. Very refreshing and drinkable, in spite of the high ABV."
""
""
""
"Overall: quite complex and very well balanced. A lot of blondes tend to be very big on one note, this one balances a lot of the common blonce notes very well, so it's a real winner in the style for me."
""
"O - I'm glad I didn't let this beer get too much age on it. It will be an interesting experiment to see how it tastes with a few months on it but I'm pretty sure what makes it good will start to fade. This was a great blonde and I'll definitely seek it out again."

"Achel Blond is a fine tripel. ""Middle of the road"" by Belgian standards, which is no laughing matter. But I wonder if it weren't brewed by monks, would it retain its prestige?"
"In this year 2013 I found this beer on the shelf labeled sept 2009. I was sick at the time so waited til I could properly taste to open. Immediately upon opening the bottle it made a slight hiss then filled the air with the scent of apples. The smell changed slightly in the pour openingup notes of caramel, toffee, honey, smells as if it's going to have a very big thick flavor. Taste starts with a light bread flavor then tastes like there's mixed fruit jam on th bread- apple, raisin, plum, peach with sweet toffee candy on the end of the taste.slight alcohol aftertaste with sugars and candy lingering. The toffee caramel and sugar influence is heightened actually when the sediment is poured. It's an amber orange-brown color with bubbles rising from the bottom towards a thick head that starts 3 fingers and lowers while sipping but never goes away. More toffee and sugar flavor in the head- more bread and fruit jam taste in the liquid. An excellent drink- though I hear some people prefer a young bottle o this. Somewhat warped that my first experience is a 3 yr bottle but I'll remember this beer and come back to this review to compare a younger bottle"

"Low C"
"D - I'll give it another chance sometime."
"A Trappist with higher drinkability than average, refreshing and still packed with flavors and spices, to a moderate level, which is good for a change."
"The taste is similar to the nose but with a powerful pepper character and a moderate bitterness that lingers for a long while. It has the kind characteristics I like in a Trappist Ale but it has a bit more bite to it than others."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I found this to be an above-average beer, but not in the same league as my favorite tripels (Karmeliet, Fin du Monde, or Tank 7, for example). The flavors are solid, but not as well-integrated as the leading beers of this style and the mouthfeel was a little lacking. My criticisms, however, are all relative, and I would readily drink this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong, malty aroma has a fruity overtone that is crisp and cider-like rather than sweet. Pours a bubbly clear solar yellow with a thick, fluffy white head. Crisp, malty flavor has a firm fruity note, mostly apple with a hint of pear, and a hoppy green wood undertone, just a little bitterness. Smooth flavor has good body and plenty of tingle. You go, monks!"
""
""
""
""

"A great tripel, and while I wouldn't rate it higher than Westmalle's, it's still one that I enjoyably return to again. I love the fruitiness, but the excessive sugary taste over a more bitter option might make it considerably less enjoyable over time. Still a good starter for people wanting to try nice Belgian beers!"
"Will pour a five+ finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Apple and Belgian yeast nose and flavor is light fruit, light malt and Belgian yeast. Good but not great Trappist. $4.49 for a 330ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
""
"Very crisp and clean without yeast, this turns into a bigger, more balanced beer. Different experience for sure, and both are interesting, though I'd add the yeast from the start next time. Can't beat that aroma and more balanced mouthfeel with the yeast. While this is a great Tripel, it's overpriced considering St. Bernardus is a couple dollars cheaper and tastes better."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 7/5/2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a very nice 2 -3 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice thick foamy lacing clings to the glass, with a lot of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of pear, pepper, apple, herbal, clove, banana, bread, candi sugar, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of apple, pear, banana, clove, pepper, bread, earth, grass, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying flavors at all, very crisp. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly slick and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent tripel! Great flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. Really enjoyed this one. I also had a bottle that was 3 years older recently, and this fresher bottle was far superior."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I was left wanting for more flavor - the aroma promises so much but the taste is an odd combo of dry cracker and sweet malt. After a while though if you're not over-analyzing it, it starts to go down real smooth and refreshing. It masks the 8% abv very well, but the copper penny taste drags it down a notch."
""
""
"Pale, clear gold with a pearly white head, sticky lacing, and it’s all around attractive. Pretty clear for a tripel. Nose is nice – usual suspects like green apple and that phenol smell that reminds you of aspirin, powder, etc. The taste takes a nice turn in that it’s sort of herbal and bitter in addition to the typical fruity, chalky tripel-ey taste. Mouthfeel is a little fizzy. Tasty beer but nothing to write home about. I appreciated its appearance and nose the most."
"330ml bottle. Achel Chalice glass. Revisited on jul´12. Pours shining gold in color. Hazy & glowing appearance. Off-white, very small size bubbled, froth. Thick crown & fairly good retention. As expected, complex aroma profile: Belgian yeast, ripe fruits, floral/herbal notes, spices, brown sugar & alcohol to the nose. Flavors are: pale malts & subtle bready touch, medicinal/phenolic hues, warming alcohol with fruity/spiced hints. Medium but viscous body. Moderate carbonation. Slightly citric bitterness is shown to the finish. Highly recommended as every Trappist beer."
""
""
"D - Other than the blatant over-carbonation, this is an all around solid, drinkable tripel. As a side note, I'm beginning to think lacing is really dependant on the glassware used. I typically use a tulip or balloon shaped goblet for beer like this, and don't usually see a ton of lacing... but this glass, which has sides that are more vertical seems to allow for much more lacing to occur... Anyways, a solid beer save for the one carbonation flaw."
""
""
"This is the dryest of the tripels that I have been tasting and has an almost farmhouse/ saison quality to it. Very simple and easy drinking with an enticing spicy character. Pilsner malt really shines through and it is not very hoppy or bitter. I nice, stripped down, no nonsense tripel and an excellent intro to this style for anyone who's never had it."

""
""
"O: This beer has a nice complexity in both the smell and taste. I enjoyed the flavors but this is much more of a sipping beer than a session beer."
""
""
""
"For a tripel this was a bit weak, lacking the salty, sea-weedy, lightly hammy flavor and the scabby, blotchy head that I find so oddly appealing. For a nice blond ale, however, this was pretty good. It's somewhat light in all categories, including the ABV-- is this really 8%?-- but still has plenty of yeasty, Belgian-comfy taste. I wouldn't become a monk over this one, but I'd at least visit a beer store on the monks' behalf."
""
"D: Very drinkable."
"O - Overall this is well worth the tag of a Trappist beer. I had my reservations on purchasing this one given its high price tag but wow my doubts were mislead. An absolute must for any lover of blondes, Tripels, or Trappist ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good tripel, overall. I'd like a bit more depth in the aroma and flavor along with a lighter and crisper body, but still it's quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice treat. A beer that always seems to command a high price tag, and is not as easily available as other (better) options. Still a prize Tripel that's easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"I really like this beer, but I don't like to have to wait for its goodness through a giant head. Pretty good though, actually, quite good indeed. I'll want another from this brewery for sure."

"Pours a medium gold color with an enormous 4 finger eggshell head- even with a careful pour. The beer is murky, and impossible to see through, and the head leaves massive lacing on my tulip glass. The nose is actually very average for a Tripel. A little fruit, a little spice, a little malt, and all of them are on the weak side. It just doesn't have that amazing aroma and complexity the best in style have. Fortunately, the taste is WAY better. I get fruit, caramel, sugar, spices, and burned toast in the taste. Much better than the nose. Feel is medium, with decent carbonation and a very chewy feel to the beer. None of the 8% ABV is felt or tasted. Overall, a good brew- but the nose really brings this one down. Cheers."
""
"A nice enough tripel but the competition is stiff in this style so I probably won't be buying it again."
""
""
""
""
"very curious to what a fresh bottle tastes like but I'm loving this as its BB date approaches, mellow and sweet this is something I could drink again"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A classic already!"
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer, but not absolutely amazing. I'd prefer a Westmalle tripel, but this is certainly a good substitute."
"A must try if you dig Belgian blondes/tripels."
""
""
"D: may be a full-ish body, but this brew is so easy drinking it doesnt matter. i could have one of these at any time of the day. belgian tripels have a great way of being full bodied without the heat."
"Overall: Pleasantly surprised. The best I've ever had. Will be buying again."
"O - Thought it was a decent beer, glad I tried it. Not my best tasting, which may have effected my review"
"P.S. Their Brune is just as awesome."
"O - A very good blond, I mean triple. Really I didn't know until I saw it at BA."
"I would say to serve this beer at a bit below cellar temp. Not too warm because it is very carbonated. A fantastic beer, I will scoop up a few anytime I run across them."
"Dry finish, crisp palate."
"O: Looking for an all-day Trappist? Here’s my pick. I love how non-threatening this beer is. I mean, you can’t drink a Rochefort without feeling a bit of shell-shock from the flavors, in the end. Achel Blond is a testament to the drinkability and sheer pleasure that we can get from well-balanced flavor. This is one of those beers I would pick to accompany a meal at many different occasions, or to serve to a group of people who aren’t necessarily beer connoisseurs. It’s just one of those crowd-pleasing brews."
"O: 3 - I have finally put to rest my long standing question as to whether Blond ales age well. Though this beer certainly wasn't undrinkable and was even moderately enjoyable, due to the extreme radical change in character, I would argue that this beer is best enjoyed fresh and shouldn't be aged."
"O-An excellent contrast to the other more lush, rich tripels. Would love to try one with a few years on it to see if it mellows."
"Overall - I love this beer and on my ongoing journey to try all the trappist ales this is another impressive and exciting offering. Its rich and fruity. A damn good brew!"
"Pours bright orange gold with a bit of haze and thick bone-white head. Nose has classic BPA notes with some fruitiness and dough from the yeast and a little citrus from the hops. Palate is crisp and dry with some nice bittering hops. Hay and orange pulp come to mind for flavors. My favorite of the Achel line but still prefer La Trappe Triple or Westmalle Triple."
"Duvel glass pour and I am met with foam plus a little beer at the bottom. HUGE foamy head that looks like a french vanilla float. Had to try three times to get all the beer into the glass at once. Underneath all that foam is a cloudy amber colored ale. The aroma is grassy, lemon smell with some apple and other fruits. Some minor malt as well. Great tasting with some spicy pepper like qualities up front followed by a yeast-grainy feel and some very light fruit (lemon peel) at the end of the sip. Slightly sour. Big carbonation and dries very quickly in the mouth. Overall I feel this is a very nice Tripel and obviously as authentic as it can get. Not as fruity or sweet as other Tripels which is a nice change. Not sure I could do more than a small bottle though as it does numb the tastebuds after a while."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow color with a HUGE 4 inch stark white head. The head overflowed when I poured the beer and there are super aggressive carbonation bubbles in this one. The head settles down into a mountainous pillow of foam on the top of the beer. Random spotting of lacing on the glass as the head settles too. Smells of Belgian yeast, spices, mild fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is very yeast forward with spices, lemongrass/citrus, and some malt on the finish. Slightly bitter citrus zest flavors on the palate after each sip. Feel is extremely carbonated to the point where is detracts from the overall experience in my opinion. Overall, this is a good tripel from this Trappist brewery and I am glad I got a chance to try it."
"Overall quite the treat, one of the most intense blonds I've ever tasted, and probably one of the tastiest as well. Wish it were cheaper, but at the same time, I wish they all were."
"O: Not my favorite tripel, but a very good one. Definitely recommend."
"O/D - Lovely beer. Probably underrated blonde ale. No alcohol noticable, flavourful, refreshing, and hoppy. Alot of characteristics I like and they've presented it flawlessly."
"Balance is slanted towards an astringent, unpleasant bitterness. Flavors are somewhat muted and thus slightly lackluster; some additional sweetness or a less astringent finish would help this Tripel incarnation considerably."
"(11.2oz bottle). Pours clear golden color with massive white head. Active carbonation and nice lacing. Aroma is grass, light grape or melon, some hops. Taste is sweet malt with some hop bitterness. Light bodied with creamy texture. Dry, slightly bitter finish. Good beer."
"Clear, golden body is highly effervescent, literally boiling from the streams of upraising bubbles, topped by ever-lasting rocky white head that gets dimply and clumpy as it slowly retreats, leaving thick patches of lace hanging on the walls. The head never fades off completely and sets to a thick, firm cover instead. Aroma is prominent orange-like esters and clove-like, mildly spicy phenols, light pils-malt sweetness and a tinge of alcohol. The medium-light bodied beer is airy on the palate although the high alcohol content adds creamy sensation. Flavor is an interplay of spicy, peppery phenols with esters of orange. High carbonation, attenuation and bitterness that seems more phenol rather than hop-derived lend dry finish with lingering yeasty, spicy aftertaste. A nearly flawless triple without any alcohol warmth, as it should be. (330 ml, BB date reads 20. May 2011 indicating full maturity at the time of the review, into Achel chalice)"
"A very clean tripel. Perhaps a bit too reserved for my taste."
"Served in a Duvel tulip; clean golden color with a huge, cloud-like head lingered throughout the whole beer. Aroma is a little spicy, ,but primarily slightly hoppy. Taste is a nice combination of the sweet Belgian spiciness I'd expect, along with a little more bitterness than I'm used to in a tripel. The flavor lingers a little after finishing a swig; overall a very tasty tripel."
"An agreeable, and equitably recommendable Tripel, the style's SOP alcohol edge honed, and reduced to a mere echo. Quite drinkable for that, or at least until the flipside of the sword makes its mark. Trappist brewers do excel at subtly, and this one sneakily possesses it in spades."
"Aftertaste of bitter hops. Slightly cloying."
"Drinkability is good. I'm pretty partial to tripels and this one was a pleasure to drink."
"Overall - This is no St. Bernardous or Goulden Carolus. This is very mild and surprisingly drinkable. Nice legs on this blond, but I've had better."
"Nice Belgian blonde here. Clean up the aroma, and this would be excellent."
"A good tripel, well balanced, nice with strong cheese."
"M/D This is a pretty balanced beer, with a more mild carbonation. The beer itself is really easy to drink and has a dry finish to it."
"A proper Belgian tripel, easily drinkable; limited only by ABV and price."
"Medium bodied, well carbonated, and smooth. This is a nice, easy drinking Tripel, which I would seek out again."
"Overall: Nice trappist. One of the easiest to drink among the trappist beers."
"A delicious Trappist ale. Much nicer than the Bruin."
"Easy to drink but more potent than expected. Great balance. Very fine. Very much underrated here. One of the best tripels I can remember."
"Achel does an incredible job crafting their beers, yet another solid offering."
"In the interest of science, I split the beer between two glasses: my Duvel glass, and my beautiful (and new) Goose Island wide-mouthed glass. This glass accentuates the malt, especially the doughy, mildly dusty character. The carbonation is also firmer and more scrubbing, the palate tastes sweeter and not as complex. If I were to review that pour, I'd give it a B+ instead of the A- it's gotten here. I guess my Duvel tulip will have to be my go-to reviewing glass here on out."
"Drinkability: I prefer this one to the 2010. While it is not as balanced, it is overall a more tasty tripel."
"D - Still very drinkable. The flavors are certainly in much different balance, but I think they are still all excellent."
"A nice addition to the Trappist beers, would recommend to lovers of several kinds of drinks, not only beer."
"D: Not my favourite tripel, not my favourite Achel. Still, a great beer. A treat to drink, fun, and rewarding. Recommended."
"jd"
"Good carbonation tickles the tongue and contributes to the dry finish. A decently drinkable beer that hides the alcohol well."
"Carbonation is stupidly high, just like the bruin. What is the point of carbonation so high that you cant taste the beer?"
"Drinkability: For one word to describe this beer think ""balance."" There is both sweet and bitter here and their interplay leaves one wanting another sip. I quite enjoyed this beer and intend to revisit it when possible."
"Taste is fruit like apples, grapes and pears with a pretty good sized dose of Belgian hops. Very clean, crisp and fresh tasting. Nice mouth feel and easy to drink. A very nice triple indeed."
"Another trappist that got it right."
"Although this beer was within its best buy date, it would be much better fresh. A good trippel, but for the price I was expecting better."
"Pours a nice very light orange with a good white head and a pretty large number of lace rings. Nose brings forward some spice, sweetness, light fruits, and a bit of pear. Taste brings in a bit of booze along with spice and light grain. Good, fairly-light mouthfeel with some alcohol heat. Drinks quite well, although not nearly as good as the Westmalle."
"I don't know what it is about this beer but it seems like the most amazing thing right now. Very possibly my new favorite tripel."
"crisp mouthfeel, medium-bodied with above average carbonation. as for drinability, i'd put it at fair. i wouldn't object to another but for my money there are better tripels out there."
"D - I like it, could have a few."
"D: The Trappists know what they're doing when it comes to beer and the Achel Blond is no exception. Perhaps the youthfulness of the brewery is evident in it's agressive hoppiness, but that's fine by me. A must try."
"Far too expensive for the quality of the beer, but I'm glad I tried it. Good tripel all in all."
"D-this is lively and carbonated in the throat with some interestingly balanced flavors, plenty of yeast, not perfect, lots of ruit qualities with a decent spice in the back."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Pour a vivid tangerine orange, with a nicely constructed head rising roughly a half inch. Some light carbonation is present from the bottom of the glass, though it doesn't look overly so. Interesting smell with a touch of sourness at the outset. Fruit and spice is there too, golden raisins and peppery cloves. The first thing you notice when tasting the beer is the mouthfeel. It's a contradiction. It's at once effervescent yet creamy, light yet heavy. Really incredible. The actual taste is a flavor explosion, with just a ton of different things going on. The light sourness carries over to the taste, with some sour apple notes that belie a sweet orange marmalade finish. In the middle there's a really nice light caramel sweetness going on, helping to cleverly mask the high ABV. This is really a very well constructed Belgian blonde, one of the best examples of the style that I've had. I could easily drink a couple of these and not complain at all."
"D: For drinking slowly. Not a guzzler. Easy going, though."
"Trappist Achel 8° pours a clear gold with the most beautiful fluffy head that lingers with a thick whipped cream texture. The aroma is sweet pale malt and some spicy yeast character. Sweet caramel and estery malt is upfront in the flavor. The estery sweetness fades leaving the finish dry and phenolic. There is some alcohol, but it is fairly mild. Simple, but delicious, it seems that Achel is less hyped but equal to the other Trappists."
"I'd never had Achel before, but this one won't be my last. This is pretty damned close to being a style standard-bearer. Like most good tripels, alcohol is nowhere and the beer goes down way too easily."
"D- saw it at that old gulf gas station with 500 single bottles and grabbed it right away, i've been lookin for this for quite some time. all i need to do is find a westvleteren and i'll have had a beer from all 7 trappist breweries. very refreshing and drinkable for such a big beer. gotta be one of my favorite tripels ever and the yeast funkiness keeps me comin back for more. shoulda got 2 bottles."
"D - This is a continual contradiction that all comes together as a great beer. It is perfectly balanced but still shows some great individual elements. It is substantial and mouth coating but still dangerously drinkable. Bravo!"
"D - Definitely a most drinkable, sessionable Tripel; the taste was well balanced with almost perfect smoothness; in my opinion, one of the most enjoyable Belgian Tripel/Blond for the warmer seasons/climates (5)"
"Tastes and drinks like a typical tripel, which for me is a good thing!"
"D - This is a top beer and deserves top marks. You won't find a poor beer from this Monastary"
"A very good taste, smooth and round, completes this wonderfull and drinkable beer. A beer which you should have to drink...It is better than the blond westvleteren."
"Impression: Another superb Trappist priced too high for one to enjoy as often as one would want."
"A really do like this beer, but I much prefer Orval. Probably not one that I'd get again, considering the closest place to me that carries it is about an hour and a half away."
"Notes: Yep this is your standard Belgian Style Blonde/Tripel."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed the fruit flavors, and the slightly lighter body, but carbonation was a tad rough for my liking."
"D: The beer is extremely drinkable and rather refreshing."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Typical of belgian beers."
"Drinkability - Not sessionable, I could handle maybe two if I nursed them, but what Trappist/Abbey beer *is* sessionable? Orval, maybe, but the bitterness of that beer prevents even that."
"I like it. I am very pleased with this beer and would be happy to drink it more often if it was easier to get (and cheaper)."
"Overall this was more impressive to me than the aged Brune I had recently. A well done beer that works nice with the time of year. Worth a shot."
"Pretty creamy mouthfeel that slides down easy with very light carbonation, but at the same time it's got some body to it and some weight. The caramel sweetness reappears as the beer sits and warms and negates the metallic taste. Overall a very enjoyable beer that's fairly tasty and very smooth and drinkable."
"Served with Gouda and Brie cheese and whole grain crackers."
"D- Dangerously drinkable... and the 8% ABV will catch-up to you if you're not careful!"
"11.5oz. bottle poured into my Orval chalice. Golden blond with a puffy white head. Tight bubbles. Fades to a thin white head that hangs around for the remainder of the beer. Not to much lacing at all, bummer. Smells awsome, sour apple, pear, green grapes and yeasty rising bread dough. Tastes fruity, malty, with apple, pear and again green grape type flavors. Slightly bitter with a clean finish. Feels a little buttery and slippery on the palate, nice level of carb. Pretty drinkable when you consider you're not gonna be plugging a bunch of these guys in one sitting. I'd have two."
"Smooth and dry mouhthfeel, almost a little too dry to be hones, carbonation is okay though."
"drinkability - easy to drink although the taste wears on the palate a bit"
"Opinion: I really like this beer too. It is really clean and stupid easy to drink. The carbonation is so high that you can barely tell how strong this beer is. I am enjoying the beer and am glad that I got to try it. I would definitely like to have this beer again."
"D – This is an exceptionally well-crafted beer; it is the definition of balance. It is fabulous, yet restrained, making for a subtle stunner."
"Foam a little sweet but that quickly becomes bitter. Nose a little alcohol that recalls the classic combination of orange-cilantro. The taste is fairly simple and has little flavor, it is still bitter and spicy but it remains unconvincing. The aftertaste is bitter, too spicy but is actually quite interesting. Despite the appetizing qualities of beer, we find ourselves with a beer relatively low in flavor, and certainly it is a beer style triple coupled with a Trappist beer. One of the few Trappists who really disappoints."
"Refreshing upfront with a bit of an alcohol warmth in the end."
"Notes: Good beer, but not as intense and flavorful as other Trappists beers."
"Mouthfeel - Smooth, medium body with quite some carbonation that feels right."
"D - Not bad, this beer is really boring though. I will probably not revisit this one."
"Carbonation is never too much or prickly. Pretty dry mouthfeel. Drinkability is good and the 8% doesn't slow you down at all."
"I remember really enjoying the Achel Blond a lot more the first time, but this time I am a little disappointed. I am a big fan of all Trappist beers, but this one is on the lower end of the scale. I have a couple of bottles of the Blond still left, maybe I should invite a friend over and enjoy the beer without having to review it."
"D - This is a nice triple with great yeast character, especially in the aroma. The hops are put to good use here and manage to balance out the relatively sweet finish while also augmenting the peppery character of the yeast in the flavor. My only complaint is that the yeast in the bottle has obviously started to go bad and dulls the flavor a bit (not to mention the unpleasant looking floaters in an otherwise good looking beer). Overall is is quite enjoyable, though I can't help but think it was a better beer when it left Belgium than it is by the time it makes its way over here."
"Overall, not a bad tripel. A very fine representation of the style. I liked the flavor. Nothing special, but the beer is supposed to be what it is supposed to be. Very nice."
"Not overly complex or satisfying from a flavor perspective. Not one of my favorite trappist beers. A long way off from Westmalle - the standard for my money."
"Thick head, wouldn't dissipate. Yeasty, very residual, thick triple taste with mild carbonation. The aroma is sweet citrusy, taste turns into dry hops. Very good beer."
"Conclusion: Far from the best, but not the worst. If you are looking for a Belgian Tripel that is well-crafted, tastes delicious, and is easy to drink- look no further. ~"
"Whoa! Yummy! orrr perhaps I should say luxuriant ~ Very lively beer, started foaming over over as soon as the bottle was opened. Poured with a great textured, foamy, frothy, big off-white to light tan head with plenty of lace. Color is a very clear and bright orange amber until the lees at the bottom was added to cloud it up. Aroma is similar in a way to the bavarian weiss with the banana and clove, but different - lot's of malt, yeast, honey, a little hop, and white wine. Flavor is much the same with good interplay between bitter and sweet. Satsifying. Good for a few sips and perhaps, a couple of quaffs before returning to sipping. Great finish too. A little boozy at the end. Head lasts forever. A session beer for the slow going."
"Overall a good tripel and a very well-crafted brew, as you would expect."
"the finish has lingering subtle malt sweetness from the med body. this beer is ok but not the best trappist by a long shot."
"Overall, good but not great in comparison to its brethren."
"D: Very drinkable. Authentic Belgian Triple. Authentic Trappist quality"
"Poured a blond/golden yellow color, slightly turbid, with a huge offwhite head that was constantly replenished by the high carbonation and left ample lacing on the glass. Aroma was moderate and seemed overly simple, mainly corn, rice, and crystal malt. Flavor is simple, yet elegant. Very clean corn and rice flavor upfront, followed by angel food cake and freshly baked white bread. Warming as well. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth despite the high carbonation. Despite the fact that this is not my favorite style, I found this to be a very clean and refreshing beer."
"The alcohol is present, somehow more than you'd expect. I've had this trappist before. It's modest in it's range of flavours, and allthough it's certainly well worth a try, it's not quite as significant as f.i. Rochefort, Chimay or Orval."
"This could well be a favorite of many. Great drink with a nice malt finish."
"D: Not as heavy as other Trappist-beers but very nice in the great dryness. A bit more discrete than other Trappist-tripels. If you see the Trappist-stamp on the label you can't go wrong..."
"D: A very nice tripel with an excellent appearance. Pretty solid across the board."
"Get this beer anytime, anywhere."
"Notes: It is hard for me to believe that I waited until review #625 to review this Trappist beer from Achel but I think that waiting that long gave me a good perspective to enjoy this beer with the proper perspective. This is an expertly made version of the style. Bravo!"
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Enjoyable all around. Another great Trappist and a great tripel."
"M/D: Thick-bodied for a tripel, but pleasant. I could certainly drink a few of these in the blink of an eye."
"Drinkability: I love a good tripel and this is no exception. Light despite a high ABV, beautiful malt character bringing interesting flavors; just what the doctor ordered."
"A decent overall tripel here. Good balance of flavors and deceptive given its strength. I can reccommend drinking this."
"the taste is light and the flavors still come out nicely but there is a slight harshness provided by the yeast strain. While equal in complexity to that of the smell, the taste is a bit spicier and very drying. Tastes of horse blanket and astringent orange are also present but not completely disturbing. I've learned that you can't go wrong with any trappist, but some are more drinkable than others. Still, this is a very good beer."
"this beer could get you in trouble but i dont see it as an incredibly easy drinker, as in you wont sit down drink 4 or 5 and get tossed, its more of an even draw drink thatll leave you satisfied"
"Notes - It's pretty sweet for a tripel, and kind of sour as well. I imagine that would turn many people away from this beer, but not me. I love it! It's deliciously complex, there's no way I can figure out everything that's going on in here."
"Had this at the tap house in Norfolk. Poured into a goblet. Appears a nice clowdy golden color. Aromas of citrus fruits mostly pineapple with some caramel. The beer starts off dry and spicy with carbonation hitting in tbe middle with a nice acidic finish. Very drinkable and the alcohol is hidden well. Another great trappist beer."
"The drinks easy for its strength, good beer, not a great Trappist."
"D: I liked this beer and could drink it all night if I wanted. Not over the top in any bit of its character."
"D - Refreshing and crisp. Very drinkable. The ABV isn't as high as it could be but still could get you into trouble. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a very good tripel."
"pretty decent tripel. ther are several i have tried that are better. very dissapointed compared to other trappist ales. reminds me of a strong american pale ale. OK."
"M&D: the palate benefits a lot from the refreshing yet also super-fine carbonation, as much as from the chewy bitter palate attributable to the good proportion of hops in the mixture highlighted by the yeast intervention. Overall, the texture is rounded and smooth, turning bitter and heavenly chewy, while no trace of alcohol is picked up what-so-ever. While being neither as colourfully estery nor as profoundly malty as some other Tripel ales, I like this one for its (almost) pure integrity, an achievement made possible by people (the monks!) who really know their stuff and proudly keep the long tradition. To me, this is a supremely drinkable example of Tripel, or whatever style one wishes to label it!"
"Poured into a Konigshoeven glass in order to keep with the trappist theme. This produced a very large, white head, very much like a pilsener. The color is a hazy yellow and it's possible to detect the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. This is the first Achel brew that I have tried and I was surprised that the beer was so sour for a Belgian Tripel Ale. Nevertheless it's still a pretty solid beer and it has not deterred me from trying more Achel products."
"Overall, decent brew but there are much better beers of the style out there."
"D - Damn, this is quite delicious. It doesn't fit my general perception of a tripel, but it's bursting with unique and complex flavors. Undoubtedly this unique character is a result of aging, but I would love to get a hold of this stuff fresh to compare."
"D - Not a bad drop. The sharpness of taste may inhibit imbibing too many of these. Not my favourite Trappist but good nonetheless."
"OVERALL: Not a bad brew taste-wise, but the rest of it was pretty average. A bit too thin as well. That said, however, it's a much better offering than their double and I'd go for it again."
"Lots of carbonation to this guy, crisp and dry in the finish."
"A great beer from the lesser known of the trappist breweries."
"For me, this beer falls just behind Chimay White for sheer flavor, texture, and drinkability. Definately a must-revisit for me."
"Aroma reeks of Belgium yeast and a bit of sour funk. Quaff shows off a crisp and carbonated brew bomb of sweet fruity mash. Slick and rich, drinks like a dream with its dry finish. Of course, a great example of a Tripel - just too high $ import fee to make it steadily into the DBF."
"O) Easy quaffing, Belgium in a bottle. Rock on you men of God."
"D - I could drink a bunch of these but the 8% ABV is the only thing between me and a worn out liver. Amazing stuff!"
"This beer pours a hazy pale orange color. The head is a massive three inches in height, and recedes very slowly into thick thunks of lacing. The aroma is of barnyard funk, citrus, and tangy wheat. The taste is just as funky as the aroma, with lots of tang too. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture and nice carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could easily drink again."
"MF&D - a good beer, refreshing, but not much to say about it on the whole. not a lot of carbonation (I guess it all went out on the huge head!), not alot of body either. it is beautiful in its simplicity. but I could not drink this all night, as it would get bring."
"A light gusher upon opening. Pours a very bright golden color with a huge white head that fell slowly becoming somewhat creamy, leaving behind some bubbly lacing. Tons of carbonation bubbles coming up from the bottom of the goblet. Aroma is lemony, light grassiness, apple spice, a small amount of funky sourness. Taste is grainy, earthy, hints of honey, and slightly sweet almost cake batter-like middle and endlessly dry on the finish. Very aggressive carbonation scrubs the tongue. This one needs to mellow out a bit on the table before I continue on with it. Yeah, the carbonation has gone down a bit but it doesn't do anything to help the mouthfeel. It's medium bodied, crisp, dry. A good beer, but definitely nowhere near the top of the Trappists."
"Pours a dark golden clear, with nice carbonation and excellent lacing. Smells light bready and light fruity, a little pilsneresque, a big thick head that lasts. Tastes beautifully comlex, with light fruit and a nice light mouthfeel. Highly drinkable. Like the rest of the Trappist triples, this is well balanced, very nice."
"Best buy date of 2/10. Pours a hazy straw yellow/orange with a huge, creamy white head. Retention and lacing are fantastic--still a full one-finger of foam after almost ten minutes. No sediment. Smells strongly of fruit esters with banana and pear coming through behind light citrus. A lot of bready, doughy yeast is also predominant, along with a light spiciness. Slightly tangy upon first tasting thanks to the yeast, with sweet fruitiness playing against spiciness. Very bready, somewhat reminiscent of a Chimay brew. Some bitterness comes along toward the end to make this one quite refreshing. I do remember more hop presence from the bottles I've had in Belgium, but this one has crossed an ocean and sat for a full year, so it's easy to understand. Not as syrupy sweet as Westmalle or many other tripels. Very nice."
"The mouthfeel was quite smooth and a nice weight, not to heavy and not to light."
"nice, and very drinkable. glad i got myself a couple to keep in the fridge."
"Light and refreshing"
"8/4/7/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"Notes: This blond had a lot of fun and and loved every minute of it. Not bad at all."
"Poured a light copper coloration into a pint glass. The head was a great amount and reduced to a lingering amount of lacing. The smell was that of bananas of Now and Later and Citrus. The Taste itself was out of this world as it just left a overall great taste that had you coming back for more. As an unfiltered it fell into the complete taste and fullness that unfiltered beers present themselves as."
"D: Hides the abv and is nice and light, probably the most sessionable trappist I've had."
"Drinkability is high, this is tasty and goes down easy, and is excellent with food. Be careful and enjoy!"
"o:this is an easy drinking triple. the alcohol is present from start to finish, but is never domineering. it supplements all other components of the beer including mouthfeel. very well-balanced to the point that its hard to figure out what contributes certain aspects. i've never noticed the urea scent before in other beers. its in the background but reminds me of a ball-park bathroom(read stale urine). oddly, the note wasn't offensive which i cant explain. world class."
"Notes from 6/17/04"
"The aroma is yeasty (cheese like), with coriander, corn malt, and fruit (like citrus). The appearance starts with a huge head and then slowly falls to reveal a golden ale with lots of floating particles. the flavor is like the aroma with most of the alcohol being well hidden until the end, then you get a slight warming. The palate is thin but OK."
"D= This had the sweetness and the fruitiness I crave in the style, but fell just short in the mouthfeel department. Still, a damn fine tripel and one I would gladly seek out again."
"This is my second ""Belgium Bond"" bier I try, overall Im not impressed."
"The name suggests a Belgian Pale Ale, but the 8%ABV means it is either a BSPA or a Tripel. Overall I would say the beer fits the BSPA mold better, and it is certainly a good beer. Bordering on being too sweet and without the complexity of some other trappist offerings, but still a highly enjoyable drink."
"I was impressed by this beer and would recommend it highly. I bought this bottle at Beer Mania in Brussels."
"Pours a murky golden orange color with a meringue like white head. It actually looked like a spider web for a while. The aroma is of lemon and green apples, light spice and candi sugar. The taste is of pale malt, light candi sugar and pepper, some honey and white grapes. Not very complex in flavor but well made. The feel is fairly light with very active carbonation, the finish is sweet yet dry. A straight forward and simple BSPA, good flavors in nice balance. The flavor profile is not comparable to other BSPAs or Tripels but this one holds its own."
"Pours a pale gold color with good clarity and a dense, massive white head. Aromas are exceptionally fruity and full of yeasty phenolics. Lots of banana, a touch of clove and coriander and even some black pepper. Malt and hop notes certainly take a back seat. On the palate, a hugely carbonated brew settles in so smoothly with a real nice blend of bright citrus fruits and subtle spicing. Overall, this is a really smooth and incredible beer; one definitely not overlooking as often as I do at the store."
"too be continued..."
"Not bad."
"D: A solid overall blond with good drinkability and goes down effortlessly. Crisp, refreshing and very enjoyable."
"As i have noticed about all of the Trappist brews, this Achel is extremely drinkable. Like scary drinkable considering if you aren't careful, it can hit you pretty good. The only thing taking away from drinkability (for me) is the alcohol content, which only means that i would hesitate to enjoy more than say, two of these excellent example of what a beer should be."
"If it wasn't for the alcohol I could drink this all day..."
"Poured a dull, hazy gold with specks of brown sediment/yeast suspended. Two fingers of creamy head slowly dissipated leaving a very small persistent layer of head support by the good carbonation beneath.Overt smells of freshly baked bread/yeast. Also in the nose was banana, spice/pepper, and a scant touch of lemon zest. The taste is pretty smooth and begins with a doughy flavor which gives way to some lemon zest/pepper. Barely sweet. The taste finishesa little hoppy, very metallic and very drying. Although it is trappist brew, it really is not that spectacular of a Tripel."
"I truly enjoy Trappist Achel, their offerings are wonderful examples of beer. I think I've always favoured their bruin, but tonight's re-rating of the Blond - a 330ml bottle that is exactly two years past the recommended best before - has seriously thrown that into question. This is certainly a recommended try, aged and fresh. Always a pleasure."
"I could easily finish a couple of these without regard to ABV, though more than that in one sitting might be a bit much. Nonetheless, I throughly enjoyed this beer."
"This pours a nice golden straw color with a thick, champagnelike head. Smell is strong of apple, pears, floral hops and yeast. It has a bitter hops taste with flavors of apple, citrus (lemon & grapefruit) along with cloves. The mouthfeel starts off crisp, but gets rather acidic. Overall, a nice tripel from a Trappist brewery."
"D: pretty drinkable; definitely different from other tripels I have had, with more of a sweet character."
"D - Drinkable. Would I drink this all night, no, but a bottle or two with a nice book sounds like a nice night in..."
"Some of the staff I have spoken to at the Moan and Dove (one of my favorite bars) in Amherst have voiced their love and dedication to this particular Trappist brewery. So I guess that is why I picked up this brew, which I have not tasted in the past. Poured in to my Rapscallion glass an orange coloration, with a very good looking, large frothy white heading. Aroma reveals yeasty spice, green apple skin, hint of mango, and some leafy green hop. Taste is largely fruity...mostly a pear flavor, shadowed by a metallic finish. Light in body, and pretty drinkable for a Tripel. While this might be the smallest of the Trappist breweries, I cannot say that it is the best, or put as much faith in to it as my friends in Western Massachusetts. Sorry, but I have a feeling they are playing a favorite game based on image as opposed to quality of product. This, along with their Dubbel are great beers, but aren't nearly as good as some of the other Trappist examples IMO. This might be a good beginning point for beer drinkers getting in to the whole Trappist thing. Cheers"
"Drinkability: Decent. It's reasonably balanced and easy going for an 8% blonde."
"Overall this was a fairly enjoyable brew. I'd share it with friends during a spring/summer outing, although it was a little too pricy to make it a regular session beer."
"Very drinkable beer. I highly recommend trying this one. It's not my favorite Trappist beer, but at 8% it's darn good, and easy to drink."
"This poured a slightly hazy straw color with tons of white head. It smelled like lemon, wild yeast, and pine hops (more bitterly scented than expected). It had a very strong citrus flavor at first, but that mellowed out significantly over time. It had an oily texture and was quite carbonated, with a mild but lasting bitter aftertaste. Alcohol was surprisingly noticeable in the flavor and aftertaste. Overall this was slightly better than the average Belgian light ale, but still not that great."
"This is a very nice Belgian Trippel but not my favorite. It pours a prodigious very white, soapy and frothy head, that clings to the sides of the glass. It is a hazy orange and very appealing. The haziness formed an interesting cloudy nebula in the glass as it was held up to the light. I don't believe I've seen this before. There were no yeasty bits which is a plus. The smell is very, very appealing. Candied sugars, coriander, apple, banana, all the typical Belgian smells. If you like Belgian ales, the smell will entice. The taste is slightly disappointing in that I had really high expectations. This is a medium bodied beer, less syrupy, fewer candied sugars, not as much banana as I would have liked. You'll get some peppery spiciness and more alcohol notes that I care for. There is a yeasty snap to this beer in the finish. Overall, this is a really good beer, but it does have its weaknesses though. I'm going to review their bruin 8 next. L'Chaim."
"Overall:	A very nearly perfectly put-together blonde. More in the style of a blonde than a tripel. Smooth, drinkable, full-bodied and flavourful. Not enormously complex, but I don't think the style is meant to be. A beer of this quality could age quietly and gracefully for years, mellowing even further. For now, it loses a few points because of the metal on the finish, the Thai food, the sickly-sweetness, and the over-zealous head upon pouring. Otherwise outstanding."
"Recommended..."
"I poured this beer from the typical small Achel bottle into a tuliped burgundy glass. The beer had a warm orange color and the head was strong and full, almost like meringue. There were notable amounts of yeasty globs. The bouquet was inviting, smelling of citrus and malts. Upon tasting I found grapefruits, caramel, candy sugars and slight alcohol warming. The mouth-feel was great, champagne liveliness that excited my tongue. I think this is a great Belgian and is very well executed for the style. I wont have this too often unless I am teaching a friend about trappist beer or have a specific craving upon seeing the bottle."
"A very good Tripel. The appearance really stands out on this one - amazing head and lace. Flavour is not as complex as other Trappist Tripels - like Chimay and Westmalle. Overall, a very good Trappist Tripel - although I prefer Westmalle or Chimay over this one."
"Golden-orange. Some haze and sediment. Lasting off-white head. Toasty, malty, bready aroma with slight fruitiness. Complex flavor with big spiciness from hops and peppery phenols. Nice maltiness with toasty and bready notes. Very fruity with some alcohol notes. Aftertaste of spice, fruitiness and some alcohol warmth. Long finish. Medium body with rich mouthfeel. Well-carbonated."
"D- Delicious and well balanced, I can see making a night of it, but not a top on my tripel list."
"D = Good drinkability. Alcohol is present but not offensive, tastes are relatively light (for the style) and enjoyable. A great sipping beer in moderation."
"Overall this was a great experience! All the flavors came together nicely without hitting you over the head with any one particular element. Unfortunately this was pretty hard to find and at $7 for a small bottle, it's not something I'll be experiencing very often. Fantastic when available!"
"In sum, it might fall a bit short of the Westmalle tripel, but not by much. A wonderful trappist beer."
"D- No my favorite beer tastes like sourdough bread and hides the alcohol well."
"This on the 2nd time I remember having this beer and have no notes from the last time... but I will say, I will buy it again, but probably only if I was going to drink more than one triple."
"D: Easy to drink, it was hard to notice the 8% alcohol rating. Very distinguishable as an Authentic Trappist Product."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans le style Trappiste"
"33 cl bottle, pours a deep golden hazy colour, good head, it doesn't last much but leaves a nice cloak and lace. Acid aroma, floral, citrus, coriander and clove. Taste is acid, champagne-liked, spici, sour apples, confitted fruits.almonds and even some chocolate Sweet finish."
"Towering and extremely thick white head. Tons of bubbling carbonation from the bottom up. Has a Pilsner-like color to it giving it a clear gold appearance. It is very different from most of the Belgian Tripels I've had. Very bitter with strong Phenolic notes. Has a slight skunky pilsner aroma to it with hints of green apple and a citrus grapefruit aftertaste. Refreshing mouthfeel is very light and foamy. ABV is strong and noticed within the first few sips. Leaves an almost immediate warming on the stomach. Very complex and unique brew. I doubt I would buy this again. Overpowering Phenols and ABV make it not very drinkable.I bought this at Tully's in Wells, Maine for $5.00/Bottle."
"all under one sail"
"Overall: Of all the Trappist beers I have had, this is easily my least favorite. I don't know if the beer was perhaps stored improperly, but it certainly seems off to me."
"Overall - This is so good to me. I know there is higher rated Belgians, and I've had some of them, but this is really hitting the spot right now."
"The aroma was light and zesty  some yeast, a slight banana aroma with orange and lemon. The taste was lighter and more bitter than other tripels I've tried: the citrus flavours and hops cleansed the palate and there was less of a yeasty, chalky aftertaste or much sweetness from candi sugar. Low carbonation and medium body helped this one go down easy."
"D: Maybe my favorite Belgian Blonde/Tripel yet; a flavorful, beautifully balanced beer with tantalizing aroma and mouthfeel. I'll look forward to having this again..."
"Great beer that is far underated in my opinion. I typically find that the small bottles store better than the larger ones, but this is one fantastic trappist. highly recommended, and worth seeking out."
"This is a fine beer. For me this was reminiscent more of a wheat beer than a tripel."
"Again not at all what I would expect from a trappist. This is quite a drinkable brew. Not nearly as complex in flavor as some other Trappists. Nice and drinkable but maybe a bit too simple."
"The trappists have made better tripels but this one holds its own. I'll certainly come back to it another time."
"The main impression of this beer is yeast and canned pears. After reviewing four quite good brews, this one stayed with me. Kind of grew on me afterwards."
"Chilled and poured aggressively into watou goblet, nice thick one finger of creamy white head with excellent retention and a wall of marsh mellow cream lacing. Body is slightly hazy blond stray color with peach tones and warm high lights, tiny bubbles are present. Smells up front of light fruit esters pears, apple, maybe even kiwi, no banana or fruits from warmer fermentation ( this is my guess any how). I also get a little spice, maybe some white pepper, yeast is in there, hops are minimal needless to say great aromatic balance. Taste is crisp and refreshing with just enough carbonation to make it move, but not get annoying. Begins with a slight sweet spiced character, then a into a dry finish. This is very complex and subtle at the say time. All of the fruit esters are apparent in the taste and manifest in a great way. This beer is great to drink alone, but would also be wonderful with food maybe some cheese and crackers or a fish soup, or fish period, even meat and potatoes. Great stuff, solid for the style, so glad I tried it."
"In resume, this was a great surprise as it doesn't ""behave"" like your average blond beer. I really recomemnd this one."
"I am lucky enough to have tried beers from all the Trappist monk breweries in Europe that I know of, this is a long way from the best, but still a fine drink and I would certainly have another, but not tonight."
"Probably better on a hot day."
"Quite a way to start a day, one is plenty."
"D - The drinkability was ok, I couldn't see me having more than one of these. There are better trapist beers out there."
"ome people are not so keen on this Trappist so my expectations were turned down low. Systembolaget started to sell Achel in the first days of March, 2007 so I went down and got the 8% Blonde and the Bruin. It poured with a nice golden color, a little cloudy and with a thick, creamy head that remains there indefinately. The taste is fruity with a tinge of yeast and a lot of bread. It's actually very restrained for this style of beer. It's definately sweet and with some alohol coming through.A strong citric bite emerges at the end. All and all, I like this beer a lot since it synthesizes some tastes in beer that I enjoy."
"Drinkability: This not the most complex beer in the style but it is still very enjoyable. If it were either more nuanced or less alcoholic it would be more drinkable, but it's definitely easy to sip nonetheless."
"The beer pours a cloudy apricot with a lot of evervescence. There is a solid one inch white head on top. The aroma has hints or caramel with a lot of lemon and a hint of alcohol. The flavor has ripe fruit and malt flavors dominating. This triple is much more dry than many non-trappist tripels, which is a good thing. Some abbey and US 'tripels' are quite sweet and not as well attenuated. The mouthfeel is fairly light with a lot of carbonation on the tongue. My only complaint is the lack of yeast flocculation. I poured the beer very slowly and after half the bottle was in the glass, a lage lump of yeast splashed into the goblet and broke up into small lumps."
"D: I am glad I found a case of this beer, along with another kind from the same brewers. It is worth drinking, but I do not put it at the same level as the other Trappist brews. I will try their other products however. Good beer."
"What a chunky monkey. Man even out of the fridge the yeast was still suspended as I tried to pour carefully. Lovely yellow cloudy white capped beer with chunks a plenty. The smell is lovely soft phenol joy the malt a candy sweetness. The overall flavor is mighty it feels as though it melts into the tongue and awakens taste sensors I didn't know I had. Like eating soft barely candy flowers with a hint of alcohol and atouch of hop spice. Lovely stuff, just give me less chunks, but fuck it I can suffer the chunks ;)"
"It's not as outstanding as other Trappist ales, but still is a very nice Tripel and fits well with this great style."
"Drinkability: The bitterness is quite nice."
"This was chilled nicely and poured into a duvel tulip. The initial smell was a bit more bready and commercial smelling than I thought it would be. Luckily the taste was not. There was a beautiful almost ""junior grand cru"" taste to the malts in this beer. There was a nice casklike aged feel with just enough bitterness. The taste deepened with warming; however, it must be said that teh best thing about this beer is the champagne fine carbonation that lasts throughout. This creates fantastic dryness and terrific drinkability. Very nice indeed."
"Drinkability, see taste."
"Last swigs: Not regretable, edible, forgetable."
"Pours into the goblet cloudy dark peach with small creamy head, nice lace. Tough to get a clean pour on this one due to the very active floating yeast. Ended up swirling and pouring the yeast since it couldn't be avoided. Smells earthy, yeasty, slightly fruity (lemons). Rather big hop aroma for a Trappist. Flavor profile is unusual. Emphasizes musty earth, yeast, caramel, and hops rather than overt fruit. Tastes earthy and yeasty, with rough hops, a bit of bitter lemon funk and alcohol bite in the finish. Very creamy medium body, with only slight carbonation. Rugged and somewhat unrefined; an unusual and not entirely successful beer."
"I must say that although this is a delicious beer, the flavors didnt meld with each other as well as I had hoped."
"Slightly chunky mouthfeel, almost viscous, but not quite. Rather sweet with notes of raisins and starfruit accompanied by that bready yeast detectable in the aroma. Alcohol is apparent upon swirling in the mouth, and increases in intensity as the beer warms. An intriguing beer, worthy of the Trappist mark, though not truly exceptional."
"Very sweet in the mouth leaving just a slight bitter taste followed by the alcohol. Not too strong, but you know it's there."
"Definitely recommended."
"Overall, this is a darn good blonde, but out of some of the other trappist products, I think this one is outdone. However, it is definitely a quality brew in its own right. Recommended."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will definatly keep it stocked in my cellar all the time. It poured a dark maple brown color, with a small bubbly head that quickly dissolves into a nice ring around the glass with tiny bubbles all racing to the top. It smelled of ripe fruitm malty sweetness, smoked apple wood, and caramel. It tasted great complex and well balanced. Malty sweetness, ripe fruit, smoked applewood, and a nice smoky finish. This beer had a slick oily mouthfeel and it tasted great a definate good beer all around."
"A very good tripel....one to linger over."
"330 ml bottle, bought in Frederikshavn, Denmark. Hazy golden colour, huge white head. Fairly moderate but very nice spicy, wheaty and fruity aroma. Flavour is spicy / peppery and sweet, with distinct bitter hops, hints of oak. Warming mouthfeel, alcohol is evident but not dominant. Another good Trappist!"
"Overall: An excellent brew, beautifully balanced, very enjoyable."
"Pours with a beautiful, fluffy white head and a slightly cloudy pale malt body. Nice lacing. The aroma is quite interesting and complex -- light sugars, citrus and a minty note with a strange, salty-sea essence at lower temperatures. As the beer warms, it throws off more fruit, as expected. On the palate, Achel Blond is familiar and comforting. Slight tart sweetness starts things off, followed by some citric acidity laid over a wonderful bready malt character. The finish is sticky-sweet. Alcohol is a bit evident in the mouthfeel, but that's balanced by the high malt content. Overall, an excellent beer that's good in all the areas a beer should be good in."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp, effervescent bite that hits you after the yeasty notes."
"An interesting Trappist that deserves another time 'round for further contemplation."
"Overall, its very lively and enjoyable. However, I prefer the brune as the malt is a bit more interesting to me."
"Pours a orange/red hazy hue, nice thick billowy head that falls into taverns on top. Lots of belgian lacings up sides. Aroma is belgian yeast, ripe fruit of pears and bananas, and light lemon and grain. Low alcohol in nose. Belgian yeast flavor right off the bat. Wheaty mustiness. As aroma suggested, lols of ripe fruit of pears and plum. Citrus hops blended into sour grain undertones. Not very biting, but mellow as the frut flavors fill the palate. Nice med-high amount of carbonation, medium body, and finishes dry. Nice example of style... really like the pears."
"Achel Blond pours a beautiful golden color with a thick fluffy white head (way more foam than I wanted, and it was a slow pour - by my standards) from a brown 33 cl bottle. The aroma is estery, it smells much like I expect a tripel to taste. Tastes like a tripel should as well, although I'm somewhat at a loss to describe the flavors. Very tasty beer. Recommended."
"I highly recomend this Triple!"
"In the end this is a pretty fine Trappist blonde, well crafted and not overwhelming or over-bearing. I'll be picking up more to sip in the evenings now that the days are growing longer. An ideal ale to help herald in twilight with. Only one at a time for me though, the alcohol content is deceptive in regards to the flavour and mouthfeel. And the side of my chalice, now that this is all over and done with, is caked by a good even layer of sticky lacing."
"Taste was somewhat sweet, bitter and fruity, the amount of carbonation make the beer very refreshing. The typical Belgian funkiness is very much present and appears to be very similar to the Westmalle yeast strain, the only difference with a WM is the lower amount of bitterness and this one is less dry, but nevertheless a very good beer! Worth a try!"
"Not bad, but this one won't have me updating my list of favorite tripels. I like it better with the yeast in, and my score reflects that glass."
"A good tripel. I will revisit this one from time to time."
"Minty and hoppy aroma, as peaches, orange, pineapple and freshly cut tangeri ne, doughy malts and yeast lollop out of the pale orange body and well densed white head. Nice yeast character, particularly in the flavor, with soft fruits and floral hop flavors. Creamy texture. Great Belgian feel."
"Regardless, this is a nicely done Trappist tripel and is definitely worth buying again."
"Semi cloudy gold/orange color. Massive head over one-inch that remains for several minutes and never really disappears completely throughout the experience. Spiced fruit aroma, with notes of apple, citrus, cinnamon, and Belgian yeast. The taste is strong on fruity malt flavors, much like the aroma. Mild spice again present, alcohol does not seem very strong. Loads of carbonation, medium thickness with a decent smoothness. I very much enjoyed this trappist ale, not amazingly unique, but done well..."
"-Adam"
"d: This isn't a great beer, but enjoyable."
"The appearance is a golden orange with an extreme head. The taste is pleasantly light on the alcohol undertone and is grainy. After pouring in the large clumps of yeast, the taste was improved and the drink took on a more full body. The taste was also improved as the beer warmed but it didn't really become any more complex. This is a good beer but the taste isn't as unique as some other Trappist beers."
"flavor is fruity, a little spice, some yeast and a slight bitter tingle. tasty."
"33 cl bottle pours a murky dull orange with lots of floating particles, decent creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Caramel and cheese aromas, caramel candy,honey, toffee and chocolate flavors. Medium to full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry."
"The body has a medium feel. Carbonation is non-existent. Overall this disappointing trappist beer."
"The first taste was an explosion of light feeling sweetness on my tounge. A very powerful hop bitterness is present in the aftertaste. A slight taste of alcohol but not to noticeable very well hidden. A fine example of a Tripel."
"Drinkability: Very interesting brew; well-balanced blend of sweet and bitter tastes"
"D = Drinkable just damn expensive."
"No need to search this out. Just get Westmalle tripel, it'll save you money and effort. You'll have a much better beer."
"Drinkability: Three words: Too. Damn. Expensive. $9 for a 11.2 ounce bottle? Yipes. Otherwise, a nice trip, although Westmalle still reigns supreme in my book."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" bright white head over the nearly opaque golden brew, I know, seems like an impossibility, but there you go. Head lasts nicely, and the lacing is thin and delicate, yet ample at the same time. Aroma is spicy Belgian malts, with some sugar and alcohol present. Taste is an almost spiced wheat sweetness, with a touch of citrus at the outset. Mouthfeel puts it all together with smooth and creamy, and drinkability is also very nice. A great find."
"The head is thick, just off-white, still and bumpy it floats on the hazy, dirty, peach-gold body. The aroma is huge: sweet, alcoholic with yards of thick caramel. Alcohol up front when cool, with some sour fruit, cream and caramel. The middle is thick and foamy. Much caramel, some milk, some more sour fruit extends through the finish, where some great, big bubblegum makes a surprise appearance. Tangtacular aftertaste. Wow. Absolutely gargantuan flavors: sour fruit, sweet caramel, bubblegum finish. Dee L. Icious!"
"Flavors well blended with warming white pepper letting the peach and melon emerge. Full body and smooth velvet mouthfeel make great sipping. Initial sweetness is dried well by the finish with a little pepper and spice aftertaste."
"Drinkability- Ahhh, the trappist that gets no play. Well, believe it everyone, this brew is worth some praise."
"Another great tripel, very very good"
"Very drinkable brew, although I found myself sipping it to enjoy it."
"Very drinkable."
"I was not disappointed with this beer, and yes I would have another."
"Clear golden colour, generous rocky white head with thick lacing and good retention. Nice balance of aromas with lemony citrus, malty sweetness and light clove spice. Sweet flavour to start, along with cloves and fruit. Some doughy malt and a light bitterness. Great balance and complexity. Strong alcohol warming at the finish. Medium body with moderately high carbonation and a mousse-like texture. Great beer!"
"Pours a lightly hazy gold-orange color, it is topped by a frothy tan head. I get aromas of pineapple, apples and tangerines with follow on notes of caramel, a hint of butterscotch and a rich malty note. The aroma is quite nice a mix of tropical fruit notes and malt. The beer is dry and spicy up front with a finish that has hints of acidity and hop bitterness, as well as a slight alcohol burn. There is a peppery carbonic note here at the beginning that is quite nice and prickly, though this is certainly not highly carbonated, just nicely so. There are some fruity notes of pears, apples and a hint of tropical fruit, which is almost the reverse order and intensity that the notes are in the nose. The beer is also not quite as rich as the nose would suggest, it is quite light and easily quaffable, even for an 8% beer."
"Poured carefully into a belgian glass, this is a hazy orange color with a finger of head that fades pretty quickly and a few chunks of yeast that got into the glass. Smells like pears, cloves, yeast, and candied apples. Taste is better than the smell---spices, butterscotch, doughy malt, sweet fruit, citrus, slight alcohol, slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is dry and refreshing. Overall, this is a solid beer, but just doesn't have the complexity in flavor/aroma that other tripels have."
"Drinkability - outstanding beer worthy of any self-respecting BA's palate at least once."
"I found the mouthfeel to be a bit light for the style, and the high price and abv hurt the drinkability, but this is a damn fine brew."
"Poured a golden orange with a heavy presence of yeast. A decent head was created leaving a dplotchy lacing. Nose is of fruity malts. Taste leans towards a hint of apple in the malts with a nice dry hopped finish. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing, lively and full-very nice. Overall drinkabillity is good. The 8% ABV is well hidden in the taste of this brew. Probably overpaid for this beer but it was definitely tasty!"
"Drinkability: Not sure if this beer has bowled me over. Actually somewhat bland in comparison to other tripels."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange, turning translucent as the beer thins out. Smell is very sweet, mostly rich with a citrus smell. There is a cloudy haze which settles on the bottom of the glass once it is settled. The taste is surprisingly flat despite the extra large head that appeared when it was poured. Taste doesn't really come in till it is swallowed, when it turns into a sour citrus which resonates with too much alcohol."
"Medium bodied."
"Achel 8 Blond fits somewhere between good and very good for me. I'd love to drink it side by side with a few other quality tripels to tease out the relevant differences and nail down my preferences regarding this style once and for all. In the final reckoning, I'll grant it 'just short of greatness' status. Rest assured, I'll be giving it plenty of chances to change my mind for the better."
"Another great trappist ale. I wish I could find these beers more often."
"Drinkability and Overall: It has the potential, but doens't fulfill it. Not bad, but not a very good representation of what can come from a Trappist brwery, in my opinion. Still, a decent brew."
"This was past due. I got it that way in the trade, but didn't have time to check the bottle. Not much in the way of taste. Inconsistent taste, carbonation, eggshells, yeast. Not quite skunked, but getting there. Salty. Blonde orange with initial overflow. Some sediment that was creamy."
"Pours to a golden orange color with a thick white head. The aroma is yeasty and peppery, with a doughy maltiness, and fruit at the end. It flavor is spicy and peppery, with a bready maltiness, and a yeasty twang. Easy drinking with a lighter mouthfeel. A nice beer."
"Pours a honey golden, with almost no head, somewhat murky with lots of floaty yeasties. Aroma- honey, sweet flowers, light caramels, maybe a slight citrus note. Flavor is a sharp bite not expected from the aroma, with a bit of alcohol. I keep saying that about tripels, I love them (my favorite style), but they keep surprising me that the flavor is different than the aroma. Doesn't stop me from loving them, though... Mouthfeel is creamy, sweet & flavorful."
"i will have another, if someone buys it for me"
"Pours hazy, very pale gold with a rich head of 2 fingers. Good retention and excellent lacing. Smells are a bit toned down, but light accents of fruits (apples and bananas) with mildy yeasts in the nose. Fruitiness and yeasts mix well in the taste to create smooth and creamy textures. Also, packs a nice alcohol content. The alcohol taste mingles well with the rest so it isn't gross or out of place. A very good and enjoyable brew."
"I like this brew, but thats probably because i like trappist beer. not as good as the brown brew of this though."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with an exceptional thick, white head (left a beautiful lacing on the glass as well). The smell was probably the least impressive of its traits. Almost smelled like a Coors Light. Everything else about this beer is wonderful, but at such a steep price tag, I wouldn't recommend more than a single sampler."
"33 cl bottle. 04 and '04 notches."
"Tried a bottle of this tasty concoction at the Blind Tiger in NYC. Its a new one on their bottle list. Poured a typical Belgian shade of light golden, hazy/cloudy, with a puffy, silky white head, leaving some fine lacing. Nose was all nuts, yeast, fruity. taste is boldly tripel, all the way. Fruity, yeasty notes, pleasing on the tongue and quick to the cranium. Very soft and silky mouthfeel. Finishes dry with more fuit and some spice adding to the mix."
"Poures a pale yellow with a a light orange tint with chunks and floaties abound (I poured to hard ) with a creamy head that leaves a light amount of lace,spicey aroma some cinnamon and apple going on with a light smokiness going on very appetizing.Taste is phenolic in its smokiness with a nice apple pie flavor spicey and some apple tartness not any alcohol burn like alot of tripels finishes smooth.A real drinkable ale for the style with alot of nice flavors not overly complex but very solid."
"Ejoying it last sunday at the monestary from tap and now again in from the botle in my trappist bokaal. Goot to great apearance; nice colour, foam and brightness and willing to go out( litle gushing that i noted earlier so I mad sure this time but its there). Pooring it in fast made no problem so the enjoyment could begin, nice nose with smooth& fine hops, litle fruit of the yeast and some alcoholdamps. Nice and dry tast with a just bitter enough aftertaste."
"IMHO: A very one-dimensional beer. The tart overwhelms the other more subtle features. I do not think that it is a good representation of a triple, but it is different. Has a nice warming effect as it goes down."
"Tiny thing film of a head is off-white in color. Fruity, appley aroma is joined by some mild spices. Hazy, apricot colored beer. Light apple flavor balanced by a creamy/yeasty maltiness, followed by a pinch of bitterness. Alcohol takes over towards the end leaving your stomach warm. Smooth carbonation makes for a nice mouthfeel. Easy to drink, solid beer."
"Orange-yellow body and fluffy white head that slowly settles out to a thin film. I'm getting cantaloupe, phenolic cloves, and orange bubble gum with a bit of lemon zest. Peppery spice tingles the nose a bit. Slightly plastic flavor is sweet up front, herbal and clove-like in the middle, and surprisingly dry and bitter through the finish. Somewhat raw -- like eating bread with thick chunks of seed still in it. You know it's good for you, and you don't really mind it -- but it still jars you a bit. A solid, drier-than-some tripel."
"Poured a hazy gold color which had a very thick head that was fluffy and white, leaving behind nice lace. Aroma is very citrussy with a lemon scent and a flat chalky yeastiness. Taste has a nice hop bitterness up front which segues into a lemony hop flavor with sweet, light malt and a generous amount of alcohol. The body of this ale is nearly perfect as the carbonation has very little carbonic bite while the light moughtfeel lends smoothness and a dry finish. A nice Belgian Tripel though i have had better."
"This one poured a huge frothy head with laced the glass until I was finished. The color is a brownish orange and smells yeasty like bread with a hint of orange peal. The flavor is spicy at first and a little orange is hidden in there. It feels very light on the tongue, with a watery finish. The alcohol is present throughout. Overall the flavors are subtle leading to a good mark for drinkability."
"This is an easy, cream-flavored ale. The nose offers butterscotch, baked apple, banana, vanilla and milk while the palate displays whipped cream-like textures, roasted nuts, biscuity grain and more vanilla. Never does the alcohol seem evident and whatever hop component there is is strictly in the background for bitterness. Its closest competition would seem to be St. Bernardus Tripel, only that this is less vinous and wild tasting. Beautifully balanced and clean - this is clearly suitable for trappist beer initiates."
"Mouthfeel: This"
"Pours out a nicely nice blond amber with a large robust head. Tastes of sweet and a nose of fruit with a slight blend of spice just to round things out. Hops add some perfect balance. This is a wonderfully crafted brew which perhaps lies above my total beer grasp. Smooth to the mouth adds to the drinkability."
"Notes: Very nice beer. It is sweet and a little bitter. I really enjoyed this beer. An awsome trappist drink!"
"I really like this and other than the higher alcohol content find it very drinkable although it was hard to find. Another excellent Trappist brew."
"Appearance: Deep golden slightly hazy sunshine hue nice creamy fine bubbled head leaves detailed Belgian lacing. Aroma: Candi sugar lnes layers of sweet pale malts nice fruity undertones some tropical notes with a kiss of hops. Taste: Nice fairly mild overall flavor, sweet candi sugar some fruity undertones and bubblegum with evident alcohol leaves me quite underwhelmed. Mouthfeel: Medium body fine effervescent carbonation, not bad. Drinkability: Nice but for a trappist ale and eight dollars for the bottle I want more, not only do I want more but I expect more."
"Hazy pale yellow in hue with vague gold highlights, it looks ghostly, a rocky white of a finger in height lasted for a moment before dissipating to a soapy residue. The subsequent lacing was disorganized, pocked, but prevalent. The nose was rather lively with tart and funky, citrusy lemon grass upfront. Then a note of distant pepper, cloves, and a good amount of herbs can be found in the middle, the finish shows the alcohol and yeast. I like the potency but the aromas dont really mix that well, each seemed a little too naked. I feared the palate would be harsh, it wasnt, I mean, wow, this is like night and day! The palate is soft and well rounded; yes there is a raw alcohol burn at the end but the medley of apples, pears, citrus fruits, hay, grass, cloves, dates, earthiness, bready maltiness and yeast really propel the flavors in a tasty direction. It manages to be complex yet kind of straightforward, does that make sense? So what, it does to me. The taste is enjoyable but I dont think this is an outstanding Triple. Medium in body with low and natural carbonation, kind of airy, Id say the mouthfeel is quite agreeable. I found this to be plenty quaffable but I wont go out of my way for more. It was costly for one thing. I bought my 11.2-ounce bottle in Iowa City. It is worth trying."
"Taste: sweetness itself, with just a dash of citric sour at the edges, but overall, fruity, peach, apricot, orange. Zesty, with sour citric character returning, but not dominating. Hops dance delicately, and malt is assuredly around to provide a plush pillow for the tastebuds. A really well-integrated brew, any initial harshness is soon mellow-fied, and ease of drinkability is ensured. Mild, all in all, for sure, but that's really what the style is all about. Very smooth, I could imagine downing this aplenty, if it weren't for the cost. Really, to smooth out financial matters, the only thing to do is actually become a monastic brother, and drink this stuff for free, aye, that's what I ought to do..."
"11.2 oz bottle that is past its prime, according to the label. Really didn't know what I had here until I poured it. A hazy, honey colour in the St Bernardus goblet. Chunks of yeast obscure any sight of bubbles. Leaves nice chains of Belgian lacing all over the goblet. Aroma is typical Belgian, with pink grapefruit and baked bread in the spotlight. Cloves and allspice also share top billing. Mouthfeel is thick, almost chewy, and is tart and bitter. Hops make more than a cameo appearance. Taste is complex, with biscuity yeast, sharp citrus, and bitter hops. Not what I was looking for in a Tripel. The yeast chunks settle to the bottom at room temperature, but the taste remains bitter. This is not one of the better Belgian ales I've had over the years. Maybe a fresher one would change my opinion."
"Overall Impression: This is the first Achel product I've tried and I'm quite impressed. If the rest are as good (or better), then I might have a contender for my new favorite Trappist brewery here. Could it be that the youngest Trappist brewery is giving the old stalwarts a run for their money?"
"Poured from the classic 11.2 oz Belgian bottle, it's gold with a foamy white head that leaves swirling traces on top of the beer. Even with a careful pour, prodigious chunks of yeast are left floating around. The smell is candy sugar, spice, notes of crisp fruit, and a pleasant alcohol aroma. The taste is everything a tripel should be, with a nice dose of yeast rounding things out. Thanks to the gents at the monastary."
"Notes: Fantastic. This beer is a dream come true for me. Has all the characteristics of a good hefeweizen but with the complexity of a tripel. Unbelievable."
"This one pours a cloudy honey caramel color with little bits of yeasty goodness float about. A big white fades slowly leaving a good amount of lace in its wake. A damp earthy smell and aroma of yeast and hops lasts fairly long. The malt is a bit bread doughy. A wide variety of flavors emerge. Sweet sugar, yeast, coriander, orange zest, caramel and alcohol are all quite separate and distinct. The overall effect reminds me of a mixed drink, named Perfect John (2 fl oz Vodka, 1 fl oz Triple Sec Curacao and 4 fl oz Orange Juice). This is a highly underrated Triple...IMHO."
"Opened this one to celebrate the finish of a semester-long project. Not a bad tripel...not up there amongst the best yet, though. Then again, Westmalle has been making tripels for 100 years, while Achel hasn't for even 5, so I'm sure they can improve the recipe and make this a true classic. I'd probably have this one again!"
"Hazy golden appearance. Slight, but frothy and dense, white head lays on top. Lacing is full and in sheets. Soft malt tones blend with some great yeasty bready tones and fruity esters to create a very nice smelling experience. Onto the taste. The flavors are quite delicate. And there's barely a trace of alcohol in the flavor. Breadcake. Yeast. Dough. Pepper. All blend quite nicely. The mouthfeel is very attractive. Smooth and velvety. Easy drinking. I could view this as a session beer. It's that easy to drink. The only problem is that a session of 14 of these would cost me close to $100. No thanks. Good beer nonetheless."
"Poured with a tall, thick head and a hazy golden body. Lots of carbonation to be seen and plenty of yeast floaters. The smell had a lot of substance to it, with a buttered popcorn aroma prevailing. The taste was also very substantial, and I'll be damned if I didn't taste a little broccoli. Not nasty, TV dinner broccoli though... more like mamma's home cooked broccoli smothered in cheese sauce. Ok, the cheese sauce part I made up, but it's still one of the more flavorful tripel's I've had."
"Pours a light hazy golden-numerous chunks-attractive lace that leaves a delicate and rather elegant stick pattern. Aromas are very appealing! Light lemony citrus followed by creamy peach like sweetness, and a big hint of the malt-o-meal to come.And, boy is this a delicious malty beer! I've found a malt that my taste buds adore! Exceptional crispness helps balance this brew out. Served with baked cod-crabmeat stuffing-baked the cod surrounded by yukon gold potato wedges, and covered with a Mornay sauce. Man the malty flavors of the beer, and the complex tastes of the seafood continue on in a long glorious finish!"
"What is wrong with the brewer and the importers of this beer? This is not identified as either blond or brune on the bottle, anywhere. The goal is to put your drinkers in a bad mood before they pour a glass?"
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"I think I'm starting to like this Belgian stuff, as this beer impressed me with its strong malty flavors. The couldy golden body had a nice thin head and laced well. The overall nose screamed malts and offered little in the way of alternatives except perhaps for a bit bready yeasts and some hint of citrus hops. Thickly bodied, but not quite over the top, it could get there on any brew run. As with many goods foods and drinks, the body can only handle so much of a good thing, i.e., I'd like to drink more but can't."
"Hazy golden hue with a frothy white head. Retention is excellent and lacing is impressive, permeating the chalice glass with firm rings. Nose is fresh with notes of pear, kiwi, earthy hops, crisp malt and a hint of alcohol. Flavors include herbal, mildly bitter hops, passion fruit, apple, yeast and mild rushes of alcohol and sugar on the finish. Complex, but by all means drinkable. Smooth, full-bodied, and relatively creamy mouthfeel works well. The alcohol content does show itself a bit too much for this to be considered overly quaffable. A quality Trappist ale, to be certain, serve this at cellar temperature to discover the abundant flavors lurking within."
"Drinkability  I thought the hops were too prevalent for the style, but this is an all around nice beer to drink"
"Poured a pale yellow gold haze color. Started off with a full sticky foam that was white in color, but fell shortly after to a small film on the top. Some lace was present and had a sticky quality to it. Sediment was noticeable all through the glass and in the bottle. Mental note: pour carefully. The aromas that came from the glass were of spicy yeast, bread, citrus, sweet malt, bananas coriander and cloves. Fairly sweet in the nose and it was soft in nature. As for taste, I experienced flavors of sweet malt, honey, spices (cloves), yeast, fruits (banana, citrus), bread, slight bitter hop and a small hint of alcohol. It finished on the dry side. Nice blend of spicy/sweet and dry flavors. Body was on the creamy medium side. This beer had characteristics of complexity, when it came to its combination of flavors and the balance they took on, and it is very easy to drink as well, considering the alcohol level of 8%. I rather enjoyed it, and would drink again."
"When pourred into glass the head quickly dissipate but reveal a beautiful cloudy golden ale. Smells of hopps and yeast emerge from this beer with a very sweet finish. Very fine trappist beer. Hides very well the strong alcohol taste. Can go wrong with this brew"
"There was a medium white creamy head with fine-medium bubbles when this brew was poured into my glass. The body was a cloudy gold color. The lacing was excellent on the sides of my glass. There was carbonation observed with this brew. The aroma was citrusy and spicy. There was no aftertaste with this brew and the taste was relatively smooth."
"Originally sampled on 15 September 2002. Achel 8 is a clear, yellow-gold ale, with a large frothy head & lots of champagne-like bubbles. It has a slighty fruitness w/ an overall well balanced flavor. Very nice, but not one of the world class Belgians."
"This brew pours a large head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a very carbonated cloudy blonde body. It has a mild but very plesent aroma of malt, hop and floral scents. Its palate is smooth but fizzy at first then settles. Its flavor is mild with slightly complex flowery notes mixed with yeast and bread."
"Light gold color. Smallish head. Aroma is floral and honey. A nice Belgian Blonde. Typical Belgian flavors, yeasty, spicy and fruity. Yeast and malty. Very complex flavor. Light and refreshing. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"This beer pours a very bright, but cloudy yellow with lots and lots of floaties hovering about. It has a very sweet aroma hinting of fruits. The taste is very full and reminds me of a weiss beer. I really didn't enjoy the taste much because the wheaty flavor is not something that I have ever grown accustomed to. I couldn't drink very much of this just because I really don't like the flavor."
"-F"
"A thank you goes to MJR for sending me this beer and giving me the opportunity to try it..."
"beer but its playing with the big boys from Belgium."
"Notes: This reminds me of Westmalle Tripel in a way though I much more prefer Westmalle, this is a good tripel but I am just not as impressed."
"Drinkability: Scary... I went through this one really quickly. If I could get this stuff in six-packs at a good price, it would be downright dangerous! Not one of the best trappists, but still quite tasty."
"I sampled this at a beer tasting event from a 750 mL bottle. It poured to give a hazy, straw colored beer with little foam. The smell was fruity (banana and pear) and malty. The taste was light and fruity (grapes) with a moderate amount of malt flavor. The mouthfeel was clean and crisp. The drinkability was very good. This ale was very refreshing."
"This beer poured a light cloudy gold color and formed a nice foamy head that left circular lace. A small bit of carbonation is present. It had an aroma of malt, clove and citrus. The flavor was of malt, citrus and banana. The finish was a touch tart. Not a bad beer for this style."
"The pour is a hazy golden yellow, the head mighty in size, creamy in texture and bright white in color, the lace clings to the glass in thick sheets. Nose is bubble gum, lime like tones, malt sweet also quite clean and appealing. Front is sweet, the top is skimpy; the finish is considerate in its acidity, graciously hopped with the aftertaste dry and kindly bitter, nice drinking beer."
"Slightly hazy appearance but with a bone white fluffy head. Aromas of floral hops and fruity esters. The taste of this beer is so damn complex it makes me shiver just thinking about it. First it has the classic wheat flavors of clove an banana, then you notice the hops, then a slight chocolate and cinnamon flavor invades, then a slight prune fruitiness, and finally the floral and earthy hop flavor lingers on your tounge. It is a little sweet but the late hop charge balances it nicely. When I had it at the Bier Circus in Brussels, I wanted to dive into the glass and drown a happy man. THE best beer I had in Belgium. Don't know why the lackluster reviews here - maybe it doesn't travel well? It was head and shoulders better than the Westmalle triple and was definitely not light in mouthfeel - in fact it was very creamy."
"Bright, clear gold body with white bubbly head. Dancing streams of bubbles twist upward in the glass. I didn't realize the Trappist monks knew what filtration was, but this manages to be an attractive beer anyway (although I had to knock the score down a bit because of the lackluster head. Yeasty aroma is subdued but still there. Flavor is spiced citrus. This is a nice, light enjoyable beer. Some similar belgians have a dry cottony moutfeel that I don't like, but this has a wetter moutfeel that makes it much easier to drink and quite refreshing."
"Quite a potent little brew, hazy orange appearance, with bits of sediment here and there (i docked .5 of appearance for that), smells a bit sweet, but very strong, good bittering on the finish, i got things like apricot, apple in the flavour. Very nice but potent, goes straight to your head."
"Bright golden in color.  Slight citrus and sweetness on the nose and can definatly smell the maltyness.but richer and fuller than most of your sweet trips."
"Like Matt Maples, I was expecting something a bit different than what I actually got.  It was described as a 'Tripel, well sort of' so I had some odd ideas in my head.  Anyhoo, this ale was pale golden and fairly clear.  It had a decent head, which left a fair amount of lace as the beer retreated to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma was much hoppier than I expected, with undertones of grain - almost hay-like.  The taste was crisp and clean, with nice (but not overpowering) hop flavor.  There was also a malty sweetness and a bit of yeast present as well.  All in all, a good refreshing beer."
"It is fruity, citrusy, sweet, and more hoppy than other Belgians. Golden in color and a wonderfully rocky head.  What really threw me was the level of hop bittrerness for a Belgian. I must say that my expectations got in the way. I was expecting something totaly awsome and what I got was a good beer. I would bet good money that when fresh that it has a lot more hop flavor than I got out of this one (I mostly just got bitterness). As my review stadns it is a good but rather uniquely bitter Belgian Trappist."
