"O- Great drinking Tripel with exceptional flavour and aroma. Wish I could get this more often than I can."
""
""
""
""
""
"3/30/15 (Bottle) - Hazy golden pour, slight white head, some carbonation. Lemon, yeast and malt among the pleasant aromas. Very crisp clean feel, nice lemon, malt, citrus and banana flavors. Very smooth, and I'm glad I selected this Tripel. Cheers!"
""
"It's a world class beer."

"Overall - (Bows down to the smiling monk and utters good fortunate for St. Bernadrus beer being so good). A true treat and probably the best tripel I've ever had. Worth every penny. A must try for craft beer lovers and probably anybody who enjoys trying some new."

""
""
""
"This is, in my opinion, the perfect example of a Belgian Tripel."
""
"Gold hazy body with plenty of sediment floating around. Pillow white head at least two fingers worth and stays for a long time.Tangy tart bitter taste. Lemon and bread too.Peppery on the tongue. Creamy feel in the finish."
"Light colored amber, smooth, touch of ripe citrus fruit"

"Very nice Tripel.  Not sure worth what I paid at my local beer store, but very nice indeed.  Great, but only at the right price.  Think I paid about 13 bucks for a bottle listed at 1 pint, 9.4 oz."
""
"Not too different from a good pilsner.  This does not support the prestige or justify value."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all, it's a solid Tripel. Part of me likes how more of the malt and grainy aspects come forward, but doesn't abandoned it's fruity yeast, and simplifies. Part of me sees it as a bit tamer then expected. Two thumbs up still despite this, mainly because the beer still has it pretty all together."

""
""
"O:  A delight.  Glad I finally got to try this gem."
""
"Hoppy start but the finish is smooth."
""
""
""
""
"O: A sure favorite when looking for fruity - I will definitely come back to this."
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.66, a fantastic A+. St. Bernardus Tripel is one of the best examples of its style that I have yet tried, and a much more robust, satisfying brew than their Watou Tripel (also included in this sampler). It's a pleasure to drink, and I'm saddened by the fact that I probably won't be able to procure any more without engaging in a road trip or border crossing. Positively outstanding, and quite possibly my favourite St. Bernardus beer of all."
""
"A tantalizing aroma and taste profile on this, upfront fruitiness and rustic notes yield a great depth of yeasty esters and malt notes. The aroma I found to a bit overwhelming in terms of overripe fruit initially but overall I have to say this was a superb tripel with nice balance and didn't flaunt its strength but remains a keenly drinkable and satisfying trappist ale. Well deserved reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've yet to find a St.Bernardus beer that I don't like - whilst this isn't quite in the same league as, say, the Abt 12, it's still about as good an example of a tripel as you'll find. Definitely worth the effort."

"o: an excellent belgian tripel.  seems very textbook, which means it is delicious"
""

"O:  A great Tripel.  Will have against when I can afford it."
"Sensational. Wonderful soft yeast are which melts perfectly into the malts. Long and nicely-balanced finish."

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, best before 11/21/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, honey, candi sugar, bread, pepper, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, peach, pineapple, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible tripel style! All around amazing complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  Well crafted and dangerously drinkable.  A solid Belgian ale and a bit sweeter for a Tripel than I was expecting, but quite nice.  I could easily have had another.  Went well with medium-rare duck and salad."
""
""
""
""
""
"The same thing applies to the taste, floral, grassy notes define the first impression. The processed hops aren't particularly bitter, but they do confirm the spices of the brew outstandingly well, adding a lot more character to the beer, than the usual Tripel would allow. Spiciness has a semi-dry note to it, while peppers, cinnamon, ripe banana, pear and apple, as well as burned caramel shine through. Includes also an earthy, herbal coordinate, close to a Saison, which gets detectable during the slightly bitter finish, accompanied by soft, slightly slick yeast."

"Pours a hazy amber with dense creamy white head, settles slowly to a thin layer, rings of lace down the glass. Smell: lightly sugary and bready, pear, coriander and spicy hop notes. Taste: pear, cooked green apple, clove and coriander, grassy and grainy, lemon honey cough drop, pear and baking spices in the finish."

"Poured a medium golden color, with about one finger of head, which doesn't last long. Aroma reminded me of golden raisins. The taste also has that flavor, with a mild bitterness from the hops balancing it out. Has a moderately thick mouth feel with noticeable carbonation. Quite expensive, but quite enjoyable."

"Overall: This is a text book example of a tripel. No alcohol burn. Not as sour as the aroma tells. This is a very good brew. Recommended."

"11.2 oz bottle dated 6/2/17.  Poured in St. Bernardus chalice.  Golden color, with medium head that doesn't last very long.  Smells very pleasant; sweet fruits and spices.  The taste is great, even though mild alcoholic hints are evident.  Citrus flavor, with other fruit notes.  Carbonation is on the high side.  Overall, very good."

"Poured from bottle dated 25.08.16, 11.2 oz into tulip. Deep gold as noted by most reviewers. I did get the spicy, mildly estery nose (some noted no or limited esters). Head white, fairly quick dispersal. Taste was, for me, true-to-form tripel with citrus-spice up front and yeasty in finish with very mild aclohol. Mouthfeel was pretty full-bodied with a more aggressive carbonation than it looked like it would give. Citrus lingers on tongue for awhile. Keeper, will buy more."

"An unremarkable tripel which does not stand out from the crowd."
""
""

"One of the best tripels. Not as good as Westmalle, though. Mild smell and taste, could be more intensive, but refreshing."

"Overall, a classic tripel that is right near the top of my favorites in the style. In fact it's close enough that I'd probably have to do a side-by-side with the others that standout in my mind to really have a good idea on which was my favorite. Sometimes, it's refreshing to know that such an well-done beer can be picked up on the shelf of about any liquor store you could walk into at any point in time."

"Overall - Great zesty/peppery flavour and a nice mix of fruity notes. This is world class stuff for sure. One of the better tripels I've had so far."

"Poured a bottle obtained from a St. Bernardus mixed pack (I wish more Belgian breweries did this) into a goblet. A live pour, although dropping the bottle on the floor first probably didn't help matters, with a ton of white froth that settled out to a more reasonable level. The beer itself presents as a cloudy honey yellow, with an aroma of shortbread, medicinal honey, apples, pears, woody/spicy Belgian yeast a plenty. The taste was more assertive than the smell, with an unusual and interesting butterscotch chip backbone, vanilla brownie, some grape-like lager character, tobacco, candied citrus rind, rosewater, a sweetish nuttiness, and sour green fruit all revealing themselves in a bit of a hodgepodge. Resembles its stablemate Watou Tripel in being on the sweet side for the style, although this one does have more heft in terms of both aromatic alcohol presence and a richer malt character. A touch thicker than other tripels and less fizzy as well. Nevertheless finishes on the dry side despite the initial sweetness, producing a tannic puckering effect on the mouth and thrusting some woody and gooseberry-like hops out there near the end. I like to compare my tasting notes to those of Micheal Jackson whenever possible, both as a reality check and a form of hero worship. In Great Beers of Belgium, he's got this one down as ""vanilla, cookies, and sesame seeds, with a tangerine-like finish"". I guess I did alright."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good tripel, although not the best. I prefer a Westmalle or Rochefort over this due to the mouth feel, but that's extremely subjective on my part. Overall a good example of a tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very drinkable tripel. lot of flavor and a mellow 8 percent. good amt of citrus, grape, apple flavors. lot of carbonation and mellow spicy yeast notes. all melded together perfectly, very elegant drink. not a very harsh tripel at all, while still being complex and interesting"

"Great complex Tripel, quite elegant, that’s how a Tripel should taste like. No sharp edges as most Tripels, even though I did leave this to mature for quite a while."
""

"This is an excellent Belgian tripel. Very traditional, relatively complex, extremely smooth. One of the better versions I have had, and another great beer from this brewery."

"on tap at the bull and bush, they have really put in a lot of guest taps recently, including a lot of higher end belgian stuff, very cool. this is one of the classics, a great example of the style, and one of my personal favorites because of its relative lack of sweetness compared to its peers. hazy and very pale straw in color, with a smaller head than i was hoping for, but still close to an inch of lasting white airy foam. it smells floral from the yeast, like little white and purple meadow flowers, and a rather high dose of oats along with the wheat and barley in the grain bill. lots of body and just a touch of residual sugar. long grainy start turns into a dry yeasty finish, classic belgian yeast fruit esters pop all over the place, and prickly carbonation makes 8% abv feel dangerously light. its a classic recipe, a classic yeast strain, and a real artisan product that is rooted in tradition and timeless in flavor. this is one of my favorites because of its dryness. it doesnt sacrifice any body to get there either. light fruitiness is left on the tongue after the swallow, and a 750ml of this would not be too much for me in a sitting."
""
""
"Rich and succulent, must try"
""
""
"O - Probably my favorite tripel thus far. I'm finding that I prefer dubbels and quads, but this one is right up there. Highly recommend. Consumed at cellar temp + about 15 minutes sitting at room temp before opening."
""
"Overall: A very interesting beer all the way through. Despite the high ABV it remains mellow and balanced, which makes for a very good experience. No wonder this is one of the best rated Tripels out there."
"O-Overall a great tripel, hides the ABV well, a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More bitter than expected. The estery profile is very complex, and the peppery finish is nice, but it tends to overwhelm."
""
""
"Tripels are not my favorite style at all (I prefer Dubbels and Quads), but occasionally I do like to try styles I don't ordinarily seek out. I'm very glad I tried this one. I should probably do a side-by-side with Westmalle and La Fin du Monde, two other Tripels I think very highly of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great tripel!"
""
""
""
""
"Bright glowing honey-gold color. Surprisingly small white head fades quickly to barely anything. Not all the yeast is poured in but some discernible tiny suspended chunks are visible. Aroma is phenolic with clove, flowery, bubblegummy, and fruity with orange, lemon, cherry, and apple cider. Sweet drippy maltiness, bready, toffee, and butterscotch-like. Nice and soft, yet certainly substantial. Flavors are sugar cookie dough, peppery spice, lemon, floral, alcohol, and light candied caramel. Nice slick, semi-syrupy/viscous softly coating texture. Body is a full, frothy medium. A heavy kind of medium. Very fine, softly fizzy carbonation, and well disguised bitterness and dryness elongated throughout the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a great Tripel. Stands with the best of them but does quite enough to stand out from the rest of them. From there, it's just a matter of taste."
""
""
""
"O-A world class brew. For me St. Bernardus Tripel is an acquired taste, but that doesn't deter from it's greatness. Too clean and medicinal on the smell and taste, like my glass had the residue of dish washing liquid in it or something. But the yeast is a treat. It gives the beer a beautiful look, unique taste and produces super foam to swish around leaving you enjoying every last bubble, every last drop. Belgium is the mecca of beer."
""

"O: Not their best beer, but certainly not their worst, and an excellent example of the style. Very tasty."

"Me impressionei com essa tripel. Eu estava esperando menos e encontrei um grande cerveja. Seu excessivo amargor me agradou e eu gostei de sua rusticidade. Acredito que ela seja uma respeitável tripel, que agrega muito valor para a cervejaria St. Bernardus."
""
""
"One that I quite enjoyed and one that despite the strength went down quite easily thanks to the good balance between fruits and the lively carbonation. I was expecting the beer to be a good one and it didn't disappoint and despite the fact the finish was a dry one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-One of the better Tripels I have tried. I shouldn't be surprised, it's a classic for those who lose the style. The depth of the beer's maltiness was by far the biggest takeaway for me."

""

"Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet: Thick white foamy head that faded slowly into a thick white top and sticky lacing over a cloudy orangish liquid with noticeable yeasties settling to the bottom. Smells like a triple should with nothing in particular standing out: yeast esters/tropical fruit and perfectly balanced hops and malt. Tastes like banana kiwi, citrus, slightly more bitter than sweet (which is good!), slightly spicy. It's soft and fuzzy, like a delicious pillow in your mouth (which is also a good thing!). Better than some trapist triples. Overall, a fantastic beverage from a fantastic brewery."
"O: Overall, this was dog gone good. An excellent example of a tripel but it was quite pricey."

"O - Disappointing but by no means bad, St. Bernardus Tripel is just a lackluster beer swimming in a sea of other aromatic, vibrant, and elegant tripels, all chock full of character and life. This beer seems faded and boring by comparison, though mainly in flavor."
""
""
""
"This tripel is really fantastic. It's fruity, light, and highly drinkable."
"O: One spicy tripel. One of the spiciest I've had. Lots of great belgian yeast flavors in this one. Well balanced flavors, crisp and easy drinking. Great brew."

"Well balanced, especially for 8% alcohol. Any alcoholic nose is absent with only a slight aftertaste of alcohol. medium bodied with a touch of spice. Nice mouthfeel and head retention. Balance is the keyword for this beer. No noticeable flaws or otherwise outstanding positive characteristics. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not great in my opinion. Certainly worthy of a try, but there are several Tripels I enjoy more than this one."
"This beer is good and I would get it again. I was expecting it to be a little bit better after trying the quad of the same brand. That beer is definitely superior."

"A fine, fine Tripel but I think it misses the depth and complexity of it's sister the Watou Tripel. I just find that one much more interesting but this one is much more drinkable. I could easily drink more of this, maybe too much too easily. This is by far the easiest drinking tripel I have had. The flavor is great but not overly complex. I would like this in a 750 ml because it just opened up as I finished it."

"Overall - Awesome beer from Belgium; very full-bodied and yet quite refreshing. I want another growler."
"This tripel is one of the best. It is outstanding in every way and it is everything you expect in the style. Chalky yeast and and a deep but light fruit character. Delicate toasted malt and a little pin prick of hop bitter. It's whimsical and yet tall and upright. You can almost imagine that the jolly looking monk on the bottle is the real genius behind this beer. It's as if he is saying ""our backs are straight but we do know how to have a little fun when no one is looking."" Indulgent and very very good."

"Overall: a pretty impressive but ultimately far too expensive Belgian Tripel. I do prefer the Tripels from The Little Brewing Co (Mad Abbot) or St Feuillien, both of which come in at a minimum of $20 cheaper than the case price of over AU$125 (2013)."

"O: As expected this is a great triple. Super complex profile while being well balanced as well."

"Overall Impression: A delicious and easy drinking Tripel, much easier to drink than Westmalle Tripel, and exhibits the spicey hops and yeast desired with strong malt background."
"O: Not as great as I remember but having bought this bottle in Korea I imagine its three months on a container ship might have taken its toll."

"This beer is one of the most complex beers I have ever tried. There is nothing brazen within each taste, just a rich myriad of complex flavors that attach to your palette and then to your mind. This beer goes great with aged cured dried meats with red grapes, fig jam, and aged Brie"

"O - Sweet, fruity and very candy-like. So easy to drink."
""
"To be sure, this was a strong beer and it as light as the mouthfeel was, the alcohol was easily detected from start to finish. Combined with the candy sugar, it made this just a bit stronger and more intense than I would have liked, but this was still a sold beer that had a lot going for it. Not the best example of a Tripel but not to be missed either if the time allots for the booze to settle in, since the lightness and flavors more than make up for the intensity."

"A full 3 fingered, white head with large bubbles. Looks like cloudy apple cider or mango. Smell: Fresh cut apples and grape juice. Generally fruity flavor but apples is most prevalent, slightly bitter and a little dry, Has the feel of a sparkling wine, moderate to high carbonation. Overall: Excellent balance and blend, a great Tripel."

"I'me very glad I found this to try!"
"O: Elegant and very well-produced, but also somewhat anonymous in that no flavors or aromas truly emerge as dominant. For some, that's going to be why this is the best tripel out there. I like mine more aggressive, so Westmalle is my Trappist triple of choice."

"This beer is just so easy to drink. smooth, hardly a hint of alchohol. Hint of flowers, citrus. Medium mouth. Superb, easy drinker that stands up to just about anything in this style. It may not be quite as great as the Quad, but it's still a beer I could happily drink if I could only have one choice for the rest of my life. Love it."

"Poured from the bottle into my St. B chalice. Noticed sediment at end of pour, and left dregs in the bottle. Brilliant gold colored body with a cloud-like pillow for a head. Bottle was aged for a year, and there was still plenty of carbonation. Smell was yeasty and musty, but in a good way. Taste was crisp for the style, and not as sweet as other tripels I have tried. Mouthfeel goes along with this; very crisp and dry. The abv was well hidden. A classic example of the style."

"O-There are better tripels and there are worse tripels, but if I had to describe all of the characteristics that make a tripel a tripel, this would be a good brew to use. There is a nice balance between sweet, sugary yeast flavors and more herbal grassy flavors that keep this beer drinkable. Feel, as usual for a true Belgian, is great."

"This is another great example from St. Bernardus, and beers like this will leave me ordering a triel the next time we go out. (Speaking of that, I had a dry hopped tripel last night. It was from New Belgium and was served on cask. It was at Flanny's, a bar that I hate. Last night we had an equally horrible experience as we did the first time we went. Good thing the beer was delicious! I also had a smoked IPA on cask. Yummy!)"
"Pretty good tripel, and it would be a great tripel if it wasn't for that strange moldy flavor I was getting at first. Good think it eventually recessed and went away. The second half was wonderful - if only the entire timeline went that way. Overall, still very good."

"Excellent tripel. Rich pale malts with a tasty yeast strain. Stone fruit with some spice on the back end. Very drinkable I found myself drinking this faster than most tripels."

"St. Berny makes a quality tripel. No suprise there. Makes me want to go back and get the Watou Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I tend to file Tripels under my list of least favorite styles. That does not, however, stop me from being able to enjoy true brewing prowess when I encounter it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Belgian Ales as they don't know what they're missing. Would I drink it again? Yes, as an aperitif."

"Overall 7.45"

"Beer pours a hazy yellow-gold with a medium white head. Compared to the Westmalle, the smell is much more yeast and banana-forward and a bit sweeter, where the Westmalle has a little more going on. Flavor is typical tripel flavors, but is a much easier drink than the Westmalle, it's not nearly as earthy, bitter or boozy and stays nice, light and fruity. Mouthfeel is interestingly creamy and really nice. Overall, this is a great, perfectly-balanced, refreshing tripel. There isn't as much depth in flavor as the Westmalle, but I find it to be a more enjoyable drinking experience."

" The taste is dry with some mild yeast accompaniment and both spice and light fruit essence are noticeable in the taste with a mild creaminess from the malt and semi-high carbonation leaves a mild mineral taste w/ mild herbal hops which are experienced as the ale finishes with dryness on the palate and low alcohol impact on the taste in general. Overall I was very pleased with this as it develops increasing in temperature the spice character and hops seem to emerge with a a very flavorful quality and well rounded taste in general with strength matching the feel. This is what I consider a total package beer-wonderful and a high value as well, highly recommended"

"I'm not sure why it took me so long to try this beer. I love tripels and this is a classic for the style. Very enjoyable."

"There's a good bit of alcohol here, but that seems almost part of what makes this style and without it, I'd be disappointed. Easily the best Triple that doesn't change the traditional formula I've had."
""
"taste... i cant taste it yet. i continue to admire the beauty in the Duvel tulip glass (yeah, i know...). it doesnt even lace as i tilt the glass. it bounds fluidly side to side.... that is nice.... i can never express my tastes in the types of malts used etc but i know what i like. and this is sweet. and it is sweet, too! but it's got a nice full, rounded taste. not too heavy. not too fruity (as belgiums can sometimes go), and the head continues, still, on top. i must say, with this experience right now, this has to be my current all time favorite brew. this is exciting. i've heard this is comparable (and supposedly earlier brewed by the same) to the westvleteren which i balked at and missed out on. well, at least the 8. the brick had the 11%, right? i had considered the chimay blue one of my favorites, and for commercial-ity duvel is a stand out; but although i've had this before, my taste buds are literally screaming right now! glad i got the big bottle! i understand 5's should be rare, but today, right now, this is a straight across the board 5. something the hobbits would brew..."

"O: strong brew, very fruity and on the sweet side, complex rich palate and nose, i loved it."
"It might be a bit dry and choppy for my taste, but if I was in' the mood for a triple I would definitely consider picking this up again."
""
""
"O: This is an incredible example of a triple, the champagne style scent, flavour and mouthfeel is outstanding. Easy to drink and never reveals the 8% ABV. The mouthfeel is light, but manages to hold nicely on the palette leaving a clean crisp tartness with a hint of yeastiness. Terrific drink."
"-Overall 4.0: This was a very intriguing triple. I enjoyed this beer at approximately 50 degrees fahrenheit which brought out many, many flavors that I was not expecting. Actually, as the beer warmed up, tastes that I initially perceived as adjuncts (particularly in the finish) changed and became more obviously simply a lighter malt sweetness. You may want to try this if you have the chance to taste this very good triple."
"O: a decent beer, the grainy character if this brew reminds me of a wheat beer, with some bready and floral yeast and some light hints if citrus and apples"
"Overall – A rather delicious triple. It had a little more boozy flavors then would have been expected for its 8% abv. strength, and its nose was a little weak, but overall it had great flavors, a nice look and a wonderful feel."
"O. Very refreshing and complex. It has a nice burnt wheat character that I fully enjoy."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate to lighter level of carbonation. Overall not bad, but not a tripel I would drop my pants and run to have again. Worth a try if you never had it before, but this one was a little underwelming for me. While it offered some nice complexity, it just was ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, it reminded me of a more alcoholic La Fin Du Monde. Probably the only beer I've have from these guys that wasn't a disappointment."
"Pours hazy pale orange with a thick white long-retaining head that leaves lace. Aroma is classic spicy Belgian yeast, with clove, banana, and some orange standing out. It’s not quite as aromatic as some other examples, however. Taste is sweet and meaty with no bitterness. A grainy flavor makes itself apparent after it warms a bit. Body is full, mouthfeel creamy. A really nice tripel."

"I must come clean up front, I love St Bernardus beers, and shockingly this beer out of the bottle is darn near as good as draft in Bruge. I purchased a 4 pack at Total Wine (glad to see they are beginning to carry good variety of bottled 4 packs of Belgians) and this Tripel is excellent. The pour is delightful, not overly carbonated, really an almost perfect head. The golden haze is classic for a really good tripel. The initial taste is neither sweet nor too dry, just right, without the lemony aftertaste of most Belgian blondes which have their own category. The smell is as good as it gets for tripels, great balance, hint of banana/caramel, but really a clean and fine flavorful beer and the moderate alcohol makes this Tripel worth a try. I plan to enjoy this particular brew many times in the future, especially now that I don't have to buy the 22 oz expensive model every time. I am occasionally torn about the overall price of Belgian beer and I will be glad when our stateside brewers catch up, which they will. Unfortunately we are a bit short on monks supplying out of the back monastery entrance, but our micros more than hold their own. The St Bernardus range of beers is wonderfully thought out and each has a reason, taste and character for it's existence. So I am happy to include this with their Abt 12/8/6 and Wit."
""
""
""
"Very nice Belgian triple. I got this bottle at Bevmo in Ventura, California. It comes in 330ml bottle. The foam was creamy and reach but lasted not so long. This beer has most of attributes of Belgian triples but it is not one of my favorite Belgium triples."

"Bottle. Dark gold with a very slight haze. Aroma has notes of malt, wheat, yeast and dried fruits. Very smooth, creamy and somewhat foamy palate. Flavor has soapy citrus, peppery spices, some orange peel, coriander and floral notes. . Soft body. The alcohol makes a statement early, but the brew turns sweet, almost cloying, before spice and peachy fruit finish"
"Very nice, but not quite at the level of some of my other favorite Tripels. I definitely appreciate how perfectly balanced and well crafted this is, though, for sure. A very, very nice beer."
""
""

"Overall. Admittedly, this isn't one of the best styles for me, but a very well made beer. I drank the whole thing, which is saying a lot for this guy."

"Pours hazy golden with monster creamy white head. Smells of belgian spices, some light fruits, and a bit of dry yeast. Taste is light fruits like pears and apples, along with some spiciness and funky dry yeast. Good beer. Enjoyed this more than the Watou version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruits, honey, and yeast. Taste is much the same with some slight spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not exciting me that much. The bitterness seems a little out of balance and detracts for me."
""
""
""
"O: World class. The appearance and taste of this tripel are phenomenal."
""
"Light and refreshing, all the flavors shine without stepping on each other's toes. The spice of the yeast is showcased especially well, reminding me of what most Wits should scale back to. I'm especially impressed with how they've handled the Belgian malt, as it's a delicate animal that tends to leave a bad taste in my mouth of not used properly. This is definitely one of the best Tripels out there."
"RJT"
""
"O: a good tripel - I wasn't blown away by it the way I was by their Abt 12 - but there is no doubt that these guys know what they're doing when they're brewing"
""
"Overall this is a very good tripel from one of the staple Belgian brewers in the world. Not my favorite style but pretty much what I would want from a Tripel if I was ever in the mood to drink one. Not to the quality of Westmalle but close. Recommended for fans of the style, good place to start your craft beer exploration if it is just beginning."

"overall: I just love this beer. It's somehow hard to really pinpoint the flavors. There is so much going on, and yet it's a very easy to drink beer. It's a mystery to me. Making this beer very interesting when focused on it, and very, very drinkable when just relaxing and having a beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy gold with dark amber accents and a two finger bright white pillowy head. Abundant lacing as the head recedes. Incredible head retention. An amazing aroma of spices, Belgian yeast, and ripe fruit on the nose. Opens with herbs and flora with just a touch of spice, juicy fruit in the middle and finishes dry with some sweetness, extremely mild herbal bitterness and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is mind-blowing. Slightly heavy bodied, however slick with abundant velvet-like creaminess. A very uniquely amazing tripel and a brew everyone should seek out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Coats the mouth a little without being sticky. Slightly bitter near the end, it finishes dry. Makes you want another sip."
""
"Recently bought a four pack of 11.5 ounce bottles. Poured into a trumpet glass. Very generous head with lacing and an abundant aroma. The mouthfeel is wonderfully fresh carbonation and a sweet aftertaste. I find this a great example of a tripel. I would recommend this to anyone with the desire to experience a great example of a tripel."

"Price Point - $10.99/750ML bottle"

"Overall: Great beer. On par with the trappist tripels I have had."

"D - A complex and enjoyable brew for sure. The focus is really on the finish, with lots of spices, hops, and earthy notes lingering nicely. A little less yeasty and bready than other representations of the style. An all around classic brew from a great brewery."

""
"O - I really like this aged! I wish I had a fresher one to compare, but being in Newfoundland, you can't find this within 2000km. Would gladly have again. and then again."
"I can see why its rated so highly on the list."

"OVERALL- One of the more complex tripels I've had and by far the best St. Bernanrdus beer I've had. Very dangerous in its drinkability."
""
"Overall very well-balanced -- outstanding tripel."
""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet. Pours a cloudy orange amber; thick white head and lots of lacing. Mild aroma of yeast, faint citrus, a bit sour. Light fruit, sweet malt, slight citrus and spicing. No sign of the sourness in the aroma. Finish is very nice light fruit and sweet malt. This is the best tripel I've ever had. This is the beer that got me interested in tripels. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
"Bright cloudy golden pour, huge bright white head great lacing, creamy head. Superfine bubbles on head - almost like whip cream, never seen a beer like this before. Smell of apricot and sourdough most prominent. My first Trappist beer. Fantastic thick mouthfeel, balanced sweet fruit and fig, with a bit of vanilla and molasses, and almond. Hard to find, though would absolutely drink again."
"Drinkability – This one goes down as easy as any tripel I’ve ever had. Amazing."
"Poured into a chalice. Pours cloudy dull golden with a large white head that dissipates moderately slowly. Some bubbles can be seen streaming from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of apples, banana, and citrus. The alcohol is hidden in the aroma. The aroma is mostly sweet and I do detect bready malt. The flavors are very well balanced. The taste follows the nose, with bready malt, banana, apples, and citrus. The beer is sweet, but not too sweet. There's a mild spiciness in the background. The alcohol isn't detectable at all in the taste. The mouthfeel is medium with plentiful carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent, well-balanced tripel."
""
"overall - I'm usually not a big fan of tripels, but this is hands down the best that I've had."
""
""
"D/O: An enjoyable beer, particularly in the warmth of a summer evening. Would have again."
"This manages to be a Belgian Tripel without going overboard on the yeast. It is fruity and sweet, but without being a burden to drink. More of this style should be like this."
"Overall: Good flavor, aggressive yeast. It becomes too much. Despite that, it's a solid take on the style."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best tripels I have had. As I grow more of a taste for Belgians, I begin to realize that the Tripel is one of my favorite styles. I'll definitely come back to this beer sooner rather than later."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good representation of the style. It doesn't quite take the place of Chimay in my heart, but it is still a fine ale."
"Taste shows plenty of Belgian yeast character with a soft, grainy malt. Maybe a touch overcarbonated, but that is a mild complaint. Nice alcohol bite and more than enough hop bitterness...a surprising amount actually. I cant believe it took this long for me to buy this one!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious Tripel, perfect example of the style and pretty easy to come buy."
"330ml bottle. Oversized glass. Reenjoyed on jun´12 –sometimes I like to come to my early stage beers- Gold color, slightly foggy appearance. Thick, firm, lasting, small bubbled crown. Creamy texture. Yeasty, caramel malt, sugar & candy aromas, hints of ripe orange & apricot , spiced hues too. Gentle no cloying sweet-bitter upfront. Smooth creamy, fruity mouthfeel. Toffee notes. Spicy & kind warming feeling in the middle. Medium & flavorful body, moderate carbonation. Smooth spiced finish. Sweet ripe fruit & sweet malty character are shown on the aftertaste. Very well balanced beer. Very pleasant drinkability even in a hot day. Wow!!!"

"A good solid triple, very well suited with hard cheese."
""
""
""
"overall this is exactly like a belgium trippel should taste and smell"
""
"Not what you expect and then some, if that makes sense."
"I like this beer a lot. Complex, delicious and true to the style."
""
"mouthfeel is sublime. The carbonation folds out beautifully, and leaves a nice tingle on the tongue and a dryness, despite the creamy feel of the initial sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"My first Tripel was Tripel Karmeliet and that kind of turned me off to the style as I wasn't a fan of the phenolic spicy qualities. I've since tried a few other examples and St. Bernardus has been the mildest in terms of these notes which I appreciate."
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. One of the best versions of a tripel I believe I've tasted, and this brewery consistently brings it. Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow gold color with a two finger head which recedes to skim. There is visible floatees in the beer and the beer leaves sticky fingers of lace. The aroma is of banana's, lemon grass, candied yeast and pears. The taste follows suit with the citrus notes up front before a candied yeast flavor takes over. The beer finishes with a lemongrass, pear, and banana flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall a very solid beer, a nice aroma and look to pull you in, and a great taste to keep you wanting more."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is enjoyable but you can definitely detect the presence of the alcohol. I like the light fruit sweetness combined with the banana. Definitely more of a sipping beer than a session beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A fantastic Tripel. More on the sweet side compared to giants like Westmalle, Koningshoeven (although Koningshoeven is quite similar in sweetness) or Chimay, but nonetheless, incredibly complex and precise. Dry, sweet and fruity, yet elements of sourness make this beer very enjoyable. There is an amazing breadth to this beer. Clearly, a carefully crafted Tripel!"
"O: Excellent Tripel. Well rounded and tasty."
""
""
""
"O: I got more enjoyment out of the incredible aroma than I did out of the flavor, but it’s complexity makes it easy to see why this is such a well regarded beer."
"Overall I guess I expected more from this beer. It's good, but I prefer La Fin Du Monde and Delirium Tremens."
""
"D - Defiantly deserves its lofty place in the pecking order of world class Tripels... A must try for any self respecting BA... Something that I will gladly drink with regularity..."
"Overall: Found it enjoyable and complex enough with a distinct personality. Made for an enjoyable drinking experience."
""
""
""
"A good beer and worth more visits if a Belgian-styled brew is what you're looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good tripel, overall, though I wish the yeast weren't quite so dominant. Still, it's tasty and very drinkable."
"Really nice tripel here. It is dry yet sweet in taste, bitter, floral, slightly bready from the yeast and just really drinkable."
"O: Fairly drinkable and tasty beer."
""
""
"O: A mild Belgian for this style, but still excellent. Drink up, guys; this one rocks."
""
"I need more than the 1 bottle I recieved in the St.Bernardus 4-pack with the free snifter, to evalute this better,but i am certainly willing to do more research!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A nice tripel, but on the heavy side."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into my favorite Orval glass. 1 and half finger head with good retention which left behind fluffy cloud like head lingering on top for the whole session. Yeast filled body with a orange like appearance.Smell was of orange peel,strong spices, fresh honey and green grapes. The taste is a bit complex with this beer starting out sour but soon a sweet finish takes over. The honey and spices add the right balance to the sourness of the dried grapes. A very drinkable Tripel. Medium bodied and nice carbonation. I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a serious Tripel, it's dangerously smooth and I could see myself drinking several before feeling the pain"
"Tons of carbonation and a medium body. It goes down so easy."
""
"O: Not as impressed by this as I thought I'd be, but its still a good beer, just not great."
""
""
""
"O- Like all other St. Bernardus brews it's simple, yet elegantly refined."
"O: A very nice Tripel, well balanced and smooth."
""
"Overall: A-. Solid Belgian all-around."
"Maybe I was expecting too much for such a renowned brewery and one of the holy trinity of tripels (Westmalle, Karmeliet, & St. Bernardus) but the butter and the spice didn't mesh for me and I didn't pick up on any of the sweet orchard fruits that others have mentioned. Still I'd put more than a few (but not many!) tripels above this one."
""
""
"Served in a branded goblet, poured an orangey-yellow colour with a pure white head a full finger tall. A spicey nose that describes the flavour perfectly. Tasted like beer with hints of cardamom and a little cinnamon. Not as sweet and rich as I expected a Belgian Tripel to be."
""
""
""
""
"I'd pair this with an earthfired pita and fresh garlic hummus."
"Serving Temp = 51F."
""
"O: Another great beer from Brouwerij St. Bernardus! There is so much flavor and it's just far superior than almost any other Tripel I have ever had."
""
"O - A great beer, I love tripels and this is a good one, however it just falls short of Westmalle and Karmeliet in my view due to not having the same level of intensity in flavour."
"St. Bernardus Triple, 25oz bomber: I love Belgian style beers, and was very excited to try this highly rated Triple. Pouring this beer into a glass creates a huge head, if you are not careful the head will fill the glass in an instant and it will not settle for a long while. The head really is the outstanding feature of this Triple. The body has a peachy color to it, and is translucent with visible sediment floating about. The aroma is there, with hints of champagne and apricots. I was hoping for more of the Belgian yeast and bready aromas to come through, but they were not to be had. OK, on to the flavors. The St. Bernardus Triple stays light on the tongue, with subtle fruit flavors and an undercurrent of, well, beer taste. Hmmm. I guess that is good that a beer tastes like beer, but the fun of Belgian style ales is that they are distinctively so unlike “beer”. Do not get me wrong, this was a wonderful Triple, but I was hoping for a religious experience, and it did not materialize."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium yellow straw color with a nice firm white head with a bit of cloudiness. The scent is green apple speice and a touch of banana. The taste follows the nose quite closely but again is more intense than I expected from this beer. Seems to be a characteristic of St. Bernardus. Great carbonation and very cleansing. Excellent tripel."
"A fairly typical and well done example of what I would expect in a tripel."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite a good Tripel. It's a classic for obvious reasons. I'm not as impressed with it as I wanted to be, but it's still plenty impressive."
""
""
""
"Complex, well balanced, fabulous. Coriander really comes through. Citrus and yeast blended to perfection. One of the best tripels I have ever had."
""
""

"Extrordinarily easy drinking but certainly no lack of complexity. I could almost knock back a few of these on a hot day if not for the high price and alcohol. A really fantastic brew."
"Not even going to fully review this beer. It was such a huge disappointment. From a reputable dealer so I know nothing was wrong with it either. It is way too carbonated and fizzy, so plain tasting, and I dare say it tasted like a slightly better Budweiser. Nothing about this beer tasted good or of anything interesting. Now, it's not disgusting or horrible, but it was borderline bad. I'm giving it a 3 because I don't want to rip such an apparent ""legend"" but it was worse than that. Super disappointed :("
"O- Top notch Tripel! Everything you'd expect from St. Bernardus. Not my favorite style, but this pretty much defines it! I wanna grab some of this and see what it becomes in 5 or so years."

"O: 4.5"

"Overall, it is a good Belgian, and a unique Trippel."
"This is world-class.. it has just about everything I look for in a tripel.. bravo."

""
""
"O- It's a good tripel. I know it's known as one of the paragons of the style, but it's not my favorite. Even so, everyone should try this at least once."
"Overall - I like this beer and recommend it to anyone but I was really expecting something more complex and didn't quite have the ""wow"" factor."

"Notes: My first St. Bernardus, coming from a gift pack. Heretofore I have not really enjoyed any of the pale Belgian Ales, whether they be BPAs, Saisons, etc. This one actually is pretty good. The flavors are well harmonized and the 'Band Aid' flavor does not overwhelm. Time will tell if I go back to this one."

"Poured this Tripel from a bottle into a goblet. Pours a cloudy orangish color, produces a white creamy head and has some of the thickest lacing I have ever seen. The aroma smelled of orange and apricots. Very nice. Medium in body, this Tripel was very smooth, highest marks for mouthfeel. A base of toasted malt, strong citrus flavor...lemon and orange, hints of ripe apricots and then moves to a sweet caramel almost candy sugar flavor. This Tripel is amazing...best I have ever had, so many flavors shine through...it was fun to analyze. Semi dry finish.. Can't wait to try again."

"A nice enough tripel but not quite what I was hoping for. I think the Westmalle/Karmeliet/La Fin du Monde set will still be my preferred purchases."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color with a very thick off-white head that lingered for awhile. This beer had a very sweet aroma. Sweeter then the other St. Bernardus beers that came in the 4 beer and glass gift-set I bought. It tasted very yeasty and lemony. It was delicious though. Good amount of carbonation. It was an overall delicious beer and would definitely recommend it."
"Overall-Definitely a heavier tripple than what ive had before. Good solid tripple. One of the better ones. Affligem still holds my heart on triples. Spices and orange are a good mix."
"Poured from a 750 into a Chimay chalice. Cloudy dark yellow with a lose foam. About a half inch. Dissipates quick to a film. The first smell is heavy apple cider after a little warming it reminds me of canned fruit cocktail. Taste is very fruity. Pineapple, citrus, apple and a few others I can't define. Slight alcohol finish. Lots of carbonation with a lighter mouthfeel. Good Tripel but not one of my favorites."
"This isn't bad. It's well balanced, the Belgian yeast definitely does it's thing here, and the alcohol level is well masked. This is an easy drinking tripel."
"Pours a hazed golden orange color with huge plume of white froth, decent retention and lacing. Scent leads with a lightly sweet blend of watery, fleshy fruit (pear and apple) accented with citrus rind, Belgian yeasts bring light breadlines along with hints of banana, moderate spicing, grainy sweet malt profile. Taste is fruit forward before the spice, yeast and malt blend perfectly as the beer finishes. Medium bodied, bubbly. A fantastic fruity triple where the yeasts and spices don't overpower."
"I was going to give this a 4.5 overall, but I never got used to that minty feeling. Still, a world class beer."
"O: This beer was good but borderline cloying. Would definitely drink again."
"Overall: I guess my pallet is changing or I've just had too really good Tripels. I don't normally like them but the last two (including this one) I have very much enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel: Was ideal. I enjoyed every sip in my mouth."
"D - Delicious tripel! I'm really glad I tried this, everything is great in this brew. It has good drinkability and the high ABV is masked well."
"O- I enjoyed it, but I prefer the Abt. 12 or Witbier over the Triple. It's sweet, smooth, and simple, but very carbonated."
"I'm glad I finally had this beer after being a BA for so long. Well overdue in my opinion"
"Crisp, simple and satisfying. I love it to death."
"Its an amazing beer, we all know this, so I dont have to tell you if you have not tried it. Just buy it, take a drink and understand."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer is all about the smoothness of the mouthfeel, and inoffensive characters. The first sip is really complex, but after that it levels off and becomes less so."
"This poured out as a really nice golden yellow color with a fluffy white colored head on top. The smell of some spice, yeast, and banana were on the nose in this brew. The taste of the beer was nice lightly spiced with a soft sweetness in there as well. The mouthfeel of this brew was soft, medium bodied and quite enjoyable. Overall I found this to be one of the better Tripels I've had."
"Overall: An interesting take on the tripel syle and typically great beer from St. Bernardus. It's not quite my favorite selection of this style, but displays itself as a well balanced, flavorful, and ultimately refreshing beer. Due to it's excessive sweetness, it's not something I'd buy that often. Still, for the low price of 2 euros here in France, it's definitely a bargain unlike anything else. Recommended a try for sure."
"Medium bodied with excessive carbonation, this beer is a little too drinkable considering its 8% ABV. The body is just right to allow the flavors to operate at full capacity while not being too thick. The carbonation is extremely fizzy at first but does not seem to imprede on the flavors. Refreshing and thirst-quenching, this beer begs to be gulped, not sipped."
"Now I know better. This Triple is just a very soft one, like Tripel Karmeliet and Corsendonk. Nice!"
"D: dangerously drinkable. Cold or a little warmed up."
"St. Bernardus Tripel is not as spiced as some triples – La Fin Du Monde comes to mind. A truly exceptional triple from a world class brewer!"
"Overall - very tasty brew. It makes me nostalgic about being in Bavaria."
"D: very gentle complexity. a very easy drinking, tasty tripel."
"This beer is golden colored with a huge white head. The smell is Belgian yeasty spiceyness as well as a bread aroma. The flavor follows suit with the belgiany flavors coming through but they are not as robust as they are I. Other triPels I have had. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a lot of carbonation. The beer is very good but not my favorite tripel."
"O - St. Bernardus satiates yet again! Aside from this Tripel, I've also had their Quad (Abt. 12), which is my favorite beer of all time. This beer comes close and is a perfect Tripel, in my opinion, followed by Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde. Highly recommended for those that appreciate sweeter dessert-style beers."
"O: A solid tripel, deserving of its status as one of the ""classics"" in the style. Been on a tripel kick in the last few months it seems and this one is up there, but not at the top."
"Overall Impression- While picking up this caramel flavor, I am not sure what to think of this Tripel! Not as strong and full bodied as I would like it is too sweet... Wishing there was more spice and body in this brew. Will be looking for again to compare notes but not like the other St. Bernardus beers I've had in their ranks!"
"Though the St. Bernardus is a touch too sweet for me as far as Triples go, it's still a very good brew and nothing to turn my nose up at."
"A lovely offering from St. Bernardus, and everything one could really hope for in a Tripel. Nicely balanced, well constructed. Bravo."
"Good carbonation - zesty yet smooth. A good sipping beer -the high ABV makes this a nice beer to end the evening with,"
"O-A carefully constructed tripel. Very sophisticated and nuanced. A classic example of the style."
"This is a very classic approach to the Belgian Tripel and is a very good, solid demonstration of it. For me, the high amounts of carbonation were a bit of a distraction but the flavor profile stood on it's own. Overall, one of the better Tripels I've had but not the best."
"Overall another excellent tripel, perfect summer drinking."
"Pours a bubbly, sunny golden color under a billowing, thick mass of white foam that very slowly, but never completely, dissolves. Aromas of pale fruity esters (pear, apricot, cherry, banana), yeast, soft flowers, lemon sweetness, and spicy orange rind. The flavor is packed full of spiced fruity esters blanketing a mellow pale maltiness and peppery phenols. Soft, yet full-flavored and very well rounded. Somewhat doughy yeast, citrus rind dryness, apple, and honey. Smooth and creamy...well-carbonated with the slightest burn in the back of the throat. Excellent tripel, as one would expect..."
"O: Tripel, strong pale ales are becoming one of my favorite styles, and this is no exception. Highly recommended."
"Overall a good beer, however, not my favorite from my favorite breweries!!!"
"Excellent as always."
"This beer was quite excellent, and I must admit that I'm not someone who particularly enjoys tripels. I will happily add a new tripel to the others that I enjoy (La Fin du Monde and Karmeliet)."
"O-pretty average for a tripel. overall not as harsh as some tend to get. easy drinking and fairly boring, no something i need to get again."
"O: awesome triple but the only time I've ever seen it was part of the sampler/ gift glass pack so I'm sure its kinda hard to find. But still a great beer."
"Regardless of nose, it's still a fantastic brew. Wonderful tasting very unique and crushing feel beer. Delicious."
"The taste up front is certainly citrus , peach, some banana with spice. In the middle the selection of flowery hops balances the fruity beginning. At the end we enjoy Belgian yeast and a delicate grainy aftertaste. Very well composed and extremely drinkable. The alcohol is very well hidden. I would drink this beer at any time. Great job!"
"The beer pours a cloudy dark yellow color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the oranges and lemons with some Belgian yeast notes. I also get a little bit of bready malt. The flavor is a mix of Belgian candy sugar with some orange and bready malt notes. There is also a little bit of alcohol present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - A decent beer, something to definitely consider if you enjoy tripels."
"Dr: Nothing special, but fairly priced if you're in Belgium. Give it a go, but don't expect a great abbey beer."
"O--This is a quality brew. Very Comforting and refreshing."
"Pours and deep and dark golden yellow with some haze and three fingers of a frothy white head that sticks around and leaves some thick lacing. Smells beautiful with a heavy dose of Belgian yeast, citrus, apple and spice. Some banana is in there too. Taste is equally as complex with some nice sweetness and Belgian spice blend perfectly with the yeast and the citrus. Fuller-bodied for the style with vibrant carbonation. Perhaps my favorite Tripel."
"o-Probably one of my favorite beers. I have had several other tripels including La Fin Du Monde and i still prefer this one. Great beer and i will enjoy it for many years to come"
"Medium body with lighter than expected carbonation. I wish I could rate this as well as everyone else. I love theor other brews a lot but this one just came up short to me. I'm hoping this one is bad honestly."
"Over all this was a great trippel. Very complex, it took a long time to decipher all the flavors present. I would have to say this is one of the best trippels I have ever had. Highly recommend."
"O - Tasty tripel and surprisingly hoppy on the finish. A treat indeed and a quality example of the style. High ABV is incredibly well hidden, making it dangerously drinkable. I have yet to be disappointed by anything St. Bernardus produces."
"D - Great Tripel; great blend of ingredients to create a unique Tripel brew; love St. Bernardus beers; highly recommended"
"O- this is one of my new favorite triples. A bit more drinkable than westamalle's, but equally delicious."
"Note this was from the 750ml bottle, have not tried the 11.2 oz."
"Overall, a solid beer, but nothing special."
"Wow, I've never really been a fan of Belgian beers, but this is one amazing beer. I will be very sure to pick up other offerings by this brewer, and will look to have this one again as well."
"O: I really noticed how much more refined this beer was once it warmed up -- let it sit for ~10 min after pulling from the fridge to work up its self esteem. Delicious; second fiddle only to Tripel Karmeliet."
"Just about perfect. There isn't a lot more to be said about this beer that hasn't already been said, but in my mind, this is just about the pinnacle of a tripel."
"Light bodied, above average carbonation, with a sweet aftertaste. I know Tripels tend to be sweet, and I really like sweet beers, but the sweetness of this beer went overboard for me."
"Overall, this is a serious Tripel, I am enjoying it greatly. This is an amazing and powerful beer, not for chugging due to its intense floral characteristics. A real sipper, even at 8 %."
"D/O: Nice mouthfeel and smooth; a very drinkable tripel... not as sweet / tart as some others."
"O: Sweeter and less boozy than an average triple, but not overly so. The flavors strike a fantastic balance of fruit, spice, malt, and booze."
"O- This is a World Class beer, and one of the best tripels on the planet. You owe it to yourself to buy this beer whenever you see it. I'd love to have this on draft someday, but it's near perfect the way it is. Cheers."
"O - A complex and delicious tripel, dangerously drinkable; certainly one worthy of having again. Probably one of the better ones I've had with tons of fruity flavors meshing together."
"Really balanced, fine drinker. Pear and apples, light banana and tropical fruits, light grains and ethanol, spiciness (cloves), light sweetness with a pleasant dry finish, just a touch of alcohol but hides it well. One of the smoothest, balanced, easy drinking tripels I've had to date. Recommended."
"d- very drinkable i enjoyed very much."
"D: Excellent drinkability! Another easy drinking Trappiste ale...big surprise! Balanced, crisp and delicious."
"O- This bottle is nearly 3 years old and would of held on a lot longer I think. This brewery kicks the hell out of a lot of the trappist brews IMO, and this beer is at the top of the list. I need to grab some more of this stuff, just a solid all-around brew."
"served in a maredsous goblet, not too cold. has a lovely apricot color, and is opaque. nice white collar that fades quick but stubbornly retains the whole way down. minimal lacing. nose is sweet and very fruity. little alcohol and mild clove notes. first taste is a little tart up front with some biting alcohol, but nothing extreme. mellows out nicely, pears are prevalent as are apples. sweet. got some coriander in there. finishes fairly clean with a lingering alcohol ""mintyness"". not overly complex, actually pretty straight forward for a tripel. mouthfeel is exceptional. very smooth, great carbonation, but not enough to distract from the flavors going on. an easy drinking trip for sure."
"O: This didn't blow me away, but it's a really solid beer, a little hard to grade. I'd like to give it a 4.25 on taste/overall, so I had to settle for 4 and 4.5 The one complaint is that the nice floral and fruit flavors fade very quickly on the palate and leave a rather and somewhat bland finish."
"Buy or just die.﻿"
"Ok, so I expected a little more, but I'll leave this one being satisfied."
"This beer poured a cloudy, murky dark orange in color with a two finger almost pure white foamy head. The aromas consist of bready pale malts, a boatload of yeast, citrus, bananas, and cloves. This has a nice spice to it. The flavor is very but in a light manner. It has a lot of yeast and citrus to it and is mildly sweet. It has a lot of flavor for a tripel and the alcohol is very well hidden. This beer drinks as smooth as any tripel that isn't La Fin du Monde. It almost melts in your mouth. I really enjoy this beer. I'm convinced this brewery can do no wrong at this point. I'd highly recommend this one."
"This has turned out to be one of my favorite tripels out there."
"O - Simply outstanding. A great tripel, probably my favorite thusfar. Again, Wow!"
"Unfortunately not one of my favorites. You can't like'em all."
"D - High. Love that typical Tripel yeasty/fruity combo. Wacky aroma scores this lower than it should be though."
"Alcohol tingles a little in the mouth and it's certainly present in the aroma but buried 'neath the fruity yeast. Expertly woven into the beery fabric of this brew. Different from the pack. Beer you could swill a lot of if endlessly available."
"Incredibly drinkable beer- the booze is quite hidden, and the taste is wonderful. Might be my favourite tripel."
"D - The overall balance of this beer ranks it amongst the cream of Tripels. Well worth a try."
"Carbonation is so minimal that it definitely hurts the beer, but I think this is an isolated case of my faulty bottle so I really want to try another."
"Pours a cloudy golden blonde with particulate caught in a sort of static dance, permanently placed in equilibrium throughout the beer. A tall retentive head, about 1/2 the height of the liquid persists for a couple of minutes before fading. Mild aromas of clear candies, with hints of spice and perhaps some very subtle fruits come off the pour. Similar to the aroma, the taste is creamy, full of the clear candy with hints of spice and fruit--very mild throughout. Not much complexity, which is to be expected for the style; however, compared to the St. Bernardus siblings, I find myself left wanting more. Moderately full in the mouth and smooth through the swallow and finish, leaving a slightly sweet aftertaste. It remains true to the Tripel, but lacks some character, best to stick with the Abt 12 and Prior 8 IMO."
"I wonder why this is the first time I´m drinking this. It´s easy to obtain and fairly cheap )mind you that I live in Holland). Westmalle gets all the love but this one is a winner as well. Will be pciking this up more often. Recomended."
"D- this is a classic trip and one that I'd take any day. Another killer brew from one of the best."
"D - A very well crafted tripel. Balance is the key here. There is a lot going on and it all seems to blend together near flawlessly. Really like the fruity aspects of this beer, the subdued alcohol, even at 8% and the smooth body. Not sure why its taken me so long to review this one...definitely one I come back to fairly often."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very carbonated and sweet in your mouth. The mouthfeel is that of sweetened apples and grapes. This would be perfect to pair with fruit. Quite refreshing. One of the best and most unique Belgian ales I've had the pleasure of experiencing."
"Creamy mouthfeel and a high level of carbonation make this freakishly drinkable. The alcohol goes nearly unnoticed. Fantastic brew."
"Pours a nice opaque golden orange color with one finger of dense off-white head. Aroma is citrus, rose water/floral, and spice. Taste is also citrusy, sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. There is also a very mild bitterness towards the end that merges into a lightly bitter finishing. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very nice Tripel."
"330 ml bottle, BB date reads 09-25-2012, into tulip. Clear, effervescent golden body is overlain by airy white head that doesn't last and completely dissipates. I'd expect the head to be firmer and creating more lace as subsides. Aroma exhibits light, somewhat bready, toasty malt character with a nice interplay of fruity esters, phenols, sweetness and alcohol. The significant fruity esters are represented by orange, pineapple, mango and peach, followed by moderate spicy and clove-like phenols, evident candy sugar sweetness and restrained soft spicy alcohol. As far as the aroma section is considered, the balance between esters and phenols is leaned towards the former while in the flavor dept the later prevail. Soft malty body embraces dominant peppery phenols and spicy alcohol flavor, subdued citrusy esters of orange, and moderately high bitterness that seems to result especially from the yeast-derived phenols as well as from hoppy bitterness. The relatively high bitterness combines with moderate carbonation to lend a dry finish with spicy aftertaste. The body is medium-light and somewhat creamy from the slightly warming alcohol."
"Drink- Its a St. B Triple. You know its good."
"Verdict: Full of character, balanced well, enjoyable throughout, and easily quaffable, St. Bernardus' Tripel is a great little brew. It's perhaps my favorite Tripel so far, as well as a stellar introduction to the brand."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability is high. Glass was empty before I knew it."
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Excellent beer, even more flavor as it warms."
"The feel of this brew is subtle and works well with the flavors. Medium bodied with a nice fizz. This might be my favorite so far from the boys at St. Bernardus. The taste is on the money and mouthfeel and nose are right there too. Well worth checking out."
"St Bernardus ABT 12 is better, but this is one hekuva beer."
"d- this beer is pretty damn good. Overall I would really enjoy another one."
"I poured from A 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. This was a bit of a gusher, it poured a turibd gold and had a fizzy, white head. The aroma is spicy, sweet and fruity. The spiciness of this is more balanced than other triples, lots of sweet fruit, some clove, some grass. It has a drying finish. The beer is an easy drinker, medium body, high carbonation. A very enjoyable triple, may have to try a 750 of this one."
"D- Very solid beer, easy to drink and very happy to receive this gift"
"Overall I think I like the Westmalle Tripel the best but this is still a solid beer. Get one if you can."
"Drinkability - Smooth with just a little alcohol bite on the end. Over all it was very good."
"A solid tripel, i was a little tipsy when i reviewed this so the notes aren't great. But as critical as i am, it must be a good beer."
"Overall- Excellent triple, maybe my new favorite. St. Bernardus is highly respected, yet I still feel they are a bit underrated, one of the top Belgian breweries, or in the world for that matter."
"D: This is an absolute delight to this tripel fan."
"Poured hazy orange color with a huge frothy head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex citrus fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and lively carbonation. Medium fruity balanced flavor with a medium sweet & sour finish of long duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a good beer."
"D- Bitter, tart and overcarbonated. Hard to swallow even for its style in my opinion. Peppery finish makes it especially harsh."
"d- good, very flavorful, prefect example of what a tripel should taste like."
"M/D: Carbonation dances on the back of the tongue and top of the palate. Thin to medium body. Beer goes down very easily."
"better then most triples i have had but still not a fan"
"d. pretty drinkable all in all, not really appealing, but it has its moments. overall its just not a complete beer to me, its lacking major flavor connections and enhancements."
"Drinkable? 10/4 good buddy."
"Average body, well hidden alcohol, malty aftertaste, then fruity."
"O- I think St. Bernardus is a class act, the king of the secular brewers that brew abbey style beers. This beer lives up to it. It is definitely one of the finest tripels out there and has a one up on La Trappe's tripel in my ranking book. This is a regular in my tripel line up and should be in yours. Not to strong, not to heavy or sweet, just good, and a nice beer to knock a few down."
"The aroma is strong in the spice and yeast department, it's strong and wafting out for feet. I cant help but give the taste a 5, there is so much juicy citrus packed into each sip, with a tangy yeast light tartness, over all the crisp fruits like pear and apple and esters. this is greatness. This is so approachable and the light dryness just begs you to to set the glass down."
"D - Wonderful drinkability. Its beers like this that make me want to be a monk and brew beer all day. Try this beer, you will not be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Not bad, I could actually drink more than one of the 11.2 oz bottles."
"The only thing slowing me down was the ABV (with an able assist from the Prior 8). 2 would be enough for me if drinking it solo."
"More hazy golden to look at than Westmalle Tripel, this beer keeps a constant thinnish head. There's a firm zesty honey quality on the nose as it begins spritzy and ends with a zing. Though solid and reliable this just doesn't fully deliver the complexity and development I would expect from a top tripel. Good but not great."
"The drinkability is quite high. The ABV is moderately high, but very well incorporated into the beer. The nose was not quite what I was expecting but as soon as I sipped it I was delighted. It's simply art in a glass. St Bernardus is quite frankly one of the best in the world."
"D - Even at this ABV, killer session. Just do it."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thin, short lasting head. Nice sweet aroma of yeast, fruit, brown sugar and spices. Mouth feel is harsh and dry. Full body. Taste is very similar to aroma: yeast, sugar and fruit (banana and apricots) with some spice notes. Long earthy finish. Very nice, complex brew, not very easy to drink though"
"(D)- An excellent triple. Everything I was expecting. Has a nice balance and smoothness. A very clean take on the style without being too earthy or funky."
"Very tasty one and plenty to love."
"Drinkabilty - If it wasnt for the alcohol % this would be higher. A fantastic triple, lots of flavor, smooth, not overly bitter. One of the best, will drink again"
"drinkability - loved every sip - its just a shame i can only find this beer sold in singles and for more then i want to spend on a regular basis"
"D- A very well done brew here. I will certainly buy this again."
"Drinkability: This is an extremely flavorful and fairly easy-drinking tripel. I feel like a fool for overlooking St. Bernardus for so long..."
"This is a super drinkable tripel that is not at all what I was expecting. Not nearly as in your face as some other examples and light on the palate. Besides some hotness in the nose, you would never guess this is an 8% ABV brew. Highly recommended."
"D - Extremely drinkable."
"d - A great tripel all around. At 8% I thought it was very easy to drink and I loved the taste and mouthfeel. Would certainly have again."
"D: A really well put together Tripel. Booze is well hidden. This is a must try Tripel!"
"Overall: If I don't find ""some strange"" in the way of tripels when I shop, this is likely the one I'll take home when the tripel mood strikes...which is frequent."
"Aroma of grapefruit hints of hops. Pours a nice amber golden haze. Very lively beer. Nice medium head. A very doughy tripel. Different from any other tripel I have had. Has notes of banana and even bubblegum, which is a first for me with beers. A creamy beer that has some bitter on the backend. A delicious brew. But not of the level of the Chimay, Chouffe, or Tripel Karmeliet."
"D - Although its as dry as cotton, its got great flavor and is quite drinkable. Definitely not a session beer, but a great one to end the night with."
"D - On the fruity, spicy side of the style but very nice."
"Not my favorite tripel, but still an enjoyable one."
"Pours a very hazy, nearly opaque golden copper color. An aggressive pour yielded two fingers of off white head that quickly faded to a few millimeters. The first thing I noticed in the smell was a sour note. There was also some orange peel, but the sour note didn't match this. Some spice and caramel sweetness as well. After further sniffing the off-putting sour faded and the caramel came on more prominently. Pretty sweet initially. Then a fruity note comes through...this part is very good. Orange stands out and banana and bubblegum are pretty faint. The carbonation is a bit biting, but it matched the taste quite nicely. It also seemed to aid in the peppery finish. Alcohol was hardly noticeable. Pretty tasty brew."
"A somewhat complicated Tripel: more hops that expected, less malt in the same vein. Overall, this lead to a very drinkable (until the well-integrated 8 points of booze kick in) big boy beer from the other brothers."
"Fairly easy to drink tripel, but the slight alcohol burn does warn you that this is a fairly hard hitting beer at 8.0% abv. A nice effort from St. Bernardus."
"This is what every Belgian Tripel should aspire to taste like. Fantastic, complex, and well balanced. Once again the monks show us how to brew a well crafted beer."
"D: At 8% ABV it is a one at a time kind of beer, but a very balanced and very drinkable Tripel. One of the better ones I've had. As always it is hard to go wrong with St. Bernardus."
"This is a very nice tripel that is very easy to drink at 8% ABV..."
"drinkability; really a tasty beer so I would want to drink more considering this factor but overall improvements could be made."
"D- I love this beer! I could drink this one every day if my cash flow allowed. Great complexities, smoooth and an alcohol content that would keep you grounded. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Balanced and a very hidden ABV. Watch out after a few of these because you won't know what hit you... I know I didn't the first time I drank it."
"Drinkability: I'm sort of glad I've only got one of these to drink. At 8 percent abv and with this kind of flavor I might end up drinking a bit too much. This is an amazing beer. It's a shame there are not more triple style beers made in the states."
"Overall another great beer by St. B. As I said earlier, this is a textbook tripel. Not real sweet, not real tart, just right. Great beer (as I expected anything less)."
"Drinkability: High quality stuff. Though not overly complex, it is loveable, very tasty, and drinkable."
"D - Very good tripel but alcohol might be evident a little bit. I highly recommend it nonetheless."
"D-A very fine beer that is quite expensive. I really like their quad, but this doesn't seem remarkable in the same way."
"O: High drinkability. Great beer. Excellent St. Bernardus specimen"
"Such a smooth and supple tripel. It's such a lightly done one, with everything so well integrated that I feel like many of the other examples just don't get it. Beautiful stuff."
"Overall, I wouldn't say it was AMAZING! But I would say that it IS a must try, especially if you like Trappist or Belgian style ales. Personally, this style is one of my favorites, and I will definitely be drinking it again."
"Hazy apricot with blonde highlights when backlit and a fluffy bone white head. Lemon peel and tropical fruity notes with a touch of alcohol and bready yeast. Light citrus fruity and banana estery flavors with a bit of coriander and mild citric hop flavor. This beer is truly perfectly bananced. Medium bodied with seltzery carbonation. St. Bernardus Tripel is a world class beer that may be taken for granted because of wide availability."
"(D) Very Drinkable and truely classic. One of my favorite but felt as if it could use a little something extra to really put it over the top."
"Drinkability: One of, if not my absolute, favorite tripels. This will frequently be found in my fridge."
"D: nice tripel but i tracked this one down and i feel it was a waste of time. and would not get again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is very high with an almost champagne like bubbly quality. Drinkability is good, it was a very flavorful and well balanced beer overall and a fantastic example of the style."
"Drinkability is amazing with this brew. The breadiness coupled with the sweet fruit flavorings and pleasantly chewy mouthfeel make this tripel incredibly easy to quaff. It tastes almost like a slightly boozier version of a hefeweizen, which is one of my all-time favorite styles of beer. St Bernardus really has a dandy of a drink in this. It has done what I thought impossible and knocked off the venerable La Fin du Monde as my favorite tripel. Cheers to those merry monks who really know how to brew!"
"For such a well-regarded beer, I must admit my expectations were a bit high and, unfortunately, not met. Poured slightly hazy amber-tinged gold, with lively sharp carbonation and a short-lived head. Bright in the mouth with prickly carbonation. Flavor profile was a bit flat and one-dimensional with apple notes. Lacking the peppery and phenolic notes I associate with the best examples of the style."
"D-this is full of flavor that is well integrated and balanced. tasty tripel that has everything you want to see. a more dry finish and stronger malt presence to balance may help, but still very solid!"
"Ample carbonation and a light, dry mouthfeel. Banana and clove up front followed sweet biscuit and a lingering pepper finish with just a hint of hop bitterness. Alcohol is well-masked and the flavors are nicely complex, but this one was just a touch on the sweet side for my palate."
"D- Could drink many of these. A superb tasting beer. St. Bernardus has been good so far, the Abt 12 is better IMO, but this is worth trying."
"The mouthfeel is of a fairly light body with good carbonation. It went down pretty easy. ABV is well hidden. I could well go for another. A solid triple."
"D - Glass went quickly, solid beer, like every other St. Bernardus brew."
"D- A pretty darn good tripel. Not the best but well deserving of its ranks in our top beers list."
"D: I see this as a brew that hides the ABV very well, nice notes and a great overall drinkability. I would consider this one of the many of the style to be represented well."
"O - Very, very nice. I've been passing on tripels for the past few months but lately have been on kind of a tripel bender (get it?) lately. This is an excellent example of the style, and makes me want to have A LOT more."
"D: I have not had this one in a few years and I was not that impressed. Much better examples of tripels out there though this is still a good beer."
"Overall a very good beer from people that have been doing this for a long time."
"11.2 oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Best before end 08 02 13 indicated on the back label. Pours a burnished, golden-orange with a creamy/frothy 2.75 inch head. Clarity is semi-hazy, with tiny bubbles effervescing in solution from the stem to cap. Head exhibits excellent retention, eventually settling into a 3/4 inch cap that is refreshed with a swirl. Delicate strands of lacing are exposed and adhere to the side of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals light citrus fruit (perhaps some apricot), cloves, a spicy/peppery quality and a suggestion of candi sugar and honey. Taste follows nose - a little grassy and the herbal quality is less spicy than suggested by the nose. There's also a slightly stale yeast flavor that comes out towards the back and somewhat quashes the sweetness that presents in the middle. Light fruit is more rounded and less citrus-centric. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a slightly scaly carbonation and a finish that falls a little short of semi-dry. A very nice and well-balanced tripel. This tends to be a hit or miss style for me, but this is definitely a hit in my opinion."
"formed 2"" of dense, creamy, slightly off-white head over the light golden-honey hued brew. Head shows great staying power, and lacing is amazingly hearty and plentiful. Aroma is a bit spicy, in that expected Belgian way, with yeasty, slightly malty undercurrents. Taste is upfront delicately fruity, following with hearty malt character, and only the slightest hint of the alcohol we know all tripels have. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both excellent."
"D - I once thought that Trappist Ales were the best beers available. As I get older the IPA's and the darker stuff has more appeal to me. Not bad, though...would drink again."
"D: Not my favorite tripel, but definitely a great beer. Delicious and fairly easy to drink."
"Once the cork was popped, there was a huge gush. I had to do a mad rush to try and save as much as possible. Once poured, it was a light cloudy orange colour with huge white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of sweet bubblegum and Belgian yeast with some spices. Flavour is much of the same, little bit of bitterness too, but quite sweet. Carbonation is a bit over-the-top, as evidenced by the gushing."
"Creamy medium bodied beer with a dry finish. The forward is mildly sweet. The midpalate is moderately sweet and estery. The yeast character is lower than you'd expect. This beer is awesome. One of the best tripels I've ever had."
"It does show a lot of tart, and almost sour aspects which will drive some people away, however if your plate is more attuned, or if you naturally enjoy this type of flavor you will absolutely adore this beer. It is a great aperitif, and would also pair well with stronger vegetables like asparagus or artichoke, and hummus or similar middle eastern spreads would also be perfect for this magnificent Abbey Tripel."
"It's good but not as drinkable as others in the style. Man I am just not a huge fan of St. Bernardus relative to the whoever has been driving their ratings way up. This tripel is good but not great."
"Finally got around to one of these. Worth the wait. Sexy looking bugger - massive, evenly spread head and very smart lacing. The tripel to end all tripels. Great nose of banana, orange rind, nutmeg and yeasty goodness. Mouthfeel is full and luscious. On the palate the phenols come out to play along with the hops. Toffee brittle comes to mind. The bitter sweet finish is simply boneriffic. Primo."
"D: The beer wasn't too difficult to drink considering its alcohol content, which is well hidden. I will definitely try this one again as it is one of the best representations of the style."
"Pours a hazy pale gold with a huge foamy white head. Very complex aroma with a warm sweet yeastiness, flowery aromatic hops, bubblegum and some slight spice. Classic Belgian yeast flavors upfront with lots of banana/bubblegum esters, a little bit of honey, fairly strong alcohol and golden raisins. Nice creamy medium body with lots of soft carbonation."
"D. This review is the first time ever trying St. B Tripel. It is definitely a well crafted beer, as I would expect nothing less. The initial opening of this beer did not go according to plan, so I will have to do a 2nd take and see how it goes."
"Pours a bit dark with the style with a billowing white head and a bit of lacing. Nice Belgian spice with some fruity aromas. Taste is similar with the addition of some clove. Medium body with good spicing. Drinkability isn't quite as good as many of the stalwarts of the style. Despite a nice taste, it doesn't leave me clamoring for more."
"D: this is extremely drinkable, the alcohol is hidden well. As this warms, more honey, lemon and subtle spices appear. I can easily finish a lot of this quickly, but that would defeat the point."
"jd"
"This isn't the best tripel I've had, but it is very good."
"Drinkability- Due to the mouthfeel, it is a very drinkable beer. It's on the lighter side, in regards to taste and feel, so I can drink many more of these. Unfortunately, it's higher in alcohol content than most beers, so drinking this for long periods of time could be ""interesting."""
" Very rich and delicious This is à good example for the Style"
"Taste has assertive carbonation yet is soft in the mouth at the same time, the banana and clove are more prominent and meld with the candied sugar nicely, the alcohol is well hidden."
"D: This beer is very drinkable, although I don't think I'd want more than a couple in a row with the alcohol content at 8%."
"A good change of pace for someone who doesn't drink Belgian ales very often."
"This suffered from being poured into a pint glass(!) Having said that, while there's a lot of sweet and spice going on here, I prefer the drier end of Tripels - this one is just too much of a meal."
"D - Very nice beer that is crisp yet fruity and very alive with the yeast profile. Great beer!"
"That monk is just so dern happy all the time! He must be enjoying nigh-constant Bernardus brews... This-a one pours a clear pale golden straw topped by nearly a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises heavy clove and pepper, banana, spicy yeast, a tiny bit o' that farmhouse stuff (hmm), and some lemon zest. basically, it smells like a tripel. The taste follows, brining those spices to the fore, backed by some nice banana and citurs blends, and finishing with a nice flourish of pepper and cardamom. The body is a fluffy medium, with a sharp carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a very nice, nearly archetypal tripel. Get some, and be as happy as the monk!"
"D: At 8%, it's not oppressive, but tasty and light. I sat on a patio in Brussels and drank the bottle dry."
"A tasty Tripel and very good. It's not my favourite but I would have it again."
"Overall this is delightful Tripel that is smooth, full of nice malt flavors and the finish reminds you of this and keeps you coming back for more."
"Can't go wrong here for a nice pale color Belgian."
"D: St. Bernardus good as always. Definitely a beer to have."
"The carbonation and crisp hoppiness make this very light and easy drinking."
"Poured a cloudy golden-orange color with tiny sediment floating around. Very carbonated with large head that slowly minimizes. Smells of alcohol and citrusy/tropical fruits. Nothing really dark or berry-like. Hints of banana. Tastes very sweet with banana and other fruity flavors. Fizzy mouthful...maybe a little too carbonated (but still VERY delicious)! Very high drinkability. Very crisp and refreshing for hot summer days."
"Had a fair amount of sediment in the bottle but smell and flavor were unaffected. Very carbonated after opening almost fizzy. You can pick up light malt in the nose and I could definitely smell the alcohol. Appearance in the glass after pour is cloudy and hay colored. Definitely a well balanced beer, light floral hoppiness contrasts well with the sweetness of the malt. Effervescence keeps the beer drinkable and saves it from being an other wise pretty heavy beer. In my opinion a damn good brew."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with one-finger white head that subsides to a minimal amount. Lacing was minimal throughout. The aroma was comprised of fruit and slight alcohol notes. The flavor was full of fruit, sweet malt, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew that felt very nice on the palate and was extremely drinkable, refreshing, and smooth. A definite must try for anyone."
"This is the second St. Bernadus beer that I've had the pleasure of drinking. First impressions on the pour - beautiful, golden color and lots of activity from the carbonation, plus a big, thick and creamy head. Based on appearance alone this brew would receive a standing ovation from me. The smell disappoints a little as it is almost completely ether with only little hidden fruit/citrus. It tastes wonderfully malty and crisp with a nice, dry finish I've come to associate with these incredible Abbey brews. Perfectly balanced mouthfeel, creamy and light at the same time. On the way out of your mouth the beer leaves a sense of fruit, maybe even a little caramel, and the wonderful sweetness of the Tripel style beer. Overall, a great beer that is deserving of the title Abbey ale."
"I think St. Bernardus could be paired with cheeses for an experimental jaunt into beer-food pairings. Perhaps Manchego or Romano."
"Feels lovely in the mouth. For me, perfect balance of creaminess with carbonation for this style. Drinkability is also very high, to get a 5 it would need to have the sweetness tidied up just a touch in the aftertaste."
"D) This is an excellent Tripel but as is the case with Tripels, beware the 8% alcohol."
"M, D- This tripel had pleasant flavors and was drinkable, but the CO2 level was over-exuberant and rough, which scoured the palate, negatively affecting the mouthfeel."
"Notes: Nice Tripel that is big and fruity but also well balanced. A very solid offering from a very good brewery. Definitely worth trying."
"D: I wasnt really impressed, my first experiences with a tripel, so maybe I tried the wrong one."
"Good beer, can hold it's own among its Belgian Triple cousins."
"Mouthfeel is nice and rich, not nearly as nice as Westmalle Tripel but still good and full. Taste is sweet and rich with tons of spiciness. drinkability takes a hit due to floaties."
"St. Bernardus always impresses, I don't have that much to say about it besides it is fantastic."
"This one gets a fair amount of hype, and I like this style, so I wanted to try it. So this being PA, of course, I had to shell out about a gazillion $$s for a case. Frankly, a little disappointing for the money, but I think my expectations were a little high. A typical tripel with a big head, flavorful, fruity, hides the ETOH fairly well. If I had to do it again, I'd get a case of La Fin Du Monde for about 60% of the cost."
"D - If only all of St. Bernardus's stuff didn't do this to me then I would be happy. Maybe I'll have to try one of the 750's, but if that does this I'll be extremely unhappy. Honestly, what's probably a great tripel ended up being a drainpour."
"Highly drinkable. One of the best, if not the best Tripel that I've had."
"This is a tasty drink, worthy of sips and chugs all night long."
"Overall Impression: One of the best Tripel's out there. Even ReRe liked this one!!! I'll be drinking this one quite often!"
"Medium-thick mouthfeel, well-carbonated, and very drinkable. A delicious example of a Belgian tripel."
"Up until now, Chimay Cinq Cents had all I ever wanted from a tripel. Today the jolly monk pictured on the St. Bernardus bottles blew my mind. Buy, consume, contemplate, be at peace. That is all."
"This beer pours great golden honey color with a foamy white head and fine bubbles. Aromas of banana, citrus and honey. The palate is medium bodied with nutty malty flavors with hints of dried apricots and the bubbles are almost champagne like. Definitely give this beer a try"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this guy, definitely a great tripel to check out."
"I got this one in a four pack sampler of st. b's abt 12, triple, pater 6 and prior 8 with a chalice for 12 bucks. i was shocked there was a three pack of chimays with a chalice right next to it for 20 bucks, and personally i think that st. bernardus has better stuff. i love it."
"Golden pour with a billowing three fingers of head and great lacing. The aroma is very fruity but it is not bright...tough to explain really. Perhaps if you left out a banana in the sun for 3 hours it might smell like this. Some crayon, yeast, and light spices as well. The flavor is full of yeast and banana peel. Not really as complex as I expected, but still quite tasty and easy to drink. The body is light and carbonation levels are very high but not really prickly. This one doesn't really standout for the style, but on its own it is a nice beer."
"Overall I was hoping for a bit more clarity in flavor and aroma. As it stands it's still a solid beer though a bit one-dimensional (which isn't a phrase often used in reference to St. Bernardus). Worth a shot."
"Now i will finish this wonderfull tripel"
"Light and clean in flavor, somewhat candied vs. the Westmalle offering. Otherwise brisk and fruity. An easy drinking Tripel with a nice texture on the feel and a good spice profile. Touch sweet in the end but not nearly as are many of the style. Good balance.."
"The alcohol is covered up by the taffy sweetness, making this drink seem very not-harsh. It also has a light, refreshing bent to it. Like many of the better tripels, it seems nowhere near as potent as it really is. Which in my mind correlates to a high drinkability score."
"I'm new to this style, but I liked this a lot!"
"D. good, not great. i expected more out it and felt a little let down. i cared for it less and less as it warmed and opened. i may retry later to give it another chance, something may have been off with the palate, possible spicy food early but there is no indication in my scribbles."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Moderate head quickly fades into a hazy golden body leaving thin, soapy lacing on the glass. Lovely aroma consists mainly of some banana, apricot and sweet malts. Taste, upon warming, is malty sweet, slight clove, some mild citrus, mild hops, juicy and just plain delicious. One of the benchmarks by which all tripels should be measured. Insane masking of ABV, can't taste one bit of it. Awesome brew in every way, shape and form."
"The beer is sharp on the tip, giving a feel of tartness. The warmth from the alocohol is worth savouring and accentuates the spicy notes in the aftertaste. This is not a very complex tasting beer, but has great depth. Before you know it, it will be gone. I have thoroughly enjoyed this Tripel, and I'm very keenly looking out for the Abt 12."
"D- I could probably drink a 4 pack of these quickly and easily, which is bad since it's 14.99 for a 4 pack."
"O: vanilla manipulates taste very strongly, less would be better, excellent dessert beer but is not good in many circumstances, not the kind of tripel i prefer"
"D – This is an immensely palatable Tripel."
"Drinkability: Very nice and malty tripel that is good for the style. The alcohol is well hidden. A sipper, I do want drink it again, but not immediately afterward due to the complexity."
"D - Very high, refreshing. Wouldn't have minded a 750ml bottle."
"Will pour a five+ finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Hazy pale amber color. Honey and fruit nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is light honey, yeast and pear. Nice triple. Higher ABV is hidden. $17.00 for a gift pak of four 330ml bottles from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D: Deceptively light in taste and small in bottle serving, this beer is soothing going down the throat. If it was free flowing, I couldprobably drink quite a bit before I realized I was getting blitzed. Even the burps from this beer are pretty tasty."
"Update: This one has grown on me since my first tasting (over 3 years ago!) and has now become a regular staple in my household. The missus loves it and I now agree. I don't know if it has changed or I have (probably the latter?) I find myself drinking tripels quite a bit these days and I never refrigerate them. This one I just crack open and pour straight from the cellar into a tulip glass. A classic tripel and probably the best from St.Bernadus!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a medium white head. Smells strongly of pear and alcohol. Taste is light grain up front, a spicy yeast strain in the middle, and a hint of tartness in the finish. Very little appearance of alcohol which is nice, as it can be apparant in many tripels. Mouthfeel is mindbogglingly smooth, low carbonation. Very rich. Good drinkability. This isnt as good as some tripel's I have had, but it is a good beer that I would gladly drink again."
"D - This is a fantastic triple, I think the best one I have tried in recent memory (maybe of all time). Just another fantastic brew from St. Bernardus, I wouldn't expect anything less."
"D: This one is an excellent sipper, worthy of the price. (But it does hit the wallet kind of hard at $5 for an 11.2 oz. bottle) Out of all the tripels I've had, only a few have been below average. Out of all the tripels that originate from Belgium, this one is in the top five, so far, along with Westmalle, Tripel Karmeliet, Affligem and La Fin Du Monde (this ones from Canada, actually). Chimay and Golden Carolus are just behind these five. Each of these brews all offer subtle variances of the tripel style, so all are worthy to try."
"Really good beer, better than I have had in a while. I would drink this beer again and again. It goes down well and then has a great aftertaste. It stands up as one of the better tripels I have had. You really notice the balance in this tripel against most of the other tripels on the market."
"Drinkability: This is reasonably drinkable and I'd not turn down a chance at another one. That being said, while I thought this was a nice tripel, I had expected more based on the reviews I read before purchasing it. I actually prefer the Watou triple from the same brewery."
"A very easy drinking Tripel."
"Taste: Fruity malty flavor with only a slight alcoholic taste in the background. Pretty sweet but not a normal strong sweetness, it is a nice fruity sweetness."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice a pale yellow with a one finger white head. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells strong of belgian yeast, with orange, apple, and white grapes. The taste is unmistakable belgian, again with apples and white grapes being the leaders of the fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is high in carbonation, which is just right for the style. When they wrote the book on begian Tripel, this is definatly a standard."
"Pours a dirty blonde hefe type color. There is a small one finger white lace that disipates after a few minutes. There is a small amount of cling to the glass. I am getting smell notes of fruit and subtle yeast, nothing that overpowers. The taste is reminscent of the smell with a strong presence of fruity flavors followed with a yeasty after taste. Not bad, but a beer taste that reminds me a lot of wheat beers. A decent tasting beer that is rather smooth for its ABV. I am not a huge fan of this style but not a bad offering from this brewery."
"D- easy to finish, and probably my favorite of the 4 beers in the gift set. id check this out again and i think it might be something to share with non beer advocates if they appreciate wheat beers."
"St. Bernardus makes some world class beers and this one is no exception. It's an insanely drinkable, uber-fruity, sweet tripel that holds it's own with some of the best out there. I love this stuff."
"Poured into St. Bernardus goblet a cloudy deep golden color with two fingers of pillowy white head that retained well and laced nicely. Aroma is initially fruity lemon/orange and spicy with a yeastiness creeping in on the tail. Taste is fruity and spicy but less defined than the smell. Feel is light to medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Good beer very enjoyable and an example of the style."
"I'm more of a fan of dark Belgian ales (LOVE their Abt 12), but I still enjoyed this Tripel from St. Bernardus."
"I love this and will buy it again!"
"The drinkability is exceptional, especially for a (relatively) lower abv. tripel. I liked Karmelet a wee bit more, But i wouldn't hesitate to put this in the same 'world class'"
"D: this is another winner from St. bernardus. I prefer the ABT 12 over this, but it definitely is a nice representation of a tripel"
"Mouthfeel- Sticky medium body with a high carbonation level"
"This is a beer to pour into an appropriate glass and savor for over an hour, which is exactly what I did when reviewing it. I don't have a single complaint."
"The third of three beers with glasses my wife gave me still to come..."
"J"
"I was a thrown a curveball and while this beer was more than just drinkable, it wasn't what I expected when I bought it."
"Drinkability: Smellability is very high, but I really dont think I'll be going back for this again. Its a good beer, but not the best. Not cheap either. Maybe I was too harsh. I had high expectations I guess."
"Pours hazy burnt orange with nice fluffy white head. Aroma of cloves, bananas and spice. First sip mirrors the aroma, great clean taste of fruits and spices, followed my a nice sugar sweetness. This is a great Tripel, will be even better on a warm summer day. Has a great smooth clean mouthfeel. This is an oustanding example of this style."
"bought it at the local slga to my surprise would defiantly buy again if available reasonable price tag at $3.00 a bottle proper glass was not available so drank out of bottle head lasted long time in bottle drank it well chilled"
"11.2 oz. slender Belgian bottle with 30/01/09 on the back label; sampled November '08. Pours a gorgeous bright honey color with lots and lots of carbonation, capped with a bone-white fine-bubbled head that deposits loads of lacing on the glass. That's an easy five for appearance. The aroma takes a while to open up, but when it does there's a good dollop of orange, yeast and perhaps a touch of honey. Simple, but delicious. Similar on the palate - a little floral, a little fruity, with orange, spicy yeast, perhaps some honey, sweet and nutty malts, a faint breath of alcohol and a touch of spicy, mildly bitter hops. All of this on top of a lively, full and creamy, yet smooth body that has a lightly chalky yeast dryness. This is an amazing beer. So flavorful, yet delicate; complex and layered, but somehow simple. It's on the low end of the ABV scale for a tripel, but I like it that way because it is so damn drinkable that one small bottle is nowhere near enough to slake my thirst for this brew."
"O: Very solid beer, and worthy of the St. Bernardus name. This beer is a treat and an excellent benchmark to compare others against."
"D: Like the other Bernardus beers this is a great one. Still not my favorite style but it's growing on me."
"Poured a cloudy gold in goblet glass with great carbonation for a one-finger head that slowly dies and is a constant along with lace down the glass. A great orange/citric smell along with tartness and yeast and has hints of figs, berries and sweet malts. A medium-bodied beer that ranges from fluffy sweet and smooth to sharp and sour. Started crisp with a tart fruit taste, like sour orange, but passed smoothly and the sweet caramel malt picks it up and it goes down easy with a sweet backbite. Other flavors include berries and figs and hints of toffee. This is a great beer that I could have all day."
"Pour a yellow body with an orange hue. Head is huge, as with most tripels, and frothy and looks to be bleached white. Nice looking black sediment sitting in the bottom. Aromas are subtle. Apricots, some malts, citrus, rum. Slightly sour, and some citrus flavours are present. Peaches, and sweet malts too. Good. Finish is smooth and creamy, alcohol not detectable. Would have liked stronger flavour and aromas. Still a good example."
"I had two over the course of 3 hours. I didn't feel the alcohol - but was staying well hydrated and had a nice dinner of Wiener Schnitzel with Roasted potatoes during the first glass. A repeat offender for me."
"Bottle to glass. When I popped the top the suds immediately begin bubbling out (even though I was handling carefully). It was almostly completely foam in my glass (again, even after gentle pour). After settling down, it looked and smelled fine. Color of honey, but cloudy. Some juicy fruit and bubble yum on the nose. Taste had some cereal (cap'n crunch) flavors. Hops are there a bit but not much. Pretty tasty beer, would buy again."
"I mentioned in the review I would be staying at the brewery, well the first beer I had from the fridge in the Brouwershuys was a Triple and it was poured for me by no less than Hans Depypere, the owner of the brewery. The fridge is free to use if you are staying at the lovely appointed and furnished B&B."
"D- Overall a nice beer. I don't drink many Tripel's and this one makes me want to change that and start drinking more!"
"My initial impression of this beer was that it is not as good as my two other benchmark tripels (La Fin du Monde and Westmalle). I still think that they are a bit better, but this gets better and better the farther I go down the glass. I will definitely be looking for this again."
"D: A very good tripel....very tasty and well crafted."
"Very balanced taste and the alcohol was very masked for 8%. Beer had average carbonation and was very drinkable. This was the first St. Bernardus I have ever tried and I'm looking forward to tasting the rest."
"D: A very, very good tripel... not the standout of its class, but definitely near the top, and very drinkable for its ABV."
"Overall: I have to say, that I don't really like triples. Until today....What a fantastic beer. I would like (and will) drink this one again and again!."
"D: Very enjoyable tripel, an excellent brew. This one's quite fruity, whereas the Westmalle is a much spicier trappist tripel."
"Notes: I found this Tripel to be just a little ruff around the edges, heavy and well, just a little bit above average. I'm not sure if I just got a bad bottle or maybe it could use some more time to condition in the bottle or maybe less."
"This is a fine beer. Not great, but fine."
"This brew is awesome; a very drinkable brew. Has a smooth moothfeel and is a pleasure to drink. One of the best - if not the best Triple I have had."
"Drinkability- I have to say in this current moment of my beer life this is probably the best belgian style tripel I have ever had, just so balanced so complex and so enjoyable, the ingrediants are so clean and you get no sense of 8 percent alcohol, what to me I love about this tripel is that the spicyness stops it from getting to sweet like some triples and keeps it balanced with beauty, one I could drink all nite and will keep around, the best of anyone style isnt something to be used lightly but to me at the current point this is it, try it you wont be sorry"
"Pours a lightly hazed gold with a huge white head that lays down sheets of lace. Exceptional for the style. Sweet, grainy malt aroma, with lots of honey, bread and citrus. Lots of honey in the flavour, but married to a wonderful yeasty breadiness. Lightly grainy with a warming finish, and a kiss of sweet citrus hops. Medium bodied and well-carbonated in a billowing, soft way. Ridiculously drinkable, and I want another. Now."
"D-- Quite drinkable, excellent beer and excellent Triple. Once it gets warm it changes a bit and the alchohol becomes more obvious but when a little colder the fruit is much more obvious. Not that that is a bad thing. Easily have 2 of these and want more. Well disguised beer."
"Drinkability: Beautiful beer to sip over the course of 45 minutes or so. Could definitely have a few of these with the over-all alcohol being very well integrated."
"D-Exquisite, though the heaviness may make it a bit too much at times."
"The taste is pear and hay at first, with mineral, slightly raisiny but mostly dry alcohol, and a hint of lemon pulp, but all thin and dry, with a finish and aftertaste of dry fruit candy without the sweetness. This leaves it largely one-dimensionl and bland."
"you cant go wrong with a stbernardus. this one pours a light caramel color, dried fruits aroma with a great mix of brightness. taste is excellent, a perfect example of the style, somewhat heavy bodied but light enough on the delivery, sweet fruit flavors and a hint of malts. drinkability exceptional; mouthfeel and taste is very good, despite abv could drink for long periods"
"As far as drinkability, I don't see any problem with me drinking this whole bottle all by my lonesome. A little strong for an all day beer, but definitely a great introduction to St. B or tripels in general."
"The tatse is wonderful, very smooth from start to finish. Great notes of hops and spice. Very drinkable from start to finish."
"Drinkability: eminently quaffable."
"this is a great triple im happy i got to drink one"
"D- Heck yes. This is very reasonably priced at the store I go to for a very superior product."
"This one sure does drink well. Every sip makes me want to take another. Its fairly strong, but its not overpowering. Complex, yet mellow. Good brew here."
"d - delicious beer, one of the best tripels i've had."
"#1 out of the St. Bernardus six pack sampler. Poured into my 25cl Chimay goblet, a nice golden orange with some sediment and lots of carbonation rising, one finger head that seems to last for the entire time the beer is consumed, leaves great lacing down the whole glass, a coat of it. One of the creamiest looking heads I have ever seen. Smells of light fruit, raisins, yeast, malts and maybe some alcohol, get that banana hefe like smell too. Tastes of light fruits/citrus, hefe banana, raisins, a tiny bit of alcohol, and some malts. Mouthfeel is great, very creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation, a bit of alcohol warming. Drinkability is good for a belgian, taste is surprisingly refreshing, 8% alcohol can only be sensed a little bit, great beer, will have again."
"Notes: Hands-down the best tripel I've tried to date - IMO it kicked Westmalle's ass in every way imaginable. Great beer."
"750ml corked & caged, poured into a chalice. It is hazy copper gold with a rocky white head and active carbonation. Smells of honey, peaches, and a slight medicinal phenol. Tastes peppery and sharp, then dusky malt. It has a hay-like flavor that is very pleasant. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and slippery. Drinkability is great. Now excuse me while I finish this. Typing is making my beer foam up."
"Pale cream color with hazy body and creamy, off-white head. Banana smell comes through first, shortly followed by spice and citrus. Taste is especially yeasty, with a complex, sugary structure and nutmeg/allspice sharpness and cherry tanginess. Exceptionally well-balanced and light Witbier (doesn't finish like a Tripel), that finishes as yeasty as it starts. Like biting into a liquid, fried plantain. YUM!!"
"D - Doesnt feel as stong as the 8.0 ABV suggest so could drink a lot of this."
"Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation and an overall crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol very well hidden, not too sweet and overall a very good tripel."
"I didn't particularly enjoy this beer as it tasted a little funky to me. The mouthfeel would have made this an easy to drink beer, but the flover just didn't do it for me."
"Had a bottle at the Moan and Dove. The drink had a murky yellow-gold appearance with a slick lacing and patchy, island-like head. Aromas were really great: cloves smells mixed with an apparent sour, citrus smell. Taste was utterly excellent. Had a great vanilla cream taste mixed with that ripe citrus taste. Mouthfeel follows the taste quite complementary. The smooth/crisp dichotomy is perfect. Overall, very, very good."
"I'm new to the St Bernardus range and can say this and the quad are some very fine beers"
"Final Thoughts: Very rich and delicious but still pretty light for a strong Belgian. It is a good staple for tripels."
"If you find this, be sure to pick it up!"
"It immediately struck me as the perfect summer day beer but this is one to be enjoyed all year round."
"I'm not a fan of the huge carbonation either even if it is part of the style."
"An all around enjoyable almost session type beer even with an 8% ABV."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable tripel. Probably my favorite St. Bernardus offering. It's not necessarily the one I would go seek out if I was in the mood for a tripel, but one I enjoyed drinking and would have again."
"The taste is quintessential Belgian Tripel, very representative of the style. There is plenty of prickly mouthfeel, Belgian yeastiness, lots of delightful peppery spices and leafy hop flavors in the finish. The mid section is loaded with sweet malts, some apricot, orange rind, some clove flavors, some coriander, some other spices that add a bit of a bite. There is a bit of an ABV presence in the mid section through to the finish. The beer warms nicely and additional floral flavors on the palate come out. This is one of those incredibly complex Belgian beers that provide something slightly different with each sip, and really whet the taste buds as it warms. There are some sourish notes towards the finish, maybe a little mustiness on top of the apricot and citrus. There is a bit of a throaty ABV burn in the finish so the booziness is not entirely hidden with this beer. The beer is medium bodied and is more of a sipping experience because of the carbonation, prickly mouthfeel, and ABV. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"An exceptional tripel."
"D - It's cleanliness would entice one to drink a good bunch of these, however, the ABV would leave one on their ass if they put these back all afternoon."
"I scored 4 bottles from work at a measely $6 a bottle. I'm stashing two for a a couple of years to taste on special occasions. A true top notch beer. How I'm just having my first one I'll never know."
"D: Even though the alcohol taste is very apparent and there is medium carbonation, this one is highly drinkable."
"D - I really love Tripels, and this one is no exception, a really great beer that every beer lover (not just Belgian beer lovers) should try"
"A medium bodied beer, with a sharp and hard carbonation"
"Golden color, somewhat darker with a thick head that seems to stick around for a bit. Tons of carbonation come up from the bottom of the glass. The smell is fruity and peppery. The taste is quite spicy with the fruitiness taking a backseat. The alcohol is quite well hidden but the spiciness brings it out a bit. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, yet has quite a bit of carbonation. Drinkability is there."
"D: This could be one of the best tripels beyond Karmelite that I have put down to date. As stated above, I have enjoyed the Belgian Strong Ale, Dubbel and Quad, but I think this may be their best effort. The ability to taste both spectrums of the PH levels of sweet and tart is the mark of learned breweres indeed. Many thanks Brouwerij St. Bernardus."
"So, this is my favorite ""accessible from the OC"" beer at the moment... Just finished one off with some cheese and crackers, what a great way to start the weekend!"
"Overall - Review #100 was not a disappointment."
"Although the carbonation has died down considerably there's still enough left to help create a crisp, prickly yet clean and medium body drink. Fairly easy drinking Tripel. Another solid brew from the guys at St Bernardus."
"This is one of the most unusual, complex and tasty brews I've enjoyed to date, though a high ABV keeps the drinker in check."
"Notes - Trippels aren't my cup of tea, too much spice. This one however offered a good balance of all the required elements and really was enjoyable."
"Well done!."
"D - I want to take in copious amounts of this brew with huge gulps. It's amazingly good, slides right down the throat, provides the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness, and has absolutely no hint of alcohol. St. Bernardus Tripel has provided me with one of those few amazing moments along the great journey."
"A little disappointed in the appearance after all the great things I've heard about St. Bernardus. Still this is an excellent brew. Challenging to define, yet very pleasant in the moment."
"4.5 D: Very drinkable, but for the price I'd take other stuff."
"D- easier than others but still a sipper."
"all in all a good Tripple, not great, but solid."
"A delicious triple/tripel, especially as the fruit esters add a sweet, delicate fruitiness that nicely compliments the assortment of spices and the grainy malt character. I enjoyed the St. Bernie Tripel, but I must say it probably falls a close second to La Fin du Monde as my triple/tripel of choice at present. Nonetheless, this is quite a worthy Belgian Trappist ale and one I would definitely recommend to anyone seeking out exemplary Belgian beers."
"Truly a great tripel."
"OVERALL: A very drinkable triple. The appearance kept this one back a bit overall, but the rest of the experience was a pleasure. One I'll be getting again for sure. Recommended."
"This is a great beer, I really enjoyed it and it is going on my list as a must have on hand. So refreshing it could almost be a lawnmower beer, but not at 8%. But when you are done, relaxing on your deck, this is a great beer to relax with."
"Drinkability: A bit more drinkable than most triples, this lower bodied beer coupled with the excellent complex flavor makes this beer very drinkabile."
"This beer is good, but not great."
"As to the taste, I was somewhat disappointed, having just days earlier tried the Karmeliet. Still, judged strictly on its own merits, this was a rather drinkable tripel that I'd be happy to imbibe in the future. Well carbonated and fruity with some spice, but not enough for my taste. I think if anything, the mouthfeel was too comfortable, and not really a tasting challenge."
"D- Definitely moving through this one. Good one, watch out for the ABV."
"4.5 M&4.5 D: med-bodied, quite fluffy on the palate and pretty soft overall, and I wonder where the alc. is gone?! This is a good quality, well-balanced, and yet moderately-flavoured Tripel, with plenty of yeasty elements to entertain the palate and nose. It's less fruity and sweet on the palate than on the aroma, and that's a good thing to me! Another solid Abbey Ale, and, be warned, it is highly quaffable!"
"Drinkability: Beware the good stuff."
"Overall, well worth the price for a once-in-a-while treat. (on my budget)"
"Good Easter day beer for sure. Would drink it again but I still love the ABT 12. Should have maybe saved that for last."
"Drinkability is better than any of the others of this style I've enjoyed. I think this bottle will be gone much too quickly for my sobriety's own good."
"D - I could easily drink these all night. The alcohol barely noticeable."
"D - Good drinkability as with most, I want this on tap!"
"D: Flavorful and smooth (for a tripel). disguises the alcohol well."
"D: Goes down easily. Overall, a nice experience. My first tripel, and a good one, it seems to me."
"The taste is smooth and subtle. Milder than Westmalle Tripel or La Fin du Monde but all the right parts are there for you to enjoy. While this wasn't my all time favorite the first time around it's still a very high quality beer. I have another bottle that I'll open soon and enjoy. If you like your Tripels with strong flavor maybe this isn't for you but it's going to please a lot of people."
"medium bodied brew, little bit of alcohol noticeable, but very drinkable. but you must take it slow with this one as it seems to kind of creep up on you after a few. great beer, i highly recommend it. will be drinking it again as well as ageing a couple in the future."
"MF&D - Medium bodied. Crisp and pretty easy to drink dispite the 8% ABV."
"M - Silky, thin bodied but not watery."
"This poured a hazy gold color with fluffy white head. It smelled like wild Belgian yeast and lemon hops with earthy caramel malt and a hint of cashew and alcohol and bitter chocolate. It tasted like wild but creamy yeast and salty caramel and confectioners sugar, with lemon hops and a bit of white grapes. It was slightly thick with a fair amount of carbonation, and had a smooth sour and sweet aftertaste. Overall this was surprisingly good. Tripels usually aren't my thing, but this one was very enjoyable! It had a fantastically clean and delicate flavor, and good body. The alcohol was noticeable but not too strong, so it was easy to drink but better to sip. By far the best tripel I've had."
"Taste a little bready, honey, and caramelized pears. Can hardly taste the alcohol at all. Very drinkable. I love it."
"If I could afford it, I would be drinking this every night."
"No matter how many times I revisit them, I've never been won over by either St. Bernardus tripels (this or the Watou Tripel). I just haven't tasted the spicy, summery, fruity effervescence that I love about Tripels. This is still a pleasurable thing to drink nonetheless and I wouldn't veer anyone away from trying it. But for me personally, I'll probably stick to Westmalle and Karmeliet for my tripels and leave St. Bernardus to the dubbels and quads."
"M - Not overly gassy. This beer was well done. All in all a very successful evening."
"D - drinkable with an interesting complex flavor, but definitely not my favorite tripel"
"Very good beer that is not boring and has a mildly complex taste."
"Very drinkable, a bit different recipe than other Trappist and very good. Depends on what one likes from this style."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: I loved this beer. VEry well balanced in taste and flavor. Light carbonation and a pleasant aftertaste."
"Overall- This beer may have some good flavors to it but i could not tell over the alcohol."
"Notes: This is one fruity tripel! Very pleasant flavors all wrapped up in a nice, tight package. Nothing overplays its hand, and all the flavors work to counterbalance each other. Well-built, complex, and very easily drinkable. Nicely done!"
"D - this is one of the best Tripels I have ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"D - The same carbonation bite on the mouthfeel results in a very filling beer. The ABV is beyond that of a normal session beer, but probably well within the limits of a tripel. Flavors are not so aggressive to make this an undrinkable beer."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly light for a big ABV beer. More than a couple would take their toll, a price I'd be willing to pay if I had that many around."
"OVerall perhaps THE best representation of the style!"
"D: A very nice tripel that lives up to its reviews. I'm glad I grabbed it."
"Pours a golden yellow-red color, extremely fizzy. Very clear looking. Big big head, slightly off-white, lasting. Extremely floral aroma, dark fruit. Similar aroma to Allagash Triple, one of my favorites. Very floral taste, dark fruit, sweet, not thick, sightly creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Floral aftertaste. Similar in almost every way to Allagash Triple."
"Creamy and mildly sweet. The finish is more sour than sweet. The body is thinner than most Tripels and the carbonation is near the level of soda. The alcohol presence is not overwhelming, which I like. Overall, this is an easy Tripel to enjoy."
"Medium body. Good carbonation."
"D= average. This is a good intro to belgians I think. Its not over powering with the complex flavors but its still got the asic taste. Very nice."
"D: I could probably handle two...."
"Pours a hazy golden color, some floaties suspended in the beer, foamy white head fades slowly into a nice 1/4"" layer atop the beer, some spotty/clingy lacing on the glass. Some tropical fruit aromas, maybe a hint of vanilla bean, and a slightly bracing whiff of alcohol. Sort of a dulled pear flavor, some green apple flesh, really subdued, spicy on the lips, and some heat from the alcohol. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy, some lingering fruitiness/spiciness. I think this would be much better with a plate of food beside it; on its own, it's not wowing me."
"D= This is a very good tripel, that doesn't go overboard with the ABV. At 8%, this is a tripel that I can have a few of and not worry about paying the price later. Highly recommended!"
"Well done beer!"
"D: Tastes best as it warms and goes down relatively easy"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with carbonation keeping it lively."
"A great Tripel with a very well-balanced flavor. This beer pours amber orange with an off-white soapy head that leaves a great deal of lacing. I'm drinking out of a St. Bernardus Goblet and that just makes it all the prettier (the glass is great, by the way, almost an over-sized wine glass). The head is wonderfully Belgian. This beer has its share of delicate funky yeast. The flavor is a careful balance of bitterness and earthiness. There are some good sweet malt notes lurking in the background, and I wish that they were a touch stronger or richer or something, but I guess that's not the way of most Belgians. It's a very good beer and evinces a great deal of craftsmanship. I always feel a little wanting when I love a brewery's Quad and then try the Tripel. I just can't push those scores higher, knowing what St. Bernardus can do with that 12."
"D: Incredibly spicy. Zesty and well rounded. Drank like a dream and probably one of the best per style ive tasted."
"After getting over the initial appearance, this was a quite good beer. I could easily enjoy one, but there are a lot of good beers out there and will likely only have another if someone else purchases it."
"Saved the best for last this weekend. Dark gold with a swiss-cheese looking white head. Expected spice and yeast, but more apple and fruits. Effervescent mouthfeel. Musty yeast and dry, fruity tartness blend well with the nutmeg-like sweetness. A very good beer."
"D: A very drinkable tripel, especially for those who like them sweet. Enjoyable and not overly alcohol-laden although more than one would be tough due to the sweetness."
"An excellent tripel save for the shit appearance that kind of ruined it. Easily one of the best overall tasting ones that I've had. Pick up a bottle of this."
"Poured gently into chalice. A cloudy pour with less than 1 finger of head (this is how I prefer it, more head would have been easily obtained). A light amber/dark yellow color. Very attractive with nice lacing. Very pleasant, welcoming aroma. The taste is pleasantly bold, without being overpowering. As you work through the glass, the fruit flavors become more apparent. Full, enveloping mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable, you could settle in with nice assortment of meats and cheeses and drink several of these very easily."
"D: Tripels are not my favorite at all, but like I mentioned above this is one of the best I've had, and it may encourage me to try others. Most of the tripels I have had have not been nearly as complex as this example, seemingly relying on alcohol content alone. I will try more, but for now, if I am reaching for a tripel, it will be this one."
"Poured a VERY pale golden straw color with a fairly cloudy haze. The head is massive, hard to pour correctly unless you go super slow. The head is fluffy and super light. Incredible lacing on the glass and crazy rockiness to the head as it lowers. The smell is typical of an awesome pale belgian. Hints of apples, apple cider/juice, belgians spices and pepperiness. The flavor is sweet, fruity and peppery.The light peppery hop flavor is no challenge to the malty sweetness. The warmer it gets the maltier it tastes. The feel is smooth and slightly tingly from the carbonation. This is very drinkable. Great belgian pale."
"An absolute breeze to drink. This is a lush and complex tripel that really satisfies the soul."
"This is a terrific beer from a great brewery. Don't pass up the chance to try this beer if you happen upon it."
"Poured this darker golden amber into a pint glass. This beer gave a huge amount of head to start with then reduced to a plentiful of lacing.The aroma is that of spice and smell of the alcohol. However the taste was profound in greatness at it gave a cinnimon and caramel taste. Overall this was a great beer."
"Future outlook: Eh, hard to say. Decent, but uninspiring IMO, so I won't soon seek it out again."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. A fine example of the style. If you are a fan of the style, this is a must."
"M/D: Light carbonation with a medium body. High ABV doesn't deter the drinker at all. Maybe just because the beer as a whole is just so damn good."
"D- This is a very nice beer. It makes a good intro beer to belgian beer virgins :)"
"Not only one of my favorite Tripels, but one of my favorite Belgians brews altogether. St. Bernardus stands as one of the best breweries in the world."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma of white fruits such as apple, grape, and pear. Also, strong alcohol and spice presence. Pretty carbonated at first but becomes intense as it warms. Nice balance of fruitines, maltiness, alcohol, and slight hops. Very crisp enjoyable tripel."
"VERY drinkable. i am usually not a fan of belgians but i could just keep drinking this. and so can my dog apparently. i spilled a little on the floor and she hasnt stopped licking the spot. maybe i should share the wealth. solid brew. get it and drink it."
"D: Really nice tripel, it goes down almost too easy. Definite repurchase in the future."
"Drinkability: I'm not usually a huge fan of tripels, but I'm a fan of this tripel. Very enjoyable."
"D: Pretty near perfect. As she warms in your glass she gets better."
"This follows the style closely. Not something I am crazy about, but good. If you like Tripel's this is a must try."
"Pours a nice light orange amber with a finger sized off-white head. Nice spicyness, belgian aroma. Light orange, raisin, and a bit of caramel. A bit of alcohol, but not too bad. Nice sweetness, very good carbonation as it dances along the tounge. Very dangerously drinkable."
"D - Drinkable, yet don't really care for this brand of tripel. Wondering why others like this beer so much. Several improvements could be made in the appearance, taste, and mouthfeel to be made into a more drinkable beer."
"Notes: Was looking forward to trying this (after having had the Abt 12 twice before) and I was not dissapointed. Great beer."
"this is really something. beautiful looking amber. rather crisp clear with a healthy head. not much lace. but consistent with each mix of the glass. i have never really comprehended the grace in the smell of a triple. they all seems just like cotton candy to me. this was different. a very complex relationship between the malt, the Belgian sugar cane and the alcohol made the alcohol very well placed. the malt, cane, and hop gave off a floral complex sweetness. the menu at hopleaf stated: a fragrance of rosewater. it was quite gentle. had a delicate sweet to it and a very mild citrus. the malt gave it body and a bland flower petal nature. the smell carries over into something close to a honeysuckle flower, picked and eaten whole. the sugar was subtle but delicately complex. banana, apple, plum. a light crisp hop finish. excellent feel to the last drop. really a great example of the use of Belgian sugar cane... a must try.↲↲Had it again and had determined that freshness really put an edge on this one. Seems gilded in sugar as it over ripes."
"Pours out a pale tan color, like a summer wheat field. Fluffy head that drops to nothing very rapidly and leaves just a ring where the head and beer once met. Smells of farmhouse spices and tastes as good as a french hill side. It manages to be light and chewy at the same time a wonderful balance. At 8ABV I'm not sure how drinkable it is, but I dont think I'll have any trouble with the 750."
"This drinks extremely well - very clean and bright with deep grain heartiness. Alcohol is quite hidden. A classic effort."
"750ml bottle. Had to use a wrench to get the cork out. Gave a nice ""pop."" Carefully poured this one into a Westmalle chalice, slowly so as not to disturb the yeast in there. Golden, chill-hazed, pineapple yellow. Maybe some light orange color in the middle. Boozy aroma, yeasty, citrus fruity, and slightly sweet. Flavor starts out sweet, hints of apricot and oranges, maybe some pineapple, fruity to say the least. A wheat twang and bready maltiness mix nicely. Middle becomes a little bitter, and then a powdery dry finish. Nice amount of carbonation on this one. Become creamier as it warms. Booze is well-hidden when cold, becomes much more apparent as it warms. A great Tripel, but probably not my favorite. It's definitely worth the money to pick up a single 750 rather than a 4-pack. I think I still prefer Tripel Karmeliet, however."
"Drinkability: A very smooth and very enjoyable tripel. I initially gave it lower ratings across the board, but it got better and better as the session progressed. Wish I had another one actually..."
"Very creamy and fluffy,delicate tastes well balanced flavors with yeasty, light fruityness hint of bannana/peach and pear with subtle spicyness no alcohol tastes,yet i can sense some heat,finishes with some green apple bitterness. Very light delicate mouthfeel,i just can't imagine drinking this all night,definatly a creeper."
"25.4oz. bottle"
"D: This beer for being such a big, beautiful style goes down incredibly easy. No trace of ABV in my opinion. The flavors and scents are great and the appearance is just freaking amazing. Very good and easy to drink beer. Big fan of this beer and an even bigger fan of St. Bernardus. A great brewery that always comes through with a fine beer."
"Overall a very drinkable great beer that highlights most of my favorite aspects of belgians."
"I was looking forward to this one, I love tripels, but this didn't quite stack up with the best tripels I've ever had. It's still a fine beer, and far above average."
"Feels good on the palate; quite thick and with a lot of carbonation. Overall, quite drinkable, but not my favorite tripel."
"M, D - Most Tripels I have had were very complex and lent themselves to slow, thoughtful drinking, but this beer (while still being complex) was very smooth. It's 8% ABV is hidden well, and one could easily gulp this down, if one was a hasty sort that is."
"Very good and glad I tried it."
"The alcohol is there but its not overpowering. The carbonation is slight but is noticeable. I could drink many of these but I would be in trouble afterwards. I'll be on the lookout for these."
"I love drinking it, it is so choice. If you have the means I highly recomend picking some up."
"Update: Just had this beer again. How amazing it is to get a beer of this quality at your local Bev-mo. I'm so glad to see the awesome reviews on this site. What a treat. More memorable than their Quad IMO."
"D: Easy going, despite 8% ABV. I'm reviewing a 330ml, which is enough to leave me content, though I've had the 750ml before and it went down just as easy. Overall, a good pick."
"I tried some Belgian Ales about 5 years ago. At that time I totally disrespected beer. I tried to chug any that was put in front of me in order to become intoxicated. Needless to say I was greatly missing out on the enjoyment of beers such as this. One must sip a Belgian Tripel to enjoy the complexities and find all the little subtleties therein. I am so glad that I started respecting beer and was able to discover a new world of good beer such as this one. Thank you Beer Advocate."
"A beer that truly needs decanting. Their were plenty of little chunks of yeast floating around an amber nectar. The head is a bit pathetic. A thin film of foam that one expects from mass produced lagers. However, for such a small head, it leaves plenty of lacing. The first smell is that bready, yeast smell. Considering the amount of yeast decanted, it's no surprise. A bit of apricots and oranges, plenty of warming alcohol and a bit of pepper as well. Tastes almost as good as it smells. Lots of malts, bit of fruit, bit of pepper. All well balanced, with one flavour not overpowering the other. Very thick, creamy mouthfeel that coats and gives a pleasant numbness to the throat. A beer that can be nursed for hours."
"It's no secret how good this beer is. This review just confirms it to me. Definitely in the upper class of its style."
"Overall: surprisingly pleasant, worth a try"
"Taken from notes. Poured into a Snifter at Ebenezer's in July. Pours a light orange with a thin white head. Smells of light malt sweetness and some candied sugar. Tastes like a tripel should. Nice spice up front with a sweet, sweet malt backbone. Lots of spice. Very, very drinkable. I love tripels and this may be my fave."
"Pours a hazy golden color. You could call it tan, brown, orange, yellow, golden, flat out murky and I don't think any answer is wrong. Very thick foamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Subtle hints of fruit spice and yeast in the aroma but nothing that'll just jump out at you. A very nice blend of citrus, spice, malt with a nice little alcohol presence in the flavor. A little tang and tart in the finish and aftertaste which is surely a sign of the alcohol content. While you know you're drinking alcohol it is balanced quite well. I like it."
"Pretty good; a solid Belgian beer. Not my favorite Tripel, but by BJCP guidelines it seems like a model example."
"Drinkability: Another very good tripel from the St. Bernard Brewery-err, I mean Brouwerij. Though, for me, when pit side-by-side with the Watou Tripel, I do defer to the Watou."
"At Cambrinus in Brugge. Served in a branded St. Bernardus goblet. Best before 26/11/10. Cloudy amber, white head. Banana explosion in the nose. Smoke, candy sugar. Pale malt. Fluffy palate, sweet, moderate leesy bitterness. Burnt banana bread, mmmm. Finishes on candy sugared pale malt. Warming finish, alcohol present, nutty. Really, really good stuff."
"Overall Impression - I know this beer isn't hyped as much as other Tripels, but it's one of the best I've had. Not only is it a solid Tripel, but it's just a very solid beer in general. Everything is pleasantly balanced, and proportioned. I don't feel any aspect of this beer is lacking, or overdone. I feel this beer is a wonderful representation of the style."
"Overall: An descent beer that I might get again."
"Clove, caramel, yeast, belgian spices, candy sugar, herbal flavors, greenery, earth round out the flavors with good carbonation and a creamy middle. Honey comb peach, white pepper, and hints of plantain follow through to the long finish. Delicious!!"
"This beer pours a very cloudy amber with lots of sediment in it and a 3 finger white head. The smell is of citrus with a little hint of alcohol. The taste is incredibly smoother, the main flavor seems to come from coriander and malts. The flavor is mild on this beer but very well balanced and well crafted. The mouthfeel is very nice especially well carbonated and very smooth. A highly drinkable brew certainly something I would like to kick back and drink while watching a nice movie."
"For a tripel I was expecting something slightly heavy and bold, but instead found a lighter more flavorful brew. The smell after pouring gave off a citrus aroma, the head came out big and fluffy, and the color was a murky gold. The taste was bold and refreshing, colored by citrus and not paired with a strong alcohol musk - none of the raisin hints I had come to expect. The mouthfeel was light but still had body. Definitely an enjoyable brew."
"D - I've come to realised this isn't my favourite style but this one seemed to pretty good. Not very commonly available here but something I'd buy every now and then to keep things interesting."
"Pours a somewhat hazy light orangish gold. Huge very persistent white head. Lots of visible carbonation. Ridiculous lacing. Aroma is very yeasty and earthy. Taste has a lot of light malty sweetness. Sweet citrus. Tangy, spicy and herbal. Oranges in the finish. A bit of warming alcohol. Intense but also rounded and balanced. Full bodied and well carbonated but not too much so. Very tasty. Really good and solid tripel overall."
"get some"
"Overall- A great triple but not my favorite of the bunch."
"Well-balanced with subtle complexities, this sips very easily."
"Soft and succulent, this is a very drinkable tripel that deviously hides its potent ABV."
"Could drink, but might burp it up for a week."
"D: This is hands down the best Tripel I've had. Why did i wait this long?"
"just want to say thanks to mr.moneyman for my two bottles, much appreciated ... interesting brew ... some honey and belgian honeycomb blocks of caramel .... is a tasty little morsel ... never wear sunglasses at night.. would have to say this is a very mellow trippel, maybe to much for some..."
"Overall impression: Very complex beer with a lot of good flavors, surprisingly easy to drink given the ABV. Definitely a great example of the style (if not the definitive example)."
"Pours a cloudy dirty yellow, with a big fluffy head. Smells of apples and other fruit. Tastes of apples, a bit of lemon, lime, honey, and who knows what. Problem is, there's just not that much flavor there--what there is is pretty weak, almost like you took Duvel and diluted it with 30% water. It's drinkable in the way that a light summer beer would be, but the flavors are so weak that it's not really that complex."
"D: A pleasure to drink; I'd forgotten how good this tripel is. Almost too easy to consume. Near the top of its class style-wise and certainly one to seek out. I know we'll be buying more sooner rather than later..."
"D- Delicious. Slightly intimidating complexity, but a very enjoyable drink. At 8% you have to be careful not to have too many."
"A pleasing drink, but I prefer the Abt 12."
"A great tripel."
"D- This is a great triple. Definitely a must have if you've never tried it."
"On tap at Track 84 in Warwick, RI. Pours deep orange/gold with a fluffy white head. Aroma of yeast, citrus, caramel, and hops. Taste much the same with strong notes of bread and yeast. Spicy on the finish. Very nice tripel. This is a staple of mine on tap."
"D-One was enough. Probably won't try again."
"This is a very nice Tripel. I had high expectations and I feel that they've been met. It's not quite as superb as the Abt 12, but it's no slacker. A slightly smoother mouthfeel would probably make it just as good. Keep in mind, I'm nitpicking. This is a very fine beer. Recommended."
"St. Bernardus Tripel pours a golden, peachish, orange with a nice fluffy head. The smell is good, medium to strong with malt and fruit like aromas. Its taste is good and unique, sporting a crisp floral like taste. Mouthfeel is light with a medium carbonation. The carbonation gives a kind of airy bubbly feel. Overall the drinkability of this beer is really good. It packs a good subltle kick with a well blended taste and smooth feel. I found it to get better at mid glass, but still it was nice the whole way through."
"Overall, a very nice example of style. I like this one better than the abt 12. Recommend."
"D- Very drinkable. The balance was amazing. No worries on this one at all a truly wonderful brew."
"Poured a nice dark golden color with a big time white and frothy head that leaves plenty of lacing around the side of the glass. Smell is very strong on candy sugar, malt, belgian fruits. Taste is very similar to the nose with a lot of the malt character, and a little grain. Mouth feel was very creamy and smooth. I kind of like this a little more than most triples, but I love the dubbel and the quad a little more."
"pours a cloudy apple cider like color with a smaller white head, smell is very good. has a wonderful strong yeast aroma, lots of sweet malt and fruits and spices. taste is very good, has a sharp alcohol presence to it, but still smooth and easy to drink. mouthfeel is good, could be a bit better, but who am i to judge. another great belgian."
"Love it. Another fantastic St. Bernardus brew!"
"Drinkabilty is very high, as this is a damn good trippel, tasty and complex enough to beget multiple glasses in order to fully comprehend the depth of flavor. Highly digestible, it's easy on the belly. Not to strong either, very well done."
"All in all, this is an outstanding beer. This is all about balance and knowing your craft. In my mind, this is what the art of brewing is all about - this is world class."
"Drinkability & Notes: A quality beer in which you can taste the craftsman shift. I would love to try off the tap at the brewery. Not as full and bold as I expected and the flavors really didn't linger in the mouth- maybe it just tastes so good I don't want it to end. All in all a must try."
"Deep golden in color with a tinge of red this poured a very fine thick head that slowly dissipated. The nose was filled with banana, spice, yeast and mineral. In the mouth this is medium-bodied very well-balanced with an enticing mouthfeel that has some richness but is also silky soft. The flavors follow the nose which makes this both a nice beer for the summer, due to the flavors, and the winter with the density. Very enjoyable."
"overall, a great beer, would buy this one again."
"D - This is an exceptional tripel. Certainly one of the best around."
"D - Drinkability is good. The warm alcohol brings this one in to the realm of sipping beer. The complexity of the brew is what makes you keep coming back for more. I would have no problem recommending this beer to anyone looking for something in the style of a tripel."
"good brew!! A !"
"D-Very enjoyable. Alcohol is well-disguised, and with how smoothly this one drinks, go easy."
"It's a hard call, but if anything I would rate this ahead of Westmalle Tripel. One of the great Belgian beers, and certainly one of the best I have ever tried. It is great drunk straight out of the fridge or at 14 degrees, which cannot be said for many of the higher ABV Belgian offerings."
"D: a great beer that I will enjoy again"
"D: Definitely one of the best tripels I've come across! Relatively high ABV is well hidden. Excellent complexity. The more I drink this, the more I get out of it and enjoy it. A tremendous beer and definitely one to seek out and enjoy!"
"d - I'm not getting much aftertaste with these triples, which I guess is normal. Outside of maybe duvel, this is the champagne of beers :) An excellent beer across the board."
"Finally sit down to review this fantastic beer, pours a dark russet brown with a slight orange hue to it, lots of head, fluffy and smooth, some nice lacing too. The aroma site back a bit, some nice fruits, some earthiness and spices. The taste comes out much more, a bouquet of all things delicious, the dark, rich, sugary fruits, some citrus too, the yeastiness, the earthy hops and herbal quality, absolutely delicious. The mouth is full, smooth and delicious, this is just an absolute treat and a testament to the celebration of the greatness of beer."
"This is a very good beer that grew on me more and more with each sip."
"Thick creamy body with perfect carbonation. This is for sure one of the best triples around."
"Mouthfeel is delicate but not too thin. Great complexity while remaining drinkable."
"Excellent, a must-try."
"Notes: Excellent, one of the best tripels. The perfect marriage of complexity and drinkability."
"Overall, a decent tripel, though not typical. It is certainly drinkable. Would go nice with a variety of food. There are certainly better tripels out there, but that shouldn't deter anyone from trying this."
"Oh St. Bernardus, how I love you so. It's hard to go wrong with this brewery and this Tripel does not disappoint. It has a dark heavy appearance in the glass with an initially foamy head. The scent is quite sweet, you can really capture the strong sugar presence. The taste is exquisite- beginning with a malty, yeasty fruit character and finishing with buttery toffee notes. Extremely complicated beer that makes you want to savor every single sip. Perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. As I've said with other St. Bernardus beers, the 8% ABV is well hidden under the delicious textures of the beer. Phenomenal, unforgettable beer."
"enjoy!"
"Released into the glass with a slightly opaque early-harvest orange, birthing forth with a touch of lively carbonation. The head wanes after a minute or two to well under one finger's width, light lacing that quickly sinks down the sides of the glass to settle into a sea of off-white with fine bubbles reflecting some of the liquid's apricot glow. Refreshing and crisp on the nose, this brew is playful on my tongue and quite light for its 8% abv - the alcohol well concealed amidst summer's slightly tart apples. An excellent drink to be sure, and thankful that I have one bottle left!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a deep yellow/gold color with a fairly decent head that dissipated pretty quickly. Sweet fruit and whiffs of alcohol in the nose. The taste is very crisp and very clean. VERY sweet, but not overly sweet. Very well balanced. A relatively light-bodied tripel that is quite drinkable. A fantastic beer."
" and grilled veggies."
"Drinkability - The best tripel i've had yet. Alcohol is well hidden, which helps add to the full body of this mothers milk."
"Drinks pretty easy for the complexity & abv. Not the best tripel out there, but pretty good"
"I actually prefer St. Bernardus Tripel to the Abt 12. More drinkable and lighter being the primary factors."
"D- For 8% abv, you can drink this socially... but why would you want to!? Very smooth, but this has so much flavor that it NEEDS to be sipped and savored."
"Split a bottle of this with a buddy. Poured this into my Delirium Tremens snifter. Hazy golden yellow with a thick, bubble bath head that wasn't stingy with its lacing. Smell is a deliciously complex dance of citrus, spice, yeast, and some corn. Taste is sweet like a fruity candy, or like fruit cocktail. Pears and white grapes are noticeable. A bit too sweet for me, but still quite tasty. Mouthfeel is very smooth - nice and light with sufficient carbonation. This is a beer that is very easy to drink. It doesn't command as much attention as the Abt 12, but is still very enjoyable."
"Taste has many good flavors, none of which overpower the others. Nice sweet malt, with soft spice and light fruitiness make up this great tasting tripel. 8% alcohol is unnoticeable, making this very drinable. Another great beer from St. Bernardus."
" ~ What can I say other than, ""I wish I had another to follow this one."" Every beer fan must try this luxurious brew. I can't say it's the type I would sit down and polish off a four pack but certainly two would do the trick."
"D- This is a nice, light, refreshing tripel. There are others that I enjoy a lot more but this is still a good one. It was great to get to try such a well-hyped example of this style. I will probably have it again-but not too soon because it is so expensive."
"Overall: Man do I love the monks. I often miss church, but when drinking these beers I am as close to god as one can be. This is one of if not the best Triples known to man. Sweet fruits mingled with yeast. Thanks to the monks at St. Bernardus for doing what they do!"
"One of my favorite St. Bernardus brews so far. I rate it up there with there Abt 12. Pours a hazy golden amber with an average size off-white head with excellent lacing (as all St. Bernardus brews seem to have). Another trademark of the monastery are the complex aroma's of there brews. This one has pine, lemon, chocolate, dough, apple, cinnamon, brown sugar, and banana. Very sweet smelling. Taste is clean with sweet start and mild bitter finish. Soft carbonation and an alcoholic finish make this beer a favorite in my book. My favorite Tripel!"
"I can drink this, but i wont make a conscious decision to buy it again. The dubbel is a much better, more balanced beer IMO"
"Poured into my large tulip with a deep golden hue, the fluffy white head dissipating quickly. Wonderful intertwining smells of Belgian yeast, and candied sugar give way to faint alcohol tones (nowhere near what you'd expect out of a 8% beer). The taste mimicked the nose fairly well, in addition to the sweet malt backbone that trails off into a slightly tart fruity finish. The mouth feel was fairly substantial, and drinking more than a 750 at a time might be a stretch. This beer pairs great with Spanish Manchego, and Port-Salut cheese. As Garrett Oliver suggests, triples go very well with pesto dishes, and this one is no different. Enjoy."
"High alcohol, and maybe the lack of sweetness have something to do with it, but it is not highly quaffable, IMO."
"D: This is so damn easy to drink! I finished this way before I completed this review. So simple yet complex at the same time. An honor to drink!"
"An awesome Tripel, though I need to slow down as this one is 1/4 gone in about 5 minutes."
"Overall this is a pretty good abbey style tripel. As much as I enjoyed it, I kept coming back to that alcohol taste. Although it wasn't overbearing, it was still present. Of course, the more of this stuff you drink the less you are going to notice something like that but as far as my own personal enjoyability, there are others that I would choose first. Either way this one deserves a solid score on my scale. It's one of those that is so close..."
"Overall world class hands down. I am sooo happy that I have access to this beer now. Thanks to Barbara at TBC."
"A very good Tripel. This didn't blow me away like the Abt 12, but will definitely seek this out again."
"This was a truly enjoyable beer that I'd love to try again and share with friends."
"Another world-class, top-notch sample from St. Bernardus... my second brew from the company, and I am still very, very impressed... amazing stuff, worthy of the highst praise... exceptional appearance with a dark, cloudy, hazy look with incredible frothy, foamy, lingering head... smell was wonderful, full of fresh-fruit, grapefruit, and pears... above-and-beyond taste without the slightest hint of alcohol or bitterness... full of yeast, fresh flowers, citrus, lemons, and thick, rich vanilla... awesome mouthfeel that was very crisp and clean with a surprisingly easy and lucid drinkability that went down crystal-clear for a brew with a hefty 8% ABV... no alcohol detected, just rich, thick, creamy flavors that stand out and beg recognition... a world-class brew... Absolutely recommended... Excellent, authentic deptiction of the style..."
"D: It might be easy to think of another when starting, but the ABV is a little higher - not a friendly, innocent lager... so it needs to be taken slow. Sit back, relax, let the experience last."
"The yeast & carbonation last in the mouth, creating an exciting finish. A great sipping brew; I find new qualities with each tasting."
"D: This one is so smooth and great tasting you could easily knock this one down in no time."
"Very attrative gold body with bubbly head that slowly thins to a film and leaves a nice lace. Smells sweet and slightly musty with an hint of flowers. Sweet, slightly fruity with candied sugar IF and a nice citrus aftertaste with just the slightest hint of bitterness. Light bodied, very dry texture. Pleasant and very drinkable. This is not a style I drink often, but I would definitely try this one again."
"I'd never had a tripel before this one, so I don't have much context for comparison. From what I've read, I think I got a beer that wasn't so fresh. The color was more brownish than anything else, with what looked like sediment floating around. The smell was decent and subtle. The taste was very odd. While it was dry enough, it lacked the pop that's particular to St. Bernardus' beers. It wasn't totally undrinkable, but I do think I got a beer that had been sitting on the shelf for awhile (courtesy of Total Wine). I might give this one another shot."
"This is a great tripel, again a little drier than I think I'd usually prefer, but definitely something I'd have again. Very smooth and well balanced. Just a treat."
"Pours a cloudy and calming orange into a snifter. Has a fluffy white one-finger head with decent retention, finally leaving a little ring of lacing all around. Creamy and somewhat bready malts float up to the nose just before the grapes and bananas reveal themselves. Smell is perfection. Tastes of oranges, subtle lemons and faint spice with some breadiness mixed in and a very slight bit of syrup left on the lips. Alcohol lurks in the background along with some esters. Both are almost unnoticeable. Is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. I am going out on a limb here and say it's refreshing, which is quite an accomplishment for a beer of this magnitude. That being said, I will treat it with respect. There's a damn good reason the monk on the label is smiling from ear to ear, and I am already looking forward to my next bottle of this fantastic brew."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a great beer to stick with for a whole evening."
"Delicious, and one of my favorite tripels, if not my favorite, ever."
"Notes: The pronounced harsh flavors I experienced in this beer can perhaps be due to a bad bottle."
"A damn fine tripel. One of the best tripels that I've had."
"Pours cloudy burnt orange to slightly amber in color with a thinly laced even head in a 0.3 liter Ayinger Celebrator glass. The head was thick and full with the tiniest of bubbles and subsided rather quickly leaving little, if any lacing. Nose is slight with hints of fruit, apple in particular. Mouthfeel is very carbonated with a light citric tingle. Taste is difficult to describe. It isnt heavy and you cannot notice the alcohol. Again, I taste the same apple and orange or lemony hints I mentioned on the nose and mouthfeel. Very refreshing tripel and quite enjoyable. I'll be drinking more of this to be sure."
"Normally when I see a beer reviewed so much with such a high score, I approach with trepidation. This one did deliver though. And I am glad to have been able to grab a bottle when I was in the Bay area."
"This was my first tripel and third St. Bernardus offering. I am quickly gaining respect for how tasty and amazingly complex Belgian beers can be. I will greatly enjoy trying to figure this one out again in the future."
"Overall: This was an excellent example of a triple. I had a gusher with this one...as I have had in the past. That is really all that I can fault this beer. As it is a really great beer."
"12 oz bottle poured hazy orange little white head that turns to some lace. Belgium yeast, fruit and malt aroma, clean mouth feel some light carbonation. The taste on this one is lightly sweet malty fruity start slightly hoppy bitter finish. Not one of my favorite tripels but good non the less"
"Quite drinkable and I do recommend it for the style for sure."
"D: I don't know how to feel about this one, I did tripels but I feel like westmalle had more to offer me, that's the one I would reach for time and again."
"It comes out a nice golden-yellow with a fairly thick head. (Be careful opening it - when I opened the bottle it foamed like an ever-loving geyser!) Aroma is strong, malty, yeasty, wheaty. Flavor is rather like a good hefeweissen - malty/wheaty with an undertone of citrus. Finish is smooth and has just a hint of hops. Another winner from them monks."
"In spite of the high ABV this is quite drinkable."
"As with all of the St. Bernardus beers I have tried to date, I am very impressed. This is a great representation of the style. I am ranking this beer up there with just about all of the St. B's and I will be going back for more. Those monks sure know what they are doing, I can say that for them."
"d: A hearty brew, yet the flavors are still subtle. Not sessionable but I'll seek it out frequently."
"This is a very drinkable and easy-to-drink Tripel. Enjoy one when you can."
"D- This is highly drinkable and even though i'm not a huge Belgian fan this tripel really does it for me. It takes a Belgian yeasty taste that turns me off to quite a few other beers and makes it so enticing its hard to put down."
"Brouwerij St. Bernardus has never let me down. I've enjoyed each and every one of their creations and am especially thrilled with Tripel. It's on my short list of the world's best beers, no matter the style. I plan to stock up whenever the opportunity presents itself. Only next time I'm going for the 750s."
"Mouthfeel has a nice doughy body but does not seem over filling. Nice carbonation tickle. A very good Tripel"
"drinkability is good. balanced, nice depth, right on for the style. this is a fine tripel and i look forward to finding more of it."
"Overall, i found this one supper enjoyable. It maybe isn't as over the top as many of the ""extreme"" beers but it's full of flavor and makes for a great drinking beer. I could enjoy this one over and over again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is amazing no doubt both are helped by the careful use of the candy sugar. This was finished too fast. I highly recommend this tripel. Only the nose was disappointing, but everything else was great. Another solid offering from St. Bernardus."
"A much more impressive beer this time around. It was a touch on the thick side, for the style, but there was a great range of phenols. I mean this beer was spicy, damn. There were also mellow banana and subtle clove, matched with a sizeable hops bite of herbal lemon and citrus rind. Yum. Very tasty, but I might have trouble drinking a few of these."
"Perhaps not spectacular, but a very nice beer nonetheless."
"A true treat."
"Personal score- 94/100"
"Top notch like the other St Bernardus brews! Try it!"
"I have only previously tried the Abt 12, and I didn't see what the fuss was. However, this is a different beast. I love a good tripel, but this one pushes the envelope with a distinct aroma, perfect sweetness, and a refined smoothness. I love it!"
"Drinkability : Bonne bière d'abbaye de style triple"
"Poured from bottle into a glass. Lots of nice, off white head, that lasted a little but, not too long. A- a fruity, citrus? notes. T- a malty, fruity taste with some balenced hops, and sort of creamy. The beer is very belenced, and goes down easy. A great beer, I enjoyed after spending the day moving! A great beer!"
"The mouthfeel is reminiscent, to me, of much darker, heartier beers, like a good porter. It does not taste at all like a porter, mind you, but it fills the mouth with a creamy fullness that reminded me of porter. The taste evolves in the mouth, moving forward to the tip of the tongue. I opened my large bottle right out of the refrigerator (a sin, I know) and was greeted by a taste somewhat sharper than the fuller flavor of the warmer second half. Do yourself a favor - allow this beer to develop its full potential at a cool, not cold, temperature. I definitely prefer this to Bernardus' ""8" but maybe it's a style thing. This is a beer that will definitely be part of my regular stash from now on..."
"This was a hearty beer, good flavor almost a coffee taste to it, I was pleasently supprised by the overall taste. The initial taste left me wonering if I would even like it, but by the end of the bottle I was very surprised. Great beer overall, I have 2 other bottles for the most part and am looking forward to drinking them."
"Cheers!"
"This is a beer I could drink and drink forever. So interesting yet it's easy to quaff."
"D: A great tripel. Worthy of listing on Best of BA. Not overly sweet, well balanced and complex  many different flavor pints. Drinkability is good but it will jump up on you."
"O: A joy to drink!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. It doesnt appear to be as ""spicy"" as other belgians i've tried. Very nice. I think the more I try, the more i want to try. I'm becoming more of a fan of belgians with every one I try."
"750 ml corked bottle poured into my St Bernardus chalice (same one thats on their website so i suppose this is the right glass). I think this is my ~800th time to drink this beer but first review. St Bernardus might be my favorite brewery, so pardon my homerism if I get carried away. Pours a cloudy yellow with some light orange/gold tints. A massive pure white beautiful head that has some serious retention. Smell is pears, yellow grapes, sugar, candy sugar, citrus. Taste is very smooth, sugar, very bready, biscuit, light citrus and fruit. Mouthfeel is thin, but perfect and creamy. I dont know how they subdue the intrusive phenols (contrary to something like Maredsous which is also a wonderful beer) so well and make such a clean high ABV beers and this is no exception. A masterfully crafted beer. I might not be typical but I can session these. This is one damn fine beer and perhaps the finest commercial example of the style. YUM! The perfect way to wind down a long day before Monday night football."
"D: This beer is extremely drinkable. Easy to pair with any meal."
"M) High Carbonation. Medium Mouthfeel. Quite drinkable."
"Got a 25 oz. bottle of this for $12; busting it out for the special occasion of leaving the country for two years. Pours a light yellow-orange color, crystal clear, with two fingers of frothy white head on top. Leaves great lacing as it drains. Surprisingly clear, although the later pours were a little foggier. Nose is tons of spice, bread, cotton candy, light lemon as well. Mostly sweet, spicy malt. Great nose. Flavor is great as well, and improves drastically as the beer warms. Refreshing citrus. Not even a hint of alcohol. Tons of lemon, with some breadiness. Candy sweetness. Carbonation is good and bubbly, spicy and refreshing - it might actually hide a touch of the flavor, although it eases as it warms. Really liked this one, although I must recommend letting it warm up A LOT. A very tasty tripel."
"D: Good enough. I wasn't dying for another sip, but it's very satisfying. I will surely get it again in the spring."
"D- Delicious and went down fairly quickly for an 8% beverage. Very enjoyable."
"I wasnt surprised that this was a very good brew- poured bubbly and effervescent huge spicy aromas with some sour yeasty undertones. There is a very earthy flavor, slightly sweet but also a hint of grassy hops. Very smooth and not as heavy as I would expect from a tripel but this one is obviously well crafted. There is a craminess to it, some slightly carmelized malt that amps up the flavors. The belgian spiciness is subdued but definately thre. The finish is dry but doesnt leave a sour note as some do. Very well done- cant wait to get into the rest of the series from Bernardus."
"Drinkabiltiy: This is a doosie beer. 8% is too much to drink a few of, but the alcohol flavours are so subdued that they could go down quite easily."
"Comment: This beer largely lived up to the hype. Imacoug is typically a restrained beer lover and he went head over heals for this gem. I concur, for the most part. I could use a bit more head and a tad more aroma to complement the fantastic taste and mouthfeel."
"Overall, a wonderful brew that I have been meaning to review for some time. This is probably my favorite Tripel. Has all the characteristics, sweet candy sugars, lots of malty goodness and a bouquet of fruit, perfectly balanced. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a pale yellow color with a nice yeasty white head. Aromas of a yeasty hop presence and a small bit of alcohol. In the taste, a small fruitiness is present, a dry yeasty taste is also there. A mouthfeel of a full yeastiness and a very clean aftertaste. I love the small bit of fruit presence and a yeasty charicteristic. I think that it is also great because of a smaller ABV than most."
"Turbid dark golden hue. Covered by a fluffy, dense and well retained porcelain white head. Musty honey sweetness, powdery chalk along with pronounced banana esters and lightly tart green apple acetaldehyde in aroma. Clean, nectar like sugar hits the palate at first, then widens into a bready, dough like mellow sweetness. Fruitiness is comprised of mild banana esters and tropical hints of jackfruit. Subdued notes of black pepper alcohol, clove phenol and bubblegum esters add underlying herbal spice. Moderate in body and quite dextrinous, with carbonation lower than the norm helping lend a smooth mouthfeel. Residual sweetness is left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. Finishes expectedly sweet, but slightly minerally, with a hint of must as well. A delicious tripel, with overall balanced skewed towards sweetness. St. Bernardus is soft on the palate and quite a mellow example of the style."
"drinkability is decent. the alcohol will shy some drinkers away, and the fruity character will not be to everyone's taste, but this is a great example of the style. well balanced with good concentration. this is a good brew to savor and enjoy over a decent amount of time; let it warm and it will show itself. cheers!"
"Only had 11.2 oz, but more would be graciously welcomed. I find that go back for more reflexes are rarely used for Belgian-styled beers, but I prefer this one to even Rochefort, surprisingly."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger plus creamy white head, lots and lots of sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of cloves/bannanas, slight grapefruit, grassy. The taste is malty, and yeasty for the most part, nice touch of cloves/banannas/grapefruit. This is a tasty tripel, the finish is very smooth. Medium body. Drinkable, another tasty brew from St. Bernardus."
"This is, based on my limited knowledge, a quintessential Belgian beer. This isn't to say that it's extraordinary, but it is well-rounded in all facets and pleasing to drink. I poured it into a pint glass...medium caramel color with a half-inch head (at most) that dissapated quickly. The taste is smooth, malty and a little fruity, but not at all heavily carbonated, which I appreciate."
"Drinakability: Very good beer, that I could drink a couple of, but I wouldn't really want to go past that. I'll be picking another 4-pack of these again in the future."
"I tried this beer on August 10, 2007 at The Esplanade Biermarket in Toronto. The beer was a cloudy brown in colour with a short lasting off-white head. The aroma was very yeasty with some spicy tinges in the background. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation while the flavour was full of yeast and wet bread. Another damn fine product from St. Bernardus!"
"D--If you are a fan of Tripels or St. Bernardus (who isnt?) this is a must try. Great flavor and drinkability. Not quite as good as the Tremens but pretty close."
"Drinkability is good. This is an excellent tripel, that is very easy to sip."
"hazy golden with a huge white head. smells of yeasty semi sweet bread, a little banana, malt, hops, and maybe some lemongrass or something. tastes the same... a little sour and a hint of bitter, but well blended. to me it tastes like a tripel should. not over the top or outrageously unique. just a solid solid beer. feel great going down. not overly carbonated. alive. just right. easy easy drink."
"very enjoyable and smooth for the 8%. ABV."
"D) This is a darn nice triple. Less bubbly and sticky sweet than Duvel, but a bit less spicy. A very fine beer."
"good drinkability, i find myself constantly picking it up a sip. not a bit of that 8% abv is detectable. very nice."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer and one of the best tripels I've tried so far."
"Anyway, as close to a perfect tripel as I've ever had."
"Drinkability: Maybe my only complaint of which some of it can be my own fault. Alot of the yeast poured out into the glass and caused a hazy mess on top of a large amount of floaters. This detracted from the overall appearance and in that the drinkability (I wouldn't feel comfortable drinking that much floating yeast. The yeast never settled either. Overall though its high alcohol and high in flavor and aromas. Worth a try."
"Great looking brew in my Chimay goblet. This beer is a perfect gold with a grand head that leaves rings around the glass. Smell is predominately citrus, oranges, but a little sweeter, like tangerines with a nice malt backbone. Taste is a tad spicy, a little acidity that's OK, mostly citrus fruits and a little hint of honeydew. Very drinkable and hardly a notice of the alcohol. A high-class brew to cap the evening."
"Overall, a good trappist tripel - I think I still prefer the Westmalle but that's just personal taste."
"Me likey. If I had another, I would drink it tonight. Alas, I don't. I'll settle for the Trois Pistoles next."
"Taste is outstanding. Smooth and sweet flavors that end spicy and dry. Unbelievably smooth. Creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation that's somewhat prickly. Highly drinkable... barely noticeable alcohol. Not much more to say, really. This beer deserves it's high rating, no doubt."
"Alcohol is hidden well."

"Poured from a bomber, into a snifter. The beer pours a clear gold, forming a full 1 inch white head. Light spots of lace stick to the glass. The smell is a thick mixture of dark fruit aromas, along with a slight alcohol presence. The taste is very much like the aroma. Nice dark fruit flavor, mild hops, and a noticeable but not overpowering alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. The low abv. and full flavor of this tripel makes for high drinkability. Overall, I can see why this Belgian has such high ratings. This is a fantastic Tripel!!!"
"D: Good drinkability, goes down smooth with nice balance and excellent flavors. A very good tripel."
"12oz brown bottle from A-1 To-Go in Gardiner. Somewhat murky red-orange body with a good inch and a half oh head that sticks around for a while and leaves a fair bit of lacing as it dissipates. Smells fruity, like apples and raisins, with nut and spice notes. Tastes fruity (citrus, apple) with bits of nut and spice. No real alcohol noticed. Lighter bodied than expected, making this a real drinkable beer for the style. Wow, this beer is great."
"A superb tripel. Amazingly balanced with no flavours becoming too overpowering"
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with an abundant head that is lasting and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is a very strong blend of sweet fruits, spice, yeast and some earthy hops. The taste is a great balance of sweet malts, spice and earthy hops with an appropriate yeast bite. The beer is medium bodied and crisp with warming alcohol. This is an immensely enjoyable Tripel."
"Good beer. The other beers produced by St. Bernardus (specifically Abt 12 and Prior 8) are far better."
"Overall: This beer is good. It might be one of the best Tripel's I have had."
"D- This is a excellent beer. I will be buying a few of these on my next trip to Cali."
"Really great beer. I love this stuff!"
"This is a refreshing and fruity ale, sweet toffee malt combined with some fruity hop punch. Alcohol well hidden. Finely crafted and highly recommended from the bottle or on tap."
"hard to do a whole lot better"
"I've been waiting a bit, and swirling a bit, but while the initial carbonation is getting better (lighter) the finish is still a bit too fizzy for my taste. This is a shame because I think I would otherwise really enjoy the creamy full fruit flavors and sharp warming alcohol gliding across my tongue. Drinkability is a bit lower than my favorites of the style. Not bad by a longshot, and very glad I tried it."
"Not a bad beer, but IMHO not the best tripel out there. Actually a bit disappointing from their fantastic ABT 12, but still solid in its own right and worth a try."
"Wheaty flavors take over the mouth and curl under the tongue. Fruity notes dance on the roof of the mouth exuding clove, banana, orange peel, lemon zest, and melon. Dryer aftertaste with a starchy mouthfeel. Silky soft on the palate. Bold and thick on the palate even though it fools you with it's softness and lightness. A very nice drinking tripel. One that I will revisit at some point."
"Pours just shy of clear, with a big, foamy white head that kicks up on the pour and remains as a dusting throughout the session. Loads of Brussels lace. Very hoppy aroma -- some pear, white pepper, and light candi sugar. On the tongue, very sharp bitterness (more than most tripels) backed by white-fruit sweetness, full carbonation and an intense herbal quality at the finish. There's a nice creaminess to the taste and mouthfeel. Overall, this is an excellent tripel. Not my favorite one -- to my mind, it swings over too far in bitterness -- but it's up there."
"I'm not saying it's a bad beer. In fact I consider it a must try. But....I'd have other Triples before this one."
"This triple pours a slightly cloudy golden color. The head was minimal. The smell was a mixture of yeast and malts, with hints of fruit and alcohol. The taste was slightly sweet but not much else. The mouthfeel was refreshingly crisp. A descent triple to give a try. But not one I would recommend going out of your way to search out."
"Recemmended."
"D: Yes. At 7.5% this is an all nighter."
"Drinkability: This is an easygoing tripel. Scarcely a sign of the ABV and it leaves a pleasant aftertaste on the palate, crying ""have one more of me - surely you ponied up the dough to grab more than one!"""
"With the Housemartins "" Five Get Over Excited "" on the Hi-Fi . I am about to crack into this capped , caged , and corked bottle with the Col. Meril Stubing from the Love Boat on the front . He - the monk on front , reminds me of Brother Rich who was my English teacher at the Franciscan Friar school which will remain nameless . Poured into my Rapscallion snifter the head is large and the golden color is murky . Glowing gold when held to the light . 2 finger head has reduced to a thin head with some lacing . Smells of honey and banana . The mouthfell is pleasant and the carbonation is smooth . This is the 2nd brew from St. Bernardus that I have tried , and just like the ABT 12 worth the time and money ."
"This went down exceptional well with my roast duck. An excellent tripel."
"Poured out of a corked and caged 750ml bottle. The color is a cloudy pale orange with a decent white head that left some spot lacing. The smell is fantastic. Bready dough, candi sugar, peaches, tropical fruit. The taste is sweet but not over powering, a nice malty backbone, with tropical fruit tones, a good balance. This is a great triple, one of the best. Very flavorful."
"A decent triple. A bit on the spicer side be it from hops or actual spices, Im not sure. Plenty of funky Belgian yeast aromas and flavors too."
"Cheers!"
"The"
"Drinkability is exceptional as well. ABV is well hidden, and at 8% not as devastating as the quadrupel."
"Drinkability: Delicious, satisfying, complex, I could have several of these. Makes everything right, with or without food. Needless to say, good at any time of the day."
"Always have been a fan of St. Bernardus products and this beer lives up to the style. The beer had a nice smell and beautiful cloudy golden color. Unfortunately, I guess I'm not a huge fan of of the triples because I'm always gravitating toward other Belgian styles. Will try this one again, but with a nice pork loin next time."
"11.2 brown bottle poured into a goblet; unsettling yellow in color, with off and on orange peel showings. A sparkling and white bubbly soapy head. The nose is fruity, with sugar plum, banana bread and cloves. Non-moving yeasty particles make their presence known. Incredible tastings--chewy peppery spices, plums, yeast and fruity malts. The body contains some bread/biscuit flavorings. Bubble gum, bananas and more peppery notes are noted. Finishes dry and very satisfying; the definitive definition of what a triple should be! A gem!"
"This beer looks like a golden snowglobe. Lots of suspended yeast. The Color is a light golden with a fair head. The smell is similar to a light beer with a alcohol bite. The taste is of alcohol with a corn-like presence. I prefer the St. Bernardus 8 to this by a wide margin. I may come back to this one at some point but the 8 has my money as of now."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in body (not too heavy). Smooth rounded texture. Very nice."
"Sweetish Belgium yeast, banana and close arouse the nose, the quaff has these and a overall sweet malt texture. Very smooth brew, the alcohol is hidden in the bushes. Man, would I luv to get these over here for what they sell for over in Brussels. Of course, this a Tripel standard for our U.S. breweries. The ratings here are well deserved"
"Mouth feel was exceptional and the flavor almost perfect. Nice smooth, creamy and full mouthfeel was great and the malty flavors were almost heavanly. I notice no hops per say, but that was expected. The maltiness was of plums/raisons and a bit ""bready"""
"poured into a snifter, the beer grabs light from the room and holds onto it, creating an impressive glowing effect. sediment sits suspended in the beer and the white foamy head is unmoving, as if not a liquid. yeast, honey, flowers dominate the smell and taste, with some peppery spices and a touch of honey. the beer feels like tea and honey in the mouth, and drizzles down the throat accordingly; absent is the cloying stickiness of many tripels. the alcohol is not masked, but accompanys the flavors perfectly. a very dry finish leaves you wanting more and more and more."
"In the end i'm not terribly impressed, but will give it another shot. A fresher bottle may yield different results."
"St. Bernardus Tripel pours the color of a new copper penny with an off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. There is a pleasant fruity aroma, apricot comes to mind as does pineapple. The fruit isn't as noticeable in the flavor, although aspects still come through. There seems to be more of an herbal flavor that dominates however. Definitely one to try."
"Definitely one of the best Belgian tripels I've ever had."
"Drinkability is excellent. This beer simply flies out of the glass even with the moderate alcohol content. I would drink this all the time were it not for the limted availability and cost."
"Pours a dull cloudy gold with a big white head. Sheets of lacing on the glass. Nice smell, cloves and bananas and some spiciness. Tastes very good, nice astringency and the flavor of fruit and spices. No hint of the alcohol at all!!! The mouthfeel is rich. Drinkability is good for a beer with this high an alcohol content. This one is a winner!!!"
"Another amoung the large group of beers my girlfriend bought me for Christmas, St. Bernardus Triple pours a light golden yellow. It is hazy, with a tall white head that fades quickly. Smell is yeasty and faintly malty. Flavor is moderately dry, with nice fruity esters. There is some hop bitterness, in contrast to the Abt 12. I've only recently started to really enjoy Belgians, but I think that now I will be drinking beers like St. Bernardus much more often."
"Poured a deep cloudy amber into goblet. Smells of hay and the earthy smells I associate with all Belgian ales now. Bit of banana and spice in the background. Taste of spice upfront and malt with a bit of bitterness at the end. A very nice brew and a change from my prefered Belgian brown or quads. My favorite triple thus far."
"Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a gold/copper color with almost an inch off-white head. It smells like pears, bubblegum/candy sweetness and a bit of peppery spicyness. The taste is pretty similar to how it smells, but I can also taste some yeast and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium/full, a bit dry and very smooth. Drinkability is high too, it goes down pretty easy. One of the best if not the best Tripel style beers I've had."
"I won't run out to purchase another, but I don't feel bambozzled, either."
"Very drinkable. The yeast adds interest and the crispness and medium carbonation make it refreshing."
"A hard pour into a Tulip leaves about an inch of creamy head with a rather remarkable staying power. Nice lacing too. Color is a hazy gold. Very appealing. Aromas have some alcohol notes and a sweet but inoffensive spicyness. The spiced pear taste is fainter than I would have thought with a nice touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. Nothing overpowering here. Alcohol remains hidden save for the smell. Though this first appeared to be nicely carbonated, it gave way to a more creamy feel as the beer warmed - very smooth. Nice. Very nice."
"A very good Tripel in my opinion. It's certainly warming me up this evening."
"This poured a very nice light, golden amber with a very thick head that reduces in size but maintains its thickness with a substantial, soft lacing. Outstanding. The smell that follows is very pleasant and consists of very faint alcohol mixed with citrusy fruits. The taste is also fruity but with more complexity creating a nice, but balanced sweetness. The mouthfeel is extremlely light and fluffy in the mouth yet complete with substance. Quite drinkable. Not disappointed by this one that brings high expectations."
"Pours an effervescent clear golden color with a 2 finger pillowy white head. Leaves some sticky lacing. Nose is generally sweet with banannas, yeast, and citrusy fruits. Taste is great, very complex. First are light fruit malts (citrus and apple) followed by a bit of hop bitterness. There is some dry yeast in the finish. Great mouthfeel, very creamy, medium body, and a decent amount of carbonation. Good drinkability, a very enjoyable brew with great complex flavors that masks its alcohol well."
"Excellent, if not outstanding. I won't turn this down anytime soon. I haven't been drinking many Belgians recently....maybe I should pick up a few more!"
"My first Tripel style beer, I spit it on my counter. The flavors of fruit combined with a bitter aftertaste left one bottle down the drain, and three still sitting in their case. Anyone near me is welcome to the other three. While I am confident in the quality of this product, this style is definitely not for me."
"I'm enjoying this from a 12 oz. bottle now, only because there didn't seem to be any more 750 mL left in the store. So yeah I consider it very well drinkable."
"Folks, it doesn't get much better than this. Track down a bottle as soon as possible."
"Pours into the Orval chalice revealing a hazy, carrot gold body with a darker center. Slightly rocky, off-white head crawls up the sides of the glass. Nose is fruity: tropical punch, banana, pineapple. Syrupy sweet fruits are matched with peppery alcohol and yeasty bitterness. Powdered sugar malt up front along with developing fruit cocktail sweetness. Notes of honey wheat and caramel near the mainly peppery, yeasty, and slightly toasted bitter finish. Full-bodied, with a tongue-tickling, bottle-conditioned feel. Very well done! One of the best Tripels I've ever had."
"D: Tie one on, but be wary of the 8%. This one is deceptively subtle and tasty as all hell, so monitor that and you'll have no problem savoring this well-flavored brew."
"D- tripels have always been very drinkable for me, they go down easy, taste great, and have a knack for concealing any alcohol taste in them whatsoever, a nice one, not my favorite tripel, but still a very nice"
"Overall a wonderful ale. So moist, so full. This is a sweet Belgian wet kiss."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The smooth, foaming mouthfeel is perfection for the style... it swells and quiets to the point of not being able to discern bubbles at all. A gentle caress is welcome on the tongue while all of the complexities exhibit themselves in superb form... resulting in a slow, relaxing, memorable tasting that should have been shared with someone."
"No alcohol notes. What a great beer."
"The aroma is sweetly malty, with yeast, vanilla and spicy coriander chiming in. The taste is an amazingly balanced combination of sugar and spice: a slightly carmelized brown sugar flavour, biscuity malt, clove spiciness and faint bitterness from hops. A smooth-drinking, full bodied beer that is dangerously drinkable for such a strong brew. Easily one of my favourites."
"This beer poured a light brown cloudy color with a large, persistent head. The lacing is thick and lasting. The smell is heavy and has an intense malt flavor. The taste is intensely malty and sweet.well balanced. The mouthfeel is heavy and slightly chewy. This beer is awesome  drinkability is, well..drink this!"
"Bottom line: IMHO, this is certainly a world class Tripel. I think it is a *must try* for anyone who claims to be a lover of Belgian Ales!"
"This beer is way to easy to drink!!! I had trouble giving mine time to warm because it kept dissapearing so rapidly. This is one fantastic beer!"
"Pours a murky golden color with light sediment floating around. Poured a thick white cap that hung around leaving lacings as it fell. Aroma is citrus, yeast, wheat, light caramel, honey, banana, apple, pear, and alcohol. Flavor is syrupy honey sweet, with citrus, banana, yeast, and wheat. Mouthfeel is medium body, medium carbonation, and dry alcohol finish. Excellent beer."
"Pours from the bottle to a hazy golden orange with thick white head that stays for the whole beer, and reduces to excellent lacing. I noticed the strong hoopy dark fruit aroma as soon as I opened the bottle. Flavor was more of the same, yet with a nice blend of citrus fruit, similar to an IPA. Beer finished off to a perfect palate, where the hoppy bitterness mixed well with the 8% alcohol and a hint of malty sweetness. A most excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Drinkable yes, one bottle is probably plenty, another bottle is not needed. I think I would like to try this again sometime."
"This is a pretty good drinkin' beer. I could consume a few of these at a time."
"Tastes yummy. Sour and a little bitter. A citrusy, malty, sweet aftertaste. The alcohol taste is complemented/masked well. Mouthfeel is excellent, full and bubbly. A very nice beer, although I don't quite see what all the fuss is about."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night, if I could afford it."
"Mouth is densely carbonated yet somehow delicate and thick. Drinkability is sky high ... sure it has a high ABV, but I measure drinkability by my likelihood of purchasing again, not by how many I want to down in one sitting. This is beer, not a buffet for the gluttonous."
"Drinkability - not really a session kind of thing but a fine treat nonetheless and a great pick when sharing a top notch beer. An outstanding beer for an outstanding lady. This beer is toasted and enjoyed today in honor of my Aunt Nadine, who has gone to her reward. I'll miss you terribly, but will see you on the other side someday. xo"
"Drinkability was outstanding. The beer was so smooth, rich and, at 8% ABV, so dangerously drinkable."
"Sweet pils malt flavor with loads of yeast and some alcohol. It's a bit thinner than I expected and not really as complex but still pretty solid. Pretty easy to drink."
"This beer pours a hazy golden with a frothy white head that leaves some film and laces nicely. The smell is sweet wheat and yeast with a little bit of a saison like farmhouse smell. The taste is very sweet with wheat flavors and light fruits like bananna and lemon. This is also complimented with a good amount of belgian yeast flavor. The mouthfeel has a medium body and a little bit on the low side of the spectrum for this beer. Overall, a nicely drinkable beer, certainly a very high quality tripel."
"Excellent sipping beer after a hard day's work."
"Cloudy, cornbread-colored brew topped with a pretty, white head. Head disappears and leaves a tasty looking beer. Sweet, nanner-full (bananas) smell. Yeasty and fruity. A little bit spicy in the nose and the mouth. Crisp. Very tasty and easy-going. Easy to drink."
"Drinkabilty: An exellent tripel , very tasty and easy drinking. Very well balanced."
"This beer poured a slightly cloudy golden color with a huge head that hung around for awhile. Aroma was fruity and sweet with some floral hop aromas mixed in. Taste was quite spicy and peppery with a nice bready malt character. I could also pick up some notes of citrus(orange), pear and Belgian candy sugar. Very tasty for a light to medium bodied beer and dangerously quaffable. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is dominated by that awesome Belgian ""overcarbonation"" wonderfulness that leaves the tongue tingling. Very drinkable, if only it weren't for the price tag. Such is life."
"It has a thin mouthfeel, but it doesn't detract from it's taste or finish at all. I could probably drink this all night ... though I'd be afraid what I'd look like at the finish line. The subtle 8% ABV can sneak up on you with this puppy."
"Another fantastic beer from the Brouwerij St. Bernardus. I have yet to be disappointed by them... everything they make is great."
"Got the big bottle. It popped open like vintage champagne. Hazy and with a yellow yellow color it poured with lots of creamy foam and sparkling bubbles. The lacing was great too. The smell was primarily of yeast with some fuitiness and bitternerness. The taste was also dominated by yeast and sourness with a sweet ending. It actually felt hard on my tongue. There was a breath of alcohol. Thought I caught some ginger there too. God, this is what beer drinking is all about. Beer Art. Why isn't everyone drinking it?"
"D: This is a damn fine tripel. While the Westmalle and Chimay (Cinq Cents) are still my preferred tripels, that's not the fault of this beer. It's in a weird middle ground between the drier Tripels and the sweeter Tripels. It hides its alcohol extremely well. I've been buying 12 oz bottles of this, but I'm sold: if it's sold in bombers next time I hit the beer store, I'm buying those. Another wonderful beer from St. Bernardus."
"Pours a nice golden blond with lovely high lights. Bubbles are continually flowing to the top sustaining the head, which shows no sign of dissipating and already is leaving lacing. It is nice fluffy thick, and lovely. Immediately after opening it I noticed the smell of worm bread with mild citrus, later candy and banana wonderful subtle complexity. The taste is great, medium body, soft, a bit sweet with a hint of hoppy bitterness. Belgian rock candy and fruit are present, a little gooey, sticky, great stuff. This is definitely one of my new favorite tripels and its getting to be a hard battle. Any how I will definitely buy this again too bad its not cheaper, because I'd love to have this around always."
"Overall, a great Belgium Tripel and recommended. Another great offering from St. Bernardus."
"This beer just seems to hit the mouth in the right places. A perfect balance of malts, spices, and carbonation, which very seldom happens with tripels. It manages to develop a body before bubbling down, which has proven to be the biggest problems with other tripels (especially American ones). There are lots of citric notes in the nose, with a bit of spices. A terrific beer, and excellent example of the Tripel style."
"It's got some heft, but it's downright cozy and a pleasure. You don't drink this so much as wrap it around your palate. The ABV is bigger than it presents, and its a warming entity, but it would be wise to be wary. I'll be sorry when this bottle is gone, so it behooves me to have another on hand. I think a second would be worth what the next morning might bring."
"This beer, in an appropriate goblet at Zeno's in State College, forms a slight off-white head over a near-translucent yellow-gold body. The nose is filled with candi-caramel, a bit of spiciness, a little acid. Smells rich and nice. The taste has an earthy hop profile, not as sweet as the nose, very rich and peppery, not as smooth as it could be. The alcohol comes through too much. The mouthfeel is medium, with high carbonation. This tripel is complex, and very strong - too much so for me."
"World Class, all the way around. Pours out to a cloudy yellow color with a smaller head of white foam, but lots of carbonation. No lace. Wonderful aroma of Belgian yeast and sweet malts, blended with biscuits and rich grains. Notes of peach and sweet fruity syrups. Taste is outstanding; complex characters, strong flavors, this beer truely is the cornerstone of the St. Bernardus line. Lots of rich yeasty maltiness right upfront, with a blast of natural sucrose and bread. A wine-like fruity note toward the finish. Mouthfeel is bubbly and mellow at the same time, yet maintains a thirst quenching quality. Nice. Drinkability is very good. Highly Recommened."
"This was a very enjoyable tripel that was very complex and had some very unique character. It poured a copper hue with a nice one inch thick foamy head. It smelled of hay, ripe fruit, apples, light spice, malty sweetness, and a little bit of alcohol towards the bottom. It tasted great it was very complex and had sweet malty flavor with hints of apples, ripe fruit and a nice level of carbonation. Overall give this beer a definate try its great."
"Caged and corked 750ml bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a pale orangish yellow color with thin layer of white lace. Fruit dominate the dry crisp nose. Lively carbonation contributes to a dry crisp mouthfeel. Taste is much like the aroma in that it has an array of fruity notes that finishes dry. Overall, this is another good brew from St. Bernardus. I will be honest, I was expecting a little more from this excellent brewery. Definately not a bad brew, I just think it could be better."
"This beer reminded me of how Schumann described the music of Chopin: ""Guns buried in flowers."" This is a light colored, fluffy, flowery beer that secretly has powerful aroma, flavor, and alcohol."
"Poured from an 11.2 bottle. A dark honey color and fluffy head that dissipated rather rapidly. It gave off a sublte, yeasty aroma of clove and spices. The same characteristics do well in describing the taste, along with some maltiness and a faint trace of citrus--and an uncharacteristic absence of alcohol. A light but satisfying mouthfeel, resulting in extreme drinkability. A very solid Tripel overall."
"Murky golden color, slight candy nose, light hops with earthy taste but a clean creamy body, after taste bitter and sweet in the back PalateMurky golden color, slight candy nose, light hops with earthy taste but a clean creamy body, after taste bitter and sweet in the back Palate"
"750ml corked bottle with adrink brfore date of 1/24/09 stamped on the bottom. Pours a slightly hazy medium gold with a hude fluffy white head and very nice lace. Smells tart with a fair amount of wheat malt smells. Fruit aromas are also present with some apple and pear. Initial malt are fairly intense but are quickly followed by a decent hop bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. initial flavors also include the juices mentioned above as well as some yeasty undertones. Alcohol is hidden nicely. A fine beer that I think needs some aging still. It seems like tha flavors just don't blend like they should, so I think I will purchase another and open it in about 2 years. It shold be very nice then."
"Overall: Is this a good beer? Yes. Is it great? No. Try it yourself and see."
"Of course, the same thing has happened to me before with the Abt., which, at its best, is one of my all-time favorite beers, so the Tripel definitely deserves another shot, probably after a little bit of hibernation."
"Palate is bubbly... creamy... a slight alcohol burn. Very nice."
"Finish is long and rather tart, perhaps a touch bitter as well."
"Drinkability - For what this beer is, the drinkability is superb. It is smooth, not overpowering in the least, very flavorful, complex. The mouthfeel is sublime. Excellent."
"I thought this ale would be great with broiled duck or just by itself in the company of friends."
"This is by far my favorite Belgian Triple. Superior in almost every way. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life- this one would be solid possibility. Incredible stuff."
"Overall: This is a delicious Tripel. The sweet fruitiness is moderated well by the alcoholic spice and light bitterness."
"750ml silkscreened bottle with a best before end of 6/14/10 on the crown. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a massive off-white head that retains impressively and incredibly active carbonation. The aroma has some tropical fruit notes upfront, along with spices, biscuit, candy sugar, and the traditional St. Bernardus yeast character. The flavor is initially yeasty (typical st bernie yeast), with some tropical and citrus fruit notes, some candy sugar, biscuit, light spices (corriander, anise) and some herbal hops. The mouthfeel is on the light side with moderate carbonation, drinkability is very good with little or no alcohol noticeable. A very good tripel, not overly medicinal or spicy like many beers of it's style."
"I could drink it all day, if I didn't have to get in a car that is."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a tight bubbly carbonation. Goes down nicely and is quite a tasty tripel overall. This is one I'd definetly pick up again sometime and another feather in the cap for St. Bernardus. Worth checking out if you're a fan of the brewery or the style."
"I thing St Benardus is my favorite Belgian brewery. I've loved all of their beers. Had this in a wine glass (that's all the beach house had). Just a little bit of a head. Yellow, straw color with a strong floral and yeast aroma. Not overpowering. Much different than Allagash Tripel Reserve, which is great in it's own way. Taste has some banana. Can taste/feel teh alcohol, but it doesn't detract fromt he beer. I great example of a classic Tripel."
"Drinkability is easy. No problems here. This is good, but really nothing super impressive."
"They do nothing wrong. I am slavishly devoted to drinking St. Bernardus beer."
"Medium body, high carbonation. Pretty refreshing and easy-going on the palate. Not too offensive and very complex. Solid 4's goes out to this one."
"This beer is Really good looking. A huge amount of carbonation leaves a giant head with great lacing and millions of bubbles in a clear golden color liquid. The smell is a disappointment with only a slight aroma of candy sugar. The taste isn't as sweet as other tripels,but there is a definite candy sugar taste along with flora, coriander, and malt. This is very good and subdued for the amount of alcohol in it. The m/f is light and very well mixed. A classic beer that should not be missed."
"This is a pretty straight-up Tripel, everything it does it does well. I was expecting a little more complexity, I suppose, but for what is there I couldn't find much to complain about. Allagash still makes my favorite Tripel, but you certainly can't go wrong with St. Bernardus."
"Hazy yellow, modest head. Belgian yeast, spices, coriander, pale malts, slightly fruity..plenty of carbonation, and rather lively on the tastebuds. This is certainly an easy drinker, and I had a couple around the campfire the other night. You almost have to force yourself not to drink this one too fast to enjoy the subtleties of it. Has no perceivable alcohol bite despite the impressive 8% abv. This is just a classic Belgian tripel from a stellar brewery."
"Overall. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel stands out the most, imho, but i dont believe this beer has any shortcomings. great one for after dinner."
"Slightly hazy pale gold color, big white head that keeps growing if the pour is too aggressive. Nice lace lines. There is a slight smell of alcohol, lots of fruit and yeasty aromas. Some malt character, but lots of fruit/herbal tastes, all covered up by yeast flavors. A touch of spiciness. Lots of alcohol warming in the throat and stomach, you can definately feel the 8% alc. and a dry finish. A good beer, generally highly ranked and well respected example of a belgian tripel. I see why the monk is smiling."
"Drinkability - This was not bad, but it was not terribly great either. I would probably not seek this out again. Anyway, high abv also restricts it to one per session for those who like it, although again high abv is well hidden, so be careful."
"I'll definitely come back to this brew at some point, but most likely in a 12oz bottle. You don't have to pay too much attention to what's going on. Definitely a good starter brew for the genre, if you want to introduce a friend to a rather neutral tripel/belgian without all sorts of fancy spices to describe."
"Mouthfeel is rich, carbonated and smooth. Nice alcohol warmth."
"This is the kind of beer that would make one find religion and join the abbey."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty well carbonated, but not overwhelmingly so. Very rich, but still very smooth and drinkable. Goes down easy, maybe a bit too easy..."
"This is my favourite tripel so far, and probably my favourite St. Bernardus brew as well. Good stuff!"
"Overall, it's pretty good. It's almost a little more saison-ey than triple-y."
"D - Not too impressed. Beer is OK, but something is missing. I ate some stilton/mature cheddar and crackers with the second half of it, which worked well and gave the beer a lift."
"Bright golden color, clear except for the few chunks of yeast that made it into the bottle. Thick, fluffy, white head. Yeasty, bready aroma with light honey and fruit notes. The yeast flavor wasn't as sharp as I expected, but still very flavorful. The yeast plays well with the doughy flavor, and it has a nice lemon zest finish. Full and creamy mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer!"
"Overall, this is a decent offering of the Tripel style, but it's a little too ordinary for my taste. I can drink this, but I wouldn't be writing home about it the next day. I would most likely recommend another brewery if someone inquired which commercial tripel to purchase. St. Bernardus offers other varieties that I feel are superior to this."
"Drinkability: I should have purchased a few more bottles, this is the best tripel I've had."
"Very good tripel, but not my favorite. Definitely worth sampling once on a while."
"I still like their Abt. 12 more."
"D - ...high drinkability, the smoothness and sweetness could get one in trouble"
"Picked this one up as a single in the High Gravity only (thank you) cooler at the Wine Vault in Charlotte. Probably about $7 for a 12 oz. bottle that they spilled a nice portion while opening for me. Anyway, versus the two tripels I had this past week, including a great one from Pisgah brewing, this one was good but not fantastic. Nice coriander fruit smell and taste, with a little more alcohol noticeability early on. More flavors came out as it became closer to room temperature. Something just seemed to bit a off, or maybe my expectation was just higher."
"This beers a superb example of an aggressive Belgian yeast thats actually quite tame and a pleasure to enjoy."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark straw color. Plentiful head sticks around forever...Aromas are sweet and candy like, lots of spice, citrus, esters, white wine, a little barnyard funk and a wee bit of alcohol to follow. Very rich and heavy on the tongue, slightly buttery (diecytal?). This one doesn't come in as thirst quenching as other tripels, and not as sweet in the end, a little too dry. I can appreciate it for what it is, but I'd much rather grab a Fin du Monde or Duvel anyday."
"This Tripel has excellent complexity and balance, and is incredibly drinkable. One of the best of its class. Highly Recommended..."
"Overall - An outstanding tripel.... the best i've tasted..."
"Drinkabitly is OK for a sweet beer."
"This beer has a nice balance between citric bittterness and the sweet, herbal taste. I think a tripel can be less sweet, which improved drinkability of the beer, but still very drinkable!"
"D: This is an excellent Belgian, and I like it significantly more than the Abt 12. The mouthfeel is a bit tiring, but the flavor is excellent, and this comes at an affordable price for a Belgian import."
"Mouthfeel is very full but not thick. Drinkable to a point; a sipping Belgian but not for big gulps."
"Pours a murkey orangish color with a small fluffy head with a little lacing. Smell of fruit, banana primarily, along with some clove and spices. Taste is much like the smell, but better. Sweet malty fruits dominated, but I do detect a bitterness in the finish that is very nice. Medium mouth and well carbonated. Very drinkable. Nice tripel."
"750 mL bottle. Hazy spun gold with rocky, sticky snow white head. Driving carbonation from the bottom of an Ommegang cervoise. Cavalcade of fruit aromas: pineapple, mango, peach, canteloupe. Yeasty sugar cookie scent as well. Muskmelon flavor predominates, then pineapple. Overall, fruity esters yield a soft, round flavor. Clean, grassy hops and funky sour yeast flavor through the finish, which, all things considered, is surprisingly dry. Pineapple juice/peach nectar burps. Smooth and soft mouthfeel, bordering on syrupy, but all the fruit flavors tend toward juicy. Medium body. My god, what a fine tripel! One would be hard pressed to find a more excellent example of the style. Superb."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent Tripel. The alcohol is something to watch out for, but I would recommend this brew to anybody curious to try the style."
"750 ml corked bottle. The cork went off with a loud pop. St. Bernardus Tripel pours out a slightly hazy golden color with a huge, white head. Nice lacing. The aroma is a beautiful spicy smell, with nutmeg and white pepper, as well as lemon. The flavor starts with a sugary flavor, though it's not too sweet. Bready malt. A delicious clove spiciness comes in at the middle. Some lemon and pineapple flavor too. Some hoppiness comes through at the finish. The mouthfeel really helps bring out the flavors in this beer. I'm sure I can't give it justice with words, but it feels to me like it melts in my mouth. An amazing beer, and possibly my favorite triple."
"This would be a great crossover beer."
"Drinkability: Great -- fantastic flavor and somewhat reasonably priced to boot. Still prefer Westmalle, but certainly one of the best."
"heavy mouthfeel until the end when it cleans up and finishes crisp and clean, bit of sweetness clings but not for long. Cinnamon, peppery finish mixes with the fruity profile nicely. There is a ton of things going on in this fine offering. Just glad to be here, right now."
"Note: I drank this right out of the fridge and sipped it as it warmed in order to experience that flavor changesI recommend you do this too if you are new to this style. It is amazing to me what a slight difference in temperature can do for a beer."
"I was surprised on pouring the beer by how tame (and disappointing at first) were both its initial aroma and head. The first estery/phenolic whiff of fruits and spices was plesant but subtle and short-lived. Rather than a thick rocky head, the beer produced large bubbles that supported only a thin layer. But its effervescence never died down, and that thin head proved to be long lasting and left behind a modest collection of Belgian lace. The first wave of flavor is likewise a bit underwhelming, if only because the tart (not astringent) tingling of carbonation dominates. But as the bubbles settle down in the mouth, they leave behind wave after wave of harmonious flavors--none of which are unfamiliar in a Belgian but nor does any single note dominate."
"A beautiful beer with nice rivers of carbonation flowing up through the pale, clear beer. Head is white and tall and cakey like you'd expect. Smells sweet and earthy. A nice mix of grainy, wheatlike to fruity melon like esters. A good helping of spice in there too. It tastes very grassy/wheaty. Enough spice comes into the taste. My only complaint is a lot of the complexity in the nose is not apparent in the flavor which comes across lighter than the rich smell. Mouthfeel is great, light to medium bodied. Has a nice amount of alcoholic warmth too it, but no real alcohol flavor. Very drinkable. All day long. I mean I drink the entire 750 ml bottles by myself with no problem of getting tired of it."
"Hazy orange color with carbonation bubbles and particals of yeast visable when held to the light. Has a sticky white head that leaved level of lacing around the glass. THe aroma is sweet and fruity. A bit sour too, but in a good way. Hints of burnt sugar, oranges, and sweet malts can be found. Has a complex yet clean taste. Flavors of cirtus fruits, bready yeast, and sugar fill the palate. Small amounts of hop bitterness can be found. A bit tartness in the end, but finishes off clean. A very warming and tasty Abbey ale. Expensive but worth every dollar. Buy it if you find it."
"Pours out great and leaves some head with a strong lacing. The smell is very flowrey and really great. Has a sweet flowery nose to it, like a great beligan tripel. Taste is malty and sweet with buttery flavors. It has apple fruit tones. Mouthfeel is a little off, but very nice. I don't like this as much as other Belgians, but it does fine for itself."
"Orange. Subtle aroma of citrus fruits, dough, bubble gum and sweet malts. The lovely malt and hop balance is only better complimented by the silky, coating mouthfeel. Slightly tart. Notes of cotton candy, bubble gum and tropical fruits. Wow, damn, why was I ignoring this beer for so long?"
"Drinkability: Enticing and intriguing, this is an unusual and challenging tripel"
"All in all, a fairly drinkable beer considering the magnitude and pedigree but still has a bit of an edge to it."
"In the interests of full disclosure, I'll add that this review is of 11.2 oz bottle that is stamped in all languages except English - recommended consumption before the end of 2004. A fresh 750 ml bottle may turn out even better (however, I don't think this little angel lost something in the few years it was lying around)."
"Drinkability? High. Very high. It's just so damn good, who cares if it's on the higher ABV scale at 8%? But too much of any good thing is a bad thing, so I usually limit myself to two a day, tops. Not two St. Bernardus a day, I ain't Daddy Warbucks. Planning on following this with a Victory Hop Wallop. It's Friday. Should be a fine night."
"This is exceptional stuff. It's too sweet for me to drink it frequently; I'll have it now and then for a treat, and savor it when I do. With more balance against the sugar and some smoothing of the few rough edges, I could drink this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
"An excellent tripel.... an excellent brew. This is what a dry tripel should be like. A hard choice between this and Westmalle's tripel."
"750ml corked bottle. Cloudy golden yellow with a tall white head that was fed by a constant stream of bubbles. Nice creamy thick lacing. Rich sweet fruits aroma with some pears and a nice amount of spice as well. Notes of yeast and doughy malts came out as well. Starts off with a smooth sweet fruit medley of pears and some others I couldnt quite pick out. A good mix of spices, yeast and bread came though to balance the sweetness and add great depth to this. Finishes up dry and spicy with hints of fruit. Fantastic taste with plenty going on. Good thickness to the body with plenty of carbonation, perhaps a tad too much at times. Greatly drinkable stuff as well. Easily one of the best Tripels I have ever had."
"Great looking beer. Poured an extremely clear and strongly-carbonated golden orange-yellow. Left a small blanket of very persistent foam and super-sticky lace. Fragrant with cloves, bananas, very clean sweet alcoholic citrus. Creamy and smooth mouth-feel, with big carbonation from lots of tiny bubbles. Light citrus up front, turning slightly medicinal, herbal, in the center before finishing with strong hop bitterness, alcohol and cloves. Taste is a little thin in the middle, but overall the beer is subtle, flavorful, shockingly light and easy drinking."
"medium-bodied and a high carbonation. bready malts with herbs and an alcohol sweetness. much more subdued than the 12 in flavor. goes down easy, but fairly reserved for a tripel."
"A really good Belgian Tripel. Savor this one slowly....then have another. This was a nice gift from my girlfriend....a 4 pack for Valentine's day ! ( ...the woman cares )."
"Very drinkable, but tasted strong with the alcohol not as well hidden as the Westmalle. But an excellent, delicious beer. And my wife says I look like the monk on the label!"
"Poured into a goblet, the resulting head was huge. It diminished quickly over it's peach colored body. Full of floaties, this one. A strong fruity spicy nose, furthered the spicy taste. Snappy yeast, apples, citrus, bready, flowery. Complex and flavorfull, this one masks it's rather heady amount of alchohol magnificantly. Top notch."
"Notes: There was a price check at the register and the bag boy was sent to check it out. He came back and said $5.00. I almost asked him to go back and get me three more. I didn't know what the price was and was prepared to pay more. I suspect it was more expensive than that but I am not going to argue with him."
"A very crisp drink and excellent mouthfeel make this a beer that stands out from the rest."
"Drinkability is a little above average. I enjoy the style, but am unlikely to want more than 1-2 per sitting. Usually the sweetness gets to me and I want to move on to an IPA or a Pils."
"d - Enjoyable to drink. I would drink this again. Goes down smooth and easy. I ate some aromatic cheese while enjoying this ale. It's flavor comes shining through."
"not too hot on this Tripel. i was excited because it was a christmas gift but it just didn't do anything for me. ive had better, and this just didnt cut it for me, especially because of the predominence of the alcohol."
"Medium body with an alcoholic warming sensation. Slick mouthfeel that coats the tongue and teeth, leaving traces of goodness to be savored for several minutes after initial and final tastings. For 8% ABV, very drinkable."
"Poured a hazy peach color with a huge blooming (almost to much) head that consumed the whole beer now a fluffy head on top of a Belgian tripel is nice but this went a bit overboard.I notice a little funk in the aroma like a saison in some ways with its mentioned funk and peppery spice with just a light note of citrus,quite spicey on the palate cloves coriander and black pepper really come thru with an underlying candi suger elemant.A nice creamy mouthfeel lended itself well to this brew.A nice tripel but I have had better the Witkap tripel I had just yesterday to me was more broad and enjoyable,all in all not bad but to me not worth the hype."
"Taste; the citrus flavors stand out up front (lemon & oranges), with a nice bit of bread dough in the middle and finishing with the peppery spices and cloves with a touch of banana pushing through. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with really nice carbonation."
"A very drinkable Tripel."
"Overall- A tasty Tripel that was too easy to drink. A beer worth revisiting again, soon!"
"D-This beer has a wonderful aroma but the taste doesn't follow thru with all the complexity. It is still very easy to drink and it drinks pretty quickly."
"This brew is a little sweeter than expected, but it is still an excellent brew."
"Exceptional. Wondrous. True artistry."
"D - Well balanced, alcohol is perfectly integrated, good stuff."
"Overall a very good beer."
"A lovely beer, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I like the fact that this tripel is on the lower end of the ABV scale for this style., as with all of the St. Bernardus brews I've tried it is top notch."
"Mouthful is great, well carbonated, yet creamy. This IS liquid bread! Increadible (were all monks alcoholics?). Highly recommended, and the best of this style that I've had (superior to Westmalle in my opinion)."
"Complex, interesting and refreshing. Something special and well worth a try."
"Another great beer from St. Bernardus. This pours a slightly cloudy soft yellow color with loads of white foam that keeps for a long time leaving behind a good deal of lacing. Aromas of dried fruits, oranges, honey, and alcohol dominate. The taste is just incredible; different flavors (both sweet and bitter) play together instead of fighting one another. The richness of this beer becomes apparent almost immediately. It's very easy to drink because of it's smooth texture and unique flavors, despite the high ABV. The aftertaste is a mixture of freshly cooked dough and fruits; very enjoyable. This is definitely my favorite Tripel yet."
"This brewery is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. If this brew has any downfall it is that it is a little on the sweet side. Still, an amazing offering that must be tried to be appreciated."
"Dark gold in colour with high carbonation. Aromas are of light and slightly sweet malt, black pepper, and touches of grassy hops and banana. The flavors are somewhat fruity (a bit more banana and apricot) and sweet, but are balanced out by some spicy yeast notes. A bit of alcohol warming, but nothing over the top in that regard. No surprises, but this is a well made, balanced tripel."
"Medium mouthfeel at best. Only coats the mouth slightly. A pretty refreshing brew. Cutting down on the sharpness would help."
"Hand's down, one of the world's best beers. Big aromas of ripe or over-ripe fruits. Sweet and mature. Balanced spiciness with a light yeast, musk, and dough-like mellowness. Looks copper-peach with a thick haze. Moderately carbonated and an ideal foamstand. Tastes are bold and mellow of ripe peaches, pears, pineapples, mangos, papayas. Spicy from belgian yeast...almost like nutmeg, corriander, curraco, alspice. Sweet and dough-ey yeast and a viscous musk flavor shows it's age. Sweet alcohol flavors add to the complexity. Viscous to the entire mouth, cut through by the alcohol. Finishes sweet and refreshing, mildly drying and spicy. This is certainly one to savor although easily drimkable."
"Insanely drinkable. This is a top shelf tripel in all respects.I will definitely pick up another bottle the next chance I get."
"D: Very good, definitely a session beer. The westmalle is my favorite tripel, but this is another excellent example of the style. Would be much enjoyed with a nice meal."
"D: Quite good, though inhibited by the alcohol taste."
"This is one hell of a tastey tripel. Almost as good as Westmalle and full of fresh flavors. A must try."
"From the 750ml corked bottle, the St. Bernardus Tripel pours approximately one inch of stark white head and settles to a golden straw color that is free of any visible particulates when held to the light. The initial smell is dominated by sweet grass, alcohol and barley. Upon tasting, hints of mellow citrus fruits, particularly grapefruit and apricot, are present on the tip of the tongue that rolls into toasted wheat when swallowed. The taste of alcohol is very upfront and sharp with little apparent attempt to blend, hurting the drinkability. As the beer warms it develops a fruity tartness that is quite refreshing."
"Clear caramel/orange colour, at least until I dumped in the yeasty goodness. Then it was filled with tiny flecks of brownish yeast. Light beige head that leaves solid layers of foam on the sides of the glass. Bready and caramel malty aromas form a good base for fruitiness (pineapple, cherry) and a hint of spice. Mild and balanced, the flavours meld together very well. Malty up front, with some caramel and toffee hiding behind the doughy bread character. Alcohol is mild and warming throughout. Faint spices come through, some nutmeg, along with a bit of vanilla. Truly exceptional. Creamy, milky texture coats the palate, but isn't overbearing. Moderate carbonation that's well integrated, producing fine bubbles that contribute greatly to mouthfeel. I'm very happy with this beer. An excellent member of an exceptional set of beers from St. Bernardus."
"If you like Belgian beers then a four pack won't be enough..."
"All in all, this is a very good beer which I'll probably try again."
"Pours yellow-to-slightly orangish with a ¾ inch white head that dissipates after about two minutes to an ultra-thin film. Chalky yeast persists near the bottom of the glass as mild carbonation makes its way to the surface. The nose is slightly tropical and fruity but really quiet tame. Apricots and toffee make up the bulk of the taste while mild phenols roll over the tongue. Very, very drinkable. Smooth and mild."
"This Tripel had an outstanding pure white head, atop a medium-golden amber-colored body. The lacing was very delicate. The first thing that jumped out to me about the bouquet of the beer was a faint hint of banana balanced with yeasts. The taste first revealed what I had already smelled, but then began to come alive as it warmed, giving hints of candy sugar, hops and more complex fruit flavors. There was just enough carbonation to balance the creamy taste and mouthfeel. I was extremely impressed with the complexity of taste and feel on the palate. Most certainly one of the best Tripels Ive had in recent memory."
" Creamy, slightly foamy body holds a palate of lightly sweet malt, Belgian yeast, and a touch of hops. Notes of banana, bubble gum, treacle, and a little bit of clove. Mouthfeel is creamy but then oddly dry on the finish, with more of an alcohol presence. I remember this being a bit tastier in previous encounters, but it's still good stuff."
"Note: Bottle says 8% alcohol"
"Excellent drinkability. I would drink this every night if I could find it and afford it! Probably THE example of what a Tripel should be."
"D - I can see myself getting this again, the ABV is very high, and you sure can't taste it. This is a very good tripel although at first I didn't think it was."
"I only have 3 bottles left from my 4-pack. Now it seems I need a case, though that probably won't happen. Pick this up if you can find it."
"This brew pours a semi-cloudy orange color with a nice white head. The aroma is strong. Orange peel, and spices. The taste fantastic. Fruity and juicy with spicy undertones. The mouthfeel is juicy and well carbonated. Overall, this is a great brew. Very refreshing."
" drinkability, is awesome! one of the best brews I've ever had!...but...it IS sippin beer, to be enjoyed and savored, as I am doing, got it in a St. Bernadus chalice as well, ...Whoa HO!"
"D - Either this is a bad bottle and this tripel spoils amazingly well, which I doubt (bottled 2004), or this is simply not a beer I enjoy. I have yet to taste a tripel that I would not choose over St Bernardus."
"Golden orange with a big ol white head. Light floral and honey aromas. Spices also. Grassy and citrus flavors abound (I said abound). Well carbonated. Dances across the tounge. Touch of alcohol in the finish. Very nice beer. Would recommend to anybody, especially at he 3.50 per bottle price tag."
"Drinkability is decent. Slight alcohol presence keeps it from being better than just good."
"A nice coppery-tan with much haze. Creamy head dies quickly to a creamy film. A smell of sweet fruit is present but light. Flavor starts out with some light fruit and slight bitterness, and an even smaller hint of ripe sourness. Beer turns dry with a slight flavor of alcohol. Very lively carbonation and moderately light body, add to a pretty good drinkability. There are tripels I would rather drink, but I will have this again!"
"Poured a cloudy golden color with a medium head that left nice lacing. In the aroma I detected some orange, wheat, yeast and some slight coriander. Taste started off with fruits such as orange, lemon, starfruit... at that point it became carbonated and there was a dry, woody taste. Very little alcohol was noticible."
"Opinion: I believe that this is the best true to style Tripel that I have tried. It is an excellently crafted beer, and one that everyone should try at least once even if you don't like Belgian styles."
"Poured a cloudy golden color, three finger head which has retained a half inch, highly carbonated with floating belgian yeast-very interesting! Nose is of fermented fruits and spices. Taste is a nice complex medly of fermented fruits and peppery spices, wheat, and hops. Mouthfeel is lively on the palate and fairly full and pleasing for the style. Drinkability is perfect as one cannot detect the high abv in this brew. Totally smackable brew!"
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange, huge white head forms, goes slowly, impressive lacing until the end, nice legs. Smell is malty sweetness, honey, spices, apple. Taste is yeast, sweet malt, honey, wheat, spices, light fruits. The mouthfeel is very full, medium high carbonation, very clean and very dry. An excellent beer."
"I can't say that I've hit on a tripel I would call my favorite yet. I had high hopes for this one, but it hasn't stood out for me."
"Hazy amber, with a diminishing head. Lots of carbonation, just a pleasure to look at. Smell is spicy, yeasty, and has that Belgian malt odor going for it. This tasted more like a strong pale with a dry spiciness that barely let any fruit flavors come through. Mouthfeel is medium and satisfying. An easy to drink beer...recommended."
"Pours a hazy golden peach color with a tall white head that leaves sheets of lace on the walls of the glass as it slowly recedes. Nose is quite floral with aromas of honeysuckle and perfume as well as a strong spiciness with notes of coriander, clove, and white pepper. Taste begins with tropical fruit, bubblegum, and a bit of medicinal phenols followed by some bready and yeasty notes. Flavors of raw honey and vanilla make an appearance towards the end with a bit of warming alcohol in the finish. Wow, very nice beer here."
"This beer is highly drinkable as a sipping beer, ideal for a wine and cheese hour or for dinner. The higher alcohol content may catch some by surprise, mainly because it is so well hidden by the flavors. At $3.99 per 11.2oz bottle (where I found it), this beer is meant for special occasions (or tastings at home, where I reviewed it). Definitely one of the best that I've ever tasted."
"Overall: Great tripel that has a huge flavor. St. Bernardus still hasn't done me wrong."
"Color of a field of wheat. Thick, cannot see through the beer. Aroma is slightly sweet with hints of banana. This rain is ruining my mood for this beer. I am trying to be fair in my review. I have another bottle and will have to re-review it later. Flavor is pretty complex. Picking up some wheat, some breadyniess, and then there is a whole bunch of fruit flavors with a big fat banana as the predominant fruit. Lots of yeast. A very bubbly beer. Almost sletzer like until I let it sit for a few. Full body with an almost creamy feel to the finish. Goes down smooth enough--but like I said this weather is not for this beer."
"The mouthfeel is light, but smooth and creamy in its texture, refreshing for an ale of its abv%. I'll be stocking up on more of this, great to see this in Alberta finally. Definitely a tripel that must be tried at least once for the sheer experience of it. I have a warm glow as I finish my glass, and I don't think it's just the 8% talking in that regard."
"It is hard to be subjective when rating such a beer, but this one really does deserve its praise. Personally, however, it did not fully fulfil my expectations. Still, this begs to be tried by every beer lover. A definite must have."
"Drinkability is very good a enjoable beer a bit pricey for me. But must admit this Tripel has me enjoying this style more then I have before."
"The first taste evident is the malty sweetness. Hints of fruits and yeast are also there. A kick of hop biterness comes through at the end and lingers for awhile. Alcohol not really evident anywhere."
"Bottle. Lively gold with two fingers of white bubbly head leaving plenty of lace and lasting well. Aromas of orange peel and spice with a sweet malty background and a slight Belgian funk, although a little more muted than expected. Taste was a little medicinal, with a sweet malty start, spicy middle and a very dry peppery finish with a light bitter hop punch right at the end. Alcohol was a little noticeble, but not overwhelming. Palate was creamy and light as it should have been. Competent Tripel."
"A very good mouthfeel as well, good body and creaminess. Eminently drinkable, but a bit costly."
"Get one. Try it."
"The taste is rather mild, given the color and aroma, but tasty. Not one of my favorites, but I will keep a few in the cellar to try as they age a bit."
"Price paid...$7 and change."
"I had already been very impressed with this beer in the bottle a day or two before this and was now anxious to try it on tap. This was in De Zolder, Bruges. Appearence was good but not as impressive as from the bottle. Smell was as good as the bottle, but unfortunately the taste fell a little short of the extremely high standard experienced in the bottled version. Still a quality Belgian Tripel, but preferred it in the bottle."
"Drinkability: Smooth and sweet easy drinking and still a savory experience."
"Drinkability- Probably the best or at least comparable to the best tripel I have had. I just hope the store gets some more of these in soon. Time to stock up and age a few."
"While a good beer, it's not my favorite tripel."
"Palate- the sugar and bananas are balanced by a bracing kumquat-ish tartness with just a hint of bitterness. It is a clean beer, and a subtle malty tone is present in the finish. Nicely balanced - this is somewhat champagne-like in character."
"Pours a cloudy deep golden with a good two inches of white foamy head. Lots of suspended sediment floating around in the glass. Smell is very sweet and bready---banana bread might be the way to describe it, with lots of spiciness and a hint of alcohol in the background. Mouthfeel is the first thing that strikes me with this beer---extremely creamy and bubbly---feels just wonderful on the tongue. Taste is very complex and fruity, with hints of caramel and bread coming through. I was pleasantly surprised by the lightness and drinkability of this beer. I could have these all night long."
"Overall I like this beer very much. Drinkable beer, alcohol may be a bit much in the long run, but it doesn't come thru in the taste."
"Pours a very cloudy light caramel color, topped by about a finger of bubbly white head. Suspended in this brew is a maelstrom of small dark sediment. Lots of bready malt in the nose, along with some spice, a touch of alcohol, and a hint of fruit. Taste begins very smooth and tame, but then bursts into complexity. Similar to the nose, dry yeasty malt dominates, but there is also a good dose of spiciness that excites the taste buds. Subdued tropical fruit (pineapple and something else) are present, as well as an herbal, earthy, very slightly citrous hops presence. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, only a slight warming feeling is noticed. All in all a good tripel, definitely a must try, but I wouldn't rank it #1 in the style."
"Sweet corn, skunk, straw and toasted malt are evident in the nose. Medium bodied and VERY dry mouthfeel. Yeast and alcohol are also pretty forward in the profile. I can appreciate that this isn't another overly sweet Belgian ale. The flavors are almost subdued.. the malt and heavy carbonation do alot of the work here. This is only my second taste of St. Bernardus' ale, and I would definitely like to try more from them."
"Beautiful hazy golden brown color. Foamy head is large at first, a 3/4"" solid layer across the top of my chalice before fading to a small creamy white 1/4"" layer. Smell has that great Belgian yeast funkiness to it, woody and earthy, slight cotton candy. Taste is full and creamy, again woody and deep leading up to a nice alcohol tingle in the finish, a very delicious and rich belgian ale. The label is cool with a very jovial looking monk urging you to try his beer. I agree. Try it."
"Mouthfeel and drinkabilty: Could be one of the better singular beers I have ever had."
"A lush, creamy mouthfeel is achieved by a medium/big body filled with tight, playful, and modest carbonation. A georgous triple, and one we should all seek out and enjoy! Thanks for sharing Gabe!"
"Overall, very nice, but too many odd fruits and bubblegum. Although clearly high quality and world- class as a beer, I will likely always pick something else in the same price category and style type."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a big ol' head. Smells of grassy hops and brown sugar sweetness. Vanilla and a little clove in there too. Tastes malty sweet, but not as sweet as I would expect from a tripel. The caramel-like sweetness is backed up by some noticable hop flavors (straw/grass-like) and with a hint of the vanilla that was in the aroma. Just a bit of alcohol is noticable towards the end. Fades into a pleasant finish that is sweet and at the same time a little dry. Effervescent with a somewhat chewy body. This beer is one of the best balanced tripels I have had to date. Not too one-dimensional, which can be true of others. A great beer. Will buy again."
"Comments - This is a great tripel, and should definitely be tried."
"Big bottle...darker than amber appearance with reddish orange highlights, murky and sedimented. Lots of carbonation to handle, nice head that's rocky and great at holding shapes. Laces like a champ, complex patterns in dry rings down the glass. Nice aroma, sweetish and fruity with unripe mellon, breadfruit, citrus and yeast all chiming in. Mouthfeel is lively -- seeming in style. An interesting take on a Tripel, lots of complex sweet maltiness more common in other styles -- fruits and dark earthiness, but a decent hop balance. The spritzy cartbonation combines to make this one fairly unusual. Estery finish. I like this one a lot, sweeter and not as dry as I usually expect, and in some ways, more drinkable for it."
"Beer is good. Happy tripel beering."
"Beautiful, well-rounded sipper to have throughout a meal."
"I'm not a big fan of the tripel style but this one was pretty good in my book."
"The hops have wide range of citrusy flavors. Tastes of lemons, oranges, pineapple and a hint of pears, along with a slightly astringent tartness vie for attention. A light peppery spiciness adds to the complexity of flavors. The too long lasting fizzy effervescence detracts from the overall mouthfeel. It takes nearly the entire glass for the flavors to meld into the total overall package. So after the initial first impression, let it sit awhile."
"I paired this with some Fratelli lobster ravioli in an alfredo sauce, and it had a perfect amount of sweetness to mingle with the lobster and the cream, but an acidic and dry enough finish to cut through the fat at the end. Superb."
"Great mouthfeel, not sticky for such a sweet, malty brew. Crisp and refreshing. I want another sip as soon as I swallow. Awsome brew!"
"This is a wildly complex beer that deserves to be among the greatest beers in the world. A ton of different tastes and smells makes it something really special."
"A good beer, but nothing really special. The alcohol was fairly strong, but never seemed overbearing."
"Exceptional, So quaffable. A treat. And easy to find. Hallelujah."
"Final Thought: This Belgian is clearly the best that this brewery has to offer in terms of overall quality, which really says a lot..."
"Very little head resulted from my pouring of this beer, but a nice foam layer remained on top of the beer for the entire tasting session. The color is an opaque apple cider color. My beer had tiny bits of yeast (?) floating around in it, but I don't think they took away at all from the flavor. The smell was sour lemon and fruity which were primarily of apricots. The taste grows on you because it is light and fruity, again with the apricot hints, but it has a definite malt breadiness. The mouthfeel is tingly with a dry aftertaste. This beer should not be overlooked. It was quite refreshing to say the least."
"Mouthfeel: explosive carbonation, good and complex, but the phenols/fusel alcohols were too much to enjoy a lot."
"Has a good amount of carbonation that feels almost like champagne with the bubbles and hop character working in unison to tingle the tongue. Very drinkable. A beer for all seasons, be it sitting out a snowstorm or hanging out on the back porch on a warm summer night."
"The king of tripels!"
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability and Overall: About as close to Tripel perfection as a beer can get. My first true Belgian Tripel and I'm blown away. I can't say enough about this beer. It's so rich and flavorful, yet so smooth a easily drank. I will be getting more of this very, very soon."
"Bottle: Poured lightly hazy dark yellowish ale with a super huge head with excellent retention. Carbonation was extremely good and body was a thinner then expected. Aroma is quite particular with some weird but enjoyable sweetness (like some crazy candy my kids would love) and good strong malt. The sweet malt dominates taste with some undertones consisting of soft spices, candi sugar and yeast. Wow, this one was quite a surprise and probably ranked very close to my top Abbey Tripel."
"Imho, the St. Bernardus beers are a bit overhyped. Sure, they're all pretty solid beers, but maybe not as good as some others."
"A hazy golden-amber body streams with a fine-bubbled carbonation beneath a full head of white froth. The head retention is excellent and it leaves walls of lace about the goblet. Bready, cookie dough-like, and even slightly toasted malt appears in the nose; accented by notes of yeast, vanilla, fruit (cherry, pineapple), flowers, and delicate spice. It's zesty on the tongue with a very fine-bubbled effervescent carbonation that warms to become somewhat creamy; although the medium-full body might have something to do with that as well! The flavor mirrors the aroma with the addition of some leafy hops and a stiff, balancing bitterness. It finishes dry and lingering with yeast and vanilla-laced cookie dough lingering amidst a dry, leafy bitterness. Impressive and unusual, the St. Bernardus Tripel is a not to be missed beer!"
"Drinkability: Hey, it doesn't get much better than this in this genre. Wonderful."
"this stuff isn't as nice of an experience as Pater 6 and Prior 8, but still very good"
"After falling in love with the ABT12, I decided I would try other St. Bernadus products. I quite enjoyed this one, though I don't think on quite the same level. Nonetheless it was still worth it, because I am savouring every last drop. It poured to a dark golden color with a thick white foam. The head retention was excellent. The beer almost seemed to fizz like a soda, regenerating the head. The smell is like a bouquet of flowers with some citrusy aromas. The taste is not quite as harsh as the quadrupel ABT12, and the mouthfeel revealed all kinds of complex fruity and floral flavors. The ABV is also quite lower thus allowing for a greater drinkability. On second thought, maybe I do like this better than the ABT12. I will definately buy more, as well as other selections by St. Bernadus."
"This is a good complex sipper. Appearance has room for improvment. Not the best tripel I've had but decent enough."
"This beer pours a hazy amber color with no head at all and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is somewhat subdued. Some spices and fruit, but not what I was expecting. The flavor has the spices in it and hints of the fruit, but the flavors are really subdued. Judging from the absense of any head, I might have had a bottle that was way past its prime. I'll give this one a revisit at a later date."
"Edit: I broke out the 750 tonight. Lets see what I think. The flavor is better than the other bottle I had. The spice and lemony flavors are better blended together than I remember. The feel is a bit more than moderate. Much better than I remember. Kudos to them on this one."
"After hearing a busy buzz about this beer I was glad to finally stumble upon it at D's in Pittsburgh. Steel City, baby. Great hazy orange amber tone to this beer with a rocky head that sticks around for a while. Nice. This beer is sitting maybe two feet from my nose and I can smell it clearly. Total yeasty spicy bready smell. Very ""Belgian"". Sweet light malts. Taste is fabulous. Much as the smell suggests, which is good. Yeasty sweetened esters up front with a freshly baked bread follow up. I think the merry monk on the label and I would be great pals. Great floral grassy notes to this beer, although not particularly ""hoppy"" in the American sense. A totally different interpretation of hops and malt here. And a tiny tad of bitterness at the end. Just enough to get your attention. Subtle is the word. But not wussy. Definately not. Very abundant flavor. Complex. Extremely cake-like. Very smooth and very light floaty mouthfeel. You can certainly taste the authenticity in this beer. An extremely drinkable beer, very easy going down. This is a cream of the crop beer from Belgium. Drink up chums."
"overall it's a very great brew, the best tripel i've had."
"This is a very drinkable tripel and well worth checking out."
"An excellent brew...I actually liked their Dubbel better but this is nothing to turn down either...One of the better tripels I've had..."
"Very good tripel here, and one of the best beers I've ever had. (It's even good after sitting for a few hours while I took an unplanned nap!)"
"11.2 oz bottle which I still don't understand the dating system. This one had notches on the 1,4,5, and 9. Poured a hazy orange with a nice fluffy 2 finger head into my gulden draak tulip. Aroma is pleasantly yeasty and spicy with orange-like notes providing highlights. First taste and I am positive that this is the best tripel that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. Slightly sweet taste contrasts well against a mild spicy background. Reminds me a little of a nice yellow cake mix with some earthy spice added. A hint of brown sugar is present in the finish which i found surprising. Excellent brew. St. Bernardus has yet to let me down."
"Taste is rather complicated to explain. There is a sweet bitter element that is beyond my beer-cabulary to explain mixed in with a sweet, sugary belgain flavor. There is also a light flowery component that makes gives the aftertaste an herbal feel. It is really difficult to seperate the elements on this one. I can only assume the balance is perfect."
"A hazed golden orange appearance. Volcanic streams of CO2 surface at extreme rates. A bigass crop of whipped white froth caps it off. After a few minutes, the head starts to look like a damn snocone. Beautiful appearance. Aroma hits home with some bready yeastiness, mint, candy, lemon pepper, must and earthy hops. On to the flavor, which can be summed up best as ""subtlety to perfection."" Cookie dough yeastiness, bready tones, mint leaves, soft candy tones, pepper, lemon, grass and yellow cakiness. This beer melts in the mouth like mother fucking cotton candy. Effin beautiful. And drinkable. Nothing alcoholic at all about this bitch. This one is a dandy. One of the best tripels I've had. Check that...THE best Tripel I've had."
"St. Bernardus beers have always been my favorite beers but I had never had the tripel. Tripels have never been my favorite style but as far as they go this one is pretty darn good. Pours a cloudy yellow with a nice fluffy white head and nice lacing. Very spicy, yeasty aroma. Taste is very smooth, spicy, and citrusy. Satisfying carbonation, not overcarbonated. Benefits from a little oxidation."
"The color was a nice hazy medium goden yellow, with a load of foam and a small amout of lace. The smell had a fruity aroma and a soft, sweet maltiness. It also had a lively mouth feel with a finish reminiscent of a mild brut champagne. Hard to find on the West Coast, found this in Williamsburg Virginia while traveling across country!"
"slight murky golden yellow color. Lots of carbonation that are constantly reinforcing the nice head. The smell is light, I smell some apple juice and a little spice. The taste is overall light, the most dominant taste is the spicy finish. The spice hits your tongue with a carbonation bite. Slight alcohol finish. It's overall mildness is refreshing."
"This came on tap in a tulip glass at Anam Cara. Bright hold almost champagne in color with a light white head and light lace. The color really was remarkable. It was amazingly clear for a beer. Great candy aroma with just a hint of fruit (apples and pears I believe). Delicate sweet character; almost wine in nature. This beer reminded me more of a Riesling, not a tripel. Silky light mouth feel very drinkable. Tripels are not my favorite style. I think they tend to bee too sweet, but this beer defies the trend and delivers a very pleasant experience."
"Top of the cork cage reads ""2008"" but the rest of the writing has been rubbed away. A rich, mucilaginous head the color of whipped egg whites, half an inch deep, starts to evaporate the moment I stop pouring. Noooo! Come back! No use... dies to a spotty eighth of what it once was. Roaring, endless carbonation; hundreds of tiny bubbles tessellate at the surface of the liquid. The goblet in my hand glows schoolbus orange with cadmium yellow highlights. Aromas are uninhibitedly sweet, vaunting honey, angel food cake, white grape juice, and rosewater. Talcum-powder nosefeel just barely keeps the sweetness from careening over the edge, with a starchiness to pull it in the direction of lemon pudding and, deeper down, graham crackers. Occasional whiffs of alcohol float around. The taste is a delicious marbling of pale candied fruit: gala apples, white grapes, pineapple, green cherries. In the finish can be found duck sauce, hop cotton candy, and some form of incidental spice (cinnamon?). A welcome crabapple sourness emerges with warmth. Strongly carbonated mouthfeel fades to impossibly soft, albeit with a light residual sweetness. A small addition of yeast lends some body that may stand up to the sugar for the better. As it is I'm not blown away... it needs... something. Delicate bitterness or rough alcohol or... something to lend it a self-contained idiosyncracy. But it's good. Damn good."
"The smell is orange, citrus, pepper and malt all wrapped into one. The first thing I notice about the taste is how smooth it is. So well balanced it is almost mind blowing. Sweet in the beginning, spicy in the middle and hoppy-dry in the end. That dryness at the end is what I love. Todd told me the Watou Triple was dryer and I have to agree. This one seems to have more body and balance. I love it."
"50 cl bottle. A very nice Tripel. Sweet at the start, drying quickly and spicy."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a golden, slightly hazy color. Aroma is citrusy fresh, slightly sweet (not real strong) with a subdued Belgian yeast profile. Flavor is a tart tripel flavor of sweet and tart oranges mixed together with a slight hops backend. Mouthfeel is very creamy and goes down very easily. This is a very good beer that I would gladly drink again and again, but to be honest, there are a few other Tripels that I prefer (and I do prefer tripels!!!)."
"Once uncaged, the cork came loose with nary a pull. Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 2"" of dense, creamy, slightly off-white head over the light golden-honey hued brew. Head shows great staying power, and lacing is amazingly hearty and plentiful. Aroma is a bit spicy, in that expected Belgian way, with yeasty, slightly malty undercurrents. Taste is upfront delicately fruity, following with hearty malt character, and only the slightest hint of the alcohol we know all tripels have. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are both excellent. A must find for the Belgian aficianados."
"Dark yellow with a few sediments left, generous head. Malty and yeasty aroma. The taste is very malty sweet with a decent fruitiness of oranges, lemon, bananas and mango, a little sour, lightly bitter finish. It's not poorly done, but I certainly expected more from a tripel, especially from this brewery. A ton of better examples out there with far more interesting yeast strain."
"I love the St. Bernardus flavor. A world class Belgian, not much more can be said."
"A very good tripel. This is only the second bottle I've had since it became available in the Dallas area."
"33 cl bottle dated best before the end of 2004. Pours a muddled golden hue with some orange highlights into the St. Bernardus balloon-shaped chalice. Cappuchino-like frothy head and a few darker colored yeast and protein coagulation chunks left in suspension. Nose is mostly of sweeter, bready malts, yeast and a complex fruitiness ranging from apples to tropical fruits. Initially malty and doughy sweet on the palate with lively effervesence, then turning yeasty and fruity and finishing dry and estery. Warming alcohol effect on the esophagus and stomach. Pretty unique and unconventional style of a tripel even though this is a classic whose recipe has not been tampered with. So I take back ""unconventional""."
"Pale orange color is very pleasing to the eye, and the mad rush of carbonation feeds and inch tall head that stays around forever. The lacing on the sides of the goblet is quite nice too. The aroma is flowery and tropical with saffron, banana, coconut, and mango on the nose. The Taste is quite sweet with the fruity flavors mentioned above and alcohol warmth that reminds me of a mixed drink made with some rum. The finish is pungent and dry with slightly puckering hop bitterness and a peppery spiciness. A very well done Tripel that is now easily acquired in Georgia. In my opinion, sets the bar for the style."
"Drinkability: I liked this, but it wasn't immeadiately drinkable. It was almost too much to handle, and when I tried taking large sips I found the experience poor. This is a great tripel, make no mistake, but you'll have to judge for yourself whether it is worth the price to make it a regular. Around me, I can't say that is the case."
"A very good brew. A definite buy again."
"Apricot-pineapple colored and cloudy with big chunky particles floating and suspended. A high head of chunky light-orange foam rises up and remains. Aroma is light, consisting of lemon and mango. Flavor is a bit yeasty, some lemon and spice and a slight cherry undertone. The ABV makes itself known with a bitter finish. Not as complex as I had anticipated. Thanks to MJR for sharing."
"In the end, this is a terrific beer for many reasons and a classic representation of the style."
"Beer has a nice cloudy peach color. Nice head to start off with but goes down to a lace that won't go away. This beer has nice carboniation. It has a very good smell. Malt plus fruit scents. The taste is lower on the Belgian spicy esters, which is good for a change of pace."
"Would be happy to have this one again!"
"My first sip I was impressed by the initial flavor and then a very smooth aftertaste. The later drinks did not have the same initial strength of flavor to them, but I assume that is due to my expectations changing. The overall flavor is relatively light and is very easy to drink. I was hoping for a slightly fuller flavor after the first drink, but even without that this was a very enjoyable beer."
"This is not a mind-blowing tripel. It's very good, but I've had better (Grimbergen, Victory Golden Monkey, New Belgium). I wouldn't pass this up, but then again, I wouldn't necessarily seek it out. Still, I recommended trying it."
"(33cl / 11.3 oz) (old)"
"Oh my...and the taste follows suit from the smell. Huh? Wow! This is yummy! The tropical fruityness is fabulous to my tastes; soft, full, bold, yet biting, all that was noted in the smell comes across in the tastes. Great fruits of dulled down orange and lemon with some pineapple and banana. Super fine creamyness and fullness. Mild as all hell yeast and spice just barely make an entrance peeking even more interest within the flavors. Maintains a strangely interesting finish of chocolate and caramel malty thickness which covers over the fruits later on, quite amazing! Far and away one of the best Triples I've enjoyed! Thick, lush, flavorful in fruits and candy action! Yum, yum, yum, this stuff rocks! I haven't had many Triples cuz most I've had I didn't like, but this St. Bernardus is mind boggling yummy!"
"Pours a slightly hazed burnt orange with a 1-1/2 finger dense head of white cottony foam. The aroma consists of a light spiced sweet fruit light lemon and a musty yeast smell. The taste is a creamy spiced fruit again, with a light raisin, yeast and a warming alcohol. This is a medium bodied beer with a slightly sweet finish. Very solid brew!"
""" consume before the end of 2004"" or something like that. Pours orangy/golden with chunks of sediment, raises a 1 inch head and leaves tons o' lace. Nose is powdery sugar and faintly flowery. Taste like golden honey, flowers, melons, wonderfully complex and silky smooth on the tongue. Wildy yeasty. Alot of excitement in a glass! seak this stuff out and enjoy."
"Had again almost two years later in a relatively inexpensive gift pack brought in by LCBO. Seemed fresher and very enjoyable. Yeast not as interesting as when I had several of my first set of trippels."
"extremely hazy peach-tinted gold with suspended chunks. mountainous head of creamy white foam that left sheets all over the glass. head never really disappears. aroma of musty belgian yeast, orange zest, and sugar cookies. very lively carbonation yet still ultra full and creamy in the mouth...awesome. big sugary/citrusy malt flavor with the right touch of belgian funkiness. finishes with more subtle lemon and orange zest flavors, balanced by earthy hops and spicy phenolic flavors. warming and boozy, yet still relatively drinkable. just a fantastic tripel, not too many others out there that i've had can compete in this league. great stuff."
"33cl bottle: This beer pours VERY hazy golden color. There is a big,thick white head with lots of small bubbles. Lots of carbonation. The aroma is citric, yeasty, with some spices (corriander?). Sweet taste has hints of banana, bread and citrus. An excellent Tripel!"
"Thick, off-white colored head that holds like a champ. Caronbation bubbles rising through the hazy golden colored liquid like upsidedown rain. Hints of tangy lemon, yeast, and spring flowers in the aroma. Sticky lace lingers as beer in the chalice disappears. Mellow lemon flavor, some light grains (wheat?) and light spices (coriander?). The finish is interesting, the flavor quickly fades leaving only the feeling of beer on the tongue, and a warm stomach. The beer is light and soft in texture, almost floating across the tongue. It's refreshing like a wheat beer, but with more body."
"Can St. Bernadus make a bad beer? Apparently not. While the Tripel isn't as good as the unbeatable, near perfect Abt. 12, it's a formidable beer in its own right. The best tripel I've sampled. Raise a glass to the smiling monk."
"Damn good, and at $7.49 for the 75cl, this is another winner from the smiley faced bald-headed monk chappies at Sint Bernardus. No wonder they look so happy."
"I expected wonderful and got damn fine. It is a damn fine brew, but not really one I'll trot off to find. I'll definately give Brouwerij Sint-Bernardus another go, but I won't expect as much going in."
"From a 750 ml with the happy monk on the label, it pours a pretty gold with an absolutely magnificent head that looks like a layer of vanilla pudding sitting on top of the glass. Although it doesn't really stick to the side of the glass it does leave a nice layer on top of the beer to the bottom. The smell is a nice mix of fruit, spice, and just a bit of hops. It starts out a bit strong for an 8% beer, but everything settles in nicely as the beer (as well as the stomach and face) warm a bit. Mouthfeel and drinkability are in line with the extraordinary smell and taste. This is another remarkable beer from St. Bernardus."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick white head. The aroma is good. It has a creamy citrousy scent; very nice. I also has another smell that I can't put my finger on; probably yeast. The taste is decent. It is rich and full of pale malts, belgian yeast, and some mysterious flavor. I really don't know what it is. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. I think this is an excellent beer; a great Belgian."
"pours a great looking cloudy yellow/gold colour with an absolutely massive head that, while dying down rather quickly, still remains rather foamy throughout and leaves a mildly impressive sticky trail behind. smells of bread, spice, grain, a bit of fruit, earth and clay. picked up something of a tart smell as well. nice. this brew is medium bodied and just full of flavour, starting sweet, going to a bit of a bitter/dry earth flavour followed by some spiciness and a dry fruity finish, along with a slight alcohol warmth. this is one drinkable brew. a great tripel that i can't wait to try again. nice and refreshing yet bold and complex."
"Man, I wish I had a smiling Monk T-shirt. He's about the coolest label I've seen in a while. Appearance was a very gold orange with tons of cloudy yeast and a giant white head. Smell was of yeast and alcohol with a bit of the fruity notes showing through. The taste was amazing. Upfront fruit, perhaps some apple as well as apricot. Followed by bready/yeast and sweet caramel flavors. Mouthfeel was creamy and satisfying. Drinkability was very good as well, better than their abt 12. All in all an amazing experience. I recommend this to anyone who can obtain some."
"The beer pours a dark very hazy yellow to gold with a huge head that is long lasting and nice lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is one primarily of barley with some tangs of coriander, almond, and orange in it. The taste is explosive in the mouth the way a good tripel should be but the taste is somewhat different. There is the definite barley malt and hops flavors. This one is a little hoppier than a lot of tripels, but there is an unusual undertone of spice that seems to be cardamom or something else exotic. The beer is heavier in the mouth than the Chimay tripel, for instance; a little richer, but not quite as smooth. I really liked this, and could sip a some more by a nice fire."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and some tingling develops in your throat during the swallow. The bread tones last long on the tongue. This is a meal in a glass. I'm going for another helping..."
" Aroma poses one of the mysteries that only a monastery Belgian ale can provide. Banana nut bread with a spike of clove, bathed in orange rum. Taste mirrors the nose, with the addition of fried apples with a dash of cinnamon. Tastes like a heavenly nectar, not like a beer. Delightful..!"
"Maybe it tastes that much better after watching UNC beat Uconn in hoops, but this is just an awesome beer. Trust the monk."
"Appearance: Unfiltered golden sunshine like tone with a nice layer of frothy white head leaves spread out Belgian style lacing, it's purdy. Aroma: Awesome pineapple bubblegum notes rich sweetness I'm loving this brew complex spiciness there, wow. Flavor: Nice fruit esters swarm the tastebuds this is the shit my style of a tripel. Creamy tone to it with the bubblegum sweet tone this is a classic tripel down to the T, nice spiciness. Mouthfeel: Creamy mouthfeel spritzy carbonation good stuff I'm loving this shit good stuff in my opinion. Drinkability: Excellent smooth delicate and hella drinkable."
"Seems not to hide the abv at all in the finish. This is quite a nice beer. Rich yet rounded... well worth seeking out!"
"I'm not a big fan of Belgian beers but a guy at work raved about this one and I felt compelled to try it. The color was a nice cloudy gold with a big frothy everlasting head. It had a big yeasty and citrusy aroma with elements of clove, white grapefruit, and orange peels. The taste was bitter and citrusy with bananas, orange peels, cloves and some sweet malt. The finish was citrusy and a bit astringent. This appeared to be a pretty complex beer and I fear my palate and nose were not discerning enough to really appreciate it. So, although I wasn't awed by this beer at the time I will no doubt try it again."
"Overall, a complex, wide-ranging beer. I could have done without the floaties but the taste and aroma more than made up for it. A fine tripel."
"I'll stick to the abt 12 in the future, but this is still a very nice offering."
"To me its very heavy for the style but a really enjoyable beer. I've had this before but wanted a fresh one to sample for ther review and truly a quaffable beer."
"Yellow orange with plenty of sediment suspended. Plenty of fluffy white head that dissipated fairly quickly to leave a blotchy film. Malty, bannana aroma with fruits and pepper. Cotton candy and fruit, with a dry finish that finishes very nicely. A bit lighter than I prefer."
"Sugary malt sweetness is heavily interwoven with a potent alcohol kick and all sorts of subtlties -- pineapple, cookies, banana, oak. Disturbingly light feeling as it goes down -- very easy to drink -- despite its almost creamy presence rolling around on the tongue. Shazam!"
"I must have been crazy when I first reviewed this. 4.9? What was I thinking. This is straight 5's. Hey when a beer is this good, that 0.1 means a lot. This is the beer I think of when someone mentions the word tripel. Deep golden color with a long-lasting white head that leaves a nice lace along the glass. Aroma is spicy and of tropical fruit. Taste is of apricots and pineapple and a little clove. Outstanding tripel. The abt 12 seems to get a lot of attention, but I feel that this is the St. Bernardus beer that everyone must try."
"It's as if this brewer, not satisfied with brewing the best brown beers available to humanity, decided one day to eliminate the obscuring color and thereby reveal the inner workings of the yeast politics inside the liquid. Like the giant clock in Prague, which would be impressive enough with a face, with the face removed, it's mind-boggling."
"Overall Impression: That monk on the bottle has reason to be happy. This is a very nice beer. Solid craftsmanship, no doubt. This isn’t a beer you would guzzle on a regular basis, in fact I’m wishing I could somehow recork this big bomber bad boy to savor later. So, drinkability is going to take a hit, but that shouldn’t discourage you from giving this a try. If you’re a fan of the Tripel’s, got to check this monk out."
"Huge white head that piles above the rim and almost overflows the glass. The head is very long lasting, and the thick lace sticks to the sides of the glass for the entire bottle. Golden amber in color and is fairly hazy. The aroma is quite spicy with light malt and some citric notes. Very smooth, medium-full mouthfeel. The alcohol is invisible. Initial malt sweetness of honey, candied sugar, and cookies. Spices come in more towards the middle. There is a slight citric tartness in the finish that nicely balances the sweetness. The aftertaste is not very long, but the honey sweetness stands out a bit. This one is a bit tough for me to put my finger on all the flavors. Theres a lot here, but everything melds together so well that it simply becomes one great Tripel thats gone before I know it!"
"Drinkability  This wasnt bad, but certainly not worth picking up again."
"Pours a thick looking, murky honey color and sports a hefty, yet quickly vanishing head. Moderately decent lace, yet patchy and scattered. Awesome aromatics! A veritable (malted) tropical fruit smoothie! Lots of pineapple and banana, a spoon of honey and a big dose of malted milk! Again, as with other St Bernardus brews, the alcohol is so very well integrated that it never comes off hot or overbearing. Medium to full bodied with nice viscocity. Tastes much like it smells. A malt monster accented with tropical fruits, especially banana and pineapple. The finish is long and very warming. Another ""nectar"" straight from the heavens-with the help of a lot of smiling, nicely buzzed monks! Delicious!"
" I enjoy this beer, but not being a Belgian beer expert, I feel I may be missing some of the complexity of this brew, or, conversely I may be looking for complexity that isn't there. Either way, I'll be having this again."
"Tasted on tap at De Zolder in Brugge. Appearance: Orange, clear, decent head. Aroma: Spicy hops, malt, some earthiness in background. Flavor: Spicy, fruity, with some maltiness and yeast in background. Some soapiness from hops. Finish: Mostly hops, with malt in background."
"Pours with a dense meringue like three inch head. A cloudy deep gold color. Lightly sweet but dry at the same time. A bit of orange crosses my tongue. Smells Belgian in its complexity (imagine that), a fruitiness and a mustiness is here in the nose. A sharpness in the taste is present from the carbonation (this beer is well carbonated). There is some spiciness in the nose too. Very well put together triple, there is a certain softness/ roundness from the malt that ties this beer together very well. Definite alcohol notes if you look for it, but definitely not in your face. Displays the classic Belgian lacing as you work your way through your glass. One of the best, if not the best, examples of the Tripel style of beer."
"I wasn't as bowled over by this as I was the Prior 8 or ABT 12, but this is a different style and it's tough for anything to live up to those. An excellent tripel from an incredible brewery."
"Orange gold color, slightly cloudy. Large creamy head. Aroma is fruity, touches of banana, peaches and oranges, and yeasts.A medium bodied Belgian. It really doesnt taste like a tripel, but it has all the other Belgian characteristics to it. Malts are fruity and sweet. Banana and cloves and spices are very evident. Nice bright yeasts. Very smooth taste. Its a very nice beer. Nice soft mouthfeel. Lively carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and soft. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"There is a big, cream-colored, coarse, noisy head that dies slowly in the tulip glass, leaving psycho amounts of sticky, thick, lacy lacing. The liquid is slightly hazy, deep orange/gold and is saturated with hyperactive carbonation. Hm. Nose is just a touch fishy. Lots of alcohol and Belgian spice. Just a little dust. Wow. Major butter in the spicy, tangy front. The malty, thick middle adds generous fruit to the butter. Finish is fresh, dry, with alcohol and apples. This is one fantastic, fruity, buttery beer. Wow."
"Corked 75cl bottle. The cork on this one as with the Abt12 bottle I had recently, shot out like a rocket after I removed the wire cage. I tried not to disturb the thick layer of sediment as I poured the first couple glasses. Fairly clear golden ale with an orange hue. Sizable white head settles down to a creamy layer of foam. Aroma is sweet and fruity and like most Tripels I've had. Flavor has a distinct citrus character, lemon and orange come to mind. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel that goes down real smooth. Alcohol is well hidden. The last glass I poured inevitably contained some yeast sediment. This glass was really cloudy and the overall flavor was less enjoyable. I'd recommend trying to leave the sediment in the bottle. This is a great Tripel that seems to be widely available."
"Though the Abt 12 is (justly) St. Bernardus' flagship beer, this Tripel more than stands as a good example of a quality tripel. St.. Bernardus is one of the great breweries of Belgium, and I will certainly enjoy this beer again!"
"Pours a clouded golden orange with a foamy white head. Aroma is of yeast, some spice, and esters. Taste starts out somewhat fruity, moves to hops, and ends with a fairly sweet, buttery toffee. Very creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. Finishes on the dry side. Has a fairly warming effect. A little sweeter than I expected or would have preferred, but it is what it is. All-in-all a very tasty tripel."
"Overall: This beer reminds me of why I chose the name, Tripel J. Perfect example of the style. Smooth and subtle and dangerously drinkable."
"Excellent tripel, in the style of Chimay Cinq Cents. Yeasy, relatively full-bodied. Decent sized head, some retention. Not much lacing. Fruity and somewhat spicey, much like Chimay or Westmalle (but not as lively as the latter). Overall, as good as most of the best tripels, but not as good as Westmalle, my favorite (and the original) of the style."
"St. Bernardus Tripel pours a hazy apricot color with a bubbly, creamy off-white head. Rings of lace appear as the beer disappears down the chalice. The bouquet of yeast, spices, fruity esters, hops and must is most pleasing. The flavors are quite diverse, as well. Notes of yeast, sweet malt, mild citrus, spicy hops, minor alcohol and apricot are detected. This is a very tasty brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. This beer possesses a great drinkability and is very well crafted. It's easy to see why the monk on the label is so jubilant --- this is a hedonistic brew!"
"Hazy orange beer poured with a huge, fluffy off white head. Head retention is amazing. Little trails of carbonation can be seen tracing up the sides of my goblet. The aroma is a powerful fruity mix of bananas and orange, with clove accents. Bready malt and yeast notes are also present along with some peppery hops. The taste is really nice as well, with complex malt and hop flavors intermingling, with dashes of alcohol and yeast. A decent citrus note steps in ocassionally. Very bitter finish that is also extremely dry. Not much sweetness at all in this one, actually. Dry up front and a dry finish. Maybe a slight fruity sweetness in the mid taste. I was expecting to savor this beer for a while, but it goes down very easily. Nice solid mouthfeel is a little spritzy from the very fine carbonation. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the ABV, as it is slightly noticeable on the palate. This is a very fine triple that I especially like because it leans toward the dry side and doesn't get too sweet. More like an Abbey IPA."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass (that I broke while washing after drinking this one, RIP). It pours a hazy orange-yellow with 2 fluffy fingers of foam. There is no lacing on this one. The smell is a sweet citrus aroma, lemon and orange. A little bit of spice to the smell also. The taste is very sweet with more fruit coming out, and a hint of cinnamon. A light touch of yeast and alcohol in there as well. The mouthfeel is very full and just dances all over the tongue. For 7.5%, this is one is very drinkable tripel as well."
"Very, very worthwhile brew."
"Overall this beer is a great find. Maybe not quite your quintessential triple, but a very drinkable beer with some great up front fruit. A must try."
"Originally sampled on 29 October 2002. St. Bernardus Tripel pours a golden brown color, and has a large, tightly bubbled head w/ champagne effervescence. It's flavor is fruity up front w/ a sweet finish. I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and will have it again"
"Excellent stuff."
"A soft mouthfeel, and fairly easy to drink, this beer came off as being not as regal and stellar as the style traditionally is. Tripels are supposed to be premier brews for special high holy days, and this one didn't sing out hymns to me like a Westmalle."
"Hazy light amber pour, large white head that mostly diminishes to good lacing. Aroma is yeasty, sweet, some lemony hints in there. Flavor is sweet, dominated with apple and banana, slight spice sneaks in, too. Body is medium, lively carbonation, and a very dry finish."
"Edit: Not quite a 5."
"Id drink it again, recommended."
"St. Bernardus Tripel: Mmmm, freaking terrific!! Deep amber colored beer. Great head, thick and long lasting. Aroma, some hints of yeast, some lemon. Bottom line, taste is wonderful. Some nice sweetness, with a hint of sourness as well that strikes a wonderful balance. I’m going to focus on finishing this beer rather than typing. Buy it."
"Drinkability: Good overall drinkability. I could drink a few of these over the course of an evening. This brew doesn't hide the alcohol as well as other examples, but is still a great example of the style."
"Pours with an everlasting yellow-tinged white head over hazy golden liquid, nice level of carbonation. Nose is sweet and ultra-fruity, of the tropical variety with some slight bubblegum/banana esters wafting around too. Taste is lightly spicy/peppery...and quite fruity, like fruit punch fruity! A very decent hop bitterness cuts through in the end to wash away residual sweetness, giving way to alcohol flavors that lingers 'til the end...a mind-blowingly good Tripel!"
"This complex beer is simply an awesome treat to drink. I'm happier than the monk on the label."
"Highly charged, not slick, but more refreshing than any tripel I can remember. No alcohol heat lingers. No slickness. Medium bodied, very good example of the style."
"Cloudy orange in color, with a finger-thick white head. Great lace down the glass. Aroma is bready and yeasty, with spicy and grape-like notes. Flavor is very gently spiced and very smoothly balanced. Bits of orange, maybe some banana in the finish. Well-carbonated with a light mouthfeel and a dry finish. Still, this beer seems a bit ""heavy"" to me. The mouthfeel is perhaps a bit too creamy, and this could stand to be balanced by some additional tartness, or some extra kick in the hop department. Decent, but I couldn't drink several of these in a row."
"F."
"Simply an amazing beer. Murky orange color with an impressive, small bubbled head. Aroma is spicy, and fruity (like orange rind). Taste is layered and complex: yeast, pepper, wood, citrus, grain. Finish is dry, and the mouthfeel is full, thick, creamy, and very soft. Alcohol warming is there, but it really isn't all that pronounced. Very good...wonderful."
"Drinkability - Not many would recommend a 7.5% brew as a session beer, but this tripel did not overwhelm you with the alcohol so you might have another. It is a quality Belgian beer that is probably just a shade lower than the top brews."
"Drinkability & Notes: Hmm … not exactly what I expected or even what I see a tripel as but there is no doubt this is a good beer. Nothing earth shattering, just good."
"Drinkability: Very good. A clean and smooth brew. It was much better as it warmed from refridgerator temperature."
"An golden/orange-yellow hued haze of a liquid with a very nice white head that stays quite well without any help. Amazing aroma! In-your-face sweet and spicy with a doughy yeast background. Banana esters, juicy strawberries, and am I crazy, or do I detect some mango in there as well? Slight spicy alcohol tones as well. Great complexity. And now into my mouth it goes... The first thought that hits me with this beer is the amazingly thick and chewy mouthfeel. Not many beers have this, and for me, it's a highly sought-after quality. Like the aroma, very sweet doughy flavor from the yeast and malt, like a mix between cookie and bread dough. This is perfect with the mouthfeel the way it is. Clove shows up in the spice department, a welcome addition to the other flavors. There is a bit of fruitiness, mostly banana, but it's much more subdued than in the nose. Hop bitterness plays a slight role, balancing everything out well. Alcohol warms all the way through. More targeted hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, a wonderful, wonderful beer. This one goes on the ""must buy in massive quantities"" list. My favorite tripel, even above Unibroue 10 and New Belgium's ""Trippel""."
"Deep golden-orange in color, huge foamy head that sticks around forever, spicy yeasty aroma of cotton candy. Sweet fruity flavors like banana bread, full body with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, has a sticky candy sweet finish, alcohol very well hidden, a great tripple."
"456"
"This beer poured dark golden color and formed a bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, citrus and spices. A flavor of malt, spices and caramel. A good deal of body to it to a point of being almost chewey in the finish. Another good beer from this brewer."
"Turbid dark golden hue. Covered by a fluffy, dense and well retained porcelain white head. Musty honey sweetness, powdery chalk along with pronounced banana esters and lightly tart green apple acetaldehyde in aroma. Clean, nectar like sugar hits the palate at first, then widens into a bready, dough like mellow sweetness. Fruitiness is comprised of mild banana esters and tropical hints of jackfruit. Subdued notes of black pepper alcohol, clove phenol and bubblegum esters add underlying herbal spice. Moderate in body and quite dextrinous, with carbonation lower than the norm helping lend a smooth mouthfeel. Residual sweetness is left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. Finishes expectedly sweet, but slightly minerally, with a hint of must as well. A delicious tripel, with overall balanced skewed towards sweetness. St. Bernardus is soft on the palate and quite a mellow example of the style."
"The beer pours a tenebrous rusty orange-yellow color, the head behemothic in size, texture that of whipped cream and the color a dazzlingly white with enormously thick glutinous sheets of lace that clean mightily to the glass. Nose is yeast laden, malt, hints of lemon peel, with and underlying sweetness. Front is ambrosial, the top middling in feel, the finish is devilishly carbonated, divinely hopped droughty long lasting aftertaste. This bottle borders on being 2 years old, the high ABV is quite evident in the Belly Warming, and the deep malt body adds much to this beer. Oddly enough, seems people either love it or dislike it, I Love it!"
"my first belgian...cloudy golden color, moderate head and some thin lace left after a few minutes. aromas of caramel apples and pears. taste is delicious beyond compare.  complex and layered.   fruits and spice hide an underlying malt body and dry alcohol finish.  simply awesome.  can't wait to dive into this style."
"The best Tripel I've had. Rich color, nice head, good spice with a strong finish. I like it a bit better than the Abt."
"A wonderfully drinkable tripel that is surprisingly light.   Nice orange color with tangerine/orange flavors very abbundant.  Slightly sweet flavor with wonderful head. Having drunk the St Bernadus Abt the night before the tripel, I tasted a few similarities in the finish (caused by the water?).  Overall, one of the best tripels I have had the pleasure of drinking"
"Expensive, but the best tripel I have ever had.  I could not find any flaws.  An explosion of flavor, yet comfortable and not overwhelming"
"Notes: Simply put, this is an amazing Belgian Tripel. Crafted to perfection. Talking too much about it belittles its greatness. Just buy some and enjoy. 7.5%abv."
