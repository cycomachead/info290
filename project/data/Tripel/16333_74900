Has some Saison features, which I personally like, but not everyone else may feel the same, almost as if this is a part french beer, instead of just Belgian Tripel. Some citrus, sweet candy notes, along with the overall champagne, quite unique... not amazing, but very good! This beer's alcohol content makes you feel really good and relaxed, unlike a Maiboch which gives you a headache.","paladinjoe","Apr 12, 2014"

3.32,-11.2,3.5,4,3,3,3.25,"O: Decent beer, the bitterness takes over after a few sips and the roasted flavors and sugars disappear rather quickly leaving you with a bitter taste that lingers for a long time. Probably would pair well with a sweet chicken dish like a marsala, something to offset the bitter that just hangs. Most IPA's have a bitter that lingers but there are discernable characteristics of the lingering bitter this just...well...is. Not a session beer due to 8.5%ABV, a few of these and you're right as rain.","Cozuma","Feb 20, 2014"

The nose is right on for the style. The taste features waves of lemon zest, banana, clove, and bread. Lots of Belgo flavors workin' in this brew. The body is medium with high carbonation.

Little bit of earthy grain as it warms, almost like some maris otter malt is used.

3.56,-4.8,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Pours out a deeper orange-tinted golden hue with a medium amount of clouded haze with a nice fluffy cap of bubble-bath foam on top that doesn't leave much lacing but looks pretty for the short time that it lasts. Texture is sort of thick and slightly under-carbonated for my taste in the style. Smells like an overripe mushy pear that has been dipped in cereal grains and than sprinkled thoroughly with green cardamom. Gains an unwanted slight metallic tinge when allowed to warm up all the way to room temperature. Has all the fruity ester-fied (grapes, pears, plums) flavor of a Belgian-styled ale that you would expect, as well as a nice dose of spiced cloves on top...and the ABV is hard to detect. If only it didn't gain that weird metallic tinge when it warmed up and had a better texture, I would have been a real fan of this one.","WastingFreetime","Dec 25, 2011"
3.41,-8.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall a good Tripel that leans heavily to the spicy side of the spectrum, not especially balanced or nuanced in taste. The addition of a little sweetness and fruit would go a long way here.","emerge077","Dec 24, 2011"

4.6,23,4,4,5,5,4.5,"The Crack & Glug proved that I am slightly out of touch as I got some overflow as the big, thick, eggnog-colored head roared up from the bottom of the glass and over the rim of my glass. Its retention was actually becoming a problem as it seemed to refuse to drop, hindering me from pouring what still remained in the CAN. Color was a slightly-hazy deep golden-yellow. Nose had a papery mustiness, undoubtedly yeast-driven, like newspapers out of the attic or basement. Wow! I was really anxious for the first sip once the head got under control. Mouthfeel was quite full, very viscous as I rolled it around on my tongue, taking in the melding of flavors that included tropical fruit (think mango, banana, coconut) and cracked black pepper as well as an underlying mustiness. To say that the finish was dry would be to mark me as uttering the understatement of the year. The zephyr winds of the Sahara Desert blew through the back of my throat on the finish. Dry? Arid! Zounds. The spiciness just lingered in my mouth and I marveled that this had come out of a CAN. A KANsas CAN, no less. I would absolutely have some of this in the cooler on Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually) but it might be a bit much for the beach.","woodychandler","Dec 15, 2011"

A fairly approachable, drinkable selection for someone who isn't into Trappist beers, but the yeasty, fruity, grainy flavor is subdued and the body is a little awkward. Just ok...","znichols","Dec 12, 2011"
3.85,2.9,4,4,3.75,3.5,4,"Overall: Despite some minor issues with the hoppy, yet not dry, finish, this is a strong US-made Tripel, especially at the price point. And it comes in a Pint can!","bsp77","Dec 12, 2011"

This is an admirable take on the style, but can't quite stand up to the Belgian counterpart. The aroma is a little too messy and spicy, like a farmhouse ale. There's a light, crisp lemon note, but this beer is on the earthy side. The body is appropriately crisp, but the yeast character sends this into the realm of saisons.","tempest","Nov 19, 2011"

I found my self grabbing the second can before the first was gone and if discretion hadn't prevailed, a third would have been welcomed as well. Absolutely delicious- don't think twice about grabbing a four-pack. If this were sold in c&c'd 750's I'm sure I'd be buying this beer regularly at 10 bucks a bottle. As it is, it's an awesome bargain and one I won't be passing up often.","bwiechmann","Nov 12, 2011"

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste: Clean, supple, and smooth on the palate and down the throat. Fine and fruity, with light spice, tickly and prickly. Some soft-shoe on the tongue, a little buck and wing, and it's all deliciousness down the hatch after that. Creamy, and smooth, and, as we so often say, dangerously drinkable. Proceed with caution. Too tasty to stop at one, too fierce to go beyond two.","feloniousmonk","Nov 10, 2011"
4.53,21.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Pillowy white head sits atop a regal gold body of nectoar. Lacing is very full. Aroma is bready and lemony. A little spice and hay. Flavor is a little sourdough, some lemongrass, cakey yeastiness, pepper.... Really nice. I expect nothing less from this fine brewery. Highly drinkable and flavorful. Light medium body with a soft feel to it and alcohol presence is barely detectable. A winner.","Bighuge","Nov 04, 2011"
4.06,8.6,5,4,4,4,4,"There is some hype surrounding this beer. Not sure if it's because it's the first canned Tripel, but I think this beer is worthy of some hype because of the product inside.

4.46,19.3,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall: I really like this beer. It sort of feels like a working man's tripel. It is nice and sweet and has the flavors of a belgian-brewed tripel without the pricetag or the sometimes annoyingly high carbonation. I bet the absence of can-conditioning helps with the creamy mouthfeel of this beer compared to the prickly mouthfeel of other belgian style tripels.","ikenney87","0"
4.05,8.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall - absolutely incredible! I had no idea what to expect when I heard Tallgrass was canning a Belgian-style Tripel. This was a pretty big departure from their other offerings. I am very happy to say that they nailed it with this one. Velvet Rooster can strut proudly in a Belgian henhouse full of native varieties of this particular breed.","indiapaleale","0"
