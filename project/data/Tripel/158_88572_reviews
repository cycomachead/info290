"Just ok not that great!"
""
"Clean and refreshing--stunning as a Trippel. I detect no alcohol. Flowery sweet touch, it has the essence of a well made shanty. Light body with a high efferfescence. Certainly not a typical Trippel but I like this very much."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer to pair with food. However, as a standalone beer I much prefer less spices and a drier finish."
""
""
"Pale yellow appearance with pleasant smell of oranges and spices. Mild taste with the orange/citrus flavor predominant. Nice mouthfeel. Very tasty, but lacking the traditional Belgian flavor one would expect in a Belgian style ale. Still, very pleasant overall with no strong alcohol aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Very soft flavor of lemon bread with that nice citrusy sweetness. The ABV is very hidden. Spring beer for sure."
"Great Divide Orabelle. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass."
""
"I'll be back."
"Nice spicy tripel with a yeasty edge. You can feel the oats a big more than in Tripel Karmaliet, and the herbal notes are sharper than most from Belgium and there's certainly more malt character standing up. But I'd say it's an excellent American take on the style, varying only slightly, like Victory's Golden Monkey. Very satisfying, and the strength is well hidden. This is great beer."

"Pours a hazy lemon yellow with a scant head that falls fast.  Spongecake nose.  Spicy, herbal, lemony and sticky bread with honey.  .  Slight alcohol pepper and presence.  Taste is douhgy  and malty.  Tropical pineapple, apple skin.  Pineapple and pepper.  More sweet than tart with a substantial bitter to show off a lemony herbal.Slight warming in the dry finish.    At times it really doesnot drink or taste like a tripel. It's definitely american style.  They rye together with the lemony herbal and hops bitter is too much for the delicate tripel.  It drank heavy, a little syrupy, too much hop bitterness.  Heavy and slow malty finish."
"Poured a pretty, cloudy orange body with one finger of thick, fluffy white head that receded with medium speed. A good looking body, but not enough head for the style. Scents of spicy Belgian yeast imparting notes of clove, woody coriander and white pepper. Fruity esters are moderately high with apricot and orange aromas dominating, aided by the aroma of the orange peels added during fermentation. Soft, spicy alcohol is present in the background. Malt character is low, befitting a tripel, with a softly sweet character overall. A light perfume-like aroma, likely from hops, adds depth in the background. Overall this is a nicely true to form tripel. The aroma is fruity and spicy, as befits the style, but also quite deep and complex. A fine example of a basic tripel aroma. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with notes of soft, sweet sugar cookie-like malt and orange flesh fruity esters. This is backed by a light phenolic bitterness imparting flavors of white pepper, clove and coriander. Light soft alcohol flavors are also present. Middle picks up bitterness with further phenolic flavors, becoming more intense, but with the same mixture as above. To this is added a light orange zest character, light spicy hops and a slightly more intense alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of clove, white pepper, coriander at medium-high levels and medium levels of spicy hops, alongside soft, sweet alcohol and orange zest flavors at similar levels. A soft malt sweetness is present in the background. Aftertaste is bitter, with notes of spicy white pepper and clove and bitter spicy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather nice tripel, quite true to style with the mix of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors, backed by a soft, but not overwhelming sweetness. A good example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth creamy feel and medium-light carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is fairly on-point for the style, though carbonation is a bit too low. Overall this is a fairly good take on a Belgian Tripel. It is true to style in aroma and flavor, and mostly true in mouthfeel and is quite pleasant to drink. Its lower price relative to imported and high-end domestic tripels make up for its few shortcomings relative to those higher priced examples. A nice beer and a shame it's not year-round."
"Too much coriander on the nose, and the tongue, for my taste. Still pretty balanced and refreshing. Looks nice in the glass. Just not my style."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden hue about an inch of a head on it. It smells rich of fruit and  the fruity undertones stick with you all the way down. A very solid beer from a solid company and more than worth it for the price."
"TASTE: Smooth, grainy, soft, rustic bread, nutty yeast, fresh grass, pears, papayas, very warming, juicy, moderate hopping, orange peel, spice, dry finish"
"I've yet to taste an American brewer either nail this style or build on it in a unique way. Like New Belgium, it's just a rougher take with more hop after bite. Still worth a try, but their saison is better because it's a more forgiving style."
""
""
"The Verdict: Good beer. Very smooth, much lighter than I expected. Highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful golden cloudy beer. Nice spices. Easy pleasant drink. Whatever it strengths and weaknesses, the average out to a really fine drinkable tripel."
""
"Overall: A pretty good example of the style, though there are better easily available"
""
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
""
"Overall: it's ok but I've definately had better trippels from other American brewers. I probably wouldn't buy this one again but I will enjoy the rest of the six pack. No aging this one, drink fresh."
""
"Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"Not up to bar with the Belgians, and there are better local offerings (New Belgium Tripel), there's nothing obviously bad about Orabelle. It's just sort of middling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: While not up there with the best Belgian Tripels, I thought this was a very drinkable beer. I look forward to its release every year and always buy a couple of sixers."

"I tend to favor Belgium style beers so I love this one! I love the golden color and the slightly sweet, yet full-flavor that this beer offers. I found it very easy drinking, but you do have to be careful of the 8.3%, it will sneak up on you! I have tried a few other beers by Great Divide, so far they have not let me down."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer as a Belgian with a slight fruit edge. I did find it quite drinkable, which might be bad at 8.3%."
""
""
""
""
"A nice, somewhat subdued tripel, with hardly any indication of it being a big beer. Not as sweet or sugary as many other tripels--it even tastes a bit dry--but the mouthfeel and creaminess are solid. Also not as spicy, but the flavors are still appealing, with a hint of peppery taste. Cloudy color, with lots of head and decent retention. Very drinkable."
""
"O-A boring, run of the mill tripel that doesn't bring much to the table."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My beer guru brought this one over to split. Much murkier than the normal triple, and the smell and taste reminded me of a saison or a wit. Enjoyed the beer very much, I would consider this a strong saison that is really easy to drink which gives it big bonus points overall because of its ABV and drinkability. Certainly would drink this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Lou's Food Bar (delicious by the way). Hazy yellow, cloudy. Hints if Belgian yeast and spice in the aroma. Flavor is yeasty and yet subdued. Extremely easy to drink for the ABV. Overall, good but not worthy of a revisit. I'm still not sure if this is a different recipe than the triple they used to put in bottles."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is fairly rich. Overall a pleasant drink, just not a top Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Orabelle wasn't horrible, it does have that going for it. It doesn't feel like much of a tripel. Reading the label is seemed more like an amped up wit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: an alright American representation of the style - very full of spicy yeast. its a good mouthfeel, and harmonizes the flavors pretty well. as mentioned above, there is an odd flavor at the back of the tongue that is slightly off-putting - but does not kill the beer. i think this beer would benefit from some brett"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw gold with a short-lasting white head. Even though it doesn't hang around, there is still some nice lacing left on the glass. The aroma is everything you want from a tripel: citrusy, spicy, and grainy. There's a very nice thickness to this ale with a pleasant silky feeling. This is a great Belgian-style ale."
""
""
""
"This is a decent sipping beer, best enjoyed with a sharp, tangy cheese. I enjoyed it while reading on the front porch during a cool, midsummer day."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very drinkable for an 8.3% ABV. I need to remind myself while I am drinking this. I really enjoyed it. I definitely see myself purchasing more of it in the springtime. I can also see this as a great beer to help out those novice beer drinker that want to expand their beer palate from Blue Moon and Shock Top."
""
"Beer served on tap in a goblet glass. Lemon yellow color, cloudy almost like a hefeweizen. Thin head with good lacing. Aroma is faint, with distant smell of citrus and hops. Taste is great- slightly sweet, complex and just a hint of alcohol. I would definitely recommend this beer as it is a solid tripel with a wonderful flavor profile."

"Great Divide does a good job with every style they brew, and it shows in the feel, particularly in a well-made Belgian. This beer has the depth, a few layers on the palate, bright and crisp while rolling smoothly and imparting a softness without giving up firmness. A very, very slight stickiness coming out in the heft from the middle to end is one of very few things, but the most notable, keeping the score down."
""
"Overall this was a very nice Belgian beer."
"Very enjoyable after the first sip this hazy golden Belgian style ale serves up some nice features. Big white head forms fine even lacing, aromatics are pleasant with coriander soft not over done, a bit of orange peel brings nice citrus to the mix, with a spicy complex Belgian yeast character. Flavor spices give a nice complement to the citrus and bready yeast notes, nice biscuit malts pleasant even sweetness very balanced Belgian style ale by no means a classic tripel just a nice well made golden ale. Well hidden alcohol it's not even remotely alcoholic and weighs in at 8.3% abv, well played Great Divide this is when of their better Belgian style offerings yet. Mouthfeel, smooth creamy textures lingering spice character with the orange peel bitterness balance it out and dry the finish a good bit, carbonation not as effervescent as I would like but it's solid and carries the texture of the beer quite well. Overall I'm a fan I'm glad I gave Orabelle a shot."

"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Snifter. 2/18/14."
"O: This is tasty beer, but not $14-a-six-pack beer – file this under “glad I tried, but can’t afford to have regularly.” Apart from price, though, the palate was a little too mundane to catch my continued interest. Everything in this little bottle was on-point – the nose, the palate, the feel, the overall impression – but nothing ever jumped out as “great;” basically, this isn’t one for the record books, but you’d be hard-pressed to be disappointed in this beer."
""
"Overall- Good to really good beer. Pretty much in between. And though I've enjoyed many Great Divide beers, I was still surprised by this beer. Many cheaper tripels tend to be overwhelmingly phenolic while this is smooth and based on mild fruit esters. Definitely worth a try and something I will buy again."

"O: One of the better bodies on a triple in terms of carbonation, though it could have been better with a bit more substance. Taste is quite good. Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
"T: A unique and refreshing tripel. The 8.3% is hidden very well which is a nice quality. Overall, great Spring beer - a must try."
"Overall, I like the flavors and aroma of this beer, I do not like its finish and linger quality on the tongue. The wit/hefe/tripel type combo is interesting and tasty, biting quality in the finish does subside with some time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty decent Tripel, could be a bit crisper on the mouthfeel"
""
""

"12 oz bottle into pint glass. YES! Another Belgium style ale from Great Divide, which has quickly become my favorite brewery (Heyday, Nomad, Titan). This guy pours a strawish yellow gold with 10% orange added. Very opaque. Smooth on the tongue. Overall, best Belgian ale I've yet tried. Cheers!"
"Poured a pale, cloudy gold body with minimal head and lace. A airy aroma that is light and mostly citrusy and yeasty, although a touch of spice and sugariness seem to be in there. Beer is light bodied and smooth although it came across as more of a wit than triple at times. I say this because some of my sips were dominated by both a citric profile, bordering on orange with possible lemonzest, and spices like coriander. Couple with a sharp, crisp finish, and at times the beer didn't resemble a triple to me. That being said, there are hints of sweetness and other tropical fruits (pineapple) and it was enjoyable to sip on so I could care less of the designated title for this beer."

""
"* I tend to rate low, hopefully consistently"
""
"O-super beer that has many smells and flavors that seem to blend well together"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Do the coriander and orange peel need to be there? Probably not, but they don't hurt. A little rough, and as far as complexity goes, it ain't a rubix cube. Still, it drinks easily, and there's enough charm to warrant a closer look."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Orabelle’s cloudy golden orange color and frothy white head gave off whiffs of orange peel, Belgian yeast and fruitiness. The taste was very delicate yet deceptively deep with a good dose of Belgian yeast some light fruits and a spiciness that was perfectly in the Belgian Tripel realm. The light color and subtle flavors belittled it’s bold ambitions and held no hints of booze or alcohol. The Orabelle was a very smooth and solid Tripel."

"Orabelle pours a hazy orange color with a tiny head. The aroma has a strong citrus component over spices and yeast. The taste is a bit odd - I was excited when I saw rye on the label, but the rye here just doesn't work that well with the strong citrus, clashing and making the middle to finish section of the beer rather awkward. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and gently carbonated. The drinkability is alright, all things considered. Overall, Orabelle isn't that good a beer. It has promise, but falls apart pretty quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Pear, peach,faint coriander, orange peel. Dryish finish, a bit under-carbonated, flavor flattens out after sitting for a bit. A decent American offering."
""
""
""
"An enjoyable, fairly well done Tripel. Pleasant flavors, though nothing particularly exciting about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation should be upped."
""
"A good tripel that leans alittle too much into the wit side for me."
""
""
""
"O: Overall you can easily warm up to this, spicy, yeasty, and fruity while the 8.3% abv is easy to handle making this go down fairly easy inticing another. Mouthful could be a bit crisper. Flavor is respectable and the weak visual can be overlooked."
""
""
"D - a poor example of the style. I expect more from Great Divide. Takes a hit on drinkabiity due to the excessive alcohol presence. I'll pass on this in the future."
"O-Very, very complex. This is one of the better noses on a beer I've personally ever reviewed. Half of the nose transitions into the taste, where I pick up an array of new flavors. Great Divide does not brew a sub-par beer."
""
""
""
"Had on tap at the Corner Slice here in G-boro Thursday night.Poured a hazy lemony yellow with a tinge of orange,a sticky one finger white head atop that lasted for a good while.Aromas of ctirus,toasted cereal grain, white pepper,and mild phenols,all came together pretty well with the phenols not being over bearing.Lemony flavors along with white pepper spice up front on the palate followed by some toasted grain and a faint sharpness in the finish.A nice tripel not overly phenolic and the alcohol is subdued,well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very spicy Tripel. A lot of rye. Not a good representation of the style but it hides the alcohol quite well."
""
"Overall, this is fairly tasty and worth a try."
""
"I like this, and reminds me a bit of Golden Monkey. A very nice example of the style. One with some sweetness, but not overly so like so many other American versions can be. Something I would recommend."
"12oz bottle with freshness date clearly marked. Poured into a chalice, the ale is golden-tangerine color with a thin, white head that dissipates quickly. Full nose of banana, bready yeast, orange, spice, pear, apple, coriander, booze. Tastes are sweet with spice, plenty of banana & orange rind, yeast, wheat, booze is warming and a bit hot, finishes slightly dry and spicy from the rye. Mouth-feel is thin-medium body, with moderate carbonation. Overall, nice complexity & a good meld of flavors from all the ingredients."
""
""
"Pours a light hazy yellow with white collar of he's an heavy lacing. Nose has wavy belgo yeast character with lemon, grass and bread along with spicy notes. Taste is light and fruity with lemon peel and coriander to follow. Light peppery notes as well. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, decent flavors here, plenty of Belgian character."
""
""
"This is one of Great Divide better Belgian itterations, this works well for me; the ABV is well hidden"
""
"Nice new brew from great Divide and a nice Americanized version of the style. Well worth a try. Went nicely with some blue cheese. Looking forward to enjoying this on a summers day with some salads, crusty bread and a selection of cheeses."
""
"O: A very tasty beer. The aroma is excellent, and the flavors of the beer offer a nice mix of sweet and tart. Balanced and enjoyable, Orabelle is a fine food beer for roasted food in particular."
"O- I would love to see more six-pack tripels on the market. Flavor and aroma wise this is a really solid tripel, the mouthfeel is a little lighter and does linger on the palate. Some pleasant alcohol warming, but overall the alcohol is pretty well masked."

"O: solid offering from great divide, will buy again. 4+ stars."
""
""
""
"The taste is of Belgium, not Colorado. It's just right. Yeasty and fruity like the aroma. The aftertaste is sweet and a little dark. This isn't quite like some of the Belgians that will totally fool you - it is obvious this has some kick. I will need to remember the name - this is a good one."
""
"Overall: A pretty good American take on a Tripel. Good mix of yeast, spices, and fruit flavors. Well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up a six pack of this for about ten bucks. Nice to see something over 8% available in a sixer. Typical clean-looking Great Divide label on bottle; sillouhette of a girl aiming a bow and arrow, I'm guessing some kind of cupid-theme. Almost no head after pouring into a goblet. Cloudy, warm, butterscotch-yellow color is pleasing. Not sure if it's because I just said ""butterscotch"" but I'm detecting some of that in the nose, candy and alcohol, plus some yeast and maybe some light citrus. The flavor is good, and I get more of the citrus from it, orange for sure, and they do indicate on the side of the bottle it's brewed with orange peel. Alcohol taste is negligible. Mouthfeel is thick, nicely carbonated, and punchy, plus sort of a nice lightly bitter finish to balance - again I'm going to guess orange peels on that one. Overall, love this beer. Suprised to see the lower score when I signed in, but to each his own."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice attempt from the boys of Denver, but ill stick with other favorites. Still a decent beer though."
""
"Overall certainly worth a try as it is very mellow and a smooth drinking beer. Good introduction for some of the more extreme Belgian Tripels."
""
"Taste is strong and malty, but well-balanced. The orange comes through well before the double yeasts and coriander add a peppery note. Finishes with a little booziness. Definitely a sipper, but a fine and well-done tripel."
""
""
""
"O: This Tripel has an interesting taste. Kind of like a Belgian beer meets a Pilsner. The malt flavors are very complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A good tripel. ABV isn't too high and its not overly filling. Can't argue against the price point. The dry graininess is a little much for me."
""
"This is your typical American attempt at the style. It doesn't come close to the examples from overseas, but it's still an alright beer for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really good, but not as big and bold as alot of other tripels. Would be a great starter tripel , or for someone that cant handle the big flavors that a la fin du monde would provide. Solid and very easy to drink."
"Nice rich yellow color, small head, but it does leave some lacing. Smell is good: yeast, coriander, fruity, rye. Good flavor and very easy to drink for 8%. A bit heavier and maltier than a whit but similar in flavor. Full, plush mouthfeel. Complex malt profile. Spicy bite finish. Very enjoyable! First triple I've really liked."
"A pretty good craft tripel that I'll have to try again (but, not tonight)."
""
""
""
"Overall not something I would get all the time (especially at 3 dollars a pop) but a very smooth drinking triple. Kind of disappointed going in I expected an golden pale ale but it's still a great beer."
""
"The spicing is not over the top, but it is easily the most dominant combo of flavors and gives it a sweetness that the beer could have gotten by easily without. It tastes more like an imperial wit than a tripel with the orange peel and coriander. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy...fine carbonation feels great. I just don’t like it when the spice additions overpower the light grainy malt and Belgian yeast in a tripel...this one does it and it is definitely not subtle. I won’t be purchasing this one again...would rather grab a Golden Monkey if in the market for a $10 six pack tripel."
""
""
"O – A nice beer, haven't had many in this style, but this is a good drinker. Nice and refreshing, and hides the moderate ABV well. Great spring seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended, but I think GD could blend this one out better. I'm anxious to see if it changes next spring..."
"I enjoyed this beer. It wasn't a world class tripel but it held it's own. The fruity esters played the biggest role. The yeast was noticeable with it's spiciness as well. My biggest complaint with this one was the mouthfeel. I thought it could have been a bit fuller. I did however think the crispness stood up to the alcohol quite well. This is one beer I wouldn't mind having again."
""
"orabelle from great divide pours a very light cloudy straw yellow. the smellhas a very light citrus with a little touch of spices...but over all the smell is very weak. the taste is just the opposite, its very full, after such a weak smell i was surprised at how flavorful this beer is. this is a really good play on the belgian style. you can really taste the orange and the coriander. i hate to bring up bluemoon here, but if you like bluemoon, you should really try this and see how a real craft brewery does the orange coriander thing. this is one of the best ive had with this flavor combo."
""
""
"O: Orabelle is a pretty tasty, easy to like beer. Definitely drinkable."
"Inviting beer, terrific aroma, complex and bright but really doesn't do well after. Astringent finish and lack of substantial carbonation really make this beer sluggish. Good attempt, I don't know if they have the right yeast to pull this one off. I really wanted to like this one as Great Divide is usually solid, leave it on the shelf ."
"Overall: a nice Belgian-style beer, but with weak head and a style that is at most mid-way between a Belgian White and Belgian Tripel."
""
"This worked out to be an easy drinking tripel."
"Not as good as I wanted it to be. Ok flavors but every thing seemed dull. The very low carbonation didn't help either. Hades was the last Belgian style that this brewery did well."
"I was going to quick review this but I can't. Poured 12oz into goose island belgian chalice. This beer pours golden yellow, hazy, small white head. The smell is divine, banana, Belgian yeast, orange, coriander, hint of vanilla. Tastes as good as it smells, very refreshing, Belgian yeast, sweet orange and coriander, some lemon, and the texture is almost silky. It's like a more flavorful hefe. This beer is very very good, glad to see it on Ohio shelves."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's kind of a weird and distinct one, but it's still pretty solid and quite unique for a tripel."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light yellowish golden amber with a thin white head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malt, Belgian spicing, particularly coriander, light stone fruit. Flavor of stone fruit, Belgian yeast, coriander, clove, sweet malt. Medium body with some creaminess, good mouth feel. Flavors are a bit subdued for a tripel, but the flavor profile hits the style quite nicely. A pleasant domestic tripel."
""
"O - Superb! I always forget how amazing Great Divide is!"
"Overall: Really good American interpretation on a Belgian style Tripel. Great Divide doesn't get the same level of hype as some other craft breweries, but I've yet to have a beer from them that disappoints."
"Overall: this is not a bad beer, but I was a little disappointed. The label claims this is a tripel, but they've gone a lot further into witbier territory than I like to have in a tripel."
""
"overall- A lot of hop punks and beli snobs rated this beer way to low. I drink(and rate as my fav bev) a french canadian tripel all the time and this one is so close to it. Great Divide listen to my praises and keep making this beer, I LOVE IT!"
"O: Good, but would have liked a bit more body in this beer, given the different grains listed in it (wheat, rye, oats) Wonder what would have happened if a less efficient yeast went to work on this, or if I drank it a bit younger. If it tasted more like it smelled, this would be a go-to."
""
""
""
"O- This is about what I expected it to be. Very good but not amazing."
"RATHER NICE; SOLID SAMPLE!"
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with a slightly tart citrus fruit flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that quite tasty and a solid American take on the style."
""
""
""
"A note about the carbonation: I tried multiple bottles and experienced the same underwhelming carbonation with each bottle (from the same six-pack). The lack of carbonation doesn't kill this beer, but it does drag down the score a bit."
"O: This is a very interesting beer that I would gladly drink again. It's more of a Wit then it is a Tripel (though I suppose the two aren't too different), but it's still very tasty."
""
"Slightly foggy golden yellow color covered by a slim layer of milky suds. Spicy, fruity aroma...coriander, orange peel, banana, clove, flowers, and mild dough. Big, fruity esters burst forth in the mouth. Peppery phenols, citrus zest, some tart acidity, coriander spice, and a tangy-ness that I assume comes from the wheat. Only a little grain near the end, but all the bright, yeasty, spicy flavors overwhelm any malt (and I REALLY like to have some noticeable pale malt in my tripels to soften and balance things out). The finish is sweet, but nondescript. Medium bodied and low on carbonation, which hurts the drinkability, though a pleasant dryness helps. Not bad, far from the best."

"Another really good Belgian-style brew from Great Divide. They make so many good beers that don't involve bales of hops. From the 12 oz bottle brought to me from Denver. Label says ""Bottled on Dec 12 2012."""

"decent tripel style, but aside from the belgian yeti and maybe hades, i dont care for great divides forays into belgians. this one pours more clear than expected, but still with some suspended yeast, bright golden in color, more of a sexy blonde actually. a ton of bubbles build a tall white head. i smell corriander, and some bready floral yeast, like some kind of fruit muffin. theres some peppery element as well, more complex than i thought itd be, and less frilly than new belgiums tripel. flavor is yeast driven, without much citrus happening at all. its quite refreshing and its alcohol content is expertly disguised. erratic carbonation, like a sodapop, but a quick finish, feels like carbonated water. light body for a bigger brew alcohol wise, appropriate from early spring. not the best thing great divide has done, but i like it a whole lot better than that saison they did last year..."

"They had a tripel in bombers last year and it was pretty good but a little pricey. This is even better and at a very reasonable price. I'll definately be back for more."
"O: A well made American Tripel. The flavours are good, the mouthfeel could use a little work, but it's a minor quibble. All and all I enjoyed this effort."

"Overall- this is a tasty beer, I like the spice it is not over powering. I can have a few of these I still like Great Divides stronger darker offering much better. RUMBLEIPA!!!!"

"O: Wow this is a great beer! Extremely easy drinking for 8.3%, but it is not lacking taste either. One of the best triples I'v tried!"
"Finally! A Begian Style Tripel that does not break the bank. I have a bottle of La Trappe in the fridge, one of my favorite Tripels, but that set me back $12 for a bomber which is $6 for a glass of beer. Great for a special event, but where is the common man's Tripel? Dry Dock brews a good one, but it is still $6 for a bomber and not always available. New Belgium comes close with their Trippel, but it has a bit much coriander for my taste. So I jumped at the chance to try the Great Divide Orabelle when I saw the six pack in the beer cooler for $10. The color is a cloudy peach with a thin head and little carbonation. Belgian yeast and bready sweetness come through the aroma. So far so good. The flavor is big on apricot with a touch of honey. Very light pepper touches the finish to make for an outstanding Belgian Style Tripel. Thank you Great Divide! (The Great Divide Colette is worth a try as well....)"
"A tripel brewed with barley, wheat, oats, and rye, along with the other accoutrements of the style. Right on. It pours a hazy sunflower topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, orange zest, mango, Belgian yeast, light black pepper, and light cracked wheat. The taste holds notes of lemon zest, Belgian yeast, banana, clove, light black pepper, and light coriander. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, a very nice tripel, one that showcases a bit more in the way of fruitiness than spiciness and somehow makes it work."
