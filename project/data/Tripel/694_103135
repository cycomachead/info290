4.18,6.9,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Golden yellow with a heavy orange hue. Heavy haze with tons of yeasty floaties. Poured with a hug, dense white foam. Good head retention. Ripe, mellow orange citrus, over ripe apple and banana with peppery phenolics and smooth, sweet booziness at the end. Medium light floral hop aromas find their way through the myriad of belgian aromas. Medium bodied with soft yet effervescent carbonation. Light creaminess following the carbination near the finish along with pleasant boozy warmth. Banana and ripe apple flavors followed by coriander and medium light hop bitterness. Mellow, malty, boozy sweetness at the end. Finished medium dry with a brief lingering bittness. Overall a very drinkable, complex beer. Balance tilted toward fruity esters in the aroma and toward spicy phenolics in the flavor with a pleasant, warm, sweet boozines. Cheers. Love Troegs!","IronLover","Mar 11, 2015"

3.83,-2,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,"i like this beer a lot, it has a couple of cool things going for it. one is that its a cool sort of hybrid on the yeast front, with elements of the classic belgian strains and all their fruity intensity, and also saison yeast, more funky and spicy, and super super dry. the other thing is that seems to be a rather authentic take on the style, blonde and bubbly, grain and yeast driven, delicate for its size, all of that, but instead of being candy sugar sweet in the finish, its very very dry. the rapid fire carbonation helps that along too, but there isnt much sweetness left here in this tripel, a really nice feature. its also pretty light in body for what it is, and at 8% av instead of say 11% abv, i can easily have a few of them. well done by troegs here, this exceeded expectations.","StonedTrippin","Oct 03, 2014"

4.26,9,5,4,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/26/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Outstanding and spot on appearance. Aromas of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Sizable yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 17, 2014"

Smells of banana, and sweet baked bread with an herbal astringency coming through on the nose. Hops are a bit up front with nice malt background and excellent carbonated mouth feel from the yeast with an open fermentation taste that is not overly sour or Flemish. Pears, apples, and sweet bread, excellent flavor profile that keeps improving with each sip. Light hop character and sweet Belgian candy sugar on the aftertaste. Very nice from one of my favorite brewers.","Brutaltruth","May 24, 2014"

3.3,-15.6,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25," The beer is clear and golden with a small white head. You aroma brings alcohol, oranges, spice, coriander. Too sweet with prominent alcohol. Woo...ouch. Hold up. I've the top. A bit much on the booze. Too sweet and boozy. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, eh...","Huhzubendah","Oct 31, 2013"

I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to truly appreciate this beer for what it is, as I think I’ll always wish it was the Splinter Gold and not just a triple.","taylor714914","Oct 31, 2013"

Personally I'd like to see the sweetness dialed up slightly... That would go a long way in taking this brew to the next level... Slightly less than the sum of its parts, but I'll gladly revisit, recommend, and support this excellent brew from my local brewery...","philbe311","Oct 28, 2013"

3.93,0.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,"This is a medium bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation that seems so over-done that it imparts a carbonic/mineral feel in both the aroma and flavor. This beer has some real potential and depth of character, it is just real rough around the edges. The alcohol is not hiding at all, even at lower than ideal serving temperature. Regardless, this is a very pleasant and interesting offering from Troegs. This might be the most exaggerated example of a beer that I downright disliked at first and grew on me to the point where I was ready to open a second bottle. You really gotta let this one breath to enjoy it though.","stakem","Oct 27, 2013"
