3.85,-10,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Floral smell as it's being poured with a lot of small bubbles resembling soap suds, even with a slightly slow pour. Very effervescent mouthfeel like champagne, accompanied by a fruity flavor I recall from other tripels (I'm not overly familiar with this style). A bit of dryness in the back of the tongue after swallowing with a tart flavor which gives way to a subtle bourbon flavor. Nice complexity to this beer and overall enjoyable but a bit too much of the dryness in my opinion.","ctjoumas","Friday at 02:38 PM"

Taste is on point of the tripel style, smooth up front taste of vanilla, coconut and light hints of the bourbon oak aging that follow through on the back end of the palate. Overall a delicate and fine tripel, however I wouldn't go out of my way to pay $18 a bottle again. I was once in love with the tripel style, but think I am more so a fan of strong belgian golds and darks now.","hp2skater","Mar 27, 2015"

The flavour is where this brew really hits home for me. It has all the qualities of a Tripel but with some extra refinement. Perhaps this is where the barrel aging pays dividence. The usual notes are balanced by a sweetness and only the sligthest notes of a barrel finish are present. This brew is silky smooth and hides it's abv dangerously well.","byronic","Mar 09, 2015"

It has a sweetness to it that's followed by somewhat of a creamy finish, but after you've swallowed it, it has oaky notes that make you think you just had a sip of scotch.

You can smell hints of bourbon whiskey.  Definitely not Kentucky straight bourbon which makes this fall flat.  Tastes like a water downed Lynchburg Lemonade. I have a head cold though. Not picking up much other than mild, and just nasty in my book, Jim Beam.  Had to chug a bottle of it to be initiated into my fraternity.  Bringing back bad memories.  Mild and drinkable. Smooth almost clean finish.  Abv isn't noticeable although it is a big 11.0%.  Curieux is really thin.  Probably good on a hot summer day.  Not particularly exciting on a cold rainy winter day.  I only taste a hint of vanilla or coconut (but I do have a head cold).  Grew on me more as I finished the glass or maybe that was just the ABV kicking in.  I'll revisit later.","uvachief","Jan 23, 2015"

What is already a solid tripel in it's own right is made better by the barrel aging. The bourbon flavors are there but take a nice subtle backseat approach.

What the hell, I may as well ruin everyone's weekend and drink it tonight.  Wow, the smell is overpowering.  A bit of an orangish intro as you drink it, but there is a bit of an odd odor.  Maybe this is too old now.  Great soothing that though - can see this being great on a cold night.  Very yeasty bomb that is nice, but not sure I get a ton of bourbon out of this.  11% bit too much for me.  I love Allagash, but this isn't for me.","BradMacMullin","Oct 11, 2014"

The beer is more well balanced with the bourbon, I would never complain about Curieux it's one if my favorite beers and a local classic.  But compared to the 2011, it was sweeter and more pronounced.  The qualities of the triple and the bourbon are well blended to form a real classic.","Jeffreychason","Oct 01, 2014"

Smell: Bourbon, wet hay, spicy, honey graham crackers, faint alcohol, subtle flowers. Taste: Like the aroma yet much richer. Vanilla, subtle hints of coconut, nice fruity pear esters shine through the overall bourbon characteristics, nice hints of flowers in there with a honey wheat bread sweetness, no alcohol heat or flavor is detected, lemon zest in there as well, there is a nice bitter bite to it as well. Feel: Medium-full body, tight active carbonation. Overall: Man, this ale is a hit for me. 11% ABV is not even a presence in the flavor, very devilishly. The malt sweetness gives a little to let you know it is a big beer. I’m very impressed on how flavorful this ale is and yet it is delicate at the same time. A lovely combo Balanced and Dangerous! The bourbon isn’t overdone and the Tripel components are just right. This brew is Recommended!","Shroud0fdoom","Jun 07, 2014"

I do not know the ratio of how much they blend the fresh triple with the barrel aged tripel but being that the bourbon/vanilla/aged characteristics are so subtle I would say a majority of this beer is the fresh tripel. Not complaining at all because I really enjoy this beer. I will have to grab this years and see how it taste.","mikem0487","Mar 08, 2014"

Not off-putting, just unusual. Certainly an interesting brew. A lot going on, though I must say, I would prefer any of the better tripel beers to this. While the barrel-aging is well executed, I don't believe it adds to a beer of this ilk. There are some flavors that just naturally clash, and perhaps bourbon and tripels were not meant to be united.

3.6,-15.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Really gorgeous beer. Golden straw color, small tight bubbles, wonderful creamy pillowy head that staid around for quite a while. The nose is sweet malts, banana, coriander, maybe some grapes and white wine - definitely sweet. Sadly no discernible or strong barrel characters in the nose and similar in the taste. Similar to the nose with some faint oak, but definitely sweet malts and spicy belgian yeasts, faint tart like lemon rind - would never have guessed it was 11%. Very tight carbonation but moderate feel for such a sweet beer goes down easy and dry. All in all this was a fantastic tripel but the consensus was that as there was little apparent barrel character it was somewhat disappointing. If the price point was lower I would definitely try again.","jwchestnut","Feb 21, 2014"

Not the beer's fault by any means, and in fairness, my expectations didn't come from anywhere other than excitement at the uniqueness of this take on the style. Would be curious to try it again with less age, or another barrel-aged tripel, just to see how they compare.","LambicPentameter","Feb 17, 2014"

Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a tall fluffy white head. Not a lot of aroma to speak of, some sweet pears, banana, honey, yeast, and a hint of bourbon for sure. Heavy oak up front flavor with some light vanilla and coconut. This fades into honey and light sweet fruits and banana midpalate and down the throat and leaves an oaky vanilla honey flavor on the palate for a while. Slick palate with adequate carbonation. On the heavy side for the style as expected to stand up to bourbon barrels. Overall this was an interesting treat but I don't think I would go for it again. I don't really get the big love for this one.","BMMillsy","Jan 31, 2014"

4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,"the original and best version of this style, and when I revisit it, I am always reminded why its so popular, highly acclaimed, and darn tasty. it pours a opaque bright golden color with as much head as you care to stir up. bone white and permanent. it smells really strongly of vanilla, intense bourbon whiskey notes, wheat malt, Belgian yeast, fresh oak, and warming alcohol. there are subtle floral notes from the yeast in the taste, elegant and lively, while the sweetness of the vanilla brings out the best of the cereal malts. bourbon is obvious, its familiar too, and the barrel just brings it all together. I don't taste booze at all, which shocks me at 11% abv. it drinks just way too easy. carbonated very effervescently, this beer simply dances on the palate. usually tripels are sweeter than I like, but this one comes out just right on the sugar scale. complex doesn't begin to describe curieux, which has to be up there with allagashs best work. this is one of those beers that every serious beer drinker needs to try in their lifetime.","StonedTrippin","Aug 21, 2013"
3.99,-6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.25,4.25,"Found this randomly at a local grocery store and was beckoned to try it by the gleaming reviews it received on here. This is also my first brew from Allagash. First thing that surprised me was how light, and transparent it is. I was expecting something heavier and darker. But it gleams a bright off-golden with thin head. It is a great looking beer, and in a wide mouth glass it seems to glow as light refracts through the almost entirely translucent liquid. The next thing that surprised me was the smell. It was actually rather muted, and not the full force wave of smells that accompanies most barrel aged, heavy duty brews. This was light, mildly sweet, with notes of wheat and mild citrus. The taste is absolutely great, and wonderfully smooth. It starts with some fresh fruits like banana and orange and finishes with oats and mild hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, and very refreshing. No booze despite the 11%, but a nice warming feeling ensues. Wonderful beer, but a tad pricey if honest.","Samuel906","Aug 20, 2013"

The beer as a whole is very well balanced between fruits and smoky, spicy alcohols, and is definitely in a class of its own, as opposed to the dozens of Tripels that seem like clones of each other in comparison. Well worth trying.","jondeelee","Jul 26, 2013"

I can see how the barrel has imparted some subtleties that have complimented the base beer well. Quite a nice and complex beer with lot's to keep you thinking about it and an ABV forcing you to take your time with it. I noticed myself drinking this way too quickly for its ABV, which isn't always a bad thing. Well done.","tbeckett","Jul 14, 2013"

Nose of grain and sweetness, with a heavy bourbon overlay. There is spicing that helps to cut the richness in the aromas. Flavors of bourbon initially, with booze and warmth, followed by a toasted grain backbone, honey and vanilla sweetness, and subtle earthiness. Smooth and surprisingly light in body, there is a boozy and rich aftertaste with a slick, slow lingering finish. Wow!","GarthDanielson","Jun 10, 2013"

Got some sweet fruit and sugariness out of the aroma too but not much woodiness or bourbon. Taste is the same as the barrel aging helps out in the mouthfeel with some smoothness and the bourbon notes are quiet but add some heat on the back but not overpowering. More of a traditional tripel in regards to taste with a solid balance of some tropical fruits like orange peel and banana, some sweetness from sugary malts and possibly tropical fruit and touches of spice thanks to some clove and even a slight sourness (I swear I got a taste of sour apple). Not a traditional tripel in the strictest sense but the addition of bourbon barrel aging is a nice complement to the brew and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer.","clayrock81","May 16, 2013"

I think this makes sense because it would probably overpower the crisp and yeasty flavors of the tripel (like a Jackie-O's Kentucky Monk). Having said all of that, it shouldn't be surprising because the base beer is my favorite tripel of all time (I gave it a 4.45 but that was before quarter-point scores). Honestly I'm not sure if this an improvement or not. It's different for sure, but noticeably heavier and boozier. Definitely more complex, but loses some of the crispness that really makes the base beer wonderful. Close call. Allagash definitely has the market on tripels locked down though, nothing else comes close in my opinion.","Dope","Feb 01, 2013"

Mouthfeel is nice. Medium-bodied, wet, and with just the slightest bite of carbonation at the finish. I get the bubble gum right away. There's a bit of tartness, but it is very mild. Everything about the flavor of this beer is mild. I know it's been aged in bourbon barrels, but I get a hint of Chardonnay. It finishes with a very pleasant oaky vanilla. Very good trippel.","DocJitsu","Jan 18, 2013"

It rests in the middle with the mouthfeel gravity and character of a fat balloon and classic Tripel taste with added unique dimensions.

4.97,16.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"The label on the brew said that this was from the October 2010 batch and 750 cases were bottled. The brew poured with a one finger white head into my Rogue chalice. Every time I use these glasses, I think that are darn heavy. Anyways, the head dissipated and didn’t leave any lacing on the glass. The color is a light yellow with a hint of orange and presents with moderate carbonation. The body is clear. On the nose, I got a lot of bready and yeasty notes. Then, I get some golden fruit and sugars. I don’t smell much of the oak that I thought I would from being aged in bourbon barrels. On the taste, the first thing I say is, “Damn, this is a good beer.” There is a lot going on with this. There is a definite wood/vanilla characteristic, then the fruit, then some breadiness and spices. The alcohol, which is hefty at 11%, really only makes itself known on the finish, when it really warms the throat. There is light carbonation on this brew, which is perfect. The brew itself is lighter than I thought and not really syrupy. I love this brew.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

Although this is not a style I have seen Bourbon barrel aged before, I was very impressed with how well the barrel and tripel flavors melded. I am not one who believes that anything you throw in a bourbon barrel will come out better, but this one works on every level. I will seek out some bottles now that I know it is worth the price. This is probably the best Allagash beer I have tasted.","NoLeafClover44","Jul 26, 2012"

Smell is huge clove, banana, musk, and some fig. The taste is wow, much more aggressive with clove and a big tickle of bourbon. Body is medium, enought carbonation for its large size, not overly dry for me, and drinkable enough and this isn't my favorite style at all. This is an excellent beer, especially if Belgians are your thing. I prefer Hoppy beers, but this is well done even so.","SawDog505","Jun 19, 2012"
4.59,7.2,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A beauitful triple full of flavor and packs a nice punch. This beer starts off with a strong carmel taste with a hint of the alochol which settles in as you drink it. Has a great yeast taste to finish off which does not overpower the Carmel taste but really helps enhance it. I am in love with this beer for its amazing taste and feel all whole hitting me with that 11% abv. Also goes very well with dessert or any sweet meal.","VillageThief","Jun 19, 2012"
4.12,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a darkish amber with an intensely fluffy white head. There is definitely sediment, but it could be poured off after a year of aging/settling. The beer was served relatively warm which produces a sweet, yet tart bourbon nose and plenty of yeastiness. It drinks very easily and you forget (almost instantly) that this bubbly, champagne-like tripel is 11%abv... The bourbon is well masked and the beer is easily consumed. Very tasty beverage that's worth trying is you like Belgian style and wood aged beers.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 18, 2012"

3.55,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The glass of four year old Curieux I'm brought contains liquid that's a bright golden to lemon yellow, with just a bit of visibility through it. There's just a tiny bit of white foam (due somewhat to the pour), and as a result not much in the way of lacing or head retention. The nose is heavy on vanilla soaked pale fruits, with bourbon and oak playing supporting roles (and the former shining through more than the latter). I'm surprised not to find any clove or pepper aromas anywhere. The flavor brings more of the same. Sweetened fruitiness opens the beer, and a bourbon presence that's a bit more prominent/aggresssive than in the aroma cuts though mid palate, before a subtle woodiness closes the beer out. Once again I'm somewhat let down by the lack of yeasty phenols, as they are somewhat standard for the style. For a beer that's firmly in the double digit ABV territory, it's got an impressive lightness of body. The carbonation is just a tad dull, but it's a minor issue. As a pure drinking experience I enjoyed Curieux a bit more than the score here would indicate, but looking at it as a triple I can't grade it too highly when it's missing one of the hallmark characteristics of the style.","axeman9182","Oct 19, 2011"

I opened the bottle and gave it a pour, it comes out as a hazy yellowish gold color with a white head on top. Gave the brew a good noseful and got mostly a sour aroma to it. Perhaps it's from the Oak barrels, thats fine I was expecting a sweet vanilla aroma from the Bourbon or something but it smelled more like a sour tripel than anything else. The taste was basically the same way, Mostly had a tart flavor to it and virtually no Bourbon flavors that I could pick up at all. The mouthfeel was decent, it had a good feel to it and it was still drinkable. Overall I was just a little bummed about this brew to say the least. I was hoping it would have been a bit different than it was. I haveanother bottle that I'm hanging on to, one day I'll have it again.","Knapp85","Oct 05, 2011"

Aromas of big lemon, clove, banana, pepper, citrus peel, honey-like sweetness, white grape, oak, and bourbon. Surprisingly no real booziness was noticed, and there is a great amount of complexity going on here. Taste of tons of oak, lemon, clove, banana, vanilla, bourbon, white grape, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of of mainly bourbon, oak, and vanilla; with a bit of pepper, light fruits, and spices as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a decent slightly prickly mouthfeel that is still very smooth. No alcohol noticed other than a warming on the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged tripel. I would definitely like to try a fresher bottle of this because I hear it is even better while it is younger.","superspak","Oct 02, 2011"

There is an alcohol warmth in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. A medium bodied feel as well.

Great head which dissipates slowly. Wonderful aroma - vanilla, bourbon - but not too much. The taste is fantastic. Some bourbon barrel aged brews are too heavy on the bourbon taste for me - this one gets it perfectly. This may be the first Tripel style that I have tasted that was bourbon aged. Wonderful combination in my opinion. A fantastic sipper - a little pricey, but worth it. I'm going to have to go back and buy a few more. I'm guessing this will be even better with time.

As for taste, it starts off sweet and creamy, with the carbonation dancing on my tongue. The finish is more tart, crisp, and dry. Lots of ripe fruit flavors are detectable, as is the wood flavor from the aging process. There is a little alcohol burn with this beer, though not as much as other beers in the 10+ ABV range.

Allagash Curieux is a unique beer that was aged for 8 weeks in Jim Beam Bourbon Barrels. Allagash brews a batch of the Triple and placed it in Bourbon barrels from Kentucky. There are only 750 cases bottled. This beer gave off a dark amber golden color which I found suprising as I expected a darker appearance. I could smell the bourbon and Belgian yeast at first whiff. Mouthability showed a well-made medium body with ongoing carbonation. Drinkability was smooth and enjoyed picking up oaky flavors of bourbon. This is a very dangerous beer as I didn't realize I was drinking a 22% beer so the alcohol is masked extremely well. I rarely drink bourbon barrel aged beer, so this was a very nice and special treat that I shared with a buddy. I would have this style again to wither away my sorrows or for a nice drink to accompany my cigars with friends on a cold night. I'd definitely be a buyer of this type of beer as it would be an excellent cellar beer to have for the holidays, celebrations, and what have you.","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

I was wondering how bourbon would meld into a tripel and found out it does quite well. The fruity, vinous qualities of the tripel is complimented by the hint of bourbon. The bourbon is not as strong in the flavor and that allows the base ale to really shine. Flavor features fruit such as pears, apples, and grapes. Some spice such as cloves and pepper. The alcohol flavor and warmth is a little too prominent to garner a perfect score. I would of liked a little more body to help carry the flavors and alcohol but has nearly perfect carbonation. Just about nearly perfect in all categories. The high ABV limits drinkability, a true sipper.","morimech","Oct 31, 2010"

Coats my mouth with a syrupy texture. Oaky vanilla, butterscotch, and orange peel. Not as heavy as the malty aroma suggests but still very big. Bitter, slightly hoppy gives it a cleaner impression overall, aiding drinkability. Only slightly less drinkable than other tripels.

The taste follows this same path (I mean, it's already been bushwhacked and whatnot), with the added company of coriander and a light whiskey. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this time 'round things went much better.

The sourness of the oak combined with the booze from the bourbon are quite intense and cover any tripel flavor that might be there. I really don't taste the Belgian yeast at all.

4.13,-3.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: One needs to follow the instructions... Early on I made the mistake of having the brew slightly cold and it sure does not offer half of the complexities that it reaches when it warms up to cellar or room temperature. Enjoyed in those conditions the subtle range emerges nicely and makes for quite a brilliant beer experience, otherwise one misses the richness of the brew. In fact I ended up switching from a tulip glass, which was fine, to a medium size snifter to finish it off. Not being a huge fan of tripels, in particular of some acidity found for me with some of the spicy ranges, this one coats with toffee and caramel notes a part of it, which rounds it up perfectly in my case.","Daniellobo","Apr 11, 2010"
3.38,-21,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Tap, City Beer Store. Beer pours a hazy but bright golden color with a nice white head that sticks around well. The aroma is milder than expected. There are some light stone fruit and caramel malt notes. The oak note is one of the best parts but a bit too refined not to get pushed out of the way more than I'd liked. It also seems somewhat vinous, though it's a bit hard to tell under the bourbon. The bourbon is fairly harsh and there's too much alcohol heat. The booze really hits in the flavor. I think that I might like the base beer and I might like an aged bottle/keg, but this is too harsh for me fresh.","popery","Apr 09, 2010"

4.25,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Reviewed from my tasting notes. Served in a 10 ounce tulip at the Great Lost Bear. The beer has a hazy, opaque golden color. There is a thin white soapy head. It looks very pretty in this glass. It has a magnificent bourbon and Belgian yeast aroma with notes of oak. It's both sweet and spicy. Flavors I can identify include candy sugar and citrus. There is alcohol and bourbon in the finish that lingers. There is a great balance of triple and bourbon qualities. I've had other cask pours of this beer that were very hot, but this is smooth and excellent; very little burn. It has low levels of carbonation, a lot of coating and a heavy body. It's all together highly drinkable. It is strong and bourbony, but oh so good. There is just enough sweet to counteract any burning sensations from the alcohol. I have and will continue to drink this beer, especially when it is available in a cask.","ToasterChef","Apr 01, 2010"

Bourbon, vanilla, pears, apples and a bit of funk on the nose. Taking a sip, I get some sweetness, along with more bourbon, apples, pears and wood.

It tasted like sweet malts, some vanilla, light hops. In contrast, the 2007 had way more of a whopping smell and taste of bourbon. It tasted like honey, bitter hops and bourbon! All in all the 2009 was again, a lighter beer in comparison to the aged 2007.

Kinda resembles Mischief from The Bruery or Le Merle from North Coast. Bright yet murky. Kinda like a candle glowing in the middle of the glass. I can't say I don't taste the alcohol though.

Taste is strange, I wasn't sure what to think at first but found myself very intrigued and liking it more and more with every sip. Huge on syrupy bourbon, fruit, peppery yeast, medicinal notes. Mouthfeel is very thick, creamy, like I said before syrupy. Obviously with a 11% bourbon barrel aged beer it's alcohol city, but that being said it's definitely not as hard to drink as it could be.

I'm sure it could still hold up, but what seems to be the case -- or what I can gather from at least imagining a fresh bottle -- is that the bourbon, obviously, has held up the most, while the more fruit ester flavors of the Tripel style haven't dissipated as much as they've integrated themselves into the wood and barrel and bourbon flavors. So this is what it comes down to. If you're a fan of bourbon, after five years you're going to love this. If you're not, well, I'm not sure how much of a fan you're going to be.

One large arc of lacing coated half of the bowl, with random splatters of lacing adhering to the opposite side. Nose was somewhat mellow - tangerines with a hint of booze and a kiss of bourbon. Taste is buttery upfront, some mild spice in the middle and oak tannins towards the end. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with quite a bit going on - a little prickly towards the front with a creamy texture that coats the tongue and some alcohol heat culminating at the back, with a consistent background carbonation from start to finish.

The smell was good but not over powering with some citrus, honey or molasses and, hints of the wood coming through. The first sip pf this was immediately good. Great balance of flavors, carbonation, aromatics, full bodied (wheaty) which all mask the fact that the beer has a high alcohol content.

The first thing to hit from the taste was belgian yeast followed by candi sugar. No harsh coriander notes in this tripel. The finish was of sugared fruit but not obnoxiously cloying as some overly candi-sugared tripels end up.

Banana and citrus. Expected spiciness from the typical tripel yeast. Tastes of sweet, grainy malt, yeasty light fruit, and strong bourbon. It's surprising how much the whiskey comes through. Some oakiness and spice there as well. For me, the bourbon character doesn't work well at all with the flavor of a tripel. Between the dijointed flavors and the high ABV, this one doesn't drink very easily.","philipquarles","Aug 17, 2009"

Not many markings on the glass. And its aroma comes at you like a tidal wave of apples and bourbon. Anyone say christmas cider? Tasting it is not as good as smelling it as a bitterness to the beer seeps in. There is an apple cider taste to it up front with a sharp alcohol taste going down. Not a bad taste but still there. As it finishes though in your mouth you detect why it's bitter and the oak and bourbon really come through leaving nothing but good feelings on your taste buds. This is a very drinkable beer as it is a medium bodied even keel beer all around. Can't wait to taste the second in the series.","bilyboy65","Jun 23, 2009"

This beer is a solid triple, well made and the aged on it just makes it shoot through the roof. I am so surprised on how incredibly creamy, rich, and peppery the beer is. I never was much a fan of the triple style but when I tried the some of the better ones, I became a fan. This is no exception. A very, very good beer.

I guess my only problems with this beer is the lack of citrus flavor and the price. Since it's a barrel aged beer, I can give Allagash some leverage on the high price, but not so much on the lack of citrus fruits. Would I ever buy this beer again? That's a difficult question to answer right now. I might and I may not. Is it worth a shot? It can be if you got the money.","AltBock","May 02, 2009"

Would go fantastic with bleu cheese and walnuts. Drinkability is down slightly only because of the high abv, which should by no means deter you from taking this one on.

The 11% abv is really well hidden and the sweetness is nicely muted by the barrels. Warms the throat. A little fiesty as it goes down, overall a great beer, definitely worth the 10 bucks!","Bowdoinbeerboy","Nov 30, 2008"
3.9,-8.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The barrel aging gave the tripel a little bit more of a kick than I thought it would. It also tasted more spiced than I expected, it almost tasted like this year's Fluxus with a bit of a bourbon alcoholic bite to it. Overall, a far more complex profile than the standard tripel. As the beer got warmer, it definitely opened up, the spice became a little less overbearing and complemented the sweet tripel. On the other hand, Fluxus at this temperature was undrinkable for me. The bourbon taste was all up front on my palate, but mellowed as the beer warmed. I was enjoying this more a half hour after opening, rather than 10 minutes out of the fridge at opening. Average carbonation, which fits the character of the beer perfectly as a slow sipper. Drinkability improved as it warmed, and while the alcohol taste is pretty mellow (as the bourbon aging helps smooth over the sweetness of the belgian style), it's most definitely a sipper.","damienblack","Nov 27, 2008"

The scent turned out to be a great indication of the taste and overall mouth feel. It has a sweet mild smell of alcohol. The flavor is just so gentle. A nice medium body with some sweetness. You can sort of tell the alcohol is present but it really does not hit until the end of the sip when a slight woody bourbon flavor kicks in. Just a terrific smooth warmer.","gearbike","Nov 27, 2008"

4.03,-5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a glorious, rich golden color with one of the most impressive heads that I have ever seen on an American Tripel. I say American because it does not have that traditional rocky head that Belgains do. But because it is Allagash I'm certain they want this head the way it is. The smell is heavily of sugar, oak, and bourbon. The taste is the same. The bourbon is very noticeable and very warming. I'm not a big fan of bourbon so I usually don't enjoy the bourbon-aged beers as much as others do, but the Curieux delivers the flavors in such a balanced way that I am enjoying this bourbon-aged beer very much. Pretty damn good shit.","Douglas14","Nov 10, 2008"

Tropical fruit and alcohol with a mild yet appealing bourbon character of whiskey and vanilla. Belgian yeast mustiness is also appealing and rather subdued. Taste when colder is of refreshing tropical fruit and vanilla. Taste as it warms is more musty yeast, bourbon whiskey, and warming almost hot alcohol.

On the palate, however, things develop. Flavors of strong oak hit you hard first, followed by vanilla, spicy phenolics, and a little citrus. The cask conditioning makes things a bit muddy, with a bright citrus tripel clashing with the strong oaky and bourbon flavors. The mouthfeel is heavy with low to minimal carbonation.

A little bit of alcohol warming is evident on the finish, but buy no means overwhelming or solvent-like. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, bordering on sticky mouthfeel but the carbonation helps make this one more drinkable than it might otherwise be. Tasty and complex.

Becomes velvety smooth, dry and woody, with a huge rounded alcohol presence in the finish. Strong enough to numb the throat and warm the stomach. The beer feels light and a slightly fizzy at first, but this changes to a warm and creamy smoothness as the alcohol takes hold. A very good sipping beer for a cold winter night.

Not much in the way of oak flavors here, but based on my recollection, this came across a lot smoother than the Tripel. The alcohol was well hidden except for the warmth.

The mouthfeel is very thin, and that's not normally a plus for me, but the experience is bolstered by that intense alcohol presence and the oak, so I'd call it ""delicate but earthy.""

Golden peach with a respectable topping of slightly greying white froth that quickly fades to a thin skimming layer and ring. Estery aromas of tart apple cider, Chardonnay-esque buttery green grape skins, and really only the faintest whiff of Kentucky's finest. But that bourbon is certainly not missing from the taste. Atop the sugary pineapple nectar and grape-apple-melon fruit melange so welcome in the best tripels rides an almost regal oaky bourbon flavor, with alcohol vapor spirit breath lashing the palate toward a powerfully whiskey-laced finish. Pleasant phenolic banana-pineapple notes in the aftertaste. Light and airy, just like a tripel ought to feel, with, of course, a very deceptive alcohol content. Eminently drinkable in my estimation. Now, what one thinks of this beer will depend quite a lot on one's feelings about bourbon. In the example at hand, the latter will sneak up on the drinker who doesn't expect it, but those who enjoy and appreciate significant bourbon/whiskey flavors in their beer (like myself) will find much to admire in Allagash's Curieux.","orfeu","May 19, 2007"

The smell was very heavy on the oaked bourbon from the barrell. It was so dominant that no other smells really came to the front. The taste followed suit and it made me think of a bourbon and water more than a beer. This barrell trend is really hot right now and I've seen it done well where it adds some new flavor to the beer but this one barely shows any of the beer.

For a bourbon barrel-aged tripel, this beer doesn't really exhibit the aroma of bourbon barrel aging. Taste is alcoholic and sweet, but not overly flavorful at first. However, the flavor does improve as the beer is consumed. But, I wasn't blown away by the flavor as I expected. As with smell, the bourbon-barrel characteristics are not present in the taste of this beer. Flavors typically associated with a Belgian Tripel are present and in this respect this beer reminds me of one of the Unibroue Special Editon series. Mouthfeel is warming and alcoholic; carbonation is crisp.

It is also quite tropical on the palate, with orange, pineapple, peach, melon rind, and banana, along with notes of wheat, green hops, yeast, vanilla, oak, and a peppery character.

Just a little boozy too. Likewise, the flavour was heavy on the fruit, very tropical, with plenty of papaya and tart pineapple. Notes of vanilla swam in and out of focus, and oak was prominent, along with a woody alcohol warmth reminiscent of finer whiskeys. Although it was quite sweet, there was a solid bitterness underneath it all. Full bodied and palate coating, it didn't quite end up sticky.

But you get used to it and it seems to disappear (or I might just be getting drunk) and then I can see some traces of a nice abbey tripel with a strong yeast profile, which provide a farmhouse side that I really enjoyed. Overall, probably not something I would go for on a regular basis but I still enjoyed. If I was to rate on experiment alone though, I would have rated this much higher since I appreciated the fact that Allagash tried to do something different.","Phyl21ca","Feb 02, 2006"

The smell right away was full of vanilla alchohol and bourbon. The taste was very unique. It started out like a tripple with a bit of frutiness and malt sweetness and then as you are about to swallow the oak barrel characteristics kick in. The vanilla sweetness comes around and finnishes with a very smoothe, Maker's Mark-esque flavor. After pouring the yeast from the bottle, the flavor had a little more sweetness an frutiness. I would suggest setting the bottle on the side for a bit and letting all the yeast mix in as it yields a more flaverfull beer imo. But it is defiantly recommedned nonetheless.","Dmann","Dec 22, 2005"

A bit boozy, with a very pleasant vanilla overtone. The bourbon is nicely placed, noticable, but not overpowering the beery, delicious tripel character. The bourbon mixes with the fruity tripel character to create something not unlike coconut. Fruity, lots of pineapple, quite tropical. Nicely placed, subtler bourbon flavor. The tripel still leads, supplemented with oaky, vanilla goodness. A fruity flavor I can only describe as coconut, the sweet kind of coconut in a Mounds bar, fruity and sugary. Plenty of pineapple and other tropical fruit. The finish is mostly dominated by the bourbon, contributing a booziness that only grows as the glass warms. Oaky vanilla, a bit of smoky phenols, with some spicy belgian yeast quality. Medium bodied, with moderate, fine bubbled carbonation. As the beer nears room temperature, the booze gets a little too strong for me, gathering a lot of heat in the swallow, the last quarter of the glass being a very slow sipper. Still, one of the better bourbon-aged beers. Classy, subtler and very tasty.","UnionMade","Dec 19, 2005"

There were light fruit and spice notes but as the bottle warmed the alcohol became even more evident. Very unpleasant towards the end of the bottle.

Frankly, tripel is one of the last styles Id expect to show well after being aged in bourbon barrels. Its a delicate (if high-ABV) beer with a balance of sweet and complex flavors.

The bourbon IS the dominant flavor and absolute focus here and its not in the same league than the tripel. It has qualities though! I was curious (got it?) to get into that smokiness.

4.32,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A dead ringer for a Belgian tripel. Electric gold in color with minimal head. However the lace is elegant and very pretty. Aromas are again very Belgian-earthy, funky, rustic and true to the style fruit driven. The oak is never overdone and shows nice integration. In the mouth the brew screams Belgian-who'd a thunk it. The flavor profile is complex with sweet fruity, nutty, oaky notes in fine balance. The oak lingers on the long finish. very well done, and a treat to taste.","moulefrite","Nov 02, 2004"
4.05,-5.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the BTAH in NYC, as part of the Very Special Cask night. Poured hazy, golden yellow, cloudy, with a minimal white tiny bubble head, leaving very light lacing. Bourbon and alcohol notes in the nose. Tart, fruity,yeasty,strong bourbon/whiskey notes in the not too distant background. It all adds up to a complex, interesting, tasty and strong brew. Not your typical tripel. Track some of this stuff down if you can.","Billolick","Oct 13, 2004"
4.54,6.1,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is perfect. It boasts of pale malts, corriander, orange peels, and a strong bourbon odor. The taste is very good. It has a nice pale malt base, but the flavor is all bourbon. It feels like drinking a weak whiskey, but very flavorful. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied brew with adequate carbonation. This is a fine brew for sure. I've never tasted anything like this. I don't know if this is going to be a regular offering, but I hope so.","WesWes","Aug 30, 2004"

4.39,2.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: How could a random experiment succeed as much as this beer does? One of the best and most interesting beers I've had in a long time and one that I hope to god makes it to bottle, or at least to regular keggings. Awesome stuff.","lenin","Apr 05, 2004"
