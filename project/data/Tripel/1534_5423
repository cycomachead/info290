4.26,3.4,5,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 6/20/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, white grape, pepper, coriander, candi sugar, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Quite dry on the finish as well for the gravity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding tripel style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"

Smell: out of the bottle it was a little windex-y but thankfully that faded before the head... slightly boozy, apple cake, apple juice, coriander, thyme-y herbal note. Less sweet than most and a bit aggressive / astringent.  Taste: unripe pear, soft apple, sugared dried apricot, and grape skin. This is nice, but then it's similarly oddly astringent, finishing with pepper and grassy notes. Medium bodied, finishes a bit slimy and sticky. Definitely different. I think I'd rate it higher if it was lower abv and not labeled 'tripel'...it's interesting.","babaracas","Oct 23, 2014"

As traditional Belgian tripels go, this one is in the same neighborhood as Chimay and La Fin Du Monde, for my tastes, just a *touch* behind Westmalle and Karmeliet.","Greywulfken","Nov 03, 2013"

It's actually shocking how this brew brings excitement with every experience. It just keeps throwing unprecedented qualities at me each time. This is a Tripel I can have any time of year and know I just bought an enjoyable Belgian ale every time I buy it. This thing is brilliant and hands down one of the best in its style.

Head retention couldn't possibly be any better, and the lacing left alongside the glass is plentiful. The nose leads more towards pear than anything else on the ester front, though there is a little bit of green apple as well. There are also some light black pepper and alcochol aromas present to keep things interesting. The fruitiness in the flavor leans even more towards pears, to the point where with the one sided esters and somewhat muted phenols, and a bit of alcohol, that the beer approaches what I imagine a pear cider would taste like. This isn't really a good thing, as it leaves the beer one note, and isn't necessarily what I'd look for in a tripel. The mouthfeel is fantastic though, with a nice and dried out body and an expansive, bubbly carbonation. Gouden Carolus Tripel isn't a bad beer, but it's also firmly not in my top tier of tripels.","axeman9182","Jan 12, 2012"

3.95,-4.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"11.2oz. bottle served in a red wine glass. No dating apparent on the bottle. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a hazy clarity and a one inch dense, bright white head. Head eventually recedes into a solid 1/8th inch cap. An arc of lacing is formed on the tilt side of the glass with little droplets of foam cascading underneath the curve. Aromas of candied fruits (melon, figs, prunes) dominate the nose as well as a spicy/medicinal quality that follows close behind and a suggestion of caramel. Taste is very much in line with the nose; however, everything comes off a bit more muted. Mouthfeel is medium-light, albeit somewhat lacking in body for the style, with a crisp, almost sharp, carbonation and a semi-dry finish. This tends to be a hit or miss style for me; either I love it or I hate it. That said, this falls somewhere in the middle - pleasant and drinkable with a well-hidden abv; however, I would seek out other offerings if I was craving a tripel.","Jwale73","Aug 09, 2011"

Yeast, orange and citric hops, hints of caramel and/or a mellow sugary sweet malt base; slightly acidic and hints of pepper; something like pear or apple as well. Light-bodied, smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel makes this real easy to drink which is dangeours as the high ABV is well-hidden. Some crisp citric flavors as well as some tart apple or pear give it a little bite, but there's also an orange twang and the yeast notes balance it w/ sweetness. Light spicy pepper, some caramel or honey sweetness and a touch of woodiness all lead to a well-balanced beer that alternates between sharp and fruity and sweet and easy-going. A well-made beer that finishes dry and crisp and probably only spot ABV kicks in, this is a great sipper that gives off plenty of flavors and is a must-try.","clayrock81","Jan 21, 2011"

Medium mouthfeel is spicy, peppery, sharp carbonation, light side of dry, some sweetness as well. Alcohol doesn't register on the palate, which makes this beer unusually drinkable for 9% ABV.

This is also a beer where the flavor experience depends on whether the beer is decanted without adding in the yeast or whether the yeast is added in as well.

It tasted like waxy lemon and sour yeast, with salt and vinegar and a bit of spicy ginger and alcohol. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was not really what I enjoy in Belgian pale ales, but it was acceptable for the style. It had a clean taste and wasn't difficult to drink, and the flavor and body improved as it warmed and opened up. Perhaps age would help further improve this, since the 1.5 year old pale Van De Keizer I had was significantly better than this.

Though it is probably my least favorite of the Carolus brews that I've had, it is still very solid. Proof of this begins with a pour that immediately releases bold aromas of fresh, tropical fruit, spicy / tart yeast, earthy hops, and alcoholic strength. The beer has a studry golden, copper color with suspended yeast and an unwaivering head retention. The beer promises bold flavors and a firm texture. The fruit flavors dominate with peaches, pears, apples, pineapples, mangos... All followed by a classic Belgian tartness and a powdery sweet taste (sweetheart candies). Lighty pepery and spicy flavors add to the complexity. The beer feels full, round, and rich from the malts and added sugars; but also thinned by the tartness and rising alcohols. Sweet and spicy right up to the end, where the alcohol and tart dryness kicks in providing a fairly clean, crisp finish.

From a 12 ounce bottle, this brew pours a hazy golden color thats tinged with a slight peach hue. Quite effervescent, the beer has a consistent and never-ending stream of bubbles rising into the white head. Not a bad looking brew, to be sure. The aroma is muted, with a little fruit and spice. I expected that the smell would jump out of the glass, but you need to go searching for the characteristics. Once you inhale deeply, however, theres some clove, apple, yeast, orange, raisins, and a lot of malt. The taste is nicepeppery and phenolic, with a wonderful sweetness. Theres an almost immediate warming as well. Fairly full bodied, which is offset by the fizzy effervescence. Finish has a spicy alcoholic quality. Solidly good.","Suds","Aug 29, 2006"

Quite sweet on the palate, but in a light way -- it's nectary as opposed to molasses-y, with peppy carbonation that helps in that regard. Some orange notes come out in the palate, but there's also a very forward burnt sugar flavor, kind of like creme brulee.

4.53,10,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"330 ml bottle. Gouden Carolus Triple has a stylish, refined label; simple yet appealing. It poured near-perfectly, and I do mean that. As suggested by the brewery, I poured into a chalice glass in one movement of the bottle and left the sediment in the bottle. A meringue white head, pillowy and almost doughy looking formed a magnificent crown to a honey-brown, tawny beer, not sparkling but a little turbid. Stupendous retention on the head: this is a true beer epiphany; what I imagine when the words "Belgian tripel" enter my mind. The head scarcely looked real sometimes as I glanced at it, such was the density of the foam. The lacing, needless to say, was superthick and very viscous, and it leaves glass-covering sheets of the stuff, refusing to move and making the chalice look white from the outside. Magnificent. Delicious citrus immediately in the nose, super fresh and begging for you to try a sip. A little dusty hoppiness in closer, and a honey-smooth maltiness. As it warms I get more lightly toasted malt, lemon and pineapple, a light spicy piquancy, metallic notes, a very fleeting but noticeable tartness in the background, vanilla beans, and some other characteristic which eludes my description right now, but it is akin to extremely fresh cream or perhaps freshly cut wood, pine or balsam. Yes, the hops are here too in the smell, sometimes giving pungent earthy notes or strong dryness. Without question the best aroma of the last few Belgian tripels I have had. I feel a beer before I taste it, and as I expected from the richness of the appearance and the head, Carolus Triple has exceptional mouth-coating fulness. The word creamy does it no justice. Unctuous, palate-covering, almost "fluffy" on the tongue. Light and carbonated, yet filling and velvety, like sipping a cloud, or melted ice cream. At first the honey-caramel malts are tasted. The middle is where it is most complex: a little spicy hoppiness, vanilla, mollasses, warming alcohol, port-like, with blackberry wine or even the sweetness of ice-wine, along with all the citrus fruits. The middle also possesses a tastes of white-sugar and cinnamon. The complexity is exceptional, and gives new flavours with each sip. The finish clinches the beer as one of the greats. Masterful balance of the sweetness, a little yeastiness, and dryness. The dryness is wood-like in character. The alcohol is only noticed by the pleasant warming of the stomach, and this is a dangerous beer because it is so drinkable, but I have a feeling you would pay for drinking too many at one sitting. I would not want to drink several of these in a night anyway: it deserves better than that. This is something to sip appreciatively. 2 of these are heading into my cellar for a little ageing. In the meantime, I will be picking up a few more 4-packs of this and sharing them with my compatriots. As a conclusion I have to say that this really surprised and awed me. In the past couple of weeks I have had St Bernardus Abt 12, Corsendonk Pater and Agnus, Watou Tripel and St Bernardus Tripel, and for me personally, Gouden Carolus Triple surpasses them all. This might sound like too gushing of a review, but it really was this tasty: quite possibly the best beer of this year so far for me. This is the underdog of tripels, and I will be recommending it exceedingly.","Cwrw","Jun 30, 2005"

With a strong burnt hops finish. Alcohol is detectable. Overall if you are looking for a tripple that is light on the fruit and strong on the hops, this is the one for you.

3.92,-4.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer as it sets in the Triple glass is a ambiguous golden orange color, the head is portly in size, the color and off white, and the texture spumous, as the head decays, it leaves behind a fine covering of lace to seal off the glass. The nose is loaded with malt aromas, slightly plummish, crisp and fresh; the start is malt laden and lightly sweet. The top is middling in feel, the acidity biting, and the hops purposeful in their spicy bite, also vinous, tart and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting.","Gusler","Jun 20, 2004"
4.7,14.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a golden hazy beer with a huge head with perfect retention. Aroma is quite complex with a mix of yeast, hops, malts and something sweet like some orange. Taste is just incredible with a perfect mix between sweetness (this beer gotta have some candi sugar in it) and the hops. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, which is great when you have a 9% ABV beer. Overall, this is just wonderful, probably one the best discovery from my recent trip to Belgium.","Phyl21ca","Jun 16, 2004"

Juicy fruit flavors of peach and pine apple upfront then smooth onto a corrander and white pepper finish. Nicely balenced between the sweet fruit malt and spicy hop finish. Dry tongued herbal/grassy mouth after you swallow. Before you swallow you have a fuller smooth silky mouth. Avery nice brew... a complex rollercoaster.","frank4sail","Jun 13, 2004"
4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The taste, although showing off considerably the presence of its alcohol, manages to be quite complex ranging through fruityness and the malt down to a slightly bitter finale. The taste was quite similar, as well imo, to a strengthened pale ale such as 'sierra nevada' which made it quite pleasant.","Andreji","May 23, 2004"
4.38,6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle corked and caged. No freshness date is listed, but it's a beautiful presentation with a black, gold and white label and a black and gold cage atop the cork. It pours a hazy golden orange with a full head of densely creamy white froth that holds exceptionally well and leaves some thick splashes of lace about the goblet. The lacing could be better, but given the 9% alcohol by volume not much more can be expected. The nose is candy sweet with a malty side to it that's nice; and some fruit (orange, apple, lemon) and peppery spice. It's even woody in a way. It's not real bold as tripels go; but it's clean, fresh, and inviting. The body is medium-light; and across the tongue it's lightly zesty with it's effervescent carbonation lending a tickle that's backed up by some light alcohol "sting". The flavor is as the nose suggests, but bolder with much more candy sugar and more apple flavor. It's light on the palate but satisfying, lending to a great deal of drinkability. Only it's alcohol content stands in the way of its being a highly drinkable beer; but that's only due to its intoxicating effect as the alcohol itself never really intrudes in the flavor. It's always present, but never becomes dominant. Quite well done; and certainly not one to be missed by fans of the tripel style.","NeroFiddled","May 13, 2004"

It's earthy, herbal, spicy, hoppy, yeasty and bready. The taste follows suit quite nicely. There's a nice "farmyard" presence about this beer. A little peppery addition on the palate. And great yeastiness. Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated. And the body is light-medium. Kind of an airy mouthfeel. This is one nice Tripel.","Bighuge","Apr 22, 2004"

Low carbonation, medium body. Flavor is interesting, almost coconut-like fluffiness and style with accents of lime and breadfruit. Husky and perhaps a little yeasty. Some alcohol sense at the close, but well-integrated and slowly building. This is a fairly fascinating beer, some components are unlike any I've ever encountered. Distinct, slightly heavier than some, without a Tripel's dryness. But it is a stand out.","ADR","Mar 16, 2004"

3.63,-11.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer had a very active pour that produced a big, frothy head that slowly crackled down leaving a nice lace on the walls of the glass. Has a nice caramel color that is a bit cloudy. The aroma is very subtle. The head doeas not retreat all the way but instead blankets the beer that lies beneath it. The first sip seemed a bit weak but it might have been becaus it was overly cooled. It doesn't really have that Belgian Triple punch that I look for.The mouthfeel is a bit creamy & smooth. The taste is a bit sweet and grows less sweet as it warms. The aftertaste builds as it warms as well. This beer is a good long evening beer because at 9% you defineltly shouldn't be opporating any large equipment. Overall...a nice beer. Not the best triple I've had but then again, a triple is like sex. When it's good it's good and when it's not good, it's still pretty good. Cheers!","BCMan","Jan 04, 2004"

Aromas hint pleasantly of citrus- orange/lemon as well as sweet malt and spice-especially coriander. This is a medium bodied work that finds an outstanding degree of balance in the way of fruity/malty/hoppy interplay. The beer finishes again citrusy, with spice and wild yeast notes chiming in also. A nicely drinkable offering that is quite elegant to boot.","moulefrite","Dec 13, 2003"

A small amount of carbonation and a small amount of sediment is present. An aroma of citrus, candy and butter, with an after affect of the alcohol present. A flavor of candy again with an emphasis on caramel with a hint of yeast. The finish is medium light and slightly sprite with some sweetness.

Nose is complex and dominant in its coriander, pepper, and peachy fruit with a hint of musty yeast and funky, earthy hops. Aroma of spearmint, as well? Very farmhouse-like in the bouquet. Taste is heavy, once again, on fresh pepper and coriander with additional emphasis on earthy hops, traces of honey and partially hidden citrus and ripe peach notes. Super smooth mouthfeel that possesses a profound creaminess. The abv never seems overwhelming and is well integrated throughout the beer. Though the spiciness and abv keep this beer from scoring perfectly in the drinkability category, it does possess some quenching characteristics and goes down quite easily for its size. A quality Belgian tripel from a notoriously solid brewery.","Jon","Beers"

The aroma is full of tropical fruits! As I taste this beer I am stunned by the flavor... very fruity but not quite tart. A masterpiece of a belgian ale! A well balance mild sweetness, mixing in a light bittering and wonderful fruit flavors. Amazing! The flavor hints fruit roll-up which I find very odd... but this is just so much better! Wonderfully complex brew with no hint whatsoever of its rather large ABV. Excellent... i will drink this MANY more times!","wofat","Aug 22, 2003"

Tart and biting, yet quite flavorful. I really enjoyed the dujour, and this is also an excellent brew (which, by the way, I enjoyed in my new Gouden Carolus glass!).

Appears as a drop of sunshine in my glass with golden orange slightly hazed tone to it, huge mountainous layers of foaming vibrant white head mixed with yeast, leaves an even trickled lace with great head retention on this beast. I must give credit for my selection of this to Hart from the Sharp Edge, because this has been a beer I have overlooked for way too long. Aroma is heavenly with lucious spices along with waves of crescendoing malt tailed by honey richnss wrapped in deep tones of alcohol. Flavor great sweetness from the malt very rich and smooth and warming I truly love this beer simply amazing tripel. Mouthfeel is silky and buttery with carbonation that tickles the senses.

The taste repeats the smell with a tart yet lightly sweet fruit and faint spicing with the background yeast and a very warming alcohol that is well pronounced but not overwhelming. This beer is medium bodied and finishes with a lightly sweetened end with each swallow. A beautiful Belgian beer in my opinion! Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","May 09, 2003"

Citrus rind and tart fruity esters upfront in aroma, followed by prominent alcohol spiciness and light phenol riding along with candy sweetness.  Cider sweetness hits the palate initially, and fades into a pleasant melange of honey, raisin bread and lightly bittersweet alcohol.  Fruity sweetness is a constant foundation for the flavor profile.  Moderately bodied, w/ a dangerously smooth mouthfeel. Finishes w/ bittersweet peppery alcohol coating the tongue ensued by mellow alcohol warmth.  A delicious tripel, with excellent balance of fruit and spicy notes.  Cleaner and seemingly fresher than many other examples.  I would drink this all day if my body would allow it.","marc77","0"
