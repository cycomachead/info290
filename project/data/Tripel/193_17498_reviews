"O - For me the alcohol level and strong harsh finish detract, but otherwise this is a solid tripel."

""
""
"Poured into a chalice, it has an amber color with little head. It has some notes of citrus and has some fruitiness to it. It is good, but I have had better triples."
"A bit thin and sweet for the style, but hides the abv dangerously well."
"Fruity nose. Fruit, malt, sweet, and spicy taste. Beautiful dark Amber color. Very nice."

"I'm not a huge fan of triples, but a good quality one always pleases, and I can appreciate the artisanry.  This one was unimpressive.   Had it at the Abbey Brewing Co. in South Beach Miami.  It's their house beer, but they don't actually brew it there.   It was the most appealing item on their menu, but I wasn't impressed."

"Enjoyed the beverage after an 8 mile hike in Point Reyes, National Seashore. Strong and copper tasting almost."
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a small, soapy one finger off white foam head. Aromas of peach, banana, plum, pears. Starts off mellow, and Fades into earthy biscuity notes with a little spicyness and a slight carbonation tingle to top it off."

"22 ounce bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, orange, pear, apple, plum, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, orange, pear, apple, plum, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, cadi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, orange, plum, pear, apple, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel style. Good balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Good example of style, different tastes at each part of sip make it interesting. Best if sipped slowly. No overpowering booze despite being 10%."

"The taste tends to make one forget the aroma. yeah, there are biscuit malts, sugar sweetness, and clean crisp hops but there is this odd aftertaste that I would only best describe as medicinal. I have to say that it really throws the positives out the door because the taste is what lingers. It really throws all the good character stuff I have to say."
""
""
"The color on this brew is hay color, lightly yellowish with a big fluffy head. A very nice looking beer. Smells of fruit, subdued hops come through faintly on the nose. Taste is sweet, estery, with a chewy medium thickness in the mouthfeel. Sugars come through very prevalently and hide the high ABV...so tread caustiously on this one! I thought this beer was well crafted, thought I'm not a huge fan on the style, the look, nose and mouthfeel alone on this made it OK to drink."

"A tasty, well done Triple. On the palate nothing about it really stood out for me, but it wasn't lacking either. I would have enjoyed a more prominent, long lasting foamy head."

"Not really the best at reviewing beers yet, but am I the only one who got a somewhat metallic taste from this? Maybe my palate is messed up but I could swear I had a bit of a metallic aftertaste. It's not bad, the sweetness is a bit overpowering, but I really don't have much experience tasting Belgian beers. I wouldn't jump to taste this again, but I'm just trying to expand my horizons. And I'm definitely gonna work on better reviews. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall- Below average. I would not try this and I will not be buying it again. Very close to being a drain pour and I've never drain poured a beer before. However, I do have a beer that promises to be awful so I might just do that tonight."
"Bottom line: representative of the style without innovating. On the lighter side, with hints of apple. Worth the price."
""
"From my tasting notes: The Brother Davidâ€™s Triple poured darker than most triples with more of an amber color than the typical golden color. It had a good fruity Belgian yeast aroma that yielded a sweet and fruity flavor with plenty of the Belgian yeast notes of candy sugars and cloves. There was little to no perceptible bitterness to this incredibly smooth and highly drinkable triple. It had a high ABV which was well hidden and made it presence known as I drank this tasty triple too quickly."
""
""
""
"O-My overall impression for this beer is that it's a quite decent interpretation of an Abbey Style Ale made in America. I am glad that I tried this. And will recommned this beer to any of my friends who particularly enjoy Abbey Style Ales."

"O - unfortunately not all that impressed with this brew, it has the potential to be a solid offering but between the plastic flavour sneaking in and the alcohol presence not integrated so elegantly it just doesn't make a name for itself, not a try if its in front of you but not worth seeking out"
""
""
""
"Overall- i would take a less alcoholic version of this that had a more rounded malt profile and a bit more hop presence. Maybe I am prejudice but if its gonna be this strong it needs to be a bit more balanced maybe even a touch darker. Maybe its a triple that drinks like a quad, all i know is I probably wouldn't get another."
"some dark fruits that lead to a sweet and full taste. this was part of a mix six i made and has since become an old favorite."
""
"O --- not my favorite style of beer and this isn't going to change my mind."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is strong and delivers a powerful alcohol warmth. Many of the flavors dont come out strongly. Hearty malt, touches of prune or plum there's a bit of alcohol brashness at the end. I get raisin in the body of the taste but it is fleeting. Overall not a bad beer but I'd like the fruit to take the forefront a little more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tripels are one of those styles I have to be in the mood for. I ususally find them to be too sweet and taxing to easily finish, and will rarely want a second after I've had the first. While Brother David's Triple is flavorful and drinkable, it is still a tripel. If you're a fan of the style, I'd give it a try."

"With its high alcohol content, this one is a sipper, and we usually find ourselves maxxed at 2."
""
""
"A really nice Belgian style ale, good flavor, hides its strength well, and has a unique profile. Liked this one a lot and would seek it out again."
""
""
"Brown reddish color a little cloudy. Smells licorice and alcohol. Alcohol is also noticeable in its taste, hard to hide 10% anyway. Tastes strong notes of caramel, apricot, cloves and licorice, with some spicy twist. Body is liquor like. Tasted better once I let it warm up, though hard to beat the main Belgians in their tradition."
"Overall, a fairly good triple, but as others stated... not going to win over any Abbey lovers. I would recommend you definitely give it a shot, especially if you are a fan of Anderson Valley."
"Overall - A different take on a tripel by Anderson Valley. Although I appreciated the fruit flavours taking precedence, I would have liked to pick up on more hops. Better options out there for tripels, but worthy of a try."
""
"Overall a solid, but not over whelming addition to the style. If new to the style its a solid intro beer. I find it a bit heavier than others within the style. Darker in color than most as well."
""
"Overall- Not what I expected, and not going to win over any hardcore Belgian fans, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. +.5 for drinking like 4%"
""
""

"I was excited to try this offering from Anderson Valley Brewing company. I really enjoy a good Triple and since it is from a semi-local brewing company I wanted to give it a try. It smelled fantastic when I opened the bottle and had a really nice color when I poured it into the glass. There was very little head and it did not last long. The flavor did not match the smell. It had kind of a sour milk taste to it that lingered in the back of my mouth that made me crave for something sweet. The 10%abv was well masked by the aftertaste. Definitely not one of their better offerings."
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, spices, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a distinct hair spray flavor with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer all around that is drinkable but nothing worth revisiting in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was an OK example of the style in fact kind of staggering since most triple's I had are 8-9% so not a bad high octane version at all."
"its a hard sell with La Fin Du Monde in a bigger bottle for far less money on the same shelf. I wouldn't go hunting for this one but don't turn it down if poured for you"
""
""
""
"O: The aroma and flavor don't really stand out to me. It's not a bad tripel, just not great. The 10% ABV is impressive though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very unique tasting brew, one that has a mix of a Belgian Tripel and a sour beer blended extremely well giving this brew a superb drinkability and flavor..."
""
""
"Orange sweet, sugar, vague spices, and a good dosage of alcohol providing a heat and some balance to the beer. It's enough, and with more sips the beer's flavor improves. The body is nearly full, somewhat syrupy in texture, with low carbonation in the body. Somewhat of a surprise for me. It took me until now to venture into the AV's Brother David line, and the tripel has rewarded me. Now to try the dubbel...."
""
"Like all tripels, to me at least, I get a disjointed booziness, which here is quite minimized, but still present, in the midst of an underappreciated fruity, wheat-tinged sugar-pop, mediated slightly by the old-world yeast validation. Seeing how the whole bottle disappeared in our short time together, the drinkability is surely bahl hornin', to crib some marketing from another AV product."
""
""
"overall: Disappointed frankly. Liked the Dubbel better. Not bad by any means, but nothing to go out of your way for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied and low carbonation make this a very strange triple. I don't think this one is jiving with me. It tastes alright, but the expectations were not met."
"Overall: Decent. If anything it's a bit mild overall. A bit less bite from the spice and more bold and complex malt flavor would be nice."
""
"Second tasting seems drier. This is my favorite Anderson Valley beer, a decent offering from a brewery I am not a big fan of. An interesting and slightly different sort of Tripel."
""
""
"O- Tripels are a personal favorite style of mine and when I saw this affordable 4-pack I had to pick it up. It is not a bad beer, I will be able to get through the 4-pack no problem, but I wouldn't get this again. It lacks some of the complexity of the best tripels, is a little sweeter than I like, and the finish of the beer seems a little sloppy. I will spend the extra buck on a 4-pack of La Fin Du Monde if I want a great tripel for a great price."
"O: This has potential with nice aromatics & up front when drinking it, but there's something going on that doesn't tie it all together; the finish is not pleasant and I ended up dumping most of the bottle."
""
"O: Had with pizza. Very easy drinking and surprisingly tasty. It grows on me. A poor tripel -- I think most American versions are -- but a good beer."
""
"Overall I suppose you could do worse, but I am not really feeling this one at all compared to other Triples I've had."
"330ml.Snifter glass.Enjoyed on novÂ´11.Orangish copper, Slightly haze.Yellowish white crown, large bubbled,brief retention. Caramel malts,candies & spices to the nose.Notes of orange juice. Crispy upfront,sparkling,sugary,warming alcohol & peppery underneath. Medium body,high carbonation.Sweet fruity finish & aftertaste.Pleasant for candy lovers."
""
"O - Overall, this is a very dissappointing beer. I had bought this before I would check reviews, and upon seeing how bad it was I figured I would wait around for it. With room running out in the cellar figured I'd get rid of this. Just bleh."
""
"O- this is a really good beer. I would definitely pick it up again. But it definitely isn't your normal triple."
"O: An alright tripel, though nothing special. It's a little on the bland side and is too boozy for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, not great. I wouldn't seek this out again, but I'd definitely drink it if it were offered."
""
"pours a darker color than many tripels i've had. rust colored with a thin white head. smells quite robust, floral, malty. flavor is interesting again for a tripel. prominent belgian yeast flavor and feel, sugary malts, pears, grassy hops in the background. mouthfeel is nice, exploding carbonation on the tongue, medium body, easy drinking. no trace of the 10% abv here, even as it warms up. this is a cool tripel because its a little heavier than most. it stood up well to a jalapeno/pepperoni pizza, which many beers of this style could not do. not my favorite but a good effort."
""
""
""
""
"O: meh. The metal threw me off, but it's decent. Has a good burn on the back end. I think it was $6 for a 22 oz. Probably won't buy again."
""
"As far as tripels brewed here in the US goes, this is pretty good and I'd have no problem enjoying in the future."
""
"I have a second bottle, and I will leave it alone for a year or so to see if anything improves. It was reasonably priced at 5 or 6 bucks for a 22 ounce bomber, but I would hesitate to pay even that if it doesn't improve with age."

" ~ This is a good beer. I would certainly recommend this to a friend. I cellared one of the four bottles that came in the four pack. I plan to drink it a year from now. The rest of the four pack won't make it that long."
"Decent Triple, although I think I'd prefer it if it was a couple points less in strength. But I'll support any brewery that uses renewable energy sources (as the cap says solar powered)."

"If you couldn't tell from the description, I didn't like this beer. The aroma started out well, but the taste and mouthfeel just brings this beer down too much for me to give it a good review. I couldn't get over the lack of complexity and the candy flavor just pounded my taste buds beyond recognition. The thickness just made me sick after a while, reminding me of cough syrup. A Tripel should be light and complex, this was anything but."
"This one is on the hot side. Lots of nice stone fruit along with a descent yeast strain but the alcohol tends to get in the way of everything."
"Still... I can't help but think this brew would be better if 1 or 2 % of the abv. was sacrificed, so less sugar had to be added in the proces, for the purpose of booze."
"O: very drinkable, I really like this one"
"Pours a clear deep golden color, little foam and lace. Aroma is full of estery Belgian yeast, fruity and sweet smelling. In the taste, sweet fruity yeast, Belgian candi sugar, solid malt backbone of pale and crystal malts, and little hop bitterness. Alcohol has a moderate presence throughout and the beer is warming. Medium bodied feel, well carbonated and finishes pretty clean. Overall, a nice Belgian style ale."
"O: Comparable to Belgium triples, it is middle of the road, but for an American triple its pretty dang good. Balanced and hides the alc pretty well, in a dangerous way. Not a beer I could drink multiple of, because of the abv and the heaviness of the beer."
"The mouthfeel is clean and crisp with a sharp carbonation and light body. An enjoyable beer but not a wow beer. I find myself sipping of it, taking my time and happy but find it equally enjoyable and forgettable at the same time."
"Dr: It's difficult to drink on account of its badly handled sugar problem and its overdone thickness. The price isn't particularly great considering the low quality. A trainwreck attempt at the Tripel style."
"Overall, not a bad brew, only wish that great initial flavor would have stuck around until the last drop. Oh well, many others out there yet to try."
"O: This is a lot sweeter, hoppier, and boozy than the other top notch tripels I've had. This clearly seems like an Americanized version of the style. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Overall a solid tripel. By no means a standout, but drinkable and enjoyable."
"Smooth easy flavor with light warming and bite upon swallowing. Itâ€™s not entirely complex but very pleasant. Itâ€™s certainly enjoyable and good to look out for despite the fact that I do think itâ€™s not entirely like a tripel should be."
"D: Very complex. Lots of malt and yeast character."
"My first Anderson Valley brew and I am impressed! - A nice flavorful triple that I sure will revisit."
"Overall, not a particularly good Tripel, but could be a decent intro to the style, keeping in mind that there are far better examples."
"Overall, this is good fare, though nothing to necessarily crow about, largely because the vodka-like kick lessens the latter half of the mouthful. Still, for a 10% beer, it's certainly palatable, and the malt flavors are pronounced and well-balanced."
"Overall - Brother David's got solar energy (and a sweet 'stache). For the price, just skip it."
"D - Very little alcohol taste comes through despite this being 10%. I'm impressed by how smooth this is. I wouldn't drink a whole 4 pack of these unless everyone else around me was going to do the same, though. Solid beer overall. Nice. I'll get it again. Renews my faith in Anderson after a couple disappointments."
"All right, but not an outstanding tripel (though maltier than most, for what it's worth.)"
"Final Thought - Not bad. 10% abv and only $3 a bottle. I could love me some of this beer a few times a month. Would love to try this on tap!"
"The taste is excellent, mild sweet flavors play off of the straw and funk tastes. Really an excellent blend, very well balanced beer. Glad to have tried it, hope to drink it again."
"Overall: Flavor profile isn't all that complex. Additionally, the flavor that dominates is a bit alcoholic and sweet. Still, not a bad beer to purchase."
"Overall a great beer. I wish I came across more beers from this brewer, as I like most of what they make."
"This is a goto beer for me because I can get it at BevMo and the local corner store."
"Overall - Very interesting brew. Not super interesting in the taste, but near to it. Nice tasting too!"
"jd"
"The smell had some apple tones and some spices. Taste is with a sweetness, caramelized malts, and some apple flavor. Medium bodied, and like by the group of guys that tried it ."
"Pours as a nice golden yellow color, a little bit of amber in there too. The head is decent at first but fades within a few minutes. It leave just a very small amount of lacing on the glass. The aromas of Belgian yeast and some spice rise from the glass. The taste of those same aromas follow through fairly well in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected, it's nice actually. A pretty good brew all around."
"The smell has banana, alcohol, some spices. Upon sipping this brew, I am getting sweetness, malts, booze, some apple. Its` medium bodied, an acidic feel to it. Overall, a very average tripel & not as good as the dubbel from these guys."
"O: Have I mentioned that it's sweet. packs a punch however still have a few oz.'s to go and my head is reeling(could be the empty stomach) I really like the beers from AVBC but this one is a little sweet for me."
"A good but not great Tripel. There is lots of potential here."
"Ok this is a Abbey style ale that changed my idea of what I thought Abbey ale was. I guess I was expecting something like a dubbel,maybe a bit darker. THis smells like nothing I've smelled before the only thing I'd compare it to is apples with a strong touch alcohol and cloves. TASTE is definitley cloves and apples,apricots? You may want to let it settle for a few minutes.Its not bad,but not something I've acquired a taste for yet.It might take me a few more bottles to get used it.You should try it for yourself.You might like it.Because this brewery makes some good tasting brew."
"given the ABVs, this beer need to warm up and swish around in your glass a little and it really develops. ABV BROTHER DAVID'S are underrated on this site -- they are making this Abbey style their own, slowly but surely. hope they keep at it...."
"O: A bit underwhelming, especially compared to some other brews I have had from AVBC. Not terrible though, just nothing special."
"A later tasting is much more boozy. This bottle may have beenn fresher/too fresh. This is a brew that should set up for a year or more."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing too outstanding either. Pretty drinkable for the abv, but lacks the complexity of the best triples. Worth a try, but not among my favorites."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass, the beer pours a bright, hazy, orange-copper coloring with a thin, half inch layer of tightly bubbled, dense head. Aromas of nutmeg, coriander, and boozey sweet characteristics. The flavors are well blended and crisp, and you get a mouthful of spices at the end of the beer. Other flavors include a slightly sour malt characteristic, booze, and hints of citrus. The body is light and crisp for the style, IMHO. This beer has a mid-bodied lacing it leaves on the glass, but the beer is slick, so it settles back into the beer after a bit. Aftertaste is mostly the spices, with a slight touch of the sourness right at the end. The finish is a bit rich, and that definitely maintains this beer as a sipper, as a Tripel or any beer at this ABV is meant to be."
"O: Not bad, but not great either. One seeking a Tripel could do much better. Got this bottle off my brother-in-law in a trade."
"Comes out of the bottle a hazy honey golden. Mainly fruity aroma has a nice tone of honey sweetness to it. Flavor is fruity - mainly apple and banana - and fairly malty as well and overall very pleasing. Texture is decently fizzy so it leaves a nice tingle."
"Looks more like an IPA on the pour, an opaque amber, barely any head. Nose is all dried banana, gingersnap, candied raisin. Hits my palate with a big scoop of warm melon, powdered sugar, quickly followed by a sharp twist of hop citrus with some peppery notes tickling the edges. Alcohol warms the belly, vaguely noticeable in the aftertaste. Not bad but not great."
"This beer was rescued from a whole foods. It's a solid ""B" effort for an American Tripel. It's just short of something special because the alcohols are a little out of balance with the hops (lack of hops). Dried fruits, banana, berries and alcohol. Not much hops. Alcohol is a little Stingy on the tongue."
"This is a solid Tripel that shouldn't be looked over. I'm just slightly disappointed in how it looks; more like an IPA to me. Nevertheless, Tripel fans rejoice with Brother David's Triple Abbey Style Ale!!"
"D-A fairly successful rendition of the tripel style. However, the sweetness needs to be pulled back."
"Overall: A very average tripel. Not inherently bad but there are much better choices out there."
"D: This beer is far from the best examples of even american style triples. If it came in a 12oz bottle around here, I might age one for next year to see what happens."
"Drinkability - This is a nice triple, but not one that begs you to drink more."
"Good work Anderson Valley."
"D - The alcohol bite threw me off a little. I have had better tripel."
"*I know very little about fine wines, but I think this is true."
"Opinion: This is an alright beer, but it is really falling short of a ""Triple"" in my opinion. The body is the biggest deterrent in that it doesn't have that crisp, bubbly mouthfeel that sends the beer flying across your palate. This beer is quite heavy with low carbonation and high TG, all combined to make it more noticeable to drink than just about any Triple I have had. All this said, the beer isn't flawed at all. I am mentally lumping it into the ""Quadruple"" style since that can be so much more varied. With that in mind, the beer is pretty decent. I will definitely finish the bottle, and wouldn't mind giving it a shot on tap someday, but otherwise, this is probably my only experience with this particular beer."
"Dear Anderson - PLEASE make a Quad!!"
"It's a shame it wasn't my favorite because it's easy to get and relatively inexpensive for how much alcohol is in it. Still, you may enjoy this if you are a fan of lambics or ciders and want something that will kick you on your butt."
"nope. doesnt drink very well. I may finish the glass, may not, but I definitely won't buy this one again. a good value if you look solely at ABV/$, but would much rather a better aroma/flavor/body for my $."
"The only thing actively discouraging me from having more is the alcohol - it's just too hot. The biggest problem is that there's very little to recommend having another to balance the scales. Overall, I think I'll pass."
"Tripels are not my style, but this seems more pedestrian than most."
"Drinkability: Gave this beer a 2.5, and that might be a reach. Not a beer I would buy again, but would drink it if you bought it! Very plain for the price."
"Pours a clear golden with a thick and frothy white head that retains adequately. The aroma starts off with belgian yeast notes, as well as candy sugar, banana, clove, spices, biscuit, fruity esters, herbal hops and some alcohol. The flavor is all fruity esters and candy sugar upfront, along with yeastiness, bread dough, herbal hops, some phenols and spices and alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and sprightly and drinkability is very good. A tasty but not particularly complex triple, very drinkable but maybe a tad too sweet."
"Pours a bright golden color with a nice white head and a good amount of lace rings as it goes down. Nose brings forward caramel and some spice. Some fruity esters and bread in there as well. Taste is mostly some light fruity spicing and quite a bit of booze, which really detracts from the mouthfeel. Some sweetness as well. Overall, this is quite a bit of a mess, and a big disappointment after the Dubbel, which I quite enjoyed."
"D: This affirms my suspicions about the gf: she loves sweet beers above all else. On a personal level, I thought this was average and no better. I'd rather get some La Fin du Monde."
"Overall I'd say it's a nice Belgian-style ale. Not on par with the best authentic ales but solid."
"It has a dirty gold color. There isn't a head on it. It's more like a thin film over the top of this beer. The nose is light with just a little bready yeast. WOW, what a huge taste bud shocker on the first sip. Big wheat with grain and soft malts. That itchy feeling scratches the roof of my mouth from the wheat. A lot of alcohol lingers on the finish. This is a big beer that is fun to drink. I don't see being able to drink more than this one 22oz. bottle or see it going with any meals. I would still buy it again to just sit around and enjoy."
"Mouthfeel flattens out rather fast, can't see myself grabbing this again. Next time pay the extra 3 dollars for Allagash. Ah well."
"The first thing you will notice about this beer is the rich aroma. The beer has the usual tripple smell: sweet and full bodied, with a slight taste of fruit and a woody finish. This by no stretch of the imagination is as goos as an authentic tripple from Belgium, but it is as good as it gets for an American Triple. I would recommend this beer."
"This brew pours a clear deep golden honey hue with pretty average carbonation that leaves behind a fast receding one finger head that disappears too quickly for my liking and leaves no lacing at all its definately not the most appealing looking of beers thats for sure,the smell is pretty average aswell with hints of raisins,brandy and boozy alcohol,i find the mouthfeel just way too light for a triple and the taste doesnt help this brew's cause its a pretty non-memorable mix of raisins,white port,sugar coated candy and of course a little alcohol warmth on first glass which im sure will fade with the more glasses you consume,overall its definately a let down compared to my first sampling from this brewery and given its unique label(and price) compared to the rest of their lineup's labels i thought i was in for something abit special but it was a let down and not a good example of the style at all which they clearly failed at and even though ill finish this bottle i wont savour its taste or return to it again unless shouted as i can prob think of 3 triple's right now that are better,cheaper,and more true to the style but hopefully the other beers i have in my fridge from this brewery are better or at least on par with my first brew from here."
"Otherwise, it's definitely skippable. Not my favorite, and not a re-buy candidate."
"D: An OK stab at the style, but when compared to classics like St. Bernardus or Westmalle, or real good American examples like Allagash or Green Flash, the dip in quality is clear. I like Anderson Valley, but this is not one of their better efforts."
"A bit sweet and numb in flavor, yet offering a better nose than most American Tripels. The Tripel police have been dispatched."
"Man, this is a pretty sweet ( literally ) beer; like, too sweet. Poured with an ok light tan head and a little lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Aroma is reminiscent of Bavarian Weiss with that banana spice thing, plus lots of malt. Flavor is pretty good at first and then is totally dominated by sweetness. Body is full and round of course with all those sugars in there. Carbonation is ok. Finish is sweet then sweet and tapering off to sweet and much too long with all that sweetness. Not a session. Can't finish it."
"M - Nice medium body with great CO2 crispness. Very drinkable and delicious except for the ABV that is felt like a sucka punch."
"Summary - With 10% abv, the alcohol is hidden well. This one's a bit different from what I expect from a tripel. With that said, I think there are better tripel style beers out there. This one's not bad, but also not great in my opinion."
"These Brother David beers just don't cut it. Really, not even worth picking up for just a try. The taste is far from good, and I don't even know if I'll finish the bottle."
"D - Moderate to low drinkability. ABV is very potent, but well hidden. Very sweet - almost too sweet for even one. Would probably like it a little more dry."
"D-decent try, but not what I was expecting and not up to par with other triples"
"An excellent ale. It departs some from the classic Tripels, but it has a soft character that hides its considerable strength quite well."
"Presented in a twenty-two ounce brown bottle, this concoction will abet an evening of quiet introverted contemplation or joyous fraternal revelry, depending on your state of mind and intention of companionship. Best to be prepared, either way the spirit moves you."
"A reddish-orange brew is topped with a thin and bubbly tan head that clears out quickly with no trace left behind. Smells fruity, malty and yeasty with some bubblegum and phenols in the background. Crisp on the palate with big sweet malts, more bubblegum, ripe apples and a little spice. Medium bodied with a hint of lingering alcohol heat, which is very subtle despite the gravity. Goes down with some grainy roughness at the edges and gets slightly creamy middle as it warms. Not bad for an American version, just really hard to beat the masters."
"caramel/amber hue. bubble bath style foam dissepates quickly. really clean, sugary sweet aromas; more sweet than anything else. Lot of sugared peach tasted. This is pretty sweet. There's a little bitterness in the after taste, not hop bitter, but something that opposes the sugar notes. Very minimal carbonation. I can't say I enjoy this beer as much as I thought I did. All the right things are there, just perhaps not in the best proportions. Perhaps a few months in the cellar might ease it up a bit."
"F: Still very sweet on the finish too and lingering spicy heat from the booze. Some of the lingering sweet candi sugar and golden Belgian malts linger, but the spicy booze just lingers. Not too bad for starters on a Belgian Abbey ale, but just way too heavy on the booze and the sweetness."
"D: Better than the Clipper City Heavy Seas Yule Tide Tripel that we poured next to it for the ""Pepsi Challenge," but still not my favorite style. Too sweet for me."
"Pretty much average and ho hum in every way I can think of. Not that that is bad, just average. Nothing I would recommend, but you could do a lot worse."
"Bomber poured a clear golden amber with a small lingering ivory head. Aromas of carmel, fruitiness and spice. Palate was medium bodied, smooth and slightly syrupy. Flavors of carmel, tropical fruit, pear, spice and pepper with a smooth lingering semisweet finish. Very noticable alcohol!"
"D: Good beer but not 100% to style"
"This is a pretty good triple. I would expect it to be a bit more effervescent but overall an enjoyable bier."
"Probably best with a red meat... the thick maltiness of it makes me think roast... like a king :)"
"D: A bit too flat for not being a cask brew.. the booziness at 10%abv isn't offset with enough character in the beer to keep me interested. Started out intriguing, but I'm quickly losing interest."
"Drinkability: highly smelly and tasty, the drinking experience is grand. Drinkability is exceptional considering its cocktail-like strength. I will absolutely be buying this again."
"Notes: A solid tripel but it does not capture my imagination or inspire very much. There are better options out there but I will say that it is affordable, about $3.60 per tulip glass."
"D- Well, for a 10% triple, this does hide the alcohol better than expected. It is a little on the sweet side, but overall, it drinks decently."
"salud!"
"A new one to the TX scene, as far as I know. Pours clear luminous gold and as headless as the horseman who regains popularity about every time this year. Smells of apricots, peaches, brown sugar, and bananas. Taste is banana phenols up front then a rich caramel finish. Not complex but what it does, it does well. Mouthfeel is slick and more carbonated than it looks. Drinkability is good. Its a well-balanced brew and the alcohol just shows up as a warmth later. Both signs of one I'll easily finish. David, you can be my brother any time."
"Overall, not worth $9 a bomber."
"Drinkability - There is no mistake that this is an American version on a Belgian Triple. The mouthfeel was good and smooth with a fine warming from the 10%abv. Again, this brew is a valiant effort, but can't quite stand up to it's Belgian counterparts."
"Taste is only a hint of what the aroma offered. It's sticky and overly cloying. Some metallic twang, and a crisp fruitiness of apple or pear. This is just too slow of a sipper, and not a good use of my sobriety. It's a big beer, without the drinkability of a big beer."
"Lots of typical Chimay-like Belgian esters. Some maltiness hiding behind the esters. Very slight hops bitterness. I did not get the fruit profile that other reviewers got from this beer. Not sure why, but it ain't there. Surprisingly, since I really love this brewery's other offerings, but Id pass on this one."
"Soft and sweet is the balance of this brew. Nice yet soft peppery spicy yeastiness provides an accompanying flavor, but never steals the show. Soft, fruity, and pleasant, this could be described nicely as a soft Triple, or rudely as a weak-tasting Triple, either way, it is highly drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Grainy flavor with a bunch of alcohol and fruity notes...pineapple, muscadine grapes and pears. It's more than slightly sweet with a sugary finish. Has a somewhat creamy feel to it. I enjoyed this beer, especially the aroma. A whole bomber to myself might be a but much, but I think it is a decent American Tripel. I would not be opposed to buying another one sometime down the road."
"Pours a light copper color with a thick, dense head that left some good lacing on the glass. Head died down rather quickly. There are sweet malt and bready yeast aromas with citrus, clove and spice aromas way in background. Not as aromatic as some tripels, had to spin the glass a little to get to some of the aromas to come out. This tripel seems more malty than others I have had and there is a nice bready yeast flavor up front. Then the alcohol warmth and flavors set in with the fruit and clove flavors. The beer did finish kind of quick, there are some lingering faint clove and alcohol flavors, but I was hoping for maybe a little bit more. It still has a very good flavor. Mouthfeel is good, about the right carbonation for a tripel. It's an above average beer. There are so many great tripels out there, that it is hard to stack this one up against them. I would definitely recommend it as it is tasty, but I might reach for something else if it was available."
"D: As with most Tripels, quite drinkable despite ABV. Don't think I'll be seeking again."
"Just arrived in Dallas. I gave this beer a very vigorous pour, but only got a very airy, very slight head that immediately faded away. The color is dark brandy, mostly clear. The nose is yeasty-fruity, not unpleasant, with a faint faint spiciness. It has a fairly sweet flavor, backed with a honeyish fruitiness. The phenols are more prominent here, giving a band-aid type character. But it blends together poorly, overall. A rather weak effort from from this brewery."
"One finger off white head doesn't last in the time I rough pour it to sitting down. Semi-transparent light amber body with a ring of foam bordering the brew is all that is left of a head. Nose resembles honey and spices. Taste is sweet up front, but not too much, bitter on the finish, with some heat and ethanol fuming off your tongue. Some honey flavors here too, mead like, then the carbonation flattens out the flavor in the back. Good carbonation and balance on the tongue, though I'd prefer the alcohol being hidden better, its just too noticed. Not a horrible triple by any means, I'd buy this again."
"Drinkability is good. Not sure why this beer doesn't get better rankings. I think it's a pretty solid Triple, that goes down pretty easy for a high ABV beer."
"This is a really smooth triple ale. It is a really clear dark amber color. The thing that strikes me most is how smooth it is. Not hoppy, but you can taste the hops. Not very malty, but you can taste the malt. It is a very well crafted and balanced brew. It has a light mouthfeel as it is lightly carbonated. The main thing is that is its very drinkable. It goes down really well any time."
"The ten percent is hidden very well. A very nice triple."
"drinkability: overall a decent tripel but there are better out there."
"Poured into a snifter-like glass. Clear amber with lots of champagne sized bubbles. A small head that quickly disappears into a ring of not quite lace. Aroma of berries with some graininess. Starts out sweet with a bit of cloves. Somewhat unpleasant alcohol middle. Mouthfeel is medium tilted toward light. Slightly saccharine finish and aftertaste."
"It did have a nice label, though..."
"not too memorable, this rating is taken from my notes and i don't really remember it much"
"Overall, this was a good beer but significant room for improvement. There was decent balance but a bit too much alcohol and not quite enough flavor. Overall, worth a try."
"D- This is definitely a sipper due to the high alcohol, but a pretty solid Triple. It isn't anything mind blowing, but a tasty beer that is worth a shot. Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated. The sweetness hits you on the front of the tongue and the carbonation hits you in the back of the throat."
" stand without the accompaniment of food."
"Overall not that great. Buy a real Triple elsewhere."
"Not bad. Too sweet. I've not been impressed with either of the Brother David brews I've tried."
"The beer is good - not great. To sweet and too much alcohol for me in the tastes. Not a bad brew to has every once in a while. But there are much better takes on the style."
"Seems to want some artisan bread & butter and maybe some mild, soft cheese to pair with it."
"Minute head, islands of very large bubbles pool together here and there, same basic story for the lacing. Metallic zinc orange in color, you'd expect it to glint in the sun, barely moves to a lighter yellow-tinged color around the rims. Molten caramel, clove spice, candied oranges, banana as well as prune, plum, date and apricot fruit scents, as well there's a component of wet iron, metallic sweat and the dirt floor of a cold, damp unfinished basement. Medium-bodied, is not quite in control of its sweetness hence you get a scattershot of floral dew, tangerine, orange, grapefruit citrus, caramel and toffee, apple pie and cobbler styled peach, pear, apricot fruit. And that banana custard too. Yeasty too, clings to the mouth pores. Carbonation is weak. The clove and nutmeg spice more muted and less effectual. Only a trace of grassiness. The sweetness does release an inch as it ends so it's more perfume and the tongue can move freely once more. Maybe it could serve as a literal dessert beer."
"A nice beer, one of the better american tripels. Nice spiciness from the yeast, very nice malt profile, although the color is a little off for the style. Pretty sweet, but a nice dryness at the end. Much better than Golden Monkey."
"D: Drinkable, but just barely. Way too sweet for more than just a few sips."
"Drinkability: decent beer. One bomber is enough for me, but this beer is worth a look."
"Overall: There is a dryness in the finish of the beer. The mouth feel is carbonated and spicy. The beer showed no carbonation but there was a moderate amount of carbonation in the mouth feel. There was no head for a triple there needs to be nice head. I feel the beer lack balance it was blended together. If the beer took some time in the cellar and aged for a couple of years I think it would be a whole lot better."
"Pours golden, slight haze, thin head that doesn't last. Nose reminds me of a mead that I had recently, honeyed with some lighter fruits in the mix. Palate is sugary sweet, pears, peaches, apricot, and noticeable alcohol on the finish. Seems to be a cross between a golden ale and a tripel to me."
"D_Alcohol really shines though in all its glory. Low repeatability"
"My bottle didn't come with the fancy wax so that may have been my first clue. For a Tripel there is almost no head to speak of. Hopefully the bottle was not roached but I trudge forward. Appearance is a caramal with sediment flowing freely throught the bottle and glass. The alcohol is there but is very nicely masked which could get daddy in trouble. As it warms the complex nature of the beer springs forward. A mild (sort of unpleasant) aftertaste is present after each sip. I am not a huge fan of Anderson Valley and this did little to sway into buying more of their beers."
"Not bad. A tad too boozy. I'd like to try this one after a bit of aging."
"Pours clear yellowish but a bit darker, good doughey head. Taste is totally off, this does not strike me as a true tripel. Lots of vinous flavor here that reminds me more of a quadrupel despite the coloring. Some dark fruits, this beer is a contradiction. I'm also feeling some hoppy bitterness on the palate. This beer is more of a clusterfuck, pardon my language, than anything. It's not all bad but not what I expected when I was looking for a good tripel. Taste at your own risk."
"This is missing something. Clear amber pour. No matter how hard I tried, I could not coax a head out of this beer. Aroma is spicy and malty, but weak. Taste was musty yeast, spice, and lots of alcohol. Thick mouthfeel with a sticky finish. Good, but there are much better tripels out there."
"Interesting but not a standout brew."
"Poured a light amber with a massive head Nose has some spiciness on top of sweet malts and light hops. The spiciness provides a nice touch to the taste. The beer was very heavy on the alcohol taste. It is not covered well at all. It really just kicks you in the teeth. The alcohol brings down the drinkability and its just not enjoyable to drink. The only beer from Anderson Valley I was not impressed with."
"initial taste is crisp and a bit carbonated. very malty, and the taste lingers a bit. floral and citrus tastes all combined together in the flavor. taste hits up front and top of the mouth, taste goes away quickly, but there is a lingering taste primarily on the roof of the mouth."
"Notes from 1/23/05"
"I'm partial to the style and this is a solid representation but not quite up to my expectations"
"Bottle from the Utah State Store. Pours a deep amber color with a medium white head. The aroma is very sweet; loads of caramel and candies. The taste was simple but nice; lots of sweet flavors, some light hops, a bit of sweet fruit, and overall an simple, but enjoyable brew. A bit of warmth, but not overpowering."
"D - Not my style. I'm moving on to the next one."
"The taste is malty and with strong musky grape sweetness, grain, caramel, wine, with a buttery quality and feel that is more pronounced near the finish. It has a slight barleywine quality, resembling English barleywine a bit more than it some tripels or say a doppelbock. There is only a weak hint of bitterness yet a clear alcoholic character. It doesn't compare to Westmalle or some others and lacks drinkability."
"Not much of a Belgian brew - the tripel is an easy style to have slip from your grasp, and this one amplifies the worst characteristics while ignoring or sublimating the great."
"Not a huge fan of this one. Way too sweet. I really hate wasting beer, but not too sure if I can finish the bottle."
"D - Well, at 10% ABV it's an ale to take your time with - quite potent."
"Drinkability is ok. not the best Triple I've experienced but it'll do the trick."
"A tough style to nail. Not a ground breaking tripel, but pretty good in my book."
"D- Despite the alcohol taste this is pretty east to drink."
"The drink is smooth, medium-bodied, and well-carbonated. Nicely drinkable."
"D: A noticeable alcohol burn on the finish hinders drinkability. A lack of complexity and yeastiness also limits enjoyment and is only average going down. Ok, but not one I would probably go out and buy again."
"Drinkable when only contemplating one bottle, I wouldn't want any more than that in a sitting. This is too thick and too bland for the style. but there are so many better authentic Tripels out there that I don't feel the need to try this again. Next time I buy an American ""Brother", it'll be Brother Thelonius."
"The brew is a rubish/amber color with a white head. Carbonation is medium and the clarity is quite clear. The aroma is of sugar candies and musky straw. There is a sweet maltiness to the lips followed by a strong syrupy mix of hops, alcohol, and fruit. The body is full, but the coating from the thcikness is not enjoyable. Just a lot different from what you expect a Triple to be, even if it's a US brewer."
"D - This is an easy drinking beer, but a somewhat unusual taste for a tripel."
"Split a 22oz bottle into 2 goblets, the first maintained a nice head but the second did not, this might be due to a poor pour on my part. Aroma was crisp and fruity. Obviously dubbed a triple due to alcohol and not color. Color was orangey brown, first impression was that it resembled iced tea. Tasted apples and grapes and very slight banana. Perfect balance of the alcohol and sweet fruit notes, very drinkable. Moderate lacing."
"D- I have never had a tripel this dark, at first I feared it. Though I opened up to it. A rather decent tripel, though at $5.99 there are other tripels I'd rather have."
"A good, but not great, American Triple. I've had better Triples and better beers from Anderson Valley."
"Pours a nice rich copper, but the texture seems a bit thin. Aroma of banana and some type of stone fruit...apricot...that's it. Very light mouth feel- lighter than most AVBC beers. Drinkable, but that doesn't make it good. Clean finish with a little sweetness, but nothing memorable...the yeast turns a bit sour after a while- even though that may be a characteristic of some Belgians, it over-rides any other flavors in this beer over time. Eh, for a Belgian style ale I expect a little more. It's hard to pan any AVBC beer...but this is one..there's something missing. I think their Dubbel is a better pour."
"First Anderson Valley offering and a large disappointment. First thing I notice as I pour is that it seems to be thin as water. A very clear golden copper with thin head that dissolves like a soda and leaves nothing behind. Smell is of foul yeast, really cannot distinguish much else. Taste is actually ok, a strong malt presence, a bit of sweet sugar and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is light and thin as can be, just doesnt seem right. Overall a disappointment and wont be revisiting again."
"Somewhat on the easy side to drink, but the flavor is nothing spectacular."
"This one sadly misses the mark on the style and is too sweet and uneventful - out of style. I prefer this brewery's double, though that's not a classic of the style either. It's a shame, as this brewery makes some good to great beer. This is not one of them. Maybe they should re-think the Belgian-styles. In the end, pretty drinkable for the abv."
"This isn't a bad beer- just not one I'd enjoy in the long term. It's lacking complexity to balance the sweetness. Plus, it REALLY reminds me of a poorer version of Allagash Grand Cru, which kinda throws me in terms of its classification and how to view its style"
"D: Enjoyable, at least. The more I had the more I appreciated the way the flavors worked together. The malts were just a touch sweet for my liking but this seems to be more common in the American rendition of the Belgian triples. Overall, very good and recommended."
"Wouldn't recommend this one as a good representation of the style..."
"I've had this dozens of times since it became available in Boise.. I always remember it being MUCH better.. this time was way too sweet and a huge mash-up of flavors."
"D - Definitely drinkable, but the notes I have about the appearance and drinking glasses are a bit disappointing regarding the tripel style. There should be an alternate category for American Styles using Belgian strains of yeasts."
"in the mouth there was a sharp carbonation bite. There was somewhat of an alcohol to it, but it kept it hidden pretty well for an abv of 10%. The yeasty taste stayed on the tongue for quite a while. Overall I thought this one was a little rough around the edges for this style."
"The taste is of sour apples and vinous, bitter white grape rinds. Wheat and alcohol notes (especially) bring the tongue to a slight sweat. Body is viscous and over-carbonated for such a high alcohol brew. Anderson Valley's tripel is fun at first, but loses its appeal quickly. It was hard to get this one down...a good tripel should make you want the next sip. This one just didn't have that effect."
"Overall: Not so much a triple, more like a Belgian barleywine. Was actually enjoyable to drink despite my review... I would cellar this beer again."
"Drinkability- Not as good as a Belgian styled beer should be but ok. Worth if you can get it at a decent price."
"D-This is a decent American made Tripel but there are much better ones out there. Still this is clearly well made and enjoyable."
"A bulky, high octane Tripel that seems rough around the edges. I'd be interested to see how this ale mellows after a year or so of aging, but it's not quite ready now."
"On tap at the Stone Bistro. Poured into an 8oz snifter, was a dark caramel color with a light tan head. The smell was very tilted toward the earthy Belgian yeast side. Not as fruity as expected for most tripels. The taste was also very earthy, more in the variety of like a soil or dirt. Not a bad tasting beer by any means, but not really what I would usually expect for a tripel."
"D - Ummm... maybe great for alcoholics who love the way alcohol burns, but want to cut back on their overall intake? The alcohol presence on this one is just unacceptable. I give beers some room to be a bit boozy, but this detracts from the flavor, the aroma, the mouthfeel and the drinkability. Even if it wasn't so boozy, it seems like it would be a mediocre tripel at best. This is the worst beer I've had in quite a while. Still above a drain pour though..."
"very unhazy for a belgian style, and ambery with a white head that goes away relatively quickly and has good lace. I could go on and on about this one, and I did experience some nice fruit and sweet honey/sugar stuff, but as far as holding its own against other authentic belgians, this attempt just doesn't make the cut. And the boozy finish it carries with it makes it low in the drinkability level. Still a wonderful beer. I just think avbc makes great american style beers and should stick to their forte. It was fun anyways, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Not a repeat for me in terms of the style but a decent offering."
"Drinkability: Delicious, and only rated as 4.0 because of the high alcohol."
"Pours a rather flat looking tripel. The color is a dirty orange-brown color, no lacing. The smell is of green apple, candi sugar, and honey, not too bad. AV's tripel hits with fusel alcohol, brown sugar, and some bitter hop action. Kind of a rather one dimensional tripel. The alcohol presence hits hard without any of the nice complex sweetness that tripels have. There is a raw sweetness to this brew but it adds to the alcohol heat. There is a malt/hop presence but doesn't really mix well with the rest of the flavors. This is not awful but doesn't live up to the high standards of Belgian tripels. The feel is moderate with moderate carbonation, finishes on the bitter side. Not a bad example of a tripel but far from great. Not a sugar bomb like some American tripels but could use more complex flavors."
"Definitely worth the $3.25 I paid for this during happy hour"
"With this trainwreck in mind, I haven't tried their Double, but I think I'll pass on that one too if this is any kind of indicator on how AV brews an ""Abbey""."
"Drinkability: I find this to be easily drinkable because of it's lack in complexity. This means I would go through it easily if it was the only beer around, but because there is a wide selection, I will most probably never try this one again."
"22 oz. bottle- color of hazy honey, with a white head - nose of honey, yeast , slight cloves , and chicken broth Â– taste of yeast, alcohol(not bad), honey, and oats- body is medium, and with medium high carbonation Â– aftertaste of sweet/sour, yeast, and honey"
"Drinkability: ItÂ’s a drinkable beer but not one I will go out of my way to try again. ItÂ’s a tad bitter for my taste and it has little to distinguish itself from other beers."
"Drinkability: Boy, should Anderson Valley stick to its knitting - keep brewing in the British/West Coast tradition and put a lid on the Belgian efforts; both this and the Double are an indulgence that is best kept at home"
"This is moderately drinkable, neither bad nor good. Actually, it's closer to bad as it warms, so serve it cold! Time may aide the sugar, but I doubt I'll bother buying another for the cellar..."
"Very good beer. Very drinkable but with the 10%ABV it's definitely a sipping beer. Gets even better when it's a little warm."
"D - To be sipped, for sure. A nice treat. Just a tad on the harsh side due to the alcohol's noted presence."
"Pours a crisp orange with a thin head that is all too quick to diminish to nothing and leaves the beer looking incredibly bland. The aroma has some spiciness on top of sweet malts and light hops. The spiciness provides a nice touch to the taste, but overall, its nothing special. The beer is slightly heavy, but the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Overall, this is a far cry from what I expect in a Tripel."
"Thanks to one of the Carolina Brewmasters who let me sample this as our annual memorial Day BBQ. Fan of the tripel and though this one was refreshing, it was a bit thin for the style. Nice carbonation and head retention, notes of fruit, a bit difficult to finish a bottle by myself. Worth a try, but do not go looking extensively for it."
"As Dave Chappelle put it, ""it'll get you drunk."" And that's nice. Otherwise I'd look into other options for the style... this is quite unrefined (not sure the aging helped, but I don't think it hurt). Don't need 22 oz of this, some is going down the drain."
"Overall: A medium bodied, high alcohol, ultra drinkable, just plain awesome--yet understated beer that I can't get anywhere near here. Bittersweet, but that's life on the edge of the country. My tequila collection is really growing though."
"M/D: Thick and silky. But still 10%, so only one of these for me."
"The 10% ABV doesn't reveal itself in the mouth, but hello.. yes it is there."
"Tingly"
"for my anny bombing from Solomon420"
"Drinkability- I'm not much into Belgian tripples, but this stuff ain't half bad."
"Not recommended."
"Smooth but thin mouthfeel, that is mildly sweet, with flavors of rose water and lychee combined. Some alcohol notes in the finish, and definitely warming by midglass. This is a lackluster attempt at the style."
"Overall a quite drinkable beer, but not incredible. Something I'll keep buying, but I won't go out of my way for."
"Lots of room for improvement with this one."
"Pours a light and dulled orange colour, clear and no head. Completely off appearence for a tripel. Aroma offers some fruity notes, somewhere between oranges and apples. Very sugary and sweet. The high gravity leaves a lasting vinegar note. Thin bodied to the excessive alcohol as well, drinks more like a Belgian Pale Ale than a tripel. Very little dimension, taste dominated by rotting apples and pears. Some tastes of roots. Carries cheap white wine like sugars. This really doesn't cut it for tripel."
"Thanks for the sample crwills!"
"Crwills thank you for picking up at BOW and bringing. Creamy head with soap bubbles, wafting yeast aroma, lace in glass. Sweet yeasty taste, pear, peach and sugar and apple-tropical. my favorite style though this is not the prime representative of the style.Alcohol hidden by process.Nicely quaffable."
"drinkability is good. a bit too sweet for my taste, but otherwise very nice."
"Mouthfeel is exceedingly thin and flat."
"Poured a nice pale amber with lots of carbonation and a decent head. Thick lace stayed throughout. Smell was very spicey, nutmeg, cinamon, hints of apricot and a touch of alcohol. Very light and lively smell. Taste followed suit nicely. Apricots,. figs, a hint of grassy tones. Very nice going down. A bit of a warming when going down made it nice on a cold night. Overall this was a nice treat and at 10%abv didn't really feel that strong for a big beer. A good value for the price."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours an opaque, brownish dark gold color. The usual fluffy head that you expect from a tripel didnÂ’t happen with this one. It had a smaller, fizzy head that drops away almost immediately. The aroma is a bit disappointing also. It is OK, just very weak, especially for a 10% beer. Lighter notes of the banana and spice that are typical of the style. Also some notes of the alcohol. The taste is OK, with some of the banana notes and yeastiness. Alcohol taste also. It tastes like a tripel, but it is not as complex or smooth as I would expect from this type of beer. Just rates an OK. There are much better examples readily available."
"Not great but OK. Hard to find a beer of this style for the $6 I paid for the bottle in the United States. Still this is just competent and not great for the money, unless Trader Joe's has a Tripel then this is likely the best you will find locally."
"D-Definately not my favorite tripel and one bottle was enough. This is a difficult style to perfect and I commend them for trying. I believe that there can not be enough tripels out there, but this one isn't worthy of a memorable experience."
"Drinkability - a fine sipper this is! A tasty tripel true to style."
"I liked Brother David's Double and I expected to like his Triple at least as much since I prefer the latter style to the former one. For some reason though, it isn't as faithful a recreation. I hate to say it, but I think Anderson Valley would be better served by sticking to the classically American styles. Which they do very well, by the way."
"I've been keeping track of my favorite samplings of single malt scotch for a while, but I've only recently done it for good beer too. Among the best lately has been Brother David's Triple. It's taste and drinkability I rate over some recent Victory products (12 and Golden Monkey). It's a better deal too up at the cash register."
"D - Even in my buzz loving Friday night mode, I honestly don't think I could comfortably finish a second of these. It's very nice on occasion, but not an everyday beer."
" Probably worth a try but not a brew I'll revisit any time soon."
"Poured from a big bomber with a cap and wax. Looked clear and golden colored with a very thin head. Carbonation was a little light. The smell and taste were dominated by fruity esters, kind of sickly sweet with an alcohol burn behind it. Not the best tripel, but not terrible either."
"Easy to drink and quite tasty, it would probably age quite well. Give it a try if you can find it."
"Drinkability: A drinkable, but flawed outing from the brilliant folks at Anderson Valley."
"I think this tripel style ale would do well in futher tastings with different cheeses and wheat crackers."
"NOTE: Bottle suggests a serving temp of 40 - 45 degrees F. My fridge is at 50 and so that is what I serve at. Personally I have never had anything outside of a macro below 50 degrees and generally warm beers after pouring to get everthing the aromas and tastes have to offer. I can't say how this would be at 40 - 45 degrees other than numbing."
"D: This one was shared with my wife, who liked the malty sweetness and dry spiciness. We accompanied it with some cheeses, including a creamy French delice de borgogne, a sharp Spanish blue cheese and a nutty French mimolette. This beer went very well with all of them. High ABV at 10%; this is an enjoyable sipper. Find someone to share a bottle with..."
"Thanks to Rick and Betty for generously sharing this example."
"This pours a reddish orange with a small white head that disappears very quickly. The color really is pretty light and the head is almost nonexistant. The smell is sweet candy sugar that makes this very sweet. The taste is good with candy sugar, sweet malt, banana,cloves, and coriander. A good tasting Triple. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. A good beer that really only needs to improve its appearance,but then again don't we all."
"If it were easier to get and cost less (both of those issues are local problems) I'd drink it frequently!"
"D- This beer is sweet and malty which is nice but the bubblegum and banana flavors are a bit out of place."
"Taste is pleasingly sweet with an abundance of fruity and estery flavors and a warming boozy finish. Pallate is left dry like after a sip of champagne. Moderately drinkable but I'd suggest sharing with a friend."
"Overall- OK, but nothing great here. I would suggest AV's other offerings like their IPA instead."
"Pours with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Clear golden brown color, moderately carbonated. Smells fruity, tart, yeasty with a distinct bubblegum and alcohol presence. Initial sip is a swift hit of ethanol followed by a fruity sweetness. Medium body. Alcohol dominates the flavor, beneath the alcohol some sweet clove spiciness and fruitiness is evident. The high alcohol detracts from an otherwise decent beer."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich pale malt scent along with a slight yeast spiciness. It has some fruity esters. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that is rich and warming in the finish. It goes down with ease with a dry spiciness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good beer and another quality selection from Anderson Valley. It's full flavored and easy drinking."
"($6.99 / 22 oz. tall brown bottle capped and waxed)"
"914"
"Poured a dull sort of copper with a well sustained white head,real lively carbonation it looks somewhat spritzy,green apple aromas mixed with some phenolic spice and smoke I pick up a hint of bubble gum like that found in some Bavarian hefe weizen's as well in there.Quite honestly there is not alot of character to this beer in the flavor department but there are some pleasant components some pear and hints of green apple up front with spicey,yeasty lingering finish.Its missing something its close to being really good but needs somedepth and a little more flavor punch but it goes down easy for being so high in alc.I wont seek out again but its pretty enjoyable,a simple pleasure."
"Yeast flavors towards the end were extra awesome. It was generally very sweet, heady, smooth, clear and clean; the yeast at the end tripled all these qualities save the clearness. Very flavorful and lightfooted despite 10% alcohol."
"My cousin brought this to a wedding this past week. What a nice treat. The presentation with the melted wax over the cap is a great presentation. The beer poured a bright amber color with a slight white head. The aroma was sweet and a bit fruity, banana. The taste is sweet and a bit of spice with some hints of the high abv in the background but not overly alcholic which is deceiving. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium also so it makes for a fairly drinkable beer."
"Big thanks to Rick and Betty for sharing the bottle!"
"22 ounce bottle with the worst smelling wax that has ever been used. Stinky and nasty cheese smell that would not make anyone wish to drink the beer if the bottle was next to the glass."
"This is a solid offering and one I would come back to on a regular basis if the price was right..."
"Overall, I felt that this beer's flavor does not have enough depth, especially compared to its enticing aroma."
"I was expecting to be a bit let down with this, but I'm pleasantly surprized. I find it somewhat odd that this isn't ranked a bit higher..."
"A fairly drinkable beer, more drinkable if it weren't for it's high ABV which on an empty stomach is making me woozy already...time to get some grub"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer was full bodied. The alcohol really dominated the taste and mouthfeel of this beer. This beer is not a total wreck. This is just not a particularly inspiring triple."
"Pours a burnt orange color, head fades to a thin layer with a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is of green apples, citrusy, perfumy with just a hint of sweetness at the end. Taste follows the aroma with added biscuity and spice flavors. Medium bodied mouthfeel. As the beer warms the sweet malts come to the forefront."
"It isn't hard to drink, I found myself enjoying this big 1 pt. 6 oz. bomber...just don't feel compelled to buy it again, despite that great price (under $6!)."
"I'm ready to have a glass of water after this because of the alcohol presence and the lack of anything that's appealing in a distinct way."
"Nice enough, though. Not quite a typical, or a trancendent tripel, but nice."
"Drinkability: Yes, this is a good bottle to drink. I could put down a 750ml by myself, but its more fun to share."
"Pours an cloudy orangy color, small head, some carbonation, nice lacing. Scents of malt and fruits. The taste is a little soury/sweet carbonated feel, alcohol is hidden very well for a 10% ABV. Medium body. Drinkable in my book any day. I liked this brew from Anderson Valley, not true to style, but very nice. I would buy again, and would recommend to people."
"I rather enjoy this brew and can drink it with ease. I expected a little less after some of the reviews I read, but this is a nice tripel."
"Taste; bananas, cloves, a touch of vanllia and oranges. There's a definite presence of alsohol in the finish, and it gets way to sweet as it warms. Mouthfeel is a little thin and oily, and there's not much in the way of carbonation. This is a decent beer, but not something I would ever seek out again."
"Overall, I like it. Not tooo sweet, not tooo alcoholic- a good, tasty, solid brew."
"Ugghhh ...this is a great style but this one falls short."
"As my education in craft beer grows so does my understanding. Triple is not a style I love, but it is good. I do think this beer is on par with some Belgium Triples."
"It would be worth trying if you've exhausted your Belgian beer opportunities, but there are better beers to try first."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Bottle shared with Capflu, DumDum and LubiÃ¨re: Poured a light orangey color tripel with a small bubbly white head. Aroma of wheat is very weak with some light coriander and some Belgian yeast. Taste is less spicy then what I would have hoped for with a definite lack of wheat. Body is too thin for the style and carbonation is almost non-existent."
"Overall a lackluster example of a triple, one that I would not recommend to anyone."
"This beer is an amped up version of David Double. A little thinner and clearer in color, lesser retention, but laced well. Smells sweetly candy-like and alcoholic. Sweet fruits and spices persist in the aroma. Tastes of classic belgian candy sugar, pears, peaches, figs, dates, apples. Spices of cinnemon, clove, corriander, and mint. Mild hopping also adds to the spice, and makes the sweetness tolerable. Big firm body holds the unique belgian yeast and fermentation flavors. Carbonation is big on the toung and palate. Finishes hot, spicy, dry,and thinly sweet. A good beer, but I am interested in seeing if aging will help to mellow it out."
"Tried this beer tonight and I'm truly impressed. I've always been a hug fan of Belgian beers and have found that many American breweries are besting some of the weaker Belgian brews. This is truly an exceptional beer. Anyone who thinks this beer doesn't have character and Belgian flavours doesn't want to expand their experience with flavour. Try this one."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" off-white head over the clear amber brew. Head lasts pretty well, with minimal, delicate lacing. Aroma is exhibits sweet and spicy notes, yet still seems to come up a bit lacking overall. The taste is dominated by sweetness upfront, fades into a fruity, sort of banana flavor, and then closes with a somewhat off bitterness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay, but that off close just kind of killed the niceties I found at the beginning."
"Well, my wife ended up dumping half of the 10oz pour I gave her. I struggled through my glass until, battle-scarred and battered, my palate hoisted the white flag and I dumped the last remaining couple of ounces. Letting this AV offering warm up is a mistake as it only adds more fuel to the alcohol fire already raging in this bottle. Ten percent ABV?? I'd have guessed substantially more. Yet another Anderson Valley offering I'll not return to anytime soon. I'm dangerously close to skipping their entire line-up now as I'm not impressed with this one or many others in their arsenal. Danger-close to a total drain-pour."
" This is a tasty tripel. It is quite sweet. There are ""green"" fruit flavors which seem to be well blended and smooth. The alcohol rears its head every few sips. Mouthfeel is syrupy and coating. I could drink another one, if only I had another one. I will cellar a few of these to see where they go."
"Beer pours a nice orange hue with great bubbly carbonation. Head reaches an inch then resides to rest in the glass. The smell is of cloves, honey and banana peel. Hint of mango extract, the spices are exotic. Taste is of coriander and spicy yeast, the banana taste lingers, alcohol is very present, allow to warm up and the syrupy malts will react and take away much of the alcohol taste. Feels lively and smooth in the mouth."
"Pours with a one-finger white head, fades quickly, and leaves no lace. Nice, clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is raisiny/alcohol. Starts sweet - more malt than hops, alcohol is noticeable but smooth. AV's double is better. $6.15 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"A well made beer that I enjoyed and found quite drinkable."
"Spiffy looking 22oz bottle with a plastic wax covered top. Clear golden orange with a little bitty white head. No lace. Aroma is light fruity notes with some hints of yeast and bread. Along with that was the all too potent alcohol. This is one you could tell from the nose that it was going to have that stinging alcohol taste. Light fruit over a layer of way too sweet malt. Yup this was hot, too much sweetness and too much alcohol donÂ’t make for a pleasant drinking experience. Light burn on the finish. Fairly thick feel to it but the sticky sweetness is not one I would expect for the style. No much in the way of drinkability either. I love some of their beers but this sure isnÂ’t one of them."
"Overall, I found it drinkable, especially given the fact that I generally don't seek Tripels for a session ale."
"I think this beer would be alot better with a bit of carbonation, its FLAT! The lack of carbonation seems to kill the beer. Nice redish copper color, but it took a very rough pour to generate any kind of head. The small amount of foam was an off white and lasted a very short time. Aroma is muted, but sweet and full of dark fruits. Flavor is sweet and malty, fruity and very heavy. A spicy, dry finish. Mouthfeel is syrupy and flat. There is potential, but unless theres much more lively carbonation this beer is nothing special."
"Nice looking bottle. Shiny brown in color with absolutely no head. Also, it was at first slightly carbonated, but a few minutes after the pour it went completely flat. Nose has a nice malt base with some caramel, and is latently supported by a fruit. Plums and banana? Taste has a nice sweet start. Heavy on the malts and Begian sugars. Alcohol comes through a bit on the back end. Finish has some great spice tones and the beer is also pretty light on the tongue. Not sure if it is supposed to be this flat though. As flat as tap water."
"Carefully poured, the body is a clear orange-amber with golden highlights beneath a good-sized head of bright white froth. The retention is quite good, and although it drops it does maintain a thin surface covering through the first quarter of the glass. Lacing could be better, however, and it leaves only thin splashes here and there. The nose is bright with a judicious amount of yeasty phenolic and fruitiness (bubblegum, some plastic, soft dark berries, dark fruit skins) and a candyish and sugar-cookie dough like maltiness. It's surprisingly soft in the mouth with a full body and standard carbonation (one might expect a higher level in a tripel). The malt is rich and luxurious without being overly sweet, and the phenolic character (which adds a bit of spiciness here) really rounds it out and completes it. An undercurrent of grassy and leafy hops gives it even more depth. The bitterness is appropriately balancing, and in combination with the spiciness of the yeast it finishes drying despite all of the dextrins that are left in the mouth. It's quite nice and very enjoyable, and the excellent malt character present in all of the other Anderson Valley beers is still here, but it does fall short of the finest examples from Belgium."
"This brew appeared with an orange-brown color and came out without too much head. Nose was hops and sugary fruits. Taste was almost like sipping a liqueur. It was very alcoholic and sweet. Mouthfeel was somewhat full. Overall drinkability was not real great. Fun to sample once but one knows they are getting slammed by the alcohol."
"The beer after my struggle with the wax/plastic sealer sets in my special triple glass a luminous copper color with the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the color a light tan, as it erodes quickly, the residual lace is thin but covers the glass nonetheless. Nose has hints of plums, over ripe and sweet, nice malt presence, also some fusel alcohol with the start sweet, and the grain profile adequate, the top is light to moderate. Finish is pertinently acidic, the hop admirable in their spiciness, desert bone dry aftertaste, a drinkable beer with a nice tummy warming from the 10 percent ABV, but maybe its just me but I was expecting something more, as Anderson Valley is a long time favorite with me."
"I was not impressed by this one at all. And I was very supprised since I have liked everything that I have had from these guys so far. The apperance was a darkish gold that had no head at all to speak of. Even upon swirling nothing could be lifted from this one. The smell was very sweet and had lots of bananna scents in the mix. But the flavor was just a total letdown with way too much sweetness and an unrefined quality to the alchohol that is not too far removed from malt liquor. Good brewery, bad beer."
"Very sweet. Bright tropical fruit attack. Slightly herbal. Warming. Syrupy with very gentle carbonation that somehow seems fake."
"I'm not a fan of Anderson Valley beers, but so far this is one of there better brews. The color was of a deep golden yellow with a orange hue. The aroma was of sweet floral nature with a hint of citrusy orange. The flavor was a creamy balance of sweet and tartness, that wasn't all that bad. The flavor of citrus was pleasant enough, along with a hint of caramel. Overall not a really bad ale. I would buy it again, but not a first choice!"
"Poured a dark orange that resembled nothing of a tripel. Way too dark. The smell was ok, but didn't have that light fruity appeal of a normal Tripel. The flavor was sickeningly sweet and overpowering, lacking any fruitiness or spicyness like a good Tripel should have. Blah. The mouthfeelw as fine, but the high alcohlic presence really brought this one down. Dissapointing."
"Drinkability- This was one of the hardest beers for me to finish. Very different indeed. It started out good, but quickly got sickening sweet. A 4oz sampler would have been perfect."
"overall a decent brew, nothing outrageous that one would expect from such a great brewery. it hides the high alcohol decently (you do feel it warming the gullet) nothing to write home about and surely not in the class of belgian trips."
"Very drinkable for the style but not a session beer."
"Mouthfeel has to be the best effort here, thick and becoming."
"Bill was off right from the start, with the bartender sputtering something about Avery (hello Houston, we have a problem), but straightened things out pretty quickly and let it go. Filmy ghost of ultra, weight-loss thin sheeting that has little to no stick. Funky malt and candy drool on nose. Caramel on mouth almost overwhelms, while alcohol hits over the head like Popeye on spinach; volumatic contagion of fung casts a wide net and flim-flams the mouth."
"Wine like cherry gold appearance...very little head. Smell is fruity with yeast undertones...not bad, but not spectacular either. Taste is lightly fruity with some alcohol nortes, but not bad for a 10 abv. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet dry, probably this brew's most redeeming quality. Drinkability is decent for the high abv,,,,goes down smooth enough. A decent brew but nowhere near the quality of other trippels I have tried."
"No head on a pale transparent and unimpressive amber color body. The smell is very sweet, mostly apple with some banana and bubble gum notes and some cloves. Only slightly yeasty. The taste is sweet, with fruity esters of banana and apple and some light herbal notes. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for 10%. Slightly floury in the mouthfeel. This beer is very light bodied for a tripel. Pretty weak."
"Taste: Light carbonation, sweet maltyness with an obvious high octane punch. Blindfolded, I probably would not have guessed this was a tripel, too sweet, lacks a little effervescence and a little too much booze."
"This beer really falls flat for the style. Its like its missing something"
"Drinkability Â– This Anderson Valley offering is waaaay off of the true Abbey Tripel style but I kind of enjoyed it."
"As others have mentioned here, this Triple is not as good as one would expect from Anderson Valley. It's still not bad, and certainly doesn't deserve ratings of 2 to 3, but it doesn't hold a candle to other triples in it's price range (Allagash, New Belgium, Dark Horse, Unibroue, Avery). I wouldn't buy this one again, but it was interesting to try."
"Pours with a non-descript white head settling over clear deeply golden liquid. Strange metallic nose sensed after pouring, but disappeared after warming in the glass, replaced by some tropical/light banana yeasty character. The taste is quite good with rich maltiness, more tropical notes and a good balancing hop bitterness combining very nicely. Not much of the 10% alcohol is tasted at all. Finishes malty and rich, very drinkable and a well done take on the Tripel style"
"Pours a medium copper with a nice fluffy off-white head. Lots of tiny streaming bubbles. Mild aromas of candy sugar, pineapples, and bananas. Bananas lead the palate brigade, with candy sugar tagging along. Alcohol is noticable, but well-controlled. Mouthfeel is quite syrupy and thick, with little bitterness to offer another side of this beer. A drinkable beer, but a bit unbalanced for me. Too sweet with little contrasting brightness. Give it a try if you find it, but not really worth searching for."
"Overall the worst hing about this is the mouth feel...too overbearingly sweet...lacks complexity too....pretty average effort overall.."
"It lacks any sort of nuance or depth. Stark and naked, this fails on all accounts."
"Solid yeasty alcohol aroma, just perfect. Small off-white head never amounted to much and faded to nothing,not a trace anywhere, it's kind of weird. Flavor is kind of appley sweet up front, becomes a bit doughy towards the middle and the alcohol kicks in and takes it down to your stomach. Transparent, deep golden colored beer with streams of fine bubbles floating to the surface. I would definitely drink this beer again, but as far as triples go I'm not hooked."
"Kudos to the brewery for taking a shot at the style, but they didn't quite pull it off. Nice color, but far less carbonated than customary for the style. Would have seemed almost flat, but for the pepper lent by the alcohol. A good deal of caramel malt flavor gave the beer an unpolished, unfinished character. Nice yeast flavors, but at odds with the rough edges. I think they need to tinker with this beer a bit more."
"Very cool bottle with the wax on the top. Gives me a Maker's Mark feel. Pours a golden color with a tall head that has great retention and leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice - lots of spice and citrus. The flavor has a nice malt character and is quite spicy and a little peppery. I really enjoyed this beer and would have it again if not for the price."
"Thanks to clvand0 for bringing this beer over for me to try. This beer pours a beautiful golden amber color with 2 fingers of head that stick around. The nose has some good spicey characters from the yeast and really good orange tones from the malt. This smells divine after 2 weeks of Utah beers. The flavor is awesome. There is some peppery character along with the orange flavor in the malts. I like this beer. Its just a hint short on flavor, but not too shabby. The feel is moderate, right about where I want it to be. Shit man. This is 10%...they do hide the alcohol very very well. For a beer of this size, the drinkability is really good as well. A fine beer...very nice."
"What little head came from the pour dies down very fast. The beer comes out clear with an almost reddish tinge to it. Yeast alive and well in the smell. An easy goin' spice is noticed first. Backed by big malt charactar. Heavy on the palate and drinks quick."
"After reading all the bad reviews I baulked at trying this..but I found it Ok..maybe theres a bunch of bad batches out there?"
"Not for purists, but a fun one for the adventurous. Let it age, let it breath, and take it for what it is. Whatever that might be."
"Dry on the mouth and aftertaste. It is an easy sipping dubble. A tiny amount of alcohol presence just to let the drinker know it is there. This triple goes down smooth and easy. Maybe too easy. Don't drink too many. I enjoyed this beer."
"The sugars and malt keep the booze almost unnoticed at a stiff 10%. This characteristic seemed the most fitting holistically; the beer bubbles away into nothing, leaving you wanting a proper take on the style, or if time and place allows, a Hop Ottin'."
"I did in fact manage to finish this, but it was only my desire to get a bit of a buzz on before watching a bit of the idiot box that pulled me through. Quite a disappointment from an otherwise excellent brewery. I hold up hope that their Dubbel is of higher quality."
"Is it me, or is this just a jumbled up confused high alcohol mess???"
"Tap, Toronado, San Fransisco. Belgian style tripel, with the aromatics of a lot of American beers, lemony, with a yeasty Belgian character, pretty tasty stuff actually. Definitely a moe American influence triple, but it works quite nicely, not mindblowing, but nice."
"ng"
"The smell and taste, quite honestly, aren't much to speak of. There's nothing bad or offensive about them, they're just very plain and a little flat. Plenty of malt and some alcohol come through very clear. Some additional character would do wonders for this beer. This seems like a pretty average strong ale with the yeast swapped out for some of the belgian stuff. It's a little too sharp in the mouth; though I'm not having any problems downing this bottle."
"flavor is dark brown golden sugar with a slowly rising touch of cinnamon and allspice before dropping to low sweet finish"
"Anderson Valley is a great brewery, and Hop Ottin is awesome, but this one need some major work, or perhaps a very, very long nap!"
"Pours a brilliantly clear deep copper color and it topped by a tan head. The aroma is fairly clean, with notes of apple and alcohol dominating the nose. The nose seems to have a certain creamy richness to it. The taste is creamy and buttery as well, it is a bit off putting in some way. I get notes of vanilla, butter, and apples. This just does not do it for me, there is no one flavor that I can point to as the culprit, but as a whole it just is off. All the rest of their beers are incredible, this on the other hand just doesn't work, and is certainly not what I would call a Triple."
"Too bad on this one because AVB is a great brewery."
"The bottle I drank of Brother DavidÂ’s Triple showed no yeast residues at all. It tastes ultimately like a highfalutin malt liquor. Rather than being sealed in wax, this beer should be concealed in brown paper."
