"One of my all time favorites."
""
"On tap at Ashley’s Ann Arbor. Hazy golden with white foam that leaves rings. Aroma is banana, bubblegum, yeast, pepper, and clove. Taste is slightly sweet, strongly yeasty, gently bitter. Medium body, active carbonation, dry finish."
"Better with food, average drinkable alone."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice example of a tripel. Flavors are varied and balanced. Bold too but not overpowering or harsh. Nice combination of sweetness, spices and bitterness. Really, just well put together which makes drinkability stand out as well. Nicely done, Dragonmead."
""
"This one is my desert island beer."

"Great Trippel ale, first I had ever tried and still one of my favorites.  I've had from tap and bottle and both are great, recommend if you like trippel ales."

"O - Is this a mead, by definition? I dunno but it this is the most unique beer I've yet to review. Very sweet. This will make a great desert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very good American version."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a apricot in color with a good 2+ finger white foamy head that settles down to a good 4mm. Spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is very pleasant and is of bananas, cloves and citrus for the most part. Even more going on with the taste. Lots of sweetness is right up front with the above flavors with some honey, black licorice with a hint of coriander even. Not to sweet and this is a sipper with the high alcohol content that warms your tummy. Perfect carbonation and full bodied with lots of good flavor. Goes down fairly easy but take your time and enjoy."

"O- interesting American style Trippel. It's a little sweet for me but I love the complexity of Aroma and flavor"
""
"O: Very surprised by this one. I like it more than some Belgian trippels I’ve had from Belgium, though, this one is from Michigan. Its appearance, smell, taste, mouth feel, and overall impression put this one near the top of my list. Great stuff coming from Michigan! Found it in Saginaw at Opperman’s Cork-n-Ale."
""
"Over the years I have had various Dragonmead brews and have yet to be impressed. This is no exception."

"Overall – Overall a very tasty and quite nice drinking tripe that, while a bit on the sweeter side, was very balanced and smooth. Quite delicious and well worth a try if you get the chance."
""
""
"I'm no expert on trippels but this has a lot of interesting flavors and is well balanced if a tad sweet. The alcohol waits until you aren't looking and sneaks up on you."

"This is an absolutely great example of Trippel. Initial color is semi-opaque, dense yellowish; typical for a tripple. I can't fully comment on how it pours as it was on-top. Head was good and very aromatic. Taste is exceptionally sweet with citrus notes. Mouthfeel is decent and lingers notably. Overall, this is a great beer and one of my favorite trippels."
""
"Very, very malty with a nose only a mother could love. If you're into malty, sweet brews, this one is for you. Very smooth on the way down, almost gulpable. I found myself fairly full afterwards, but wanting more of that caramel, malty flavor. A delicious brew and fun to drink. I had it at HopCat, Lansing, MI, served in a belgian beer glass."
""
""
""
"Overall- I find tripels to be a boring style and this doesn't change that perception. Still a solid beer without any offensive characteristics that I didn't mind drinking"
"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color with a very slight and short lasting off white head. The smell is malty sweet with a bite of alcohol and a little yeast. The flavor follows suit. Quite sweet but tangy at the same time. Definite alcohol and yeast notes but we'll balanced by the sweet malts. This is a well crafted Belgium style ale but I ask...why buy an American alternative to the classic style when there are so many perfect examples coming straight from the original source. Just my opinion."
""
"An excellent tripel. Definitely on the sweet side, but with enough dryness to balance it out. Delicious."

"12 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 8/16/2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden orange color with a small foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, pear, apple, grape, banana, clove, pepper, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, bread, honey, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately crisp and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great tripel! All around great complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"The body is smooth, with a soft but firm crispness. It's creamy, with a light to medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very tasty, and if it didn't say Tripel, I would have just chalked this up to a very good Belgian pale ale. Alcohol is very well hidden. I would not mind at all having another but as a proper Tripel should, the alcohol will sneak up on you and let you know it's there by the end of the second glass. Good overall beer, but the appearance was a disappointment - it should have had better lacing and head."

"overall: Probably my favorite American take on a trappist style trippel. While not equal to any Belgian equivalent, this is a damn good beer. Well balanced, refreshing, with a nice sour/fruity presence that adds some zest to the normal bready trippel style. My favorite offering from Dragonsmead, a quality brew that I will buy again. Pretty hard to find, even in SE Michigan."

"overall- excellent beer. a good tripel that is drinkable and enjoyable. a semi-common beer at the more multi-tap-like places in my area and a beer that i find myself revisiting a lot. definitely worth a shot to anyone who is a fan of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Rather one dimensional... reminiscent of New Belgium's Trip... clove and spicy sweet fruit, good not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good Tripel. The alcohol was masked well. Dragonmead website has this listed at 10%. BA has it at 8.5%. I say it's around 9.5%. I will be stocking 4-packs of this throughout the summer. Good representation of the style"
""
""
"Final Absolution is a good American Triple, however, I was expecting a little more from Dragonmead. It has a way to go to compete with the top shelf Triples."
"A nice Tripel, but not one I would seek again. Thanks, Adam for sharing..."
"O: Can't believe this is from Warren, this is an excellent fall beer, and a great Trippel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. A very fruity beer, but still a great one that I'd gladly have again. Though its looks are very unremarkable, what matters the most is the taste, and this tastes VERY good, in my opinion. Just beware of the ABV ... I didn't realize it was so high. Oops."
""
"On tap in a pint glass at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. Pours clear golden with small head for a Trippel. Aroma of yeast, spice, pears, honey. Tastes follows with a sweet honey pear flavor with a little belgian spice. One the sweet and heavy side for the style, but that's not surprising given the 10% abv. Overall I was impressed with this one and it is one of my favorite in the style."
""
""
""
"O: This is an easy drinking beer that goes down smooth for the ABV, almost too smooth! Taste is good, and although not necessarily something I'll seek out on a regular basis, I'd gladly drink one again."
""
"Had both in many bottles and on tap many times and the Town Pump bar in Detroit. Pours a somewhat hazy, golden-amber color; heavy cloudiness in the middle, fairly volatile with a large, foamy white head that dissipates surprisingly quick. The aroma is great - baskets of sweet, earthy esters, spicy Belgian yeast and bread, clove, white pepper, phenol alcohol, bananas, apple skins, pears, and a nice whiff of bubble gum. The taste is no slouch, either. Final Absolution hits the palate soft and slightly silky, medium-bodied and with a high amount of carbonation. Belgian yeast flavors - bready, spicy clove, pepper, banana esters, earth, and bubble gum - dominate the palate. Some floral and perfume-like hop notes hit up front with a very short and sweet bitterness that quickly gives way to the rest of the flavor profile. The aftertaste is heavy on the bread and yeast flavors, like you would expect from any decent Tripel."
"Cloudy golden pour, huge frothy head, very fine lacing. Smells of almond, tangerine and cream. Taste is much of the same with some additional almond and wheat flavors. Excellent brew, my first Trippel, and a fine Belgian. Wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again."
""
"About as good a tripel as I have ever had. Certainly the best I have made in Michigan, and unless I am forgetting one, the best I have had made in the U.S. I honestly believe it competes favorably with La Fin Du Monde for the best tripel made in NA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice take on the style and a very tasty brew. Nice local option when I'm in the mood foe a tripel."
""
"Oh, get back on your feet carefully after a couple of these."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. Belgian styles are usually not my favorite but this one was pretty good with lots of unique flavors. I would recommend it."
"O - My first DragonMead beer. The aroma is great and flavors are a complex mix of tart and sweet. This is probably the best tripel I have had in my limited experience with the style with the possible exception of La Fin Du Monde. Highly recommended."
""
"The beer was poured into a snifter from the bottle. A cloudy gold color was observed during the pour with hints of banana growing during the pour. The banana scent is a reflection of the Belgian yeast that is very apparent in the scent and taste. The initial taste was a pleasantly tart banana taste that danced along the sour borders of the tongue. A hint of spice may be observed by some during the initial sip. In the aftertaste, a hint of butterscotch becomes somewhat apparent but the banana continues. The trippel is smooth yet thick enough to stick to the tongue and allow the taste to linger. As the alcohol warms on the way down the gullet, it becomes apparent that the beer looks, tastes, and feels good."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth, with carbonation that’s both zesty and mild at the same time, a medium body and a funky finish that has a bready sweetness to it, which allows the ABV to peek through; well balanced and extremely drinkable for this style, this was a very good beer and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured quite cloudy, despite my careful decanting, as there was a good quarter inch of sediment on the bottom. There was definitely a yeasty sourness to both the aroma and taste. The sourness ends up accenting the strong but well balanced malt and hops. On the whole, this tastes more like a strong farmhouse ale than a tripel, and although it's not my favorite style, this is one of the best examples I have tried."

"D: All ingredients are in a fine balance and this beer really surprised me for it's many fine qualities like, aroma, flavor and superb mouthfeel. Alcohol is where it should be for this style and not overwhelming. if you see this one out there do try it!!"
""
"This is a pretty good tripel from a brewery I'm totally unfamiliar with. It doesn't strike me as top-notch, but if I saw it on tap and was in the mood for a tripel, I would have it again. I'm curious to try more brews from Dragonmead."

"O - I enjoyed to olfactory and taste aspects of this beer. It was a nice spicy smack in the mouth before going to a family dinner."
""
""
""
""
"That concludes my reviews of Dragonmead beers I collected during my recent Michigan trip. I would put Dragonmead on the 2nd tier of Michigan breweries. Consistancy seems to be their issue and that is probably the case with this beer."
"O: Really nice Trippel. I love this style, and this is a great addition to the already great repertoire...."
"O: A good tripel, overall. The yeast characters are a bit too strong and it's slightly too thick for my tastes, but still good."
"Pours a yellowish-orange w/ a nice two finger head. Good carbonation and lacing. On the light side for the style, but still a nice looking tripel. Nose is fruit, banana, spice, yeast, malt. Very pleasant, although not quite up to the best Belgian tripels. Taste is the same profile. It's a nice beer, just not a 'great' beer. I'd like a little more complexity w/ this one. Feel is good- although I'd like it to be a little smoother, too much carbonation. Overall, I liked this one- it's just not world class. Still, I'd have it again."
"Overall -- not a terrible version of a triple, but nowhere near my favorites of the style."
"Final Absolution is my first beer from Dragonmead Microbrewery. For an American Tripel, it really is pretty impressive. It’s not quite on par with the elite Tripels out there, but it’s definitely good. Its biggest problems are that it’s overly sweet and a little too boozy in flavor. Other than that, it really does perform pretty well. If you’re in a pinch for a pretty solid Tripel, Final Absolution is worthy of your attention."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve enjoyed sipping this one. Each sip leaves me so ready for another and I’ll be happy to have this beer again in the future. My overall impression is that this is a very well made beer which is deserving of its awards and is an outstanding beer that is a nice expression of a Belgian style."
"Medium mouthfeel and very little alcohol presence. Solid tripel and one I would gladly have again."
"Seems to have a bit heavier body, or perhaps the carbonation is not as strong compared to others in the style. The fruity notes go very well with the character the yeast is contributing. Very enjoyable."
"The beer appeared a nice golden color with hints of orange with a nice white head that dissipated too quickly. The aroma was sweet and spicy as a good Belgian should be. The taste follows the nose well, but with a distinct banana and spice notes. There was also a slight pepper flavor that appeared during the beer. The beer was very smooth and easy to drink. The beer had a moderate mouth feel and good carbonation. Overall, a very fine brew and one that I hope to enjoy again."
"Dragonmead. Yes. I've had a small handful of their beers. I only get to try them once a year in July. Next year I need to hit their pub. Dragonmead is an extremely solid, unappreciated brewery in MI, a state FULL of extremely solid, unappreciated breweries."
"The Dragonmead footprint seems small, and that is a shame. In my opinion, this is a candidate for Michigan's top beer. Go get."
"This is very smooth drinking, the carbonation is just about perfect for the style. Medium to light bodied and just damn tasty. Belgian ales are usually sweet and spicy, the flavors are what make this style and final absolution doesn't fall short within this category. If you happen to come across one of these pick it up, dragonmead has done an awesome job replicating the flavor profile of a classic trippel."
"Taste - Banana, spice, subtle bitterness. Finish is dry with a little bit of honey aftertaste."
"Overall, this is a fine brew, one of the better American tripels I've had, but not to the level of some of the Belgians. Still, there's no shame in that. I passed a bottle of this around at DLD and people had the same impression. A nice, under the radar brew that probably deserves a little more love than it gets."
"Overall: I used to be big on Tripels, but perhaps my tastes are changing; either that, or it tastes super-different on tap. Either way, I think it's just slightly above average for a tripel. Not bad, but I won't go out of my way to try it again."
"Good, to be sure, but definitely not great."
"The smell is pretty neutral, not much going on in the nose. The taste is somewhat sweet and some pineapple/banana comes around. This beer has a full taste and it is very worth trying+++"
"Drinkability: I think this beer is good but not great. I don't know that I'll search it out again."
"This is an amazing beer, in fact, I have brewed a clone of this I like it that much. It is suprisingly smooth for the alcohol content and isn't too sweet. It is not heavy or overpowering. I have turned many people on to this beer - its great that you can also get it bottled."
"Part of a beer score of Michigan brews graciously bequithed upon me by relatives visiting at Christmastime, let's give it a whirl. At first glance I see it is bottle conditioned as it has yeast on the bottom, give a swirl and let it rest a bit as to avoid playing ""beer hunter"". Popping the top of this brew it smells, well, yeasty. Also very malty with hints of licorice, spices and candies. Pours to a cloudy yellow orange with a fizzy off white head that recedes quickly. I'm letting it warm a bit as this is one I don't want to drink too cold. On the first sip the first standout is mouthfeel. Mouthfeel is like syrup with a fizziness that adds to flavor. The flavor is sweet at the start almost citrus like but then quickly shifts to a sour tartiness that then transitions into a slightly bitter finish. There is some warming but for the most part the high AC isn't readily evident. This is a very tasty brew, that will, without a doubt, knock your socks off."
"Overall, an very good brew that deserves to be tried if you get the opportunity."
"Overall I thought this was a good tripel, it wasn't mind blowing by any means but it was a nicely balanced tripel. I would not turn down a chance to have this brew again. I hope to try to some more dragonmead beers in the future."
"Reviewed on 6/19/2010. On tap at the brewery. Pours a cloudy lime yellow with a ring of white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast and spices (especially clove). Flavor is again mostly Belgian yeast with lots of spices and some bready malt. An ok Belgian but not very trippel-esque actually without the usual fruity undertones."
"Final Absulution has an opaque butterscotch color with bits of sentiment floating around in it. A thin yet frothy head quickly fizzed away. The smells are sweet, fruity, and almost waxy like. It has a light and creamy fruity and nutty taste to it. The beer does well in masking the alcohol with flavor. A top choice for me."
"The mouthfeel was medium/light with enough carbonation."
"This is the tastiest tripel I've had. I'd love to stock my fridge with this stuff. Better still, the brewery is 5 miles away."
"Notes: not a bad beer just not a huge fan of this style of beer. Worth trying but I probably wont go out of my way to try it again."
"This may be a bad bottle. I'll have to try this again to be sure. My ratings appear to be out of sync with the mainstream on this one."
"In conclusion; in my experience if you want a good trippel, look to the Belgians, or at least Unibroue. This is a good effort however, and certainly not a bad beer - no off flavors or any major complaints."
"Pretty damn spot-on, especially for an American brewer. Many tend to allow their Tripels to finish way too sweet and often fruity, and not so Belgian. We'll gladly light our hands on fire for another."
"Bottle. Pours a clear golden straw color with a collared white head. Fairly effervscent. Belgian yeast characteristics in the nose through and through. Sweet smelling with banana and clove. Pretty smooth tasting as well. Sweet up front with flavors of banana, clove, and some spice. Finishes with a lingering belgian yeast taste. Overall, not bad at all in my opinion."
"Overall, a pretty average tripel. Maybe a bit above average. Decent drinkability. Nothing really out of the ordinary here."
"I really enjoyed this offering on my trip into the midwest."
"Conclusion: Really glad to finally get to try a Dragonmead beer! This one is not a bad tripel, but New Belgium's has a bit more character/depth than this for less money (and it's available here)."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol content brings this down the slightest notch for me. Other than that, this beer is excellent."
"D - The clove is a bit dominate for me but the light crisp and very refreshing aspects of the beer kick up the drinkability."
"D- Very refreshing and tasty, easily drinkable."
"I have been drinking this beer on tap for several years, never had it in a bottle, but have never been disappointed and recommend it regularly to others."
"This Final Absolution we can classify under the category of after-meal dessert beer. I can't see myself drinking more than one at a time until they start serving them in 20oz glasses (in which I am about to blow through a Founders Breakfast Stout) and lower the prices. It was a good experience, but I'll probably only experience this Dragonmead concoction at a tasting in the future."
"Not the most well balanced Belgian Trippel Ive had, but a solid example nontheless. Im a big fan of Dragonmead, just not my fav of their brews."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. You can not taste a whiff of the 8.5%."
"This beer poured a cloudy light amber color and formed a off white bubbly head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, banana, spices and Belgian yeasts. The flavor was of malt, bread, and a bit of butter. The body was medium and the finish was slightly sprite. This is not a bad trip, just a shame I have to go to Michigan to get it."
"D Good. 4.0"
"Okay, for 8.50%abv, this is very drinkable. I can't detect the abv, at all. It's very tasty and smooth. This presumes that you don't mind sweeter, not so hoppy beers, though."
"Drinkability: Quite a different take from many Belgian versions of the style, this is still a very nice beer with its own character; unlike some American tripels that are too one-dimensional with tons of alcohol, this one has some subtlety and complexity; this one has aged about a year and clearly benefited from that time in the bottle"
"D= I liked this tripel alot, mostly due to its complexity of flavor. Without that, this beer would be a bit too sweet, but the spicy character really makes this ale shine. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!"
"(D)- An interesting and slightly bizarre triple that definitely has some funk with that strange apple presence. Could be young, could be too old, I have no idea. Tastes fine, but not what I would normally expect from what a Triple normally is."
"12oz. Pour reveals a tangerine ale topped with a thin white head. Aromas are fruity Belgian yeast, hints of apricot, pear, apple, with some faint alcohol. Tastes are fruity and spicy Belgian yeast, alcohol prickles on the tongue along with some peppery notes and a slight mandarin orange along with notes of ethanol. Overall, not a bad Belgian Trippel. I guess you could say that there's nothing too wrong with it, but nothing great about it either."
"I have never had it in a bottle so I cannot speak to that, however on tap or from a freshly filled Growler this beer is on of my favorites."
"I truly enjoyed this brew and look forward to trying more from this brewery."
" "
"This isn't bad but there are many much better Tripels out there."
"It's a solid American take on the tripel, but just not a style I'd seek out."
"Drinkability- Not bad. Like I said I'm not the hugest fan of the style but I do appreciate Trippels for what they are. This one is definitely on the better side as American interpretations go. Definitely worth a try if given the opportunity."
"On tap at the wonderful Hopcat in Grand Rapids during my business trip to the area in March. Served in a Hopcat-labeled tulip glass. Very citrusy aroma. On the house due to my purchase of a 750ml of Shorts Imperial Black Cherry Porter. Some sticky lacing after each pull. Typical wheat color for the style. A nice brew. Drinkable."
"A very well done beer for a style that has no defining characteristic(s)."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"D: I would not turn one down, but I wouldn't drink too many (sweetness factor is a bit much)."
"Had this on tap. Small head when brought to the table. Big lacing. A little cloudy and orangish in color. Aroma is sweet and spicy as is the flavor. A little malty as well. I thought the bitterness was light to medium, the spice good and the sweetness a little strong. Too sweet for my tastes. Medium bodied. Slightly peppery. It does have a nice, dry, well carbonated feel and the aftertaste was pleasant and didn't linger."
"Nothing overwhelming or unique about this one, but I am enjoying it. As solid an example of a trippel as I've had."
"Smooth and crisp finish, and highly drinkable at 8.5% ABV."
"Cloudy orange yellow color. Small bubbles, foamy white head. Sweet Floral aroma, cloves, light fruity smell. Soft, nut taste, floral & sweet. Light orange. Spices aftertaste. Clove maybe. Deliciousness."
"One finger white head on initial pour, falls quick to a haze over the opaque orange body. Big soapy bubbles sit in random spots over the body. Smell is overly malty, not really appealing in my opinion. Taste is nice and sweet up front, bitter on the back, some banana and bubble gum too. Whoa, am I drinking a hefe? I remember this tasting okay on draught at the brewpub, this isn't working it for me. Alcohol starts to come through mid way down, and even though this is almost balanced I don't think I'd go out of my way for this one again."
"This isn't the best tripel that I've ever had but at $10.99 for a four pack it's definitely the most affordable. If you like tripels you should try to pick this one up."
"This beer pours beautiful even if the taste didn't match up it still might be worth it. It ahs a radiant orange hue mixed with a bit of straw. The smell is floral up front with citrus back. It tastes just a bit below how it looks. A touch of bitterness on the finish makes this beer a near perfect brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and champagne like. Overall, I say, try it. Enjoy it."
" The aroma has an agreeable yeasty quality that gives off sents of banana, spice, and clove. Actually a little spicy (pepper,maybe ginger too). Soft notes of citrus. Quite pleasant once it warms,at first I thought it may just taste like Heff by the aroma witch im not really a fan of. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and only mildly drying on the finish. Slightly grainy at times. A pleasing aftertaste that lingers. The taste is of dried citrus peel and banana, clove, coriander, pepper and other like spices. A little grain,and sweet malts. This brew is way better at almost room temp ."
"D - Still a sipper, but higher drinkability than average. Not overly loaded with flavour (for trippel), but nice balance, and very smooth."
"Pretty average in flavor and aroma for an American interpretation, but quite sub-par with the carbonation level and poor appearance."
"D- Well balanced and complex very easy to drink."
"I think some critters got in this bottle and affected it a bit. I certainly enjoyed the funky aroma, but it slightly changed the flavor from its intended result. Not bad, I would like to try it again perhaps..."
"Had on tap in Okemos. Looks good; cloudy deep golden yellow with a nice small but thick white head. Lots of carbonation rises languorously to the top. Smell is sharp citrus peel, white pepper, and wet straw. Taste is sour sugary grapefruit, with more pepper, some spicy coriander notes. A tripel, but heavy laces with Belgian wit qualities. Alcohol is imperceptible. Good mouthfeel. Great beer overall."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow/light amber color with 1 finger of foamy white head. Average retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of barnyard funk, bananas, clove, peppery spices, and fruits like apples and pears. Tastes of apples and spices up front followed by banana, clove, honey, and yeasty bread malt. Finishes with some peppery spices and alcohol kick. Medium in body with low carbonation, smooth and creamy but also having a crisp finish and a nice bite. A very easy drinking tripel with great fruity flavors but not tasting too much of alcohol."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are several other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and creamy with a bit of sharpness to it as well. The graininess comes through quite a bit on the finish and the alcohol is a bit too pronounced in my opinion, making it a little harder to fully enjoy the brew. Overall, this one failed to really wow me, I'd probably choose another Dragonmead offering before this next time."
"D: The first I have had of tripel belgians but this is really good. I would definitely have it again. Just from sampling this beer is going to cause me to travel to the brewery! Highly recommended, although drinking the 4 from the box might be a challenge due to the 10%..."
"This is one of the best American Tripels I've had, with some lively flavors and an unbelievable drinkibility for a 9% beer. This was the gem of our visit when we checked out this surprising gem of a brewpub."
"D- This will get you, it goes down really smooth. It has a nice sweet finish and no bitterness."
"Overall: A wonderful American Trippel. Nice sweet fruity yeasty flavors that leave me yearning for more. Very good, very drinkable...I wish I had regular access to this one."
"D- This was an excellent beer. I havent had a tripel in a while and this one definitely hit the spot. Great one to sip on."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: An excellent style representation, the noticeable alcohol keeps the drinkability down somewhat, but this is a very, very nice beer. Paired beautifully with a penne carbonara dish I had prepared. Recommended!"
"Overall: Fairly good, but not top-class. I'd like to see a creamier mouthfeel and a slightly dryer finish."
"Drink this stuff."
"D - great example of the tripel style; I would swear this was made in Belgium if I didn't know better"
"Taster's Note: *Special thanks to arrogantbastard1 for procuring a bottle!"
"M&D - slightly fizzy so its lively on the tongue, but smooth and inviting as you finish the taste, well-crafted, their flagship beer and not a bad foot to put forward, imho"
"This Dragonmead offering sounds like the title of the ultimate workout DVD. ""Drinking too many six-packs? Beer belly getting you down? Get 'six-pack' abs in mere minutes a day by using 'Final Ab... solution'. Okay, maybe not. Final Absolution is good, solid beer that still doesn't come within sniffing distance of Allagash Tripel Reserve for the title of Best American tripel."
"D- The yeasty fruit flavors are a bit overpowering but the sweetness blends well with the softer hops."
"This is a great American draft at the tripel. I still maintain the American renditions can't quite compare exactly to the Belgian originals. This is quite a lovely ale though, true to style, and wonderfully brewed. I would place as one of the top US tripels. Thanks Dad for picking this one up!"
"Merchant's in Dearborn, purchased about ten days ago. Poured a murky, cloudy golden with orange / tangerine flashes. Generous small bubble carbonation. It sure smells like a Belgian Trippel, yeast is very up front with citrus and orange peel. The taste is a fruity marmalade, orange and lemon rind presence with hints of all spice, paprika, more fruit rind in the finish. Went flat after a short time but the taste got more intense as it warmed with more fruit, bitter, slightly acidic taste and mouthfeel but the alcohol also got more pronounced too. Overall, this is a great example of a Belgian Trippel and I'll have to get more of this next time I'm in the area."
" I will not be buying this again. If someone offers a freebie I'll taste a bit to ensure this wasn't just a fluke bad bottle."
"Not exactly what I expect from a tripel, but who cares when the beer tastes as good as this?"
"D - A good triple. I really enjoyed this beer, and would have it again."
"Pours a dark, hazy gold color, with just a bit of slightly off-white head. Smell is slightly fruity (grape, plum maybe?), with some spicy notes and an overall sweet scent. Taste follows very closely with the plum flavor coming out more, a bit of clove-like spice, and a definite sweetness. Mouthfeel is very heavy, almost like cough syrup. Drinkability is ok, though between the heaviness and the high ABV, it's far from something you'd want to do all night. All in all, a very nice beer."
"Drinkability.... VERY NICE! I could get used to this... should have brought a growler home with me.... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Pours orange, mostly clear in my goblet. streams of little bubbles rising to the surface and forming a little covering of a head. odor is spicey and old bananas. flavor is assertive citrus and banana flavors with some coriander and cloves thrown in. well balanced and well made representation of the style. Seems like DM is really making CRAFTbrews."
"D - An average tripel that I probably will not try again."
"D- The sweetness of this kind of got to me. I don't really feel it was worth the money I paid for it, but hey, what can you do?"
"D: The alcohol, other than a slight hint in the nose, is very well hidden. This is very balanced and makes for a fine Tripel to sip on."
"I'm at a point where this is nearly the only tripel I'll go out of my way for. It's amazing... and anyone lucky enough to be able to get it on tap is just that... LUCKY! I'll keep drinking this as long as Dragonmead is brewing."
"Flavor is quite nice. More malty sweet than candy sweet, except for a lemon candy thing goin on. Also, am I picking up what (both in the flavor and texture)? Lots of citrus, especially as the beer warms--both citrus and orange. Medium to full mouth that wantsw to be sticky. Not sure what, but there is something missing to really puch this beer's score up."
"Golden yellow body with straw edges, lotsa bubblies. Ample cushion of thick, slightly rocky, off-white head. Nose shows bubble gum, fruity esters, banana, lots of tropical fruits, yeasty bread, and spicy, peppery hops. Nice, if not a bit too bubble gummy. Sweetish, candyish tropical fruit cocktail up front. Light booziness, plenty sweet. Honeyish too. Peppery spice and yeast before a tangy yeast and Saaz-esque hop finish. Sugary malt lingers. Warming me up a little too! Full-bodied, rocky, lively carbonation. Syrupy finish. Not a bad American tripel at all! Nice job."
"this is my second review of this beer. i do think it has a better taste on tap, but its not bad in the bottle. just remember to let it warm up a little and that dry carbonation funk flavor goes away."
"Tried to go over a few times to make sure of my solid 4 rating for each category, but did not change. Ends up a ""good"" beer. Must say that my memory of drinking it off the tap at their brew pub seemed much better."
"I poured this twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. With and agressinve pour I got a nice head topping a couldy amber body. Nice and sweet with a bit of citrus, slight hop at the end. Very smooth. The aftertaste is a bit acidic, slight pepper and spice. Soft on the pallate, proper carbonation. Enjoyable, would buy again."
"a decent brew, with some real shining points. not a tripel i would revisit."
"Taste; wow, the bananas stand out even more in the flavor. The cloves and bubblegum flavors are there as well, but not quite as strongly as the bananas. I'm getting a little bit of a pepper, and candied sugar with a little orange peel thrown in the mix. Did I mention bananas yet? Moutheel is thick and a touch on the syrupy side. Drinkablility is also really good, with only a little bit of alcohol present. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Notes: I enjoyed this one quite a bit. It was very drinkable and seemed close to what I interpret to be the style."
"The body is fairly full. Good balance between an initial sweetness fading into a nice dry finish. Not a bad tripel, but certainly not one of the better ones I've had."
"On tap at the brewpub, a most interesting place. The highest recommended to me. Lots of lace, cloudy orange and white ring head. Decent body, suitable though aggressive carbonation. Some fruitiness. Yeasty aroma.On sweet side, sugar, and also spiciness."
"D - Interesting take on the tripel style; much darker and maltier than any other tripel I've had. However, it still manages to retain the overall character of a good Belgian tripel."
"Pours a hazy deep dull orange. Very dark for a tripel. Modest white head, a little less than i generally expect from a tripel. Banana pudding aromas leap from the glass, backed with spice. Starts off on the palate with a truckload of munich malts, quite sweet, but quickly shifts gears and fleshes out into some pear, light apply and grapefruit characteristics, banana not nearly as evident in the mouth. Suggestions of some pith. Peppery throughout with a fairly dry finish. Body is very heavy for a tripel and the carbonation a little lighter than normal. Unfortunately i like my tripels feather light and cottony. Drinkability is ok. This is definitely a different take on a tripel, not bad at all, but not one of my favorites."
"Amber. Phenolic, fruity and spicy aroma with hints of sugars, banana, clove, cinnamon and ginger. Again, very phenolic and a rather typical creation that shows a lot of fruity esters, banana, clove and fruits. Yeasty as hell and the hops are quite spicy in their lingering bite. Sugary. Good stuff."
"Think with not very much carbonation, has some fruity esters in there, has a spicy kick to it as well. The 8.5% alcohol warms up the mouth and throat. Pretty complex brew with loads of flavors for the palate. This is my first of the style and will be pursuing many more."
"had this a little while ago. sampler from the brewery. poured copper with a light off white head that left some lacing. aroma, citrus, yeast, over ripe banana, cloves, hints of alcohol.flavor, the cloves and banana comes out first than got a nice taste of alcohol about the same. not to bad"
"Drinkabaility, well this isn't my cup of beer, as it were. This is too sweet and unbalanced for me. The bubble gum/banana cream was too much."
"A pleasure to consume in moderation. A loss of control would most likely not be in order. A good remedy for a rare craving of this nature. 'Twould not be a bad idea to have it close at hand for a moment of need. "" 'Tis better to curse the darkness than to light thy hand on fire."" Hmm. Okay. Alright. Talked me outta that hand lighting I had planned. Damn the darkness!"
"Quite drinkable for 8.5% ABV"
"Mouthfeel is zesty, creamy and full bodied with a sugary, yeasty, Belgian candy sugar standing out. Not too friggin shabby."
"Full bodied and greasy with alcohol, this is an aggressive beer."
"This is a very enjoyable tripel. The booze is warming, but subdued enough to let the malts and spice come through. Complex and well-balanced."
"A good American-made trippel. Solid on all accounts and quite a night maker at the pub!"
"Nice full mouthfeel that seeks out every part of my mouth, but doesn't leave anything awkward in its wake. Quite drinkable despite the abv."
"A pretty good Tripel. Complicated enough and well made with that certain American playfulness that suits its character. Thanks tr!"
"Pours crystal clear orange color with a creamy looking white head that dissipates slowly. Sweet malty and fruity aroma with a slight clove/coriander/spice character. Medium body, good carbonation, sweet malty background with a moderate fruity flavor and warming alcohol feeling. The light bitterness and spices balance out the maltiness and the candi sugar sweetness quite well. Not to miss for trippel fanatics!"
"Nice. Poured out to a golden amber color with a nice foamy head that held up well. Some lace noted around the glass. Scent of spices and pine are noted as well as some sweetness. Traces of hops and an almost vinegar like character were also noted. Flavor was complex, with overtones of caramel, clove, spice, hops and a good kick of alcohol. Finished with a syrupy like taste and feel. Kind of weird. Still, its a well made beer, but on the expensive side for what you get. Recommended for trippel fans."
"Pours a golden amber with a slight head. Aroma reeks of malt with some acidic green apple notes, alcohol, and faint bananas. Taste is very rich malts enfused with bitter green apples. Although there is some subtle bananas, the apples really come though. An interesting take on the trippel style, although I'm not sure I really like it. Alcohol is present in the flavor, but to a small degree. Mouthfeel is kinda thin, nothing too interesting. Overall, the flavor is pretty acidic, on account of the apples. It diminishes the drinkability. Not sure if I would pick this one up again, but it was interesting nonetheless."
"Slàinte!"
"It poured a golden body topped with a white head that hung around and left little lace. It has a bready smell with spices of pepper, alcohol, sugar, clove and ginger. The taste is of a sweet triple ladden with spices in the nose the alcohol carries slightly into the finish and follows with the yeast flavor. The body is thickish but I enjoyed it and I could have several more of these."
"Pours a deep copper, much darker than most trippels I have encountered before. Stick, yet small bone white head. Aromas of candy sugar, bananas and pineapple. Sweet malt and sugary palate. Again, bananas show up in the finish. A very pleasing palate. Well done. Coating, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Thankfully, the good carbonation prevents it from being too thick. A nice beer. I hope this brewery's other offerings are just as good. Definately worth a try. Thanks to Realale for this opportunity."
"Middle weight on the body, but nice for the style while the drinkability is quite good as well, tasty offering, an American Tripel which doesn't resort to overhopping."
"Nearly clear, golden colour with a thin, long-lasting white head. Very mild sweet/fruity (banana) aroma with a light spiciness. The flavour was quite complex, with ripe fruit, spice and belgian candy sugar all coming to the forefront at different times. A light alcohol flavour was also perceived, but was not strong and didn't detract from the other flavours. Lightly carbonated, medium/heavy body and very smooth texture. Quite a decent beer with a nice balance."
"12 oz. bottle brought back from Michigan from BA pals cupbeerman and beergeek279. Pours a deep orange copper color with a short-lived tan head. Very decieving, colorwise, for a tripel. Nose is very sweet and tropical, like Swedish fish candy. No hops discernable. Phenolic and estery. Fusels meld the taste with the aroma. Reminiscent of Heavyweight's Lunacy Grand Cru a little bit. Further notes of tropical fruits; papaya, banana, kiwi and mango and a good dosage of clove. Good, but flawed a bit by its synthetic, tropical taste for it being classified as a tripel. Healthy carbonation. A little too amber tasting for what I like in a tripel-style Belgian; it's missing that dryness I so yearn for."
"Served from a 12oz bottle, sent to me courtesy of trbeer. Color is a fuzzy deep orange, just a bit hazy, graced with just wisps of thin white head. Aroma is very sweet and full of peach and fruit esters. Taste is initially fruity and just a bit bitter, then becomes very sweet and malty through the middle, nice caramel flavor. Alcohol was noticeable but not overpowering throughout. Finish brings out the barest hint of peppery spice, as well as a slight bit of banana and some of the bitterness comes back to wrap it up. Hops make anice appearance in this tripel. Body is quite full, but a nice dryness in the finish as well. Very enjoyable."
"Thanks inebrius."
"This is very similar to how I remember it on tap, however, it seems the coriander is more pronounced, the alcohol is more evident, and the finish is spicier. Still, a very fine brew despite the hefty price tag. I would drink more of this if it were available in my area."
"Plantains, iguana food, banana bread, banana candy, banana syrup, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecans and spice. Chardonnay from the desert. Alcohol fuels the beer - nail polish-like. Banana cereal. Banana peels. Caramel covered bananas and caramel covered apples. Thick, clean, slightly bitter on the finish, and very sticky."
"Very good brew... hard to drink a bunch just because of the high alcohol content. Very smooth finish and overall a very satisfying brew."
"Thanks to CRJM for the bottles!"
"Thanks to trbeer for the bottle. This reminds me a lot of the young Great Lakes Anniversary Ale....the bubblegum/cotton candy sugar sweetness is quite nice. Quite good, and one I hope to have again."
"Mouthfeel not quite as lively as other Trippels but very drinkable beer."
"675"
"Smooth, hard water mouthfeel, a bit thick-ish. Plenty of tea-like sweetness and herbal character, backed by a dominant, and aggressive spicy/yeast character, more pepper, phenols and faint grass that rounds the soft bitterness. Warming alcohol presence. Some toasted malts, caramel and blossom honey characters are also present. More clove. Bubblegum flavours pull through as the beer warms, toward the end, where the beer finishes with yeast residuals. Pretty decent tripel, complex and tasty."
"I heard that they only bottled a few cases of this so I guess that I am lucky for being able to get it. Anyways this was one solid tripel but its flavors were slightly immature. Definitely a strong yeast precense and the yeast strain was excellent and made the beer what is was. The other flavors were very fruity and strong banana flavor at that. The banana flavor was almost too strong. I also noticed some grape flavor and plums. Slightly bready and slightly bitter in the finish. This beer was well carbonated and had a nice slick mouthfeel. All in all a good beer but definitely could use some aging to mellow that banana flavor."
"Soft mouthfeel with almost no carbonation. A finely crafted version of the tripel style and one I am glad they started bottling. Thanks to trbeer for the personal delivery."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized bubbles that left a fair lacing and had a cloudy orange brown body. It had a fruity aroma with an apricot flavor which was not greatly to my liking. We had this brew at the Festival in Frankenmuth Michigan."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured with a small head that unfortunately dissolved quickly. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer. It had a very cloudy appearance to it. The aroma was fruity in my opinion. This brew was not to my liking."
"A truly wondeful beer. Sampled several times over at the Polar Beer Fest. A nice presence of clove, nutmeg and pepper spice up this yeasty, malty treat. This is a liquid meal that is filling and satisfying. Complex and delicious. A beer to have when you are having one. Well-done."
"Amber/orange-ish color. Big fruit, jungle banana aroma. Tastes more or less the same. Very candied sugar sweet. For the strength, not too overwhelmingly alcoholic -- though it's definitely there in abundance. Drinkability is only hampered by the fact that after 2-3 of them and no food, you're in the bag already. :)"
"ABV = 8.5%..   Darker than I was expecting. Malty aroma and a noticeable fruity clove yeast aftertaste. Candy sugar is also quite noticeable in the taste. This is one alcohol laden, STRONG beer.  Whew!  Makes you sweat after 2 pints..."
"This monumental Belgian representation combines a sweet light ester quality with a bold, but uncannily smooth alcoholic warmth.  Just a fantastic enjoyable beer."
