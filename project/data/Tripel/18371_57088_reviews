"Another solid beer from prety things arguably my favorite"

"Pours a clear gold with two fingers thick of soapy white head, settles to a thin ring with a few blobs on the glass. Smell: nectarine, white grape, pils-y semi sweetness, moderate spiciness. Taste: apricot jam, dried pineapple, spicy, a bit of a crackery backing, with peach skin and a note of earth in the finish. Body thins out a bit much and finishes a little powdery, but it's quite tasty."

"Poured a copper orange with a small white head. The smell has yeast and hints at sweetness and hops. The taste is very similar to the nose. Smooth finish nice flavor and easy to drink. I have held onto this bottle a bit longer then I should have. Will try another fresh bottle next spring."

"Haven't had many tripels in awhile, but fluffy rabbits is excellent, and a good example in general of american brewers staying relatively true to style while upping the assertiveness of these beers. This is a complex melange of full bodied yeast, sugary alcohol, with also an assertive floral/piney/herbal hop character, all woven together to make for an intense but memorable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: def. not my favorite. Did not really like the taste"
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice, distinct and well-made - definitely a tripel I'd go back to - had plenty of the typical characteristics - so there's no mistaking it as a tripel - but the hoppiness lent it an American IPA-kinda character, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Enjoyed a lot over the years. Pretty nice stuff."
""
"Overall: this is not a traditional tripel, and while its good, in terms of a tripel I find it lacking a lot. I don't like the bubblegummy flavor in this style and the earthiness seems to make the other tastes more subtle."
""
""
""
"I would have this again any time. It was my first beer from Pretty Things, and I'm definitely intrigued, will look for others."
""
"A touch hot, but good depth of flavor. The bitterness is more than I prefer, but great balance, otherwise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light amber hue, short head, little lacing. The head's a little thicker with a very vigorous pour, but the appearance, while perfectly OK, is not exceptional. Candy-like aroma, long on bubble gum. The taste is quite pleasant, if, perhaps, a little more confectionary than other leading tripels. There's banana, there's cotton candy, but it's a sophisticated sweetness--both inviting and satisfying. Texture is sufficiently rich."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this one compares very favorably to some of the top-rated tripels that I've tried. Not sure if it's a deviation from the style or not, but it tastes more like a Belgian Golden Ale that I've really enjoyed then the Tripels that I typically shy away from."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is lightly hazed yellowish amber with a fairly tight white head. Nose is predominantly candied sugar, light earthy note, and some sweet lemon. Taste is a bit more sweet but has some other things going on. Hints of peppery yeast and light tang. Sweeter candied sugar, faint candied lemon, not much of a distinct hop profile. Smooth medium body and well carbonated, very inviting palate."
""
""
""
""
"beautiful creamy white head on a golden, yellowish body. the nose is all full of clove, spice, over-ripe banana, orange citrus, yellow box-cake, grassy noble hops - really great. the taste follows the nose closely with a lively belgian peppery yeast flavor mixing so well with the candi sugar and all the other flavors that I picked up on in the smell. delightfully sweet and not cloying at all - in fact a little juicy and bright in flavor. really wonderful. a surprisingly full and creamy body that was a little surprising but enjoyable but finished drier the more i drank. overall, this was a real delight. maybe my new favorite from pretty things."

"O: Definitely quite a hoppy tripel with a good bit of spiciness, fruitiness, and funk to start off. Nothing mind shattering, but a solid stab at an Americanized version of the style"
""
"O- In a sea of tripels, some overly complex and others boring, this one stands out as being very subtle yet very tasty. Only the second beer I've had by Pretty Things and both have been great."
""
""
""
""
"I had this beer on tap and in a bottle. The appearance is of a medium gold, yellowish plus a hint hazy with a  nice white head color. The smell is of dry apples, flowers, and a dash of vanilla. A wonderful almost bubble gum taste, along with hoppy, spicy yeast flavor. Yum! "
"Very pleasant to drink. Not overly hoppy, but very flavorful."

"O: A damn solid beer; highly recommended. Pretty Things continues to impress, and this is perhaps the most precisely-executed of their beers I've had. Spot on. Kudos."
""
""
"A damn fine Tripel and worth getting your hands if you can. I plan on getting at least one more to share with friends. the Tripel is pretty complex but I had to wait a bit for the beer to warm up before I could get the flavors."

"O- This is a complex brew, but can be simplified as a hoppy tripel. Plenty of tropical fruit, citrus rind, and spicy yeast notes. It's balanced in some ways, but has so much personality. It's absolutely an expressive and unique tripel, but is put together so well. Well done. Dependable. Exciting. Complex. That said, it can be enjoyed as both a special sipper or an everyday drinker. It's that flexible. This is Pretty Things. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really enjoyable beer but one that needs to be enjoyed slowly as the ABV is fairly high and the alcohol is somewhat noticeable. I was really happy to find this beer again since I had really enjoyed it a few years back before I was writing reviews - I had fond memories of the beer and it was just as good."

"A well made triple have a new brewery to be distributed here in Kentucky. Nothing special here, but I can't see anyone a fan of this style being disappointed."
""
""
"Overall I love this experimental brew it takes the aspects of dry hoping and mixes it up with the fruity aspects of your typical Belgium Triple. If it's still around I will be sure to acquire another bottle especially for 5 bucks!"
"O - Nice twist to a tripel belgian. Overall, I'd rather just have one style or the other, not combined."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great hops and Belgian integration. Orange and lemon peel Citrus, strong American Ale. Fruity peachy and apricot tasty, a little apple juice and good drinkability. A nice spce sweetness. Decent head and lace on cloudy body. Hoppy aroma.Dry finish.Something special."
""
""
"Another very well done beers from one of my favorite American brewers doing Belgian styles. This beer maintains the spirit of Belgium while giving it a definate American twist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is golden to yellow in the glass, but has good head and laces nicely on the glass. Head retention is good too, and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. The aroma is grassy and citrus - most likely lemon. Taste is great - but I think this is somewhat misclassified as it comes off as a strong Saison - lots of nice spice and a good citrus presence."
""
""
""
"this is a fantastic beer - it's hard to be let down by pretty things honestly."
""
""
""
"This is a good example of the Pretty Things style, which I find totally appealing, which is off-beat but highly drinkable. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Krisp in downtown San Diego."
"Lighter body, but carbonation doesn't lighten things up very much. Some warmth from alcohol. Not bad. I expected a bit more complexity as the nose indicated. "
"Mouth feel is carbonated nicely and alcohol is hidden. This is a well done Tripel. Top two from the US in my opinion. ."
""
""
"Overall it's the feel of this beer that gets me the most, it's very enjoyable. Super easy to drink too at 8.5 ABV! More Pretty Things home runs!"
""
""
""
"The amount and type of flowery overtones are what I normally expect from Witbiers or overly floral blonde ales. This seems to mask the dry spice and earthen tones that are celebrated best in Trappist versions. Its creaminess seems to give the beer more body instead of dryness and is slow to develop dryness. But these are picky criticisms- this is still a very well made tripel ale."
"O: A delicious tripel – standard flavors, but with a hopped-up balance that separates it from the more traditional Belgians you’d come across. A must-try for Belgian fans."
""
"Overall, not a bad beer. I was expecting a little more hoppiness, but I'm not sure of the bottle age"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a decent tripel. I like the ingenuity of adding amarillo hops , creating that tropical fruit characteristics. Overall, very enjoyable, but not spectacular."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in an Orval chalice, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that went away quickly. There's also a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like lemon peel, light citrusy and grassy hops, cloves, peaches and some bubblegum. The brew tastes like bready malt, lemon peel, cloves, peppery spice, grassy hops, and some pears. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, and at $7.99 a bottle I'd buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the aging of this beer really brings out the flavors 10 fold and make this an excellent beer to try. The 8.5 ABV is well hidden behind all the bursting flavors. One of the best fruit type beers Ive had!"
""
""
"This beer has one of the best names around. It also helps that the style makes Fluffy White Rabbits a must try. It pours a lighter bodied, cloudy yet bright gold in color with a one finger bright white and soapy head. The nose is light and yeasty. There is a light citrusy hop character and a slight buttery aspect, but not like diacetyl, like short termed Chardonnay barrel aging. It's intriguing nonetheless. The flavors are light and citrusy. The yeast is mild yet flavorful. It is what I would call an off dry. There is a light and clean hoppiness. It has nice flavor and does what it promises. It drinks light in body with a light yeasty dryness. I like it. This beer was a great buy at $8.99. Pretty Things continues to impress."
"Pours a hazy straw-like golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY spicy. Tons of peppery spice with some Belgian yeast and a hint of coriander. Great, bright green apple...fresh red apple aroma as well. Hints off peaches and banana. Taste is initially very spicy, just like the nose. Very tinglt peppery feel on the tongue at first. Pepper and bitter hops which immediately turn to sweet Belgian yeast and banana. Sweet apple flavor with more hops. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a very hoppy and spicy tripel, but it tastes damn good!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is dangerously drinkable and very well made. the flavors and complexity are astounding. if the head production was bigger this beer would be perfect. This is my first beer from Pretty Things and if their other beers are this good it won't be my last."

"O: As the name suggests; soft and fluffy. Surprisingly juicy on the palate. Very balanced with a nice hoppy zing in the finish of lemony citrus and grassy florals. There is no alcohol presence whatsoever which makes this one dangerously drinkable. This is an excellent American-made Tripel."
"O: Once again I am impressed by Pretty Things. A tripel that really hides the alcohol, great for springtime per the label."
""
"Bright yellow in color with just the slightest haze. Poured with a billowy white foam that is fed by an endless stream of migrating bubbles. Wheat malt, banana and yeasty aromas with a hint of spice in the background. Creamy smooth with a heavy wheat malt body and rich carbonation. Wheat malt up front that quickly transitions to a combination of citrus hops and sweet fruity banana into the middle. Spicy flavors pick up in the middle that return to light bitter hops and sweet banana. Wheat and bready malt flavor grows through the middle and to the finish as well. Finishes with a spicy flavor that tapers to bitter hoppiness. Very complex and enjoyable. A fabulous triple."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an interesting beer, and a somewhat out-of-the-box tripel. I don't think the Belgians use quite this much wheat; it's almost an Imperial Wit. Still, I like the overall effect and I'd definitely drink this again."
""
""
"Poured a 3/4"" white head which faded a little faster than I'd expected. It has a pretty body, kind of a light hazy lemonade yellow color. Smell is very promising with tropical fruit and hints of sweet tartness. The taste mirrors that smell pretty well and adds some malt. There's a medium rich mouthfeel and a medium length finish. A fine product and true to the style."
""
"Overall (4/5): This beer is an excellent piece of brewing. As I noted above, it may not have the flavor to hold its own against the most revered Belgian-style tripels, but it has its own distinct character. It's subtly hopped-up, refreshing, and has a beautifully creamy texture that I personally think is to die for. This is not a beer you could call forgettable. I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it. It runs between $7 and $8 for a 22 oz. bomber. One of the best Pretty Things' beers I've tried."
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy goldenrod coloring with a frothy, white, light, fluffy head that is low and clingy. Nose of light spicing, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove over a toasted grain backbone. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a slightly tangy, syrupy sweet highlight. Toasted grain backbone with some citrus sweet don't balance well, and the spicing just gets in the way. Too light to really effect the palate, the spicing seems superfluous. Smooth, full body with a rich, sweet, and slightly spicy aftertaste. The finish starts smooth and transitions into a spiced, slightly sharp feel. This beer was a bit all over the place for me."
""
""
"A real gem."

"O: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice Belgian Tripel with good complexity making it worth drinking for a long time."
""
""
"O: The intent here seems to be for the hops to accentuate, but not dominate. That is exactly what they do. Don't be expecting a Belgian IPA riddled with American hops. The hop tastes are mellow and seem predominately English, though the American hops shine through too (and more-so as the beer warms). I never really thought those oily/leafy tastes that English hops bring to the table really meshed well with the tripel style. American hops are the better play, accentuating the tropical esters (which are also largely absent here) by adding citrusy/tropical tastes of their own. Perhaps my memory fails me, but this beer is not what I remember it being when I had it a year or two ago. I find myself slightly underwhelmed. It has some complexity, but it comes mostly from the hops rather than the base beer. Still, I can't leave it without some praise. It is very drinkable, and its more charming attributes begin to grow on you as you drink. Definitely worth a try, and I will make an effort to revisit it in the near future. I had given it glowing reviews in the past; maybe I'm having an off night."

"O/D-This has been one of the more elusive Pretty Things brews for me. It is also one of the breweries most highly regarded creations. Its pretty damn tasty but not my favorite from Pretty Things. I don't love Tripels generally and this may be one of, if not my favorite from the style."
"... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..."
"O: A really nice tripel, Pretty Things does it again. Will be on the lookout to try this one fresh to get the hops fresh, but this beer was great without it."
""
"O: another very good brew from pretty things... One i look forward to every year."

"O - Delightful Belgian brew. Nicely hopped too. The hops are nowhere near overwhelming. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer that I wait for each spring. One of their single best beers."
"O - I am enjoying this beer a lot and very happy that I have gotten the chance to try this one very good beer all around definitely worth picking up if you see it aroumd"
"The aroma was akin to some kind of spicy green tea at first. Lots of light grain, yeast aromas of fresh leaves and a touch of light citrus sprinkled in. A spiciness I am assuming from the Basil leaves, very intresting aroma for sure. The flavor was light, nicely balanced with a lightly grainy start to it, that turned over to some light fruit, peaches? Maybe green apples, coming through in the middle with that nice light and very fresh leaf like flavor. Hints of spice rippled throughout, especially in the finish which was dry and nicely accented."
"Overall, this is a unique take on the style, but definitely not the best I have ever had. I'd like to see a little less focus on the hops (wow, never thought I would say that.)"
"O - This has good drinkability. It is easy going down, and tastes great. I could have a few rounds of this. Overall, I thought this was a nice beer and a good representation of the style. Another solid offering from Pretty Things. I can't wait to have more of their beers."
"This was quite good and is definitely one of the better takes on an American Tripel that I’ve had out of the bottle. This just has a lot of fresh hop character to it that is nicely complimented by the spice and fruit flavors that the Belgian yeast brought to this. I think that the freshness is the key with this one though. If you haven’t had it yet, I’d wait until the next batch at this rate."
"O: Overall this was a very good tripel. It's pretty much as the description goes, it's a tripel with a good hop smell and flavor to it. It mainly just adds to the fruitiness of the beer and gives it a bit more character."
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a pretty big head on it. The lacing was pretty good as well. The smell of the beer is floral and sweet with a light hoppy aroma in the mix. The taste was sweet upfront and settled into a nice floral spice flavor. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side. Overall I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and I would enjoy having it again one day."
"Fuller bodied than expected with a crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the spice, yeast, alcohol and light fruit notes into a slightly dry finish. The floral hops give off a dry, earthy bitterness with some soil/pine character up front which counter the sweeter notes of the beer pretty nicely. Not overly hoppy but just enough to add some complexity and balance. The hops are complimented by some zesty spice, namely pepper, coriander and candy sugar. I'm also picking up some citrus and other light fruits, orange peel, apple, pear and apricot. There is a lot of alcohol flavor toward the end of the palate but I wouldn't really call this beer hot. This is a unique twist on the triple style that they pulled off pretty well."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. It was fruity and spicy in all the right places. Thanks again Michael."
"Im guessing its a Belgian inspired beer, it reminds me of something that Fantôme would do."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow, moderately carbonated, with a fizzy white head that didn't linger long. Aroma of sweet light malts, citrus, floral notes, with light spices. Nice flavor, full of light sugars, peaches, citrus, and just enough hops to give it a nice dry finish. Light mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"O - Light, but a touch sweet."
" The flavor up front is yeasty, tangy and gently sweet with a mild malt body and hint of ripe tropical fruit which leads to a more citrus and spice flavor and the bitterness comes forward in the middle. The flavor is lightly toasted in the malt dept and a slight grassy herbal element also peeks through with only a slight amount of alcohol in the flavor. The gentle citrus notes add a mild level of astringency and you get the idea there is some candy sugar as the flavor leans to the sweet side but a hint of hoppiness is still present in the finish. I liked this beer a lot, it is a satisfying and drinkable beer for the abv, I think it fits the style well -a hoppier, more American take on the tripel style which is refereshing and well brewed."
"O- Definitely an American version because of the aggressive hops. It actually has a nice balance to it though with the Belgian yeast which can be pretty dominant in many tripels."
"Overall this is a good brew and I like it. Nice sipper on a summer evening."
"Even though it's MO is a hoppy beer, I feel I opened this one too early. Perhaps with some time, this tripel would mellow out and become slightly more balanced. With that being said, it is still a solid beer."
"o - Overall it's ok. I've been finding that Pretty Things has a a style to the flavor and sometimes it works (I LOVE Baby Tree and Jack D'Or...and don't even get me started on Our Finest Regards) and other times it is a bit off. None-the-less, this is a brewery worth checking out and I will continue to try their catalog. I could see people loving this one and I can also see them not being blown away (which was the case for me). Easy drinker though...just a bit overboard on bubblegum...kind of like if Short's made a beer called bubblegum."
"O-This beer is awesome, a fruity taste smacks your pallet first, followed by a very dry ending, leaving you wanting more. It would be easy to knock back a lot of these and wonder where the day went."
"O: Overall, a decent tripel, though nothing special. The bubblegum and banana aromas/flavors really dominate the nose and palate instead of letting the yeast and fruity characteristics come through. The attenuation and carbonation are also a bit lower than what I consider makes a good tripel"
"O - PTB&AP are slowly becoming my favorite brewery. They have passion behind what they do. They are not just throwing ingredients together to see what happens. Its a great brew. Well done!"
"O: Really enjoyed this beer. Thought it was a nice take on the style. Very easy to drink 2-3 of these and it was nice ""Easter"" beer."
"pours lightly clouded and a slightly darker shade of golden color quarter inch head very little lace. smell is much better with pear and apple and hints of alcohol. fruity up front malt and yeast then some warming from the alcohol. taste is well balanced and complex. smooth easy to drink with a nice warming alcohol that is not overpowering. this one could sneak up on you real fast."
"I liked this one handily. Very juicy, and indeed, quite hoppy but never bitter or aggressive. The hop bill was chosen wisely to create a very beneficial juiciness and pear element."
"D: It's only fitting to drink this beer on Easter. This tripel from the ""Gypsy"" Brewery that is Pretty Things is a very good beer. It has nice spicy notes with subtle fruity characteristics, well balanced and a very easy drink at 8.5%."
"HV"
"Overall: I thought this was a good beer, but I wanted more of a hop presence given the description. The other flavors are well balanced and I would have another."
"Lighter medium body, higher carb, tingly and dry. Drinks well, fairly refreshing despite the higher ABV which is actually masked nicely. Would drink again."
"Body is on the thin side, but doesn't bother me at all. Finish is dry fro the style, but I prefer that anyways. There is some warming as it goes down, hinting at the 8.5% but not detracting too much from the overall score. Not my favorite PT beer, and certainly not the best tripel, but well worth seeking out this interesting take on the style."
"Somehow I suspect that Dann Paquette understands this phenomena when he brews certain styles in his own off-the-path way and just smiles a knowing smile realizing the consumer will somehow “get it”. I’ll get some more!"
"The spices/herbs are almost too much, though they never quite overwhelm the base yeast/malt/hops combination. Something about this beer (other than the rabbits) reminds me of Easter - While not exactly true to it's Belgian progenitors, I'd definitely buy this again on a seasonal basis were it in my market."
"This is a wonderful tripel. It is a little more hoppy and a bit lighter feeling than some of the Belgian styles I've had, making it almost like a heavier saison, but it's really delicious nonetheless."
"O-> This is really quite enjoyable/drinkable. Tastes so fresh and earthy/grassy = perfect for Spring. Again, enjoyed the hop bite and bitterness, really pops on the tongue. Some may find it too bitter or over the top with hops but I really felt like it was well balanced in a way. Very smooth drinking. Curious as to how this would hold up with some time in the cellar..."
"Overall, I think the booziness hold this beer back. I regularly drink imperial stouts and strong belgians like it's nothing, but this beer was a bit of a chore to get through."
"D - Very drinkable. The 8.5% abv is not noticeable at all. Nice blend of flavors with a nice addition of a touch of hops. Really smooth and well balanced."
"Overall, it's an awesome beer. A cool take on a style that I haven't seen much done with. I like this beer a lot, and I'm not sure whether it would get better or worse with time..."
"Prost!!!"
"Overall, a really nice tripel with impressive balance. Nice combination of bitter earthy hops and fruity Belgian notes. Another solid, borderline stellar, offering by Pretty Things."
"Not bad but definitely lacks the complexity of a good tripel."
"O: It is a weird beer. One sip it drinks like a champ the next it can feel like a chore. Better on tap than in the bottle IMO in that the extra carbonation really helps it out."
"O- Very interesting American take on this classic Belgian style. Hops meld beautifully with the classic taste of this brew. Hops werent just carelessly thrown into the kettle."
"O: Because you can taste the alcohol, this is a beer that needs to be consumed slowly, although it is a good sipper."
"Pours a clear yellow/orange with a thin soapy head. Crystal clear with some bubbles flowing up from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is very inviting: Belgian yeast-spice, apples, florally/herbal hops. Very traditional Belgian tripel aroma with a hoppy American twist. Flavor is of sweet pale malts (grainy), apples/pears, Belgian spice, white peppercorns, and finishes with a sharp herbal/citrus hoppy bite. Very sharp/prickly carbonation. Leaves a slightly tart/earthy flavor on the tongue. Probably my favorite offering by Pretty Things. I will definitely be sending out these this spring/summer as extras."
"Beer is a nice golden sunset yellow, very cloudy with a nice thin white head. Aroma is belgian funk and crisp pears and green apples. Taste is unique for a Tripel. There is still the funky Belgian yeast but there is also this slight hop bitterness at the end. The hops really go well with the sweetness of the upfront flavors. It makes this Tripel one of the most drinkible and thirst quenching out there. I love the different take on one of my favorite styles!"
"D - a very nice American take on a classic Belgian style. Complex but balanced and the added bitterness from the hops give this ale an extra dimension."
"O - Mmhmm, this ia yet another solid, delicious offering from Pretty Things. Great tripel characteristics with their own slight take on things. My only knock on this would be the appearance. A nice fluffy head and clinging lacing would make this beer oh so much better."
"Could not guess the alcohol level on this one as it hides in the expressive flavors. Great on a warm spring day."
"A hazy golden orange with no head an only a little lacing. Smells of lemon zest, green apples and some orange peel. Also has a spicy twist from yeast and hops. The hops are deep in the background. Taste is light and crisp with a lot of carbonation. A refreshing lemon/orange juiciness upfront with a full middle of some doughy sour malt that finishes with a strong tingle and a dry lemon peel finish. The hop bitterness in the end is strong and makes you want more and more."
"Good drinkability. Wanted just a touch more complexity, but that is a real picky bitch about this. I will get this again before it disappears. Very worthy."
"Love it...I'm a true hophead, but I've fallen in love with this one. Surprisingly smooth for an 8.5 abv. Enters the mouth spicy and goes down with a slight kick of bitterness. Somewhere in there is a sniff of Belgium wheat. Again, with limited experience, pretty much top of class for a tripel."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but crisp and feels rather light for 8.5% abv. Overall, this is a highly drinkable and very refreshing beer and provides a unique twist on the tripel."
"O: A great offering from a brewery that is local to me. I will definitely pick up a few bombers each year that this is released to celebrate the oncoming Spring."
"put this beside delirium tremens and la fin du monde any day and I'd say it'd be just underneath them. this is very good and being from MA, it's nice to have this brewery close by. I'm gonna need more. maybe a case..."
"overall this a great, enjoyable tripel, full of flavor and quite refreshing... nice take on the style and another hit from pretty things."
"M/O - A little thin for a tripel. Lacks a little in complexity, too. Easy to drink, though."
"O - a very quality beer. everything they put out seems to be. its not my favorite by them but its certainly in the top 5. keep 'em coming."
"The feel of this beer is big and fluffy, (if I can steal from the name) there is a loosely open feel to this beer. It is big but it is also inflated with carbonation to make it feel light at times."
"D-very drinkable, refreshing, and has the right balance between the hops and typical Triple sweetness"
"Just a crispy clean drinker and a perfect spring offering from the best brewer in Boston."
"D: Really tasty, easy enough to drink. The 8.5% strength hardly shows until the finish: proceed with caution! 'Hoppy Triple' is such an interesting concept - this blurs a line between the styles well, tho' not as well as the pinnacle of the style IMO Houblon Chouffe (listed as a 'Belgian IPA' on BA). A worthy substitute, one I'd like to have more of next spring. [note: it now is ALMOST 'next spring'... need more NE traders!]"
"Drinkability: I had this on tap when it was fresh and it was much more hoppy but I actually prefer it now as the flavors are more balanced"
"Drinkability: Liked it, very drinkable. Not as sweet as a traditional tripel. I would classify this offering as a tripel with a twist."
"tastes like a lemon saison. lots of lemon, but it not overpowering. I get no hops, but this isnt bad. A bit of spice in it as well."
"D. While it lacks the sweetness and overtly fruity character that I generally associate with a tripel, it adheres to the BJCP guidelines very well. The alcohol is well hidden for an 8.5% beer. While I'm not overwhelmed, this is a respectable beer that delivers on the style."
"Pours a straw golden yellow, lots of carbonation. Citrus-malty aroma, some spice, coriander, maybe cinnamon? Taste is a bit sweet, some citrus hoppiness and ginger. Mouthfeel is a bit thin; I'm not crazy about this one, not enough in the belgian tradition."
"Well... Fluffy White Rabbits was gone in short order, that's for sure. This is a tasty beer, but with a bit of tweaking I think could really come into its own. Needs a bit of panache and unique style, if I may say so. Then again, if I brewed this, I'd be joyous. Recommended if you can get it. Keep an eye on these Pretty Things kids."
"Drinkability: Another beer that has truth in advertising. This tripel has a super hoppy. I could have a couple. Nice and clean. A good beer."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, bready, some coriander, pepper. The taste is malty/yeasty, bready, coriander/pepper. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew, a little to spicy though."
"A: A solid inch of head on a hard pour, very light and fluffy head that dropped quicker than expected for a triple, dark straw to light gold in color - 3.50, S: I pickup a mildly tart aroma that reminds me of green apple, there is also some green that reminds me of freshly mowed grass, faint honeydew melon - 4.00, T: There is a slight citric zest on the tongue, noticeable hop bite, quite earthy and herbal ending with a grapefruit-like sweetness, candied sugars are quite prominent, dry finish and slight alcohol - 4.25, M: Light to medium mouth feel, a slight slickness to the beer - 3.50, D: A solid interpretation of a triple, quite drinkable and refreshing - 4.00"
"D: A fantastic drinking Tripel. Alcohol is virtually non-existant. Great beer!"
"I was only told that this was a tripel when I asked about it. It was served to me in a twelve ounce glass and I enjoyed it very much. It was a little on the dry side but I wouldn't have guessed it was a ""hoppy' Tripel. In any case I really enjoyed it. The alcohol is high enough to pack a punch but not so high as to knock you out (pardon the metaphor). Very good drinker. I'll get it again."
"Fluffy White Rabbits is a very refreshing beer, and it has a nice interplay between fruity yeast flavors and hops. My only complaint is that it feels a bit thin."
"What a crazy tripel but oh so good. First off it tastes like a bowl of fruity pebbles cereal but with only the lemon fruity pebbles. Obviously lemony with hints of clove, earthy , flowers, loam, spice, and apricot. Light in weight and body but big in flavor."
"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow into my Duvel tulip. Judged on the first pour alone I would have scored a 3 for appearance, as a two finger white cap formed and dissipated quickly without leaving much lacing behind. The second pour was a bit better though, with a 3+ finger head that stuck around at least briefly. Still not much in the way of lace though, and this is one style where I definitely have some expectations in that department. The nose is decent, an appreciable sweetness and some juicy citrus hop notes fill in where usually I'd notice the yeast's influence. Fluffy White Rabbits is a damn tasty beer, a brief opening hop bitterness quickly fades and is replaced by traditional tripel pale malt sweetness and yeast spiciness. The beer closes beautifully with the aforementioned hops, still juicy and citrusy. The mouthfeel is appropriately light for the style, with a nice bubbly carbonation. No booziness at 8.5% is always appreciated, and helps make this beer disappear quickly, though any brew that tastes this good isn't bound to last long in my glass. Another wonderful beer from Dann Paquette at Pretty Things, but that's par for the course from them."
"D - I am crazed over this brew. I will crave it daily, from now until I live in a distribution area."
"This beer manages to be smooth, balanced, and sharp all at the same time. Completely original. I've never had a beer that tastes much like this at all. This is one of the most original beers I've ever come across."
"D - A delicate and sophisticated Tripel... Goes down easy sip after sip... Another damn fine offering from Pretty Things..."
"This beer brings out the simple characteristics I love of tripels and ditches anything else. It tastes tripel-influenced, not so much a traditional tripel. Semantics. It's clean, well-made and enjoyable. Enjoy!"
"Beer has no real forward palate flavor, some carbonation in the mouth and some hop flavors and bitterness in the mid to late palate. Beer is medium to light in body and overall just an average tripel. Nothing too special. They really should have just gone after the hoppiness aspect and brewed a decent base tripel. There is almost a plasticy note to the flavors. Eh, I didn't really enjoy it but it was drinkable enough."
"This interesting beer appears a hazy straw hue with a somewhat smallish head and minimal lacing. Aromas of spices, hops (much more present than in a normal tripel), and lemon zest. The beer tastes pretty decent, but not great. There is a slightly weird flavor that lingers a bit in the aftertaste. Overall, a pretty average brew. I'm not sure hoppy and tripel are a good marriage."
"D - very easy to drink but use caution: the abv will catch up with you."
"D: All of the Pretty Things beers i have tried have been very drinkable, save for this one. It just felt too harsh. Next, i'll pair with a strong, stinky cheese."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and clean with good carbonation."
"Taste starts sweet as expected, but with a pleasant balancing hoppiness on the flipside. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and silky smooth, with quite easy drinkability, esp for the abv. Worth the trouble to find. Luckily, I have to expend little effort to get, yay for me!"
"d: I liked this and I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'd reach for a hoppy tripel very often. Still, I admire the effort and this came together surprisingly well."
"Pours a hazy pale orange color with a tight white head that settled into a solid ring. The aroma has a nice Belgian yeast aroma. Some banana and clove with honey and candi sugar notes. Not much hop pick up in the aroma. Light but seems spot on for the style. The taste starts off with a sweet tropical fruit note, some citrus, floral honey and light clove. The sweet transitions rather abruptly into an astringent, chalky bitterness from the hops. Can't say that it is very pleasant luckily it is not too strong. The feel is light with tingly carbonation, the hops give an odd chalky feel not typically present in tripels. ABV seems well hidden. An average tripel. The actual tripel flavors were actually pretty good but I didn't really care for what the hops brought to the party. It made the beer astringent and chalky which is not typical for the style."
"Overall, this was a good beer that lived up to the hype that Pretty Things gets here on BeerAdvocate. It was very drinkable and I could definitely go for this one again."
"Drink doesn't give the impression as name states. More like a jackolope on steroids! Good crafted brew. Not reviewers most favorite offering from Pretty Things, but well respected."
"The drinkability is alright. Alcohol presence is definitely felt with a near instantaneous warming sensation... The finish is a little bit off-putting but the light body doesn't make it a chore to drink."
"This is a great tasting American example of a Belgian triple, however since it was advertised as being a hoppy beer I expected a bit more hop aroma and flavor. I guess I was thinking lots of orange citrus and floral notes. Still, if you like Belgian beers you have to try this one."
"D: Pretty easy drinking for a triple. The sweetness is a little much towards the end though. Recommended, but it might be a good one to split"
"Picked up a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer for $7. Overall, heck of a beer. The aroma is full of herbal pepper ad spice with fresh grains. The flavor begins similarly with vanilla, light caramel, and fresh white bread. Hops slowly kick in with a mix of floral, citrus, and orange rind, to round out a well-made tripel. I'll have another."
"The taste is quite spicy, with a lemon citric acerbicness that is not endearing me to this beer. The beer is a bit syrupy, a bit sweet, with a peppery spice on the back end, a light malty underneath, and a lemony tang that is okay. The coriander and spice really come through with this beer, add to that the yeasty pricklishness, the wheaty qualities towards the finish, the sweet but light malts, and you have this beer pegged. It's is okay, but not brilliant."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a very good lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Almost clear golden color. Nose is lightly hoppy. Flavor is sweet, fruity with the hops balancing. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.95 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Bottled Mar 2010."
"Bottled March 2010. Gold/orange colour with a bit of haze. The pour produced a short, birght white cap of bubbles that produced lots of sticky lace. Good head retention. The aroma was full of spicy Belgian yeast and grassy, citrusy hops. The flavour was nicely balanced, sweet malts, fruity, and hoppy. Bitterness lingered on the palate. Medium bodied with a bit of dryness. Nice texture, soft carbonation. This tasted really fresh, the hop flavours were really bright. Good stuff."
"22oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my Gouden Carolus goblet. Mar 2010 indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Love the label - the art from this brewer is great. Poured a slightly hazy orange-gold with lots of tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head consisted of a half inch, loose, bright white cap that quickly dissipated into a fizzy slick, with a bubbly band around the edges - no lacing on this one. Nose reveals citrus notes upfront (maybe lemon zest), with a hint of coriander and a light, wheaty quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - something of a grassy character in the middle. Definitely a light, herbal hoppiness that expresses itself at the finish, but not as big I was anticipating. Overall the flavors have a nice balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly - almost has a palate cleansing feel to it. Some citrus astringency comes out and lightly stimulates the salivary glands in the cheeks. This is a pretty good tripel. A nice blend of flavors, maybe lacking some of the candi sugar notes I've come to associate with the style, but definitely a respectable beer and another solid offering from Pretty Things."
"A nice bottle but not necessarily a nice beer, reviewed from notes. Pours out a hazy light yellow, even green color with a fluffy/frothy two finger head that has beastly retention. Leaves thick lacing, everything is great but I am not a huge fan of the strange color. The smell is hard to get much. I do get Belgian yeast notes, like bread and spice. Some citrus peel comes through as well as some wheat-like malt. Needs more strength for sure. Taste is decent. Some wheat-like malt but it mostly just Belgian yeast notes. The spice notes are too much for me. Citrus peel comes into play but doesn't add much. The hop flavor is grassy and adds too much bitterness. The balance is out of whack on this beer. To me it ends up just tasting like fancy soap with a few redeeming aspects. The mouthfeel needs work. The carbonation and body are lacking way too much for such a big beer. It isn't creamy at all, it is just really watery and lacking carbonation. There is an oily aspect that I am not a fan of either. The bitter coat is also just too much. Drinkability is decent. The price is not worth it for the quality of this one. A decent taste but the mouthfeel just kills it. Flavors end up being out of balance/too much and soapy."
"The flavor is consistent with the Belgian pale ale. Only the alcohol warmth in the swallow gives away the potency of this brew. Lots of citrus and light malt flavor. Good sourness from the aforementioned yeast. It's not an everyday beer but it is tasty."
"D: Fresh and full flavored with a refreshing quality. Flavors need to balance out a bit more so I would recommend letting this one sit and age for a bit."
"A really interesting beer, extremely hoppy tripe pretty much sums it up. A great American interpretation of this style, not as complex as some traditional tripels but that is made up by the lovely bouquet of floral and earthiness presented by the abundance of hops. Love what this brewery is doing."
"This is a good attempt at a triple and im happy to drink all things that are pretty, like these white rabbits. I could of polished off the bomber easy at 8.5%, but the sweetness would have dragged on me. Seeing how this is a hoppy triple, I say drink up, unless you want more sweetness without the trademark 'ripe' fruit from Belgian Triples."
"D- very nice stuff with a ton of flavor and very drinkable but I guess thats why we are here. Another good beer from some good heads."
"This Tripel pours a hazy, gold into my chalice with beautiful lacing that suggests a good amount of carbonation. There are citrus, peppery aromas that characterize a typical Belgian. This one also has a candy-like smell to it. The taste reveals a complex, well-developed brew here with zesty, citrus, and bready notes. The yeasts run wild. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with medium carbonation. Not heavy at all for a Tripel. The Rabbits are too drinkable as this one got quaffed with the quickness. The Project gets an A+. This is one of the better Belgians I have enjoyed."
"D- Moderately High. Another winner from Pretty Things.. Very impressive. Took my time with it and one'll do me for now.. but I'll be buying more of this. On a hot RI day this was just what I craved."
"Bomber bottle, Bottled March 2010, noted on the over the cap label. Pours light, golden amber, lightly hazed, eggshell head, moderate in stature, reduces to a thicker collar and just bits and a few blobs of lacing. Pungent nose of ginger, lime, assorted Belgian type spicing and yeasty notes. Zesty tripel, flavorful, spiced up, and nicely crafted. Notes of more citrus, ginger, pepper, light honey, Belgian yeasty phenolics. Quite dry in the aggressively hopped finish. Well done and quite refreshingly enjoyable. Better then average American style take on the classic style."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. This is an incredible beer. If you have access to Pretty Things beers be sure to grab a bottle of these before they are all gone."
"D: Very drinkable. I really like this beer and I'll be drinking it again."
"I did enjoy this and it did match with our Easter celebration. Tone down the sweetness a bit and you'd have a great beer."
"overall, another win from Pretty Things. They take style guidelines and throw them out the window. This is kinda like a Tripel and a Belgian Pale Ale combined. It creates a very complex, refreshing, tasty, and original brew. well done."
"Sorry for the deviation from my normal format but I LOVE THIS!!!"
"F: Not too bitter, I was expecting more bitterness here. A looong lingering orange flavor, like biting into a fresh orange. WIth that more citrus and orange peel, a little sticky sweetness leftover but dries off mostly. A slight light body feel on the mouth as if it left the tongue feeling lighter than it started for some reason. Overall a nice tripel with lots of citrus, orange, and bitter citrus. Not as much on the hops as I would have expected from the label, but then again, I'm probably wicked jaded on hops from all the crazy DIPAs I've had, and I know Dann doesn't load up on the hops usually."
"On tap at the Dive Bar, Worcester. Served in a tulip glass. Thin, whispy white head. Cloudy yellow body. Smell reminded me of lemongrass and crushed coriander. Taste was excellent. On the one hand, it had that great sugary Belgian tripel flavor, but then you can't help but notice the great hop flavor that balances everything off nicely. Neither dominates the other, they just work perfectly together. Mouthfeel was spot on for a great Belgian style ale, just enough body and noticeable alcohol presence. A great new offering from Pretty Things. It's nice to see PT beers other than Jack D'or on tap around now."
"Taste is Goya tropical juice up front with spicy backup. White pepper? Grassy hop resin adds flavor and mouthfeel. Dry, dry, super dry aftertaste. Not my favorite tripel but if spring ever comes to Boston I'd have another."
"Carbonation is light for the style and a lingering metallic tinge kind of detracts. Copperish in nature."
"Fluffy White Rabbits is dry and medium-bodied with an appropriate medium amount of carbonation. I stupidly forgot to write down the ABV, but it crisp, refreshing, not at all boozey, and goes down easily. This beer is an excellent tripel as it stays true to the style, but offers some nice surprises."
"This is a motherfucker of a beer. As far as style goes, it is very fair to call this a tripel, because the hops do not muddle any of the flavors that a great tripel should display. Even if you call this a Belgo-American IPA, it's on point. I'm just going to call it something I will look forward to every Spring."
"D: Nice, light, refreshing, great flavor, well balanced. This is another damn solid offering from Pretty Things!"
"Another Easter time beer from the Pretty Things. Very cool artwork, as always. Color is a radiant hazed gold, making this tulip glass look very nice. About a finger of white head shows up, and sticks around for the duration. The smell is dominated by fruit notes such as pear and green apple. More bright, juicy fruit comes through in the taste along with the big hop presence, and dry champagne like finish. Mouthfeel is right smack dab in the middle, and perfectly carbonated for this style. The more you drink the more you can notice the lingering hop bitterness that this beer gives off. Putting back this bomber will be no problem on my end. This is a high quality Tripel that could not get much fresher, as it was brewed this month. Cheers to Dan and Martha."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is a good amount-- less than some, but with a bubbly texture in the mouth, still. I feel like I could drink this all day."
"There is a lot going on in this beer and it is beautifully balanced with the hops malty tripel backbone and the yeasty esters. I will definitely revisit this beer before it leaves the shelves."
