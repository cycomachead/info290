I tried it for the first time two years ago when I was visiting a friend in Utah and it has haunted me since. I've had the pleasure of its company only twice since we first met. If anyone knows where to find it in NYC, please let me know. If you see it at a store, take it home with you. You won't regret it.","shockney","Oct 03, 2014"

When I first tried this I would have rated it higher but it really is kind of soapy. What can I say, It's no Fin du Monde but it is a welcome change of pace.","spacebear09","Sep 22, 2014"

A fine aroma of bananas, yeast and spice. The taste follows the nose with lots of banana, apples, yeast and a nice sweetness. The carbonation gives the mouth a light crispness.

The beer itself is a hazy gold with a bit of orange notes. The smell has strong banana yeast notes with strong hints of bready malt notes. The beer also a slightly sour hop note that seems dulled by the other notes. The beer itself is fairly bananas. The banana notes are just as strong in the taste as it is in the smell but the hop sourness adds a bit of balance to the yeast and candi sugar notes. The malts have a stronger bread taste. The mouthfeel is fairly medium bodied with biting carbonation but on the lighter side. The beer also has a very smooth feeling despite the carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Tripel and most certainly one of the greats.","HattedClassic","Jul 01, 2014"

A spicy and fruity aroma mostly, although yeast and orange are there as typical with a Belgian style beer, but more along some floral spices and sweet fruits or close to (it could be anything although I want to say sweet apples that I like). The beer is light bodied and has a spicy edge that I found leading to a crisp finish, for the most part I get sweet, tropical fruits (apricot, mango, something in that range) and some sugary malts in the beer as this triple seems to be more sweet than most of this style. I enjoyed this beer a lot but I guess when I order a triple I expect something closer to style and not so sweet as the sweetness became overbearing at times.","clayrock81","Jan 12, 2014"

I wish I hadn't read it before I wrote my review, because now I don't know what else to add. The smell is divine with fruit and malt and everything as it should be. It poured just like a good beer should, with plenty of sticky head backed by a subtle and subdued carbonation factor that was pleasant in the mouth and the nose. All of the tripel flavors are there and in full force. What is wrong with this beer? Nothing. I love the effort, I love the concept, I love the homage, and I wish I has been born Trip Houge and been able to live up to this gift. I hope that my life can one day be summed up in an offering such as this. Reach out your hand if your cup be empty. Hopefully, some king head will fill it with this.","StoutCream","Sep 28, 2013"

The liquid has a hazy golden yellow to apricot orange color, fierce amount of bubbles but dispersed and not in tight beads, seems to be some very fine particulate throughout. The nose starts off with a peppery burst before cinnamon, clove and allspice begin the sweetening, culminating in banana, peach, apricot, white grape and spiced orange peels, over time you also get toasted bread crust, pretzels with a white vinegar edge. In the mouth it’s full-bodied and thick, the carbonation creates a rich creaminess rather than refreshing briskness. Here the sour orange to white grapefruit citrus leads the pack leading into salt and pepper, clove, chamomile and bitter grasses, the latter welcome as a foil to the at times dried fruit sweetness in the apricot, apple, peach, pear, pineapple fruit, fairly tropical. On the clean side and not blatantly yeasty, its sourness keeps the palate tightening. The banana and bubblegum make a minor appearance at the end, retronasally and stronger as the beer warms. Great drinkability, no overt sense of its higher ABV.","farrago","Jul 25, 2013"

Hopefully this beer was consumed as intended; I ordered it online from LetsPours and the bottle listed Batch T12230 with a “Best By Date” of 05-2013 – I ordered this in mid-June 2013, so that was disappointing to read after it arrived.

The nose is a little less inviting, not in an unpleasant way, but rather behaving like a parent who is too busy to show up for their kid's soccer match. The hops shine through here more than most tripels, and It's easier to drink than its 9.25% abv would suggest. Crisp with a good amount of carbonation, this is lighter and easier than say Allagash Triple or Chimay Cinq Cents, but a little less complex than something like Tripel Karmeliet. Definitely worth a shot if you enjoy tripels or Belgian goldens.","SirElton","Jun 13, 2013"

Classic tripel aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, cardamom, Belgian yeast; peppery. Flavor follows with initial apple and pear juice, bread malt, finishing drier with well developed cardamom and clove bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel from carbonation.

Aromas of softly sweet malt, light dough, spices, herbs, and dried fruit. Malt is toned down in the flavor, though there's a nice cake-y element. Increased phenolics, peppery spice through the middle, with apple, apricot, and slight citrus juice. Creamy, fluffy mouthfeel - appropriately carbonated, drying, and not too sweet. Never boozy. Well done...","wedge","Feb 08, 2013"
2.98,-28.4,5,3.25,2.5,3.5,2.75,"Pours a sparkling apple-juice-yellow color, with a massive, foamy, eggshell-white head. The aroma is an expected combination of light, tart apple-like yeastiness against dry grassy hops. The flavor has a light, bready sweetness and a bit of banana, but it is mostly a very dry, grassy, almost dirt-like bitterness that lingers in an unpleasant aftertaste. The light, very active carbonation plays off this flavor profile, leaving an exceptionally drying sensation in the finish. Overall, I will readily admit that tripels aren't a preferred style for me, but I have been able to enjoy some in the past... just not this one.","devilben02","Feb 08, 2013"

4.16,0,4.25,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy orange yellow with a big beautiful head on top that stays for awhile and is full of sudsy bubbles that sit at top as creamy smoothness. The beer’s body is hazy, lightly translucent, and peppered with a thick torrent of carbonation bubbles racing to the top. The beer’s lacing is fat and wall-like, with rather large bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass like snow on the ground. On the nose, the beer smells quite hefeweizen-like with thick clove and banana scents alongside sweet lemon bread notes that reveal the Belgian yeast in the beer. The fruity esters on the beer are bright and lively on the nostrils, also hinting towards pineapple and some lighter tropical fruit. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly bitter, but also strongly of banana bread. The taste begins as bitter and lightly medicinal hops which slowly open into lovely banana bread flavors with splashes of lemon and pineapple, though the medicinal bitter remains as an undercurrent on the taste buds. The finish is strong with banana bread, but the aftertaste returns to the surprising amount of hops hiding in this beer, and rings with grassy medicinal bitters. On the mouth, the beer feels fierce with carbonation. The beer is medium in body, and leaves a sticky ichor briefly on the tongue as it travels down the throat. The mouth is left a little burned from the carbonation, and quite dry from the hops, though the tongue does retain some small reserves of saliva. Overall, this beer is surprisingly bitter and harsh on the mouth, but has an awesome smell and some awesome flavors. I think a little gentler of a hand when hopping this beer could be used, but it is an American Tripel after all, and what are we American’s known for if not our overdosing of hops? This is another success from Boulevard! Try this beer.","Maxwell","Jan 25, 2013"

Fruity, yeasty flavor fills the mouth with apple, pear, and a hint of butterscotch, as well as a whisper of hoppy bitterness.

Some definite hop bitterness, but well balanced by the spice and fruits. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, dry, and tingly. Drinkability is very high, as the ABV is well-hidden on this one.

Some nice lacing clings to the glass; with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, apple, orange peel, apricot, biscuit, toffee, pepper, clove, and yeast spices. Nice and very well balanced Tripel aromas. Taste of big apple, apricot, lemon, biscuit, toffee, pepper, clove, herbal, honey, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, biscuit, pepper, and spices on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors, with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 9%, but is still a bit of a sipper.

The taste shows off more of the orange (now complete with some flesh) and wheat, but the rest is still easily found. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly grainy feel.

So, here we go: this bottle was so difficult to get the cork out of, that I almost used a wine opener to get into it. Seriously difficult, my wife said ""I hope its worth it!"". After finally getting the cork out, it let out a large POP. Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a cloudy light orange color, huge fluffy head fills the glass. Retention for days before I can actually drink it. Beautiful really. Smell- tart cherries, lemon citrus, bisquity bready aroma. Taste- nice sweet and tart cherries, followed by a dry bitterness, some watery qualities to it, but not a knock on the beer at all. This is refreshing, complex, and overall hides the 9% ABV like a charm.

3.97,-4.6,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Boulevard gets its grubby American hands all over the traditional Belgian Tripel and finishes with a beer that is bound to turn off the most purist of the beer drinkers. However, the Long Strange Tripel is really only different and not inherently inferior. It lands right in the middle on the totem poll, and maybe even a bit higher depending on what mood your tongue is in. The appearance actually forebodes what the beer has to offer. It's a deep amber color, very orange. This differs from the usual light and yellowish tint most tripels have. The head is slightly off white, about 2 fingers worth, and the beer is wonderfully carbonated.The smell is where the beer is most triumphant in its uniqueness. I get a lot of yeast, some roasted malts and apples. Some alcohol is present along with more fruits. A richer aroma indeed. Then the taste really kicks your purist gut and doesn't apologize. I prefer the traditional brew, but clap clap to Boulevard for doing something new in a year round manner. Yeast, alcohol, apples, pear, roasted flavors highlight a beer that stands out, but not really above, the pack. Mouthfeel is heavier/creamier then most tripels, but is wonderfully carbonated and works extremely well to enhance the enjoyability of the beer. Overall, worth a taste. I may not go back to it, but the new flavors may attract some repeat customers.","mmva321","Aug 08, 2011"

There is always a half inch head sitting on top of the beer. Boulevard has mad a really pretty beer. The aroma is typical Tripel. Apples, pears, sweet Belgian candy sugar, all tied together with a nice Belgian yeast spiciness. Boulevard has mad a spot on Tripel. The flavor profile is exactly what a Tripel should be. The flavor hits up front with orchard fruits imparting overly ripe pears and crisp green apples. Next comes light pale malts, sweet confectioners sugar, and white pepper. A slight green apple peal twang lingers on the palate. This beer is extremely balanced and with a 9% ABV the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is light, with a bright carbonation. I wish the mouthfeel was a bit creamier. Over all, I think Boulevard has made a great example of the style.","hwwty4","Dec 20, 2009"

The spice is very prominent up front and lingers throughout over the other flavors into a long dry finish which is slightly bitter.

Very smooth and easy drinking. Tastes of tart malt, banana, sweet malt, slight hop background, a nice smooth finish of tart malt. The relatively high alcohol content is well hidden and the associated dryness/tartness of a Tripel are lessened by Boulevard. I highly recommend this brew!","Tone","Mar 10, 2009"

By the time I finished, there was just a small, thin ring of white lacing at the bottom of the glass. The smell was clean and fruity, with an earthy undertone, and a heavy reality check on the alcohol content (9%). The appearance was a bright golden hue, cloudy and carbonated. The first sip was a knock out for me, not having had anything else to drink before hand. ""Whoo, that's some strong beer!"" came from the husband. (But he drinks Bud Light.) The first sweet, fruity, malty hit on the tongue gave way to some crunchy, pepper-ish sensations. This beer is not heavily carbonated, and after the first initial sips, the alcohol-burn seemed to go away. Or I stopped noticing. I liked it. A lot.

Aroma has some nice esters of lemon and orange along with the familiar spicy Belgian yeast characteristics. Unfortunately, there are also some distinct fusel alcohol aromas akin to nail polish remover lingering around. Flavors of the same lemon and orange along with a nice balance of sweet malt are quite nice but alas the fusel alcohol overcomes the finish and causes me to curl my nose as I swallow. Moderate hop bitterness and the effervescent carbonation may also contribute to the dominance of the fusels as well.

Love the psychedelic label as well. Let's get to this. Pours a hazy golden orange with a huge 2 and a half finger beautiful off-white head. Head settles down in an unhurried fashion leaving little to no lacing behind while the active carbonation keeps things interesting for a while. Smell is complex but not as robust as some of the other tripels I've tried, but has quite a bit going on with sugar, malts, bananas, oranges, some yeast, some sweet bread and a hint of spice going on. Tastes creamy up front with the alcohol heat, the next thing I noticed, not as blended as I prefer in my tripels. That being said, it still tastes darn good with some hops thrown in actually putting an edge on the malt goodness, along with creamy banana and spice. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied and creamy.

3.88,-6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle: Batch T7341: This one pours a hazy, golden color. There was quite a bit of a white head on it, and it had an audible fizz. Leaves almost no lacing. Nice aroma, if a touch light for a tripel. Notes of peppery spices, yeast and a bit of breadiness. The taste is also a touch light for a tripel. A bit bready, citrus, banana, spicy notes. Nice.","Boto","Apr 28, 2008"
3.43,-17.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Very smooth finish - quite drinkable.","psinderson","Apr 01, 2008"
3.48,-16.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"M - Bubbly feel that has a slightly bitter aftertaste.","Squaretooth","Mar 29, 2008"
3.84,-7.7,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinks fairly easy, but the boozeyness does slow you down a bit. A solid tripel, hits most of the right notes, but just doesn't really reach me","russpowell","Mar 05, 2008"
3.86,-7.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - This is a nice version of a tripel. It's the first Smokestack beer that I've tried and it is quite good.","zeff80","Feb 16, 2008"
3.23,-22.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability: The Long Strangly Sweet Tripel was just a hair too sweet for me.","ChainGangGuy","Feb 15, 2008"
3.8,-8.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Atlanta Ale meeting. Good head on a Belgian light colour. Thick mouthfeel and lots of malt. Quite yeasty. Smooth taste, yeasty aroma and yeast in taste. On the sweet side, but not too sweet. Spices like corriander. Well suitably carbonated. Not a bad one.","Sammy","Feb 10, 2008"
4.01,-3.6,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This is a pretty tasty tripel. Very solid effort here from this brewery, and although this is my first experience with Boulevard I hope it's not my last.","number1bum","Feb 02, 2008"
4.7,13,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The only thing I wanted to say about this beer is that trying a fresh tripel as opposed to one aged, usually due to shipping time, is that it shines a new light on this style for me. The brewer is belgian and I thought this beer was very true to style but the freshness was what makes me love it. I keep trying to keep one and age it but can't seem to stop myself from drinking it. Great beer.","casetlc","Jan 27, 2008"
2.65,-36.3,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A big dissapointment. But 3 out of the 4 offerings were decent. They just whiffed on this one.","jar2574","Dec 15, 2007"
4.04,-2.9,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is lighter in body, but slightly sticky. The alcohol is hidden well, but sneaks up on you by the end of the bottle. Very enjoyable indeed!","bort11","Dec 13, 2007"
4.34,4.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: I've liked all the new Boulevards that came out recently, but I know I'm biased to my local brewery.","joeplyr","Dec 06, 2007"
4.23,1.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A very pleasant, easy to drink beer. Not an in-your-face kind of Belgian but it has a nice relaxed Belgian character. Much rounder, fuller and softer than other trippels I've had. Nicely restrained phenolic esters, earthy spice and alcohol presence give way to a silky maltiness with a supple bready biscuity malt finish supported by a lingering, fading bitterness. Great balance and complexity.","Renfield","Dec 04, 2007"
3.73,-10.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Smokestack Series is shaping up to be pretty damn good.","BradLikesBrew","Dec 02, 2007"
3.95,-5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D - Very high for the ABV. A little on the sweet side for some maybe.","MarzenMan","Nov 25, 2007"
4.47,7.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Spicy aroma with plenty of cloves. Medium body. Lots of spicy flavors from the yeast. Alcohol is not very apparent. Some fruity flavors. Fairly dry. Very easy drinking. Nice beer.","homebrewhawk","Nov 24, 2007"
