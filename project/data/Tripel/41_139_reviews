"Not outstanding, but pretty good"

"This one is another very nice Belgian beer that goes down a treat. The beer is quite fruity and lively with an excellent balance but perhaps falls just short of being a classic, only just though and that's probably just because some of the other Abbey tripels I've tried have set the bar so high. I definitely liked this one more than I thought I would but again sadly it's probably not one I'd pick up again unless I stumbled across in a bar which is quite unlikely as it stands."

"This is one of my all time favorite brews!  I loved it the first time I had it 20 years ago, and I still love it now.  Not as heavy as many Belgium dark beers, but still very complex."

"Very light pale yellow in color. Forms a large foamy, but stable, white head. Lots of lacing on the way down. Aroma is somewhat subdued, but what is there is standard for the style: mostly yeastily phenols mixed with a light sweetness and some floral citrus. Taste is likewise typical for the style. Most yeasty phenols, a touch of band-aid, moderate sweetness, and some orangey citrus. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Mild bitterness."

"A nice tasting beer, but a bit too bitter for my taste."

"05/24/12 On tap At Beer Authority, NYC. This is one helluva beer. Very smooth, light and yes I'll say it ...sophisticated. It has so much character it should be appreciated year round. This is one of the few beers I will order whenever and wherever I see it. And so considerate at only 7.5% ABV."

"This was one of the first tripels that I had, and I was impressed by the depth of flavor. The aroma was fragrant and full of delightful spice, as was the beer itself. The mouthfeel was one of the best parts; nice carbonation, and full-bodied without seeming dense or heavy. Words I would use include spicy and nutty, with a lovely long finish and little bitterness or sourness to speak of. I have not had many tripels yet, but would recommend this beer to anyone who was interested in a moderately complex and tasty sipping beer. Would certainly buy again."

"While I do think the nose is deficient all in all I think this is one of the better tripels out there, nothing overwhelmingly fancy but exceptionally well-made. Arguably a good entry point into the style, actually, due to its intrinsic competency."

"Pale and golden with a lively white head. Hints of light fruits, some pears, white grapes, orange peels, and a touch of yeasty bread. A bit of clove as well. Very classic Belgian pale ale and tripel flavor. Goes well with a flaky white fleshed fish with butter and rosemary. Effervescent and light, this beer makes for a nice compliment with dinner."
"big yeast funk, spice, orange slice, everything nice. solid tripel, loads of carbonation making for fun excess swirling, cool bottle, at first it seems less tinted but its just lack of a paper label, lets some more light in but at least it isn't a green bottle. look forward to more from this brouwerij. this is close to westmalle but it doesn't pack the same punch"

"Overall / Drinkability: A definite sipping beer, but I wish I had a larger bottle, so good marks for drinkability. Good with a meal (fish and green beans) but I think it would hold up all on its own....although I think it would always be better with some food. I can't quite put my finger on it, but a beer like this seems best with food. By itself it does quite well, but I think more of the flavors are notable with food to contrast against. A solidly outstanding beer."

"Superb brew with some good live yeast in the bottle. I could see this doing well as a Cellar beer, and I will be picking up another bottle. Belgium does make some fine beers, and there are plenty of American brews up to the task of taking them on in their own game."

"Overall, an ok tripel but far from great. A little too much spice and malt and not dry enough. Probably won't pick this one up again."
""
""
"Overall- Good beer with some inclinations toward being a really good beer. Very good representation of the style which I believe could also be a good introduction. Definitely worth a try."

"O: Highly spiced, not my cup of tea, allthough I wouldn't throw it out."
""
"Crisp but not sharp like most Belgium beers. Great, very light taste of apples and crisp fruits.  It's a delicious beer that goes down easily. That's what she said.  No, she did. My wife enjoyed this one as well.  Beautiful solid gold color. Hold this one up to the light."
"Note: It's shocking this beer is 7.5% ABV as it could easily pass for 5.0% ABV or less."

"Pours a slightly hazed straw yellow with a white head and plenty of yeast. Aroma has yeast driven fruityness and malt sweetness. In the flavor, fruit notes of pear and apple. Dusty yeast with a firm, candi sugar like malt profile. Medium bodied and semi dry in the finish. Overall this is a good brew, and the 3 liter bottle was a nice elegant touch."
"Overall – Not my favourite mix of flavours, but a very solid beer for sure. This would work well for the summer months."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 11/22/2013. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, pepper, light honey, bread, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, light honey, floral, grass, bread, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, light honey, floral, light pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, earthy hop, and yeast flavors; with a nice fruity/malt balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel and is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice tripel style. All around nice balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice floral presence that comes through especially well in the aroma."

"O: Hoppy for a tripel. Maybe not the most complex of the style, but it's very drinkable. There's a lot to love about it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall not a bad beer, definitely worth trying, but a little too dry for my preferences. If you get it bottled, definitely worth trying both with yeast left out and then added in."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""

"O: This is a good Tripel but not as good as Westmalle Trappist Tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pairs well with aged white cheddar, figs, and black grapes--and of course toast crackers"
""
""
""
"O- This is enjoyable, but noticeably less complex and enjoyable than something like La Fin Du Monde. I'm still glad I gave it a shot though."
""
""
"O: A nice Tripel, perhaps on the more sour side, but still I like it!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one. Super smooth, light, and fruity. The flavors really pop on this one. If I am looking for a beer in this style, this would be near the top of my list."
""
""
""
"O: Pleasant and subtle, but imperfect. Loses steam as it warms and the wateriness becomes apparent. The clear loser to Guldenberg in the head-to-head, though I now realize that's a poor pairing."
""
""
""

""

"O: Impressive tripel – great flavors and aromas."
"Quite enjoyable in my book. A tripel that I can always come back to."

"O: A solid tripel overall with a good balance of flavors. Not quite as complex as some of the best, but a good beer overall."
"O: Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptionally good either. I don't know how fresh this beer is, but it isn't the best tasting tripel. It has a very nice presence in the mouth, but is extremely lacking in flavor and the scent leaves much to be desired."

"A very solid beer. Not overly special but worth a try nonetheless."

"O: A nice, floral, drinkable belgian. Not a lot of complexity, but a solid, easy-drinking beer."
"Very tasty tripel. Enjoyed at 55 degrees and it was perfect for the texture. Aroma is somewhat soapy which is a bit unbecoming. The flavor is a malty and just enough Belgian yeast character to make you notice. I like it and would give it an overall award of 4 out of 5."
"Opens with a loud pop, definitely some carbonation in this one. Pours clear, light golden with a head of mixed foam and larger bubbles. Aroma is light yeast notes and a hint of green pepper (kinda strange). In the mouth, there's lightly toasted malt, mild sweetness and fruitiness, and a noticeable alcohol flavor. Highly carbonated, with minimal linger. Something of a boring Tripel. Easy to drink, but pretty low on flavor or aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strangely tastes of ginger. Thankfully I'm having this beer with sushi. Subtle sweetness lightly floral dried fruit flavors of apple and pear. Finishes spicy and dry with a ginger snap. I like it but it begs to be paired wig sushi."
""
"O- Probably a good one to have on hand, if your a fan of Belgians. I, personally, will likely get this beer again. I got a four pack and they recommended aging it, so I'll save the other bottles to see if they really do get more complex as they age."
""
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours golden with a quickly dissipating white head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and side of the glass upon the initial pour. There are aromas of bready malt and yeast. I also pick up some hops in the smell. The malt profile is very forward in this beer. It is bready and sweet. The hops provide some balance on the back end. There's a touch of spiciness as well. The sweetness really opens up as it warms. The body is light to medium with solid carbonation. The finish is dry and smooth. The drinkability is high for this sipper. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Reminds me of a more substantial Achel. Very typical Tripel. No Suprises here."
"I have not managed to buy Corsendonk Agnus as yet in the UK but make sure that I always stock up when I am anywhere near Belgium. I would welcome an English supplier."
""
"O- this was an ok beer but for a Belgian tripel I expect ally more and this one certainly wasn't quite up to par with the other. Tripels"
""
"Overall a Tripel that is not overpowered by any one flavor, on the contrary the blending of flavors in this brew is exquisitely done..."

"Overall: Great beer, had it a few years back on tap picked up a glass to let you know what you're missing. Might be a little sweet but not in the soda type of way. Complex but smooth. Salud!"

"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought that this was a good and above average example of an authentic Belgian Tripel, it had all the key things that I look for in a good example of this style. This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth, the alcohol hardly showed up in the flavor, and it had more then enough good flavors to hold my attention, this is going down quicker then I thought, one of the most drinkable Tripel's I have had, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle by myself. What I liked most about this beer was everything, all aspects of this beer came out just the way they should and there was nothing off about this beer, a very well rounded beer. What I liked least about this beer is the fact that I have never seen it around here, we get a good variety of Belgian imports in this part of Michigan and I am surprised that I don't see this on the shelf next to the other awesome Belgian beers, what's the deal. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good Tripel, it provided just what I want form this style, but since I can't find it around here, who knows when I will be able to try this beer again, I know if I did see it again I wouldn't buy just one bottle. I highly recommend giving this beer a try, if you want to know what an authentic Belgian Tripel tastes like try this beer and you should get a good idea on what this style is all about. This beer made for a pretty good first impression from Corsendonk, they did a great job with this beer and you can be sure that I will try more of their beers if given a chance, this beer is a straight up good Tripel, no doubt about it. I am very happy to be drinking this beer on my 400th review, it made for a great celebratory beer and a fun beer to review. With more great beers like this just waiting for me to try them, I can't wait to see what the next 400 new beers has in store for me."

"O: Great Belgian Triple. Smooth and drinkable"
""
""
"O: Not what I think of when I think of a tripel. The flavor is light and crisp, and relatively straightforward. A nice change if you're looking for a tripel that's a little different."
""
"Overall a super-easy drinking tripel on the lighter side of things. I wish it came in at a lower price-point."
""
"This beer completes me. I LOVE this beer. The appearance is incredible. Golden and cloudy with yeast still floating in the beer. The head is thick, white, lasts a long time and leaves lacing at each level you drink. The aroma is sweet, sugar and yeast. The flavor is sublime with a hi of fruitiness that smoothly transitions into a slight bitter bite that is just enough to cleanse the pallet before your next drink. This also leads to it being an easy drinking beer and one that is strong enough at 7.5 alc to make its presence known but doesn't sneak up on you. I honestly think this may be my absolute favorite beer. "

"Overall: I have had this beer plenty of times before and many more in the future. A very nice tripel indeed and happy I was able to score a few of these in the past month."

"Great traditional tripel character offered in this tasty brew with tons to offer the senses"
"Poured into a tulip glass this brew has a clean crisp yellow wheat color with a full 2 finger white head. The carbonation was very active but once settled the brew was quite clear. The aroma was quite sweet with hints of plum, banana, and some alcohol as well. The taste was dry and sweet. There is banana, grapes, and very light malt notes. Alcohol is present in the dry finish. The carbonation makes the flavors pop and this brew is quite refreshing."
""
"Impressive - a quality brew. It's light, yet full-bodied and dry. Good hop aroma, despite the age of the bottle. Slightly sweet, but not cloying. A tasty tripel that's well worth your time."

"O: Overall, a good tripel. It's a little bland on the flavor with the yeast dominating a bit too much. Still, it smells good and has a great feel to it."
"A little bit lighter in terms of flavor that what I had expected. A very good take on the style, but a bit lacking in overall punch. Well worthy of another...and another though - highly drinkable triple that is very enjoyable."
"Overall, this beer was great, I would like to try it fresh."

"This brew poured out as a muddy looking golden color with a white head on top. The head settles a little bit but keep a white cap on top of the beer. The smell of the beer gives off some soft Belgian yeast aromas, some bread and grains with just a hint of spice also. The taste of the beer is sweet and had a good bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied and has a good softness to it. Overall it's good brew once it warms up a bit."
""
""
"O-Belgian Ale,Tripel,Fruits.. That can't be bad."
"Cheers!"
"Overall-a nice beer, seems more a Tripel than a Pale but who cares, I’m interested in the beer and this one hit its mark, worth a try."
"A good tasting beer, sweet and spicy malts some orange peel and corrinder. Finishes dry and spicy. Medium mouthfeel with a spicy upfront character followed by dry bitter finish that clean. A good well made brew. It tends to be lighter and not very complex which I think works in it's favor."
"Overall: Extremely nice beer. Will be having again if I can find it.."
"Overall, I'm disappointed with this one. Belgium is MY land of beer and this was not up to par. Just average compared to the others I've had."
"Overall: it stayes one of my favorites. Not the most complex, but so nice!"
"A great triple, highly recommended."
"selfhatinghipster.com"
"Very dense head that holds for a while but leaves no lace when it fades. Hazy pale golden colour, smell of spices (clove?), mango (most of all), citrus, banana. It feels dry on the palate, fuzzy. Taste is the same of smell, only more citrus in this case, orange peel dominating. Bitter finish."
"D: Highly drinkable, pleasant beer for a nice summer day, I enjoyed this one."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"This was a 2007 bottle, had already peaked. Must try a younger, better stored one."
"Pours a nice golden / pale yellow with a nice white fluffy lasting head. Aroma has a nice citrusy hops with lemon and orange peel fruity notes. Taste is a nice sweet citrusy hops lemon and orange peel with some nice malt and yeast. Nice lively carbonation and nice medium body with a nice crisp mouth feel on the palate. Finish is sweet citrusy hops with some lemony orange peel, some light grapefruit and pineapple notes ending with a nice yeasty malty character. Overall a very good flavorful crisp and refreshing brew. I would drink this again, very nice"
"Hazy light amber body with 3 finger head (medium sized bubbles). Not getting much on the nose, maybe some coriander and yeast. Very spicy on the tongue, and as it warms I get more of the bright, fruity flavor (banana, orange, a bit of lime perhaps). The yeast is also apparent, adding that nice bread-y quality. The beer is a bit dry and very carbonated. Overall this is a great tripel. Not as heavy as some I've had either."
"would be a classic with a better nose ...."
"#4 of 9."
"A category that, in my view, suffers from great abuse, a good tripel can look like bilgewater but still taste wonderful. Or it can look appealing but taste like bilgewater. Rare is it, then, that I get to drink a tripel that both looks *and* tastes great. As well-behaved as any Belgian beer, you'll find all your favorite tripel characteristics presented in a well-balanced, polite and understated manner. No ham-handed orange-juice yeasties here, nor will you be dehydrated from over-hopping as is so common these days. Dare I say that this is... uh... refreshing? Well, almost. Puts most other tripels to shame."
"-Cheers"
"D - I am happy it's a 750 :)"
"The CPJ"
"On the whole, a decent enough tripel. Would have preferred a bit more robustness in character and feel from it, but it's by no means a bad beer. I'd revisit La Fin or St Bernardus before this one again, though."
"One of my favorites, I'm always happy when it's on the menu. Pours beautiful light clear gold, with excellent lacing. Scents of light yeast, sweet straw, and flowers, just nice. Very pleasant flavor, more so than its darker sister beer, light sweetness with just the right amount of bitterness and yeastiness, hard water background adds to the experience nicely. Very carbonated, so pour with care. Drinks easy, so bring extra money. Overall one of the best around."
"Pour brings a light golden color that is mostly transparent with a several-finger white head. Good retention and quite a bit of lacing as it goes down. Thin cap and a good collar. The nose brings hay and some light earthiness along with some grain and a bit of floral hop character. Flavor is light and refreshing with hay and grain plus some mild bitterness and a bit of a floral quality. Pretty clean, yet fairly uneventful. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with good carbonation. Good beer overall. Quite nice. Thanks again."
"Nevertheless - a wonderful brew and the one I come back to."
"D- Very much so. One of the best tripels that I've had."
"D: Great for an after dinner brew. Well crafted, but one was enough for an evening."
"D: I find myself swirling it a bit in an attempt to dissipate the carbo."
"D - Delicious and refreshing."
"A solid brew, through and though."
"Very nice beer; were it not for the faint soapiness, would have been received even more favorably."
"Very interesting beer."
"Conclusion: I love tripels, it might even be my favorite style, but this is a weaker tripel in my opinion. It is just a more tame version of the great ones out there, but it does make up for its downsides by being so drinkable."
"Overall, a nice example of a Belgian Ale; however not my personal ""cup of tea"" as it were. Perhaps something more flavorful would be more to my liking."
"Nevertheless, I like this beer. There is a distinct Belgian yeast and citrus aroma along with a nice Belgian lace that sticks around for a good bit. There is a medium bread-y yeast flavor as well as some lingering citrus, mainly orange in my opinion. It's not a lemony tart, more of a rounder citrus fruit. A good bit of spice at the end finishes this up nicely. I'm no spice expert, but if I had to wager a guess I'd say coriander and maybe black peppercorn."
"Feel is a touch light. With that big of head, I expected a bit more structure. Still, it goes down very smoothly and easy drinking. I do like this beer a lot"
"A good drinker. A bit dry for me, but a good change of pace. Sweet, tart, and bitter all seemed more toned down here than in the brown, though the dryness seemed to accentuate the tartness in the end. On the other hand, the carbonation was more biting here and the alcohol more burning."
"Pair this with any cuisine, and it will improve the entire meal. A classic example of the tripel style, this ale is very well made and a pleasure to drink."
"I really enjoy the Corsendonks. Great to taste this against the Brown. Both are somewhat tangy, but the brown is more savory where the pale is lighter and more citrusy. Neither is overwhelmingly heavy; likewise neither is particularly light. A Great level of carbonation and effervescence, the mouthfeel is wonderful."
"As close to perfect drinkability as I've encountered with the style. This should pair fabulously with a wide variety of autumn-seasonal cuisine - both dinner and dessert."
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy orange with a foamy, long lasting, white head. Pleasant yeasty, fruity aroma. Big, tangy, well carbonated body. Complex flavor of ripe fruit, Belgium yeast, brewing sugar and earthy hops. Long lasting, dry finish. Excellent beer."
"Drinkabilty - I think this is a good starter tripel for someone. Its mild and easy to drink but lacks the flavors i so enjoy with tripels. This is no way as good as la fin or any chimay ales. Its ok, but not worth the 4$ i spend on it imo. One and done for me"
"Great beer. Kind of like a Fin du Monde."
"D: probably no more than 2, even you dont feel the alcohol, the effects still there"
"A Great beer to drink by itself or with a nice meal."
"This is a good example of a tripel, though I am wondering what exactly happened to the spiciness, as they just don't seem to show up in the taste. It's also a bit weaker than many tripels, which should make it a little more drinkable. One thing it isn't short of, however, is sweetness."
"D - Very drinkable, the flavor profile of this beer is subtle and perfectly balanced. Each of the primary elements of this beers flavor, malt, hops, and yeast, is present in just the right amount and at just the right time. The hops compliment the rich, continental malt very nicely and the yeast is just strong enough to set things off and mark this as a proper belgian beer. A true classic, I have often overlooked this beer because it is so readily available and offers no thrill when I see it on a store shelf. Having it again for the first time in several years, I am reminded that it is a better beer than many other, rarer, examples of its style."
"D - Overall enjoyable and refreshing but somewhat filling."
"D : more simple and laid back than most tripels, but a welcome change of pace."
"D- A little heavy on the funk for sustained drinking, but light enough to take down easy."
"D - Very refreshing, could drink this as an interesting session beer."
"Pale yellow with a slight haze and a big dense foamy Belgian head. Lively carbonation that adds to the spicey /peppery flavor. Fruity apple and sweet malty aromas. Flavors aplenty with a sweet maltiness in the beginning, a spicy, peppery middle and a hoppy citrus lemon finish. A fairly dry finish but with some bitter aftertaste. Lots of different things goings on here. All kinds of aromas and flavors along with the beautiful look of a Belgian ale. The higher ABV is not at all noticeable."
"Pours a golden color topped with big fluffy white head, with lots of carbonation rising. As soon as I popped the cork, I could smell this one. The aroma is pretty strong and it quite fruity (namely apples) with a healthy dose of the yeastiness I like in tripels, and a bit of spiciness. The taste, however, doesn't quite live up to the expectations the aroma generated. A nice fruitiness and spiciness, and a (very) slight hoppiness, but they're not as strong as I'd like, and fade pretty quickly. After about 45 minutes, the beer was almost as room temperature and improved a bit. The high carbonation makes for a fuzzy mouthfeel on top of an otherwise thin body for the style. The beer feels crisp and dry, similar to some saisons I've had. Easily drinkable."
"a tight head of bubbles of pure white, about two fingers... yellow orange and a bit cloudy. nose of belgian sugar cane blended nicely with the malt. heavy floral, lillies and lavender, pine wonderful blend. no overall sugar sweet. a tad bitter dry finish with some straw qualities of munich malt. mild citrus honey. i nice triple for those that are turned off by the sugariness of belgian beer."
"Very decent tripel: refreshing and complex at the same time."
"D: A good brew that treads the line of tripel and Belgian pale ale which is definitely better tasted with some warming to bring out more malt complexity and gives the carbonation a chance to tone down. Decent but a little lackluster. I like the Corsendonk Brown Ale better."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light, but dry. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Overall - A solid beer"
"It's been too long since I last had Corsendonk's brown ale, so I don't know how this compares, but this stands well on its own, if not absolutely world-class like Chimay Blue. Recommended."
"Overall I really liked this one. It is a bit unusual in the amount of citrus flavor it contains, but I feel it worked in this case. The spice and hints of hops at the end helped balance, keeping it from being too sweet."
"D- a nice drinker by all means, and a very nice trippel, just still kinda weird drinking the solid particles, i had to take off for it somewhere"
"Overall a good beer, altough not the best of its kind."
"Mouthfeel is medium with fairly intense carbonation (par for the style) and excellent drinkability."
"D - This is a pretty good tripel that is easy drinking and hides it potency quite well."
"Mouthfeel is very light and fluffy, with a dry and clean finish. Goes down very smooth and very drinkable. Even though the ABV is a little higher, it is still very refreshing on a warm night."
"Overall, this isn't a bad Tripel, just not the best that I've had. All the ingredients are there for a great beer, it just falls a bit short because of minor flaws here and there. Make no mistake, though, this is still a tasty beer that I'll have no problem finishing."
"Drinkability: Well this is an OK beer, but I'm not thinking I'll be having another unless it is with food. The flavors are a bit simple and one dimensional and by the end of the beer it's a bit too much like drinking orange soda bittered with zest."
"Very tasty, a very good and well balanced beer that gets more flavorful as it warms. A definite recommendation."
"I wonder how much better it can get..."
"Pours a pale golden/straw color with large bubbled white head, but the head wasn't very thick and lacked good retention. Nose has musty fruits. On the palate there's a fruit syrupy sweetness up front, then a honeyed-Champagne like middle to finish with a lot of carbonation and a woody-metallic tang at the end. Certainly not a sessionable beer for me but not bad on the drinkability."
"Drinkability: Not the best example of a tripel available, but this beer holds its own. Still a savory beer and definitely an easier drink than many tripels."
"Score: 4"
"OVERALL: Good triple for sure. This is a much better triple than their double is a double. Everything just meshed better on this one. Very nice looking and drinkable until the end. One to try if you like the style."
"Tangy with orchard fruit flavors up front. Well balanced with light malt sweetness, floral hops and muted alcohol warmth. Finishes with dried apricot, white grapes and expensive honey spiced with clove. Plenty of silky Co2."
"D - For me, tripels can sometimes be a little bit much, especially in alcohol heat and feel. This one doesn't have much of that burn in it. Overall has a smooth feel with tons of Belgian character and flavors. Very enjoyable, would definitely look for this one again."
"Drinkability: A decent tripel that's pretty drinkable. It's not the most flavorful tripel out there but it's still damn good. I bought this beer on a whim because it came with a glass so I wasn't expecting much. That said, I'm really pleased with this beer. Buy it and get the glass too!"
"Drinkability is good as a desert beer, but I don't think it would make a good session beer. Dry with a nice, mild aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Corsendonk pale ale is a nice middle ground in tripels; it has a good flavor which, while not overly complex, is also very approachable. I could drink tons of this stuff."
"Slainte!"
"Mouthfeel is okay, a bit viscous though, which is surprising, but the carbonation is spot on and makes the brew really creamy after a tounge-swirl."
"D- I could drown in this or any other Belgian triple."
"Mouthfeel - Quite carbonated, medium body, creamy and dry."
"Thanks to Mel for the treat. Served in a ridicuously oversized wine glass with a cloudy/yeasty pour. Dark amber to brown in color. Aroma is of red wine and freshly baked bread. Sweet and pleasant. My initial flavor impression is of dark chocolate and raisins - bittersweet and dark fruits. Its not hoppy, not phenolic and not very belgian-like at all. Again though its sweet and pleasant. Mouthfeel is light and finishes sweet. The bottle was shared with my friend and was finished quickly."
"A tasty treat, lower on alcohol than some, so it easy to drink, but not the best trippel I've had by a long shot. Worth trying. Probably not going to top my list of beers to buy when I think of trippels though."
"Extremely drinkable for a Tripel, tasty and very enjoyable."
"D- something is missing here. little too dry and salty for me. a little more sweet malts would added a little more depth"
"Overall A very drinkable nice triple, but nothing too distinctive to set it apart from the bunch. Quite nice though."
"A bit difficult to drink - the flavours seem somewhat out of whack, and the alcohol isn't particularly well integrated. I think I like the Pater dubbel better."
"This beer was brewed ""by the master crafstmen in the classic Belgian ""tripel"" style"". A little lighter in body than most of the other tripels I have had, which increased its drinkability. Drank very well and left a pleasant after-taste."
"This poured a slightly hazy gold with fluffy off-white head. It smelled like lemon zest and clove and sour yeast, with salty and grassy hops and a bit of alcohol. It tasted like waxy lemon and sour yeast, with some salty and grassy hops and pepper. It was slightly thick and oily with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this tasted a bit strange, but was at least clean and drinkable. It had nice body and hid the alcohol decently. There was nothing unique or exciting about this beer, but perhaps age would help mellow out the waxy and salty flavors. But while this beer is fresh, I'm really not a fan."
"Great atmosphere. Pretty solid appearance, great nose. Complex, full flavor, and light body. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"this might have been a bad bottle. there was A LOT of sediment on the poor for a bottle that has been sitting on the shelf for a while."
"Very drinkable, indeed. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to tracking this down and trying it."
"If I was jonesing for a Belgian and there was nothing else around, to include the better Belgian-style domestic micros, I'd go for it because it's a good beer, but I just can't call it a good -tripel.-"
"Again, this beer reminds more of a Belgian Pale due to the drinkability and balance (less sweet). A very good beer that I am really happy I tried, in fact I think I'm going to grab another bottle or two to enjoy later. If you like Duvel, this beer is for you as it reminded me of it. Great."
"Overall this isn't a terribly complex trippel but everything that is done is done well and all flavors are crisp. Worth a shot."
"The after taste makes this beer a one and done for me which is a shame because the beer opens up well. If that oil/metallic tastecould get in check this would be a much better Tripel."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not quite as captivating as some of the top tripels out there but solid all around."
"I haven't had this beer in a while. I was very surprised that beer advocate calls it a triple. I think it's more exactly like what they call it; a belgian pale ale. I enjoyed it quite a lot. It's like a duvel with a little less alcohol only a little more fruity. Good appearance, very good smell and taste. One to try again if it's been a while for you as well."
"If you like La Fin du Monde and Duvel I think you will enjoy this beer"
"D- No question about it... very drinkable"
"Drinkability: Who knew beers named after old ladies could be so lively, so spry, so invigorating. Not me!"
"Again, this is the most nonintrusive brew I've ever had: very in the middle and sure to please even the most non beer drinker."
"MF&D - body seemed fine, nothing special, nothing bad. carbonation was good and gassy for the first half of the bottle. the beer wasnt that creamy and mouth coating but I can harldly say I care about that kind of stuff after so much beer. a decent brew, but I have better equal price choices that I would pick from now on."
"Drinkability: This goes down fast, but the alcohol is very apparent. Its OK, not at all my favorite tripel."
"Drinkability: Although both the aroma and flavor is rather restrained for a tripel, the lack of complexity actual makes the beer all the more drinkable"
"Overall, this is an exceptional beer...I am really enjoying this one. It's funky, and I am liking the hop notes coupled with the funky Belgian flavor. As the beer continues to warm up, it gets better and better. Hoppy, funky, an sweet. Drinkable and delicious."
"Very drinkable. Very good beer."
"D: One of the most full-flavoured tasty Belgian pales I've had, if I was judging it in that style, didn't know it was a tripel when I had it, I guess that explains the big flavours. A must try."
"My bottle had a lot of sediment. The color was like straw- a hazy golden yellow. The smell was malty and a hint of coriander. But is not an overwhelming strong smell. The taste is crisp and sweet, some hints of banana. the mouthfeel is very light and bubbly. it is a very drinkable beer."
"Poured into my St. Bernardus Watou glass a very nice cloudy yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice two-finger creamy white head, tons and tons of nice thick sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some bananas, and corinander. The taste is slightly sweet, nice maltiness, yeast notes, with a touch of bananna/coriander. Medium body, medium carbonation, creamy texture. Very drinkable, this is an awesome little brew."
"D: Great tripel, and a well-done representation of the style."
"The drink had a pale yellow appearance with a rather large head with good retention. I sensed a slight metallic aroma from the beer, mostly mixed within a yeasty, biscuit-like flavoring. Pretty sour in general, with that metallic taste in there. Great carbonation; really helped in making a crisp drink. Overall, pretty darn good."
"Very well balanced ale. Complex with lots of flavors complimenting each other...very enjoyable."
"Wow. What a delicious beer. Appearence is the only aspect of this beer that is uninteresting. It smells like what I think a Belgian beer should. It has all those flavors without those more hot fusol flavors that some Belgians tend to have. A beutiful color is topped only by the balance of malt ( hint of sweetness), hop bitterness, and smoothxester profile. One of my favorite goto beer. Also in a corked bottle that surpasses the beauty of any champaine Ive ever had."
"I'd say this Belgian is lower on the complexity scale, but what it did well allowed me to enjoy it from beginning to end. The interplay of the initial mouthfeel and lingering taste on the palate demanded I continue to sip. An enjoyable cycle until my glass was empty. Try it out."
"-Dotson"
"The foam exploded as soon as I popped the cap off. I had to pour immediately and the glass ended up being 75% foam so I poured a second as well. Appearance was very pale, head retained well throughout. Smelled of sour malt. Tasted of sour malt and ethanol, very heavy on the ethanol. Mouthfeel was decent, but there was a very unpleasant lingering aftertaste."
"Made my choice to drink at Max's on Broadway. The beer looked and smelled great. I thought the beer was over spiced and hid many of the good flavor. It was smooth and not too heavy in the mouth, which made it go down easy. I would have to be in the right mood to have this beer again. but I wouldnt put it past me."
"D - pleasant and easy to drink."
"The lead aroma is the yeast with something citrus and herbal like close behind. Medium mouthfeel. The flavor begins yeasty and ends with a drier, herbal finale. A good Abbey ale."
"I could totally drink this in vast quantities while overlooking a river valley on a clear, warm summer day."
"Very good, cheap for style, and drinkable."
"Pours a very watery pale yellow color, humungous white frothy head, somewhat lasting. Aroma of very light flowers, straw, sweet. Somewhat musky aroma. Not strong. Grape and light sweet fruit smell, some malt. Grape fizzy musky tastej grapeskins, floral. Soft mouthfeel. A little warming Kinda bland. Better as it wams."
"Poured into a tulip for an orangish body with yeast particles floating in it. Also, the brew came with a voluminous three-finger head that took forever to die and I could hear it descending (like the sound of rice krispies when you add milk). Has that great Belgian smell, hints of hops and yeast to create a fruity smell like orange and banana along with some mild caramel malts. Taste is more of the same as the beer is a fluffy medium body but also a little thick. Smooth and quasi-creamy, the caramel malt is really assertive with the hops for a sweeter, milder fruit taste that is subdued and finishes easy. There are other malts in play as well, such as nut or bread, maybe even toffee. The fruit tastes are pronounced: orange, banana, hints of apple. An easy going triple that I can have anytime."
"Another dangerous Belgian Tripel. I could drink these all day in the summer and all night in the winter as versatile as it is. Not as complex or strong as I've had, but that does not score badly with me on this. Just makes me feel like drinking more!"
"Medium body and carbonation, quite drinkable."
"Very refreshing taste, pleasing to the palate and no surprises from the aroma. Very nice beer, not a bold or breathtaking tripel, but good and refreshing."
"Notes from: 07/27/04."
"From the few beers I have had from this brewer, I am not pleased at all."
"Excellent ale and I have more than once drank more in one sitting than I should have."
"Future outlook: Fantastic beer that I wish I'd tried sooner. Will certainly purchase again."
"Taste: The vanilla and fruitiness from the smell are present in the taste. Very creamy. It kind of reminds me of New Holland's Black Tulip Trippel, and I wouldn't be surprised if New Holland stole this beers yeast to make their tripel."
"A nice easy drinking beer. It's not huge or aggressive but a fine bodied enjoyable brew. Tasty and smooth."
"D: Good, clean with a well hidden abv and bright crisp grainy flavor that definitely is worthy seeking out."
"Pours gold with a slight haze and a big head. Nice light aroma of yeast and malt. Cloves, pepper, and grass round out the nose. Good esterous taste with a blend of spice and just enough hops. Good amount of lighter fruits; pear, green apple, and a little banana. Very nice."
"Pours a nice golden color with a thick white head that lasts throughout. Aroma is slightly spicy with crisp, light fruit notes. Has a sweet almost champagne like taste to it but not too carbonated. Apple, pear, light raisin flavors balanced by slight alcohol warmth. I enjoyed this one very much."
"Now THIS is a tripel! I've had this before and thought I had already rated it. Nice yeasty and spicy aroma with a hint of hops and clove. Pour was a beautiful light gold with a huge 3 finger head and tons of small rising bubbles and great sediment. Taste was delicious. Extremely dry and spicy. Pear, apple and yeast in the front with a strong bite from the carbonation and a peppery element in the cheeks. Great beer"
"Drinkability - alcohol is well disguised and at 7.5%, objectively not very high for a triple. Quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Pours clear golden with a fluffy head. Nice lacing. Aroma is grassy and citric. There is a grassy/earthy undertone to the flavor, but mostly it is crisp, clean citrus. I wouldn't want to do it to this beer, but if you started a trend of serving this with a slice of lemon, I think it would become popular with the crowd that can't appreciate this one on it's own."
"Four pack been sitting on the shelves for years, blew off the dust and poured into the glass. Vibrant gold color with a touch of orange, crazy carbonation and a huge fizzy white head. Aroma is of blended sour fruits and grass. I pucker a bit as I sip on this relatively lively on the tongue not real crisp with the finish. Flavor is earthy with notes of pears and grapefruit. Don't know quite how well this should hold up under long storage and this pack is considerably old. Still interesting and enjoyable, would like to find a new bottle and compare."
"Nonetheless, this is quite good, although not nearly the equivalent of Corsendonk's Christmas Ale or Abbey Brown. Well worth trying, and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not too high in ABV% for a Tripel, making this one a very drinkable beer."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. Nicely refreshing and smooth. Hides the alcohol. Perhaps not a ""typical"" tripel, it is a beer worth getting. Also, I love the bottles!"
"I could see enjoying a few of these at one sitting with no problem. The ones I had were not aged, and supposedly this gets even smoother and more rounded with age. I kept a couple bottles which will stay in storage for a while just to compare. All in all, a very nice pale ale."
"D- This was an enjoyable tripel and worked well with pizza, but there are countless other tripels that can be enjoyed more for the same amount of money as this one."
"Notes: Not my favorite tripel or my favorite Belgian. Not a terrible beer but, as I have written, forgettable."
"D - Perhaps a little strong to be very drinkable, but it drinks very well for its abv."
"D - This is a decent, well-made beer. The Trappist varieties perhaps have a little more complexity though. I have to admit though that Corendonk pale was one of the first Belgian beers I ever tried I still have a fondness for it years later."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. I guess it would be a good once and a while beer."
"Drinkability - Very good, I was skeptical of the yeast floating but I didn't notice it. If you are a fan of Belgian Ales you will absolutely like this. Bonus points for the ABV, which seems higher than your average Belgian Ale"
"I am a little disappointed, as their brown is pretty damned good and this was just so so. That being said, I would probably buy it again if the price were right."
"Drink ability= Definitely a drinkable beer, although pairings would be difficult outside of cheeses and crackers. I think this beer would go well with Piea."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color, with a nice white head. In the aroma, a sweet maltiness. In the taste, a sweet malt and a dry sugar taste. A small bite, and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Nice pale, easy drinking, and non offensive."
"Good mouthfeel, and pretty decent drinkability. A good all around tripel that isn't too artificially sweet like some others out there."
"D - Very high, but no joke @ 7.5%"
"Great medium bodied feel with nice carbonation and superb drinkability."
"Overall - An average Tripel... there are much better examples out there... worth a try once.."
"An interesting beer to say the least, thin white lacey head with a golden color. Smell is of fermented apples and spices. Taste is unique, like cloves and nutmeg ontop of a light malt flavor with subtle hints of malt. Mouthfeel is really bubbley and crisp. It has a pleasant taste and I could drink more then one, but for the price it wouldn't be at the top of beers I'd buy list, but it certainly would be far from the bottom."
"Perhaps the best beer of the night among several. A good beer to sit down and drink without thinking too much about, but also has an above average taste with some complexity to tease the mouth and senses including a great initial hit. Quite happy with this."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is golden in color with millions of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass up to a sparkling white, soapy head. Smell is sweet and spicy. Slight fruitiness and clove smell. Taste is much the same with a slight alcohol presence and warming sensation on the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a bubbly, aggressive carbonation. Drinkability isn't bad. I expected more out of this beer, I guess I've had better Belgians than this and I expected this one to be up to par."
"D: 7.5% abv but this is a nice easy drinking tripel. I think it has a very high drinkability for the style. All around good beer."
"It's a nice tastey triple."
"Been a fan of this beer for years, didn't realise I hadn't reviewed it before."
"D - This is a weird one. In a blind tasting, I might have guessed that this was a boozy American wheat ale or even a witbier. This isn't bad beer, but it is one of the most tangy twangy lemony wheaty beers that I've ever had. This is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but not quite I expected."
"D: I am very disappointed I don't have another of these lying around. This is definitely a beer I could have more than one of."
"Drinkability- Smooth and easy drinking. Not as pleasurable as the Brune, but still a wonderful balanced Belgian Tripel. Possibly bottle conditioned with a lager yeast. Very nice."
"Very pleasant fresh honeyed apple-pear notes.Nicely yeasty. The mouthfeel is extremely effervescent and crisp, giving quite a lightened effect for a largish beer. The flavor is deliciously spicy with corander and clove, crisp apple-y fruitiness, and a surprisingly dry finish. I very much enjoy this restrained sweetness as attempts at the tripel style are often too sweet (see Golden Monkey). The spicy dryness keeps this brew very drinkable and I finish it faster that I would like. Very nice!"
"D: Drinkable, but I'll stick to the Abbey Brown Ale."
"The pour was a bubbly cloudy gold with a two finger white head. The aroma of citrus and honey was present. The taste was close to the smell with a alcoholic after note. The carbonation excites the palate so I wouldn't try to slam this beer down. Enjoy it. It is easy to drink."
"D - Very smooth, drinkable tripel with subtle flavors and well-concealed alcohol presence."
" This one goes to the top of the heap as far as Authentic Belgian Tripels are concerned!"
"My favorite of the beers from Corsendonk. Delicious."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is light in body and has higher carbonation that scrubs my palate clean...As I get deeper into the bottle the carbonation seems to be toned down a bit more, making this beer easier to drink, not so much foaming in the mouth, still though I feel that there could be just a touch less. The beer finishes dry, and leaves my mouth watering for more. A mixture of sweetness and spice lingers in the aftertaste, reminding one of what this beer tastes like. This is a beer I'd drink again, but I think I'd rather try more before coming back, I definitely prefer La Fin Du Monde to this"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beers. Granted I have a bias towards Belgian beers, specifically this style."
"D - Highly drinkable stuff. Not as flavorful as some other belgian tripels, but a very well done example of the style."
"This is one beer that has been seen on a regular basis ar al of the liquor stores that I frequent. Finally decided to give it a try. I poured this one into a deep tulip glass. Ar foamy fluffy white head emerges slowly and the bright orangey yellow golden liquid appears. Smelled floral and sweet- a cpmpletely full aromatic experience. Tasted spicey ad rich, tons of peppery spices, some fruity zest, and a hoppy punch. Smooth going down, very enjoyable. world class."
"Corsendonk's brown Abbey ale was outstanding, and the pale Tripel version is just as good if not better... this is some seriously high-quality stuff... some of the best around... This brew was completely terrific in almost all respects... pours a gorgeous cloudy, hazy color with impressive foamy head with some sediment visible... smell was great - full of fresh grapefruit, citrus and fresh flowers... taste was above and beyond - complemented the aroma strongly with strong floral and citrus notes dominated by an overall sweet, candied flavor that really hit home... mouthfeel was outstanding, and as far as the 7.5% ABV, you can forget about detecting any alcohol - this beer is all candy and sweets... great finish with a wonderful aftertaste... can't really say anything bad about this one... a must-try... Definitely recommended..."
"Pours a light gold and is much lighter and doesn't have the punch and flavor of the brown ale. Which is absolutely normal since this is the pale ale. Overall, pale ales are less my style and I would tend to side with the brown, which I admit I am biased towards because of personal preference. Rating it on it's style, it is very well made and is definitely worth trying. It is just not my most favorite style is all."
"D: This is one of those beers I could sip any day. This is not a beer to just slam over, but rather to savor and sip."
"Pretty good tripel."
"Drinks alright, but a bit too complex too session on. A solid but not spectacular tripel"
"This beer is sandy golden is color with a rich creamy white head. Noted is free flowing sediment. It imparts a spicy aroma which I would place as eigher grains of paradise or corriander. It has a spicey sweet (almost honey) malty taste. The spices are really well balanced. If I didn't know this was a pale ale I may mistake this for a belgian white ale instead. Just a breat beer."
"Not the most complex or rich tripel from Belgium, but the alcohol is well-covered and it is easy to drink. It has a nice aroma that doesn't quite translate as richly to the taste. One to choose for a milder version of the style."
"Pours a nice gold with a big carbonated head; a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass constantly replenishes the head. Aroma is yeasty and citrusy while the taste is very zesty and crisp, a little sweet, but not as great as some other beers of the style. A tad flat going down, but nothing awful. All in all a solid brew. One of the most drinkable Belgians I have had."
"Review added 11-11-2007, translated from french 2-27-2008."
"Overall, I was quite pleased with the Corsendonk Pale Abbey Ale. It's definitely got that Belgian flair and complex, alcoholic trip you'd expect from an authentic tripel. Nicely done indeed."
"I don't like Corsendonk Abbey Pale Ale as much as I like Abbey Brown Ale and Christmas Ale, despite the fact that I've given all three identical flavor scores (Christmas Ale was my first Belgian beer and I have a sneaking suspicion that I'd score it higher nowadays). If you like a certain austere elegance from your tripels rather than the down and dirty aggressiveness of a 'Mad Bitch', give this one a whirl."
"D: Drinkable, but I'll stick to the Abbey Brown Ale from these guys - it's better."
"This is a good beer and a nice representation of the style. Nothing mind-blowing, mind you, but solid. I'd have it again for sure. Recommended."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle. Best by date clearly stamped on the neck label. 7.5% ABV. They had a suggestion for aging the ale on the back of the bottle, but I did not take the advice. Nice fluffy snow white head that receded slowly leaving a nice clingy lace down the sides of the glass. Bright pale hazy golden yellow color. Very bright yellow with mixed in sediment when back lit. Certainly a decent looking presentation with the brightness of its color and the big fluffy white head. Smell is rather sweet like sugar cookie dough. Mild fruity tones also come into the nose. Slight alcohol esters mixed in with a slight spiced note that hides in the back ground. There are hints of a sweet bread dough flavor that come to mind with the initial taste. Certainly can taste the sweetness brought on by the pale malt and the alcohol. Mild hints of hops in the finish making for a well balance taste. The flavors on the tongue certainly have that distinct Belgium flavor. Slight yeasty flavor mixed with a mild dry bitterness in the aster taste. Easy drinking and enjoyable beer. I will certainly try this offering again."
"This is a pretty solid beer that holds up to multiple servings. Not overly complex, but what it does it does well."
"This beer poured a straw color with a thick head  tight bubbles and nice lacing. The aroma is spicy/floral and the hops are apparent. The taste is spicy and subtle with some earthy flavors  nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is shy of medium. Overall, this is an easily palatable brew that simply works."
"Nicely balanced tripel that is perfect for introducing someone to the style, and veterans can simply pick up and enjoy. Not overly robust like some tripels, but it has some substance and is rather delicious. Tasteful and satisfying."
"Overall, a good, but somewhat boring, Belgian pale. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I wouldn't turn down a pint of it either."
"D - Apart from the appearance, this is a very solid brew. Wonderfully refreshing and light but full of flavor and complexity. Very little alcohol effect. Highly recommended."
"Notes: At 7.5% this is mild to moderate in comparison to some of the other Tripels out there, but without sacrificing flavor... However it was the relative lack of complexity that puts this beer into a lower tier than some of the other Belgians out there. Nevertheless, this was a good one that I may pick up again."
"EXCELLENT BREW!"
"Overall: A solid tripel that unfortunately does nothing to attain its potential. An OG to be sure and a solid intro to the style. Doesn't let down, but does nothing to ""wow"" you either. Just plain solid."
""
"Pours a hazy pale golden orange color with an explosive soapy white head, left some light lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is of candi sugar, tart apple, & honey. The taste is sweet from the candi sugar, some honeysuckle, granny smith apple. The brew tends to stay on the sweet side. The feel is well carbonated and finished a bit slick and sweet. Besides being a bit unbalanced on the sweet side, this is a pretty good tripel and at 7.5% alcohol you can drink a few and still remember your name."
"Overall: This is a pretty decent tripel, and one I enjoy. It is not outstanding, and is a bit more subtle than many of my favorites, but it is well worth drinking."
"I can't quite figure this one out. Nice 3 finger head on initial pour. Light head that lingers the whole time. The smell of hops and citrus in somewhat powerful. Expected more but not bad. Smooth, creamy taste. Light, leaves you wanting more. Again, better once gets closer to room temp. 750ml"
"Good drinkability, better than some. An enjoyable Tripel."
"This is a fairly light and dry beer, no doubt due to the use of the candi sugar... boderline watery, but certainly not bad. The carbonation is wonderful (I love corked beer) and this is very drinkable. While not packed with flavour and a little boring for the style, this is a good offering and pairs well with the heat."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer due to the fact that it's so tame and less flavorful compared to other tripels. I guess that's the one thing it's got going for it. I wouldn't get it again, there are many more tripels out there that are far better."
"D- A decent example of the style, but far from a great beer."
"pours a hazy straw yellow with a four finger fluffy white head with a very easy pour that settles to a rocky one inch with patchs of sticky lace. aromas of apples, pears, and hint of spice, wheat malt mixing with fruit flavors and slight spice and touch of hops make for a great taste. i think the lower abv 7.50 % works so much better for this style than the higher abv tripel styles. mouthfeel light, dry, carbonation ok. really liked this one and would buy it again."
"A very nice beer. This would be a great beer for light fish. Not the benchmark for the style, but worth trying if it is available to you. A style worth exploration."
"Old standard. Kind of a belgian session ale if there could be such a thang. Lots of the classic Belgian characteristics like the viniousness, and depth of flavor. Pours with a small head and some lace. Nice golden amber color. Yeasty honey spicey aroma and flavor. Flavor has extra light honey, champagney, zesty flavors."
"Served a crisp golden yellow with a diminishing head. The aroma was lightly floral with light fruits. There was a good balance of malt and hops with a slight yeast bite. The alcohol was somewhat present and the beer sat moderately light on the tongue with slight carbonation. This beer was somewhat enjoyable, but not the best of the style."
"330 ml bottle, named Corsendonk Agnus - Tripel. ABV is 7.5%. Courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Very pale clear golden colour, huge head. Sweetish and fruity aroma, both fresh and fermenting fruits, slightly yeasty, hints of spices. Flavour is moderately sweet and spicy, theres an unusual element of saltiness / sea water. Light bodied for its strength, but the alcohol is noticeable. Low bitterness."
"I gave this one a try last evening as I love the other offerings from Brouwerij Corsendonk. This beer poured into a chalice with a golden color, with a yellow tinge to it while also possessing a huge, almost out of control white colored head that had retention and did leave some nice lacing. Not sure if the temp could have had any play on the extreme carbonation that seemed to be at play? The aromas where nice, sweet malt that seemed to have properties of rock candy, spiciness and pepper come out along with a citrus fruit like property. The taste is also good, lemon come out in front then it turns to more of the spices that seem to tickle the tongue. Another thing that I notice is the amount of bubbling that is going on, see a ton of bubbles transverse up the side of the glass. This is a good beer, and they way I described it above I guess I would expect to give it a better rating but for me it does not live of to its brother brews from Corsendonk. Overall I would say that this is a solid Belgium Pale but do think that there are others out there that are better and more interesting."
"Good, but not as good as the Abbey Brown."
"A nice silk-screened bottle, neatly caged. Pours with huge head with big suds that sit for the entire course. A slightly musty appearance but a very pretty yellow colour. Very pretty I feel. Lots of bubbles throughout the body. Appearance a little ""off"" style for a tripel but nice all the same. A wonderful bouquet - grassy, floral hops, some coriander and a strong lemon coating. Right on! Well carbonated mouthfeel that carries itself quite well, medium-to-full bodied. Flavours seem to fall a little short. A little too grainy, but a nice malt that shines through. Again that lemony taste sneaks up. No alcohol present. Good, complete, simply lovely."
"Thanks for the sample biegaman!"
"355ml bottle: Poured with the promised giant head of white foam. My bottle was extremely sedimented. Light and airy aroma, not undifferent from a European pilsner. Lightly spicy palate , but not as flavored as Id thought. Disappointingly bland. (#2639 - 1/7/07)"
"drinkability is great. very good, balanced, and very drinkable."
"This is always a favorite of mine. It is a great and tasty Belgian. It may seem a little small for a triple based on America's ""bigger is better"" beer culture, but this is an extremely well made and well balanced example of the style."
"Pours a nice amber-ish yellow thats got a nice clarity to it. On top is a fluffy white head that, if you aren't careful, could go wild and engulf your beer vessel. Looks good. Smells slightly of the typical belgian spices and fruit esters...corriander, cloves, banana, etc. Now, in a tripel, I expect a nice big, pungent nose, but this one was disappointingly weak. There were only slight traces of these aromas. Taste was unfortunately weak as well, although not entirely upsetting after taking a few whiffs. There was also a faint detection of skunk in the airy mouthfeel which wasn't too distracting. The beer is, despite its shortcomings, rather drinkable as its flavors are much lighter and the mouthfeel being so light. So overall, I wasn't really too impressed with this one. I would not buy it again."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Delirium Tremens tulip-style glass. Huge froth on top of hazy pale orange beer, really nice looking. The smell was a touch skunky, maybe this was sitting on the shelf for a long time. But I could still smell the yeasty aroma so it wasn't a completely poor aroma. The flavor was really good, similar in a bready yeasty way to St. Bernardus Tripel. Maybe a tad more sweet upfront than the St Bernardus, and the mouthfeel was very very thick. Really good Belgian pale ale."
"In a general drinking process this is quite enjoyable. Varieties of flavors, lightness, and texture from the carbonation. The nice sweetness stands out, which makes the dryness such a stark contrast. The carbonation forces a more gradual consumption, which is fine. The alcohol is very well hidden with no sense of burning and little evidence in flavors. Enjoyable."
"A highly drinkable, big Belgian ale. Alcohol and phenolics are present but not overwhelming. The light body and dry finish make it very drinkable, and very in the style. Good stuff."
"Pours light (almost yellow!) and bubbly, with a perfectly white head that sticks to the glass and lasts throughout the drink as a thin layer of dust. Aromas of biscuity malts, light candi sugar, and sharply earthy hops. Understated but beautiful. On the palate, subtlety is the order of the day. Very light body here, and light alcohol for the style, with the flavors following suit. Some pear fruits come out first, followed by a burst of sweetness and a snap of bitterness as the hops show themselves. Sharp carbonation. Dry, bread-and-pepper finish that lasts just long enough. Overall, this is a delicate, subtle triple, with no cloying sweetness. It's wonderful and full of flavor nonetheless."
"A very drinkable beer, not overly intense with the alcohol well hidden. Overall, a very nice example of a Belgian Tripel."
"It poured a nice golden body, with a thin 1"" head. Smell is of citrus and sugar. The taste is nice.. very sweet and citrusy. The level of carbonation is good, with small but plentiful bubbles. I would have this beer again."
"Not undrinkable, but why one would to drink it?"
"D- It is very tasty. Probably will buy this again if I am in the mood for a triple."
"Decent flavor, not a bad tripel. However, doesnt really distinguish itself from others of the style. Prolly not one I would actively pursue or look to have."
"Cheers!"
"As stated on the bottle: Zalig Genieten ""Gloriously Enjoy"""
"Drinkability: Tasty and easy to drink, with a nice refreshing quality."
"This stuff paired excellently with my tortellini pasta in a garlic cream sauce with some cajun, blackened chicken on top. This is definitely a recommended brew, and likely a wonderful pairing beer to compliment many styles of cuisine."
"Golden yellow color, with a frothy white head. Pleasant yeasty smell. Taste is lighter and less sweet than other tripels. Crisp dry flavor, a little spicy. Clean, peppery aftertaste. Probably one of the first Belgians I was ever exposed to; still one I enjoy breaking out."
"Had this in my wine cellar for about 1 year. Poured into my Michael Jackson, Beer Hunter, tasting glass. It pours with a thick head that diminishes to chunky creamy clumps. Looks very appetizing. The nose yeasty orange brown sugar. Taste smooth and creamy, I like this beer nothing is overpowering, just smooth and drinkable."
"Not one of my favorite abbey tripels but I may try to review again at a later time."
"D: With a great flavor combination, and a satisfying finish, would drink a few not noticing the modest, yet still formidable, abv. despite its being lower than the average."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that hides the ABV pretty well with only a couple of hints. Goes down well...drinker beware!"
"Finally got a chance to try this brew. From a large corked bottle, this one pours a clear golden-yellow color with a huge white head. Very good lace, intricate and sticky. The aroma is herbal and earthy. Theres a little peppery phenols and a rustic cereal character. The yeastiness is present, but not as pronounced as Id expected. The brew is a little dry, with a very herbal hoppiness that presents a solid bitterness, lasting throughout the taste. Fairly high carbonation, combined with a medium body. The finish is spicy and bitter. Very enjoyable."
"Corsendonk Agnus in proper glass at Strijdersjhuis in Brugge on 9/13/06."
"Pale honey color, creamy head, resulting in considerable lace and a bit of sediment. Bouquet is malty, some spice, with a bright lemon zest. The taste features refined malts and yeast, lemon and spices, a hint of cherry and candy, with a little alcohol at the end. Full yet mellow mouth, bright on the front palate, creamier and a little sweet on the back. Great drinkability. Should definitely be served at the suggested temp of 45-55 degrees F."
"Pours a hazy gold, pretty chunky, thick white head forms, lots of lace and great retention. Smell is sweet, citrus, yeast, spices, very malty, nice. Taste is malty up front, very grainy and yeasty, citrus, lots of caramel in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with high carbonation, but quite smooth going down. Turns out to be pretty good. I'll sample it fresh again."
"Drinkability: Above average for sure, but (at least at the price I paid for it) too expensive to want to buy again."
"This one definitely benefits from warming up slightly-- the flavor really starts to take shape after a few minutes in the glass. I'm sure my patience would have been well rewarded! I am curious to know if some unmalted wheat was used in brewing this ale; I could be completely off, but the haze, mouthfeel and nice head retention lead me to suspect this might be the case. Overall, I would certainly recommend this beer to anyone who appreciates hoppier Belgian golden ales and tripels that tend towards the drier side. Recommended."
"D: A very nice beer indeed. Complex taste and a nice mouthfeel make this a great drinking experience."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color with a generous head. Smell is sweet, with many spices involved. The taste is not as big as I was anticipating. It mostly consists of the same spices and sweetness, but there fails to be any real explosion in my mouth like traditional belgian tripels. This beer would probably be alright if one hadn't tried a tripel before, but once you've had the best of them its not great."
"It's like a novel that's 3/4 great, but the author gets bored and chintzes on the ending. It's not an abject failure, but it doesn't deliver on some fair upfront promise. The crispness and sassiness add a refreshing aura, but the ABV parnters with the other missteps to make you wonder if it's worth drinking in the future. So the bottle is finished, and really, so is my curiosity about this beer."
"Easily consumable, this is an excellent introduction to the Belgian world of beers. If you find this enjoyable, you'll likely find most of them delicious."
"Hamersly's Bistro in Boston has a fairly interesting beer list; this was one of them. It was a nice yellow color with an amazingly thick, sticky head. It had a sweet aroma. Taste was spice and honey, very pleasant. Good mouthfeel, not too thin. A nice beer to have on a warm summer day when you're waiting for a good meal."
"D - high, smooth and tasty, a nice abbey ale"
"Personally, I like to drink Belgian beer with no yeast at first, then add some of the yeast from the bottle later. This is one beer that tastes quite different with the the yeast mixed in. I don't think I would know it was the same beer if the top half and bottom half were poured into two different glasses."
"750 mL corked champagne bottle, 2005 edition, served in a balloon glass. It pours an unfiltered golden-orange with a finger of white head that leaves rings and sheets of lacing. It smells spicy and phenolic with notes of lemon, banana, along with some tartness and faint alcohol. The body is medium to thick and fairly smooth, and the beer is grassy/spicy, with hints of pear, melon rind, green apple?, wheat, faint yeast, a mild bitterness, and a bit of alcohol. Not too complex, but still a good, highly drinkable tripel."
" Eric"
"I do drink it. And it's spritzy. very carbonated. And tangy. A little spicy, as any good wit should be, with a mild nutmeggy, cinnamony flavor. Very refreshing, and a great summertime beer. Much more full-bodied than Hoegaarden, which will you give you points with me everytime. I could drink a couple mroe of these and be pretty damn happy."
"This pours a golden yellow with a giant white foamy head, there's alot of carbonation in this beer. The smell has a candy sugar aroma along with some malt sweetness. The taste is sweet with some malt and floral flavors. This is very crisp with some hop bitterness. The m/f is light with all the flavors being well balanced. This is a good beer worth trying again,not the best Belgian, but a good beer."
"Taste was dry and malty, a little mash or hull taste, not very nice, slightly acidic and fruity. Again the taste of honey. I get strong associations of honey and to a lesser extend vanilla, starting to bore me after a couple of sips. This beer is absolutely not bitter, which would have been great in combination with the typical honey taste and dryness of the beer. How much I would like to give a good review, this beer was a little out of balance and too one-dimensional for me."
"Blurry, heavily sedimented straw yellow. Lemongrass, pepper, and straw in the nose. Smooth body is cut off by the peppery spiciness. Delicious lemons and hops for an interesting body, effervescent and sparkling. Slightly bitter. Not too complex but not boring either. Pretty darn drinkable. Above average."
"750 ml cork and caged bottle with a best before date of 5/27/07. pours a hazy golden, slightly amber, yellow. Decent 2 finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Good honey and malt aromas mixed with a bit of earthy yeastyness. Some citrus aromas as well. Nice earthy yeast flavors mixed with honey, citrus and a noticeable hop flavor. Dry, smooth and very easy drinking. Not overly complex, which makes it more enjoyable. A tasty and well made beer."
"12 oz bottle. Hazy yellowish-copper body with active carbonation and a big pillowy white head plus nice tracings. The aroma is distinctly spicy and floral, showing corriander and lemon. Smells like a hoppier Witbier. Nice. The flavors are crisp, spicy, a touch yeasty, with a firm yet moderate bitterness on the finish that increases with intensity mid-glass. Despite the intense carbonation this beer is mostly gentle on the palate, and goes down oh so easy. Hey you know something, this is a damn solid beer."
"Drinkable for sure. A very good tripel. Let this one warm a bit to get the full aroma and complex balanced flavor."
"Poured a slightly hazy light golden color with a thick white head. Smells of mild spices with a lemon/citrus background. Taste is sweet with a light malty undertone that showcases the citrus and spices which mixes well through the carbonation. Alcohol is completely undetectable. Very lively on the tongue with a clean medium mouthfeel. This has great drinkability, and was a great start to an entire new style of beer to me."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy yellow ale with a super huge white foamy head with great retention. Aroma of sweet fruit with some very perfumy hops and a distinctive yeast presence. Taste is a nice mix of sweet malt with a floral and sweet qualities to it, subtle spices presence with some interesting yeast signature with a somewhat dry finish. Body is a bit lighter then expected. Very nice example of the style."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a massive bright white head that doesnt leave that much lacing. Smells of citrus, cloves and other fruit I cant put my finger on. A very nice taste that consists of bubblegum, citrus with an ever so slight hoppy aftertaste. Very drinkable beer, no problem drinking 750ml in one sitting. All in all a very, very enjoyable beer from the pop of the cork to the last sip from my goblet."
"Pours a golden amber with a medium to thick head. Smells strong of hops, lemon, fruit in general actually and seemed very dusty. I don't know if that was just my bottle but I detected it. Taste is that of most decent pale ales I have had with some citrusy notes, nothing particularly special. Rather sour aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is rather carbonated and acidic...not very pleasent. As decribed by my girlfriend, ""tastes like I kinda acid refluxed in my mouth."""
"A very strange Tripel. Not your run of the mill, beefy-like hefe. Complexingly uneven."
"Pours a translucent golden yellow under a fluffy white head with big chunks of brown yeast that are circulated like a fountain from the carbonation in my giant goblet. Nose is fragrant tropical fruit, Belgian yeast, and fruity hops. Taste is more tropical fruit, candi sugar, dry earthy yeast, and aromatic hops. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Lots of elements of a belgian strong pale ale with some tripel sweetness. Alcohol is well-hidden for 7.5%. A tasty little tripel overall."
"Lots of action in the mouth, active and aggressive but not unpleasant or overpowering. Goes down smoothly. Too quickly if you're not careful. Easy drinkability, not heavy, totally refreshing, crisp, full of body and personality. It may not be the most unique of the tripels, but still a high-quality beer."
"Drinkability - great drinkability for a 7.5 abv brew. Flavorful and refrreshing, it's what good beer is all about."
"If I wanted a tripel to represent my fridge I would go with this one."
"Medium mouth that has a lot of carbonation. Not bad overall, but nothing exciting either. Pretty easy to find and I could see myself enjoying this with pork medallions sauteed with green apples and mushrooms in a garlic demi-glace."
"The beer poured a light gold with a white head. It was also resplendent with heavy sediment giving it a wonderful cloudieness. The aroma was of sharp malt. The taste was of malt with a little yeast, plenty of sweet fruit, and really no hops to speak of. The feel was heavy and creamy. It had a surprisingly dry finish with an alcohol burn. A very enjoyable tripel, and one I will have to sample again."
"Pours a hazy pale gold that turns very cloudy after the yeast pour. Soap bubble head quickly fills the glass, and slowly settles to a very dense; creamy head that never quite vanishes. Tiny, streaming carbonation does not disturb abundant patches of stubborn lace left behind. Belgian phenolics and fruit aromas, like peach and citrus. Pilsener malt and faint noble hops become apperent near the bottom of the glass. The first taste is sweet, probably from candi sugar and pale malt. Becomes fruity, but never turns to ester. The aftertaste has a german hop spice, but the gentle yet tart yeast flavor stands out the most. The phenols compensate for the lack of hop bitterness and the result is a balanced mouthfeel that finishes with only a whisper of yeast. The crisp carbonation and soft body make it very easy to drink a few; which sucks because its expensive; but you get what you pay for."
"Taste: a somewhat fruity taste, but still a bit drier that I would have thought. A slight hoppiness. Feels very good in the mouth, with just a slight smoothness."
"An interesting brew, simple yet still flavorful."
"This beer has a well-rounded flavor and good balance between the complex flavors and sweetness. However, the level of carbonation is a bit too high for me and seems to overwhelm the flavor. Apart from the carbonation, this is a farily subdued yet well balanced and complex tripel."
"Very palatable taste. Yeast up front, with a malty sweetness to it. Almost like a candied sugar distinction to it. Still, at the very end, there's a little skunkiness to it. I don't know if it's been in the freezer of my distributor for too long, but it's a bit skunky. Oh well. I can tell it's a decent tasting beer otherwise, but if you want a beer like this that is less of a sulfruic mess, go with Fin Du Monde."
"The high 7.5 ABV is also well represented as an after thought and in the following after taste."
"Notes: All in all a very good beer, def not my first choice for the style but good every now and then. I'd definitely pick this as a good tripel to introduce a shitty beer drinker to better beer as it's not overpowering in any sense but still good and flavorful."
"Overall- A very good Abbey. Delicious. This would nice to drink all day during a baseball game or bbq!!"
"Pours a lively, cloudy pale yellow with a nice frothy white head that retains well enough. Aroma is very spicey (corriander, clove, anise, white pepper), phenolic, bready, candy sugar-like, fruity (orange and lemon) and some alcohol notes. The taste begins with some spiced notes of corriander, clove and white pepper, followed by a sweet candy sugar flavor, a fruity malt/yeast character of orange and citrus rind, and some slightly bitter floral hop notes and a lightly noticeable alcohol character. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, drinkability is good. Overally an enjoyable tripel."
"Presented as a 750ml bottle. The release of the cork was somewhat dissapointing with only a slight pop present. Poured a delightful golden color with attractive white puffy head. The smell was enjoyable with a nice fruity maltiness. Taste was incredible with a combination of malt, spices, fruit, and citrus. Finished very smooth with a complex maltiness. Very drinkable. Paired it with barbequed shrimp and scallops."
"Drinks very easily, but also very tame and shallow for an abbey-style tripel."
"Highly recommended in my book."
"After the Corsendonk Brown, I expected a tremendous beer out of this one, especially since I am a huge Trippel fan. The straw to yellow color is on target. Nice carbonation, white head and incredible retention and lacing. Aroms are subdued, but nice. Fresh fruits, honey, chardonay like, mildly tart, and perfumy alcohol woven around peppery spices. The taste was a slight let down. It becomes a little too chardonay like. Less malty sweetness than I expected and a lower body too. All of the tartness of lemons, grapefruit, white grapes, and pears that I like, but lacks a bit of round sweetness going into the body. Remains alcoholic and perhaps a little phenolic. I think in their attempt for greater alcohol, they lost body and smoothness. Still, a world class beer."
"This is most decidedly a good beer."
"Opinion: I think that this is an excellent beer, and I would not ""kick it out of the fridge"". I think that the aroma was more intriguing than the flavor, but I am spoiled with Belgian Tripels. I would put this beer somewhere in my top 10 favorite Tripels, but I definitely like some others more."
"Clear golden colour with a huge, rocky white head that quickly dissipates to a thin lace. Lemon and spice in the aroma, quite clean. Same in the flavour, but a bit of malty sweetness starts things off. A bit peppery as well. Clean, short finish with some sweetness. Huge, crisp carbonation with a lightish body. Slightly slick texture but mouthfeel is dominated by the carbonation. Easy to drink given the abv, nice balance."
"Sweet, fruity, with elements of peach or nectarine. The hops were subtle but prevalent. I wouldn't say this was ""balanced"" like a German lager might be, but this isn't a German lager. It's anything but! It reminded me of the kind of beer you would take with dessert and drink the night away. With all that carbonation, it felt awesome in the mouth. I could drink this beer all night, although it was a bit on the filling side compared to its light color and mouthfeel. Probably all the bubbles."
"I'd almost be tempted to call this a Tripel Lite. Perhaps to introduce someone to the style this would work, but I long for more potency."
"Decent."
"Pours into the Corsendonk ""zalig genieten"" glass with explosive carbonation in a yellowish gold body, leading to a thunderously large marshmallow white head. Aromas fight through the cumulus head to reveal candied bananas, pineapple, candy sugar, yeast, a touch of pepper. Not bad. Grainy fruit flavors, topped with sticky candy sugar. Alcohol noticeable up front, along with some peppery, mildly astringent bitterness. Sweetness stays into the finish, with a buttressing banana-ish bitterness. Medium-full bodied with a light syrupy quality. Not a bad tripel, but there are plenty better."
"This beer popped loudly and poured a clear golden with a billowy white head that sizzled down to a thin layer not long after the pour. The smell is good but is lacking a little bit. It smells slightly fruity. The taste is of pale malt with a little bit of fruit. There is an alcohol presence with the flavor. It has a light sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is good. Medium to moderate carbonation and a medium body. I think this is a very drinkable beer. I recommend it."
"The mouthfeel possesses a far more fizzy and carbonated texture than the appearance of this tripel initially belies. In fact I've had the impression this whole time that I've been drinking a full-bodied lager in the back of my mind. Perhaps I didn't choose a more exemplar bottle of this tripel to review, but from what I've sampled this doesn't really thrill me too much, pretty plain overall. A very easy-drinking tripel, I'll give it that, but I don't feel very enticed to make an extra trip for more, or to refill my glass with it any time soon."
"Finally a local wine importer is distributing some new Belgians in Alberta; Corsendonk among them. The bottle is quite a simple affair, with a small white decal of Mary. Corsendonk's brewery label is definitely one of the more religious-looking. An apple and mango aroma drifts up after the cap is popped. The Agnus pours with a mammoth head verging on uncontrollable, especially in the Corsendonk beer glass. Big, pillowy and bright white, the head slowly falls to a drinkable level, leaving clingy lacing in rings and big dense pockets, all the while churning melodiously. The liquid itself is a cloudy champagne colour, bright golden. The first sniff gives an exceptional tripel aroma, full of spicy, brandy alcohol, white sugar, and a strong floral soapiness. Fresh wet grass above the rim, and down closer I get the maltiness along with a rich honey smell, which was appetising and a little different for a tripel. The aroma is quite dusty, warm and sweet. Some great fruitiness from the yeast, adding pear peel, green apple, mango, dried apricot and banana cake. There is a great deal of complexity to be had in the smell, and I found new aromas with each sniff. Much better than a lot of tripels out there. The taste does not fully fulfil the aroma, but is still first rate. The beer is quite syrupy sweet and sugary, but not cloying. Malt is given priority, and the phenols are masked very well. Some tinny metallic tastes throw in an off flavour occasionally. Surprising also is the spicy hops this has in the mouth, even up front on the tongue, almost like Saaz or Hallertauer. I tasted more hopping than usual for the style. The taste begins malty, gristy and with the flowery hops. In the middle all the fruit comes out, a little syrupy but filled with apricot and apple. The finish is dry with a little alcohol bite, and decently bitter from the hops. The smell and taste both have dusty, powdery characteristics. The sediment, tasted separately, is milky and even more dusty. I cannot complain about any element of the taste, save the fact that the aroma lead me to believe it would be a little better. This is medium bodied and low in carbonation, allowing for easy sipping. After a glass the stomach warms comfortably and you can ""chew the cud"" as it were of this beer. My verdict: a great example of the style, worthy of the name tripel, and very tasty, with enough complexity to satisfy most palates. I am glad I tried it. Thanks Corsendonk."
"cheers!"
"My main detraction from belgian ales is their phenolic character, and this pleasantly had none. Except for the price this would be an excellent session beer and would be of great use in advocacy of good beer to the unknowing. It is a nice blend of light and flavorful that any beer drinker will be able to appreciate, macrodrinker or no."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Clear golden body. Bigass thick crop of ivory white head. Retention is outstanding. Carbonation looks vigorous. Nose is bready and sweet. A little spicy (peppery). And yeasty. Decent enough. Flavors are subtle, bordering on bland. Stale yeast and delicat sweet malts. Light pepper. A little wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is very prickly with carbonation. Body is light-medium. Just a little charged and gaseous in the mouth, but not overboard. Average Tripel and not one I'll seek out again."
"The taste has a bitter start followed by a flush of fruit and earthy malt. There is a hint of chocolate way back. The finish is dry with an earthy cocoa aftertaste. Pretty delicious with a pleasant fizzy mouthfeel."
"Zesty, if I had to keep it to one word."
"Fruity nose and very sweet yet very crisp to the taste. Not a session beer but a lovely beverage none the less."
"Carbonation seams to pick up as the beer warms. A little to bubbly for my taste, but then again we're talking about almost a champagne. This is definitely a beer for the faint(er) of heart."
"Drinkable; in no way a bad beer but don't have to high expectations about it."
"Overall, a drinkable beer, but I think it would fare better if it were a bit stronger."
"Yeasty smell, a nice yeasty head for a few minutes after the pour. Creamy smooth in the drink but with metallic in the finish and real metal and dry aftertaste. Coriander and a spot of more potent spice, though not complex. Medium mouthfeel. Another bottle two years later, light yelow with much head. All yeast story."
"This is a 7.5% belgian tripel? This is a VERY drinkable...could this be a great belgian session beer?"
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer isn't perfect, but it's still incredibly enjoyable. Not as good as the Urthel Tripel I just had, but I really enjoyed this. It gets more and more pleasing as I go down the glass. Deifnitly give this one a try if you see it."
"A solid Tripel by all accounts, but there are many other Tripels on the market that I prefer. I appreciate Tripels that can provide some more complexity."
"The color of the beer is a nice straw color with a white head. The aroma is quite spicy for a tripel. There aroma also has hints of banana. The flavor is fairly complex with spicy hops, a bit of sweetness, and tart apple that is emphasized by the carbonation. The carbonation seems to be a bit excessive for this beer but not too excessive to ruin the beer. Overall, a bit of a break from the standard tripel style but still very good."
"Taste: A light malty sweetness upfront, combined with something that I had trouble putting my finger on. It could have been anything from currants to dates. This sustained until the finish, when the bitter, herbal hops kicked in. This lasted well into the aftertaste where it was joined by light sweet apples. There was a green grass component in the aftertaste as well."
"With just being my 3rd Tripple I believe I should have more to look forward to from this style."
" At 7.5% this beer is not quite a session, but in it's own family of tripels it could be considered one."
"Notes: Not much taste to speak of. I think that this is what can make this beer appealing. You won't blow your socks off. This is a great Belgian to warm up with. I disagree with the price, it is too high for what you get."
"According to the cork, lot # 136287. Quite a pain to get the cork out! Pours a somewhat bland yellow color, but has an excellent meaty white head. Smell is quite excellent, smells is of coriander and light fruit, but just appetizing throughout. Taste is quite good, high in alcohol flavor but also wooden and oak-like flavors, spicy without hops, perhaps coriander and other flavors are dominant. Tasty and worth the price, I recommend it!"
"Pours a pale yellow orange colour, with slight haze, fluffy white head and good lacing. Heavy on the carbonation. Aroma of peach, yeast, cirtrus. Taste was very mellow. Soft flavours of peach and mango. Finishes dry and is quite crisp. Mouthfeel is smooth and fluffy. Easy to drink. A very simple ale, and it hits the spot."
"Excellent complexity, a very drinkable triple."
"From a 330ml bottle, pour a pale yellow. Big foamy head. Lots of lacing. the nose is fresh with yeast, bread and light citrusy notes. Taste wise, again with the yeasty quality. pinch of banana but very subtle. some bitterness off the finish. great staying power. flavors linger nicely. crisp and dry mouthfeel. champagne like. pleasant liveliness in the mouthfeel. i loved it. not a huge flavor profile but solid in it's overall balance. a sometimes overlooked and under-rated beer."
"330ml bottle from a gift pack poured into the official Corsendonk tulip glass....revealed a hazy pale gold ale with a phenomenal fluffy white cap that piled out of the glass like meringue...very active in the glass with thousands of tiny champane like bubbles streaming up the glass sides. Nose is understated but distinct...fruit (Pears?) spice and a wisp of must from yeasts. Front side is peppery from the effervescence but the spice overpowers it and then comes some fruit/malt tastes (like a pear cider)..finish is deceptive...dry with the alcohol fully cloaked...light fruit after taste mingles with the drying....this is a nice pale abby...Me like-a varra much!"
"from the bottle. poured a hazy golden with off white head. aroma citrus, yeasty, fruity. floral, hops.flavor a strange citrus like grapfruit orange and lime mixed together with a touch of apple, not to bad a nice bitterness as it warmed the flavor just got better"
"This lovely beer pours a sweet goldish brown with a nice giant head. The smell is of that distinct belgian barnyard smell. The taste is kind of thin for a tripple but it is very good however for the price I would buy soething else. I also don't know how long this has been sitting on the shelf in my week beer educated town/state. The mouthfeel is a nice rounded fruity one that makes this beer very enjoyable."
"A good tripel. Not my favorite but a good version nonetheless. Pretty drinkable since the abv% is rather low for the style and well hidden."
"This beer comes across fresh and crisp. Mells good, feels good, tatses good. Enjoyable. Recommended to try."
"Nice straw yellow colr with a small head, bt great lacing. Smell is light and grassy..very light citrus undertone. Taste is subdued, but pleasant...light grassy element and a light hop finish. Mouthfell is somewhat light, considering the abv....but very nice. Drinkability likewise is good for the abv."
"Pours a golden yellowy-orange color with a frothy eggshell white head. Pleasant aromas of pale malts and candi sugars on top of a blood orange/ruby red, citrusy aroma. Dusty and musty hop and yeast character, too. The initial malt sweetness is quickly cut with a estery fruitiness, and then the clovey, ginger phenols take form in the finish leaving it dry and palatable. Carbonation is decent. It is very nice and drinkable. I'm convinced it is better out of the bottle than on-draft."
"This is a good Tripel, certainly drinkable. But my money stays on Chimay's representation of the style, and the cost of both means I won't be back to Corsendonk for some time. If the Chimay runs out I know where to go."
"Beautiful beer. I wouldn't kick it out of bed. I caught myself licking my lips for leftovers. Would be yummy with Moghul Indian foods."
"Quite Carbonated with large bubbles rising quickly through my glass. The beer is a gold color with a light haze and a head that is made up of large white bubbles, which though thick to begin with quickly disappears. The aroma is sharp, a bit spicy and actually reminiscent of a Sauvignon Blanc in both its fruitiness and spiciness. This beer effervesces on my tongue, it is sharp up front yet has a grape-like sweetness in the finish. While there is a certain sharpness and a hint of spiciness (ginger, pepper, and a hint of clove) this beer is fairly clean, and not all that complex. Certainly tasty, but it could use so much more."
"Beer is good. Happy Abbey Pale Ale beering."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a nice beer, and if it weren't so expensive I would like to drink more than one at a time."
"Good drinkability for this well balanced, Tripel. Yeast presence could have been more prominent, but this is a fine sipper with a nice, tropical fruit dominance that is enhanced by the floral hoppiness."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a dry spicey scent that boasts of pale malts and a fruity yeast finish. The taste is decent. It has a very dry pale malt flavor with a fruity yeast finish. It has a slight corriander taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent abbey pale ale. It has good aroma and decent flavor; an above average drinker."
"Pours golden-greenish with a copious head that lingered for a fair amount of time. Very frothy and composed. Fairly complex smell with a lot of smokiness, alcohol, and a myriad of noncitrus fruits. Taste matched the smell but was less invasive. Not a well balanced ale, a bit too much smoky flavor which caused this very acrid taste. It made me cringe a little every time I drank. But, if you like smoky then it's great. Mouthfeel was very good. It needed more balance between flavors to really enjoy the taste."
"this is interesting to compare with the corsendonk brown. they have some similar core elements, but go in completely different directions. I can't wait to try the christmas ale."
"I just wish I knew why mine was chunky."
"Poured a transparent golden color with a white foamy head that rose above the glass, but didn't drop over the edge. Smell is yeasty, earth, spicy, hint of fruit, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is spicy with white pepper notes that follow a eerily empty opening. There just a brief hesitation before the flavors hit, and then it all overwhelms the palate. Hint of pale malt, fresh fruit, bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and soothing, very prickly from the carbonation. Mmmm, this was a great follow-up to the Corsendonk brown."
"12 ounce bottle, pleanty of sediment in bottle, but pours light pale and just a little cloudy. White head, tiny bubbles when it settles and leaves intricate lacing. Strong nose of melon, rubber bands and coriander. Soft on the tongue, light to medium bodied. Spicy palate, yeast, spice, melons, bubblegum. Hops very late. Crisp finish. Nice stuff, alot going on. 7.5 % well in the background. A standard and widely available Belgian, worth a try if you like the style."
"A nice example of the Belgian abbey ale style. Although the alcohol is pretty strong, 7.5% abv, it was not noticeable in either smell or taste."
"Overall Impression: Definitely one of the better ""mass-produced"" abbey ales. It is actually botte conditioned (as opposed to Grimbergen or Leffe). A bit too gassy though. Not much complexity. Corsendonk Pater is definitely better."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle. Cork came out easy but with a huge POP. I am fortunate to have a Corsendonk glass to sample this beer from. Pours out much lighter in color than I expected. It's about the same yellow as most lagers. Two inch bright white head and very effervesant. The smell is sweet, banana and yeast. Taste is similar but with more spice. Nice alcohol warming at the end. Not extremely complex but very easy drinking. Lighter than most tripels that I have had."
"Not a bad drink, but certainly others from it's class I would chose over this one next time."
"Nice looking beer: a medium-sized, white, fine head that leaves soapy lacing; a dark gold, clear, slightly orangey body. Sugar and spice and citrus in the nose. This is what clouds smell like in heaven, I think. A malty, fruity, peppery front. Thick, buttery, foamy, smooth, silky, malt middle. Dry, spicy, yeasty finish that lets a little too much alcohol through when cool. I like this beer. It's a nice, sweet, fruity, buttery pale Belgian."
"I liked the way this version of an abbey tripel tasted and smelled. It was a nice brew to sit back and relax with. I wouldn't mind having this again sometime soon."
"Well, maybe not as revolutionary as its brother the Brown Ale, but still a solid tripel and one I'd likely have again."
"This is the first Abbey Tripel I've tried and I must say I really love this stuff. Poured out a light orange/golden color. Smell is a little hoppy and some hints of citrus in it. Taste is quite soft on the palate. You can taste that citrus but also some notes of alcohol in it that kinda drives down to the aftertaste. But it's not too bad, it's quite tolerable. I like it, it's good."
"Gold in color with a decent head that produced some light lacing. The aroma was mild - sweetness and spice detected. The flavor was sweet and was nicely balanced with spice and decent bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth with a dry finish. The spices and malt rode the tongue well after swallowing. The is a medium bodied beer with nice carbonation levels. Not the best abbey triple, but a drinkable version."
"Comments  I have found that my preferences with this particular style stray a little bit from the norm. Where as this one is running a 3.8 or so average I thought it was much better."
"very cloudy with a good amount of sediment. There was not much of a head, but decent lacing. Hints of honey and malt in the aroma. There is a burnt sugar taste that turns dry in the aftertaste. This beer is lacking a few things. There is very little carbonation and the taste isn't well balanced. I just had a Karmeliet Tripel last night and this one is definately not in the same league, but it is not a terrible brew."
"Drinkability is good, but this is a different brew."
" A Belgian Classic and a great pairing with rich or spicey foods."
"12 oz capped bottle best before 11/09/05 , pours hazy pale yellow color with a huge foamy white head that sticks to the glass. Banana-clove aroma, honey sweet fruity flavor. It has medium body with a crisp mouthfeel, lively carbonation, finishes very dry and spicy."
"Bright yellowish orange with a small degree of hazing and a big, fluffy white head. Melon, lemon, spicy floral aroma. Citrus jello mold and banana bread. Intense. Very restrained, easy-drinking triple -- fruit flavors are subtle and well-integrated into a sweet, simplistic estery base. Finish cleans up nicely, drops off without being harsh or bitter. Nothing too remarkable -- but maybe that's what makes this so good."
"Pours a mildy cloudy yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma is banana-like with other sweet fruits faint in the mix. The taste is not as powerful as some Tripel and Tripel style beers I have had. It seems to vacillate between golden ale and tripel a bit. It goes down easy and smooth but just not as much going on as I woudl have hoped for."
"This is one beer I have had the pleasure of sampling from a three liter bottle, what an awesome esperience it was delicious. Here we are on tap. Appearance: Golden amber with a very nice frothing white head, fine Belgian lacing forms looks excellent. Aroma: Candied sugar sweetness, belgian pale malts, spicy doses of hops in the air. Taste: Slightly clovey, sweetness comes in the form of an apple cider like alcohol infused soft tone lacking the alcoholic edge it once had this beer has been knocked down to 6.5%. Mouthfeel: Nice even effervescent carbonation lacks a fuller mouthfeel but still is medium bodied, not bad at all. Drinkability: Incredible a session brew if you can afford it at 7 bucks a pop, I will side with an American micro but this is very tasty and incredibly drinkable."
"Overall a very nice drinking tripel with less character than it's more classic cousins."

"Not a bad brew that tends to be sold at just about every store I walk into. Makes for a good choice when Im in the mood for a Belgian and cant seem to find one of the better, less readily available, tripels."
"Lacking in depth for a tripel. A bit on the dry-side, with some pear-like fruit flavors and sourish malt with a bit of clove phenols. Lacked the layers of fruityness or spice that I look for in a tripel. Pleasant and drinkable, but not something that I would search out in the future."
"Truly an amazing beer. In my top 20 for sure."
"A lawnmower Tripel perhaps? (And a nice one)"
"This is a good beer but not quite great. It isn't the most complex belgian but it stills tastes really good. It has a light golden color with an enormous head. Very carbonated. The smell is of sour apples. Taste gives me an alcohol precense right away which combines with a citric hop flavor that I'd say resembles peach. There are some malts noticed in the middle but they come and go quickly. This beer finishes nicely with a mild spicy yeast flavor. Simply a quality beer to drink."
"A soft orangish straw color with chill haze. Topped by an average head fed by some active carbonation. Smell dominated by ho-hum grains with just a hint of hops. Given the lackluster smell and the first flavor that hit me (a dusty metallic taste), I suspect the bottle I had was too old. Still, the flavor wasn't bad--just less interesting than other tripels I have had. A fruity (peachy?) flavor that is balanced by crisp hoppiness. A bit warm and dry at the finish. Pleasantly soft mouthfeel and good drinkability round this one out."
"Pours with a five finger, white head that leaves a little lace. Pour this VERY slowly. Cloudy, pale amber color. Faint malt/alcohol nose. Carbonation is heavy. Medium bodied. Starts sweet but yeasty and finishes sweet with a hint of bitterness. Very good but I have had better triples. This is brewed by Du Bocq for Corsendonk."
"The flavors are cotton candy, spring blossoms, honey, semolina, anise, lemon peel, olive, pitch and whole wheat flatbread grilled in butter. It tastes like good grain, mashed and steeped in water...oh, I guess that's what it is! I guess obviousness doesn't earn a penalty. At least it's ""good"" grain. I was hoping for a little more sourness based on what I smelled. Again, lack of ""sour"" might sound good to most people. Have you tasted a ""Margerita"" at a bar or restaurant lately? You'll need more than a ""wedge"" of lime floating in it...but who am I to judge."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and some lacing on the glass. The aroma smells strongly of wheat and spices with some malts in the background. The flavor was very yeasty with some citrus notes. This is a pretty good Belgian wheat."
"I guess that I would have liked this better on a hot summer day. It has almost a champagne-like fizziness that I just didn't like. I wasn't too impressed. I must say, however, that I couldn't detect the 7.5% ABV"
"Light straw color, slightly cloudy, large head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A Belgian Triple style ale. Malty and dry, with a distinctive hop signature. Mouthfeel is full and round. Soft carbonation, champagne-like. Finish is dry and clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty"
"Served in a Cochonne goblet at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Appearance is a light hazy golden amber, with a rather short head, for a belgian beer. I was watching her pour it, and it was very foamy, but the head died down almost immediately. Aroma is definitely malty, with that belgian sweetness. Smells mildly sour, with plenty of fruity goodness and a bit of caramel. Taste is very nice, although not the best belgian I've had by a long shot. Lots of candi sugar, which has an almost saccharine sweetness in this particular beer, faint metallic quality, light clove, fig, and caramel flavors. Nice and complex. Carbonation is mild, with a slightly sour finish. Body is medium to light. This is one of the most ubiquitous belgians in my area, bottle wise. I was meaning to try it when i was first discovering beer, and i wish i had. I've tried so many other belgian abbey style ales that this one just didn't really impress me. Something about it was just a little off. Good, but with a sort of unrefined quality...or something. I can't explain it, but it certainly wasn't as good as some other tripels."
"Served in a goblet. Hazy honey color with a thin white head of tiny bubbles resting on top. Head disapeared right away and left no lacing. Aroma is sweet and doughey, with hints of citrus and sweet candy. Flavor is rich and sweet. Sweet fruit, a bit yeasty. Mouthfeel is a little heavy, carbonation is moderate. A bit rich to be very drinkable."
"Nice lively pour with a good white head filled with medium to large bubbles. It has that light yellow/orange color with yeast floating in it as is typical of the Abbey Pale Ales I have tried. The head died out and left no lacing before I could even take my first sip. It's aroma mild and fruity. The initial taste was a mild and fruity with a strong carbonation on the tip of my tongue. On subsequent tastes I began to feel the carbonation filling up in my stomach. A nice brew, but the Chimays are better. GF said it was nice and gave it a rating of 3.65, better than the coffee brews LOL!"
"Well, my 2 local packies carry Corsendonk as well as the nearest beer bar (and let me tell you, good Belgian beer doesn't exactly grow on trees around here), but for some unknown reason I have resisted it until now. Cheaper than your typical top-shelf Belgian and the compromise is apparent in the brew if you search really hard. Some Euro-lager characteristics (off-flavors, too, such as corn, husk a la Heineken and Stella) which are definitely not welcome in a Belgian tripel. However, there are some very nice things going on here as well. Smoother than many tripels, with more emphasis on the pale malts, some shimmering hoppiness, and not too much yeast or peppery spiciness. That is a good thing, an entry-level Belgian tripel if there ever was such a thing. A tart apple quality is lively and refreshing; some white wine-like woody elements will put the oenephiles at ease. Seasoned beer drinkers will find some things to enjoy here but ultimately the beer is one-dimensional and you will probably be left longing for something to really knock your socks off."
"This is a good beer. It's not my favorite of the Belgians but even a mediore Belgian beer (and this is far better than mediocre) is still damn good."
"This beer pours a cloudy blonde that gives way to a thick and boisterous head that is lively and long lived. The bubbles settle out by getting larger and lumpy. The beer itself is highly carbonated. I bounced the cork all the way across the kitchen. The nose is moderate to weak giving off citrus, fruit and spicy hops. The taste is also a citrus/lemony flavor followed by a mild dose of aggressive hops that are very bitter but in moderation, all the while being supported by fruity malt undertones. The flavors are exceptionally well balanced and this is almost a perfect beer. I would prefer some more nose and more hops in the nose as well. Otherwise it is a perfect flavor and texture."
"Drinkability: Easily quaffed, but not necessarily something that will hook your lips"
"This is an excellent Tripel, but as others have said, it does not bring a lot to the table compared to others as far as flavor and complexity. It is a very easy drinker, very light and palatable. I drank this from a large chalice. It was a golden amber in color, with aromas of hops and spice. Flavors of yeast, mild hops, and citrus fruits are present. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and unoffensive in every way. Very little alcohol presence in both smell and taste. I give this one a high drinkability because I could and would drink many in a row, however there are much better examples of the style."
"Could be the ""middleweight champion"" of triples! Looks good, tastes good, smells good, goes down real easy. Just not quite in the same league (IMHO!) as my absolute favorite Belgian Ales. Pours a cloudy, golden color, nice size head, but not huge like some. Smooth, not overly sweet. Nothing off-putting, and certainly world-class. Head to head, would lose to Duvel, Delirium, Unibroue's similar offerings,etc. but would do just fine any time."
"Taste: The taste was aged. I think of oak. Not to strong but a slight hint is present. Malt and hops are present. Nothing is too over powering. A nice balance of the two. This is a very very nice beer. I could enjoy this, with moderation through the entire evening. This is one I would like to cellar for a few years. A must for all to try!"
"This ale poured a nice clear, golden color with modest white foam that settled to give a thin coat on the surface. The smell was very modest: a faint musty grape and oak aroma. The taste was musty grapes, oak, and some malt, with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp, with low to medium carbonation. The drinkability was good. This ale was not bursting with flavors, but it was very pleasan to drink."
"Well carbonated and creamy, it is a decent tripel, but i found it somewhat bland. There are much better offerings out there....especially at this price."
"Poured a light yellow/golden amber with a nice white tight foam that disapated after a few seconds. The smell was of a floral and citrus aroma. The taste was of a citrus nature and a hint of malts and hops, with a sort of sweet champagne finish. Not to sweet, but not to bitter. This is a pleasant beer. The more you drink, the better tasting it gets!"
"Overall there are better Belgian style triples, but I have also had worse ones. The best part of this ale is the yeast which has a wonderful floral and citrus bouquet. I use the yeast in my homebrew a lot.I remember this ale being much better years ago. I have heard that it is now contract brewed which would explain a lot."
"Sampled a 750 ml bottle. The cork popped out like it was champange, but the beer didn't froth out of the bottle. Poured an amber color with a huge head which lasted quite well. In spite of the way that it poured the carbonation was not excesive. Fruity flavors with a hoppy, almost metallic after taste. A very drinkable beer."
"The pour is a bit murky amber color with an enormous head, frothy in texture, beige in color, and the lace thick clinging sheets. Nose is hop floral, malt, sweet, and quite a pleasure to sniff with the old hooter. Malt sweet at the front with a middling top and the finish pleasantly hopped with a pertinent acidity, dry long lasting somewhat bitter aftertaste, and most certainly a quaffable beer."
"Pours a yellowish golden color with an orange cast. Slightly hazy. The head is firm and creamy, starting at a good inch or so but eventually dropping to a thin 1/16"" covering. Exceptional hold and very nice lace. Streams of tiny rising bubbles add to the appearance.The body is medium/light with a gentle caress on the tongue from the very fine and effervescent carbonation. The aroma offers a soft candyish malt with some light vanilla notes, a mild peppery spiciness, some yeast and a very mild plastic/smoke phenolic. Very soft and inviting! The flavor starts with a sweet and lightly peppery maltiness, reveals more honey-ish and vanilla notes, becomes yeasty with some hoppiness leading to a drying finish with lingering malt and spice. The alcohol is well hidden, but most likely adds to the peppery spiciness. Surprisingly complex and exceptionally drinkable."
"A very poor beer  - save your money and spend it on something worthwhile, like Tic-Tacs."
"I enjoy this but not as a regular selection or session beer. It is a bit, slightly, on the acquired taste side."
"Hazy straw/gold. Sutble estery aroma. Yeasty undertones are present contributing some breadiness in addition to a reserved fruity, white grape flavor. Quite a nice tripel though a bit less complex than most in the style. A session tripel at 7.5% abv  ;-)"
"This brew just didn't impress me.  Poured with almost no head and was very light looking almost clear.  It had more of a smell than aroma IMO sort of skunky. And it didn't remind me of any pale i had ever tried, but the worst thing about the beer was the awful after taste. The first belgian that I have tried that I won't drink again.........CHEERS"
"A striking golden color, pours a quickly disappearing fizzy head. Spicy aroma is pleasantly inviting. Apple and lemon taste add to the increasingly warm alcohol feel. Enjoyable in small volumes."
"Pale golden coloring with a pure white head. In the same way that I can somehow identify Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing without knowing for sure it's him, the aroma and taste of this brew are distinctly Belgian to me, which I could point out even in a blind tasting (don't know quite what it is about Belgians that is so readily identifiable....yeast strain? just not sure)...estery, with a warming alcohol presence. Pretty short, dry finish. Very drinkable for a Tripel."
"Dense, white head with aroma expected of this type of beer. Many fruits are detectable at first, and when drinking the perfect mix of swwet and sour come out when the beer hit the back of your throat. Long, fruity fininsh. Fine example of a lighter tripel."
"299"
"It's surprisingly light for its style, almost akin to the color of some light style lagers.  It's got that unmistakeable Beglian smell.  The flavor is not bad but definitely on the light side for a tripel.  It also seemed a bit thin.  However, it's pretty drinkable.  If you're going to drink a tripel outdoors on a hot summer day, this may be the best choice."
"Golden straw in color.  Citrus/floral nose with rich wheat-like yeasty aroma, somewhat breadlike.  Smooth and drinkable with mellow malt character. Rich mouthfeel helped with tasty hop character.  Very drinkable."
"Hazy golden hue w/ a thick, lace - leaving head.  Sweet citrusy fruit, green apple acetaldehyde, black licorice and pepper in aroma, w/ a tinge of earthy Styrian Goldings hop.  Only a hint of phenol is perceptible.  Sweet, lemony fruit flavors upfont, followed by lightly tart cidery notes.  Quite clean overall flavorwise.  Hop bitterness sufficiently balances residual malt sweetness.  Moderately bodied & refreshing considering the relatively high ABV.  Finishes dry w/ a quickly fading licorice note.  Abbey Pale Ale is tasty, very drinkable and smooth on the palette.  It's not a showstopper, but is highly enjoyable.  A great beer is you're craving a flavorful Belgian, but aren't in the mood for an intense Tripel."
"A very solid little beer, sweetish start, with hints of apple, and a nice soft yeast flavour, not overly complex, but very enjoyable, and easy to find in Belgium, i thik this is a nice one to fall back on, good bitterness on the finish."
"Musty, slight peper/yeast/sweet nose.  pale and bubbly with a white head.  Great looking in the goblet!  Very fresh hop falvor with a sweet malt finish.  Beautiful gold color with consistant carbonation throughout.  A very good beer.  Above average but not the best Belgian Pale I've tasted... just a 1/2 step below, but great tasting beer."
"a bit strong and like they say, it is silky smooth and very tasty. i enjoy the expensive belgian ales in the 750 ml bottles, and even though i am more of a dark beer man, this pale ale does it for me. fine beer must be appreciated no matter what class it is in. recommended to all!!"
"I really thought this one stands out. Pours a bright golden orange color, that almosts glows in the light. Big fizzy head, dominated by floral, spices, and warm inviting smells. Very inviting aroma. Taste was bubbly, but with a nice balance of sweetness. Nice fruity feel and the end, and very very dry. Almost nothing lingering, but still crisp and refreshing. Good looking bottle and glass to match."
"This Ale has a very clean palate, starting with a dry, lightly citric fruitiness and finishing with a distinctive and delicate hop character. Very light and fluffy in texture, it has a big head so be gentle."
"The first Belgian style-Pale Ale from Belgium I have had.Good floral aroma,real yeasty and fruity flavor.High alcohol content but real easy to drink,became stronger as it warmed."
"It's got a nice blonde color and heavy carbonation with a steady stream of bubbles throughout although the head quickly dissipates. The nose is sweet and spicy and it goes into the flavor followed by some fruitiness (peach? citrus?) The spiciness is almost too strong, though."
"Notes: One of the more drinkable, yet tame and less complex imported Tripels. Still flavourful and very deceiving for its potency though not as boisterous or flamboyant as other Tripels can be."
"I decided the other day to try this on tap, being that I have only had it in bottles. What a difference. Fresh and inviting, you could smell the flowery and fruity esters rising out of the glass. Very appealing to look at, light and with a delicate white head. Taste was outstanding, smooth and crisp, with a slight sweetness to balance out the richness of the pale ale. A nicely textured beer to drink all year round."
