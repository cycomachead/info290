"Pours a clear straw with a one finger white, rocky head that disappates quickly.  Aroma is floral, spicy, coriander, and bready.  Taste is much the same, with some sweetness, bread, spice, coriander, and a floral tonge.  Mouthfeel is medium and not overly carbonated.  Overall a nice beer and a style I will enjoy trying more."
"Overall - pretty good but not worth getting again."
"Always like a great trippel, this one went great with some pinwheel filet mignonette, so let's give a whirl on the review side.  Popping the top I get a breads waft of spiced malt.  Pours to a bright light orange with a one finger multi-bubble head.  On the taste this brew has a breads, candy and spice, everything nice.  Flavor is consistent throughout with a trace of bitterness in the finish and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth.  A great food beer and sipper."

"One of my favorites from New Belgium, Trippel is a tripel style Belgian ale that is crisp, light in appearance, and delicious. Brewed with Coriander, this beer is strong and herbal, bringing in palate-refreshing tones of hops balanced with malt and earth. Not too bitter, the content of Trippel's ABV is hidden by slight tones of wheat, spices, and the traditional European ale flavor. Over time, if the beer sits, it is possible to taste a little alcoholic bitterness, but with a true drinking of Trippel, it will pay you back entirely. This beer does not deserve to be out of the bottle for more than a half-hour, and it demands a quick consumption in order to attain its brilliance. This is not one for the new drinker, this beer resides in the halls of the greats because of its personality and vigor. Sharp in taste, and all of the ingredients being present, this beer demands an audience of great import and knowledge, and is likely to be brushed under by novices in terms of flavor, color, and presentation. When you find Trippel, pick up a pack and enjoy your night, cause you'll never want to pass it up again."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams ""Perfect Pint"" glass. Pours a light, clear golden with a 1 finger white head of foam. Lots of carbonation, definitely fresh. Smells of wheat, pine, citrus, bananas, with some slight hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Unfortunately the taste is where this beer went south for me. It literally tastes like liquefied banana nut bread. There was some citrus and hoppiness in there, but the banana taste is just too overpowering for me, and ruins the rest of the flavors that are present."
""
""
""
""
"O: Should be called a banana nut beer."
""
""
"I find that most breweries have no clue how to brew a decent tripel. NB, on the other hand, has figured out exactly how to brew a decent tripel, while not going one inch further. This stuff is totally drinkable but also totally unremarkable."

"Overall: This is a go-to beer for me. You can buy it year round and it works in any season. I have much respect for it, and very little respect for the fools who rate this beer low because it proves they don't know what a good beer is. If you see a low rating for this beer, the person who wrote the review prefers Budweiser and therefore does not enjoy real beer and shouldn't be on beer advocate! Grab it and thank me. Oh, and by the way, this beer has an astounding shelf-life. The six pack I picked up is good until October 21, 2015! Thank you New Belgium, and keep up the good work."
""
""
""
""
"Just not my thing at all. Did not do it for me. Much better out there. I love just about everything else NB makes but this doesn't cut it."
""
""
"Pours too clear for a triple - red lights go off / no real head or lacing worth noting / funk smell - farmhouse maybe / no such luck on taste - more like a third than a triple - big disappointment - way too metallic / decent carbonation but who cares at this point / being a BIG Belgian Abby Triple fan I'd say this is almost laughable & would turn folks off to the thought of a triple - bummer dude"
"BTW: I F'ing LOVE a quality Belgian Trippel."
""
""
"How this has a better rating than Left Hands St. Vrain is beyond me.  Not bad but it doesnt have the smell, alcohol content or taste of higher quality Tripels."
""
""
"This is an interesting Trippel"
""
""
""
""
"Freaking awesome brew. Totally surprised by everything about this beer."
""
"Good beer. Certainly more complex as it warms."
"Overall: Interesting beer. Quite drinkable. However, there are much better trippels on the market."
""
"A sweet Belgian-style ale that unfortunately can't hold a candle to the ones back in Europe, not to mention tripels in particular. Too syrupy sweet, overimposed spiciness. I might be too harsh, it's decent, but i expected something.. smarter."
""
"This tasted in between a saison and a tripel. The saison taste is not my favorite (nor is the trippel for that matter), so in terms of my personal taste preferences, this isn't a beer I would often drink. But it seems like a well-made beer, which would be greatly enjoyed by those who love the particular styles involved."
""
""
"Overall, a decent trippel, but not quite as good as a true Belgian."
"Never been a big fan of Trippels but I found this easy to drink and lacking that awful clove."
"Light brew with very thin head, lots of carbonation bubbles rising. Not much odor, really need to stick your nose in to get that ""trippel"" odor. Slight floral taste mixed with belgan wheat , alcohol flavor bites you at the end and then fades into some weird aftertaste. I'm not overly impressed"
""
""
"If you can't be in Belgium, this will work pretty well to fill in that gap."
""
""
"This is a great, accessible tripel, especially if you've never tried a Belgian tripel. It's one of my go-to beers, especially in the summer. Great balance of hop bitterness and Belgian yeast flavor. Nice spiciness from the coriander."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with thick rocky offwhite colored head, sheet of thin lace halfway down the glass. Smell: grape, apricot and floral notes, pale malt sweetness and lots of coriander. Taste: sugary malt character, mildly fruity... pear/apple/grape juice blend, again coriander overload, lightly spicy hopping, some peach skin in the finish. Along with spiced sugar cookie this is the lasting impression. Doesn't have the depth of flavor of some others and I could do with a lot less coriander, but this is pretty nice at this abv and price."
""
"It fills the mouth but isn't so heavy that it's hard to finish. It takes both my favorite sides I like of a lighter or heavier beer. I also enjoy the sweet herbal/citrus taste. At the end and like the sour aftertaste."

"This is one of my go-to beers here at the house. Nice fruity aroma, taste of coriander and spice, beautiful golden color. Great finish. Good with all kinds of food. Highly recommended for those who'd like to go beyond Fat Tire but aren't ready to try the saison offerings from NB."

"Excellent trippel. Usually I feel obligated to stick with the Texas companies, but when I tried New Belgium's trippel I decided I would never go back to Devil's Backbone (my longtime favorite tripel). New Belgium really came up with something good with this ale. It's bright, fairly hoppy (though as always, I could use more hops..lol), has good ABV and sophisticated, non-offensive aftertastes including some flavors I find unique to this brew. Highly recommend this beer. It's well made, has great taste, and packs a punch. No complaints. :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a two finger head that left beautiful lacing on the glass. The aroma was light and I couldn't quite place it but coriander as the label suggested was there along with perhaps a bit of banana of all things. The taste was pleasantly different with banana and coriander prevalence along with hops and a sweet aftertaste. Definitely a fridge item when one craves something light, refreshing and different. Careful though, the taste belies the 7.80ABV rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first trippel, so I'm no expert here. The first taste was very floral and citrusy, then I noticed the alcohol content sink in, and finally the coriander came through. A translucent, golden body sat underneath a small, 1/2 finger white head. Great lacing in my 12 oz glass, and zero floaties in the body. Not an anytime beer, but well worth the experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not sure about the age of my bottle.  The coriander only showed up towards the middle of the beer, and was gone before I got much further.  A good beer I'd have again with no objections, but not one I'd choose over many others, either."

"This is a pretty accurate take on a Belgian tripel style of beer, and I enjoyed it.  If I'm going with a true Belgian from this brewery though, give me an Abbey any day of the week.  Maybe I'm not as big a coriander fan, I don't know, but while I didn't dislike this by any means, I liked Abbey a lot more.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess, though I'll say it's very nice to have this in a six-pack and available all year long, whereas most similar beers are only packaged in bombers and harder to find.  This accessibility is definitely a plus for New Belgium."

"Overall (4.11) : I am not upset I purchased a six pack of this. I do not like it *quite* as much as Abbey, due to the strong alcohol astringency. It does not ruin the whole beer, however, and I can overlook that small feat to enjoy a beer that is utterly yummy."

"This is a really great trippel.  Given the low price, it gives you about as much bang for your buck as you can possibly get in bottled craft beer."
""
""
"O: now that I think of it, this tastes very much like Golden Monkey with a touch more depth and hardness in flavor... it's a very enjoyable beer and I could see grabbing a six-pack once or twice a year - if they sold it in my state!... 4.27?"

"Poured a deep clear gold with a nice foamy white head. The head has minor retention but leaves a moderate amount of lacing. The aroma is very reminiscent of banana with just a hint of spice. The taste has the characteristics of a trippel but is somewhat muted by comparison. There isn't a huge amount of fruity esters or spice. They're there, but not prominent. The body has a nice weight on the palate, not too heavy or too watery. This is a good beer, but the market appears to have passed it by."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - good balanced trippel all around, alcohol is well masking, balanced fruitiness driven by the coriander"

"I am not going to go into the details of appearance, aroma etc etc for this beer. It has had to be had to experience it. It is the Pliny the Elder of Trippels, of all beers in my book."

"O: New Belgium has always done pretty well with the belgian styles and this beer is no exception. this beer has great flavors and solid balance"
"Coriander and spices in the smell and taste. Good color. Clear and perfect golden clear. Not much of a fan of trippels yet. Reminds me again of ciders or champagne , dry after taste.No alcohol taste what so ever, which is good. almost has a sticky mouth feel. after a couple sips now I get an alcohol warming sensation. Nothing really Popping out for me though. This beer would be good at a campfire or fireside , sharing it with somebody, maybe your dog or who ever."

"I am not a Belgian fan....but this is a solid beer and would recommend it. The beer poured a clear orange with thin white head that is leaving a lace. The scent carries typical Belgian flare with coriander spice. The taste is also typical of most Belgians but this is very well balanced with decent spice. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall the beer is solid for any Belgian fan."

"Slightly excessive pilsener grain flavor, it dominates both the nose and first sips of this beer. Nose is even slightly skunky, but in the end opens up. It didn't occur to me to use an aerator during the pour, but that may have helped. Stay with this one, it opens up. The malty sweetness prevails in the end. Even close to room temperature, this beer is a drinker. A gentle, complex, balanced beer. Beer was poured in to a Belgian-style beer glass."
""
""
""
""
"poured into a pint glass good.. appears to be natural carbonation, straw color with the malt- coriander nose, hops are a little subdued i would put this in same as Palm ,Duvel category , quite good and will have another. Reminds me of the Monksbrau we have had tripel yes... looks like they put some thought into this one ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Trippel tastes just like a Duvel. It has a nice golden color. Medium head. High carbonation. Smells a little like nuts and bread and a little floral. It tastes hoppy, some spicy with an orange like flavor. Like the Duvel it is a beer made for the masses. No explosion of Belgian flavors or anything to say “wow” about."
"One of the best Tripels out there."

"Overall Trippel isn't great as a a Tripel, but it is fairly drinkable, and the taste isn't bad at all. On the other hand the aroma, mouthfeel, and color are somewhat lacking. Splitting the decision is the alcohol content, which is listed at 7.8%, but is masked quite well. I give it a solid B-."
"This is my first Trippel and I am impressed. The beer poured nicely with 3/4"" long lasting head. It leaves very nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is just wonderful, like sweet cloves. The taste is much like the smell, it starts out sweet with a touch of banana then finishes with a mild spiciness. It is nice to find a beer with a mild sweetness, but not too heavy of a body. I would call this a medium bodied brew. I really enjoyed this one and will definitely be buying some more."
"Lacks the light character and is far more bitter than most examples of the style. Not as complex as most. I like the pear character. The esters are nice, just somewhat one-note. More bitter than I prefer."

"Overall / Drinkability: Very tasty. Not much in the aroma department, but it more than makes up for this in flavor and drinkability. I wish I had another one right now, or at least a bigger bottle. Dangerously drinkable - higher ABV sneaks up on you. Paired well with Indian food (vegetable Rogan Jhosh) and I suspect it would pair well with other food as well. I'll have to revisit this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is thicker and less carbonated than other tripels that I enjoy. Just not enough activity on the tongue. Overall, it's a decent tripel, but not something that blew me away. If I'm in the mood, I may reach back out again, but will probably go for others instead."

"P.S. My bottle, purchased in April 2014, has a different label: Under the New Belgium logo, there are three roosters pictured on the label."

"Trippel pours a clear golden color with a nice long lasting lacing head. There is a a rich and spicy aroma, hints of coriander, lots of alcohol. The taste is very crisp, good noticeable amount of spices, hints of orange, good malt backbone. Nice flavors, a tad bit weak. Overall its not as rich as other trippels but has a very nice crisp fruity flavor."

"Overall - I had this once before and enjoyed, though I didn't rate. Admittedly I am rating this after having it on the same day as La Fin Du Monde, so my rating may be skewed. Will try again this Spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This is a rather nice and refreshing Trippel with good balance to it. But it is also somewhat unmemorable. I would think if your brewery is the New Belgium you would want to take extra care on this style to make it special. Just my .02 however."
""
""
""
" But I'd recommend their Abbey Dubbel if you're looking to find a top notch American Belgian."
""
""

"O - Excellent brew. Looks beautiful, the aromas hit me the second I started pouring and the flavor blew me away. Will be getting more of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lovely golden pour, with a clear, glowing body, and a load of very fine Champagne like bubbles forming a frothy head. The smell was wheaty and yeasty, with bananas and clove being quite noticeable. The aroma of coriander could also be perceived upon deeper breaths. The taste was fruity, and malty, with a touch of hop bitterness. Just a perfect balance of spice added a dryness to the finish. Creamy in the mouth with a tingly sensation due to carbonation. This New Belgium showing some of their best craft. I love it."

"Final thoughts - Yet another NB I can't believe I haven't reviewed yet! Nice abv at 7.8%, good price on a sixer at around $8 and always tastes great and I am not even a huge fan of the style. But, when it's done well, it's done well!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A seemingly American take on the style up front, but those appearances soon drop away, leaving us with an ok in bearing, and not really as complex mimicry of the old-world masters. Agreeable enough, I suppose, given its apparent availability in bottle format around its point of origin - just not up here, tho (yet)."
""
""
"Overall I am always happy with New Belgium beers they are a tad pricey in my area but always worth the price of admission. A great beer!"
""
""
"Pours a light golden color, with a small white head. Smells of sweet honey and coriander. Taste is also honey and coriander. The coriander is quite strong in this, but in a good way. It helps balance the honey sweetness. The beer has a smooth, medium body mouthfeel. Overall I was very impressed with this. One of my favorites from a company that so far has disappointed me. Great job!"
""
""
""
""
"O - not a fan of Belgian ales, but even so this one is pretty drinkable. Be careful sucking it down. *** NOT A SESSION ALE ***"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This Trippel pours with a fine foamy white head and deep golden color. Fine bubbles in the carbonation and the head disappears quickly. Aroma is weak, there is a little wheat(?) or floral hint---maybe. Slight funky yeast aroma but faint. Similar in flavor of a weak hefeweizen but with a little corriander. Thin mouth feel. The over 7% alcohol by volume is hidden well, smooth drinker but nothing exciting or outstanding---I would have to be told this was a Belgian-style Trippel in a blind tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a drinkable beer, very easy to knock back. Unfortunately, there were few markers that I'd identify as memorable. Not an unpleasant experience, but not particularly inspiring. I might order this if I wanted something clean that would stay out of the way of what I'm eating, but it is unlikely to become a go-to beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip. 2/6/14."
"O: Seems to have a lot of the standard flavors you'd expect in a trippel. The coriander and other yeast spiciness are more pronounced than a typical trippel. Lends a certain uniqueness to this beer. The beer drinks easily and comfortably, especially the nice crisp, dry finish after the complexity of flavors that come out in the body."
""
"O- I must admit this is not my favorite type of beer. It has its place but unfortunately not with me. I like beer and I can dig this but I won't seek this brew out. Good not great. With a disclaimer - not my cup of tea."

"Notes: While this is not a world class Tripel it is a solid one. For me it surpasses Fat Tire as far as the New Belgium lineup for my level of interest. I would LOVE to get a hold of their ""Lips of Faith"" and other famous craft beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat standard Belgian yeast spiciness is most of the beer but not in a bad way. The coriander is pretty subtle to me compared to many other Belgians without coriander even added but this might be a good thing. A nice overall interplay between spicy yeast and citrus/fruity notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly pleasant. Wish it was bottle conditioned, but overall a good representation of the style. A light version and great entry-level tripel."
"The body is light, almost medium with a certain depth to it. It doesn't have the range of the master Belgians, but it's only just short. It's lightly crisp, very well carbonated in terms of adding a bite and a flow without overdoing it, and an almost fluffy smoothness into the end, just a little chalkiness to the body from yeast."

"Overall: For $2.99 for 22 ounces, this is a good bargain, although I can't say that this is a particularly interesting beer. As I've said, this is tame and the flavors aren't too bold, but this is a session trippel if there ever was one."
""
""
""
"o: i enjoy this beer but at 7.8% abv you can get into trouble if you're not careful. always find myself wanting another, lol!"
"O: I was pretty impressed with this one- it's a bit more than the sum of its parts, and available at a great price point. Something I could see becoming a semi-regular second bomber to buy when I'm not looking for a six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a great example of a Tripel coming from an American brewery. I really like it. $2.99/bomber is an awesome deal for this brew. Highly recommended. I'm impressed."

"O: Looks and smells better than it tastes, would definitely benefit from less spices. If you don't mind the level of sweetness, could be pretty sessionable. Would recommend to anyone who prefers malts to hops for at least a try. If i wasn't feeling too picky, AKA going to a grocery store for beer, and they happened to have this, I would consider picking it up. Decent beer, nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden body, nice and hazy; thick foam which rests at 2 fingers, some good hanging lacing. Smell is a bit flowery with mixed spices and sharp coriander. Flavor has the spices upfront and then ends in a nice sweetness. Warming feel. Nothing complex but enjoyable nonetheless."

"O: A nice tripel overall but not one of the best available. It hits on most of the flavors and aromas you'd expect from the style but doesn't get them on all on the right level. New Belgium is new to Delaware and I'm looking forward to trying more of what they have to offer. An enjoyable beer but the memories will quickly fade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good American version of a triple, but not great. If offered, I’d happily drink it, but I’m not searching it out. There are way too many other better triples out there to get over this one."
""
""
""
"I have a special weakness for Belgian Style Tripels and the New Belgium version is a great go to option that is always easily available. It pours a gorgeous golden color with a decent head a plenty of carbonation. The aroma is sweet and flowery with a hint of the Belgian yeast. The taste is fantastic and very smooth with the Belgian yeast tones and a sweetness that balance a very smooth mouthfeel. Sometimes I get a mild bitterness on the ending, but not this time. It was smooth and well balanced throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit dry with a sweet finish, but not heavy. Overall, an excellent Trippel and I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is nuanced, complex and subtle. Very balanced and pleasant and provides treats for all the senses. Although it says that it is brewed with coriander, the spice is hop-like and mingles well with other characteristics. Very versatile, will wash the dust down on hot day or go down nicely après ski. I would say best paired with fatty fish, like salmon. A pleasant surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with medium-low carbonation. Swallowing leads to a flash of ethanol felt on the back of the throat, but not on the tongue or in the nostrils. Closes very dry, nearly astringent, with light stickiness remaining on the palate and tongue."

"Overall - Really nice American brewed Belgium tripel. Has great flavor, smooth and easy to drink. Not to sweet, strong or even too warm from the alcohol. Nice beer, worth a drink for sure."
""
"I'd drink this again if available in my neck of the woods at the right price, worth a try for sure and for spice lovers this one might tickle your fancy"

""

"Overall a pretty good tripel, one of the first American craft beers I'd tried and one I would definitely return to on occasion."

"Love New Belgium beers. At first I was leery to try this because coriander usually overpowers the ale flavors but this beer nailed it! Smell is all coriander but the taste is complex and a great drink ability. Yet another great beer from Fort Collins, CO."
""
""
""
"overall: A very good Tripel"
"O - No flaws, some nice aromas and flavors. Very drinkable. However, it's not as complex or interesting as some tripels."
"Overall: Above average but not great, I prefer belgians that are heavier and this one just didn't have a lot of distinguishing features. Don't mind enjoying this one on the back porch though."

"T- Certainly a straightforward and excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the 12 oz bottle bought at-- who cares, you can buy this everywhere. They do a good job of distributing. But I've never seen this on tap, which would be worth watching for. New Belgium makes this the cleanest, most approachable beer in the golden Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really strong. Nice effervescence, and a decent head with plenty of lacing on the back end. Nose is pungent and bready, with hints of savory spice. Tastes like it smells... light, pungent and bready, with plenty of spice and a slight sweet balance. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"O - This is one tasty beer. Nice range of flavors that favor the malt/fruit nature of Tripels while making sure the finish isn't cloying. It's not terribly complex, and there's just a tad too much spiciness in the finish for me to say this is an exceptional example of the style, but it's quite good and definitely recommended, especially as a gateway to Belgium Tripels."
""
""
""

"Pours out a nice light golden color, it’s mildly hazy and is topped off with a nice thick white head that sticks around for a while. It has some nice lacing and plenty of carbonation. The aroma has a mixture of fruits, clove, coriander, peppers and a slight peanut smell too. Light and crispy, this is a medium bodied ale, the spices are nice and not overpowering, the coriander come out in the aftertaste. The malts are strong at first, but as it travels toward the back of your throat, it sweetens up just a little, it is dry overall. Not a bad ale and it goes down smoothly too."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent, but the particular flavor of coriander is just too much. One bottle is enough."
""
""
"O: Another excellently crafted, balance beer from New Belgium. It's on the lighter side of the Tripel style but still packs a lot of fruit, spicy flavor with a nice balance of sweetness that doesn't overwhelm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Chimay chalice. Pours to a medium white head that falls to a thin layer and light lacing (could be the dusty glass, sorry). Aroma is spicy coriander, intense fruit esters from the yeast, and sweet caramel. Flavor is melt-in-your-mouth honey and biscuits, spices, fruits and a balancing spice and bitterness to offset the intense sweetness but not enough to dry out the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, warming and appropriate to style. Overall a very well made beer that is excellent for sipping."

"Mouthfeel was slick and well carbonated. It has a medium dry finish. Alcohol is clearly there but not a turn off. Overall a decent beer but I probably won't buy a six pack. This was included in a Folly 12 pack."

"I've always liked the Fat Tire from this brewery even thought it tastes like dirt. I have also tried a few others and while they were ""OK"" I don't put them in the same league as other $8-$9 six packs that are available. Store had this Trippel on sale so I decided to try it as I really enjoy this style. Wow, was not expecting this, but to me it tastes like Schlitz Malt Liquor or some of the other corn-squeezins with high ABV. I have had dozens of Belgium Trips and this is not a good rendition whatsoever."
""
""
""
""
"If this were a blind test I'm not sure I could differentiate this from some real Belgian tripels. Very nice brew from New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite the unusual Tripel. The head is gone instantly, the fruit and floral is quite light, and there is a very clear alcoholic presence in the aftertaste. However, it's a good drink. The taste is quite good. I may or may not get this again."
""
""
"While I am a fan of New Belgium, we all know that some of the beers can be considered a hit or miss. This falls in the latter category: not bad, but not great; in any case, I’ve had it – no big whoop."
""
""
"Overall: A nice mild american brewed Belgium ale"
"O: A poor man's triple, but one that scratches the itch, especially given the price points of the best of the Belgians."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: a pretty plain trippel, but nothing off and with more going for it than you might expect from a 3.99 dollar bomber, drinks well, alcohol warms the stomach a bit but stays out of the way otherwise"
""
"Full bodied, lightly effervescent, smooth with a nice, mellow, lingering fade to the aftertaste. A solid tripel if not a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I know i am all over the board here, but it is certainly enough to further my curiosity into this style. I don't love it, but it certainly has me interested to step outside my comfort zone of classic American craft styles. I didn't care for the smell, but the look, taste and feel were all very enjoyable. I tend to be a harsh grader compared to most. And it is a reasonably priced beer at 8% abv."
""

"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet. Virtually no head, hint of cloudiness, medium-amber liquid with bubbles fizzing up from the bottom of the glass. You can smell the yeast on this thing from like a foot away, and the closer you get, the more floral it gets. Flavor is really nice: sweet, a little spice, and you get the floral and yeast from the nose. Well-hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice too, with good carbonation, slick, and a light shock to the palette from the alcohol in the background. I won't lie to you, this isn't the first time I've had this beer. It's one of my go-to's for a tripel, and probably an easy favorite for me from New Belgium."

"12 once bottle with a recommended date of October 6 2013. Lighter than most Tripels. But for me the taste really suited what I prefer in an amber ale. While not the high alcohol content of your normal Tripels, it is a great beer that can be sipped and savored. A great value for the price. This may not be my top choice in this category of beer it is darn close as it is not as filling if you plan on drinking a few. I did not grasp anything overpowering in a particular flavor or taste. Just a very smooth drinking beer with a little more bang than you think when you see 7.8%. This is my first six pack and I am sure I will be stocking up real soon. I can give a more detailed review then as I am battling a bad cold. I recommend this one highly."

""
""

"New Belgium Tripple is a good solid triple that is lighter for the style making it quite drinkable. However, it falls short of the “top-shelf” triples. I might add that it is a good value though…"
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable beer, great representation of the style. I feel like it's missing a certain texture, and I feel like the sweetness murders this beers potential for being an all-day drinker, but it has it's charm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"A great offering from New Belgium. Pours a light golden with a smallish head. The aroma carries a nice level of funk. The taste follows the aroma and is quite refreshing."

"Feel: Silky medium body. Finish is average and slightly wet."

"I like trying all types of beers so I decided to buy a 6 pack of this new beligum trippel. It was without a doubt the most distasteful beer I have ever drank, I would rather have milwaukee's best then this. It has a strong taste of coriander and an alcoholic burn in your stomach from the high alcohol content. I was very highly dissapointed in this beer, so much so I made an account because of all the high ratings it has gotten! It has a floral taste like you are drinking flowers with coriander spice in it, all in all I would never recommend this to anyone! I don't pour it into glasses as I feel it destroys some of the carbonation, so I drank it straight from the bottle- regardless I had to go get another six pack after the first bottle. I do not recommend this to anyone, nor can I imagine why it is even produced and sold at local shops. But if you like your stomach burning and drinking flowers, go for it!"
""
""
"this is a flavorful ale with well hidden alcohol. if youre trying to get smashed while drinking good swill, this would be a great choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For what it is its quite good. a easy find, low price, delicious and drinkable beer. Also a refreshing american style tripel. I could drink a few of these in a fairly short sitting, which is great for a beer around 8%. Definitely a beer that is worth a try if you haven't had it before."

"Sneaky beer. A sipper for sure. Had it a football party with some friends. We are home brewers, and very critical. Amazing smell, earthy, gardenlike, like I just watered my lawn in the July morning. Looks like a typical straw colored lager, but with a bit more pool of foam atop the glass with legs of lace. Taste is slow to hit, until it hits the middle of tongue and I'm hit with banana and a rinse of rye bread. The taste lingers forever, and then transforms' to light bitter apple. I do not notice the peppery flavor others notice at all, but I don't mind. Sipped like a fine bourbon is the best way to experience it. Not a session beer, it is so sneaky. One of the best beers I can find in my neck of the woods!"
""
"O - Overall, surprise. I bought this as a palate washer and it was pretty good for a buck fifty a bottle. Good for a trippel, and very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow with lots of yeast with a full pour. A finger of head that reduces down to a film on top of the beer. Some lacing. Smell is spices, more spices and corriander. Taste is sweet - some fruit but again heavy spice that are light to begin with and settle towards the finish with a twang on the tougue."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is oddly an entirely different beast. The yeast is the first thing to hit you, and the yeast alone. The biscuity character of Fat Tire is definitely present as well, and seems to come in a slightly different incarnation with each sip. The dominating fruit of the aroma is only faintly present in the taste, which, while not necessarily bad, is a surprise. Also, the 7.8% ABV is virtually impossible to detect, as this is very light drinking. Carbonation is medium to high and only serves to up the ""refreshing"" level that's already quite high. The finish is a mix of a faint banana/peach hybrid and a buttery yeast note that clings to the palate for a bit. Overall, pretty nice, though still just ""good"""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed its pepperiness. It does linger for a LONG time. I was hoping for an aftertaste that didn't, well, last for beyond two minutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"But the real beauty of this Trippel is in food pairing. I first tried it with Indian dishes, Chicken Tikka Masala (curry tomato cream sauce), Bengan Bharta (curry eggplant) and Palak Paneer (spinach and cheese cube curry), and this beer's flavors absolutely locked in and came alive as well as in perfect balance with the Indian curry flavors. It is truly amazing, most likely because of the coriander, it is one of the main spices in almost all Indian food. Try it sometime, it is a treat for the senses!"
""
"O- Much, much too peppery. Its militant spiciness makes it untenable as a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My initial pour got me about a finger of solid, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity and both Midas and Croesus could be seen licking their lips. Nose was at once sweet, spicy and musty if you have the capacity to reconcile such a concept. There was a honey-like malty sweetness along with some sort of spice, all overlain by the mustiness of the yeast. Whew! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a riot of flavors on the tongue. It started out with a flowery perfuminess, giving way to a slight spice, followed by a yeasty dryness that was not really expected. Finish was quite dry, not to the point of gasping for air, but close. The price-tag ($4.49) is insane for how good this is! Phew! There is a stamp reading ""29Jul12"" but I did not see any lees if it were truly ""bottle-conditioned"". Man, this not only held up really well, but could have even sat a bit longer. Worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Good flavors but the balance isn't there, if they could reign stuff in, the beer could improve greatly."
""
""
"Now, I love Belgian-style ales, so for me to be so thoroughly underwhelmed by this offering speaks volumes. I almost wonder if this bottle has exceeded its shelf life (the date on the bottle is 3 months ago to the day, but I don't know if that's the bottling date or the best-by date). Based on my experience though, one could readily skip this tripel and miss absolutely nothing in the process."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Yum."
"O-For the price, this is a fine drinking tripel and I would consider drinking more because I can get a six pack for the same price as one 750 of Karmeliet. However, the coriander and spice flavors are a bit heavy handed and the resulting beer is slightly herbal and overly husky when compared against the better examples of the style."
"O: overall this is a very good beer that is true to the style with some flair. I have not found a beer I didn't like from New Belgium"
""
"What a great value. It pours a nice clear glass with a beautiful head. It's clean smell and crisp taste make for a super value, I call it a go to beer. I purposely waited on drinking a couple of these before offering a review. There are plenty of Belgian (not Belgian style) beers at or below the level of of this fine Trippel. As far as I know, and I may be wrong, there are no existing Belgian triples at this beer's value/price/flavor. Enjoy it! New Belgium is giving us a good deal and a fine beverage using, I think the finest ingredients possible for a modestly priced beer."
""
""
"O: Not a perfect beer, but a great example of the style from an American brewer. I’d be very happy with a mix-a-six consisting of three of these and three Abbeys. So for what it’s worth, I guess you could now call me a New Belgium fan – even though I’m still no fan of Fat Tire or Ranger…"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- The combo of smell, taste and mouthfeel just doesnt work for me. The correander was to over powering."
""
"Taste/feel: Fantastic. I'm really shocked this beer isn't rated even higher than it is. You get a good dose of banana and clove and all of that, and it's quite sweet ... but it remains balanced through all of that. I get the occasional taste of alcohol in there as well. Just ... holy hell this is a good beer, especially for the price. The feel just tops this whole beer off -- perfect carbonation, and it drinks very smoothly. I want another."
""
""
"Really liked this beer from start to finish. Could feel the alcohol, but it all still worked together."
""
""
"O - Not sure about this Trippel for some reason it comes off strong and pungent (in the wrong ways), and not really pleasant with a strong medicinal alcohol flavor that last throughout and lingers. This one rubs me the wrong way for some reason. Sorry NB. Better luck next time, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a golden tan with billowy foam that quickly dies down. It’s lightly spiced with coriander notes and has a lightly floral flavor with hint of spice. Nicely bodied, its an all-together decent triple but not one that I’d go out of my way to have again."
""
""
""
"New Belgium may not be my favorite brewery, but their beers tend to be well done, balanced, and delicious. A good example of the Belgian style."

""
""
""
""
"	Overall Impression: I really like this beer; it has great flavor-my first thought was, “it keeps finishing!” as I expected the fruit notes to be the end, the hop at the end was surprising but nice; the fruit notes themselves are very interesting, the banana works really well with the sweetness, and the spice provides a good balance to the whole thing so it doesn't become cloying or overly sweet; if I had to pick a favorite part, I think it would be that transition from fruit to hop...gosh that's nice!"

"O: Overall, this is a quality brew, another great blend from New Belgium. Really enjoyed the smell, really came off as bananas to me, I really like bananas and banana bread. This is a great beer for the fall season, its light and crisp with warmth at the end, great for the colder season."
""
"Brilliantly clear, deep golden hue. Excellent head formation, thick, creamy slightly-off white head, good head retention. Moderate Belgian lace. Fresh, appealing, pleasant, nose. Milder than expected. Medium to medium-light body. Lingers nicely. Pleasant hop notes on the palate. Less coriander on the nose and palate than expected. Colloidal cloudiness on the last pour that stays suspended in the beer. Still tastes great. Moderate carbonation. Very tasty ale. The ABV is not evident - it is light and bright, not warm and vinous. Perfectly balanced. Would definitely repurchase."
""
""
"O: Well done -- a solid performance from New Belgium. I tend to favor beers with a lower ABV, but between the flavor and mouthfeel of this brew, I didn't spend much time fretting about the 7.8%. The significant coriander flavor and aftertaste might be a deterrent for some, affecting drinkability, but I found it a well-balanced and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden in color. Carbonation is perfect. Smell is slightly weak and one dimensional. Taste is slightly sweet with a strong coriander flavor that hangs around. Drinkable but don't think I would purchase again. The taste is not something I like. It's not bad, just not for me. The after taste also hangs around."
"A strong taste of sweet/bitter yeast, along with hints of herbs. Not the most refreshing/drinkable beer, but eat sip is a treat; thats the way to drink it. An exceptional feel when it goes down gives this brew a clear difference against traditional brews. Overall, a good beer with more pros then cons"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of my favorite showings from a brewery that I have a few chips on my shoulder against. It is far from an elite tripel, although for a sub $10 sixer, this is far from bad. For lovers of the floral notes, this is one to look for."
""

""
""
"this is the last of the new belgium sampler my buddy sent me, and one of the better ones of the last few i tried."

"4.0 D: Quite tasty. Corriander should be in more tripels."
"Nice Belgian lace on the glass. Beautiful golden color. Fruit and a slight pepper character to the nose. Smooth mouthfeel with a pleasant effervescence - just the right level of carbonation. For a fairly high ABV, the alcohol is balanced with a malty sweetness and fruity esters. Not hard to see why the BJCP lists this as a good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was an above average example of the style, It had most of the things that I look for in the style with an extra amount of bubble gum that I don't normally find in this style. This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth, with enough flavor to hold my attention, one bomber is just enough for me, this may be the most drinkable Tripel I have had to date. What I liked most about this beer was the drinkability and the appearance, the mouthfeel was also noteworthy. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance in the flavor and aroma, I wish the malts stuck out a little more to balance out all that Belgian yeast. I would for sure buy this again when looking for a decent Tripel that won't break the bank, there's not many affordable Tripel's but this is one of them, I can see myself keeping a bottle or two in the fridge, I recommend this to anyone who likes the style. All in all this was a nice Tripel, but it doesn't come close to being one of my favorites, but for what it is and how much it costs, it's a bargain and a good no thrills Tripel. New Belgium did a good job with this beer and I feel like this is the definition of a solid Tripel, good job guys."
""
"Definitely worth a try. A good Trippel in a 12 oz bottle....I will probably have this again."

"O - meh. Below average offering for this style. I will not try this again."

""
"Overall: New Belgium Brewing just started distributing in Michigan, so I have had three of them in the past week. Their Fat Tire was mediocre and their Redtoberfest was alright, so I wasn't expecting too much out of this one. I was delightfully surprised. This is a really good Tripel, and the coriander helps out a lot. I highly recommend this one."

""

""
""
"O: Personally, I don't know if I like the spiciness of this beer or the sticky feeling it leaves in your mouth following drinking it.. but I can see others liking it. It definitely has a complex mouthfeel to it though. Interesting to note is that it leaves no lacing whatsoever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"At any rate, it's a fairly decent representation of the style, just a little two-dimensional in flavor though. Lots of yeast and fruit come through on the nose and in taste, but not much else. Appearance and mouthfeel are average."

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a golden amber, nice carbonation, small white dissipating head and light lacing. Aroma of slightly sour fruit with light malt, Belgian spicing. Flavor is sweet malt and light fruits, with a somewhat tart, light fruit and spice finish. Medium bodied. A dry, moderately pleasant light triple style without much complexity."
""
"O: A good tripel. It gets bonus points for being so easy to find in my area, and for being quite drinkable. All in all, one of NB's better regulars."

"O: B+. not my favorite in the style but not bad and price point is nice."
"A decent enough beer, just a tad bit sweet in the taste for my liking, but still enjoyable."

""
"Overall, a great beer to me, flavors are everything you want in a tripel with a very small hint of coriander."
""
""
""
""
"Mind you, this is not my style. I'm not a Belgian fan. But I had the bartender (the owner's father in law) at Orcutt Brew pour me a small taste first. It was inoffensive, so I had him pour me a pint. It's a crystal clear, light-golden color with a nearly white head. The head attenuates quickly, but sticky lace hangs on the edge off the glass. A lot of banana in the nose with that common Belgian yeast aroma that pierces the olfactory. The beer's mouthfeel is wet and is characterized by a medium body. A pilsnerish start that quickly yields to ripe banana and then tart white grape. There is a bit of that familiar Belgian yeast finish. The thing I find clever about this beer is that everything is mild. Which has caused this non-Belgian drinker to sit and enjoy a pint. Good job New Belgium."
""
""
"This was nice American take on the style, with a smooth drinkability and well balanced flavors that didn’t run over each other despite the coriander addition. I’m always up for a good Tripel and this one really surprised me."
"New Belgium Trippel pours a fairly clear lemon yellow, with a bit more than to fingers of fluffy white foam capping the beer. Head retention and lacing are both solid. The nose has a good bit of pear to it, before light pepper and clove waft through. The coriander adds a nice subtle citrus note to the aroma. The flavor has some pale/stone fruit sweetness leading off, before the phenols come in on the back end. The pepper and clove aren't too intense, with the coriander doing a nice job of helping temper them. I wish the esters were just a little bit more prominent though. The carbonation is nice and active, but the body is just a touch too chewy for me. New Belgium's Trippel is a good take on the style. I was wary of it being spiced, but the brewers displayed a deft hand with the coriander."
"This is one my first craft beers probably the first Belgian I ever had. For me this was one of those beers that really expanded my mind and showed me how creative and flavorful beer could be. It pours very light amber and crystal clear. Immediately you smell those nice esters from the Belgian yeast. Slightly tart and slightly fruity its a big spicy malt body with a very subtle coriander presence. The hops come in at the end and sort of muddle with everything. At 7.8% the alcohol is incredibly well hidden."
""
""
"O - New Belgium Trippel is an exceptionally delicious and well-made triple at a tasty price. The alcohol is kept to a lower level for the style without sacrificing flavor or nuances that are common to the style. New Belgium has one of the finer American-made tripels on their hands here!"
"Pours a clear solar amber with a thick and fluffy, if not persistent, ivory head. Malty aroma has a decided coriander overtone and hints of yeast and apple. Refreshing flavor has firm fruity and malty tones plus a noticeable, though not overpowering, note of coriander, as well as a hint of yeast. Firm, smooth texture has good body and decent fizz."
""
"O- One of the best examples of domestic Tripel. They have been making this for as long as I can remember. Their yeasts show tons of depth and this masks the alcohol perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good drink but a bit on the sweet side for me."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This tends to be a bit the thin bodied side for a trippel but not by much it is rather close to what I expected."
""
""
""
""
"I discovered this beer recently and because of the reviews I read on this site I thought I would try it. Man, am I glad I did. This is now my favorite beer. The only thing I can think of is the Coriander is what makes the difference. I have never tasted a beer that was so delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Not a Trappist but a great choice to get a sixer."
"The beer is hazy and golden yellow hued. An inch and a half of head leaves plenty of lacing behind. The aroma offers coriander, yeast, sweet fruity malts, alcohol. Some nice citrus flavors meld well with spices. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Decent, but not to the level of the classic authentic Belgian notables in the style."
""
"I'm not impressed with New Belgium as a whole and this beer did nothing to dispel my feelings. It's mostly drinkable as anything bad points are not significant, just merely an average beer of its type, if that."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"Overall a mild tasting Tripel with a good balance of flavors..."

"Complex but simple. Has characteristics of both the hoppy and fruity worlds. Reminds me of their other belgian style ale Abbey."
""
"On-tap at the brewery tasting room. New Belgium does a nice job with this American brewed tripel. It pretty much hits right down the style guidelines. The lean malt body gives a touch of dough and cracker, while the hops are mild with a spicy earthiness. The yeast really shines with subtle notes of pear, black pepper, clove, and flowers. Dry enough too, which many American versions are not."
""
""
"Overall - Definitely a different tasting Tripel.. It's got shades of a kolsch or saison. I'm not big on herbal/grassy notes in my beer so this beer might appeal more to others. Still very drinkable and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good Belgian inspired ale. A little too sweet and malty to be a true tripel. Could of used a little more yeasty funk, but what is here tastes good."

"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer pours a grainy golden yellow color with a small 1/2 finger white head, some retention and some lacing. The aroma is light with a sweet malt character, a hint of earthy hops, and a light clover banana, not as detectable as I would have liked. The flavor starts with an earthy hop character upfront together with a mild bitterness, the higher abv and heat is prevelant pretty quickly but isn't much of a distraction as it mellows in the middle as the sweet malt balances everything out. Finishes with a gentle sweetness and mild bitterness on the tongue. Some carbonation and lighter bodied considering the big nature of the beer. Overall, not a bad beer but not exceptional. I will likely not be back any time soon."
"O: A great easy drinking beer that is smooth."
"Overall a decent beer but either the style or the beer just isn't up my alley for another go any time soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely better than average but not something that I will search out if i want a triple given the other amazing belgium triples."
"Poured this Tripel from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a golden color, clear, produced nice white frothy head, lacing was off the charts. The aroma consisted of fruity peach and a slight hint of spicy coriander. Medium in body, this ale was smooth and crisp, light malted grain, taste of floral herbs, fruity peach and some hop bitterness. Not sure if this a ""beginners"" Tripel, but this is an excellent tasting brew! Prost!"

"Hazy banana yellow color with a white head. Sweet aroma, a mix of fruity esters / spice from the yeast and sugary bread from the malt, no real hops to speak of. Sweet malty flavor smooths over the warming alcohol notes, there are some nice esters here, banana maybe. There is a nice balance between the bitterness and the body. A good tripel."
""
"O: It's not the best tripel I've had, but it is certainly good that I can pick this up at a grocery store. It lacks a lot of character, and is outdone by many other tripels. If I were at the grocery store, I'd grab a sixer. If I was at a bottle shop, I would breeze right past it."

"O: A nice offering from New Belgium, giving an introduction to Belgian tripels. Again, a very drinkable beer and very nice, but compared to Belgian tripels, can't quite stand up to them. However, for the price here in the US, one that I will likely be coming back to again."
""

"D - A solid American interruption of the Tripel style... Far from top tier, but a very solid value given the low price tag... Worth checking out, but not something I would necessarily recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-average, not bellow and certainly not above. It's worth a try but it isn't unique or anything great"
""
"Notes: I haven't been a huge fan of New Belgium's offerings in the past, although I do greatly appreciate their company's ethos and wish to support them. Buying this great beer will have to be how I show my support of their mission. This beer captures the essence of this style."

"A lovely, if unusual, interpretation of a golden Tripel. Hazy pour, with a lasting, sticky head. The nose is where this beer shines. NB's unconventional Belgian yeast strain yields two distinct notes- sulfur and banana, neither of which are mainstays in this style. Totally wild experience, amplified by the juxtaposition of those bold flavors in an otherwise simple, balanced brew. The remainder of the beer is a bit of a letdown, but that's ok. This is one I don't mind sipping, swirling, and then going for the payoff is a big deep whiff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is quite clean and citrusy with pear being quite prominent and the banana/lemon taking a backseat. The overall cleanliness is what really makes this beer for me. I'm not a huge fan of tripels but this one is so dry and crisp with the alcohol barely detectable. A beer I will definitely go back to again."
""
""
""
""
"O: The coriander is a bit strong, but besides that, a solid brew."
""
""
"an interesting brew. pours a honey color with no haze at all. crystal clear. good white head but it fades away instantly. smell is yeast and a bit of herbs and spices. corriander the bottle says, but it must be corriander seed, not fresh herb itself, too musky for that. flavor is nice, malty and sweet, like a wheatwine in ways. only sweet at the very end. mouthfeel is not bad, could stand a touch more carbonation to brighten it up. medium body despite its light color, and lighter in the stomach, down easy. sessionable except for its strength. a good beer for an emerging spring, strong enough to keep ya warm, but light enough to want to drink outside."
"Nothing necessarily jaw-dropping, but a really solid beer and very easy drinking."
""
"Golden in appearance with a half thumbs width white head, that quickly escapes. Taste and smell follow each other pretty well with some belgian yeast, banana, coriander, and grass. Some alcohol is noticeable in the flavor, to my disappointment. A prickly, light to medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, an okay tripel for the price but not the best for the style. Not much depth to this."

"12 ounce bottle into chalice, best by 11/20/2011. Pours clear, yet cloudy, golden straw color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some bits of lacing on the glass, with a nice amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big banana, clove, pear, pepper, lemon, coriander, bread, bubblegum, grass, light tart grain, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of lemon, pepper, pear, coriander, biscuit, banana, herbal, clove, lightly tart grain, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of lemon, pepper, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice overall balance of flavors with no cloying sweetness as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Very drinkable and smooth for the level of alcohol, but it is a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a damn nice and well balanced Belgian style tripel. Nice flavor profile and complexity."

"Overall New Belgium Trippel is a very drinkable yet mild and plain trippel belgian style ale."

"O - A decent beer from New Belgium. There are some Belgian-type characteristics but this is most certainly an American beer with a nod to Belgian roots. Not what I think of when I think of Tripel's, but still a decent beer that's well priced and easy to find in the States."
"D/O: This beer represents a fair approximation of traditional Belgian qualities, packaged into a relatively palate-friendly product. Nose outdistances actual taste in authenticity and interest, with palate-cleansing acidity being overstated. It could be a better tripel by getting acidity under control while cultivating more phenolic spice and some fusel qualities in the flavor."
""
""
""
"It's taken me way the hell too long to try this little guy... It pours a clear golden straw topped by a little over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises banana, clove, wheat, coriander, orange peel, light lemon zest, and a touch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vague sense of sweetness throughout. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a surprisingly very nice little tripel; maybe not one of the paragons of the style, but an enjoyable example nonetheless."

"I do not hold it against New Belgium that their ""Belgian style Trippel"" (sic) is nothing like an actual Tripel. It's more like a Belgian-style golden ale, and a damn fine one at that. It's hard to believe that an American brewer is making a really well-done Belgian-style golden ale, bottle-conditioned mind you, that sells for around $1.50 / bottle. In my opinion, this is the best product in the New Belgium line."
""
"I've had it a few times now, and the one time I had it on tap it was much crisper with heavier carbonation that almost got in the way of some of the more subtle tastes. Still, it comes highly recommended."

"(D)- Overall, one of the better tripels coming out of the states I have had in awhile. Most are too sweet and heavy on the candi sugar, but this one has a good yeast backbone and dryness."

"D: A good American craft beer dressed up as a Trappist for Halloween. Lighter than a real tripel. A solid craft beer that goes down very easily."

"New Belgium Trippel: Despite the popularity of Fat Tire, it is the Belgian style beers that New Belgium brews that are the hallmark of the brewery. The New Belgium Trippel has a clear golden body and ample frothy head. The aroma is mild, but hits all the notes expected of a good Tripel. The flavor is similar. You get the classic Belgian flavors: chewy bread and yeast covered with the gumball sweetness, but they are subtle. The warming alcohol is present throughout, especially at the finish. The New Belgium Trippel is a great sipping experience, but beware, a few will have me feeling it the next day."

"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a 1/2 inch fizzy off-white head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, spices, yeast, and some bubble gum aromas. Taste is very much the same with a lingering aftertaste of bubble gum. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good trippel that is quite easy to drink."
"Overall: I just tried this beer recently. I am a fairly new/young beer drinker so there are still many beers to sample. As far as I am concerned, this is one of the greatest tasting beers I have tired. Smooth and crisp. This beer is a great beer to have year-round. Belgian beer fan? Get a pack (you'll want a case after trying one) and enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"The New Belgium Tripple has the characteristics of a real Belgian trippel, but falls a little short. It's kind of like all the components are there, but it's a beer that makes me say ""Mmmm that's good", not ""Wow!"" Nonetheless, it is a very satisfying beer. The coriander silhouette on the pale blue label is a nice touch."
"O: Goes down easy, tasty, not filling, well hidden kick, nice representation of style. I highly enjoyed this beer - the coriander seemed appropriately balanced and not overpowering which makes it a favor more drinkable beer for me."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is not a very powerful belgian style ale, in fact there is almost nothing about it that can put you off. It is not trying to be a powerful bruit set up for a meal of steak and potatoes, it is an ale that can be sipped on its own and leave you with no disappointment. I certainly see it worthwhile buying a six-pack."
"A refreshing and clean take on the style. Would have again if the mood struck."

"O- A good beer that doesn't have too much going on. I will buy this again."
"Good, interesting beer."
"Overall, not a bad beer. It's definitely underwhelming, but if you like affordable Belgian-esque beers then this is for you."
"This is where BA kind of lacks (not like I have a better beer reviewing website with thousands of followers), but here is a great tasting brew, that looks like a stella. So my review is lowered...are we that shallow that we care so much on looks? Yes. yes we are."
"I hope the New Belgium Brewery keeps this year around because it is a nice interpretation of an abbey trippel that I can find at most supermarkets."
"People go ape for Fat Tire, but having had it, this might be the sleeper big dog out of New Belgium's regular offerings."
"Pours a clear yellowish color, small white head to it. Aroma is of faint hops. Taste is light to medium bodied. For being a high ABV beer, the taste is pretty subdued. While it's very smooth and drinkable, it just seems a bit light and only faint hoppiness. Pretty solid beer all around, wish it was a little more adventurous but a great price."
"A tripel with nice depth, lots going on, but ultimately this one didn't quite hit my sweet spot. Technically probably excellent, but for me, just a run-o-the-mill good beer."
"O - I was hoping for a little more from this trippel, but at the price it is a good deal."
"Overall - an ok beer with unique flavors. Nothing really noteworthy or complex for a tripel, but suprisingly easy to drink."

"O- Not my favorite tripel, but a very good beer none the less."
"Overall this is one of the better beers from New Belgium in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel- Good amount of carbonation, very crisp and refreshing.. This beer would be great on a hot day.. very refreshing."
"Overall: I think new belgium is an exciting brewery with a lot to offer the beer lover but they also need to make beer for the masses to please the wives and girlfriends tagging along, and that is what this beer is about for me."
"D - a nice big glass will do you. It would serve best as a taster to demonstrate a milder tripel."
"Tastes sweet but not cloying. Very rich flavors of pears and honey with lingering notes flower nectar. To me the hops are non-detectable but are just present enough enough to keep the beer from tasting syrupy. Body and weight are consistent with my favorite trippels. A very good beer in every respect."
"This is pretty darn good. And think about this - 22oz bottle is 3.99 at my spot, and only 3.4 ounces less than a Belgian 750ml that would cost 9.99 easily."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It is very representative of the style. The flavors are complex and fairly well balanced with the exception of the slight bitterness at the front. The citrus and spice are a little overpowered by the malts, but all in all, a tasty beer."
"Overall: Very tasty beer with a creamy mouthfeel and a nice crisp finish. A solid trippel and another quality beer by New Belgium."
"I didn't dislike this beer. It's about what I've come to expect recently from New Belgium Brewing. I'm not sure if that is a function of my tastes become more sophisticated or NB dropping some of their standards. I seem to remember loving all of their beers when I first tried them several years ago. At the time, they were mostly a Colorado brewery, now they have expanded, and I'm not sure they've kept all of their standards. In any case, this beer is decent, not a bad choice, but I wouldn't seek it out. Certainly, there was quite a bit of spice - otherwise I found the taste and the aroma to be strong, but not particularly unique or elite. It claims to be brewed with coriander. That's cool I guess, but it doesn't stop this from being a slightly better than average beer. For the price and the sexy art...I wanted a little better."
"Pours a translucent orangish-gold w/ minimal head and nary a lace patch in sight. A spicy, citrusy, yeasty smell hits me as I swear there's more than a hint of corriander in here. I'm picking up some spicy pepper, a touch of alcohol/medicinal and a lemon/orange/sharp citric twang. This beer goes down real easy as it is smooth and surprisingly sweet. It's a like a sugary honey sweetness as well as some sweet gruits and this beer has a balance w/ some sharp citric notes and touches of bitter fruit - not tomention the dry/sharp finish thanks to the alchohol bite. I like the overall feel of the beer and for less than $4 a bomber it is cheaper than most triples but I just thought it lacked the depth of a top notch tripel."
"Ov- I always find myself comparing this to the recipe they brewed pre-2004. They just seemed to mute everything. Still good though."
"M - Medium-to-thin body, dry, crisp and well-carbonated. Incredibly smooth and drinkable for a near-8% ale."
"Wow, this is an addictive beer; I wanted another immediately after my glass, but my codrinkers had polished it off"
"The mouthfeel is medium, carbonated well. Pretty drinkable. Coriander or not (didn't really taste it as much myself), it's a great beer."
"O-It's not for me. This style is kind of a non-favorite of mine though."
"O - A very solid trippel. Definitely something I would come back to and use to introduce someone to the style."
"Overall, this beer is a good attempt at a trippel, the smell is spot on, but the taste really puts it back a little for me. I'll have to try the ""Abbey"" beer from New Belgium, as they were close to the mark on this one."
"This pours a clear light yellow color with a decent white head (although lacking compared to the Belgium triples). The smell is of lots of coriander, with some citrus and yeast smells. The feel is light. The taste is pretty good, the obvious taste is of coriander and its pretty heavy, behind that there is a little peppery taste, some citrus fruit, slight hints of vitterness and not as dry as some of my favorites, there is a little alcohol burn also. Overall I'd probably always prefer a true belgium tripel over this, but with a 6 pack of this being much cheaper than 2 bottles of the others, I could see myself buying this again."
"Is created by some good hop selection, which creates great balance to this very drinkable Trippel. Great job!!"
"D: a really solid tripel. the ""lighter"" alcohol content makes this dangerous. good sweet sugar and solid malt backbone makes every sip enjoyable. for $3.49 a bomber at my local grocery store, this is an easy pick."
"All in all, New Belgium's Trippel is a pleasant and enjoyable beer to drink. While not the best Trippel I've ever had, I would definitely drink again. It's an all around pleasant beer."
"O: Dial back the alcoholic heat and all would be great here. You can see a shot at something good, but it just doesn't deliver."
"O: Awesome Trippel in my opinion. As a matter of fact, this may be the most drinkable and smoothest one I've ever tasted."
"A good tripel, though with coriander prominent on the label, it certainly didn't leave its mark."
"Overall: A better-than-average tripel. Certainly worth a try if you can find it."
"Overall, a well balanced, surprisingly light yet flavorful tripel."
"O- ok I was hoping for more from this beer, A bit thin and under complex for the style, overall average but still drinkable, a good starter."
"O: I like this beer, but I wish they would pull the coriander back or completely out of this beer. A tripel should be able to stand alone without spicing or extra flavors - I think this beer and its lackluster finish would improve with no spicing and a crisper hops finish. The price is definitely right."
"Overall, an underwhelming example of the style. With so many other great Tripels out there, why bother? Nice try, New Belgium, but I'd like to see this one taken back to the drawing board."
"The taste is wonderfully rounded and balanced. Banana is there, but a spicy kick beats it out and really drives the Belgian flavor home. Coriander has the same rounding effect in the taste as it does the nose, not overly implemented here to the benefit of this beer. It adds to the splendid balance this trippel has. Spicy clove has a say in here too, giving it a note remeniscent of a slight biscuit quality. Booze is warming, not hot but also not a huge part of the taste profile. It does come out a little more as the beer warms up, but so do all the complexities so the taste remains balanced. Mouthfeel is right on for the style, with a nice long finish. Just a really well done trippel, I'm glad I picked this up."
"Overall this is a good beer, but not a great one. Maybe this bottle was too fresh, some time aging could help marry these flavors a lot better. I haven't had too many tripels; I wasn't crazy about this one but loved la fin du monde."
"O- Decent for the price, if you are comparing to an authentic Trappist Trippel, you will most likely be disappointed."
"This is more of a session beer than a tripel, which I am used to savoring. This is, however, a strong beer so I use the term ""session"" with reservation."
"D- Enjoyable, but there are many better tripels out there."
"O - Overall a pretty good Tripel, but I expected a little more flavor a complexity. Surprisingly light and drinkable for a 7.8% Tripel."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is fruity, yeast. Taste is good, fruits, a touch of coriander, yeast, a hint of alcohol, lots of flavor here. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an excellent beer."
" ~ This is a good beer. I am a big fan of the style and I think New Belgium has done a good job of creating a solid tripel right here in the US. This is a good drinkable beer that offers some nice 'head' along the way."
"84."
"O- This is a unique, enjoyable beer. It just doesn't reach up into the upper echelon for the style. Still, if you haven't had this- check it out. Glad this is available in the DC area now."
"O: The banana may be a bit too much. 3.5"
"Pours a beautiful full bodied clear golden liquid with a massive dence white head. Smell is of spice and sweeter malts, citrus like orange, some very light summer grass, yeasty and biscuity. A pleasant aroma overall. It has some tang to it, a a nice alcohol air, the taste comes across with yellow fruits accented by an earthy sort of spice. It is clean and filling, full bodied and refreshing. Overall, I'd say this is a supremely quaffable mainstream trippel."
"It pours with a nice thick head of about 2 fingers high. The beer is golden and clear with nice small bubble action. After a couple minutes, the head settles to a lacy thin foam topping the beer. It smells of yeast and spice. The taste is a mix of flavors that seem right together and some not so. First, there is a malty taste that is somewhat funky like a mild malt vinegar. Then, there is a fruity (mild pear or peach?), herbal taste with the coriander hints. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium with some mild carbonation. It different than most tripels, but I enjoyed it."
"A couple of the boys I play cards with call this ""the tripper", in regards to how quickly it sneaks up on them. Very accurate in my opinion. The problem is how easy it is to reach for another."
"Overall somewhat enjoyable but not gravitating towards that strongly, but I could see myself having this again."
"Beer is medium in body and soft on the palate with a wet finish. There is a floral flavor and feeling to this whole beer that makes it quite enjoyable. The corriander is present but not annoying, it is a fine beer overall. I would have it again, a little too sweet for a tripel."
"O: I would like a more complex beer, but, at the price of $8.99 for a sixer, it's good. I like coriander, and this beer definitely has it. Also good with a hearty meal."
"A decent tripel; for the money, a very good tripel."
"Golden in color with a touch of amber. Long lasting white head. The aroma consists of feint peach, grain, and some berries. The mouthfeel is medium in body. Grain, spice and hops balance the malt sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable midway and carries through into the finish. This seems actually pretty clean for a trippel and goes down fairly well. Even better with food, I'd imagine, as this beer by itself doesn't seem to distinguish itself from other trippels. Curious as to how this would age."
"A solid beer that is more herbal than most Tripels, and less sweet, but still falls well within the category. Pours a brilliant golden with a short head that fades to a thin ring. Smells yeasty like a fresh dinner roll and there are huge notes of coriander as well as a bit of fruity sweetness. The taste is biscuity, herbal, and slightly sweet, but most definitely on the dryer side for the style. A little bit grainy in the mouth, almost chalky, but overall this is a fairly pleasant beer."
"this beer is very taste of an authentic, but much fresher, Belgian ale...i enjoyed the great malyiness of this beer...as well as the great biscuit malt and carbonation that they always do well!....the mouth feel was extremely dry, not my fav but very true to style...overall a very outstanding beer!"
"O: Overall not a bad brew but a little light in the flavor department."
"D: As a tripel it seems like a one trick pony, that is, one flavor and everything else is just a guess, but for 8.99 for a sixer it is an incredible bargain if you have a taste for Belgium."
"Solid beer for sure, but I feel the same way about this as I do about their Dubbel. Its a good take on the style, but the edge goes to the Trappist versions."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of wheat notes with some pepper and Belgian yeast notes. There is not much sweetness in the aroma. The flavor is also full of yeast and wheat notes, with some white pepper and a little bit of candy sugar. The alcohol is barely noticeable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: This is okay; the coriander and soapy hops are a little much though."
"Overall, I understand why this isn't presently among the top 20 or even top 50 of the tripels on BA. It's good drinking, make no mistake. Regarding comparable tripels it's probably closest to Tripel Karmeliet with its flavor profile, but TK packs a bit more of a punch than this, NB's Trippel."
"O - Very easy drinker, alcohol is very hidden, nice spicy finish. Would like a little more esters to go with the phenols, but still an enjoyable beer."
"O: A pretty good beer. Definitely a deviation from the styles I'm normally used to. Will hit others in this style definitely."
"Overall - A very good brew. Fairly interesting in the taste, and it seems to hit very near home on the accuracy of the style."
"D: Excellent sipping beer but tastes so good you'll be sipping often. Delicious and refreshing!"
"This beer pours rather clear medium golden color with a thin white head. The aroma is medium-high spicy, citrus esters as well as some bubble gum. The flavor is quite delicious, a nice balancing act of slightly sweet malt and spicy, peppery character from the yeast. The beer finishes a bit dry, with a medium-low hop bitterness and spicy hop flavor, leaving you wanting more. The body is medium-full and carbonation nearing high, but appropriately so. Overall a satisfying, well executed trippel."
"Overall this is a nice tripel. Not too different than la fin du monde (maybe not quite as good)."
"Not a bad Tripel at all and quite drinkable despite the alcohol content; as with the brewery's example of the Dubbel style, bottle conditioning would probably do this beer justice, but it's perfectly good without it. This would pair excellently with spicier dishes or even lighter fare like salads."
"I'm not sure I'd call this beer a triple. Yes, the alcohol is up there, but the flavor isn't nearly as bold as other triples. Hell, the leffe blonde seemed to have as much if not more flavor. It does hit a price point at around $7.50 a six here, but I probably won't be revising this one..."
"Overall - A good beer but not a great beer, I've got to say American made Belgian beers aren't the greatest at all its not the easiest style to copy. For only 7.8% I can taste all of it NB did a terrible job at hiding it. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O: Not a great tripel, but a good enough beer. Yeasty-plain and citrus-tart. Not recommended, but I might someday have another."
"Overall/notes - I remember being kind of mum on this a long time ago, and I can see why. It's a good beer, but it pales in comparison to the dozens of other higher-quality tripels out there. Certainly worth a taste, but don't go out of your way to hunt for one."
"O - Way back in the day, this was a staple of mine. Honestly haven't had it in years. Still enjoy it and think its well done. Tripel isn't my favorite style, but I do enjoy this beer nonetheless"
"Overall, not a bad beer for $1 a bottle, but not at all a typical example of the style."
"O: Not the best trippel, but still enjoyable. Like their dubbel, I wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't seek it out, either."
"Overall- I can't even believe this is a 7.8% beer! It seems much too light to be a Tripel but not too hard to put onto people who want a light, easy to drink beer. I still enjoyed it but not the type of beer I was looking for with Trippel being labeled on the front. (maybe I don't remember having this beer before!)"
"Overall this is a very pleasant beer. I nice gateway to the Belgian Tripel style."
"On tape at my watering hole, Old Chicago Westminster. Poured a clear golden color with a quarter inch white head that quickly disapated. Aroma of malt, fresh baked bread/yeast, and some caramel. Taste is where this one's at: malt/bread, yeast, a bit of caramel, with a clean/crisp finish. This has always been one of my favs from NB; definitely better on draft."
"D- A solid example of a Tripel at an economical price that's very easy to find. This is a great benefit and one I purchase regularly."
"Overall - I would drink it again if you offered it to me for free. For all of it's flaws, it goes down easily. It's not a bad drink, it's just a bad drink for it's style."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer despite it doesn't match up to its Belgian counterparts. It is a great value at $8.99 for a six pack."
"Nice flow into my glass resulting in a two finger head of dense off white, to very light yellow foam. Lace is a little broken, but has a good cling. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart, with clear presentation and lots of micro bubbles. Smell is heavenly, with the almost overpowering aroma of peaches. There are also fragrances of melon, lime peel, and flowers. I wish the taste was a good as the smell, but it was a muted version, with flavors of peaches, slightly sour oranges...maybe tangelos, something in there is like Swiss cheese, and a whips of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a potent explosion of carbonation. There is a slight coating of sweet, sticky phlegm in the back of my throat, but it is sort of pleasing. Over all this was a great journey and the buzz is just what I needed. If I see the label again, I will most certainly put it in my shopping vessel."
"I thought this beer was alright. I've had La Fin Du Monde, and that was a FAR superior tripel. This beer is decent for the price, but I recommend their Abbey over this one."
"Paired with spicy pepperjack, which combined to make a nice sharp bitterness. New Belgium absolutely knocked this one out of the park. A great Belgian imitation, an absolute steal at 8 bucks for a sixer."
"Overall, I'm not overly impressed with this brew. It IS drinkable, but I'm not so sure I'll want to do that very often."
"Overall: As NBT stands currently at 7.8% alcohol, it's ultimately lighter in body and alcohol and less cloying than many other tripels. I'm down with that. I will stand up for New Belgium Trippel."
"A competent Trippel but not much more."
"Taste was light with little aftertaste that sweetens as it warms."
"Poured light yellow/amber with a small 1/3"" head that dissipated over time. Nice floral, belgium smell (Munich hops?). Light floral alcohol taste with a nice warming of the stomach and not to overpowering. This is a great low cost Belgian and better than some of the more expensive Belgian style beers I have tried lately."
"{revisited and review tweaked in Sept. 2012]"
"D: On the whole, this is a decent, drinkable beer, but not necessarily a great one."
"D - Excellent. I would love another, but a little too strong to put down a 6 pack in a evening. But a great beer."
"(Note: the label touts “bottle conditioned,” but don't make any cellaring plans. I naively stashed some of these away for a while, but even after just 6 months they tasted awful.)"
"Overall-Bought this as a single not knowing what to get, but I was actually impressed. Definitely not the best trippel by any means, but for 1.79, can't go wrong. I enjoyed it more then I thought I would."
"Poured a very transparent golden color with quite a bit of fluffy white head on it. Good lacing as well. Great malt aroma with really good floral notes. Nice crisp refreshing bite on this beer. Yeast taste up front, good citrus and floral malt taste as well. Some alcohol coming through on the taste, but not terrible. Pretty smooth drinking beer overall, I enjoyed it. Wouldn't mind going for this one again."
"Overall: A decent Tripel and very reasonably price. However, it won't blow you away like other Tripels that are also widely available will."
"D - a very nice beer, and a good Belgian style beer as well. I'd like to try more in this style to have a bit more context."
"Prosit!"
"I don't have much experience with tripels, but I enjoyed this brew and certainly plan to explore the style."
"Consumed on 3.23.11 during the last month of freshness, according to the bottle noted date of 27MAR11. Into a tulip glass this reveals a bright and somewhat clear yellow gold color (allowing the sediment from the bottle into my glass) under a light but persistent foamy head. Moderate aroma is a mostly yeasty one with a sweet lemon ester. Echoing ""Belgian"" yeast and bright malt politely makes its way all over my palate and seems to get smoother and more distinguishable with every sip. Notes of lemon rind, light coriander, and bready malt resonate in the aftertaste. I could sip through several of these..."
"Notes: Not a bad brew, and If one is on the style it is pleasing and quaffable. But for me this is certainly on the weaker side of New Belgium's offerings."
"D - Drinks pretty easily despite the higher ABV. I normally stop at one because the sweetness starts to get to me."
"Drinkability - You'd be hard pressed to find a lot of beers as drinkable as this in its ABV range without leaving the US. Great beer, and easy as hell to drink. And definitely something I want to come back to and share with friends another day. This is a poor-mans Chimay."
"In a Chimay glass (for effect). Pours golden amber with a light whitish head that dissipates quickly. Light fruit, belgian yeast and phenols in the nose. Mouthfeel is crisp and thin. Notes of beligian sugar, the yeast, coriander, with a crisp finish. When I say crisp, I dont mean hops, it ends with a carbonation-y crispness like carbonated water. Its not a bad thing."
"D: Fairly high, but at 7.8% abv it could catch up to you quicker than you'd expect."
"What other Tripel is this good at this price? try and find one."
"Huge citrus nose on this one. Very pungent with orange peel and lemon zest clearly represented on top on a nice Belgian ale. Some light notes of grass, peaches, and maybe some light grain all coming together quite nicely to provide a well balanced attack on the senses. The flavor was just as solid here. Rich notes of biting citrus just came ripping through your tongue, shredding the taste buds initially before relaxing into a mellow, but still highly floral Belgian ale. Some light notes from the alcohol and the yeast started to peak through as it warmed, hinting at some depth. Letting it come close to room temp is where you really start to find that depth. Some light grain like malts, hints of peaches and bananas and just an all out really nice profile. One of the brightest tasting Belgian ales I have had in a very long time. Medium bodied feel was never dull with a more then adequate carbonation profile that was just wonderful. A sure fired sipper, I enjoyed this one tremendously over the course of the evening."
"A golden color that reminded me of the beers I used to drink. Smell of carmel and chocolate. Taste of strong chocolate. Mouthful is a feeling like no other. Goes down very smooth and drinkabity is a wonderful for a day of crinking with the good friends."
"D: Goes down easily with the light body. Overall, not a bad tripel by any means, though its flavors are all a bit muted, making it seem more a witbier than a tripel. Still, it manages to pull off the light and crisp body where many American takes on the style fail, and for that alone I have to give it credit. Only costing $10 for a sixer helps, too."
"This beer used to be truly in the trippel style, and used to be great. It was so disappointing when New Belgium ruined their previously outstanding and true to styel trippel by adding coriander to it. While it is still a drinkable beer, it is no longer the outstanding and wonderful true to style trippel it used to be. they should re-name it something else, and bring back the old trippel. Personally, I'll seldom by by this beer again, only if I make fish or shell fish with coriander, where I used to buy 2-4 6 packs (depending on price) whenever the grocery store I usually go to had it."
"Drinkability is good. I don't really love this on exactly but it is OK. Too bad this isn't less sweet and the mushroom thing needs to go away."
"this is a very drinkable beer and hits the style right on the bullseye. I think when a lot of people think of a Belgian ale they are looking for the deeper complexities and richness of the dark ales but trippels are lighter and crisper with a little more carbonation evident. well done, New Belgium."
"To me this is a pretty average craft beer overall. I don't think it stacks up compared to real Belgian trippels. The ABV is about where it should be but the distinctive sweetness and punchiness of the herbs aren't there. I could smell the coriander when I sniffed it, but I didn't get a hint of it when I drank it. That said it's a decent beer, but of the NB products I like 1554 and Fat Tire a little better, and having had a few dubbels and trippels in my day, this just seems like a light version of those."
"Dr: I'd definitely have it again, especially considering its price and ABV."
"D: very easy refreshing drinker considering the abv.."
"jd"
"D- I would love to start the night off with one of these everytime i drink. Good stuff"
"Drinkability: This beer was my gateway into trying more Belgian beers. It's a year-round go-to beer for me. The complex and well-balanced flavor almost completely masks the fact this is a 7.8% ABV beer."
"Glad they put this in 6-packs! Pours a crystal clear gold color...almost completely clear with no color. Medium white head that diminishes fairly quickly. Scent is very sweet with strong coriander and bubble gum. I'm not sure if I've used bubble-gum as an aroma descriptor before, but this FOR SURE has it. STRONG BUBBLEGUM. Hint of banana and Belgian yeast. Taste is very complex with that bubblegum flavor and clove. I love how this beer tastes. You get a completely balanced variety of pepper, coriander, clove, bubblegum, Belgian yeast, banana, and light hoppiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, but doesn't necessarily have that feel I like in a genuine Belgian tripel. Drinkability is high, and ABV is scarily well-hidden. Overall, a great beer and starter for people getting into Belgian triples, just not a close enough example of a genuine one."
"This is a very good take on a belgian trippel, in a decidedly New Belgium style. The beer pours a nice clear gold, and has a bold smell of yeast. The taste is almost one-dimensional in the presence of what I would call a classic sour-bready belgian yeast flavor. Just hints of more complexity on the back end with sugars, floral hops, and milder yet notes of citrus. I mark this down for a sticky aftertaste of spent yeast flavor."
"Pour was light clear golden with a fluffy white head. Aroma was of pepper, herbs, earth, floral esters, and some banana. Flavors were well blended with some banana, bread, pepper, spice, and light orange. Body was medium to light and this was an easy drink. Nice brew."
"Trippel is good and, with a couple tweaks, could be very good. Well worth trying, and a nice complement to their (to me superior) Abbey Dubbel."
"This is the first Trippel i've had and right off the bat i noticed what an interesting style this is. I've also noticed that a lot of imported breweries feature this brew. I will definitely be trying this again. For it is a brew that you have to experience for yourself I highly reccomend you go out and get some. Similar to the Belgian White, its not for everyone. Also some might like a Coriander beer with citrus just like the Witbier. Overall nice brew. Keeps you warm which is why its in the Folly Pack."
"Poured into a New Belgium snifter. It's funny how that works out. It poured a very thin, golden, almost straw yellow with a one finger poofy white head. It looks incredibly light for a Tripel. It's very clear and doesn't offer any cloudiness. The smell is pretty bland too. It smells like a weak dortmunder and nothing like a Tripel. Where's the coriander? the yeast? At least the flavor is a little better. Here you get some coriander, a full creamy yeasty flavor with a mild sweetness followed by breadyness. It's solid but nothing too special. It drinks thicker than it looks, but it looks extremely thin. It's light to medium bodied in consistency. It's ok, and just ok in all fields. I'm certainly glad I didn't buy an entire six pack."
"I'm a big fan of new belgium, but this is not one of my favs. I think that it is the smell that turns me off, because the flavor is pretty good."
"D: Maybe this is typical of the style but this beer is deep spicy and with a little hoppy bitterness and tries to finish crisp and dry but instead of doing that with flavor and refreshment it kicks you in the butt on the way out with alcohol. Trippel's got character but I can't see myself having more than a couple of these."
"D: WOW! New Belgium, which I think is pretty good, shocked me. This is quite good and you need to give it a chance. High chance of taking down more than a few...yum."
"D: Dangerously easy-drinking"
"It's not bad but there are so many better beers of this style."
"I have been a fan of this beer for a while (although not a New Belgium fan in general). Even with the high ABV, it's very drinkable."
"Drinkability was good, semi sessionable even for a strong beer. Price wise this is one of the most affordable tripels but quality wise it doesnt stand up to the best in it's style."
"Drinkability -- This is a great example of the style: Delicate, complex, and a little funky, and with an alcohol character that walks a fine line. In fact, it's almost too easy drinking. Definitely better than I had anticipated. Not my favorite of the style, but this beer is no slouch. I could see this being a gateway Belgian-style beer."
"D - This is a decent representative of the style."
"Final word: A very enjoyable brew, especially considering the price tag. I'll certainly buy it again. Was just a little spicy, and maybe not quite sweet enough for the style, but definitely a very solid offering from NB."
"I loved this brew and respect what the makers have created. At 7.8% a robust and complex beer and also very drinkable."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best before 10/30/11. Pours a bright, clear, golden yellow with two fingers of lumpy foam. Lots of carbonation can be seen. Very nice lacing. Banana, some orange citrus, and coriander on the nose. Medium body with slightly low carbonation carbonation. A little different malt character than the great trippels. It has some of that same roasted malt character that Fat Tire has only a lot less. Not as clean and crisp as you might like but still very good. Banana and honey expressions in the light and sweet malt. This is super tasty and easy to drink. I could definitely kick back one or two of these and still have room for something else."
"D. At nearly 8%, this drinks very easily. The alcohol is well hidden too. I purchased a variety pack before Christmas and this has been the only beer I have enjoyed of the bunch."
"Notes - Not bad. Not as good as other Trippels but a good brew none the less. 7.49 well spent tonight."
" D- This beer has a nice character with a full but well blended coriander flavor but it is not overly spiced. The beer is light and dry and has some nice supporting flavor making this a well rounded tripel."
"While this is not as potent as a traditional Belgian or Euro triple, this is the best offering the U.S. has had in the triple category for a long time. This beer is not as sweet as the Euro counterparts, but pours a beautiful, dark brown pour, minimal head and carbonation, a sugary, malty aroma and leaves a slight tinge of bitterness on the tongue."
"D. Drinkable Tripel for sure. I prefer tripels on the sweeter side, and this was right there. Not quite as complex a taste as some of the best, but this is a good beer."
"i was bit disappointed with the lack of character and overall flavour. these new belgium beers are clean and crisp to a fault sometimes. the label states that it's bottle conditioned, but i don't see anything in the glass that supports this claim. solid but stoic in nature. just not memorable in any way."
"Although I have had less-than-pleasant experiences with coriander flavored beer in the past, I must admit that this was quite enjoyable. The coriander flavor is very mild and the beer itself is quite good. Perhaps a bit too strong for a decent session beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, not the best beer in the style but it's worth drinking for a little while."
"I was very disappointed with this one, the appearance and aroma were fantastic, but the flavor really turned me off. Between the alcohol and the phenolics, this one was harsh and not terribly drinkable."
"I probably won't be picking this up anytime. It was not my idea of a good Triple. Very sweet, thin, and boring. Those tiny hints of weak yeast don't cut it for a triple. They tried to compensate with the coriander but fell short. I guess not everything can be awesome. I still love this brewery though!"
"Reviewed on 4/30/2010. 12 oz bottle. Pours a semi-hazy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, spices, sweet fruits, bready malt. Flavor is sweet initially with a spicy, bready finish. Nice spice presence, very drinkable, very flavorful. Great trippel!"
"D: Seems like a decent example of a Trippel style, but nothing unique or great about the beer to me."
"This beer is a poor example of the style, so I was exceptionally disappointed when I had my first taste. The appearance is light and golden with a thin head, and not nearly as captivating as true trippel's. The aroma is pungent and akin to what I'd expect from a Miller Lite if it were home brewed (which means better than the macro-style), with a little bit of that classic ""Heineken"" skunky smell, probably the coriander. The beer has a mild velvetly sweetness to it, with distinguished abrasrasive and non-complex pilsner malt and coriander flavors. They obviously didn't use an abbey yeast for this. I'm actually quite disgusted with this beer, and I love most beers (with the exception of brown ales which i do not prefer, but that's just my preference.) I feel quite conflicted posting such a poor review as others seem to enjoy this brew, so take it with a grain of salt.... but if you are used to anything even remotely similar to the Chimay Trippel, you will be dissapointed."
"D - Good beer; definitely something I thought I would not enjoy but was pleasantly pleased to find out that it was so good; I 'm not normally a fan of coriander spiced beers, but this one takes the cake and probably something you can enjoy with a piece of as well"
"Big fan of this brewery. Hoping to try some more before I depart TX."
"Drinkability: Given the Devil's Backbone I just had, it doesn't stack up well to it. I don't think I'd crate this beer again, though it was an enjoyable beer."
"D: High marks for drinkability. At 7.8%, you could actually drink a few of these, unlike most trippels. All considered, it's a clean-tasting, easy-drinking beer."
"Basically an ok at best tripel. Nowhere near as good as a true Belgian tripel, and probably the weakest of the US made ones I have had."
"bottles date is 20feb11."
"D- Very drinkable. The high alcohol makes it a sipper, but a delicious one."
"Overall a very nice drink, but it would be nicer if they hid the alcohol more."
"This classic Belgian abbey-style ale with a redesigned label initially pours an unimpressive pale gold, but the thick head and dense nose brings to mind cinnamon, ripe fruity banana, and clove/coriander. The taste is a bum-rush of spice up front, followed by a mellow maltiness, then a stronger alcohol sting (it's 7.8%). A perfect example of this style, and made in America. New Belgium's Trippel is a delightful and delicious beer."
"D - Not a bad beer that I wouldn't mind having again sometime but I wouldn't buy it again. I think they filtered the beer way too much. It says it's bottle conditioned but I didn't get any haze at all. Overall it's okay, the most I could drink is probably about 1-2 12oz bottles and that's it. I don't recommend this beer at all and I'd pass for something else."
"I can't say im much of a fan of the Belgian yeast in beers but putting my personal preferences aside, this seems to be a solid tripel worthy of a B-B+. Certainly nothing exciting about it though. Worth trying for yourself, at the very least."
"Drink- I can't get these in CA except on draft and I only have two left. Maybe its time to go back to Denver."
"The beer is a clear pale yellow. The head did not last long but im gonna guess its cause of the glass. The aroma is hints of belgian candi sugar with a slight hint of coriander. There is a little bit of an alochol taste in the beginning, but it quickly turns to a sweet taste. Looking at the recipe you do get hints of baking bread with the victory malt and an extra sweetness with the munich malt. It is very interesting that they use liberty hops. I have always wanted to try brewing with them. The hop taste is low, but it is noble. The mouthfeel is light, and it is a very drinkable beer!"
"New Belgium Trippel was light gold in color with excellent clarity. It had a very large white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was spice and fruit. The taste was good with sweetness from the candi sugar, yeast flavors and spices (coriander). The finish was semi-dry with just touch of throat warming alcohol. It was medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good Trippel and worth trying."
"D May not have another. Its a strong ale and a bit overdone. 3.5 "
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a moderate yellow-gold color with a white head and a fairly decent amount of lacing. Nose brings some alcohol, slight spicing, and a bit of light fruit. The taste brings some pale malt as well as spice and alcohol. Spice and booze mix fairly well in the feel, but overall this one just wasn't ready and didn't live up to the standards of the style."
"I could definitely session a few of these bad boys... Its alright, definitely not a choice trippel but for a sixer for 9 bucks its an ok deal."
"D- Good drinkability. The beer for me goes a little down with drinkability once it warms up and the alcohol becomes more present. Overall a good rep of the style but lacks the adventure I think they were going for."
"Appearance is a very clear, light golden color.  Smells are banana and spice right off the bat, a very strong yeast scent.  Flavor is banana, slight hints of spices, maybe allspice.  Mouthfeel is medium. I wasn't really expecting much but I thought this one was pretty good."
"Pours a bright golden color with a thick layer of pillowy white head. The aroma is a potent blend of honey, caramelized sugars, wheat and yeast. initial palate of hops and toasted malt along with honey, banana, orange spice and smoooth alcohol. There's also a faint coriander, for which I expected more of. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with medium carbonation and a dry, fruity finish. An Excellent beer that packs a punch!!"
"Hmmm, I remember this being better the first time I tried it. Regardless, still another impressive beer from New Belgium Brewing Inc."
"medium body, some smoothness, but punctuated by crisp phenols and astringency (which also have the effect of thinning out the body at times). tingly carbonation, both crisp and fluffy."
"Carbonation is good without being excessive and the mouthfeel is quite crisp. Drinkability is where this brew really shines, as the ABV is well hidden and I could easily knock back a few of these if I wasn't careful."
"D: For 7.8%, this baby goes down easy. A success."
"D- The high carbonation make this quite drinkable, despite the higher alcohol. A nice representation of style, especially the flavor profile. The coriander seemed to only show up in any substantial amount in the aroma; probably faded fast."
"Usually I do not agree with the idea of adjuncts in a beer but in this case it works. Its light and crisp while still having moderate alcohol and most importantly, lots of flavor. Glad I still have 4 left of the six pack but they aren't going to last long."
"It is an ok Trippel. Maybe i expected a little more from New Belgium. :)"
"""That's love."""
"After the initial shock from the spices the beer becomes very quaffable but shouldn't be taken lightly as the 7.8% ABV will kick in faster than you can predict."
"This is a VERY tasty tripel. I'm very impressed with New Belgium, as usual. This could definitely be a go to beer as far as tripels go."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a thin white head. No hints of sediment, even though it says bottle conditioned on the label. Smells of fresh yeast. Taste is light grain up front, with a sour apple middle, and a dry medicinal bitterness in the finish. Hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is decent, low carbonation. Drinkability is good, light and refreshing. Overall a good beer, but compared to most tripels it falls a bit short."
"Overall this was a very boring beer, and not much flavor at all"
"m/d-didn't leave a spectacular taste in the mouth, but surely a mild sweetness. goes down smooth and i intend to knock down a few more bottles this evening"
"Overall not that bad. It looked like a lager but tasted like an ale. I would not have guessed this was a Trippel Belgian Style Ale though. Worth a try and I would buy it again if it were on sale and I was having trouble sleeping. My favorite from NB is still 1554."
"Drinkability: Good Tripel that is slightly hampered by a too sweet body."
"Putting all of my nagative feelings about New Belgium, this beer is a pleasant surprise. I'm 2 for 2 on the last NB's (Ranger). This is a very drinkable summer brew, lovely candy coriander flavoring, and an actual beer taste on the end, unlike the onsluaght of this style sitting at your local Safeway. The soccer-moms micro comes through, good stuff."
"New Belgium Brewing Company--Trippel Belgian Style Ale--2009 22 oz. Bottle. 7.80% ABV. 25 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Rich foamy lacy white head. Clear pretty bright gold color. Mild hop delicate banana ester Belgian front. Dry candi sweet crisp mild CO2 thin textured pils malt mildly fruity Trippel body. Easy smooth hop hint refreshing end. Dangerously drinkable. Sediment dust. Sampled 8/6/2010. 2 @ $2.79 Each."
"Drinkability the only big hit on this one. Big, prominent alcohol, a bt syrupy, and the massive sweetness and the big coriander are both a bit wearing in their own right, even if they do balance each other somewhat. Not a bad tripel at all, and what it lacks in subtlety it makes up for in flavor, though not entirely."
"Final Notes: A delicious, well balanced beer for multiple different occasions and food pairings. Big flavor and complex. Highly recommended."
"Taste wise it is a bit like biting into an under ripe orange, but cut with a little hint of sugar. It's spicy, crisp and warm. I like this beer but I would classify this one more closer in style to Duvel, but I'm no expert."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is some really tasty stuff! I was worried about the coriander, but it played a nice backup role to the malt, yeast, and alcohol. Well balanced, a very good sipper."
"P.S. Their Abbey style is not even close. Don't confuse it with their ""Trippel""."
"drinkability: average for the style at best"
"Some spice, at both ends of the spice spectrum, like from nutmeg to the hot kind. Alcohol was a little too hot for my wishes. Really just tastes like an imperial hefe/witbier. If that's your kind of thing, its probably made decently, but the absence of any real appreciable malt or hop character, make this is a tough sell. The yeast strain was ok, but had a disagreeable tartness to it."
"If you are looking for the real deal start with a Duvel or Tripel Karmeliet and if you know beer and this style avoid this rip off!"
"d = well...i made it through 3 of 6 bottles; but with that have reached my lifetime limit. I see no reason to drink this beer when there are hundreds of better belgian style tripples out there; most of which are refreshing, complex and rewarding."
"d 4.5 very easy drinking. the balance and straightforward demeanor make this one of those you need to make an effort to avoid downing too quickl."
"D: this is one of the more drinkable Tripels around IMO. It tastes very authentic, features bold flavors, and is expertly balanced. Plus, it is one of the best value 6 packs around at 7.99."
"Drinkability: A nice example of a tripel brewed with spices. In this case the flavors worked well together, and I would like to have a few of these on hand at all times."
"Drinkability- Would maybe buy this once more to try it again and see if the taste is better the next time"
"Pretty drinkable. I'll certainly buy it again, fitting in with my preferences and liking for Belgian style beers."
"Drinks well."
"D - I'd definitely buy it again, solid session beer, if you don't like coriander, this probably isn't for you."
"D- this one wouldnt impress the true connoisseurs of belgian style beers but its a decent attempt from an american brewer. id drink another sometime."
"D: Easy drink the only problem is 7.8% alc. which catches up to you but it is a Belgium Trippel, which I love."
"drinkablity i do like this brew a lot, and have had many 6 packs and bombers of it. for what i crave and the budget im on it really is a damn good beer"
"Nice golden pour with lots of frothy white head and sticky lacing. Fairly generic aroma of Belgian yeast, heavy with bread and banana. Taste was also pleasant, with plenty of banana, clove, and yeast; quick finish with a bit of lingering sweet malt. Nothing stood out in particular, but the Belgian style is captured well without becoming too heavy or sweet. Very drinkable without being particularly memorable."
"*** Note: The people giving this beer low marks here appear to be beer neophytes who don't/can't appreciate this unique style."
"I was disappointed in this offering. I shoulda just bought a few Westmalle Tripple. I guess I was expecting this to come somewhat close, but it wasn't even in the same ballpark."
"Our Trippel Belgian Style Ale (pronounced triple) opens with a bold blast of hops that slowly gives way to the fruity esters implied by our Belgian yeast strain. In the Belgian tradition of brewing singles, doubles and triples, Trippel is the strongest with the longest fermentation. Remarkably smooth and complex, our bottle-conditioned Trippel is spiced with a trace of coriander."
"Overall: For an American version, this is a great tripel. Overall it is spicy and lively where it needs to be, but still retains a malt base to keep things even. The alcohol could be more hidden, and the mouthfeel could be a tad smoother..."
"This is another good one from New Belgium. Not as mind-blowing as other triples but dang-near jaw-dropping when you consider the low price. Don't sleep on this one if you're a tripple/triple lover."
"I don't know if this really ""on style"" but for the price and complexity all I know is I love drinking this beer."
"Overall, very unimpressed, and disappointed in this beer. Full of flavor, which I dont mind, but the flavor just seems off to me."
"M/D: Lighter body. Medium to high carbonation. Very average. Drinkability is AVERAGE, the coriander is a little much."
"I'm usually pretty skeptical about ""belgian style ales"" in six packs, but this one is true to the style, a very quality beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium light with a fizzy amount of carbonation."
"Overall a decent mild Tripel."
"D: An easy drinking trippel, but certainly not one of the better ones. Worth a try. Nice offering from a quality brewery. Side note: I remember having this a few years back at the brewery (on tap) and it was much better (surprise, surprise). If I encounter this again on tap, will revise my review."
"Nice effervescence leaves the beer bouncing around the palate without being stingy."
"Pours a very deep golden-orange color with very little head. A very floral aroma with fruits and spiced hops, very complex. A crisp clean taste which is refreshing. A little bit of spice in the taste mixed with alcohol . Up front is sweet with a finish that is sort of biting from the hops. One of my favorites from New Belgium !, Actually one of my top ten!"
"D- Average, I suppose. For a beer without a lot happening, it's still refreshing and light and it doesn't taste bad. Compared to the Abbey, though, this ain't that great."
"drinkability - what i found is the closer the beer got to room temp the less i wanted to drink it - to me a triple is high abv but light - this beer has a lower abv and heavier mouthfeel/drinkability"
"D - Somewhat bland and one dimensional."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer that is extremely complex in flavor and meets all of the requirements of this beer style."
"D: Solid trippel that is high on flavor and even higher on drinkability. Mouthfeel makes this one go down really easily and even though its only 7.8%, the alcohol seems completely non-existent. Wouldn't go out of my way for this one but I'd reach for it when I could. Very enjoyable beer indeed and a solid interpretation of the style!!"
"Well, I'm not a fan of New Belgium to begin with but I thought I'd give them another try since it was 3.49 for this 22oz bottle. Not impressed at all. I don't think I'll even be able to finish the bottle. I'm really confused since I know that a lot of people like them nowadays, so am I getting bad bottles or something? Truly awful. The rest of the bottle is either going down the drain or serving as the base for a marinade. I take that back, it's going down the drain."
"D: A real nice tripel, definitely an American version, the complexity isn't huge, but I liked it."
"D: A nice drinkable tripel. Good flavors and mouthfeel."
"Overall, a good beer at a good price but don't expect miracles."
"Good job, New Belgium."
"D - I only had one, but wished I bought more."
"D: This could be a session beer - perhaps I'm too extreme but this beer is rather light on the palette."
"Slainte, but with something else."
"Overall - Drinkable, nice complexity. Alcohol is evident, but for the ABV is hidden somewhat in this beer."
"M/D - Silky, creamy feel with faint carbonation. Sticky on the lips. Alcohol warmth. It goes down easily but the alcohol definitely decreases drinkability."
"Poured into a goblet a deep golden yellow color with a finger and a half of white head that retained well and laced pretty well. Aromas were of banana, spicy and some alcohol. Taste was a bit grainy with some spice and the fruitiness. Feel was a slightly chewy medium bodied beer with some crispness. I enjoyed this beer very much as a beautiful local option for the style."
"Nice to keep a 6'er around for when you want a nice Belgian but don't feel like you want to concentrate on it too much that night..."
"D: Not as sweet as some triples, but not as complex either. Probably won't buy again. Not a bad beer except for maybe the aftertaste, but there are much better trippels out there. Still, a nice attempt at the style."
"pours a lighter golden color from the bottle with a small bubbly head, carbonation dances as bubbles rise in the glass. smell is good, has a slight skunkiness to it,not sure if this is an old beer or just a part of its aroma, regardless has that distinct yeasty aroma to it, almost has a grape aroma to it, its very unique. taste is great, just has an awesome flavor, the high carbonation of belgians i think are my favorite because it just dances on the tongue and i like it. mouthfeel and drinkabily are high."
"D- I found this to be pretty drinkable. There is a flavor that I can't describe. I'm not well versed with tripels, it may be a flavor that is a calling card of this style. Nice taste and light/medium body make it a rather nice brew with which to relax. My personal opinion is that the ABV is too high for a session."
"Appearance has a nice golden color with little head, but good lace. Smell has a good dose of spice with tangarine and banana. Taste involves spices, citrus and sweet malt in the end, the alchohol is there, but not overwhelming. mouthfeel is medium bodied with good viscosity and carbonation. I'd say a good go at the style and very drinkable."
"A very nice Belgian style trippel. Definitely going to pick these more often when I get a Belgian kick."
"i had the last half of this beer with some pumpkin pie and it went together excellently."
"D--Probably would not drink a ton of these, but certainly worth a try. Worthy effort by a solid brewery."
"Pours a clear, yellow color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of wheat, sweet malt, pale malt, slight hops, slight spice, earthy malt, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, earthy malt, yeast, slight sweet malt, citrus, slight spice, and slight grain. Overall, dominated by the earthy malt flavors (as is usual with NB beers)."
"D - This is quite a nice tripel for an American brewery. The abv is very sneaky in this one. I think this is perhaps one of New Belgium's best offerings."
"D- Definitely a beer that I could have a few of, especially being as being a pretty cheap brew (~$1 a 12oz bottle). Plus, at nearly 8% ABV, I will starting feeling warm quick!"
"Drinkability - Pleasant and light in the flavor department. A good beer with a very light flavor - Cheers!"
"I must say I'm not typically a fan of New Belgium brews; they usually have this toasty je ne sais quoi that I don't really like. This beer has a tiny bit of it, but overall it's damn good and, by far, easily my favorite New Belgium offering."
"Edit 2 minutes later: After reading Jason Alstrom's review, he conjures some of the flavors that I could not. It is growing on me as it warms and I understand it more fully. I stick to most my words in general though."
"D: I could see this being a staple beer at a party or something along that lines. In addition, this beer would be a great beer for taking those pisswater drinkers into the world of great beers."
"D-This beer drinks very well for such a big beer. I highly suggest this beer."
"I haven't seen many American brewers make any Belgian ales up to par. That being said this one isn't that offensive, but it is like a Tripel -light. Very Drinkable but not the most tasty tripel."
"Pours a pale gold color with a small head with poor retention. Smells of cloves, bananas, citrus, and some sweet malt. The taste is the same as the smell. There is a lot of carbonation, and a light body. Not what I would normally expect a Trippel to taste like, but still pretty good, with decent to good drinkability."
"Pale golden in color with aromas of clove, bananas, and light bready malts. Taste is slightly under medium bodied/moderately carbonated with a faint banana and clove presence, very nice toasted/biscuit malts, subtle use of noble hops, and a short sweet finish. Very drinkable."
"Clean mouthfeel, with lingering aftertaste, after reviewing this beer, I'm going to the fridge to crack open another one. Very drinkable! and I look forward to trying more from this style."
"it has a light body, smooth with a bit more than average carbonation. but i poured it slow so that might be why"
"D-Moderate. I was overall not too impressed, but that's my opinion. I think this could be a very accessible representation of this style and a good brew with which to introduce a person to Belgian-style ales. Although it isn't fantastic, it's also not overwhelming."
"It has a nice brass color with not much head but what little bit of head it does have there is a good bit of staying power. There are a lot of tiny bubbles in the body. It has beany aroma. It has a candy like taste at first, then some mild hops. The aftertaste is fruity. I thought it was weak for a trippel."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Heavy carbonation and very crisp. Comes off very dry. I was surprised by this because I never expect much from American versions of Belgian style beers."
"I'd give it a go after tweaking, and when/if they get it right, this could become a regular for me when I'm craving a Belgian beer. It's not there yet, but I remain hopeful."
"Drinkability: Very nice. A better hop selection might aid this as well as notching the grain bill down a few ounces."
"cant really appreciate the taste here. I may have to find another to see if I got a bad bottle.- in which case I'll re-review. Based on the merits of this sample I am definitley moving on to another brew. In fact I may just leave this one unfinished..."
"This would be a nice introductory beer for people who aren't familiar with Belgian tripels. It offers a pretty good bang for your buck, and after trying this and finding it enjoyable a person might want to move up into the big leagues so to speak and try a true Belgian tripel. I'd have this one again, but only if I found myself short on money but with a big hankering for a tripel style beer."
"Drinkability: As I mentioned above, I think I like this more than I should. There's something about this beer that comes together reasonably well. It's traditional in many ways, though also diverges from the stereotypical trippel in a number of ways both good and bad. At 7.8%, though, it's also less alcoholic than many trippels, which does enhance the drinkability somewhat. A solid beer, and one I'd be glad to have again."
"Good Tripel, in my opinion one of the better offerings from New Belgium."
"D - Refreshing and delicious."
"Not a huge fan of the style but I definately enjoyed this brew, no complaints."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into my Chimay chalice, beer is a pale golden color with a sparkling white head comprised of many fine bubbles. Nose is fairly underwhelming, a light fruitiness and some spicy, banana phenols and hints of fusel alcohol. The taste has a general smoothness about it; starts out neutral and transitions to a mild fruity malt sweetness - pears and white grapes - and then moves to a mild bitterness and alcohol bite. Finishes neutral and a slightly sweet, warming alcohol sensation remains. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fine beaded carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a decent tripel, not outstanding but decent. Goes down smooth and at 7.8%, should be respected."
"Notes: this doesn't hold a candle to le fin or karmeleit or ommegang or countless other tripels, hence the B grade but... For $7.49 a six pack, this is a damn good beer!"
"D: I was quite suprised by this tripel. Karmeliet is one of my go to tripels and Flat Earth's Bermuda Triangle is probably my favorite. This is definitely number 3 right now. I like the fact that the yeast isn't overpowering. This is mainly my preference however. I will definitely buy this again."
"D - easy to session despite relatively high abv. this beer is a no brainer for the price/style. why are you still reading this?? go get one!"
"D'ability - Light tasting, but alcohol character a bit too prominent for the style and for drinkability."
"Drinkability: decent tripel but fell a bit short for me. After the glass was emptied I didn't want another."
"Drinkability - New Belgium creates another winner in Fort Collins! Great example of the style."
"It appears a warm shade of gold that is clear like apple juice. I'm a little disappointed that the initial head has dissipated to almost nothing, leaving behind at least some lacing. Apple and spice (coriander, pepper?) on the nose. The flavor of this beer is the star, featuring apple, pear, peach, banana, tropical fruits, honeysuckle, pepper, and clove. The alcohol is sensed but not unwelcome in this sipper. Carbonation is a little low, this one asserts itself with full body and a long, dry finish. I could certainly have another."
"Crisp hops, some fruity esters: tropical, bananans and a honey sweetness. Good full mouthfeel, not lacking in that department, for sure. The alcohol is at a happy place and this is a very well-balanced brew."
"A bit more ""dense"" than other tripples, not in a bad way, just different. Easy to drink, the alcohol is well covered, finishing the 6 wil lbe enjoyable..and done fairly quickly"
"D: I have been having a hard time with any Belgian brews lately. Not sure what the deal is? But, I find this one drinkable and in the average category. I could see this as a good introductory beer into the Belgian style for the non-Belgian lover with its typical Americanized flavors"
"not as good as i would expect."
"Overall, it's still a bit too fizzy for me, but it is an above par Tripel"
"pours a golden color with a small head and an ok lacing not reminiscent of a belgian trippel ..the smell is nutty, and bready with some sweet fruit some clove and cinnamon..the taste is nutty and fruity some bananas its also malty and roasty just the same as the smel not a true trippel l...its easy to drink the 7.8 abv is well hidden... this is a typical offering from new belgium all brews are good just not impressive..they kinda all taste the same with a little variation to each style"
"D: Not too bad."
"This drinks well for style. Lower alcohol helps, but so does tamed sweetness and overall balancing of flavors. There is no issue with drinking a second bottle."
"Thanks to my friend Jacob for sharing this. Right off the bat, I'm wondering what's up with all the banana in this beer. It reminds me more of a non-yeasty hefeweizen, weird. The malt is very smooth and pale, and the beer on a whole is quite drinkable, I'm just not sure what's going on. This is certainly not your average tripel... And possibly not a tripel."
"Overall: Pretty good drinkability. The flavors are not overpowering nice sweetness with some fruity and nutty characteristics. The feel is a bit bubblier than I prefer, but still a good beer overall."
"D: Hells yes. Oh how I have missed this beer. Smooth, clear, flavorful with a little bit of spice. I wish I could get it regularly. Perhaps I scored it a little higher than the average (not sure, I have been trying to avoid seeing the scores until after I review.) But this is a beer that will always be one of my favorites, and the beer that got me into Belgians. Between this and Abbey from NBB, you can't loose."
"Drinks pretty easy, was hoping for a bit more flavor to the beer, but its not too bad otherwise."
"Overall, not something that impressed me very much. Many better tripels out there. There just wasn't a lot of flavor. I won't buy this again."
"D: it's a bit too much flavor for me at the moment"
"Drinkability: I'm not really a tripel guy (could you tell?). This seems like a pretty good ale, though I do feel it's a little too centered around the alcohol flavors; feels kind of raw. Gets smoother and sweeter as the session progresses."
"sweet and fruity and high abv!!! poured into a schnifter it has a golden color and a light head with no lacing. for a readily available cheap beer that has a high abv this beer is great. not anything to brag about but worth a spot in the fridge. good session beer too"
"Overall, it wasnt bad for a New Belgium(not the best brewery in Colorado BY FAR!) but bad for Trippels in general. I was a bit disappointed."
"Good drinkable tripel, flavorful, easy to find and pleasant to the last drop."
"D: I'd recommend this to someone if they were looking for a tripel!"
"This is something different, I've never had a trippel like this. Not bad, but different."
"Overall this is pretty good, still havent had a lot experience with teh trippel style, so maybe i was expecting more of a dubbel that was just a bit stronger...not quite a bit stronger. but at any rate, still a good brew, I just couldnt drink bu 1 or 2 of these."
"D=This is nearly 8%, but I have been drinking it all evening."
"D= Very drinkable for an 8.5% abv ale. Unfortunately in the world of Belgian tripels, this one is just in the middle of the pack. Still a solid and worthy choice though."
"Poured in a tumbler, nice caramel color with a red tinge. Head was moderately frothy about a two fingers with some lacing. Kind of fruity on the nose with a hint of spice. Not as full and rich as i expect a triple to be but it was nice and malty, with that nice Belgian yeast initial taste. Bit of alcohol in the after taste. Overall it's ok, not the best, not the worst. They do in fact go down pretty easy."
"Given its price (about $8 a 6-pack) and availability I buy this one pretty often. It is only a step below the best Belgian tripels and I'd recommend it highly to anyone that likes the style. So drinkable as well which some of even the better Belgians lack due to the overwhelming flavors. This one excels on so many levels."
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Pours a clear orange brown, darker than I expect for the style. Lacing disappears quickly. Smells of pureed bananas, ethanol, fruity malt. Spicy, strong flavor. Fruity ethanol on a nice malt base. Banana-y esters and other yeasty notes. Actually tastes more alcoholic than it actually is. Medium to full bodied, slightly creamy. Drinks well, no way to know this isn't a Belgian-brewed beer that's been a staple on the continent for centuries."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is a mere quarter inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of citrus, barnyard, and New Belgium's signature malted garbage smell. Whereas the malted garbage is in the background of the aroma, it dominates the taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, I'm running out of new ways to describe my distant for the new Belgium malt character. I should probably stop trying their beers, because I have yet to like them."
"This is probably my favorite year-round New Belgium beer. This and the dubbel are their bread and butter in my opinion."
"D= Decent. Pretty average Trippel if you ask me. The way it covers my tongue is enjoyable though."
"D - I will have to try this again after I learn more about the style and have tasted more example. Unfortunely for now, not a favorite from NBB."
"Easy enough to drink and a good beginners intro to the style."
"D--Very. It even gets better as it sits in the glass and warms a tad."
"Overall, a good addition to the brewery who brought us Fat Tire."
"Feels medium-bodied, not cloying at all -- pretty drinkable beer. I liked it."
"I found this to be a very disappointing bottle. Would not revisit based on the vegetal aftertaste."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip, clear golden color, large white head that had nice retention and left some chunky lacing. Smell is wonderful. This is as close to true Belgian tripel that I've across this side of the pond. Lots of pale malt, light fruits, light funk, sugar and Belgian yeast all make their presence known in the nose. Taste is full of candied fruits, a nice hoppy bitterness, yeastiness, a little funk that was around in the nose, and some boozy warmth. It's not overly complex, but it's very tasty. Mouthfeeel is on the low end of medium and there is hardly any carbonation, which seems to be the only thing it's missing. Belgian style tripels should be effervescent, and this sadly is not. Nevertheless, it tastes great and is very drinkable for the high ABV. Nice work."
"Mouthfeel is good and it's drinkable but really only has me wanting a more substantial example of this style. With no disrespect to NB I wish I hadn't sullied the Westmalle glass."
"Very disappointed, and I hate to report it. This is a 2009 bottled. Pours nicely; golden yellow true to type. Lacy head skims the top. Carbonation quite high, higher than for the genre, lending a lighter-bodied mouth-feel. What's so disappointing? For one, smell: none except a hint of vegetal, not fresh cut grass or flower stems but perhaps, several day old cut Carnation stems. Flavor totally lacks any yeastiness and doughiness, the principal reason why I love trippels. Instead, there's some sort of vegetal, metallic (or is it alkaline--the word itself suggests what I'm reaching for) base underpinning this strangely bitter lageri-sh tasting ale: the greeny parts of asparagus or artichokes followed by what amounts to (in my recall--those days are over) sour mash. That this is a great brewery with its politics naturally and concomitantly bound up with its fabulous products and facilities makes it really hard to censure any product. This is the second failure I've tasted in Lincoln. Perhaps Lincoln stores do not know how to store product or perhaps the runts of the litter end up here, given that most tastebuds here lean to the Bud and Miller and even more, Keystone interpretations of beer. I can't quite reason through this glaring failure of beermaking."
"Light honey amber with some visable suspended yeast.Decent rocky white head that lasts and leaves decent rings of lace down the glass. Smells like fruity belgian yeast and citrus fruits. Caramel and toasted bread with a hit of candy sugar and sour yeast in the finish. Medium light bodied and well carbonated. Highly drinkable version of the style."
"Pours a clear golden color with one inch of white head that had decent retention. Sufficient amount of lacing is left on the glass for a tripel. Has a surprisingly malty aroma. The lack of esters from the yeast differentiates this from the rest of the sytle. The taste is malt driven as well. Some spice comes into play. Finishes with a wisp of alcohol. Also has a lingering sweetness. I prefer my tripels on the dry side. Has a creamy mouthfeel and medium bodied. A tripel that is easy on the pocketbook and is a bargain. Unfortunately it cannot compete with the better imported tripels."
"D - An easy drinking beer that I would certainly drink over and over again. Even if it tastes like an amber."
"This one could get me in trouble it is one of the eaisest drinking triples I have ever had and would love have a few in a sitting."
"EDIT: as it warms, this beer takes on a different character. Flavors open up, smell does too. I guess this is normal, but, wow, big difference."
"mouth is a bit too carbonated but helps support the bittering hops. leaves the mouth a bit dry and longing for another sip. This is truly a superb tripel for being so mass-distributed."
"12oz bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a clear pale gold with lots of head. Spicy aroma with more clove than banana. A bit of burnt sugar and a little noble hop aroma. Medium bodied with some sweetness. Banana fruitiness. Plenty of carbonation. Aroma is nice, but it seems a little thin. Pretty drinkable for the ABV. Nice price."
"Not a bad brew, overall. Its very comparable with a lot of the higher-end barley wines but at a reasonable cost, and in a convenient six pack. The alcohol content, coupled with the good flavor is nice as well."
"Near transparent golden with a finger of white, creamy head that retains and leaves beautiful lace in the glass. Balance between deep malts and fruits in the aroma gives me an impression that the taste will be balanced as well. And indeed, it is. Roasty malt flavors that finish with florals, fruits and bitter left on the palate. Crisp carbonation, while medium to heavy-bodied in moments. This beer is great to sip on after dinner."
"Overall a nice beer. I will definitely purchase again."
"Good complex brew that is one of my top six rated active bottled beers for style."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I personally probably would get tired of it after two."
"Not sure what it is that bothers me about this beer...aha! The culprit seems to be this odd peanut butter flavor and smell. Not fruity and zesty enough for me. I wanted to like this beer, as tripels are one of my favorite styles and this one is nicely priced, but I just cant dig it. It's drinkable, but not lip-smackingly good. Might make a good intro tripel."
"Bottle - poured into Stella Artois glass. Heady, very nice with 1 1/2 "" head. Medium amber color. Pleasing smell, very noticeable fruit/spice flavors. Let sit for a few minutes until head down to less than 1/4", also to let warm to mid 40-degrees. Taste - definite hint of spice, floral notes abound. Enjoyable and worth the price! I'd buy another 6-pack or would gladly try on tap. Great beer for the money (under $7 a six-pack). SALUDE!"
"Overall the taste of alcohol is a little strong for me. Not enough hops and kinda malty. Disappointing offering from New Belgium."
"D_Fantastic. The alcohol is masked very well. High repeatability"
"Not only is this a very easy drinking beer, it's also exceptionally well priced for such a good beer. I find it every once and a while on sale for under $7 a six pack. A steal, considering the quality of this brew... definitely one of New Belgium's best efforts. My only criticism of drinkability for this beer is that its flavors don't pair well with many types of foods, in my opinion. Still, this one was well enjoyed on its own."
"Golden, clear, with a creamy white head on top. Maybe a blob of orange color in that body. When I semlled the beer, I thought this was liquid bubblegum. I could live with that, but too monotone for what I expected. Same with the taste. Lots of bubblegum flavor in this beer, but that's all I tasted. Ok, so a hint of peach emerged, but nothing else. Thin mouthfeel, nill carbonation. Could it have been a bad keg I got this from? Well, it didn't have any off-flavors, which made this sort of drinkable, especially with my BBQ chicken pizza. But overall, this was way too monotone."
"Drinkability: Overall, a good representative of the style and a beer I would love to have again. Cheaper than lots of the Belgian beers of the same style, but right on par."
"Poured into sturdy chalice. Leaves a medium head with light-to- faint lacing. A dark straw leaning towards gold color. Faint spice and citrus aroma. Not as spicy or citrusy as others of the style. Taste is not overly distinctive. Lingering stickiness on the back of the tongue. Drinkability is OK, not as smooth as others of the style. That said it would be easy to quaff several of these at a gathering. This would be good to use as a ""training wheel"" beer to introduce others to the style."
"Yet another success from New Belgium."
"Finish: Slightly acidic well rounded with a good finish"
"This is a very good beer. Pour is light gold with some carbonation. Aroma is sweet and light. Understated taste. The hops and yeast mix nicely, with mild fruit and malt flavors. Almost like a ""Lite"" version of other stronger trippels. Subtle."
"This beer could get you in trouble, The big ABV is almost completely undetectable in this brew, however it could easily be drunk all night without losing the taste for it."
"150 in the books. Woo."
"D- Drinks great at a cool temperature"
"Out of a six pack this beer was a cloudy peach/amber color with a large off-white head two fingers thick. Modest retention and it left some equal lacing. The aroma was rather decadent, spicy, yeast, fruity and complex. The flavors were well balanced, a quick shot of fruit up-front soon followed by the taut yeast, caramel malt and some hints of coriander and cloves. Nicely organized and the alcohol was hard to find (good for 7.8%!). The mouthfeel was semi-creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation good. A fine example of the style being produced on this side of the pond."
"""Deceptively simple"" is how I'd describe this one overall. I wouldn't have even though it was an ale if you poured it for me w/o me seeing the label. Could see it as a regular."
"Has a nice strong aroma of hops and and spices. Some fruitiness too. Has a smooth palate with a flavorful taste. Orange peel and sweet spices are present. Fruitiness present in the flavor too. Very good."
"Pours a clear golden color, smallish sturdy white head fades pretty quickly, leaves some stray spots of lacing behind. Lots of fruity aromas, faint trace of banana, some sugary sweetness, but lots and lots of tropical fruit. Some apple flavors, some peppery spiciness, gentle bitterness on the back end. Cleansing moutfheel, some spice on the lips, faint warming alcohol. This is fantastic."
"The body is a bit sweet but ok. Carbonation is light but good. Overall a good triple but I would like a bit more complexity overall. Just don't call it trip-el."
"The appearance is a cloudy golden color not too big of a head. Very active bubbles still. Smell isnt super great but smells a little citrusy but not like a pale or an IPA. It's a smeel I'm not used too. The taste is unique too I'm not sure how to explain it either. This beer does feel good on the tounge. I will probably drink this again but it's just not what I'm used too."
"My first New Belgium brew. I know, you say no Fat Tire? Fuck it, I'm going for the Tripel first. Pours reddish orange with a two-finger off white head that disappears rather quickly. There's a smattering of lacing left around the glass. The smell is deep and complex with notes of vanilla, sweet bread, spice, grapes, oranges, apples and yeast. Tastes of tart apples, sugar cane, butterscotch candy and bread. Wrapped around all of that is some spice and honey. Deep down below it all lies some hops. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied and rich and creamy; almost to perfection. There's a good combustion of bubbles with a decent shake. It's hard to beat a true Belgian Tripel, but this one gives them all a run for their money."
"It's an impressive brew on the whole. Quite possibly the perfect introduction to Tripels, as it has all of the exemplary characteristics and nothing funky or unwelcome. At the same time, there are definite better and more complex Tripels out there... this one's nothing amazing, but a good and solid brew at a decent price."
"Golden with light amber. Creamy white head and steady carbonation, never falling to a ring. Smell is nice. Sweet malts. Some fruit and candy sugar with yeast being fairly present as well. Light spice. Earthy, grassy hops linger underneath. Taste is all of the above plus a noticeable alcohol presence. It seems a bit more spicy than the nose. Clove seems apparent. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, crisp and snappy on the tongue. A bit drying in the finish. I didn't think this one was too bad, got through the bottle without much fuss. That's not to say I'd have another to follow it, though."
"D. Although it has a high ABV, this is an excellent brew to nurse."
"This would be a good drinkable beer since its cheap. I would prefer real Belgian tripels though."
"Not the best tripel ever but I also see why New Belgium get alot of hype. A nice solid tripel."
"Very ho-hum, I am not crazy about it."
"D - Good Sitting around beer to enjoy with company."
"New Belgium does good, again."
"Mike"
"The taste is more of the same, malty and spicy, with some sweetness and then some bitter kick from the hops. All in one sip. This is a very drinkable brew, I'm impressed."
"Not really an instant favorite in my book but it slowly grew on me."
"Special thanks to jhammerly for sending this one as an extra in our trade. I have had it on standby for quite some time."
"For the light flavor it has it is really quite tasty. Another quality offering from New Belgium."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Easy consumption on this one due to decent flavors and well hidden alcohol. I'm more impressed than I thought I would be."
"Strong citrus flavors. Hops (saaz) noticeable on finish. What is most dissapointing is the overwhelming alcohol flavor. I know the abv is high, but there is not enough malt/hops/citrus to be more noticeable than the alcohol. Average beer thanks to tasting smooth and being very drinkable. So a drinkable beer, but not overly flavorful."
"Beautiful golden pour with an aggressive head. Great lacing. Floral aroma of cloves and light fruit. Smooth hops hit the tongue along with fruity esters and a touch of coriander. Lively mouthfeel that finishes incredibly smoothly. This is a good tripel, but it lacks character. It's very smooth and pleasing to drink, but there is little complexity to be found when compared to its older Belgian brothers. I found myself bored halfway through the bottle. Overall, a solid American tripel, but not quite at the level of Allagash."
"A huge rocky fluffy off white head is achieved with a strong pour. Very good resilance and tons of fat lace. Body is a honey glowing amber. Nose is very yeasty with waxey fruit notes, also some vanilla. Enters the mouth very smooth and creamy almost like malt liquer meets a lager. A slight dose of spice is there and on the dusty side. Carbonation is high in this one for the style. A doughy, sappy feel on the mouth with a bit of hops at the end. Not incredible but nicely drinkable. I would not pass on this one."
"Overall- An incredible beer. Maybe not the best trippel I have ever had but ranks at the top. Once again here is the part where I say- Wish we could get this Louisiana. Hey New Belgium, if you reading this please start distributing in our state!!"
"D: Decent example, quite dry. Not sure if I'd like to have more than one."
"Average head, with golden tan color and a little haze. Very strong, good aroma, mostly grain and yeast, with a bit of fruit. Flavor is also excellent; sweet with some fruit and alcohol, and hops in the finish. Smooth, full mouthfeel with average carbonation. Solid beer all around, very drinkable."
"Best thing about New Belgium may well be their bottles. Nice design, yes. But all their brews appear identical in a six pack, allowing a certain amount of comingling without raising awareness at checkout."
"Another great find from a trade and a first for me from the New Belgium lineup. I am still getting used to Trippels as a style but this bodes well. It reminds me of Duvel in the fact that there is a strong fruit taste that helps ease the strength of the alcohol flavor. Very pleasant to drink, not bitter at all and it is that combination that could prove dangerous. I am glad that I was able to try it and would certainly get this again when available. However if given the choice I would probably get a strong pale ale over a Trippel but this is a smooth very drinkable Trippel."
"a winning beer from a solid brewery."
"D: I remember liking this tripel and considering it to be one of the better 'Belgian' beers that NBBC makes...it's pretty well-crafted, though I don't love it enough to place it with the best of the style. Worth drinking on occasion and a good effort."
"D: 7.8% ABV, so this is more of a sipper. More than one or two and you can call it a night."
"good beer for the very low price."
"D: I have to be in the right mood for this. Makes a good night cap."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"This is a good beer from New Belgium. I poured from a bottle into a glass. I poured a beautiful golden amber color with a nice frothy one finger foam. The smell was little weak, but had a bready aroma. The taste was very good and was relatively complex. I detected citrus flavors, along with a yeasty flavor. Very low hops taste at the end. This was good bodied beer and was very drinkable, although I could not drink many due to the complexity of the taste. Overall, a very good beer."
"I could drink this stuff everyday. It's so smooth and so well balanced and multilayered, that you can't put this stuff down. I'll buy again, and again,...."
"All in all, this a damn good trippel style beer. Does this beer match a real Belgian trippel? Not quite, but it is still a very good, session beer, that is a great Belgian brew for somebody like myself, who has limited experience with this style. Plus, the price is a fraction of what you will pay for a true Belgian, and regardless of price, this one comes damn close to the real deal."
"The mouthfeel however is delightful. A light-medium body with very rich carbonation is exactly what I wanted, and exactly what this delivers. Combine that with high drinkability and this is a solid american made triple."
"I tried it but not one of my favorites"
"I finally got to have this beer again as I visited Nebraska. The NB Trippel isn't distributed here (yet?) in MN. I remembered really liking this beer back before I got deeply into hops. It didn't disappoint, I still enjoyed it quite a bit. If it ever comes up here I doubt it will be $6.99 for a sixer like in NE though!"
" Aroma of sweet pale malt, some candi sugar, and a good bit of spicy Belgian yeast., with a hint of coriander and black pepper. Palate is mildly sweet up front, with pale malt, yeasty Belgian funk, and a touch of peppery spiciness. Finish is a bit dry and spicy. The body is not quite as full or sticky as I look for in a tripel, but still manages to convey the flavor pretty well. Carbonation is a bit lacking, in that it doesn't impart the right amount of creaminess. Still, overall, the flavor and aroma are quite good, and this is an excellent value selection given the current increase in the prices of Belgian imports."
"Much better taste and the aroma is better too. Flavor is much maltier with a delicate sweetness and notes of coriander and spice. Banana is bigger with bits of Belgian funk and a touch of light fruits. Firm hops give a great finish. Still dry with a graininess in the feel that makes it superbly quenching and drinkable."
"I'm surprised by how palatable this is. I was expecting to be turned off by the typical Belgian banana flavor, but it's got a good spice and bite which keeps me going. I'm enjoying it, but one is plenty."
"D - Pretty good. I've had before and I willingly bought the 6. That says a lot. It isn't a great brew, but it is a decent tripel that is both refreshing and enjoyable. One of the few tripels that I would never hesitate to drink with others - from the bottle even. It is a tripel for the every man."
"Drinkability-This would be a tripel to drink on a hot day, but I'd probably look for something else if I wanted more flavor. Not a bad tripel, but not a great one."
"Drinkability: The clear strength - hides alcohol very well."
"Pours a nice head with some lacing. Looks good to me. The smell is...work with me here...peanut butter. I'm sure if I was educated I'd use words like ""phenols"". But it smells like peanut butter this this poor, ignorant southerner. Also some nice floral notes and a malty caramel note. And peanut butter. The taste is pepper, light hops, peanut butter (of course) and a really nice finish that is crisp and just dry enough to balance the sweet malt. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a bit thin. The drinkability is great, with the alcohol just peeking 'round the edges. The edges of the peanut butter. In general, not bad but maybe I'm just too spoiled by the originals. An approchabal beer, maybe its sort of a ""beginner"" tripel."
"D - Interesting beer. Probably the strongest light colored ale I've had, flavor and scent wise. Very flavorful. Quite an enjoyable shock to the senses. Recommended."
"Drinkability was good, easy to get down and enjoyable. Not as good as most other tripels out there, but still good."
"Drinkability - Nice to drink, good flavors but the flavors and body make it much nicer to drink slowly."
"D - This is a nice tripel. I've really found that no American Belgian-style ale really lives up to the real thing, but this is a good approximation."
"Pours a golden color with a slight white head. Smells sweet with a hint of hops. You smell the alcohol more than the hops. Sweet and strong in taste with a large variety of tastes mixed in for pleasure. Tart and crunchy. Light and drinkable... with a punch. I love this beer. When I buy it I usually hold on to it for a bit so that it conditions. I highly recommend. Seek out one of NBB's best beers."
"Probably one of the most unique tripels I've had, but certainly not the king of all tripels. I would love to try this in different settings, in different serving types (tap, aged, etc.). Another New Belgium beer that impresses but fails to be paradigm-shifting. With a name like New Belgium, maybe I'm expecting too much?"
"Drinkability - easy drinking, well balanced, had it slow just because"
"D: One was enough, a sipper and a slow one at that, but a good beer to relax with. Fit the scene of the coffee shop very well."
"Pours a light gold in color with a medium head that dissipates quickly, but leaves a long lasting ""belgian lace"" that hangs around , and around, and around. The aroma is more sweet than spicy, and I get a definite hop aroma from the Saaz hops they use. On first taste, the peppery spice you expect from the aroma is there, but not as prominant as in other examples of the style. Very crisp and dry. The body of this beer is a little lighter than I expected, but still well within the style guidelines for a tripel. No apparent alcohol warmth in this one, and the carbonation is high. This one could easily sneak up on you, it is way too easy to drink. Maybe I'll just have one more..."
"Good medium body and carbonation for the flavor profile. Good example of a triple, well balanced and drinkable."
"D - Not as good as the smell or the appearance. Little alcohol feel is a plus. The bittering hops were a bit much in this beer and would not recommend for Belgian enthusiasts. If the brewer at New Belgium either dry-hopped or reduced the hop content during the bitter wort, would work better."
"This is a tasty, easy drinking and pretty striaghtforward tripel. Nothing surprising here, just a well crafted brew. Very nice."
"D- Not an everyday brew."
"D - At 8% ABV, I can't even tell. I could easily drink several of these in one sitting and get hammered w/o evening realizing it. At first the biscuit-ness kinda threw me off but it's really starting to work for me now. One of the better offerings from NB imo. Not quite the sipping beer you would think - I would say more on the session side!"
"Poured from bottle into oversized wine glass (pretentious huh?). Pours crystal-clear light gold with nice two finger, somewhat rocky head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is biscuity and bread-like with some yeast. Taste is somewhat bland, fruit is present with pear being the one that sticks out. Light grassy hops and a bit of an alcohol bite to it as it goes down. Very light and crisp, somewhat high carbonation. Overall not a bad beer at all, my only complaint is that everything seems somewhat muted, nothing really stands out."
"Good beer! Had this a few years ago before I knew exactly what it was...decided to revist New Belgium beers a couple months ago and this has been one of the better decisions in my tasting experiences(life). Mind ye I have never had a Trappist Dubbel or Tripel...only Chimay Blue so I don't have much to compare on yet!...Stay tuned..."
"A clear gold with a sizeable white head. Not what I would expect a tripel to look like at all. Nose is mute. Mild hop notes. Very little hitting me off of it. Flavor is very smooth. I can tell this is not of Belgian origin, but at the same time I can tell that it is made by someone who is committed. Sweet edge. Flavor ride doesn't last long. Feel is good. Smooth and even. Highly drinkable. I wouldn't normally consider a tripel to be a session-worthy brew, but this one is worth having more than one of. Not the type to have one bottle of and dwell on. It is more the style to grab a six pack of and drink in one sitting."
"Simply OK. I buy the NB Trippel quite a few times a year, IF I am getting a mixer of NB brews.. but otherwise, I only pick it up if I am doing a triple flight... not bad.. just ""could be alot better."""
"A good introduction to Belgium Tripples, but I have had better. It lacks some depth, but overall this is a good beer by New Belgium. Give it a try."
"Overall: a very nice, low cost, easy to find daily drinker."
"Really a good beer, but for me, one at a time, not only because of the abv, but also because of the heavy, rich flavors."
"Nice bubbly feel that soothes the mouth."
"Poured out of a bottle to lovely golden color, very nice creamy white head that lasts for quite a while. sour grassy smells, some bitter orange smells coming through, lots of yeast smells, hoppy aromas. taste is great, bitterness, orange, yeast, dough, long finsish, very sweet brew. The mouthfeel is suprisingly creamy and rich given it's light appearance, but thats the trippel way! I really enjoyed drinking this beer, this was my first from New Belgium and I look foward to more."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into my NBB glass. It was a clear light golden color. It had a small white head that quickly dissipated into a thin collar. No lacing and little carb. The aroma was spicy and fruity with some hops. The taste followed the aroma but with more of a hop presence. I'd had this a couple years ago and remember really liking it so not sure if something wrong with my bottle or if I just moved on. Will need to try again. Overall, as is, it's just OK with better tripels out there. (3.5, OIE, ML, N)"
"Kinda hit-or-miss with the small beers from the brewery, no consolence from the irratic scores given to this brew. The pour brings a bright gold color with some straw highlights and a mild haze. Abundantly carbonated with a well-formed head that faded quickly and shows very little lacing. The aromas are very fruity (pears, peaches, appricots, oranges, apples) and moderately spicy (corriander, pepper, esters). Flavors bring about much more sweetness and less spicy character than exhibited in most trippels, but with a lighter than normal body, makes the beer quite easy to drink. Alcohols are present but muted, underneath a honey-like sweet flavor. Good beer, but understandably rated low if dryer versions are prefered; and higher if sweetness is preferred."
"Very impressive, a nice american made belgian style."
"Drank this with an italian pasta dish actually and was pleasantly surprised."
"Overall, one of the better Tripels I've had. I've not really been a fan of the style in the past, but this went a long way toward fixing that."
"Recommended"
"Not a bad brew. The nose is a little more floral than fruity unlike some of my favorite tripels. The taste is okay but not great. It's not as sweet and the belgian yeast is not as strong. Also, this one has a fairly low ABV for the style. But, on the flip side, it's really inexpensive and you can get it most places in Colorado. You can pick up a six pack for $6.99 just about any liquor store. Good, drinkable beer for very little money. Not bad. Oh, it also definitely beats the crap out of Fat Tire. I know, comparing apples to oranges but seriously, Fat Tire is way over-rated and when this beer is usually sitting in the cooler right next to Fat Tire, why on earth would someone go for the Fat Tire? But it happens all the time. Oh well. :)"
"First Trippel I've had. Alcohol is noticable in the inital smell, along with some light flowery smells. Taste changes as the beer warms. Initially the alcohol was evident, but as it warms, that disappears completely, and things get lighter and more complex, with a banana-like flavor. A pleasant light blend of flavors. Very smooth and drinkable."
"Overall - Aside from the look of this ale, this is a solid belgian. Marks down on the appearance due to being to clear (I like chill haze and unfiltered beers.) and to having almost no head."
"Overall, not a bad Americanized Tripel."
"Comment  This is a beer you can enjoy without feeling too light in the wallet at the end of the night."
"The medium to full body is perfectly matched to the overall smoothness. The touch of bittering in the aftertaste dissipates to a clean dry finish. New Belgium is fast becoming my favorite domestic. Well done! (Note: before submitting I see many are getting a big hop profile and other characters that I am not. The freshness date on mine does not indicate a stale bottle, but I will check this brew again. Either way, this one I loved!)"
"Belgian yeast phenolics backed by light spices. Body and flavor enhanced by sweet cotton candy and pilsner malts. Moderateratly attenuated for style but showing no alcohol except by effects. To have these four in their own glasses and to dance between them is to understand the genius of N.B.brewmasters and their supporting staff."
"This beer will always have a warm spot in my heart because it was my introduction to Belgian brews and still is very satisfying."
"D- This is a very good warm weather beer. A pleasure to drink and a good way to get your Belgian fix if you are looking for something lighter. Also, this was a pretty good bang for my buck- $8.50 a 6 pack for a 8.5% beer, not too shabby."
"Drinkability: This is an above average tripel but does not exceed standards tremendously. Would be nice with some fresh summer herbs out of the garden on a bruschetta or a tomato napolean with pesto drizzle."
"A decent beer. In my opinion, not as tastey as the Dubbell, but a decent beer. Maybe too much carbonation and cloying. ABV seems pretty well hidden in the taste but there is a definte warming effect as my ears and cheeks are now a rose' color."
"My wife and I were visiting family in our old hometown of Ft Collins and I had to have some of the New Belgium beers I can't get back east. The trippel was the first one...This is a tasty trippel. A nice creamy white head on top of a golden colored beer was a good start. The smell was classic trippel with a slightly sweet overtone. The taste was right in line with the typical belgian yeast flavor followed by a slightly sweet citrus. Carbonation was good and mouthfeel was right on with a medium body. This is a highly drinkable beer."
"Mouth: Enters mostly tart and fruity, but the nut flavor is still lingering. Flavors aren't really held together very well, a sweet yet tart fruit flavor finishes a bit too sweet. Almost like buttered popcorn. No depth really, everything is right up front. Gets quite warm for something that, on the bottle at least, is listed at 7.8%. Not my favorite example of the style. Peaches, cream, pepper corns. Mouthfeel is nice and sparkly. Have a 6 pack, it won't be a chore to finish, but I'd trade it for a 750 of a Belgian trippel if i could."
"Cheers."
"Apperaance is a light honey colour -- crystal clear with a fluffy head and light lacing. It's almost like a Victory Golden Monkey -- but not quite as tasty. It needs a bit more rounding out. This could either be due to yeast, temp, or time. I dunno."
"D - A noticeably strong and dry ale, spicy, yet smooth and light for the style. A good american interpetation - light and potent, nutty smooth and peppery."
"Pours crystal clear gold with strong blonde tones. Big, foamy, bubbly, white head; dies down at a medium pace leaving a fair amount of lacing. Aroma is light and fruity (banana) with some sweet doughy notes. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and tingly  very drinkable. Flavor matches aroma: banana, esters, and floral hints, all backed by a balance of sweet bread / cookie malts and gentle hops. Strongly accented by spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, cilantro. Finish is spicy and a touch sour; aftertaste is clean and sweet."
"A bit of creaminess combined with the hair thing, and I couldn't drink the last 1/8 of it."
"12 oz bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter. The color was bright yellow and oh so clear. There was a short white head on top. The smell was really strong and was banana-like and estery. The taste followed suit with banana and spice. This beer was very easy to drink despite the 7.8% alcohol listed on the bottle. Good stuff and much better than I remembered."
"Poured a golden hue with a nice thick head. The head was gone by the time I got around to drinking the beer. Smells of slight fruit, spice, and some floral aromas. A little banana flavor with flower petals, spice, a little fruit and some yeast. Warming alcohol presence. Not as candy as some other Belgians but this one certainly has a lot of flavor. Refreshing after the long finish. A good beer."
"This is relatively drinkable, in that it's pretty tasty and doesn't beat up the palate. Still, it boarders on cloying and is only moderately interesting. I'm not really sure if this would past the blind ""American or Belgian"" tripel test - I think it's right on the boarder, which in itself indicates success, but leaves room for improvement. I preferred New Belgium's Dubbel, although this doesn't surprise me, as darks are more easily executed. 4's across the board, I think that says it all, 'good'."
"D: This beer is still a little sweet overall. I could drink 3 or or so in a row but that would probably be it for the night especially since it is 8.5% ABV."
"A beautiful bright sunset orange with a large frothy, foamy bright white head that maintains to form throughout--nice first impression. The nose follows with a nasal-cleansing blast of fresh oranges, rose and apple peel, traces of Belgium spices and yeast and later some fresh malts. Crisp floral hops are noted up front, quick tastings of yeast, spicy hops and loads of coriander. Medium bodied and the same amount of bitterness. Sweet malts come through with a cotton candy felt palate. Crisp, sharp (Saaz?) hops towards the end with a more than satisfying mouthfeel. Alcohol is concealed, but certainly adds to the offering here! A great tripel--highly drinkable."
"D: The higher alcohol is well hidden in the lush sweetness, this is a fair representative of the style."
"The first thing that I noticed about this beer was the hoppiness. This is very evident in the smell and the taste. Apart from the hoppiness, I really didn't believe the bottle when I read that It was 8.5% ABV. This beer is very tasty and crisp. Very clean aftertaste in my opinion."
"Pours a five finger off-white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Malty/hoppy nose. Flavor begins slightly malty, some honey then some sour notes. Higher ABV is hidden. Best before Nov 2006. $1.30 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"A very nice offering from NBB. Poured into my Abbey glass, formed a nice white head. Amber/copper in color, lots of carbonation bubbles, fairly clear, except for the floaty bits of yeast, which i enjoy, floating around in the glass. Smells slightly fruity perhaps a bit lemony. Tastes a bit sour, not terribly bitter, which is characteristic of belgian style ales. Very full in body, but also very easy to drink."
"Okay drinkability. A good example of an American produced Triple and another solid offering from New Belgium. Easy enough to put down."
"M&D - smooth and slightly tart, medium bodied, a decent trippel, among the better american versions of a belgian trippel, well done"
"Finished the bottle but that's all I want. I may drink this again if it were offered to me but certainly not one I'm searching for. There are just a lot of better beers readily available for the style to want this one."
"D - A little too carbonated and sweet to be drinkable. It's lacking somewhere, I can't really figure it out, but it doesn't seem to be there. This beer isn't what I thought it was going to be. I don't think I've had a Trippel before, but it doesn't seem to represent the style I expected."
"Ironically, the example that has renewed my interest in a predominantly Beglian style was brewed in Colorado. I now feel compelled to try new tripels and retry ones I've had before. New Belgium's offering is highly drinkable and refreshing, yet has enough complexity and intensity to be satisfying on its own. I've yet to have a New Belgium beer I didn't like (although I hear their Saison is horrendous), and this is definitely one of my favorites, if not my favorite."
"For one, this doesn't look much like a Tripel at all. Taste wise it's obviously not Belgian, but it's not a bad beer by any means. Personally, though, I probably won't get this again, as I know what I prefer with this type of beer."
"Tripels aren't usually my style, but this is one I can get behind."
"A great belgian tripel. The only other triple I've had was chimay. And this had a similar smell to start with, but there was banana phenol present. A great taste. Smooth, crisp, dry, awesome. I could drink this one all night. A good belgian at a great price. I got a six pack for 6.49. I'd rather have six of these than just one chimay for about the same price. Give it a try."
"Bottom line: A very tasty Trippel that is very good in bottles but is even better on draft. I highly recommend it."
"Thick body and moderately carbonated. One was more than enough to remind me to stay away from these styles for quite some time."
"A well balanced taste with a light hoppy finish that leaves a bit of dryness on the palate. This is a pretty darn good version of a Belgian style that I love. A session Tripel?"
"This is my first taste into the world of Tripel ales. 12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of 09/14/07. Poured into a snifter, the ale poured a light copper, with a good 1 inch head, that left nice lacing along the glass. The aroma is mostly fruity, with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is light and clean, and goes down smoothly. The taste is much like the smell, strong fruit flavor, but with a stronger taste of alcohol. A very tasty ale, but definitely a beer that I could only have one of during a session. A nice introduction to the style, and one worthy of more sampling. A good offering from New Belgium."
"Deep golden yellow topped by a thick head that shows great staying power. Aroma is sweet, mostly alcohol with some very ripe fruit notes. Flavor is sweet, but also has some bitterness in it. Some fruity notes but a lot of alcohol as well. Seemed a little rough for a tripel; not a polished as some better examples. Mouthfeel is good, not thin, not too heavy. Drinkabilty is OK, but harsh forcefulness detracts from the desire to drink it often."
"Golden yellow ale with thick head and nice lacing. Mild hops smell with a lot of rich aromas. Great, great, great, very complex flavors in this beer. Difficult for me to describe, but WONDERFUL!!! There is an after taste on this beer that i enjoy a lot, also very sharp refreshing taste. The drinkability of this beer to me is very high. Also has a very large ABV at 7.8%"
"I like New Belgium, they seem to have a consistently good arsenal. Trippel wasnt bad. It didnt strike me as having a distinct taste, just another Belgium style ale."
"Many thanks to csims for this brew...wonderful."
"Pours cloudy honey colored and orange with a good sized white head. Sweet white grape and raisins in the aroma along with some honey and straw. More white grapey-ness in the taste, a very little bit of lemon and a warming alcohol. This beer was not at all like a tripel to me. Most of the characteristics I would usually associate with the style were not present. More than anything it was like a strong malty beer, almost like a bock. Nevertheless it was enjoyable, just unexpected."
"Tastes quite bitter. Spicy noble hops, lemon peel, biscuity pale malt, peppery spice. Mouth is sweetish but not sticky. There's a driness in the finish that hold sthe sweetness at bay. Full bodied and the hops linger in the aftertaste. Really good stuff. A wow beer for me."
"Beer poured a deep golden color with a small head leaving a lacing in my Duvel glass. Nose is a sweet pleasant smell, of light fruits. Taste is influenced by the Belgian yeast. It is a nice blend of fruits and European hops. Mouthfeel is what makes this beer for me. It has an extremely pleasant creamy smoothness as it passes over my palate. Drinkability is very good as New Belgium has done an excellect job of masking the abv and creating another very solid brew."
"I could drink a few of these at one sitting."
"Addendum, six months after original review: still a good tripel. There's a fair amount of grain flavor, having had more examples of the style it reminds me too much of Fat Tire in the malt department. No score alterations."
"On tap in the Sierra mountains at Bluesapalooza, this tasty concoction poured light apricot amber, with a stellar fine, near white head, leaving splotchy lacing, upon a gentle swirl. Fruity, yeasty Belgian all the way nose. This is a spicy, yeasty thoroughly enjoyable American/Belgian brew. After enjoying this tasty offering, only wish that New Belgium Brews were available in the NYC/Ct./NJ area"
"A bright pilsner hay color with plenty of bubbles. Not as spectacular as I've seen in other tripels. Good lacing though. Light malted vanilla flavors mixed with a filled of unmalted barley. A very ""one with the Earth"" appeal its the tongue. Plenty of sweetened malts mixed with unknown spices except for maybe chammomile. A very clean and crisp ale flavor on the palate with plenty of effervescence."
"The only negative is that I wasn't super keen on the aftertaste, but really this is a super subtle thing and almost not worth noting."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a hazy golden amber with a nice one ince head and blotchy lacing. Really like the color on this one. Oh, note, this beer has been aging in the cellar for a while, a little past the best by date on the bottle. Nose is loverly, lots of spice and fruits and nothing i want to take the time to nail down, doesn't make me want to, just a kind of lazily pleasant aroma. Taste is pretty darn good, a lot of sweet malt and loads of spices, and that Belgian style hop attack that is the antithesis of the IPA, oodles of goodness. My oh my, a good mouth too, creamy but just a little lively over the tongue. Overall, this is a beer that, if I were in a different mood, I would probably be raving and blathering about. As it is, I'll just say at $1.49, it was a damn good buy."
"This is pretty good, and true enough to the style, but not totally balanced, nor notably drinkable."
"New Belgium is undoubtedly a great brewery and this is yet another quality offering."
"Good introduction to the style. Cheap on price, but not on quality and flavor. I recommend this one."
"Thanks for the bottle John!"
"D - It is a very good beer. However, its fairly strong ABV makes it a little less drinkable. Probably only one or two per session."
"I have enjoined NB's Abbey, but this may be too much for me. The alcohol is a bit overwhelming. Almost reminds me of drinking straight spirits."
"D: Hell yeah this is drinkable. I'm glad I got to try and even more happy I've got a few in the basement. It's a shame New Belgium doesn't ship east of the Great River."
"An enjoyable US domestic version of a belgium tripel."
"Found this one at Growler's in St. Louis for somethingllike $4 a bottle. Definitely worth the price and one of the better selections available at this nice place. It may not be as good as some Tripels from the real (vs. new) Belgium, but a nice choice nonetheless. For 8.5% ABV, did not notice the high alcohol. Easy to drink and great on the nose. Worth trying."
"Thanks to bditty for this one!"
"Drinkability: It takes a strong effort for an American brewer to nail a Belgian style this well, good work New Belgium. Thanks to Babydoc for the bottle."
"This is a supremely complex, quite drinkable, and utterly American iteration of the tripel style. With so much going on it is still able to maintain a nice sweet/dry balance which is respectable."
"Pours a red tinged yellow with a nice little head. Aroma is malty, grassy, with some light toast. Flavor was spicy and yeasty. There was some hop character but it was in the back. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Not bad at all, but nothing spectacular either. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"This beer produces a thick white foamy head, which is desired for this ""style"" and the body is golden straw colored. Powerful hop aroma with some slight sweet maltiness to it. You can definitly taste the spicy hops and it is followed with a malty sweet aftertaste, much like the nose would indicate. I've noticed a very small ethanol tone for it's 7.8 ABV. It has a fairly thick mouthfeel with slight carbonation. Overall I think this is an okay beer. I don't think I would drink an entire six pack but this is one of the better New Belgium flavors."
"D - Drinkable. A very nice tripel from NB. Recommended for sure."
"After not being able to find this beer in California, I finally got to try it on a trip to Colorado. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle, it is light gold with a hint of peach. The head was minimal, as was the lace. The smell is fruity, with peach and apricot being most noticeable. The saaz hops also make a strong presence. The taste is somewhat one-dimensional and disappointing. The mouthfeel is on the light side for a tripel. On the bright side, it's relatively easy to drink. If anyone is in search of a tripel to drink poolside on a hot day(?) this is probably the right beer. This was a disappointment."
"Notes: No need to keep going is there? Hands down one of, if not, the most difficult tripel I've had to date. However they do their malts at this brewery they don't agree with me."
"Quite well balanced and easy to drink. Nothing here to offend. Sweet but not cloying. Missing a little bit of something for it to be a great beer but this is quite enjoyable."
"Golden tones, some reddish tones, clear, some suds. Smells... like a tripel! Malty, sweet, alcoholic, pungent. Tastes bready and sweet, fruity, light, alcohol isn't overwhelming- tasty. Mouthfeel is thin but not gross. Highly drinkable- a yummy brew. Again- only one I have from Colorado- send me more!"
"This is a fine brew; locally it can be found at most outlets, even mini marts. It pours a bit foamy with a crystal clear golden color and light smell. This is a very drinkable afternoon brew with an extremely good feel and pleasant intoxication. If fish is on the menu add this brew, you won't go wrong."
"When I first poured this beer I was a little unimpressed. I'm generally not a fan of light yellow beers, and thats exactly what this looked like. After smelling it I had a little bet of a second guess but wasn't too sure about what to expect. it smelt really crisp and fresh with a hint of alcohol. (which I normally don't notice, so it must have been a bit more than a hint) Finally after taking a sip I realised I was wrong to judge this beer by its color. It did in deed have a nice crisp taste and a slight taste of alcohol. NOt too much rally, but when you go back and look at the alcohol content and compare it to its smoothness and easy drinkability you realise you have a beer that can easily kick you off your feet. overall I was impressed with this beer, dont let its smoothness fool you though, its a strong bugger. I can't wait to drink some more of this."
"Pours a nice clear pale orange tinged yellow with a nice fluffy white head that stays put for awhile and leaves plenty of traces on the glass; really pretty looking. The first smell I get is actually raspberry, then citrus, apricot and candy. Taste is nice; a little on the sweet side, with a little (too much) husky grain character and interesting alcohols/ solvents. Less fruity than the nose, but a good number of subtle little flavors. ? Maybe some pepper? Feels slick and smooth in the mouth, without being too heavy. Have to pay some attention to this one in case the EtOH catches up with you. Easy enough to drink, but like many in the style, you probably aren't going to want a lot in one sitting. although for the price, you probably could..."
"-UF"
"Pours a hazy light orange color, with yellowish highlights. No head, just a thin white line around the outside of the glass. No lacing. Good amount of carbonation. Very aromatic, lots of floral, and citrusy fruit smells. Hints of bananas, yeast and just a touch of alcohol. Tastes of spices, bananas and heavy on the saaz hops, leaves a bitter feeling in the mouth. A little sweet and somewhat tart. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, with that slightly fizzy feeling, from the carbonation. Very easy to drink and not filling at all. My first from New Belgium, nice job."
"This Triple is good, cheers!"
"D- Pretty good. I'm not sure how many in a row I would want to do, but I will get this again"
"I had to ditch this one. As I said, I'm not trying to badmout the brewery or say all their styles are bad, and maybe I got a bad batch or pour. Regardless I'm not impressed with this interpretation of the style."
"D - The aroma alone is enough reason to open up another bottle of this. Quite easy to drink, but the flavor is not quite where the aroma is. It is a bit of a let down to your expectations."
"Color is golden orange with a decent level of carbonation. Average-sized head is foamy and ultrawhite. Aroma is of sweet belgian sugars and a zesty combo of yeast and spices. Sip starts with a crisp, fairly tart mixture of spices and citris. A nice doughy, earthy malt comes next with an edge of sugariness. A slight toasted malt flavor is also noted. Overall: Trippel has a great mixture and balance of the many flavors present."
"7.8% alc."
"Drinkability overall is better than originally quoted at a 3.5."
"Not what I'd call a standard tripel, but a decent and accessible one."
"Cheers2Beers!!"
"Definately a good beer. It made me quite happy."
"Light Gold. Subtle, earthy, astringent and floral hop aroma with notes of light fruits, saaz hops, peach and cooked corn. Lacking the nice fruity malt body that I look for in the style. Dry, yeasty and slightly sweet with notes of light fruits (orange, pear and banana), heavy bubblegum, peppers and possible candy sugar. Boring, dull aroma, with a disappointing yeast character."
"Overall: Doesn't do hardly anything to mask the alcohol presence. Seems to be a dominant smell and taste. I find this to be fairly flat in complexity."
"Taste; yeasty with a nice fruity backbone of bananas, oranges and apricots with good bit of spiciness thrown in. There's a nice bread dough quality, that's balanced by a little bit of a herbal hop bitterness with a little bit of an alcohol presence, but it does no detract from the beer at all. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and very drinkable I could have a few bottles of this in one night if the alcohol didn't make me fall asleep."
"Drinkability is very solid and another winner from the NB folks."
"drinkability: stuff is pretty good. i never have more than one a night, but it's nice to have some on hand."
"Deep gold color, very clear, with loads of bubbles. The fluffy white head is about half-inch but it has amazing staying power. The smell is not overly strong but has a sweet nose of banana and light citrus. The taste is a nice sweet malt flavor of banana, wheat, and citrus. The finish is a bit sour, the alcohol is not too strong however. Mouthfeel is light to medium, lots of carbonation, decent coating. Decent drinkability, the malt flavor is softly sweet, but the finish is not all that impressive. Still very good for an American attempt at the Tripel style..."
"A pretty easy drinker and a decent shot at a sometimes disastrous style. WOrth a shot!"
"Don't make the same mistake I did: try this now, try this again, and enjoy. It's one of New Belgium's finest brews."
"Hops punch through, complimenting the palate-pleasing mouthfeel and adding additional complexity. Finish is highlighted with a unique yeast strain and wonderful residual sweetness left on the lips. Lacing delicately decorates the sides of a tulip as I quickly realize that 12 ounces is not nearly enough of this nectar."
"This is a very drinkable beer, with complex and appealing aromas and flavors. The flavors are very well balanced. Except for the ABV, I wouldnt mind having several of these in a session. I would certainly love to drink Tripple again."
"Soft somewhat musty aroma though there is some fruity sweetness. Golden body with a small but lively white head. Bannana and pear flavors in the fore. Slightly yeasty through the middle and it is very soft on the palate and rounded with a toned down alcohol presence for its abv."
"Muted golden in appearance. Not a lot of head. Sulfury aroma-yeasties abound. Touch of spice and alcohol. Peppery and malted flavor. Nice phenolic bite to it. A touch overbittered. Decent mouthfeel. The peppery spice makes it a bit astringent but not neccessarily in a bad way. A decent effort for a US brewer."
"Overall: Classic example of the style. This one seems a bit dry, and maybe just a touch boozy, but well worth a try. Im struggling to find points to ding it on, really a top-notch beer."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden yellow color with a medium white head with some active bubbling. The beer had an earthy aroma with some fruit in the background that was pleasing. The taste was bready and earthy with some spice and sweet notes at the end. Medium bodied with some active carbonation. Although this beer rings in at 8.5% abv, it is deceivingly drinkable."
"Drinkability: A nice take on the style. Not my fave but I think it's a well done beer and a good example of what a tripel should be."
"This is a very strong showing from a good brewery."
" A very solid tripel from the same Colorado brewery that produces the elusive, La Folie. Very well done."
"Overall, i wish i could get this beer normally because for the price it is great. It is a decent example of the style, but i think there are better american tripels out there."
"A wonderfully light tripel, this is a dangerous seducer worthy of all the recognition it gets. Matches exceptionally well with a white cheddar."
"Not overly complex and a touch on the toasty side of things. A bit more sweetness may have helped, but overall this is an admirable American trippel."
"12 oz. bottle, best before date: 18 August 2006. Sampled from a six-pack I procured while visiting family in Nebraska over the holidays. Golden amber haze with frothy off-white head. Sniffing reveals pears, apples, pineapples, yeastiness, and the faintest hints of cilantro and white pepper. The taste is assertively fruity -- sugary sour apples, almost like Green Apple Jolly Ranchers. There is also a strong Saaz hop kick with cilantro notes and a yeasty bread flavor. Slight mineral finish. Sparkling and juicy mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. Another strong offering from New Belgium that I wish I could find out here in the East."
"Yet again, New Belgium has impressed me; this is another fine example, or should I say interpretation of a beer. This beer has nigh infinite complexities to it. Sweet but spicy, warm, yet crisp, it just makes for good drinkin. Wow!"
"Like I state;not my cup of tea these trippels. I tryed a enough in BE to make up my mind, but this compares favorably to some of the trippels I had over there. If you are into trippels give this a considered tasting; very true to style"
"Drinkability: Tripel is not my favorite style as so many of them tend to be sweet and hot, but this one stands out not only in the category but among the entire beer kingdom - fantastic!"
"D- Alcohol not present at all in taste, but you might feel it after one or two. Divinely sippable."
"Drinkability is not bad a little too much noticable alcohol for my tastes to be better. Want to thank Dertbert for this sample, just recieved a cellared version which may be better."
"Mouthfeel has a nice body and steady carbonation that keeps it lively. There's only a hint of alcohol on the finish. I could see myself having a few of these in a sitting. Easily one of my favorites from the year round New Belgium line. Now if only I could get it in Illinois! Thanks to mentor for the hookup."
"Opinion: Well, I am pretty picky about my tripels. I am more partial to the citrus-laden fizzy brutes that make you warm up from the first sip. This beer is really good for one brewed in the USA...and available pretty readily. If I were to buy a tripel, it would probably be St. Bernardus or Westmalle...but at the same time...I would drink this beer again."
"Alcohol evident in the mouth, very chewy feel. Good sipping beer and better as it warms up."
"Appearance is hazy orange with a one finger head at first that dies down pretty quickly but still leaves a light white film over the beer. Smell is spicy and medicinal, in a good way. Lots of fruit in here as well. Taste is more tropical fruit, along with some spiciness - there's definitely some spice added here but I can't put my finger on what it is - it's very tastefully done and subtle. Hop spiciness is there to complement. Definitely some yeasty medicinal aspects to the taste as well, but like in the smell, these don't overpower the other flavors and are actually welcome here. Alcohol is not noted in the taste. Mouthfeel is thicker than the average tripel. Very creamy as well, instead of the spritzy feel I have come to expect from this style. It definitely works here though. Drinkability is off the charts, I couldn't stop sipping this one."
"Not a bad Tripel, and a domestic at that. Not as rich as I would have expected, but a very decent brew for the price - only $7 for a sixer."
"Not bad, not my favorite tripel, but for the price it's good. Just gotta start distributing to Ohio..."
"With something this carbonated, tart, and dry, I'd imagine one or two would about do it for me for a night. A good refreshing drink though."
"this beer poured a 1 and a half finger head and a light yellow to slightly peachy color. the head lingered at about 3/4 of a finger for several minutes. it has a very inviting aroma that was a bit more subtle than i expected. my nose detected coriander predominantly with some lemon and melon in the background as well as alcohhol especially as the beer warmed in the glass. this offering from new belgium is barely sweet enough for as bitter as it is. the brewers did not fool around in the bittering hops department. the mouthfeel is substantial but the lively carbonation keeps it from being heavy and it goes down quite well. finishes dry and b-i-t-t-e-r. a good beer but does not wow me."
"Out of the standard 12oz bottle. Pours a pale orange with very little head. Smells of juicy hops, tropical fruit, oranges, bubblegum. I taste juicy fruits (bananas and apricot) and hops. Balance. In the mouth, a slightly hoppy spritz. Medium light body."
"Overall, a really nice tripel."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle but into a pint glace (not the best presentation for this style), nice white head with good lacing. Carbonated very well; without excesive gass but enough air to get out the smell and flavor. Aroma is fruity but not syrupy. Graney well balaced flavor witout the yeast tart often found in American Belgium style ales. Round and chewey, you can tell it is strong but would probably not guess 8.5%."
"Nose is dominated by a doughy yeast smell and banana esters are evident. Initially this seems to taste rather too yeasty, but a rich fruitiness (sultana?) coupled with honey takes over as the beer warms in both the mouth and the glass. Alcohol is readily apparent, but not in a harsh way at all. This is one of those interesting beers where each sip tastes a little different."
"Smell is typical Belgium yeast and malts, bit of banana and pear, reminds me a bit of a wit or saison but richer. Medium creamy body with a very nice mouthfeel. Taste is light on malt but still sweet with a bit of hops bitterness, finishes dry. Hides the achohol pretty well but this is definately a slow drinking beer. Opens up a bit as it warms. Enjoy one soon. . ."
"12 ounce bottle, dated 25May06, thanks mentor!"
"Nice smooth feel on the palate that bubbles towards the swallow. Somewhat bitter. A bit malty. Taste is a touch metallic."
"Pours a cloudy dark yellow color with a large head, and takes a long time to settle. The smell is faint, but is like what you would expect with a hint of banana and other fruits. The taste is great, the same with the bananas and fruits with that little peppery kick in the end that Ive come to love from trippels. Goes down very smooth with little aftertaste, except for a lingering of the effervescing flavor. Recommended to anyone who wants to try a trippel but cant afford the plane ticket!"
"Drinkable like a bender of an evening at Brewer's Art in Baltimore. Yes, I would have several, but would need a cab ride home that night."
"Had this one yesterday at the brewery. Appearance is amber with lots of foam and sticky lace. Aroma has apricots, floral notes and fruits. Initial taste is of yeast, malt, crackers, grain, phenolic, and bitter hops. Stays on the tongue for a long finish. Crisp and clean."
"Smooth, nice yeast. Lace, disapearing head that was small to begin with. Fancy aroma. Good balance, tad of fruit and overall sweetness.Suitably carbonated and some cream in medium mouthfeel. High alcohol but still a good transition to Belgian style. No objections to this. Thanks to Tim (IPFreely)."
"Mid gold with a huge head this beer has that yeasty , Belgium smell off the top. The taste has that candy sugar/ saaz fullness that finishes semi sweet. Very drinkable and well balanced this is not as great as Unibroue or Ommegang but like North Coast Pranqster is great value for a Belgian style beer easily available."
"A very tasty brew that is easily rinkable. More affordable than most Belgians and a very good starting point as well as a good staple for those that like the Belgian style."
"Pours from the bottle into a Belgian glass, very transparent light golden color. Very little head observed, however there is a lot of carbonation. Smell is the best part of this beer as far as I'm concerned. The smell is very complex, mostly spicy (cloves, slight hop aroma). I also pick up grapefruit or some other citrus scent. Taste is crisp and full bodied, I don't think I could drink more than 1 or 2 of the tripel but, overall it is a damn good beer."
"If you look at the price/ABV ratio you're getting a very good beer for cheap. This will definately be a common sight in my fridge."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head. It fades slowly, leaving very few laces. It smells citrus like. The hop aroma is very present. It smells honey. Also, the yeast aroma is present. It tastes hoppy. Also, slightly spicy. Maybe a slight hint of cloves. I assume it is from the yeast. I also taste the alcohol a little. It has a sweet, but crisp refreshing taste to it. This beer is very carbonated. It might be just a little too carbonated. It is medium bodied. Not very thick. It goes down crisp leaving a hoppy, spicy taste on my palate. This beer might make a decent session beer. The alcohol content is a little high, but that is ok. Although not exactly my style, this is a good beer. Try it if you get the chance."
"is as easy to drink as a pilsner in the 4-5 range. All in all, this is a good belgian, and a likely pairing with fresh fruit or as a dessert unto itself. Enjoy."
"Drinkability: A nice tripel. Tastes more mass produced than other belgian tripels I have had. It is a very good intro into the style for people unacustomed to the flavor and alcholic strength."
"A really good Belgian."
"Pours a very hazy amber-peach-orange body beneath a short head of white foam that holds fairly well and initally leaves some nice lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is fruity, spicy (coriander?), and yeasty with a bit of hay-like/wheat-ish malt and some mild, spicy hops. It's quick in the mouth with a medium body and delicately effervescent carbonation that lets it pass readily. The flavor, however, is more imposing and tends to linger in the finish. It's spicy and hoppy (also spicy, and floral), and along with a solid bitterness, that helps to balance it's sweetish, delicately candyish, lightly citrus-rind like, and grassy/straw-like maltiness. Surprisingly, the alcohol is well-hidden here, as it's seems to stand out a bit in their Abbey (dubbel). Nicely done, and a perfect after dinner beer - or pair it with some Thai food, stinky cheese, or salad with oil and sesame seeds."
"Pours a coudy dark orange with minimal head and slight bubbling. Using the New Belgium goblet that babydoc sent also (thanks again...excellent box of goodies.) Nose is honeydew and Belgian yeast. Taste profile matches with carbonation tickling the tongue and a crispy finish. Mouthfeel is medium with a little thinning at the finish. A big beer that is incredibly drinkable. I love this brew, probably more so because it is not readily available to me. Tasty."
"New Belgium really does a great job when they stick to the abbey ale; how about less Fat Tire crap and more Trappist genius?"
"Pours a brilliantly clear golden color with a small fluffy head. Aromas of strong citrus notes (sour cherries and dark plums) and brown sugar, spicy hops and peppery smells. Tastes strongly of caramelly malt, with a slight warming alcohol and a fragrant hop bite towards the end. Strong, spicy beer. I am impressed. New Belgium makes some of the highest quality beers with the lowest prices around. A winner in my book."
"Pours a golden color in my New Belgium Chalice, along with a nice 2 fingers of sticky froth. Nice lacing is apparent once this settles; looks very appealing in appearance. Smell is melon and rosy alcohol phenols, very nice! Taste is crisp and yeasty from the start; however, not overwhelming. ABV% is very well hidden, the bottle I have says 7.8%ABV, which differs from previous offerrings. The Belgian yeast and Saaz hops come through in the aftertaste and are a nice match. This is a quality step towards the finer Belgian beers which cost substantially more, at a fraction of the price. A truly worthy beer brewed right here in the U.S.A."
"Nothing beats free beer unexpectedly like this one from Pipe and Pint today,poured a nice golden with a light orange hue with abig fluffy head that left nice lacing down the tulip glass.Very yeasty aroma a little spicey with some banana in there almost a weisse aroma in my mind.Flavors of very sweet pineapple and some over ripe banana,some honey,with a little phenolic smokiness but its faint.A very sold tripel not as good as some Belgian classics but hey I could stand to drink this anytime and it was free."
"Very nice flavor. Fruity, a bit yeasty. Hops are a bit strong, but overall a fine example of the style."
"Try this if you haven't had it, but I would recommend the New Belgium Abbey Style Dubbel over this any day, if you hadn't already deduced that fact from my review. I don't usually like to compare apples to oranges, or dubbels to trippels, but I really couldn't help it in this instance, as they were so similar, but yet one was so much better, IMO."
"Mouthfeel: Harsh huskyness on the mouthfeel."
"One of the better beers from NB"
"Pours a slighly cloudy, dull yellow body. Nice head, the bubbly body and head last untill the beer is gone. Smells malty, slight freshness, no hops. Tastes malty throughout, little hops, tart and spicy. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp and bubbly. Drinkability is good, but overall it's not my favorite tripple, too heavy on the malt."
"if i could start an 'american tripel' category, i would and i'd throw this in there. wish i had the other 5 (3?) that came in the pack. i'd drink them shits up right now, yo."
"It's a bit like frenching a dog, no offense to the three graces shaking their jigglies on the label. Tripel dry and a bit sandpapery, but the hops tickle. Gingery, peppery, lemony. Tripely tickley. Lovely. Has this dried out in recent years? Dried lemon zest. Some horse barn dust. Delicious. Nasturtiums. Buckwheat honey."
"With only one or two exceptions, New Belgium's lineup is top notch, and this is a very nice Tripel. I wish they'd bottle in 750ml's too."
"With all New Belgium offerings, though, I can't help but feel like there is an artificialness in the beer. It's almost as if they give it some coloring and a bit of flavor. The mouthfeel on this beer is just peppery enough to be enjoyable for me. And, they're very drinkable at 7.8% abv. with such a light body."
"Bottle. Once again from new Belgium a beer with a distinct lack of guts, especially for a trippel, having said that, i guess its pretty soft and a approachable, and in general theres nothing wrong with it, its just not very interesting. Maybe thats what they intended, but i was looking for a bit more."
"While not the most dynamic version, this has a swagger and real-deal lean that makes it worthwhile. Wish I had another bottle. Saaz lovers take note."
"Drinkability: well, although the feel was a bit ""off"" for me, the appearance, smell, and taste warrent a try at this beer. I'd like another please!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" white head above a golden amber brew. Head stays constant, due to effervescence from bottom of the glass, and lacing is good. Aroma is sweet malts combined with Belgian-style spicing. Taste follows the nose, and is pretty near optimal for the style, leaving just a tad of space for improvement. Certainly a lot going on here, but it all comes together nicely. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. Nice offering from New Belgium, especially for my first taste of their products."
"A fine American trippel, I wish I had received more than one bottle but I'm thankful for the chance to at least try it."
"Overall Impression: Nice intro belgian beer. Very drinkable for the alcohol content. According to the bottle this is now 7.8 % ABV instead of the 8.5 % listed"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This is a pretty all right beer."
"Whilst abroad I used to go for the Leffe trippel, and as drinkable as the Leffe was, the alcohol is better masked in this brew. Still at 8.5 abv it'd be wise not to imbibe too quickly."
"Tasted: 12/08/04"
"Drinkability- Alcohol % is hidden well. Was suprised to see how much it was when I decided to review. Not feeling it yet and it's been 20 minutes since I finished. A nice USA belguin beer. Not to standards with Belgium, but a decent one."
"Nice hazy banana yellow color with a white head. Sweet aroma, a mix of fruity esters / spice from the yeast and sugary bread from the malt, no real hops to speak of. Sweet malty flavor smooths over the warming alcohol notes, there are some nice esters here, banana maybe. There is a nice balance between the bitterness and the body. A good tripel. Thanks ClarkVV!"
"thanks clarkvv from rate beer for sharing this at kuhnhenns. poured a golden with a white head. aromaa nice sweetness, malts, yeast, orange, hints of pineapple, alcohol. flavor, malts, orange. pineapple., hops, alcohol. this was well balanced beer not know if it can be found in michigan but I will be looking for it."
"Much like their Abbey ale, I think this is a good shot by an American brewer at a classic Belgian style. Though the alcohol does come through a bit in the taste, not nearly enough to expect the eight and a half percent ABV this brew is packing."
"A world-class triple in my book, this is an excellent representation of the style from one of my favorite breweries. At $7.29 a 6-pack, this is heavenly manna, and were it available in my area, I would drink this everyday. Highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is good. Soft and rounded. Drinkability is OK, but suffers from high alcohol and what i feel is an imbalance."
"This poured out a hazy golden yellow with a slight white head rising above it. The head is gone quick without leaving much in the way of lacing. Scents of orange, coriander and other spices were present. There were notes of other fruits and of a bit of malt sweetness. The flavor was similar with spiciness, apples and doughy malt. A bit of lemon was present and the after taste was spicy and a tad bitter going down, very tasty. Mouth feel was medium and creamy and a bit heavier than most other triples Ive had. Good drinkability I really enjoyed this one and would get it regularly."
"Pours an attractive orange color with a moderate head. The aroma has an orange (corriander?) feel with a small hoppiness. Slightly earthy. The flavor is much like the aroma. Some orange and yeast spices, finishes with a bitter hop. This is a pretty good beer, but it's really missing something for a tripel. Might be better as a dubbel."
"The pours a clear peachy orange color with 2 fingers of fluffy white head. The nose is nice with an orange presence. There is a bit of an alcohol presence in there with the orange and sweet malts. The saaz hops come through in the finish. The feel is moderately thick. Drinkability is pretty good on this as well. I like it."
"Didn't realize the 8.5% abv- certainly very drinkable"
"While the taste isn't exquisite, the body is so heavy and wonderful that it allows you to taste it fully. My major concern was that it would be watered down, and its not."
"Addendum: As the bottle suggests, this brew is best when cool as opposed to cold. The frutiness is more pronounced in this state and more diverse: pear and apple and other fall fruits come out to play."
"Not as good as I remember it being some ten or twelve years ago."
"However, even at 8.5 I could drink it all night."
"It has the possibility to be a sugary headache, but only having one of these on-tap was perfect. Quite possibly my favorite offering from the brewery, and a beer that set my eyes open about the style."
"A nice beer. One I would drink again."
"It's creamy and full in the mouth, and it teases your tongue with some spicyness, some fruit that I can't pin down... maybe apricots something sweet and basic, not overwhelming, whatever the fruit it's faint and surrounded with this gorgeuous liquid shortbread maltiness. When it's gone, it leaves behind that sunny shortbread taste for a while... you're bound to drink more. Really beautiful."
"Bottle: Poured an hazy golden yellow colored beer with medium head and above standard retention. Aroma is quite sweet with some subtle spice also perceptible. Taste is a bit too sweet with too much candi sugar, which ends up covering most of the wheat. Spices are good but too subtle and again probably covered by the candi sugar. Carbonation is a bit low but body is above average. Alcohol is not discernable which is a great plus at 8%. Overall, there is too much candi sugar for my liking in this one."
"Hazy golden body and soft sudsy head. Strong and pleasing esters. Bubble gum, bananas, green apples, and citrus. Nice yeasty complexity. Well-integrated bitter fruit peel and grassy hop finish. A very nice Belgian Trippel. This beer has gained points with me as I gained experience and sampled repeatedly through time."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium yellow color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. There is no lacing at all. The smell is sweet and malty, with honey, lemon, and white grape. A fairly strong aroma as well. The taste is slightly sweet at first, with more of the white grape and honey coming through. It has a dry malty finish. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and smooth. The drinkability is good for an 8.5% brew. Another nice one from New Belgium."
"this one pours a nice hazy amber, lots of carbonation bubbles pushing the sediment around. the head is decent and lasts seems to stick around. the smell is immediately sweet with noticeable spiciness, and i almost smell a bit of caramel. taste is sweet at first and finishes a bit tart. there are some melons in there, and the spices are in the flavour as well as the aroma. mouthfeel is bubbly and and goes down without dragging along your throat too badly. there is a yeastish aftertaste that isn't exactly welcome, but doesn't detract from the overall experience either. pretty drinkable, but i usually find one plenty. a pretty good domestic trippel at an affordable price. worth trying if you find it."
"Probably the best tasting tripel I've ever had. Pours a nice off cloudy orange/gold with an off white head that is 2 inches thick and is very potent. Lacing is incredible, will foam down the glass after every drink. The smell is very fruity, melons wet the nose and a nice raspberry hop kick brings up the end. The taste has a nice blend of yeast and sweet malt upfront. Slight caramel taste. The hop bitterness is perfect, you get the pucker then the nice blend of peach taste. Honey is also detected. Feels medium bodied and refreshing, a very drinkable tripel, the 8.5% is very hidden. Top notch."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew, though this style is not my favorite."
"Subtle hints of tropical fruit, an omnipresent herbal / spice quality, & a dry finish that warms the throat a tiny bit. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation."
"Gold color with almost a surprisingly tiny head. Has a yeasty and spicy aroma. Taste is first sweet bananas followed with mellow cloves. A bit dissapointed, as I have been holding out drinking what I thought would be NBs best beer, but still good. I would have liked a bit more carbonation and a bit less sweetness. At least its 8.5, which doesnt make it coat my tongue."
"This is a full bodied beer with a huge amount of flavor."
"Overall, a very nice, complex, yet well balanced brew. It was very easy drinking - I didn't notice the alcohol at all."
"It is crisp, clean and palate-cleansing. I loved the beer, but the taste didn't lead me to want a second right away. Since I have almost unlimited time and five more bottles, there's no hurry."
"Bright yellow with a fairly light head compared to other tripps. The nose gives you the fruit and spice with hints of yeast. This is a very well balanced beer. The 8.5%Abv goes unnoticed in cold beers but when you serve at the proper temperature the character comes alive! The alcohol comes alive and the brew turns into a true trippel. The beer is crisp on the tongue and goes down clean. Another solid product from our friends at New Belgium. Thanks!"
"Pours out a darker yellow, leaves a great head with wonderful lacing-hard to believe this is a mass produced beer. Taste is fantastic, some fruit, floral accents, very yummy. Definite yeasty flavor, but not too overpowering. I taste some caramel in there too. High ABV, but masked well. I liked this beer a great deal, and it seems quite accessible and inexpensive, unlike many other Belgian beers."
"ng"
"Overall, a solid tripel and one of the better ones I've tried. Big thanks to bditty187 for the sample!"
"New Belgium Trippel Style Ale was served from a 12 oz. bottle. Once settled into a Duvel tulip, the beer was a rich and hazy orange-golden, and was topped by a substantial fine white head that left excellent lacing. The nose was aggressively loaded with coriander, with numerous accents such as cut grass, bitter citrus peel, honey, bready yeast, and flowery perfume....very nice. The taste matched the nose closely. A fluffy, honey-melon malt backbone opened up with powerful notes of wild flowers and freshly trampled grass. These flavors became tainted with doughy coriander and bitter orange peel in the nicely bittered, satisfying finish. A nice medicinal bitterness lingers. I really enjoyed the subdued sweetness level thoughout..very nice, were other trippels can be too sweet for my palate. The body was appropriately fluffy and rich for the flavors. This Trippel was full flavored, tasty, and balanced....a nice piece of work."
"12 oz. bottle dated best before June 2004. Pours a turbid muted golden color with a beige head that dissipates quickly. Some biscuity malt and fruity yeat aromas, yet overall smelling sweet. Initially fruity and sweet, then moving towards esteriness and a bread malt profile. Enjoyable, but not what I anticipate from a Belgian style tripel. Pretty smooth and easily drinkable. I'd seek it out more but it's a moot point, just not available in my area."
"I like this stuff. It does seem a little off balance, but it's good."
"Thanks CRJM!"
"Notes: Very refreshing with the 8.5% abv being slightly hidden, quite the palate cleanser. Cabot has this Parmesan Cheddar blend, a perfect match with some mini rye bread. If you are into Trippels this is a must try, IMO this is a good stepping stone to jump into the vast world of Belgian Beer."
"I feel good this was to be had at 7.49 for a 12 ounce six pack."
"It is a cloudy orange in color and has a creamy sweet aroma. It has plenty of fruity esters and some spicy phenols with a sweet, peppery finish. It is quite complex and good. Sadly this brewery does not ditribute in my area so I won't be drinking this too often."
"686"
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is good. It is refreshing and full of pale malts and Belgian yeast. It has a spicey scent that is quite appetising. The taste is decent. It has a nice pale flavor with a spicey Belgian style yeast taste. It warms a little on the finish, but it drinks well. It has a good mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation; maybe a little too much carbonation. This is a fine Blegian style beer, but I've had better."
"Slight lemon and corriander smell to the brew on the pour. Hazy cloudy golden color in the glass (goblet) with a decent off white head. The taste is quite complx upfront with corriander, banana, and pineapple. Then the brew smooths with a dry malt back of the tongue in the finish. Medium to thickish coating mouth. Very pleasant and drinkable. I like how this brew is complex in taste upfront.. but the finish leaves you with a coating regal dry malty wanting for more feeling.... very well balenced and tasting for the ABV."
"A very enjoyable beer, although it felt off balance."
"As an aside, I think it's time to try Allagash Tripel again--my palate has grown up enough to handle the alcohol and reach deeper into the wonderful characteristics of Tripels, and I have a feeling I was a bit blind in my first review."
"All in all, I found this tripel to be lacking all the pieces to make it a truly outstanding brew. In fact, I found it to be quite unremarkable. It was hard to believe that a well cared for brew with a death date of late August this year would look so dead already. Sometimes, first impressions are right on."
"There is no hint of the 8.5% alcohol in the drinking. That could be a problem because, too many of these, and you would be out. This was a nice beer and I can't wait to have another. Maybe tonight."
"Appearance: Golden drop of clouded sun beams with a white effervescent head forms even bands of lacing with each sip very nice. Aroma: The peppery Saaz hops play a role here of adding to the spiciness but the citrus and tropical fruit esters is where it's at in my opinion, smell is great. Taste: Flavor isn't overally sweet which is good there are some bready yeast notes to balance along with some minimal bitterness in the finish a nice trippel that I compare to the likes of St. Bernardus Tripel. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied golden ale with spritzy yet very soft carbonation. Drinkability: Is effortless very tasty flavorful well balanced tripel that is sure to be one of the better American brewed examples."
"12oz Bottle marked 03SEP04. Poured a cloudy orange with a head that dissapeared quickly. Yeasty aroma that is citrusy and spicy. Nice. Has an outstanding body that is silky smooth and delicate. Flavor is classic Tripel which is fruity and malty, a bit sweet and a spicy finish. This is one of the top American brewed tripels in my opinion."
"This is an excellent trippel. It pours a dark golden colour with a huge head of frothy white foam. Aromas are that of a classic triple. Spicy, boozy, yeasty, malty, hoppy, zesty, magnificent. The taste is a wonderful melange of the classic Belgian triple aromas rolled into one wonderful ball of contradictions. The mouthfeel is lush and creamy and the drinkability is excellent. Whoa! 9%abv, you could have fooled me! One of the best domestic triples available on the west coast...for sure!"
"New Belgium Trippel Belgian Style Ale is one of my first tripels. Unfortunately, it didn't really blow me away. It's rated very highly, just outside of the top 50, so maybe I just don't love the style."
"Mouthfeel is both creamy and spritzy at the same time. A drinkable ale full of belgian-style character. Well done for an American brewery. Seek this one out and sip slowly."
"Pours a nice mostly clear golden color with a good two fingers of head. The head slipped away leaving some lacing down the sides of the glass. A constant light stream of bubbles continued to produce a thin white head throughout the beer. Smelled mostly of fruits, hops, and the peppery yeasty flavor common in almost all their beers. Tasting this was excellent. Nice fruity flavor up front with the peppery yeast. Fading away to a nice bready body and finishing slightly sour. The hops are noticable throughout. Quite nice. The malt showed a little more power as it warmed, but it stayed pretty balanced. Not overly sweet, but not too bitter either. Mouthfeel was nice. Moderate body. Dry finish, and smooth. As for drinkability, I've had several now, not all at one sitting, but I definately enjoy these. I've got two set back to age to see what happens, but overall, rather enjoyable, and I'll continue to pick these up when I get the chance."

"Thanks to prAna for making this possible."
"As it jets from the tap a cloudless deep amber to copper color, the head prodigious in size, creamy in texture and the color a light tan with the residual lace a thick and glass sealing sheet. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and fresh, hints of ripe fruit, maybe pineapple; a real swell nose at any rate, start is rich in malt, lightly sweet with a middling top. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops forthright and quite pleasant, very dry aftertaste and a great beer in or out of the bottle."
"Beers like this usually cost $8 a bottle and come with a cork. Poured a beautiful thick white head that left lace on my glass. Rich golden in color with an ample amount of CO2. Aroma was complex in the depth of the fruity esters combined with a dry maltiness and a good amount of alcohol. Taste is a bit more aggressive than i am used to from a tripel but not so much as to be out of style. Rich fruitiness with a dry maltiness and a hint of spicy hops. Body is light and yet seems to be a bit too light. Very drinkable as the price allows me to have six experiences with this beer for the price of one experience of a moderate belgian beer, plus this one is fresher."
"This beer doesn't have much of a head on it. I was under the impression that trippel's were supposed to have a nice big fluffy head on it that left a nice lace on the glass. But oh well, looks aren't everything. The nose is really nice. Nice belgian, estery smell. The taste is quite nice as well. A somewhat subdued flavor, but still belgian, true to form. Nice estery, fruity flavor with just barely a hint of alcohol."
"(Note to self: acquire more of this to cellar along with their dubbel..)"
"Nice hazy golden color. There are hints of yeastiness, bananas and clove in the nose, as well as the taste. This is quite good. I would have to put this up on a par with some of the better Tripels from Belgium. Certainly not a close clone of one. The others that I have had from this brewery should be this good. This proves what they are capable of."
"Picked up a single at World Market. Didn't notice that the ""best by"" date was ""9Jul03"" until just now. Doh! Perhaps this is why it had a very subdued head(which never entirely disappeared). Color was hazy gold, and what head there was had a white as snow color. Big floral hop scent. Tasted of floral hops, banana and a little bit of vanilla. Finishes on a sharp, crisp note with an odd little sour aftertaste that is only just noticeable. Otherwise my taste score would be higher. That being said, this is an enjoyable tripel, the first I've had that isn't a true Belgian, and should merit my continued attention - though in the future I'll be peering closely for ""best by"" dates."
"Dark gold color, small head. Hoppy, VERY floral hop taste, light and refreshing. Nice smooth malts. Full bodied. Mouthfeel is pleasantly smooth and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Floral hop taste is the focal point for this beer. Very different nice taste."
"I had a note of a funny aftertaste in my 2003 review that I deleted since I didnt find it with this most recent batch. I upped the Smell and Taste ratings by 0.5."
"What a great label! Pours a cloudy golden with a big white foamy head. Appears to be a good amount of carbonation. Smells of yeast and pepper, slight hoppiness. Hops (Saaz?) balanced with a little sweetness up front, followed by yeast and pepper/coriander(?). Aftertaste is OK, not great. Alcohol hides pretty well, but I think one is enough tonight. Very good for the price and I like that it is brewed only one state away (read: fresh)."
"All in all, I'd give this beer a ""B" grade. I prefer the native Belgians only because I find them more complex. Otherwise, this is an admirable attempt at a wonderful style."
"Originally rated 11 May 2003. This Trippel pours a hazy golden yellow colored w/ a quickly disapating head. this baby is beautiful. Full flavored w/ a velvety tongue feel, this is a must have. The flavor is slightly sweet w/ some fruity overtones. Beautiful"
"One of my favorite American beers. Now why doesn't Trippel have the cult status of Fat Tire, that's the next topic for the Armchair Philosophers Club..."
"When poured, it was a medium golden yellow with medium foam, while the lace on the side of the glass was heavy from start to finish. The smell was a fruity aroma and a soft sweet maltiness. Lively mouth feel with a finish reminiscent of brut champagne, but, over powering. I just love this beer!"
"This could have been a bad bottle, but it's almost 7 months away from it's 'best before' date and I bought it from the refridgerated section of the store and put it in my fridge within a half-hour of purchase."
"Thanks to bditty187 for including this one !"
"The past week has brought my first tastes of New Belgium's Abbey and Trippel. There are better representatives available of both of these styles, but at such a reasonable price I can definitely make both of these regulars in my fridge."
"Good, crisp, smooth, and clean with a good fruity kick. Nice brew. Color was a hazy deep yellow, almost orangey glow with a great frothy head that was an inch or so thick and lasted pretty much through the whole glass. Smells lightly of lemon, orange peels maybe or banana peel, good floral hop presence with a spicey note like pepper or clove. Taste was good with a good solid fruit and hop mix with lots of floral, spicey hops that fizz around in the mouth, lots of carbination. It reminded me of a Corona with a lime or lemon in it, but way more bolder and full bodied. Thats maybe a bad example but its all I can think of. Damn good and drinkable. Ahh, hows this, it was like Paulaner Hefe-weisen with a lemon wedge. I think that'll do."
"This beer pours a somewhat small head for a belgian but it lasted throughout the glass. Nice golden color. I poured the yeast from the bottle into the beer for maxium flavor and aroma. Taste is malt, then fruit and spice finishing with hops. The smell is of fruitty esters and alcohol. This beer is very drinkable for a belgian style beer."
"Fine orange color and thick head display well in a Chimay chalice. Nose is a bit understated - subtle mix of coriander and Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is big with a slightly rough edge. Taste is great. Compares well with some authentic Beligian trippels. I get some hoppy bitterness in the finish, but nothing too pronounced. A sweet & light malty taste does linger. This beer, like most other Belgian-styles I've tried, doesn't lead me to immediately reach for another. It's complexity makes one a week about right."
"All in all a good drinkable beer..well maybe 4 or 5 they certainly seem strong."
"Total score: 27 out of 50"
"I think New Belgium did a pretty good job on this beer. I could have sworn by the aroma that this beer had been brewed overseas. I just think that they need a little more flavor up front to balance out the strong alcohol and bitter finish."
"Drinkability: In spite of the weird taste, it was very smooth, and there was nothing artificial about it."
"Pours a very deep golden-orange color with very little head. A very floral aroma with fruits and spiced hops, very complex. A crisp clean taste which is refreshing. A little bit of spice in the taste mixed with alcohol . Up front is sweet with a finish that is sort of biting from the hops. Not one of my favorites from New Belgium but still a nice brew."
"Finish is long and appetizing."
"Again New Belgium Brewing Inc. is a hit - Do they have a deal with the devil? This orangeish-yellow cloudy brew ha ha is rather good. A lemony, citrus malltiness and yeasty/alcohol smell to the nose. The head is pour (pun - not a typo). A shred of lace down the sides of the glass. The taste is a bitter meets sweet flavor and a definate taste of lemon. Reminds me of a bottle conditioned Wheat Beer in flavor and nose more than a tripel but definately meets all the requirements of a tripel. Give it a shot. You can definately do worse."
"Pours a lovely hazy golden color with a foamy and creamy white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is quite fruity with notes of fresh ripe apple, banana, and citrus. Some floral hop aromas are also present. Taste up front is sweet candied sugar with some fruity esters and tart citrus notes to follow. Spicy hops kick in at the end and leave a dry crisp finish. A very fine brew. This is probably the best offering from New Belgium Brewing Co."
"Poured looking like fresh apple cider but with a fluffy white head. Foam was sticky and hung around like many others cant. Some candy sugar cideriness detected amidst the malt. Slightly more bitterness than Ive come to expect form this style of beer made it a refreshing change from overly malty brews. The New Belgium boys and girls did a good job with the Tripel style, IMO."
"Damn impressive beer for being brewing the the good o' USA I can only hope to produce a Triple this fine in my own brewing endevours."
"Deep golden yellow color, small white head. Flowery, yeasty and faint alcohol aroma. Fruity spicy banana-clove malty flavors. Full body, full soft mouthfeel, balanced lasting finish, warming alcohol effect, dangerous drinkability, got to be careful with this one."
"Another great beer from New Belgium (thanks to a great trade!). The beers in actual Belgium can't be much better than this can they? Poured a golden amber color with a thick head. Aroma alternated between fruity and hoppy. Cleverly balanced spicy flavor with hops, alcohol, and fruit with a nice citrus aftertaste. Good stuff."
"A nice trippel, a bit simplier then some of my favorites, but very drinkable and refresxhing."
"Golden in color with a haze, head foams up big up with large bubbles.  Bottle marked best before 08Jul03.  I let the beer warm up for 30 minutes after taking out of the fridge to get to a warmer temp - 50 F recommended.  The smell is wonderful.  The previous bottles I had seemed a lot more sweet but not overly so.  This one has a little more hops present and high alcohol is present on the tongue.  Most of the way through the glass, the lasting impressions are of sweetness and alcohol.  This is probably my favorite New Belgium product thus far.  I will let some of my other bottles age a while.  A good value."
"Another great belgian from New Belgium Brewing.  Hazy white with a big foamy head.  One smells the bubble-gum like sweetness of Belgian candi sugar, citrus, spice, and something very much like sourdough bread.  On the palate, this beer displays a very pleasant contrast between its creamy texture and the spicy flavors of clove and hops, with a somewhat dry, peppery finish.  Quite delicious -- one of the best American tripels and certainly one of the best values!  This or NBB's Abbey ale make a fine introduction to Belgian beer."
"New Belgiums Trippel a Belgian Style Ale is a work of art. The stimulus to the senses of sight, smell and the palate, lull one into a repast of ease and well being, not often achieved by brewers in this country."
"Pours a pale yellow/orange color with a massive off-white head.  The smell is of fruity esters with a trace of yeast and alcohol.  A combination of peach, grapefruit, yeast and a warming alcohol make of the combination of flavors in this nice American-made Tripel.  It is a light to medium bodied brew that finishes a slightly sticky-dry.  Overall good brew!  Cheers!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Once again, a thanks to marc77 for the New Belgium sampling."
"Light amber color, and cloudy from the yeast.  Big white head that is evidence of the extra fermentation.  Smell is similar to their dubbel, spicy dried fruit.  Perhaps with a bit more spice.  More spicy fruit in the taste, with definite alcohol presence.  Spiciness is in command of this brew, with a good balance of bitterness and maltiness in the background.  Lots of carbonation makes for an interesting mouthfeel.  Great malty finish, which is a big factor in defining a great beer for my palate.  The large amount of carbonation makes this more of a sipping brew.  Quite an impressive one though, another masterpiece from New Belgium!"
"This is one of the best American versions of a tripel I have tasted.  A bright golden color leads to a fruity malt aroma.  One taste and you recognize a tasty, clean, crisp fruity beer that hides its alcohol content well until you have a couple more.  Just a great refreshing tasty libation."
"Peachy-gold hue with subtle highlights of bronze, the white head was fluffy, modest in size, it reached a finger in height. Very good retention, a thick foamy cap lasts quite awhile. I let the yeast find their way into my glass; they slowly danced their way to the bottom. It is a beautiful sight that needs to be set to music. It laced it thick rings. Awesome. The nose is a lovely blend of sweet candy sugar and alcohol, in the background notes of floral hops, pear-like fruitiness, and marshmallows. The nose is very pleasant, fair potency. I have a young bottle of beer Im reviewing, eight months before it expires and thus the alcohol sharpness on the tongue is a tad too strong. It needs to mellow. That is my only beef with NBs Trippel but that problem can be remedied with cellaring. On the palate the candy-sugared sweetness, marshmallows and bubblegum blends wonderfully with floral hops and fruitiness. The malt is noticeable as a background entity, which is very well done. The yeast provides just a kiss of earthiness. The alcohol is belly warming; it also provides spiciness on the back of the tongue, which is quite lovely. And it does find its way to your brain. Medium body with modest, natural carbonation that is very fitting for this beer. This is a very respectable Tripel, now factor in the cost ($6.00 a six-pack) and you have a bargain that cannot be ignored. When I need a Belgian-style beer NB is always there for me. God Bless Them. This is an absolutely lovely beer. Recommended."
"This is another fine example of the new belgium brewing company. This beer pours a deep golden color with a very large creamy white head. The head lasts alot longer than most brews from this company which is a good thing. There is a fruity smell to the beer. Upon first taste you notice light malt sweetness with alot of hop and fruit flavors. Also there is a slight wheat taste. The beer also has a slight alcohol flavor to it, which isnt too overwhealming. Overall this is a very good beer."
"An award-winner that doesn't live up to its tall billing.  Quickly dissipating white head.  Very spicy nose, slight alcohol hints.  Flavor is part wheat and spicy, though one would hope for greater complexity"
"Billowly, thick & creamy persistant white head. Golden, slightly hazy hue that seems a touch darker than the norm for a tripel.  The large amount of yeast sediment in the bottle indicates bottle conditioning.  Complex fruity esters include clove, which dominates, but subtle pear and banana notes can be discerned as well.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Tastes a bit cleaner than other Tripels but is still complex in flavor.  A nectar - like sweetness upfront is ensued by fruity yeast byproducts including notes of pear and green apple acetaldehyde.  Just a hint of hop bitterness rounds it out in the finish.  A well balanced, well brewed and fresh tripel, though not as intense as some Belgian tripels if you can find them fresh.  Gold medal GABF 2001, if I recall correctly."
"I was not as impressed as my fellow beer tasters.  I though it was good, had a nice citrus flavor, but not as complex as I would have liked."
"For the price, this is a damn good trippel.  One of the best six packs for under $8.  It's only slightly below the level of the good Belgian trippels."
