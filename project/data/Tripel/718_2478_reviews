"Yet another exemplary Belgian tripel. Poured with thick towering head into tulip, aroma is honey, vanilla and bread. Mouth feel is smooth and velvety, taste hits the mark perfectly. Yummy!"
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, cloves. Flavor is light stone fruit and pear, semi-sweet bready, lightly caramel malt, clove and coriander; finishes with light spice bitterness. Medium bodied with a  nice mouth feel. A classically flavored Belgian tripel, perhaps a bit on the sweeter side, but not out of style. Nice fruit and spicing. Well done for the semi-sweet style of tripel."
"From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Servall Liquor in San Diego."

"O-I am pretty disappointed in this beer. I like some other Petrus offerings, but this one misses the mark in pretty much every category. I find the cooked corn maltiness to be especially odd here and the other flavors are strangely fruity and unbalanced. The assertive carbonation also detracts from the rest of the beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven-point-two ounce Euro-style long neck bottle, with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O: An outstanding Belgian tripel. Crisp, clean, easy to drink. Not heavy at all. Everything feels in balance and each part complements the others, nothing is out of place. Drank this on a cold winter night, need to revisit the review on a humid 80 degree summer evening and see how it compares, I suspect it will be even better in that environment."

"O - Great warm weather beer that would go well with some sharp cheddar, gouda etc. Overall an interesting tripel."

"Overall: This beer is fabulous. Very Smooth, crisp, flavorful, but also delicate. This beer is very well balanced. This is a great beer for a hot day in the spring or summer"
"Pair this beer with a good quality hamburger with white cheddar, or, some Belgian style fries and some aioli or spiced ketchup."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, honey, and spiced fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting spiced fruit aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity. The resulting mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, then smooth and foamy. No ethanol is detected on the palate. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness remaining on the palate."
"Really solid Tripel! Maybe my favorite ever. So easy to drink, no indication of its strength. And the flavor is so well balanced and delicious. Loving this!"
""
"Overall, I would not particularly recommand this triple."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottle code 38596. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apple, pear, apricot, grape, honey, bread, herbal, floral, candi sugar, earthiness, and lightly spicy yeast esters; some slight cardboard but its not too noticeable. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/malty notes. Taste of apple, pear, apricot, honey, grape, bread, herbal, floral, candi sugar, earthiness, and lightly spicy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, honey, herbal, grass, candi sugar, earthiness, and light spicy yeast esters on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/malty notes; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Tripel. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/malty notes; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O- The nice blend of subtle flavors is nice but it is missing more of the classic yeasty flavor or malt or hops that would make this beer a bit more tasty."

"OK, I did not plan to review this rather odd Petrus offering, but the unusual reviews from others dragged me into the discussion. This is an extremely fine mediocre Belgian. True it is nothing special, but Total Wine offered a four pack special and the price justified giving Gulden Tripel a try, it is well worth the discounted price. I hesitate to judge a brew by the price, but I always fall back on Anchor Steam or Sierra Nevada for precisely that reason, fine beer and justified price. Now, as what to expect, nice clean taste and appearance, decent head with average carbonation. I detect a touch of citrus closing out a very acceptable alcohol level, no bitterness and about half way through the clean finish actually begins to please the tastebuds. I will not stock up cases for aging, but I will be more than happy to run out of Total Wine with another four pack."

"All in all a good example for a Triple, but it lacks in depth and the drink-ability is reduced due to the in my opinion unpleasant aftertaste. I love Tripels and therefore I would drink this again if I do not find a better one."
""
"Overall a sweet, sugary, tasty tripel."
""
""
"O: overall? wow. i just dont know. very different than what i was expecting after the pale aged ale from petrus. i dont believe i'll buy any more of this type again, though."
""
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a huge white head. The aroma has a good bit of biscuit malt as well as a ton of floral and berry-like hop notes. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of biscuit and grain notes, with some floral notes. There is also a good dose of grass from the hops. The beer is not too sweet and the alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This isn't your typical Tripel. It's a little thick with sweetness and very flowery for a Tripel. There are a lot of parallels between this beer and a Pils. There are some spices in there, but it's muted. Interesting, but not the best Tripel."
""
""
""
"Tasty blend of a beer."

"Okay, unlike the Blonde, they cop to bottle fermentation here. Now, if it is cloudy, I have no one but myself to blame. In spite of my gentle pour, I still got a finger of fizzy bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and both Midas and Croesus were licking their lips while Greg Koch again called me out as a ""wussy"". Just more for me, Greg! Nose had a duality of up-front malty sweetness underlain by a yeasty mustiness on the back side. The two melded nicely to produce a Juicyfruit-like sweetness with rich esters. Mouthfeel was medium and boy, was this sucker dry! Man, I felt like I had just sprinkled alum on my tongue. Shazam! Three beers later and I have finally hit upon a winner. Warming, I began to get hints of black pepper, probably from the yeast. The finish was literally breath-taking in its dryness. Much, much better than the previous two clinkers. I have a new recommendation for people as a result."
""
"Overall: Not my favorite tripel, but I do like the interesting yeast contributions, the hoppiness, and the dry finish. Good beer!"
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer. Not my favorite tripel, but different for sure. Lots and lots of honey. I love honey, so my score is getting a bit of a boost. If not for that, I think this tripel would be at best, average."
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is delicious. Lots of fruits, some spice, one of the better smelling beers I have had. Taste is good, but a little disappointing after the smell. There are fruits present, some malts and yeast, a touch of alcohol coming through. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality and easy drinking beer."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, kind of middle of the road. This is one of my favorite styles but this one is just not really grabbing me at all, and has a noticeable fault. Looks also a bit weak off the pour as well, certainly not a creamy head at all. I think I will most certainly pass on this again."

"O - I dig it. A very easy drinking triple with a well hidden ABV. Could use a little more when it comes to taste otherwise still a great triple."
"O: An awesome tripel, up there with the best."
"A Tripel that starts strong, but doesn't quite maintain greatness as it warms. Worth a try though"
"This brew poured out as a clear golden color, the head was big white and very fizzy. As it settles it leave a few bubbles along the glass and has a pretty good retention on the surface of the beer. The smell of the beer is full of grains, wheat and some spice on the nose. The taste of the beer is pretty good, up front there is some sweet wheat flavors with a touch of spice in there, then the aftertaste gives off some flavors of clove, lemon and oats. The mouthfeel is a really nicely carbonated and even had a light creamy texture to it. Overall It's a pretty impressive brew, I enjoyed this one."
"I can't help but think of malt liquor while drinking this. Not sure if I really like this beer or not."
"Overall: this is a tasty and well-crafted tripel. The aroma could use a little work, but the look is spectacular and the taste delivers for me."
"It is, in other words, a good beer, and well-deserving of the high ratings it's garnered. I'm not sure that it necessarily brings anything new to the table for a tripel, but it does easily rank among the better ales available in this style."
"Overall: Light and fruity just like some girls I have dated. This is a very one dimensional triple. Easy drinkability goes down smooth for the 7.5 abv"
"Blond almost transparent. Fort oxidized, much like a Pilsener. No flavor in the nose and still classic fruit flavors like banana tripel. Certainly very sparkling mouth but has absolutely no taste. Just a little spice, but without notable spices and aftertaste card and then that's all, or almost. To my taste it feels nothing at all. For a beer in this category is on the edge of outrageous. Limit to drink as a lager of low, but hey, there is still talk of a style triple."
"A great tripel with really lovely flavours. Falls short of true magnificence but it's a very enjoyable drop."
"jd"
"Large corked and caged bottle kept in the cellar for 2 years. Poured with some vigor and the taste was nicely mellowed but still with all the fruit that you expect from a tripple. Smooth finish but quite a bit of complexity in the midbody. Very good example of the style."
"O- A very nice brew, probably my favorite Petrus brew so far."
"O: Overall, not a bad tripel, though a bit plain. I feel like this might have been a better beer if it hadn't been so highly carbonated."
"Had this after eating some spicey burritos with red sauce on them."
"D - Very drinkable Belgian to me."
"D - Not bad, but not the best trip I have had. Decent flavor, but too much funk and not enough candy flavor or dark fruits."
"Beer is thin and watery with very little flavor, a little from the pilsen malt and the rest is just the esters from the yeast. It's drinkable but very unremarkable."
"Overall: A superior gourmet beer. I'd definitely recommend this for things like philosophical discussions, or poker games, but honestly I can recommend it for a marathon beer or even as a compliment for any kind of meals I can think of. That said, it'd go great with ice cream, or warm brownies, or something like that. I dunno, it's just too unique for a serious meal pairing."
"D: Gouden Tripel is a very solid but straightforward beer that has long-term drinkability."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark golden straw color with a very lively, big white head that is extremely slow to recede. The nose through this big fluffy head has notes of fruit like apple and pear but with a slightly sour tinge. Fairly sweet smelling as well. Medium/light mouthfeel. Surpisingly the taste doesn't seem as robust as the nose. Sweet almost chardonnay like flavors gives way to a muted fruit taste. Mild bitterness at the end as well. Ends pretty dry. The 7.5% is slightly noticeable but nothing too out of control. In the end, this is okay but I wold have preffered it a little more flavorful."
"M, D- Sweet and one dimensional. Could have used more CO2 to lift up the flat sweetness."
"Notes: Interesting beer that isn't exactly like other tripels I've had. Definitely a tart fruitiness in this beer. Some spiciness comes out as it warms to compliment the hop flavors. It just seems to be missing something though. I'm liking it a bit better as I drink it and I get a better understanding of it and as it warms; so the score could possibly go up a little. Somewhere in between a BSPA and a tripel is what this seems to be."
"O- Prettygood representation of the style... it is one of the top dogs in the lower class tripel category... It's no westmalle, urthel, chimay, or st. B, but it's pretty good simple tripel, making a pleasurable drink. I would drink it again if there wasn't a better tripel around."
"Cork lets off a huge pop! Pours a somewhat clear golden color with a HUGE white head. Smell is somewhat funky with a big floral nose. Some lemon zest as well. Taste is just like the smell. Very florally with lots of lemon and spice. I remember having this a while back and it being a little sour...this one is not sour at all though. Slightly funky aftertaste with crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is VERY carbonated and dry. Good for this particular style. Drinkability is fairly high."
"Opening the bottle is like opening champagne, it blows up before you can even set the cap down. Smell is like a sweet cider and cheeses, though not as cheesey as the dubbel but it still has hints of the cheese. The taste is like apple pie with a mild cheddar with a malty bitter finish. Color is gold with a thick foamy head. Its definitely an experience to drink."
"Explodes out of bottle (and is difficult to control with the foam everywhere, what's left is quite drinkable) with a five+ finger white head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Hazy light amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light bread, orange and hint of yeast nose. Flavor is caramel, bread and tart orange. $4.15 for a 330ml bottle (#39660) from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"D) I really enjoyed this well crafted, refreshing triple."
"D: A little different than most other tripels I've come across, but it works quite well (I think). I would have this again."
"D: The beer was relatively easy to drink and any traces of alcohol were very well hidden. I could easily have more than one of these in one sitting."
"Overall im pretty disappointed in this beer, I had high hopes for this beer and was let down. I would much rather be drinking a Chimay Blue for the same price..."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and rather enjoyable; just not what I would be looking for in a Tripel"
"Drinkability: A classic tripel with a moderate strength. Would pair well with a wide array of cuisine."
"This is a pretty good example of a triple, it's very authentic and true to it's country, but there is alot of competition for this style from waffle land. I would go for many over this one in a heartbeat. Very drinkable while being kinda forgetable. I just wish I could find some Petrus products on taps around town, i feel this could benefit from it."
"single from Whole Foods, Fair Lakes, VA"
"Slainte."
"39660 code...."
"From the bottle marked 39618. Sampled on February 13, 2010. It pours a hazy pale yellow with average clarity for an unfiltered ale and a lot of fizzy off-white head up top. The aroma is a nice balance of wheat, yeast, and citrus. The mouthfeel is in the medium range. The taste is full of unfiltered wheat, orange, or oither citrus with a light hoppy background. I thought it was fairly nice."
"Easy to drink, nice aroma, a little light in flavor."
"D Good despite ""the gush"" and all of its possible affects on this beer, I finished what was left in my glass without hesitation. 4.0"
"Pours to a cloudy yellow color, with a decent head, but it goes away about half way through the drink. Has kind of a barley character to it, that leafy, grainy kind of taste characteristic of barley. No heavy alcoholic taste, and rather smooth. Leaves kind of a bubbly feeling in the back of the throat."
"I'll won't pick up this beer again."
"A delicious and refreshing tripel."
"D - Fairly complex, a good beer overall. Almost trappiste-esque."
"If I ever see another one I'll re-review the beer!"
"I would purchase this beer again."
"However on that note this beer smells amazing. That of sweet hops, floweral tones and slight coriander. The taste of this beer is deep floweral and slight hops. The malt within it gives a bit of a biting edge. The aftertaste on the mouth is a sweetness. Overall a great beer to have with by itself or with dinner."
"mmmm mm mmm. Happy beer! Poured with a big, frothy if a bit soap bubbly, fragrant, yeasty aroma. Delightful. Lots of flavor, but not too much. good balance. Bittersweet; more bitter than sweet. Champagney. Great body. Excellent finish. Including its strength, still almost a session beer."
"D - This is an okay tripel. There are certainly better ones out there, though."
"D - Really not too impressed with this Petrus offering, in the past I have enjoyed their beers but this one doesn't seem to follow suit. The taste is somewhat bland, like it's not really trying hard enough, and as for the bottle conditioning lark, I think it was more trouble than it was worth."
"I was quite pleased and surprised by this tripel. It's a style I usually like but for some reason had passed this particular beer by up to this point. That won't happen again, I'll make this a regular in my rotation."
"Unfortunately the age did show forth. I'd like to try a fresh bottle as it has potential to be solid, although probably not great. Drinks adequately for style."
"This is a tasty tripel. Its not the most complex tripel on the shelf. but its very quaffable. A nice thirst quencher, despite its 7.5% abv, during the hotter months. I will definitely be going back to this one regularly."
"750ml, corked & caged, champgage-syle foiled, and labeled as ""Petrus Gouden Tripel"". Gotta love the presentation. An assertive ""pop"" and then a light golden color with a thick soapy head that condenses into a rocky landscape. Smells of apples, pepper, and bubblegum. Tastes sharp, peppery...apples in the aftertaste. Nice but a touch....thin? The mouthfeel is soft, not noticibale really. Drinkability is good. Its a beer that doesn't grab your attention. It's the Honda Accord of beers."
"Rather drinkable, very light in flavor, though it has a bit of a tangy aftertaste. A decent beer, but for the price, and as a tripel, there are much better examples out there."
"this brew pours up a pale straw color with a nice bubbly white head. the nose is very graniy, sweet candy sugar, faint fruit in the backdrop, lemons are possibly those fruits, I also get notes of bubblegum! The taste is the same as the nose, tastes similar to Delirium Tremens. heavy carbo, medium bodied, a very filling beer indeed...."
"Beer is thin with hints of acetone. Very light bodied but easy drinking. this makes the beer."
"Drinkability: After getting past the pain of trying to get this damn thing out of the bottle and into a glass, it was quite a pleasant brew. However, with so many nice ones out there, not sure I wills eek this one out again."
"M&D: strangely, despite the monstrous fizzy explosion that ruins my drink and stains the table, the palate in stark contrast remains, at best, ""calm", if not flat!! Given a very mild presence of maltiness, the body relies on the yeastiness very much to strike a balance with the hoppy flavour. This is not a very complex or tasty Tripel (maybe because the yeast-explosion has clouded everything) overall, but somehow my taste-buds agree with the consistent, mildly spicy & bitter feature endowed by the omnipresent yeasts. I wonder what it's like if the beer comes in a much ""calmer mood""... hopefully better?"
"This beer pours with an impressive head into a Chimay goblet. The color is a very pale and underwhelming yellowish hue. The smell has little in the way of yeast, and almost has a rather tart smell. The taste taste has little malty sweetness. It has a serious lager-like flavor. Very crisp finish."
"I will probablly not buy another, unless some friend gives me a sip and I find out I had a bad bottle."
" Spot-on style-wise, and it delivers a very clean experience."
"Drinkability: It wasn't bad, but the overly high carbonation took away from what otherwise would have likely been a solid and very drinkable beer. Looked beautiful, but that came at a cost. One was more than enough."
"Not a very smooth drinking beer, or one that was very memorable. I'm glad I was able to try it, but won't be looking for this one again."
"D: An above average Tripel, but not much more than that. More complexity would be nice. Light body does make this beer go down easy."
"A good beer, but not as good as their Oud Bruin."
"I drank the bottle by myself (750ml) and felt that was the perfect amount."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is a medium-lighter bodied beer with lower carbonation than expected, yet it works for this beer. Aspects such as flavor and feel are not taken away from by the carbonation, rather they are emphasised by it. Without carbonation in the way it is able to get everything that one can perceive from flavor and feel. The finish is on the ""wetter"" side of semi-dry. This is a beer that I'd drink again, although, I'm not sure how I'd compare it to other tripels I've drank, I mean this one is still up in the air for me...I think a horizontal is in order for this one. Not one that I'm necessarily drawn to drink again, but then again I'd like to do a horizontal with it with some of the better/best tripels I've drank thus far. Good beer, but for me, I can't really put a finger on it, can't really give it a rank or place."
"Grainy and toasty, dry and softly sweet, it has fruit, funk, medicine, and spice. Moderate carbonation. Slightly nutty malt. More dry than sweet, given the subtle notes of alcohol and phenols. Finishes a little funky and dry. Tastes pretty good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"highly drinkable. The taste and mouthfeel are soft enough that I finished the glass significantly faster than anticipated. If in the right mood, this one could be almost infinitely drinkable. Not the best tripel in the world, but a great take on the style, and definitely worth trying at least once."
"For such a light beer, it hides the 7.5% very well."
"D: On the whole, this is a solid, but somewhat uninspired beer. Drinkable, but not spectacular."
"I was really hoping for more from this bottle. Unfortunately it was just too malty for me to truly enjoy it. I will probably give it another shot down the road as it is pretty reasonably priced for the 750 bottle."
"Pours out a hazy yellow brew with super foaming head..Super carbonated.Smells to me like a hefeweizen,,clovey and banana notes.No hops smell that i can distinguish. Estery slightly tart,,good beer. Tiny bit watery mouthfeel. A pretty drinkable Tripel."
"From a 750cl bottle poured into a tall Petrus stem glass. Nice head settles down to white blanket over a cloudy golden ale. Citrus scent and a good deal of carbonation make this a crisp refreshing drink that I put down fast. Seems somewhat less complex than many Belgian tripels I've had. Aftertaste is (dare I say it?!) like a Bud."
"I had the opportunity to get a glass of this and could not resist. This is my favorite tripel. There was nothing not worth the purchase of this one. The beer looked golden brown in the glass and tasted light liquid heaven. The bubbly mounthfeel was similar to champagne and the taste remarkable. I started to use this about a year ago as instead of champagne at parties and the sparkling wine drinkers really took a shine to it."
"From a 750 ml bottle this poured a slightly hazy gold color with a huge white head and very pronounced lacing rings. Nose was ripe fruit like pears and apple. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is fruit like the nose with some plums to go with the pears and apple. Finish is somewhat dry. Nothing fancy, but quite drinkable."
"I poured the beer into a Chimay glass. It looked good. A great golden color and a nice, rich, firm head that took a long time to settle down. I didn't pour all that vigorously. A good smell to it as well. It was tasty, but a little hoppier than I'd expect for a Belgian triple. I could not detect the alcohol. Easy drinking."
"D: Scores ok overall for a tripel, but purely as a beer this is very drinkable."
"This bottle is too small! Quite drinkable and smooth, a little slick, but the mouthfeel overall is pretty solid. Not a world-class tripel but a damn fine tasting beer."
"Out of all the triples I have had, this one is right up there in the top 2 or 3. Delightful!!"
"Different label than the one pictured. It reads Petrus Gouden Tripel Ale and is black and yellow out of a 11.2oz bottle. Significant chill haze, golden pineapple in color with a two finger white head in a chalice. Nice boozy aroma of sweet malt, some candied fruits, pineapple, and orange. Nice citrus flavors, a bit of tart orange zest and lemon, slightly spicy, somewhat acidic and dry,and decent hop presence. Lots of carbonation, slightly crisp, but becomes more creamy as it warms. A nice example of the style, but there are much better Belgian Tripels to be had."
"Drinkability- Fair at 7%, however can be hard to locate."
"D: Very drinkable Tripel. Fairly complex. Smoothness disguises the ABV a bit."
"A satisfying beer but one that's lacking in the flavor department. I like the powdery finish but wish there was more there to back up the look, scent and feel."
"The taste is a little dry with an alcoholic quality, a spritziness, bland taste of old plums and weak white wine. It is very bland and steadily gets more so."
"Drinkability is high here. It reflects what a triple should be. I like it."
"2008 bottle, poured into a Duvel glass. Not much 'pop' when the cork is pulled, but it pours with a very large inch-thick head which lasts a long time. The color is golden, a tad hazy. The aroma has a nice dry, dusty fruitiness, reminding me of unpeeled pears. Not an extremely hoppy tripel, but an interesting one: initial soft fruity yeast character gives way to a delicious, thirst-quenching tartness. A moderate bitterness dries things out a bit and adds a spicy touch. The finish is dry and acidic."
"Drinkability: If it wasn't for the kick ass appearance and aroma, then this would have been a disasterous Belgian beer. I guess the appearance and aroma took all the energy out of the taste and mouthfeel. I would buy it again just to get a another glimpse of the beer and smell the sweet scent of sour fruits! The taste? Not so much. Buy to smell!"
"D: Average per style not much layering, just a straight forward flavor. much better out there."
"Easy to drink and somewhat refreshing, not at all betraying the relatively high ABV."
"Highly recommended!"
"Tripels, mmmm, always tasty. A prolific white head dwarfs this cloudy orange brew, sticking around and almost wearing out it's welcome and leaving a streaky and inconsistent lacing behind. Nose is very complex with sweet bread, yeasts, pears, grapes, big malts, butterscotch and a bit of phenols in the end. Taste does not live up to the complexity of the aromas, but gives you a good hit of clean fruits and malts which are blended for a fairly good palate pleasing experience. As mentioned, the carbonation is huge in this medium bodied brew. Mouth-feel is fairly smooth, but not as creamy and inviting as some of the other top-tier tripels. Overall a good drink which has some big shoes to fill."
"Overall: What can I say? Wonderful. Great with lemon coconut macaroons. Great with anything at anytime (not really, but I find this stuff incredibly satisfying.)"
"Dense white froth caps an orange-golden body, with light lacing on the Ommegang glass. Nice aromas, full of fruit and a slightly farmhouse smell of grassy hops. Delicious fruit in the taste--apricot, apple, peach, and berry--with moderate malt; sweet without cloying. Rich carbonation typical of so many good Belgians without being overbearing. This is an easy-going brew, delicious if fairly straightforward. Not tops on my list of Tripel, but pretty good."
"Pours light golden with a big fizzy head. Smell is light bright faintly spiced malt. Taste is sweet and malty with some notes of honey. Light spicing and belgian yeast character. Not bad, but nothing too unique either."
"Pours a clean golden yellow/ orange-ish colorwith a white head. In the aroma, a small yeastiness, and a small candied sugar smell. In the taste, small maltiness and small yeastiness, also a hint of fruitiness. A small bite, and a bigger bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry, small fruitiness in the aftertaste. Great triple, nice yeast and fruity presence."
"This poured an almost uncontrollable head. I had to stop to let the head calm down. The nose was somewhat fruity, musty, grains and hoppy. Taste was rather involved. Tart fruits, hops are the main thing going on here. Grains(mainly corn) is also present and I don't find that appealing for a tripel. It was a tad on the strange side at first. Mouthfeel was bubbly. Below average for a Belgian beer."
"Finish is long and medium sweet."
"Petrus pours a opaque gold with a fluffy three finger head. At first I could smell hops and light malts, but then after a bit I could really pick up some citrus. The taste was a well balanced mix of hops, honey, light malts, and citrus flavor. It is a lighter beer and with that said I felt that it was a bit more refreshing than your darker beers or ales. Very good beer to have w/ Mexican food. Easy to drink!"
"A fantastic beer, extremely drinkable and delicious. However, I'm not quite sure the Triple label is the best description of the beer. I can't really hold that against it, however."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-yellow color. The head is a massive, three inches in height, and recedes very slowly into tink chunks of lacing. The aroma is of citrus, lemons, and earthy yeast. It is a nice aroma, but it is very faint for a tripel. The taste has the same lemon, citrus, funky yeast characteristics as the aroma, but they are somewhat stronger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could drink again."
"Out of the several Petrus brews I've tried, this is undoubtedly one of the best... From an 11.2 oz bottle copped from Gary's Wine in Madison, pours a thick, hazy, cloudy appearance with incredibly huge frothy, foamy head... straw-colored, yellow appearance leads to an aroma full of clovers, fruit, and yeast... strong, rich flavor with bananas, citrus, grapefruit, and lemons bursting through... ultra-thick and rich mouthfeel... creamy taste with good drinkability lead to an all-around outstanding brew... definitely my favorite Petrus sample so far... really good stuff... top-notch, and certainly enjoyable... Really worth a try..."
"11.2 oz. glass bottle- color of pale yellow, with a thick frothy white head - nose of yeast, crisp, light spice, light colored fruit, and semi floral  taste of yeast, crisp, light spice, light sour fruit, and semi floral - body is medium, semi acidic, and with high carbonation  aftertaste of yeast, crisp, light spice, acidic"
"Pale straw color with a massive billowing head. Lots of carbonation apparent in the glass. Yeasty, boozey, smell with a slightly breadyness to it. Taste is very lacking. Bland and stale tasting. A slightly boozey finish. Aftertaste is nonexsistent, did I just drink a beer?"
"Pours a cloudy gold with a huge white head. Nose is slightly hoppy with a lemon zest edge. Flavor is almost slightly bitter though very consistent. Feel has a thicker carbonation to it. Its pretty drinkable due to its smooth and even taste, though because it doesnt stand out and is calm in the flavor department, I have to lower the score for that one."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans le style triple"
"An odd tripel, noticable hop character, slightly vegetal.... reminds me of a biere de garde actually..."
"Drinkability- Worth trying."
"Part of a ""suitcase"" gift pack, served in a Duvel tulip. Huge frothy white head with opaque golden color. Pleasant yeasty aroma. Taste is quite fruity, and a little yeasty; a nicely done tripel. Quite drinkable, with little hint of alcohol. An enjoyable brew."
"Overall: OK, of the 6-bottle multipack, apparently Ive saved the best for last, at least my favorite for last. Several of the other Petrus brews in the pack played extremely fast and loose with style, but this one is spot on. Not the best tripel Ive had, but good nonetheless. The only downside for me is the price; roughly 4 bucks for a 33cl is too steep for beer of this caliber, IMSHO."
"D: I didn't like this beer at all, and I am usually a fan of Belgian ales, when I'm in the right mood. Thumbs down."
"D: 1-2 tops in any one sitting. One that I woudl visit every now and again."
"A decent sipping brew, and worth trying, but not one of the most flavorful or complex of the style to come out of Belgium, IMO."
"D - Sure it goes down great if you want something super sweet, but if you're looking for a proper tripel you'll be disappointed."
"Overall: one of the better Petrus beers Ive had. Im a big Trippel fan and this one isnt half-bad. One of the cleaner ones Ive tasted."
"D: This beer is lacking severely in flavor. Pass in a big way if you see it in the store."
"I would go on, but it's not worth it. Skip this one."
"This is a decent triple...but doesn't hold up to the best at all."
"-Oelergud"
"Taste is a bit wild, with some characteristics of wild yeast, at least some barnyard and horseblanket, but in a very moderate way. I can also taste some cork, which obviously isn't in there. Mouthfeel is dry and slightly sticky. There is a mild bitter. A good balance, but for me it wasn't fresh enough."
"Poured a hazy pale golden color. Massive carbonation and the beads swirl to the top to form a huge pillowy head that is stiff and bright white like meringue. Appetizing doughy smell along with a winey white grape smell with green apple rounding it out. Fresh apple taste with an astringent and low level metallic taste. Thick lacing is left behind as the glass empties. Aftertaste is drying but sweet. Very smooth and not burning or acidic like some lesser examples. Slick, smooth mouthfeel with prickly carbonation at first. Decent drinkability with lower ABV. Probably still not sessionable. Pick it up if you have never tried it before."
"A decent tripel all-around, and certainly drinkable. A solid example of the style."
"Overall: Not as strong as most triples, still enjoyable though."
"A bit of estery fruit sweetness, a bit of sour...well blended and on-top of a strong malt base. Finishes dry and the soft flavors are resilient for some time. A respectable Tripel from Bavik."
"Not very complex, but still quite good."
"D: DO NOT DRINK THIS CHILLED. It has an olive oil or olive brine flavor that totally (I mean TOTALLY) disappears after it warms. Chilled, it tasted like olive oil and white wine and that, as Alton Brown might say, is not Good Drinks. Served at a proper temperature, the beer is a bit oaky and vinous for a tripel, but isn't terrible. Still, I have Westmalle and Chimay Cinq Cents easily available near me, and won't be reaching for this again so long as that keeps up. I'd put it squarely in the second-tier of tripels."
""
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, but I feel that I am not doing it justice by reviewing such an old example. I would like to try it again fresh, and of course, preferably in Belgium. It has a good flavor, but is a bit heavy for this style even at only 7.5%ABV. My score is going to be a bit lower now due to the age of this example, but the jury is still out for when I can get me hands on a fresher example."
"I thought the ale would be great on tap as well as with fat cold cut laden sandwiches this fall at the various college games where I be tailgating."
"Robust, coarse carbonation coupled with a peppery zest lead off on the palate. Sweetens as it warms, but the black pepper dominates throughout along with something vaguely spicy. My least favorite of the Petrus offerings so far, this is a tad too coarse for my taste. Flavors aren't bad, and they are fairly well balanced, with the alcohol entirely masked."
"I could see drinking lots of these at a time."
"Poured to a hazy golden color, with huge, white pillowy head that lingered through entire beer, and left excellent lacing. Fruity aroma, mostly apples, hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. Beer had the same fruity taste, and was very spicy to boot. Finish was syrupy and sour, but good. Although this was a different tasting beer, I really enjoyed it."
"Bavik produces a very basic, but clean and well-brewed tripel under the Petrus brand name. It pours a clear yellow-gold body beneath a creamy head of bright-white foam that seems to hold forever. The lacing is pretty incredible as well, with high walls of bubbly but solid froth. The nose is limited to some yeastiness with an edge of fruitiness over a lightly sweet and wheatish graininess. In the mouth it's medium-light bodied and gently effervescent with a somewhat elevated, natural carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma suggests without much more: yeast enters at the front, followed by some slightly tart but mild red fruit; and then some mildly sweet hay-like malt appears before it finishes with a flourish of yeasty acidity (with a spritz of lemon), a flick of flinty bitterness, and a smear of leafy and spicy hops that linger along with some mild alcohol. Overall it's a pretty decent, straight-forward tripel; but there are so many more complex versions out there that it hardly seems worth the effort."
"The mouth is dry and spritzy with plenty of carbonation. A solid example of trhe style and a good choice when looking for a Triple that doesn't have a lot of alcohol."
"Definitely Recommended, Cheers!"
"Thanks to my buddy Pat for this beer. Poured a huge, froathy, brilliant white head that faded slowly. Pungent, sharp hoppy aroma is mildly spicy. Beer is amazingly clear, pale straw in color, and fulling of bubbles making a break for the surface. Crisp flavor tastes like there is a bit of wheat in there, a good dose of yeast, and some smooth noble hops. Light mouthfeel with a big dose of carbonation that makes it almost fizzy. Reminds me of a tamer version of the double pilsners I've had. Tasty, crisp, and enjoyable. I can't ask for much more."
"While not the tripel to end all tripels, this is a mighty fine beer for the low, low everyday price of $2.79. Would pair well with a big hunk of aged white cheddar."
"medium, smooth, plenty bitter. this is a solid 4.0 beer for me. good. nothing compells me to knock points off, or bump up to 5. a pretty standard tripel, but it's a style i really like so i'll probably get this again."
"Very mellow brew with light citrus and malts intermingled with the yeast. Doesn't overly impress, but doesn't let you down. Very light mouthfeel leaving one rather refreshed."
"Pretty drinkable. Not the best , but sure worth a try."
"Pours out just fine and leaves a small lacing. Smell is very malty and it has a very flowery nose. Taste is about like it smells, very refreshing and enjoyable. It has a very malty taste to it and leaves a good sour taste on the palate. Feels great on the palate and it's aftertaste is good. I would definetly drink more of this later."
"A crisp tasting beer, some lemon, creamy, hops, malt. Tasted similair to a Chardonnay. Hops weren't very strong, but present. Light tasting and could drink a few more."
"D: Quite drinkable. Especially considering the strength."
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink. If nothing else, this beer is unique within it's style for combining elements of pilseners and Belgian ales."
"Overall a good beer, but pretty expensive. I'll try to get a fresher bottle next time."
"VERY pleasant beer to the eyes, nose and mouth. A very easy to drink beer on the drier side of the Belgian beer spectrum. I didn't really expect this to be one of the better Triples from Belgium, but it is completely free of any defects at all. Highly recommended for all."
"Beer 3 of the 6 from a Petrus gift pack and it pours a somewhat bemused gold with a bit of orange, the head is average and frothy the color a very light tan, after its decomposition the lace forms a fine covering upon the glass. Nose has hints of over ripe apples, orange peel and some sweet malt, very light this nose, start is a bit sweet with a pleasing grain profile, the top is middling in feel. Finish has a distinct acidic bite with a pleasing hop spiciness, quite dry aftertaste with a noticeable tummy warming from the 7.5 percent ABV, a nice drinking tripel."
"BB 03-05-06. Poors out with thick and lasting white head and a pale golden cristal clear beer. Nose is lots of koreander, litle green of hops and lots of yeastester giving ripe apple, anis, pale maltyness and some alcohol in the back. Taste is dry malty, litle tard, alcoholic, koreander, moderate bitterness and some sweet candy. Overall litle pale and ""average"" and bitterness hanging making mouthfeel ok but litle hard. Well drinkable but IMO seen far better example of this style."
"Well, it's easy to drink and pretty refreshing. But I'm not particularly impressed. Definitely didn't live up to the expectations brought on by the word ""triple"" on the bottle."
"Tramsparent light gold in colour. Smells of lemon, orange and spicy yeast. It has a huge head which lasted forever, and lots of carbonation. The citrus flavors continue with elments of minerals, and buttery malt notes. It's warming, but has no distinct alcohol flavor. A little thin in the body for my taste. Solid enough overall, but not as good as I had expected."
"This is a unique tripel. Some aspects of this brew are very fruit oriented, leading me to almost want to call it a fruit lambic. Poured out to a very nice clear golden color with a respectable head of about 1/4 inch after it settled down (intially, a very large foamy head immediately after pouring). High carbonation. I like what I see so far. Odor is very lambic like, with hints of peaches, sweet malt and some floral notes. Taste is nearly exactly the same as the smell. Flavors of sweet fruit, mild hops and malt, with a touch of sour-bitterness on the finish. Some weak pepper notes. Good mouthfeel was lighter than expected, but nonetheless nice. Higher level of drinkability, I would imagine new comers to the Tripel style would find this pleasing. I would drink this again, but i've got to say that if value was a category, this would get a 2. Very expensive, and not very deep. A rather one-sided brew. Still recommended, but i've had better tripels."
"A Tripel that gets eerily close to a Lambic. Brigtly straw color, may have some wheat. Lightly cloudy and frothy. Very active carbonation. Impressed with the white head and lacing. Smells lemony, grapefruity, and bready. Bold alcohol and sour notes. Tastes lightly sweet and boldly tart with lemons, grapefruit, and other citrus flavors. Gets a little astringent. Malts are more pronounced in the body, revealing more orange flavors and corriander and pepper flavors. High carbonation, tartness, and alcohol makes the beer appear thinner that it really is. finishes dry and crisp; almost abrupt. Not a bad beer, but more sour and tart than I expected from a tripel."
"If not for the unusal mouthfeel issue, this would be a nice brew. As is, it needs to either be served cold so as to reduce the foam, or let to sit for so long as to reduce the flavor characteristics to be a good drinker."
"Drinkability- Refreshing as hell. Wonderful summertime beer. Wasn't exactly to tripel guidelines, but was tasty, smooth and yummy."
"8.4 ounce bottle. No freshness dating spotted."
"Appearance was decent with a meaty white froth lacing with every gobble. Lots of carbonation and a yellow clear brew. An odd apperance for such a strong brew. I liked this triple overall. It surprised me how much flavor it has considering the appearance. A nice trick the brewery has learned over time. It tastes like it should be brown in color and full bodied but it still gets the taste with a light appearance. I got a metallic type aftertaste that was annoying and the carbonation was a bit overkill....Bavik is a solid brewery. A bit pricey but worth it for a nice pre-dinner type brew."
"Very drinkable triple. Will definitely try again,"
"Hazy gold pour with surprisingly lame head for a Belgian brew. Aroma of bananas and honey, marred by a distinct mustiness. Taste is 'koyaanisqatsi', that is to say out of balance. Honey, metal, coriander and apple all muddled together as if dumped unceremoniously in an old pail. The more I taste, the less I want to. Possibly the worst Belgian ever... I am unable to finish this. Avoid."
"This pours with a huge head. After five minutes, it disipated to about a finger and a half, with lace still sticking from where the foam met the top. The beer colour looks more like a European lager or Czech pilzner than it does an ale. Clear gold. Actually, when I put the glass close to my eyes, their is a bit of cloudiness. Classic, sweet Belgium pale ale smell. Big malts, bread, honey, light cloves, bananas and some bubblegum. Taste is a bit stronger than scent, with big bold malts dominating the palatte. Honey and banana mingle together in the background. And all this while, their is a light buttery taste. The mouthfeel is dry, but a bit flat. This is my second bottle, and I noted the first bottle seemed flat as well. Drinkable? Sure. Though the flat mouthfeel injures drinkability a bit."
"Pilsener gold, almost, the notable feature is a sparkling effervesence and a large, frothy white head that lasts and lasts. Lively and more spicy than I remember, with some honey sweetness rounding it out, this is nonetheless a little plain for a tripel, lacking heavy fruits or a creaminess. Similarly, the flavor and mouthfeel are dominated by a zippy, crisp malt and hop spiciness that are straighforward. A bit of pear and pepper in the flavor, but really, this is pretty one-dimensional."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Begins with the honey sweetness and mild fermented graininess then opens up to reveal a ""larger than it should be"" tart, appley center. Finishes with a brush of hoppiness and a sweetbread-yeasty warming alcohol that grows after the swallow. Mouthfeel is broad in its presence, but could stand to be a little less active and a little more creamy. Drinkability is slightly above average, but could be smoother."
"This beer possesses none of the outright vanilla and fleshy, sweet fruit of Tripel beers from St. Bernardus, Affligem, Westmalle etc. Perhaps the closest comparison is Chimay Tripel -- or a Saison..."
"It has a sudsy mouthfeel, too light for a tripel. The end result is rather refreshing, due to the tartness and the hop bite, but overall a disappointment."
"ok, but i will not buy it again for $2.80 a bottle."
"This beer kind of strikes me as a ""beginners Belgian"". Pours a cloudy dark yellow color with a thick and foamy white head. Decent lacing. Champagne-like aroma with some fruit and yeast. Medium-bodied with a pleasantly fruity flavor, along with some yeast, pepper and light hops. The finish is citrusy and lightly spiced. The beer is well done, and despite not being very complex it is a pretty tasty brew."
"Overall, Petrus Triple is pretty quaffable but not what I'd consider a top-tier example of the style."
"Drinkability and Overall: Odd. This is an odd tripel. Not the best, not the worst, but odd. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this beer. It's unique, so I'll give it points for that... but was it enjoyable? I'm not quite sure. Would I have another? Again, I'm not quite sure. Interesting though."
"Huge fluffy white head, cotton like. Body is a tad cloudy, pale yellow. Aroma of peaches, walnuts and malt. Sweet fruit, bitterness mid sip. Lots of malty sweetness. Tremendously carbonated, effervescent and a tad zesty. A unique, dry aftertaste. Pretty decent beer."
"It poured a wonderful honey gold. With plenty of sediment to give it a wonderful haze. It had a fingers of medium to rocky head that stayed. The aroma was sweet and fruity with a dash of tartness, sort of watermelon citrus promising a wonderful mixture. The taste was very unlike the aroma, but was very good. Extremely malty, the beer has a smooth almost syrupy taste to it. It has a very mellow banana taste to it, that has a real alcohol bite. The aftertaste is almost pure malt. The feel is incredible. It is a heavy creamy beer that has a lot of body and carbonation. I had been sitting on my last bottle of Petrus Old Bruin and now I can say I have found a more readily available alternative."
"All and all a very good tripel. I rather enjoyed this one, as a note it went very well with German sausages."
"The aftertaste lingered pleasantly for a quite a while."
"There's a big, bumpy, thick white ice cream head that leaves thick sheets of lacing. A hazy, slightly orangey, gold beer. Smell is spicy, soapy, nutty. The front is nicely bitter, with an almost sour tangy fruit. More tangy fruit in the fizzy middle with a big, bitter finish: alcohol, a little nutty and spicy. Flowery aftertaste. It's a nice beer: very fruity, tangy, spicy. But it doesn't have the creamy, buttery, sweet, thick goodness of the tripels I've really liked. To be fair, it gets a little milkier and sweeter with temperature, but it still rates second-string for me."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent with fruity Begian yeast. It is dry and tart. The taste is good also. It has a rich pale malt flavor with a slightly warm aftertaste that is tart and quite fruity. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good drinking triple. It is light and flavorful."
"Pours a clear gold color with a towering huge-bubbled head. The head has excellent retention and leaves loads of thick draping lace. The aroma is pleasantly sweet with lots of candy sugar and citrus notes. The flavor is very citrusy and light for a triple. It has a more tart, lessy malty profile than triples Ive tried. The mouthfeel is thick and prickly. This is quite a dry interpretation of the style. It could be a little more complex."
"A bit creamy, but little douginess and yeastiness for a triple. a prominent metallic wateriness that didn't prevent drinking but left an unsatisfying aftertaste. Some spice, lemongrass and corriander, berries not too alcoholic. Too malty sweet. Reasonable nice lacy appearance."
"Petrus Triple is a fine beer and is a more than respectable version of the style. Since the bottom of this rather dainty 8.4 oz. bottle came too quickly, I'll have to find another or three."
"On tap at the Gingerman NYC. Poured almond, semi cloudy, white head, tightly bubbled with well developed lacing. Nose of Peaches , toast and bubblegum. Alcohol noted, slight sourness/tartness, nutty center, unusual triple. The sourness was abit offsetting. Worth a try but not my favorite triple."
"250 mL brown bottle with best before date clearly marked on the front label."
"Poured a milky gold with a 4 finger tight frothy head reminiscent of a Duvel cap...very pleasing...very lively in the glass for an abby..again. more like Duvel in appearance. Sweet spicy smells to it...not as much citrus as tart pears or apricots. Starts very tart and zesty like a pilsner but hen the nicely layered malt body is revealed to the tongue....finishes dry....very much like Duvel....is it a clone? No it has its own distinct taste."
"I would like to start by saying that I love tripel beers, and have been trying them at every opportunity. And I was really disappointed by this tripel. Poured a light yellow, pale and weak with chunks of white yeast floating around. Unlike any other tripel I have ever seen. Medium sized head dies off quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is very sour, I am unable to smell anything else. Flavor is off, earthy, yeasty, not good. I would think the bottle had turned if the color wasn't so strange as well. Makes me think that this beer is brewed on some other way than most tripels. I could not finish this beer."
"Fares poorly when compared to other Belgian Tripels. This is not one that I would try again."
"This brew is a hazy orange color, with a good-sized white foamy head. Lemony and orangy scents. Fruity tastes dominate, belgian yeasts, some hop backbone. Seems kinda light for this style, however this is a nice tasting brew. Unfortunatly im not as happy as the monk on the label, but pleased enough."
"An interesting tripple. The bitterness is a touch more than I prefer, there is a rotten fruity character which I don't like in my triples, the mouthfeel is explosive, and the acidity is uncharacteristic for the style. There are much better (La Fin du Monde, New Belgium Triple, Golden Monkey), but this is still good."
"Enjoyable, worth at least a try."
"Bottle - Poured a pale yellowish brew with a nice head with good retention. Good carbonation with hoppy aroma. Taste is sweet with subtle alcohol. Overall, this is a good beer but not as good as the Westmalle Triple or Fin du Monde, it would have been improved with more complex spice mix and a bit more aged."
"$1.99 for 8.4 oz."
"Pours a dark yellow, honey color. Good head developed with very nice lace. Low carbonation though. Aroma is sweet white wine, spice and cloves. Taste is very sweet with minor spice on the back end. Has many of the characteristics of a trippel yet taste is much sweeter without the spice, carbonation and alcohol back end. Nice beer just doesn't hit the mark with me."
"A golden pour with a very generous, white, foamy head. Lots of bubbles going on here. The nose is light and floral with a champagne yeast hint. The mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish. The taste is mildly sweet with honey and has a nice warm alcohol dryness to it. A little light on the tongue but not to a fault. Overall a decent triple although not in the class of lets say, Westmalle."
"Drinkability is high however, because the flavor has enough tantalizing qualities to make me keep coming back for more to find if theres anything Ive missed. Before long, a Pint has gone down the gullet and Im not certain Ive tasted it all.. although this beer is really very light in both character and flavor."
"Taste was also to the citrus with a lemon lead and dry. Secondary impression was to the alcohol which seemed to linger."
" Carbonation is strong, but not overpowering, just enough to give you a little bite. The flavor has a nice sweet character as well as a bit of tartness from citrus. There is a bit more bread and yeast flavor to balance. The body is medium, but it is on the heavier side. Alcohol is well hidden, but you will know of its presence at times. It is a pretty good drinker as well. This is a pretty good one. It is really nothing out of this world, but it is a quality brew."
"Dusky pale golden hue. Steadfast, porcelain white head with soft peaks yields sparse, rounded lace. Notes of musty, raw honey and mild phenol upfront in aroma. Hints of a citric, lemon like acidity and peppery ethanol are secondary. White bread sweetness initially in flavor yields to a drying combination of hop bitterness somewhat above the norm and black licorice. Mellow, lemon drop like fruitiness persists. Lightly bodied overall, with a passably dextrinous, albeit slightly chalky mouthfeel. Gentle notes of clove surface late and couple with residual sugar to lend an herbaceous sweetness. Finishes a touch oxidized with hints of marzipan and paper, but otherwise lightly sweet and clean. A no frills tripel, with all the required elements, but no outstanding qualities. Harmless, soft on the palate and very drinkable. Enough with the 8 ounce bottles already."
"Gold color. Large head. Aroma is malty and fairly spicy. A medium bodied triple. Not very malty, mostly spicy and fruity. Peaches and apricots, with a strong spicy character. Somewhat lemony and grassy. Very dry character. High and lively carbonation. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Comments  Their Aged Pale offering capitalized well on the stingy, sour malt flavor of this brewery, but here it just didnt belong."
"A beer with a lot of character.It poured a medium sized white creamy, frothy head that consisted of fine-medium sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was dense and uncarbonated.The hue of this beer was pale yellow.The nose was fruity and it had a fruity, sweet, tart, tangy and sour taste to it.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth and medium bodied.The lacing with this beer was very sparse."
"There are so many great Belgian beers that are available that when I have a mediocre or poor one, I can only advise people to not buy it."
"This beer pours with a white head that disappears quickly. It is a hazy straw color. Smells of cheddar cheese, a hint of alcohol, and of lightly funky socks. Tastes lightly sweet, with a slightly peachy flavor, followed by a cheesy after taste. Fairly light bodied, which is on style for a tripel. Some astringency that finishes the beer off. I am not sure that this was the freshest sample, but I sort of liked the cheddar notes that I found in this beer, it added a bit of character that I found lacking in some of their other brews."
"Golden in color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is of pear and coriander. Taste is very sweet, almost like a pear cider. Finishes with a slight citrus taste. The taste is very impressive, but a little too sweet for a tripel. I actually find it hard to believe they achieved this taste without using cider ingredients."
"A very nice beer and very drinkable."
"Pours a hazy mid-amber/orange color. The thick, beautiful white head clings to the sides of the glass and shows excellent retention. The aroma is very malty, with subtle hints of yeast and coriander. Maybe a hint of orange peel in there as well. Wow, what a great aroma. The taste is defninitely a triple, with a good spiciness, alcohol and malt sweetness, and a smooth, slightly bitter finish. Lingering spice on the aftertaste is nice. But there's also a subtle and unusual citrus/sour component that really cuts the sweetness of this beer. The mouthfeel is very nice, with a very fine carbonation bouying the solid malt backbone on the tongue. The drinkability is very good, from the flavor to the finish, mouthfeel to ABV. Possibly one of the more drinkable triples I've had, as it isn't going to last much longer than the time it takes to write this review. I can see why the monk on the bottle is so happy. This is simply a terrific beer. I must make some space for this one on a regular basis."
"This beer poured a darker amber color. The smell was fairly malty, with very little sweetness noticable. The taste was fairly dry....drier than all the other tripels I've had. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth. I could have a couple of these, although I prefer a bit more sweetness myself. Still, a failry good selection to give a try!"
"I ordered this beer at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse to complement my Chimay cheese plate. Wow, I never thought cheese could be that complex, but hey what a great pairing with beer. Anyway this beer appears a vibrant glowing gold with an orange tint to it, along with a bright white foaming head. Aroma is huge malty sweetness with great carmel tones, and definite touch of alcohol in the aroma. The taste is full of ester fruit tones that are trademarks of Belgium tirppel ales, but this one is not overly sweet or to overempowering in any way a beautifully balanced beer. Nicely carbonated with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel what an extraordinary beer. Yes, it is way too drinkable I could chill with this beer anytime, awesome."
"The little bottle bothered me. If it's good, please put it in a 22oz instead of a little 8.4 oz please. Nice yellow color, good carbonation. It had a good crisp taste, although the ABV was quite prevalent. Could have used more hops. Overrall, a good beer."
"I had this on tap at Lucky Baldwin's on the Pasadena pub crawl. Based on reviews, I'm assuming that this beer is better out of the keg than out of the bottle. It has a nice refreshing citrus smell with a hint of peach or apricot. The flavor is somewhat light for a tripel, but it's thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. In addition to a flavor a little on the light side for the style, the mouthfeel was just slightly on the thin side. However, it's a very drinkable tripel. Overall, a very nice beer on tap."
"Comments  well, I would like a more spicy character & dimension to this Triple beer and perhaps a stronger nose. Nevertheless, these are only personal wishes and do not detract from an overall solid beer. I would purchase it again for sure, and I often do when in Belgium."
"Overall a very nice Triple and IMHO one of Bavik's best brews. I would like to see a little more complexity in the aroma and a better blending of the citrus and spice flavors with the malt."
"Very impressive tripel by the Brewery Bavik. This beer pours a golden colour topped by an impressive thick white head. The aroma consists of citrus. The taste of this fine tripel was of citrus and moderate hops. Excellent carbonation and heavy mouthfeel. Very impressive tripel"
"Big head, but not out of control. Bright golden body writhes with steaming bubbles. Aroma is Juicy Fruit, lemon peel and a time bit of spice. The flavor is slightly tart. Unlike most triples, you can actually taste the dry, hay-like malt. Usually yeast byproduct flavors overwhelm the malt. The finish is dry and short. The flavor is a bit mild but bright and easy drinking. The mouthfeel has a distinct bite to it."
"This is a super well-carbonated beer. Even poured slowly, you'll get a big, frothy white head. Color is medium-gold and only slightly hazy. Aroma is yeasty at first, but this soon gives was to a very tart, acidic, citrusy smell. A bit shocking at first -- not at all what I was expecting for the style -- but pleasant, and a nice contrast to the flavor of the beer, which is rather mellow in comparison. Citrusy notes are still there, but the taste is more sweet than tart. Hops are noticeable but there are a lot of spices trying to make themselves notice in this beer. Somehow, they all add up to a fairly pleasant, dry finish. Effervescent and light-feeling in the mouth, with a somewhat yeasty aftertaste. A good beer. Not what I expected from a triple, but a nice surprise."
"Smallish 12 oz bottle, green and gold foil label. Monk holding his beer on the label. Cloudy golden color, always with a rich creamy full off-white head. Smell is somewhat citrus dominated with a hint of yeast sourness to match. Taste is a crisp combination of citrus, light hoppy resin, then great belgian yeasty goodness to finish. Crisp, dry, and refreshing finisher. Great beer to have with lunch, I like to match it with an oven roasted turkey and cheese. One of my all-time favorite beers. I can't believe this is only the 4th review of it."
"This beer poured a nice golden color and formed an amazing white head which left some nice lace.  Heavy, lovely amount of carbonation common to this style(level similar to a champagne.  It had a citrus aroma with a slight element of hops.  The taste was of hops and citrus.  The finish was a bit foamy and slightly tart.  Nice beer."
"The golden body is a bit hazy, but still very appetizing with a big, frothy, white head.  Tart citrus dominates the nose.  The flavor is clean, crisp, and rather dry.  Malt flavor is clean, with citrusy hops undertones.  Carbonation gives a lively mouthfeel to this Triple.  Combined with the clean taste, it creates a very refreshing brew."
"Hazy gold color that cleared up as it warmed. Nice thick white head.  Pretty good head retention and carbonation, visible well after pouring.  Clean citrus/fruit nose. Only slight hint of hops.  Clean, crisp and dry.  Very refreshing."
