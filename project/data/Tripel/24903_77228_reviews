"Overall, it's very disappointing from the initial characteristics.  Another swing and a miss from this brewer.  I try to like them but I just don't."

"Purchased from the bottle line at Hill Farmstead for around $12.  Poured into teku glasses and shared.  A hazy dull yellow with a persistent tight white head of fine bubbles.  Aroma is at first funky and barnyard followed by lemon, yeast and reminds you of a nice Napa chardonnay.  Taste is delicious with light citrus, buttery white wine, tropical fruits and yeasty bread.  Mouth is medium body, medium-high carbonation, and well-hidden ABV.  Overall, this is a fantastic bretted triple....a very unique and pleasant beer."

"Overall, this beer is very flavorful. It's complex and it's quenching. I love brett's and I loved this beer."
""
""
"Flavor is moderately lemony, with sweet pear esters, and a light musty funk. The brett is fairly restrained, allowing the Belgian esters to shine."

"O- While I sometimes don't like the way a Chardonnay barrel transforms a beer, this one is quite enjoyable due to the nice Brett tones.  It's not the best use of Brett I've seen in an Anchorage beer, but overall it's a well done Tripel."

"The bar has been set for Bretted out tripels.. This beer is amazing ."
""
"Overall: I think this has aged a little too long. Quite a mellow beer dominated by Brett with white wine and a basic tripel following it in a very back seat role. I don't get a lot of bold, flavorful, complexity I was hoping for. Feels fairly muted."
""
""
"O-This is a great beer. I love tripels, but I usually prefer more traditional examples of the style, e.g., Karmeliet, than modern, funky barrel-aged brews. This beer may change my opinion. The flavors here are complex, subtle, and manage to work well with each other to provide a nice overall package. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for the beer too. This would work well with food."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a barrel aged brett beer, it's for sure not a true example of a Tripel, but there's just enough tripel aspects coming through to let me know that this is what this beer started as, but over a year and half it's became a pretty unique beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was smooth, clean, fairly crisp, refreshing, not filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have any problem drinking a bottle by myself, it would make for a great beer to enjoy on the porch on a warmer summer day. What I like the most about this beer was the taste, aroma and drinkability, all three of those aspects seemed to be the highlights of this beer for me. What I liked the least about this beer is nothing, but I'm not a fan of not being able to purchase it in Michigan. I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I would love to try it fresh and I would also cellar some since it seems to hold up well with age. I would recommend this to anyone who likes brett beers, it may not be a big hit to most Tripel fans, but if you like them funky then you should like this beer. All in all I was impressed with this beer and I'm pretty happy I decided to trade for this one, it's for sure a beer worth seeking out. This beer made for a great first impression for Anchorage Brewing Company and I would really like to try more of their beers. So far this is my favorite funky Tripel, I like it more than Vivant's Tripel aged for a year. This is just a great beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. I don't normally pair beer with things besides food, but I decided to listen to the 36 crazy fists album this beer was named after and it made for a nice pairing. Great job guys, you can be for sure I'll be seeking out more you your brews, keep up the great work."
"Anchorage brewing has a winner here. I'm actually not the biggest fan of tripels so I'm glad this isn't heavy on the characteristics of that style. Very much an American wild interpretation and drinks more like an Orval, saison, fruity blond mix. So smooth and easy drinking, a bomber of this can go down so easy and get you on a high horse buzz if you don't watch it. Crushable tenish range abv tripel mockery all up in this bad boy..."

"brilliantly conceived collaboration from anchorage and dogfish head, given generously to me by a new friend. sorachi ace hopped triple in chardonnay barrels with brett, how perfect. the pour is hazy yellow, pale without much luster but a masive fizzy white head that hangs on for quite some time. the nose is really oaky and acidic from the wine, and a year has helped the brett do its magic, lots of funk here. the sorachi hops arent as prominent as i would like them to be, but i get the lemon without the bitter. taste is more balanced, but the wine still makes a big impact. wheat malt and maybe oats, this is the best of all three fermentation worlds, complexity is ripe. distinctly belgina in nature, but nuanced in a remarkable way. the hops finish beautifully with the brett, and while i have to imagine they have faded some, the balance found here is divine. finish is long too, zesty, funky, and memorable. beautiful carbonation and a lightness rare for its abv. i could drink this everyday, its like nothing else, a gorgeous combination of flavors and techniques here, a real work of craftsmanship."

"If I hadn't paid $17 for this bomber, I might be more apt to drink it regularly. I guess it's not a regular brew anyway. Anchorage to New Hampshire is quite a trip, i wonder what it tasted like a year ago?"

"Pours light grain yellow with brilliant clarity and a solid quilt of bone whites. Smells really nice with lemons, pineapple, grain, clay, a little green olive juice. Flavor doesn't disappoint - nice bitterness, some grass, some almost teatree oil and leather with a bit of metal. Thin bodied with hi carb and a wet finish. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is not a letdown after the excellent nose - glad to come across something like this every once in a while that you have never heard of and dont have any expectations. The brett is bold yet soft...melds with the malt so seamlessly. The wood and wine tartness is a perfect compliment to the tripel. The base beer tastes like it is pretty damn good in its own right - light grassy bitterness and delicate yeast is a perfect combination. Great beer. Buy it if you see it!"
""
""
"O: Definitely doesn't go light on the wine barrel presence, which obscures the base beer and the brett profile a bit. Perhaps it would benefit from less time in the barrel or a more seasoned barrel."

"750 ml bottle into chalice; Batch #1 bottled 10/2011. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange zest, pear, peach, pineapple, apple, pepper, clove, white wine, oak, herbal, floral, funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, peach, pineapple, apple, clove, pepper, oak, white wine, floral, herbal, grass, funk, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pineapple, peach, pepper, clove, oak, white wine, floral, herbal, grass, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast flavors with well balanced wine barrel presence; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian Tripel with Brett. Big complexity and balance of all flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"The only thing missing from this maelstrom is a kraken. Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy sunset auburn-brass topped by over a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, grapefruit zest, light lime zest, a hint of tart Chardonnay grapes, a touch of mild biscuit, and a stiff breeze of earthy Brett. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit more of that tart Chardonnay character. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I can't say this resembles a traditional tripel all that closely, but the bright citrus, tart wine, and earthy Brett all combine together into a very tasty melange. Screw style guidelines, this stuff is damn good."
""
""
""
"Overall - I bet if you took the brett out of this, it would be another mediocre American tripel. Brett helps this out a lot."
""
""
""
"This is an extremely unique beer. I've really tasted NOTHING else quite like it, what with the remarkable qualities provided by the brett and the chardonnay barrel fermentation. It's really a must-try, trail-blazing belgian ale, if you ask me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would say this is one of my new favorites in the tripel style, but it just doesn't drink like a tripel to me. The brett really dominates in a way that makes this one feel more like a saison than a tripel. Based on that, I have to dock the overall score just a bit, even though I really liked it. Either way an awfully tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot. Though I really dislike diacetyl, it's mild enough not to be a dealbreaker. If that particular trait doesn't bother you, though, this beer is absolutely well worth trying."
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a tasty Brett beer, funky and refreshing. I've passed this over at the store a lot and I'll be sure to get one if I see it on the shelves again. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a nice dose of Brett. (4.25)"
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied. Clean."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Cool beer. Couldn't pick up any alcohol and the Brett character was good if a bit too dominant."
""
""
"Not usually a huge fan of tripels but this one really hit the spot due to the earthy funk and tartness keeping the sweetness/alcohol in check. Feels satisfying and paired well with food (stuffed bell peppers in this case.)"
""
""
""
""
"O: Quenching, refreshing, and totally perfect on a late spring night. The only thing preventing even higher scores from this reviewer is that it wasn't the most ""complex"" drinking experience, with the yeast asserting itself so dominantly. That said, it tastes great. A treat, and not my last time."
"7.8/10"

"Batch #2. Poured in a snifter, the beer is a very bright, slightly hazed, orange-gold coloring with a thin, whispy film coating of white on the surface. Aromas of roast and earth softening the Belgian yeast characteristics, including cherry sweet and white wine grapes. Slight floral highlights on the nose, too. Flavors are very layered, with an initial blend of char, tobacco, and wood giving rise to a toasted grain backbone with floral and sweet highlights of cherry, some citrus, nutmeg, all-spice, and white wine grape. Very balanced, and very dynamic. Wow. The chardonnay/riesling grape characteristics blend into the aftertaste, with a dry, crisp feel in mouth. Dry, clean finish, with a slightly dry-sweet lingering. This beer, despite an elevated ABV, is a great sipper. Very smooth and very tasty."
"O: Holy cow is this good. Anchorage knows how to make some solid beers and this one is fantastic. it isn't your run of the mill tripel and the brett and chardonnay barrels brings an interesting side to things. Worth every penny and a must try."
""

"This one took me from eager anticipation to fear to delight in a matter of moments. The description on the bottle made it sound amazing, and the pour to a tulip only got me more fired up with such a strong golden color. However, when I raised the glass to my nose, I smelled ... chicken coop? It was a smell I hadn't really gotten that strong since my childhood on a farm, and I have to admit it was not a good memory. I was curious if it was a bad bottle, but order was soon restored when I tasted it. There were those familiar Belgian yeast notes, but in a faded, distant kind of way. They quickly gave way to the brett, but again not in as strong a way as in other wild-style ales. There was such a collaborative effort between the flavors, and it made for a fairly unique taste experience. Really enjoyed this, and would certainly buy it again."
""
"O: A very enjoyable beer overall. I love the combination of the Belgian tripel flavors/aromas with those contributed by the Brett and the Chardonnay barrels."
"O: This is definitely not your average tripel. The barrel and Brett character add quite a bit of complexity without overwhelming any of the base beer's characteristics. Quite expensive, but very nicely done"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a hazy golden color with a very nice white head on top. The retention is good as well as the lacing. The smell of the beer has a really good sweet and citric aroma, incredibly balanced. Really pleasant on the nose. The taste of the beer is really well balanced also, sweet maltiness with a great balance of Brett with a hint of spice as well. The mouthfeel is well carbonated yet soft, there is a slight creaminess to it, really nice. Overall it's very good, the addition of Brett adds a really nice additional element to the beer. Very good stuff."
""
""
""
"Tasty and complex. It could use a higher carbonation level and the hopping is subdued though. Perhaps batch 2 when it's fresh could be superior."
""
"Overall a nicely balanced beer. Nothing wrong, but nothing stands out either. Ultimately it is exactly what it is. A blonde tripel that highlights the brett."
""
""
""
""
"The body was on the light side of medium for the style, and was very dry, especially for a Tripel. Drinkability was excellent, if you dig the funk, and would be OK even if you weren't. Overall, a very nice brew. This is the first beer I've had from this brewery, and I look forward to trying more. A must try if you see it."
"Pleasant, but not quite as well harnessed as others in the same ballpark sort of 'genre' that I've tried."
"O: Very tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"D - Solid beer. Really like the Anchorage beers. Reminds me of some of the Flemish Primitive series."
""
""
""
"O: This one improved drastically as it warmed. The zest, tart, and oak came out of the glass, almost like an explosion, with a little bit of warmth and time. Loved the oak and citrus flavors that balanced the funk. Glad I got this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good. A nice twist on the tripel style. I had been looking for this one for awhile and, while I spent too much for it, I am glad I got to try it."
""
""
"O: The Brett ran away with this beer."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Pours a hazy light golden amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lacing, constantly refreshed by active carbonation. Aroma of light fruit, lemon, butter and wild yeast. Flavor of lemon, orange, brett, light malt, slightly vinous. Finishes with a hint of wood, dry tartness and residual yeast. Light to medium bodied with nice sharpness from the carbonation. Closer in style to an American wild ale than a tripel, with a very light touch of Belgian. Not my style, but enjoyable as a interestingly flavored, well made wild yeast influenced ale."
""
"Another great beer from Anchorage, although this one is a little less flashy than some of their others. Drinks much easier than 9 percent, which was well-hidden."
""
"(O)- This is a really great play in beer styles and combining ingredients together. Best way I can think of is a fruit forward Tripel mixed with Orval."
"O: Light, tart, zesty, fruity, estery. Classic tripel with a twist from the funky tart brett notes."
"O: Excellent."
"Cloudy pale gold topped by a big, pillowy head of froth. Flowery, sweet aromas over yeasty funk...lemon zest, wood, Chardonnay, light phenols, and a dusty tartness. A hint of vanilla bean as it warms. The flavor is initially surprisingly spiced upfront before melding with citrus, cedar, earth, and a white wine dryness. The Brett is, of course, quite noticeable and adds a nice musty/barnyard funk complexity to the mix. Fruity with a bit of grassy hop crispness. Creamy and soft, yet effervescent and quite dry. A slight warmth is growing in my throat, but this is dangerously drinkable. I like this a lot. It's hard to put this up against other tripels because of the Brett/barrel-aged qualities, but it's is a fine beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great balance and complexity. Delicious."
"Notes: Not necessarily a big fan of triples, but I'm a big fan of this one."
"O: I'm happy to have tried it, but it's not something I'll pick up again; at $15, it's not worth the premium over a standard tripel."
""
""
"Hazy pale blonde colour, ring of white head, lots of lace left behind here. Smell has lots of musty/funky brett up front, lemony and fruity citrus notes come through as well, malt and some buttery oak, yeasty and funky throughout. Big brett and vinious oak on the palate, funky and fruity, lemon, green apple, belgian yeast, some milder spicing for a tripel, a little bit of bitterness on the back end as well. Medium carbonation, medium-full body, nice feel. This is amazing stuff, very enjoyable and something I would love another chance at having."
""
"Pours pale gold with a smallish white head. Slight haze, probably just from some of the lees kicking up. Really nice bretty sour aroma. Lots of light stone fruit - apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums - shot through with funk and sour notes. Grass, pepper, earthy Belgian notes. Lots of oak. Taste starts with more fruity sweetness but quickly dries out and picks up spicy and sour flavors. There's a bit of booze to it. A little too tannic for my taste. The oak is strong. Funky, sour finish. Feel is light, but a bit boozy. A very good beer and an excellent and interesting take on the style. Unfortunately, it's a little too strong for the sourness, and the oak is just a bit much for me. Still, it's always great to try an Anchorage beer. Nothing but hits from that brewery, so far."
"Yup, another masterful addition from Anchorage to their already masterful range. The chardonnay I thought was subtle, but it turns out to be the defining factor of this beer the more you drink. It's a very interesting result."
"Golden orange with a voluminous white head. Sticky lace and moderate retention. Nose is floral, citrus, zesty, bretty, light oak sweetness and some grass. Taste is citrus, floral, bretty, citrus zest again. Quite complex. Lightly bitter, effervescent carbonation and medium light body, Delicious and complex, I could have this in my glass on any warm day (or any day of the year, really)."
"Overall: A nice twist on the tripel style that is growing on me. Wish I held onto the bottle a bit longer. Oh well. Still awesome after sitting in the bottle for a year. Now I have to be on the lookout for their other brews too."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with soft carbonation and a prominent barrel presence that adds complexity without interfering with the hops and wild yeast notes. Some charred oak along with vanilla and buttery white wine flavor which is countered by a dry, bitter pine presence and a strong, musty brett character. The wild yeast provides some dry, earthy funk that compliments the resinous hop flavor and gives balance to the tropical and vinous fruit sweetness. Underneath the barrel and wild yeast, there are hints of citrus peel, apple, pear and alcohol but the high ABV is well masked making this complex beer pretty quaffable. There is a lot going on here but the wine barrel, earthy hops and funky yeast notes are almost perfectly balanced resulting in another excellent beer from this brewery."
"Overall this is a great beer. If I had to find a fault with it, it would be that from memory I can't really tell the difference between this and the anchorage wit that I had a while back. There is nothing in this beer that screams tripel to me. With that said, if you like brettanomyces, this is like a nice complex gueuze, only not as sour."
"O - Kind of a hybrid sour- tripel, but really good and exceptionally refreshing."
"O: this is unique among tripels - I've had the bourbon barrel-aged tripel, the sweet fruity tripel, the tripel brewed with rice, etc. - but it seems the combination of brettanomyces yeast and barrel-aging produces a very distinct beer, which reminded me of an American wild ale blended with a Belgian strong pale ale - this was a rugged beer. You have to try it - but how you'll feel about the chardonnay barrel flavors with the brett influence is probably a matter of taste. I liked it, and while partial to the Curieux-, Karmeliet-, and Westmalle-style tripels, this beer definitely has an elegance of its own."
"Been looking forwards to this one as i do love a nice brew aged in chardonay barrels and it pours a hazed golden hue which leaves a creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere very nice looking,the smell is barnhouse funk,sweaty socks,floral hops and fresh mandarins,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,oily and a touch dry with tastes of bready belgian malts,funky barnhouse sour yeast,peaches,floral bitter earthy hops,brett,mandarins and finished with a funky sour dryness and overall its a nice drop with a beautiful touch of Brett to give you that funky sour dryness and with the weather like it is today its definately i could drink more than one bottle of cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: To say this is a complex beer is an understatement. There's a lot going on here, and it's all very, very good. It's a sipping & thinking beer, not one to have while you're mindlessly eating peanuts at a ballgame. But a wonderful beer, and I'm very glad to have had the chance to try it. Highly recommended."
"Overall: This is good beer, but it is very different. I have had many tripels this one stands out in many different ways. With it's yeasty taste and everlasting taste of lemons you get the feel of what complex is. Salud!"
""
""
""
"Interesting and quite complex. Lots of stuff going on, but it just barely escapes being an 'everything bagel'."
"Awesome warm feeling after drinking just one glass of this beer. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try an Anchorage Brewing beer, I look forward to trying more from them."
""
"I absolutely love the restrained earthen character of Anchorage Brewing Company's ales. They know how to create distinctive ales that adhere to the style's prescription very well while injecting the rustic and artistic attributes that separate them from the pretenders in the Belgian-style beer market. Great job again!"
""
"Golden slightly cloudy body with lots of lace. Funky and spicy, a little wood and tart fruit. Nice triple,white winish, not getting much Brett flavour or impact. Above normal mouthfeel. John's bottle that was drunk in a hurry this hot summer's day."
""
"Pours a golden color with a big white head. Aromas of straw and grass with a definite oak and white wine note. There’s a mild fruity tartness to the nose and just a hint of funk. The flavor has a surprising touch of bitterness, but perhaps it’s just tannins/astringency? White wine, light fruits, and a subtle lactic tartness to go along with the bready malt flavor and soft sweetness. Good, but Love Buzz is still my favorite thus far from this brewery."
"M - Medium body with a massive chew. Creamy. Light carbonation."
""
"I would let this warm, as it is very hard to drink at room temperature. Pick up a bomber and share it with a friend."
""
"Drinkability is crazy high. A world class beer."
""
"Pours hazy burnt orange with fading lacy white foam. The initial smell is that of bubble gum and champagne. The flavor is easy, with a hint of orange and alcohol. There is a spicy note on the back of the throat after the second sip. Very good flavor quality and overall example of an American triple. The chardoannay shines through fairly well but does not take away from the essence of the brett within. There is no cloying after-bite in this brew. Definitely will be drinking this one again."
""
"Overall: The Tide and its Takers is a solid beer, but is just not interesting enough. With the barrel aging and the brett, I expected the beer to be much fuller in terms of both complexity and power."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable. Liked the brett funk, of course."
""
"O - Overall this is a solid beer, not my favourite from Anchorage though. Used to alot more brett with my Anchorage beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: Batch #1, October 2011"
"A very interesting beer for sure, but not sure if it really flowed well for me. Pours a bubble yellow color, huge white head to it. Yeasty smell. Taste is of champagne, Brett, very sour, kind of an odd mouthfeel. Seems like a lot of work went into the beer with aging in different vessels, but the overall product didn't taste the best in my opinion. Not bad, but probably would never try this again, reminded me too much of wine when I just wanted a tasty beer."
"Notes: Really nice and interesting Tripel. Solid beer. Brett is definitely there but it doesn't take over the Tripel. Chardonnay provided only a touch of flavor. Definitely worth picking up."
"O: This is a beer that's about as close to a Belgian beer that you'll find in this country. Extremely drinkable."
""
""
"Overall amazing beer. This is just the perfect blend of all the flavors, starting with a nice Belgian tripel with good Belgian yeast additions, light spices and esters, citrus, fruit, etc. Then add the nice Brett flavor to add some wild funk in the background that doesn't take over the beer, then on top of all that some crisp fruity flavorful Chardonnay wine flavors, and to top it all off as the cherry on top, the rounding from the toasty buttery oak. Maybe the perfect spring beer!"
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Hazy pale amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Tart fruity nose and flavor is yeasty, fruity with a lingering tart finish. Batch #1 Oct 2011, $12.99 for a caged & corked 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Not quite sure what Sam Calaglone (Dogfish Head) is doing, looks like moral support for Anchorage brewing."
""
""
""
"D - I'm curious if these are second- or third-use barrels, as the Chardonnay flavor is far less assertive than some of Gabe's other offerings. I found this easier to drink, and would put it somewhere between the awesome Bitter Monk and the mildly disappointing Love Buzz. In any case, really easy to drink for the 'style'."
""
""
"O: Not to bad of a beer, slight sourness on it, but it was pleasant."
"O: I am now officially excited about what Anchorage Brewing has to offer – and I’m certainly glad I bought their White IPA when I had the chance. After further inspection, it looks like this had something to do with Dogfish Head, as Sam Calagione’s name and signature are on the label. Makes sense…this beer’s astounding, a record Dogfish Head is not unfamiliar with."
""
""
""
"Overall, another great beer from Anchorage. Basically exactly what I imagined a brett-fermented, chardonnay-aged tripel would smell and taste like."
"Pours hazy gold with a dense white head that settles to a thick cap, leaving rings of lacing clinging to the glass. Wonderful aromas of yellow apple, lemon zest, light Belgian yeast, and funky Brettanomyces, all wrapped up in a lovely white grape barrel. Taste is similarly funky, with lots of earthy Brettanomyces, citrus-forward hops, ripe pear, and a solid Tripel base of banana and clove. Very nice blend of the traditional Tripel and the funk. Mouthfeel is crisp and feels surprisingly light given the 9% ABV. Body is a touch over medium, and the carbonation is ample. Overall another great Anchorage beer, keep em coming!"
"Taste. Just what I thought. This is primo stuff. Brett always gives a beer a special twist. This beer is intensely flavored yet it all balances out. I don't find that often. The taste is brett, malt, apricot, sweet background and some spiciness. Also citrus oil or peel but it is a back ground flavor which is unusual and very appealing. This is really a good tripel in my opinion. A little pricy but I am loving every sip. About $13 for a 750"
""
"O= This is another home run from Anchorage. I dunno too much about the brewery besides they are making world class beers that are hard to find but avalible for just about anyone with a keen eye. Keep up the great work Gabe and I'll keep buying these. A unique experience and worth every penny."
"Another solid offering from Anchorage."
"Gabe is an amazing brewer and designer of exquisite beers, and he's helping me learn to like brett. Like all ABC beers I have had so far, the brett element is absolutely a central component of the beer, but yet doesn't dominate it. And while this beer may not be as bold and have as many ingredients as some, the subtle nuance of what is there presents with the synergy and delicate perfection of a polished symphony orchestra. I suspect that something like the finished product is what he had in mind, and that hitting that target is something not a whole lot of brewers can do."
""
""
"O: Because of the bretts in this, it changes quite a bit over the course of a pour. Opens up, mellows out, becoming less tart and a bit sweeter, and really develops a lot of complexity."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Good complexity added to the beer from the Brett and oak. The balance of flavors is really nice from start to end and the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy medium orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of light Brett notes with some dry hops notes and lightly sweet malt notes. Taste is a quiet complex mix between some Brett notes with light funky ester mix in with Nobel dry hops and some sweet malt with a light spicy yeast finish. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with good balance and nice drinkability factor."
""
""
"O - An interesting take on a beer and I loved it!"
"It was beautiful. I went to Stein's the next day and bought two bottles to bring home."
""
"Overall, it's an interesting take, probably not what I look for in this favorite style of mine, but it's an incredibly well crafted beer. I expect nothing but great things from this place and they just deliver in spades."

"T: The chardonnay barrel really comes into play here. Lots of vinous character upfront with some brett, chalky yeast and lemon with a touch of Belgian yeast and clove on the finish. Never gets close to the sweetness a lot of other tripels have, which I think is a really nice touch. Really delicious stuff."
"Flavorful brett brew"

"D ~ Could drink this all day. The brett, barrel, & base beers are all in point here. Check it out & please refer this to wine fans who need to convert. Thanks Reza!"
"O: So far, my favorite of Anchorage's offerings and a very solid brett beer. I am not a huge fan of over-the-top brett beers, but this one was very well balanced with bitterness and barrel flavors."
"O: An interesting take on a bretty tripel."
"The Brett and wood barrel are not that apparent, but very balanced. Grapes seem to make a strong presence in the finish, which is very nice. Really enjoyable and highly recommended."
""
"Overall, an OK beer - probably my least favorite by them. I like the brett, but it's a bit sweet and I don't think it plays well the the Belgian yeast."
"O: I think of this beer more like a saison than a tripel because of the influences from the brett. This beer is very easy to drink and very enjoyable. The alcohol is completely hidden which could make this one quite dangerous at 9% ABV. I would definitely like to have this one again."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very sour, tart, and funky with some grain, lemon, earth, and Brett aromas. Taste is very much the same along with some wood and white wine aromas. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great and interesting take on a tripel and the best of the Anchorage beers I have tried so far."
"O- a different take on a tripel but its an outstanding brew another great one from Anchorage"
"Beer is light in body, I'm not super impressed with the beer. I was expecting more from these guys at this point, I love their other beers but this is just a plain tripel, fine I suppose, I don't think I'll have it again though."
"o - Overall a really nice beer. I'm a sucker for oranges and brett and this one has a lot of each. Very nice, would like to have it again."
""
"The flavor is also pretty Brett heavy, but also has notes of oak, yeast spice, and a bit of hops. Medium body with spritzy carbonation and a dry finish. Earthy. Not quite as good as some of Anchorage's other offerings, but still quite tasty."
"overall: non-traditional, but tasty. the chardonnay barrel and brett are nice touches"
""
""
"Probably not my favorite Anchorage brew, but it's still great and they are without a doubt masters of the Brett craft."
"The beer is straw yellow and hazy with a small, white head. The aroma brings some yeast, a bit of citrus, lemon zest. Hard to believe this is 9% abv. Nice flavor. Light bodied with some mildly tart citrus, yeast. Not a traditional tripel, but more of a hybrid with a considerable yeast and funk presence. Really nice - would have again."

"Purchased upon recommendation at Healthy Spirits in San Fran. Lite, citrusy, crisp. Smells wonderful. I taste hints of dried fruits like dates or prunes. Chardonnay clearly drives the flavor. Excellent finish. Semi-sweet. Did I just taste banana? Half-inch of foam. More carbonated than a Chimay white or a Brothers David. Dry refreshing aftertaste. Lingers. Quite lovely."
"O - Light and nice, another winner for Anchorage. I can't wait to visit the brewery."
"- This is a tasty number. I would love to have more of these to age, but I found only the one. There is enough residual sugars left behind for the brett to carry on its way over time and really develop this beer into something else. It's solid now, and I bet would get even better. Certainly worth the try. Surprised I paid the same amount for this as I did the IPA. The IPA should have been less."
"Big thanks goes to beermeX2 for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, bread, fruit, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, wood, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The flavor and aroma going on in this one was very solid and enjoyable. This made this one really easy to drink. A definite must try if you get the chance!"

"Pleasant beer that i would gladly drink again."
"This beer pours a medium bodied rich orangish gold in color with a two finger soapy white head. The nose is funky and full of Brett with a nice amount of buttery Chardonnay oak. The flavor consists of plenty of Belgian yeast, bitter hops, buttery Charddonnay barrel, and very dry Brett. It's nice, and what I kind of expected but not quite complex as I had hoped. It's nice and has traditional characteristics of a triple. That said, it's a much drier form. This beer drinks medium in body and has an assertive dry tartness to pair with the slight Chardonnay most present on the nose, and subtly present in the flavor profile. Overall this is a nice triple. If I'm spending money on a tripe. I'd prefer it's on something unique like this. It's an intriguing take on the style."
"This reminds me a lot of Bitter Monk by Anchorage--good thing, because I love both beers."
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable. It reminds me a lot of their other beers."
"The Tide and its Takers pours a golden yellow, with just a little bit of haze to it. About three fingers of snow white foam pile on top of the beer. Head retention is pretty good, but lacing is definitely spotty. The nose is fantastic, dominated by notes of mango, pineapple, and lemon. There's an underlying earthy brett funk, and a touch of chardonnay adds another layer of complexity. The barrel aging is a little bit more prominent in the flavor profile. Especially cold, the boozy white wine notes overpower the beer a little bit. The citrusy lemon and tropical fruit influences are still present, but definitely take a back seat here as compared to the aroma. The brett funk is also probably a little bit stepped up here. It's still tasty, but doesn't quite deliver on the promise of the nose. The body is nicely dried out and light, but it's paired with a carbonation that could stand to have just a little more zip to it. I definitely enjoyed my bottle of Anchorage's The Tide and it's Takers, but I think with a little bit less overt barrel character it would be something really special."

"O: Tastes just as advertised, and a good advertisement at that: a bretty, chardonnay oak-aged Belgian tripel. Not my favorite of the four Anchorage beers I’ve had, but this beer did not disappoint."
""
"Very interesting example of the style. I would recommend that you check it out."
"B-"
"I don't want to see Anchorage back themselves into a corner with all these triple-fermented, white wine barrel-aged beers...except these beers have been incredible so far, so if they turn into a Jolly Pumpkin type brewer (variations on a theme) then hey, no complaints from me. I've recently been won over by several Chardonnays, after not thinking I was ever going to acquire the taste for wine, so this is a real treat, considering big beers are my thing and the tripel is among my favorite styles. So if you're a beer drinker of similar mindset, you're going to want to try this, pronto. As with all the Anchorage stuff. Wow, best newcomer of the last several years, I think..."

"Overall this was a nice beet that I was surprised I enjoyed because of my distaste for tripels. It's also quite tame for a wild ale at this point as well and I can only see this developing nicely over time. Chardonnay barrels are the forefront right now which is perfect for my tastes as I enjoy 95% of wine barrel aged beers. Wish these weren't so pricey but the quality is definitely there; not for your novice beer drinker for sure."
"One of the few I'd go into the trenches with."

"Eh? Had high hopes, kinda dashed. Looks ok a first pour, clear, translucent, golden, two finger white head, medium white bubbles. Sadly the apperance is not as it should be. The ""head"" is not rocky as a triple's should be. Very light citrus, phenolic hint, some remaining belgian esters. A hint of funk and barn but just a hint. The flavor brings the party. Initially light, tart and funky. Followed by a lemon lift, and some distinct sweet vanilla, oak and light spice. The marriage between the oak and beer is the best part of this ale. Full rounded and silky feel, dry oh yes very dry. But alas I will not be buying this again, it was a great journy just not the best beer."
"Came highly recommended by Vinny at DeCicco's in Brewster NY. I trust Vinny, not only because he looks trustworthy, but he has yet to steer me wrong. Not cheap at $18, but I'm glad I took it on. Looks like a thick Hefe on the pour, but a thinner head. Brett plays a huge part on the nose, with it's funk and citrus. First sip is over the top orange rind, but I know this one'll be a chameleon. VERY complex. Great carbonation, with a clean astringent bite. I like it very much, although I wish it had a little more sweetness."
"Batch 1. Pours a murky golden color with a medium-large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite lovely. Tart lemon notes with light floral hops and oak. Nice Belgian yeast with some definite barnyard funk from the Brett. A bit of honey and white wine as well. Taste is initially sweet citrus fruits...lemons and a hint of orange, immediately followed by some tart lemon. Floral hop flavors with some intense french oak flavors as well. There is a ton of brett in the flavor as well. Quite complex. Finishes with some white wine, wild yeast, and bitter hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, but I just wish I had bought another bottle. What they did with the Brett in this beer is just fantastic, so I would love to see how it ages. Crossing my fingers I find more."

"This beer is great because it does the same thing but in a totally different way.  It's perhaps the perfect funk beer.  Herbal , spicy, fruity, earthy and let very little defines itself (making the whole greater than the parts). This is no different but it's done very differently from love buzz and bittemonk. I get the feeling this is what de proef initially intended on with it's wild beers. Though this works like high art."
"Taste as usual hides a high abv, thought the bretty and tart notes were on the lower side for an Anchorage release. Far better than your average belgian trippel for my palate, but the price point on these are always going to be somewhat prohibitive from becoming a regular part of any lineup."
"I get a little bit of a citrusy tripel at first, and then the mellow, chard oak comes in. But the finish is quite interesting; a tingling peppery-ness swirls in and leaves with a bit of dry finish. This is definitely a different take on the tripel that I quite enjoyed."
"O: Another good beer from Anchorage. There's a signature to all the beers I've had from them so far that they'll be riding to the hall of fame for sure. 4/5"

"Let's face it, after the first three marvelous beers Gabe's released, we all know that his next offering was likely to be pretty special, and the tripel does not disappoint. It poured a lovely gold color with a nice white head. The aroma was interesting, with some spicy Belgian yeast notes intermingling with some bright, crisp citrus elements (likely from the Sorachi Ace hops) and just a touch of brett funk. Most of the same flavors were there on the palate, plus a touch of woodiness from the aging in Chardonnay barrels. Mouthfeel was good, and the brett funkiness reappeared significantly on the finish. Given my experience with Gabe's previous beers, I expect that cellaring will greatly increase the brett character, so if you don't like your tripels funky, drink this one fresh. It's 9.0% ABV and 30 IBUs, and one of the best tripels I've ever had. Another masterpiece from Gabe Fletcher's brewhouse."
