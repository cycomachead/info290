"Overall: Rather good for the style, IMHO it’s a sweeter version of Fin du monde with a slightly less complex bouquet, but still quite enjoyable."

"Overall -  Very delicate tripel with a lot of fruit subtleties. Inviting and delicious and a great start to the taster's pack overall."

"Final Grade: 4.00, an A-. Watou Tripel is a well-made Belgian-style brew that is easy to like, but is not likely to amaze. The flavour profile is highly enjoyable, but not very complex for this style - lacking many of the inviting aromatic notes and the spicy kick I tend to expect from this sort of strong ale. It's still a very solid effort that I'd happily drink again, but in the end it's a victim of strong competition - it's just not one of the better tripels I've had over the years. Worth a look, if nothing else."

"A very true tripel with a really impactful and competent flavour wrapped in a very succinct and balanced profile. Very satisfying and interesting from start to finish with little surprises, it makes for quite an enjoyable sipper, and is certainly got the balance very in tune with where it is aiming. Personally, maybe it was a touch sweet with the candi sugars to begin but I enjoyed it a lot in any case. Very lovely. This brewery is on point with their beers."
"It's okay. Taste like what you would expect a ""normal"" beer to taste like (like it is the most quintessential beer that one could expect). Aftertaste is a bit strong. Ordinary, nothing special."

"Opaque golden body with white head and yeasty sediment. Belgian candy sugar, clove, honey, light malt and herbal notes. Remarkable."

"Overall: A really good Belgian Tripel. Nice mix of zesty fruit esters and spicy yeast."

"Very champagne-like, nice aroma, average appearance, not much flavor, nice palate. This was part of a St. Bernard mixed pack."

"All in all a great beer. I must explore more Belgian beer in the future."

"Overall a pretty solid straightforward tripel but one that doesn't knock my socks off."

"Bottle obtained from a St. Bernardus mixed 6-pack poured into a goblet. A rich burnished golden color with an imposing fluffy white head, classic Belgian look. Massive banana and clove aromas, along with another note consistent with spicy, slightly woody Belgian yeast. I found this one to be sweet and malty for a tripel, with notably less overt alcohol on the palate than one often gets with such brews. Malt backbone recalls brown sugar, a little butterscotch, and lightly burnt pancakes. Fruity and spicy, featuring clove and cinnamon phenols coupled with assertive banana and baked pear. The yeast recalls a hefeweizen. Impressively hoppy for the style as well, with some noble hop and gooseberry notes showing up in the fairly sweet but not cloying finish. Highly carbonated but quite smooth and on the thick side of the Belgian ale body continuum. It was interesting to sample a tripel that was largely true to style but nevertheless sweeter and less boozy than the iconic examples."
""
"Overall, a good Tripel, though it lacks a bit of the flavor complexity of their St. Bernardus Tripel. This one is a bit sweet and lacks some of the spice. Still, if you try one you've got to try the other!"

"Overall: Another excellent tripel from St. Bernardus. Not sure what exactly the difference in flavor is, but both are welcome in my fridge any time."

"Overall- Very good, solid beer. Would be a great introduction to what a tripel should be or at least, what the template for a good tripel would be. Worth a try- even if you think you don't like tripels. Will repurchase when I get around to John's Market again."
""

"Overall this is an outstanding tripel. If I was going to drink a tripel, I would probably want this one or Allagash Curieux but I still have the St Bernardus Tripel on deck to try next. This Watou Tripel has an old antique/old world type taste to it that I do not get in Tripel Karmeliet or La Fin Du Monde. I like that taste of have been sitting in a cellar aging for a century so that is a bonus. Tripels are not my favorite style as generally the stronger hop presence is not my bag. For context, I like sweet beers in the style of Belgian Strong Dark Ales, Bruins, Dubbels etc."

"Overall, quite good. The standard St. Bernadus Tripel is certainly superior, but this is a nice beer."
""

""

"OVERALL: A fine tripel, with different dynamics than the St.Bernardus Tripel. No hint of booze, this drinks like a monk's table beer. I am glad I had the opportunity to drink a bottle of this well made, authentic Belgian beer."

"O-This is a fine Belgian tripel. The appearance is what other tripels should strive for and the mouthfeel matches the flavor nicely. It has that subtlety in flavor that many American brewers should take note of, but it lacks the complexity and spice shown in the best variants of this style (its Bernardus cousin, for example)."
"Overall, a really good tripel with quite a bit going on. I really love the number of nuances in the aroma and flavor. This is a really interesting as well as refreshing beer to drink."
""
""
""
"O - A pretty good, easy drinking tripel. No alcohol evident. Flavor overall is light and subtle but very tasty."
""
""
""
"O: It's a little sweeter than I'd normally like a tripel to be, and almost feels a little half-baked. Not quite as complex as other examples of the style, and not quite as drinkable. Still more than worthy of a drink though."
""
""
""
""
"O- this isn't the best tripel that I've had, but its certainly enjoyable. Pairs well with a cold winter night."
"Overall it is a decent Tripel. Not the best I had but neither the worst."
""

"pour is a hazy dark peach skin color with a thick tight off white head. Nose has loads of yeast and a nice spice to it. Earthy banana notes up front with some lemon underneath. Taste follows the nose, a touch sweeter, full body and high clean carbonation. Zesty lemon juice, peppery, and yeast mix together and balance out very well. Solid stuff, gets a hint sweet in the finish."
""
""
"Pours hazy yellow with lots of big fluffy head. Slight hint of spice on the aroma with minimal fruit, pears if anything, dry yeastyness. Tastes refreshing but was expecting more flavor, this has a hint of yeasty spice on top of slightly watered down honey sweetness. Very dry finish, with high carbonation and light palate. A decent beer, but doesn't stand up to the Quality of the Abt 12."

"O: This beer hides its alcohol rather well, but the high amount of candi sugar is what causes you to need to sip it. It’s a good representation of the style."

"A decent enough beer. It hides its alcohol strength fairly well with its flavor characteristics. A bit harsh with the bitterness, but fair enough for the style."
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a cloudy dark orange amber with tons of floaties, dark brown and white. Small, off-white head and lacing. The beer is moderate bodied and the floating particles are suspended in the beer; very interesting looking. An aroma of sweet malt and light fruit, slightly sour. Flavor is sweet malt, light fruit, caramel, vanilla and Belgian spice, somewhat dry finish. Nice flavor progression. A nicely made tripel, somewhat sweeter than others, which is to my taste."
"A good, interesting triple that is yeast driven with some floral, sweet honey notes."
""
""
"330 ml bottle into signature chalice, best by 10/25/2013. Pours very cloudy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of lemon, apricot, banana, clove, biscuit, bubblegum, candi sugar, herbal spice, and some yeast funk. Decent aromas that are a bit muted. Taste of lemon, banana, bubblegum, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of clove, banana, citrus, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Much more fruity than it is spicy. A touch on the dry side for a Tripel. Good flavor balance and decent complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Alcohol is almost invisible with almost no warming noticeable on the finish. Overall this is definitely a very nice, well balanced, and drinkable Tripel. I have to admit that I expected a lot more from St. Bernard on this one though."
"Overall this beer is slightly thicker with the sweetness and yeast, but not overpowering like some in this class. Very nice."
""
""

"O- Pretty lackluster compared to the other offerings I’ve had. I would say it could be just a bad bottle, but the other beers from the same variety pack were perfectly fine."
"Serving Temp = 51F."
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-yellow with a white head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of malt, spices, yeast, and some fruity aromas. Taste is of the same with a fruity finish. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good and tasty tripel. I am glad I was able to try this one as I have never seen it around in stores."

"O: I thought this was only OK. Not what I was expecting, a bit too light and not typical of the style. I found myself a bit confused drinking it. I picked it up when I bought the gift pack with the glass, this is probably my least favorite of all the St. Bernardus offerings."
""
"Definitely a solid tripel but pales in comparison to the regular St. B's tripel."
""

"Overall, this is a solid tripel. It's well balanced, complex, and delicious."
"Overall- This is my favorite of the St. Bernardus brews as of yet. It's subtle mouthfeel, and light fruit taste are fantastic. It's well balanced and not over carbonated."
"Golden color, two finger head. Smells of spicy yeast, grain, with wonderful banana bread toward the end. I get a very smooth, balanced taste with some spice, banana bread, honey, and earth and grains at the back. Mouthfeel is creamy. Just enough peppery/prickly punch but not overwhelming. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"D - Certainly a step below the St. Bernardus Tripel, in my opinion. A little easier to drink, but the flavor lacks a certain complexity that one would expect from a strong Belgian beer."
"O- This beer is great - but if you are excepting a tripel in the conventional sense of the style, you won't find it here. It takes all my favorite flavors from a Belgian quad and puts it in a light package. Highly recommended, and at a competitive price point (I got this beer for around $3.50, compared to most Belgians that go for $5-7) I will be coming back to this very soon."
"Overall: A nice beer, but there are many better ones in the style"
"This Tripel pours out as yellow color with a decent looking white head on it. The smell had a floral and earthy mix of aromas. The taste has a bit of spice, hop bitterness and a slight sweetness. The mouthfeel of this beer is well carbonated and has a bit of a stinging feeling. Overall the beer isn't a bad Tripel."
"Excellent beer, I will use this for cooking and pairings. Really didn't expect such a pleasant surprise!"
"Medium mouthfeel that has just a little of the alcohol present. Not the best tripel but a solid offering overall."
"Overall: An OK tripel. Low points are too much alcohol flavor and too dry of a finish. A letdown because St B is such an awesome brewery."
"O - An excellent beer, great for any tripel or sweet honey blonde enthusiasts."
"D - I rate this higher than the St Bernardus version because it's much bigger and fuller."
"Not digging this one at all. Definitely not a very good triple, and something I wouldn't buy again."
"Mouthfeel is rich. The spiciness and carbonation tickle the tongue. Goes down smooth except for a slight alcohol bite. Drinkability for a Tripel is good. I would seek this one out again."
"A delicious and even tripel."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light body and light carbonation. Easy to drink with a 7.5% abv."
"A nice beer, but the standard St. Bernardus Tripel is better in my opinion."
"A delicious and even tripel. Sweet."
"Very carbonated up front, tingling the tongue. Hints o slight alcohol, peppery spice, lemon zest and citrus peel. Creamy full body with sweet alcohol, light fruit and alcohol warmth in the finish. The spicy notes are more prominent than the sweet fruit ones but this is still very decently balanced and becomes more drinkable as it warms."
"Overall a great beer but that's no surprise - that's all these monks know how to do."
"An easy enough triple to put back - the sweetness, whether sugar or alcohol oriented, kept very much in check."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It has a nice dry complexion, not bad flavors and nothing negative lingering around the mouth. Despite being 7.5% it drinks very well too, not boozy at all."
"Color a little cloudy. Bitter orange nose quite pronounced. A mouth spicy without being too much, we feel the bitterness, which undoubtedly comes from citrus character conveyed by yeasts. The finish is not great power and not so persistent if somewhat syrupy. A lack of body and flavor for a beer called ""triple""."
"A well put together Tripel, just too dry for my personal liking."
"It's a good tripel all in all. Not too sweet, yeasty, and tasty. It isn't the best I've ever had, but it's definitely drinkable and one I could drink again."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Two finger bubbly off white head on a clear dark gold. The head soon diminishes to a ring. No lacing to speak of. Malty smells. Sweetish fruity notes. Very smooth taste. Nice round well melded flavours. Caramel in the back. No apparent carbonation yet it seems to be there. An excellent triple. Only the high ABV keeps it from session territory as there are no impediments elsewhere."
"D: A solid tripel, though not in the upper echelon. I'd be happy to drink this again."
"Drinkability- This beer is very drinkable. However I would prefer a different Tripel if I had the choice."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - light/medium bodied, and medium/high carbonation. Rather chewy for the style but not a negative. Although the alcohol isn't hidden its fairly tame for the abv making this beer very drinkable and thoroughly enjoyable. Still don't quite understand the difference between St. Bernardus and Watou but have to say I prefer the later. Well worth another purchase"
"It's worth a try"
"The dominant floral flavors prevent this one from being super drinkable. I'd love to have another, but I wouldn't want it right away, I want something else to give my taste buds a change of pace first."
"It's clear with a pale amber hue. The white foamy head doesn't stand too long on its hind legs, but, once back on all fours, it lingers on, seemingly unendingly. Kinda reassuring, actually. Some variable-length deposits of webbed lacing is formed, evidence of the fortitude contained in this glass. This just wouldn't be a tripel without some clove and banana, and our boy doesn't disappoint. In fact, it downright appoints. *Insert rim shot here* But seriously, folks, the banana and clove are there in abundance, joined in their nasal migration by some coriander, orange peel, and pineapple, not a rare combination but not wholly ordinary either. It should come as no surprise, then, that the taste takes these elements and introduces them to a new habitat. Yes, there is a risk that they won't get along so well in their newfound captivity, but, so far, they seem to be adapting just fine. In fact, they are even joined by a warm breadiness and a rounded tartness. Not only are they interacting with no problems, they're downright getting along. It's what you always hope for when you get involved in flavor relocation and confinement. The modd is light, but not too light: some necessary seriousness is bound to find its way in. But that's life. Regardless, things go down quite smoothly, allowing for happiness to continuously pervade for some time. Well, back to observation..."
"You gotta love a brewery that makes two tripels (and great ones at that)! This one pours hazy copper with a big layer of bubbles. Nose is huge banana, with clove, juniper, pineapple, and a hint of caramelized sweetness. Flavor is quite smooth, with a well-balanced sweetness, banana, and a finish of anise and clove. A great example of the style and one of my favorites tripels."
"Drinkability: a nice, solid, tasty, drinkable if not exceptional tripel. I'd absolutely have this again."
"D - St. Bernardus never fails to deliver a great brew. This tripel is is no exception."
"Nice looking orangey color on it with a billowy white head, cloudy body with a lot of carbonated bubbles. Great thick aroma, citrusy and Belgian sugary with a touch of champagne and passion fruits. Taste is solid if unspectacular, but still superior to many tripels I've had. Very light taste with some spices present. Just an all-around good beer here."
"Wonderful flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. Crisp and light. On the other hand, booze is a little stronger in the mouth than I anticipated. Overall though, sweet...tasty, light and fruity...musty. Excelent Tripel!"
"Poured a cloudy orange with a frothy, well-carb'd head that dies slowly. Great citric/orange smell along with Belgian funk/yeast and hints of spices and sweet malt like caramel. A great fruit taste of a citric/orange variety that is blended with sweet malts like caramel, minor spices and clove. A medium body that is chewey and also has a well-carb'd feeling but not bubbly like champagne for a crisp dry finish. Not an overpowering or somewhat sour tripel; more balanced and easy to drink. A quality beer all the way."
"I like this beer."
"a triple on the side of a fantastic blonde. nose is very intensely taffy, bit of honey, pollen. with a body and feel that is voluminously bready sweet like challah bread. honey suckle floral sweet. wonderful esters... that dessert of all blondes. wonderful carbonation. quite sweet which i could see would deter people but very concealed abv."
"Drinkability: I think this is a really drinkable tripel. The balance of flavors is quite good and their interplay makes sipping this one an interesting experience with each sip. I most certainly will have more of this one and expect that buying more will be a regular event."
"Very drinkable in every sense of the word."
"Taste is overly carbonated, fills the mouth up with bubbles on a single sip like a cola does, the lemony zest really hits the sides of the tongue, sweet malt and candied sugar complement, but that darned carbonation is way too assertive, the strength is well hidden though."
"Thanks Derek, much appreciated! Dark hazy amber. Frothy beige head creating some nice webbing. Black pepper and spices arise and fill the nostrils. Candy and fruity malt notes as well. Sweet candy fruit flavours with enough spice and bitterness to balance it all out. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, nice peppery aftertaste, with lots of alcohol warming taking place. Great example of the style, and a great winter warmer. Count me in!"
"D - A deceiving Tripel... light mouthfeel with a complex palate that has no spikes of flavor, just blends of taste intoxication."
"D - Really nice would definately seek more great drink, really complex, and worth having another."
"D: A very nice tripel; not quite up to snuff with the St. Bernardus Tripel, but still very enjoyable and actually fairly easy to put one back."
"Notes: This was a very enjoyable Tripel. I liked the mellow sweetness that slowly dried out towards the finish and the champagne like texture and grape flavor."
"D: I am thoroughly enjoying this beer but I'm not sure I'd pick this over the regular tripel"
"#2 in the St. Bernardus six pack sampler. Pours a golden yellow into my Chimay 25cl goblet with a bit of sediment , a good amount of carbonation bubbles a one finger head. The head is less creamy and more fizzy than the St. Bernardus Tripel, retention and lacing is lower in this beer. Smells of fruits (lots of apple), raisins, malts and some alcohol. Tastes of fruits (apples again, green ones), yeast, raisins and alcohol, the main difference between this one and the standard St. B tripel is the higher alcohol presence in this beer. Mouthfeel is creamy, good carbonation and still smooth with the alcohol warming the mouth during the finish. Drinkability is good, tasty beverage, think St. B tripel + apples + alcohol, alcohol might get old after a bit."
"Overall: This is a very nice tripel, with a few characteristics that strike me as minor flaws. It is a gorgeous beer in the glass. Its flavor and aroma profile is on the milder side. The only issue in my view is that it is a bit too sweet for the style. Definitely a good example of an abbey tripel, though, and well worth seeking out."
"not sure what was wrong, maybe i got owned on the specific bottle, but it was not good at all"
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of sweet fruits (apple, pear, fig), applesauce, light spices. Flavor is yeasty/bready initial with apple skins and light fruits in the finish. Palate is a touch heavy, but overall this is a nice tripel with easy drinking. Enjoyable!"
"D - Given the ABV for a Tripel, this is more than drinkable and wuld be a decent introduction to the style, I think. I'll buy it again."
"4.0 D: Good beer. Wouldn't mind another."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a large white, fairly quickly receding white head. Very little lacing is left behind. Smells of lights fruits (banana, apple, orange), yeast, sweet malts, and spice. Very typical, very excellent. Tastes spicy, malty and bready with a crisp mouth-feel that rounds off at the edges and gets good and a little more creamy on the way down. A few more drinks reveal some phenols and a faint sourness. Personally I like my tripels a bit creamier, but personal preference isn't going to detract too much from my thorough enjoyment of this brew."
"very drinkable for a tripel, i would imagine this would age very well too. if your looking for a different kind of authentic tripel, this is for you."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 11.2 fluid ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Decent but not my favorite tripel."
"This brew pours up a murky peach color with tons of little flakies. great white head lasting the whole ride. perfect lacing on my chalice. the nose is yeast, light fruits, a little alcohol spice, pale grains. I taste basically the same as the nose. add some coriander, Belgian candy sugar, subtle burnt toffee. full bodied, high Belgian carbo. a good drinker. Not my fave beer but definately true to Brouwerij St. Bernardus' good name..."
"Pours a golden amber colored body, very cloudy, with a foamy white color head, big bubbles. Alcoholy grapey aroma. Lightish aroma. spicey, watery, alcohol. Maybe banana. Light grape taste. Sweet. Some wheat, but nothing else."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a golden orange color with a puffy white head that left some lacing as it dissipated. The aroma is of tart apple skins, musty metal, and light tropical fruit. The taste is more of tropical fruit, coriander, white pepper, lemon and green apple, light banana and clove, and a bit of a malt presence. Sweet but balanced, ABV well hidden, crisp carbonation with a noticable malt body. A rock solid tripel, nice tripel flavors but nothing earth shattering."
"I've had this beer on many occasions now and however much I love the tripel style, it has never managed to win me over. I really like this brewery and everything about the beer is textbook Belgian tripel, yet, I wouldn't place it in the same league as the Westmalle or Karmeliet. Oh well, St. Bernardus has plenty of other great beers to stock the cellar with!"
"Very spritzy carbonation and nice aftertaste. Very drinkable for a strong ale."
"Overall a fine beer tarnished a bit by all the appearance of yeast chunks."
"Overall- This is a very drinkable beer for how complex it is. It is not too thick or to light and has so much going on in the smell and taste. I will have to revisit this beer some time in the future."
"First impression is that this is highly carbonated, almost like a soda pop. There is a light lemony presence to an otherwise lightly sweet molasses touch. The aftertaste is toward the tart side."
"This is an excellent Tripel, pretty much spot on forr the style. definitely up there with the best in the category, and not one you see around quite as much. Pours a hazy orange/golden, with a very finely beaded white head that settles to a ring and swirl. Lovely spice aromas of clove, coriander, and anise with a background breadiness that is very pleasant. Beautifully balanced flavors, with more breadiness, white pepper, clove, less anise, and a bit of tannins on the end. There is some sweetness from candi sugar, but this is much less sweet than many examples and the spice notes are foremost. Some light banana as it warms. A little stiffer and more tannic than some tripels, but complex and full in the mouth. Delicious, a serious tripel that deserves to be sipped and contemplated. Just figuring out the changing spice notes will keep you busy. they keep eveolving. Eventually I taste ginger and mace and bblack pepper as well as the other spices. Nice."
"D_Wonderful taste. Not very filling, great aftertaste. Good drinkability"
"Good drinkability, booze isn't overpowering. Great, overall"
"D: This St. Bernadus sampler has paid huge dividends for a very tidy price tag ($19.99/6 different beers). Watou Tripel is another winner, more for its playing to a tripel's strengths of fruity, yeasty flavors and doing it very enjoyably."
"D: Great drinkability per style, incredibly smooth, enjoyable and nearly flawless in execution and one of the best per style."
"I don't know if there's such thing as a sessionable tripel but this might be it. Extremely flavorful brew but still it's very easy to drink. Highly recommend it."
"Nothing that hasn't been covered, just wanting to help the statistics mean something. Great beer. Got it in a ""mix-pack"" at Patricia's IGA this summer and haven't seen it in Columbia since. Not a ""summer-drinking beer", but excellent for slow sipping from a Belgian glass. (1/2 a pint at a time in a big Belgian glass was my decanting.) Great all around beer if you aren't looking to party with it! I would note that it had a caramel mouthfeel that I've personally overdone brewing belgians, but they pulled it off with a great amount of drinkability. The bubbles help tone down the unfermentable sugars. Also, I did drink it a little colder than I usually drink Belgian beers."
"D- It's very light, very nice and could be a good intro beer to belgian tripels to the novice. It has all of the good characteristics of the style with none of the drawbacks."
"Drinkability: If find many of the so-called great tripels a bit too boozy and sweet for my liking; this beer provides a nice compromise and therefore is readily drinkable"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this one is a little bit more sessionable than most Tripels, which makes it a very nice beer to drink for a whole evening, especially if you want a decently powerful Belgian-style beer."
"Very light and dry vinious with white wine like qualities with a hint of pear,very light mouthfeel and well carbinated,nice balance with crisp tart bitterness with a touch of citrus.A touch phenolic taste at the finish slight plastic,not offensive not much yeasty taste,very smooth and drinkable. A light version of their regular Tripel. Would be a good starter Belgian beer."
"Drinkability is ok here but I have trouble finding this beer."
"Not a great tripel, but still stands as a decent Belgian beer with nothing to complain about."
"The smell was yeasty with a banana dominated aroma. Taste was bready and fruity with some apple and banana in the mix. It was moderate to high carbonation and had a medium body to it. I found it to be a quaffable brew and may buy it again."
"The beer poured a cloudy gold with lots of floating sediment and two fingers of white rocky head. The aroma was rich with yeast malt a little berry and some grass. The taste is full malty and sweet with little bursts of sugar. The feel is thick and dry with some alcohol warming on the end. I found this to be a very pleasant beer, and I'm sure I'll be getting more. I'm not sure of it as a session beer, but a triple I will want again and again."
"This is part of the St. Bernardus mixed 6 pack I purchased. Pours a cloudy, murky golden color. Nice amount of head and lacing. Faint fruity, citrus aroma. Sweet and tangy citrus flavor with a quick alcohol rush. Touch of malts, vanilla and a grainy yeast note. A little tart. It's pretty easy drinking and refreshing. Overall I'd give it a slightly above average overall mark but that's it. I'd have it again but for the price I'm sure I can find better."
"This pours a nice light yellow with big white head and lots of bubbles. Nose is great with vanilla and bananas and butterscotch. Taste is clean and appealing. Citrus and apples with bananas. A little drier than the other triple from this brewery and a tad watery, not that bad though. Nice carbonation for the tongue and very drinkable. I think this is one of the better tripels available."
"Drinkability: I rather enjoyed it. A very nice tripel, a style, I'll admit, I can be a bit fussy towards. It's got the usual tripel traits, but it's like someone blended in a sweeter, bready Vienna lager into it. There, I had to get that off my chest. And you know what? It felt good. It's good to be honest."
"A good beer, only limitation with it is lack of complexity. A very good choice for when you want a fruity Belgian Beer."
"Interesting drink, different than many tripels I have had. Not something I will seek out."
"The drink is medium-bodied and feels soft and mellow with light carbonation and a nice clean finish."
"This is a nice triple. I think this is one of the weaker showings from St Bernardus. which by all rights would be the pinnacle of most world class brewery's portfolios. A very good beer."
"D- Good, but a bit to malty for a triple, at least for me."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy straw color with a thick white head. Smells slightly of spices and malty sweetness, but not much aroma. Taste is pretty mild. A little spice, a little banana, and some malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is pretty bad. It severely lacks body. There's some yeasty breadiness, but it feels really thin and water. Despite that, it's drinkable. I don't think I'd buy another. The regular St. Bernardus Tripel is better."
"D: A good beer, but not great. Try their other tripel for a much better experience."
"Very easily drinkable. Great example of the style."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Triple style."
"This triple is easy to drink, but best reserved for later in the afternoon, or early evening."
"Nice light, bright, golden color with a large, in charge, fuzzy ivory lid. Good old golden orchard nose with some sweet and spicy citrus to compliment. Medium-full body with lush buzzingly fuzzy carbonation. Sweet and lightly bitter Belgian candi sugar leads with fruity apples and lemons following close behind. Lightly spicy and bitter in the finish. Another nice, tasty tripel from st. bernardus. Sure do love this brewery."
"Pours a clear yellow/light orange with good carbonation and nice fluffy head. Good yeasty nose with some appley smell. Taste is of nice appley/citrus with some light bread flavors and yeast on the finish. Some good spice throught the middle and breadiness increases a bit on the finish. apple flavors linger on the aftertaste. Nice and light. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, but a tiny bit too carbonated. Drinkability is quite good, as it should be though for a triple coming in at a mere 7.5%. Fine example of the style, and an enjoyable beer. beware on the pour, as there is quite a bit of sediment in the bottom. great beer."
"D: It ended up on the hoppy side with a little too much carbonation, but it was still very drinkable. I enjoyed it, but would reach for the regular St. B Tripel instead."
" I enjoyed every minute of this stuff."
"750 ML bottle purchased caged and corked for $7.99 from Gary's in Madison... Really enjoyed all of the St. Bernardus samples I tried, so I had high hopes for their Watout Tripel... appearance didn't disappoint... pours a very attractive hazy, foamy, and cloudy, straw-colored hue with a frothy head... rising carbonation is also apparent... Smell is replete with fresh fruit, citrus, and florals... taste complements the aroma with lemon-essence, candied sugars, sweets, pears, grapefruit, and other floral notes... a very good, thick, and rich Tripel... true-to-the-style, and certainly pleasing... although not the best beer brewed by St. Bernardus, this one deserves recognition in its respective category... Good mouthfeel with a perilously easy level of drinkability... the alcohol is well-masked on this one and is hardly detectable... good stuff... Recommended..."
"Watou Tripel is a fine Belgian Tripel from the celibate geniuses at St. Bernardus. The ugly appearance and subdued smell keep it from the top of my list, but it's one you should try and one I'll be glad to buy again."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a off white head that starts falling fast. Decent lacing on the way down too. Nose is sweet and a bit yeasty. Typical stuff, but just right I think. Flavor is great. Slight sweetness with a spice that bites the tip of your tongue. The sweetness stays mild and is only joined by a yeasty influence, and never overshadowed. Really a smooth mix of brewing mastery I think. A lot of carbonation on the feel. It might border on being a bit much, but I think it still feels nice on the tongue. Masterfully created and continually drinkable. An amazing brew that is taking the position of one of my favorite tripels. More old school, with nothing schnazzy or wild about it, its a smooth and even production and another St. Bernardus piece of art."
"A pleasant balanced brew. Sweet and tasty with no off flavors."
"A decent tripel, but I don't care for it near as well as the regular St Bernarudus Tripel."
"St. Bernardus Watou Triple pours a slightly cloudy light orange/gold with a bubbly white head. The aroma is slightly vinous, with light, fruity malt and yeasty esters. The flavor is sweet pilsner malt, nice and fruity with a rounded yeast flavor. There is a lot of carbonation that expands into a creamy mouthfeel. There is some alcohol in the finish, but just a bit and not overpowering."
"Nice light bronze color with tons of carbonation bubbles streaming to the top. Initial 2 finger white head falls to a 1/4 inch cap that susstains and leaves sheats of lace that falls quickly. Smell initially is fruity (apples) followed by some malt and a little bit of yeasty spice. Taste is peppery with a solid bready malt backbone. The fruityness has somehow dissapeared. Mouthfeel is crisp and tight due to the active carb. Overall a nice tripel but not as good as st. bermardus standard tripel."
"Aroma is weak but pleasantly malty with hints of fruit - apple or pear. Color is orangy amber with a fairly thick but not persistent head. Flavor is rich, malty and fruity, with some nutty undertones and just a hint of hop bitterness. Texture is smooth and tingly, and the aftertaste is fairly fruity with just a hint of bitter and a touch of nuttiness. Very pleasing."
"Tastes just a clean as the nose. Notes of fruits ( apples come through nicely), hints of sweet pale malt, some spices and a slightly bitter finish."
"Above average for the style, though not something I'd go out of my way to drink another."
"O: Solid, but there are other better tripels out there... this is certainly no slouch though."
"I bought this on sale today for $3.18 but I didnt notice it was dated best by 01/06/07! Oh, well its Belgian and will probably still be interesting. I poured this extremely slow because there was a shitload of sediment. This beer looks really nice with a two inch white head and a murky dark orange body. The smell is sweet honey, The taste is a slight tinge of licorice twizzlers and fresh bread. Mouthfeel is smooth but dry at the end and the aftertaste really coats my mouth. This beer is decent but unlike the tripels I have had so far but that may be due to the age."
"Bubbly and golden, with a short lived, but lingering head. The nose is strong and fruity, quite enticing. The first thing I noticed was a strong creamy body. It accentuates the fruity, sweet, almost dubbel-ish flavor. The flavor however dies off pretty quickly, ending with a flat, unmemorable finish. A good, drinkable beer, however, while first impressions are said to be the most important, it's the finish that sticks with you."
"A good one timer but not the best out of Watou."
"Comment: Given that a world-class Tripel is made in the same brewery it is hard to get the stark contrast out of my mind."
"Really enjoyed this beer. 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Light orange in color with a medium head that retains well; beautifully carbonated. Very spicy nose, with a little tart apple. Pleasantly spicy taste, yeasty, a little fruit. Light, good in the mouth, a little tart. Could drink a few of these."
"Into the St. Bernardus chalice, this looks nothing short of beautiful with a thick, fluffy head to go with the hazy light orange/golden body. The smell is of the richest spices with a faint hint of wheat and mild malts. Fantastic. The taste doesn't disappoint, and what sets this apart from other tripels is the strength of the spices that are presented in the nose and represented well in the taste. These spices add to a complex and strong-presenced mouthfeel and a fantastic beer."
"Poured into my Duvel Tulip this beer looks awesome. Filled half way through the ""Duvel"" print with chunky, retentive foam filling the rest of the glass to the brim. After a minute or so it still hasn't moved more than 1/4"" down. The beer is a deep yellowish-orange color with big chunks of flaky sediment rising and falling in a convective manor. The smell is also great. Peppery, but sticky-sweet orange aroma. Awesome belgian yeast, very slight hop aroma at the end including coriander, wheat, orange peel, and full, rich esters rising deep into the nose. The flavor is so hard to explain in only a few sentences. Rich, full, explosive, ever changing, and so on. Begins with a sticky sweet orange effect fading into thick and chewy nutty malt characteristic that I never expected. The hop at the end is so ripe and clean that I've never tasted anything like it before. The nutty taste in the middle fades into a chocolate/coffee taste (also very unexpected) before finally fading back into the fresh hop taste that provides a grassy, wheaty aftertaste. I like this tripel especially since it isn't a sugar bomb. It actually has some malt balance while also maintaining that thick, citrusy, sweet flavor that is expected out of a belgian tripel. The mouthfeel is also perfect. It coats the mouth but has a certain dry Saison-like feel that really makes it a great experience. Drinkability, through the roof. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"Taste is medium sweet malty and grainy. This is the base and on top of that are the insane big flavors of the yeast. A taste I normally only get in a Weizen is now in my tripel. An intense phenolic taste, strong cloves and yeastiness make the beer very complex. Add to that the faint alcohol taste and somewhat sharp bitterness. This beer is layered and all of the important components of a tripel are in here, malt, yeast, hop, and all very balanced. Also some light oxidation, but not something to report. Not the prototype tripel, but a great beer!"
"D- I think this is a really nice tripel. So far St. Berny's has never let me down."
"Pours out marmalade in color with a one finger, pock-marked head that maintains well. Smell is honey on bananas and perhaps some peach. Grain presence is mild. Some spiciness is in the nose too, as a combination of the hops and the yeast. Flavor seems slightly overwhelmed by a toasted, and almost roasted-flavored, malt presence. The honeyed and fruited malts just seem overloaded by it. Tastes good all around, but the toasted malt is a bit much here. Has some spiciness in the finish from the hops. Mouthfeel sits really light on the tongue, as a good tripel should, which belies its relatively high abv (although not in the territory of some other tripels). Carbonation is lively and helps to bring out the fruitiness. This is rather drinkable, and a well-constructed tripel, but the toastiness kind of does it in."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, and at 7.5% abv it is possibly sessionable."
"Pretty easy going down...a nice Belgian Tripel."
"750ml bottle from florian's. Somewhat murky yellow-amber body with an inch of off-white head that persists and leaves a fair bit of lacing as i drink the beer. Smells fruity, like raisin and citrus. Tastes pithy with raisin notes and a hint at apple and spice toward the finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Tasty and almost flawless, but not as good as its cousin (St. Bernardus Tripel)."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink and went down pretty quick. I found this to be nicely refreshing for sitting on the deck on a nice spring afternoon."
"Good beer, but there are better tripels out there."
"Drinkability: Good, but not as good as the St. Bernardus triple."
"D: Very! Not too high on the alcohol, and not too heavy to drink a few."
"Monster three finger foamy white head. The color is a cloudy golden yellow with bubbling carbonation. Exceptional true Tripel appearance. Head receded leaving tons of foamy lace along with a big creamy vanilla ice cream looking gob of foam. The aroma is faint and not over-powering in anyway. Exceptional mouthfeel in every respect. Perfect balance of malts, hops, and carboantion. Goes down so smooth and is extremely drinkable. Aroma has the typical Belgium Tripel smell, but lacks a truely unique aroma that would make it stand out. Strong Phenolic taste along with a moderately strong bitterness. Metallic iron aftertaste that fades quick. Citrus notes of bitter grapefruit. Alcohol is well-hidden making this go down dangerously smooth. A lighter ABV Tripel, but still well respected at almost 8%. Bottom of bottle has a thick film of yeast sediment.Overall excellent and worth a try. Leaves a long lingering dry bitter aftertaste, but that doesnt affect it drinkability."
"Nice golden color with a thick gorgeous head. Up front smells of pears, auslese and alchol leads me to expect something very sweet, along the lines of a Triple K. Taste comes out of nowhere - mild. Decidedly mild. Alcohol is not there, the sweetness is not there - Well, maybe in the background, but not slapping you in the face. No real bitterness either. Great mouthfeel, light carbonation. I drained the glass before I could finish reviewing it. May be my favorite Tripel so far."
"Another great beer from the St. Bernardus collection."
"Very flavorful taste, not an estery tripel, more like a wit with more complexity. Really tasty, perhaps a slightly strange classification, but it's very enjoyable. The bottle was gone far too quickly."
"I'm hardly alone in feeling this way, but I love St. Bernardus beer. This is my fourth one to date and they've all been incredible. I love bold, powerful, spicy tripels; and I love the more refined, polished ones as well. Watou Tripel is a proud member of the latter group and is a beer that I won't soon forget. Highly recommended."
"this stuff was quite complex for me to distinguish all what it had to offer.I would have it again but not any time soon.Im glad I tried the almighty ""St Bernardus"" name and it was worth it with a nice goblet for 14 bucks."
"good stuff."
"Nice, drinkable tripel. Not as good as the other tripel from this brewery, the St. Bernardus tripel. But, definitely worth a try."
"With 4.5's across the board, this was without question the best Tripel I have had in a long time. Perhaps ever! Everything seemed big except the alcohol. Poured a cloudy yellow orange colour with loads of sediment suspended in the liquid. The particles themselves even were quite large. Some of them were perhaps 2 or 3mm in diametre. I find this very, very appealing in a most Belgian styles. Head was an enormous white froth that left behind a thick, sticky webbing of lace all about the sides of the glass. This looked positively delicious. Smell was caramel, sweet malt, cooked fruit, and very subtle alcohol. The caramelised sugar note was a bit surprising to me, as I do not recall having ever noted that aroma in a Belgian Tripel before. The taste was full of caramel, as well, along with a bit of cooked fruit, some very mild alcohol on the finish, and a very brief and gentle bitterness that vanishes as quickly as it became noticeable. An absolutely smashing Tripel!!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
"Drinkability, well this is a big beer, but the spice slowed me down."
"Overall: Very good; one of the best tripels Ive tried. Highly recommended."
"D: This is really pleasant. It's not too sweet, it's not too dry, but nicely fruity, has a good bitterness (especially for a Belgian) and is highly drinkable. I'd get this again."
"At 7.5%, you could have two or three and be in tripel heaven. Utterly enjoyable, a superb experience."
"Pours a cloudy pale-orange with a finely bubbled head. Smell is of ripened fruit, spice, and clove. This one has a very spicy aroma. The brew kind of stumbles with the initial alcohol singeing, but melds into a spicy, fruit tinged finish. The body is mid-to-light with a high carbonation level. This beers tendency to be assertive with the obvious alcohol presence detracts from the drinkability. I have had brews with much higher alcohol contents that are much smoother than this. Its kind of rough around the edges. The beer has some interesting flavor characteristics that warrant an initial visit, but nothing more than that."
"Golden color with white head. Smell is a little funky, not necessarily in a good way.Tastes like a basic, but good tripel. Not the best I've had, but there is a pleasant mix of belgian candi sugar with spice. I'd also say it's a touch hoppier than most belgians. Either way, its still a pretty good beer and affordable for an import. I think I paid about $8 for a 750mL. Cheers."
"A vivacsious cloudy, honey amber hue with lots of bubbles, great lacing, and a strong, thick, bready head with great retention. The aroma was a very sugary caramel and spice aroma. The taste is a light toasty malt mixed with candi sugar. This gives the air of peaches, wheat, chammomile, anise, and tart strawberries. Very sweet palate with great carbonation and a very warm finish."
"Not one I will revisit."
"D: A drinkable ale, it just seems to defy conventions."
"A very light and flavorful Tripel that could easily be enjoyed without splitting the 750ml bottle, at only 7.5% abv. Oddly enough, at times I felt as though I were drinking a Savignon Blanc, so this might serve as a good introduction to craft beer for those who ordinarily prefer white wine."
"Watou Tripel pours a light copper color with a persistent white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. This beer has a nice aroma, sweet, sugary fruit. Almost tastes like that too, except it's not really sweet, actually, it's kind of dry. Definitely some hints of alcohol too. Pretty good, perhaps not the best tripel I've had, but quite solid."
"750 mL cork-n-cage bottle, conditioned, with 19/10/09 on the cap and a label that proclaims they are ""bringing heavenly nectar within reach."" After untwisting the cage, the cork loosened on it's own and almost rocketed out, leaving wisps of gunsmoke wafting from the bottle. It pours a hazed dark honey/peach with some floaties and medium carbonation going up to an off-white head that leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is fruity and sugary with melon, apple/pear, some spiciness, and light latex. The flavor is the same but with light hops that leave a mild yet pleasing bitterness, powdery yeast, and maybe a touch of cork. It starts with a lively, prickly carbonation on top of a medium body and becomes incredibly smooth as it warms. Close enough to being heavenly nectar for me."
"Very drinkable tripel. The ABV is not exceptionally high, so you could drink a few of these at one sitting. As previously mentioned, IMO this would be a good beer to introduce your non-BA friends to."
"One word: Great!"
"Taste is similiar to the smell. Deep rich caramel malt. Candy sugar and vanilla. Port like and woody. A bit of hops. Very sticky mouth. Pretty drinkable. Pretty good tripel."
"The flavor here makes the beer. Almost perfectly balanced, with flavors ranging from yeasty esters if pears and apples, to fresh baked bread, to wheat flavors and phenols, to a hoppy dry finish. Slighty sweet with a few caramel flavors up front, but finished hoppy and slightly dry.Quite nice ande exquisetly balanced. Mouthfeel is creamy due to the carbonation, and drinkability is on par for the style."
"Pour a beautiful murky champaigne, with a huge, white, rocky head. Great looking beer. Smells equally great. Yeasty goodness - bread and fruitiness/sugars. Sweet and sour. Taste is rich, spicy with vanilla. Hops bring a nice dryness to the finish. Good carbonation for the style. Quite drinkable. This is lovely with some age on it."
"Almost up there with the St. Bernardus Tripel for me, but not quite."
"P.S. Adding the yeast late in the sampling introduced a darker, sweeter character that even brought with it notes of chocolate. Great beer overall."
"Anyways quite a good brew, doesn't really match up to their bigger guys but why should it have to?"
"Maybe I should have expected it, but this beer is 100% the same as St. Bernardus Tripel. It turns out it wasn't necessary to seek it out because I can buy SBT at the closest grocery store to my house. A top notch beer."
"D - high , a good brew, easy to put away a whole bottle"
"Watou Tripel is clear and bright golden in color. The aroma displays the familiar ""Belgian"" fruity/yeasty elements. On the palate, I was surprised by the subdued nature of this beer. Malt is up front, with a bitterness that creeps into the medium finish. This Tripel drinks soft and easy, and I suppose I like it, but it's not too terribly interesting."
"Light orange color with a full Belgian head. Diverse fruit platter aroma, with hints of nectarine and peach, honey, Belgian yeast and lightly floral hops. Well orchestrated malt and yeast character, producing a range of absolutely sensational fruit flavors. Banana, peach, nectarine...you name it, all balanced by delicious caramel and toffee malt profile, somewhat funky, yet clean yeast and lightly floral hops. I just love Belgian beers. Its amazing that something like this can be produced using only water, malt, hops and yeast. Cheers to beer."
"The body nor the head retention ever give in. The golden color offers a light haze with light yeast present. The aftertaste remains musky and dusty. I don't see a tripel getting much better."
"A very good extra-hoppy Tripel."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with lots of yeast floaties. It has a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry and fruity scent that boasts of pale malts and Belgian yeast. It has an earthiness to it along with some hints of coriander and bitter orange peel. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with a fruity/tart bite. It rings in at 7.5% abv., but it drinks well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It has a smooth malty flavor that is crisp and easy to drink. The yeast adds a nice fruity character which makes the beer for me."
"Overall- a decent Tripel, not worth the $9. Go with Tripel Karmeliet instead."
"I am not overwhelmed by this brew. It is easy drinking though."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a deep golden-orange color, small off white head that leaves little lacing in my glass, spicy yeasty aromas. Sweet fruity flavors like banana bread and pears, full body with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the sweet side, alcohol very well hidden, a decent tripel."
"750ml silkscreened bottle. Pours a hazy medium gold with a 2 finger head, decent longevity and very good lace. Aromas of caramel malt with a bit of yeast, spice, and orange. Rich sweet caramel malt mixed with a bit of wheat malt. Yeasty with earthy spicyness and orange. Creamy and thick. Not nearly as carbonated as other tripel's (Chimay White) which gives it higher drinkability. A good tripel."
"Pours a deep blonde color with a firm white head, leaves quite a bit of lace on my glass. Fruity aroma of sour lemon zest, corn, clove, banana & yeast. Flavor is slight bittering, very mild caramel, clove, spicy pepper, earthy hop character. Medium bodied, creamy and fluffy on the palate with mild carbonation and a soft dry finish. This is a nice tripel, I'd have another but sadly I have never seen it for sale around here and I only had the one bottle."
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey and slightly hazy color ale with a huge foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of spices, malt and Belgian yeast. Taste does include a large dose of spices and honey with a dry finish and slightly funky yeast. Body is above average and carbonation is excellent. Still havent had a bad beer from this brewery."
"Sweet up front, a little spritzy. Malt taste, slightly bitter finish. Flavour domintaed by orange peel character, a hint of spice, yeastiness. Passably good, but not remarkable."
"Pours a cloudy, muddy brown/orange with a huge, fluffy head that takes forever to settle down. Smell is simple but strong. Lots of sweet malts, shortbread, orange and spice. Taste is very sweet and complex, with alot of fruits. Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and other tart fruits. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Delicious, well made brew."
"Pours a cloudy orangey-brown. Medium tan head. The nose is sweet with honey and hints of bread and yeast. A little fruity. Taste is medium-sweetness off the top with some yeasty notes. Some spice on the finish and again, yeast lingers. Some earthy notes off the back. Mouthfeel and lively and turns to a drier finish. Finish remins me of Orval, meaning somewhat of a woody hint. A nice triple but hardly the best example of the style. Looking for a little more liveliness. Sweetness was good and overall drinkability was decent."
"Pours a cloudy gold/orange, huge white head forms and laces pretty well on the glass. Smell is honey sweet, orange, spice, citrus, and floral notes. Taste is vanilla/chocolate, honey sweetness and a spicy orange finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied and highly carbonated. Pretty good tripel although not as good as the St. B tripel."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Its interesting that this tripel is 7.5% and the breweries prior 8 dubbel is 8%. Just a style nerd observation."
"Hazy orange with a bubbly white head that laces very well. I can smell it from almost a foot away, pears, butterscotch, a bit o' cloves... It's drawing me in. Taste was lighter than anticipated, be very welcome. Sweet light fruit up front, with a light slightly crisp finish. Didn't notice the alcohol except for the warming effect in the finish. Nice and smooth and perfect for this warm Indian Summer day."
"Hazy peach colour with a boisterous, 1 inch head of small, white bubbles. Thick sheets of foam stick to the glass and turn to a delicate lace as it dries. Sharp fruit aroma, some citrus, quite sweet and a bit bready, yeasty. A bit spicy too. Mild flavour of malt and oranges, candi sugar sweetness, and a spicy finish. Some alcohol flavour and warmth kicks in towards the end and comes in a bit strong. Medium/light body, a bit sticky, with plenty of carbonation. Very enjoyable."
"Very nice."
"Opinion: This is a spectacularly clean beer. I dont know how much different this version is to their regular Tripel, but it seems that this one is more reserved than their standard offering."
"Very pretty reddish-brown colouring, nice big fluffy Belgian head that subsided to a nice lace. Smells almost like wine, a bit yeasty. Very pretty, delicate nose. Taste is immediately very nutty with a slight spiciness, coriander. A very mellow, warm brew, a bit of zing on the tongue. I really enjoyed this one to the last drop. Even after drinking, the nuttiness sticks in the throat. I'd drink more but for the ABV. I left Microbar rather buzzed after trying my few!"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. Purchased in NC, heck yead, at Brawley's for $8. Dating was on bail, best before 121009. The bottle says it can be aged for up to 5 years so this one must be fairly ""fresh""."
"Marvelously smooth, velvety mouthfeel with medium heft. One of the best examples of the style I've found, I didn't get a lot of the cloying sweetness that others speak of. After a string of domestic, too-sweet tripels, this is a welcome, sessionable work of art."
"The head is mid-sized, fizzy, and an off-white cream. Beer is hazy, orange-gold. Cloudy on last pour. Sweet candy in the nose: citrus, bubblegum, some spice and a touch of wood. Nice! Fruity bubblegum pepper up front. It turns very buttery in the tingly, caramel middle. Leaves fruity, zesty, with loads of bubblegum. Some corn and alcohol in the aftertaste. It is good. Very tasty, fruity, buttery caramel middle. The only chink in the armor is a touch of rubbing alcohol in the aftertaste, but it goes away at a more appropriate drinking temperature. Man, I love a good tripel."
"Served in a chalice from a 750ml bottle; hazy yellow color, with a thin white head that leaves a nice lacing. Odor is almost non-existent, other than a slight hint of Belgian yeast. Flavor is fairly sweet, with a little hint of lemon in the background. Quite malty, with the smallest trace of bitterness left on the tongue as an aftertaste. Not the best tripel I've tasted, but definitely very good."
"11.2oz. brown bottle with picture of abbey on the front. Beer poured a cloudy dark orange color with foamy off-white head on top that goes down moderately producing some lacing. Deep fruity aroma with perhaps just a hint of dark chocolate and brown sugar. Very light banana creampie or chocolate banana ice cream feeling. This is probably the most enjoyable smelling beer I've ever tried. Tasted of roasted malt with a bit of smokiness and burnt sugar. Roasted/toasted aftertaste. Nice warm coating on edges of tongue. Very balanced mouthfeel--not as thick or overbearing as you might expect it to be. I could drink another...if I needed to. Definitely a session beer."
"A gourgeous pour into a bowl chalice with a large foamy head. The aroma is sweet like cotton candy. The taste and mouthfeel are thick and slick. Too much malt and candi sugars bring down the experience of this brew. The alcohol is well hidden but, you can feel it by the end. I would say that there are plenty of tripels out there to be drank."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"750 ml silk-print corked (champagne style) brown bottle, bought in Denmark. Golden colour, slightly hazy, pours with an enormous, fluffy and lingering white head. Very nice aroma of yeast, oak, brown candy sugar, horse stable and cigars. Slightly spicy and peppery flavour with tolerable maltiness and hops, and a slight alcoholic bite. Aftertaste is okay, but does not last ""forever"". Not a particularly complex flavour, but a good beer all the same."
"I tried the Watou tripel with a BB of: 02/04/07. The 330ml bottle with what I am assuming is the St Bernard abbey on the label poured a dull tangerine or flat honey colour, and large pieces of yeast freely floating despite the bottle being stored upright for 9 months in my cellar. Head is bright white and fine, with beautiful screen-lacing like fresh washed pillows or white blankets. The layer of foam stays consistent and creamy throughout, and actually becomes better after a few sips and some swirls. A very good look, though I do not fancy the free-floating yeast chunks. Strong green-apple peel immediately on the nose. Some light but buttery maltiness above the rim, followed by that tang, almost chemical-like, of the apple peel; candy apple, definite pear, some metallic notes, and roasted, nutty bread. Pear and green apple are the predominant aromas. The aroma is also quite bitter to the nose, like orange peel. An appetising, fruit-filled aroma. The taste is all malt at first, medium-roasted and doughy. In the middle comes a slight tartness from the fruit flavours, again all apples, with apricot and a hint of estery warmth. Iron, red malt, cider, white sugar, lime, and lactose. Some typical yeast tastes, adding a milkiness to the palate. The finish is quite terse, leaving little besides a subdued fruit and some hoppy dryness. No taste really lingers. A fine tasting beer, but not overly complex or original in taste. The lees were murky and offered a stronger, and better fruit taste. The aroma led me to believe the taste would be just as tart and fruity, but it was not; until I tasted the sediment separately. The mouthfeel is just how I like a beer: this is unctuous and mouth-coating, full bodied, syrupy and low in carbonation. Velvet in the mouth. Of course that aids drinkability, as does the relatively low bite of alcohol in the flavour. A very respectable tripel, and one I would love to try again."
"Pours a two-finger off-white head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy, light amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is lemony. Some yeast is visible, taste is sweet that mellows to a tart finish. Alcohol is not noticeable. 750ml bottle for $8.90 from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Good mouthfeel. Light for the style, but full enough to let me know I'm drinking a real beer. I would have another."
"I brought this sample back from Brugge, Belgium. It has a drink by date of 17-03-08. My bottle says it is 7.5% ABV."
"This one pours a cloudy yellow color with a tremendous head that has good retention and leaves lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. Looks more like a witbier, actually. The aroma is mostly comprised of spices and citrus. Not much else ... or those drown out everything else. The flavor has a lot of the spice and citrus as well as a grainy character with fruits and a slight alcohol. The flavor could be stronger, but isn't. The body is pretty full and creamy with lots of carbonation. The drinkability was good on this one."
"A disappointing offering from St. Bernardus. Thank goodness they've got their other Tripel (as well as their Abt 12) to make people look the other way."
"Overall Impression: I was thirsty for a tripel and this is scratching the itch. That said, I dont think this measures up to the St. Bernardus Tripel. The beers are close, but the St. B version just seems to have a little more quality to it. I want to try a blind side by side just as a study. The overall taste is fairly subdued and subtle. Still, not a bad tripel and a happy karma point earned."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. It pours a nice hazy oranged yellow color with a billowing 3 finger head that falls to 2 fingers. The nose is spicey and lemoney/orangey sweet. Smells nice. The flavor is nice as well, but not quite strong enough for me. It is slightly creamy like a hefe, but with a peppery spiceyness. The feel is nice and thick and creamy. Overall, this is a really nice brew. No hint of any alcohol. Just good beer here."
"A good beer, albeit a bit on the lighter side, missing some strength I expect in a triple. Color is appropriate, but the head died quickly. I like this beer, but it's not nearly the best belgium triple I've tasted. Creamy and smooth. Well constructed. Slight bitter finish. Nose is sweet and easy."
"Thanks to francisweizen for the bottle!"
"Drinkability  The flavors here are a bit subtle, so if you liked to be smacked around in the taste buds when drinking Abbey Tripels this may not be your cup of tea. But man oh man this beer defines a velvety mouthfeel."
"This was an awesome Tripel. Very drinkable though I would have to recommend the St. Bernardus Tripel also from the Watou brewery in place of this unless you've already had the St. Bernardus Tripel and would like to give this a whirl given the opportunity. It is definately worth it."
"I find this nectar highly drinkable, but I must temper that with the fear of the high alcohol content. This could be dangerous."
"Another bottle a year later and observe yeasty malty. Two years later and observe head, malty, drinkability."
"One from the st Bernard at Watou is always prommissing. Has the same fruitsmell as Westvleteren 8 what is of course top of the bill. Appearance is somehow less though however a great head( what a amout of carbon dioxide must be in there) with a bronze colour. Smell is apricot/citrussy with koreander and very malty. What a palate so to say. Taste then is litle less though, sweet, fruity and malt make a nice palate however in my eyes not that well balanced. Just to sweet. Further just litle hops if you come from the region of poperinge. Aftertaste sweet again! But don't take me wrong, if this one would be a litle less sweet and they would ad some (extra) hops in this brew it would be something great."
"A white rocky head, color is amber/orange with lots of effervescence. Retains a nice layer and a sticky lace. Aroma is sweet - candy sugar, lightly spicy with fruity esters. Flavor has a sweet start with a light yeasty bite. Palate is highly carbonated, light bodied and creamy. A drinkable beer, yet nothing memorable and not a great representation of the style."
"Nice hazy golden-orange tone. Thick and voluptuous head of white rocky foam. Retention is outstanding and the lace clings like a mofo. Aroma is bready and doughy. Just how I like my tripels. Cookie-doughish. A little spicy, peppery. And I perceive bubblegum as well on the nose. The flavors folow suit with the nose to an extent. Bubblegum, sweet bread doughy flavors, cracked black pepper, must and lemongrass. Nice little blend. The mouthfeel is spritzy in it's carbonation. Maybe just a tad too spritzy. Body is close to medium. All in all, a solid tripel."
"Awully tasty, zesty, sweet...and a little bit strong, ...this lands in the good category, and that's very fine."
"Sharp spicy taste, prickly mouthfeel with a dry finish. Very refreshing beer, very upbeat. The head was a huge cap of white foam that receded a bit quicker than I'd like. Cloudy orange carries lots of haze and yeast with a steady stream of bubbles. Fruity taste and aroma with a slight musty note to the aroma. Very drinkable, all the great traits of the bigger tripels, but low enough ABV that you can enjoy more of it."
"A good solid beer that I would come back to."
"This poured a deep golden to amber color with a thick, rich, creamy white head. Champagne like bubbles continued to fill the head for many minutes after the pour. Just a light white lace remained after the drink. The nose is a sweet malty goodness, maybe some figs or dates on the backend with just a touch of hops. Nice malt taste piercing through on the 1st sip, but this had more hops in the flavor than I expected. The hops and a touch of the alcohol come through mid-drink to balance the beer. Maybe just a little too much of a bite from the alcohol. It has a wonderfully light mouth feel, and despite the high alcohol punch is very drinkable. Great example of the style"
"11.2oz Bottle Best Before 01 06 07 Pored a slightly golden orange with a huge head atop. Beautiful aroma that is fruity,floral, spicy and as previously mentioned a hint of bubblegum is in the mix. Crisp and well carbonated mouthfeel that is smooth and with an airy feel as though floating in your mouth. Flavor is lemony and spicy with nice yeast notes. This is better than the other Tripel in my opinion and a good one at that."
"Overall Impression: Quite different for a tripel. Almost like a weizenbock (lots of esters and phenols, bready). Not a show-stopper, but definitely a good stand-by, all-purpose beer."
"Essentially unbalancet to the sweet."
"Caliginous orange color on the pour, the head is cumbrous in size, spumescent in its consistency, brilliant white in color as it putresces the lace left behind forms a fine lattice-work upon the glass. The aroma of butterscotch, sweet malt, yeast, fresh and clean, the start ambrosial with a fine malt backing, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Moderately acidic, the hops understated in their presence, quite dry and long lasting, quite drinking and not the least bit overpowering, well worth a sample."
