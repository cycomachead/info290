Smell: nectarine, white grape, pils-y semi sweetness, moderate spiciness. Taste: apricot jam, dried pineapple, spicy, a bit of a crackery backing, with peach skin and a note of earth in the finish. Body thins out a bit much and finishes a little powdery, but it's quite tasty.","babaracas","Nov 09, 2014"

This is a complex melange of full bodied yeast, sugary alcohol, with also an assertive floral/piney/herbal hop character, all woven together to make for an intense but memorable brew.","mick303","Jun 13, 2014"

Candy-like aroma, long on bubble gum. The taste is quite pleasant, if, perhaps, a little more confectionary than other leading tripels. There's banana, there's cotton candy, but it's a sophisticated sweetness--both inviting and satisfying. Texture is sufficiently rich.","Altrurian","May 01, 2014"

There is a light citrusy hop character and a slight buttery aspect, but not like diacetyl, like short termed Chardonnay barrel aging. It's intriguing nonetheless. The flavors are light and citrusy. The yeast is mild yet flavorful. It is what I would call an off dry. There is a light and clean hoppiness. It has nice flavor and does what it promises. It drinks light in body with a light yeasty dryness. I like it. This beer was a great buy at $8.99. Pretty Things continues to impress.","aasher","Jun 26, 2012"

Wheat malt up front that quickly transitions to a combination of citrus hops and sweet fruity banana into the middle.

It's subtly hopped-up, refreshing, and has a beautifully creamy texture that I personally think is to die for. This is not a beer you could call forgettable.

Nose of light spicing, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove over a toasted grain backbone. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a slightly tangy, syrupy sweet highlight. Toasted grain backbone with some citrus sweet don't balance well, and the spicing just gets in the way. Too light to really effect the palate, the spicing seems superfluous. Smooth, full body with a rich, sweet, and slightly spicy aftertaste. The finish starts smooth and transitions into a spiced, slightly sharp feel.

3.7,-8.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O: The intent here seems to be for the hops to accentuate, but not dominate. That is exactly what they do. Don't be expecting a Belgian IPA riddled with American hops. The hop tastes are mellow and seem predominately English, though the American hops shine through too (and more-so as the beer warms). I never really thought those oily/leafy tastes that English hops bring to the table really meshed well with the tripel style. American hops are the better play, accentuating the tropical esters (which are also largely absent here) by adding citrusy/tropical tastes of their own. Perhaps my memory fails me, but this beer is not what I remember it being when I had it a year or two ago. I find myself slightly underwhelmed. It has some complexity, but it comes mostly from the hops rather than the base beer. Still, I can't leave it without some praise. It is very drinkable, and its more charming attributes begin to grow on you as you drink. Definitely worth a try, and I will make an effort to revisit it in the near future. I had given it glowing reviews in the past; maybe I'm having an off night.","ryan1788a5","Apr 13, 2012"

3.88,-4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The aroma was akin to some kind of spicy green tea at first. Lots of light grain, yeast aromas of fresh leaves and a touch of light citrus sprinkled in. A spiciness I am assuming from the Basil leaves, very intresting aroma for sure. The flavor was light, nicely balanced with a lightly grainy start to it, that turned over to some light fruit, peaches? Maybe green apples, coming through in the middle with that nice light and very fresh leaf like flavor. Hints of spice rippled throughout, especially in the finish which was dry and nicely accented.","mikesgroove","Aug 01, 2011"

4.22,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This was quite good and is definitely one of the better takes on an American Tripel that I’ve had out of the bottle. This just has a lot of fresh hop character to it that is nicely complimented by the spice and fruit flavors that the Belgian yeast brought to this. I think that the freshness is the key with this one though. If you haven’t had it yet, I’d wait until the next batch at this rate.","Kegatron","Jun 21, 2011"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"O: Overall this was a very good tripel. It's pretty much as the description goes, it's a tripel with a good hop smell and flavor to it. It mainly just adds to the fruitiness of the beer and gives it a bit more character.","Dope","Jun 20, 2011"
3.68,-8.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a pretty big head on it. The lacing was pretty good as well. The smell of the beer is floral and sweet with a light hoppy aroma in the mix. The taste was sweet upfront and settled into a nice floral spice flavor. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side. Overall I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and I would enjoy having it again one day.","Knapp85","Jun 01, 2011"
3.96,-2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Fuller bodied than expected with a crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the spice, yeast, alcohol and light fruit notes into a slightly dry finish. The floral hops give off a dry, earthy bitterness with some soil/pine character up front which counter the sweeter notes of the beer pretty nicely. Not overly hoppy but just enough to add some complexity and balance. The hops are complimented by some zesty spice, namely pepper, coriander and candy sugar. I'm also picking up some citrus and other light fruits, orange peel, apple, pear and apricot. There is a lot of alcohol flavor toward the end of the palate but I wouldn't really call this beer hot. This is a unique twist on the triple style that they pulled off pretty well.","corby112","May 26, 2011"

Light mouthfeel, and quite drinkable.","Rifugium","May 20, 2011"

4.3,6.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," The flavor up front is yeasty, tangy and gently sweet with a mild malt body and hint of ripe tropical fruit which leads to a more citrus and spice flavor and the bitterness comes forward in the middle. The flavor is lightly toasted in the malt dept and a slight grassy herbal element also peeks through with only a slight amount of alcohol in the flavor. The gentle citrus notes add a mild level of astringency and you get the idea there is some candy sugar as the flavor leans to the sweet side but a hint of hoppiness is still present in the finish. I liked this beer a lot, it is a satisfying and drinkable beer for the abv, I think it fits the style well -a hoppier, more American take on the tripel style which is refereshing and well brewed.","Slatetank","May 10, 2011"
3.58,-11.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O- Definitely an American version because of the aggressive hops. It actually has a nice balance to it though with the Belgian yeast which can be pretty dominant in many tripels.","Wisconsinality","May 06, 2011"

3.58,-11.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"o - Overall it's ok. I've been finding that Pretty Things has a a style to the flavor and sometimes it works (I LOVE Baby Tree and Jack D'Or...and don't even get me started on Our Finest Regards) and other times it is a bit off. None-the-less, this is a brewery worth checking out and I will continue to try their catalog. I could see people loving this one and I can also see them not being blown away (which was the case for me). Easy drinker though...just a bit overboard on bubblegum...kind of like if Short's made a beer called bubblegum.","cosmicevan","Apr 29, 2011"

3.48,-13.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: Overall, a decent tripel, though nothing special.

Flavor is of sweet pale malts (grainy), apples/pears, Belgian spice, white peppercorns, and finishes with a sharp herbal/citrus hoppy bite. Very sharp/prickly carbonation. Leaves a slightly tart/earthy flavor on the tongue. Probably my favorite offering by Pretty Things. I will definitely be sending out these this spring/summer as extras.","muttyd","Apr 04, 2011"
4.23,4.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Beer is a nice golden sunset yellow, very cloudy with a nice thin white head. Aroma is belgian funk and crisp pears and green apples. Taste is unique for a Tripel. There is still the funky Belgian yeast but there is also this slight hop bitterness at the end. The hops really go well with the sweetness of the upfront flavors. It makes this Tripel one of the most drinkible and thirst quenching out there. I love the different take on one of my favorite styles!","Liverpool08","Apr 02, 2011"

The hops are deep in the background. Taste is light and crisp with a lot of carbonation. A refreshing lemon/orange juiciness upfront with a full middle of some doughy sour malt that finishes with a strong tingle and a dry lemon peel finish.

4.27,5.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow into my Duvel tulip. Judged on the first pour alone I would have scored a 3 for appearance, as a two finger white cap formed and dissipated quickly without leaving much lacing behind. The second pour was a bit better though, with a 3+ finger head that stuck around at least briefly. Still not much in the way of lace though, and this is one style where I definitely have some expectations in that department. The nose is decent, an appreciable sweetness and some juicy citrus hop notes fill in where usually I'd notice the yeast's influence. Fluffy White Rabbits is a damn tasty beer, a brief opening hop bitterness quickly fades and is replaced by traditional tripel pale malt sweetness and yeast spiciness. The beer closes beautifully with the aforementioned hops, still juicy and citrusy. The mouthfeel is appropriately light for the style, with a nice bubbly carbonation. No booziness at 8.5% is always appreciated, and helps make this beer disappear quickly, though any brew that tastes this good isn't bound to last long in my glass. Another wonderful beer from Dann Paquette at Pretty Things, but that's par for the course from them.","axeman9182","Jun 02, 2010"

Some banana and clove with honey and candi sugar notes. Not much hop pick up in the aroma. Light but seems spot on for the style. The taste starts off with a sweet tropical fruit note, some citrus, floral honey and light clove. The sweet transitions rather abruptly into an astringent, chalky bitterness from the hops. Can't say that it is very pleasant luckily it is not too strong. The feel is light with tingly carbonation, the hops give an odd chalky feel not typically present in tripels. ABV seems well hidden. An average tripel. The actual tripel flavors were actually pretty good but I didn't really care for what the hops brought to the party. It made the beer astringent and chalky which is not typical for the style.","Gmann","May 12, 2010"

3.85,-4.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"22oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my Gouden Carolus goblet. Mar 2010 indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Love the label - the art from this brewer is great. Poured a slightly hazy orange-gold with lots of tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head consisted of a half inch, loose, bright white cap that quickly dissipated into a fizzy slick, with a bubbly band around the edges - no lacing on this one. Nose reveals citrus notes upfront (maybe lemon zest), with a hint of coriander and a light, wheaty quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - something of a grassy character in the middle. Definitely a light, herbal hoppiness that expresses itself at the finish, but not as big I was anticipating. Overall the flavors have a nice balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an assertive carbonation that falls just shy of prickly - almost has a palate cleansing feel to it. Some citrus astringency comes out and lightly stimulates the salivary glands in the cheeks. This is a pretty good tripel. A nice blend of flavors, maybe lacking some of the candi sugar notes I've come to associate with the style, but definitely a respectable beer and another solid offering from Pretty Things.","Jwale73","0"

Pours out a hazy light yellow, even green color with a fluffy/frothy two finger head that has beastly retention. Leaves thick lacing, everything is great but I am not a huge fan of the strange color. The smell is hard to get much. I do get Belgian yeast notes, like bread and spice. Some citrus peel comes through as well as some wheat-like malt. Needs more strength for sure. Taste is decent. Some wheat-like malt but it mostly just Belgian yeast notes. The spice notes are too much for me. Citrus peel comes into play but doesn't add much. The hop flavor is grassy and adds too much bitterness. The balance is out of whack on this beer. To me it ends up just tasting like fancy soap with a few redeeming aspects. The mouthfeel needs work. The carbonation and body are lacking way too much for such a big beer. It isn't creamy at all, it is just really watery and lacking carbonation. There is an oily aspect that I am not a fan of either. The bitter coat is also just too much. Drinkability is decent. The price is not worth it for the quality of this one. A decent taste but the mouthfeel just kills it.

On the one hand, it had that great sugary Belgian tripel flavor, but then you can't help but notice the great hop flavor that balances everything off nicely. Neither dominates the other, they just work perfectly together. Mouthfeel was spot on for a great Belgian style ale, just enough body and noticeable alcohol presence.

More bright, juicy fruit comes through in the taste along with the big hop presence, and dry champagne like finish. Mouthfeel is right smack dab in the middle, and perfectly carbonated for this style. The more you drink the more you can notice the lingering hop bitterness that this beer gives off.
