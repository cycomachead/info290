3.68,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of apricot, orange, pear, apple, plum, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of apricot, orange, pear, apple, plum, light banana, clove, pepper, honey, cadi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of apricot, orange, plum, pear, apple, clove, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel style. Good balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 10, 2014"

It had a good fruity Belgian yeast aroma that yielded a sweet and fruity flavor with plenty of the Belgian yeast notes of candy sugars and cloves. There was little to no perceptible bitterness to this incredibly smooth and highly drinkable triple. It had a high ABV which was well hidden and made it presence known as I drank this tasty triple too quickly.","brurevu","Oct 19, 2013"

It smelled fantastic when I opened the bottle and had a really nice color when I poured it into the glass. There was very little head and it did not last long. The flavor did not match the smell. It had kind of a sour milk taste to it that lingered in the back of my mouth that made me crave for something sweet. The 10%abv was well masked by the aftertaste. Definitely not one of their better offerings.","Canslammer","Aug 27, 2012"

Aromas of nutmeg, coriander, and boozey sweet characteristics. The flavors are well blended and crisp, and you get a mouthful of spices at the end of the beer. Other flavors include a slightly sour malt characteristic, booze, and hints of citrus. The body is light and crisp for the style, IMHO. This beer has a mid-bodied lacing it leaves on the glass, but the beer is slick, so it settles back into the beer after a bit. Aftertaste is mostly the spices, with a slight touch of the sourness right at the end. The finish is a bit rich, and that definitely maintains this beer as a sipper, as a Tripel or any beer at this ABV is meant to be.","GarthDanielson","Mar 12, 2011"

This beer is quite heavy with low carbonation and high TG, all combined to make it more noticeable to drink than just about any Triple I have had. All this said, the beer isn't flawed at all. I am mentally lumping it into the ""Quadruple"" style since that can be so much more varied. With that in mind, the beer is pretty decent.

The beer did finish kind of quick, there are some lingering faint clove and alcohol flavors, but I was hoping for maybe a little bit more. It still has a very good flavor. Mouthfeel is good, about the right carbonation for a tripel. It's an above average beer. There are so many great tripels out there, that it is hard to stack this one up against them.

Lighter notes of the banana and spice that are typical of the style. Also some notes of the alcohol. The taste is OK, with some of the banana notes and yeastiness. Alcohol taste also.

The retention is quite good, and although it drops it does maintain a thin surface covering through the first quarter of the glass. Lacing could be better, however, and it leaves only thin splashes here and there. The nose is bright with a judicious amount of yeasty phenolic and fruitiness (bubblegum, some plastic, soft dark berries, dark fruit skins) and a candyish and sugar-cookie dough like maltiness. It's surprisingly soft in the mouth with a full body and standard carbonation (one might expect a higher level in a tripel). The malt is rich and luxurious without being overly sweet, and the phenolic character (which adds a bit of spiciness here) really rounds it out and completes it. An undercurrent of grassy and leafy hops gives it even more depth. The bitterness is appropriately balancing, and in combination with the spiciness of the yeast it finishes drying despite all of the dextrins that are left in the mouth. It's quite nice and very enjoyable, and the excellent malt character present in all of the other Anderson Valley beers is still here, but it does fall short of the finest examples from Belgium.","NeroFiddled","May 04, 2005"

3.23,-7.2,4.5,4,3,3,2.5,"Drinkability- This was one of the hardest beers for me to finish. Very different indeed. It started out good, but quickly got sickening sweet. A 4oz sampler would have been perfect.","GClarkage","Mar 13, 2005"
2.85,-18.1,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,"overall a decent brew, nothing outrageous that one would expect from such a great brewery. it hides the high alcohol decently (you do feel it warming the gullet) nothing to write home about and surely not in the class of belgian trips.","Ego","Mar 12, 2005"

2.93,-15.8,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Bill was off right from the start, with the bartender sputtering something about Avery (hello Houston, we have a problem), but straightened things out pretty quickly and let it go. Filmy ghost of ultra, weight-loss thin sheeting that has little to no stick. Funky malt and candy drool on nose. Caramel on mouth almost overwhelms, while alcohol hits over the head like Popeye on spinach; volumatic contagion of fung casts a wide net and flim-flams the mouth.","Truh","Beers"
3.55,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Wine like cherry gold appearance...very little head. Smell is fruity with yeast undertones...not bad, but not spectacular either. Taste is lightly fruity with some alcohol nortes, but not bad for a 10 abv. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet dry, probably this brew's most redeeming quality. Drinkability is decent for the high abv,,,,goes down smooth enough. A decent brew but nowhere near the quality of other trippels I have tried.","edchicma","0"
3.34,-4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"No head on a pale transparent and unimpressive amber color body. The smell is very sweet, mostly apple with some banana and bubble gum notes and some cloves. Only slightly yeasty. The taste is sweet, with fruity esters of banana and apple and some light herbal notes. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for 10%. Slightly floury in the mouthfeel. This beer is very light bodied for a tripel. Pretty weak.","tjd25","Feb 14, 2005"
2.88,-17.2,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Taste: Light carbonation, sweet maltyness with an obvious high octane punch. Blindfolded, I probably would not have guessed this was a tripel, too sweet, lacks a little effervescence and a little too much booze.","Goldorak","Feb 14, 2005"

3.85,10.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"As others have mentioned here, this Triple is not as good as one would expect from Anderson Valley. It's still not bad, and certainly doesn't deserve ratings of 2 to 3, but it doesn't hold a candle to other triples in it's price range (Allagash, New Belgium, Dark Horse, Unibroue, Avery). I wouldn't buy this one again, but it was interesting to try.","Mitchster","Jan 28, 2005"
4.25,22.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours with a non-descript white head settling over clear deeply golden liquid. Strange metallic nose sensed after pouring, but disappeared after warming in the glass, replaced by some tropical/light banana yeasty character. The taste is quite good with rich maltiness, more tropical notes and a good balancing hop bitterness combining very nicely. Not much of the 10% alcohol is tasted at all. Finishes malty and rich, very drinkable and a well done take on the Tripel style","beerluvr","Jan 15, 2005"
2.98,-14.4,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a medium copper with a nice fluffy off-white head. Lots of tiny streaming bubbles. Mild aromas of candy sugar, pineapples, and bananas. Bananas lead the palate brigade, with candy sugar tagging along. Alcohol is noticable, but well-controlled. Mouthfeel is quite syrupy and thick, with little bitterness to offer another side of this beer. A drinkable beer, but a bit unbalanced for me. Too sweet with little contrasting brightness. Give it a try if you find it, but not really worth searching for.","winomark","Jan 08, 2005"
3.1,-10.9,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall the worst hing about this is the mouth feel...too overbearingly sweet...lacks complexity too....pretty average effort overall..","ZAP","Dec 08, 2004"

3.71,6.6,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Solid yeasty alcohol aroma, just perfect. Small off-white head never amounted to much and faded to nothing,not a trace anywhere, it's kind of weird. Flavor is kind of appley sweet up front, becomes a bit doughy towards the middle and the alcohol kicks in and takes it down to your stomach. Transparent, deep golden colored beer with streams of fine bubbles floating to the surface. I would definitely drink this beer again, but as far as triples go I'm not hooked.","HappyHourHero","Nov 23, 2004"
2.86,-17.8,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Kudos to the brewery for taking a shot at the style, but they didn't quite pull it off. Nice color, but far less carbonated than customary for the style. Would have seemed almost flat, but for the pepper lent by the alcohol. A good deal of caramel malt flavor gave the beer an unpolished, unfinished character. Nice yeast flavors, but at odds with the rough edges. I think they need to tinker with this beer a bit more.","Brent","Nov 21, 2004"
4.3,23.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Very cool bottle with the wax on the top. Gives me a Maker's Mark feel. Pours a golden color with a tall head that has great retention and leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice - lots of spice and citrus. The flavor has a nice malt character and is quite spicy and a little peppery. I really enjoyed this beer and would have it again if not for the price.","clvand0","Nov 06, 2004"
4.2,20.7,4,4,4,4,5,"Thanks to clvand0 for bringing this beer over for me to try. This beer pours a beautiful golden amber color with 2 fingers of head that stick around. The nose has some good spicey characters from the yeast and really good orange tones from the malt. This smells divine after 2 weeks of Utah beers. The flavor is awesome. There is some peppery character along with the orange flavor in the malts. I like this beer. Its just a hint short on flavor, but not too shabby. The feel is moderate, right about where I want it to be. Shit man. This is 10%...they do hide the alcohol very very well. For a beer of this size, the drinkability is really good as well. A fine beer...very nice.","kmpitz2","Oct 29, 2004"
3.59,3.2,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"What little head came from the pour dies down very fast. The beer comes out clear with an almost reddish tinge to it. Yeast alive and well in the smell.

3.68,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dry on the mouth and aftertaste. It is an easy sipping dubble. A tiny amount of alcohol presence just to let the drinker know it is there. This triple goes down smooth and easy. Maybe too easy. Don't drink too many. I enjoyed this beer.","Rumrunner","Sep 29, 2004"
2.95,-15.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"The sugars and malt keep the booze almost unnoticed at a stiff 10%.

Plenty of malt and some alcohol come through very clear. Some additional character would do wonders for this beer. This seems like a pretty average strong ale with the yeast swapped out for some of the belgian stuff. It's a little too sharp in the mouth; though I'm not having any problems downing this bottle.","watermelonman","Jun 27, 2004"

3.23,-7.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a brilliantly clear deep copper color and it topped by a tan head. The aroma is fairly clean, with notes of apple and alcohol dominating the nose. The nose seems to have a certain creamy richness to it. The taste is creamy and buttery as well, it is a bit off putting in some way. I get notes of vanilla, butter, and apples. This just does not do it for me, there is no one flavor that I can point to as the culprit, but as a whole it just is off. All the rest of their beers are incredible, this on the other hand just doesn't work, and is certainly not what I would call a Triple.","Gueuzedude","Jun 22, 2004"
