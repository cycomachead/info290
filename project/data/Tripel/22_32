The smell of fruit and hops filled the glass as I poured it and the champagne like bubbles were overwhelmingly graceful!  The aromas were fantastic!  Then after a quick settle the taste of this was just perfect!  It was sweet and warming, and the unfiltered goodness fills your mouth with malty flavors.  I highly suggest trying the ""holy water"" and giving Canada a thumbs up for one GREAT beer!","JPowell712","Feb 15, 2015"

Powerful aroma full of fruity esters, medicinal phenols, spice. In the taste, overripe banana and peach, stale malts, harsh phenols, almost like a vodka spike, pepper and clove. Medium body, sticky, too much fusel/solventy booze for a ""lower"" ABV brew.

Not a great looking beer, light without much of a head. Excellent smell although not real strong. Taste is similar, very good to excellent but not as much, shall I say bang as I would like, but very smooth. Extremely drinkable for the ABV which gives it bonus points overall and decent value, at least at the price I paid.

Aroma mildly spicy hints of chamomile or lavender something herbal and definite coriander, herbal grassy hops are minimal mainly the yeast spiciness that Belgian style ales are known to offer. Hints of pineapple, spicy coriander mild citrus tones, the rest of the palate is a relatively clean grassiness to finish. Overall a lighter version of a tripel, less alcohol does increase drinkability and there's really no booze left to burn the palate or nares in this one, sometimes I feel La Fin du Monde get's a bit alcohol fueled. Mouthfeel light carbonation compared to most of the Unirbroue ales, medium bodied the yeast spiciness lingers between sips but I find it enjoyable overall not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it, it's been one of the those beers I always wanted to grab but either there were better options when I did find it or it wasn't available at all.","WVbeergeek","Nov 01, 2013"

Sweet aroma, reminiscent of cider -- I really like it. Reminds me of CBC tripel threat, which is awesome. Flavor registers quite a bit lower on the sweetness. Grassy and herbal, with a relatively thin and fizzy mouthfeel, and a hint of sugar in the aftertaste, but still pretty dry. Fantastic balance, actually. I don't think it has the depth of flavor of La Fin Du Monde, but it has every bit as much drinkability and more. Quite a delicious treat.","hreb","Jul 26, 2013"

4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a golden yellow with good head and minor lace. Aroma is one of that typical yeasty, orange-like Belgian strain, as well as some sweetness from candi sugar(?) (which is typical description, mind you), and something like tropical or just plush fruit esters. The mouthfeel is more of the same, light spices poke your tongue as the body is light and somewhat creamy so it passes over the tongue real easy and the lower-than-usual ABV doesn't punish you at all. Beer tastes great as it is a not an exceptional triple, but is well-crafted and a great beer to have (not to sound redundant). The balance between not only the spices but malts and fruit is great, as I get a light-fruity beer with something like tropical fruit (magno, pineapple) and other fruits like apple, pear, orange, banana (the last two are lightly noticed), along with some sweet malt tastes. A great triple that I enjoyed sipping on and is a must try.","clayrock81","Nov 12, 2012"

The aroma was wonderful with hints of pineapple and very sweet candy. Taste - I found generally to be quite similar to La Fin Du Monde, only turned up a notch in the sweetness department. It's of course got that signature 'Ale On Lees' Unibroue stamp, which I love. Not a bad thing at all. The breadiness, herb/spices, and crisp, yeast aspects balance out the sweetness well. The fact that it is so well-rounded is probably it's biggest strength. Does not feel heavy in body and has just the right amount of alcohol warming. Not quite as complex as your 'Belgian' Belgians, but don't hesitate to order this or pick it up if it's at your local beer store...","Neorebel","Nov 02, 2012"

Head retention is fairly minimal though. The nose is chock full of esters. Lots of pale fruit aromas swimming around, and balanced by just a little bit of clove. The flavor profile is similarly unbalanced. The fruity esters are superb, with waves of apple, peach, apricot, mango, and a little bit of pear all present and vying for attention. The only problem is that there's not much else to the beer at all. As in the nose, there's a little bit of a phenolic clove presence, but it's very much buried in the background. The body is just a hair too chewy for my taste, but it's a close thing. The carbonation, on the other hand, is flawless. It's very lively, lending the beer some levity and excitement. Eau Benite is a tasty beer, it's just not complex enough to hang with the best tripels. Then again, given that Unibroue also makes La Fin Du Monde, it was going to be hard for Eau Benite to live up to the inevitable comparisons.","axeman9182","Sep 19, 2012"

The nose comprises Belgian yeast, light white bread, very light cardamom, clove, and banana peel. The taste holds notes of Belgian yeast, light flaky biscuit, coriander, cardamom, black pepper, clove, banana, and some tufts of grass or there. There's a surprising amount of breadiness in there, but it in no way detracts from the usual tripel-ness. Not bad. The body is a light medium, with a barely-light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a solid tripel, not quite as good as La Fin, but more than solid in and of itself.","TMoney2591","Nov 15, 2011"

This is not to say that the nose was offensive, but rather that is was bright with ripe fruits and malty elements not otherwise common in a tripel.

Mouth also light with a low alcohol beverage, which allows to drink like whey. It collects a little spiciness, but it was his soft side, even grainy (as some wheat beers) emerges, with hints of exotic fruits, with the addition of a slight spicy bitterness. Very strange for a triple because both nearly as tasty and as bitter as the standards of the genre. With the advantage of being easy to drink.","ThaCreep","Nov 27, 2010"

Smells sweet, with tropical fruits, grains, malts, alcohol and dark fruits(raisins, figs, dates...). Tastes delicious. A satisfying sweetness that isn't cloying or overpowering. The malts create a platform for the fruit sweetness. Still, the aftertaste has a bit of a tangy bitterness. Orange peels, or a hop I can't quite recognise? Who cares, as long as it is good. And this is beyong a good beer. It's a great beer worthy of the Unibroue brewery. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and crisp. For a high alcohol brew, this is highly drinkable. In fact, I don't think the drinkability can be improved. So I must give it a five.","slitherySOB","Sep 06, 2004"

4.38,9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I had to pick this up in B.C. because it is no longer sold in Alberta for some reason. Poured from a brown 750 ml caged and corked bottle, I like the little poem on the back label, both in English and French (although I prefer the French version better). Served in a glass chalice the head is immense on the initial pour, a massive creamy cloud-like expanse, capping a hazed deep golden body with intense carbonation. The bouquet is light and effervescent, very uplifting to inhale. Light grains, honey, vanilla, with a bit of a tropical papaya-like character, and some spiciness. The mouthfeel is also very light and effervescent for an ale of 7.7% abv, very velvety and smooth, this is a very well named ale. Mild spice on the first sip that warms your insides, banana, clove and some vanilla. Fruit esters come out in the middle, like candied papaya and banana, while the finish is rather low key as all these flavours blend into one. Remarkable balance. It's been years and years since I've tried this stuff, and I don't remember it being so good, a shame that I can't find it around these parts very easily. A triumph of the brewing alchemy that Unibroue can perform.","IronDjinn","Jul 11, 2004"

Aroma is mostly sweet, quite fruity, with a hint of spice. Fruit comes through big in the taste as well; here it struck me as rather melon-like, with hints of tropical fruit.

4.42,10,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Carefully poured it's a clear deep golden color. Adding the yeasty sediment clouds it but also adds a softer character and stronger vanilla tones. The off-white head is creamy and displays good retention but leaves only limited lace about the glass. The nose offers an interesting yeastiness that displays vanilla, clove, and soft fruit (apples, berry, papaya, melon). It's very fine, natural carbonation softly caresses the tongue; and although the body is light, it's creaminess gives it the impression of a fuller body. Vanilla returns in the flavor along with a softly sweet maltiness that's backed by gentle fruit (apple, pear, mild strawberry) and a light touch of alcohol that gently lingers on the palate following the swallow. It's quite unique; and very impressive in just that! I've never had a beer similar to this; and although it did take a little bit of warming to, it's become one of my favorites.

Bready malt along with wafts of must, green apple, and lightly acidic lime citrus dominate the somewhat tame aroma, with subtle notes of peppery alcohol and trace phenol. Mild honeyish sweetness is perceived at first in flavor, then is followed by notes of underripe kiwi and white grape. Fruitiness fades mid palate revealing a pleasantly dry, bready, lightly cracker like malt foundation, which is in turn supplemented by understated herbal clove. Hints of black licorice and candied green apple emerge late, along with mild, nearly forgotten hop bitterness. Well attenuated and acceptably smooth in mouthfeel, but a hair thin. Finishes clean, with mild, agreeable limeish acidity and hints of sweet bread. A surprisingly tame, but balanced strong golden by Unibroue. Highly reminescent of a Belgian ""single"" in overall character, except with a dangerously hidden alcohol content. Highly quaffable. A bit too neutral in yeast derived character, but quite tasty, nonetheless.","marc77","May 30, 2003"

Huge sweetness hits the tongue right away before giving way to some nice orange fruitiness with a trailing pepper taste. Slightly herbal hops can be quietly detected in the back of the brew as it progresses towards its spicy, slightly alcoholic, finish than lingers nicely on the tongue, leaving a craving for more.
