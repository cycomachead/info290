"This has got to be the first beer from tallgrass that I genuinely don't enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Probably not a great Triple but I like it. Easy drinking and pleasant....nothing offensive at all. Like the Brewery description says...I'd like to do it next time from a Champagne flute."

"An Americanized Tripel, to be sure; I recommend drinking this fresh. It seems that age has not done it any favors. I certainly wouldn't reach for this over a Belgian tripel, or even over Allagash's version, but it's not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a little hoppy, but in general a very satisfying tripel."

"O: Very drinkable and enjoyable brew. Maybe not a classic Belgian trippel, but a very good American version. Will have to grab a few more of these next time I'm through the midwest."

"Light golden hued with great clarity. A quarter inch of off white foam rests on top and there is light Brussels lacing. I smell faint light malt and Belgian candy sugar. There's a sweetness of light malt and Belgian candy sugar in the flavor. The mouth is moderately carbonated and dry. The sweetness in the flavor is slightly cloying."

"I have to give this one a few points for can graphics."

"On-tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI pours a mostly clear amber color with a fluffy beige head. The aroma is mild with yeasty banana. The taste is light and smooth, no big bold yeast and carbonation here. Smooth and delicious like everything from Tall Grass."
""
""
""
"O: Great base materials are somewhat hidden by missteps, but it is still appreciable as a great Belgian-style tripel from Kansas, of all places. Highly refreshing, original, and wonderfully hides the high ABV. The prominent yeastiness is good in the nose but murks the palate somewhat, but not enough to dissuade me from buying a tall fourpack of this handsome rooster again."

"As for the beer part of this review, it definitely does fill the description you see on their website, it's champagne-like, and you can taste a little bit of alcohol in this one, but not overpowering. Has some Saison features, which I personally like, but not everyone else may feel the same, almost as if this is a part french beer, instead of just Belgian Tripel. Some citrus, sweet candy notes, along with the overall champagne, quite unique... not amazing, but very good! This beer's alcohol content makes you feel really good and relaxed, unlike a Maiboch which gives you a headache."

"O: Decent beer, the bitterness takes over after a few sips and the roasted flavors and sugars disappear rather quickly leaving you with a bitter taste that lingers for a long time. Probably would pair well with a sweet chicken dish like a marsala, something to offset the bitter that just hangs. Most IPA's have a bitter that lingers but there are discernable characteristics of the lingering bitter this just...well...is. Not a session beer due to 8.5%ABV, a few of these and you're right as rain."
""
"This is a very good tripel. The floral finish sets it apart in the style."
""
"O - Overall, this was just an okay tripel, at best. Appearance and mouthfeel were pretty solid. The amount of biscuit here though just kills this."
""
"O- A good interpretation of a Tripel. Slightly off beat and pushing the envelop."

"Velvet Rooster is a solid beer, maybe not a solid or great Tripel by the Belgian standard, but I would have it again. This is probably my least favorite Tallgrass offering so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The aroma of this beer is deceiving as it tricks you into thinking great things lie ahead. In the end, it's just your standard Tripel."

"16oz can, pours hazy-golden with a bubbly, white head, good retention and lace. Aromas are yeast, fruit, banana, spice, biscuit. Tastes are bready, spicy yeast, biscuit, banana, orange, grass, and more boozy as it warms. Medium-fullish body with a dry, but fairly clean finish. Overall, not a bad tripel, but without a wow factor it doesn't stand up to the top-notch Belgian brewed tripels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the style, love this take on it and really love that I am enjoying a quality Tripel, in a can, brewed in Kansas! I'd have this one in my regular rotation if I could get it locally or if I lived in Kansas...."
""
"O: Not bad. Def. not my favorite beer. I would only buy this if someone else I know liked it. It is a once in a while beer for me. For a Belgian Triple Style, I have very high expectations, this just doesn't meet what I have come to expect, however... pretty good for American interpretation."

"O - Velvet Rooster is a fine Belgian style tripel that showcases what yeast can really add to a beer; spice, sweetness, and earthy hops all blend well with a kiss of alcohol on the finish for a delectable brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-A great tripel. And it comes in a can. It's a simple brew, but sometimes simple is just what you need."

"the feel is clean and refreshing. just as the name says, it is velvety smooth, but with a kick. smell some florals, but the taste is what really got me. light fruits that give it a nice candied sweetness, delicious belgian yeast, and some warm spice. this was delicious and will soon become a 4 pack purchase."
""
"This is a pretty nice American example of the style. I enjoyed the fruity and floral notes accompanying the nose and flavor as well as the fresh finish."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I wasn't sure what to expect from an American craft brewery taking on such a highly acclaimed Belgian style, but I'm definitely impressed. Usually Tripels have a yeasty flavor that ruins part of the experience for me, but Velvet Rooster's clean taste is exactly what I've been looking for in this style. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""

"Special thanks to BulbMan for sending this one over! This beer poured out as hazy golden yellow color with a white head on top. The retention and lacing were pretty good on this one. The smell of the beer is sweet, with some bready wheat and spice on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet with some soft fruity notes as hints of spice and more bread. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall it's a really nice beer. Not the best Tripel out there but still worth trying."
""
"This is an overall satisfying beer-that says a lot."
""
""
"D: a pretty solid sessionable tripel from an American brewery. wouldn't hate it if more American breweries could make tripel's like this one. tasty."
""
""
""
"O: As good a tripel as I've ever tried from a can (ok, so this is my first...) and a worthy example. If Tallgrass cans were available in our area, I'd seek these out; as such I'll look again next time I'm in the Midwest."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is perfect , out of a can even. Can't wait to try this on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice aroma profile but never really jumping out of my glass. Flavor was quite complex like a good tripel. Could have used a bit more carbonation and stayed a little lighter on my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The sweetness and over ripe fruits of this one make it a little too much for me."
"The aroma is overly polite, seeming to hold back certain depths of fruit and grass and fresh-baked dinner roll. The flavor in the mouth is plenty up-front showing the way to a wonderland of hop brightness tempered by sweet malt and expanded by a diaphanous barnyard funk."
""
"O: This beer definitely tastes strong but the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. It’s not a bad tripel considering it came from a can."
""
""
"Overall, a tasty tripel, and a sneaky amount of alcohol that can get you. But a really tasty beer here."
"O: Certainly I have not had a lot of Belgian styled tripels from a can before (if ever) but this is a pretty solid offering. If Tallgrass was available where I lived, I could see this being a great tailgating beer during football season. Easy to drink, enjoyable, and the fairly high ABV is extremely well hidden."
""
"Drinkability: Tommy likey. Tommy want (rooster) wingy. This is the best Tallgrass offering I have had so far (and probably the de facto best beer I have had from Kansas)."
""
""
""
"It’s been a while since I’ve had a tripel (because I’m not a big fan of them), and I’m glad I took a chance on Tallgrass’. I’m impressed with Velvet Rooster and will be seeking it out again."
"Overall I don't mind this, I am sort of really just above borderline. IT's very unique and interesting, but it's also missing lots of things I like in this style particularly a sense of richness and sweetness (but not too sweet). I could have this again, but don't desire to."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice surprise coming from a can. Trippel meets farmhouse ale. Even smoother as it warms. Cock a doddle doo! Would drink more."
"Not great, but not my favorite."
""
"SR"
"Enjoyable, and available without a bottle opener, everything you want for a summer afternoon golf game."
""
"Thanks to TheBishopco for this one!"
""
""
"Overall: A solid American take on a Tripel. Could of been stronger in the spices but it avoids the overly sweet flavor that some American Belgian style beers have."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M - The ale lives up to its name (the velvet part, not the rooster... thankfully). Tingly carbonation, but I could do with a little bit more. Also, not as dry as some tripels I have had which makes this one a bit more syrupy than I prefer for a belgian ale."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Initially the alcohol is well masked behind the residual sweetness but as the brew comes up to temperature, the candy quality becomes almost cloying and the alcohol evolves and starts to clash. I am appreciative of the chance to try this brew but honestly dont think I would go out of my way to try it again."
"This can is another masterpiece in the world of graphic design by the Tallgrass brewery. Poured into NB globe glass. Appearance is a hazy yellow with generous mounds of white head. Tons of lacing left behind. The nose is full of ripe bananas, spicy cloves, and notes of bready yeast. The nose is right on for the style. The taste features waves of lemon zest, banana, clove, and bread. Lots of Belgo flavors workin' in this brew. The body is medium with high carbonation. Overall, this beer provides a great value for a flavorful and authentic tasting tripel. Definitely worth a try if not for anything more than having these artistic cans around for display."

"More grain and sweet bread come out in the flavor...almost like a pound cake slathered with peanut butter. Hops do a good job of adding some bite on the back end, along with a rather unique alcohol presence. Body is right at medium and the carbonation is so fine it is easy to overlook. Little bit of earthy grain as it warms, almost like some maris otter malt is used. Pretty good for an American brewed tripel and I will surely purchase a four-pack next time I find myself heading to Arrowhead to soak in a Chiefs game. Would be a dangerous tailgate companion, this psychedelic rooster."
"O: Not bad. Falls a little short on the nose and the finish is not too pleasant. Drinkability suffers because of the latter."
""
"Mouthfeel: Was not anything special."
""
""
""
"Poured a pale copper color with a small white head that receded to a wispy layer of bubbles. Aroma of bready yeast, grass, grape and apple skins. Flavor was a bit stale, but not to the point where I could call this a bad beer; toasted bread, yeast, grass and wood, more green apple skin. Very earthy in the finish. Light-medium body, pretty drying, higher alcohol not very noticeable. Overall a decent quaff, though nothing unique or amazing going on."
"Overall, I find it pretty good. But the taste is lacking complexity and nuance. It's pretty bland, and dominated by vegetabley lightly-bitter hops. Fantastic yeast in the smell, but nowhere to be found in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"the sweetness of this one makes it perfect every season. a heavy beer with a lighter mouthfeel, very tasty and great looking!"
"Well cockadoodledoo, this rooster has soul. I can dig it..."
""
"I like that Tallgrass is putting out a great new beer that is unique and is in a can. Long live the can! Solid taste, good looking pour, I will keep this one around."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into minimal lacing for the style. The aroma is of mandarin oranges, passion fruit, and leather. The taste is similar to the aroma. It has of interesting aspects, but still seems to lack the kind of complexity I look for in a tripel. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer, but with so many better examples of the style easily available I can't see myself purchasing this beer again."
"O: Tallgrass has a very solid tripel in their roster with Velvet Rooster. While it isn't exactly a standout, this beer will hold it's own in the category, especially for an American brewery."
"O: Overall this was a great canned beer, However for the style it really misses the mark. Doesn't come across as a true triple. A tasty brew none the less. Glad I gave this a try."
"Beer is medium to light in body, hides the alcohol insanely well, nice body and flavor. Mildly bready, sweet, decent finish, not too dry, not wonderful but a very decent tripel. I might have it again."
""
""
"This is one nice looking triple. It rivals the look of some belgians i've seen. Straw gold/orange appearance. A nice full white pillowy head that retains and sticks. Smell is of faint ripe fruit, apple, pear, faint grape, bubblegum. Taste i get candi sugar, apple, pear, bubblegum and nice Belgian yeast. Feel is great, lively with active carbonation. Goes down smooth. One of the better American Belgian triples I've had recently because it's not blogged down with to many hops. Great beer."
""
"Well made and nicely balanced, this Tripel is a little ordinary. Lots of citrus (orange up front with grapefruit in the back), a subtle Belgian breadiness, hints of biscuit, and faint cloves, there isn't a strong unique character or unique flavor profile to the brew. It is a very drinkable beer without being offensive or extraordinary."
"Though not category for which points are awarded, ""Velvet Rooster"" is one of the most creative beer titles I have seen. Props to Tallgrass for the originality."
"O: I don't think this beer is very good. In all honestly... it reminds me more of an adjunct lager than an Belgian triple. I was looking forward to opening this can, and was let down quite a bit. I suppose it has all the right flavors, but the balance of those flavors is way off from where it should be."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes... okay, but not much like a tripel. Bit of traditional overripe fruit up front, along with nodes of mint. This moves into a spiciness that tastes somehow ersatz, and followed up by a strange graininess that would be more at home in an all malt lager. Things come together in the aftertaste, which is smooth and caramely, but the back end just does not resemble a tripel at all."
"Blonde with bleached highlights when backlit and a creamy ivory head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Sweet with fresh grainy notes in the nose. Big and flavorful, tastes like a brewery.. wet grain and raw fresh hops with a bit of Belgian yeastiness and a powerful spice kick (coriander of course) and white pepper. Dry and yeasty in the finish with an American hoppy finish. Full bodied and smoothly carbonated, finishes mostly dry. A tasty brew from Tallgrass."
""
""
"D - This was actually pretty good. There's more sweetness and less Belgian yeast character than I'd prefer from this style, but it's definitely in my top 5 canned Belgian-style beers, particularly those from Kansas."
""
""
"A Tripel in a can! Big time! This is not a perfect Tripel by any means but it's very interesting and...it's in a can. Lots of floral and herbal flavors going on. It's pretty sweet but the herbs and black pepper help even it out. Give it a go!"
"Hazed gold with an orange glow at the edge of the glass. Dense white head of foam. Grain husk, medicinal phenolics, sublte banana and cherry. Alcohol definitely speaks up at the end of each sip. A bit too sweet, but certainly not cloying. This one needs a bit more yeast character and more dryness. But why the hell am I complaining?! A canned Belgian-style Tripel brewed in Kansas...god damned the American craft beer scene is awesome. And oh yeah, the can is pretty damn awesome too."
""
"O: A pretty average tripel. The DMS presence in the aroma and flavor really hold it back."
""
"O: Like I said, not their best work or the best of the tripels, but it had a good cloak for the abv and didnt put you off in its thickness."
"The body is pretty slick for a Tripel. The trademark Belgian effervescence is nowhere to be found. In its place is an amount of carbonation that simultaneously livens up the beer and lets you forget about it real quick. Overall, this is a pretty average beer. Below average for the style. It'd maybe be worth trying one of these. Tallgrass is a brewery that I like, but this is perhaps their poorest wide-release beer."
""
""
"O - this is my favorite offering to date from Tall Grass"
"The mouthfeel is good - creamy, appropriate carbonation. Not a bad trippel, not a great one either. A good beer, but just OK for its style."
""
"O: This is a really nice Trippel--so creamy, yeasty, bready, slightly funky, mmmm"
""
""
"very dry and nice carbonation a great beer no sense of alcohol easy to love hard to hate"
""
"Wow! Second taste of Tallgrass' offerings and already I'm wondering what else I'm missing. Picked up a fresh four pack of tallboy cans from Midtown Liquors in Tulsa, OK: what a great shop!"
""
"Pours out a deeper orange-tinted golden hue with a medium amount of clouded haze with a nice fluffy cap of bubble-bath foam on top that doesn't leave much lacing but looks pretty for the short time that it lasts. Texture is sort of thick and slightly under-carbonated for my taste in the style. Smells like an overripe mushy pear that has been dipped in cereal grains and than sprinkled thoroughly with green cardamom. Gains an unwanted slight metallic tinge when allowed to warm up all the way to room temperature. Has all the fruity ester-fied (grapes, pears, plums) flavor of a Belgian-styled ale that you would expect, as well as a nice dose of spiced cloves on top...and the ABV is hard to detect. If only it didn't gain that weird metallic tinge when it warmed up and had a better texture, I would have been a real fan of this one."
"Overall a good Tripel that leans heavily to the spicy side of the spectrum, not especially balanced or nuanced in taste. The addition of a little sweetness and fruit would go a long way here."
""
""
"Try it. It's not my favorite style, but it's drinkable."
""
"Overall it's not a bad beer - it's just not what I think of as a ""tripel""."
"The Crack & Glug proved that I am slightly out of touch as I got some overflow as the big, thick, eggnog-colored head roared up from the bottom of the glass and over the rim of my glass. Its retention was actually becoming a problem as it seemed to refuse to drop, hindering me from pouring what still remained in the CAN. Color was a slightly-hazy deep golden-yellow. Nose had a papery mustiness, undoubtedly yeast-driven, like newspapers out of the attic or basement. Wow! I was really anxious for the first sip once the head got under control. Mouthfeel was quite full, very viscous as I rolled it around on my tongue, taking in the melding of flavors that included tropical fruit (think mango, banana, coconut) and cracked black pepper as well as an underlying mustiness. To say that the finish was dry would be to mark me as uttering the understatement of the year. The zephyr winds of the Sahara Desert blew through the back of my throat on the finish. Dry? Arid! Zounds. The spiciness just lingered in my mouth and I marveled that this had come out of a CAN. A KANsas CAN, no less. I would absolutely have some of this in the cooler on Hula in the Coola Day (01 February, annually) but it might be a bit much for the beach."
"A nicely done trippel that stands up the the Belgian offerings...not saying it is as good but stands up to the style well..."
"I love the design on the can, very artsy"
"O- A decent beer. Expected a little more based on the reviews, but i wouldn't put this in my 10 favorite Tripels. A fairly approachable, drinkable selection for someone who isn't into Trappist beers, but the yeasty, fruity, grainy flavor is subdued and the body is a little awkward. Just ok..."
"Overall: Despite some minor issues with the hoppy, yet not dry, finish, this is a strong US-made Tripel, especially at the price point. And it comes in a Pint can!"
"A delicious Tripel by the folks at Tallgrass – and in a can for those who want a taste of Belgium-on-the-go."
""
""
"Picked up a 4 pack of this new canned tripel. I used to be big into tripels, and tried this one beside Sprecher's tripel. Tallgrass won that competition but isn't really outstanding compared to other trips I've had. But it's a nicely rounded and flavorful beer."
""
""
"Woodychandler continues to amaze me with his variety of canned beers. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a deep golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruits and yeast. Taste is also big on yeast, some fruits and spices. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."
""
"Like It? Very Much So"
"O - This is a very good tripel. Tallgrass keeps doing amazing beers!"
"On tap at the Pig & Fiddle in Edina. Had this next to a friend that was enjoying the St. Feuillien Tripel. This is an admirable take on the style, but can't quite stand up to the Belgian counterpart. The aroma is a little too messy and spicy, like a farmhouse ale. There's a light, crisp lemon note, but this beer is on the earthy side. The body is appropriately crisp, but the yeast character sends this into the realm of saisons."
""
"A tripel in a can is nice. Still have to deliver in the flavor department and it fell just a little short compared to the Belgian greats."
""
""
""
"Very solid brew from Tallgrass brewery, almost like a sibling of our excellent Surly Brewery up here in Minnesota."
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer and earned a spot in my regular rotation. I found my self grabbing the second can before the first was gone and if discretion hadn't prevailed, a third would have been welcomed as well. Absolutely delicious- don't think twice about grabbing a four-pack. If this were sold in c&c'd 750's I'm sure I'd be buying this beer regularly at 10 bucks a bottle. As it is, it's an awesome bargain and one I won't be passing up often."
"O- a great tripel in a can or really just a great tripel.easily could have a couple pints..this one will be in my fridge on the rotaation"
"Taste: Clean, supple, and smooth on the palate and down the throat. Fine and fruity, with light spice, tickly and prickly. Some soft-shoe on the tongue, a little buck and wing, and it's all deliciousness down the hatch after that. Creamy, and smooth, and, as we so often say, dangerously drinkable. Proceed with caution. Too tasty to stop at one, too fierce to go beyond two."
"Pillowy white head sits atop a regal gold body of nectoar. Lacing is very full. Aroma is bready and lemony. A little spice and hay. Flavor is a little sourdough, some lemongrass, cakey yeastiness, pepper.... Really nice. I expect nothing less from this fine brewery. Highly drinkable and flavorful. Light medium body with a soft feel to it and alcohol presence is barely detectable. A winner."
"There is some hype surrounding this beer. Not sure if it's because it's the first canned Tripel, but I think this beer is worthy of some hype because of the product inside. I find this one very enjoyable with a pretty high drinkability. Definitely worth checking out."
"Overall: I really like this beer. It sort of feels like a working man's tripel. It is nice and sweet and has the flavors of a belgian-brewed tripel without the pricetag or the sometimes annoyingly high carbonation. I bet the absence of can-conditioning helps with the creamy mouthfeel of this beer compared to the prickly mouthfeel of other belgian style tripels."
"Overall - absolutely incredible! I had no idea what to expect when I heard Tallgrass was canning a Belgian-style Tripel. This was a pretty big departure from their other offerings. I am very happy to say that they nailed it with this one. Velvet Rooster can strut proudly in a Belgian henhouse full of native varieties of this particular breed."
