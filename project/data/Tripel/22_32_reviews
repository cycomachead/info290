"Another exceptional tripel by unibrowe."
""
""
"This may be my favorite trippel.  It was a very strong piercing beer with a lot of flavor and sweetness as well.  The smell of fruit and hops filled the glass as I poured it and the champagne like bubbles were overwhelmingly graceful!  The aromas were fantastic!  Then after a quick settle the taste of this was just perfect!  It was sweet and warming, and the unfiltered goodness fills your mouth with malty flavors.  I highly suggest trying the ""holy water"" and giving Canada a thumbs up for one GREAT beer!"

"01/16/13 On tap a Rattle n Hum, NYC. Yes, yes, yes. If it wasn't for the 7.7 ABV I'd be all over this stuff. Seductive in a Rubenesque way. Lots of body. As a huge Fin du Monde fan, she needs to watch her Ps & Qs as I could swing this way with no regret."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Quite drinkable, but at this drier end of the Belgian spectrum it gets a little sourish and funky in the aftertaste. From the bottle-capped 750 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquor in Denver. Discounted to six bucks."
""
""
""
""
"Well, I hate to say it, but I’ve finally found a loser from Unibroue, at least to my tastes. Very watery and flavorless, although the 7.7% ABV is well hidden and has potential to sneak up and slam you. This gets a decent rating because it meets the definition of a tripel but I found it pretty flavorless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Typical tripel-esque appearance, slightly hazy golden-orange, with a good inch or so of frothy off-white head that sank to a thin layer, lacing the glass well. Powerful aroma full of fruity esters, medicinal phenols, spice. In the taste, overripe banana and peach, stale malts, harsh phenols, almost like a vodka spike, pepper and clove. Medium body, sticky, too much fusel/solventy booze for a ""lower"" ABV brew. I'm not a big fan of tripels to begin with, but I really couldn't get into this one at all, and as far as the style goes, I've had much better."
""
"Soft and fluffy but sweet, there's a light dryness that balances out the feel and there's lots of smoothness to this while a brisk crispness never falls back."
""
""
"Citrus esters are a nice break from the bready malt backbone. The clove becomes a bit overwhelming."
""
""

"Picked this up as a Christmas two pack in February because they were trying to clear them out. For the price I had to give it a run. Not a great looking beer, light without much of a head. Excellent smell although not real strong. Taste is similar, very good to excellent but not as much, shall I say bang as I would like, but very smooth. Extremely drinkable for the ABV which gives it bonus points overall and decent value, at least at the price I paid. Overall a strong beer that I would certainly buy again at a good price."
""
""

"Golden yellow color with a small white head. Has a subtle yeasty aroma. Flavor is also very subtle. Has hints of yeast and a touch of sweetness. Doesn’t quite stand out against other top tripels, such as Unibroue’s own La Fin Du Monde, but is still decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this beer. I liked it better than it's counter part in the 2-pack Maudite. Would for sure consider buying this combo again (especially for the price) and almost entirely for this beer. I would love to do this one and La Fin back to back, they are both so different (even being the same style) and both excellent."
""
"Overall - A nice easy to enjoy and full flavor triple with lower alcohol and spices. Very smooth with a nice mix of bitter and sweetness. A nice alternative to la fin du monde, id call this the little sister of that brew. Glad I got to try and if I seen in single bottle id certainly buy again."
""
""
""
""

"Minimal carbonation came in a gift pack with Maudite, Deep golden hazed hue with a fine thin layered white head, speckled texture lines the sides of the glass. Aroma mildly spicy hints of chamomile or lavender something herbal and definite coriander, herbal grassy hops are minimal mainly the yeast spiciness that Belgian style ales are known to offer. Hints of pineapple, spicy coriander mild citrus tones, the rest of the palate is a relatively clean grassiness to finish. Overall a lighter version of a tripel, less alcohol does increase drinkability and there's really no booze left to burn the palate or nares in this one, sometimes I feel La Fin du Monde get's a bit alcohol fueled. Mouthfeel light carbonation compared to most of the Unirbroue ales, medium bodied the yeast spiciness lingers between sips but I find it enjoyable overall not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it, it's been one of the those beers I always wanted to grab but either there were better options when I did find it or it wasn't available at all."

"I could not pass up yet another tripel from Unibroue. Cork topped 750 served in Chimay chalice. Beer pours super pale golden, slightly cloudy, with a nice white head. Sweet aroma, reminiscent of cider -- I really like it. Reminds me of CBC tripel threat, which is awesome. Flavor registers quite a bit lower on the sweetness. Grassy and herbal, with a relatively thin and fizzy mouthfeel, and a hint of sugar in the aftertaste, but still pretty dry. Fantastic balance, actually. I don't think it has the depth of flavor of La Fin Du Monde, but it has every bit as much drinkability and more. Quite a delicious treat."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is ok, the alcohol is well hidden, save for a little spiciness on the back-end. The esters are really strong, and with the malt give it a slightly dirty vibe. Not their best effort, but a solid trippel. I'm getting a little tired off the Bananas Foster taste of many Belgium blondes, so there's perhaps a negative bias."

"OVERALL: The elusive Eau Benite, it was well worth the wait, I will tell you that. Stands as a testament of the fine brewing activity going down at Unibroue brewery in Canada. This is a tasty Tripel that hits all the right notes, and then some."
"Notes: Notable among trippels for its tropical fruit note and crispness."
""
"Feel is coarse and grainy. Touch of citric sweetness on the finish does mask the ABV well. Nose gets somewhat intriguing through the foam with warming yet this is hardly a Tripel in the classic sense."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is somewhat fizzy at first, but quickly quiets to a foamy and smooth flow across the palate. Closes semi-dry, with slight ethanol warmth in the nostrils and back of the throat."

"D- a modestly boozed tripel from Canada. I've had like 12 of their beers and these guys are no joke. They amaze me every single time with the best Belgian beer that's not made in Belgium (or Netherlands). This really is some holy water.. If tropical fruit has been steeping in it. Darn it where is my cheese!? This is a beer for double creme or idk something soft ripened or chevre. Killer broue."
"O - Although similar to its bigger cousin, the famous La Fin du Monde, this beer came to my liking more, because it is less yeasty and carbonated while being more fruity and drinkable, thanks to the relatively low ABV (for a tripel). It is unfortunate that this is so hard to find, because it could easily become my go-to tripel. A great beer to be sought."

""

"Its a tad sweet but otherwise so pleasant and refreshing. Overall...its another amazing brew by unibroue. It just amazes me how good they are at such a low price and so widely available. This is a very under hyped triple imo. Go have one now."
""
"O: Wow - for never having seen this beer before, what a find. It is much more fruity and sweet than La Fin Du Monde, but the sweetness is subdued and complex. Where I would say La Fin Du Monde is a celebration of pure maltiness, Eau Benite is a superb expression of yeast esters on a somewhat sweeter malt note. It is comparable to Weyerbacher Merry Monks, but a lot lighter and subtle, and thus a lot more drinkable. I will be looking out for more of this tripel in the future."
""
"3.5 D: Decent beer, but it doesn't hold a candle to LFDM, so I doubt I'll ever buy this again, even if I'm in the mood for some Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
"o-Good, unique tripel. I prefer their La Fin du Monde, but would not be opposed to having this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Super drinkable tripel. One of the smoothest mouthfeels of any tripel I've had. Can't give it huge scores due to the relatively simple nature of the beer but it goes down so easy and is delicious to boot. To be frank, this is better than La Fin Du Monde."
"-Overall 4.5: Excellent beer and one of the best triples I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Light, airy, but at the same time it presents an amazing depth of taste and smell. The label has a lot of fun with angelic imagery, but this is one angelic and miraculous brew. Highly recommended."
""
"O- very good example of the style. That's all I can really say until I improve my palate."
"O: A very solid, enjoyable Tripel. It's basically a Pilsner if it was brewed with Belgian yeast; tons of malt flavor but still very complex. It isn't mind blowing, but it's worth the price and I will be picking this up again in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall: Though it's been a few years since I last had La Fin du Monde, I didn't find it to be appreciably different minus a few ticks on the alcohol scale, which is fine by me, really."
""
""
""
"Drink- It was tasty but not up to par with La Fin Du Monde."
""
""
""
""
"The lack of carbonation hurts the body and flavor of this beer. Mostly yeast driven with a nice hop balance."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden yellow with good head and minor lace. Aroma is one of that typical yeasty, orange-like Belgian strain, as well as some sweetness from candi sugar(?) (which is typical description, mind you), and something like tropical or just plush fruit esters. The mouthfeel is more of the same, light spices poke your tongue as the body is light and somewhat creamy so it passes over the tongue real easy and the lower-than-usual ABV doesn't punish you at all. Beer tastes great as it is a not an exceptional triple, but is well-crafted and a great beer to have (not to sound redundant). The balance between not only the spices but malts and fruit is great, as I get a light-fruity beer with something like tropical fruit (magno, pineapple) and other fruits like apple, pear, orange, banana (the last two are lightly noticed), along with some sweet malt tastes. A great triple that I enjoyed sipping on and is a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Golden body, slighly hazy, big fluffy white head with soapy lacing. Aroma is wispy banana, clove and that strong, strong pleasant prominent Unibroue tripel yeast. Awesome. Taste is slightly spicy, banana, slight candi sugar and again the yeast dominates. Amazingly drinkable and just delicious all around."
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol and fruit palate sensations keep the beer balanced toward the sweetness. I would prefer a sturdier hop character to reel in the earthy, complex, and genuine taste of Belgium."
"Had this on tap... the appearance was not the most pleasing shade of murky yellow, but this is just a small deduction. The head was average, with lots of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful with hints of pineapple and very sweet candy. Taste - I found generally to be quite similar to La Fin Du Monde, only turned up a notch in the sweetness department. It's of course got that signature 'Ale On Lees' Unibroue stamp, which I love. Not a bad thing at all. The breadiness, herb/spices, and crisp, yeast aspects balance out the sweetness well. The fact that it is so well-rounded is probably it's biggest strength. Does not feel heavy in body and has just the right amount of alcohol warming. Not quite as complex as your 'Belgian' Belgians, but don't hesitate to order this or pick it up if it's at your local beer store..."
"Beer is light and airy with a nice mild breadiness and a dry finish. No real bitterness, just a nice little tripel. I'd have it again, I really enjoyed it but I like La Fin Du Monde a bit more."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice,sweet, and fruity tripel that is really smooth. I would pick this one up again if I was looking for this style"
"Probably my least favorite Unibroue I've tried. It's not that it's poorly made, but that it just doesn't do a whole lot for me personally. I think it's well done and would make a good intro beer to belgian styles, but just doesn't do a whole lot else. I will enjoy the bottle, but no need to try it again really."
""
""
""
"O:  A great fruity tripel with excellent yeast and a low alcohol to make it smooth and easy drinking. This is no La Fin Du Monde but it's still another great tripel by Unibroue. "
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good tripel, but nothing too different than most of the tripels you find."
""

"Eau Benite pours a very hazy orange. About three fingers or so of white foam rises up to fill the glass, before slowly creeping down. Head retention is fairly minimal though. The nose is chock full of esters. Lots of pale fruit aromas swimming around, and balanced by just a little bit of clove. The flavor profile is similarly unbalanced. The fruity esters are superb, with waves of apple, peach, apricot, mango, and a little bit of pear all present and vying for attention. The only problem is that there's not much else to the beer at all. As in the nose, there's a little bit of a phenolic clove presence, but it's very much buried in the background. The body is just a hair too chewy for my taste, but it's a close thing. The carbonation, on the other hand, is flawless. It's very lively, lending the beer some levity and excitement. Eau Benite is a tasty beer, it's just not complex enough to hang with the best tripels. Then again, given that Unibroue also makes La Fin Du Monde, it was going to be hard for Eau Benite to live up to the inevitable comparisons."

"O - Solid beer, and the sweetness makes this a very good cocktail beer or cordial. Very easy to convert non-craft drinkers to try this."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 8/23/2013. Pours hazy golden amber color with a fluffy 1-2 finger white head with good retention, tghat reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of pear, pepper, banana, clove, herbal, wheat, earth, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of pear, lemon, banana, pepper, clove, wheat, herbal, earth, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of pear, banana, clove, wheat, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance between fruit/spicy flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly crisp and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely amazing Tripel. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance; and extremely easy to drink. Kind of like a smaller La Fin Du Monde. Just outstanding."

"Unibroue's yeast and its rendering has always been very tasty to me, and it makes it hard to not like any of their core offerings - but this tripel could be more - i'll stick to La Fin - not a loss not having this widely available stateside"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good but not excellent tripel."
""
""
""
""
"O- The classic Tripel yeast profile is full and supported by the Unibroue house yeast character very nicely. It is slightly dry but not overly dry with a good sweet perception to keep it easy drinkable."
"Overall this feels like a flattened subdued cola more than anything. Kind of disappointing since I really like La Fin Du Monde..."
""
""
""
"Overall a good cross btween a tripel & a Belgian pale."
"Overall: Nice ""light"" version of a tripel, the 7.7% ABV is very drinkable. Another very good beer from a very good brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a great beer to drink. The flavors all went well together. I could drink a few of these, wspwcially on a warm summer day."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a goblet, best buy 8-23-13. This pours a hazy golden yellowish color with a decent foamy bubbly white head which quickly fizzes away. The smells are of Belgian yeast esters, fruits, spices, malts. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, a little fruit, some malts, a little dryness on the way down along with a tad hop bite."
"O: Overall is a complex beer, which balances the yeasty and sweet tastes with good levels of carbonation and a smooth finish. Very drinkable."
""
""
"For a ""light"" tripel this is pretty good."
"Overall: this is a pretty good beer, but it doesn't hit the notes I want in a tripel. It's much more of an imperial wheat or lightly-spiced witbier in character."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly cloudy orange yellow amber, massive fine head and lacing. Active carbonation. Looks nice. Aroma of wheat, citrus fruit, bananas and Belgian spicing. Lots of complex, sweet, light fruit flavors, wheat and Belgian spicing. Taste tapers off very quickly leaving a bit of light fruit, clove, butterscotch and light hops aftertaste. Medium bodied and spicy from carbonation and clove. Interesting and different. Flavor is somewhat subdued, but pleasant and refreshing. This is what I'd expect a mixture of a hefeweizen and Belgian tripel would taste like. Quite different from Fin du Monde and one I will return to in the future."
""
"86."
""
""
"Overall - Another job well done by Unibroue. I quite enjoy the fluffy mouthfeel and floral flavours. Definitely worth picking up the winter mix pack that includes this brew."
"Picked this up in a two pack of bombers from Unibroue. Pours a nice light orange color with a huge head. It doesn't leave much lacing down the sides. The aroma is very sweet and has some floral characteristics to it. The taste starts light and with some bitterness but rounds out to a nice fruity flavor and some heat from the alcohol. This is a great beer and as a bottle conditioned limited release, something i would pick up again if I ever saw it."
""
"Thanks again DaftCaskBC for another nice one!"
"I really enjoyed this one, wish I could pick up six packs or 750mls of just Eau Benite. Maybe most comparable to Don de Dieu but both more drinkable and refreshing (though not as tasty or complex overall). I would love to have this in the fridge all through the summer. Looks like I might be forced to buy a bunch of Trois Pistoles, Maudite and Blonde de Chambly as well (tagging along in the mixed 12 pack)..."
"O: La Fin Du Monde's little brother. Eau Benite is just a little more mellow with wheatier characteristics and more subdued spicing. Nice notes of pear, apple and banana."
""
"jd"
"Conclusion: I am blown away by this beer. I was expecting to moderately enjoy it, but it is actually the best Tripel I have ever had. My new gold standard for this style."
"O - Yes it is a very good example of the style."
"O: A little more malty than La Fin Du Monde, this Tripel by Unibroue is also extremely drinkable and delicious."
""
""
""
"O- This isnt a bad beer. With that said not really up to the quality I normally associate with Unibroue. Not a total loss as I am looking forward to the Maudite."
"Mouthfeel is light and lively. Overall, quite a nice beer."
""
"I have a little issue with the mouthfeel as it starts out with a nicely carbonated medium body, but it seems to thin out as it moves through your mouth, becoming vaporous, like a sake. Very odd and distracting. But the flavors are the star here and make this a worthwhile endeavor. In experience it sits somewhere between Orval and Duvel."
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer, it's delicious. My biggest gripe with it is that it's only available in gift sets. Seek it out for sure."
"D - Probably my favorite tripel so far, and I really enjoyed this one. Nice drinkable flavor with a funky fruit kick and reasonable ABV. I would definitely have this one again without having to think twice."
"This is a very solid, well crafted beer, and I'm pretty sure that were I to try it blind, I would think for all the world that this beer came from Belgium. Nothing is out preportion in this beer, and this is certainly something I could see myself ordering again."
"O: I wish it were better. It's passable, but the intense smooth malts destroy that tartness I love to get from the fruits of a tripel. Give it a try, but don't expect to ascend to heaven."
""
"O- Overall, a nice, smooth tripel. Not the best example of the style, but still a solid beer, especially for the price. Another nice, pleasant drinker from Unibroue."
"Opinion: This is an alright beer. I really don't care for how the yeast stands out like it does. It almost seems like it wasn't finished fermenting, but the attenuation says otherwise. Perhaps this one is just to ""small"" of a beer for their house yeast or something? I mean, this is a good beer from just about any other brewery, but Unibroue makes some exceptional beers and this one is not quite up to that standard because it isn't very clean in the finish. I would prefer to stick to their La Fin Du Monde or something than revisit this one again."

"Hazy, pale orange color with a very nice head on top. Decent head seems to want to remain. Yeasty and spicy aroma, mildly phenolic. earthy as well. Very crisp and citrusy flavor wise. Peppery spice to it. Mild grapefruit. Very sharp and effervescent mouthfeel-quite lively. Mild sticky sweetness in the finish. Nice enjoyable tripel all in."
"Eau Benite pours a light orange color with a near perfect two finger off white head. Good lacing and carbonation on this beer. The appearance is very murky/hazy and impossible to see through despite it's relative light color. The nose is pleasant, and on the lighter side for the style. I get lemon peel, clove, malt, and pepper- as well as some light fruit. Maybe a little orange in there as well. The taste follows the nose profile. The pepper and spices come out slightly more than in the nose. The taste is also bigger and a little bolder than the nose. Not quite as complex/smooth as the best tripels, but still solid. Feel is medium w/ a nice citrus/hop bite on the back end. Good carbonation on the feel as well, with a fairly dry finish. Overall, this is a good solid tripel- I'd have this again. This is one of the better beers I've had from Unibroue. I enjoyed it quite a bit more than La Fin du Monde... Cheers."

"Overall ok beer. I think I was expecting something a little more exciting."

"From the caged, corked 750 ml. bottle stamped 08-23-13. Sampled on December 10, 2011. It pours a golden amber with a full, fluffy head that simmers down as well as a nice carbonation stream heading up the center of the glass. The aroma is alive with sensations including yeast, clove, corn, Belgian sugars, and a tiny hop hit. The body is of medium texture. It is an exquisite Tripel with its bittersweet taste and spicy afterglow that also tingles the tongue with a sour, hoppy finale. I would probably buy this more often if it was available by itself instead of part of a gift pack."
"D: I found this to be an extremely pleasing experience, and a very well crafted beer. It stands up against other offerings from Unibroue fabulously, and adds a strong contender to their line-up."
"This is... kind of a waterier Fin du Mond, but I guess I should've expected that? It's still darn good. Sort of a lighter-weight younger brother with a similar flavor profile."
"Every bit as good as La Fin Du Monde. Excellent. I wish I could buy this individually from the gift pack. Though I can't complain about having to buy Maudite as well :) Highly recommended."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of earthy, spicy and sweet flavors. Subtle dry, grassy presence up front countered by some zesty pepper and coriander. This is followed by a prominent estery yeast character that gives off hints of bread and sweet, light fruit. Hints of orange, tangerine and apple are followed by a nice alcohol presence but the ABV is well masked without much heat. Well balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness and subtle booze to counter the earthy/spicy notes. Very refreshing and deceptively drinkable."
""
""
"I was overly excited when I saw this in the new mixer pack and even being a pretty good brew it didn't live up to my high expectations. that being said the mixed pack has some of the best quality bang for your buck in the province"
"O - not a top notch tripel, but it is a tasty beer with that unexplainable but unmistakeable Unibroue character, worth a try"
"This stuff goes down easy, really easy. Light Tripel? Yeah I guess that descriptor fits, but it has just as much in common with Duvel. I wish I didn't have to buy this in a special combo pack, then again, if given the choice between this and La Fin du Monde I would stick with the La Fin du Monde."
"O- A very goor beer and different enough from the rest of the lineup to stay relevent. A refreshing Tripel."
"Nice to see something new (to me, anyway) from Unibroue down in these parts. This stuff pours a lightly hazy golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises Belgian yeast, light white bread, very light cardamom, clove, and banana peel. The taste holds notes of Belgian yeast, light flaky biscuit, coriander, cardamom, black pepper, clove, banana, and some tufts of grass or there. There's a surprising amount of breadiness in there, but it in no way detracts from the usual tripel-ness. Not bad. The body is a light medium, with a barely-light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a solid tripel, not quite as good as La Fin, but more than solid in and of itself."
"750ml bottle purchased at Fiddlehead Farms in Dover. Pours a hazy yellow body with a good two or three inches of persistent head. Spice, lemon, orange, with nut and vanilla notes comprise the aroma. Lemon, orange, coriander, anise, clove, pith, with hints of vanilla and nut make up the flavor. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Super-drinkable, which could be dangerous considering the ABV. In a word, awesome. Truly unique with really no flaws to speak of. Aptly named."
"O - This is a very nice tripel. Unibroue is so consistently good with all their Belgian-style ales."
"O: A decent beer, but one of the weakest ones out of Unibroue's main line-up. Unibroue being the great brewery they are, that means it's still better than most other North American tripels. It just doesn't reach the levels of complexity and crispness of La Fin Du Monde."
"O - A step above La Fin Du Monde. This beer is excellent."
"Overall – A very nice and smooth beer that will go down dangerously fast. It has a lot of the taste found in wit beers. The alcohol is very well hidden and the fruit flavours are refreshing. No regrets on this purchase."
"Overall, I find this a superb beverage: light and crisp, with wonderful spicy fruit flavors. Anyone not familiar with Unibroue would do well to start here, as the flavors in this ale lend themselves better to the average palate than some of the brewery's darker fares."
"pour is murky golden with a solid formed head of white. about a finger and a half. nose is complex esters from wheat, barley and belgian sugar. first time i've had a triple with notes of marzipan, honey comb, orangepeel and candied pineapple. nice smooth feel a bit a tingle more bright than a hef would be but still as easy to drink. has longevity as well. doesn't seem to lose much while sitting around."
"D- This may not be an incredibly high ABV beer, but it has a warming character that still leaves room for a quite fresh overall feel. Surely a pleasant drink"
"I can't get Unibroue beers very easily in the UK, but I'll certainly buy any I see!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the taste, which came through over a curiously dull nose. This is not to say that the nose was offensive, but rather that is was bright with ripe fruits and malty elements not otherwise common in a tripel. While you could certainly tell that this was brewed within the style, the outlying components, like the aroma inclusions and the hugely yeasty sediment, give this brew an interesting twist."
"Overall: It's held up well after 3 years, better than the 1837. Too bad it's discontinued."
"The color is fairly turbid, suggesting the presence of large wheat, which is strange for a triple. The nose is a little weak when it receives a light but fruity. Mouth also light with a low alcohol beverage, which allows to drink like whey. It collects a little spiciness, but it was his soft side, even grainy (as some wheat beers) emerges, with hints of exotic fruits, with the addition of a slight spicy bitterness. Very strange for a triple because both nearly as tasty and as bitter as the standards of the genre. With the advantage of being easy to drink."
"D - Pretty drinkable for 7.7%, though not quite like some of their other offerings, La Fin Du Monde comes to mind. Wouldn't mind this again, as it is an interesting tripel."
"An average tripel from Unibroue, it may be rare but if you want a Canadian tripel stick to La Find du Monde."
"D - This has held up reasonably well. I got it around Christmas of 2008 and the aroma has developed a nice port wine oxidation character. Unfortunately the taste has smoothed out and lacks depth and richness of flavor. Lower in alcohol than Fin du Monde and sufficiently different that it should be available outside La Belle Province."
"Overall: a good beer from a good company, would have again but I would like it to be more complex"
"Drinkability: Fits the style. Unique enough. Complex enough. Virtually unnoticeable alcohol. A bit more complexity would earn it a considerably higher score."
"The beer pours orange color with some yellow notes. A lot of sediments in the beers floats, quite huge piece too. The head is very thin, I see carbonation but no head... The smell is principally yeast, fruits (citrus, orange) with light notes of spice. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel isn't bad, medium body and the beer is feels round in the mouth... at the end it taste a little too much like syrup... Did I taste some cloves?... maybe."
"Overall, a wonderful example of the style and interesting drinking. Really enjoyed the layers that were presented."
"Thanks to papat444 for so generously sharing this with me through CanBIF."
"Thanks to zorprime for the bottle - now I'm almost through the Canadian top 25!"
"Note: Buy this again next time we have curried chicken w/coconut milk (and apples)."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale golden hue, with a number of fingers of thin foamy white head, which leaves a very thin coating of lace around the glass. It smells of sweet and acidic fruit - apples, white grapes, and mild yeast. The taste is honey, raisins, apples, caramel malt, cloves, and a bit of floral yeast. The carbonation is fairly moderate for Unibroue, the body creamy and crisp, and it finishes dry and fruity. The alcohol is barely noticeable, rendering this quite drinkable, and enjoyable."
"Taste wise, the Eau Bénite continues the fruity theme from the nose, sweetened with honey and gingery spiciness. This beer put me in mind of the La Goudale although with a fuller body and a smooth softness in the throat."
"Buy it if and while you still can, Unibroue should bring it back..."
"D: Very nice axample. Very drinkable. No hint of the ABV but too bad it has not been made in years."
"The taste was a warming well balanced complex brew. lots of flavours going on including banana and raisin. Nice carbonation, very drinkable; another well crafted brew from Unibroue"
"Pours a murky orangish yellow, soft thick head crowns the ""eau benite"" chalice. A delicate film of lace is present as the beer goes down. Aroma of spicy esters, figs and sugar. Flavor is a crisp strong hit of malt, spice (clove and cinnamon) and fruity (figs, passionfruit, watermelon) esters. Also present was the signature ""unibroue"" yeast strain ester profile, one I like."
"This is probably one of the most refreshing brews I've ever had. Not too overwhelming and continues to be very inviting all the way to the end."
"D- A bit too abrasive in the carbonation, some nice flavours, but i feel duvel beats it with its easier on the stomach carbonation, i felt very bloated and uncomfortable after 1 bottle here. However, taste and smell was impressive making this a nice example."
"D: Another triumph from Unibroue. Nice and complex and highly drinkable given it's 7.7% ABV (relatively low for a Belgian strong pale ale) I don't know if I would classify this one as a ""triple"" like they do, nevertheless, a highly enjoyable beer that I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
"Pas trop pétillante, pas trop alcoolisée, très agréable!"
"My review is that IF you can get your hands on a bottle of this, do so. It's quite enjoyable, tastes great, and is one of Unibroue's best offerings. I wish they weren't discontinuing it because, well, the more Unibroue styles out there the better! If you can't get it, enjoy a La Fin du Monde or Trois Pistoles. Both of those are just as good! (if not better)"
"D - Another nice beer from Unibroue. Not my number one pick but more drinkable given the lower (for Unibroue) ABV%."
"Review added 10-31-2007, translated from french 3-4-2008."
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a golden colour with a good head and leaves a lace foming some nice drawings. Smell is fruity, sweet apples and white grapes, with coriander and molasses. Sweet flavor, with a body lighter than expected, but good. Taste of apple cake, marzipan, white grapes, vanilla."
"Right up there with my favourite Unibroues; wish it was available in Ontario!"
"d: relatively light for a triple (could've used a bit more flavor) but rather refreshing. look forward to another."
"to try the fantastic brews from Unibroue."
"I know there must be some difference not discernable by someone of my meager abilities, but as a first approximation this is re-bottled Fin Du Monde (and it's good)."
"Drinkability: Excellent flavor and really pampers the palate. A fine rendition of the style, and one of my favorites from Unibroue."
"And that devil in the bathtub on the label needs a haircut badly."
"drinkability is good. balanced and enjoyable."
"Thanks to fellow BA HardTarget for generously sharing this example."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable. If you are a Unibroue fan (as I am) you should enjoy this. I need to try to get another to do a side by side with La Fin to tease out the differences."
"D- Light enough to be refreshing. Flavourful and strong enough to sip. Limited a little by high alcohol that goes right to your head. Wish more stores stocked this one as I prefer it to many easier to find beers from Unibroue. Good to see the Unibroue classics holding up despite the outside ownership."
"This beer is well-placed in the strong pale ale category and nicely quaffable  though it isn't a standout."
"D: Very good."
"D - For a ""strong"" ale, this one is fairly light. Qualifies as an easy-drinking, mild flavoured Belgian - and may be more accessible than one of the heavier Unibroue ales."
"goes down easy, and really packs some kick."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a large head that dissipates just a shade quickly and leaves very little lacing. Smell is of spices and light fruits like melon and banana, with cloves and vanilla showing up and a noticable alcoholic tone to the whole aroma. Taste is malty, with wheat and grains present along with a light fruitiness, cloves, and a touch of yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, well carbonated, and warming, and drinkability is pretty good. An interesting offering from Unibroue, and much more pleasant than most other holy water, but not quite as good as this brewery's best beers."
"Age has done well for this beer. Flavors seem fairly mellow while the aroma is just as tantilizing as one could hope for."
"Quite beautiful light golden color, smell is all banana with some other tropical fruit, like papaya or guava. Intensely peppery flavor, alos with notes of coriander and an underlying tropical fruit sweetness, but with a beautiful drying finish. Quite nice, like a spicier, double hefeweizen almost -- reminds me of Duvel in more than one way. Would certainly buy this if available in the US, and was quite happy to pay only $5.50 CDN for this big bottle."
"Overall - A good Belgian pale ale.... Recommended..."
"No complaints here, but no rave review either. A solid beer, and perhaps good for people just learning about the Belgian brews. I'm glad to have tried it, but it doesn't break my heart that this particular beer from Unibroue is not available locally."
"A good beer, but not very pronounced in any kind of way. It is just too 'middle of the road' for me."
"I always seem to stumble across these obscure Unibroue offerings. Seeing as this isnt sent my way, it was nice to be able to try this at a Belgian beer tasting over the weekend. Yeasty, perfumey aroma with hints of sweet malts, herbs, vanilla, fruits and apples. Notes of caramel and fruits (especially apple). Dry with a nice creamy body."
"This beer is quite good, I really like how it has a light, easy drinking, yet still rich character to it. It has lots of elements of a perfect Tripel. Something seems to be missing here in the end though, it seems to be missing a little bit of richness and complexity that the best examples have. It is quite enjoyable though, and I certainly recommend it."
"Not a session beer, designed for sitting in front of the fireplace, scratching your pups ears."
"A clean golden yellow beer lots of cabonation. Has a small white head. There a slight sweetness to the aroma at first with peaches dried fruit and candy. In the background there is a spicey hop note wrapped around an alcohol backbone. The taste starts with a light sweet malt with some prickly bitterness in the middle and the spicey hop note in the finish before the alcohol kicks in."
"Drinkability- Why do I always only get one of each beer when I know I can get it here? Very good beer if you get a chance to try."
"This is a lighter tasting offering from Unibroue. Almost Saison-like in colour and fruit notes. The finish is soft with metallic overtones. However having had this beer many times the metallic notes are likely to evaporate in 3-4 sips. I like this beer with lighter fare as it does not have the huge profile of Maudite, Fin De Monde or Trois pistolles."
"Hazy golden colour topped by a fluffy, white head. Nice lacing. Spicy aroma with plenty of fruit (partly banana) and some sweet malt. Fruity flavour laced with spice, a bit peppery toward the end, and it finishes with a hint of alcohol warmth. Creamy texture with generous carbonation that makes it a bit ""airy"". A fine beer, definitely worth trying."
"Decent overall, worth drinking."
"Cloudy and dark gold in colour. Lots of carbonation. Aromas are of yeast, various spices, and banana. Flavors are fairly sweet, like a hefeweizen, but dry up with a nice peppery finish. This one tastes more like a suped-up hefeweizen than a tripel. Solid and quite drinkable, but unspectacular."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden blonde, big head forms then goes, laces well on the glass. Smells sweet, spices, very malty, some yeasty bread. The taste is sweet, substantial malt, some spice in the middle then a dry, slightly bitter finish. Good beer, but the sameness of Unibroue has its limits."
"Clear light gold with a big pretty white head that lasts a while. Aroma of corn, plastic, and alcohol, but nothing in large amounts. The flavor is also surprisingly subtle for such a strong beer. A rotten corn flavor is accompanied by grain husk, medicinal sting, and higher alcohols. Eww Benite is more like it. Starts slick, gives the tongue a little bite, and then takes off. Belgian malt liquor. Not good."
"great summer unibroue in the vein of their blanche. wish it was US released and available like golden monkey, certainly on par with it."
"An interesting brew, quite drinkable, that could without a doubt benefit from a better head retention."
"Pours a cloudy golden peach body, with a fluffy white head, great retention. Unmistakable aroma of Unibroue yeast. Spicey and fruity nose. Taste of honey, lots of rich and complex malty flavours and fruits. Moderate bitterness, alcoholic and warming. Always a pleasure drinking unibrou.e"
"Slightly cloudy golden yellow color. Nice 1"" fizzy head with good retention. The aroma is slightly fruity, slightly spicy. The taste was very sweet, malty, and spicy, but without the huge punch that other beers can bring you. This beer was incredibly easy to drink and had a nice, soft finish to it. A very drinkable beer that is strong yet doesn't carry the heavyweight punch of some its siblings."
"Poured a cloudy, pale straw colour with a tiny off white head. The aroma was faint & spicy with a little citrus. The taste had a strong sharp citrus bite and was quite acidic. This would do well paired with spicy foods. Had a tangy mouthfeel but very drinkable considering the realatively high abv. A very good summer quaffer."
"After having a great trois pistolets I was excited to open up another one from Unibroue. Have to say that I was disappointed. An oxidised( botlefermentation?) heavy malted haynose came up and wasn't too preased with it. Looking at its shape of the beer I noticed a big cloud in the botle.... should I revieuw this one.... is it hounest? These thoughts were realy in my mind when I drank this beer. Sip by sip unimpressed of what i drank. Could this be infected? Don't know either but seeing a best before 231206 so almost 2 years to go! So I wrote this report cause I want to say something can go wrong with your beer on the way to you're store.... or was it the brewer itself? Anyway can't imagine anyone liking this one the way i got it over here! Sorry, see that average from BA is quiet high but can't believe its the beer I drank! Always believe in BA seeing that I gave the trois pistolets today 4.15 and avarage is 4.25. As soon as I can get one of a another date I will buy it again and edit my review but till then this one is there."
"It poured cloudy and golden, with very little head to it. The nose is intriguing with a potent spiciness aspect. On first contact, there is a very noticable peppery flavor, however it is equally well balanced. You also get a quick passing of banana notes. The finish is reminiscent to an old cask, very comparable to its belgian counterparts. This is one of those, while not quite a session beer, is very warming in the belly. Its good stuff."
"12 ounce bottle, no Best before dating to be found. Pours a dark, chill hazed shade of dark honey, not much of a white head, which quickly disappeared. Nose of tropical fruit, yeast. Fairly heavy bodied. Deeply flavorful brew. Notes of Nutty yeastyness, vanilla, flowers and some spice. A wiff of bittersweetness in the finish. Tasty, complex brew. Cant go too wrong with this one."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a nice strong head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and sweet - some fruits, alcohol, and grains. Sweetness in the flavor that is well balanced and ends with a nice bitterness. Very well made beer. I'll enjoy this one again assuming I can find it again."
"Woo hoo. Thie one pours a hazy golden yellow color with 2 fingers of head. The nose is really nice. It's fruity, almost a bit of a gueze sourness in there too. This is drawing me into trying it. The flavors are kind of subdued in this one. There is a nice mellow creamy malt, but the aftertaste is what carries this beer in my mind. Its sweet and a bit of a fruit flavor. Very nice. The mouthfeel is relatively thick and nice. Drinkability is very good on this one. The light mellow flavor and mouthfeel keep this one easy to drink. I think I would pick this one up again in a heartbeat. A huge thanks to clvand0 for bringing this beauty over to be shared."
"Well, it appears Sleeman hasn't messed around with Unibroue's quality, as this is a delicious beer. Pours an auburn/honey colour, with a massive white head that looks like a cloud from heaven. Sticky lace coats the glass like white curtains. Smells sweet, with tropical fruits, grains, malts, alcohol and dark fruits(raisins, figs, dates...). Tastes delicious. A satisfying sweetness that isn't cloying or overpowering. The malts create a platform for the fruit sweetness. Still, the aftertaste has a bit of a tangy bitterness. Orange peels, or a hop I can't quite recognise? Who cares, as long as it is good. And this is beyong a good beer. It's a great beer worthy of the Unibroue brewery. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and crisp. For a high alcohol brew, this is highly drinkable. In fact, I don't think the drinkability can be improved. So I must give it a five."
"Pint bottle from the variety 12 pack....poured a hazy cloudy straw color...1 finger frothy cap that goes to a ring....sweet alcohol phenols and some musty raisin in the nose....medium carbonation...stays lively in the glass. Starts very peppery frpm the carbonation malts have a raisin bread effect finishes up faster than other strong U-brews....alcohol poorly hidden in the finish it dominates the tongue..fruity, honey tones and a warm peppery boozyness. call me nutz but there ar too many U-brews whith the same signature tates."
"A solid beer but not one of my favorites from Unibroue. It's pours hazy gold with just a hint of peach. Peach is also noticeable in the smell and taste, along with the trademark Unibroue yeast and some candi sugar. It seems surprisingly dry. I finsished the 750 but didn't feel compelled to run off to the shop to pick up another any time soon."
"pours a bright golden color. slight haziness. nice fluffy head on this bad boy. smells of sweet fruitiness -- lemon, bananas and cherries. tastes like an average belgian-style pale ale. i wasn't blown away by this one. it lacked a certain ""oomph."" it didn't taste very spicy, clovey or phenolic. the banananess was a bit too much. the mouthfeel was a bit too heavy, also. could be a bit fizzier instead of heavy. it's not a bad beer, but there are a number of similar beers from other breweries that i prefer. definitely worth a try, though, and a great buy at only $6 per bottle."
"I had to pick this up in B.C. because it is no longer sold in Alberta for some reason. Poured from a brown 750 ml caged and corked bottle, I like the little poem on the back label, both in English and French (although I prefer the French version better). Served in a glass chalice the head is immense on the initial pour, a massive creamy cloud-like expanse, capping a hazed deep golden body with intense carbonation. The bouquet is light and effervescent, very uplifting to inhale. Light grains, honey, vanilla, with a bit of a tropical papaya-like character, and some spiciness. The mouthfeel is also very light and effervescent for an ale of 7.7% abv, very velvety and smooth, this is a very well named ale. Mild spice on the first sip that warms your insides, banana, clove and some vanilla. Fruit esters come out in the middle, like candied papaya and banana, while the finish is rather low key as all these flavours blend into one. Remarkable balance. It's been years and years since I've tried this stuff, and I don't remember it being so good, a shame that I can't find it around these parts very easily. A triumph of the brewing alchemy that Unibroue can perform."
"Drinkability - if I see this on tap, I'll have to try it, but otherwise will likely not seek it out."
"Tart at first, but mellows mid sip. Has a very doughy flavor to it, with a faint fruity finish. Alcohol is masked entirely. This could be dangerous stuff to drink more than one of. This gets even better as you move towards mid-bottle. An extremely good beer. Unibroue has done it again."
"Thin harsh mouthfeel. Although the alcohol is not apparent, this is too dry."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy yellow orange color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, white grapes and lemon essence. The taste is malty as well, with pear and apple coming through. A touch of tartness a hint of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light for the style. The drinkability fairs well too for a 7.7% brew. Quite a quaffable brew from Unibroue."
"($2.29 / 12 oz)"
"It poured a dark gold color, with a head that disappeared quickly. The smell is fruity, just right in my opinion. It tastes like the smell, with a kind of tropical fruit flavor. Mouthfeel was good, but maybe a little too carbonated, but the alcohol is not very apparent, and this beer is very drinkable. It is one my favorites."
"This is a really good beer, but I like other Unibroue offerings a little more."
"This poured nearly flat, with almost no head to speak of. Its color was a foggy gold, reminiscent of apple cider. The aroma of this so-called ""Holy Water"" was rather estery and wine-like. Mouthfeel was crisp, thin and sharp. The somewhat watered down, seltzery taste with hints of fruit and spices (nutmeg?) almost reminded me more of a hard cider than a beer."
"An orange pour with a big white, foamy head. Very lively, lots of bubbles and such. The nose is mildly fruity with a good dose of spice. Fresh and light floral notes. Yeasty. A hint of woodiness. The mouthfeel is lively and full while the taste is malty with wheat notes. The taste dries out and leaves an earthy, dry finish. Very solid and well balanced....not Unibroue's best howvever."
"This is just one more reason that Unibroue is becoming my favorite brewery. Le miracle d’Unibroue, indeed."
"Very Silky on tongue. Easy drinking with food."
"Drinkability: I'll definitely have to snag another bottle of this, preferably one that is fresher. The bottle I had was still quite good, but I think the head took quite a hit. A solid tripel, even in its faded glory. I must also note that the label art is cool. I like the tattoo on the angel declaring ""I *heart* Quebec"""
"Medium gold color, slightly hazy. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and with a touch of breadyness or mustiness. A medium bodied Belgian golden triple. Malts are fruity and only slightly sweet. Not all that spicy and yeasty. Nicely balanced. Milder tasting beer. Very drinkable. Hides the 7.7% alcohol well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"pours out a hazy gold amber with a head to speak high on. Touches of fruit and sweet spice hond onto the mellow alcohol and balance the taste budget. Quite complex and wonderful to drink. One really can not go wrong with a Unibroue beer. I got this in a lovely outdoor bar in Old Montreal."
"It pours a lovely pale gold, with a white head. The aroma is malt, apple, caramel. The taste has a bunch of fruit in it, apple, peach, cantaloupe, along with malt and cloves. I found this to have more apple flavor throughout than Ephemere, which had a blast of apple in the beginning that faded fast, and this Holy Water doesn't have apple in it. A lovely, creamy mouthfeel, with light carbonation. The finish is malt, fruit, sugar syrup, vanilla. May be a bit on the sweet side for some, but not overdone. Merci, Unibroue!"
"This was one of my scores from a recent trip to NYC. Cant find this stuff on the West Coast. I am worried, however, as to whether it survived the plane trip OK, because whne I poured it, the beer came out a hazy yellow with almost no head at all. Aroma is mostly sweet, quite fruity, with a hint of spice. Fruit comes through big in the taste as well; here it struck me as rather melon-like, with hints of tropical fruit. Overall, this beer struck me as a bit too sweet, too one-dimensional. Rather a disappointment, coming from Unibroue."
"Pours a orange-like color wirh a pretty light head,aroma was almost like apple cider with some more tartness.Flavor is also apple-like but also some juicy citruis notes a nice yeastiness in the background rounds this beer out really well.Pretty tart and drinkable,well done."
"Lots of fruit like a tripel should have. Citrus fruit, tarty fruit, sweet fruit, you name it this beer has it. But that's not all. Slight honey sweetness is in it. A hoppyness swirls the mouth creating a happy feeling for me. Alcohol is strong in this one, esp. at the end. Became an amazing brew the further I got on it (possibly because of my intoxication?) but anyways I've had this a few times and I like it more each time. Bow down to Unibroue."
"Suprisingly, this is a light orange colour beer. A lot lighter then other belgian triple. Pourred a nice clear white head that did not disapear too quickly. The alcohol is well hidden. Taste very sweet. Very good beer but not a traditional triple. Another good beer from Unibroue."
"This is a tasty beer that would go great with pasta. I found that I was sipping lightly so I did not find it as drinkable as other beers."
"This is a very dry Unibroue. It's good, of course, but for me it's a little bland compared to the others. It's about as light as 7.7% abv can get."
"Originally sampled on 2 August 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. it has a large white head w/ tiny bubbles that disapates quickly. It's a cloudy, light golden color. It's slightly sweet w/ a dry, flat finish. No alcohol flavor. Nice, but not outstanding"
"Carefully poured it's a clear deep golden color. Adding the yeasty sediment clouds it but also adds a softer character and stronger vanilla tones. The off-white head is creamy and displays good retention but leaves only limited lace about the glass. The nose offers an interesting yeastiness that displays vanilla, clove, and soft fruit (apples, berry, papaya, melon). It's very fine, natural carbonation softly caresses the tongue; and although the body is light, it's creaminess gives it the impression of a fuller body. Vanilla returns in the flavor along with a softly sweet maltiness that's backed by gentle fruit (apple, pear, mild strawberry) and a light touch of alcohol that gently lingers on the palate following the swallow. It's quite unique; and very impressive in just that! I've never had a beer similar to this; and although it did take a little bit of warming to, it's become one of my favorites. Well worth trying!"
"Small bottle. Best before date of 11/27/04"
"Hazy dark blonde hue, covered by a head that readily recedes into a spotty, loose layer that leaves sparse, oblong spots of foam. Bready malt along with wafts of must, green apple, and lightly acidic lime citrus dominate the somewhat tame aroma, with subtle notes of peppery alcohol and trace phenol. Mild honeyish sweetness is perceived at first in flavor, then is followed by notes of underripe kiwi and white grape. Fruitiness fades mid palate revealing a pleasantly dry, bready, lightly cracker like malt foundation, which is in turn supplemented by understated herbal clove. Hints of black licorice and candied green apple emerge late, along with mild, nearly forgotten hop bitterness. Well attenuated and acceptably smooth in mouthfeel, but a hair thin. Finishes clean, with mild, agreeable limeish acidity and hints of sweet bread. A surprisingly tame, but balanced strong golden by Unibroue. Highly reminescent of a Belgian ""single"" in overall character, except with a dangerously hidden alcohol content. Highly quaffable. A bit too neutral in yeast derived character, but quite tasty, nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Good...this is a well-done tripel. There's nothing extraordinary about it, but nothing bad or out of place either. It's not one of Unibroue's best, but it is a solid brew none-the-less."
"Pours a cloudy pale golen color with a white head that leaves a nice lace. It has a very fruity aroma. The taste is fruity as well, tastes like apricot and pineapple. It's a very refreshing and wonderful beer. Unibroue somehow has a way of amazing me even with my extremely high expections. I always expect something great and they always deliver."
"S'wonderful, S'marvelous, S'whatIlike to drink!"
"F."
"Although it has warming characteristics, its 7.7%abv is lower than that of many ""triples"" but that alcohol content can sneak up on ya when not looking. Its a very drinkable ale that went well with a series of pre-Xmas dinner appetizers."
"Pours a light golden color with some slight yeasties in suspension and a huge, creamy white head that sinks some but lasts all the way down. Sweet candy sugar aromas with some lighter fruit tones such as peach, orange zest, and orange. There are also some very prevalent spice tones, smells of pepper and clove are all over the brew. Huge sweetness hits the tongue right away before giving way to some nice orange fruitiness with a trailing pepper taste. Slightly herbal hops can be quietly detected in the back of the brew as it progresses towards its spicy, slightly alcoholic, finish than lingers nicely on the tongue, leaving a craving for more. Sweet creamy silk is all over my tongue as I drink this brew. Light, but at the same time not. Absolutely excellent brew, but would I expect anything less from this amazing brewery."
"Looks yellow and extreamly clear with lots of little bubbles and a white head.  Light malty aroma with some yeast and alcohol.  Very smooth mouth.  The original taste is solid malt followed by a soft clove finish.  Very well balenced hop/maly character.  Medium body.  The finish is slightly sweet (coats the tongue).A solid Unibroue product.  A very drinkable tripel."
"I like it."
"I liked this beer. Citrusy and slightly sweet, but not overbearingly so.  The head dissipates quickly, leaving a golden-orangey, opaque brew.  Not as spicy as La Fin Du Monde, nor as sweet as Don Du Dieu.  An easy drinking brew.  I had it in the 750ml corked bottle."
"Pours a slightly cloudy light orange with Unibroue's trademark white massive head.  The head fades rather quickly.  The smell again from Unibroue is fruity and yeasty.  This one has a strong fuit and alcohol taste.  Medium body and slightly sticky mouthfeel.  The alchohol is definitely warming.  I could drink a few of these bad/good boys.  A votre sante!"
"Based on Eau Benite, I think I'll stick to the 'evil' brews...time to pick up a big bottle of Duvel!"
"Notes: Very rich with many complex sweet, alcohol and fruity flavours. It is apparent is beer was sent from heaven.."
"I like some of Unibroues beers, but some pf their others have some serious work to do (in my opinion), some of them are a bit too cloying, one dimentional and perhaps a bit sticky, like this one."
"Excellent triple from Unibroue, wheat/yeast overtones.  High, long lasting carbonation.  Yellow/orange/cloudy appearance."
"At this point it becomes futile to try to decide which of their brews is the best.  Each is unique and a treat in its own right.  Try them all....and (if you are spoiled) try them often"
"Complex, fruity and delicious. Bow down to Unibroue."
