"Nice  triple, but nor very special"

"Lekker Mooi troubel. Bieravond 30 januari"
"Pours hazy gold with a thick, pillowy 2’ or more thick white foam cap that perches above the rim of the glass and produces intricate Belgian lace with each sip. The palate features yeast driven esters and phenolics – light spicy fruit – suspended in a airy yet creamy malty emulsion. The body is light for a beer this size and delightfully creamy. Slightly sweet but very well balanced and not cloying. The 9% alcohol is smooth and deceptive with a gentle warming the only warning of its presence. A 750 ml bottle is the perfect accompaniment for an evening when you do not need to go anywhere."

"The aftertaste is a pleasant experience. Overall, above average. If you can get some aged to two years, get it."

"Hazy dark amber beer with restrain off-white head, receding quickly to some fluffy remnants. Modest aroma of yeasts, citrus, dough, slightly fruity. Flavour is fruity, alcoholic, light bitter finish, honey, yeasts. Not exactly the same that I love in tripels."
""
""
"O – Cant beat this. It’s a very good tripel. Easy drinker and complex tasting. Delicious."
"O: Excellent beer, will definitely stock up."
""
""
""
""
"With a smidgen more sweetness and a barely heavier feel, Val Dieu's Tripel is nearly spot-on to most abbey versions. With all the parts to its taste coming together effortlessly, the recipe and brewer execution works to near perfection."

"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, spice, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with nice honey and fruit aromas and flavors."

"O: A great example of what a triple can be. Not heavy, not full of solvent (despite its formidable gravity), and simply delicious. I'll admit, I've passed this one up more than a few times based solely on its ugly label, but I have let my prejudice deprive me. Definitely one of the better tripels out there."
""
"Very impressed by Val Dieu. Highly recommended for the style."
""
""
""
"o: taste is a definite 5. Hindered by the slightly better than average appearance and smell, this is definitely one of my favorite triples."
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit too sweet for my taste but appropriate for the style. This is a beer that definitely improves with temperature. Very good Tripel."
"Overall: The sweet taste and smell combined, and the fact that this is a very easy to drink brew, are misleading. Not that this is a bad thing, but it's something most people don't expect on a beer with a this high of an alcohol content. But that's what gives it such amazing character and feel. This is a must try."
""
"Overall – A quite enjoyable triple with sweeter fruit flavors and just enough boozy, spicy and bready flavors to balance out all the fruit. Quite tasty."
"Though I'm growing weary of Tripels, after having discovered that St. Bernardus makes the best one, this is truly interesting considering it has a limited range. Remind me of champagne so much that MGD should be sued for their ""champagne of beers"" slogan."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice tripel, though I would put it a bit on the simpler end of the spectrum. I miss a little of the typical fruitiness one might expect from the style. But a very appealing yeast signature which makes it a very solid beer with its own personality."
"With this beer, near the end, the head and thick lace remains. The gift pack Val-Dieu glass seemed small at the time, but has served wonderfully, keeping the head and keeping me aware when my glass ran low, because I wanted more. The final pour included all the sediment, and became like a good wit in color and with no large floaty chunks. The only taste addition was of subtle yeast complexity. A lovely brew, even cloudy, from start to finish...ayieee!!"
""
"O - I really enjoy this beer, will be buying some more the next chance I get. Definitely going to remain in the Belgian Tripel stable for me."
"O: A great musty triple that melds fruit and herbs together. The mouth feel us amazing and the bouquet of flavor tops the chart. Flavor is dialed in and delicate. This is one that I will have to enjoy again soon. Cheers!"
"Overall, pretty good tripel, but not excellent. I expected more given the scores it has received. Different strokes."
""
""
"Morning: Pretty solid. You can't go wrong with this beer. Will have to look for more of this in the future."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 1/2013 stamped on the cork. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, grape, apple, pear, pepper, herbal, clove, banana, honey, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance. Taste of big lemon, pear, banana, pepper, clove, herbal, candi sugar, bread, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor complexity and balance; with no cloying flavors at all as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly slick, foamy, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden for 9%, with pretty much no warming on the finish at all. Overall this is an outstanding Tripel! Fantastic flavor complexity with great balance; and very smooth to sip on. This is definitely one of the best ones in the style I have had."

"Man, this might just be the best Belgian Triple that I’ve ever had. This was just so delicious and smooth on the palate with all of the flavors that you could want out of the style. I’m still thinking about this beer."
""
""
""
"O: Was recommended to me by my bartender while I was in Belgium after I mentioned liking the Maredsous triple. It did not disappoint. Just enough complexity and flavor to keep you satisfied, but subtle enough to make it to keep drinking. Was my favorite triple of the whole trip."
""
""
""
""
"O: A well-made tripel I would not hesitate to recommend. Interestingly the nose is the best part."
""
"Overall: A rather different tripel, with a bit of the hefe thrown into the mix, but really enjoyable, particularly as it doesn't supercharge the sweetness or the fusel alcohol flavors"
""
"poured from a 750cl bottle less head and carbonation than previous tastings of this beer,cork stamped 7/11.The aroma is fruity and fairly complex,maybe a blend of apple but also a hint of dark fruit something I didn't get on previous notes at allThe color was a hazy straw color ,slightly less spice notes than was expecting, creamy mouth feel.Would like to say I rated this a little lower because of consistentcy from previous notes I would still try this one again"
""
""
""
"O: okay, but not more than that."
""
""
""
"O- a really nice triple that is a little different from others I've had. More light fruits and spicy esthers than I would have expected, and I was really impressed."
""
"O: Very sweet/citrusy beer. I would compare it to De Dolle brews like Arabier but much sweeter. I enjoyed this beer very much, one of the better tripel's I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this really reminds me more of a hefeweizen it's really interesting. However, banana is not a fav flavor of mine so I would rather go for another tripel. It is a very well put together beer no question, but not for me."
""
"O: This is a unique triple. I can't say it defined the class, but within the class, it is amazing. Seek this one out!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice triple but not the best. Try it though as you may love it's unique characteristics."
"O: A very good Tripel overall."
"Taste is very smooth, creamy, a bit sweet like caramel with an almost candy finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, full and well carbonated and finishes very dry."
"I had two Val-Dieus (-x?) at Ebenezer's it seems. Poured into a stem glass, the tripel was a hazy golden-yellow color with a nice fluffy white head that retained well. Aroma of pale malts, white wine, some alcohol; biscuity. Yeasty taste, with sugar and spice ever-present, apple skins and a white wine sensation. Hop bitterness kicks in towards the end for a dry finish. Pleasant, light-medium mouthfeel, moderately carbonated, and quite drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Solid, solid tripel. True to the style, has a good bit of character and more going for it than many interpretations out there. Very fine beer."
"O: A decent beer, but a bit bland overall. I'd like more presence from both the light fruit flavors as well as the spicy yeast characteristics. And while it's not as bad as many takes on the style, there's still a bit of a sticky sweetness in there that detracts from the flavors."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color. Three finger with head, good retention. Looks very appealing. Smell is combination of pepper, yeast, grassy, vanila. Taste is great! Hints of pepper, earthy, yeast. Very little hops. You can't taste the alcohol at all. Very smooth. Perfect for the style. Mouthfeel is nice. Carbonation dominates. Overall, a great Tripel!"
"D- This beer is simple and elegant with some great yeast character and subtle depth and a good balance of hops and sweetness."
"This is a damn good beer. I was able to get this in a gift pack along with two other Val-Dieus. The only bomber or single I have been able to find of Val-Dieu is the Grand Cru. Which is also one hell of a beer. Just wish I could find this one as well."
"Poured a cloudy medium amber with a large frothy white head that was fully lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was heavy of a doughy yeast, a cereal malt and a light flowery hop with notes of citrus and apricot. It tasted sweet and mildly bitter at first and developed into a sweet , smooth and creamy flavor with nice notes of fruit. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and quite creamy in texture with a very soft carbonation. Overall a very tasty Tripel."
"D: Very drinkable and strong. You'll want more than one. Just pace yourself."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for a tripel, found myself trying to slow down just to enjoy it more, very smooth and bright."
"D: Decent, nothing to write home about though."
"D- The alcohol isn't hidden in this beer. On the contrary, it plays quite well to create a balanced and complex drinking experience. The notable presence of it however makes this beer less of a session and more of a one-offer."
"jd"
"A fruity and sweet vinuous tripel with nice malt smoothness and decent dry finish, interesting spice's and yeasts make this one a true belgiun brew...a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"This is an interesting tripel. It's sweeter and fruitier than most I've had, while being less spicy and dry. I suspect its presumed age may have something to do with it, so I'd be very curious to try a fresher bottle and see how it differs."
"D - What a damn fine tripel and recommeded."
"D - Over all this is a pretty good Tripel pretty easy drinking with a good taste worth picking up sometime if you see it around"
"prost!"
"Cheers."
"This is an excellent Tripel, and one you should not hesitate to purchase. Makes for an excellent afternoon delight."
"D:this triple was very refreshing and very well made"
"Drinkability: I really like this one. Not the best tripel, but really solid. The best of the Val Dieus that I've had."
"Flavor of citrus carries to the taste and is accompanied by some summer fruit. Lightly sweet pale malt body and a light citric bitterness on the finish. Creamy carbonation gives a good feel to a somewhat flat flavor profile for a tripel. Drink is held back a bit by a lack of passion for the brew even though it does drink rather well. Overall an enjoyable though somewhat neutral brew that lacks the lingering finish of many Belgian Tripels."
"D - Very smooth and wonderfully complex. Nothing overwhelms and all of the characteristics are easily enjoyed. An excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Smooth and creamy, start to finish, very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: well, you know me and a good tripel. I could slam these all night long if I had to. What's that? I have to? OK!"
"D: Nice Tripel; complex, flavorful, yet balanced. Yeast character pretty subdued making the sweet finish pleasant. ABV makes this one a sipper."
"D: Not a bad little Triple. As most Triples this is not a session beer, sit back and enjoy take your time and enjoy the ride."
"D: Good."
"Great summertime beer. I don't have AC in my house and things are warming up in Denver. This is just the beer!"
"Summary - This is a pretty good tripel, but isn't the stereotypical one in my opinion. The color seems a little darker and not as cloudy as other tripels that I've tried. I think the alcohol could be hidden a bit better."
"I know people who swear by this stuff but in my opinion Westmalle, St. Bernardus, and Unibroue make much, much better tripels."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - Very nice and drinkable; has all the elements of a classic tripel, but is somewhat restrained. The yeast character is especially muted compared to classic Trappist examples."
"D - Pretty good, but it is hard to prefer it over other good Belgian options."
"D: I love a good Tripel. Val-Dieu goes down easy and knocks you on your butt if you're not careful, just like a good Tripel should. An excellent pickup."
"Pours a clear golden color with more than 2 fingers of white foam. Really good retension due to bubbles of carbination providing constant support. Significant amount of clingy lace all around the glass. Sweet aroma riddled with spice like clove and fruit similar to pears and apples. Some alcohol thrown into the aroma as well to mix it up. Taste is sweet upfront tasting like pear/apple and clove. Tiny bit of hop bitterness keeping the sweetness in check. Somewhat dry finish that is quite warming. Medium to light feel and highly carbed. Lingering taste of the fruity sweetness is left in the mouth that is similar to sour apple but without the sourness...if that makes any sense. Overall very enjoyable."
"D - Good but abv is not well masked and carbonation is too high."
"OVERALL: Excellent triple, very true to the style. Very tasty for sure, though perhaps not as good a triple as their double is a double. One to check out if you're a triple fan. Recommended."
"D Good for the style which is not particularly drinkable with its traditionally big ABV and tastes. That being said, I found the bottom of this great looking snifter within about 5 minutes. 4.0"
"D: cant put the glass down, even though it is now empty"
"O: I have not had much from Val-Dieu previously, but this brew impressed with with its mixture of solid pale maltiness, light fruit tones, and deft alcohol presence and herbal and light citrus hopping. Definitely give this one a run."
"Medium body and very tasty."
"This poured a hazy light gold with lots of white head. It smelled like faint lemon and earthy sour yeast, with some banana and light spices. It tasted like lemon and sour but creamy yeast, with some earthy spices and a bit of candi sugar. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this beer had a nice, clean scent and taste with a fairly smooth body. But it wasn't very complex or bold, or unique in any way. It hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink, but there wasn't much else to this beer. Enjoyable but forgettable."
"Finish is full in the mouth, as the carbonation dies quickly. Has a very distinct ""living beer"" taste that I found in a lot of similar Belgian tripels. Strong, 9%ABV well hidden by citrus malts and the apple crispness and wheat grains renders a wonderful, round finish that is uncharacteristic of the style."
"D - A very moddest tripel, but not a very complex palate as others."
"Very drinkable!"
"D - Overall a pretty good tripel. Not my favorite, but definitely nothing to pass up and worth exploring for it's slightly different citrus/pineapple flavor as opposed to the banana/vanilla found alongside the typical apple/pear. The finish gets a little muddled and the phenolic aspects aren't integrated as well as they could be but this stuff is small potatoes. Worth checking out, and certainly something I'd revisit down the road."
"This is a very drinkable triple, nicely balanced. Prickly carbonation compliments the sweetness. The alcohol definitely has a warming presence but adds a nice layer of complexity."
"Poured into a snifter for a frothy head with see thru ruby-tinted body and left lace sheath down my glass. A fruity, orange/pear/yeasty belgian smell along with some citric notes and mild caramelized malt. Smooth, creamy, light to medium bodied and with great carbonation almost has a white wine/champagne feel. Taste and body are almost chewey with some sweet malts balanced with pear, citric and apple fruit notes with a crisp, sharp finish thanks to some herbal hop bitterness. This tripel is both fruity and sweet and dry and sour at the same time - they really pull off a balancing act. I ended up killing my glass real quick which isn't quite recommended considering the high (and hidden) ABV. Not that trips are my fave, but this is one damn good Belgian."
"I could drink this for a good part of the night, in fact I did. Very nice."
"This brew is a golden blond color with some yeast in suspension. It's generous head is soapy, and very stable, leaving lots of intricate lace. The smell gives the impression of a dry, yeasty, highly alcoholic beer. There's a little medicinal and phenolic quality...lots of yeast in the aroma, plus some alcohol. The taste is semi-sweet, with a Belgian yeast flavor and lots of pale malt. There's also a warming that borders on hotness, and isn't really well placed. Finishes a little sweeter than the overall taste. Fairly full in body. This one is satisfying, but not quite good, compared to similar classed Belgian Tripels. ."
"D 4.5 - Excellent representation for a Triple. Has all the sweet complexities I would expect, without being overly sweet or cloying. It's rare to find this one in my area and a bit pricey, but I would look for it as a Triple if I had the craving."
"The taste mirrors the smell except that this is smoother/creamier. Strong citrus flavors intermingled with the spice noted above. Thick body with a relatively low level of carbonation. The aftertaste is sour with a strong yeast bite."
"medium bodied, low carbo. smooth like a babe's ass. Keep this in mind, this berr has been aged for over 200 years ( minus 199) so it is quite on the smooth side and it quenches quite quickly and qualifies it for the quad run."
"Drinkability: Passable. By no means by favorite tripel, I would definitely prefer a Chimay over this."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a small white head that quickly faded to just a small area of tiny bubbles resting on the surface. A little spotty lacing is left on the glass. Has a fruity and floral aroma that is very pleasing, and with just a hint of alcohol, reminds me of perfume. Fruit flavors abound in this tripel. Apples, pears, and grape flavors are noted. Some earthiness is tasted as the ale warms and opens up. Is not overly sweet and finishes neutral. Alcohol is very well hiddened. Medium body with low carbonation. Well matched that lends a nice soft texture. The high ABV means trouble for such an easy drinking and delicious beer. I would definately buy this one again."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a thick creamy white head that settles into a lasting lacing. Aroma of light crisp fruit, candi sugar and alcohol. Medium bodied and very quaffable with a very smooth, crisp light fruit flavor and dry finish. Very good."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian triple ale."
"Very good, but short of great."
"Pours golden with a pure white head that sticks around as a medium cap. Fairly nice lacing. Not as sweet smelling as some Tripels, but with the standars Belgian yeast nose with cloves, tangy sweetness, and dry spice. Fairly mellow flavor with the alcohol well hidden. Relatively dry for the style with a creamy light sweetness and some light pineapple, banana, and tangerine flavors. Very smooth and even a bit nutty and creamy on the finish. Not quite as full flavored as some, but the restrained sweetness and the nicely subtle flavors are very pleasant."
"D: Notes taken from original tasting on 07/19/08. This was a solid balanced beer."
"D: The abv was fairly well hidden providing a nice tangy, fruity triple that was refreshing and easy to drink. Worth a try."
"The drink is crisp and medium in body with fine carbonation that works great with Val-Dieu's brew. This is an excellent and refreshing drink, and there is no indication of the potent 9% abv. I nominate this excellent ""Triple"" to be recognized as more of a ""Homerun""."
"Drinkability- It is a great beer that I think could be enjoyed anytime."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - One of the more balanced tripels I've had; my female companion also enjoyed this brew. Two thumbs up."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a small head and average lacing, into a Val-Dieu chalice. Nice aroma of sweet candy sugar and floral notes. Sweet as can be, plenty of Belgian candy sugar, nice floral and candied fruit flavors, and a bit of spiciness. Very silky and smooth on the tongue, lots of carboantion at first, but goes away quickly. Alcohol warming can be felt, but it adds more complexity to the brew. Very nice, would like to get some more."
"Pours a nice a nice orangy gold tint with a fair amount of haze. Head retention isn't great but it had a nice fluffy head. Sweetness is present in the aroma, like smelling hard candy type of sweetness on the tongue followed by another sweetness closer to anise or black licorice finishing with a dryness. Very nice; I like this triple. It's clear that it has around the average strength of a triple at 9%."
"Cloudy, bright yellow. Some banana and lemon."
"What a sensational beer! I had this at a tasting at my own ABC store in Gainesville. Unfortunately it was in a tiny plastic cup at first but I later snatched a wine glass to get it's full flavor and what a flavor! Poured a peircing gold color with a magnificant head. Smell was of raisins, and some dried fruits. Taste was wonderfully balanced, nice and chilled on the tongue masking the alcohol warmth. Honey laced green apples came to mind along with suculent green grapes. Bubbly on the finish almost like a fine champagne. What a great triple!"
"Fairly weak within the style. Triples are great, and there are too many good ones to have a mediocre example. Below average for the style and very unimpressive."
"D: While this isn't exactly my favorite tripel, it is certainly drinkable. It goes down easy and is complex enough to hold your attention."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty orangey color ale with a nice big foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with a lightly spicy touch is very interesting. Taste is a well balanced mix between some sweet malt with some notes of fruity ester and some lightly spicy notes form the yeast. Great carbonation with a full body and no alcohol was apparent. Very well done and something I wouldn't mind having regular access to."
"I actually wouldn't want more than this 11.2 ounce bottle. It is way too unbalanced, acidic and a sweet tart overload. The lack of complexity also keeps it from being anything special."
"750ml caged and corked bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy golden orange with virtually no head. Smell is kind of weak, but hints at biscuit malt and spice. Tastes malty with biscuit malt having a firm presence, with some faint toffee and notes toward the finish. Tastes somewhat fruity also, but more of an apple than a citrusy like I'm used to from the style. Medium-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Tasty and pleasant, but not at all what I was expecting. Very drinkable for the ABV, and the alcohol is not even noticeable. Complex and unique"
"Worth a shot..."
"I'm a tripel guy and I love a good trappist ale. It was suggested to me that I try this brew with an open mind to see what I thought. Overall - Awesome! This is a very good representation of an abbey tripel. I loved it. If you are into abbey trips, you have to try this one!"
"I had a bottle at The Room in Miami Beach, FL."
"Poured from bottle in tasting glass. The appearance is very nice it is what one would expect from a quality triple. Thick brillantly white head that dissapates after about 5 minutes. The nose is overripe pears, caramel, and nutmeg. The taste is nice, well balanced, too well balanced. Intially the sort of triple malty sweetness you would expect followed by an initially oily than creamy finish. I gave the drinkability of this beer a 5 because of the 9.0 WTF...this beer has managed to hide the alcohol somewhere, I can't really find it on the nose, taste, or finish. Bravo I would love to drink many."
"This a gorgeous example of a Tripel, and one of my favorite beers. It pours a deep golden color with a slightly orange cloudiness to it. There's a great deal of sediment in the glass, which I swirled around before drinking. The taste is reminiscent of apples, honey and perhaps a bit of pepper. Despite the carbonation, there's a creamy, almost buttery feel to it. However, there's enough of a spicy alcohol kick to perfectly balance the flavor. I drank one glass, without realizing it has 9% ABV. I was really surprised because this beer is so deliciously drinkable."
"Overall: This beer is damn drinkable at 9%abv, dangerously so. Very complex and highly enjoyable, even if you don't like this style, or even belgians i highly recommend this beer!"
"Delicious beer that if not for the 9% ABV, I could have several."
"This one ranks up among the better tripels. Hard to beat. My only complaint is the cork is a bit too shallow and potentially dangerous when opening. I like this tripel a lot but not at the expense of blindness by cork."
"Overall a very drinkable, wonderful tripel. Far better than two brothers' version, but not quite as good as a Chimay. Worth a try for sure!"
"Overall, tripels are amongst my favorite beer styles, and this is now amongst my favorite tripels. Good stuff."
"I am more of a fan of dubbels than tripels, but this is much better, IMO, than Val Dieu brune. Pours a nice golden color, with sediment in the glass. Smells of esthery fruits, maybe pears and corriander. Belgian candied sugar is evident too. Very smooth..Not much aftertaste, except for the fruit. No sourness, no bitterness. Great lacing! Very strong and deceptively so. A true keeper and an outstanding beer."
"Palate is soft with malty sweetness, more fruit, some banana especially, and finishes with light dessert spices."
"Hazy yellow with a touch of orange hue. Mild big-bubbled carbonation. Sticky and still. Decent malt backbone to it with the sweet at the end and the citrus at the start. Well hidden alcohol, warming but smooth as butter. Overall a decent tripel."
"Excellent drinkability. Tripels are slowly becoming my favorite style. This isnt exceptional, but it is extemely drinkabke, and very flavorful."
"Overall it may be great for some, but not really my kind of beer. I can tell it is very well made. It is probably great for those for whom it matches. Just not me."
"Finally, the finish was long and warming, with just a hint of bitter. Though not meant as such, this would make a good winter warmer."
"I think this beer is a nice refresher beer but not the first triple I'd reach for."
"Really not my favorite style of Belgian, but still a good brew to enjoy on a warm summer day in Florida or anywhere else."
"I highly recommend this tripel. Be careful, though, as it can put you down quickly with its deceptive strength."
"Very drinkable. I like this beer a lot."
"Just drinkable enough to be dangerous."
"Very good easy drinker, very flavorful, easy to convince others of its qualifications. Solid tripel."
"Served with a great head that was slow to diminish but left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was of great spice and floral hops. The taste was of sharp crisp citrus and spice. The beer was very creamy in the mouth and the alcohol was well hidden, this is one to be careful with. Overall, I must say this is an outstanding beer."
"Very drinkable, but not too many because of the high alcohol content."
"to its mellow flavor state"
"Pours very clear and light gold, with a just slightly off-white head that lacks volume but coats the side of the glass in Brussels lace. Fairly slight aroma of white candi sugar and a vague, rough aroma... like fine-grained sandpaper, but the beige, uncolorful kind. What I'm saying is that the aroma is not too compelling. Taste is pretty sweet, with just a touch of hop bitterness that doesn't do enough to balance things out. There's a creaminess to the mouthfeel that combines with the sweetness of the palate to make things unpleasantly sweet. Overall, this is an OK tripel, but not something that displays the balance and depth of aroma/flavor that the better example of the style do. Nice to try, but not worth buying a second time for me... I'll stick with the Val-Dieu blond and brown -- they're better."
"D - A higher ABV without a strong alcohol taste. Makes me think of a warm summer meadow. This beer's overall qualities are why I love triples so much."
"All in all, a recommended tripel. Nicely balanced, tasty and all around enjoyable."
"Not something I would go looking for. I wish I had a large bottle as smaller bottle tend to deliver as well in my experience."
"D: Very tasty, goes extremely easily, not filling at all, quite poundable, but the ABV will catch up to you quickly. I liked this beer quite a bit."
"Served in my Val-Dieu chalice, the beer pours a hazy gold/orange color with about an inch or so frothy head. The aroma isn't strong at all, but it does smell spicy and yeasty. Luckily the taste is much stronger than the aroma is. It tastes like pears, lemon, yeast, grapefruit, bananas, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium/full, with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a decent sipping beer as you can tell this beer has a higher ABV. I think this is a good beer, but not great. I'd still try it again sometime."
"From a 750 ml caged & corked bottle, poured a hazy, hazy golden color with hints of orange, very nice lacing. Sweet, sugary Belgian yeast smell, juicy, touch of malt. Taste of light banana, spicy alcohol. Nice body, creamy, smooth, very drinkable but beware of the ABV. Very Nice!"
"Again, very drinkable; in a sneaky way. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Very filling body and pleasing aftertaste. Drinkability is sort of an issue because of the high ABV and residual sugar. Still, pretty nice for an afternoon sipping beverage."
"This was not the beer I expected."
"This is an imminently enjoyable tripel, and I highly recommend it."
"Good body. Despite the head, carbonation is not overwhelming. Drinkable to an extent. 9% abv limits the session factor, but this is very enjoyable."
"D - Surprisingly light for the volume of flavour, and much more mellow than initially indicated by the nose."
"Very drinkable beer, but remember to pace yourself!"
"Drinkablity: Quickly making it's way up my top styles, triples are a flavorful yet light way to enjoy Belgians, and this is no exception. Great drinkability, I will have no problem finishing this."
"Val Dieu Triple pours a golden color with a white head from a 750ml corked and caged brown bottle. The aroma is very mild, but fruity. Taste is a bit fruity, pear particularly stands out. Not as fruity as I might have liked. Very well balanced and not too sweet. A pretty enjoyable beer."
"Had this on a beautiful August day at Ebenezer's Pub in Lovell, ME. Served in a chalice, it was a beautiful yellow/orange with a thick, sticky head. Stuck my nose in and inhaled a great mix of yeast and fruit, mostly banana. A spicy,fruity taste, very pleasant, with a nice tartness at the finish. Nicely carbonated, very smooth. Could easily have more than one."
"Very tasty and complex qualities make drinkability high. The moderate ABV should be noted but I would certainly have more than one in a sitting."
"Somewhat dry with a definite pepper quality that tantalizes the tongue and dances across the mouth. Sweetens by midsip though the spicyness still dominates. Alcohol is nicely masked, though there is a sensation reminiscent of doing a vodka shot that sneaks into the corners of the mouth towards end sip. Nicely crafted, and definitely worth checking out."
"I think this beer could be really great if the alcohol wasn't such a huge player in the flavor.."
"There isnt must to say about this beer. Its not great, but its not bad. Essentially its not worth getting unless youre a frat boy who wants to get plastered without venturing too far from your demesne of cheap swill."
"M&D: creamy texture and rather light-bodied for a 9.0%abv. The alc. strength hides very well, like other mellow yet robust Tripels, showing good signs that this is a really mature product with a good depth. Not terribly complex, but very enjoyable all the same~~"
"I will buy this the next time I'm in a liquor store."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It's light and fruity with loads of yeast esters and pale malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm with some residual sweetness. The taste is well balanced and quite fruity with a nice yeasty element. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey brew with high drinkability. It's not my favorite triple, but it works for me."
"Guess Ill be on the bottom of reviewers, just found this boring and tedious. I should give it another chance, but doubt if I get around to it."
"""Disappointed..."""
"This beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a large pillowy head. A layer of nice lacing sticks to the side of my Duvel glass. Aroma is sweet, spicy and malty. Taste is typical for a Tripel: spicy, fruity, peppery and yeasty with that trademark sweetness that Belgian candi sugar lends to this type of brew. This beer is light to medium bodied on the palate with a dry finish. This is very easy drinking for it's strength. Not one of the better Tripels out there, but still plenty good."
"Syrupy, slick mouthfeel. Very carbonated. Rummy, candy sugar alcohol warmth in the throat."
"Overall a good beer."
"Body is medium, softly carbonated, with a creamy mouthfeel and sticky, slick texture. Very easy to drink for a strong ale."
"Drinkability: An excellent tripel. Val Dieu hasn't let me down, and the three brews I've had have all been pretty fantastic. If you can find the gift pack and you're a Belgian fan, don't hesitate to pick any of the styles up, the tripel being one of the best."
"Appearance was orange in color and a creamy head looked promising, but fell apart and left spotty lacing. The smell was very interesting, involving various fruits in which apricot, apple, and pear were included. The taste was much of the same, but I also found some spices including vanilla and nutmeg. Body was medium to full, nice and creamy going down. I really enjoyed drinking this one down, and will probably be picking up another bottle in the future."
"This beer poured clear and golden with a white head. It had a sweet and flowery aroma. It tasted sewwt, flowery, had no pronounced bitterness. it was light and very nicely carbonated. I thaught that it was very well ballanced and generaly great tasting."
"33cl bottle, pours a hazy burnt orange-yellow and makes a thin head that dissipates into a halo. Never ending bubbles rise from the sides of my glass, maintaining the subtle head making it long lasting. Yeasty, bready aroma with hints of banana and clove. Lots of banana and clove flavor, crisp peppery spicyness, quite good, one of the best tripels that I have ever tried. Creamy smooth medium bodied palate with bubbly carbonation, finishes incredibly dry. This is great, I will definitely try this again!"
"A nice tripel, different in it's spiciness. Very fitting for warming up on a snowy day spent sledding with my sons."
"Ultimately this ale proved refreshing in the same manner as a good saison, but a little bland. With the wealth of tripels that exist in the modern American beer market, I doubt I would purchase this again, but I encourage all to try and make up their own minds."
"Pours a cloudy, yellow-gold color with off-white head that is just incredible in terms of it's thickness and retention. Great rings of lace are left behind in my goblet. The aromas I detect are mostly of dried fruits, alcohol, and yeast. The taste is typical for this style with some small deviations. This beer has greater lingering candy-like sweetness in the aftertaste with a greater presence of alcohol in the taste. An interesting Triple, but not my favorite. The aftertaste is a bit unusual, in my opinion, for this style. I didn't enjoy the aftertaste nor did I like the alcohol taste upfront with minimal masking and so I would not want to have more of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability... Other than scaring me, a good solid, drinkable Belgian tripel, I'll probably pick it up again sometime."
"Val-Dieu (Valley of God) Triple is somewhat unheralded, but it still manages to holds its own with some of the better known tripels from the land of all good tripels, Belgium. Although it doesn't supplant my favorites, it's clearly a well-crafted beer that should be a source of pride to the brothers of Abbaye Val-Dieu. Its strength (and quality) has led to my serenity. I like this one."
"Poured a deep slightly hazy golden with some noticable deep orange hue,the aroma definently had a little funkiness to it like wet grain and sour apple with that Belgian yeastiness some clove and smoke.Big phenolic flavors quite spicey with an underlying powdered suger note there is a decent fruity apricot-like flavor in the finish that lingers nicely.A solid Triple I have had better but this is not shabby by any means at all."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer. It is a bit on the clean side for a Tripel, and is probably the clearest example that I have had that is truly from Belgium. I cant knock it for being clean, but I was a little surprised by this beer. Reading the BJCP guidelines for this style, it calls for predominant citrus and that the malt should support. In this case, the malt is a key player. This isnt a bad thing, but something to note. I really like this beer, but its not big on the mouth-puckering effect that drives many of us to seek out Tripels."
"I thought this was a very drinkable triple and I would highly recommend it."
"This one had a ""12/06"" on the cork, which i am forced to assume must mean ""best if consumed by," since it is 9/05. Guess it could have aged some more, but it really didn't need it. Was wonderful as is. Enjoyed some of it during a cool walk on the beach with my wife, the rest while cooking and then eating dinner (chicken enchiladas)."
"This is a bad ass tripel. Poured out to a damned nice rich golden color with high carbonation and a foamy white cloud like head. Heavy odors of bread and yeast, with some sweet apple and hop notes. Very tempting. Taste was very consistant and complex. Flavors of mild yeast, hops, and some sweet malt. Very crisp and vibrant mouthfeel. Finished mildly sour and sweet. This is a good tripel for those looking for a starting point in the style. I personally will be buying more of these. Highly Recommended."
"Not nearly the best beer in this style but still a pleasant and solid example."
"-UF"
"Somehow I can perceive myself eating warm apple pie with fresh whipped cream and sippin' this at the same time."
"Mouthfeel is a taaaad watery, but the lightness is nice. Highly, highly drinkable. 9%? Where is it? Can't smell it, can't taste it- I can certainly feel it, but man- a sneaky little bastard. Reminds me of Hennepin a little bit, and la Fin du Monde. Extremely enjoyable."
"I will keep this in ample supply in my cellar."
"For some reason that I can't pinpoint, the mouthfeel is a little weak for the style. Very drinkable for the abv. A good dinner drink."
"Significant head in initial pour. light Golden, yeasty smell, medium biscuity texture, smooth, high alcohol and eggshell medicinal yeasty aftertaste, partly arising from taste of white pepper and pear, sweet tangerine. Carbonation above average. Good, not best of this brewery"
"This is an odd duck...it certainly passes as a triple, but the cereal, alcohol and grass make it quite odd for the style. There are many better triples out there for the price (I paid $3.49 for a stubby 11.2 oz bottle). Not impressed with the 2 brews I've had from this brewery so far. Pass on it."
"330 mL bottle with best by Feb. '06 notched on the label. Served slightly chilled in a Chimay chalice. When I popped the cap it began to foam up and all the sediment at the bottom rose to the top so I couldn't help pouring a lot of the yeast into the glass. Despite this, I tried to decant as best as I could. The beer pours a translucent gold with lots of chunks floating around. It is topped with a creamy, 1 finger head that leaves huge patches of lace and retains an 1/8 inch blanket of foam. Smell is sweet with spices (pepper, cloves), lots of fruits (banana, lemon, grapes, some tropical), and powdery yeast. Flavors include lots of piney hops and yeast up front with banana, lemon, and a bit of grape following behind. It finishes with a subtle hop bitterness. At times the beer seems to have an almost wine-like flavor. It is thick and creamy and I drank it pretty quickly, but it doesn't measure up to the Chimay tripel I reviewed the other day."
"Drinkability - a good drinkable tripel; this doesnt exactly fit my taste but in investigation, its rather quaffable"
"A little thin maltwise considering what the style makes you expect. Pours a big white head on a hazy yellow body. Candi sugar and Belgian spicines crowds out any malt. I had a bunch of big beers like this between adoption trips to Russia, to help clear my palate of nasty Russian pale lagers."
"Body: Has the consistency of juice. Very thick and coats the tongue."
"Sedimented and hazy golden yellow color, with a slight greenish tint. Head of fast-rising medium-sized bibbles, lays mostly flat and white in color but leaving plenty of nice complex lacing on the glass. Fruity aroma, mostly of citrons and sweet orange with a back tone of yeast and almost a Wit-like sugary spice. Mouthfeel is light, softness is a little underdone by more than average carbonation. Flavor is a little on the sweet side, like overly fragrant flowers, doesn't dry as much as some Tripels later in the profile either. Touch of hops help a little -- but doesn't counter a sugary fruit salad impression enough for me to place this in an elite category."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Pours hazy bright golden yellow with lots of floating yeast chunks, nice cream colored lasting head that leaves good lacing. Fruity and spicy aromas. Fruity vanilla, tropical fruit and pepper flavors, very dry and crisp finish. Full bodied with a full and crisp mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden and very drinkable."
"Smell is estery-aromatic, litle malty& litle spice in a strong alcoholic smelling drink. Taste is fresh, alcoholic and malty. Nicely balanced but dry and alcoholic. Nice brew but could have a litle more bitterness in taste and especially in aftertaste thats rather dry& dull."
"I cannot wait to have another one of these beauties. This beer was almost too easy to drink. I wish I could have more."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing outstanding but a well constructed and pleasant drinking experience."
"775"
"I consider what uses and occasions are ideal for this brew, and they can only be times when you need to bring up the happiness in your life, (like now, for weak and weary me), or when you're already happy, but could stand a little extra joy, what the hell. It's here in this bottle, just watch the cork, and get ready to slurp up some foam!"
"Drinkability is high regardless of the ABV. I could see myself drinking this nectar all day long."
"The beer is quite well made, but lacks enough character to run with the big boys. A welcome addition to my portfolio nonetheless"
"My significant other, the darling that she is, poured this beer for me a full 15 minutes ago, and it still has over a fingerwidth of rich creamy foamy head on top of a lightly cloudy pale yellow body. I'm sure the fleur de li in the bottom of the goblet is helping things out, but I'm still impressed. Alcohol, yeast and spiciness, and a rich pale malt character waft upwards from the beer. Unbelievably potent in it's first sip, really bites the tip of the tongue. The alcohol waves goodbye at the end of the sip. Very easy going, light and airy in the mouth with a light astringency in the finish that really strips the tongue. Very good, but there are too many others I prefer. This beer begs to be paired with something, and seems to wobble a bit by itself."
"Great looking beer, golden slight haze beautiful foamy creamy head slowly falls leaving lots of lace. Smells sweet malt with light fruit white grape, apple and floral hints. Tastes smooth and creamy sweet malt with light fruit flavor hints of spice and light alcohol finish good easy drinking beer little on light side but it does enhance drinkability."
" This is one of those Belgian ales that you instantly fall in love with, hopefully with a lifetime of bliss."
"Delightful, and highly recommended for those who do not appreciate lots of spice or fruit in their Belgians."
"Golden in colour, very lively - the head looks like an ice cream cone even after careful pouring, and it was emerging from the bottle the moment the cap was removed. Cloudy in the glass due to the internal turbulence when the bottle was opened. Mellow fruity aroma, hints of spices too. The predominately malty flavour is assisted by hints of candi sugar, not overwhelming but pleasant. Not as much aftertaste as I would have liked. Nice enough but nothing truly special."
"the carbonation is crisply effervescant and active in the mouth. it's body is thinner (and cleaner) than what i expected, perhaps even a tad watery but this serves this beer uniquely well. the drinkability rating also seems to prosper from the lighter body as it never seems too much."
"Sampled from a 750ml bottle. Pours a hazy medium-golden color with a tall and frothy bright white head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving behind a thick and rocky lace. Nose is Belgian spice and fruit with additional notes of honey and perfume. Medium in body with a strong active carbonation that at first makes it seem that it is lighter than it actually is. Taste begins sweet with lots of fruit (mango, tangerine, apple, pear, kiwi, and honeydew) followed by some spicy notes of clove, coriander, and white pepper as well as some dry yeast. Somewhat mild bitter hops with some acidic citrusy notes appear toward the end along with a trace amount of alcohol (very well hidden for a 9% ABV brew). A very nice Triple here and one that Im quite sure Ill be buying more of in the near future."
"A lovely tripel."
"it got better as i drank it (warmed up? the 9% setting in?) but i'm not sure that i'd get it again."
"Medium on the palate with a noticable carbonation, very drinkable. Finish is smooth and on the dry side with the malts becoming more apparent. Slight buttery taste. Overall, a very mild and pleasant triple despite its ABV."
"Clear, gold/orange/yellow, huge carbonation, cloudy last pour. Big, off-white, dense head leaving thick, sticky, huge, foamy clumps. A nutty, sweetish nose. A sweet, spicy, fruity front... somewhat grassy. Buttery, sweet and thick in the middle; alcoholic and nicely bitter in the creamed-corn finish. This is clean, strong, fruity, spicy. A good, straight-ahead, Belgian ale."
"Drinkability  I enjoyed this ale very much. It is very smooth yet complex."
"What less would yieu expect from the Val-Dieu?"
"Malt, hops, fruit. A great combination. I have had this beer before. This batch appears to be better. Head retention is excellent. Nose is excellent. Taste is a beautiful blend of the aforementioned. Possibly the best tripel I have had. Way too drinkable. Alcohol is hidden."
"This triple from Abbaye du Val-Dieu has a nice a nice orangy gold tint with a fair amount of haze. Head retention isn't great but it had a nice fluffy head. Sweetness is present in the aroma, like smelling hard candy and a swedish fish[?] type of sweetness on the tongue followed by another sweetness closer to anise or black licorice finishing with an earthy dryness. Very nice; I like this triple. It's clear that it has around the average strength of a triple at 9%. Nice carbonation out of the 33 cl bottle."
"IMHO: The temperature has a significant impact in the representation of the flavor and consistency. I really felt I had it at the best temp possible when I first tasted it, and was somewhat disappointed. As the beer warmed it became much smoother, sweeter and well balanced. A pretty good Belgian"
"I bought a bomber bottle, and it poured a nice gold color with a 1"" head in my Chimay glass. The carbonation was strong, and there was a floral yeasty aroma to the beer. The aroma translated into the flavor on the tongue, with a slight bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp, and there was a mellow yeast aftertaste. The alcohol was not overpowering, and this was one of the mildest tripels I have consumed."
"Overall: A tripel a day keeps the evil satan AB away : P No seriously, this is a better than average tripel that I will surely have many a times again."
"Am tasting it as I write this. Pours out golden with a small tight head. Smell is malty and fruity, with a little honey overtone. Taste is delightful, honey, malt, citrus and pears. A mesmerizing melange of flavors combine in this beautiful brew. An absolute delight to drink. The mouthfeel is superb and dangerously drinkable for a 9% beer. Marvelous."
"Overall I found this beer to be a little disapointing. Still a wonderful triple, it just didn't seem to be well balanced. The hop bitterness dominated a bit too much for me."
"The Belgian's are so good and this brew is no exception. Cloudy yellow, good head - pour carefully, leaves a lot of lace. Sweet malty nose and sweet taste, finish is sweet and smooth the hops are there but very subtle. Medium body. Not much sediment in bottle or glass."
"Good drinkability."
"Golden orange colored body, full of CO2 surging through the beer. Big, thick, dense, creamy, white head. Excellent head retention, lots of lace on the glass. After head settles a bit, begins to look like a float. Smell is sweet and spicy, with a strong grassy/herbal smell. Lots of coriander and orange noticeable. Taste is a bit thinner than expected, but very good. Grassy malt base, with very prominent spices and citrus. Noticeable, but not strong flavor of alcohol present. Mild, but persistent and spicy aftertaste. Moderate-bodied brew, surprisingly smooth considering the huge amount of carbonation. A very good triple, but not one o my favorites."
"This beer scared me shitless. I was expecting a little pop from the cork, but upon opening, it sounded like an M-80 went off in the kitchen. The color is orange-ish and golden. A tight, medium-sized head graces the top of the beer. Aromas of fruit -- and, I think, Starfruit gatorade? -- and some spiciness, the kind that gives your nose a little tingle. It's pretty flavorful -- the sometimes overpowering candy sweetness of a tripel is a blended nicely with citrus, mango, pear, and other fruit basket flavors and is finished with a nice, sweeping, spicy-pepper kick at the end that wipes up the tongue. Very easy to drink; I polished mine off quickly."
"Overall a good triple with an interesting sweetness that isn't over powering yet remains dominate in it's flavor profile. Could use a bit more carbonation IMHO but the taste doesn't suffer from the lack there of."
"This beer pours a very slightly hazy golden with a large clingy, creamy, white head that is heavily effervescent. The mouthfeel is moderate to slightly firm with tingly bubbles. The smell is all malt and spice(clovelike?). The taste is slightly earthy sweet malt going to strong alcohol with a very mild hop finish. This is a very nice pale strong assertive triple."
"Light gold to straw yellow in color. Not much head to speak of other than a slight white outer ring of fine lace. Slightly under carbonated with a few little bubbles. Flatness hurts the mouth but it is a smooth brew on the palate. Not a ton of nose but there is a honey sweetness detected. The taste enforces the honey theme as well as a dry tartness that is left on the tongue. The mouth is left with a film of honey and floral hoppiness. The brew is good but a little too sweet and undercarbonated to truly make me want to come back again and again."

"The second of the two 750ml bottles in the gift pack. As it sets in the Val Dieu glass the body a slightly nebulous golden orange color and its crown a prominent fluffy white head, the lace thick sticky sheets that weld themselves to the glass. Lime like tartness hits you first, crisp and fresh, the malt underlies it, quite appealing to the senses. Malt and somewhat sweet at the start with the top medium in feel and the finish is middling in its carbonation and the hops quite spicy in their bite, dry and tart aftertaste that has a touch of alcohol bitterness, a quite quaffable beer that is worth the effort to find and sample, in my humble opinion that is."
"Okay, this baby was worse than champagne when I uncorked it. I thought it would never stop foaming. If formed a cloudy gold color with quite a bit of sediment present and some carbonation, but hard to tell how much through the sediment. A small bubbly white head that didn't hold despite the previous explosion and it left circular lace. An aroma of citrus and fruit with some bread/yeast elements. A flavor of citrus and fruit with some elements of the alcohol present. Others have really liked this Triple, but I find it to be not as special as some of the others I have tried. Maybe it requires a bit of age to mature."
"A perfect finish to Thanksgiving '02."
"Pours a beautiful, slightly hazy golden color with a big creamy white head that leaves a great lace all the way down my chalice.  Very spicy aroma with a lot of pepper and clove and some others that I cannot identify.  There is also a sweet candy smell as well as some light fruity esters of  orange zest, light banana and other light fruits.  The extreme spiciness of the aroma is somewhat calmed although still very noticeable in the taste.  Still some nice pepper and light clove.  The sweetness of the candy sugar comes through some more as well as some slightly biscuity malt qualities.  The orangey fruitiness is still present as is a little bit of some other fruity esters.  There is a nice warming alcohol effect as well.  This brew is very smooth and carbonated just perfectly for excellent drinkability.  Damn I love Belgian Tripels and this is a great one."
"Brilliantly clear golden hue when decanted off the sediment. Topped by a densely bubbled expanding head that eventually tames into a seemingly static thick layer.  Intricate, fractal like lace is left.  Honey topped rustic bread, clove, ripe citrus and a hint of heaty fusels in aroma.  Fruity, slightly cidery sweetness initially in flavor, is quickly ensued by pleasantly peppery, spicy alcohol and musty esters.  Sweetness then becomes akin to raw honey and when coupled with the light hop bitterness and tangerine fruitiness, a honey drizzled orange impression is left.  Moderately bodied, with a silky smooth mouthfeel.   Yeast contributions in flavor are light, but subdued clove phenol and trace bubblegum are perceptible.  Hop bitterness is meager, but manages to balance the low residual sweetness because of the high attenuation.  Finishes slightly sweet w/ a light mineral note, but otherwise clean.  Satisifying mellow alcohol warmth coats the throat slowly.  Val Dieu exhibits incredible depth and balance all around.  Perhaps one of the most smooth, refined, and deceivingly drinkable tripels available.  Superb control of overall sweetness.  Absolutely delicious and outstanding.  I'm updating my review.  The 750 ml is far superior to the 11.2 oz bottle."
"Notes: Incredibly easy to drink and dangerous at that being a triple. Very well balanced with a clean palate even with the esters and phenols running around the taste buds."
