"Fair, renowned brew from Belgium"
"O – This is a well-constructed tripel, from one of the Belgian masters, and I really want to love it.  There is something in the flavor profile that throws me off, and may just be my own senses.  It is not bad, just not my favorite.  An excellent beer, just not quite right for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was the first Chimay I ever tried and I was hoping for a lot more. The blue one was definetly better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite style, but okay."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting & complex tripel, worth a try for any lover of Belgiums or any good beer lover for that matter!"
""
"O:  this is a very good tripel with great complexity and flavors.  The flavors are very smooth and clean as well so it drinks very easily.  It's pretty approachable and a solid representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
"This is the best triple I'v ever had. I really love this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Surprising salt flavor that worked well."
"Refreshing but I prefer the blue."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, with very mild carbonation, a medium to chewy body and a finish on the dry side that is clean and sweet at the same time with a bready aftertaste. This bottle was aged at least 2 years and so perhaps it was not as fresh as it should be enjoyed, so my assessment is a slight disappointment as I recall this being better the last few times I drank it. Will try it again for sure with a newer bottle and give this classic it’s due which may drive up the overall score."
""
""
"I always drink the red, but this is a step above!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overly carbonated and extremely bitter"
""
""
"Overall: Perhaps more of a masterpiece than its stronger sisters in that its balance couldn't be better and that its full flavor is neither dried out by hops and/or carbonation, nor drowned out by alcohol. This beer is soft, sweet, spicy, and hearty, and because no one element outshines the rest, its many qualities can be easily appreciated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour in tulip at Bo-Beau, La Mesa. So after 1500 reviews it may be best to simply say that compared to other Tripels, this one is a bit muted, more subtle, more easy drinking. Each of the expected profiles that we see from the likes of Westmalle or St. Bernardus are indeed present, just in a less intense manner. Could be a nice ""intro"" Tripel."
"O - 4.25 - Really good stuff, and I'm not normally a fan of the tripel style!"
""
""
""
"Very crisp, refreshing, delicious, and drinkable...especially nice that I found it on tap.  I will seek this and other beers from this brewer out again for sure."
"Overall: Much more subtle than I expected.  I did not consider myself a fan of Tripels, but Chimay is changing my mind.  I'll have to explore a little more to see if I can appreciate the style in the future.  Definitely a winner here!"

"Excellent beers from chimay. The Trappist have been making beer for a long time and really know how to make some tasty stuff.  I prefer to pour mine and include the yeast from the bottom of the glass.  I think it adds to the beer, which is excellent either way.  I really enjoy the clean finish that these beers have, as well as the depth of flavor that the yeast gives."
""
"Exquisite and smooth creamy with a lite bite"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is what I love above Chimay - they don't make a lot of different beers but what they make is spectacular."
""
"First Tripel  I've really thought was excellent. thank you Trappist Monks. ---- J"
"H- The head is very frothy, depending on the pour, one can get two to three fingers of a light cream looking froth that will dissipate within 3 minutes."

"Overall: a lovely tripel from Chimay - definitely more special than their Première (Red). I'm still not sold on the AU$75  price for a case of 12 x 330mL - there are just as enjoyable tripels for quite a lot less. Still, I'll definitely pick one of these up when I am having a 'tripel-off' night."

"Bottle. Cloudy orange colour. Fruity and spicy nose. 1 finger head that stayed with lacing. A nice dry finish."

"One of best beers I have ever had."
""
""
""
"2013 date. Pours a hazy dark orange, thick foamy head settles in a minute with a few streaks of chunky lace on the glass. Smell: bready, grassy and spicy, muddled fruity sweetness...like a peach flavored juice blend that's really mostly grape and apple. Taste: wheat bread, dried apricot, quite grassy and herbal, booze and pepper in the finish. Hefty carbonation really cuts through and ends the sip too early. Definitely not one of my favorite interpretations of the style."

"Serving type: bottle"

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 6/24/2012. Pours fairly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Large amount of earthy/peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, light honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly dry finish that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible tripel! All around outstanding complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L14-281. AROMA: complex aromas of floral and orange notes. spicy background. low malt character. APPEARANCE: deep gold color and hazy. average white head with medium-low retention. some lacing is present. TASTE: a combination of citrus fruits (oranges) and some floral notes. soft malt background. low intensity alcohols. medium-high bitterness that lingers beyond a dry aftertaste. PALATE: medium body with medium carbonation. efervescente. OVERALL: a good example of a trappist triple with nice aromas and flavours."

"Dark yellow hazy body with a small fluffy white head. Tropical fruit aroma with a hint of yeast smell. Sweet banana yeast taste. Reminds me of a strong tasting American wheat beer. Really good."

"07/30/12 On tap, just tapped, at that, because of a Chimay promotion (along w/some of the Chimay cheese.) One foot in heaven with his one. Could be the Trappist origins. On the yin side is it's 8% ABV range or I'd drink it all day."

"Poured from 0,33 L bottle.  Mild aroma of citrus.  Cloudy golden in appearance, with white head.  Light bitter taste.  Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.  Overall an excellent abbey tripel."

"Pours a fairly clear golden with a lingering frothy ivory head. Notes of green apple, lots of peach, coriander, and clove dominate. The flavor is more subtle, with sharp green apple,a touch of pear, and citrus becoming bready mid palate and finishing peppery and spicy. Great beer, with a well appointed dry character that keeps it refreshing. Bitterness is a touch more than I'd prefer."

"O: love this brew and the fact that I can find it pretty much everywhere; there are better tripels, but not many that I've tried so far and no by so much that this seems like a disappointment. fantastic beer and fantastic style that here seems to mix Belgian strong pales, dubbels and a pinch of hefeweizen."

"Very elegant fruity Tripel with a subtle tartness and superbly well balanced. Complexity comes slowly in small pieces. Huge drinkability for its high abv. Very easy to drink for new lovers and still interesting for experienced."
""
""
"O - Overall balanced and drinkable with a surprisingly high level of spicy hops. Very enjoyable. It's no wonder it's considered a world classic of the style."
""
""
"Poured a golden yellow with vivacious carbonation, surprisingly clear, surprising head persistence and body.  Good aroma of hefeweissen-esque banana and lemon in the smoke upon opening, although aroma was somewhat weaker upon pouring.  Crude stab at mouthfeel - medium body?  Taste - initially dominated by boozy, peppery bitterness; upon acclimation picked up the aforementioned hefeweissen-esque banana notes as well as the soft sweetness of mango.  I liked this beer because it is elegant in its simplicity - like well-sourced meat or vegetables that let subtle natural tastes do the talking."

"Alright, before I get teary eyed, let's do the review. Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruits, yeast. Taste is somewhat fruity, pepper, malts, alcohol is present at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while a quality beer, didn't really live up to my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"O: a very enjoyable balanced beer. Surprised that of the 3 Chomays I tried together, I might have liked this the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful pale gold with a fair head and lacing that kept reminding me of the elvish language. The taste is straight up yeast and banana, with a huge wheat profile. Finishes with a mellow sweetness that Is beautifully balanced for a triple. Great beer for a wheat beer lover."
""
""
"A classic by most standards. The appearance is a golden color with a very sticky white head. The smell is mostly bread with some sweet scents like banana. The taste had a lot of banana and pear in with the malt they used. Also a bit of sweetness on the end from the alcohol. The only thing I thought was odd was the amount of carbonation for a triple, still very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend."
""
"O - A very smooth drinking Tripel with a solid balance of flavors. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good Belgian. Stands up to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall a fantastic triple, my go to, so far...."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body and nice carbonation that make a slightly creamy mouthfeel, quite drinkable. Overall a good, fresh tripel that suits a warm evening well. Not spectacular but worth tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice solid triple, but I would like to see more fruit flavors in it. There is no doubt that this is a Belgian made beer, it does have the classic flavors of a triple. What keeps it from being a truly outstanding beer is a lack of complexity and a bit too much spice. Still a nice beer, worth giving a try."

"O: It's a bit much. Very boozy and phenolic. The better abbey style tripels hide their strength far better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich crisp head. Crisp, yet smooth mouthfeel. Quite active carbonation. Bitter, tart, just a hint of sweetness. The alcohol makes it's presence known throughout, but less so than one might expect from 8% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clean golden amber with a thick head. Smells good and tastes really good. Has some funky finish at the end with sweetness. Lot's of things going on yet very harmonious. Fresh, clean, slightly champagney, bitter, sweet. A really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a muddy orange color with a two-finger off-white head that retains well and leaves thick frothy lacing. The nose is yeast-forward with pepper, clove, banana, melon, orange, and a light honey sweetness. Even though it's subdued, quite a lot of character comes out as you get your nose in close. Tasting it, I get more of that light honey sweetness, some earthy hops, black pepper, banana, and a slight hop bitterness on the end. The body is medium with medium carbonation, and it finishes dry."
""
""
"O - This is a solid Tripel that is both refreshing and smooth. Makes for a great sipping beer in the summertime. It's moderately complex with a nice balance tilted towards the hops. But Tripel Karmeliet, La Fin Du Monde, Val-Dieu, and Westmalle are still the best in class Tripels in my books."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a half finger of head that dissipated quickly. This is a malt forward offering, but it is relatively light-bodied considering the ABV. The taste is ever so slightly sweet upfront with a dry, mildly hoppy finish. This is one of the most well-balanced beers that I have had the pleasure of sampling."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - At 8%, this was a slow-going sipper. I'm not sure that I'd want to bite off much more, very sweet and too bold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Impressed me with its balance, nice interplay of sweetness and belgian yeasty aromas, certainly a strong contender in its field. Very flavourful but could maybe improve by toning down the cloying aspects that are sticky about half way through then dissipate. Still an excellent beer worth trying for sure."
"Cheers!"

"Poured from a bottle a clear yellow with a healthy white foam head. Has a sweet yeast aroma. Flavor is surprisingly on the sour side. There is a touch of honey and fruit, but the sourness dominates and makes it difficult to enjoy. Has a medium body feel, pretty smooth. This just does not have the qualities I have come to enjoy from trippels."

"DATE TASTED: February 16, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay 125th anniversary chalice... OCCASION: snow/laundry/Olympics and Game of Thrones--a good night! APPEARANCE: semi-opaque orange-brown body; soap-like bubbles create a prolific head atop the glass; solid lacing... AROMA: brilliant banana and allspice; light citric scents of orange and coriander; tart and punchy--promising...PALATE: signature Chimay body--drinkable and quenching; 8% ABV never tasted so agreeable...TASTE: banana, spices--pepper?--with some citric kick--orange?--and pear/apple---a round, fulfilling taste... OVERALL: a joy to revisit an old venerated ale; this beer strikes the quintessential balance of finesse and strength, the holy aspect of brewing that blesses and breaks in equal sips..."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice beer. In fact it is probably my favorite triple. The dryness is maybe abit over the top and the taste on the mouth ends abruptly, I feel this is a two edged sword because while it retracts from the flavor, it makes you want to immediately take another swig to get the flavors again."

"Not a “wow” you type beer but solid none the less with good drinkability."
"O: Honestly, this might be my favorite of the three Chimay beers. And to think I expected this one to be my least favorite! It isn't terribly complex, but it is very enjoyable to savor. This is the only one I'd go back to on a regular basis."
"O: Like the blue and the red, this is a great beer that is perhaps overrated. I certainly believe blue to be overrated. This is a nice citric, poppyish, smoothish tripel."

"Uma ótima cerveja, mas foi a Chimay que menos me agradou. O que me incomodou foi o frutado excessivo. A percepção do lúpulo não tão empolgante. Mas com certeza é mais um brilhante rótulo do universo belga de cerveja. Chimay é um dos grandes mosteiros trapista, indispensável para qualquer apreciador do estilo."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a Chimay goblet. Chimay's tripel is a golden sparkly amber color, just shy of light orange, with ample off-white head that retains its shape well (like its stablemates). Aroma quite sweet and spicy, pale malts that evoke shortbread or sweet dough, fruit notes like green apple and white grapes, citrus fruits, tobacco, yellow flowers, and spicy phenols. Palate is that of a classic tripel. Rather crisp and dry, and amazingly smooth with considerable carbonation that lifts the sweet and spicy flavors up without obscuring them. Would be among the most drinkable of Trappist ales were it not so hot and spicy! Ample clove and medicinal phenol character, hot aromatic alcohol, a fruity sourness like cranberry, a fruity sweetness like apricots (I get little dark fruit character and this makes it stand apart from its maltier cousins), vague hints of banana, and a residual candi sugar sweetness that you can detect in the finish amidst the potent spice and bittersweet floral notes (think marigold or dandelion) and dry walnut bitterness. This beer changes with age and I wonder if an older example would be less pungent, although according to Micheal Jackson (the beer critic) the clove flavors actually develop with age. Fantastically good beer that stands out in the smoothness department."

"Of the three varieties (red, white, blue) this one is my least favorite, yet has the most drinkability. If that makes any sense. It was tasted during the same sitting as the other two, poured from 11.2 bottles into Chimay chalices-- yes it was the gift pack. The other two have qualities that must be savored, but this one has more of the mass-appeal, drink your cock in the dirt feel to it, albeit a pretty awesome one. Cheers!"

"Easily my favorite out of the three Chimay 'colours'..a 'must try' tripel.."

"Chimay's Tripel (aka ""Cinq Cents"") pours a russet sort of hue, which is just right for the style. A billowy, off-white head appears after a strong pour, and then recedes to about a quarter-inch or less. There is some carbonation visibly apparent. The aroma consists of bright fruits, caramel, walnut, and an earthy, or mossy type of scent. When evaluating the smell of the older bottle, (1998) the fruit esters seemed to make me imagine darker fruits, like figs and raisins, molasses instead of caramel, and Burgundy wine. The flavor of Chimay has that nice cranberry/dark fruit flavor with an woody/earthy facade. When fresh there's the tiniest hinto of hops in the taste. The finish lingers and there is a medium mouth feel. The alcohol is masked extremely well. Overall, as I previously stated, this is a must-have Tripel, especially if you or a friend are just getting into the style. If you age or have the chance to try an older bottle that was properly stored, you'll find that it mellows out into something much softer."

"O - I really enjoyed this beer, but for the price, I wouldn't necessarily seek it out. It is very good, but it didn't have that ""wow"" factor I was hoping for. It pours well, and smells great, but the aftertaste didn't really leave me excited for the next time I got the chance to have one. Very good, and I certainly would never turn one down, but I think I paid at least $11 for this one, and for that price, I want my socks knocked off. The bottle said to serve chilled, and I did, but I actually enjoyed this beer more as it warmed up a little."

"This is a good beer, but my least favorite Chimay, and far below what I expect in a Tripel. I won't avoid it in the future, but I can't see picking this over Westmalle, or even a good domestic Tripel."
"A brilliant beer that is often overlooked, perhaps due to its wide availability (I bought this beer from the local grocery store, as a matter of fact.) Really a great representation of the golden ales of Belgium."

"O- Wonderful. I like how this is not a complete malt bomb. It gives Chimay a larger range, with some nice hop character. Very tasty, and definitely a go-to if I'm not feeling the sweetness of other Tripels."
""
""
"O - A solid tripel that simply strays far from my personal preferences. Flavor is well crafted and unique with a balanced dryness that I usually find overdone in the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.25: Excellent beer and an outstanding tripel. Certainly one to buy for festive occasions, but this baby is also good for an old fashioned sessioning. You taste ZERO of the 8% ABV, which is a good and bad thing. Not one to knock back if you have to fly the helicopter home, but one to enjoy by the fire on a cold winter night...or in your shorts on a hot August night in Georgia, like I just did. Recommended."

"Overall – A classic triple for a reason. It is dry and yet exciting brew with a drier, moderately yeasty, lightly hopped and nicely spiced flavor."
"Served from 750ml bottle."

"I'm not that knowledgeable about different types of scent profiles or specific flavours so I won't go into those details but this beer is fantastic. Incredible smell, good level of carbonation... but the taste, my god. One of the absolute best tasting beers I've ever had, deep rich, complex flavours yet surprisingly soft on the pallet, not harsh at all. Excellent beer, highly highly recommended. I can't believe how cheap and readily available this is at the LCBO, don't miss out on this if you like trappist beers or any kind of strong ales"

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"Overall Impression: A fine Tripel, but not as complex or deep in flavor as Westmalle or St. Bernardus."
""
""
""
"Cinq Cents pours a cloudy orange with an off white head of very fine, very soft foamy bubbles. The nose is floral hops and bright citrus. Grapefruit. Superb retention and lacing . The taste is smooth. creamy and not a hint of alcohol until it warms you in the long dry finish. Crisp. It’s perfectly balanced so that the citrus is not at all sour. It’s perfect and elegant."
"Overall - 4/5 Picked up two bottles, threw one in the cellar. Hopefully this gets even better after a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"aroma was of bready malts, spicy and sweet fruits, citrusy with some hop smell and a little bit of funk. taste starts off a tad bitter then the sweet bready malts and belgian yeast kick in. also sweet fruits are in there . VERY complex and a an awsome brew. one of the best tripels imho."
""
"O: a nice triple, but it was drier than I expected. I also found the alcohol a bit more prominent than I have with other tripels, which I was not expecting from a Chimay. This would make a great beer on a chilly fall evening."

"had on tap. I thought that this was a belgian witbeer when I was drinking it. has some banana flavors to it; I thought white indicated ""wit"". it was cloudy llike a wheat beer. the mouthfeel was thicker like wheat as well. call me crazy but i didnt second guess it. overall this beer was pretty good, but for the price i wouldn't buy it again, I'd just go try something else"

"Same for the alcohol - I couldn't believe that this was 8.00% ABV as I finished it off and could only taste the mild fruit and subtle sourness of this. This wasn't like any Tripel I've ever had and it reminded me a bit of mead since there's an undercurrent of fermented honey to the taste and mouthfeel. Easily my favorite Chimay and something I could enjoy all night long. Certainly not to be missed!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this blind taste tested with Westmalle and La Fin Du Monde. This came in last, with La Fin first. It still does not take away from this being a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
"Pairs very well with ceviche and Mexican Caesar salads; it's even killer with mozzarella paninis from Starbucks"
""
""
""
"O - This is an excellent brew. Should I factor price in to my rating? I'm not sure. If so, you have to dock this a little bit because $14/bottle is a bit steep when you can get La Fin de Monde for 2 or 3 dollars cheeper!"
""
""

"Delicious beyond a reasonable doubt."

""

""
""

"O: A really good Tripel, with fruits and hops where they must be, complex with sweetness, bitterness and a dry feel that make a great experience, all the trappist elegance is present in this ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer. Again, this is not exactly my favorite but it it's bad. There are many other tripels that I would rather drink."
""
""

"Overall: Pretty nice tripel. The flavors could have been more noticeable, but everything was balanced out easily making it hard to pick up on anything. More please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity, just strong enough to be slightly fizzy without prickly or painful. The resulting mouthfeel is ably foamy and smooth, flowing across the palate quite well. Closes quite dry, with only slight stickiness lingering on the palate."
""
"O- This is a delightful tripel. Definitely one to try."
""
"O: Perplexing and refined. I entered this blind test thinking I wasn't wild about Chimay White, so that era is over. Mopped the floor with Achel 8 Blond."
"O: As the beer warmed, a bitter white grapefruit flavour took over the final taste, so its best drunk at the right temperature. I have had this beer twice, and have learned so much since my first review. Really well crafted beer. Great sipper by itself, it would go well with sharp aged cheddar."

"One of the best beers I have ever tried. For me it has the perfect balance between hoppiness, texture, aroma, bitterness and flavor. From the hundreds of beers I have tried this one stands out. To optimize the characteristics of this beer, we poured it on an approved Chimay glass that came with this beer. The head levels were perfect, lasted a few minutes which is the way I like it, not too long or short. Color was perfect, not too murky not to clear. I will give it 98 out of 100. I would love to know how this would taste on tap."

"O-lacked well-rounded and vibrant flavor profile of other top triples, decent but not among my favorites of the style"
"O: I enjoyed this beer a lot but a bit less than I did with the blue or red, I'm not too big of a fan for tripels, more for dubbels or quads. Still, this beer holds true for Chimay's excellency in beer production, great balance but has a slightly steep price, but it's somewhat justified, it is pretty damn good. Recommended by me."
""
""
"It's been a while since I've had a nice Chimay white, so let's see how it goes tonight. It pours a lightly-cloudy amber-brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises bread, Belgian yeast, light clove, and a hint of orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with more clove and black pepper and a bit of banana peel for good measure. The breadiness is also toned down a bit here, helping the spices shine through. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a nice tripel, but not quite the paragon of the style I used to consider it being. The yeast comes across too bready and dominant to allow for much nuance to surface, but at least it's a tasty yeast effect..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a bland-tasting, poorly balanced brew, not worthy of a Belgium beer aficionado. I'd choose this at a sports bar if there was nothing else available to get me buzzed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a good-looking hazy honey colour with a respectable white head that lingers and laces. Aroma of pure ""Belgian yeast", nicely rounded with caramelized tones and subtle cider spices. The taste is delightfully dry, with the bitter finish nicely complimenting the 8.3% ABV alcohol warmth. It is well balanced and transitions to and from a sweetness with depth. Elements of ripened stone fruit support the fundamental yeast flavours."
""
""
"O:chimay never does me rong all there beers are out of this world. this might be there best beer right up there with the blue labe. wasent the biggest fan of triples till I had this one now I can't wait to try more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: one of the big three Belgian tripels (IMO) - of the same spirit as the Westmalle or Kermeliet. All three being tripels any BA should try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"94/100 for the style. 82-87 based on personal taste (which tends towards heavier, maltier beverages). Truly ""overall", comparing and combining and collating my style-referenced judgment with personal taste, a solid 88 out of 100."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really nice tripel. I was a little worried when I first smelled it because of the banana aroma, but was pleasantly surprised that it had a depth of other complex flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-One of the few beers that approached the level of Damnation for me. One of the best Tripels I've had."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is an enjoyable tripel. I happen to like the sweetness of the yeast here, but others may want a more herbal variety. Fabulous mouthfeel makes for a drinkable, but not chugable beer."
""
""
"Thick creamy texture with a slight warming that finishes dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Out of the four beers tasted during this small tasting this stood out in a different class. Exceptionally well balanced beer. As a personal note I prefer the red and blue Chimay's, the bitterness in this one not personally desired so much in this style."
""
""
"O: smooth an delicate with light flavors, refreshing carbonation, a pleasant ale"
"O: I really enjoy this beer. Monks putting in good work."
""
""
"The carbonation here is high, with a particular bite in the finish. Not super drinkable, but it's not supposed to be. This is good, but I prefer Westmalle."
""
"The Chimay Tripel, has the expected golden, hazy appearance, with a creamy white neck. The aroma emanates pears and apples, with very slight background tones of bread/caramel. The taste is powerful: the hops are very present in this full bodied, creamy, and well-carbonated beer. A slight acidity can be noticed in the background, superbly balance with the hop bitterness. The aftertaste is long and hoppy, and leaves a beautiful Belgian lace in your glass. This is a refreshing, and (as it should be) potent Tripel - but delicate at the same time. Go figure... This beer is excellent."
""
"This beer sucks. Taste's like a carbonated milkshake. Cant believe I spent five dollars on this poor excuse of a beer, while I could of got a bomber of Stone IPA for the same price. Those monks are drinking to much of their own product, and they're drunk during the entire process. I will try again once they sober up, and quit adding cinnamon and sugar to their beers."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy orange-peach with a retentive finger thick white head. Nose of phenols, orange, honey, butter, spicy, straw and yeast . Flavor is spicy, pepper and clove, from start to finish, with a smooth sweet yeast, banana and orange taste in the middle of the body. Alcohol is smooth at this age, medium thick, full, body, well carbonated. A little old, but still a nice tripel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic representation of the style, and a deceptive 8% ABV, given how easy it is to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a cloudy golden color with a bubbly, off-white head. There is a scent of citrus, wheat, and hops. There are lots of bubbles constantly rising to the top. There are tastes of smooth, yeasty wheat with a slightly hoppy finish. Overall it’s creamy, delicious, and well made."
"O: Not bad, but this is a Chimay! ... the only non-stellar Chimay in my experience."
""
"Must try Tripel"
""
""
""
"O: One of the best Tripels on the market. This is the way it's done, folks!"
"O - Very nice tripel. One of the best."
"O. The overall experience is a nice spicy malty beer, it is very tasty."
""
""
""
"This is a solid tripel. I wouldn't place it as top tier, but it's actually better than I anticipated. It's too yeasty for its own good, and the malts aren't particularly interesting. Otherwise, I agree this is a classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes- Well I tried something new and didn't like it, but on the plus side at least I'm trying something new."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer was the hit of the night last week when my friends and I made a pilgrimage to a beer store to fill our wish list. They all agreed that this beer (my purchase) was the surprise of the night. I had little doubt. I want to make Trippel that tastes this good!"
""
""
""
"Hey, it might not have the most impressive nose, but you can't knock this beer! Chimay Tripel is a godfather to most and many. I'm just glad I still love it."

"Overall- Not my favorite Triple, but still good. I would choose others over this one any day."
"O - Something nice about pouring a beer you know is going to be good. Will gladly grab any Chimay when the itch comes about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note - previous tasting had been an aged bottle (1 yr) and was not very positive, so either don't reco ageing this one, or I hadn't stored properly."
""
""
""
""
""
"F: The natural flavorings from the yeast truly shape this beer. Bittering hops balance it all together. I get banana/clove and a bit of an apple/pear taste throughout its life which I'm about to finish off. All in all trappist brewed and one of a kind."
""
""

""

"overall: Not bad, but not really great either. I've tasted it before, cheaper and better too. It's refreshing, but too alcohol heavy to consider it for this purpose. Which is a bit of the thing of more heavy beers going for the ""fresh summer flavor"" - it just doesn't really work. Not sure what to do with this one ... not a keeper for me."
""
""
"O- Good beer, maybe I shouldn't have poured all of the yeast in. But still very Belgian, very Trappist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy mouth feel with good carbonation support. A great beer that was my introduction to Belgian Ales years ago."
""
""
"fa la la la laaa la la la la!"
"Aromas are yeasty and straw like, also a little fruity and malty. Huge fluffy cloud like white head, shimmers down to a thin snow cap. Very dark yellow in color. Nice bubbly mouthfeel is noticed before the flavor. Highly carbonated. Slight bitterness and dry, touch of white wine, alcohol well hidden initially yet there is a slight rum like aftertaste. Very warming after a few sips. Light bodied with a dry finish. Decent but not as good as I anticipated. Overall just bland. Body is great though with the creamy bubbly mouthfeel."
""
"This beer pours a hazy gold with a big fluffy off white head, world class retention, and some lacing. Smell is raisins, banana, clove, barley, and alcohol. Taste is very citrusy sweet moving into a slightly metallic dry sour finish. Mouthfeel is dry with a lot of carbonation. Honestly not my favorite. I expected more."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Chimay delivers with another great representation of the style. No off flavors but nothing special either. Would I drink it again? Maybe."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well made beer. I like the Blue labeled Chimay better but this is a good tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pleasant brew."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on-tap, around the corner. Appearance was a light orange, golden color with VERY slight (almost nonexistent) creamy head that was likely due more to the college pour from the bartender than the beer itself. Caught a surprising whiff of bananas, cloves, and dried fruit. Reminded me of a weird heffy, but in a good way. Taste was awesome... white grape fruitiness at first with a dry, peppery bite to it on the back end. I also tasted a bit of booziness that lingered well after sipping. Very carbonated, but it goes well with the style. Really enjoyed this beer, though it could be more nostalgia driving this review as Chimay was what got me into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A true Trappist tripel that is fairly complex. Not the best drinkability, but a must try."
""
"Poured from a bottle at Stubbies in Gainesville. Nice frothy head and strong fruit--white grape, pear, banana--and yeasty aroma. Flavor follows with steong yeast mixed in some banana, fig, and some belgian tang that balances the sweet SO nicely. Very nice beer. Chimay may be my favorite Belgian brewery, and definitely is at the top of my Trappistes across their beers."
"O- white not quite as good as its red and blue counterparts, still very solid. Highly drinkable and well balanced"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden color with a huge frothy white head that shows remarkable retention and tons of lace. Smells of pepper and light sweet sugar with hints of orange marmalade. Tons of yeast and fruity esters with little to no hop presence. The flavor is filled with sweet sugary maltiness with honey and light sugars being in the forefront. Sweet light fruit flavors of orange and tangerine with a light sweet cherry flavor. Lots of pepper and yeasty phenols round this out quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet prickly mouthfeel. Very well balanced well made beer, as common as this is it's hard to believe it took me this long to try it."
""
""
""
""
"Just an all time classic. Haven't had this one for about 7 years. Nice pour with a pillow white head with some interesting pear like, dryness on the nose. Complete floral, yet not overwhelming apricot, champagne in the back. Finishes dry like a vermouth. Easy to drink and very powerful, although undetected by the nose or tongue. Outstanding, top shelf chimay greatness. I may argue this is a belgian strong ale instead of a tripel but then again, WTF do I know, they've been brewing it for centuries! It'll put ""cinq"" sense into your beer brain!"

"Overall - Good beer, but I don't buy the hype, and it's not a beer I'd buy again at the price it's sold for. I've never been big on Trappist ales, drinking the highly touted Chimay series further confirms this. To each their own!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"overall... i'll tone it down. i just love this stuff and i'm not sure why i keep 'trying' all those other beers when i know the chimay and duvel line up is all i really need to be happy. they can get a little rich after repeated uses, but that's what germany was made for. i'm trying to calm myself down. but i gotta give this a 4.9. i dont believe in 5's either (just as their is no 10 in women), but i truly believe, that with as high an abv as this (and duvel) has, this has got to be (one of) the best beers in the world, across all categories. and i'm hardly buzzed yet. well, maybe a little."
""
"This ia solid tripel, but I was hoping for something more flavorful from a classic. it's enjoyable, balanced, and clean though a bit boozy. I enjoyed it, but I'll probably seek out other tripels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Maybe its the slight bit of age, but this beer is much more impressive than the first time I tried it a few years ago. Delicious fruity tripel that doesn't go over kill on the spice. Well done Chimay, well done."
""
""
"Found a single bottle of this beer to buy at our local Earth Fare. Had heard the all the hype so figured I had to try it. My son in law had just come back from a tour in Europe and had been to Belgium on numerous occasions. Chilled in fridge for a day, then let it warm up slightly. Poured well into a snifter. I had read the alcohol content on the label but WOW-was not expecting such a strong alcohol taste. I feel it is a shame, as the high alcohol detracts from the beer taste and aroma. Almost felt as if I were drinking whiskey. I know the beer snobs out there will poo-poo this but I drink beer for taste more than for alcohol."
""
""
""
"O: First time I've had this in years and wow has my palette changed. I seem to remember this being very fruity, but now I think it's mildly fruity with loads of grainy yeast. Nice unique and complex tripel - great journey of balanced flavors I think. Very drinkable to boot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - one of the best tripels i can remember have the pleasure of enjoying, bar none!"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This baby cost me 7 bucks for a bottle...it better be good! Poured a hazy golden color, produced a nice white head and left behind an ample amount of lacing. The aroma consisted of malted grain, ripe red apples and yeast. Mouthfeel was world class- very smooth and creamy. Full bodied, this Tripel had a foundation of malted grain, fruit melody of apple and pear, honey, yeasty and strong flavor of alcohol. I am not a huge fan of this style, but with that bias in mind, it is an excellent example of the style. One to seek out. Prost!"
""
"Fantastically crafted brew."
""
""
""
"Not really super impressed with this. But, it's OK."
""
""
"However, I really wish it had retained a greater measure of the usual banana and clove spicing. Aging beer is truly a double-edged sword. The next time I try aging this particular beer I will be aiming for either roughly 10 months refrigerated or for about 4-6 months at ambient basement temperature to see if I can get even closer to my personal palate preferences."

"Wasn't completely blown away, not even with the aging process, but as this is the first time trying this beer, I have no other version to compare it to! I can imagine that fresher, it's also hoppier and zestier, and perhaps more to my liking. There are aforementioned aspects of the aging process that I particularly enjoy, but I'm looking forward to trying it fresh, as it is a creative take on the tripel style from Chimay."

"Dark golden color with a white head that fades quickly. A touch of apple on the nose and tongue, grainy and dry with that trademark Belgian yeast. It's not my personal favorite style of beer, but Chimay is certainly an aromatic, tasty Tripel which everyone should try at least once."

"O - an extremely good offering from Chimay, no complaints here. I like that the beer does have some complexity to it, offering different flavors from the initial hit on the palate to the finish. A very well made beer, definitely worth trying."

"The beer pours like peach juice and piss or ice tea, a very dark brownish orange, but it has an almost ruby pink tinge to it with a nice creamy white head that dissipates at an average pace and leaves a thick sloppy lacing that forms mountain peaks and clouds on the sides of the glass... It smells banana-like with nice bready undertones from the yeast, and an almost lemon-like smell can be found there too. If you take a quick whiff you might also detect a slight trace of wet dog, which is not the most appealing thing to smell in a beer, but that is not overly present in the smell. The smell is actually quite weak for what I was hoping for, nothing is really prominent, but I suppose I’ll let it pass since this isn’t really a floral beer… It tastes like tart bananas. There’s also some nice slight spicing that gives it a little zest. There is almost a hops bitterness to the mouthfeel, though the beer is very crisp and thicker. It seems very cool and refreshing for a summer’s day, but sits a little heavy in the stomach (as most Belgians seem to for me…). In the second gulp I could almost swear I detected hints of peach in the flavor, but that may be because I said it looked like peach juice at the beginning of this review... The fruitiness of the beer is definitely present however, and leaves a nice sweet feeling on the sides of the tongue, with plenty of saliva frothing on the tongues top. Overall, this seems like a decent tripel, I haven’t really had enough beer in the style to pass actual judgment on it, but I found it palatable and tasty. I’m not a huge fan of the Belgians, but I would drink this again if I was offered it."
"Golden pour, thin white head, fine lacing. Typical Trippel smell, though nothing too prominent. Taste is underwhelming compared to all I've heard about this being an excellent brew. Notes of banana, clove, wheat, and a touch of spice. Tastes like a slightly weaker and more bitter St. Bernardus Tripel. Head was not as creamy or large as St. bernardus either. I'm willing to give this the benefit of the doubt though and blame it on an old keg or dirty lines, but overall I was disappointed compared to all I've heard about this Trappist brew."

"Overall: Aggressively yeasty. Comes across a touch unbalanced and suffers for it. Nice depth of flavor with a solid profile, but it's ultimately too much of not enough goodness."
"750ml bottle. Chimay Chalice glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Orangish amber in color. Hazy, evident yeast in suspension. Off-white, close, small bubbled, crown. Good retention & foamy collars. Caramel malts, vanilla, fruits & bready hints both in flavors & aromas. Sweet ripe pears in the middle, spiced notes. No bitterness. Full body, exactly carbonation. Ripe melon finish & spiced aftertaste. Marvelous, refreshing & pleasant drinkability. Perfect balanced flavors & aromas. A wow beer!"

" A good tasty tripel that has big flavors."
"Overall this is an enjoyable Tripel that is quite drinkable, interesting and readily available. Nothing mind-blowing; just super solid."

"O - a rather disappointing beer. I'm questioning the fact it was part of a gift pack as not being the normal quality standard. The Chimay dubbel (not from gift pack) that I sampled the other day was much more of the world class norm I expect from a Belgian Trappist ale. This beer didn't come close to those standards."
"Overall this is a quality Tripel. They're not may favorite style and I'm sure there are better examples of it, but she is tasty none the less, and super accessible. A good choice if you want a Belgian that has a bit more to it then a Pale, but not as much as a Dubble or Quad. Cheers!"

"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy copper with a finger length white head. There was some sediment in the bottle. The aromas are of Belgian yeast, malt, sugar, white grape, spice, and apple. It's definitely an excellent smelling tripel. The taste is very bready with some back end bitterness from some hops. There is some sweetness from the candied sugar and the fruity and yeast flavors really come thruogh and reflect the smells. There is some mild spiciness as well. It's very complex and flavorful. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is very lively. It's creamy and smooth. Overall, this is an excellent example of the tripel style. It's a quality beer and the general availability of Chimay beer makes this one easy to find. Anyone curious about this style cannot go wrong with this beer."

"I prefer a darker beer like the Red and the Blue don't get me wrong this was an excellent beer for what it was but it's just not my style of beer. As I said in my reviews of the Blue and the Red my favorite has tone the Blue I just prefer daker more earthy toned beer. But then again that's what I like and everyone has their right to their opinion."

"Chimay Tripel, 22 oz bomber: I am on a Tripel run. This Belgian style, a pinnacle of brewing for some, has lots of variety in the offerings. It was time for me to sample one of the standards, the Chimay. The Chimay has the appropriate copper color, which is pretty clear until the bottom of the bottle when the sediment gets stirred up. A good sized head forms on top, which I consider key for a tripel. The aroma is big on the wonderful Belgian yeast that makes this brew possible. Smooth throughout, the Chimay has good malt flavors accented with the aromatic yeast. Lots of yeasty and bready as it should be. No exotic flavors coming through. This is the working man’s tripel, if there is such a thing!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice sipping beer with a very nice favor but certainly not something that you would want for a session beer (a little too strong in the ABV). The beer is really quite enjoyable and slightly different from others in the style."
""
""

"Overall: A great authentic Tripel. Nice complexity with the spicy yeast, biscuit malt, and fruity esters."

"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a somewhat cloudy orange amber with a thick white head, nice carbonation and lacing. Light fruit and Belgian yeast aroma. Creamy with light fruit, some lemon and banana components. Forwardly bitter, but the bitterness combines nicely with the other flavors. Bitter, yeasty and light fruit finish. This is the ale that helped me understand and won me over to tripels, a style I really like now. Complex enough to produce a nice sequence of flavors. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, dark gold coloring with a foamy, dense, frothy white head of about a half an inch. Aromas are lightly toasted grains and biscuit, with a hint of banana and lemon zest and only a slight spicing. Flavors are crisp and clean, on a smooth body, with the clove and pepper spicing becoming more forward and strong to accent the palate. Bready and fruit highlighted backbone provide stabiltiy for the highlight characteristics, and the beer has an overall lightness to it. Great, solid lacing left along the glass. The aftertaste is a blend of the spicing and lemony sweetness, leading to a clean, slightly dry finish. This is a great beer!"

"O - A lot of tripels I have had come across with way to full of a mouthfeel, no malt characteristics, syrupy, too candy-like but this tripel has opened my eyes to what most tripels should aspire to be."

"While this was easy to drink, it wasn't that interesting. The flavors were subdued and muted. The spiciness could have been kicked up a notch. The banana could have stuck out more, been more in my face. Maybe that's just not their thing, I don't know. But I'll tell you one thing: if this is how it's always going to taste then I'll pass. Hopefully I had a bad batch or one that was handled improperly."
""
"O/D-Not my favorite style, but this is one of the better ones I have tried. One of those beers I cannot believe I haven't tried until now. One bottle is good enough for me, but there's plenty to like here especially if you're keen on the Triple."
"Great medium body that was easy to drink and enjoy."
""
"O: It was good, but for the price, there are other really good beers (dare I say better beers)."
"O: I was expecting high and great things for this beer. I was impressed by the mouthfeel, primary taste profile and the aroma. But i think it needs work on the black pepper flavor, raisin musky taste and mouthfeel. Overall a better beer than you'd find most other places, but it doesn't even hold an umbrella for the Chimay red, or other Trappist beers such as Rochefort 6, 10, Westmalle or st Bernardus. A good beer to try once to complete the Chimay trinity. I will revisit this in corked bottle."
"O: This beer is heaven for a yeast lover. Now, while I don’t consider myself one of those, I did enjoy this Belgian beauty quite a bit. There’s not much else you can say for a Trappist ale other than just that – it’s a Trappist ale. It’s complex, satisfying, and still drinkable in all its richness."
"O: This would be a better warm weather beer than 90% of self-proclaimed “summer beers.” Too bad I drank it during a 14 degree snowstorm in February. Between the red, white and blue...this was my favorite."

"Pours a clear orange gold color, full cap of prickly white bubbles, decent retention, little lacing. Scent leads with whiffs of light fruit and sourdough bread, minimal sweetness and light spices. Taste has notes of apricot, pear and grape, sourdough bread brings some grain and tangyness to the mix, yeast brings some light spice. Lighter side of medium bodied, lightly bubbly and dry finish. Lighter and bubblier than many in the style, but still a very good beer."

"Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with a nice lasting medium white head. Aroma and Taste is of some light ripe fruit, Belgium yeast, some biscuit malt. A nice medium body with a nice smooth mouth feel on the palate. Finishes with a nice light ripe fruit flavor, some Belgium yeast and biscuit malt ending with some light peppery hops. Overall an enjoyable and easy drinking Triple."
"Obviously a legendary tripel."
""
""
"Overall: Wife says this is a drinking beer, not a sipping beer. It's perfect for a hot day--but if you sip, this beer will smack you with its hops. Husband says, crisp and refreshing, but a little heavy on the hops. This is one of the more hoppy tripels I've had, so be ready for that to dominate."
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy golden hue with a long lasting, white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of Belgium yeast, biscuit malt and some sour notes. Medium, smooth body. Flavors are a boquet of Belgium yeast, peppery hops, biscuit malt and ripe fruit. Wonderful brew."

"Chimay triple.  Picked up a bottle in Sicily.  First time finding this.  Poured into a wine glass courtesy of Disney. Pours about two fingers of off white head and is a cloudy deep goldenvery bubbly. Served at the recommended six to eight centigrade.  Very sweet strong fruity example of a triple.  Smells Like a floral arrangement with a somewhat spivey and yeasty frame.   Overall a decentrriple but abitspendy.  Would definitely seek out again."

"Overall - It's no wonder that the Belgian monastic aficionados would consider this wondrous beer a meal on its own! There are so many complex flavors to this brew without being overly obvious. This is a beer that took me a while to decipher given its subtle characteristics and surreptitious craftsmanship. Lots going on here, but almost to the point where it becomes hard to pin-point. This is a good thing. And it seems every ingredient added deserves its place. Once again, I am left amazed by another astounding beer licensed under the 'Authentic Trappist Product' legacy. A true classic."

"Overall: Chimay had such a cache for me when I first started into the craft beer scene. But after having quite a few great Belgians and trying some of the more creative American styles, this tripel just leaves a bit to be desired. The carbonation is a bit out of control, and the slight metallic flavor towards the end is a turn off as well. At this point there are a few readily available tripels I would rather have."

"Overall / Drinkability: Really a complex beer. Good, but difficult to figure out what all I'm drinking here. For all I have heard about this beer, I can say it is good, but I've had better Tripels.

"O: I expected to like this more than I did- it's good, but the aroma/flavors don't stand out."
"Very complex and interesting. Over the top and a definite sipper."
"pours a cloudy dark orange. half a finger of head quickly disappears and leaves only a thin white ring around the glass.smell and taste are of fruit, spice and yeast. mostly banannas, apples, clove and some bread. mouthfeel is sharp up front with a medium body lively carbonation and a long dry finish. overall too much bananna and clove for me in another beer."
"Chimay White was probably the first tripel I ever tasted, though I knew little about Belgian beer, let alone the style, at that time. Revisiting it now that I'm without my North American go-to tripels from Unibroue and Allagash in Tokyo makes me glad that I can get this at the local supermarket."
"This medium weight beer tastes sweet from malts with some spiciness and very light esters. Alcohol warming and a tart dry finish with some herbal hop notes. This beer I think is my least favorite from Chimay. Good yes but nothing special like in the red and blue offerings."
"Chimay Blanche is poured from a 750 mL magnum. The beer is quite hazy, almost dirty. A robust, expansive cap of foam floats above. The Duvel tulip, in which it sits, handsomely showcases the beer. The aroma is an inviting mixture of hops and yeast. The fresh hops clear the passages and allow the imbiber a full experience. This tripel has a deceptively light body as it washes the mouth. Yeast and fruit on the palate give way to bitter, spicy hops. Raisins and apples mix wonderfully with the grains. Every sip reveals a slight different take on its complexity. Fruit, sweet malt, yeast, spice and bitterness are all in harmony. At the end the palate is left dry and bitter, but I for one, wouldn't have it any other way."
"The standard by which all other tripels should be judged. Deceptively easy to drink given the abv, this is a fairly complex and very delicious brew. A fine sipper for the winter months, although you may wonder where it all went when there's an empty, lacing-coated glass sitting in front of you. One I'd seriously like to try aged some day."
"D: A good introduction to tripels that I think everyone should try due to its wide availability."
"O – Very nice tripel here as expected. Pretty drinkable even at the ABV. It may not be the best out there but its better then most. Enjoy."
"Overall: A great beer! This is such a treat and a delicious experience. Its among the best Tripels and is refreshing and complex."
"O- A really good tripel. Highly drinkable with a complex taste and aroma."
"O: You can't really go wrong with any Chimay. They provide wonderful examples for the styles they produce and this one is no exception."
"Overall: Excellent beer. I may prefer the blue label Chimay, but this one is very nice. Full of flavor, and the aromas are multidimensional. Recommended highly."
"Over all just an easy thumbs up. A great abbey tripel!"
"This is a gold with some cloud to it, nice for this type of brew. The smell is good with that hoppy pils aroma. The mouthfeel is exceptional and leaves nicely. Taste, good to great. We are now big fans of this beer. Overall we think this is a must have beer. This is an instant classic."
"O: an absolute favorite of mine."
"Slightly bitting but nice aftertaste.Flavor improves as it warms!"
"O: just a good, nice, round beer, with some interesting aspect; but a little bit to smooth."
"Pours a medium golden color w/ an off white head. Good carbonation and lacing in the Chimay goblet. Fairly light nose for what I was expecting from this tripel. The nose is yeast, spices, malt, clove. Fairly light (again) for a tripel. Taste is the same profile, on the light side for the style, but good nonetheless. Feel is very carbonated, and very dry. This beer is good, but there two other Chimays that ar better. The Grande Reserve is a world class beer, and the Dubbel is really excellent as well. This beer is good, but not what I expect from Chimay. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high in carbonation. Finishes dry with a little bitterness there. Overall, a great beer. If it wasn't so expensive it could be my go-to. Just love the way everything goes together and the refreshing qualities it has."
"Opaque burnished gold with ecru foamy 1-plus finger head that settles to a cap. Sediments settle out. Initial mild aroma increases with warming : earthy browned apple and peach skin plus some kind of herb (thyme) and spice (cardamom? allspice?). The taste is fleeting fruitiness then oak woodiness. Warming alcohol and dryness follow. Not really good but not bad either."
"A very representative tripel. Great tropical fruit flavor and really solid feel. Worth aging to see if the slightly aggressive flavors mellow out a bit. Cellar this one!"
"Now the flaw of other Chimay beers only x10. This beer is virtually undrinkable with all the carbonation."
"A solid beer, but not my favorite type of beer. Definately something a beer fan should try."
"RJT"
"O - Excellent beer. I definitely can't wait to drink again, but I'm not sure how it would be coming out of a bottle. There is a lot to enjoy from this beer, so I definitely suggest a goblet."
"Food match: I would match this with a dessert because the sugars in this are quite strong. Which dessert? Your choice, however my personal favourites are Tiramisu or a lemon curt tart... Cannoli as well now that I think about it."
"I want to swim naked in this beer."
"O: One of my old time favorites although I might like it better on tap. A very solid tripel but not the best. A trademark of the style though, and everyone should try this."
"Definately a sipper. Very crisp at the start, but much more smooth in the end."
"Overall - very good-tasting brew in general. It's not the best tripel that I've tasted, but it's still a good example."
"O: A drinkable tripel, and I have given it a high rating; but what was surprising to me was that the taste did not stand out as much as the other Chimay beers. This one also does not hide the high ABV level as well as the other Chimay beers."
"$9 a 750ml"
"O-this beer seems to be a little harsh, definitely the most harsh of three colors. the taste is one thing, but the mouthfeel is just awful. its definitely a good beer overall, but there are many better other tripels out there that make me want to not waste my time on this. i'd be interested in trying this in the bottle though."
"O-Excellent. Great Belgian, can't wait to get more and share some with friends."
"D - I could do a few of these and would never turn one away."
"O- This is superb. Chimay white is an amazing beer. I can see now, from having the red and the white, how this beer has earned its great reputation. What a real treat this one was."
"O: This a great beer from Chimay, second only to the blue."
"On that note, let's come full circle and cue up some more music, this time courtesy of Madonna Louise Ciccone, ""Like a Virgin"". Tasted for the very first time! That or the convo in ""Reservoir Dogs"" when they dissected the song. That might be more appropriate for yours truly. I have had so much beer that for something to capture my attention this way, it must be spectacular."
"Well this is my second Chimay after having the Blue multiple times. This one is much more lively right from the pour. An explosive head of bright white bubbles reached between 2 and 3 fingers. Lively bubble reach for the surface of this light golden colored body. Unfortunately I'm just slightly congested, but on the nose hints of white grape are coming through along with citrus flavors. The taste comes off as a complex mix of light fruits. pears, citrus, grapes. Mouth feel is lively, like champagne. All in all, an outstanding beer."
"The mouthfeel is amazing. This is medium bodied, finely carbonated, has a dry finish. Easy to drink and goes well with crab cakes!"
"O- Good, I guess this is a classic example of the style and I can see why- all the flavors are present and noticeable, but nothing is overdone or forced. A very sippable beer."
"O - You can't go wrong with any Trappists I've ever had. They are all great for the most part. This one is no exception. It was a lovely experience and I picked it up at my local Kroger's grocery which is nice. I prefer the Chimay Premiere Red over this, but this is worth to try. I find myself buying the Red cap when I buy Chimay. However the Cinq Cents is still another fine brew from Chimay. A lovely Tripel."
"This one pours a hazy golden color with a lacing white head. The smell is full of spices. The taste is very bold lots of spices a bit of corrinder. Good strong flavor very nice carbonation. Overall of course this is a fantastic beer; complex flavoors strong bold flavors."
"M: Creamy, medium bodied beer, really light and easy to drink, the alcohol is not coming through except for maybe a hint at the end. Carbonation is really nice too. clears the palate for the next sip. Just excellent."
"O- Perfect example of a tripel. Excellent summer brew. Balanced very nicely. Would drink over and over again."
"O: It's very good and is the easiest Trappist brand to find."
"D -- I could see drinking this to excess as it is very well balanced and not overpowering in any capacity. Solid brew."
"Had this one on tap at a little place called Stephanie's in Doylestown PA. It was the first time I had ever heard of Chimay and I felt like trying it. This beer poured out as an orangey opaque color with a thin white fizzy head on top. The lacing was minimal. The smell of the beer was soft and floral, had a light citrus aroma coming off of it too. The taste was soft and had a citrus flavor that faded into a nice refeshing wheat flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and bubbly. Overall it's a good brew overall, just my not my favorite from Chimay."
"O: Good stuff. I prefer Westmalle, however, for the win."
"Very dry and bitter on the palate, which is a good thing, balances the yeast flavors well. Either the bottle shows much better than my previous taste of this beer on tap, or my taste has changed. This is a lovely tripel."
"Pours a yeast hazy deep straw color with a large foamy white head which quickly dissipates down to a thin film. The smell is of sweet yeast esters, banana, bready malts, earthy, good. The feel is medium with plenty of carbonation. The initial taste is of spice, some banana and bready malts, with a little dryness on the end. Overall a good and tasty brew from Chimay."
"O: Overall, a good beer for a relaxing day. If you have no plans other than hanging out and enjoying some good beer, this is a good one to try. And break out some nice cheese and crackers with some pepperoni. Yum."
"DRINK (4/5) Highly drinkable. This is a great brew, but perhaps not the best example of the style."
"O - This is a great beer. Fruity, dry, hoppy and crisp, this beer could go from summer time evenings to elegant dinner pairings. Absolutely world class."
"D: High. Would have had another one right after this if I'd had it."
"There are certain Belgian beers that I love ... this is definitely not one of them. It pours with a rich, beautiful head and has an inviting, flowery aroma but I find it too sour and bitter. The taste isn't too different from letting a vitamin C tablet melt in your mouth. Throw in some yeast flavors and you get the picture."
"This beer pours a yellowish color with a nice white head. the smell is a little spicey and slightly bready. the taste seems muted, it is definitely a tripel, just not a particularly good one. allagash and unibrou make far better beers than chimays tripel. mouthfeel is light and well carbed. overall a good beer just not a great one. I was undewhelmed by this one."
"Its humbling to critic such a great beer,however,I have to say the appearance matches the smell...not so good. A little dirty odor,and alcohol more than malt. The taste is a pleasant suprise compared to color and odor. The alcohol does deprive my tastebuds of the other ingredients,but its still good. Some fruity,malty,and sweetness squirts out during my consumption,it still leaves me to want another sip. Overall good,but it makes me want to experiment with other triple labels....not a homey"
"This beer pours a bit hazy deep golden color with a clingy white head. The aroma is moderate-high spicy, floral esters with a bit of biscuit like malt. The flavor is a bit sweet but balanced out by spicy hops, peppery phenols, and medium-low hop bitterness. The body is medium and medium-high carbonation. Overall a fine beer and a must try."
"M - Fairly carbonated, had a dry feel, slight chalky feel upon aftertaste"
"overall this a fantastic beer, dare i say one of the pillars of the style. very well done."
"750ml bottle purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber with a good inch of off-white head that dissipates a bit more quickly than expected. Very fruity nose, with apple, banana, peach, and raisin coming through and some caramel and brown sugar notes. Fruit hits the palate first too, with grape and apple skin, banana, and raisin. Vanilla, brown sugar, and caramel play a big role in the flavor too. Effervescent and light bodied, which combined with the pleasant flavor makes this one dangerously drinkable. Not at all what I expected. Excellent. Truly unique."
"O- A good tripel. Perhaps the most notable aspect of this beer is how well balanced it is - the floral hops profile is refreshing and balances the more malty nature of this beer. Perhaps not as recognized as the other Chimays, but it's a tasty beer and also a good introduction to the style."
"O: You can't really go wrong with a Chimay beer. Just great stuff."
"All in all a great beer, good for the summer and a great example of the style."
"Overall: Nice tripel, but not close to Westmalle, St Bernardus and Karmeliet. Is just a bit too unbalanced and alcoholic. Lacks the body, but nevertheless a good beer"
"Overall this was a great beverage - would have again!"
"Pours a golden yellow color with a one to one and half finger white head which gives way to a tight ring. There is also moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet candies along with cloves and bananas. The taste starts out up front with a candy yeast strain along with some fruits. Bananas and clove play out briefly. About half way through you get a big bitter hop bite, it is earthy in tone. The bitterness carries you through the rest of the beer. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated. Overall the beer was interesting. It was much different from what I expected the malts and sweetness where more subdued than I thought was going to be the case. There is a much bigger hop bitterness than alot of the class. After rereading the style profile though it was very close to being on par."
"Interesting for the style but nowhere near as smooth as a Le Trappe Tripel for example."
"The taste is complex, with swirling flavors of lemon rind, a pleasant blend of somewhat bitter hops, a nice heft from the alcohol, and a unique strand of Belgian yeast that all combine into one big and bold flavor profile. The lemon rind flavor hits first, immediately followed by hops that frame the fruity flavor and an overlying alcohol taste that binds it all together. It finishes dry and gritty from the hops and booze, but the aftertaste keeps on giving. The complexity of this beer is astounding, making every sip a craft beer lover's delight. Definitely one to check out."
"From a 33cl. bottle. Best before 2014. Pours a rich golden copper, slightly cloudy. Persistent fine white foam. Lovely colour. Fine aromas of dried fruits, citrus and herbs. Nice clean malt aromas also. Sublime mouthfeel with very fine Champagne-like bubbles. Fruity flavours, citrus, pine, a bit metallic, with some unnecessary sweetness. Overall, very nice. I've bought this one several times and will continue to do so. Very elegant Trappist beer."
"I am glad that the red isn’t on the list. Hold on though. Let me go back to the sweetness I am experiencing here. Yeah, that’s it. The beer just lacks on so many levels. It’s better than a domestic… but that’s about as far as I would go. I just heard Sheryl say, “This is what a domestic beer tastes like in a foreign country.” I would have to agree. Even though I didn’t like it doesn’t mean you won’t! Just not for me."
"D - Probably the best Tripel I've had. An all around fantastic brew. I can see this becoming a staple brew."
"O: A wonderful Belgian beer and I always enjoy drinking the beer from the Trappist monasteries. It is no wonder this is a world famous brew."
"(D)- Kinda disappointed in this one; very bitter and so much earthy clay, there is not much else to it."
"This is pretty good tripel. It smells pretty fruity with a little chestnut. I taste a little bit of smoke with just a slight fruitiness. The beer has a pretty color which ranges from light yellow to light orange. when I poured it, the head was medium size but quickly dissipated. It goes down very smooth with no bite. I will definitely drink this again."
"Overall I give this beer a pretty good grade. It's a great summer Belgian option due to it's relative refreshing qualities. It seems to be slightly more hoppy than the Red & Blue but I will be rating them very soon so my memory will be refreshed."
"Anyhow--huh, not really sure how to review this, now. It was very well brewed, at any rate, regardless of style. It started off with nodes of honey and caramel, which become spicier in the middle before finally getting washed away by a pleasantly aggressive Belgian yeast that was a combination of sour and spice nodes."
"O-Well balanced well made beer. Not the best triple i have had, i would probably put it behind the St. Bernardus and the La Fin Due Monde. But a very worth while beer."
"Final Notes: A solid Tripel with good flavor, just a bit on the pricey side, and I can think of a few Tripels that are less expensive but better than this one. Nonetheless, good stuff."
"Poured a massive cream colored head which dissipated to lacing. Light caramel or gold in color with a slight haze. I can smell malt but not much else. Later after it warmed I could smell a hint of spice too but not the banana some have claimed but maybe that's just how my sample turned out. Taste has malt, and salt. There's a medium richness indicating a tripel but I've had richer. Finish is a moderate length. So all in all a good tripel from a world class place but not the king of tripels."
"O: Good stuff and unique un to its own right. However I feel this is over priced and generally overrated."
"This beer opens up nicely. A really good tripel. Its quite a bit different than many of the American versions I've had recently."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours a hazy dark golden color with orange highlights. Has a 2 finger fluffy white foamy head which dissipates fairly quickly. No lacing. Aroma of malt and yeast dominate with floral and hoppy notes and very light hints of fruit. Malt flavor up front with a hints of baked bread in the middle. Finishes with a bit of bitter lemon zest. Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation up front. Dry finish. Fairly high drinkability for a beer with an ABV of 8%. Overall, it’s not something I’d seek out, but wouldn’t object to trying again in the future."
"I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Well I have enjoyed both Chimay's Red and Blue, I enjoyed this far more. Highly recommended especially for those looking for a spicier, tripel."
"As I have had the ``red'' Chimay before, I was quite disappointed in this beer. I am willing to try it again sometime under the assumption that this bottle may not have been at its peak."
"O- This beer has a nice spicy, yeasty flavor with some citrus and hop notes and is balanced very well."
"O: Excellent Tripel. Very well balanced."
"The brew poured a hazy blonde. Looking a little unfiltered. At 8% I really did not seem 8%. I could taste a furity/ earthy mix sweet but dry finish. All in all another great trappiste. Not diappointed at all and would like to try another at anytime. Oh yeah that reminds me I bought a 4-pack so I have 3 left. Wow I guess the 8% really was there. Cheers and enjoy everyone"
"O- Why so dry Chimay? I was really digging the taste upfront but then you hit me with a dryness that was like a desert. The initial taste is truly beautiful and a shame to be followed with the over dryness. Wish I could put 3.75 here."
"Incredibly soft and smooth. Solid if not spectacular, as Chimay seems to be across the board."
"Overall an outstanding brew. But one of these at a time is enough."
"O: A delightfully well balanced beer. A nice middle ground between light hoppy beers and heavier beers with emphasis on the malts. I'm a fan."
"Overall - As stated, tasty but not complex enough to earn the highest marks. Still a nice beer to find on tap."
"Hazy orange, thick white head, fluffy, nice lace on the glass. Smell is yeasty, lemon, slightly hoppy, fresh bread, spicy notes, banana and candy. Taste is dry and yeasty, lemon, nice bitterness is present, leafy hops, light alcohol, bread. Very complex but balanced. Medium weight, high carbonation that is nice but not too much, nice dry finish. Outstanding stuff here, world class and glad I finally got around to reviewing this."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the higher side. Overall it's a very good beer and a very good version of the style. Very enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"Altogether it is a nice and pleasant brew for a hot summer day or together with a piece of meat at supper, but it isn't a brew I'm especially impressed by."
"i'd say if anything the flavors are a little underwhelming, but i think light is a more appropriate word"
"Overall: I have to say that this is a perfect alternative to the Tripel Karmeliet given the price and the similarity (although the Tripel is a bit more citrusy and less yeasty.) Recommend without reservations. What I love the most is the fact that it's unfiltered with nice little bits of yeast and god knows what. Next year, I'm fasting and drinking nothing but Chimay for lent."
"Overall- A more than great trappistes ale that deserves to be in the world class of beers. A very nice taste that reminds me of offerings from unibroue. I would definitely pick this one up again in the future!"
"Overall - The alcohol on this beer was extremely well hidden and it was going down fast. It's not my favourite tripel, but it's a great beer."
"D- Overall I thought this was a good beer.Alot of honey flavor to me but still very balanced. Enjoyed the other 2 chimays better but for a triple this is a great beer. and would enjoy tryin this on draft someday!"
"Overall - Got to say I liked this more than I though I would the abv is very well hidden its full of flavor and isn't all that dry. A well balanced beer living up too the hype that it comes with. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Great must taste beer!"
"Very nice balanced beer. One of the more enjoyable triples I've had. Pairs well with a range of lighter food. Recommend."
"Poured a cloudy light golden color with a good amount of tight white head on it. Fruity malt aroma. The taste is sweet and malty with a bit of a bitter slightly alcohol-like taste on the finish. This is a light bodied beer that goes down pretty smooth. Overall a very good beer that I enjoyed."
"D: Very good (obviously). Probably my favorite of the Chimay offerings. High ABV takes this category down a bit but altogether a great beer!"
"O: Pretty good, don't have many Tripels to compare it to but its classically Belgian, sweet, spicy, a tad funky, and overall very pleasant and refreshing."
"Had in a 750ml in a goblet. Pours a hazy gold, somewhere between honey and maple syrup for shade. A bubbly white fluffy head a little more than a thumbnail resides but doesn't stick around for the party. Smells of floral alcohol and fruit. The taste is spicy, with a nice burst of white flesh fruit, and classic Belgian character. A hint of alcohol melds well with everything and brings out more apple as I delve further towards the bottom of the bottle. Very drinkable, the 8% is nearly invisible. The mouth feel is like having my tongue wrapped in billowing silk, think malls cabbage if you've ever had it, it has that soft characteristic to it. This is dangerous. All in all this continues to prove that anything brewed by a monk truly is heavenly."
"Overall- a great beer. Not my favourite tripel, but a great example of the style without a doubt."
"Drink- Interesting enough to keep you coming back for more and not too heavy. A world class tripel."
"O - A wonderful Tripel that is everything you would expect from the style. I would recommend this one for sure."
"D- Great drink I wouldn't waste this everyday this is for special times only."
"Despite high ABV, there is little hint of it. It's a good beer, but only slightly drinkable due to it's high acidity and cleansing bite."
"D: Maybe just a bad bottle but this really was meh. I have had it a few times and enjoyed it this was not that great. I have a lot of respect for this brewery so I will re review this again."
"O - This is a very good tripel loaded with flavor and none of the alcohol level present. A brilliant trappist!"
"O - Overall, this is probably the best beer i've ever had up until this point. It encapsulates everything that I love about a beer, and does not dissapoint. If I could drink this for the rest of my life I would. Its just that good. 2 thumbs WAAAYYYY UPPP!!!! :)"
"An enjoyable beer, but not for the session drinker. It is a big beer, but you wouldn't know it unless you read the label. A prototypical tripel, and great night cap."
"The high alcohol content is masked by the complex taste of this beer. A beer that is made to be enjoyed."
"Pours a murky apple cider color with a nice off-white 1 inch head that fades to a small cap. No lacing on the drink down. Smells of yeast, spices, banana, orange peel, caramel. Taste is very yeasty all around. Sweet malt, dried fruits, and spices on the finish. There is a herbal-like bitterness on the tongue after each sip. Carbonation level is good. Very crisp drinking. Easy to drink and enjoy sip by sip."
"D - Very enjoyable but unusual tripel. I highly recommend it."
"Very nice beer. I would buy Chimmay by the case if it wasn't so dam expensive."
"D- YES"
"This is a very drinkable beer. The look is yellow with a murky hue and a lot of grain. Pours with a lot of head, but has a great smell of fruit to it. The taste is very sweet with little after taste. A very simple but great tasting beer. I would suggest this beer as an after dinner drink. Cheers."
"the CPJ"
"Golden color beer with a nice foamy white head (massive) and it sticks like crazy to the glass. Wow, good looking beer. Aroma is so good. Exotic fruits with some bananas (yeast presence). Awesome aroma. Taste is fruity. It taste lightly of apples and citrus. Very good. Warms due to the high alcohol level. Drinkability is high for this beer even though it is 8% ABV. A nice tripel."
"Overall an absolutely tasty Trappist Ale that lets the fruit and malts blend together ever so perfectly. It is as I would call it, “a very nice relaxing sipper""."
"Excellent example of a tripel. Tasty and refreshing. Alcohol is well disguised."
"D: I don't usually drink this style but Chimay was good. It was very easy to drink. The 8% Abv is completely hidden."
"Gorgeous pour with enormous rocky white head, hazy peach colored body, and just overall very enticing. Nose has a rusty bready quality, with some peach pit, and clove notes with a pleasant mustiness. Dry on the palate with some soft wheat like maltiness, bready qualities, and a bit of alcohol warmth."
"D- drinkable and delicious lots of flavor it drinks like hefe to me ...it is pricey so i dont buy it to often"
"Overall, my least favorite of the three easily available Chimay brews, but I still love it."
"D: A sipper from the strength. This is a beer for those that like the lingering taste of bitterness in their beer. It's just not my favorite."
"Drinkability - I probably wouldn't go out of my way to pick up another one of these, and I think they're overpriced and overrated. However, I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"Very solid offering here that I would have no issues with enjoying again. I would love to get another bottle as it really seems to have some legs."
"Lovely golden color with nice white lacing. Smells of hop and belgian yeast with some malt backbone. Ample carbonation. Tastes of hop yeast malt and orange. Drinkability is high and the mouthfeel high as well very nice would definitly revisit. Solid example of a triple."
"I am a big fan of Chimay across the board. I much more often drink the red and blue, but that is mostly because the white is less available and not due to any strong preference. A bit pricier than some other options in the style, but when I want a sure bet for a well and consistently crafted Abbey ale, this would be my choice."
"drinkability; pretty nice, the alcohol is present but in a therapeutic way, indulge."
"The alcohol is a little present, but this pour is still very drinkable. Another great belgian."
"Pours a hazy amber with a two-finger cloudy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smells of pears, apples and Belgian yeast. A bit of bitter hops to start the flavor profile, followed by the Belgian spices, before tailing off to a sweeter pear/apple finish. Highly carbonated. Crisp, tingling mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is high. Overall this is delicious and it is very enjoyable to drink. An excellent Tripel."
"Oh, those crazy Belgian monks."
"A classic to be enjoyed those who want to experience as close to a perfect bottle of beer as humanly possible. I am starting to think the Monks had some Devine inspiration with the recipe."
"M - Bubbly, tickles the mouth, lots of carbonation."
"D: I would probably try a new triple over this but would buy this again if there were no other triples or if the set with the glassware were available."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Black Dog in Urbana, IL."
"Chimay white is a beer drinkers beer. Great feeling when that glass hits my hand. The taste is full yet not to filling. Glad to see such a classy beer in so many bars. I feel that not enough people treat themselves to a nice beer. If Chimay is the only one next to a Miller Light or Coors Light, I will gladly choose Chimay."
"Drinkability is solid. I could sip on this all day"
"Chimay Triple was orange in color and very cloudy. It had a nice creamy white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was yeast aromas, fruit, and peppery spices. The taste was spice, yeast, candi sugar, and a little fruit with some noticeable alcohol. The finish was dry and warming. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and high carbonation that mellows as the beer warms. Drinkability was good as well. This is a well made Tripel and worth trying out."
"D: It's a tasty beer and the 8.0% doesn't jump out at you in the taste at all. It makes it a drinkable beer. Obviously it's not a beer you want to session, but it goes down fairly easy."
"The chalice is pretty cool though."
"D: A really drinkable beer, perhaps my favorite of the Chimays."
"Overall this beer is fantastic. Unfortunately, it isn´t sitting very well so it suffers on the drinkability scale. Someone with stronger stomach might be able to handle more than one of these. And the 8% ABV really creeps up on you. Definitely worth a taste!"
"This one will sneak up on you. The alcohol was very well hidden and it drinks very easily, but the alcohol is definitely there."
"Pretty easy and straightforward for drinkability. Although for drinkability I would prefer something much bolder in taste and bouquet."
"nothing bad to say about this beer. I have drank it alot before and unfortunately the wow factor is gone by now. but still an amazing beverage."
"D- It's real tasty and the 8% is nowhere to been seen. A classic delicious brew thats always worth coming back to."
"This is one of the best tripels out there. Everyone likes to focus on the Chimay Blue, and that beer rocks, but this little nugget is a worthy addition to any collection. A must try for anyone into Belgian beer."
"D - This is very drinkable but it would be nice with something to eat."
"drinkability is so so - i have had this beer many times but this is the first time from a small bottle (11.2oz) maybe i am crazy but this beer tastes better from a 750ml bottle"
"D: This is a sipper. I don't even need to drink it: I would be happy to just keep my nose in a glass of this for a while."
"Do I see myself buying this beer on a consistent basis? No, only because the price is in range as the St. Bernardus ABT 12 which I feel is a superior beer. Chimay White is definitely worth the try and is better than most beers out there, but it's not an ""elite"" beer."
"CHEERS! :)"
"Overall this was an OK Triple, I feel as if the age of this bottle may have held it back and it would be far less sour and acidic if it was fresher. I really love this style and will for sure revisit this beer to see what it's really like."
"Drinkability - A good tripel but not Chimay's best to offer worth a try but IMO very much inferior to blue and red. Maybe I'm being to harsh but the way this brew finishes just left me wanting."
"D: Expensive but not bad. I could see myself drinking this on tap at a pub even. 4"
"Overall this is a very good Tripel, but not my favorite. It is fruity, spicy, dry and strong, just as a Tripel should be."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable."
"This is a world class Trappist Belgian ale which I would drink it all night, if I could afford to."
"Mouthfeel is medium in the beginning but finishes dry which helps cut down on perceived sweetness. Drinkability is pretty high as I'm really enjoying this beer. A classic solid example of a tripel."
"D- Overall, Chimay White is a solid Tripel that is worth trying. "
"White comes out gold and with a tint of hazy yellow and a nice creamy white head about an inch up. Nice streaks of lace here and there. Smell is fruity, esters, pear, grape, belgian yeast, bread,earthy hops, triple. This might be one of the better trips I've had in a while. Everything comes through. Fruit is up front followed by the yeast bringing on to a dry and refreshing finish of both. This one pulls no punches, it's a triple in every sense of the word. Body is bold and a big medium. Not thin or watery feeling like alot of american versions. Alcohol comes out a bit and warms things up a bit. Highly carbed, highly good. I highly recommend this one."
"I'd consider this beer dangerously drinkable. It doesn't taste like an 8% beer, and the bright tangy quality allows it to be quaffed with ease. Overall I am very satisfied with my first ever authentic trappist ale. Highly recommended for any beer lover."
"This is a quite tasty, yet charmingly simple, very drinkable ale whose number I'll always keep listed for cheap thrills and Belgian booty calls."
"I haven't had very many examples of this style, but this would be the smoothest and most well balanced example I have had thus far."
"Its` smell has belgian yeast, peach, some hops, candy. Taste has more fruit, some apple, malts, some caramel. MF is creamy with solid carbonation. Drinkability is very good for this tripel. This offering from Chimay has long been one of my favorite Belgians."
"Murky, golden-orange, with a cloudy appearance. Strands of sparkling carbs making their way up to the top, making for a nice white head with a lasting presence, although little lacing occurred. Aromas of vanilla, citrus, yeast, with a slight grassy/hay presence as well. Taste was creamy and smooth with a nice, sparkling mouthfeel. This brew featured natural yeasty characteristics, and a nice mellow hop bitterness with a citrusy aftertaste. Dry and biscuity with no alcohol noticeable. Overall, a solid, well balanced Tripel. No complaints here.."
"Not overly impressed with this one. It is not the best tripel I have had, but is still a pretty good beer."
"D: A decent beer, but not my favorite offering from Chimay. Still, this is enjoyable and worth buying."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the funky aspects of the taste. While it looked fantastic, with insane gripping lace, and had a traditional aroma, there was an inclusion of bitter citrus. This could have come in portion, from the hops, but it is different, and more bitterly fruity than hoppy. While many triples will have hints of orange or lemon, this brew took it to a whole new level, with an interesting bitterness that actually helped make the beer more drinkable, rather than what could have been overly sweet and bready."
"Very well balanced and a tasty tripel"
"D: Very nice. Big mallty flavors, and very smooth. Not too boozy."
"O- This is in my top 3 of tripels. It's a juggernaut of a beer and is my favorite offering from Chimay. The beer keeps getting better as it warms. Really the kind of thing that you get disappointed when you realize it's gone. I definitely visit this beer at least once a week if I can."
"Drinkabilty - I sipped this one and at first though it was too weak, then after warming up some the flavors, still light, came out and i really enjoyed this. Doesnt seem to be 8% either. I still like la fin du monde better but this is easy to drink. May have gotten a 5 if it wasnt 8%"
"Drinkabilty - not overpowering , light crisp and clean , well balanced and blended brew - very drinkable."
"Poured into a Chimay Chalice. The beer pours a cloudy/hazy golden straw color. It has a soft fluffy off-white head with excellent retention. The nose of the beer is sweet and fruity with floral hops in the background. There are pineapples and some banana upfront with a mild bready/buiscuity middle. Then the nose fades to a spicy clove finish. Taste is sweet and has a dominant clove spiciness. Again there is a yeasty bready character in the middle. It then goes into a clean hops finish. The mouthfeel on this beer is excellent. Well carbonated but very smooth and creamy. It sits very well on the palate. This is some good stuff right here. Very enjoyable. I wish i had more than one bottle. Good thing they sell 750s of this stuff at my local supermarket."
"D: An enjoyable tripel for sure, great balance and harmony of flavor components. Didn't really expect less from Chimay. Solid beer."
"Mouthfeel is okay, but a bit over carbonated for my taste, and fairly dry. I prefer the larger bottles. Readily available, nice to know you can depend on this Trappist ale."
"D-Incredibly drinkable, although it has a high abv, it's quite easy to throw these back, a fantastic brew everyone should try"
"M/D: Very smooth, soft mouthfeel despite the high level of carbonation. Highly drinkable beer."
"Deceptively smooth for abv. could go down a little to easy."
"Fans of Belgian Tripel style beer should consider this a must-try. Chmiay White is one of the best."
"The mouthfeel is active, very well carbonated. The drinkability is pretty good for one beer. It's a sipper and a great one at that."
"Overall a really good looking glass of beer. I wish the taste and mouthfeel were a little more to my liking. I will try it again in a few months to see if I have a different opinion. I would like to try the other colors (blue & red)."
"D: Tasty. Not too strong or overpowering for a tripel. Highly drinkable."
"D: Very easy drinking triple. Very flavorful yet not over the top complex"
"Glorious golden orange emerges in my glass, with three fingers of billowing white head. Tons of suspended yeast here make it opaque, chunky lace and the carbonation is evident from looks alone. Nose is of banana, pear, light spice. Taste follows, tons of fruit, banana again, pear, green apple. Finish is super dry and yeasty. High carbonation and a good body. Great drink for the ABV, if not somewhat restricted by how uncomfortably parched the palate is left after each sip. I'd still take La Fin du Monde over this."
"I get more then twice the triple when I grab a 750ml bottle of La Fin Du Monde, I like this beer but it's hard buy when it's beside LFDM on the shelf"
"poured into a chimay goblet received in the gift pack. very bubbly and orange with a nice sized head that subsides quickly . typical smell of belgian tripel yeasts. slightly bitter in the taste with the flavor of the yeast. the taste of hops is surprisingly present in this if only ever so tiny. slight aftertaste lingers on the tongue despite the thin mouthfeel. Not my favorite tripel or chimay offering, but solid nonetheless."
"Very nice in the holiday season."
"D: it drank good but not great . Its still a very good tripel beer and has been a beer that has gotten me into craft brews; thanks monks"
"This beer actually has pretty high drinkability. Once it has warmed a little and once it's actually in the mouth, the Chimay Tripel is a very easy to drink Belgian. Overall, this beer is ok, probably a little over-hyped, and I still belive the Grand Reserve is by far their best effort. Chimay does deliver a quality tripel with their white label."
"D: Very drinkable. This is easily one of my favorite Belgian Trippels. Yum."
"O: Great drinkable. Delicious Trappist"
"D- This is a good beer, though I feel it had been overhyped to me. I enjoyed it and would have another easily. It covers up that 8% pretty well I feel. Price is a little high compared to Tripels I felt were on same level, but price ignored, it's a good beer."
"Taste is very well balanced, it's hoppy but not bitter at all, it's a bit more earthy which is nice. There's a very nice Belgian yeastiness as too be expected along with a really thick and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden. Makes it very tasty and drinkable, super solid."
"D - Good beer. The high ABV is decently well hidden as to not detract from the beer."
"Drinkability -- This is absolutely one of the best Triples I've ever had. The fact that it just barely cracks the Top 10 of the style is surprising. Not only is this a must-try Tripel, but also a perfect introduction to the world of Belgian beers."
"A fine stand-by of the style..."
"The taste is slightly sweet with a bit of malt, banana, light fruits, and a bit of spice. There is some alcohol there as well. Medium bodied with somewhat low levels of carbonation. Drinks fairly well, but is probably my least favorite of the Chimay trio."
"This is by far one of my favorite triples. Unlike Westmalle or Tripel Karmeliet, the flavors in this beer are all distinct, robust, and most importantly, smooth. Unlike these beers, the 8% ABV of the Chimay just adds to the body instead of taking away from it, as it enhances the flavors and helps make the beer larger than life. The balance between malt and hops is exceptional, and really allows the grain to shine through. Overall, probably the best Chimay in my opinion, and well worth whatever you might pay for it."
"D - A very very good Tripel, but a notch below world class... Probably my least favorite the common Chimay offerings... There's nothing particular that I can really place my finger on, but this is just a minor let down given the lofty expectations one has for Trappist brews..."
"One of the beers that peeked my curiosity for better beer several years ago."
"Al together, this is a fantastic beer, I could drink it all the time."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite Tripel thus far. I was actually pretty surprised when I looked at the ABV; wouldn't have pegged this for an 8% ABV beer. I will definitely come back to this one!"
"D- Not my favorite of the style by any means, probably wont be drinking it again."
"D- Very drinkable. Solid tripel with excellent character and mouthfeel. Dry finish leaves you wanting more."
"Overall, a solid tripel. While nothing about it makes me go ""Hot damn!"" it is still very good and probably a required drink if you are into Belgians. Certainly worth a go! Cheers!"
"Very smooth finish, yet very crisp. I get some peppery aftertaste that lingers very well."
"I like Chimay's Brother Theodore yeast better in dubbels and quads."
"D:I can't find anything bad to say about this ale.It does down easy,has the right taste,and keeps you interested.Please send me some free samples,anybody!?"
"M: As expected it has a wonderful feel to it that only a Belgian can give. Thick and creamy with a medium weight that gives way to an extremely crisp finish. Not dry: crisp. A little graininess from the yeast if you disturbed much of it during the pour."
"The taste lasts, that makes you to drink it in a very slow way if you want to enjoy until the last minute of flavour"
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, 2 fingers of cloudy white head with nice retention - great looking pour! A nice yeasty smell, some banana, pear, spices, fresh bread, even some floral hops. Fairly sweet tasting, Belgian candy and sweet malts shine initially, but balances out nice with the fruit, hops and spiciness. Lots of carbonation and somewhat dry, but smooth. A very well balanced example of the style, as Ive found the other Chimay varieties to be."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, mouthfeel is soft and creamy. Very nice overall with slightly peppery carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer; the alcohol is well hidden."
"Despite this foaminess, I will easily finish my glass. The spices aren't overpowering and are easily consumed. This isn't my go to triple, simply because there are local Belgian style versions that I prefer, but for an authentic Trappist version, this is a great example."
"I would definitely stick this beer into the 'end of fall' category, as it almost tastes like autumn. I would drink it sitting around a bon fire, maybe cooking some fresh caught, well-buttered white bass or walleye; the smell of burning leaves and the sound of crackling wood mingling with the hazy bitter hops and yeast on the back of my tongue, bursting just as I finish the gulp."
"Overall, I enjoyed it. I'm not done looking for different tripels to try, but I can see me coming back ot this one often."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is good, the medium body isn't overly smooth but still feels good and has a little bit of a harsh edge to it that is nice. Drinkability is great for the style. It is a beer that has a great flavour and feel to it without sacrificing the desire to consume a few of them."
"Pours a apple juice color with a white head and really nice lacing. Smells of apples and malty goodness. Tastes spicy, peppery, bubblegum flavored, with apple notes. Mouthfeel is quite nice and smooth. Drinkability is good as well."
"Drinkability - Overall this is a very deep tasting and rich in flavour beer, it offers a lot to the mouth as it goes down. Overall, i would not lean to this for a ""night out"" but a good starter or finishing beer."
"Yeasty, phenolic fruitiness comes through on the nose and that certainly predominates on the palate as well (apple, pear, as well as the usuals?). There is also a slightly pine-like quality that yields to the hops, giving way to a nice dry finish. The alcohol and yeast make it slightly heavy but you can certainly a couple in a session. Very unlike other triples, much easier to drink and the alcohol is much more balanced (although it also has much lower ABV than others)."
"This is a damn solid Tripel. Its heavy use of hops for the style makes it stand out. I think this beer is better and more complex out of the bottle, but any sort of Chimay on-tap is nothing to scoff at."
"Drink: Chimay, in my opinion is a little over-hyped. The beer is good, but simple. The tripel is no different, a little bland for my taste."
"Pours a deep yellow orange color with a big frothy head that recedes quickly. Carbonation streams from the bottom of the glass. Huge vanilla, wafer, and lemon custard aroma. Has a spicy after note as well. The flavor is very astrigent with a bitter acidity. Malted flavors with vanilla undertones. Really not good. This might be infected or just not be my favorite triple. The mouthfeel is over carbonated but true to style with it's crispness. The Drinkability is just above average for me because it's just not tasty at all. Worth a try, but not worth hunting down."
"D: Chimay is always delicious and this is a perfect example why. Not like your typical Tripels, but easy to drink and wonderful flavor none the less."
"I would like to re-review this beer at some point, because I was quite disappointed with it this time. Not a good Tripel."
"Chimay white has an excellent head that lasts and a cloudy amber colour. It has a yeasty smell to it. This beer tastes very matly to me and reminds me of Leffe Blonde. It's malty from start to finish. This beer feels great in the mouth and is well carbonated. Chimay always make a high quality beer and this is no exception."
"MF/D: a faint fizzle of carbonation leads a medium bodied brew, though one is more than enough to drink at any one time."
"D- A very good Belgian drink. Easy to down and considerably light for my expectations for my first Tripel style beer."
"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this brew it is a solid. However, I find the blue and red label Chimay's to be much more enjoyable. I really have no complaints but found the overall character of the brew to be lacking something I couldn't place my finger on."
"Caramel sweetness with bright, citrus fruity hop offsets give this ale a celebratory quality that one would think appropriate for a wedding -- white dress, white cap and all."
"Liked this alot better this time than when I had it on-tap. Good stuff."
"Overall: Another point for Belgian beers. Not the best one, but definitely better than most beers."
"D-As mentioned, not as sharp as other tripels, or as dry for that matter. Makes the beer go down a tad easier. This tripel is quite delicious."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip stiffly. Nice inch+ head, that descends slowly(ish) leaving little lacing atop the somewhat cloudy orange-brown beer. The aroma begins with a touch of banana atop apple juice, but then the head descends releaseing a strong level of belgian aromas... Smells delectable and bang on to style (duh.) The taste is a little lighter than I had expected, finishes fairly dry without much malt. I was hoping for a beer that was just a tiny bit thicker... Overall though a great beer to drink and one I am glad I found."
"Poured from the bottle into my favorite large flute (I didn't have a chalice). Awesome cloudy golden liquid with long lasting inch and a half fluffy white head. Beautiful. Spicy, peppery Belgian aromas hit hard out the top of the glass. Smells delicious. Taste is equally impressive. Fruity and spicy with a great balance between hops and malt. Mouthfeel was medium and luxurious. Drinkability was a bit harsh due to the 8% but who's complaining? Certainly not me!"
"Impressive beer, and a delight. Not too sweet, well balanced, and very drinkable."
"The finish is dry and quenching with some hops coming in to help out. Fresh and lively is the feeling I get at the end of a sip - perfect for food and many cheeses. The corked bottles especially make a nice treat with dinner, but try either bottle with pastas, wild game, chicken, even pizza and pub fare. Also, you could easily set one away in the cellar for several years, most likely smoothing out some of the raw edges and uniting to become ultimately soothing."
"D-the flavor is quite good, the nose fell a little short as it was dominated by yeast and malt sweetness. a complexity not seen in many tripels and the balance that makes a beer great. this is a darn good beer!"
"Corked Bottle - Soft amber, slightly orange, hazy, with huge creamy offwhite head. Strong aroma - sweet malt, overripened fruit, and floral notes, very pleasant. Delicious flavors of creamy sweet malt, raisins, with slight, good bitter finish. Alcohol present, but not powerful, rather smooth. Well balanced (malt/hops). I really love the smell of this beer. Plus, I enjoyed every drop. Maybe I'm not with the majority, but I liked this better than the Chimay Blue and Rouge. To each his own."
"An outstanding, quality beer."
"Grabbed a glass at Trappist. Looks pretty inspiring in a Chimay glass I must confess. Great fluffy head atop a deep golden body. Nose is of coriander, some nutmeg and allspice, some citrus, and even a bit of hay. Flavors are pretty complementary. The lemon-citrus has a bit of a bigger punch on the palate though. Extremely pleasant on the palate with ample carbonation and dry on the finish. So drinkable. A solid example of style. Always easy to return to this fella."
"D- A fantastic tripel that hides the alcohol well. I can't believe I passed this over for years."
"Flavor is great! Trappistes breweries really know what they're doing...that's for sure! A small amount of hop bite comes through in this beer which is a little different from a lot of the other Belgian tripels I've had. The mixture of Belgian yeasts, crisp sweet fruits, and slight booze really make this enjoyable and stand out in it's style/catagory."
"jd"
"The taste was a bit disappointing though. The alcohol is really prevalent (yes, the ABV is high, but compare with the Fuller's Golden Pride, where it is barely noticable in the taste) and the flavour is sort of acidic. Drinkability is quite low on this one, I'll rather stick to the blue and red ones. Maybe I'm missing something here."
"This beer deserves an A, so I'm giving it one."
"I have to say (after multiple, multiple tastings) this beer surprised me, simply one of the best Tripels I've ever had, a supremely crafted beer!"
"D - Very drinkable"
"D - Complex spiciness with a slight malt note... keep 'em coming. You get to explore this beer with each sip."
"D - this is a pretty decent brew , but i'm not impressed , there are better tripels out there"
"Drinkability - Dangerously so. The old Belgian ""light body, high alcohol, delicious flavors"" trick. I fall for it every time."
"D - Good flavour - verging on a wheat beer. Easy to drink although the sourness might not be to all tastes."
"This was my dessert at the Amsterdam Ale House in NY, NY. Dull straw color; styrofoam-white head that let loose with spicy grass and butter (!). I know this thing isn't oaked but it sure smells like it. The butter is prominent in the taste, but is quickly overtaken by bitter fruitness that dries out and leaves a nice, clean sensation behind. Something to sip slowly after a turkey ruben, or anything else, for that matter, while waiting for the evening to cool off enough for a walk back to the hotel. The alcohol is very well hidden and offers no hint in the taste; I couldn't feel any effect until long after I'd drained the glass. Bravo."
"Drinkability: Probably my least favorite of the Chimay beers I have had so far. I like the spiciness and the funk, but alcohol overtakes this beer. Not a bad beer, but not blown away by this one like the other Chimays I have tried."
"D: I think I might be turning into a Belgian!"
"Overall a really tasty tripel but probably not one of my favorites. St. Bernardus or Westmalle get the nod."
"It pours wonderfully, forming a gorgeous white whipped cream head full of belgian lace. I love the herbal/medicinal smeel of the phenols. The taste is hoppy but not overpowering, with just a little bit of malt sweetness. The body is very nicely balanced and not too full. This is one of my favorite all time beers and my favotier Scourmont beer."
"I had this great brew on draft in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Creamy orange color with an abundant foamy head. Strong spice scents and mild amounts of yeast bread-like scents. Good spicey dry flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy. Pretty easy to finish and very refreshing."
"Not balanced and a bit flat, could it have been old?"
"Drinkability is very good for this octane level. Very enjoyable beer. I drank the whole bottle and could have had more!!!"
"A note on drinking the yeast: The first pour left most of the yeast behind. And this review was written on that beer. I deliberately saved the last bit and the yeast, swirled well and then poured it into the glass at the end for drinking. What I now have in the bottom of the glass is a very cloudy half inch of beer well permeated with yeast. Not surprisingly, this has changed the flavors in that much of the complexity is now hidden by the yeast. The bitterness is now forward on the palate, the fruit aroma and flavors are concealed and the beer seems simpler."
"O: A bit expensive, but for the style and alcohol, perhaps it's reasonable. We'll break out a bottle of Chimay every once in a while over cards instead of wine."
"Drinkability - Quite so. The alcohol is hidden quite well and is a great sipper. Really glad I was able to try this beer."
"Enjoyed this at M'Coul's in Greensboro, NC on tap. It's a clear golden amber color with a modest white cover and minimal signs of lace. The aroma brings on a malt and bready grass hop blend. Pretty typical Belgian tripel with a tasteful clove overtone, but good. The flavor is a very mellow blend of syrupy yeast malt and citrus hop. I get some bayberry and oats, wheat germ and vague peach. More complex than I picked up with my nose and very nice overall. It's medium bodied with modest carbonation that makes for a pleasant feel and a very drinkable Belgian despite the ABV."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with tons of sediment particles suspended in the liquid. Huge head even with a careful pour. Aroma is fruity and full of yeast along with some spice. Taste is fruity with a slight sourness in the background. A nice amount of spiciness. Finish is dry. Not my favorite Tripel, but its not bad."
"D: One of my favourites. A beer perfect for special occasions, or just the rare night when you really want to treat yourself. I can polish off a 750mL bottle by myself without any regrets."
"Just a damn good beer, not much more value I can add here."
"Poured into my ale goblet with a rush of carbonation and a sweet, fruity aroma. Very appealing and attractive! The cloudy, golden appearance shows plenty of yeasty sediment, too, and the first taste is a rich and spicy flavor, followed by a slight alcohol presence. Coriander, clove, and candy sugar also come through in this complex and perfectly-done Belgian abbey ale. The hoppy ""rolling"" finish is just icing on the cake. Absolutely a beautiful and delicious beer!"
"Overall, its great this is a defining style beer that every one tries to copy but most cant"
"mouthfeel is creamy, the head never dies, sweet balanced by bitter, very easy to drink overall - a great tripel!"
"Tastes well-balanced, malty but the malts are lighter, bready and fruity. As a counter, this has a nice bite from the mouth that continues through the taste. The alcohol is prominent but in a warming, non-offensive way--like in a good brandy, for example. This is a classic and I find the Chimay White to be underrated compared to its brothers."
"D- Very enjoyable very drinkable but definitely a sipping beer to enjoy the complexity of the senses"
"SERVING TYPE: BOTTLE"
"D: It's quite different compared to other tripels given the bitterness but it's still a wonderful beer to sip."
"Excellent beer and one that I would not hesitate to drink again."
"D: At 8%, this was a slow-going sipper. I'm not sure that I'd want to bite off much more, very sweet and too bold."
"Drinkability: With a taste and mouthfeel like the the one this beer offers I could have easily swallowed the entire bottle's worth. However the amount of alcohol per bottle is the one preventative. All in all a truly wonderful brew that I'm sure will be another purchase of mine in the near future."
"The beer poured slightly cloudly, with a golden hue to it. Lively carbonation and a light mouthfeel. The beer has a fresh hop aroma and flavor, like a field of flower and spice. The raisin scent distinct to the yeast is also present and when I close my eyes I can get a taste for it as well. At 8% the alcohol is beautifully playful, present but so subtle you can underestimate it. It finishes sharply smooth. Beautiful beer."
"It didn't knock me away, but it certainly is a brilliant brew, well worth keeping on hand. Highly enjoyable."
"One of my favorites. Will always go back to when my favorite beer store has nothing new to offer."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. More spiced/herbed/hot version of a Tripel with less fruity/peachy sweetness. It's a good beer and enjoyable to drink but it isn't really my favorite Tripel. It's a tasty beer, and I would have it again, but I don't know if I would ever crave it, or really feel the need to drink another. Definitely worth trying though, just didn't wow me and wasn't my favorite interpretation of the style."
"This is as close to drinking a loaf of bread as you can get. Such a great yeasty flavor with an interesting bitterness and there's virtually no taste of alcohol present. Just don't drink this on a full stomach!"
"D: A little too bitter for me to rate this very high. But the beer is so well made that it is such a pleasure to drink, and from top to bottom, is probably the most consistent tripel I've had."
"Quite drinkable, but not in my top tier of tripels."
"Taste if very earthy, big yeast bite and a bit much of the alcohol is present. Feel is very warm and does finish dry. Great drinkability on this."
"Bottle started to gush foam as I opened, but I was ready for this bastard with a glass in hand. Pours a golden hazy yellow. Tastes of malty dark fruits with a spicy sweet lingerness in the finish. It drinks pretty smooth for the 8% and its a pretty solid tripel overall. Right on par with the Red and Blue from Chimay."
"A world classic that I had never gotten around to reviewing. The beer pours a hazy light copper color with a white head. The aroma is orange citrus with some pepper and Belgian yeast. The flavor is citrus fruit with quite a few spices and Belgian yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A classic example of the style that never disappoints."
"Price = $7.99 at Witherspoon Grill"
"The taste is very dry and bubbly, almost like a champagne kick. There is a definite bitter bite to the beer, but it is very refreshing. I can also taste a hint of fruit which I guess comes from the yeast. The 8% ABV is hidden well in this beer. This is definitely one to enjoy and I'm looking forward to trying the red and blue labels."
"Fairly sweet tripel with lots of belgian candi sugar flavors and alcohol. Some mineral notes are in here and lend a mild chalky component. There is just enough hops (I am guessing saaz) to make their presence known. Very full and creamy body with enough prickly carbonation. So fluffy in the mouth, it is like drinking a cloud. This is a damn good tripel but not quite up there with the best of 'em, although the more I drink of it and the warmer it gets the more I like it. I could use a bit more hops on the finish and a little better hiding of the ABV. Requisite drinking for any beer geek!"
"Overall, a quality beer that I appreciate paired well with the right foods. As far as sipping by itself, I usually prefer tripels that are sweeter than this one."
"D: A drinkable and upper-tier tripel -- I enjoyed this much more on revisiting 3-year old bottle (6/2010 on cork) three years later than original review (5/2010). Who says tripels can't improve with aging!"
"I've had this from the 750 ml bottle, on-tap, and the 11.2 oz bottle (which this review is based on). I've came to the conclusion that the bottle conditioning is far superior and does wonders in the small 11.2 oz. This may just be my imagination, but I don't think so. Too bad the only establishment in my area that sells this size is in the next town over. I'll still drive to get it."
"drinkability - excellent fruit notes, good body, enjoyable"
"D: Excellent."
"Drinkability: A kick ass Tripel. I like them on the bitter and dry side, and this one more than delivers."
" I was sad to take the last sip."
"Overall, it's a textbook Belgian Tripel, though not the best of the Abbey ales. It helps that it tends to be the most available and least pricey of the bunch, too. It's a good beer that, were the aromas a little more pronounced, would be an all-time great."
"M, D- Impeccably balanced with full, round flavors. Seductive and alluring, easily drinkable. This is a delicious Tripel on tap, so don't miss the opportunity if you have it."
"Chimay Triple pours a cloudy gold with a fluffy white head that fades quickly to a thin layer. The aroma is strongly bready and yeasty upfront. That gives way to sweet fruity malt and some nice phenolic character. The flavor is both dry and sweet, sharp and smooth and almost tart in the finish. Tons of fruity esters and powdery yeast come through followed by a nice dose of herbal, earthy hops and a healthy bitterness. The hop character is quick a bit stronger than I expected, but I really think it works well in the beer. The alcohol is fairly well hidden. I often look past this beer because it seems quite common, but I think I should pick it up more."
"Big hop presence for a triple. Lots of sour lemon and nutmeg up-front. Medium bodied with a surprisingly crisp mouth feel. Alcohol is very apparent but does not dramatically effect drinkability. Somewhat spicy and grainy toward the end then finishes clean, like a dry gin martini."
"Drinkability - I've never had a triple before so I can't really review within the context of this style, but this is a good beer. Its a bit strong for what you get taste wise though, in my opinion. It is sweet, fairly bitter, and alcoholic all at the same time. I like the red a lot better."
"It's been a while since I did a vertical tasting of Chimay. I broke down, got a really good deal at Whole Foods, white, red, and blue label with a Chimay glass for $16, how can you go wrong? I poured the bottle into the Chimay glass, it looks classic 1""+ white head filled the glass perfectly, the beer is cloudy straw colored. The nose had that beautiful Belgian yeastiness with banana, clover, citrus, coriander. The taste is everything the nose promises with a good carbonation balance, very crisp and light. The mouthfeel is outstanding. This beer is all about balance, not overly sweet or sour. On an unseasonably warm spring day, I could drink plenty of these. This was one of the first truly world class beers I ever had, well before my 21st birthday. It has been a while since I last had one, and I am surprised this may be more pleasing to my palette now than it was when I was a novice to the beer world."
"D: A true gem of a triple ale. So well rounded and delicious to drink. I tried to sip it and then I just wanted more and more. It is a must try!"
"Overall: I'd recommend giving this a shot if you've never tried it before. It's not something I'd seek out, but wouldn't object to trying again in the future."
"Pours a lovely copper tinged gold with a white head that is more rolling hills than rocky peaks. Head retention is decent, but not much lace to speak of, even in my spotlessly clean goblet. Aroma is spicy and tangy with plenty of character. Less clove than other triples, I get a lot of pepper and coriander off of this, and some fruity sourness as well. Flavor is wonderfully complex and well balanced. Plenty of coriander and white pepper with some grainy yet pleasant astringency. Also picking up some floral hops, a wonderful fruitiness and just a touch of alcoholic warmth. The warmer this get's, the more sweet and fruity it becomes with apple and pear notes. Yum. This beer is quite dry with a medium body. The carbonation is a bit spiky, but it works with the dryness to leave a wonderful, quenching finish behind after every tasty sip. I find this to be quite drinkable for a triple. This was the first beer I had at the back bar at Monk's, and drinking it is like taking a trip down memory lane. I promise though, no bonus points for nostalgia. Well, maybe just a few..."
"Overall Impression: A unique, yet Classic Belgian Tripel. Not my favorite, but it is still a very special ale! Add it to your ""Must Try"" list"
"A fine tripel that reminds me of the Westmalle but isn't quite as balanced due to the slight hike in hops. Still an extremely enjoyable brew well worth its price tag."
"Drinkability - this is a sipper at 8%, but it is going down rather smooth."
"the red or blue."
"D-Utterly satisfying. I want to drink it on a more regular basis but feel guilty in indulging on this fine beer too often."
"D: Very good Triple, but I've had better. Not too much alcohol but the bitterness and carbonation wouldn't allow too many of these in a sitting."
"drinkability is of course very high - amazingly smooth and goes down easily - i just love the style, and this is a great example of it, not the best but still absolutely terrific!"
"D- This is a filling beer, the carbonation kind of makes you feel bloated. It is also pretty strong as the alcohol sneaks up on you. It makes drinking more than one or two dangerous, in a good way of course :)"
"A beer that is much better on draught to me. It just doesn't feel the same out of the bottle - which could be a freshness issue."
"While this isn't my favourite tripel, it is the tripel that I judge all others against due to having ready access to this in Ontario."
"This is pretty drinkable, could drink a lot of it. Pretty good beer, but I've had better tripels."
"This was a pretty good beer, there was good flavor and it was very easy to drink for 8% ABV. Though, I though it was a bit pricey."
"Wow. Of the three offerings from Chimay, this is the one I have had the least exposure to before writing these notes, never has it been this fresh. This is a great beer, solid all around."
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a definite plus, but the lack of complexity and bitter bubble gum flavour is really making this a one-glass beer for me right now. I will try to find a fresher bottle to re-review in the future, (and will definitely seek out a 750) but first impressions are not doing too much for me right now"
"Pretty good mouthfeel soft and smooth. A very drinkable beer."
"Pours a opaque cider color with a nice thick foamy beige head. Aroma is a mix of sweet earthy malts and spices. Taste was a mix of sweet malts, some alcohol, and a mild bitterness. Good thickness, decent carbonation. As a beer, very drinkable. HOwever, it's a bit pricey and would probably only buy it sparingly."
"D - The draft version is definitely not as good as the 750ml bottle. But it is damn good."
"Poured into Chimay chalice... Has a nice hazy orange appearance with a slight, creamy white head. Lots of carbo bubbles dancing around the glass. Aroma is of earthy yeast with a bit of spiciness. Taste is initially tart / zingy with a bready / grainy interlude - light hop bitterness follows to close up the crispy finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and lively from the high carbonation - finish is just so crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable -"
"Amber. Moss rich and fruity. Also fruity flavors including orange Curacao and some spices. Taste a little acid but generally fruity, firm body and post-bitter taste and dry, spurred by a touch of pleasant liquor. This beer is reminiscent of Orval but less complex and refreshing. However, it has a convincing bitterness, a hopping well proportioned and well balanced."
"The aroma is a sweet grain and bubbly dry Spring aroma. Yeasty fruits like peaches, semi-sweet melons, and ripe strawberries. Te tste mirrors the aroma a lot, but gives more depth in the palate of the beer itself. The yeasty fruits add some sweetness with the sweet, yet powdery grains. You get sweet, yeasty and grainy flavors coming together nicely. hepalate starts powdery and finishes bubbley. This is a classic example of a Tripel. Even the alcohol content is high, the beer feels light and airey on the tongue, almost like a wheat beer."
"Overall, a world standard for this style, this beer should be in your regular rotation."
"Drinkability: This beer does not showcase the alcohol leading to a beer that is more drinkable than its abv would suggest. The high carbonation is unfortunately a tiny bit too much for me and I wish the aroma was a bit stronger, but overall I really liked this beer."
"D: This is a beer that begs to be had with food to me. I wasn't super impressed until I started eating a nice cut of beef with it. Something about that really brought the flavors alive."
"A fine brew with plenty of flavour and lots going for it. The crisp, dry finish adds to this beer's drinkability."
"This is very drinkable, and isn't nearly as heavy as I expected. The only problem is you can't drink several because the abv, unfortunately."
"I like this beer as well and will try it again, ive had it on tap and in bottle. Maybe another style?"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The alcohol brings it down a bit, but the flavor is fantastic and it is definitely something I could have again."
"This is a very good tripel although it is not my favorite, nor my favorite Chimay beer. I think it's better on tap, as well. Something I'm always pleased to have in my glass."
"Drinkability: Refreshing, but more so satisfying as it's the kind of beer that makes your lips smack. Light on the stomach, and frankly dangerous given the nearly undetectable alcohol content. The only downside I can find, is the reason this beer sat in my fridge for so long, was you really need to be in the mood for something high class when you drink this."
"Slainte."
"D- Great flavor, a bit sweet and heavy for multiple rounds, but it's not out of the question."
"Slightly cloudy golden yellow color. A frothy 1 finger head which disappated slowly. A flowery aroma. The taste is crisp with an almost chalk-like flavor. The bitterness is apparent in the aftertaste. From the taste you would not guess that their is 8% alcohol. You get none of the alcohol burn from some of the big beers. The mouthfeel is very dry, slighlty overcarbonated. Each sip seems to turn to foam as it hits the palate. While this bottle may be overcarbonated, the flavors will keep me coming back for more."
"Overall: very good and satisfying Chimay. Nevertheless I missed a stronger malt presence, as I would expect from a Tripel ale."
"Mouthfeel is dry, smooth and creamy, light and full at the same time. Very nice drinkability, with the flavor begging you to drink more and the mouthfeel only adding to the desire. Superb beer from top to bottom."
"Drinkability is good. I like this better then the Chimay red. I probably wouldn't drink this too much. It's a tasty beer and well made but the flavor profile is not something i like on a regular basis. It is a good beer though and i would recommend it."
"Some beers that carry the Trappist hexagon make you wonder if just any group of silly men in robes can start making beer. This is not one of them. One of the six oldest Trappist monasteries still producing today, the Abbaye Nore Dame de Scourmont is one of the reasons that hexagon on the side of the bottle is associated with greatness. A fantastically unfettered tripel. Best enjoyed from a 750ml and company. Enjoy."
"Overall, a good Tripel with a strong hop presence. Nicely balanced, but perhaps a bit too light and drinkable overall. The flavors never hit the high notes as well as they should."
"D - Drinks very easily, provided you're into Belgian beers. I'm not certain I'd down a 750ml bottle at ease, but one or two small bottles are definitely not a problem to drink, for such a complex and full-flavoured beer!"
"I would like to have Chimay White selectively - as I would a prized White Wine or the like. I would recommend this as an excellent aperitif or as a great accompaniment to fish."
"Overall a world classic example of a fantastic style. A bit on the sweeter side, (let's say, campared to a Westmalle) but delectable and dangerous. What else would you expect from a bunch of lucky monks? I've tried this ale many a years, but this is my first formal review. Tastes just a good as it did 10+ years ago."
"D-4.5 Just think - all the money you spend on it goes to a good cause, it doesn't get any better than that my brother...."
"d- i'm not nuts over belgians, but this beer is enjoyable - i'd drink it again for sure - i've got a corked and caged bottle in the cellar to see how this does with some age on it. tripels aren't my favorite style, but changing it up with one every once in awhile is nice."
"This is incredibly drinkable. I'm drinking a 330ml right now but will definitely be seeking out the big corked bottle of this one. This would be such a great summer beer. Lots of flavour and smooth as hell."
"I love Chimay. But the Chimay blue is by far my favorite of the three. Even so, all three are incredible and blow away most other beers you could try. THis is lighter than the other two and is very refreshing, but as with all the Chimays you need to watch out because they all are very drinkable but have a high ABV. THat could get you in trouble. If you have not tried these incredible beers, do!"
"Drinkability was very good."
"Mouthfeel - Very smooth! Carbonation is just right. Could drink a lot of these if it wasn't for the high abv."
"Readily available here in Aus (which is a bloody good thing!)"
"I could drink a ton of these if they weren't so high in alcohol and un-cheap."
"D- Drink-ability is 100%, not the best tasting Triple Ive had, but just as easy to drink as any. Well balanced, nothing assaults the tongue."
"This is an almost perfect beer. I haven't had a ton of tripels, but this is both my favorite in the style so far and my favorite of the three Chimay beers. I will certainly get this again."
"Drinkability is great. There's nothing here to beat your taste buds into oblivion. Just a great drinkable brew."
"This is a great tripel that I enjoy every chance I see it on tap, very drinkable, despite its high ABV"
"D: I think I'll stick to Chimay's other styles over this one. There are just too many other tripels that are superior to this entry."
"T/M - Full bodied, mid-low carbonation, silky, nice bitterness, a little spiciness to match the smell, subtle alcohol warming, mmm mmm mmm"
"Chimay White hasn't really changed my view of Tripels. I can appreciate them, but don't love them. Having said that, this is a good one. The Belgian yeast presence, alone, is enough to carry it very far. The spicy side is a tad overdone. Drinkability and, to a lesser extent, the overall flavor take a hit. Nonetheless, it's a classic Tripel that warrants your attention."
"D-- Alcohol is well hidden but becomes more obvious once it warms up. At the same token it loses a lot of the good things about it once it gets warm. Probably the weakest of the Chimay line of beers and compared to other tripels like La Fin Du Monde or to St. Bernardus it would be easily be 3rd. Would I get again?? Yes but one at a time is enough."
"D - very nice and drinkable, although alcohol would prevent multiples in a sitting. Definately will drink again"
"Drinkabilty is fine enough, and I had no problem finishing a bomber by myself in one sitting. To be honest, it was made more enjoyable with a couple nice cheeses I had with it. A cranberry-infused goat cheese was the star pairing with it, as were pieces of fig cake and mixed nuts. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on some items like these to have with it - it only heightens the enjoyment."
"Drinkability: The Chimay line-up keeps getting better for me. This is a great beer and one that I will certainly be having again."
"Drinability: This beer has a high degree of drinkability. All the flavors and aromas do a fine job of hiding the alcohol."
"D - This is a good beer. The ABV makes it such that it's only responsible to have 2, but I have to imagine this is as good as Tripels come."
"Chimay Tripel (White) was served in the proper Chimay branded glass. It appeared golden yellow with a white head. There seems to be quite a bit of clove in the aroma. The flavor also has quite a bit of clove which backs off a bit as it warms with more fruit like flavors becoming apparent. I don't remember the bottled version seeming to have this much clove flavor, I'll have to try one again to see if it does."
"Value: Let's face it, there are better beers out there for the money."
"Effervescent ,mostly clear honeyish golden-orange fluid topped with rich white head that retreats until a firm thick lacy coating is left. The scent is a composite of peppery phenolics, aromas of peach /apricot, refined sugar and quite evident spicy alcohol. Somewhat yeasty with peppery phenolics and flavors of peach /apricott incorporated into the malty body balanced by some hops and subdued spicy alcohol. High carbonation is leading into dry finish with prominent bitter aftertaste that seemingly lasts forever. Although the beer seems hoppier in character than most trappist ales, hoppiness is quite shy until the aftertaste phase when reveals itself as an everlasting bitterness. This beer is a shirk which escapes my attempts to evaluate it: aromas and flavors are somehow hard to take hold of. The apparent absence of citrusy esters so typical of a triple and the pronounced dryness remind me more of a golden strong ale than a triple. Sharp-edged,prickly on the palate and rather dry Chimay White is my least favorite of the three brothers."
"D- It's a great example of the style. Nothing is dumbed/watered down. I'm not gonna' drink more than 1 in a sitting, but I'd definitely drink it again. It's hard to knock a beer in this style for being full flavored. Late in the beer I paired it with a slice of gouda, which went quite nicely."
"This is a very solid tripel."
"Overall- My favorite Chimay beer. Delicious and now 1 of my favorite Tripel's."
"D: This is a brew that should be sipped and enjoyed, but can also be enoyed three or four glasses deep. It just depends on the serving type. A local bar served this one up on tap, and it's so much better in that form. I could have three or four in that form without blinking an eye."
"I suggest drinking this with a light meal, maybe fish or a salad. Any food that is strong will overpower this beer too quickly."
"A very flavorful, complex and drinkable beer. An all around great Belgian beer."
"Very drinkable...you can throw back a few of these without any problem!"
"Excellent brew. Drinkability is superb. Although I prefer it from the bottle, it's still one of the best tripels around, regardless of serving type."
"From a gift pack poured into Chimay chalice that was provided. Hazy light amber color with golden highlights and a creamy thich head that hangs around and laced the entire inside of the glass. Great floral and fruit aroma with a hint of spice. I enjoyed the taste even more, great flowery and fruity taste with just the right amount of spice and I think this hides the flavor of alcohol very well. A joy to drink. I usually lean towards a dubble over a triple but in this case I liked this one better."
"Beer is oddly bitter in the front and back of the mouth. Bready and medium bodied, there is a slight aftertaste. Nice sweet fruit flavors in the midpalate. Beer seems a little dry, time for the second sip. I get the bitterness again. Its not a bad taste, in fact I like the taste of the beer. It negatively impacts drinkability and mouthfeel though. Its like an interuption when i'm drinking. Overall a good beer."
"Drinkability is very good. Smooth, tasty, and dangerous."
"This has never been my favorite of the Chimay brews and some of the floral notes can be overpowering at times. Yet, after what must be 30 tries, I think I finally get what they're going for and all the flavors are well-balanced."
"This one seems to have a blonde ale quality to it as well as a bit of sweetness. It reminded me of a sweeter Leffe. Poured to a dark golden color, with a head that coats the glass. The sediment kind of sticks to the sides. It is slightly bitter but the sweetness is more powerful. No alcoholic taste which makes this one a keeper."
"D: A pretty good Tripel from a very respectable brewery. Not my favorite Chimay offering, but good nonetheless."
"I have not had the Chimay white in many years so I ordered one on tap at a local mexican restaurant. Cloudy orange as I remembered with a spicy smell. The flavor was strong bubblegum, hops, really robust with a bit of spice towards the finish. Nice soft mouthfeel and easy to drink. The strength of the flavor was easily the best part about this tripel, nice but I still think the dubbel is their best beer."
"D: All around a great beer and the best tripel I have tried so far. My only complaint is that the alcohol isn't well hidden compared to others. Tastes and smells great though. Another great chimay beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass it produces a big head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is light amber-ish and cloudy. The aroma is of cloves and malt. The taste is similar with a little bitterness. The feel is medium bodied with a bit of a bitter finish. OMG I can't believe I drank the whole bottle in one sitting. Now I'm wasted. But it was nice."
"Nice fine champagne like carbonation adds the the experience. Certainly a nice tripple."
"I poured this from a 22oz bottle labeled L08-446 on the lot number. It poured a cloudy, dark-gold color (maybe a light copper). It poured with a large, white head, and had a sour smell with a hop background. The taste had more hops than I expected. This is a very approachable tripel that reminds me of a Belgian IPA, only milder. Light body with good carbonation. It is a good quality tripel that I will be keeping stocked."
"D- I haven't had a lot of triples, but I really enjoy this beer a lot. I'm definitely going to be looking for more from this style (hopefully they'll be as good as this one)."
"D: Very drinkable. Warmer with light meat pairing is delicious."
"This is a very drinkable tripel again another Belgian tripel tasted and another score in my book. One of the very best."
"Nice tripel, but a little weak in the alcohol department, which is noticed. I quite prefer the tripel to be at 9 or above, otherwise the candy is too strong for me. It's still a good brew, though."
"D- High. I'll be buying this again. I really enjoyed the ease of drinkability and the strong lilac/honeysuckle flavors. The mouthfeel is divine. Give me more!"
"Another great brew from Chimay. All 3 (Red, Blue and White) are a must try."
"The tatse and smell is floral hops with some crisp bitterness and slight breadiness almost as if from wheat but there is little complexity and depth. Fruity notes are entirely absent and the mouthfeel is a bit well not stale but not as good as others..."
"A light malty aroma rises out of this hazy blonde brew. Topped with a thin lacy white head. Light malty flavors with some tartness. Well balanced but no hop presence is noticeable. The body is light with low levels of carbonation. Finishes with a tart malty sweetness and fades relatively quickly."
"good stuff but i couldn't drink too many."
"The taste delivers on the aromas and finishes with medium citric bitterness in the aftertaste. For all the malt, it doesn't taste or feel too sweet. Smooth and creamy good to start and then turns crisp since it's actually a bit dry in the finish with the bitterness."
"I sometimes get tired of Chimay being the representative Trappist at most places, but I gotta catch myself & think ""Am I seriously going to begrudge a place for serving a great beer?"""
"D - this is a pretty decent brew by the monks. This is very similar to other triples I have had, minus the weird orange peel taste on the finish. I think I like the Red better than the White, but I have yet to try the Blue."
"Despite a slow, deliberate pour, a very thick, foamy head develops on top of the dense orange colored ale. The aroma is quite inviting, with notes of banana, yeast, and spice. The flavor is largely a continuation of the aroma, with a dry fruity sweetness and spicy overtones. This flavor is somewhat hidden by the high amount of effervescence, but this feature also hides the flavor of 8% alcohol. Overall, though, this is a very good, very drinkable tripel."
"*Originally reviewed on October 3, 2009."
"Highly recommend it on-tap, still would recommend it in a bottle. Not as enjoyable as its brother Chimay Blue, but still very good."
"Overall, a nice, complex easy drinking beer. It actually made me appreciate that much more Unibroue's version of the tripel, la fin du monde. 2 down and 1 to go for the Chimay's available to me. Leaves me looking forward to the red cap."
"Into a goblet, poured a hazy yellow/gold, with two fingers of bright white head, and very good lacing. The smell was a bouquet of clove, coriander, banana, lemon zest, orange peel, hay, and yeastiness. The taste was a tiny bit more subdued than the nose, with the fruit hitting hard first, then dissolving to yeast and herbs, and then finishing on a spicy/bitter note. Very good, but I've had some better tripels. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and moderately spritzy. It could've benefitted from more carbonation, but in retrospect I was surprised that the flavor wasn't more intense given the low level of carbonation. Definitely light enough to session, but I'd look for a tripel with more intense flavor."
"D - a fine quaff indeed. chimay is one of those things in life that are everything they are made out to be. i prefer the white and the blue over the red, though. another one to sit back and enjoy with friends."
"Overall a tasty beer but I'm still gonna stick with my Fin du Monde."
"Massive taste, everything about the aroma carries over to the taste. The alcohol taste becomes stronger as the beer warmed up, but overall it was nicely balanced."
"Overall, this is another tasty offering from Chimay and I will definitely seek this out again. Recommend"
"Conclusion: Never gotten to try Chimay on tap; this was a treat. It's a little different than out of the bottle and I'd think a bit fresher than I can usually get bottled around here. The hops come through much stronger, and it's not quite as yeasty/phenolic as the bottled version. Classic, and tasty."
"Taste was pretty mellow and had a light malty feel, different tastes included burned sugar, lemon, grapefruit, oranges, grapes, raisins, and cherries, this one also had a lot of Hops which is not common of most Belgians I have tasted, sweet all the way through until the dry finish"
"D- Really nice brew. I will be picking this up again."
"Drinks well. Spicy and Belgian with lots of character."
"D- This one goes down nice and easy. Great flavor to go along with the right amount of carbonation. The ABV is a little too high for this to be a session beer but this would be good with certain meals."
"Good brew, & I'll certainly seek out the others."
"D: one per sitting, will buy more"
"Drinkability- I would have another if I had another."
"D: Wonderful Belgian ale; a shining example of the style and another Tripel that the Belgians can proudly show off."
"Poured into a chalice, appears a golden-honey color, cloudy and turbid, with a huge off-white head having little retention. Aroma was huge. Yeast and bready malt were most apparent, then caramel malt and fruit notes including banana. Very sweet with a hint of alcohol. Each swirl of the glass provided another aromatic thrill. Very inviting. Taste was very sweet and bready up front and the sweetness lingered into the finish ultimately giving way to a hint of bitterness and noticeable warming. It was almost like drinking hawaiian bread. Mouthfeel was light, but smooth and became even smoother as it warmed. High carbonation tickles the tongue. Overall, a very tasty and warming triple. Would definitely have again, but not more than one at a time as this seems to pack more of a punch than even the 8% ABV would suggest."
"Creamy body and bold alcohol contrast with fruit and yeast flavors nicely. Finishes extraordinarily well. Smooth and buttery, but has a touch of rough graininess to it."
"Overall a great brew, though nothing short of what I expect from chimay. Poured a wonderful golden orange color with a nice head slightly cloudy from a 330ml bottle.. Balanced with a wonderful citrus nose with bready undertones and a bit of belgian funk makes for a truly unique and wonderful smell. Taste is balanced as well with more of the same but with a green apple almost celery/fennel undertone. Absolutely a wonderful mouthfeel perfectly carbonated hiding its abv very well. Also this is highly drinkable minus the price which isnt as bad a the blue but also not as worth it as the blue is."
"Very good beer with a bite but not to much."
"Pale orange/amber in color. Decent head that actually lasts. Smells awesome - earthy, malty, dry, hints of orange, wet clay, dry mushrooms, and more. Crazy complex. Crazy malty. Tastes, sigh, tastes like it's all astringency. Bleh. Tastes astringently bitter. Mouth puckering. It seems to me that they should both mash out and have shorter sparges. But, hey, this terrible off-taste is typical in many Belgians. A shame, really."
"D- I could go back for another. I might go back for another if I had one, so I could try and figure out the taste a little better. I like this about the same as Chimay red, but not near as much as I love the blue. I'll have to try a few more tripels and revisit this one and try and decipher its flavors."
"It is very drinkable for the alchohol content. It is a overall good beer. I just had a Unibroue La Fin Du Monde a couple of days before this. It was quite similar, but I was surprised that I preferred the Unibroue offering, just slightly though."
"D - I'll revise if needed but this is my favorite Chimay, better than red or blue. I'd like a 750 ml of this."
"d - stupendous. my favorite chimay offering."
"Medium bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. It's got some substance to it, but it's not filling. It's incredibly easy to drink, but the alcohol is deadly. Be careful."
"A 33cl bottle poured into my Chimay goblet. The tripel appears a hazed rich copper color with about two fingers of fluffy, lingering bone white foam. Nose and flavor consist of spicy, peppery yeast, tart green apples, under ripe banana, sweet caramel malt, mild hints of citrus. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation. A world class ale certainly worth seeking out."
"Pours a nice apricot color, with a two finger white head disipates quickly, with some lacing. Smells of straw and some fruitiness. Tastes just like a tripel should: grassy, with some fruity sweetness. A bit of a bitter or sour finish, but I expect that is normal of a true belgian tripel. Goes down exptremely smoothly, if you can handle the bitter finish. Great beer."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable but parts of the flavor profile hold this guy back a little bit. I acknowledge that this is totally subjective, and I look forward to revisiting this beer in future."
"Pours a dark hazy golden color with a beautiful smooth head. Smell is of apple with a nice spicy note. The taste is the same as the smell. Apple and other fruits come through with a spice backbone. A little cinnamon flavor comes through nicely in the finish. Alcohol is hardly noticeable, even at 8%. Great mouthfeel, crisp on the tongue with high carbonation. Very refreshing. This is an extremely drinkable beer. I could probably drink many of these in one session."
"drinkability: overall aan excellent tripel but there are better out there."
"D - Would definately drink more had the price been lower."
"A beer to celebrate life with."
"As expected, another good beer from Chimay."
"Good drinkability for the ABV. I'm really starting to come around on this belgian thing. This is a nice solid one and I would have this again."
"One of my favorite tripels along with Fin Du Monde, St. Bernardus, Westmalle and Stone's Sawyer's."
"Pours a clear golden, with a big white head. Smells of Belgian yeast. Taste is sweet, fuller body than most Tripels. Peppery spicyness in the middle, and a hint of tartness in the finish. There is also a touch of bitterness from the hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, drinkability is very good. A very good example of a Tripel, a must try."
"Deceivingly strong (I am not good at sipping beers) and left me feeling quite happy after two bottles. The head was so big and creamy and the taste was yeasty and fresh. Beautiful cloudy golden color with a head that lasted all the way down and stuck to the sides of my glass."
"Belgian yeast esters on the nose. Those tastes dominate on the taste as well, but they are followed by nice fruit flavor. Not from real fruit, so the best I can come up with is something like peaches. Just not a berry or dark fruit flavors."
"Overall a very complex and relatively user friendly tripel."
"D - great complicated flavors, but bitter and with very noticeable alcohol"
"D: Another fantastic tripel... I'd love to try it again, if only so I could get a proper pour, but I have no doubt I would enjoy it at least as much. A great sipping beer."
"D: What an amazing brew. I could easily enjoy many of these, the abv is incredibly well hidden. This is truly a great tripel..."
"I don't think this is a beer that I'd want to consume several of over the course of a night... It's got a pretty ""big"" air about it and you certainly want to savour it. Can't fault it for being involving and inviting sip after sip, though..."
"Strong scents of clove, some berry fruits. A creamy taste, a good amount of clove and spice with a light alcohol finish. The only thing I'd say is the carbonation was a bit too high, otherwise, fantastic."
"I'll have another..."
"D - The ABV is well hidden, and the carbonation is pleasantly mild. Still the lackluster taste and off-putting aftertaste make me uncertain whether I want to bother finishing this brew. There's nothing wrong with it - I can just think of more pleasant ways to use my liver and daily caloric intake."
"Very solid tripel. Had on tap in a Chimay chalice at a Burmese restaurant (kind of surprised to see it there). Had a golden/copper hazy appearance. Has a good balanced taste with the yeasty/fruity taste I expect from a tripel. A good beer especially as an introduction to Belgian beers I suppose. Everyone should try it at least once, if only to get an idea what a solid tripel tastes like. There's nothing bad about the beer, or unbalanced, or anything, I guess I just don't find it as interesting and complex as some of the other tripels I've encountered."
"Poured from the bottle into my lovely Chimay chalice, beer is a slightly hazy, peach-copper color with a frothy, dense two finger head. Nose is a mixture of spicy phenols, cloves, a bit peppery and some fruitiness. The taste is very similar to the nose but more potent and the alcohol is readily obvious in a solventy way. Decent flavor on the front end, but I've had much better disguised alcohol on the back end. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with a velvety, thick carbonation and dry finish. Overall, not a bad beer but I was a little dissapointed. I've had Belgians better than this that were brewed here in the good ol' USA."
"Normally not a fan of tripels but I really like this one."
"Personally, Chimay White is not my favourite tripel and the Chimay monastery doesn't make my favourite Trappist beers. That said, I like the White, as I do all of this brewery's offerings, a whole heck of a lot. Like the Blue and Red, this is a permanent stay in my cellar and a welcome addition to many dinners. You can't go wrong with a Trappist and it's awfully hard to find a bad Belgian tripel; you must try this beer."
"Hazy orange body under one finger creamy head, slow dissipation, nice lacing. Curacao orange in the nose with a complex spice aroma (juniper, coriander, ginger), minimal hop aromatic presence. Sweetish taste (not as sweet as Westmalle), but not so much candi sugar, more citrusy orange, lemony and esters, and one of the most complex spice flavor profiles I've ever encountered, with clove and coriander predominant. Very dry finish. Pretty drinkable for the ABV. Not an everyday beer, but certain one every BA should experience at least once."
"Pours a cloudy light orange with a fluffy white head that fades to a thin line of bubbles. A couple swirls and the head immediately returns. The aromas coming off of this beer are bready yeast, spice, floral hop and fruit. Initial taste is bready, malty, yeasty with some spice (coriander/cinnamon) and a sweet fruitiness. Then there is a bitterness that kicks in along with an earthy, floral hop flavor. The beer finishes rather dry with a warm alcohol and lingering bitterness from the hops and tingle from the carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy during and dry and tingly after. Lots going on, very nice. This is a great beer. I like the hop presence, but maybe not the elevated bitterness. For me the bitterness takes away some of the character introduced from the other flavors and overpowers them. Of course the bitterness does mask the high alcohol...All in all it is very delicious and well crafted."
"Drinkability: A bit heavy so you wouldn't drink these quickly. I mean you'd be mad to you'd be wasted and full. An incredible beer all round. The only other tripel I have to compare it to is la fin du monde which is more intense and overwhelming in flavor which makes it an epic brew but for some would be too much. This is more of a balanced grown up la fin du monde which makes it more of relaxed an subtle experience. I wouldn't say I prefer either over the other but they're slightly different. Chimay is more subtle and solid while la fin du monde is in your face. Chimay is more delicate. Back to drinkability though rather easy to drink for what it is, BMC, adjunct or american beer style lovers beware this beer has flavor and complexity."
"A nice trippel, not as good as the Westmalle but close. Hides the alcohol well. A must try for trippel fans."
"D: I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't buy this one - possibly if your allergic to gluten (and therefore can't enjoy malty products). Yes, gluten allergy is the only possible excuse for not buying and enjoying this fantastic beer."
"D- easy to finish and will be checking this one out more often. being available year round in every store makes this one seem less appealing to me for some reason. the benchmark for the style."
"A truly world class beer experience."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, thoroughly enjoyed it, will be drinking it again for sure"
"I enjoy this for a tripel. Something about this reminds me of Unibroue's Maudite more than other tripels. Smoother and maltier. Works well for me"
"Very solid atmosphere. Pretty good appearance, great full nose. Great full, balanced flavor. . . no chinks in the armor here. Strong alcohol taste, but not too overpowering. This is a really great quaff to sit down and savor."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well this one wasn't outstanding to me, it's not that it wasn't up to par, the appearance was outstanding however, it just wasn't drinkable, and the flavors & aromas just kind of remind me of a Wit. The alcoholic burn on this was a big turn off to me, Ive had other Chimay Ales before which hide the alcohol well, this one does not. All in all not bad, I don't think Ill be forking over another 12 bucks a bottle for it again though. Id rather stick with Chimay's Grande Reserve. Not a big fan, sorry."
"I guess I am not a big fan of the Tripel style. Although, this is probably the best one I have had to date. Nothing really stands out about this beer. Just a decent Belgian ale. I feel it needed a little more character and complexity to warrent a better score. Still recommended and worth a try."
"D - Refreshing and ABV is very well hidden."
"Not my favorite tripel but a good one and well made."
"From the 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz bottle marked L08-751. Sampled on the my 50th birthday-June 16, 2009. This was my birthday treat for myself. The pour is a copper-golden tone with a couple fingers of foamy off-white head. It is cloudy and carbonated. The aroma is a pleasing yeast, hop, and bread-like mixture well in balance. The mouthfeel is heavier, creamy, and kind of chewy. I am enticed by the slightly hopped and yeasty taste that has a faint hint of something tart or sour but just enough to make it even more appealing rather than overwhelming. A fantastic balance."
"Too much carbonation (not a big deal, just let it sit for a while). Also there's some slight astringency present."
"Drinkability: I really like this style and this is a great offering. I rate it high, but I feel kind of guilty about it because I'm sure if I did sit through a couple, I'd be feeling it pretty heavily."
"D: Pour another one!!"
"Rich mouthfeel, very smooth with just the right amount of high carbonation. Bitterness lingers lightly. Good stuff."
"So, even after warming to around room temp, the flavors seem to be staying roughly the same. It's a damn good beer, and worthy of being revered (as it is). But, for me, it's just not hitting the way I thought it would. Maybe I got my hops up a bit too high."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - well within style and fairly easy to drink."
"What more would you want?"
"The well hidden nature of"
" Chimay makes quality brews, and this beer doesn't break the mold. Buy up , drink up."
"It was good, but not my favorite tripel."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color. The head is large, billowy, and recedes slowly leaving lacing all over the glass. The aroma is of yeast, leather, citrus, lemon, and hay. The taste begins with lemon and citrus notes, and finishes with a sharp funky barnyard thing. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really good tripel that I will certainly drink again."
"In many aspects this is a straight forward beer. It is still complex in flavor when compared to a euro pilsner for example or more to the point a Belgian Tripel, however it isn't simple. Lets say its straight up the business and a damn good Tripel."
"Pours hazy golden color with plenty of carbonation and a few dark colored ""floaters"" in the glass. Smell is spicy. Taste is complex. Spicy ketones and friuty esters as expected from Belgian yeasts. Overall - smooth, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"I have to give this a very good drinkability because of the carbonation and fantastic flavor. This could come close to being my favorite tripel along with La Fin Du Monde."
"D-Suprisingly drinkable despte the high abv...scary combo."
"The drinkability is where this beer shines, there is no noticable alcohol, just nice smoothness, dangerous."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Very good. I found myself drinking it pretty quickly at first trying to put words to what I was tasting. However, I never thought it was too heavy or I was drinking it too fast. For an 8%, this is very good. I could drink this all night. At least I think I could."
"Drinkability - I've enjoyed every Chimay product available and this is no exception. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to introduce themselves to the Belgians."
"I've never been in love with Tripels but, imagining the things that attract people to this style, I can only think it's nothing short of stellar."
"D: I love Trappist brews. They can do no wrong in my eyes. This is a great ale to sit back and relax with. This is one to savor and enjoy."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thick white head that thins down to a creamy half inch one. Leaves a lot of lacing. I can smell a lot of yeasty esters, citrus, some spice? For a 8 percent beer it drinks very, very easy. A smooth creamy mouthfeel, a ton of mellow, flowery esters and a bit of citrus. I was told by a Chimay rep that it has cascade hops in it, so I can't tell if the citrus is from the American hop addition or the yeast pooping something tasty out. This is probably the easiest drinking tripel I've had, and at 8 percent its pretty dangerous."
"kind of a strange mouthfeel going on. sparkly fine carbonation with medium body. almost seems a tad watery at times, but it might be from enjoying almost all full bodied beers lately. nice dry finish. hardly any alcohol flavors detectable, easy to drink, but it definately creeps on you. definately worth a try, but the blue label is much better. never had the red."
"Drinkability: 1st class."
"While this isn't one of my favorite tripels it is a pretty good one. Now I can officially say, Chimay is my least favorite of the trappist breweries."
"D- easy for a tripel but still a sipper."
"OVERALL: A beauty of a triple. Chimay really makes some great stuff, and this is probably the best triple I've had so far. Very drinkable and very enjoyable, wholeheartedly recommended."
"D - Another great tripel that I've had the chance of sampling over the last few days. The finish is a little rough but the flavors are extremely well rounded on the front end. Still a bit too medicinal for me to love on a regular basis (as with most any tripels as far as my palate goes) but another enjoyable foray into a once-hated style."
"A pretty intense strong pale ale, with the yeast and monastery turn rendering this the standard-bearing Tripel it is. An easy, slow sipper, as the alcohol seems to gain strength over time, with a concurrent up-tick in general flavour complexity. Good and verily holy stuff."
"An unexceptional but highly drinkable trappist brewed tripel. Considering the 8% ABV, this is a surprisingly mild beer."
"This is a classic beer, one that can be easily overlooked as it has become so commonly availble - but it should not be."
"D. Not my favorite from Chimay. However this is one of my favorite Tripels."
"As it warms up I definitely get more spicy phenols, two people even sensed some tuna fish in there somewhere...my bottle says 'best before 2011', is that the year of the fish?"
"M-D- Soft on the mouth, even with the alcohol esters burning at the tongue...i love it. Very dry feel and drinkablity is excellent if you can come by more than six at a time."
"D: 8% ABV, ehh, not noticable. Good treat, not a session by any means."
"Split a 750 ml corked and caged bottle with my brother and my wife. 8% ABV. Poured into wine glasses. Big foamy white head. Great retention, lots of lacing. Cloudy, honey/straw color. Some sediment. Smells and tastes of yeast, honey, coriander. Floral. Some bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. A decently drinkable tripel - a fine example of one."
"Overall, I thought this was a great representation of the style. I am glad I got to drink this beer and I really recommend it. Even at 8% abv, I think I could easily drink another."
"D: A fine brew that went down pretty easy. Pales in comparison to a Westy 12, but good in it's own right."
"Great beer, but I like the red a little better. Now if I could only find them both on tap at the same place so I can really compare!"
"Comes out of the tap a beautiful clear golden that is quite appetizing. Aroma is subtle and gentle, fairly fruity and just a little malty. Flavor is mainly fruity, apple and banana, just a little bit sweet, with a good malty undertone. Texture is silky smooth so it goes down nicely. I have had this from a bottle, and on-tap is definitely better."
"Mouthfeel slightly sweet, a bit of dryness, petite (kleine luchtbel) carbonation, medium bodied, with a bit of bitterness that lingers on the finish."
"Smell is of malt, sweetness, and alcohol. Taste is similar with some yeast and banana flavors. Very good. Very drinkable. A bit of extra carbonation but overall very drinkable. I like it better than the red."
"I enjoyed Chimay Tripel, but when I want to reach for an outstanding tripel in the future, I think it'll be La Fin Du Monde."
"D-A very nice beer overall, but a bit of a bummer when compared to the red and blue label Chimay. This one is solid, but leaves me a bit flat."
"I enjoyed this beer very much, my first from Chimay and its getting me excited to try the red. I would like to see how this one does with some more cellar time. I'll be revisiting this one in a few years..."
"EDIT: Now that the glass has warmed somewhat I'm getting some very pleasant, chewy malt flavours coming through."
"D: Interesting. Complex. Tasty. Cheers to my first Belgian Tripel!"
"A very nice tripel, although I was hoping for a bit more in the taste department."
"I can't say enough good things about the mouthfeel of this beer. Medium bodied but creamy, with a great crisp carbonation"
"Drinkability: My favorite beer at Roxy's, along with Rogue Dead Guy Ale. I could have a few more with out getting too tipsy, but thats all and am willing too, also."
"I have to admit I expected more from this one based on how much I love the white."
"yeasty, earthy smell. Has a great unique spicy,clove taste. Similiar to the smell yet different. Date on the cork was 10/08. I wonder how the taste changes with more age. Its a great drinkible beer. Goes down smooth and dry with a yeast note left in the mouth. I am getting more of a citrus taste as it warms up a little. I will definately try some more of these."
"Drinkability- If it weren't for the price tag, this is one I'd have a lot more often."
"Pours a hazy orange yellow with a frothy white head that fades somewhat quickly. Smell is nicely strong, very yeasty, some banana smells and some sweet notes. Taste follows the smell with a strong flavor, the alcohol is apparent. The mouthfeel is not very smooth but this doesn't take away from the beer. This one is a nice drinker, great flavor, not overpowering. An inviting beer that delivers. Worth checking out."
"Dangerously easy to drink and a great offering. Chimay always hits the spot when in sesrch of a Belgian ale. Easily recommended."
"Overall: I like this one quite a bit and it's readily available if you are traveling and just want a reliable beer to enjoy. Dare I say this is more enjoyable to me than the Grande Reserve? Ultimately, I find something very pleasing about this beer. Perhaps it's that my expectations weren't as great as the Blue, but I really see this as a more enjoyable beer."
"D= Quite drinkable despite the ABV. Its been too long since I had this one and I won't let that happen again. A classic for sure!"
"D - I would have no problem drinking a few of these."
"The thing I like about Chimay beers is the overall high level of drinkability, and this one is no different. Not too rich, too sweet, or too much (except maybe in dryness)."
"Pours a beautiful bright gold that is just a little hazy. A thick frothy 1.5 inch mostly white head tops the beer. Thick, heavy lacing covers the glass like North Georgia kudzu. Smells like buttered toast with fruit and alcohol notes. First sip is mind blowing smooth that screams, ""World Class"". Creamy, malty, sweet then bitter with the yeast character you'd expect from Chimay. The 8% ABV is there but this is sessionable."
"D: Because it's definitely not overly sweet, this beer went really well with bold food. I was very impressed with how easily this 8% brew went down. I'm a huge fan."
"Much cleaner than alot of belgian triples. Tastes more like a belgian strong pale IMO. Complexity rules this beer, which seems to be a trademark of chimay. Great beer from some great brewers"
"D,this is a creamy ale thats easy to go down, nothing upsetting i can drink this often."
"Pours a very nice light golden color with plenty of yeasties in it. Smell is belgian yeast with a hint of alcohol. Taste is spicy with some more belgian yeast and a bit of funk going on. In my opinion this is the best chimay of the three. Full mouthfeel and creamy. Nice. Highly sessionable and very enjoyable. I could drink this quite often."
"D: Just a tad bit less drinkable than the Red. Could be due to more hops or less fruitiness. Although it is still very good."
"D - high. lots of flavor with little to no alcohol taste. the flavor however is slightly bitter for a tripel."
"Drinkability is high. A wonderfully complex beer with a great taste - one of the fine brews of Scourmont Trappist Monks."
"Stubby 11.2 oz brown bottle I picked up for $4.99 at a local store. Pours cloudy rich golden amber with a thick, fluffy white head. Aroma is of banana, lemon, spice and raisins. Taste is very similar with more banana and lemon with a little grainy malt and sweet fruit. Medium bodied and smooth with lively carbonation and a dry, slightly tart finish. I am not in the hadit of paying 5 bucks for a single but this one is worth every penny. A classic."
"D - This beer is pretty drinkable considering the 8% ABV. The crisp balance and clean feel making drinking a 75CL bottle a pleasure and not a chore, even at the end."
"Overall i enjoyed the beer. I can taste the alcohol in the beer, but that doesn't bother me at all."
"The beer is a dark gold blonde with a large head of mainly bigger bubbles that reduces quickly to a film on the surface that does not disappear. Biscuity notes with cinnamon are the first thing I notice, with more fruits showing up in the nose as the beer warms. Fruits upfront in the mouth, sweet and tart, with a small residual bitterness taking over at the end. The beer camouflages its 8% ABV rather nicely, you could drink three or four of these before it sneaked up on you in a bad way."
"Pours a cider amber body with one-finger head that dies real slow and left a sheath lace around the glass. Hints of pear, dark fruit, and sweet malts like caramle and gum are mixed into the aroma. A very smooth body greets the tongue, close to full-bodied, with crisp, hoppy carbonation and a malt sweetness mixed in perfectly with fruits and finishes with something akin to a dry, herbal tea finality. The ABV is tucked away b/c there's a slight alkie crisp sensation but nothing that overpowers. I could sip this as long as it is in front of me."
"Drinkability: I have to say, I was very disappointed by this beer. It looked good, but just went downhill from there. To me, it didn't smell like a tripel, tasted watery, and was difficult to drink. It wasn't necessarily bad tasting, but I was definitely underwhelmed by this beer."
"You'd never know that this was 8%. Flavors are perfectly balanced -- this is a very highly drinkable tripel. Love this stuff -- those monks know what they are doing. Haven't had this one in about a decade. While my expanding waistline won't agree with me, you gotta love what this forum does to get you to try/retry new beer. While at almost $6.00 for this little bottle, I will definitely be having this one much more often. Drink this."
"A fabulously unique and complex beer from Abbaye de Scourmont. My favorite of the Chimays."
"Overall, the prevalent alcohol may be a bit too much to have 2 of the 750 mL bottles. One size is a nice touch, and I feel pretty satisfied after finishing the bottle."
"No doubt, Cinq Cents is a damn good tripel. This bottle is fairly fresh (Sept. '08), so I'm sure that an older bottle would be a bit more mellow. That said, this is still a fantastic beer. I just wish that trappist beer didn't come at such a premium, as I've found that I generally enjoy the non-trappist options just a little bit more. It helps that they're a little easier on the wallet. Just saying."
"Crisp and refreshing with medium carbonation, this one has a mildly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol never really sets in until the very end so the 8% feels like a lot less. This is a solid offering and the most affordable Chimay so I could see myself sampling this again."
"Overall: There nice spiciness to the beer but it is kinda refined and soften by the malt. I can taste the alcohol but it is not pungent. The mouth feel is slightly carbonated and astringent. The finish is bitter and dry, giving the beer a crisp edge. The beer comes across as complex but refined. I enjoyed this beer, although, I felt that the beer was a bit rough around the edges."
"Future outlook: I will certainly pay to consume this beer again."
"Poured into a chimay glass with a foggy amber color and a strong smell of yeast and malt with a slighly fruity smell. Very full feeling in your mouth, thick and heavy but smooth. Tasty beer, easy to drink. Lasting head and leaves a residue in the glass."
"My favorite tripel to date. Very complex flavor. I noted orange, some raisin, and maybe even oak(not sure). A little too high in price for me to buy regularly($5.00 for 11 ounce). It must be good to be a monk if this is what they get to have daily! Next I'm going to try Westmalle's tripel."
"Notes: Easily my favorite of the Chimays and maybe my number one Trappist Tripel if for nothing else its availability in most finer stores."
"Notes from: 9/17/04"
"At 8.0 ABV, this is not a session ale but one to savor; however, it is such a mild, tasty treat that one could easily overdo it."
"Drinking a Duvel Tripel is like waltzing through a wheat field in the setting sun on a warm August day."
"Another great beer from Chimay (the name escapes me but I'd tried one in a blue bottle awhile ago) though my friends from the plains (Kansas and Missouri) gave me grief for ordering an upscale beer. Has a lot of flavour to it - don't make it a session beer ok? There's lager for that purpose."
"Taste is smooth, slightly rich and very pleasant. A nice level of carbonation carries through. Not over gassed as was the Grande Reserve(blue) and with much better balance. Easily the best Chimay has to offer. I hope to compare this and St. Bernardus Tripel in a head to head for the championship soon. Both exquisite"
"Drinkability: Another great Belgian classic, and all in all a wonderful beer. The aromas are perhaps not overly interesting, but the taste is so well-balanced and complex. As for the alcohol, you definitely notice it, but it fits into the overall character. Definitely worth a try... and a second round."
"Drinkability: As always with Chimay a great Trappist. However, I would find it a bit more pleasing if it were merely somewhat increased in viscosity."
"Drinkability here was ok, I dunno if I could drink a lot of these, especially considering its high ABV"
"A very drinkable choice but $$$ and alcohol content would limit my session. Great beer to have in the collection."
"Drinkability: I think I enjoyed this one a bit more out of the bottle, though I could be mistaken, as its been a long time, and my scores aren't terribly different. That said, it's still a great beer, a classic tripel, with well hidden alcohol and - even if the flavors aren't the best - the perfect balance between components."
"A very good tripel indeed. Every time I took a sip, it was as though it were the first. Intriguing from start to finish and absolutely sublime. A very interesting beer and a classic in its own right. Required drinking for any tripel fan."
"Overall, decent tripel, but after recently trying Westmalle, this doesn't seem as good as I remember. The alcohol becomes noticeable sooner despite it being only 8% compared to West's 9.5%. I expected it to be sweeter, although I enjoyed the spiciness and yeastiness of it"
"Nice floral aroma, taste is moderately bitter. Some fruit tastes, but dry, not sweet. Not too much aftertaste. Maybe a hint of some sweet malt. Creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and enjoyable throughout."
"Good brew and one of my top six rated active bottled beers for style."
"Very drinkable, and fiendishly so, as the elevated alcohol sneaks up because of the fact. Overall rather delightful, and certainly praiseworthy, though the $12.99 price tag the pub attached was outrageous. Good thing I wasn't buying!"
"D: Very drinkable as it goes down easy and the alcohol is well masked"
"MF&D - very carbonated and easy to drink, despite the pervasiveness of the alcohol."
"All in all a very nice beer, but I'm going to have to say that I liked the dubbel (Red) better from Chimay. That's unusual for me, but they totally nailed the dubbel and it feels to me that the tripel is just a little above average for a Belgian tripel."
"The first time I tried a Belgian beer, I hated it and refused to try another. Now I realise that a lot of things can happen to a Belgian beer from the time it is brewed to the time it is drank, especially when it is sent to Mississippi. This beer has shown me that they are not all bad, but it may take some time to get used to the style."
"D: Not too intimidating; of the three Chimays, this is probably the most sessionable."
"Amazingly drinkable. A classic and one to have again and again. There are many Belgian Tripels to explore, but you can always come home to this one."
"D..A good tripel. A couple during a session would certainly invoke a warm glow."
"D: Much better than I expected, not being a big trippel fan. Very crisp and dry which adds to drinkability."
"D - really drinkable, but not so exciting. I was kinda expecting more."
"overall a tad on the sweet side, but a good tripel."
"Definitely worthy of another buy!"
"Pours a hazy orange with a nice white head. Smells of a touch of fruits and spice. It tastes very tart and bitter with just a touch of spice. It has a nice lacing. This is pretty easy to drink, but I believe there are better triples out there. Being a Chimay I believe that everyone should try it atleast once."
"I don't think I'm a Tripel fan... this one pours a nice pale orange, with a fluffy white head that dissipated quickly in my Chimay glass. Aroma is fruity, with some hops... mostly apple aroma to me. Flavor is very dry, with some hop bitterness at the end. The finish is just a little rough for me... the mouthfeel is very carbonated, and it's hard to tell what is fizz and what is beer. Almost feels like drinking carbonated water... I would like to have had more up front flavor on this one, and it could have benefited from being a touch sweeter... and that is the only time I've ever asked for that in a beer."
"Wouldn't have more then one of these"
"Definitely enjoyed this one."
"Pours a medium hazy golden with a fairly large sized white frothy head. Nice lacing with good retention. When I first poured it I noticed the ever so slight hint of skunk in the aroma but it went away quickly. After that there was a nice spicy banana and malt aroma. The flavor is very nice and has a noticeable peppery taste (which is a good thing). Also fermented fruits and malts. As with most Belgian beers it is a very elegant beer when poured in the matching glassware."
"Too different for me to want to get it again."
"D: Very high. I would (and hope to) have this again."
"Drinkability: Tastes good and has a decent mouthfeel...relatively high ABV though. Not a drinking beer...I usually drink Chimay after dinner, and only one."
"The few brews that you can never go wrong with. Would order again."
"I was a bit apprehensive after being let down by the Chimay Blue but this beer has reaffirmed my faith in this brewery and will have to give the Blue a second shot. Love tripels and love this beer."
"This is really drinkable as it has no offensive tastes, and doesn't feel particularly heavy in the stomach."
"D: Very easily drinkable compared to its trappist brothers. The bitterness gets weaker for every sip."
"I was a little disappointed by this beer. With all the Trappist hype I was expecting something better. However, I think this is a very deep beer and maybe I need to work on my pallet a bit more. I felt the bottle got better at the end when I mixed the yeast in."
"D, notes: This is well balanced and pretty drinkable for a heavier beer. This is clearly a top shelf tripel and because of this I have kind of decided that I really don't like tripels as a style. I'm not saying that to knock Chimay or this beer, tripels just aren't my thing."
"(rated Apr 13, 2008)"
"Picked up a gift pack to try these beers and to get a goblet. The white (tripel) was probably my favorite of the three. A little less sweet than some of my favorite tripels, but still quite good."
"Drinkability: Not sure if I'd reach for another..."
"Great tasting, could only drink a couple of these at a time though."
"Great beer, kind of the unknown brother to the other Chimay beers, but you can't go wrong with a trappist. Not as good as Westmalle Tripel, but fantastic nonetheless."
"As trippels go, not one of my favorites. Murky gold pour with a bubbly white head. Aroma is yeasty and spicy, with a tiny bit of banana. The taste is heavily vanilla and raisins, mixed with what I can only describe as cake batter. No banana or yeast esters at all. Very creamy mouthfeel. Probably will not get again, just too much vanilla."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I've finally tried the Chimay line after much passing by, this beer, although not as flamboyant as the Grande Reserve, is a good example of the Tripel style and is tasty yet reserved. I will definetley seek this out in the future for sure."
"Drinkability - very tasty, very enjoyable. The dryness and subtle-but-deep complexity mean this wouldn't be well suited to several in one evening, but a single bottle is very enjoyable."
"Reviewed on 3/30/08. Bottle. Pours a murky orange with a thick, creamy white head. Initial aroma was of skunk, which got fainter as the beer warmed, but was still present. Taste of light fruits (but no distinguishable tastes), spices. Bitter finish. This was good, but lacked the complexity of the Bleu or even the Dubbel. 5/4/7/4/15 (3.5/5)"
"The bitterness is a bit strange for my personal tastes, but it's got a very rough character that I like. Good drinkability but not my favorite."
"Balanced with incredible resinence."
"Overall I was never a huge belgian guy, but with quality beers like this one I am learning to enjoy them. Great beer, I look forward to trying the blue and red."
"The taste is yeast and sweetness with small jab of black pepper. The finish is a little bitterness and spices. It has nice amount of carbonation to match and is crisp and nice to drink. This would be a great beer with dinner."
"Drinkability: Very good drink. Definitely not something to pound back or have more than two or three ofg, but should be savored. Another world-class beer from Chimay."
"Drinkability: Far better than even I had remembered. An enjoyable tripel -- quite drinkable, interesting, and readily available."
"This ale, like everything Chimay has, is very drinkable. The high abv makes me stay away from having more than a few of these in one night, but it's tempting!"
"O-This is a very well crafted good beer but the flavors just don't pop to give it great ratings that said I could drink this for a while and never notice how drunk I actually became."
"M = Medium to medium-heavy body, great mouthcoating, alcohol and carbonation sting just a little too much for it to be perfect, but it is darn close."
"D: Very nice drinkability, spicy, tangy, and refreshing."
"I noticed some definitely yeasty undertones, and I have to admit that the 8% ABV comes through pretty loud on this beer. It has a bit of a bite to it (especially if you are used to lower ABV beers and ""softer"" forms of drink)."
"M&D - a bit fizzy, couldve use a few more years on the shelf in my closet. still spectacularly chimay"
"Pours an amber colored body, with a small white head. Some spices and some alcohol are present in the aroma. Has a pale and dry taste, with a bitter aftertaste. A little bit of sweetness, but not enough to balance the bitterness in my opinion."
"With the alcohol so well hidden, this is an excellently drinkable brew. Nice and easy."
"It's Chimay, man. Some o' the best stuff in the world. Nuff said."
"Overall: great beer, complex and rich in flavors. Nicely balanced, as well."
"Drinkability: Excellent Trippel. One of the best I've had."
"Solid beer."
"Pours a slightly fogged gold with a thin white head. Nose is all dough and spices. And a lot of it. Flavor is the same. Load of spices. Loads of dough. Funk hits on the back side. Smooth liquid feel. Standard carbonation. This my friends is a tripel."
"Notes: I love Trappist beers and this is an absolute joy to drink. Monks Rock!!!"
"D: Very good tripel, but honestly not blown away by this brew as I expected. Real good brew but I enjoyed Victory's Golden Monkey more and expect there's better out there in the US micro community. Definetly a brew you should try as it's a staple in the beer world but be prepared for a good to solid experience only."
"D: Very complex and definitely unique. I like this one a lot, although the alcohol definitely made its presence known."
"Overall, an excellent Belgian Tripel - one that meets commonly accepted style guidelines, but more importantly, it's enjoyable to drink, has a lot of interesting flavor, and isn't overpowering in any way. Recommend for sure."
"D: out of the 3 Chimays I enjoyed this the least...I love their own characteristics tho...Red is very dry, white has a big bitter hoppy kick & blue is just...well...just beautifully balanced & brilliant."
"D: A great beer to enjoy and appreciate."
"Drinkability is quite good. A classic tripel. While it isn't all that pretty to look at, it sure is a pleasure to sip. I would think some age would do this one well too."
"A: Solid inch of foam that slowly subsides, along the edges a slope of carbonation climbs, some particles in the beer, looks like peach nectar - 4.25, S: Some sharp spices, tinges of pepper, smells like new clothing, some bready yeast aromas - 4.00, T: Alcohol is noticeable, nice balance of malt and hops though malt probably has a larger billing, some dulled fruitiness such as a mellow banana - 4.50, M: Creamy - 4.50, D: A very enjoyable and drinkable beer, extremely pleasing to the palate, not extreme but solidly crafted - 4.25"
"D: For a tripel, this one is pretty drinkable. Does not overpower you or your taste buds with too much of an alcohol burn. Definitely a nice beer that you might be able to have a few of because it tastes and feels so good before you realize it was bad idea. Reccommended."
"This is a style I enjoy a great deal but not one I get to experience on tap too often. This offering feels a bit lighter on the drinkability scale and is quite enjoyable. Good stuff!"
"D - This is a great tripel. I enjoy all Chimay brews and this one hits the mark, too."
"Starts out with a tart, fruity taste, I'm thinking white grapes, then puts forth a little bitterness and some grainy malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a sharp tingle from the carbonation. Good stuff."
"Picked up this bottle a while back, and thought i had already consumed it. Pours a hazy orange color, bright white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is nice and yeasty, with some apricot fruit notes, and a bit of spice. Taste is mildly fruity with a heavy does of spicey funk. Mouthfeel is somewhat fizzy but nice and smooth. Fairly drinkable, but the blue & red were much better."
"Pours a hazy orange/gold color that leaves a little sediment in the glass. The head is unavoidably massive. The nose is spicy, yeasty, earthy, and you can detect that some tartness will be present. The flavor is mainly spicy, and yeasty. Tangy, fruity, and earthy notes are present too, along with some alcohol."
"D - Very drinkable in all weather and certainly food friendly."
"Pours a orange color, slightly hazy, topped with a thick off-white foamy head. Slightly creamy head. Aroma is fruity banana with some yeast and vanilla. The flavor is citrusy with a mix of fruits, banana, grapefruit, and orange. Somewhat of a tart, winey, sour presence. Overall this is excellent with a complex mix of flavors while being even quite refreshing."
"Pours similar to the Chimay Red, except the color is much lighter. The color is a deep golden orange. The head is also huge. All of the Chimays looks so good in the glass that was included with them. The smell a stronger odor than the Red. The flavor is very dry with hints of grapes. The bubbles from the head heavily cover the glass. This was a very tastey ale, but it is my least favorite of the Chimays."
"D: A very easy drinker although as is typical with the Belgians, watch out for your sobriety."
"I tried it with a couple friends and one had the perfect description, he said 'this tastes like leather'.. and yes in that weird way it did. Nothing sat right with me. It wasn't too strong or bitter or hoppy or malty or anything like that. It just made my mouth say.. why did you just drink that? It did get a little easier to drink and I went on, but I still did not care for it. Sorry to bring this beer down but everyone else should know what they are getting into."
"This is obviously not a session beer, but it is super tasty!"
"Overall this is a solid tripel. A bit sweeter than others that I've had, but it's done well."
"Drinkability- Very Good, booze is there at 8.5% but very drinkable."
"The alcohol takes a while to realize, so for 8% it is very drinkable."
"Overall: She's a definite keeper!"
"Drinkability is good. The alcohol is well hidden bit it is a beer to sip and savor. Like a good night of intimacy, you want it to last but you don't want to rush."
"WOW.... what a delicious beer! Pours a honey golden yellow with slight haze. Fluffy white head that lingers and leaves spotty lacing around the glass. Smells of subtle sweetness and a slight hop aroma. Taste is outstanding! Slighty fruity with a sweet malty undertone. Perfectly blended tongue. Light and fluffy mouthfeel that rolls magically through the tastebuds. Easy to drink but slow down and savor the flavor!"
"D: definitely a sipping beer"
"Drinkability - I don't know:) It's drinkable I guess, but you have to like this type of beer and I definately need to try more beers of this kind to judge"
"D: Pretty tasty beer, but not sessionable at all, one 750ml is more than enough. Not the best triple I've ever had, but it is very enjoyable. A solid beer, just not my favorite."
"This taste was blind, and last for me. I've had it a few times before in un-blinded fashion and never liked it - I love the red and blue - and love other trappist tripels - so this one just doesn't do it for me."
"Idiosyncratic. I like it."
"Drinkability- Not sure why it took me over 1000 reviews to finally try this beer. Very good beer that I'm sure I will be having again in the future."
"This is the lighter spicy side of Chimay. The beer is full bodied but there is a lighter Saison like flavour to this beer.The finish is crisp and peppery with a little yeast on top. I like the way this works with many foods. Best drunk fresh rather than cellared"
"Full bodied mouthfeel, but with active carbonation that keeps it from being particularly bready. Apple and pear reside in the taste as well as the nose, eventually leading into into some spice. Very dry finish invites some follow up sips, but I couldn't have too many."
"Could drink one or two of these, very good taste, just a bit too much carbonation for me."
"I had this beer poured into a Chimay Chalice, its always nicwe when they have the glassware to match the beers. This beer poured beautifully a beautiful amber, nicely carbonated with a white head. The smell was of a nice begian Ale. The taste was very intense and well balanced, sometimes imo belgians go overboard with the flavor but this was wonderful, beautiful malts. (BTW this coming from a Hophead) The mouthfeel is very nice and if not for the pricetage this would definately be something I could drink all night."
"Poured this into a Chimay Chalice, Pours a hazy rustic amber yellow with a foamy head that recedes quickly. Smell is where this is at as this beer warms up the smell is amazing, sweet raison, bread, grass, rubbing alcohol, I enjoy submerging my face in the glass to catch these nice smells. Taste is heavy carbonated with a nice tart apple flavor to start then a warming bread aftertaste with just a slight bitterness to it and a dry finish. Overall this is pretty impressive but I was expecting more from a tripel which isn't one of my favorite styles. Overall this was pretty tasty with my pasta dinner and washed the flavors right down and the carbonation refreshed my palate, Garrett Oliver is an amazing food/beer pairer."
""
"Overall, very solid brew. Not too sweet like some other tripels (cough)Westmalle(cough)."
"Very well done."
"I didn't jump at this one on the first sip, but subsequent sips have drawn me in deeper. It's a very intriguing and deeply flavored tripel, with a lot more going on than I expected. What initially struck me as funky smells resulted in a nice doughy character that made it rather drinkable, with just enough heft and body to be satisfied with each sip."
"D - a Fantastic tripel -very well made w/ an inspiration that is hard to match. This is one of the first I ever had and it is great to have a bottle again after several years. The drinkability is very high and top for the style w/ a pleasant fullness w/ out the harsh heat of some. Tripels need to be balanced, yet show a full malt and delicate side at the same time. The mellowed malt character that married with the yeast has me wondering what the date this was brewed on."
"D-Probably my least favorite Chimay but still very good and drinkable definaly won't be my last one."
"d: A very nice example of a style I don't reach for often. I should try a bottle sometime for comparison purposes."
"Drinkability- This is the first in the Chimay series that I have tried and I plan on trying the others. A very drinkable beer, but I would expect nothing less from an authentic Trappist brew. This my first time delving into the style of a Tripel and from what I have read on this site this Chimay is a good representative of that style."
"My favorite of the Chimay offerrings. Very good triple. I need to get another bottle of this because I don't remember the exact flavors and aroma, just that it was a huge hit with my tasting friend and I. UPDATE tasted again on draft: Pours a hazy golden color. Great bannana aroma. Typical candy-like sweetness from the added fermentable sugars. Clove and mild citrus fruit on the tongue and nose. Good bitterness and clean finish. Alchohol is hard to detect because of the high level of sweetness."
"I am a big fan of this beer. It has a nice cloudy appearance with a sweet caramel look. I had it poured on draft at the Yard House in San Diego, CA, it was served in a goblet style glass. Very small head with light retention. For the ABV I find this beer to sweet with no trace of it's potency."
"Smooth, rich body is carried by hyper-active carbonation which clears the palate well. Overall a big, bruiser of a Tripel with phenolics being overpowering in my opinion. Still, a complex palate cleanser when paired with some crab and artichoke dip on crostini and a side of fresh strawberries and blueberries."
"One of the great tripels and with good reason."
"D: definitely a sipper, but excellent for special occasions and tastings"
"A rusty golden beer is topped off by a two-finger tan head which fills the goblet perfectly. Retention is excellent and a thick, consistent lacing is left being. Smell is robust and is full of big fruits, malts, yeasts and alcohol. Taste is complex and creamy yet somewhat sharp with all its elements blended so well as to be almost ambiguous. I make out grapes, raisins, yeasts, malts, some hops, a bit of candy sweetness (laughy-taffy) and some biscuity goodness. Carbonation is active and big according to the style. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, which yeilds a drinkable yet tasty classic tripel."
"D. While I only had one, I wish I had more. The 8% is somewhat managable given others in the same style. Excellent to be the pinnicle of a session, or a great place to start!"
"D: Very refreshing, ABV well hidden, extraordinarily drinkable. While perhaps not my favorite tripel, this one is definitely up there!"
"A nice Tripel but not my favorite. It drinks well and is a nice luxuries beer for a special occasion."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a nice zip of carbonation. One of the beer's nicer features."
"Pours a very hazy amber-gold color, with little chunkies floating around, with nice amounts of foam that settle into a small cap, leaving light but noticeable lacing. Light bodied, lots of carbonation. Very effervescent. Taste is of light apples, and tropical fruits, backed up by sweet malts and and dry hop finish. Very clean and crisp and an overall enjoyable brew, though I would take an Orval over this one if given the choice."
"Overall a very good beer. Not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be from reading others' reviews. I would hardly call the tastes I got 'sweet' at all. This actually reminded me slightly of a saison, but of course it is not."
"Not a world beater, but stands up well, highly enjoyable, some flavor combinations to be found with some effort (10oz pour is a bit on the light side). No complaints."
"Pours a cloudy dark honey/orange color with a thick white head made up of tiny bubbles. Amazing head retention leaving moderate lacing. Floral & fruity yeast mixes with the fragrant, sweet malt with some vanilla for a wonderful aroma. Up front flavor is of the fruity yeast leading to a cirtus hoppy middle finishing with a vanilla malty taste, very complex and balanced. Creamy mouthfeel, well carbonated with a medium to full body, great drinkability. One of those beers where you say ""wow"" after every sip."
"Note: This is called ""Cinq Cents"" in the 750ml bottles, which are the only sizes I have seen them in."
"Excellent in the mouth and for drinkability either way; quite smooth, crisp, and well-carbonated."
"D- Very easy to drink and very well balanced."
"Overall, a very good, very drinkable brew that I would love to have on hand all the time along with their absolutely killer Blue Grande Reserve."
"drinkability is good. this is a very pleasant tripel, with a notable malt profile, not too common for the style. cheers!"
"D - I would be hard pressed to finish more than one, this is a sipping beer, but definitely lives up to the Chimay name."
"D-this is a great beer, well rounded all together... really nice."
"This one poured a cloudy, golden amber with an really large foamy head. Nice lacing on the glass. Good carbonation. Smells of yeast, fruit, and a little alcohol. Taste is also yeasty with fruit and spice, peppery. Mouthfeel is medium/ full with a high degree of drinkability."
"D: Another great Chimay batch and rounded off the trio for my happy mouth."
"Poured out into a snifter, it was dark gold/light amber color semi-hazy with lots of carbonation. It had a nice thick fluffy head, about two fingers thick with some mild lacing, but it does thinn out fairly quickly. It has a sweet and spicy aroma mixed in with some malt. It has a clean crisp feel with a medium body. It has a really spicy flavor to it with a slight bitter taste as it reaches the back of your mouth and there are some sweet undertones throughout and finishes with a semi dry aftertaste. It really warms up your mouth; this is a great beer..."
"A modern classic, along with the rest of the line. I particularly love it when I find this on draft!"
"Overall, enjoyable tripel, although I think the Westmalle has a bit of a better mouthfeel and taste."
"Pours a light yellow color with a finger of white head that dissolves fast to nothing. Looks okay, but the weak head is nothing special. Nose is lots of spiciness and kind of a rough malt character. Taste is similar, although that rough maltiness comes to dominate and overwhelm the more interesting citrus and spices. Kind of rolls into a too-strong hoppiness as well. Body is solid with good carbonation. This one was far superior out of the bottle. Definitely a disappointment."
"This is actually my favorite of the Chimay line up. I enjoyed this chilled in my new Chimay goblet. Poured a murky medium brown color. Smelled mildy fruity with a yeasty essence (I didn't pour the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into the glass though). The taste was crisp and well balanced with an astringent feel on the way down. Cheers!"
"Poured into an oversized wine glass yielding a massive three fingers worth of white head. Had a cloudy dirty brown color that's not to appealing with fine sediment in bottom of glass. Scents of candied cherries, raspberry and rum, very nice. Tastes similar to the smell with cherries being most noticeable and maybe some cloves as well. Smooth texture with little carbonation. I'm pretty impressed with this one, I'd surely pick up another."
"I tried this again in a comparison of three tripels: chimay, westmalle and fin du monde. It seemed to have far more in common with the westmalle than the fin du monde, which is far fruitier and spicier. However, it seemed to be drier than the westmalle, and had less of a grainy aspect."
"Poured a cloudy golden color with nice white head that lasted a while. Aroma is yeasty and is also fruity. Flavor is crisp, clean and fruity with a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very nice and this beer disguises the 8% alcohol very well. Nice beer to sip and savor."
"MF&D- This beer is medium bodied and creamy. Chewy feel that coated the mouth well. Dry finish leaving behind a slight alcohol warmth. Great beer. Definitely not a pounding beer. Its too good to drink fast. Sip and enjoy."
"This almost could be a session beer -- it is very easy drinking."
"And the palate/mouthfeel -- c'est orgasmique."
"M/D: Extremely drinkable, wasn't quite sure what happened to my bottle once I poured my last drop. The mouthfeel was very good was a wee bit grainy but still did not perturb me to drink this bad boy down. I can't wait to have more of this tripel in my stock."
"M/D - Very smooth and creamy brew. Still prefer the Premier from these guys, but this is a very strong brew."
"The Tripel does well here, but will it be enough? Grand Réserve will close out the Chimay Invitational later tonight."
"11.2 oz brown bottle served in a Chimay Chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy gold with a big white head. Lots of carbonation. Sweet carmalized sugar aroma and a little spice. Medium bodied lots of sweetness. Light clove flavor. Spicy, slightly funky finish. A little earthy. Alcohol isn't evident. Solid beer."
"The pour is a cloudy gold with a nice thick two finger head right off the tap. The smell was malt dominated, but I caught some citrus and spices. It tasted great. A well balance between all three. It is definitely citrus and spice driven. It is a very refreshing beer, but a sipping beer. You don't want to mess with this beer at 8%."
"Due to the 8.0% abv. I wouldn't say this is a great session beer, but definitely good for a couple."
"A very interesting brew. When poured a white creamy head was created which dissipated slowly. A orange cloudy appearance in the glass. The nose was of yeast and lavender. Mouthfeel was well rounded. A distinct taste with hints of lemon and lavender definitely from the wheat. A medium bitter flavour which closed with a sour finish."
"The beer was served a hazy pale orange with a nice two-finger head that was slow to diminish and left great lacing. Aroma was loads of spice, yeast, and some sweet fruits. The beer was certainly on the heavy side, lots of alcohol stickiness. This one is enjoyable, but definitely a sipper."
"This poured a light hazy brown with lots of fluffy off-white head. It smelled like perfume and apple, with some hops. It had a strong bitterness and yeast flavor up front with a short and mild aftertaste, making it moderately easy to drink. It was thinner and more watery than the Red, but also had little carbonation. Overall it was a bit shallow, but decent."
"D: The funky aroma and flavor distracted from a fine brew. There are much better domestic and Belgium tripels so this brew will remain on the shelf unless it is offered at a substantial discount."
"I highly recommend anyone taste this in similar fashion, with the first pour (or pours if you've got the 750ml) being gentle, leaving an inch or more in the bottle for the second pour. It shant dissapoint!"
"I really liked this beer. But as it warms, the alcohol becomes very noticeable."
"D: This is a pretty good tripel. Not as impressive as the immensely complex and delicious Westmalle triple. Nevertheless, this is a quality beer that is well-crafted and highly drinkable. Not to mention, its quite easy to find in comparison to other trappists. I will buy this beer again. Quite satisfyting."
"D: A sipper, and a good one at that. Fantastic tripel from Chimay."
"T/M/D: Wholly mediocre. Way too much carbonation. Way too many flavors at once. The sweetness/bitterness at the back of my palates borders disgust. Not a particularly good tasting beer. No hop flavor to note, just sweet, and bitter, and not very good."
"D-not nearly as drinkable as some other Tripels,but overall a great display of a wonderful style"
"Good drinkability for the ABV."
"D- No my favorite, I would not go out to get this one again especial at the price point."
"Drinkability- Very solid wheat beer, sutble though, not going to knock you over the moon with flavor."
"D - Drinkability is average at best. It goes down easy but overall I was not impressed and will not have another."
" A beautiful beer."
"All in all, great belgian trippel. The alchohol hides very well. I think the Chimay Red is my fav, however I was very impressed with this. I need to compare it to the bottle, but on draft its simply amazing."
"D - Perfectly drinkable and complex enough to keep it interesting. This is a world class beer!"
"I went down to the Headkeeper tonight and bought a CHIMAY gift pack with three bottles...one each of the Triple, Premiere, and Grande Reserve along with a goblet. I figured I'd start of with the Triple, it being the lightest weighing in at 8% ABV. It poured into the goblet with a nice foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, leaving a line of bubbles along the inside rim of the glass. The scent was the scent was musky like a farm house ale but faint. Fortunately what it lacked in aroma it made up for in flavor. This is a bold triple, with a good bit of bitterness. It is a heavenly mix of both fruit and spice, with a smooth finish that doesn't vanish right away. It's funny though; a triple reminds me somewhat of a pinot grigio, not that I would ever admit to drinking one. It isn't a deep dark ale, but is complex and light on the palate all at the same time. There was a good bit of sediment in the bottle, which I made didn't end up going into the goblet. CHIMAY is an awesome Belgium beer, and I would recommend them to anyone. I cant wait to try the other two."
"D-All in all, this is a good drink. It is delicious, and goes down smooth."
"Had a Chimay White on tap at redline in Harvard Square this past Saturday night. Came served in the proper chalice. Pours with a nice fizzy head, and with a sunset yellow color. Smells like a classic tripel, with notes of spice and hay on the nose. Tastewise, it's quite good, one of the classic examples of the style. The only thing that I think it needs is that added ""oomph""' that some tripels hit you with on the palate. But I must admit, there are a lot more adventurous tripels out there when compared to Chimay White. Otherwise, this is a great choice now that you can find Chimay in more and more bars. When you you are looking for a beer at a place with an average selection, this is a can't lose."
"D - This would be a highly touted beer in my book without the addition of so many Saaz hops. Way too earthy for my palate. Chimay, less Saaz please."
"On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. If you enjoy tripels,check it out."
"The date stamp on the cork is 03/07.The beer was poured into Chimay glasses and produced a thick off-white head. The head eventually dropped to 1/4 inch but never faded totally. The beer is a highly-carbonated bright amber orange, and it's quite attractive. (Food should please the eyes as well as the palate.) The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with a underlying sweet malt and hints of fruit. The aromas are precursors to the flavor palette. A complex blend of hoppy, fruity and yeasty. There are a range of spices lingering in there as well; pepper, cinnamon are noted. A faint candy sweetness waits in the background. The aftertaste has some drying bitterness with peachy fruitiness in the end. I found the alcohol to be very well-masked."
"D - overall thought that the bottled really compared in comparison to the on tap version other than this one was a lot better to look at. This one on the whole just did not really do it for me and have to say I was happy I bought just a little bottle. I'd much rather spend on my money on a Westmalle Tripel as I thought that one was much better personally. Worth a try but not worth going out of your way to find it."
"I'd love to taste this one side by side with La Fin Du Monde (Unibroue), as I feel they have a very similar profile."
"Bottle in a Chimay glass. Aroma of floral hops and yeast. Very cloudy orange with thick, frothy off-white head and lots of bubbles coming up though bottom of glass. Light lacing. Flavor a mix of biterness, yeast, spicy hops and alcohol with a definite ""Belgian"" character in the background. Effervescent mouthfeel. Fairly light body. Dry finish but had a slightly sweet, bitter aftertaste with hints of alcohol. A very nice tripel."
"Verdict: A strong tripel that is truer to style than other tripels I've had. You have to leave it up to the trappist monks to create a beer that is so complex, it's nearly heavenly in stature."
"A great triple"
"D: Although it is a good beer, I can't see making this one a regular in my drinking rotation. It would be nice as an occasional treat, but after the first one, I'd order something else."
"T:Very sharp with some apple lots of carbonation feel in the mouth there is some yeasty and malty tastes i enjoy the taste. cant put anything more to it"
"A very nice Triple, but I am not the biggest fan of Triple's compared to other Trappist ales. Appearance is the typical Triple yellow with a big foamy white head. Taste and mouthfeel are very dry and not as fruity as I would have liked. I personally would select one of Chimay's two other common offerings."
"Carbonation is a bit high. Lightness in body contributes to the booziness taking over the palate with too much warmth."
"D- I would come back to this one, but not one of my favorite tripels."
"I still hold strong that the blue is by far the best of the Chimay offerings and this is the weakest after many attempts. Im not sure what Im missing- just not my thing I guess."
"I love Triples and this one while not being my absolute favorite (Gouden Carolus, Westmalle, and St. Bernardus) is still very good and I will definitely have more of it in the future. These monasteries can make some beer."
"I don't know if I will be getting a lot more of this, as there are other tripels I like more - but it is a very pleasant drop nonetheless!"
"Overall, a tasty beer. Not my favorite tripel, but a solid choice. No real flaws."
"I bought this in a gift pack of all three Chimays...and I was not impressed with any of them,but this one was better then the Red,but not as good as the Blue,having said that I myself will not be buying any of them again,but then again,I prefer Stouts over most Ales,so maybe I am not the best judge of this style."
"Poured into my Chimay Chalice. It poured a golden orange color with a thick white head, that left a decent amount of laceing down the glass. The smell is malts with a hint of yeast and alcohol. The taste is of malts and alcohol at first and then giving way to some earthy spices. The overall mouthfeel of this beer is light, with a decent amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer and very drinkable. I wouldn't say it is the best one from Chimay, but like the other two, I could enjoy this one over and over."
"Overall: Another reason why Chimay is an institution upon itself. Another Belgian brew that doesn't disappoint."
"This might be my favorite triple. There is lots of peppermint that makes for a unique tasting beer."
"d - not very drinkable with respect to quantity given the abv, but very enjoyable after a long day of work. Clean and refreshing."
"A Wonderful Tripel. One all should be judged by."
"Served in my Chimay chalice. Poured a hazy burnt-orange with two fingers of foam, eventually settling into a quarter-inch consistent skim. Ample belgian lacing during the tasting with excellent adherence. Nose presented immediately with the scent of alcohol, followed by a mild scent of dark fruit and yeast. Taste similar to nose with the addition of the faint presence of apples, (but much less pronounced) followed by a crisp, citrusy-tart finish. Tingly mouthfeel, not surprising given the abundant head. This is, by far, my favorite tripel; however, at 8% abv it can pack a punch. Truly an incredible tasting experience and my favorite of the three."
"Given that my mouth eventually tires of hops, and the 8% keeps me from having more than a few, drinkability in the repetitive sense must be scored low. But given how much i like drinking one of these, i'll average the two and call it pretty good."
" Drinkability is partly there- at 8% it's not something that you'll die from splitting a six-pack from, but I'm not sure if this is something you would want to. It's a beer that once you start drinking (and really, if you're not reviewing a beer, who is going to take 2-3 minutes to analyze the aromas of the beer, giving it time to warm and release flavors) I can see it becoming a beer that you might actually become a little bored with, and at the same time, since it is such a subtle, one-dimension beer, a beer that you could really start to drink quickly as your consumption increases. Jesus I don't know. I feel like this beer misses somewhere, or maybe I missed somewhere. Maybe I just didn't feel it with this beer. Maybe I had a bad bottle. Maybe my palate was shot. Maybe if I have to write three rhetorical questions to justify a low score I just didn't like a beer as much as I thought I should have. Maybe."
"D - A beer that always kicks my ass. When I want this, I want only one. In some ways, I like this better than the Westmalle tripel, but it isn't as drinkable."
"D - This is a very good beer that lives up to its reputation its definitely worth a try sometime"
"I must have missed the boat with this one. Last night I tried the second one of the two I bought this past Saturday. It was syrupy thick and sickeningly sweet and after two sips I gave it to my buddy who'll drink anything. If this was the last beer on the planet, I'd stay sober with little problem. This beer was terrible. I will not subject myself to this again."
"D- I did not like this much. Too bready, seems like it is a beer that had gone bad."
"Chimay Tripel is splendid, a great nightcap on a cold night by the fire. Life is good."
" Mouthfeel has a carbonated bite that stings the back of the throat on the way down. Taste is extremely carbonated and has a foul aftertaste. This one is losing me fast. The tripel itself has a very unusual and hard to describe taste. Not very pleasing at all and not what Ive come to expect based on previous reviews. Going, going. At $5.49 a bottle, definitely overpriced and Im certainly glad I only purchased one. My first and last Chimaygone. I am not going to slam this but this certainly ranks among the least favorite tripels Ive had. Too bad as I was expecting much more. The Val-Dieu tripel I had yesterday was far superior in every aspect but the head. I think Ill pop one to get the taste of this out of my mouth."
"Bottle poured into wide rimmed goblet. Color is a cloudy pale orange with white foam which dissipates, good lacing. Aroma is fruity with the heavy esters that you expect from a Belgian brew. Flavor matches the aroma with the fruity, almost chewy, esters mixing with the pale malt and gentle hop bitterness. Finishes smooth and well balanced. A true classic."
"Poured a nice amber/orange color with fantastic head and nice lacing. It has a great citrus scent, very fruity, flowery, and aromatic, with a little bit of sour undertone. Nice taste, an excellent blend, nice and malty, with nice fruity hits (such as orange) and other flavors, such as butterscotch. Goes down great for an 8%. I love all the Chimays, and while the red is my favorite, I'll never say no to a white."
"I absolutely loved Chimay Red, and this one was equally amazing... Chimay may just be my favorite all time brew... the white tripel is outstanding... pours a hazy, light brown, off color cloudy appearance with decent head... smell is very fruity with a rich aroma with bananas and fruit... tase is exceptional... fruity, with citrus aftertones, banana flavor and with an 8% abv, it is hardly noticeable behind a conglomeration of wonderful flavors that melt in the mouth... amazing brew... Definietly recommended..."
"Good stuff!"
"Taste is nice and dry, balanced bitterness and some spicy and fruity notes from the yeast. Mouthfeel is light and medium high carbonation makes this one quite refreshing. This one could be dangerous because it is fairly strong (8%) but is very light-bodied and drinkable. A very good beer and one that is not too expensive and widely available--is there any reason not to drink this beer?"
"Final Note: I've had a few Tripels and found the others to have been much sweeter than this brew was. I like bitterness and I like this Tripel."
"I tried this one at Tapwerks in OKC, I happen to like this one quite a bit, but not like the Grand Reserve. I was extremely impressed with the Grand Reserve but I have to admit I was a little dissapointed when I drank this one, thinking it would have the same quality as the GR but I did enjoy it nontheless"
"I hate saying it, but Chimay White leaves a little to be desired.. I desire a little more of everything.. nose, pronounced flavor, and body. I've had this beer probably dozens of time over the years and until know, I've always considered it a ""benchmark"" triple; I don't anymore."
"Drinkability- Usually the drinkability on this beer is much higher, but now it is really a difficulty to drink. I suppose it would be good to watch light sources on these beers, but the location I bought at had no flourescents around at all, so I just can't explain this skunking."
"Some nice malt sweetness, particularly honey, with some sour apple, cloves and some refreshing alcohol in the aftertaste. It is a touch different. Really smooth and well carbonated, it is surprisingly easy to sit back and drink for the high alcohol. Gives Karmeliet a run for my favourite Triple."
"overall still decent, but the medicinal notes cut down on drinkability somewhat. watch out - the 8% ABV is cleverly hidden."
"Overall a decent brew from Belgium that i wouldn't mind having again at some point, recommended."
"This beer pours a thick pillowy three to four finger head that barely diminishes atop the hazy golden liquid in my chalice. The smell is sweet but astringenty with distinct clove note. The taste is dry at first with a beautiful, almost butterscotch, creamyness, perhaps from diacetyl, that fades into a light malty sweetness. This beer finds an amazing balance between malt and candied sugar. The body is light medium with crisp almost sharp carbonation and lovely smooth finish. This beer spills down my throat like solf silky chocolate milk. This is a great beer."
"Bottle poured hazy gold big pillowy head .Aromas of fruit (yeast) and spices. Nice clean mouthfeel good carbonation. Flavors of sweet fruit and malt with a lite bitter hop finish This is a soild triple not one of my personal best but solid none the less"
"Once again this is a standard beer. A good example of a trippel but nothing special or terribly unique. pours clear yellow and bubbly as hell. good nose for a trippel, but the taste seems almost false. It feels like a they are faking it some how with the malts. I dont know how to explain this but it is like a mock trippel taste. like sugar free candy as opposed to candy. dont let this take away from it though as it is still better than any american brewed trippel i have had as of yet. good buy"
"D: The orange peel tang does get a little tiring after a while, but it's an enjoyable beer and I could certainly stand to drink a few of these."
"Drinkability: A great treat in the world of beer. Challenges the drinker, but remains very refreshing."
"D: This is my first Tripel and while I like the Bleu, I think this is a bit more drinkable, though this is certainly a more complex beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a chalice. The beer pours a hazy light gold/orange color, forming a 1 inch white head. Medium lacing coats the glass. The aroma is of yeast, sugar, and fruit aromas. The taste is a complex mix of the yeast, dark fruit flavors, light sugar, and a hint of alcohol. There are more flavors present, but these are the most pronounced. Medium and slightly harsh mouthfeel. Not as smooth as expected, but not terrible. Good flavor makes for a drinkable tripel, but the higher abv. keeps this from being a sessionable ale. Overall, not a bad tripel. I guess I expected a bit more from the Chimay name, but I guess they cant be tops in everything. Still, its a good brew, and one I wouldnt mind having again."
"D: A good Tripel by Chimay, I liked the beer overall, but didn't really pique my interest, I'd definitely have it again though."
"picked this one up today. Poured out a very lovely golden color, murky. Nice fluffly head. Instant smells of yeast, flowers, hay, lots of hoppyness.taste bitter orange, fruits, very peppery. can feel the alcohol slightly in the back of my throat. Mouthfeel is tart, slightly thin.This beer is not at all as sweet as I had thought it was going to be, I appreciate the tartness, a nice tripel."
"D: This was OK, but I liked the Grand Reserve much more. There just wasn't enough to balance out the bitterness for me, because the hops had no distinctive flavor. I like the flavor of dubbels more, this is just a bit too subtle."
"to me, fresh, this is as good as it gets for a Tripel, most american versions these days seem to want to head into the 10% category which unless done perfectly becomes a tough brew, this beer even with Chimay's growth remains a wondeful drinker with a nice kick, its malt character is soft and bready somewhat like a fresh baked sugar cookie with a gentle touch of noble hops, the finish is dry and a tad chalky as happens with many belgians with the sugar addition, but the Chimay is always more subtle on the sugar adjunct with a nice pilsner base, end run on sentence, I truly enjoy this brew."
"Drinkability: A very nice tripel, that avoids the sweetness of some of the other versions of the style; but I am not crazy about the herbacious quality"
"d - a very drinkable beer for something that comes in at 8% abv"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were good. Plenty of carbonation as well. All in all a fine example of a classic style"
"Taste, and smell, is of belgian yeast, sweet malt, some citrus overtones (more lemon-y than anything else), and some spices (coriander?). Tastes good, solid, but at this price there are other brews I'd prefer. Still, very solid."
"Drinkability: Although not my favorite style of beer, I kind of enjoyed it. Would have it again, but not too frequently."
"Poured a stubby into a Chimay chalice. Poured a hazy amber with a nice inch head that stayed around for quite a while. Left some beautiful lacing all the way down the glass. Smell was fruity with a nice hoppy blending. Tasted sweet, nice malty front to the beer with lemon and other citrus fruits mingling with a hoppy sensation at the back of the beer. Definitly on the higher end of the carbonation spectrum. Up to Chimays standards. Great beer."
"Cannot say anything bad about any trappist beer because they have all been good so far, I can see why this is so popular all over the place, this was quite good for my first experience with Chimay"
"D- Drinkable I would say, but this is my least favorite of the Chimays. All others are more drinkable and more worth the money."
"Hmm, hoppier than most tripels I've tried. Definitely has the trappist yeast character of subtle, earthy spice that mix with the hops into a fantastic aftertaste. Unfortunately, the main flavor is a little too mellow with the malt, leaving most of the taste to the end of the drink."
"Review added 11-11-2007, translated from french 2-26-2008."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Lemon rind and grapefruit, ample hops, slightly peppery. Smooth and velvety on the tongue. The finish is extremely dry. This is the hoppiest of Chimay's 3 beers."
"Recommended."
"Second part of my Chimay trilogy. Pours a beautiful hazy golden color with nice 2 finger rocky head. Head slowly decipates and leaves a layer behind for the rest of the beer, good lace but not excessive. Smell is of yeast, fruit, some alcohol, and a grain/bread-like smell. Taste is great. Taste is a mix of yeast, bread, apple, alcohol, some sweets, and some bitterness. Very complex. Moderate carbonation leaves a nice clean mouthfeel with a plesant aftertaste. Overall a very good beer. So far much more to my liking than the red. ""Blue"" is next."
"d: a really great brew w/ well balanced flavors; a little bit much on the alcohol flavors but i could chug this all day; very refreshing for a beer with high alcohol content"
"Poured into a Chimay chalice a dark cloudy gold with a decent creamy head that lasted nicely. Light lacing. Smelled inviting, but subtle for the style -- spice, citrus, yeast, diacetyl all present, but mild overall. A bit boozy to the tongue, perhaps because the mild flavors can't quite cover up the alcohol. The slightly bitter dry finish is pulled off, but the whole thing feels off. Even though I think this is the least of Chimay's offerings and that it doesn't stack up against other notable tripels, it's still a very good beer to sip on if it's what's available."
"D- Not blown away by this beer -- I don't know exactly where this beer fits into my life. Is it an afterdinner beer? Not really. With food? Can't think of a perfect pairing. Hot Summer Day? Not so much... Maybe I'll find that perfect moment sometime."
"This poured an opaque amber with golden highlights and a two finger head that lingered for a little while. The smell is a little yeasty and reminds me of fresh baked bread and a bit of a sweet fruity scent. The taste is very rich with a touch of sweetness and bit of an alcohol presence and a nice little hops bite towards the end that is very crisp and refreshing. There's a reason everyone raves about this beer, it's really damn good for the price. It's very drinkable and I would expect that I could go through a couple of the larger bottles a week if it was in my budget."
"Poured from a small 11.2 oz bottle with no apparent freshness date. Into the Chimay glass it was a hazy pale orangish white with a soft foam head that left no lacing. It smells of apples and a yeasty aroma. The flavor is spicy with a little nutmeg coming through. It was sweet and a little bit tart. In the mouth it was fast to the punch. This was the first time with this legit tripel. I will definitely come back as I venture more into the Belgian styles."
"Mouthfeel is noticeably Belgian with the tight crisp carbonation. Drinkability is a bit difficult due to the spices, but the alcohol is deceivingly absent as with many Belgian brews. Not my favorite tripel, but a solid offering and easily found at local bottle shops."
"D: Not drinkable for me - the taste is too rich and fruity, and the astringency makes the drink a pain to put down. I'll sadly be pouring the rest of this out."
"mouthfeel is carbonated, and boozey, very drinkable but this one is a sipper, to be savored."
"D - Smooth, good, but probably won't go back to it."
"O: Very drinkable .. the ABV goes well with this beer.."
"Very complex, alcoholic, and a sipper. Packs a punch, but so tasty and a great tripel. Price is an issue, as with most Belgians, but I'd be happy to oblige now and then."
"My second Chimay Blanche, first was a draft, this one from a bottle, dated 2006. Hazy, golden pour, nice, frothy white head. Flavor was slight fruit and slight flowery (clove ?). Sort of spicy. Nice beer with no real taste of alcohol present. Very easy to drink and enjoy. Smoother on draft than in bottle."
"Very drinkable beer, just like the other two regular beers the monks brew at Chimay."
"Quite pale, orangish yellow with a large fluffy head. Instant aromas of floral hops, light citrus, and mild spice. Mildly yeasty. Surprisingly light (but not watery) mouthfeel with less fruit character and more malt/yeast than in the aroma. Spiciness remains (aided by the prickly carbonation). Hint of alcohol as it warms. Very refreshing for an 8% beer."
"Had this one on tap at Brassarie V in Madison. Poured in to a Chimay goblet. Appearance was a hazy yellow with a white head. Strong fruit and floral aromas. A smooth and nice tasting trippel, with a little bit less yeast presence than some others. A solid brew, but at around 8%, one or two is enough (i happened to nearly finish off the keg, so the bartender gave me a pint glass of the leftover head that settled into a nice amount of beer. After two of these, I was ready to call it a night)."
"I tried this beer on September 13, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe's' in Toronto. The beer poured hazy brown with a large generous whitish head. The aroma was a combination of malt, and fruits. I was expecting yeast, it was not there. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, crisp, with high carbonation. The flavour was malty with some bread."
"D--Pretty good tripel but no where close to the Premiere, which I consider to be one of the best beers in the world. If you are tripel lover, this is must try/have. Everyone who loves beer should make sure they drink all of the Chimay beers."
"I REALLY like tripels and some golden strongs, but this one is superb. It seems to hit that middle ground of not too sweet, and not too dry. All I can say is wow!"
"I'm not a big fan of this one. It has many of the nose, taste and mouthfeel characteristics of a Belgian tripel but it was still a little too bitter for my taste. Not a hoppy or green bitter but just not as sweet sweet as I like in a tripel. It's certainly drinkable and I wouldn't turn my nose up at one if out and about but if given a choice between this and many of the other great tripel style beers out there, I'd probably choose something else."
"I probably wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting because it is a slightly more aggresive brew."
"D - A tasty beer that is deceptive with it's 8% ABV. Complex enough to be interesting yet not too overpowering."
"Pretty solid, but it likely would improve with age. I was a bit disappointed because I enjoyed Chimay Red so much, but oh well."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a great beer to stick with and drink for a long time and drink slowly. Its one of the better Tripels that Ive had."
"My impression is that the alcohol is still front and centre in this sample and that aging might bring a smoother delivery and finish. If I cellar this for a year, or three, it might pay huge dividends .. guess I'll have to try that as this rating is probably a touch lower than it might be."
"D- chimay are totally some of the best beers i've ever had in my life and they all earn a super duper from me."
"Al-tho the alcohol is apparent in the aroma, it is well hidden in the flavor."
"D- This was a very delicious brew but after one I was ready to move on to something else. This was excellent and my first Trappist beer. I will definately have this one again. I even bought myself a Chimay chalice to enjoy it in at home."
"Effervescent at first and chalky to finish."
"D: eh... good but a bit drab (other than the spice). I guess I expected more out of this beer."
"Not Chimay's best, especially when sitting next to their fantastic Blue Label... However it's a good Tripel, and packs quite a punch. This one may require some aging to smooth out the edges, but was pretty good fresh."
"Stubby bottle from Cardinal. I love the red cap Chimay, so I was looking forward to the white cap. I must note that I do not care for this particular style in general. The conditioning usually boats me too much, however the effects are usually stellar. At any rate I poured this extremely slow, still yielded a 2 finger lasting head. To me this was all spice. taste was mostly crushed black pepper, with a hint of orange underneath. This ale probably has the biggest contrast between the initial taste and the back end...It's a good quality brew, just not my cup of tea...Palate was soapy and resinous."
"Earthy, spicy, yeasty, warm flavor. Great beer. Fantastic mouthfeel, with a perfect level of carbonation. Smooth and drinkable. In fact, I could drink this all day. Not too heavy and not too light. Well balanced, flavorful. Excellent."
"I really enjoy this tripel. Not my favorite but still an awesome beer."
"Much to my surprise, I liked it quite a bit more than the Westmalle Tripel I started the session with."
"This is an outstanding tripel that really shone through on-tap. It paired perfectly with my morbier cheese plate."
"A wonderful, classic beer. One of my favorites."
"A solid tripel from one of the few remaining Trappist Breweries. An enjoyable treat when in the mood for a slightly heavier bodied tripel."
"Pours out a honey color with a white head that recedes a bit too quickly, leaving no lace. Smell is bready with honey, apricots (both fresh and dried), alcohol, and herbal hop. Flavor starts off with an almost chewy malt flavor doused with honey and fruit which is followed by some yeasty spice and alcohol in the middle and finishes dry with a touch of grain and some herbal/tea hops that give off a solid bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel feels lively and light in weight yet has solid body and almost coats the tongue in malt. One of the best tripels I've had."
"The only negative I could say about this is that it is very expensive. I paid $9.61 at Cask'n'Keg in Mystic for a 75cl bottle. I can get a 33cl bottle at Gordon's in New London (GO THERE!), but I'm sure it is still a premium beer. But it is so worth it."
"Drinkability - Excellent respresentation of a triple. I found this offering very balanced would would put this on the short list of excellent tripels."
"D- great flavor, nice balance, easy drinking for 8%, tasty, recommended. I see why chimay is so popular"
"Drinkability: Light, robust, very drinkable, I would even say sessionable if this wasn't 8% alcohol. Neither too sweet nor too spicy; extremely well-balanced."
"Not sure what to say about this that hasn't been said. I've had the bottle and the glass and prefer the glass on tap. Smooth tasting, lightest tasting of the three but stronger than red overall. It's just a damn good beer!"
"The color was clear and tan as it poured from the bottle and is orange-tan in the glass. There was plenty of carbonation and a fluffy white head. The smell was both fruity and bready with a lot of alcohol. The taste was quite complex with a fruity tartness up front, bready malt flavors, and very pleasant almost brown sugary aftertaste. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp. I usually find this style of beer not to be very drinkable--I can usually only handle (enjoy) about 8 oz (at the most). But this is very drinkable. This is by far my favorite beer within this style."
"FINALLY a Trappist on tap. A lighter amber-ish color with a nice white head retention. Smooth with a small dry end. I think I could drink this all day, it is mellow enough to go with whatever you are doing or eating. I just hop to see the other Chimays on tap soon, or even other Trappists."
"are living witnesses tried and loved by many."
"A really good beer. The best tripel out there? That's not for me to say at this point. Should certainly be paired with some type of food, maybe take the bro's offerings to task, give the brew a little time to warm after the first taste, and it should go a long way towards pleasing."
"D- Not the best Tripel out there, but a classic none-the-less."
"If you haven't tried Chimay, you should. Use your own judgement to see if it lives up to the hype. This is a very good reliable brew. This is my favorite Chimay, but that is due to tripels being my favorite style of brew."
"D - I think this beer is very easy to pair. You could have a mediocre meal and this beer would certainly improve your lot. Although not the best tripel, it's certainly the easiest to drink without worrying about pairing."
"D: Not as good as the Red or even close to the Blue, but still a good brew from a great brewer."
"D: Very drinkable: nice flavors to go along with a smooth beer with good complexity. A very good triple."
"Mouthfeel is light and dry. Very crisp and refreshing. I don't really notice the alcohol. Very nice indeed."
"I'd recommend the Grand Reserve (Blue Chimay) over this one."
"Drinkability: Disappointing after the rest of the Chimays, but I have high standards for this style and this one didn't fit my expectations - perhaps I'm not giving it a fair shake. In any case, nothing can disappoint me today: I'm done!"
"Poured in a cloudy, honeyyellow colour and with a good, creamy head. The smell was basically of bread, yeast and sugar. The taste was bitter, not too sweet with notes of bread, yeast and alcohol. I have to say I was a bit disappointed since it did not really measure up to most of the trappists I have tasted. Nevertheless it's a good brew."
"pours a cloudy, hazy opaque color with insane amount of carbonation, the cork nearly killed me. a frothy white head is large and not going anywhere. Smell of yeast and fruit are clearly evident, a hop note is also prevalent. Before i drink it you can see the sediment start to settle on the bottom of the glass, but still tons of carbonation. tastes good, but not great, not 10 dollars a bottle good either, floral notes are in the beer, with a warm alcohol presence, unfortunately it tastes a bit more watery than it should. at 8% i could still down a few of these so the drinkability is high, even though its higher than average ABV. its a good beer, i heard GREAT things from it, if it were cheaper i'd probably be a bigger fan but 10 bucks for 25.4 onces is kinda high. But maybe i'm just a cheapskate.."
"Pours a hazy amber with a very large white head. Good lacing and retention. The aroma is of yeast and some spice, also apples. The taste is yeasty, peppery and ends with hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste is a bit acidic making the overall taste not very appealing to me. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and quite carbonated. Drinkability is not great due to the aftertaste. Overall, my least favorite Chimay."
"A very pleasant beer."
"Poured an 11.2 oz. into a chimay chalice. The first from a ""Chimay Sampler"". Starts out with a nice thick head that lingered throughout. It's appearance was quite dense, a very good quality. I picked up lots of fruit coupled with hoppiness in the smell, definitely enticing. I believe I enjoyed the smell a little more than the taste it presented. The alchohol definitely makes itself known behind the increasing hops toward the end as it warms. Overall, the monks at Chimay produce a quality tripel, one that I will definitely enjoy again. But with two more chimay's to go and the talk I've heard, the bar is rising."
"Ahhh. I just finished a bottle of the Chimay Cinq Cents, or white as i call it. Wow i really love this beer, In the recent weeks ive had the pleasure of tasting some pretty amazing beers(Duvel, LaFinDuMonde, Bink tripel and the Corsendonk brown and blond to name a few), I must say that the Chimay is still my favorite. I poured it into a Large Clear glass, it had decent lace and 1.5 finger head. I could detect apples and bit of burnt wood flavor, After about 3 quarters of the way through my head got warm i and could feel the alcohol. Overall i love the whole experience and taste of the Chimay White, Where else can you get beer brewed by Monks?"
"It's a little more light than I've seen in other tripels. I prefer the stronger flavors of a Westmalle, but this would be more ideal in the right weather or with the right food."
"I had the pleasure of pouring this beer into my newly acquired Chimay goblet. It was sparkling golden with a thick head  nice lacing. The aroma was sour and there were hints of fruitiness. The taste was also sour and fruity. It is nicely balanced and makes this seem like a more delicate beer than other Chimays Ive had. The mouthfeel is full but not heavy by any means. I find this particular beer quite drinkable and would be refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability- This is a very tasty tripel. Easily enjoyable in moderation as the ABV will keep you line. Very Niiicccee!!"
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Cloudy, rich golden color with a quickly dissipating head that leaves minor lacing. There is also some tremendous carbonation working here. The smell is crisp and spicy with a slight note of clove. Taste is very balance - clove, sour apple, and little bit of floral character as well. Mouthfeel is intense due to the carbonation, which adds to the crispness. Being that I drank a 25.4 oz bottle myself & would do another if possible is a testament to this brew's drinkability. Highly recommended."
"I ordered this on tap at the Driskill Grill in Austin, TX, which happened to be one of only four on tap. In a perfect world it would be great to have superb food and a great beer list. The tripel was very enjoyable but it I was not able to pair it well with the food that I ordered."
"It starts bubbly and finishes smooth. It's really hitting the spot right now. It's one of my new favorites."
"Very hazy dark orange in color. No real head to speak of, and not much lacing. Typical Belgian smell. Very bitter and dry mouthfeel. Creamy texture with a medium body. Hops are not noted in the aroma ,but only noted on the aftertaste.Spicey orange and citrus with light malts. Mouthfeel is well-balanced from all angles and goes down smooth.Overall good, but nothing great. Could use more in the taste and appearance dept."
"Comments: I loved this! Delicious. One of the best tripels I've had. The ABV is a bit pronounced, but well balanced with the sweet maltiness & dry, crisp mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- It's okay. Nothing to write home about."
"Pours a cloudy pale orangish gold color with white creamy head that laces the glass all the way down. Smells very fruity/estery and a little yeasty. Tastes very hoppy and a tiny bit sweet and yeasty. Finishes sort of sour. Mouthfeel is very heavy with some fizz to it. Overall, it's fairly drinkable, but I think I prefer Chimay's other brews."
"Drinkability-- Here is where I was glad to have the opportunity to drink the beer from the tap. It might have just been me, but the alcohol was slightly less noticeable than usual, making this beer a pleasure to drink in large, mouth-filling gulps over an extended period of time. I find myself hard-pressed to have just one."
"It's hard to describe here, but this beer is all of a piece - knows what it wants to be and works together beautifully. Might be ubiquitous, but it's sure good..."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is noticeable, but balanced fairly well. really enjoyable."
"A slightly underwhelming tripel. Solid but uninspiring like the rest of Chimay's range, not bad... just not spectacular"
"Chimay Tripel pours nicely and produces a beautiful bright white head, which sticks around through out the whole session. The body is quite hazy and caramel in color. It gives off aromas reminiscent of bubble gum. It also has a taste somewhat like bubble gum, but finishes a bit like orange rind. This bites at first from all the carbonation and finishes warm."
"Overall, great Tripel from a great trappist brewery, but not the best trappist tripel I've had (think Westmalle)"
"D - Very drinkable but like most tripels to be savoured in ones or twos due to alcohol kick."
"very well made"
"I don't think this is a very drinkable beer. Given the price, and given the taste, I just can't hang. I would never pass one up if bought for me, but I won't go out of my way for it."
"A cool crisp tripel. Very nice lacing- not as spicy as far as aroma goes- lacks the pervasive fruity characteristics. Hop bitterness makes itself known right away- the mild yeast flavors are immediately counteracted by the strong bitterness. Somewhat different than many other tripels, a more refreshing and drinkable take on the style. Finished clean and dry with a slight note of alcohol and hops."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a giant white fizzy head. There is a ton of yeast in the bottle so be careful pouring. The smell is a strong lemon.alcohol,candy sugar,and a ""bisquity"" aroma. The taste is full of carbonation, candy sugar,alcohol, lemon,and bread yeast. A good flavored beer,yet nothing really outstanding. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well. My only problem with this beer is that it's lighter and thinner than other tripels. Still it's not bad, and worth a try."
"Very easy to drink, light flavor belies 8%. Excellent tripel, though not as complex as Westmalle or Karmeliet. Flavorful and easy to drink, will pair nicely with a wide range of foods. Good introduction to Belgian ales and tripels."
"Probably my favorite from Chimay. This triple can be considered the gold standard. It's a beer everyone should try. Recommended."
"Surprisingly light bodied, with high carbonation. This is a nice drinkable tripel that can creep up on you if you are not careful."
"It's actually really very refreshing and drinkable - a perfect way for someone to get into Belgian beer if they're not familiar with the strikingly bold flavour most brews present."
"Don't drink and review."
"Probably my least favorite Chimay but a good showing none the less. I would like to try aging a bottle and perhaps review it again."
"Great as usual."
"Full bodied and exceptionally refreshing and drinkable. Highly recommended."
"Pours to a generous white head and Belgian lace. Orange-cloudy color. Aroma is spicy and peppery with a little malt in the background. Flavor is spicy and not too hot for 8% abv. There are lots of fruity esters throughout. Finishes with lingering spice and malt. Very nice brew. Do not drink it ice cold; let it warm up a bit first to get the full effect."
"Would like to try side-by-side with some other classics (Westmalle, Karmeliet, etc)."
"The tripel is crisp and light on the tongue, with alcohol and apple notes dominating the taste. Even moreso as it warms. The aftertaste is a bit too sharp and dry for my liking, but the drinkability is good, it definately gets more complex as it warms and has enough going on that I could have more than one without losing interest."
"VERY happy to say I'm having this from my own tap. Pours a clear gold with a dense white head that soon dissipates to a thin layer and some nice lacing. Smells of lemons and pears, with a bit of spice in the background. Tastes sharp at first, then mellows into nice round fruits, pear and bananas. Finishes with a crispness and reminds me of a dry cider. Mouthfeel is full and a bit chewy at the end, its color belies its character. Drinkability is excellent, I fear the keg won't last long. I think the brothers have done a great job with this one. It's a fantastic crossover beer to get someone who has had a few hefes and whose curiosity is peaked into the Belgians. Just nice all-around."
"It starts pretty, and the rest of the experience is damned near as good. It's just what you'd expect if you had to conjure up the memory of a classic tripel. And in spite of the very warm ABV it's very and dangerously drinkable. Either that or everything goes down like silk when you're at Monk's. Still, with proper caution exercised, this is a great, even sessionable, beer that speaks historical volumes."
"Drinkability - This brew has all the characteristics you've come to expect from a Belgian Tripel. Give it a try, but don't expect an epiphany. Cheers!"
"Was able to try this beer on tap last evening. First time I have seen it on tap so I was quite excited. The brew had a slight haze to it and the color of golden yellow with a fair sized head that had some retention leaving some lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma was a nice mix of spices, light fruit flavors and a peppery property; this is a nice aromatic brew. The taste is excellent with highlights similar to what was noticed in the nose along with a good amount of carbonation. As the brew warmed I noticed different properties of flavors as the alcohol come out more along with what I think is a more pronounced yeast like flavor, could be wrong on this taste though. Over all this was a very enjoyable brew, one that I really should have more often."
"Drinkability: I like this Chimay, but not as much as the red or blue."
"Poured out of a 750ml caged and corked bottle. The color was a hazy copper, nice pillowy white head with some real nice lacing. The smell is wonderful, Beligan yeast, light candy. The taste is of sweet malt, some apple, a bit of hop to dry the aftertaste, very nice balance. This ale sits very well on the tongue, nicely carbonated for my taste. This is pretty much what I look for in a beer, a bit sweet, a bit bitter, very drinkable, though this will put you on your ass if you have enough of them."
"Nether-the-less and great beer and top class, perhaps though a little lower in that particular class."
"For me, this is the quintessential tripel. It tastes great on draft or in the bottle and ages quite well. While it isn't the best tripel that I've tried, it is certainly the most consistent and serves as a wonderful benchmark."
"Pours a golden honey color with a thick, fluffy white head that is long lasting with plenty of lacing. Smell was a mix of fruitiness and spiciness - mostly peaches, apricots, and cinnamon and cloves. Taste was similar to the smell, with most of the fruitiness upfront. Extremely easy to drink and tasty. Could have this one all night. A very good beer."
"And this was a very fresh brew, thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam. I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy direct from the brewer."
"750 ml. bottle - Color of clear golden honey  head thick , and white  nose of apricots , yeast , spices , cloves , and slight hopps  taste is yeast , bitter / sweet , copper , salty , musty , and citrus heavily carbonated , slightly oily body  aftertaste yeasty , bitter with earth tones , hopps , and egg whites"
"Nice beer, but won't be revisiting this one anytime soon at the price point."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The beer's texture and form in the mouth is flat out fantastic... it elevates the flavors and distributes the nuances across the tongue remarkably well. After swirling in all yeast sediment for the last minutes of this tasting, the mouthfeel became even creamier and fuller-bodied. Aromas of lemon peel came forth, and a more prominent general breadiness manifested. Glad to have tried this, but when I crave a tripel there are several that would come to mind before this."
"2005 33cl bottle. Excellent tripel. Aroma of pepper, tabacco, phenol, clove and orange. The aroma draws almost directly into the flavor with more prenouced phenol, clove and pepper, with just a hint of orange and tobacco followed by a mellow bitterness. The sprite carbonation plays great with the aroma, flavor and dryness of the beer. An well crafted beer!"
"This was an 11.2 oz bottle sampled in a Kappitel goblet. This was a supremely smooth, flavorful, and drinkable beer. The head retention was outstanding and the color and nose were both medium bodied and very pleasing. The taste was a mildly yeasty very malted graininess with a slight alcohol finish that was transitioned into seamlessly. Overall this was a tremendous beer that I will definitely explore again and again. I will next sample and review the Red & Blue, and even though the styles are different I'm looking forward to both. Recommended Very Highly."
"Overall a good beer, but the ten bucks for a large bottle makes it a rare purchase for me. However I would say its required drinking for any beer lover."
"This is one fantastic beer, but unfortunately one that I over look often. The Brother at Scourmont do a fantastic job at making beer (or at least the people in the other brewery that isn't in the walls....). Very enjoyable, and a great beer overall. I'm glad I got the chance to finally review this one. But if you buy this... do yourself a favor and pick up a small bottle. I have had terrible luck with the larger 750 mL's that are corked and caged. It seems like almost half of them have cork taint. This small bottle is one of the best of the Chimay white I've ever had. Normally I love the large bottles for other beers, but the chimay beers seem to have cork issues... at least in my area."
"Served in a Chimay glass, this beer pours a murky orange-brown color, with a big frothy white head. Nose is average for the style. The flavor was good, but not over whelmingly impressive. A little spicy, not as sweet as some other tripels I enjoy. Perhaps even a hint of hoppy bitterness? Certainly not what I was expecting to taste. Still, this is a respectable tripel, if not the best in class."
"The taste started sharply alcoholic, but quickly broadened into a smooth malty flavour  muted, though, and nondescript. The alcohol provided a nice warmth as it went down. Lively carbonation and medium body round out this competent tripel. It's good, but there are better tripels and Chimay's other styles are better."
"Up front there was a lot of thick sweet malt which was balanced off with the fruit-herbs and spice tones leaving an impression of frozen cinnamon bun dough with tangerine slices, mid palate these flavors evolve into a more complex taste senasation which is more spice pronounced then the long finish where gradual drying takes place and the phenominal hop mixture shows up to complicate the end of this drink by peppering it with metallic-fruity-medicinal-herbal tastes which fight against the near cloying malts and sugars...everything in balance on this drink...very pleasurable to sip on...particualrly on this damp chilly evening...thanks Rob...wonderful birthday gift...thanks."
"Pours a hazy deep amber with a decent head that dwindles and leaves a coat of foam. Hops are noted, moreso than with other tripels I've tried. The alcohol shows through as well. Nice carbonation and a surprise, but I much prefer the Grande Reserve (Blue)."
"Cloudy apricot colour, it pours a big head with big bubbles that lingers for a while. Complex arome of spices (coriander, clove, pepper) and fruits, with some hint of banana. Mouth feel is very nice, spicy, fruity (oranges, a hint of figs), some honey, flowery. Dry and bitter finish."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkable for a strong beer, but one is better off savoring this over an extended period."
"The mouthfeel is full of tiny, creamy bubbles, and the drinkability is really nice."
"D: To be sipped on and enjoyed at a very slow pace, sit and enjoy every drop"
"Den"
"Skoal"
"Each and every sip was a bit different. Sometimes, you'd get a good batch of candy sugar and ripe fruits. Others would be spicy. All were finished very boozy. Came off more sweet then I remembered the other variations being. Regardless, the carbonation kept it from becoming either syrupy or overly chewy. Besides how one might get distracted from the mouthfeel with the ETOH burn, the big bottle just sort of disappeared somehow..."
"750 ml corked and boailed bottle. The cork had a date of 04/05 on it. Dunno why I had never reviewed this before."
"33 cl bottle; reads LAO-023. Glorious looking beer, with a tower of white foam, golden hazyness, and lively carbonation. A hoppy bite to it, quite enjoyable with the spicy bubbles. Bready body like a fresh baked french baquette. Belgian yeast profile, no mistake about it. Just the slightest amount of sweetness. Bitter and peppery, very similar to Duval, but with a much rounder malt flavor. More and more accessible these days, so a great choice at the store or the bar. By far my favorite Chimay variety, but I'll have to pay the red and blue labels another visit soon. Cheers!"
"The aroma is pretty pungeant. I detect some grassiness and earthiness. There is some fruitiness thrown in too; from bananas and apricots. The taste is definitely unique with some light alcohol and lite hoppiness. The mouthfeel is tangy and full bodied."
"Drinkability is dangerously good. You would never know this one packs 8%. The taste lingers and gets better throughout the beer leaving you wanting more. This beer doesn't top Westmalle for me but it comes close."
"I'm not sure which I prefer: the first, milder, cleaner glass, or the second, yeasty, peppery and bitter glass. Both are great. And I hope to God that this review makes sense. I enjoy it on-tap, too, but the bomber is the gift that keeps on giving."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. Much better than I remember. Not a typical tripel, but very nice. Looking forward to having this again."
"D- This was very drinkable but I'm sure it would taste better if it had some time to age. I'll have to try it as soon as I establish a place to age."
"The taste starts with big citric wash of fruit and candy, mixed with an herbal bitterness and nice round malt. It turns dry and finishes long. Mouthfeel is creamy, active and smooth. Delicious, and slightly different than the larger bottle. The dryness doesn't clamp down on the sweet fruit as quickly, and the finish is not as dusty. Whether this is due to the characteristics of fermenting in different size bottles, or if it's because of slight variations in the brewing of the batches, who knows. Maybe I'm hallucinating. Anyway, I like em both."
"Drinkability: A session beer. Easy to drink. A real treat. Wish I was rich so that I could drink this more often."
"I will certainly purchase this again."
"Very nice beer. A true treat for all the senses. Pair this with a nice appetizer of braised pork tenderloin slices. Definite a very nice example of the style that everyone should try."
"Highly recommended."
"What a wonderful beer. Mmmm."
"Bottom line: This bottle of Chimay Cinq Cents is inspiring. I'm going to buy some more and sock away a few bottles for later enjoyment.(no mishandling of them...guaranteed!) Highly recommended!"
"Pours a golden cidery amber, nice head pure white good retention, leaving minor lacing. Sents of apple, some minor hops and belgian yeast. The taste is nice mild citrus and apple a tiny hint of candy, little bitterness from hops. I must admit I was bios for along time because chimay way my first experience with a tripel, but since I have found several I enjoy a little more . Any how this is still nice, but I'd rather drink others."
"Overall: Simply stated, excellent. It's an excellent beer for anyone who has never tried a Belgian Tripel before and is looking to make the leap. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
"I could drink this all night, until the alcohol caught up to me. The Peres Trappistes got it going on in the brew game."
"Overall: This beer was good. However, I doubt I will buy it again, unless I get it for a good deal. I simply have access to too many better beers."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. I'd have one or two of these ( 11.2 oz. servings, that is, or just one 750 ml. bottle ) every once-in-awhile."
"Perhaps not THE finest Belgian tripel in the world (jury's still out on that one), but certainly a quintessential example of how a great Belgian tripel can be liquid nirvana."
"Still, another well made beer from Chimay."
"D: Really just an excellent beer. Definitely worth the price I paid for it, and the time it took to make. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a sophisticated beer that really quenches the thirst."
"Served into Chimay goblet, with a beautiful golden/amber pour with a nice head that really hugs the glass. A perfect pairing of fruity sweetness balanced with hops with a great balance of bitter. A very effervescent mouthfeel and it leaves you wanting more. I couldn't be more happy that this is now on-tap in my area."
"Sweet caramalized liquid sugar sweetness hits the palate with a sharp dryness on the finish. Lifesavers orange candy, peach puree and sweet grains blend together. Nice hop presence. A solid Belgian Tripel."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability - a solid, tasty trippel. Doesn't have the constrasting flavors or the fuller mouthfeel of Westmalle or Karmeliet, but solid nonetheless."
"Overall and excellent brew. I'd have it again as long as I'm not paying $11.25 for an 8 ounce pour."
"Drinkability - Doubtful I would get again, I kinda am finding this to be a mediocre representation of what I like in tripel's."
"Drinkability/Overall: light and well-balanced, does well as a BSPA or a tripel, though more authentic as the former. One of the more drinkable of the 9 we sampled."
"Bottle pours a light brown which is non translucent . Smells of fruit , most oustanding is grape. Taste is sweet with grape and apples. Mouthfeels is light and quite dry with a quick finish. A very good beer which I could easily drink a few off. A bargain at about $4 for a small bottle."
"o.k., after trying cinq cents, premiere, and reserve i have decided that i am officially prejudiced in the favor of these monks. i think everyone should have a favorite abbey. this offering has a peachy coloring and slightly hazy look to it. i smell citrus and heavy spice. heavily carbonated with a head and lacing that will not quit. mouthfeel somewhat light for such a big beer. way too drinkable for such a high alcohol content. very dangerous."
"I enjoyed the Chimay triple, but I realised it was probably too strong for many who might be looking for a malty cream taste."
"Drinkability is not as good as the Chimay Red. Still a great beer."
"A good beer, but not my favorite tripel. The appearance and smell are very nice, but the taste just doesn't have the complexity of others. Additionally, the strong alcohol in the taste is troublesome. That said, I'll certainly give this another try."
"Overall a tremendous and eminently drinkable beer. Wow."
"Purchased this bottled at a gourmet food chain in town. Appearance-wise, rather cloudy and a pleasant shade of tan and golden-yellow; poured a large, lasting, creamy head that was almost three fingers wide and left a nice lace in its wake. Nicely carbonated (definitely not too gassy!) with a spicy aroma. Taste-wise, pleasantly heavy on the malt with a sweet and buttery flavour that nicely masked the bitter aftertaste. On the whole, a pretty full-bodied and complex beer with nice hop notes. Very drinkable. My first tripel, and definitely not my last."
"IMO - of the three ""colors"" of Chimay, this is just ahead of the red and just behind the blue - but, all three are delightfully exquisite."
"Overall: Good all around. Recommended."
"Quite drinkable, almost sessionable except for the alcohol. Go get some now."
"I love a tripel and this is one of the best."
"Served in a chalice at The Old Monk, in Texas. Appearance was pale gold in color, with a moderate head which subsided into lacing over time. The aroma consisted of yeast & malt, but the hops really came through for a Belgian. Some spicy notes were also present. The taste was slightly sweet at first, with a good hop balance which was present more in the finish. I also picked up some clove/pepper towards the end. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a body that seemed lighter than the bottled version (which I would call medium bodied) and somewhat more carbonated. Warmth from the alcohol was present, but fairly well hidden. Drinkability was high, and I would consider this beer a troublemaker in that you are unlikely to realize the ABV from the taste."
"a classic."
"D - Drinkable. A very nice brew from Chimay, would recommend."
"Well I've maybe only had around 50 total beers, but this one I could just not get a handle on. As I was drinking this I could not come up with a way to describe the taste or smell. Yes my palate is inexperienced, but this was also my first Trippel. It was definitely sweet, but I had a hard time picking out individual flavors. The appearance is a fairly clear gold with a huge fluffy white head, whether you try to pour for the head or not, it's still going to be huge. The taste as I can describe it is only sweet. But you could tell there is the faintest of hops at the very back end which may be Saaz? but really I'm not sure. This bottle was loaded with yeast, and since I had to pour about half the bottle, and then wait to pour the rest, the yeast was stirred up and towards the end what I had was a very cloudy beer with tons of yeast in suspension. That definitely seemed to change the flavor to give it more of a ""twang"" but it was still good. This was still very enjoyable especially at 8% alcohol you definitely aren't going to be complaining."
"D - Really easy to drink...almost tooo easy ::shifty eyes::. I look forward to buying another bottle as soon as the store opens. Cheers!"
"Beautiful, hazy, gold/orange color with half-inch head and good retention. The aroma is spicy, citrus-like and right on for the style. Taste is also lemony and spicy, with a mild phenolic and peppery bite. Lightly tart but overall a good range and balance of flavors. Alcohol is not too noticible. Mouthfeel has a medium body with a nice creaminess to it. Perfect carbonation. I love Belgian Tripels and this one it a classic example with enough complexity that you can't pass it up."
"one of my favorite tripels, pours with good head that reduces slightly faster than some other tripels that laces nicely, sweet slightly darker than golden color. Classic tripel taste and smell, slightly citric, hints of spices and some other fruits. Has that nice kind of sticky mouthfeel that stays around for a while. A beer that I will continously buy despite my low wage over and over."
"This beer was not bad, and I'm glad to see it on tap, but it's my least favorite tripel thus far (I've only had a few) as well as my least favorite Chimay."
"fairly delicious with the bitter quality."
"Eric"
"The mouth feel is medium bodied thats backed by a huge presence of micro-bubble carbonation."
"Here's a Belgian ale that's closest to the style I like. So, I imagine if you're a hop head this will be a closest Belgian to your preferences."
"Plenty of body with a somewhat velvety mouthfeel and ample alcohol make this beer a pleasant sipper. Another quality Belgian that knows this style all too well. Tastes great on-tap, but it puts a dent in your wallet...cheers!"
"No sir, this Chimay tripel didn't do anything for me at all. It does all mellow out towards the bottom of the glass, but it all still doesn't come together very cohesively."
"Drinkability: This is very drinkable and would be excellent with a meal. Finishes so clean and it's smooth, it's warming and well balanced, but very flavorful and palate cleansing."
"Drinkability  I dont know what it wasbut something rubbed me the wrong way here. I found this one a little tougher to finish than most Tripels."
"All in all, it wouldn't be my first pick for a tripel. It smells fantastic, but just doesn't live up to it in the taste department. Not bad overall but not one of the greats."
"This tripel poured a hazy, amber color with white foam that settled, clinging and leaving lace on the glass. The smell was a typical tripel aroma of Belgian malt with touch of vinousness. The taste was fruity with light Belgian maltiness and a very light sweetness. There was also some vinous malt flavors and a kiss of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and dry overall with only a hint of sweetness. The body was medium with good carbonation. The finish was lightly malty and slightly hoppy. This was a very nice, enjoyable tripel."
"Overall, a decent Tripel. However, there are much better beers out there that represent the style."
"Not bad. Not as good as I remember this being though. Maybe age it longer? Or was it b/c I loved it on draft so much?"
"Same 330ml bottle as the blue and red. White label with ""Tripel"" on it. Tasted at cellar temperature in my chalice glass. Aggressive carbonation right from the cap-popping, this poured loudly into the glass forming a thick off-white head that receded fairly quickly. The beer's colour is amazing: deep nectarine-juice and light orange with the softest hue of caramel-brown. The head is consistent at a thin layer though the tightness seems a little lacking. Good sheets of bubbly lacing. Aroma of white sugar and plenty of phenols. Actually the beer smells very much like the yeast-strain of Unibroue's beers. Sourish malts, green apple, and candy sugar. Dusty malts, with lots of yeasty notes. Some woody, resinous and almost faintly smoky smells in there as well. The aroma is very sugary, but also very salty. A delightful smell, just not as complex as I imagined it would be, and it's a little too high on the sugar notes. The initial smell when the head is full is very good though: kind of like the warming, nearly alcoholic smell of fresh rising bread or even fermenting grapes. The taste is quite extraordinarily bitter from beginning to end. Seriously, the hopping is quite predominant at least in mouthfeel and it leaves a dry but sugary/salty aftertaste. One of the bitterest tripels I have had. Excellent fresh hopping. The malts are supportive, but add only little flavouring. Again, the saccharine sweetness feels just too assertive for this tripel. It becomes a little cloying, and it's all I can seem to feel in the mouth after a while. Some fruity notes come though, such as pear and green grapes. Again, this is tasty, but hardly outstanding as far as Belgian tripels go. Fairly high carbonation and a full body. Drinkable, but the sugar in this beer really does distract from its character. Thank goodness we have the blue and red. For a tripel, this was just a tad disappointing from such a great Trappist brewery, even if they are the biggest and most commercial."
"The bottom line is that the this beer seems to do everything pretty decently, but I'm still not sure if it's worth the price. Once the beer has warmed I would put the flavour up to 4, but it starts out only 3, so I have to average the two scores. Solid stuff in any case."
"Pours a cloudy gold-tinted orange. Head fills the glass then slowly forms a large rocky head and leaves a stubborn patchwork of lace. Pilsener malt and fusels in the nose, but mostly medicinal phenols and powdery yeast. The taste is sweet with pilsener malt and wheat, belgian phenols like bananas and medicine, and a yeasty background. Dry aftertaste, spicy cloves and candi sugar alcohol burn, and faint goldings hop notes. Medium-full body and medium carbonation. A smooth, dry and tart mouthfeel, and flambouyant example of the style. The high sweetness is balanced by the alcoholic bite and solid hop bitterness that presents itself in the finish to combat residual sweetness. A flambouyant example of the style, and very easy to drink!"
"I am a big fan of Whitbeir and this is a superb example. I purchased this 750ml bottle for around $8 at a large wine and beer store. It came highly recomended from the assistant manager, and I must say that I agree in its quality. The bottle appearance is classy with its champaigne style cork closure and the Trappist seal to ensure its quality. The beer smells of cofee and muted bananas with a sweet spice similar to cloves. Phenols are evident but not overpowering. The strain of yeast isolated by ""Father Theodore"" is definately at the heart of this beer, and provides at taste and aroma that set the standard for this category of beer. The taste is similar to the smell with coffee, muted banana, chocolate, clove and alcohol flavors. The alcohol is muted, and only manifests itself if the brew is allowed to rest too long on the palate. Lingering bitter on the edges of the tounge. Medium to heavy mouthfeel but not syrupy. Medium heavy carbonation and lingering lacing, creamy tan durable head stays with you till the end of the glass. Not extremely drinkable, I finished the whole bottle but I won't want another one for a while. Overall, a very highly recomended beer."
"Having one just makes me want another...OK, yes . I did have a few. This is a great brew."
" Overall, a decent triple. Other than the price, I would say this is quite drinkable."
"Served in a 750 mL bottle. Pours a orange/golden color with a decent head that stays around for a while. Taste is slightly bitter, slightly sweet. There is a lot of carbonation. This beer has a decent drinkability, I can drink the 750 but wouldn't drink two at a time. The alcohol says that it is 8%, but it doesn't taste like it is. Bought for $10 a bottle, I would not buy this all the time, but it definitely worth a drink once in a while"
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, a little boring and underwhelming."
"from a mix pack of the three most common Chimays. orangy and clear. big white head. malty, biscuity odor. very pungent. smooth taste that becomes harsh on the back end. malty and spicy and some alcohol up front. nothing special for the style....maybe i just like my tripels to be bigger and meaner."
"This poured a hazy golden yellow with some sediment, excellent lacing, great retenion of a large white head, a fair ammount of carbonation. Definitely some phenols to start, banana, candy sugar, yeast, mild citrus, malt, alcohol, lots more I can't wrap my finger around. This carries over to the taste, along with some mild spice. The mouthfeel was slightly acidic but blended out into a smooth and satisfying mildness. The carbonation didn't get in the way as I had remembered when I had this the first time. Overall very drinkable and a great enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: Certainly a pretty good example of the style in my opinion. This is becoming a style that many folks are messing around with, but Chimay (obviously) knows what they're doing. Not my favorite example of the style, but I'd certainly go back to this."
"Appeared a somewhat hazy godlen color with a small white head. Retention was excellent with tiny air bubbles on the rise, overall quite nice. Smell was of light fruits such as pears, apples, figs, passionfruit, also a bit of a musty smell going on as well. Taste was fruity with hints of honey, banana and clove leading into a rather spicy peppery profile, leaving a balance of sweetness and spice. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with mild carbonation and a good dosage of hoppy goodness. This beer was very well executed, the balance was damn close to perfect, I could drink up many in one sitting. Overall this is a fantastic beer, full of complex flavors...I would let it warm a bit to let some of the fainter tastes pull through."
"Mouth: Not nearly as sweet as it smells with a lasting bitter taste in the back of the mouth after swallowing. The sweetness lasts well on the tongue as well, so you're left with a very balanced after taste. It's creamy and spicy upon exhaling."
"this brew tastes a bit like an accessible, semi-sec Orval ... it's probably best paired with some stew or soft cheese ..."
"Fairly enjoyable for the style, but not one of my favorite styles to be sure..."
"Taste; Very malty, with bread dough and somei caramel. There's a little orangey citrus and honey, and a slightl yeasty funkiness. The coriander and peppery spices come out as this gets closer to room temp, along with some more fruitiness, such as pears and pineapples. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a touch on the creamy side. Drinkability is nice, but takes a hit due to a the sweetness being a bit to high for my tastes, without any bitterness to balance it out."
"My Chimay Cinq Cents , poured into a chimay chalice , was a hazy , deep orange/aburn , with a 2 inch, rocky off-white head. Heaps of lace left on the majestic chalice. Some sweet and clean smells like apple and pair ,slight phenols, bit of malt and slight yeast twang. The apple qualities continue in the flavor , more tart though , musky yeast , tinge of hidden alchohol, and fairly foward hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamed up by the carbonation but remains crisp. A pleasant Trappist Tripel , though i do find some of the others more intersting."
"Had this on tap at Taco Mac. Little to no head and no lacing. Appearance was very cloudy. Might be because it was served waaay too cold. Very strong aroma of yeast and fruit. Couldn't really smell pure hops, but plenty of fruit. Nice long finish, but could taste more of the alcohol than I would've liked. Not a great representative of the tripel style, still good."
"M&D: soft mouthfeel on top of the dryish flavour, the contrast is just great, while the gentle and constant fizziness provides a healthy body for the palate to absorb the full flavour. All in all, a dry and bitter Tripel. Not my favourite, but a nice one all the same."
"The first distinctive element is a formidable head that looks as thick and rich as mousse. I understand that this is a common characteristic of Tripels. Below this mighty crown is a cloudy orange color and multiple trails of bubbles streaming to the surface. The aroma of this brew is complex and dominated with a caramel scent. The first sip is alive with a texture of flavors, including malty sweetness at the tip of the tongue and balancing bitter tastes at the sides and back of the mouth. Along with these dominant sensations are hints of spices. Mouthfeel is pleasantly creamy for a beer that seems so light. The more sips I take, the more flavors seem to come out, and the delicate dance between bitterness and sweetness is decidedly enjoyable, finishing in a very pleasant and lingering bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is fairly high but not overpowering, and warming brings out more subtle flavors. This is the kind of beer one wants to sip slowly and enjoy over a long period of time, which is a good thing as it is also deceptively strong."
"with each taste. Very refreshing and enjoyable--a classic trippel."
"Overall, a good tripel with a taste I would expect from the style but with more dry finish than most domestic representations. A good experience but I like the taste of the cheaper domestic versions of the style just as much if not more."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable, and on-tap this more enjoyable than the bottled version."
"D - This beer isn't great. I can think of several tripels I would sooner have. Chimay Red and Blue are delectable, but this is one to pass up. I couldn't session it, but the bitterness might help wash down some foods."
"This was by far the worst of the big three Chimays for me. I don't know if I got a bad bottle, but I will sample again in the near future and adjust my scores accordingly."
"Drinkability  Well, this ale was served way too cold, but once it warmed up it did just right by me. It went down smoothly if a tad over-carbonated and had a nice yeasty backbone, which I enjoy in the style."
"-Adam"
"The mouthfeel of this beer is like nothing I've ever had. It is beautiful. It is as if all these big bubbles push down on your tounge at once and then jump off it in unison never to be seen again. Then the liquid even lightens on the tounge and I begin to question if there is even beer in my mouth at all anymore. Very cool. This single quality, along with the floral aroma, make this beer a real etherial experience. I've never been a Chimay fan really, but I never met this lovely lady they call Cinq Cents. Somethings very special about this beer."
"Murky caramel-copper color. Off white cap that dissipated quickly with some lacings along surface. Aroma was malty sweet with hints of fruit, brown sugar and syrup. Grainy and yeasty. Bouquet was above medium. Taste is lightly sweet at with notes of citrus and yeast. Citrus and floral hops grabs almost right away with a pungency to mellow out the sweetness. A little peppery also. Carbonation is alive and filling, giving this a medium body. Finishes dry with a pleasant and refreshing aftertaste. Even though I favor the Grand Reserve Blue over this Great Beer!!"
"On tap at Monk's Cafe. The beer poured a golden copper color with a thick white head and active carbonation. There is a nice malty, yeast aroma to this beer with some citrus notes. The taste is sweet malty with some citrus bite. The beer has a medium body that is refreshing."
"Easy to recommend this one."
"It is a darker color of copper with a wonderfully rich creamy head leaving an excellant ring and spotty lacing on the glass. Yeasty aromas come through, as well as biscuits, bread, clove, nutmeg, and banana. Taste is much of the same with the alcohol hidden very well and just a bit of hop presence in the finish. Medium body with light carbonation that tingles nicely on the tongue. Very nice to drink, always a solid choice."
"Only downside is that I paid $6.50 for a 11.2 ounce bottle at a conference center but it sure beats my other choices: Miller Lite, Corona, Becks."
"In terms of drinkability, it is very filling so its difficult to warrant drinking several of them, but the overall experience is good enough for it to be in the better than average category."
"A nice beer. Not world class but very enjoyable."
"A decent brew. It is a little high priced but worth a try."
"The alcohol wasn't hidden well, and I didn't like the aftertaste. I was hoping this would be compare well to the Westmalle Tripel I had several days ago, but this fell well short."
"In comparison to the red and blue, the white falls a bit short. While still a quality beer, the alcohols get a little out of balance. The look is still a nearly perfect sight, the aromas pick up on a tart, spicy, alcohol that begins to dominate the delicate malt flavors. The fuitcake flavors and malts take a back seat to a rum-like flavor. A bitter flavor and feel hits the back of the throat and becomes a little husky. The muskiness and boldness of the beer still contributes to complexity and variety. I just prefer the red and blue."
"This beer popped open and almost took my eye out before I even got the metal thing twisted complety off. This is the best looking bier I have seen in a while and leaves a pillowy white head on top with a lacing that ""just won't quit"". Smells fruity, hoppy, and clovey. It has a fairly suddle scent to it. The flavor is dominated by hops. It tastes fruity as well , but dominated by hops. I can see where it would taste awsome if I could get more fruity smell and taste to it. I wonder why it was so dominated by hops."
"The Belgian monks who brew this are quite clever. Down enough Chimay, and suddenly that whole celibacy vow thing doesn't seem half bad!"
"Pours a hazy apple cider amber/orange into my Chimay chalice, huge white rocky head forms, settles down after a few minutes with tons of lace. Smell is very citrusy, lots of yeast, iron, honey, bread. Taste is sweet, citrus bitterness, orange peel, spice, yeast, iron. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, little bit cloying."
"This was one of the first beers I purchased after NC lifted the abv cap to 15%. I'm just now getting to review it because I've been spending all my money on the hundreds of new beers that have appeared since then! This beer pours a hazy orange/gold color that is very appealing to the eye. The aromas wafting from my Duvel chalice are of sweet malts and citrusy/resiny hops. The taste is sweet at first, but then I can detect a little bit of sourness also. There is a slight alcohol taste, but otherwise this beer is very drinkable. The sweet Belgian character is present throughout. This was a 750ml bottle that I bought for $5.99. Not a bad deal in my opinion."
"Like the aroma, the first thing detectable in the flavor is a sly sweetness. A smooth malty character is evident, and also a smokey element, something like fruit wood smoke. As I'm drinking this I just can't get over the wisp of smokey flavor you get after you swallow a sip, it's not strong and in-your-face, but once you notice it's there it can't be denied. A crisp clean opening with a very Earthy finish."
"Of all the Chimay beers this is probably my least favorite. The beer poured a nice golden color with a great white head that lasted till the last sip. The smell was quite skunky to begin with but it melowed out within a few minutes. The flavor was nice and crisp but lacked the depth that I expected from the brew. The tart hops were in effect and once I poured the yeast into the mix it helped things out a but but oveall a bland yet drinkable beer. Worth the price? no. Go with the Grand Reserve if you are going to go Chimay. But if you like slightly skunky brews witht decent characther, then give it a try."
"Although I like this beer, I think that I like the blue and red better. Dont get me wrong, it is some mighty fine brew! I straightforwardly favor the other two over this one."
"The beer pours almost a cider color with a huge frothy head that holds fantastically and laces well. The smell is not all that strong but there are some sweet scents coming through. Theses sweets smells could possibly be cherries and grapefruit. The taste is a bit more formidable. Again it is very sweet but there is also a large amount of alcohol. It feels thick and well carbonation and overall is another good belgian."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and actively carbonated."
"Taste was dry, adstringent of the dryness and bitterness. Typical tripel beer, yet different than e.g. Westmalle or Rochefort, because of the high fermentation grade, bitterness and flavours produced by the yeast. A very good Trappist beer from Belgium."
"Pours a slightly cloudy medium orange with reasonably sized white head, rather fizzy, that dissipates fairly slowly and leaves a little lacing. Smells quite spicy, lots of pepper, with lots breadiness and some light fruits. Sweet apple and honey. Alcoholic overtones are obvious. Very bold and interesting, but not on par with the best tripels in terms of complexity. Taste is bitter upfront, lots of spicy hops and coriander. Apple, buttery tones, and a bit of breadiness make an appearance in the middle before the alcohol becomes apparent in the finish. Very dry. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with good carbonation. Drinkability is solid. A very good, if not spectacular, tripel. Well worth revisiting."
"I love the look of this beer. Huge, dense head. Orange cloudy colour. Little bits of sediment yeast floating around. So peaceful to look at. Sweet smell of malts, oranges, cloves, pepper, and cider. Taste starts sort of sweet and sour. Plenty of malts mingling with green apple skins and citrus fruits, with a bit of a spicy kick on the tip of the tongue. Leaves mildly bitter, with a floral taste. Very thick, very smooth mouthfeel. I like it."
"Big bodied with a nice mouthfeel. Hop bite to it. A little astringency and graininess to this beer as well. The least enjoyable of the Chimays but a great beer."
"Taste is crisp, spicy finish that goes down smooth and hides the alcohol well. I love the extreme bitterness, if your a hop head like myself, your will find this beer extremely tasty. I would love to have another one of this beer but the availiability is low around my area. A beer that should be enjoyed not drunk."
"This is quite a complex beer. The aromas and flavors are interesting, but not my favorite and I got tired of it before the stubby was empty. I will be happy to have this beer every once in a while."
"Pours a cloudy deep gold with a huge head, good retention and very good lace. Smells of yeasty wheat malt with some citrus spicyness. Yeasty and bitter taste. Upfront sweetness followed by the citrus bitterness. Hop spicy. Alcohol well hidden. I am not much of a hop head so this one does not appeal to me much but a decent brew none the less."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange colour with a dense white medium head. No lacing but the head reduces to a nice white cap. Awesome aroma on opening the bottle. Fresh, spicy and fruity (oranges, apples, bananas, green grapes), but also musty and yeasty. Flavour is fairly sharp and sweet. Tastes of sweet, toasty, cakey malt; yeasty fresh and dried fruits; and spicy, herbal and citrusy hops. Right on style I would say. Mouthfeel is fizzy but appropriate. Very enjoyable. Probably best to leave the yeast in the bottle next time."
"Slightly hazy and a deep gold colour, this beer poured into a chalice with a large, fluffy, white head that showed good retention and clumpy lacing. There was a strong bready yeast aroma at first, with lemon and mild spice appearing along with candy-like character after a short time. Significant bitterness was balanced by sugary sweetness. Citrus and yeast also contributed by the mid. There was a slightly rough alcohol flavour and burn at the end, followed by a peppery finish with lingering hops. As it warmed to room temperature, this roughness disappeared. The high carbonation seemed to add some acidity. Light bodied with a bit of slickness and aggressive alcohol warmth overall. Not bad at all, but it seems a little rough around the edges. Maybe some aging will smooth it out a bit."
"Poured to an attractive amber with little yeast floaties and a easy forming foamy white head. Smell is slightly acidic, but not offensive. Taste is yeasty, slightly bitter, but really smooth. Abundantly carbonated, alcohol well hidden, a nice brew, but I prefer the Red over this one."
"Don't like it much. Too bitter without a good flavour balance. It just doesn't make my mouth happy."
"D - Makes you want more wuite a bit. I'm not a huge tripel fan but this one gives you a strong beer that can still be a little bit of a quencher with it's light body. The spiciness in the taste and aftertaste provide an intrigue that helps the drinkability on this one."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange into a Chimay chalice. The head is a thick and creamy white, with excellent lacing and retention. Smell was that very particular Chimay yeast strain, slightly sour, spices, hint of banana. Taste was sweet bubble gum up front, with a bready middle, and a pleasant piney hops in the finish. Quite fizzy in the mouth, but not inappropiate or overpowering. The flavours blend from one to the next very slowly and it is definitely a beer I'll be savouring for a good half hour at least."
"Her taste is bitter, floral, with some shy sweet notes that comes from the malt. Bread flavors are present with floral and spicy notes that comes to form a ""tout""."
"An excellent triple. I would drink this regularly, bu La Fin is cheaper in my area"
"A dry yeast ad wheat flavor leads followed by a bitter yet balanced hopping merged together by an acrid bitterness at the far outside edges of the tongue. Except for that bitterness, this is pretty good, but not great. A hint of sweetness picks up later on as the bitterness dies away."
"D- The beer is a nice light refreshing beer with a bit more body. The finish has a bitter quality to it that interferes with the soft fruit and spice qualities."
"overall: a magnificent beer, very complex and satisfying."
"Pours a nice dark honey color with a rich thick head that dissipates into thick lacing for the rest of the brew. At first the nose was overpowered with alcoholness, but as it sat a little I was able to smell other things. Sweet malts with some hops, some fruitiness and mild spices (cloves? coriander?). Taste starts off very complex and nice and quickly dives into severe alcohol and bittery sour flavors. Prior to the abyss, a nice balance resides with smooth lightly toasty malts, nice melange of fruits and spice, and a tiny bit of hops. But, after a split second all this is shattered by the immense bitterness and alcoholness. I've had many high octanes before that mask the ABV very well. This one is mediocre in that respect."
"First Chimay ever. Poured a nice golden color with a slight orange hue. Nice fluffy white head Which lasted quite a while. The aroma offered a few citrus notes. Bubbles did rise from the bottom of the glass after the initial pour. The alcohol presence was noticeable but did not take away from any of the sweet malt taste and the yeast flavors that dominate. When I frothed it up on the pallet, it exploded with banana and coriander. Very good Ale and this Chimay lived up to everything I have heard. Cheers"
"up front, no surprise in the taste. not unlike other tripels. however the finish is almost cabernet savignon, dry and strong. tasty, but no la fin du monde. the aftertaste is a little puckering, maybe this is best with food, not alone."
"Overall this is a very wonderful beer. A fitting example of why the trappist beers are so widely respected and in demand. This isn't the best trappist brew, in my opinion. But if a beer this good isn't the best, that should point out to you the quality of beers that come from the monasteries. I'd seek this one out again."
"This is definitely the best beer ever made. Enough said. If you like champagne, then this is the one. I love beers that are strong, but when I had this I was overwhelmed. I will never over rate Chimay unless someone actually makes a better beer than this. This is this the first beer that you want to drink without getting drunk on."
"This is slightly heavier than expected and the alcohol is more pronounced than I have experienced in some other triples. This is a good tasting beer and enjoyable but was expecting more. Maybe my expectations got in the way of my objectivity on this one."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice given I lack the proper hardware. Nice hazy gold color. A little bit of lacing with a relatively thing head that forms little ""islands."" Nice, sharp hoppy smell. Wheaty with some copper overtones. Maybe a hint of corriander??? Taste is complex, again, hops... wheat, lemon, corriander, bit of a copperish taste as well. Very good. Glides across my tongue and finishes with a nice little whisp of the alcohol but not too strong. Overall a nicely balanced beer that is pretty easy to drink. Two thumbs up."
"Overall: A decent tripel, but not mind-blowing especially for the money."
"I was really impressed with this one. I had heard that the white label Chimay was the weakest of the three, but the well-balanced flavor and excellent drinkability really won me over. Worth a buy."
"after watching that episode of the daily show i can't make myself pour beers into their proper glasses, it just seems to nerdy. but lo and behold they still taste good!! pours a hazy gold with a massive head that looks almost like shaving cream! lots and lots of lacing. has mild spices in the nose, but an overall good whole, clean, smell. the taste is very unique. almost reminds me of a hefe at points. spices, malts, etc. can't taste the alcohol at all. very creamy and smooth with a nice finish. pretty damn good beer if you ask me! alex sure does like it!"
"""Orange-red color, thick foamy white head. Head leaves thick lacing around the edge of the glass. Sweet aroma w/strong hop presence. Interesting & engrossing. Great Belgian flavor, soft sweetness up front with a bitter finish, foamy & wonderful to savor. As it warms, it releases a stronger hop presence. Mouthfeel very good, foamy & with a nice coat to the throat. Overall drinkability okay; I like to have one or two but not more."""
"After having the beer set down in front of me, the first noticable and apparent thing about the beer was it's yellow/orange, cloudy hue. The beer boasted a big 1 1/2", chunky head that dissipated a few minutes after being served. The aroma was overall excellent with some excellent fruit tones and a layer of spiciness. The flavor began with a fruity tartness that ends with a very well balanced hoppiness. The finish also leaves a hint of the alcohol flavor there too, but it's not as apparent as an 8.0 ABV beer could be. The mouthfeel was of a medium body, which doesn't hinder or help the drinkability of the beer, which is on the higher side because of the tastiness and excellent aroma of the beer. Overall, a high quality beer that I will be reaching for again, just not too excited to be paying a $7.50 for a single serving again."
"D: Really is exceptional, considering the strength!"
"This beer has a great taste. I am not sure how to describe what it tastes like. All I can say is that I really like the way it tastes. It feel great as it goes down and is carbonated perfectly. As to the drinkability I would definitely buy this beer again and look forward to the day when I can try Chimay red and blue as well."
"Drinkability. Drinking one is no problem. I'm not inclined to drink two in a row, at least by itself. The sweetness is not to my liking, but perhaps it just needs the perfect complementary food pairing. In any event, at 8% abv and $4 a bottle, I'm unlikely to ever drink two at once."
"This is a nice sipping beer--despite its strength, I'd happily have a couple of moderate servings in succession, though I really need some better glassware for this one. There's nothing really wrong with it, and it's certainly a tasty, pleasant beer, but it doesn't really knock my socks off. It's enough of an introduction to the Tripel style to make me want to try more, which speaks highly in its favor."
"Pours a medium-gold, cloudy color with an off-white head. In my chalice, it's looks rather elegant and somewhat divine. I detect the following: fruit, spice, and a variety of malts. Very appealing. The taste is delightful; flavor bursting through with each sip. Upfront I taste fruit bitterness followed closely by spices and the intensity of the spices mixing with the carbonation. No one taste dominates the beer, despite the presence of several distinct flavors. My mouth is left with a bready texture and some residual bitterness. I think this is a great beer, but difficult to have several of because of it's potency, but very enjoyable, nonetheless."
"Notes: another magnificent brew from Chimay (hard to say which one I like more: red or white)"
"I've had the other Chimay's and really, really enjoyed them. This one blew my socks off with the taste, it's really beyond words. My entire day is much better having drank this beer."
" The smell is nice and blended. I think that the yeast has added a complex fruitiness to the smell. Tough to say, as this is my first bottle. Dry, Belgian malt is there too. The taste is great. Again, I think the yeast has added to this beer. I would have liked to have that option, though. The mouthfeel is light to me. Drinkability is high, mainly because this is a very non-offensive beer. I think this would be a good beer to convert someone with (evil laughter follows)."
"Pours a bright clear copper with a mammoth off-white head, excellent retention, great lacing. Nose is spicey with cloves, pepper, and other spices coming through over a slightly yeasty lemon and grapefruit citrus. The nose carries over to the taste, with a sweet and just slightly tart fruitiness upfront--orange peels, lemon, pears, green grapes followed by a big peppery spiciness that goes into a dry and slightly alcoholic finish with a linger clove note and a slight bit of bitterness. Nice flavors, but not quite as full and complex as some other great tripels I've had. Medium/full bodied, moderate carbonation, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. There's nothing at all wrong with this beer, but with the hefty Trappist pricetag, I think there are better Belgian beers I can buy for the same price."
"This was a beer whose character did not live up to the promise of it's appearance. I dated a girl like that once."
"Overall, it's a very nice beer. It doesn't astonish me - this isn't a reassess-your-outlook -on-life kind of beer. But it is very nice. And sometimes nice is a pretty good option to have, right?"
"I gave it the 5 on drinkability cuz this brew is a powerhouse. After two of them I felt it good."
"This beer is the total package, a true feel good beer."
"This one's a bit disappointing--it's a nice cloudy, orange haze with a great head and lacing, however, the alcohol is not balanced with the hops and malts like some other bigger beers. I may order this one again, but with all these other great ones coming to the Tarheel state, it may be a while."
"This beer has a nice piquant quality- somewhat dry, somewhat tart, but not astringent. There is a restrained sweetness. It whetted my appetite. It is citrusy, with spicy notes lasting into the finish. Wonderful balance, and a wonderful experience to finally have this beer two blocks from my house."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable, I usually can kick back quite a few tripel's though"
"There are many other tripels I'd choose before choosing this one, but it's a good brew."
"Not enough going on too keep me interested. If I were drinking in this price range for a night, I would order something else. There are better belgian beers that are also cheaper, Trappist or not."
"cheers..."
"This was too tart for me but I will reserve my opiion on an in date bottle"
"Pours a cloudy, yellowish-amber hure with a thick, frothy white head...a nice looking ale. Aroma: hints of corriander, nutmeg and phenols with traces of diacetyl, very spicy to the nose with background of sweet and toasted malt. The taste is very complex and begins with a spiced (again, nutmeg, corriander, and clove) and medicinal character upfront and follows with a fruity, yeasty character with hints of lemon rind and granny smith apples, and then a mild hop-tea like hops to balance out the malt. Very interesting, complex and well constructed but overall not a standout. I think the spice gives way to phenolic flavors too easily and the beer suffers. Mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation and a medium body. The finish is dry and lightly medicinal. Drinkability is OK. Definately not my favorite tripel but a solid, complex beer."
"A good tripel. Poured out to a dark and cloudy brown amber color with a long lived head and some notes of lace around the glass. Good medium-high carbonation. Odors of spice and earth are noted, as are some hints of grain and floral notes. Taste was slightly bitter, with flavors of dry nutmeg, spoiled citrus fruit and some earth. A unique combination, that does well. Finished crisp and clear, with a malty and hop aftertaste. A solid offering in the wake of the over-saturated and poorly developed tripel style. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is bubbley and chewy and very well-rounded. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Overall tasty and drinkable, but I'd rather spend less money and get a whole lot more Hennepin."
"($8.99 / 25.4 oz / 75 cl tall straight brown ""Chimay"" embossed champagne style bottle, corked, and caged)"
"This is a very nice tripel. Well balanced and not wearing it's alcohol content on it's sleeve, it goes down pretty easy. I could probably drink several of these in the course of an evening, which would probably mess me up quite well. It's nice that the most available Belgian Tripel is a consistently tasty one as well."
"Opinion: I think that this is a smooth and well-blended beer. I personally prefer the Tripels that are more assertive and citrus like, but this is an excellent beer."
"I feel I should like it more than I do. It has hidden complexity, that I'd like to explore, but for now, this only stays in the ""alright"" group."
"Appearance truly inviting, I started the 2 hour gobble session with a chimay tripel and this was an excellent choice. Very smooth, oily, easy to drink and appreciate. I detected some cherry flavor in the background that left a bit of an aftertaste but fairly cleansing. Very Bold flavors. They dont screw around with this puppy. Beautiful then BAM! then fades graciously as you ponder life. hahaaa great beer and definitely one I could go back to back on."
"Appearance is a cloudy yellow with a foamy head and sticky lace. Aroma is of fruit, creosote, yeast and malt. Body is medium to light with carbonation that goes with the texture. Initial taste is of the bitter hops and soft yeastiness  followed by candied fruitcake, banana esters, malt, phenols and honey. Finish is as dry as it is clean."
"750 mL bottle in a tulip glass. Pours an oversized forthy head, in which even the foam has an alcoholic taste, and a pleasant hop note to the smell. A golden hazy body. Once I get past the foam, I find a slight lactic tang among citrus notes and the mouthfeel of a Squirt soda. A delicate, balanced bitterness and the hint of orange peel at the end. Its just great for relaxing to in the recliner."
"Actually drank this out of a Chimay chalice so I get bonus points. Pours a darkish, cloudy, dirty orange, with copper edges. Medium-sized, creamy, slathering, cream white head. I like dirty orange beer! Nose is yeast like crazy, along with secondary fruity (banana) liquer, some wheat tang, faint peppery spice. Toasty and bitter up front, but quickly gives way to syrupy tropical fruits and berry liquor. Yeast is there too (which I don't mind). Sweetish with traces of bitterness in the finish. Medium-full bodied and not cloying. Not bad, but definitely not the best Trappist ""Tripel."""
"Poured from the 11.2 oz stubby bottle. Deep, cloudy, nearly opaque gold, with a huge off-white head that will keep you company through most of the glass. Nose of sweat bready malt and some tart grapes. The taste is sweet and quite spicy up front, with white grapes again detectable. Thick, spicy, pleasant mouthfeel. Finish is bitter with a bit of alcoholic zing. Really nice beer to treat yourself (and your friends - buy the magnum) to."
"I would pair this with fish and butter dishes, seafood suchas scallops and lobster, asparagus, perhaps thanksgiving turkey if you are adventurous."
"Not as good as blue (Grand Reserve) but a good beer none the less. Now.... On to the red!!"
"Ths brew pours a dirty straw color with a 3 finger head that falls to a healthy coat over the top of the liquid. The nose is light orangey with an almost soapy quality. The flavor is also a little orangey, with the slight soapy quality as well. Not my favorite brew here. The feel is thick with a moderate carbonation. The nose and the flavor just are not doing this for me. I'll have to check this one out again some time and see if its better from a different batch."
"PS - have also had this on tap at the Mort Subite bar in Brussels. This was slighty creamier, and had a fuller body. Also had slighty more spiciness to it...."
"Poured out a light amber/peachy color with a big head that took a while for it to settle down. Some lacing was left on the glass. Aroma consisted of yeast, citrus, and some sharp spices. I thought the nose was a little too light. Taste was decent. Huge malt backbone with orange rinds and sharp spices blend in midway through. Yeast flops around in the middle and towards the end. Mouthfeel was full bodied, but finished a tad watery I thought. Overall not bad, but there are better tripels out there. Perhaps aging this one will mellow it all out."
"I liked this brew, but I enjoyed the red more (it was sweeter and more drinkable). Surprisingly, my brother enjoyed this one more (the red didn't do too much for him, he said). I am glad I have this one under my ""credentials"" and look forward to adding the Grand Reserve to my ""repertoire."""
"sample of Lot LAL-555 with no freshness date. poured an amber color with much flocculent material and bosterious white head. Slight smell typical of a tripel. Taste was nothing impressive with a slight bitterness on the tongue. Very easy drinking beer that hides 8% alcohol well, but not worth the price."
"Tasted on 30th May 2005, best by end 2007 (batch LAM-409). Plenty of yeast deposit evident in the bottle before opening. Smell was not complex, mostly a rusty metal. Poured into Chimay goblet a tan colour with a nice slightly off-white head of about an inch. Gave the bottle a swirl and added the deposit. Instant cloud with some clumps of yeast. Plenty of bubbles in the mouth, taste comfirmed the smell, nice alcohol aftertaste and decent mouthfeel. Halfway down, bubbles still forming. Head retention good; down to quarter inch easily outlasting the drink itself. Nice beer, though not really a session beer. Prefer other Chimays."
"The nose is of spice and a little bit of lemon with a hint of alcohol. It's a real clean smell, very enticing. The taste has a metallic hoppiness blended with some mild spice and fruit. (imagine if you took a bite of apple & lemon at the same time) Good mouthfeel, I like the amount of carbonation (moderate) for this beer. I do think that the alcohol presence in the taste is more than it should be for a 8% abv beer. I've had beers with a lot more alcohol in them that hide the flavor a lot more than this one does. Overall I must say that it is a very good beer. I've been enjoying all three of the Chimay brews for a while and they are definately a main stay in my refrigerator. I'd recommend the cinq cents to any one who enjoys great beer."
"Overall, a fantastic extremely drinkable and refreshing beer. I recommend this in almost any situation."
"Pours a dark golden color with a generous head. Smell is great like sweet apricots and other candied fruit. Taste is also wonderful... a little more carbonation that most other tripels which dilutes the flavor a bit, but after a few sips it tastes great. The taste is much like other tripels, with the fruity flavor in the head, the blonde-like middle, and the carbonation filled aftertaste. Great overall."
"Had on tap at Sunset. Poured into a tulip. First impression was, what a great pour! Pours a classic gold, with a frothy, but small, white head on top. First impression was that of the alcohol presence. I felt that could have been masked a bit better. A slightly fruity beer, I felt the apple residue, which was a nice surprise. Overall, it is a fine tripel, but not quite as drinkable as I would have liked. One was certainly enough."
"Drinkability: Overall, I guess it's a decent Tripel. Westmalle & Tripel Karmeliet blow this brew out of the water, though."
"Very drinkable considering its strength; thank you sir, may I have another."
"Mouthfeel: The body works well. It isn't super thick or super thin. It just walks the edge of quality."
"You'll want to take your time to enjoy it by itself."
"Medium body with a rough, hoppy bite that seemed really out of place for a tripel with this fine a reputation. In the end, this was not what I expected from a tripel, just to rough for my palate."
"D&N: Nice Tripel, good flavors and aromas. Would make a good purchase."
"Bottle. Rated this after a bottle of Chimay Blue (bad idea). Looks absolutely beautiful, slightly cloudy luminous light gold in colour with a huge rocky white head the sticks around and leaves plenty of lace. Aroma is medicinal and flowery. Taste starts with sweet malt, with a medicinal middle and a dry and slightly bitter finish. Mouth feel is exquisite; they have done a great job of balancing the viscosity from the high levels of alcohol with fine carbination. I should have tasted this before the Blue. Think I will re-rate the Blue now, I need to give it more credit for subtly and balance."
"Drinkability is good on this solid belgian."
"Flavor is pleassantly sweet, classic flavors of citrus, candied fruit, banana-spice bread, and white pepper. There is a hop presence that makes it's appearance toward the finish. Good and easy-going example of a tripel. A beginner tripel if you will."
"It has a short duration moderately swwet flavor that has moderate acidity and a slight bitterness, maybe a hint of clove."
"Wife fixes pork chops, so I check the food pairing lookup here at BA and see Tripel as a potential style. I check the cellar and find a little 330 ml of this. Poured into a Chimay goblet, utlra hazy, orange with a rocky foamy sticky head. Tons of carbonation with a column from the center etching rising like an office building in a morning fog. Smell is oh so Belgian, with spice and dark fruit odors dominating. Taste is crisp and clean with slight bitterness, full mouthfeel, but a dry dry dry (arid, even) finish. Wife compares it to wine. She thinks she's found something she can drink. I tell her to get a job as this runs between $4.50 and $5 for a bottle this size. Tasty. Easy to quaff."
"Vintage 2004. Poured like a shiny-brand-new-penny copper. Fairly high carbonation, with a huge head in the goblet no matter how hard I tried. The aroma is a nice spice and pepper with fairly mile fruit tones that remind me of Jamaica. Speaking of Jamaica, the pepper comes through in the taste and reminds me of jerk. The hops are mild and come through as bittersweet with the very slight malts. The mouthfeel was very dry in the finish--I need something sugary to eat with this. Definitely not a favorite, but I wouldn't turn away from it at the store."
"Pours fizzy, and with some fast-rising foam, into my Chimay goblet. It's actually been quite awhile (maybe a year) since I've had a Cing Cents. The carbonation settles and I'm left with slightly hazy, deep golden ale. There's vanilla in the aroma and perhaps a little plastic (phenols.) The taste is remarkably cleaner than I remember with an almost harsh bite of bitterness towards the finish. Where are the fruity esters that I remember? The bitterness fades and into a sugary, alcoholic haze. Very different than I recall and I'm left stunned by the spicy and bitter hops that I now find int his beer. Perhaps this bottle needs to age?"
"Pours a clouded yellow/orange color with a volumnous off-white head that laces well as the head subsides. Some peppery alcohol notes mixed with some husky grain, clove-like phenols, and yeast with an orange and pear-like fruit essence. Hop character is mild. A slight bit sweet at first, and the thoroughly dry finish soon takes over the whole experience. Very dry. Poured into a large Chimay goblet, so a steady stream of bubbles are continually rising from the stem, carbonation is healthy and not overwhelming. Very nice if you prefer your tripels on the drier side. Very enjoyable. I'm now pairing it up with some Chimay cheese that is cured with the same beer. It works excellently."
"My first tripel - 330 mL bottle served slightly chilled in a Chimay chalice. Pours a golden orange with a light haze and a 2 finger, creamy, off white head that leaves nice lacing and a 1/8 inch blanket of foam throughout. The aroma is peppery/spicy and sweet with tropical fruit, phenols, bananas, and a decent amount of floral hops. Flavors are lemon/pepper/spice and piney/citric hops that leave a nice bitterness with a yeasty background - very smooth and the alcohol leaves a warming sensation. The malts and hops are perfectly balanced with each trying to overtake the other and neither really succeeding. Damn good. If all tripels are this tasty it may become one of my favorite styles."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This seems to be the Chimay that gets beat on like a red-headed stepchild but I'd put this beer up against the Grand Reserve in my book. Underrated. Great beer!"
"Pours a deep slightly cloudy amber with a huge fluffy off-white head. Tastes good for an um (well, not one of my favorite styles.) Has the whole fruity spicey belgian yeast thing going on for it. Nice mellow feel to it. Hops are there and are a pleasant for the most part. This is a decent beer, and many would argue 'world class' but I'm not really into it, sorry."
"First time drinking the white, not last though. Clearly a great brew and now one of my new favourite belgian beers."
"What a beautiful beer, which in my opinion was ruined by the addition of clove and ginger spices. The beer looks amazing on the pour, but after that it all seemed to go downhill for me. The smell was lightly hoppy, but mostly malty, yeasty, and spicey. It had the signature spicey/yeasty Chimay taste, which I am not exactly that fond of for reasons already stated. I can't really seem to write anything else about this beer. It was good, but I can definitely say that Chimay is the inferior of all trappist ales I've had. I only drank this one for a sense of completion."
"My favorite of the Chimay line, this is also my favorite abbey beer for accompaniment of food, especially fish and grilled meats."
"Served from a 300ml bottle into a Liefman's chalice. Pours a cloudy orange hue with a smallish white head that is rather short-lived. Carbonation is large bubbles and is not as long-lasting as in my favorite tripels. Aroma is dominated by spicy Belgian yeast, with notes of allspice and coriander. Flavor is excesslvely bitter - not from hops, just astringent and very acidic, almost like a gueuze. Mouthfeel is foamier than I like in a tripel. Maybe this was a bad bottle, but I really don't think this beer lives up to its reputation."
"a beer i was looking forward to trying and didnt disappoint."
"Still, this is what a Belgian Tripel is all about. A most excellent beer and one of the best in the style in my opinion. Try it!"
"A very nice beer. I wish I had more."
"This is a top notch beer."
"Pours to a deep golden color with a thick, foamy white head. The aroma is yeasty, spicy, and peppery. It also has a sweet candi sugar aroma along with a bit of fruit. The flavor is peppery and yeasty with a herbal and fruity apple taste. It is medium-full in body and drying. I get a bit of alcohol warmth at the end of each sip. A nice drinking beer."
"This is one of three carried at Trader Joes stores. Appearance, I like the way this beer looks poured into a belgium glass. It pours a nice orange with reddish hues. It has a nice creamy head, that reduces to just a nice 1/4 inch. Smell, I need more practice, but I can definately pick out the citris notes(lemon), and some faint spice and hops. a nice layer covering the beer. The Taste is citris, and well balanced malt and hops. Mouthfeel nice, liquid satin, bubbly and creamy. I can't sit back and drink many, but I will really enjoy a couple."
"Comments - The excellent reputation of this brand is well deserved. Don't have friends if you have this around; they will drink it all up. I can't wait to get some more. The 11.2 oz. bottle is a nice touch."
"The drinkability is great could be a session beer, watch out for the eight percent. The aftertaste is limited and disappears in minutes but lingers the crisp wheat."
"Pours with a vigorous carbonation resulting in a high head that is amazingly fluffy and long-lasting, subsiding to a rocky bubbly mass. The head is off-white over a golden-orange brew with good clarity. The aroma is very nice, with lemon hints, a little caramel, and some spicy honey-like notes. The flavor is crisp and rich, slightly sweet, with more honey and malt notes and a faint harshness from alcohol strengh. A little hops at the end gives it a bit of a bite. Mouthfeel is perfect for style, with a little overcarbonated spike. Drinkability is good too although the alcohol level is a little too obvious. To me this is the best of the Chimay brood and a world-class beer."
"Pours brownish-orange and not clear at all. Sniff is true of other whites, maybe a little more refined. Late whiff of flowery hops."
"What a beautiful pour! Golden cloudy orange in color with a nice long lasting head. Smell is of fruits and spices. The first few tastes were warmer-uppers. Starts off very lively on the palate because of the carbonation. It has a nicely blended mix of the fruits, spices, yeast, and malts with an initial hop overload finish that disappears as quickly as it came on. The beer becomes more drinkable as it warms and because one has had a chance to become adapted to the alchoholic warmth."
"I thought it was a nice, well-balanced beer that was a good example of the style."
"This beer came to me with about a finger-thick head which quickly went down to a nice ring of foam about the glass. The color was a cloudy orange. There was good lacing as it went down. The smell was malty and fruity. The taste was very complex: it was spicy, and had an orange pith bitterness to it. Mouthfeel started out sweet and led to a dry bitterness. Overall, a good beer, but I wasn't wowed by it. I didn't feel it was as life-changing as other Belgians I've tried."
"The mouthfeel is relatively sharp and light. While easily detectable, the alcohol doesn't take away from the drinkability."
"A solid well above average brew. Pours a lemon colr with a nice small head that leaves oustanding lacing. Smell is that of grass and citrus..very inviting. Taste is intitially lightly sweet, then yeasty and citrusy....ending in a nicely tart finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium, dry...yet smooth. Drinkability is very good for an 8.0 abv."
"750mL: Golden orange hue, long-lasting 1cm white head, light yeast deposit. Very dry aroma with far less events happening than moinette blonde. Light alcohol touch provides a rather heating character, very herbal, moderately hoppy, grassy. Decent honeyish malt base on the tongue though it fades into an extremely dry finish. This wants to be westmalle tripel a bit too much for its own good, but it doesnt even come close in the mouthfeel department where this one seems a bit overcarbonated, bubbly even and medium bodied at most. It certainly has an irony quality to it, or at least very mineralic, which I sometimes appreciate, but it didnt seem to fit with the alcohol in here. Finish is hoppy, salty. Decent take on the style."
"This one was the exception. Pours with a dark golden body and a fairly thick head. Nice lacing throughout. The aroma is very sweet and fruity, almost like a maple syrup or a molasses, with some slight tart notes. The flavor was a bit subdued over the bottle. Very dry mouthfeel, almost astringent, and the tastes tend to linger for a while. The end result is a pleasant tripel, and a very drinkable one at that. Suprisingly good for a tap tripel."
"I may try this again, if someone else buys one as the reviews indicate it is a good example of a triple. I did not care for it and hope this was just a bad bottle. I tend to think not however, because it still had some very positive attributes. Taste and especially aftertaste were not among them."
"Great carbonation and slightly astringent mouthfeel. Drinkablity is very good for a beer that is this strong. A real winner here and one to be savored."
"Good stuff."
"Woww what a great( hoppy& fruity) smell followed by a mabey even better ( bitter & clean) taste and a great aftertaste almost purely of good& fresh hops. Could have a litle more body but most certaily one of my favorite beers! For sure worth trying if its around!"
"Wonderful blend of flavors. It starts light but almost immediately follows with a meduim, well balance and moderated apricot/plum fruitinesss. This is not an overpowering in Belgian characterists but is rather a wonderful harmony of those characteristics. It finishes a bit on the crisper end and leaves no aftertaste. I loved this and would do it again (and again and again)."
"Pours a hazy deep blond color with a foamy indestructable head. It lasts till the end of the glass and leaves a coat of lace behind. The aroma is malts, spices, kandy sugar and floral hops. The taste is light and complex at the same time, with an initial hop bite that leads into nice herbal and spicey notes (pepper is evident). Theres also floral hop notes and a fruity yeast in the middle. The finish is very bitter and slightly medicinal. The mouthfeel is mouthcoating but not excessive in its thickness. This beer conceals its ABV quite well. It has a great depth of flavor (with lots of hops) making it one of the better tripels Ive tried."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy light brown ale with a huge foamy off-white head with excellent retention. Aroma is mix between Belgian spices and strong malts and floral hops. Taste is quite delicious with again some spices showing up (some peppers?), strong malt with excellent body and all of this covered with floral hops. Less sweet then other tripel such as Westmalle but still very enjoyable overall."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a huge billowy white head. Aroma is of overripe citrus, spice with a little bit of lite brown sugar. Taste is nice with a malty sweetness giving way to a light spicyness. A touch of sweeness, but it finishes fairly dry. Mouthfeel is good with nice carbonation that refreshes. The alcohol is a touch noticable as it warms. Drinkability is good as well. Say what you will about Chimay, but they are a steady if not spectacular beer. Nothing that will wow you, but consistant"
"A most excellent Belgian pale."
"While not particular novel or exciting, this is a solid example of the style, and a quite tasty one at that. This is sort of the slacker little brother of the Chimay family; it's definitely not an overachiever, but it's hard not to like this beer."
"Pours a big head on top of a murky orange / yellow body. Lots of particles swimming around in there. Lovely spiciness to the smell with a little hop. The main flavors are a medium spice and medium hops at the middle and finish, which linger in the aftertaste. The carbonation tingles the tongue on the finish at the same time the hops hit. There is a slight flavor of alcohol. The balance of hops and spice are good in this one. Good for people who like a tripel with spice and hops, with little fruitiness."
"Hmmmm... this is an interesting one. Beautiful burnt orange color, which isn't surprising considering the taste. The smell and the flavor for this is overwhelmingly burnt or bitter orange peel. Strangely enough, in the aroma, I also get what I can only describe as rubber. My girlfriend smelled it, and without my prompting, said ""It smells like a truck."" But I don't say this in a bad way, because it doesn't detract from the beer. There are some nice tropical and white fruits (pineapple, peach), as well as some coriander and pepper spiciness making a brief appearance in a long, lingering, bitter aftertaste. This is certianly unique, and very tasty, which is all you can ask of a beer. Anything more is gravy..."
"Much like the Chimay Red, I think it's a good beer, it's just a different style that would take some getting used to."
"Five Cents for a Tripel? That must have been a steal a few hundred years ago. Of course since then things have changed and styles have evolved and diversified. Perhaps, my bias comes from exposure to a number of American triples and relatively few authentic Belgians but this brew seemed lackluster. While there was elegance, and refined tastes in a beer that has roots in a deep and deservedly respected tradition; it seems that Chimay Wit pales in comparison to the intense, poetic, and wild triples I have pursued. Certainly, the golden ale looks lovely beneath fingers of foam. The hints of banana and clove are pleasant, but cloying. The flavor is nice, but it lacks a sense of adventure. There's nothing to drive me wild, or entrance me with the style as I've found in CBC's triple threat or in Epluche Cullotte. I want stark, mad poetry of flavor."
"Overall this is a good beer to try for the style, however not my favorite of the Chimays."
"Smooth as it goes down, but can't hold a candle to the bottled variety in terms of flavor. This is well balanced, though the alcohol does make its presence known, but all the flavors are somewhat muted."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, and taste is addicting. If I have it in the house it doesn't last."
"The Chimay was very nice. The appearance was a very light amber/tan color. The smell was fruity, malty, some spices coming through. The taste was very fruity and spicy as well. It was a little malty but not thick on the tongue. It poured a nice off white head that held for a long time, leaving a little lace around the sides of the glass. The drinkability was great, a nice Belgian white. I would recommend this to anybody in a second."
"Some people like beers from Chimay, some dont. Myself, I enjoy the ones Ive had a lot. This being my first tripel, I am eager to try more of the style. A nice solid beer."
"This brew was sampled out of a 750 ml bottle on a cool June evening, on my back deck, accompanied by some semi-soft French cheese. Its a cloudy yellow-orange colored liquid with an initially enormous head (that quickly settles into an ever-present thin layer). The aroma is yeasty and phenolic. Theres a touch of fruit (apple and berries?), and just a little alcohol. As you taste it, at first the beer seems soft and subtle, but quickly becomes peppery and crisp, with a bitter backbone. Theres a hint of alcohol in the taste, and a solid yeast taste. Moderate carbonation (maybe less than usual for a Belgian). Sweetness is restrained. Its very drinkable, and not overpowering."
"750 ml bottle opens with a nice gunshot and gunsmoke. Pours a semi-cloudy honey golden color, quite pretty with a nice large (not huge) off-white head. Aroma of flowers and citrus and candi sugar from a foot away. Belgian yeast smell is present, but not dominant, with a slight earthiness. Mostly fruit and sweet, maybe a bit like walking through an herb garden. Flavor: malti-goodness, crisp, and a little earthy that ends in moderate tartness. Bitter ending. The flavor has a nice beginning and middle, but ending leaves an off-flavor tongue coating that is not enjoyable. Too much earthiness and mustiness. I will admit, though, that this improves as one works one's way through the bottle. Mouthfeel is decent, but that tongue coating is not pleasant. Drinkability- nice, but alcohol is a little strong for much. In summary, I think this is a nice tripel, but there are several others that I prefer (and I am just starting to try a lot of different tripels)."
" Overall, this IS the Belgian Tripel style that so many domestic micros and brewpubs are trying to duplicate. Next time you try a micro-triple, think about this beer and think what it is you're drinking."
"-Oelergud"
"Had this on tap at Dr. Dremos served in a Chimay chalice. It appears dark golden yellow in color with a decent sized white form head. There are streams of little bubbles coming from the bottom that seem to keep a thin head in place. The aroma is a slight on of hops with citrus and a slight alcohol smell, not too strong of an aroma on this one. Very hoppy flavor with a fruity sweetness about it and a hint of some spiciness. There is also some alcohol warmth to it with a yeasty finish. Good mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation. Fairly drinkable and complex, an good brew to have occasionally."
"I mentioned that the Blue label reminded me of autumn. If so, then this one is a warm spring day in grassy fields. I've never before been so generous with the fives, but each one was earned."
"Deep golden, with a textbook rich, thick head that lasts through the journey-lacing is marginal. Aromas are big and malty, and fruit driven, with a heady aroma of alcohol that is well integrated. Lots of pineapple on the nose as well as candy sugar. Big and rich in the mouth while clean and crisp for the style. Flavors again are very malty, and warming from the alcohol. Banana and pineapple flavors are accompanied by antiseptic spice notes, and the finish is long and is accompanied by a good hop bite."
"Drinkaility: strong and tasty; definitely not something to chug!"
"Pours a cloudy orangish gold (much darker on the second pour) under a three finger white head that settles slowly, has great body and leaves good sticky lace. The nose is strong of raspberry and fruity yeast. The mouth is very prickly and medium bodied. The opening taste is a pleasant fruity sweetness - oranges, apricots, lemon and a whole lot of Belgian yeast. This is all followed by a good crisp hoppy bitterness that leaves an espresso like dryness at the back of the throat. As the bitterness fades, the fruit and yeast return, leaving a very pleasant impression. This beer is complex and tasty, in a big way. Yum!"
"Drinkability - not for the everyday apertif, but certainly a solid pick whenever. It is complex enough to make me want to have it again and see what else I can pick up taste-wise."
"A very nice beer, definitely a classic. I've had better tripels, but this is surely a benchmark for the style. I could stand for a less aggressive carbonation, even though it suits the beer. I look forward to the other two varieties, if this is supposedly the worst one."
"Had this with a peanut + spice Thai dish, and complemented it well. Treat it well and it will do the same for you."
"Having this for the first time on tap, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think I like it bottled a *litte* bit better."
"Smells of alcohol and tingles of carbination on the tongue. Crisp taste fruit, maybe bananas as it flows through the mouth. Mouthfeel is delightful as it dances around inside. This tripel is quite drinkable and a fine representative of its class."
"Notes: I did not do this beer justice through my description. I would take my description as a basic one, but buy it and try it for youself. It is definitly recommended."
"This beer poured a hazy golden amber color with a medium sized white, bubbly head. Smell was very bready and slightly fruity. The taste was subtle but intriguing. Belgian yeast dominates the flavor. It's bready in flavor, slightly phenolic. Fruity flavors hide underneath. There is actually some hoppyness in the end. The flavors are all subtle but mix together well. Maybe the yeast was too prevalent and came forward too much, but all in all this is a good beer."
"Drinkability is good but this beer is definitely better in the 750ml bottle."
"overall a very nice mild beer!"
"12 bottle, brownish color with some haze. Spicy nose. Coriander and pepper come foward. Nicely balanced flavors, spice, yeast, malt and hops. The Belgian yeast dominates this beer, phenolic, spicy,flowery. Alot going on. One of my favorites, never fails to be interesting and enjoyable. A classic worth trying and savoring"
"This one at Mad Mex during happy hour 12 ounces for around 3.50 or so, not bad. Appearance: Golden with a slight haze over it, creamy white head leaves nice lacing. Aroma: Nice candied sugar with a spicy mix blended with some bisuit and pale malt sweetness. Taste: Semi-harsh blend of spices and hops soothed with a brady sweetness coated with an evident amount of alcohol in the flavor, nothing amazing reputation is bigger than the beer. Mouthfeeel: Medium to light bodied ale has a creamy texture going for it and strong carbonation. Drinkability: Decent but overhyped, usually overpriced as well very rich and high in alcohol with a bready finish not a go to for me."
"I got a fantastic big foamy head when I poured this into a tulip glass . The beer was a cloudy amber color. The aroma was good mixture of that Belgian ale scent with a slight floral boquet. This ale has a peppery spiceyness at the begining followed by a crisp hop finish. The alcohol does not really present itself until you are half way through the glass. At that point my ears started to warm up."
"Alcohol not as well hidden as the Grand Reserve, but very drinkable nonetheless."
"My expectations were too high and the serving temp of the beer was obviously too low as all the qualities this beer possesses expressed themselves when the beer neared room temp. Will re evaluate at a later time. But this review still stands."
"The Cinq Cents poured a wonderful cloudy gold with a great deal of sediment. It was capped by a nice 2 finger white head. The smell was of fruit, spices, hops, and alcohol. It's taste was very bitter with an alcohol tinge. It was smooth and light in the mouth with a dry finish. This was a reasonable beer, but if I can think of several Wits I'd prefer, although the kick was nice."
"Keeping in mind the fact that I've only had a few Belgians so far... I'm not that impressed. Maybe that means my palate isn't sophisticated, maybe it means that they're an acquired taste that I haven't yet acquired, or maybe I'll never like them as much as a good hoppy IPA or creamy stout. In any case, Chimay White, according to many, is a good to great Abbey Tripel. At this early stage of my journey, it isn't really my cup of tea."
"The beer pours a very hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of wheat malts and wit yeast. It has a fruity aroma that gives a certain spice to the wheat malts. The taste is a bit strong, but it has decent flavor. There is alot of pale and wheat malts here with an elevated abv.. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. It drinks quite well, but I prefer a sweeter wit. Nonetheless, this is a fine product."
"Overall an interesting beer."
"Pours a hazy apricot with a lasting creamy off-white head. Smells crisp and clean with ones of yeast. Thick and bitter on the palate, the carbonation acts almost as a liquid sandpaper -- leaving my taste buds clear, not coated. The taste is as clean and yeasty as the aroma, with a growing bitter aftertaste in the back of the throat. The experience overall, however, combines in a way that is pleasant, easy to drink, and leaves me feeling satisfied and knowing that I just enjoyed a very good brew."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"It just didn't appeal to me, techincally it was really good and well crafted but I just didn't like it. I would try it again to see if I change my mind."
"11.2 oz bottle pours into a goblet a hazy, honey orange colour, with an abundant off-white head of tiny bubbles that fades into a sheet of lacing. Aroma is dominated by a prominent yeastiness, with some hints of grapefruit, banana, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, with a hops/yeast twang. Taste is dry and bitter. Breadiness dominates the taste, earthy and yeasty, dry and bitter. Hops type finish and a dry aftertaste. I've been drinking Chimay ales, on occasion, the past twelve years and I've still not made up my mind about it. Obviously, my 4.0 for drinkability and my continued enjoyment of it means it's a pretty fine Belgian Tripel."
"An ok beer but the Chimay Red is better."
"It seems like I have been missing something important in this drink. It wasnt obviously defective, but it seemed much more simple than I would have expected from a Belgian import beer. Maybe the keg had been in use for too long? I dont really know"
"Over halfway in, the fruitiness is broader, with more flavors swimming about, juicy, tropical fruits,pineapple, sweet, spicy, kicky...a far cry from the best tripels of Belgium. I may actually look into it, again, to investigate whether this sampling was inferior, and perhaps the brew was meant to taste much more amazingly. Until then...Chimay's is an underwhelming tripel experience."
"Not my favorite Chimay offering. That metal flavor did a lot to mess up what promised to be a wonderful beer, based of the looks and smell. Still, it has a nice balance and variety of flavors to make it worth trying."
"A good special occasion type of beer."
"Poured in a Chimay chalice. Had a large white head. Color was a pale gold with a slight cloudiness to it. The smell was of a musty and fruitiness. The taste was very strong. Full of flavor. Starts out with a fruity, almost apple tasting, then turns to a pepperish zing towards the end. This was a full bodied beer with lots of strong flavor."
"Strong ABV is evident in the finish."
"Served in a Chimay chalice. The beer is a hazy gold color that has a white sheen to it. Not much head was in this beer when it was brought to me fresh from the tap. It has a spicy aroma, but does not have any hotness to it. There is a light musty flavor and aroma here, which I find characteristic of many Belgian beers. A light white grape fruitiness rounds out the front and middle of this Trappist ale. There is a bit of hot spiciness in the finish of this beer, sort of a pepper type finish. This is pretty good, and is widely available."
"Cloudy orange fizzy pour. Carbinotation made it interesting and classic Chimay.Tasty but worth sharing the bottle if without food. Bit of spice and pepper and (sour) yeast in taste. Bit bitter and alcohol feel. AFtertaste was dry. A classic Belgium but Chimay Blue is the best."
"Not a bad beer, but I could see why people are not so enamoured with it. Poured a nice cloudy golden with plenty of frothy delicate head. Smelled very much like a whit instead of a tripel, with very few estery characteristics or that traditional spice of a tripel. Much more malty and bread like. Taste was also very uncharacteristic. Very creamy mouthfeel, notes of cracker and bannana just a hint of cloves floating about. There were also some corny notes that I can attribute to the use of adjuncts. This doesn't really hold a candle to some of the other Trappist beers, but its a nice beer to have when out due to its availability."
" Nice sweet base with a lot of yeast in the flavor, especially after swirling around the bottom of the bottle and dumping it in. Spices are nice, but subtle. The alcohol bite is definitely noticable, but it is not out of control at the start. I remembered not liking this beer when I first had it a while ago, but I thought my palate had changed. Looks like it really did not. The alcohol flavor really comes in hard for a really unpleasant flavor. It is very acidic and doesn't really have anything going for it. This was a tough one to drink."
"Amazing range of scents with a predominating orangey fruityness that is ever present during the actual tasting. The taste is, though, a bit overwhelmed by this presence but that manages to hide the ABV perfecty. Excellent trappist product."
"In short, now I remember why I buy this beer so infrequently, although I do like othe Chimays."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but I like my tripels with a little less medicinal overtones than this. Give me a little more fruit or malt. Nice to have a hoppy Belgian, though."
"Nice mouthfeel smooth definitely hides the 8% abv well. A drinkable beer but I was more in the taste department. The store in town just got these beers in hopefully the red and blue will be better."
"Pours a light orange with a big, white foamy head. Nose is highly medicinal, with the slightest bit of apple. Also earthy and yeasty. Mouthfeel is exceedingly crisp and yet smooth. Starts with a malty sweetness that leads to a quick hop sharpness. Imparts a very peculiar bitterness on the tongue with the medicinal phenols. Ends with an apple-peel aftertaste. I didn't really care for this with the first sip, but it certainly grew on me. Maybe it was the well-hidden 8% abv, or maybe this beer is simply complex and requires a little getting used to. Overall this is a great tripel, but not the best."
"Poured a light mahogany brown, very hazy, with an off white head that receded to a thin bubble island that never left until the last drink. Citrusy, spicy, and yeasty notes with a hint of alcohol. Taste was very sharp, bready and biscuity. Felt thinner than the Chimay Premiere, but easier to drink. This was part 2 of a 3 part vertical Chimay tasting."
"It was my birthday, so I splurged and got a glass of this on tap at the Horsebrass. Delivered in a wine glass, it was surprisingly dark. The hue was almost similar to oak, a mix of oranges and browns. Somewhat sedimenty and a quick foamy top. Aroma is sweet and applesque. Taste is very round, a well built malt body with pales and bisquits, and a slight, minimal fruity yeast taste. The taste was surprisingly mellow when compared to a local triple, though much more refined and much better balanced. Drank nicely and would have made a great dinner compliment, though 12oz is just about the ideal serving."
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a nice large white head. The head took a while to die down in my Chimay glass and this led me to discover the smell. This beer has a slightly sweet and fruity smell and that is followed up by the taste of malt and caramel and spice. The taste of the spices and slight yeast and sweetness were very well balanced together. While this is a very good beer in its own right I prefer the Red and Blue. This is a very drinkable beer and even though it has a high ABV I could not really notice the alcohol."
"pours out a hazy golden colour with sediment floating about. a huge rocky head sticks and stays. plenty of lace to be had...festively adorning my wide mouthed schooner. slightly musty aroma...hints of cloves and fruits mingling with delicate yeasty notes. smells clean and yeast driven, not to mention the alcohol. upon tasting...again, rather understated flavours milling about...alcohol soaked fruits and some malten breadiness...spicy alcohol and wheat malt providing an added touch to the profile. really, really smooth despite the obvious alcohol punch. a really mouth coating, velvety and full bodied mouthfeel. dry finish. not lacking in character by any means. my lack of experience in belgians shows again...i know this tastes good...its full bodied and unapologetic alcoholic, and i like it. extremely drinkable, a big beer for big boys. not necessarily to my tastes...but a killer brew nonetheless. a classic."
"Hazed orange-white with an active, white head. Peppery but fruity aroma -- apple peel, champagne-ish orange, apricot... Carries over to the palate. Peppery feel amidst a fruity flavor and medium body. Well carbonated and active on the tongue. The tiniest hop bite really keeps the abundance of esters and ""too tasty"" flavors in check. Kind of middling, this one is flavorful but not difficult. Dangerously drinkable for 8%."
"Why would I wait so long to try such a classic? No good reason really, but even I was too weak to resist when I saw this on tap at Papagos. Came to my table a hazy peach in color, with a moderate, creamy white head. The aroma struck me as very *tight*. Sharply spiced with a hint of acidic fruit. The spice starts off the flavor, too, in a really lovely way  strong but not at all overpowering. It seems right at place throughout the whole sip. Develops a bit of citric grapefruit flavor mid-palate, and finishes rather sweetly in flavor but still dry in mouthfeel. Very smooth on tap; good god I could drink this all night."
"My personal favorite from Chimay,what an awesome pour a huge billowing fluffy head with a rich golden color.The aroma is of honey and and yeast with some alcohol notes.The taste is also honeeish and yeasty with a nize zesty finish atruely complex and delightful Triple.I think it should be considered one of the top beers of the world,but hey its just me."
"I think I set myself up for overexpectation with this brew. It was very good and very drinkable. I usually think of Triels has double digit ABV brews that work had to cloak their alcohol. This one clocked in at 8% had was showing more than some."
"Overall this isn't what I expected from a triple at all. More like a cross between one of it's brothers in the chimay line and a triple. Still very easy drinking and tasty."
"Light gold color, large head. Aroma is fruity and sweet, touched of yeast. Medium bodied, malty and hoppy. Some malt sweetness and fruitiness. Good balance. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Beer is 8% alcohol by volume, but no alcohol bite."
"It's still a quality beer, I think. But it's a little light on the taste, making the alcohol a little heavy."
"Consumed again and again; and again on 9.18.04. Terrific beer."
"Real good, not amazing, but the sweetness seemed right and it was pretty drinkable, and fun to try."
"Drinkability: The ABV is well-hidden, leading to a dangerously drinkable beer. Finishes somewhat dry with a little spice ZAP! to tickle your taste buds one final time."
"My first Chimay, and not to be my last! What a Father's Day gift!"
"This beer pours a dark orange in color. There is an awesome head at the top of this beautiful brew. There is also a lot of carbonation going on in this beer. The head stays forever. The first aroma to cross the nose is cloves and spice, hints of yeast and even a distant hint of fruit. Pleasing to the nose and eyes so far. The taste is a start of malt and then a wash of the yeast flavors. There was a slight hint of fruit in the taste. A smooth drinking brew but watch out, there is alcohol in there and it will creep up on you. There is a nice dry finish with this beer. I can see me sitting down in the winter with a few of these watching a football game with the fireplace going. Another beer for all to try!"
"This beer pours an orange color with a very citrus filled aroma and a medium head. The taste is sweet and very strong of citrus. This was a great drink and it was very smooth. It left a very pleasurable taste on the palate after drinking. I would have this again if not for the high price."
"Funny beer. There are times when I've had this and been quite disappointed, and other times it was as good as any beer I've ever had. I don't know if the quality varies that much, or whether it justs hits me different sometimes. Tonight, it was great. Tangy, fruity taste ( a little of that ""orange peel"" flavor some speak of). Large, somewhat carbonated head, which lasts throughout. Alcohol not noticed in the taste, but definitely in the buzz. Somewhat yeasty, but quite appealing (I wish I had one more glass tonight!). There is a very appealing tartness to this beer, and it is truly world class when it's right."
"An astonishing beer and a tribute to some great beermakers."
"This beer pours a clear pale copper hue with a massive cream-colored head. The beautifully blended bouquet of a light lemon twang, fresh fruit, and subtle spices make you crave your first taste. The flavors mirror the aromas but start with light hops and lemon twang sliding in to the fruit, spices and a warming alcohol with light yeast notes to go along. This is a light bodied beer and finishes just lightly on the dry side. The characteristics of the flavor and mouthfeel make this beer dangerously easy to consume at 8% ABV! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Mmmm...my taste buds have evolved since the past summer when I last had Chimay Tripel from the bottle. Finally had it on tap at a bar right down the street from my house. (Awesome!) Wonderful aroma of lemon, banana, and spices, with a smooth, slightly tingly carbonated mouthfeel. Complexity is off the charts. Flavors of clove, banana, and ripe tree fruits are dominant, but try some for yourself from the tap to get the experience. This was awesome."
"I will have to buy another bottle, but this is my review of this beer today."
"Presentation: 750ml corked bottle. Pours a hazy orange color topped off with a huge, creamy white head that dissipates slowly leaving a thick sticky lace on the glass. The aroma contains a mixture of malts, citrus fruit, and coriander with mild sweet fruit undertones. The taste is just as complex as the aroma with a combination of sweet malt, tart citrus fruit and spicy coriander. This is a nice medium-bodied, smooth beer. Even though its my least favorite of the Chimays, its still a very enjoyable beer."
"A very solid brew, but for my money, I would skip it and buy some Hennepin. Not worth the import price."
"I'll be completely honest here. The only other tripel I've tried was Victory's Golden Monkey, and I was not extremely impressed. I enjoyed this beer much more. Hard to believe there's that much alcohol in it! Golden color. Nice lacey head, but it didn't stick around too long. I had it served in a fancy-schmancy Chimay glass, which added to the experience. This was also the first Chimay I've ever had, and from what I've read so far it only gets better than the white label."
"it poured a hazy, golden/light brown. with a small bubble bone white head. the aroma is full of spicey yeast and fruit. the taste is of spicy yeast, alcohol, rock sugar, fruity, grape with citric notes. i catch apple as well. the mouthfeel was pretty light and very drinkable. it had a crisp lasting citrus/ apple noted aftertaste."
"A pretty drinkable beer, but I found this quite ""one-dimensional"". In fact, i know this is sacrelidge, i found New Belgiums Tripel better..thats only my opinion!"
"First impression whow! It almost foamed out of the glass even though it was cold. 1/3 beer 2/3 foam! Very lively and carbonated. Wow, it even has a good head in the bottle after I poured it! Mostly fine bubbles that continuously rise up the side of the glass. Very long lasting head continuously reinforced by the carbonation. This brew has a very light amber color with some particles floating around in it. It also has a very mild aroma that is hard to notice. It reminded me of nothing in particular. The carbonation rolled off my tongue yet the taste was mostly of that carbonation with a mild fore and after taste. I liked the taste though. This is a beer I could get drunk on. Lets see if it has the stomach upsetting qualities that some of the other Chimayan ales have had. Time will tell. GF gave it a 4.1 rating. She said she could drink it all night long. That's a pretty good rating from her!"
"A great, very drinkable brew from Chimay. If some of you out there think this is just a beer bridging the Red and the Blue you will be very surprised. While nothing like their other beers, this one does a good job fitting in with everything else in the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Scourmont portfolio."
"Thick, dense, off-white head atop a hazy, amber body. This beer displays excellent head retention and produces the definition of lacing. Bubble gum sweetness in the aroma with a bit of corinader spiciness. The flavor is a very smooth maltiness, with coriander and decent hops in the finish. A bit of sweetness lingers on the aftertatse. The mouthfeel is superb, very rich and satisfying. The drinkabilty is good, as this beer is both enjoyable and refreshing. A very good beer that any beer lover must try."
"Honey-brown hue, hazy; almost secretively effervescent, two fingers worth of bubbly white head with excellent retention, no lace though. The nose is mildly spicy upfront with a sweet & yeasty, mild mustiness pear/white grape is detectable as well. Plenty spicy palate, peppery then tart balanced with an array of sweetness  honey-like mainly. The tartness reemerges to mix with a sugary-acidity. Gorgeous carbonation allows a fulfilling and enjoyable mouthfeel to develop. Sweet-tart finish, somewhat empty though, it loses some of the body disappoint because the rest of the beer was excellent. Still Id recommend you trying one!"
"Short stubby 12 oz bottle. Initial smell of pure wet dog. Pour produced a gigantic foamy white head atop a cloudy deep golden to light copper color. Dense and thick, the head lasted for-ever. Falling in clumps down the glass. Harsh rotten wet dog smells mellow into metal, grainy and rotten oranges combinations. Taste was grainy, slightly citrus like flavors. Alcohol and faded yeasty combinations mellow. Overall a slightly hot, harsh grainy taste. Some sweet malted flavors come back and forth. Medium bodied, hard to have more than a sip at time. I have heard the bigger bottles with the cork and cage taste better, I might try it in those bottles, but this was such a dissapointment it will be hard to pull the trigger on the big bottle. No where close to the Heavyweight Lunacy I had earlier this evening."
"This is a very good beer. I imagine it would be excellent either at the dinner table or the bar. It is one of the most satisfying ales I have ever had, because of its subtle combination of flavors and its smooth drinkability."
"Hazy dark brownish-orange pour with fine bubbles cutting through considerable yeast sediment. Topped with a monstrous bubbly head that lasts several minutes with good lacing. Clean, mildly fruity smell understates the amazing taste of this beer. Remarkably smooth despite the persistent effervescence. Crisp and bitter at the start, with alcohol gaining strength by the end. Some fruity notes peek through as the carbonation abates. Clean, crisp mouthfeel and strong drinkability, though this one is to be deconstructed and savored slowly."
"The least known of the three Chimay brews. This one,when poured into a Chimay chalice perfectly fills the glass with a cloudy,strawberry/peach colored ale with a huge,pillowy-dense head that spends some time with you ( long enough to have a conversation with if you're alone). The aroma and taste are very hard to pin down. You can smell this beer from quite a distance.It seems to be yeasty,fruity, and little floral. The taste starts with a little malt sweetness,a flowery hop flavor, and nice bitter finish, but as it warms,the fizzines of the carbonation subsides to give you a more creamy, toasted malt flavor with a long nice earthy bitterness in the finish. I would recommend taking your time and letting the flavors evolve with this beer to fully appreciate it."
"Opaque amber and peach. Rich sugary nose. Super fine long lasting head. Surprising bitterness. Strangly dry, spicy, musty and sour. All earth and malt flavor and no fruit. The alcohol is unrestrained."
"Chimay White cap: Very nice, poured into one of those nice chalices I got around Christmas. I bought it in one of those stubby bottles that is about 12 ounces. Brownish Trappist ale, and a damn tasty one as well. Huge thick off white head, that lasted and lasted and left a thick coating of lace down the side. Relatively mild aroma with hints of bananas and cloves. Very nice taste, not at all overwhelming though. I was struck by the sweet malts, with an understated taste of yeast. I found this remarkably easy to drink, but at 8% alcohol it is by no means a session beer."
"My least favorite Chimay! I'm glad I opted for the smaller bottle of this one. Pours a light gold color with a thick white head. Nice effervescence and minimal lacing. Aroma was actually skunked a little which surprised me. Some spices were also evident but it was ruined by the skunk factor. The flavor was a peppery and yeasty and light. I will try this again sometime and hopefully have a better experience, but at $4 for the small bottle it won't be any time soon."
"The flavor starts with tart green apple, pineapple, and hints of citrus. Very dry and almost like a hard cider, at times. It rounds out very spicy and peppery, particularly as the alcohol warms up as the beer is imbibed. In fact, if I have to fault this beer, I'd say that the alcohol is a bit too drying and solvent-like. It could be a little better balanced, especially when compared to the other great Chimay beers. But nonetheless, its still a quality beer and better than many tripels out there."
"F"
"Overall Cinq Cents is a great triple but IMHO it could use more aroma and a longer lasting head; something a Chimay yeast can easily handle. The highlight to this beer is the complex blending of flavors and the tactile way it plays on your palate."
"A great beer, and, without doubt, a very formidable Belgian. However (in my HUMBLE opinion), Cinq Cents is not quite on par with the Grande Reserve, but a close third to the Premiere. As for Belgian Tripels, give me a Westmalle."
"This beer poured an orangish gold, slightly cloudy, with a huge frothy off-white head that won't quit. It's going to be a while before I can even touch this one. Thick lace left when head finally subsides. Aromas of yeast, grapefruit, lemon zest, & coriander. Creamy and highly carbonated--very nice. Malty with a hop bite of grapefruit. The grapefruit character is almost to much for my taste. I enjoyed the blue much better."
"Poured a cloudy orange color. Good head, nice and white. Tasted supurd, not over fruity, just right. I enjoyed this beverage immensely. Just wish I had purchased more than one bottle. The ABV was barely noticeable, no alcohol taste lingering, although the effect was."
"I have to say that I am not as impressed with this beer as I was the Red. The Red seemed more comlex and not nearly as dry. Still, it is very good and I can't wait for the Blue."
"A few tips for this one - a bell glass or a snifter style glass is best to appreciate this one. Do not serve it to cold either. That takes away from the full flavor of this brew. Don't just run out and buy this one, run home and pop it open. let is set for about 24 hours - otherwise the odor from yeast will overpower the bouquet. If you are planning on trying different styles of beers at the same time - either cleanse your palate with some water or drink this one 1st. Other more hoppy beers or ones that are just stronger in flavor will overwhelm this one. The flavors here are very subtle and need to be fully appreciated. Kick back and relax."
"  believe me, there is a World of difference!!!"
"Dull, cloudy orange-tan with a large fluffy, creamy, goin' nowhere head. There are orange peel and coriander notes making this reminiscent of a wit (but probably coming from the yeast). In the flavor there is subdued spiciness and a small, thin bitter aftertaste. Light and airy feel and a bit creamy."
"Pours a deep golden colour topped by a beautiful creamy white head that settles down rather easily. The aroma consists of hops. The aroma of this beer is actually sweet and it took me 5 minuts to take the first sip. I simply enjoyed the appearance and the smell of it. The taste is quite bitter. Mouthfeel is strong. Fine brew, tripel style, from Belgium"
"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. I really wanted more from this beer. Hazy peach colored, with a thick, fluffy white head. Looks good enough. Smell is yeasty, a bit spicy, but there's a thick, almost gummy-sticky-sweet aspect to the smell. Not nearly as appetizing as I had hoped, being a fan of Chimay. Taste is a mixture of Belgian fruitiness, spicy alcohol, and bready yeastiness. But there's a thickness to it, cotton-candy like, that I just don't find all that appealing. And that makes me sad."
"This beer poured a dark gold color and formed a bubbly white head that left trace lace when it subsided. An aroma of malt, citrus and lightly of caramel. The flavor was of malt and caramel and the finish was quite dry. Not my favorite of the Chimays, but still a very good beer."
"The beer pours a pellucid amber color with the head large-scale and semi-creamy in texture, the resultant lace forms a fine satin sheet to lie upon the glass and conceal it from view. Nose is malt, hints of citrus and lightly sweet, and quite pleasant, start is malt laden and somewhat sweet with the top squinny. Finish is medial in carbonation, the hops pronounced, and the aftertaste bone dry. Of the three Chimays, this is my least favorite, great in its own right, just not my personal favorite, but well worth a sample if you have not tried it."
"Orange-hued haze with a huge white foam on top. Head retains exceptionally, as with the other Chimay beers, thanks to their great glass! Yeasty aroma with fruity esters and just a little pepper and citrus. Maybe some clove as well. Very complex, yet subtle. Spicy and almost rind-like bitterness hits the front of the tongue first with pepper in tow. The hops are very apparent in this one, which is kind of unusual for Belgian beers in my experience. A bit of yeast in the middle. Fruity as well, a bit like grapefruit. Grain-like maltiness is present underneath all of this at all times, but it's a different kind of grainy than with most beers that have this characteristic. Combines uniquely with the hops. Complexities are hard to pick out, the nose suggested more than are present. Smooth and creamy yet sharp and tingly mouthfeel. Although I find the hops a little out of place, this is a great tripel and a great beer overall. Not the most drinkable, but still above average in that department. Cheers to the Abbaye de Scourmont for another great effort!"
"Pours a hazy orange straw color with a thick rocky white head. Nose is a combination of fresh hops and yeast with hints of citrus. In the mouth, it is quite sharp and crisp with a small amount of bite from the 8% alcohol. The flavor is a champagne-like sweetness and bitterness with a touch of spice, and the aftertaste is a pleasant bitterness on the tongue. Overall, a nice beer, but probably my least favorite Chimay. And, the price is a bit steep at $6.99 for a 750ml."
"This pours with a gorgeous fluffy white head that sticks to the glass, leaving excellent lacing. Nice deep gold liquid. The nose is wonderfully aromatic, with lots of hops and some sweetness too. The taste is effervescent, sharp and quite bitter, with fruity yeast esters showing up as well. Finishes with a super long hoppy dryness. I notice a difference in the 11.2 oz. bottle I drank, compared to the corked 750ml. version. I like the smaller version better, a wonderful hoppy Tripel."
"Not bad, but if this as good as the Tripels get I need to aquire a taste for them still then.."
"I quite liked this beer, i'll have it again, and again, and again."
"Although I enjoyed Cinq Cents on tap and would get it again in a heartbeat I feel the bottled version is superior."
"This beer pours with almost no head and has a cloudy orange appearance.  To me it had a fruity aroma that was pleasing.  Taste at first sip was a little sweet for my taste, but mellowed out as i drank more.  Nice mouthfeel to it and for me very drinkable, i rated it a little low here for the beginners.......CHEERS"
"Hazy sub-orange color with a good head and a nice mountainous ring in the middle. Acrid aroma, sets the nasal hairs on edge, bitter sub-edge of cheese. Carbonated mouthfeel, slight medicinal twang piles on to a knife-like sour raisin maltiness. Sense of spice. Finishes crisp with a little aftertaste, but falls in a dryish category. Everything is a little too sharp in this brew to me. Probably my least favorite Chimay offering."
"Sampled on draught in Antwerp, Belgium, to me was the same as the bottle version, perhaps a bit smoother, with less of a spicy palate, still quite gutsy, spicy, yeasty, orangy, loved it!!!!"
"Thick cloudy golden color.  Huge fluffy thick and sticky head with sticky lace all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Sweet, fruity, citrus, spicy alcoholic nose.  Smooth, spicy, sweet, fruity, peppery taste. Complex, delicious and well balanced.  The malt sweetness and yeastiness was a joy.  Medium body, plenty of carbonation, and very smooth. Very nice finish"
"Very nice aroma that I could not identify single smells in.  Every time I thought I smelled something, a new odor would come out.  Gold in color with a nice white head.  Slightly sweet and slightly bitter but overall very spicy and zesty.  Very enjoyable indeed."
"Pale with a touch of orange and a nice thick pale sheen on the brew.  Strong alcohol/yeast/slightly sweet nose.  Very smooth mouth with the taste of white pepper, and a touch of lemon.  As it warms it becomes more hoppy/fruity.  This is the classic belgian white...."
"Hazy but w/out the large sediment normally found in the bottled version. Peachy in color w/ a fine creamy head that slowly dies to a 1/16", but leaves an excellent lace throughout the goblet. The aroma is somewhat chameleon-like in it's changing nature. In many ways, this defines the entire beer.The aroma is loaded w/ yeast, spice, sugary hints, light fruit and fresh hop. Coming & going are light aromas of raisin, orange, apricot, peach, honey, wild flowers, citrus, coriander, and pepper. The body is medium & the mouthfeel is creamy soft -almost cottony- due to the fine (but high level) of carbonation. Very lively but not sharp. The flavor wanders much like the aroma, varying it's intensity between sweetness, yeastiness, spiciness, acidity and bitter qualities. The flavors starts gently spicy and zesty w/ some hop bite, and an occasional flash of lightly sour acidity, eventually softening as it warms and loses carbonation, allowing more alcohol, sweetness and yeastiness to dominate. As you go through the glass these characteristics interact in different ways, giving it complexity. The finish is generally spicy and hoppy, w/ a quenching acidity and lingering yeastiness - although some more sweetness and fruit appears to linger towards the end of the serving. Firm, dry & hoppy w/ complexity. Not challenging, but interesting. The draft version clearly appears fresher, almost w/ a brighter taste, and is missing some of the mustiness of the bottles."
"This beer has a hint of apples and bananas. The balance of fruit, alcohol and bitterness is well balanced and complex. So far this is one of the best belgium beers I've tasted so far!"
"A rather yeasty, estery nose leads to a rather spicy, fruity start - apple, coriander, bitter orange, hints of banana... Very nicely complex. As the sip goes on the alcohol & bitterness come to the forefront and round things out a bit. It finishes spicy, warming, with undertones of the aforementioned fruits.  A rather ""tingly"" mouthfeel is the only distraction.   As the brew warms, this dissipates and the bitterness in the brew increases.  Very enjoyable sipping brew."
"Better off of the tap than those bottled-bound offerings.  Easier to drink.  Try it if you can.  Cheers"
"The appearance is a slight a cloudy orange color almost glowing. The head is super smooth, slightly sticky but leaves a perfect sheet of lace. On the nose there are aromas of orange peels, pepper, and a slight citrus aroma. More and the same on the palate, fruity, orange peels, coriander, peppery, nicely sweet, slightly tart as well, just well rounded and balanced! Excellent brew!"
"Spicy and peppery are the key words here. An interesting brew, something quite out of the ordinary - but given the choice, I would most definitely still prefer the Chimay Blue."
"138"
"This bottle had a date on the cork of 03-2000, yeast sediment still seemed a bit unsettled. Hazed golden straw with a very active carbonation that holds the firm white lace together. Ripe apple skin and medicinal aroma with some pale grainy malt and earthy yeast. Richly textured with the ultra smooth and highly crisp mouth feel, carbonation is high though it is the perfect fixture and helps a bit in drinkability. Hop bitterness is quick but somewhat potent which is followed by an earthy yeast that has a soft powdery quality to it. Big fruitiness, with bold yet suitable alcoholic esters that don’t get too flamboyant. Alcohol is a bit illusory, you know its there but not at the 8.0% level. Grainy maltiness with hints of raw orange blossom honey and a good dose of medicinal phenols. Touch of sweetness upfront but eternally dry in the finish. This bottle has peaked and I am glad I had it now and not later down the road."
"A good triple, slightly on the dry side, must be poured very slowly - serious carbonation, head never dissipates completely.  Very complex beer with slightly hoppy finish."
"Chimay sets the standard for Belgian tripel. A nicy foamy head leaves lace all the way down the glass. Light fruit aroma and flavor becomes more pronounced as it sits in the glass. It's also very drinkable. Nice work, boys. In hindsight, I haven't come back to his beer as often as I though I would."
"The head is very dense and persistent, and leaves a true Belgian lace down the tulip glass.  The aroma is superlative and complex. Acetaldehyde (green apple) and unripe pear notes hits the nose at first, a pronounced clean fructose - like sweetness follows, finishing with a estery lemony tartness and trace phenol and fusel alcohol.  The meager hop nose is lost amongst the complex estery aroma.  A honey - like sweetness bathes the tip of the tongue, but more complex caramelized sugars and light acidity round everything out.  Mild toasty malt is noticeable and adds to the complexity of this brew.  Subdued biscuity notes can be discerned as well, adding yet another layer of flavors.  Hop bitterness and flavor is paltry and would've gotten in the way of other flavors.  Cinq Cents is medium in body and very smooth in mouthfeel, yet retains a crispness that lends excellent drinkability.   It finishes with a very pleasant alcohol warmth and yeasty mustiness.  Complex, yet soft.  Delicious!  The alcohol strength is superbly hidden.  The 750 ml and 11 oz. bottles can be very different... I'm updating my review after tasting a 750.  Although fairly young (bottled 10/01) the overall balance is superb.  The real deal."
"Anyway what can I say about this beer that hasn't already been better said below?  I tried the 33cl size bottle.  Pours with a large white head, well carbonated.  Clear dark golden yellow color.  Smells very yeasty/fruity.  Medium body.  A fairly sweet beer to start but finishes dry and slightly bitter.  The alcohol seems more pronounced in the finish as well, you notice it but it's not over powering."
"Wow.  I think that the Monks at this abbey have apparently gotten very close with god.  How else are their beers so consistently amazing?  This brew pours a clear golden with a frothy thick head that maintains all the way down.  A slight bitterness, with alcohol and fruity flavors coming in.  Very crisp and highly drinkable."
"An exceptional brew from Chimay. Hazy, golden appearance with a dense off white head. Fruity aroma and a fine, prickly carbonation level, but considerably smoother than other trippels that are too champagne like. Peppery yeast spiciness pricks at the taste buds. Malt sweetness and fruitiness (subtle grape and apricot?) in the middle. Alcohol warming sensation is pleasant and not overwhelming. Delicious."
"Notes: Yet another outstanding, unique and complex beer from Abbaye de Scourmont. Wonderful stuff."
"Very nice.  Not as complex as some Tripels, but sometimes you want something that is not so assertive."
"My least favorite of the three"
