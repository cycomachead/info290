3.69,0,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Poured a nice golden color but not much head. I detected belgian candi sugars, raisins, alcohol and medicinal aromas. Taste is fruity, as in green grapes, medicinal and perhaps slightly too boozy for my taste. A dry finish leaves a phenolic aftertaste. Strong carbonation, full bodied and very alcoholic especially as it warms. This is a sipper given the high ABV. The alcohol does produce a nice warming effect. Not a bad belgian style american made ale, however, it has its flaws.","Gajo74","Mar 17, 2015"

The aroma after the initial pour is a typical Belgian Style Ale with a spice and fruit accent that draws the imbiber in. As you drink, you become aware of hints of vanilla and clove from the malt and a hops kick near the end. In your mouth is a smooth, almost lush, caress of your tongue and gentle wash of your palate. Just bear in mind the 10% ABV can provide a real kick to those not familiar with the higher ABV that can be found in Belgian and such styled ales. This is hardly a chugging bear. It is the beer you enjoy amongst friends over an hour or two.","RUNYYFan","Jan 02, 2015"

Pours to a translucent deep orange with a wispy head that fades fast. On the taste the first thing that hits is the mouthfeel, this brew is syrup thick. On the taste there is a sweet fruitiness with citrus and banana esters. Consistent taste throughout then the real flavor comes through in the aftertaste: a little bite of very slightly bitterness mostly tart and a sense of the ABV that this brew packs but it still remains very hidden. An extremely smooth drinker, too smooth though in that it doesn't have much going on and that with a 10% ABV is a stealth bender.","mooseisloose","Aug 02, 2014"

Crisp, carbonatey, and creamy on the mouthfeel. Taste is ruddy, very balanced, malty enough for anyones liking but not overdone. I really like it. Certainly not a session beer and not just cuz of the awesome ABV; its like a fine desert in how rich it is. But perfect on a snowy day like today.

A slightly aggressive pour yields two fingers of frothy white foam quickly rising up and spilling out of the glass a little bit. Head retention is decent, but there's not much lacing left at all. There's a little bit of banana bubblegum to the nose, with some delicate nutmeg aromas providing a bit of balance. There are some peachy stone fruit and banana flavors to greet my palate, before a warming booze and the more citrus coriander notes set it. The nutmeg and clove finish is very subtle. The balance just isn't there for me though, it's too much fruit and citrus that's not offset enough by the nutmeg and spice. The mouthfeel is very mediocre for a Belgian style beer. The body is to flabby, but just by a bit. The real issue is in the carbonation which is noticeably lacking in its liveliness. Tripel Horse is an alright brew, but it's not a great Belgian style beer, and it's probably not even the best tripel brewed in the state (which would be Flying Fish Exit 4).","axeman9182","Nov 28, 2012"

There is a yeasty and fruity aroma to the beer. There may be a hint of vanilla in there as well. There is certainly some vanilla in the flavor, as well as some alcohol, sweet sugars, and an overall creaminess. I like the creamy character, but there is something about the alcohol aftertaste that I do not like very much. It also leaves a bit of a mouthcoating that is characterized by the leftover carbonation bubbles sticking to my tongue. It has a medium body and leaves some stickiness on my lips. This is a fairly drinkable beer. As I mentioned, I don't like the aftertaste too much, but besides that I am enjoying this glass.

The aroma was mild with citrus fruits, citrus hops, cloves, and fruity esters. If it's swirled around a nice sized aroma of ripe banana will emerge from the background. The taste strated off with citrus fruits and fruity esters. After the esters have passed, in comes banana, cloves, citrus hops, and alcohol infused with citrus flavoring. It was a medium bodied beer with a faint aftertaste of yeast, cloves, and citrus hops. It however mask it's high 10% ABV. Not the best Belgian Triple, but it is a decent American one.

I don't get much of the vanilla esters in the aroma, i'm reminded more of a the aroma of peach Jolly Rancher candy. VERY sweet aroma, decent carbonation. Taste isn nowhere near as sweet as the aroma (thank goodness). Slight hint of the peachy/vanilla aroma with a sharp dry spiciness. There's a kind of peppery bitterness on the end and in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat sparkly. All in all, an interesting Tripel.

The body of this beer is light with not much dimension, but easy-going and non-threatening. I guess one could totally ax this brew for its infantile and less than Tripel characteristics, but this beer drinks quite well with the alleged 10% ABV well repressed within. This beer lacks the level of carbonation that would provide a better tasting experience; as such a light version of the style is way to still to create true quaffing excitement.

Very, very smooth and dry in the finish. The aftertaste is a bit cloying at first and even a bit astringent, but that quickly changes to a sweet, lingering taste that demands another sip to quench. Tastes very much like a mild sparkling wine. I couldn't believe the ABV was 10%, it could easily have been half that without a difference in taste, that's how well it is masked.

3.93,6.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Fiery orange gold. Absolutely beautiful color. Good clarity, with a short white head. Holds a collar throughout. Sweetened, fruity malt aroma. Candi sugar, mild floral hops, pineapple and caramel apple. Opens with a blast of sugar, enveloping the palate with a slick, greasy sweetness. Heaps of fruit. Baked, caramelized apple, pineapple chunks, melon and honey into the finish. Plenty of phenols to match, manifesting themselves as a plastic overtone. Spicy, floral hops blend nicely with the spicy, peppery yeast. A light wash of alcohol boosts the sweetness some, finishing just shy of cloying. Great carbonation, spritzy, yet just enough to carry through the rather haevy body. Leaves my tongue fairly dry, surprisingly. Overly sweet, perhaps. Balanced, with the spicy finish and phenols. Drinking a bottle takes me some time, mainly because the sugar gets a little overbearing. Still, very nicely done, especially for a brewery that doesn't specilize in belgian styles.","UnionMade","Oct 12, 2005"

3.35,-9.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8"" off-white head above the clear light amber brew. Head quickly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, with reasonable lacing, both of which seem to be more or less to style. Aroma is malt sweetness and alcohol, with some spicing reminiscent of Belgians. Taste resembles the nose, spicy sweetness covering fruity alcohol. Mouthfeel is a bit thick, could use some more carbonation to smooth it out, and drinkability gets cloying with the sugar bent of this one. Not a bad brew, but I was hoping for more.","ppoitras","Sep 22, 2005"
3.05,-17.3,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Clear golden orange with light white head that shrinks into the body quickly with no signs of lace. Very sweet aroma, some fruity scents including apple. Very little spice and fairly big alcohol notes. The taste is very similar with big sweetness making up most of the flavor. Some light fruit and spice is lurking about. The alcohol stands out a bit too much. Sweet and with an alcohol bite is how this finished. Pretty solid mouthfeel, what you would expect. Fairly warming as well due to the big alcohol. Not bad just not interesting to me. It really didnt have enough of everything but the sweetness and alcohol.","meathookjones","Aug 10, 2005"

4.12,11.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This brew is a tawny, amber color. Its quite clear, and has a wispy, white head. Seems a little under-carbonated for the style. The aroma is something: alcohol and spice, strong vanilla, peppermint and sugar, bananas, grain, roasted malt. Theres a lot going on in that smell. The taste is full and sweetits peppery-spicy, and has a slight alcohol warming sensation. Its certainly mouth-filling, and very relaxing. The flavor and mouthfeel are great, but not quite up to the fantastic aroma. Some of those initial complexities get left behind. Finish has a restrained bitterness, and a lot of peppery spice. Solid and enjoyable brew.","Suds","Jul 31, 2005"

3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Sampled a 12 ouncer, no freshness indication provided on the label. Pours an orangy shade of copper/amber. Suprisingly clear, minimal yeast /sediment in this one. Head is light and white and it leaves wispy and stringy lacing. Nose I picked up is some light coriander like spicing and some Belgian yeast esters. This is a fruity, dry, enjoyable brew. More like a hearty Belgian pale ale to me then a tripel, but who really cares what they call it. This is a pleasant and worthy U.S, take on the style. Strong and flavorful, well worth a try. Best stuff I've had from RH.","Billolick","Jul 03, 2005"

3.6,-2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Honey amber color from top to bottom, because if you are looking for head, look somewhere else. This beer has a definite fruit smell. I am going to say maybe apple, peach and vanilla. The taste says the same....fruity and sweet. Tastes like a good Belgian attempt. If you are looking for a solid Tripel without too sweet a taste, look no further.","robertp1024","Jul 01, 2005"
4.05,9.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Hmmmm... This is a nice surprise. Pours a rich amber in color. Perfectly clear. No head though, no matter how hard I tired. Aroma is a bit fruity, peaches... Getting hints of yeast also. Flavor is really impressive. Malts come through at first very quickly followed by some very sweet Belgian sugars. Yeast flavors also, I had to look into the bottle to see if it was bottle conditioned. Also, picking up some apples coming through in the yeast. Very smooth drinking with this great interpretation of the style. The only down side is the alcohol, it comes through a bit too much (but at 10%, that is not a surprise). Gotta love those phenols.","MuddyFeet","Jun 30, 2005"

3.7,0.3,3,3,4,4,4,"Pours a somewhat golden color-a bit darker then most tripels. No real head. Low aroma-somewhat yeasty and sweet. Malty flavor upfront. A very slight phenolic flavor . Some hop bitterness. Still sweeter then what I think a tripel should be. Has some good body to it. Overall a nice beer. Very much a US version of a triple-much more then Victory's Golden Monkey which is far more complex. I do have to say this is the first beer from River Horse that I can honestly say was worth trying","lackenhauser","Jun 03, 2005"

3.75,1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured out a deep yellow/golden color with an ever so slight layer of carbonation on top. Smell was somewhat decent. Starts out with a few tropical fruits mixed with some spices. Sugar and vanilla also stand out in the aroma department. Taste wasn't bad I thought. The fruity/citrus flavors really show their strength and make it stand out, along with some spiciness, which is weaker than I thought it was going to be considering it was strong in the nose. The aftertaste was all vanilla which seemed to last forever. Moutthfeel was full bodied with a lack of carbonation. It was quite drinkable though. Not really a true tripel, but it seemed they wanted to have fun with this one and kinda worked. Worth a try for sure.","necoadam","May 04, 2005"

3.53,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Slight, just off-white head settles over clear dark amber/bronze liquid. Candy sweet malty nose with light spiciness. Taste is fruity, a bit too sweet with brief hop bitterness, some hard to pin down spices and a strange bitterness. Can't say I really taste any alcohol here (10%abv). Finishes too sweet/cloying to really enjoy more than one bottle but it's nice to see this brewery attempting a bolder style of beer.","beerluvr","Mar 13, 2005"
3.55,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy apple juice in color. Head is non-existent. Ring is barely there. Smells of musty clove and sweet fruit: big-time pineapple juice. Taste is interesting. It's got that apple profile but not like fresh, crisp apples; it's more like something a little more ripe. Tastes dry, then sweet, then dry, then sweet. It's kind of strange in that sense. Finishes bittersweet and dries the mouth slowly and completely. First sip warms the tongue and insides almost immediately. The ABV is noticeable at 10%. Feels thick and full with a little spritz in there. Slick on the tongue. An interesting tripel but a little too alcoholic and lacking in complexity for the genre.","oxmasterscream","Mar 10, 2005"
4.1,11.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very balanced aroma that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with a dominating Belgian yeast finish. It is fruity and quite refreshing. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and slightly tart. It is one of the most drinkable tripels I've ever had. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent sessions brew. It has a refreshing aroma and a smooth, balanced flavor; a good drinker.","WesWes","Feb 14, 2005"
