"I think this one is underrated. Just sayin'."

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours clear golden orange with a small white head, smells yeasty and biscuity with spicy hops, tastes yeasty with warm maltiness smooth easy hops on the end, creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish."

""
""
"This beer does not get nearly enough credit for the tripel ale that it is. So many people buy this beer expecting another classic 'Victory' production (hoppy, seedy, earthy, etc) but this is so different and magnificent. Packs a really enjoyable smooth taste."
""
"Amazing. Good carbonation, a sour aftertaste, definetly golden look. Sometimes you can taste an alcahol aftertaste is the only downside, but with a 9.5% its good"
""

"Reminds me of home / Family"
"First sip at Union Cattle Hermosa Beach fall 2011 with Guillermo."

""

"Overall I would buy this beer again if I was seeking something with high alcohol and a little different from my normal ipa or porter/stout mood. Will definitely leave you warm and loose after a few of these"

"I was very disappointed with this beer. This is the first and last time I will be trying a beer from Victory Brewing. I'm sorry, but to be completely honest, I haven't had a beer quite this unpleasant tasting in a very long time. I would like to get my money back for this one."
"O:  Not bad.  A decent, easy to find Tripel that is quite strong and pretty cheap."
""
""
"Fantastic...  a great Belgian beer, smooth, spicy and very easy to drink.  Don't know why there are so many negatives."
"Reminded me of a true Belgian beer."
"Horrible taste, horrible aftertaste.  Nasty."

"Not a bad effort by a brewery far better known for its stellar pilsner than Belgian style ales. Gorgeous golden color and a rapidly dissipating bright white one finger head. Yeast wafts from the pour. There is a dusty, musty yeast undertone that is not unpleasant, but might put some off. The mouthfeel is also noticeably unlively for the style. The high concentration of booze is virtually unnoticeable. In the end, it's a decent attempt, and one that I would enjoy drinking get again, but there are many superior offerings in this style elsewhere. La Fin du Monde and Long Strange Tripel come immediately to mind."

"Powerful so watch out. Drink carefully"
"Winter Haven Beer Crawl - Potthast Studio"
""
"Solid tripel, crisp and balanced. Nice golden color and thick white head. Grape on the nose, yeasty.  Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation, refreshing. the 9.5abv well covered. I enjoyed this overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I've had."
""
"Good beer"
""
""
""
""
"I had a 1/6 of this at a birthday party a few years back.  Amazing but forgot to warn people of the abv.  Things got a little crazy that night.  So drinkable and delicious!"
"There are better, cheaper triples out there, go find em'."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"        Overall, I'll give Golden Monkey - Victory Brewing Company a 4.75. This would be damned perfect if the wine was a just a hair more profound, but I can certainly dig this. Even though I'm reviewing this in the winter, this brew would really hit the spot on a spring or even summer night. I recommend this beer and will pick it up again."
""
""
""
"It is really Really good"
"I was surprised at the abv , thought it smooth and very drinkable."
"That is all"
""
"Smooth. Not too hoppy. Hint of spice. A slight taste of vanilla in first drink, though it's not overwhelming and goes away after first drink. Aftertaste is minimal. Not outstanding but  worth a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with mild spritzy carbonation, a medium body and a slightly bitter finish that is sweet and on the drier side. A good beer that is middle of the road for the style, but always nice to have around since Victory is only a few hours from NY so this beer is always fresh and available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer from Victory"

"Pretty smooth. Nice ABV  Had this beer on draft at the County Grill in Newport News"
"I liked the golden color. Not much head. Nice spicey, belgian smell. Taste was quite of a decent belgian. Have always enjoyed this one from the first time I had it."
"I generally like Victory brews. This one I did not. I felt the color was not appealing, the mouth feel watery and taste of bitterness did not sit well with me. I am not sure what it is but the bitter after taste over powered the experience of this brew for me."
""
"There is a strong banana aroma and flavor, not surprising Ina Tripel. The spices that were added are rather overwhelmed. Mouthfeel is nice, not as thick as expected."
""
""
""
"So good, love the spicy after taste."
""
"Pours with a small white head. Is golden in color and very murky. Has a sweet ale aroma with a hint of spice. Has a mild cirtus flavor that balances  well with the added spices."
""
"I had to give this a second chance.  I still found it challenging to consume.  Maybe good for you, but not for me."
"A basic Tripel that packs a punch.  My favorite thing about it is that I can find Victorys Golden Monkey just about anywhere which makes it my go to Tripel."
"Had on draft. Pleasant Banana Notes. Not a fan of the finish, crappy alcohol taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tripels are my favorite and this is right up there with the better US versions. Fruits, herbs and a bit of sweetness completely hide the 9.5 ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a fan of all Belgium triples, and Golden Monkey does not disappoint. Very easy to drink; which makes it hard to notice the 9.5% ABV."
""
"Love the complexity.  Smell, taste, aftertaste all work so well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not a bad tripel, but far too sweet for my liking. I was surprised to discover that it is at least AU$120 a case - no way in the world."
""
""
"Floral up front followed by a prickly spice and bready notes with yeasty flavors. Lots of warming alcohol on this one that takes away from the rest of what this brew has going for it. Never the less, this is a nice sipper on a cold evening like tonight. Cheers!"
"I'm not sure what they put in this, but it gave me hives. I've never had an allergic reaction before. The beer was so fantastic, however, that I finished the last pint before having my girl friend drive up to Walgreens to get me some benadryl."
""
"Amazing Belgium triple beer made in the us"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. The first one is always a little sharp on my tongue, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
"By far my favorite beer. Smoothest tripel and at over 9% abv victory really hit a home run with this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For the amount of alcohol, this beer is great."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied with a smooth drinkable feel. There is a great warming feel that helps ease down and leaves pleasant aftertaste that gives off a slight sweetness before dissipating."
"Very sweet. Not very complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"BB date of Oct 2017, 12 oz pour into std pint glass.  Clear medium gold color with nice medium carbonation.  Not much head retention and minimal lacing.  Spicy Belgian aroma.  Flavor is classic Belgian but with a finish of apricots and cinnamon.  I think the mouthfeel is a little light but I still think that the alcohol is well-hidden.  If you are a serious student of Belgian triples, this beer may disappoint.  For the rest of us, it is a delightful entry to the genre and very enjoyable.  Victory does a great job overall."
"Just not that into this one"
""
"Love the combination of spices; usually drink with Indian food or hot wings."
"Does in fact pour an elegant gold. Well carbonated, strong head that dies down fairly quickly. Some persistent lacing. Small amount of sediment. Med-heavy bodied with an alcoholicy backbone (no surprise with and ABV of 9.5%). Aroma is of belgian spiciness, yeasty and citrusy. Flavor is that plus the alchy backbone. Lingering alchy warmth and subtle bitterness. Decent tripel. Like all tripels, it's one and done. 3.75."
""
"not a huge fan of this beer, very alcohol forward with smell of rotten apricots."
""
""
""
"Would be better if it weren't so bitter."
""

"Tripel ale with added spices. Good beer but I'm not a spiced beer fan"

"A little spicy. Nice Tripel. ABV is up there at 9.5. Nice bittetness"
"Very tasteful for abv. A little thick."
""
""
""
"Basically an average triple, nothing really stands out, but is still decent. I think it could use a bit more complexity, the funky flavors tend to overwhelm a bit, would like to see more fruit and pepper. Not a bad beer, just not a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Does a decent job for a tripel"

"""Tripel Ale With Spice Added," it says. It definitely does provide some spice."

"Pours a light orange color with a thin white bubbly head that quickly recedes. No lacing. Lots of visible carbonation.. Aroma is of fruit, yeast and spices. Yeast is a little overbearing. A lot more yeast in the taste. Followed by bready malts. A good deal of fruitiness, with no particular flavor standing out. Fruit lingers on the tongue quite a bit, playing nicely with the yeast. Didn't care for the taste much at first, but it grew on me as it warmed. Medium bodied. Carbonation isn't as heavy as it had appeared after pour. A surprisingly easy drinker for 9.5%. Although I am not particularly well versed in Tripels, I was expecting a bit more from this one. Still a solid beer, but not a must have."

"First offering from Victory and this one was a good way to start with them.  Although I wasn't overly impressed with the brew out of the bottle - it didn't appear particularly distinctive to me, and it did have a weak head, there was real nice lacing down the glass.  The scent put out was okay, hints of citrus with a feel that was very bold and inviting - crisp really, making it easy to chug (if you weren't careful.)  Overall I consider it very good and look forward to trying more from this brewer."

"A very average beer that seems to only be popular solely due to its high ratio of alcohol to cost. I would hazard to say that this is the beer equivalent of a fortified wine like night train since it has a distinct booziness that really does not taste like it was naturally produced by the brewing process. I thought I would like this one considering I love a complex high abv beer, but this is simply not good enough to justify grabbing unless your primary consideration is getting as hammered as possible off beer cheaply. This is still worth trying at least once considering its popularity and availability, but I would be willing to bet anyone that has drank a wide range of beers would not consider this one a go to."

"Another really good beer from Victory Brewing here, probably the best one of the five I have now tried of theirs and it's not as if they've been feeding me poor beers up to this point. This one is incredibly well balanced and manages to hide the high alcohol very well with only a touch coming through towards the end of the taste. This one is excellent from start to finish and up there with the best that Belgium has to offer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.95) This lacks the full taste and body of a tripel.  I find it light in all aspects. Could be a good starter tripel. It is a solid beer after all said and done, but not what i go for in a tripel. I much preferred Weyerbachers version"
""
""
"In spite of this, it is a nice beer. Tasty and smooth drinking.  Pretty to look at and worth having another."
""
""
""
"Overall - Really a delicious beer, lots of banana and more spice forward than other tripels I've had. It's missing on the breadiness just a bit but I really like the flavors here - think spiced bananas foster. Alcohol is very well hidden so drink with care, this one could catch you off guard. A bit different for the style, but give this one a try nonetheless."

"I do take exception though to the name ""Golden Monkey", as there are no monkeys in North America.  How about ""Golden Retriever",  the perfect dog, though perhaps maybe lacking,  but on the label, surrounded by rays of light.  I've drinken about 1 and 3/4 of Golden Monkeys now, so, maybe that clouds my judgment."
""
""
""
"I like this, but the alcohol is a little much. Nice yeast profile and maltiness. The hops are present in the beginning and then fade away to the alcohol bitterness and yeastiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay, drinkable, not my favorite. I would buy another one in the right situation."
""

"Wife's Review: ""More mild than I expected. I like it, but probably wouldn't have more than one."""
""
""
"Thank You Victory Brewing Company for creating this smooth golden concoction with a kick! NOT to sound like a total ""LUSH"" but it is nice to drink 2 or 3 bottles of Golden Monkey and still get the same ""BUZZ"" as you get from 6 or 7 regular beers. How did they get a beer with this much Alcohol (9.50% ABV) to taste this good?"
""
""

"This beer! Pours the dankest golden yellow to ever fill a glass. Much like the color of urine when you're extremely dehydrated and perhaps have taken some Aleve or ibuprofen. Following the instructions and giving a vigorous pour to raise a foamy head , the aromas really opened . I also allowed it to slowly warm as I was mopping and bleaching the kitchen floor since my dog has some kind of bladder issues that make her eat dog food that makes her pee more, which is good for her but bad if you happen to have to work all day. One word: linoleum. Linoleum floors everywhere. And the taste is great . Very smooth."

"Having tried Dirtwolf and really liking this, I gave this a try. Poured out of a bomber, the color and aroma were awesome. A very flavorful beer -- very smooth, not a lot of bite and really tasty. I don't understand the overall BA rating atr all. Much better than advertised. Give it a try!"

"Great triple, tipple not my usual not my usual. an unusual  but still vary very good."
""
"Very tasty and cheap Belgian Style Triple.  It's no where near the level of a Trappist Ale, but it's very good and strong for the $1.40 I can get it for at World Market during their 30% off Build Your Own Six-Pack sale."

"I guess this is one of those beers that proves that different people can taste things very differently.  I took one sip of this and couldn't believe how bad it was.  I came here and looked it up and was surprised that it had so many good reviews.  Maybe I got a bad bottle.  I may try it again but I won't be going out of my way to find it."

"O:  Just meh.  Really disappointing for its style.  3.25/5.00"

"Poured a rich golden color with a good lasting head.  The aroma is dominated by cloves and other spices I can't quite pick out.  The flavor is a decent enough balance of the spices and malt with hops in the background.  Very dry finish.  Decent carbonation and mouth feel.  Overall a good effort if you like this style."

"I just picked up a 4-pack of Victory's DirtWolf IIPA only to find that someone had swapped one with a Golden Monkey. This was my first time trying Victory. Based on the reviews, I didn't have much expectation. However, I am very pleasantly surprised. This beer is incredibly balanced for being 9.5% in my opinion. Some reviewers are saying that it tastes very strong, I didn't find that to be the case at all. Sweet and creamy tripel. Paired incredibly well with spicy food."

"O - Again, don't focus on each sip. Just enjoy it."
"Bright pale gold in the glass the head starts out about a finger thick and then settles to a fine film on the top of the liquid. The smell is quite yeasty at least that is the first thing I notice. Behind that there is a bit of banana maybe some lemon or citrus and finally some bready/wheaty malt. This beer starts out quite sweet, the malt comes through but it doesn't seem much more than a single dimension. There is some bitterness but just a touch and some peppery spiciness but again everything seems kind of muted and like it needs more. Some of the alcohol comes through in this one which I maybe expected for the style but that tied with the sweetness reducing the mouthfeel a bit for me. Overall I'd have to say that this is just so so maybe a nice attempt but I would have expected better from this brewer."

"This American Belgian pours a luminous clear golden with thick white head that dissipates to thin white bubbles and light lacing. Smell of light fruit, apple, lemon, fresh bread, and sweet Belgian candy sugar. Taste is velvety smooth with tastes of crisp apple, lemon zest, Belgian yeast, a hint of clove, and loads of Belgian candy sugar. Warming and boozy up front and on the sides, sweetness on the aftertaste and throughout with a light white pepper coming through---not overpowering though. SOLID Belgian brewed in an American style. While the notes of this brew from the bottle are somewhat favorable I would challenge naysayers to try it on growler at cellar temperatures. I currently have this in the fridge in bottle form, but wanted to try it on growler before giving a review since I have had it before and loved the growler so much more for it's depth of character."

"Overall I am a sucker for most Belgian abby beers and this doesn't disappoint. Really tastes like a nice replication of the true thing for an American replication. Really love this beer and highly recommend it. To be truthful... I am just a sucker for any beer that has this nice yeasty taste. I just love these beers."

"Just tried it for the first time recently and I must say I really did enjoy it. The higher alcohol content drew me in and I wasnt expecting much from the taste standpoint but I really was very good. It was sweet tasting initially and then a little bit spicy with a hoppy feel to it as well. I will definitely buy this beer again."
""
""
""
"This one poured a champagne gold with a modest head that retreated quickly with low to modest lacing. The smell is yeasty, spicy and has fruit overtones of banana and lemon. Very nice. The taste follows suit, though as it warmed there was a little bit of a metalic bitterness, otherwise pleasant. The mouthfeel is a highlight, creamy with a spicy tingle that draws you to the next sip. For a 9.0 ABV brew this one did not show it's hand until I had finished the glass (happily). Victory has crafted a fine tripel that hits on most of the style points to make this one a winner."

"Altogether this is easily one of my overall favorite beers. Drinking one is an occasion in and of itself as it tastes a bit like dessert and is the alcohol content equivalent of two or so ""normal"" beers. To the guys at victory, keep up the good work. Cheers."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/16/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, pepper, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, apricot, pear, apple, coriander, clove, bread, cracker, candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome tripel style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/eartly yeast, spice, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"It has a really nice color. Like you melted down your wedding band and made beer out of it. It doesn't smell really good so it's best to drink it in big gulps and not breathe through your nose while doing that. It's got something is in it like cinnamon but I don't know about herbs so it could be arsenic. All in all, it was good. But then again I've never met a beer I didn't like, scratch that, didn't drink."

"O: My first Tripel, and I'm glad it is local and available year-round. A heavy punch for the price, good enough to try again."

"Not much of a smell to it, and poured it into a snifter no less. Color is a nice golden hue, hence the name. Minimal head, nice mouthfeel with a delightful aftertaste of light hops. I definitely taste the spices it advertises but i'm not going to lie, I can only say what I think I taste and thats basil. Hint of citrus after you have sipped it a bit. The monkey has a whopping 9.5 APV and gives a nice warm buzz, only drink a couple if you don't want to be hammered. Shame on you monkey! You should be spanked! If your new to this beer, drink slightly chilled. I prefer it room temp."

"Golden Monkey is a great triple with a perfect balance of spice and maltiness. Very surprised to see so many mixed reviews on this one. Maybe I'm a little sentimental as this was the first beer that got me into this style, but I can't seem to agree with many of the reviews on this one. You'd be hard pressed to convince me that this one isn't an extremely smooth, delicious, and very drinkable triple that hides it's 9.5% abv like a champ. I know there may be better examples of the style out there, but the value, quality, and balance of this one makes it a sure go to for me."

"Golden hued with a quarter inch of white foam head. Smell that Belgian yeast strain and candy sugar. I also get faint whiffs of pineapple and mango. The mouth is carbonated pretty generously which is true to style. The flavor is predominantly the Belgian yeast strain,Belgian candy sugar,pale malt, with a bit of a salty aftertaste that is slightly distracting,"

"Overall - a boozy treat that hides it's alcohol well and delivers on flavor. Although there are definitely some consistency issues and they should be glad I'm reviewing this bottle and not the last one I had, which was flat and flavorless in comparison, with none of the robust banana-wheat characteristics."

"O - Would not buy again. Rides the bench between spicy and fruity. Needs to commit--should hang out with my boyfriend of 3.5 years! Good beer pong beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark straw color with more than a finger of white head that enjoyed some retention and left a trace of lace behind. The distinct notes of Belgian yeast are in the nose. This offering is certainly malt forward. It starts sweet and then transitions to a classic Belgian sourness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a strange yellow in color for the style with a nice two finger white head with decent retention. Smell is what I would expect with bananas and cloves from the yeast. It smells pretty sweet which is nice but I'm not getting anything from the malt bill. Perhaps the sweetness is from a little malt but I would guess some Belgian candy sugar. Taste somewhat like I would expect from the style with what I sensed from the nose but I am getting an off flavor that I assume is coming from some hops that are a little too strong for the style although they are quite muted. I just really don't expect any hop bill that I can taste in a triple. Mouthfeel is right on for the style -- it's slightly thick but not anything over the top. Overall this is a decent try at a triple but I guess the hops through me off a little. It's not a bad beer but it's a little of for the style."

""
""
"O- This is a very solid beer. I would, order this again, of course, especially since I live about 20 minutes from the brewpub. However, ranking it among real Belgians, it is a bit of a long shot. Better than most North American brewers, other than Ommegang and Unibroue, so a job well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has quite a high gravity and is therefore expensive to buy, but I have to say that it isn't worth the money. The beer looks good in a glass and has a pretty good head on it. Comparing it to the Belgian style beers I have had, it lacks in taste. The main interest of this brew seems to be high alcohol content as opposed to an excellent taste. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for me, but I beer is the only carbonated beverage I drink so this might be something to which I am especially sensitive. Overall, this beer is decent, but I will certainly pick up something else the next time I visit the liquor store."

"O: Frankly this is a mess of a beer, and I have no idea how it has survived in production this long. The base tripel is mediocre at best, the coriander only makes it feel disjointed, and it's just too hot and solventy. Simply not up to snuff for the style, and not a good beer otherwise. But ultimately the market dictates production, and this beer still sells well enough to warrant keeping it around. This is perplexing to me. Who's drinking this?"

"Taste starts with a slightly grainy yeastiness, then moves on the banana, with a boozy, spicy, bready finish. Booze goes away quickly in the aftertaste and leaves yeasty bread, banana, and a bit of coriander, pepper, and clove lingering. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation."

This is everything that American craft beers aspire to. It may not be 100% up your alley (as it is mine), but you absolutely have to appreciate the attempt to be perfection."

"o – decent triple. better carbonation and reduction of astringency would improve this beer."

"Avoid, pass on and if you thought this was a well done review this is the beer for you. If you think I was rushing to put together words to score a crappy beer....well you nailed it. Still this is bad."

"Overall Impression: A nice quaff, very drinkable and exhibiting tasty peppery/clovey Belgian yeast notes with medium pale malt biscuitness. Falls a little short of Trappist and abbey tripels by not incorporating quite enough Belgian yeast character and a little too much citrusy ness. Definitely an American interpretation of the Belgian classic."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Light honeysuckle nose and flavor is sweet clove with some bitterness. Higher ABV is hidden. 12oz bottle, from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."
""
""
""
"Overall: Incredible brew. Well above average and to think its from the states it might surprise you. Easily one of Victory's better beers out there. Drinking not knowing anything about it you might think it's from Belgium itself. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer, but not anywhere near my favorite. All average qualities aside, I may pick up this beer again just for the amazing color, and for friends who are fans of the more bitter aspect of brewing, maybe to bring in my IPA friends to the world of tripels."
"O - Not a bad beer, but not outstanding. Tripel's aren't my favorite style, but this is a decent representation of the style. It's a little on the sweet side, but overall, it's not a bad beer. Certainly worth buying the Victory 'Variety of Victories' sampler."

"This isn’t an undrinkable or offensive beer, just a bit off when comparing it to the highly rated tripels I’ve had. It’s a good entry because it’s so drinkable despite being 9.5% ABV, but still not exactly what I’m looking for in a tripel."
""
""
""
""
"Decent hoppy Tripel, though it felt to me more like a Saison. That would be better rated if consider as such."

"I like this beer a lot, although not as much today as I did with the last bottle (I let it warm up a bit too long). This is a perfect 12-pack mix for my money (HopDevil, Headwaters, Prima and Golden Monkey) and I keep going back to the well, so Victory is clearly doing something right. But I'm not sure I would buy this beer by itself, especially in quantity. It's a good alternative to Victory's heavy hand with hops in the other three. But I wish the booze was less pronounced in this otherwise very nice Tripel. The spice notes are stronger than in traditional Tripels, but I like this flavor profile, which is reflected in my well-above-average rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy gold with a spirited four fingers of soft foamy head. Recedes slowly leaving behind lots of clinging lace.This tripel is down to brass tacks with a sweet yeast nose, sweet fruit, banana and some floral and spice from the understated hops. A little alcohol as well. On the nose it lacks brightness and elan. Malt is subtle and doesn’t over contribute leaving an earthiness underneath. On the palate it’s smooth and buttery but leaves a touch bitter and with more of an alcohol taste than there really should be. It’s a good strong tripel but it felt like it was lacking in refinement and luster."

"This pours a clear, golden yellow color with a slight, white head. The aroma is yeasty with banana and citrus. The taste is sweet and refreshing with lots of yeasty banana flavor.

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer has a VERY unique and ORIGINAL taste and smell. It is complex but not balanced, which would normally make me rate the beer lower, but because of the myriad of flavours that this beer produces and the high alcohol content (9.5%) I can see past the lack of balance. Worth a try."
""
"Pours a light gold/yellow color with a two finger white head. Smell is of banana, spice, and some other sweetness. Taste is much of the same. Quite spicy with a boozy kick at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth with below to average carbonation. Still very drinkable for a 9.5% ABV. A good tripel with spices, but there are much better."
"O- the best examples of Tripels are the ones that masterfully hide the high ABV in the beer, this one does not. The alcohol overpowers the traditional tripel flavors and makes it a bit of a boozy mess. I'll stick with the Belgian's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not an outstanding representation of the style by any means, but not terrible. I'e tried it once before the review, but I will most likely not visit again."
"Overall pretty good - a mix between Hoegaarden and Stella."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer, but it doesn't strike me as a Tripel Belgian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That being said, it's a 'good' beer, flavorful and pleasant but deceiving as that 9.5% ABV hits you and you're left wondering what did it. I wish Victory could have let the flavors speak for themselves in this beer. They're certainly using quality ingredients and they know what they're doing."

"poured into a chimay goblet. pours a hazy almost straw like color with sediment floating around and carbonation streaming from the bottom.smells fairly floral with bready and caramel notes. taste and mouthfeel - fairly medium to full body with some bitter hops up front and bready almost funky maltiness. overall a middle of the road tripel that would be alright for newbies to the style to try, but if you've had any of the belgian ones like westmalle, chmay white, or a ton of others it definently doesn't hold a candle. not half as complex as those."
"O-I have had better tripels and I have had worse tripels, so I guess this one is middle-of-the-road. High points for looks, in particular. The alcohol is a touch aggressive, and the complexity is not up to par with the best of the style, but I found this beer to be a decent representation of the style. I give this decent marks for emulation of old-world, Belgian style."
"A: Light straw yellow with white particulates. Smell is of coriander and wheat. Taste is like a strong wheat ale with a little coriander. Overall, the beer lacks some depth and doesn't have the complexity of others in this style. Not bad but doesn't stand up to Belgian tripel counterparts."

Definately a strong belgian ale. If you like these types of beers, I suggest you try this one. Complex flavors that work together to make good beer."
""

"Overall- i like this beer, but it would not be my first choice for a tripel. the aspirin/bubble gum notes threw me off this one, besides that its a respectable brew."
""
""
"O- The variety of flavors and spices that sit on your tongue make this beer fun to try; however, this beer is too malty/yeasty to be all-occasion choice. In addition, the high ABV makes it one with which you have to be careful!"

No. I got it in a pint, not a snifter and was psyched because it's 9.5% MOFOs! That makes the score better, because it made me happy!"

"O: There's a reason this is one of the beers that really got me into crafts. It's delicious when fresh, but beware, check your bottle dates before you leave the store and if it's a little old then grab from the back of the cooler. It should age a bit better, I hope."

"I gave this beer a number of shots at different points over the last few months. While I love other beers brewed by Victory, this one just does not do it for me. While yes it is high in ABV, the taste just does not really do it for my pallet. I suggest anyone venturing into this beer, but a single or six pack first. I think you will either love it or hate it, and there is really no middle ground."

"Hands down the most disgusting beer I've ever tasted. Pours a neon lemon-lime gatorade yellow. Smells like bubble gum. Overwhelmingly strong. Tastes like bubble gum, pine needles, and wood. Way too strongly hopped - not sure if fits the style, but this beer is just gross. Unpalatable even. Read the other reviews to see if it's something you'd like. Mine is biased in the numbers, but I couldn't even finish this one."
""
"O- Not a huge fan of this beer mostly because I keep tasting banana, and I don't like banana. I should have known it was called ""Golden Monkey"" for a reason. Not a bad brew, but not something I would have again because of my banana aversion. I would recommend it to anyone who likes banana flavors."

"Not the most complex esters or yeast profile, and a bit too earthy and bitter. Fairly hot, as well."
""
"It poured a faint opaque orange with a huge frothy head. It smelled kind of sweet with a normal tripel yeasty smell. It has a nice sweet taste that fades to a surpringky nice belgium characteristic. I say this because i am not a huge brlgium fan. Very pleasant mouthfeel. A little weak but on point for a Belgium style beer. Overall I would say this is a great beer and since it rocks in at 10% it is a definite regular in my beers I would order at a bar."

"O: Not as good as its European counterparts, but still a solid take from an American brewery. If the yeast was as present in the taste as it was in the aroma, it would be better. The taste just lacks a little from the nose. Not sure the price can get any better though. Nearly 10% and its under $10 for a 6-pack. What a deal"
""
""
""
""
"Had this one on tap at a local tap house. Poured clear golden color with very little if any head. Smell was sweet but not as present as other Belgians. No lacing to speak of but still and attractive pour in a sniffer glass. I immediately enjoyed the taste and would order another."
"Maltiness is a bit lacking. Drinks like an ordinary Belgian strong pale ale."

"So in summary, it's got all of the core elements of a solid, well-made Tripel, but none of the garnishes or fancy flourishes on top of the core elements that some of the fancier Tripels on the market have."
"Overall, this beats Westmalle for me! This is a go-to Tripel for me. I say this because I am not too enthused about Belgian beer. Although I enjoy many beer styles, Belgian ones aren't my typical fancy. However, this is a great American example of how bold and drinkable a Belgian beer can be for those of us who are more about American Craft than Belgian."
""
""
""
""
"Clove overtones with a light mouthfeel. Certainly a good bang for the buck beer and good for folks who like a bright tasting beer. Not a palate wrecker, but inferior to the very similar PranQster from North Coast. I consider this a bargain currently."
""
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass and developed a nice white head which had some good lacing. Lacing and head quickly dissipated. Color was straw and cloudy. Aroma was very strong in the alcohol department with hints of grain and malt. Taste was also strong with the alcohol and hints of citrus and malt, fairly sweet overall. Mouthfeel was full and somewhat creamy."

"O: compared unfavorably in about every respect to the Maredsous 10 Tripel that preceded it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow gold, high carbonation leading to a large bubbled off white head that hangs in valiantly for some time. Aroma is bursting with banana, clove, some bubblegum, lemon, apricot, and yeast. Taste is delicious; more spicy herbal notes mixed with bready malt, yeast, clove, banana, a hint of coriander. Mouthfeel is very lively and lush. Finish is bitter-sweet with a strong peppery kick and some alcohol heat in the throat."

"Overall: it's the regional go-to for tripels. Weyerbacher has a decent winter seasonal, but Golden Monkey is what's up in the Greater Philly. Get to know it, you won't regret it."
""
""
"O- This was one of the beers that led to my fascination with Belgians around the time I turned 21. I remember revisiting it a couple years ago after having had some more refined and revered tripels and saying ""Why did I like this so much? It's nothing compared to other better tripels."" However, now that I sit down and examine the details, I realize that the reason this beer is so good and so popular is because it really hides the alcohol in a way that many other Belgians (American or Belgian-made) don't while still containing all the great characteristics of the style. It's not on my top ten list, but it deserves all the credit it gets IMO."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the easiest beer to drink as the alcohol is noticeable but it is a very enjoyable beer and a great example of the style."

"-Overall 4.0: A good Tripel, which is miles better than your average beer. Still, there are many flavor notes and highlights that are completely missing from this brew. There is entirely too much dryness present in this beer and it is missing so much of the depth of flavor that one would find in a Belgian import. Still, this will do in a pinch! Victory should be proud of being the best thing from Downingtown, PA since...ever."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice dark yellow straw color with a large white head that leaves really nice lacing. Smells very highly of citrus and grain nice balance. Tastes of sweet grain, sight citrus, and slight yeasty tone, very nice. Beer is surprisingly light bodied and perfectly carbonated. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
"O: Its a good triple, but very americanized. This beer has a one dimensional flavor quality that is its only downfall. Aroma could be improved, but is quite exemplary of the style. I would def have again, but im glad i only bought one in a mix 6. A lot of better beers out there."
""
""
""
"O - A surprisingly easy drinking Tripel with pleasant flavor. Although this beer didn't blow me away (for the style), I have to give props to Victory for the low price point and sheer enjoyment it provided."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. I will try other, higher quality tripels to get a better feeling about this style."
""
""
""
"Poured into chalice. Cloudy yellow-orange with a thin white head from a careful pour. Smells of banana bread and belgian yeast. Taste is smooth and sweet at first, only decaying into that belgian yeast taste at the end (which is why I find this one drinkable). Mouthfeel is relatively full, a bit fizzy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty good- medium to fuller bodied, moderate carbonation, a little bready. This is obviously not really a tripel but is somewhere in steepen that and an American strong ale. I've been drinking it on and off for a few years, never loving it, but never hating it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wish I put another bottle down to age. I think this beer has changed over the last year, and is very interesting. I won't, however, say that it's better. I would prefer the freshest version, but I can see it continuously changing over the years. I'd say grab one to drink, grab one to age, and find out for yourself what you think. 4"
"Mouthfeel: Medium light, touch of warming alcohol, slightly subpar carbonation for the style and mike preferences."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a fruity sweet beer, well within style. This would beer the perfect beer to pair with desert."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my very first Tripels - a good introduction to the style. The dry finish reset my palate for each taste... a ""fun"" beer to drink. I would like to try this on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is the star of this potent brew. Slightly too thin for my liking, but an enjoyable sipper. At 9.5% this IS a sipper. Enjoy one and review it for yourself!"
""
"Taste is by far the best quality. I love any beer with banana in it but this is one of my favorites. Beautiful strong banana after taste (In a very good sense) that leaves you craving the next sip. And at %9.5 you better make sure you limit yourself to a few if you're driving. A lot of beers that are this strong and flavorful I can get tired of drinking as much as I like them , but this Victory brew is definitely not one of them. A very solid brew that I'd recommend"

"Nice even pour. Half inch head. Pleasant sticky lace that remains for the duration of the glass. Smells of tropical fruit and clove. Belgian inspired ale, nice mouthful. Definitely a spicy belgian taste. Cant taste where the 9.5% alcohol is, which is a good sign. Overall, its a very good beer, but its one that I would have to be in the mood for. Perhaps, during a sword and sorcery or Robin Hood type movie."

""
""
""
"Overall - Very good beer, good ABV, amazing taste. Will definitely have it again."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but has a mild smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours straw clear with some sediment flecks quickly dissapaiting head, little bit of lacing as it goes down. Taste is banana and kind of a yeast funk and alcohol. Has kind of a homebrew yeast taste. I was hoping for something better from this brewery and style."
""
""
""
"Excellent Victory brew - an easy ""go to"". In the glass it is gold with a copper hue. Good quality head with good lacing. Scent is on the mild side but definitely a Belgian style ale. Mouthfeel is fine champagne like carbonation. Flavor is sweet with a significant banana presence, spices and some other mild fruits."

""
""

""

""

"O: Wow. I am wowed by the flavors that explode forth from this beer. The many flavors make it complex, but not too complex to enjoy. The Belgian yeast funk is more bubble gum and banana (as opposed to yesterdays socks and a sweaty t-shirt). It also has plenty of carbonation, but again, not too much. For Belgian yeast funk lovers this should be a ""must try."""
""
""
"I was so excited to finally see a Victory brew on tap, but looking back I am disappointed it was the Golden Monkey instead of one of their other beers. This one looks quite nice. Foamy head with great lacing and retention. But on the smell & taste front it was pretty one-dimensional. A textbook tripel, if you will. Nothing offensive, but nothing terribly exciting either."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid tripel. Could be a bit cleaner in taste, but still a go to favorite. I have enjoyhed many of these over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The high level of bitterness from the hops and spices make this tough on every sip and I'm a fan of highly hoped, very bitter IPA. Too bitter is phrase I haven't used until I met the Golden Monkey thought my palate adjusted half way through the bottle."
"O: The combination of an enjoyable taste and lack of alcohol burn makes this beer relatively easy to drink, so remember to proceed with caution. Victory is one of my favorite breweries and this is one of my choice beers when available. This is a refreshing tripel at an affordable price."

"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a golden amber, one finger white head and lacing. Light fruit, sweet malt, banana, clove aroma. Light fruit, Belgian spicing and a bit of a hop bite. Nicely balanced. A pleasant low-key tripel. Nothing exciting, but calmly well done. Worth a repeat visit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  So admittedly this isn't all that great of a Tripel, but I have a soft spot for it, as before I really got into craft beer, I happened to get this once by chance, and thought it was amazing.  Plus, it gets bonus points for being insanely reasonably priced, and almost always readily available.  So, I gave it the benefit of the doubt in some of the rating categories.  I don't highly recommended it, but I do think it's a solid beer that I will almost certainly purchase again in the future.  "

"O - This beer has given me a new outlook on the Belgium style and I will definitely try more of these. I would recommend this for sure."

""

"This is one serious beer. There seems to be a bit more going on in here than your typical Belgian Tripel. Lots of sweetness but with some spices to balance it out a good deal. Very good beer."

"I do enjoy Tripels and other Belgium style beers, but this one was hard to swallow. The appearance was fine, but that is as far as it goes. I had a hard time identifying any of the ingredients, but I did taste fruit and something sour. It had a very strong aftertaste. The aftertaste stays with you even after you drink other beers to cover it up. I would not recommend this Tripel. I would rather drink Schlitz or Olde English. Sorry Victory Brewing, Golden Monkey is not my cup of tea...er...beer."

"O: I love tripels, and I totally get why this beer isn't too well-received as a tripel. It is a little lacking in the creamy, lushness that many great tripels have, and it is a little too... I hate to say astringent - but astringent. I would say this is not a great tripel, but a good beer. Not something I'd repurchase, but it was worth the try."

"Although I am a big fan of Belgian-style tripels, this beer always seems like a bit of a mess to me. I get a hint of tripel in the smell, but it is washed out by the hops. Similarly, the taste hints at the tripel spiciness I am looking for, without ever really delivering on the promise. I honestly think labeling the beer a tripel works against it. It is more accurately a big, high-abv American experiment: part tripel, part IPA, part Frankenstein. While I do not think it is a good example of the style, the flavors might work for drinker looking for more hops than is typical in a tripel."

Every time I take a sip, I can't help but think of Duvel. I might get killed for saying that... but I definitely think it has some similarities. It's not a go to for me as I still enjoy La Fin Du Monde and Chimay Cinq Cents. So yeah... a good but not great beer."

"I believe that this is a high powered beer brewed in the Belgian trippel fashion. I received this beer when I told my waitress that I liked American double IPA's . She was way off but this is a great tasting beer light but with a kick. It is perfect for drifting off into oblivion on a hot summer day after a long bike ride or a round of golf. Taste fruity and finishes smooth. Good malt taste at 9+abv. You would expect an alcohol taste yet it is masked quite well. Cheers."
"Golden yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a frothy white foam that reduced to a thin wispy cap. Banana and earthy spicy aroma are dominant with biscuity malt and yeast beneath. Medium bodied with rich, aggressive, tangy carbonation. Spicy flavors up front that last throughout. Sweet fruit and banana flavors in the background at the beginning that slowly grow to the end. Yeast and light biscuit malt backbone throughout. Banana flavors intensify a this warms as well as the higher booze content. Enjoyed this immensely. Glad that Victory is a local brewery."

"The feeling that you get after two or three Golden Monkey's is really something that every beer enthusiast must experience in their career. For whatever reason, there is a warm subtle feeling of joviality than will permeate through you after you sip down a few, which is truly unlike anything else that I have tasted. I always jokingly warn first timers that if you happen to finish off a six pack, you may feel a slight aura of psychedelia starting to set in. A one of a kind brew."
""
""
"From the 12 oz bottle. ""Enjoy by Feb 15 2015"" according to the label. Sounds optimistic, but maybe it would mellow out a little."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"Taste is rich and well-balanced, with plenty of spice alongside the sweetness. Somehow, the full flavor absolutely masks the tipsy-high 9.5% ABV. This is an exceptional tripel, and perhaps one of the best I've had."
""
""
""
"Certainly a well crafted brew (as is true of most victory beers ive had), and tasty. the pepper spiciness doesnt distract or overwhelm but compliments the subtle lacing well. Certainly a drinkable beer and a good tripple. If you like the style check it out but if youre not big on belgians this probably wont be what youre looking force"
""
""
""
"O - Overall a fine tripel, made better with age. Not mind-blowing, and the faults are very apparent. That said, I enjoyed drinking this a great deal and would love to keep some in my cellar to age and mellow."
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice tripel, the lemon in the nose wasn't really present in the taste. A little more lemon would have made the beer better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Victory Golden Monkey pours a golden yellow color with a white head that dissipates quickly to a thin cover from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit floral and definitely a bit sweet. The flavor has a bit of clove and is a bit sweet/ perhaps a bit fruity and I can definitely taste the alcohol. Caramel malt becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The body seems a bit thin. I'm not terribly impressed, not bad, but nothing special either."
""
""

"O- This beer isn't my favorite beer in the world, however it is a decent beer that is remarkably drinkable at 9.5%. I've had this beer quite a few times because it comes in the Victory mixed 12, which I consider one of the best value mixed 12s on the market, partly because they include this beer in it. I could use a little bit less carbonation and a little bit more flavor."
""

"This is my first tripel, so I'm not sure how this fits the type. A peppery ale that feels lighter than it's content and ABV suggest. Give it a try."

""
""
""
"Pours an opaque gold from a bottle into my trappist glass. Smell is sweet dark fruit and banana nut bread. Taste is mild up front with less sweetness than the smell would indicate. Surprisingly dry across the middle and a bold boozy finish. Aftertaste is disarmingly short. Warm boozy feeling in the belly. Very drinkable for a beer that presents itself as heavier than it really is. Good. I'll buy it again. Less than 2 bucks for a 12 oz. single. Bargain for a Tripel."

"Pretty good; a solid take on a Belgian tripel. The yeast and spice notes are spot on. The only downside is the unbalanced flavour - the alcohol is excessive and isn't integrated to the degree that it should be. However, it's still an impressive effort. Worth trying."

However, i have to admit that the first time i tried a bottle out of the six pack it was all yeasty funk to me and i had to throw it out.

Who knows, maybe a few more months will make it a better tasting beer."

"O - It is not my favorite tripel, but it may be the most drinkable. This is often the choice of my non-craft drinking friends, who ooh and ahh about the alcohol content. I would like more in terms of dynamic flavors and perhaps a bit more thickness, but overall not bad. I think Victory does high ABV beers very well. This wouldn't be my top choice in the Victory big beers category, but it may be if I had to drink several."

"poured into a tulipp glass, very light foam, almost no lacing, smell is spicy, yeast with some hints of corriander and subtle hoppyness, taste is a.b.v strong, and it kinda takes away from the whole ""triple"" effect. it pured into a nice golden un-filtered color. im forced to enjoy triples from belgium only. this didnt really didnt make as a triple in my book. more of a spiced double lager. sorry folks...i didnt want to upset anyone.but i will not recomend this to anyone."

"O-Not a favorite of mine, but I would try it again. I would suggest it to anyone who likes/loves Belgian style beers though. The higher alcohol puts you in the mood to drink more though."

"I thought this would disappoint after having so many delicious Belgians since I've last revisited. But, I was wrong. Kudos!"

"Oh man I love me some triple brews, but this one is just a litte nutz! Way too wild to be considered a true triple! It says it is brewed with spices but all I can taste is the alchol. this brew is better on tap and in the growler--not great in the bottle."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet, best by date of Oct 2014. This pours a light golden color with a smaller white head. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, bananna, clove, spices, pepper and sweet malts. The feel is medium and high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, a little pepper and spices, some alcohol burn and a nice dry after flavor, not the best triple but great for the price."

"golden monkey was one of those beers i cut my teeth on back when i was first getting into craft but now consider to be not as great as i once did. it's decent enough brew, just not an upper eschelon tripel."
"ABV is dangerously deceptive. Will definitely seek out more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good brew and one worth a try for anyone who has not had it. Not the best example of a triple but overall enjoyable."
""
""

""
""
"A very light and easy drinking tripel, which is dangerous at 9.5%."
""
""
""
""
"Nicely balanced medium bodied beer, very drinkable, but there are better contenders in this category. But I liked it very much!"
""
"All Victory brews are a must try. Golden Monkey is a must keep on hand."
""
""
""
"Overall - I do like this beer, but it is lacking the two essentials for a great beer, appearance and smell. If they could even get the smell to match the taste it would be a winner"
""
""
"Overall: The taste is not as complex and is somewhat muted compared to the upper echelon Tripels. But on the other hand I've always found this one a refreshing beer in the summer that's priced very well."

"Poured into Dogfish head snifter. Golden color with one fingered head and lots of lacing. Smells of strong fruit. Very nice smell. Sweet and fruity taste with a little more hops than others I have tried in this style. Fair carbonation. Seems a little flat after a few minutes in my glass. Not my favorite example of this style, but not bad at all."
""
"Overall, this is a fine ale. I haven't had this one in years, and I'm really glad I picked up another six pack."

"Appears golden with a thin white head quickly dissipating. Smell is of peaches, vanilla and cinnamon. Taste begins very sweet and complicated then it has bitterness, almost pepperiness in the finish. It has a wheat taste to it. It has a crisp mouthfeel with just the right amount of bubbles. The alcohol burn you'd expect at a 9.5 isn't there. It wouldn't be my first choice of a six pack to pick up but it isn't bad either."

"I liked this one, but it almost seems like it's boozed up for no particular reason. The taste was a bit blander than i expected, and the high abv alone won't get me to come back for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" style high octane I go for this. Straw color a bit cloudy, first sniff smells a bit like a circus. I like the taste and mouth feel but love the kick it has. At this time I am mixing it fifty fifty with Keystone light. Watching my weight and wallet. Thank you Victory..Cheers!"
""
""
"nice american spin on a classic belgian tripel. much more spice, cloveyness and yeast characters than its belgian counterpart, but the same smooth feel and bigtime abv. this one pours a haze lemonade color with a decent white head. smells like a belgian, but with some fruit and spice notes too, cant smell the booze, but you can taste it a bit. this one took some time to grow on me but has become one of my favorite victory beers. only the high abv prevents it from being a great session, because the mouthfeel is just right for the style. really nice big beer from victory"
""
""
"Pours a nice hazy straw color. Dense and light colored head with great retention. Smell gives a hint to the spices used. The taste is citrusy with nice spice notes to help balance it out. for a beer thats 9.5 percent the beer doesn't let the alcohol dominate the flavor. It's pretty good considering the style but not something i'd buy on my own again"
""
""
""

"DRINKABILITY: Repeatable, but not more than two because of the ABV and the fact that the alcohol is so well masked -- kind of sneaks up on you. Good value and easy to drink (maybe TOO easy). The flavors in this one are surprisingly muted, which makes it even more surprising that the alcohol doesn't stand out more. My impression regarding flavor is that there seemed to be inexplicable gaps in it -- like something else was supposed to be there but wasn't. This wasn't bad but I would like more out of a beer that has this kind of an ABV. I probably won't buy another."
""
""
""
""
"overall, it's a decent beer. just isn't what's advertised.. i've been feeling that way about a couple beers lately, you expect a style and you get something different... it's not bad, but i can't give this one good ratings because it's not a real tripel"
""
"This is a big tripel. It's occasionally boozy, but the flavor profile and mouthfeel make up for it."
""
""
"O - A decent beer, but not one of my favorites. The odd aromas and the sourness in the flavor throw it off for me. Remove those two problems and it would greatly improve this beer."

"The Rest: Wow. I don't know if this is a bad bottle, but there is some definite funk going on here. The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like it was fermented in a plastic bucket. Not Victory's best showing."

"Overall, a mediocre tripel. Could be smoother, more well-rounded. Not the best tripel I've had, but not the worst. Thanks for a good beer after a long, hard day at work, Victory!"
"Victory- Really?"
"Worth checking out at any rate, but not my favorite offering from Victory by a long shot."
"I know this is a Tripel but there was just something missing here. If the alcohol was hidden more and there were some more spice and fruit flavors, this would be a great beer. Instead, it's a decent representation of the style, but not enough to match up with its European counterparts."
"I think this would be better on-tap or bottle conditioned."
"Well worth a try and a beer I would enjoy having again. Very well done."
"O- Quite a powerful brew at 9.5% ABV. Less of a Tripel and more of an IPA in my lowly opinion. Unremarkable for its price but thoroughly decent overall. I don't think I will reach for this one again."
"O/D - Meh. Needs more depth and breadth of flavour, yet the citrus made up for it a bit. Not a bad Tripel, but with a ton of Fin du Monde available, I wouldn't go seeking this out again."
"Victory Golden Monkey Triple: The Belgian Triple style is so different, it’s almost not beer, but makes for a great dessert! So how does Victory Brewing offering fare? It has a rich golden color in the glass, is appropriately translucent, and has a thin off-white head. The aroma is right in there for a triple: yeasty, fruity and sweet. The flavor starts out as a wonderful triple: complex, sweet and yeasty bready. But the finish, which should be the climax of a good triple falls a bit short, even some bitter comes through. Worth a try, but there are better triples out there."
"Well take a style I'm not going to gravitate towards in the first place and make it poorly. Yep, not a fan."
"Overall: It's not a bad beer but for me it lacks flavor. If the beer had some spice notes or something it would make this one a better beer. But it's definitely worth a try"
"I've had a sample of this on tap once and think it was much better than this bottle. I'll have to ty it again when I'm out one night to double check."
"O: Good beer for autumn. It is not as complex as a Belgian-style tripel can be, and it makes for a good beer in an unsophisticated setting. Perhaps a picnic and an autumn sunset."
"Overall, too sweet and such for the style to be true, but not nasty."
"It's not a bad beer, but it's not up to Belgian standards. Maybe with some aging the ingredients would meld together a bit more."
"O: This was really just very mellow, with flavors that were muted for reasons I can't quite understand. Just felt like a swiss cheese of a beer, where holes existed where flavor needed to. Not bad tasting, just not very much to be tasted. If I am going to drink a beer at this ABV, then I'd like to get more out of it. To it's credit, the alcohol is well hidden, but it's also too taxing to be enjoyable."
"o - Not dissapointed, but not a favorite. I would go for this again, but I think now knowing exactly what this beer is like, I feel that I would have to be in a certain mood for it. What mood is that? I'm not too sure yet."
"O - Just an average tripel with high ABV which unfortunately was not masked at all."
"Overall: This is a decent Tripel. Yes, its a bit over-spiced and under-balanced, but it still hits most of the right notes and delivers a well crafted beer. Straight 4s; this one is solid."
"O: Eh, can't say I'm a fan. It has its perks, but it's too unbalanced. While I'm glad I tried it, and the price is right for a Tripel ($2.70 for a 12 oz. bottle), it's not something I'd search out in the future."
"Best beer I've ever had! Great taste, but if you have 2 or more, do not drive! Reasonably priced, I have been drinking it for 9 years now, it is one of the pleasures of life. For the past week it has helped me get over the Philies devastating loss to the Cardinals in the playoffs. It has an abv of 9.5%, the monkey will catch up to you."
"O: a pretty good beer, but I haven't had many belgians so I don't have much of a comparison point."
"O: Not my favorite offering from Victory. A bit boozy tasting for the style I thought but not a bad beer by any means."
"Appearance is a hazy gold color with a huge white head that stands above the glass rim. Nice lacing left behind too. Strong scents of fruit cocktail are a pleasure for the nostrils. Citrus (lemon, grapefruit, and pear) along with clove are dominant in the taste. Reminds me a bit of a hefeweizen, but more boozy. A malt backbone is subtle but noticeable. Nothing special going on with the mouthfeel. Another solid offering from a great brewery."
"O: Solid Belgian Tripel. Definitely a sipper at 9.5% ABV."
" Overall I really enjoy triples so I enjoyed this. Maybe a little heavy on the spice but I didn't think it was that bad."
"Quite an awesome beer. I really enjoy this one."
"From the bottle, golden and semi-hazy body with a fluffy white head. The head settles out to a nice cap with some lacing. The aromas mimic some qualities of traditional Belgian made Tripels but this is certainly anything but textbook to the style. Spicy yeast, candi sugar, sweet light malts and touches of alcohol fill the nose. The taste is similar but the booziness seems to be more pronounced. More spice, yeast, banana and hints of green apple. It feels overly bubbly, maybe a bit less would give it a creamier mouth. Nonetheless, a solid favorite especially for an American brewed Tripel."
"O - Not good enough to call an authentic tasting Belgian Tripel. Lacks the complexity of a true tripel."
"A decent tripel. Lots of flavor and a particularly good aroma, hurt only, though significantly, by its thin mouthfeel."
"Pours a hazy pale golden hue which leaves a two finger sudsy head with sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is strong bananna,belgian yeast,doughy bread and spices,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of banana,herbal flowery hops,belgian yeast and finished with a sweet candy finish and overall alright without being great cheers."
"A++ !!!"
"Why would I want to get there with mixed drinks when I can get there with Tripels. This is easy to drink and damn does the taste hit throughout the drink. If you want to get drunk this is the drink to get there. If you don't want to get drunk then I suggest you stay clear of this drink because if you buy a pack of this it will get you there and beyond."
"Bottle conditioning resulted in billowing white head first pour, a bit more controlled on second glass over medium gold body, the etched bottom of chalice resulted in constant stream of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Not much going on in the nose, might have been poured a bit too cold, picked up good dose of coriander once warmed, floral hops. Taste started off pretty innocuous, coriander forward, faint bit of orange peel after warming but not very much Mouthfeel just on the light side of medium, good effervescence. The relative lack of fruitiness inhiibited drinkability despite relative cheap price point. I'll pass next time."
"Pours out a light golden hue with a thick creamy white head that disappears quickly leaving a thin head that has really excellent retention and lacing. The carbonation is also good on this one. The aroma is candy, hops, and some fruits. The taste starts out with some hops followed by some sweet malts and some fruits throughout (primarily apples and bananas). The taste finishes off with a mix of fruit and hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. A very easy drinking beer that hides the 9.5% abv very very well. A great beer that I'll be drinking again. Another Victory for Victory Brewing Company."
"O - Overall, a strong, pretty good tripel. Can't really go wrong for the money here."
"Overall, the spice aftertaste overwhelmed the beer and though it was a creative approach, left it only decent."
"O: I don't care for this one. It's not that bad, but it's not that good either. I'm trying to think of good things to say about this beer, but nothing really comes to mind."
"Serving type: growler"
"Clear golden in appearance, no head at all in my ccb snifter. Aroma is bold of fruits and spices common to the style. Taste follows the nose, pretty easy to drink, hides the alcohol well where at 9.5% this could be dangerous. As with this style the larger bottle conditioned corked and caged bottle is far superior to the 12oz bottles"
"Overall - I don't really like this beer because of all the spices. I can't handle it with my acid reflux lol.. But if you like spicy, bitter beer then this is for you"
"Overall I was very disappointed,, I love all of the Victory beers I have tried so far, and this was the worse by far. Maybe it was an old bottle I got, or hope that is the case. Surprised because of the all the other good reviews."
"Pours clear golden yellow with a moderate head that typically displays some decent lacing. Vaguely yeasty aroma, banana and cloves, but on the light side. Tastes a bit chemical-y, biscuity, with banana and spice notes, alcohol is not hidden. Medium-bodied, and not too drinkable in my book, though it seems the ladies tend to like it. ?"
"D - not my favorite domestic tripel; too much bitter taste and too many herbs and spice"
"I told you I was going to write in this new style… but I must admit, I had to go back and see the order. I wasn’t sure where we started. Hopefully before long it’s second nature. I wouldn’t order this beer again, but hey… there are 1001 bottles in this project. I can’t like them all!"
"This beer pours a golden straw color with a little bit of haze. The smell is lightly society and anod a little sweeter than most triples. The flavor is pretty well balanced between malt and spiceyness. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than the style. Over all a decent beer"
"O: No!!! I spilled the majority of it while trying to catch a football. I as really liking it and now it is gone. Good crisp beer to drink when it is hot out. I will have to pick up a sixer of this next time."
"Served on tap at the Millwood Tavern in Gloucester. Arrived in a Duvel Green tulip glass. Dull golden yellow color. A thin white head, but nothing spectacular. Smell was sugary and malty. I enjoyed the flavor a lot though. There was plenty of that Belgian candy sugar taste that I love. Plus, hints of citrus and licorice. Mouthfeel was crisp for a tripel, not bready like other examples. The abv was hidden on the palate, but it sure caught up quickly. Very noticeable after half a glass. For an American version, this tripel is one of the better examples out there for me."
"Good beer that is 9.5%, could barely taste the alcohol. Very easy drinking that goes done very smoothly."
"A pretty basic tripel that’s not very easy to drink but okay to sip. Mostly yeast and herbal flavors that mellow a bit to an almost balanced sweetness."
"O: Probably the worst tripel I've ever had. Oh well, it's only a bomber."
"O: Very nice, enjoyable beer. I would definitely have another."
"Medium body with light to medium carbonation. Not a favorite of the style overall, but for an American made Tripel, this is pretty good."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp, sharp carbonation bite on the tongue. Leaves a sticky film in your mouth with each sip. Overall, not really impressed. I was hoping for more, but other tripels offer much more and are about as affordable. A decent brew to put down, but not going back for more."
"Overall--This beer is certainly not for everyone. Alcohol, yeast and spice come at you like the Three Storms, and I can easily see how this can be a big turn-off. However, I find it an exquisite American take on the Belgian Tripel, as it possesses wonderful spice with earthy yeast in the nose without being overpoweringly sugary/ syrupy afterwards. Yeah, the alcohol is very evident, but the combo is like blasting a power chord through a Marshall stack--it's a good thing. This beer is defiantly drinkable, too, which is dangerous. Very refreshing and satisfying."
"O - This is a dangerous beer! The alcohol is masked very well. This beer can be drank like any of your pale ales."
"Overall - I think this is an incredibly well crafted beer and I think this is my first Tripel (have to check my profile though). Victory does it again! They are #1 brewer and this is another superb beer in their quiver."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow, almost a burnt orange in the right light with a HUGE head that levels off to a nice bubbly head that stays with the glass. High lemon citrus on the nose nice spice on the fall back, with fresh scents of apples, pears, and grapes. Spicy lemon taste with hints of fruit also coming out, lemons, oranges, grapefruits, some alcohol, lots of bittering hops to close on the finish. The feel is light, crisp, smooth, warm on the tongue and bitter. Overall this beer is ok, i cant slam it and i cant praise it, it very much has (to me anyhow) more of a BPA sort of feel then it does a Tripel."
"Not a session beer. One and my mouth is full of complex favors."
"O - I am a fan of Belgians, including Tripels, and this one is fairly good for what it is--but ONLY for what it is; an affordable domestic attempt at a complex and difficult style. However, it is overly sweet and a little too upfront/top-heavy in flavor. That said, the alcohol warmth is nice. 9.5% abv!"
"Overall a good beer. Definitely not a session beer though."
"The liquid is golden with a thick frothy white head that didnt last long. The smell consists of banana, sour orange and lemon with some clove spice. The taste has lots of banana, alcohol, wheat, clove and a peppery lemony finish. The beer is full bodied with soft carbonation and a slight bite on the tongue. This is a solid tripel, nothing amazing, didn't really like it the first time around so had to try it again, I did find it enjoyable."
"O: An excellent beer to enjoy after a good meal. Given the 9.5 ABV, it is a very well balanced beer, i would definitely seek it out again and keep it for special occasions."
"Overall, pretty good. Exceeded my expectations."
"D: Quite drinkable, but dangerous. Emphasis is on robustness rather than complexity, depth or expressiveness. A bit too much of the spicey alcohol bite & heft. It makes a decent sipper though, just nothing to rave about."
"12oz bottle. Pours a bright yellow color, crystal clear, with a thin white head. Aroma is banana, clove, yeast. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Flavor is A little sweet, a little bitter, with flavors of clove, yeast, and a little booze. Finish is dry and a little bitter. Very nice"
"This particular blend of flavors just isnt my cup of tea, but it still better than some other brews I've had. Give it a shot, it may be for you."
"Big frothy head on this one. It looks like what it says: Golden. Yeast and alcohol dominate the nose, maybe just a tad bit of citrus in there as well, orange maybe? Tastes like a yeast bomb. Lots of yeast, lots of alcohol, not much spice to it. Tastes a bit wheaty as well (making up words helps). Light, semi creamy mouthfeel that is nice for the summer. Despite the alcohol on the abv, on the nose, and on the pallet, this drinks very easy. If you're looking for an inexpensive summer beer, you could do worse."
"A delicious and surprisingly light beer for the alcohol content. A bit sweet to the taste but doesn't sit hard. Only negative about the beer is the danger of drinking too much too fast, which is hardly a complaint. Overall one of the best bang for your buck beers on the market."
"It does fill the mouth though, and it's easy on the eyes, but I am not impressed. Golden Monkey, I'm talking to you."
"O: Victory's Golden Monkey is a damn fine example of an American Tripel. It's easy enough to drink, yet can be sipped and enjoyed over a couple of hours. Not the best in style, but certainly in the upper middle class."
"O/D-Nearly zero Tripel experience. This beer to me is just, 'eh, not bad'. Glad I only bought a single of this. Not my favorite style, and probably not the best representation of such style. Expensive too. Not going to be grabbing this again."
"Overall I would say this is a pretty average Tripel. At first this beer seemed like a pretty spot on attempt at a Tripel but it fell apart when it came to the flavor, it was just a little watery and not flavorful enough. The only flavor that turned out to be bold was the spices and that made for a pretty unbalanced flavor that had too many spices. The price point was good but the more expensive Tripels are much better so I guess you get what you pay for, but it did go down pretty smooth and easy, it just didn't impress me. I don't think I would buy this again, for the same price I can get Final Absolution from Dragonmead and I think that is much better. If you really like Tripels give this one a try but I don't think it will blow anybody's mind. Most of the Victory beers I have tried have been pretty good but it seems like the last two I have had have been lack luster but there is still a couple more of their brews I want to try. There was nothing memorable about this Tripel."
"Overall I still feel that tripels are not my cup of tea"
"Golden Monkey is a true favorite of mine. It has a lot of the characteristics of a traditional Tripel but then completely changes course and takes on an entirely different profile than you're expecting. I applaud Victory for sticking with their guns, as this is truly a standout beer in the category."
"I'll be coming back to it."
"O: A valiant effort by Victory. This is a nice floral semi-dry American Tripel that succeeds!"
"O-The best format to enjoy this beer is definately on tap, it's an amazing heady brew and a great heavy summer drink."
"O - As far as the style goes, not sure how loyal Victory was. I did enjoy it for the taste in itself; bold, ever-offering with continuous body. Certainly something I would try again, and if by some freak chance I find this on tap, will definitely go for it."
"Overall: Nice American example of the Belgian style. All in all an enjoyable beer at a very reasonable price point."
"Overall, a very good beer, am loving this! Not too many Tripels that i jump at other than Westmalle, but this is impressive!"
"O: A pretty good brew, drinkable and has a hefty kick to it with such a high ABV. Not very familiar with the style but I'd be willing to try a few others in this vein."
"Poured from a bottle in to a nonic pint glass. Cloudy amber color and much liveliness to the head and foam. Smell was of herbal yeasty goodness. Taste was dry, sharp, very flavorful and refreshing. Loved it; similar to the Westmalle Tripel spicy type of taste. Mouthfeel was very good, nice and carbonated. Will definitely be buying this one more often."
"Overall: A good Belgian tripel that reminds me of a saison. I like the complexity and this makes an excellent summer sipper. I have had better in the style, but this one is certainly good."
"O- An ordinary, nothing special tripel."
"Very enjoyable tripel...would definitely drink again."
"Not my favorite from Victory... A decent beer to drink but there are better tripels out there..."
"While I always appreciate the Victory Brewing Company offerings, this is another good one. ""Golden Monkey"" pours a yellowish golden color, with ample, one finger white head that laces nicely but dissipated rather quickly for the style. Smell is initially peppery, with biscuits, and some floral qualities following. ""Golden Monkey"" tastes quite biscuity initially, with a lemony, citrus flavor following. Still quite a bit of pepper in the taste. The beer feels a bit low in carbonation for the style, yet the oiliness finishes it out quit well. Overall ""Golden Monkey"" is a good offering as a Belgian Tripel from Victory Brewing."
"Overall a solid beer."
"Sampled on June 2, 2011. The pour is straw yellow with a frothy, puffy head and little chunks of sediment floating around. The head settles. There are gentle carbonation bubbles lifting elegantly up the center of the glass. The aroma has plenty of pears and bananas and a light spice note with some malts. But I also get something like wheat. The body is medium to full. The taste is more on the peppery side with a dry hopped ending. I enjoyed it."
"O-Love this style of beer but do not like this rendition. Just doesn't compare to other tripel's. Not bad just not good for this style."
"Bottle. Pours golden with a white, long lasting, frothy head. Nose is of yeast, biscuit malt and some citrus fruit. Medium, crisp body. Taste is brown sugar, yeast, peppery, spicy hops and biscuit malt. Long, spicy, peppery finish. Very peppery take on the style."
"The yeast taste was the big hitter for me. Last time I had this beer at the Victory Brew Co. I dont remember it tasting like it does. Very nice beer."
"Slightly thin in the body department. Good beer but not something I am going to search out."
"Golden monkey pours a hazy yellow with an inch of white head. The nose is clove, Belgian spice, and banana. The taste follows closely but isn't impressing me too much thus far. Mouthfeel is decent due to a smooth feel that is medium bodied. Nuances are there but not bold enough for me."
"12oz bottle to tulip. Clear orange body w tons of bubbles capped by one finger white head. Sticky and inviting. Nose is of Belgian yeast, sweet stone fruit, and a touch of pepper corn. Flavor is similar. Clean finish, not cloying. High alcohol is well masked."
"O - An interesting brew to say the least. I probably will not seek this beer again, nor could I drink more than one at a sitting. The flavor profile between the overly intense hops and the alcohol level was just too much. If those were toned down a bit, this would be a quality beer."
"O: Not a beer I'll be going back too. I've loved some other Victory Belgian style beers before, and this one didn't match my expectations."
"M- Medium bodied with a lingering sweet flavor"
"O. Overall an interesting brew that doesn't seems as well balanced between hops and malt as other tripels. The post-hop flavor is enjoyable and the spice finish is appreciated though, and I did warm up to the alcohol finish after it warmed a bit."
"Overall: A pretty decent Tripel but not as good as some of the oth"
"This is my second go at Golden Monkey, and the first time I really wasn't a fan; now, I think I can see why, but I also find it far more favorable. This beer is big and complex, but lacks the panache, so to speak, of my favorite tripels."
"Overall: My first foray into the Tripel category. I look forward to trying some Belgian examples of the style."
"Cheers brendaniel!"
"Overall: Not my favorite beer. I haven’t had much experience with tripels but the one’s that I have had I preferred to Victory’s offering. It’s too bad because I’m a big fan of their stuff."
"Taste is more hoppy than bready or spicy. Good. Hops are piny and floral. Spice comes in behind then a dry finish. Slightly bready but a little thin. The pine hops just don't blend well with the yeast and spice, but the beer is still good and enjoyable. Feels like it's on the brink of becoming very good, but currently seems incomplete."
"Wow, this is amazing; plum/raisin characteristics come out, and an amazing complexity ensues. The result is a beer unlike any I've had before. The lighter Belgian flavors run nicely against the bass notes that emerge from aging. Unusual, amazing."
"O = I liked this. Very drinkable. Good approach to an American brewed Belgian. Would go nicely with sushi and sashimi."
"O: I used to like this one when I was first getting into craft beer, but now that ship has sailed."
"12oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow body with a good inch of off-white head. Smells fruity and yeasty with some spice notes. Tastes fruity, zesty, slightly pithy, with spicy notes, slight bit of pepper, and a hint of alcohol warming. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit of a sipper though one sip definitely invites another. A pretty decent Tripel. Better than I thought it would be."
"Overall - It's good and it's easy to drink. It's nothing amazing, but there isn't anything glaringly wrong with it. I would be happy drinking this regularly."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't a great version of the style in my opinion either. The yeast spice was a little harsh and overpowering for me and i got a little too much herbal bitterness in the finish as well. Decent beer but not nearly as good as some of the best in the style."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer washes over your tongue nicely and leaves very little stickiness. Not quite a thirst-quencher but more than a sipper, you wouldn't chug this beer, but a little sip isn't enough either."
"O: Nice refreshing beer, very drinkable despite the ABV. A good example of the style."
"D- Overall this beer is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Im reviewing it as i had it during my 1st impression. Ive since had it in a bottle and feel it to be alittle unbalanced but on draft is it a pleasant beer to drink and with a 9.8% it will sneak up on you fast"
"O- Overall, Golden Monkey is a good beer that is worth a try if you like the style."
"The overall smell of this beer was an overpowering amount of banana smell. After a couple of swishes around the glass and a sniff you could smell way too much sweet banana smell with a hint beligian hops. The appearance was a light opaque yellow with little bits of yeast granules leftover. The taste, for me, was too sweet. There were subtle hints of a typical belgian beer but with overpowering amounts of sweetness. As a blonde tripel I understand that it's supposed to be sweet, but I don't like when the sweetness overtakes the entire beer."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - Overall this beer was good to me, it's not the best Tripel Ive had but it's good. It seemed to be a bit more sweet than anything else, I would have liked a bit more banana nut bread character in the taste, that I experienced in the aroma. I think I would have it again but probably pay a bit more for another Tripel. Worth a try for Tripel fans though. Cheers!"
"I'm not much a fan for Belgian yeast and i'm definitely not a fan of Belgian yeast in beers that are mediocre. Victory missed the mark on this one, yet blowing me away with their pilsner. Oh well."
"M: Medium to thin bodied and a little on the overcarbed side."
"I had a bottle of this at a family picnic. I was really excited to try it because usually the beer selections aren't the best at these things. Someone had gotten a mix and match case of Victory brews. I grabbed a Golden Monkey and poured it out. The color was a bright yellow with a head that comes and goes. The aromas were interesting. Kinda sweet, kinda funky and just overall different than most Tripels I've smelled. This beer tastes like it smells, I'm not sure how much I really enjoyed it. I found it to be kind of strange tasting. I'd try this one again if it came my way but I wouldn't pay for it."
"O- A decent triple but not one of the better ones out there. A bit disappointing for me considering the level this brewery usually performs at."
"It is a good beer. Not something I would want to drink a lot of. Very drinkable considering how high the alcohol content is. Worth mentioning again. This beer is sneaky strong!"
"O: A solid beer that I enjoyed, but certainly not your typical triple. A hoppy and somewhat boozy take on what I consider a delicate style."
"O: It's not as complex as the better Belgian tripels, but as an American contender, it would do well against some of the lesser Belgians in this category, which is pretty high praise in my book. And it's a good deal cheaper, which makes it a great value for those looking to get into the style from lower alcohol or less yeasty beers."
"HV"
"Almost looks like a light beer with yeast sediment suspended in the glass. I can smell that typical Belgian yeast smell but with citrus from the hops and some unknown spices and some clove in the smell as well. The taste is just like this with a spicy peppery clove/banana/corriander mixing in with the Belgian yeast which also gives off those same flavors so you get double that flavor. There is some sweetness from the malt and it took me off guard with its creamy mouthfeel. The surprising body of this beer is one of my favorite things about it. You get the hops in the back with the citrus and some bitterness as well. I like that I can actually taste the hops in this unlike some other Belgian beers. I'm not that much a fan of Belgian beers but the creamy body and the hops make for the tastiest one I've had to date."
"Overall - A nice beer with adequete appeal"
"Overall, maybe a good introduction to Tripels, but I wouldn't make a judgement on the style with this one beer, which is sad, because Victory makes some outstanding beers."
"O - not that impressed with this one. its not bad but definitely is not a tripel i would revisit again."
"Pours a lovely golden color with a respectable white foamy head. The yeast gives the nose a blend of ripe bananas and spicy clove. The palate follows the nose and is bright and tasty. It does come in a bit hot, however. This would probably benefit from some extended cellaring. No complaints with the mouthfeel. Plenty of carbonation and has good body. A nice triple for the price."
"M- Nice full mouthfeel, great carbonation. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Very Drinkable, but beware these are very Strong 9.5 ABV and a couple of these will go straight to your head."
"D- Very enjoyable at first, however the sweetness is overpowering by the end of the beer. A good beer, but not one I would want more than one of in an evening."
"Pours a cloudy apricot gold with a tight but short-lived head. Smells of banana, honey, ginger. Very yeasty quality to the scent. Tastes a bit off. Not the fermentation, just the whole package is just off. Has a bi of a musty aftertaste, and musty isn't good. eh, not my favorite Tripel."
"This is a medium bodied brew with an effervescent level of carbonation that eventually calms down to an acceptable moderate level. A fair representation of the style with a bold alcohol presence. Overall there was an enjoyable depth to this brew to enjoy but the sulfur aspect I could do without. Overall not bad, I would drink this again. The cryptic dating that victory offers perplexes me, sure the label says best by Dec. 1 2013 but that doesnt tell me anything regarding how old/young this offering is. I would love to have it again with a side by side comparison of a young brew verse one with 3 years or so on it. Give it a try, overall it's not bad. My only gripe is that this brew seems to heavily rely on the spiced aspect/additions of the brew instead of the natural flavors and aromas that the yeast alone can provide."
"O/A- Not impressed, most beers of this style hide their ABV alot better and have a more complex taste. I probably won't be getting this again."
"D- Wouldn't mind having a few more of these, but I decided to move on to something else, so it's decent but not great. The high alcohol didn't show through at all allowing it to be an easy drink."
"Ahhh the Golden Monkey. A nice Tripel that, thanks to Victory's distribution, is around even in NH. Straw to golden in color with a small head that stays around the edge of the glass. The aroma is pears, alcohol, some honey sweetness and clove. Very nice Belgian clove phenolic, alcohol, sweetness, and subtle tropical fruit in the flavor. Nicely carbonated. Golden Monkey is one of my favorite ""go to"" American-made Belgian style ales. Well done Victory."
"D - May not be the picture perfect example of a Belgium triple but it drinks rather nice with a low touch of overall yeast. I just wish the alcohol was more masked but its a good beer."
"Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer for its percent. I personally do not recommend having more than one because too many is a bad hangover waiting to happen, trust me. It is a nice beer for the inexperienced drinker but one I do not plan to touch again."
"Drinkability- I thought it was ok but probably won't have it again. But I would have it for free lol"
"For a tripel, I would totally pass on this and have something else instead. Way too wet and carbonated for my tastes and for this style for me."
"Drinkability: A sessionable 9.5% abv spiced Belgian. Enough said. Drink responsibly *wink wink*."
"This is the first Tripel I've ever had. It reminds me a lot in appearance of a pilsner. It also has hints of noble hops. This beer was very complex and delicious."
"Overall, this should be called the golden gorilla. the 9.5 abv is quite noticeable and not hidden well at all. However, with this style I can appreciate the extra kick. Worthy attempt and worth a shot."
"Fairly effervescent with a dry finish. Medium bodied. Decent, even good though not great."
"D- I certainly have gotten this multiple times, so it's got to be decent."
"D) The spice, the texture and lack of effervesence (that one expects from true Belgians), put me off. One was enough for me"
"The beer is a soft, silky, creamy beer of medium body. A little on the light side for its style. A slight watery note that makes the entire beer more drinkable than most tripels. It is however a sipper, not just because of bold flavor but its dangerous being so easy to drink and such high ABV."
" Drinkability, to me, is low. Something about this is a bit rough. But there would be others who dig this."
"I'd still go for another one of these... I wish Victory was available in Louisiana, but for now I'll jus thave to pick them up when I can."
"Drinkability - I may buy this beer again, just to enjoy one or two through the week. Not my type of beer, but very good. I recommend trying it. I enjoyed the beer very much so."
"The lingering heat and somewhat overall unbalanced features doesn't lend much in the way of drink ability."
"Overall: Not quite La Fin Du Monde good."
"It could be that I got a bad bottle, but I did not like this beer. It looked and smelled great, and the taste had potential, but that sharp sour/bitterness that greats you when it enters and says good-bye before it leaves ruins the beer. I would like to try another bottle of this just to find out if the problem was this particular bottle or if it's the beer in general."
"d- real drinkable...actually dangerous. Def doesn't drink like an almost 10% beer. I would have 3 or 4 and realize that walking is difficult."
"I'm not as crazy about the Belgian beers, but this one is both complex and balanced. A great all around Belgian brew that stays true to its roots."
"Overall a nice spiced tripel, a little off the beaten path but not too much. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: This one I'm not really impressed with. It's a very one-dimensional tripel and, with all the other choices out there, I really can't see myself getting this again. It's not bad, it just doesn't compare well to others of the style. A miss but only slightly..."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, this beer is a bright, clear straw-gold color with a frothy, foamy white head about a quarter of an inch thick. Much lighter and brighter than most Tripels. The smells are a bit muddled, but definitely some coriander and light sweetness. The beer is very sweet in mouth, and the spices help to balance that flavor. The coriander is still present, but subdued under the sweet flavors of banana bread. Very smooth and creamy in mouth, yet the aftertaste is extremely abrupt. Only the slightest hint of coriander lingers in the aftertaste, and not for long at all. Very palatable, but a little on the short side. The flavors were decent enough that a little longer linger wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing."
"D: Crazy drinkable, especially considering the ABV. Equally rewarding in draughts or sips. Quite simply a wonderful beer; highly recommended."
"Overall- This is supposed to be a triple??? I have had this beer multiple times and have never been impressed. Not sure why I keep revisiting it... Its a ""hot"" mess."
"Verdict: This may not be the best beer Victory has to offer, as I found the flavor profile lacking, but the appearance and smell were spot on, if only they could be reproduced in what I tasted and felt. Not a bad buy, but I probably wouldn't get it often, as I'm sure there are better options for Tripels as well as ones that are more characteristic of Tripels (I found this one played it's cards close to a yeasty Belgian White with a high ABV). Worthy of a try, but equally worthy of some sprucing up. B- (3.5)"
"Drinkability is perfect. Exceptionally smooth for 9% abv, and a taste I love to come back to more and more. Probably my second favorite tripel. Great beer!"
"Pours a Golden Yellow, bright and clean with a nice creamy head. I'll be honest, I looked at the BA review as I was deciding weather or not I would buy this brew. I am so glad I did. It's heavily carbonated, which I'm personally fine with and heavily acholated. That's not a word but I'm finishing this growler right now, the carbonation I think hides the alcohol well. Also do smell a light Banana flavor, maybe that's where it gets it's name from. A very very bready, Banana bready taste that I really like. Not too sweet per say, I've definitely had sweeter beers so can't complain about that. I love the aftertaste. I think it is really drinkable and will definitely be going so far as to recommending this to all my friends."
"D - adequate -- no big complaints, but not heaping any praise either; warms the body fairly quickly but misses the rich flavor I expect from a tripel"
"the idea behind this beer was the Belgian white style brewing....they kind of did it but not too well i think...very malty with citris and other spices that accumulate into an aftertaste for the tasteless....ok well maybe not that bad, but still its different...I can still drink it and enjoy it to some point and i think the fact that its like a Belgian white that i can stand it...in conclusion, its alright, just alright.."
"Verdict: awesomely representative of the style (if it were trying to be a Golden Ale) and worth tracking down, but not unique."
"This is the first Tripel I have had, so I can't say how well it captures the style,having had no others to compare it to. Just a little too sweet for my liking. But a good brew nonetheless."
"D: overall a good tasting beer, and at such a high alcohol content (9.5% ABV) it is pretty easy to drink. I think it is a decent beer...not the best from Victory (which I love) but in a variety pack it is a good change of pace"
"D- An ok Tripel. Give me Westmalle any day of the week! But a good attempt from victory, their V-12 Quad hit the style waaayy better but the Tripel is harder to do. I wouldn't turn one of these down, but wouldn't down too many as you'll be on your ass. Interesting section of the Victory website is ""Respect the Monkey"". I think that should say something about its drinkability."
"D: a good brew, but im struggling to draw a significant amount of similarities to a tripel."
"A cloudy golden yellow color pour with a 3 finger full white head. Aroma is very nice a grainy,yeasty,spicy mixture that begs you to take a drink. Flavor is more complex than I had expected, quite malty,slightly sweet,wheaty,a big spicy profile of clove, ginger, corriander,and peppercorns,some bananna and a hint of lemon peel, a dry,grainy crisp mouthfeel,with a long dry finish,very tasty."
"Not a great beer, missing a lot of complexity that other strong belgian-style beers tend to have. Too grainy and sweet in my opinion. Good, not great."
"One of the worst beers ever made....Way to sweet. More like a first timers beer. Very disappointing. For the price your better off getting a chimay tripple. For the taste... your better off with a bud lite. I like the lable though. Wish it tasted at least as good as it looked."
"Also, without fail this stuff will give me a massive headache when I wake up the next morning - way out of proportion to the actual amount of beer consumed. So there's that."
"Notes: I enjoyed this beer and felt that it was quite easy to drink for a 9.5% beer."
"Slightly watery mouthfeel. Definitely warms the insides with every sip. This is not the best tripel, but worth a try. Not sure I would be going out of my way looking for this one again."
"D - While I have in the past drank a number of these in a sitting, it's not something I'd recommend. The ABV sneaks up quickly, so beware!"
"POured a 12 oz bottle at about 48 degrees. Little or no head. appearance is clear/golden. Not much cloudiness, not much sweetness. Maybe a few spices, but they add to it's tartness rather than sweetness. Maybe a better cold beer drinkers beer. Flavors could have been more layered or defined."
"I have heard of this beer before but never had the opportunity to try this beer. Got it in a bottle and was pretty impressed with it. It reminded me of a dark beer but wasn't filling. The taste was rather hoppy without a strong after taste. I like this beer but you have to be careful because it does have a high alcohol content."
"The first time I had this beer I had it on tap at a local bar and enjoyed it very much. I am a huge fan of Belgian style ales and this one is favorite. Even with a high abv of 9.5 it is very easy to drink without having a strong alchol taste. The drinkability is great and its easy to drink more than one in a single sitting."
"D: Perhaps I'd have a second, but no guarantee. There was some malt character and spiciness coming through."
"D - Very drinkable for such a high ABV beer. I could drink several of these. A very good beer that I will be buying again."
"Overall, its descent. Definitely not the worst beer in the world but there is lots of room for improvement. The sour aftertaste is really what ruined it for me."
"Drinkability- Over all I enjoyed Golden Monkey. I hadn't ready the lable (other than the name) untill I had first tried it. My first impressions during my pour where Pils. I had not long before finished Prima from Victory. So when I took my first sip I enjoyed how much character this beer came with."
"Drink - The beer has a harsh taste to it and seems like it lacks balance. It did get better as the beer approached room temperature, but it was still just an average tasting beer. I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Overall, a decent brew, I guess. For me, its a type of brew I pick up to taste, don't enjoy it to the point where I get more but don't hate it to the point of a drain pour."
"d: this is incredibly drinkable for a beer with 9.5% abv."
"Golden and slightly hazy in color, this beer pours a big, frothy white head that holds very well. The aroma is citrus with hints of banana and clove. It has a medium body mouthfeel, which means it's not heavy, but it's not a light beer; it has real body. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming, almost a background note of heat. The flavor is a pleasant balance of mild maltiness and slight hops, and it finishes with just a touch of hop bitterness that's nice. This is a beer that develops more character as it warms in the glass as well. It's not as spicy as other examples of this beer, and suffers just a touch from the lack. Overall, this is nice example of the style, and folks who haven't had this style could easily enjoy and be introduced to the world of Belgian ales."
"D:this brew goes down fast!somehow it hides the alcohol content!I love this beer,it is one of my new favorites.I consider this beer to be a work of art.An american beer that that competes with Belgian craft beers,with a cheaper price."
"A pretty overwhelming brew, nothing to session with and may overpower all but the most daring of food. A good example of brewery prowess, but a bit of an orphan beer."
"D- sip this bad boy! I can definitely enjoy victory's depiction of the style."
"Drink: Not a terrible drink, but lacking the complexity of a great tripel. Nary a hint of alcohol, but plenty of bitter spices."
"D: I could probably drink this all day and not realize what was happening until after 3 or 4. A dangerous brew."
"I barely finished one bottle, thanks to a friend for sharing I don;t see myself buying a 6pack of this. I will stick with a La Fin Du Monde or New Belgium Tripple!!"
"Overall/notes - Not up to the typical standards I hold for tripels. Don't get me wrong, there's quality in this brew, but it's not subtle enough. Great for the extremists out there, I guess. For a simple beer drinker such as myself, it's too rough. It served me well at Christmas Eve with the family, though."
"Pours a golden body with a nice head initially. Head dwindles to minimal lacing on body. Smells of alcohol, banana bread and cloves, but mostly like alcohol-this is a high [EtOH] beer. Tastes strongly like banana bread with a slightly spicy feel on the sides on the tongue. Finishes with dryness from the alcohol and a slight oily feel. Overall, a very nice Belgian-style ale from a great brewery."
"D: Wouldn't want two of these, but the first one went down just fine."
"I've never been the biggest fan Golden Monkey, but I always come back for single now and then. It's a fun beer to drink. This is not what I look for in a Tripel, but still makes a good beer. I also think this is a good one for people just getting into craft beers."
"Overall this is a decent brew to chill with, but I'll never put up the ungodly high bill ($11.99) for a 6pk of this stuff. Ive had this beer on many occasions, and whenever I see it for $1.79 @ Hop City a bottle I usually pick some up for my wife. Dont get me wrong, I have plenty of high priced bottles in our cellar, but this brew is simply not worth the price tag. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Although it is not as comparable to other tripels, I still enjoy the drinkability of it and the earthy herbal qualities. This is something I would enjoy on a regular basis."
"Decent tripel but not too original. Decent fallback but nothing I'm going out of my way to make a regular drinker."
"Very nice head and good carbonation. Taste is very soft and 'round'. The whole group was very impressed with this triple."
"Love the style. Firmer & dryer than a classic Tripel, but that's why I like it so much."
"D-it gets more tangy as the drink goes on...its not a great drinkability....it was difficult to finish. The alcohol burn is too much for this one i think."
"Initially I found this beer to be a little too sweet, but as it warmed the spicy elements emerged and contributed to a drier, more balanced overall impression. Solid tripel overall!"
"Victory Golden Monkey has a light orange colour and a head that dies away but decent lacing remains. The smell is fairly weak, but what's there is spicy. It has a taste of bitter cloves into a smooth aftertaste which isn't better or alcoholic. This beer is nicely carbonated and thick. Watch out, this beer is very drinkable considering the alcohol content."
"Overall this is a triple that loses fair and square to its best belgian (Karmeliet and the trappists) and north american (Unibroue and Allagash come to mind) counterparts. However this still has a great cost/benefit relationship and is readily available in my area."
"D - This beer is suprisingly easy to drink, considering the high ABV and they've picked a good slogan in ""Respect the Monkey"" because this can sneak up on someone. A good beer considering the price tag. If you're big on tripels, like myself, you will enjoy this beer - but there are plenty better out there when you've got the money to spend."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers from my favorite local brewery and I'd never turn down the opportunity to have one or two of these."
"This isn't bad at all, just uninspiring. It grew on me a little bit as I drank it so maybe I'd get it again under the right circumstances. Just a little more sizzle than steak but that does seems to be Victory's rep."
"Pours an ever-so-delicate light gold. Many carb trails, and the white head soon becomes a small ring. Smell is peppery and more peppery. The taste is nicely complex, definitely spicy, but also mildly tart and lemony, with a satisfying hop kick. The feel is buttery smooth and carbonated. Drinkability high for the ABV. Good tripel here."
"Drink- Not bad, Probably will have again to try to find a fresher bottle."
"Did I mention the alcohol? Whew! Some beers are 10% and drink like they're 6%, this one is 9.5% and drinks like it's 14%."
"Not a terrible beer, but nothing special either. Pours a clear golden color with moderate rocky white head. The clarity of the beer is odd considering the yeast it leaves on the bottom of my glass. Smell is a decent tripel, yeast, apple, pear, bread, but the alcohol shows up. Same thing on the flavor, nothing off, just boozy. MF is a bit prickly and light--the carbonation is sharp, not creamy. Decent drink, made a bit harder by the apparent alcohol. Not terrible, but give me Hennepin instead for my American Tripel/BSPA category."
"Pours a medium pale golden color with a nearing soda like white head that disappears not long after the pour. Very little patchy lacing around the glass. Seems to have a balanced smell between the hops and malts. There's the fruity malts at first, like apples maybe a little peach. The alcohol is present as well. More so as the beer warms. Then you get the sorta citrus/floral notes in the background. The citrus notes are more along the lines or oranges rather than grapefruits. The nose finishes clean. Has a some what grainy earthy taste up front but then gets into the sweet fruit flavors like apple. Then your hit with the citric hops. Still along the lines of an orange flavor. It ends with a bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while. It has a medium body, smooth and carbonated. There's a little more carbonation then I would like. With a little less carbonation I think it would smooth out the body a little more making for a creamier mouthfeel. All in all this beer is ok. Dont think i could drink more than a couple of these. Not a very good representation of the style but not a bad beer. I could see myself buying this beer again although not a six pack. If i see singles then maybe. At 12.49 a sixer your better off getting something else."
"Carbonation is high and mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth. Very drinkable."
"Tulip glass from 12oz bottle. Served cold. Poured a clear golden yellow with rapid bubbling white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is of ripe banana and pepper with lighter hints of coriander and lemon zest. Ripe banana and citrus notes hit your taste buds first with a the rest of the profile taken up by spice (pepper, coriander, cinnamon), yeast, bread. The finish is pleasantly bitter with a good bit of alcohol burn on the throat. Mouthfeel is syrupy with an average carbonation. Heavy body. I love the balance between the malt, yeast, spices and hops in this beer. A good tripel"
"M: The doughy flavor resonates as this has an oily and slick body. This is a decent tripel that hides the alcohol very well. I remember it being much better though."
"This isn't the greatest Tripel but I could see why it'd have it's fans. It's a different take on the style that could be a major hit for people who love their beers sweet. And the ABV doesn't hurt if you're on a budget - this'll get you drunk cheaper than a lot of macro lagers."
"All of the flavors seem muddled together and just don't seem to meld properly. The beer is nice and tasty, but I have had many better tripels. For the price it can't be beat, but the St. Bernardus really shows this beer up. Maybe if I age this one for a few years it could really improve."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Given the high ABV, the alcohol in this beer is almost non-existent which is quite the feat, but the unfavorable finish keeps the one more on the sipping front."
"Overall, this is not a bad brew. As huge fans of Tripels, this does not disappoint, but it certainly is different than more traditional Belgian varieties."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable, like all good strong Belgians."
"D: Easy drinker. Doesn't really pack a punch, but it's a quality beer."
"D: Excellent Tripel. Slightly Warming but isn't that the point? good beer."
"Hey, it may not be fair but I can not believe the brewmaster leaned so heavily on the clove spice. Gives me a headache."
"It's an interesting brew, but not something I'd necessarily seek out again. There are better Tripels out there, especially from the Belgians themselves, and while this is a fair representation, it's also something that doesn't need to exist."
"Overall this beer has some spots in the taste profile bring down the rating in this category. Much better examples exist, even many US examples. It's only main redeeming fact is that it comes in a 12 oz bottle vs most tripels that you have to buy in huge 750 ml bottles."
"On a side note, I made the mistake of not checking the ABV on these before drinking five. As a general rule, it's always nice to know what you're up against in the alcohol content department before embarking upon a ""session."""
"Pours a slightly dark gold with a white head and a good amount of lace. Nose is spice, alcohol, light fruits, and some grain. Taste adds a bit of clove. Feel is a bit sweet and boozy without the accompanying complexity. I would like to try this aged as it has some potenial when fresh."
"This was deffinetly not my style. After seeing other reviews I thought this would be a great beer. I was wrong this missed the mark for me on many levels. I thought the smell was not good and the taste was an assult on my taste buds. Again I am only giving my opinion and yes they are like A- holes we all have one and the usually stink. I think I would not like to have another one of these beers again. My friend thinks this beer is great. His taste buds must be off : ) If you are a fan of Trippels you may like this. I haven't gotten to that level yet. However I do like Quads."
"gonna throw a couple in the cellar and see about that ""best by"" date."
"Verdict: A monkey with a bit of a punch!"
"I would drink this if offered and will probably by it again but I will not buy it often since there are so many better."
"D - If you enjoy Tripels, this one must be high on your list. It is a high quality Tripel with no bad or unintended tastes whatsoever."
"D: Looks great, smells good, tastes pretty good. A decent session beer, although you'll be buzzing after two of these. Would have this again."
"Poured into a goblet. Yellow with some suspended particles. Kind of looks like a pee sample from someone with a UTI. But that's gross so I digress. This is no lively beer coming from this bottle. There is plenty of carb. but not much head and it very quickly disperses to just the thinest ring around the glass. Smells of menagerie of spices, but it is hard for me to pick them out individually. Lots going on there though. Very light scent, but very busy. Alcohol is up front on this one, but it doesn't disagree with me. Citrus, spices, and a little yeastiness. Quite good, Quite drinkable. Not a very notable Triple, but well worth trying. Another worthy beverage from Victory.b"
"D: this is a nice American Belgian style brew- very authentic tasting, however I have had some that are done better (Allagash comes to mind)"
"Drink is very good even with the 9.5 wish I could find this more on a regular basis, very good beer."
"Pours a clear golden with a thin white head. Smells of dextriny malts, and a hint of molasses. Taste is very sweet cane sugar flavors up front, with a tart acidic middle, and a dry grainy finish. Very little detectable alcohol, nice! Mouthfeel is rather rich, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is really great for the ABV. This beer can trick you with its smooth drinkability, yet devilishly high alcohol! Highly reccomended."
"D: Surprisely drinkable for the alcohol content. But this is probably a one and done for me. I did enjoy it, but my review might not show that. I am just not that into this beer brewing style. Good stab for Victory."
"M/D: Medium bodied and pretty drinkable. The alcohol was masked pretty well though. Overall I was left underwhelmed. It seemed to be lacking in most areas. Its not a bad beer, but it isn't great."
"D: This is not a session beer. Decent effort, better than the victory beers i have had so far- I must say, I am not a fan of the brewery- there is always a fake/chemical candy sweetness present in their beers..."
"Served: August 16, 2010 @ Cookshop"
"T/M - High carbonation and medium body. Definitely some malt sweetness especially in front...lots of spice though I'm having trouble picking out anything specific. I want to say coriander and clove, but that may just be because that's what I expect to find. There is also a nice alcohol warming. mmmm"
"Eh, its kind of fruity in the back palate, medium to light in body. Nothing to see here folks. A really mediocre tripel by all measure. I guess the saving grace is that it masks the 9% ABV so well. But overall I'm not impressed. Try again Victory."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pale golden color with some floaters in the glass. Strong scents of yeast, grass, dry biscuits. The flavor is strong and wild. Dry bread, cloves, sugary esters, along with a faint bit of pepper and coriander. This is one crazy beer, not like any other tripels I have had. Alcohol is very noticed not hidden well at all. Not very drinkable."
"This looked promising when poured. A good golden colour(deeper than Duvel) and a thin but firm head that remained until the last drop. The smell sort of knocked me back though. A pungent salty almost sweaty smell that I found somewhat off putting despite a tasty robust thickish oily bitter element in the mouth that was full of a cosy burliness. Obviously well made but maybe not as complex as I might have hoped for. Still very interesting though. Get that nose sorted out and I think we'd really have a winner on our hands."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer pours with a good sized white foam head. It has a clear, tarnish gold liquid body. Rising carbonation is visible. A musty yeast Belgian yeast aroma emanates from my glass. It's a little sweet and a little sour (although that may just be the yeast playing tricks on my nose). The flavor is initially sweet and malty. It ends with some alcohol and a dry finish that is a bit peppery. These flavors linger on. There is the taste of orange peel through out each sip. Lots fo carbonation can be felt. It has a heavy body and a non-sticky coat. The beer is strong but drinkable. Personally, I wouldn't have more than a bottle or two at a time. Luckily, the six pack you purchase can be aged for a while; there's no pressure to drink it all quickly."
"Pass, will drink again! This is a good beer and has a handcrafted style and kick! Like this with itself alone or with barbecue.... prefer it medium cool to bring out its flavours."
"D: This brew just isn't really my thing. Needs a bit more flavor to stand out."
"Overall a very solid beer, but did not blow me away."
"I bought this beer in a ""cool label"" state of mind tonight, and I probably should have gotten some recommendations instead. There are lots of better examples of monk beer, specifically Three Philosophers and Avery Brewing's ""The Reverend."""
"I really like the taste though. I am quite surprised at how good tasting this is. I think it compares quite favorable to La Fin Du Monde. It has a nice spicy taste and a great mouthfeel. It is quite carbonated, and very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well. This was quite a bargain."
"I expect a bit more character from a triple, this one holds back a bit too much. Still drinkable though."
"Super super drinkable brew, it slides down pretty much like water which is kind of mind blowing for how high of an alcohol percentage it is. All in all it was an o.k. beer, definitely not representative of the tripel's I have had in the past but this one brings something new which is always cool."
"D: Very good, but the high ABV keeps it down, and I can see the citrusy-spicy flavor getting old. Decent beer though."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a withe head. In the aroma, dry candy sugar and alcohol. In the taste, alcohol stands out and a dryness from candy sugar and yeast. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry alcohol aftertaste. Very clean, but kind of standard."
"Overall impression: very drinkable tripel, although lighter than your typical Belgian tripel."
"Just the faintest bitter finish with hints of vanilla and cocoa of all things."
"Lighter side of medium, well carbonated. Drinkable, especially for something that is approaching 10% ABV."
"O: IMO this beer had some belgian IPA qualities, especially in finish. Also, the alcohol was very well hidden behind the hops ;) Does not come nearly to terms to ""Tripel"" as others in category (Appearance/Taste), but tasty nonetheless."
" Very drinkable. Good to have one or two with a few friends."
"As it warms up, I get a strong aroma of iodine/antiseptic and maybe even some urinal cake. I'm dropping my score to reflect this."
"Overall, not terribly drinkable. I've got three more; perhaps I'll use them or cooking."
"With that said, I think that with this version of the GM I got a version that brought out the worst in itself--too fresh, too cold--but at the same time, serves as reminder of why this beer is not discussed among the upper-echelon of great triples, traditional and American-interpretative-alike. It's a little too much. A little too assertive, a little too boozy. A really nice effort, but when its compared to some of the great interpretations of foreign styles Victory does--it's fantastic take on a German Pilsner (Prima), it's great version of a Barlywine (Old Horizontal), even it's strict-interpretation of a Baltic Porter--it's hard not to wish that the guys had tried to do a little less with this one."
"easy to drink because it's sugary but I would stop after two of these"
"D - Overall, this is fairly light and simple for a stronger beer. This is very drinkable, and I feel like I would be able to put away a few in a sitting."
"I bought this delightful beer on a whim and now I am officially addicted! Mind you, I had but one bottle and felt slightly tipsy. (OK - I am a small female who doesn't get out too often.) There is a zesty, zippy taste to this beer that forces my palate to beg for more. I highly recommend trying this glowing Belgian ale!"
"-notes from 02/07"
"D- An average tripel, but compared to some others I've had, this leaves a little to be desired. I'd happily drink this if served it, but I probably won't pick it up again on my own."
"Overall this is a fine tripel, one that sticks close to its Belgian roots."
"D-I've found that the this beer's drinkability can be a problem,in the sense that I can drink 3 or 4 without considering the ABV."
"Make no mistake this is a quality brew and one of my favorite US beers. And this is definately a distictive US beer in a Belgium style. Bravo!"
"D - not bad, curious to see what some time does to this - a bit of calming and melding might do wonders compared to fresh."
"Verdict: A solid Tripel, Golden Monkey is an enjoyable little rascal. Sure, it's nowhere near as refined as the real-deal Belgian beers, but this is a thoroughly impressive American version of the style."
"D--Eh, not a bad version and lets face it, Belgian Tripels and Belgians in general, tend to be pricey. This is a bang for the buck kind of beer, and certainly a nice choice on a 95 degree day..."
"D: The alcohol becomes somewhat apparent in the taste as the beer warms up, although this doesn't detract that much from the beer's drinkability. It's a good beer to sip."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass, clear golden yellow with almost no head. Smell is slightly skunky but with a nice mix of cloves and other spices present. Cloves are initially prevalent in the flavor, fading very quickly. There isn't as much going on here as some other tripels but it is pretty decent and very drinkable. Goes down very easily for nearing 10% ABV."
"Golden monkey poured a bright yellow color, with a head that disapated quickly. It smellt of various spices, typical of Belgian Tripels. It had a nice smooth, spicey taste; again typical of a belian tripel. Very easy to drink. Overall I felt this beer was really good. It is a bit lighter and easier to drink then a real belgian tripel."
"To me the more subtle fruity flavors were overpowered by the wheat taste, which while not a huge problem also left me wishing it had a more even taste overall. At the same time it isn't a bad beer, the ABV is nice and it is decent overall it just could be better."
"Overall, a nicely balanced brew that hides the high ABV well."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. It is a pale clear yellow with a mamoth white head. The head quickly recedes. It has a floral aroma, spicy, tropical fruit. The flavor is very floral and spicy, and sweet. Pineapple and pears are presen. It has a dry lingering finish. It is light in body and highly carbonated. A solid triple."
"Pours a off color yellow, like a pear in color. Head was white and foamy, but also really thin. Aroma had a mix of fruits and spices. The taste was a little too much on the spice side for a tripel. I was looking for more fruit. Good body, well carbonated. Not a bad beer, but i've had better tripels."
"D - Not a traditional Tripel by any means... However, this is a very interesting and complex offering from the folks at Victory... I would gladly drink again in the future and even invest in six pack form... Interesting and enjoyable..."
"I thought this was actually a pretty nice tripel - it lacks some of the yeast flavor, but makes up for it in being pretty tasty. Fairly refreshing too."
"True to its name, the Monkey pours a golden hue with a bit of head. Smells of both fruit and spices. The taste is spicy yet sweet. Its definitely a Belgian style, but doesn't taste quite like any Belgian I've had. I like this beer, but even after the many I've drank in my life, I wouldn't want to buy a six pack of it. There is something missing that makes me enjoy it, but not love it. Of course, there's also the matter of its high ABV, making it difficult to drink more than one or two at a time. Certainly an enjoyable beer."
" I am going to buy a few cases of this and share with only the friends I like who could savor the flavor and respect the beer."
"paired it with peppercorn cheddar (if you havent tried a saison or triple with peppercorn'd cheese you owe it to yourself, they pair amazingly), nom nom nom"
"d: pretty good...again, a go-to cheap tripel"
"Belgian yeast comes through pretty nicely in here and it tastes like a pretty good strain. I like the nice mix of hop flavor and bittering; a tripel with a decent hopping schedule is a good thing. Grainy malt is there and has just enough sweetness to balance things out well. This might be the best American tripel that is available in six-packs. I seem to pick up a sixer of the monkey at least once a year. Drinkability is high as it is a very balanced tripel. Solid stuff."
"Notes: Seems like a hopped up American version, not bad, but simply trying to add hops to another style won't make this the best of its style."
"D- This beer is very drinkable. Victory has this problem (in a good way) with making their higher ABV beers so damn drinkable. This makes the beer dangerous but still enjoyable as well!"
"D: Ignoring the aspects of sessionability of a 9.5% beer, the pepper is a tad too strong on this."
"D: Not a spectacular tripel but a pretty decent and drinkable beer. The high alcohol is noticeable but masked fairly well. The flavors could use a bit of polishing, but one the whole it's not bad."
"D- Not an outstanding triple, but certainly not a bad one either."
"(D) not my favorite tripel - it's a bit too sweet and this aggravates the medicinal character. that being said, ""not my favorite tripel"" still equates to ""damn good beer"". I'd gladly drink two of these on a drinkin' night... at nearly 10% ABV, they catch up on you quick. for the price, this is a great example of BELGIAN style beer and i will certainly seek this affordable little gem out again."
"Drinkability - This is going down very nicely in this 85 degree heat and high humidity. A nice balance is struck between the spicy and sweet sides of this brew. The lively carbonation helps round the beer out with a dry finish. This beer strikes a nice balance between simple and complex and presents itself as such. A nice interpretation of a Belgian Tripel and a highly enjoyable beer. I will definitely be returning to this beer many more times as it is affordable and delicious."
"pours a clear copper orange color with large white creamy head and lacing, and lively fizzy carbonation. lots of spices in the flavor with hints of citrus, and staw. medium body, thin oily texture. astringent bitter finish. short flavor duration. decent brew but nothing special. had quite a few times and have always enjoyed."
"I think this would make a good cross-over beer for people. A highly enjoyable tripel, perhaps lacking some of the complexity of a true Belgian."
"Pours a hazy somewhat darkened golden color. Produces a thick head that recedes pretty quickly leaving virtually no lacing. Had a weird experience with this one, opened the bottled, turned to toss the cap in the garbage, turned back around and found it foaming all over my counter. Thought maybe I banged it around a bit on the way home but the other varieties in the sampler pack didn't do this and 24 hours later the Golden Monkey still did, I don't know. The strange part is it really doesn't seem overcarbonated, anyway moving on. Scent is spicey and yeasty but a little underwhelming. Taste is definitely Belgian inspired but not quite Belgian. Floral hoppiness up front with some spiceness in the finish that becomes more potent as it warms. Alcohol is well hidden, I was actually shocked when I looked at the label and saw 9.5%. That being said it's pretty easy for the booze to sneak up on you, which takes away a bit from an otherwise very drinkable brew. I would drink several of these but I'd start getting sloppy after the first few."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is pretty low, this beer is kicking my butt."
"Yikes. After one of these and a HopDevil I wasn't able to concentrate. Reading the Tripel description it would seem Victory hit this one true to form but not necessarily Belgian. It's Belgian style like American Chinese food is Chinese. Surprisingly light golden color and sweet smell. I really couldn't get a sense of what I was actually smelling. Taste was strong and mouthfeel was light. Drinkability was pretty high."
"My first tripel style beer, must say it is my new favorite just edging out 90 minute IPA. Only need one or two beers after a long day at work to help unwind. The brew was from a half barrel keg and stored in a growler. The last beer from the growler had a built-up volume of the wheat and yeast giving the initial pour very attractive. Golden Monkey is where its at."
"drinkability: average belgian, not horrible, might drink again."
"I definitely enjoyed this more the second time around. Would I go out and buy a six pack? No, probably not. Victory is a great brewery but so far this is my least favorite of their offerings. I agree that there are way better Belgians out there."
"Notes: This is a solid triple a nice sweetness from the malts and a decent amount of hopiness. A good one to pick up. Cheers."
"D: I tried this a few years ago and didn't like it, I thought I'd try it again to see if my tastes have changed since I'm on a Tripel kick as of late. They haven't, I still don't like it. Having Allagash Tripel recently to compare, it's like night and day. I'm still a big fan of Victory, they make great beer across the board, so it's all right to have one stinker."
"D: It does seem pretty appropriate for summer. It is refreshing."
"12 oz bottle to a flute glass. Pours translucent golden, lots of carbonation and some sediment. Nice big fluffy white head retains well. Stays at pinky-size the whole time and leaves some lacing. Smell is lots of banana, spice and yeast. Overall sweeter smelling than your average tripel. As soon as it hits the tongue I can detect some sort of off-taste. I can't really put a finger on it, maybe it's those exotic spices from the East. Definitely lots of banana. Caramel sweetness, white pepper, yeast. Alcohol is definitely there and warm going down the throat. I truthfully do enjoy the sweetness of the taste a little, but it seems messy and one-dimensional. Someone in another review said banana creme brulee, I'll agree with that. Mouthfeel is a too carbonated and boozy, has a decent creaminess. Drinkability suffers from that and the sweetness, I am pretty tolerable when it comes to sweetness in a beer so I didn't mind this too much but I know this would be a turn-off for others. Overall interesting effort, the taste wasn't bad, just wish it more balanced somehow."
"D: Highly drinkable, with good fruit flavors and a bit of sweetness to balance the heat from the alcohol"
"Pours a lemony yellow, decent head. Have to be careful of the pour as you can easily pour a lot of the sediment from the bottle into your beer. Sweet smell....very fruity. This is a very drinkable beer, especially in the summer. I can see myself enjoying more then a few of the while the BBQ is heating up."
"mobile review"
"Had this at the Baltimore Beer Festival, was probably one of my favorites. Had all of the fruit/spice combinations that I would expect. Alcohol content high but the taste is not boozy. Hard to tell exactly what appearance was, as they gave us cups that were hard to see through."
"I find this beer pretty decent, although I found the flavor and aroma lacked a little depth."
"While beering, I usually ignore anything else I intended to get in order to have this on draft, when available, whenever. Not sure if I prefer more in the bottle or draft - both really tasty."
"I've had better examples of this style from North America. All of the elements of a great trippel are present, but get overshadowed by the overly predominate banana flavor."
"The appearance is a cloudy, deep golden color with lots of yeast and a foamy white head. The aroma is a yeasty herbal scent with some nice sweet notes towards the end. The flavor is again of a herbal-clove note mixed with some sweet malts and a light touch of alcohol. There is also a light hint of banana as well. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body with a good bit of carbonation, although it is a bit heavy at times. There is a nice warming sensation from the alcohol and it maintains a good drinkability considering the ABV."
"Pours a crisp, sparkling golden hue, capped with a gorgeous rocky head. Wonderful aromas of peppery spice, Belgian yeast, honey malt and a hint of barnyard. A deliciously well balanced beer, with hints of citrus, sweet malt, banana, clove and drying alcohol. I could drink a lot of this one, as the carbonation levels make this one go down so smoothly, especially with the 9.5% alcohol content. An excellent buy, at less than $2 a bottle."
"D: I enjoyed it, although I'm anxious to try more of the style, that being said, I would def. have again."
"D: very drinkable for a tripel; smooth and refreshing."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - So so. I'm about halfway done with it and it is beginning to be a chore for me. As I stated in my taste section, this beer is almost too in your face. The flavors and spices to me are overwhelming, and the almost 10 percent alcohol content makes this quite a potent beer. I'm glad I tried it but not my favorite version of the style."
"Overall, this is a very good tripel, another great brew from Victory."
"D: Good drinkability, but one or two is definitely enough based on the 9.5% ABV"
"Probably a little too easy to drink given the ABV. I would buy this again."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D: watch that high abv, great for when i am in the mood for the style"
"This is a good sipping beer that will kick your ass if consumed too quickly or in excess. I enjoyed two over the course of a long summer evening. It was refressing and bursting with complex flavor on the tongue, but the sweet after taste was slightly annoying."
"I get this when I'm in the rare mood for liquor, but don't want bourbon."
"Even so, the price tag is off-putting. Taking into account the military mark-up, $14 and change is a lot for a six, even if it adds up to 2-3 sittings. I'd rather drop $9 or so for a Hennepin 750 ml or $7 for a Pranqster 4 pack. Glad I tried it, but it was a bit of a let down."
"Overall, a nice example of the style. I like it only a little less than LFdM."
"I was happy to see Victory brewing in my liquor store. I remeber reading about Hop Devil in a Michael Jackson book a while ago. served it well chilled in a pilsner glass. Poured a bright, crystal clear yellow with a haziness toward the top and a nice, bubbly two finger head. Fine lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was bursting with banana, clove, raisin, and candied fruit. The first sip was flavorful with a tanginess from the bubbles. The hops in the finish linger for a while with a nice bitterness. Complexity was there but then thinned out a little. All around decent tripel. Cheers!"
"Cloudy, golden yellow with a big and bubbly white head out of a caged 750. Definitely yeasty in the aroma. Also sweet bread, some banana, and caramelized sugars. Apple, banana, and grape along with some spiciness in the flavor...oh yeah, there's also plenty of alcohol to taste. This beer just wasn't a big hit with me. It had great creamy feel, but really for a big beer, there wasn't a lot going on."
"Golden Monkey is a sipping beer, but it's a good sipping beer. I can feel the alcohol halfway through the glass and the flavors are becoming more complex and integrated as it warms. It has a pleasantly warming character, however I'd be hard pressed to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Slightly thin body with a cheap euro malt taste."
"D= 4.0 This would be a nice session beer, lots of carbonation would perhaps be filling after a time. The spice could have made this beer amazing but it's an ok triple. Decent brew from Victory"
"No lack of flavor in this one, that's for sure."
"Mouthfeel thins, which was welcome since I didn't like what it brought to the table upfront. A little expensive and tough to drink to be deemed a drinkable beer. Pass."
"I split a bomber with my wife and didn't really want any more. Tastes almost identical to my home brew that I though had yeast bite. Overall not a bad tripel but there are much better options out there."
"Overall this was a solid tripel but nothing to write home about, good for fans of tripels that are malt-dominant, as opposed to those dominated by fruit flavors and spices. Worth a shot if you see it around."
"d-if you like Belgian style beers this would be a good one to drink for a while but if not this might be one that you just have to experience for yourself and have one"
"Poured from a bomber into my Chimay goblet, golden (a little more cloudy than Prima) with a two finger white head. Very pleasant smell, mostly of bananas with a slight touch of alcohol. Tastes a lot like it smells...though with more alcohol than banana. I actually dry heaved a little bit as I held it in my both. I'm about 2/3 of the way through with my bomber and feeling a little woozy, so I don't drink I could drink more than one bomber in an evening, though it is a pretty decent tripel."
"D - As it warms up, the alcohol taste starts getting overpowering. Rather hard to finish and want to grab another. Probably fair for such a high ABV."
"Pours golden with a nice white head that dissipates into a thin layer and leaves little lacing. Aroma of sweet bready malt, some banana and a hint of clove and spice. The taste is quite complex. A very nice, very German malt background supports banana, clove, white pepper, ginger, apple and grape notes. This beer definitely has some bitterness, but is sweet overall with the alcohol showing through some, but not dominating. Medium bodied with a slightly sticky mouthfeel, this beer does not strike me as being the most drinkable with the alcohol showing through a bit too much, but it is still pretty decent. A creative American take on a Belgian style."
"D-this has a fantastic feel to it and very solid tastes. It is quite malty forward and lighter on the sweetness; but it is pretty solid."
"D- I'd buy again but with a knowing of the fact i'm buying the alcohol not the style beer."
"I actually thought I was picking up a six-pack of Prima Pils, but discovered my mistake when I got home. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm guessing I won't finish the rest for awhile. Can something be crisp and cloying at the same time?"
"full bodied, refreshing but thick nonetheless. very worthy beer by victory."
"pours a clear golden with a one finger white head. not as lively as expected. smells strong of coriander, with backrounds of flora and citrus. the coriander kind of runs a muck over the other pleasant/fainter smells. the taste is heavy. sweet beginning with clove, yeast, and grain. finish is a strong, peppery spice. crisp with high carbonation on the tongue. completely masked alcohol. leaves a bit of a grassy taste on the palate. im glad i got to try a nicer version of this brew, but a bit too much coriander, clove, and pepper for me to even enjoy it."
"Spend the extra few bucks and get yourself a St. Bernardus and enjoy a quality beer, because this one is far from it. Cheers!"
"Overall Impression: This is a great starter Tripel for Newbeez, but those already familiar with the style may find it to be average at best. It IS a great value, and it is from one of our local breweries, so give it a shot."
"Drinkability- would buy it again, the 9.5 doesn't take much get you comfortable."
"If you want a Tripel, get one brewed by monks (Or, at the very least, one that comes from Quebec or Maine). Seriously, the good people at Victory need to add a caveat to the label: ""Warning! Do NOT drink this beer directly out of the refrigerator!"""
"m/d- It took me awhile to get into this one. The mouthfeel was great, nice warmth and very smooth. Dont think I will be getting this again though..just not my speed."
"D - A good, solid beer, ABV is masked well, this was included in a mix pack, glad a have a few more, but I probably will not buy a six pack of just this."
"For me victory is really up and down, and this one is definetely down. Not a tripel I will be having again."
"This beer seemed kind of jumbled up as far as flavors go. Everything kind of competes on the tongue for the spotlight. A bit on the hot side as well."
"Overall, a very attractive and affordable tripel."
"D - Good drinkability. You can taste the alcohol a little too much but overall pretty nice."
"Overall- Not my favorite tripel, but not a bad one either."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits and spices. Taste is a good mixture of spices, fruits, and alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a very solid brew."
"Decent Belgian triple out of PA. Easy drinking and I would have one again."
"D: This shines here its cheap for the style represented, and tasty 9% abv is no slouch, could easily save half a six pack for another time, overall a solid beer to enjoy anytime you crave this style but dont want to break out that 10 dollar bottle."
"Unfortunately, I don't have a Golden Monkey in front of me right now, or I would add more specifics. I'm writing this from memory. Good memories..."
"D: really nice tripel style"
"Overall, not offensive, but fails to distinguish itself. Hard to ignore the slight off flavors."
"But I am a big fan of Victory, and these American made Belgiums are neat because they haven't had to journey as far."
"I really think price/value should be a rating on here. It matters to most people if a beer is affordable. Golden Monkey is a beer that a Belgian lover on a budget will fall in love with. It's 12.99 a six pack which beats the hell out Chimay. Plus they have a high alcohol content which means you only need a couple to get a little buzz. I highly recommend this beer."
"D: This six pack was a delight, a fine substitute for a Chimay if your are on a budget. Brings just about as much as a Chimay does to the party, though it could stand to look at little prettier."
"d - It was a decent beer, not the best tripel I've had but I would try it again."
"Bright golden color with an inch thick white head that fades to a persistent thin cover. Strong aroma that's quite hard to pin down. Herbal and floral for sure but nothing distinct. Flavor is much the same. Strong yeast derived flavors with a substantial bitterness. Fruit and perfume with a crisp bitter finish. Hides its high alcohol pretty well. Fairly thin body and lively carbonation. Smooth enough to get you in trouble if you're careless but complex enough to sip slowly. Good way to satisfy a Tripel craving affordably."
"D: I'm slightly confused with the style choice, but I enjoyed this brew."
"D: There are better authentic/original tripels out there, and still even better craft made belgian style tripels as well. With that said, this isn't a bad brew by any means, just lacks the ability to stand out from the myriad of real good ones out there. For the price of ten bucks for a six pack, however, it's pretty good value for that price. Not a good introduction to the tripel style, however."
"Drinkable, but I would pick up other examples of this style first."
"D: I drank it and might sample again, interested in tap v bottle. I found it hid the alcohol decently well and gave me a nice smile on lunch break, didn't invite me back for more though. Lunch on the other hand was excellent."
"This is an okay domestic Tripel, not the best but worth a go."
"D - Dare I say that even though this beer is 9.5% ABV it's shockingly drinkable? Seems like this compared with the smoothness overall of the beer could cause problems. It could easily creep up on you if you don't have self control and sip it. After all, a beer this high should be sipped."
"D= Pretty good. Not the worst tripel but far from the best as well. Really a middle of the road sort of tripel. I really like it but I really like tripels and I'm gonna rate this one based on tripels in general."
"As a beer it stand strongly on its own; I believe it is most representative of an American take on the Belgian beer due to the keynote Victory use of hops. ""Belgian Inspired"" reflects it accurately."
"When I woke up, everyone had gone home.."
"Not bad. Certainly more drinkable than a few other domestic triples I've had. Not the best though."
"Drinkability: Definitely could drink more than one of these in a sitting and then have it creep up on me. Very good offering in this style by Victory. Might get the growler filled with it the next time I go to the brewery."
"Overall, very tasty and very drinkable. Alcohol only slightly noticeable in a slightly warming finish. I had to purposely slow down while drinking this beer so as to not get ""bitten by the Monkey"" This beer deviates from the style a bit, but is a tasty offering in its own right."
"Highly recommend."
"Drinkabiliy - I would suggest bringing a 6-pack to split amongst friends, unless(!!!) if they don't like craft beers. This beer is more for the ""snobs"" than the Budweiser/Corona/Miller light crowd. I will surely make light work of this 6-pack, but I also like good beer. Cheers!"
"Very drinkable and reminiscent of the Sam Adams Hallartau Imperial Pilsner."
"Overall this is not one of my favorite styles and not one of my favorites from the style."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer overall, but there are so many better tripels out there."
"I haven't tried this one in over two years. I enjoyed it enough but would not let it warm up too much. Not a bad deal for the price."
"I remember the first time I ever had the Golden Monkey. I thought it was the worst tasting thing I've ever had. That was when I first started drinking the good beers. I forgot about the Monkey for a few years and just the other day I thought I would give it another chance. Damn Iove high ABV beers. It only takes a few to get the job done. The Monkey is one of my favourite beers now a days. Taste lacks a bit but the smell and color are gorgeous. Thank you Victory!!"
"Fine enough tripel, but not in the class with big boys. Pretty easy to drink at this ABV. A nice american effort at a tripel, but I will pass on this one next time."
"M/D-very sweet and dry and rather light in body considering the abv and while it can get someone in trouble if they ignore the alcohol content is still seems rather lacking for a tripel so while it is a rather good and drinkable beer it just seems like a run of the mill tripel"
"The high alcohol content seems to be ""masking"" the potential flavors of this beer. I like it but it could be so much better."
"D: I have to be honest and say that I was disappointed with this one. It's a nice beer, but not in the same ballpark as the best examples of the style. The light body helps it go down quicker than the high ABV would warrant."
"D- something about this beer that makes it very drinkable to me. the abv is elevated but well-balanced and drinks well. every time I come across it, something makes me pick up a sixer (maybe its that monkey's eye staring me down)."
"Pours a clearish yellow, some sediment, fizzy white head. Smell: pale malt, pear, lemon, slight funk, windex. Taste: fairly boozy, pear, banana-ish, clove spice, again a touch of funk, and a little citrus peel and spicy hop character. Active carbonation, wheat fluffiness. Ok, but doesn't excite."
"- Quite drinkable and smooth, and certainly hides the alcohol very well. Little bit of a burning spice in the aftertaste... certainly an interesting and strong Belgian style."
"D: This is an O.K. Tripel. Flavors are a little subdued IMO and nothing about the brew really excites. Average representation of style + rather high abv. = not great drinkability. lf I'm going to get a little light-headed from one beer I want it to be damn good."
"D - Not a bad triple! The sediment was a bit unfortunate but it's a solid beer that's well balanced and conceals the alcohol nicely."
"D- Seems like this brew had all of the right components for a traditional Belgian Tripel. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to expectations."
"Overall, a pretty drinkable tripel, my first of the style, though. The only thing that knocks this score down is the relatively high ABV. According to some of the other comments about this beer, there is better to be had, but this wasn't a bad showing for the first one I've tried."
"D-not a bad beer of the tripel style, it holds up well to chimay and other belgian brands but probably doesn't surpass them in quality, its enjoyable with a nice warming sensation from the alcohol bite at the end"
"Overall this beer tastes like more of an attempt to make a Belgian Strong Pale ale rather then a Tripel. Overall a decent beer but its clearly missing its style and not in experimental way. Just mediocre. In your local bottle shop spring for a 4pk or 750 of LA Fin Du Monde or Chimay. You're likely to find those."
"Drinkability is a 4.0. This is a good Tripel with a respectable yeast prescence in taste and smell. It could hide the ABV a bit more, and I would prefer a more interesting appearance, but overall okay rep for the style from Victory."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is the clear highlight. Dry in the finish with almost nothing lingering. Very more-ish. The alcohol is hidden incredibly well, and this is an enjoyable sipper."
"Another amazing beer by Downingtown, PA's Finest"
"Really coats your mouth good carb and medium bodied. Very high alcohol content would't drink more than one."
"Poured thick and golden, little or no carbonation, opaque. No head. Smelled slighlty sweet/sour with hints of citrus. Tasted like the inside of a homeless person's shoe stuffed full of hops and Lemon Pledge. Worst beer I've ever tasted. After forcing that first one down, I just kept it in the fridge and unloaded it on unsuspecting hop fetishists."
"The nose senses a subtle aroma of orange and coriander while the palate is greeted by lemon with a bitter straw aftertaste. Despite the light body, this tripel is potentially potent to anyone who mistakes for a less worthy opponent. This is highly drinkable, but not overly complex, Belgian-style ale from the good folks up in Downingtown, Pennsylvania."
"Mouthfeel is right on, but the boldness of each taste make it less than very drinkable."
"high alcohol negligible... I am sticking with more authentic tripels"
"if tl;dr, a good if simple tripel that has always has a space reserved for it in my fridge."
"For a Belgian style, this beer is a little tame. Although is it good in its own right? Absolutely. Makes a good intro to the Belgian style for someone unfamiliar with it."
"D: Its 9.5, It will beat you into submission"
"This beer is very drinkable. I have had it on tap at the brewery and now again in the bottle. Both version are delicious. I will buy a few more bottles for cellaring."
"Drinkability is hindered by the alcohol. An enjoyable sipper but not one to drink multiple times in a session."
"Drinkability: Not a very exciting tripel, but certainly a drinkable one. For the right price, I'd buy it again. (I bought this 750mL at Ray's for only $3.00!)"
"Drinkability is good! It goes down fairly easy and is pretty tasty. I'm not sure that its that best example of the style but not too bad either. I wouldn't mind having a few more of these."
"Woo... taste is also boozy, very sweet and sharp. Lots of spices and a bit of earthy hoppiness and a little malty. It's ok but not nearly as good as say a Westmalle tripel. Worth trying but not the best example of the style."
"Drinkability: The beer itself was very drinkable, but I really didn't love the product. I mean 9.5% and really lacking in complexity? It was really refershing and would have been great for the summer or as as session beer, that is if it was half the abv it currently is."
"Cheers!!"
"Taste was a pretty smooth, somewhat boozy but pretty tasty. Starts a little light but finishes off strong. Mouthfeel on this was not neccesarily something that I would continue to crave, leading to my drinkability remark. This is a very fine beer, but just for one, it's to sweet to have a few and too boozy to stand up after a few, but overall, get one, have one, and move on."
"Notes: It´s a nice tripel and while it might not be a great example for the style I sure am glad it exists and will be pleased to find it as a choice on any given pub. Having said that, and not being a huge fan of the style, it is not a brew that I will seek often and particularly not at home. But a good brew in any case..."
"Pours a sunny, slightly hazy golden, with a big, dense, billowy head that drops slowly. The aroma is sharp and fruity - pear, apple, persimmon, some clove and allspice. The flavor is very fruity and spicy, like a spiced pear. There is some apple, even a little banana in the mix, with a fair bit of spice, though not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is thin but well carbonated."
"Drink ability is above average but not the best from this style. Most tripels I've had were highly drink able and light but this one was rough around the edges. It's a decent beer but nowhere near the top in it's style"
"mouthfeel is creamy with a good bit of carbonation."
"Smell from bottle was light and alluring. I am anxious to try other Victory beers if they are like this one."
"Beer pours a nice amber colour, lots of yeast, and i nice looking head that quickly fades. Smells fruity, but with an underlying content of alcohol, it's pleasant, but lets you know that there is a true beer lying underneath. Taste is beautiful, a full bodies feel and the spices really come through, tastes great without letting the abnormally high alcohol content hit you, hoppiness is also a very big plus, like drinking a fruity tree. As previously stated, the feel is tremendous, and the drinkability is also exceptionally high, especially for a Tripel, which usually leaves me feeling like a it's a little strong to keep drinking, while i could drink this all day, and love it. This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had, and I cannot recommend it highly enough"
"As far as drinking it again: I've had better tripels. I'd probably try to find those first."
"Not my favorite beer from Victory. Definetly not my favorite style of beer. I'm sure there are better ones out there in the style as well."
"The taste is spicey alcohol, clear but not overly strong or rough, somewhat raisiny (golden raisins) and lightly sweet with hints of banana, hay, yeast, and mineral water. It has a slightly dry, spicey finish with a gently spicey aftertaste with very faint yeastiness. It has a pretty good feel, a bit zesty but firm, yet is very one-dimensional and rather bland. For the most part, it is just spicey alcohol in character, if not actually harsh or rough, with only a very faintly fruity-yeasty element. Ultimately, it is fairly pleasant but very boring and gets somewhat tiresome with the strength."
"M&D - Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. I wouldn't rate it high on the drinkability scale just because of the high ABV...other than that, this is a solid brew."
"Poured a hazy golden/orange with a bright white head, but not long-lasting or very lace-worthy. The smell was blood orange, orange peel, pineapple, lime, and a very dominant alcohol factor. The flavor yielded all of these flavors and then some, but it was all upfront, with very little dissolve, and a very strong alcohol finish. Very imbalanced. The texture was nicely carbonated and medium-bodied, but the combination of super-sweet and strong alcohol essence was not pleasant."
"Good drinkability, well made in the style."
"This beer pours a hazy golden yellow with an ample amount of sediment dancing in the glass. A one finger of sudsy head capped this beer, receded relatively quickly and left nice streaks of lacing on the glass. Nose is yeast, banana, and clove. Taste is starts slightly grainy with a malt balance, the middle is filled out by a yeast flavoring with a touch of clove and nutmeg, citrusy flavoring, pear and banana fill out the finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation, starts off rather light and crisp, but has a thicker more dense finish to it. Wrath of the Golden Monkey on this one - it's a highly drinkable Tripel with a barely distinguishable ABV. Careful with this one!"
" SO, Golden Monkey. The name sounds cool and the label looked makeshift. i like that kinda thing. Do you remember the labels on old TV sitcoms when they drank beer before widespread sponsorship from major corporations? It made me think of that.(I had a few beers before so I was kinda abstract.If ya know what I mean.) It did not look like a Fancy ""Fear and loathing", label on a beer bottle. I poured it into a pint glass. A pretty good head. I was quite dark in the bar so i can""t really describe the color. The smell was bananas strait up bananas!. The Taste was not! it was very bitter, too bitter, way too bitter. I told my girlfriend it was like eating a pound of bananas and swiging orange peel flavored Mr. Boston charcoal filtered vodka. Then puking that all up and the after-taste left in my mouth would have been Golden Monkey. I wanted to buy some Golden Monkey and give it to my friends and pretend it was a quintessential item to my existence. Then see the look on there faces as they coughed up some pure banana bile. I was purely disappointed because that was the only beer in that news paper article the seemed to be intriguing to me. You live and learn. I do not recommend this to beer to most people but i know there are people that think this is the greatest achievement since the cell phone. Hey was was made for Christ sake."
"Although not a bad effort, it doesn't really stand up compared to the profound flavor profiles of La Fin Du Monde or Mad Bitch. It is sad that a beer I once cherished has fallen out of favor, but I guess it's a testament to all of the amazing brews I've had in the past couple of years."
"Doesn't compare with the Belgians of the style, but I'm not sure that is their attempt (it does come in sixers, after all). Though not particularly innovative, not bad on its own, either."
"That s a pretty good beer and very true to style in every respect which is good. However, one little difference it is a bit sweeter which is.... a good thing actually. It is a really nice sweet taste of honey, fresh honey that is but it still has some hop bitterness nd strong floral notes. REALLY GOOD. I will have this again soon!"
"Due to the wonderful flavor, and the lack of alcohol presence, it is extremely drinkable."
"D: I wasn't too enthusiastic about finishing this, and moved onto something else afterward. Not something I'll have again."
"D - Good overall, this is one of the most complex beers I've had. Alcohol and bitterness stop this well short of a perfect beer. Very impressed though."
"D: Defiantly a sipping beer"
"Drinkability: Not my cup of tea (or beer for this matter), may need to just warm and open up a little, but its very metallic; interestingly its 9.5 abv, something you would not expect. I wouldn't say its very drinkable and I'm not one to recommend this."
"Overall: Subtle flavors, high drink-ability and decent abv equal tasty but the hype and award winning title might be stretching it unless they are awarding their chaotic chemistry to incorporate such a combination."
"D: Pretty high ABVs and heavy body means just one for me"
"A very nice Tripel at a reasonable price. The beer pours a bright, pale banana yellow with a smallish white head. It's mostly clear with a slight haze. The aroma is primarily spice and malt. It's a blend of coriander and other Belgian-style spicing with a sweet, honey-ish grain note. The flavor is similar. There's plenty of spicing, a touch of hops and a strong malt backbone. The malt isn't nearly as sticky as I expected from the relatively high 9.5% abv. Despite the sweet malt flavor, it's actually a fairly dry beer, refreshing for the style. The mouthfeel is full and round, while maintaining a certain crispness. It's dangerously easy to drink."
"A pretty decent trippel. There are lots better though. But not bad and worth a try. Too strong to session."
"CHEERS!!"
"I would definitely buy this again and highly recommend it. Looking forward to finishing the Growler...tomorrow!"
"Excellent beer, will drink any day of the week."
"Pale golden color with a respectable white head that fades to a nice layer of bubbles that cling beautifully to the side of the glass. Subtle spice aromas with a firm backbone of hoppy citrus. The carbonation greets the palate nicely and clears the way for the zesty, citrus flavor in the middle. Then it finishes with a sharp dryness that lingers for some time. The spicy notes do a nice job of balancing out the hops. The high ABV is a bit more noticeable than I would like it to be on the finish and it has an overly sugary quality that I didn't find appealing. Otherwise though, a good beer but certainly not great. Somewhat disappointing to be honest."
"Probably not the best tripel I have ever had, but all in all not bad. Considering a bottle of Chimay White is about $6, the $12 for the six pack makes it more enjoyable."
"Overall, just ok. Not tough to drink, but has some harsh edges. I can think of others of the style that I'd go to first. Try it but don't think this is a typical Belgian tripel."
"The mouth is well-carbonated and a bit spritzy. This is a pretty sweet Tripel. Nice pleasant citrus fronting, with a spicy bite in the middle, and finishes sweet and clean. This is a pretty good beer. I haven't the greatest experience with this style, but I liked this one."
"this is good beer anyway you look at it and you cant beat the price either!!! the guy at the grocery store reccommended this and i cant stop drinking it!!! six packs cost 11.99 and a tall boy is 6.99 and this kicks in at a heaping 9.5% also oh yeah!!!"
"D - The aftertaste is a bit abrasive for my liking, and the ABV seems to overpower the flavours. I would personally prefer a Belgian tripel."
"On tap. Pours a very clear gold (who'd have thought?) with a small white head. Smells quite sweet, with notes of citrus and banana, as well as a bit of spicy yeast. Tastes very sugary, with a lot of lemon and other fruit. A bit peppery. Warming finish. Light-medium body. Over the top and too sweet for a tripel."
"The mouthfeel is perfect due to the bottle conditioning. The aftertaste is a bit dry due to the more than usual amount of hops. The high abv limits consumption to one or maybe two bottles in one session. One of the best American made Tripels."
"Pours a light yellow color with a nice one finger head. There are a lot of carbonation bubbles presence. The smell is of spices and bread malts, with a hint of banana and clove present. The taste is of bread malts with spice for sure present, there is also clove, banana, and maybe another fruity note present. The mouthfeel was a little syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall I thought the mouthfeel distracted me a little from drinking more of these, I thought that it had a good taste and aroma for a tripel, but the mouthfeel threw me off."
"D - Very appealing... pleasant and not overbearing."
"A dangerously drinkable Tripel you could easily get into trouble drinking these the go down that well."
"This is a nice tripel, even if it isn't the most traditional interpretation of the style. A nice offering from one of my favorite breweries on the east coast."
"Dr. Very easy to drink despite the high ABV."
"Overall, I really think this beer is drinkable, despite the high abv, which is hidden fairly well. Not something I would drink too many bottles of, however."
"pours a golden yellow color with a small head for a tripel but had some nice lacing and a fresh ring til the end the smell was clove bananas melon and some spice..the taste was the same it was not overpowering on the clove it was easy on the mouth a little tart and very refreshing the clove and bananas balanced together with the belgian yeast and coriander to make a delicious tripel i was impressed with this one i enjoyed and will recommend for sure"
"Pretty good with some age."
"The smell of sweet corn calls out DMS spoilage. Some coriander and orange peel, but not much. A flat feel to it, too bad. Nothing else going on with this beer. The DMS is in the nose mostly, some in the taste. I didn't finish this one and left it downstairs."
"Not a beer I'll seek out but certainly one I'll be drinking again."
"d- i'm not a fan of big beers like this, but i definately didn't hate it, i'll have it again, just a tad strong though, no session for this bad boy, the monkey will get you.."
"not one I would seek out again, strictly because it is hoppy enough to pass for a poor belgian pale ale, but soulless for a tripel."
"D: Scary drinkabilty, this is a very good locally brewed triple."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a Macro-ish,yellow color with a surprisingly (for a Tripel ) small 1/2 finger head which disappears immediately into a modest lace. What's not unexpected is the level of carbonation..there's a sparkly effervescence. Aroma is dry and somewhat citrusy. 1st sip reveals the dry citrus character with a hint of spice and quite a bit of alcohol. Moutfeel is tingly, and there' a dry finish with a good bit of alcohol heat. It's drinkable, but not sessionable...the alcohol is just too hot to have more than one or two. All-in-all, this is not the best tripel i've ever had. Also, not my favorite offering from Victory."
"D- The alcohol began to effect me quickly. There is some residual stickiness, but other than that this is fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very strong brew, drank on recommendation of a friend because of the ABV but was very surprised at the let down. The alchol is noticeable and a minor hurdle. I guess i could palate this some times, but prefer others over it..plus the 1st one i drank had me crooked, then asleep afterward."
"Drinkability: This is a beast of a Tripel. The beer is quite yummy, but it packs enough of a punch that I wouldn't (and probably shouldn't) have more than 1 in a sitting."
"I just don't like the style of this beer. I'm overwhelmed by the yeast and phenolic flavors."
"Nice for the finish of a hot afternoon and definitely shareable."
"D- A tasty beer that drinks better than most 9.5% ABV beers. A unique taste on the style."
"D - surprisingly drinkable for this high of alcohol content. It easy to drink down a few of these with out noticing."
"Drinkability: While it's not bad overall, the rotted grassiness kills this one for me. Typicall I find myself really enjoying these styles but this one did not translate overly well for me. I will still continue to try beers from Victory though as they've done pretty well for me overall."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn high, but not really the best example of style."
"All told, it's just decent I suppose...but the alcohol started giving me heartburn about halfway through and I just had to quit drinking it. Just too astringent."
"Good beer. I would buy it again"
"D: This is a relatively drinkable beer if not for the alcohol's insistence on being the star of the show. I like Victory and Tripels in general, so I'd probably buy this again. Overall it's not their best offering though."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, I'm glad I tried it, and I have 3 more in the 12 pack so I'll get another chance. If I'm in the mood for a tripel, this would not be my first, second or third choice, but the hop bite adds something new here and there is certainly more to like than not. Decent solid beer...yes. Will I seek it out again, no."
"The 9.5% was a bit much but had no problem downing one sitting on my porch watching the world pass by."
"review #999 for Golden Monkey...fyi"
"Taste: Hops provide a mellow but lingering bitterness. Nice spiciness from the yeast. Alcohol provides only a little bit of warmth, but is otherwise undetectable. Malt doesn't add a whole lot of taste, just some sweetness."
"creamy mouthfeel in the begining that turns dry in the finish. good carbonation. pretty good american tripel, but not my favorite. ive bought this a couple times and have one aging in the cellar."
"Kind of a clear, tinkley golden. Nothing at all in the way of sediment, almost completely transparent. A lot thinner than I remember, also, almost like a golden vinegar. Smells like a sweet barnyard, a bit of harshness that is also enhanced by a very boozey smell. I do love the smell, though. Taste is... complicated. This is not a by-the-book tripel, the guys from Victory are trying to throw as much at you as possible. It is sweet and very syrupy despite the thin appearance. Has kind of a honey texture or smoothness behind it, and you can tell it tastes a bit nutty. As it warms, there's a good bit of sharp spicing that becomes more and more prevalent. A bit earthy, a bit cough syrupy, and a huge alcoholic bite. It's pretty boozey, and can make for a tough drink. There's a ton of flavours, but they don't always do the best job of melding all together. It is pretty crisp though, carbonation is a little on the low side but it fits pretty well. Basically, this is a bastard Americanized tripel. It is interesting, but not the most true to style, and very busy. I have a soft spot for it, though."
"Drinkability- scarily drink able and delicious, long crispy refreshing finish, alcohol is extremely hidden and the beer is fine american example of the style, a good beer and one that i will definitely be trying again, great value for the price check it out"
"Had this at the Philly airport. It poured a fair golden color, just slightly hazy, with a thin white head and almost o lacing. Smelled spicy with some fruity undertones. Tasted similar, some different fruit tastes (fig, plum?), and a little sweet. A little bit overcarbed but otherwise smooth. I could easily have put a few more back had I not wanted to try some other beers in the vicinity."
"This is a great Tripel and one of my favorite Victory brews. Tons of flavor to sample and way too easy to enjoy."
"Overall -- not a bad beer. There are better tripels to be found (most definitely from Belgium), but for an American ""try"" -- not too bad. The alcohol really shows on the nose and palate and overwhelms what could be a great beer. I definitely couldn't have more than one (God forbid I ever try...). Victory usually does great stuff, but this is a little over-done. A simple decrease in alcohol from 9.5% to maybe 8% or 8.5%, would make a world of difference."
"d: a little too drinkable for a 9.5% tripel the sweetness hides the booze very well"
"I have to admit I am a fan of this style, one of the better of the Belgians. However, I feel this beer somewhat misses the mark. The body is good, with a big yeast and hop profile and close to 10% alcohol. The aroma is clove and banana ester, with some flowers from the hops. I think this beer has too much bitterness. Why not let the yeast run free? Dial back the bitterness and maybe some of those wonderful banana esters will come out in the flavor, not just the aroma. All in all, this beer is good. Enjoy it as you would a big, young chardonnay. I really hope they'll tweak this brew a bit in the future... could be a great one."
"D - Drinkable tripel, while not totally to style. A good, solid beer but not the best example of the style. Definitely worth a try though, if available to you."
"This one's got a kick to it, and that ABV's going to hold down the drinkability. It's also not exactly to style, so take it as you will."
"Fairly easy drinking, this is very solid for a 12oz tripel. It hides the 9.5% fairly well, and has a good enough complexity to leave you wanting more."
"A 750ml corked bottle poured into my Selin's Grove chalice. Bottled on May 12th, 2006. The monkey appears a hazy bright golden straw color with about a finger of quickly fading bone white foam. Aroma consists of bananas, clove, tart green apples, sweet malts. Tastes of toasted wheat bread slathered with orange marmalade, spicy, peppery yeast, mild banana, more sweet than bitter. At over 3 years in the bottle, the alcohol has become quite tamed down. Carbonation is rather high, bubbly, tingling. Crisp and dry with a somewhat oily finish. The monkey shines with a little age on it."
"Overall - A top notch Belgian Tripel... recommended..."
"D - A little too spicy and hoppy for me to have more than 1. The ABV limits its use as a session beer."
"Medium body, rich, smooth, drinkability takes a hit due to the richness, but it has really good carbonation to it. Overall a really good brew."
"D - Man, I've had a hard time rating this beer. Stylistically, it's far from the exceptional Belgian tripels such as Westmalle and Karmeliet, but on it's own it's a fucking fantastic beer. The ""brewed with spices"" on the label had me weary at first, but this is an extremely well constructed beer and by far one of, if not the best, offering from Victory I've had thus far."
"All in all, this is one of the better American tripels that I've had. It's pretty sweet, but it's also pretty damned tasty. It's no Allagash, but it's also only $5.99 for a 750 ml. This is one hell of a budget tripel. Victory has quickly become one of my staple breweries."
"Future outlook: This was a decent beer, but other clearly better, easily accessible, reasonably priced alternatives would prevent me from buying this regularly."
" totally able to stand up without it."
"Mouthfeel was crisp with high carbonation. Very drinkable, I'd have a few more. Decent beer with a good flavor profile."
"I'll have another, someday."
"Very easy to drink a few of these even with a higher ABV, also quite refreshing."
"A decent triple but not great. Nice cloudy gold-straw color, but poor head retention. A pleasant floral and spicy aroma, and a taste that starts nice but ends up too cloyingly sweet, in my opinion. I've had better triples, and this one is fine and drinkable, maybe just a bit below average."
"This is one of the better American Tripels I have had. Something I would highly recommend."
"Final thoughts: A very pleasent, drinkable, fun beer. Very refreshing, fruity tasty beer. A little pricey but im assuming its cause of the alcohol. Price went down id purchase more. TRY IT"
"Cloudy gold in color with no real head to speak of when I poured it into a pint glass. It is brewed with spices as proclaimed by the brewers. This is obvious through the nose and the flavor. The nose has a character like a milder version of a winter warmer. The attack is thick and malty. The flavor is ripe with cloves and spices. The finish is very confusing as there are myriad flavors swirling around and seemingly intertwining with components of the mouthfeel. Some probably hail the beer as ""complex"" and I just can't help but feel it is too busy. Most brewers I prefer the bigger and bolder offerings, but as for Victory I do recall being a fan of the Hop devil and Victory pils which means they go completely against the grain for me. While I am not disappointed to have tried this beer, I will not buy it again. As a matter of fact I have been pawning them off on guests because I don't care to drink the other 5. I feel like Simon Cowell. . . sorry."
"A cloudy golden yellow color pour with a 3 finger full white head. Aroma is very nice a grainy,yeasty,spicy mixture that begs you to take a drink. Flavor is more complex than I had expected, quite malty,slightly sweet,wheaty,a big spicy profile of clove, ginger, corriander,and peppercorns,some bananna and a hint of lemon peel, a dry,grainy crisp mouthfeel,with a long dry finish,very tasty"
"Drinkability: This beer is great to session when out in the heat - Great refreshing beer on steroids - 9.0 %!"
"D - Drinkability would have to be low considering the high alcohol taste."
"This beer reminds me of a Belgium white. I'm assuming that is a good result for the tripel beverage. It's my 1st victory beer of the night, I'd like to maybe try it again as my 1st beverage. Right now I'll say it's average, slightly above. Hints of banana esters. Golden monkey?"
"Medium body, nice coating. Not my favorite, but I'm not a huge fan of tripels."
"D - The alcohol isn't masked in this but it warms your throat on the way down and has a nice soothing effect. The ABV would keep me from having many of these but overall, I'd say this has average drinkability."
"D- id say not hard to do"
"I could drink quite a few of these, overall it is not an amazing example of the style, but it is a good beer to try."
"Final Thoughts - A decent entry into the world of Tripels. Not my favorite of the style but a good effort for Victory. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I can't really call this more than a decent Tripel. I'd prefer it were a bit maltier and spicer. As it stands, it comes across as too watery and alcoholic for my taste. Certainly not bad, and easy to drink, but a tripel should be something to sip and savor, and this doesn't quite meet that goal."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy golden-orange color with a full three-fingers of beige head. The retention was ok as a thin skim and the lacing consistent. The aroma was on-point for a Tripel, Belgian yeast, fruity esters, alcohol, sweet malts, bready malt, floral hops and spices. The flavors were equally complex, starting with citrusy hops it then went into spices, lots of fruity esters, the 'twang' of yeast, sour green apples, pears, caramel malt and towards the end it got a little nippy with a clear alcohol note that left a slick on my tongue. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium. A good example of the style being produced on this side of the pond."
"Drinkability: This is 9.5%? Wow, that's scary."
"Drinkability: This could be a dangerous one, I found myself getting a bit carried away and take extra large gulps of this, simply for the fact that it is easily quaffible, but don't let this fool you, this is a beer that disguises the ABV so well that you could over-indulge and might end up on the wrong end of the alcohol stick. Not a huge fan of Belgians but I found this refreshing and pretty modest. Stick with 1 or 2 in a session."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a slighty hazy golden color with a half finger of head that quickly disappears. Smell is bananas, bananas, bananas. Taste is bananas and clove. Fairly consistent taste with most other average/above average tripels. Light-medium mouthfeel that drys the tongue. Decent drinkabilty for a tripel. Good for its style but not in the league of La Fin Du Monde or Schlaflys Tripel."
"Watch out, very drinkable, 2 or 3 in a drinking session is about right. If you can make it to the restaurant in Downingtown, they limit you to only 2 of these. ENJOY!"
"D: Very drinkable, but god damn this stuff is strong. After one 12oz bottle I'm feeling the buzz. I'm not complaining or anything, but I think if I were going to spend the night drinking this I'd have to plan on having someone carry me to my bed."
"Overall Impression: I enjoyed this beer very much. The fruitiness and the lightness in body make this an easy beer to drink. The 9.5% ABV adds the danger, I can see limiting myself to 1 or 2 when out, or just staying home and drinking a few more than 2."
"Not a prime example of the style but a solid brew especially for the price"
"Had this on tap at the Houston Flying Saucer. Poured in a tulip glass. Bright orange color. Smell of mostly clove and banana. Spicy in taste with lots of coriander, orange, and some clove. Very easy to drink with a smooth finish. I rather enjoyed this beer. Will definately try it again."
"D: Too much ABV to drink all night, but drinkable enough to drink more than you probably should."
"Drinkability- High ABV is the only thing holding this back from being a decent session beer."
"Poured into Duvel glass with very little head. Quite disappointed actually. Shimmers with golden hues. Smells floral, bit of caramel and bread crust coming through, overall a bit subdued. The taste is quite good. Nice bit of hops of front blending into caramel/vegetal. Nice bit of spice with this. Had this with pasta and heavy spice, worked out quite well. This one goes down quite smooth, mouthfeel is light if not a bit carbonated. High ABV will put you down as I didn't get much alcohol taste here. Good beer, not great for the style though."
"Drinkability: A solid well made tripel. I'll be having more of this in the future as it is part of the Victory Variety case sold in PA, a choice that I for one applaud."
"The only downside is that I am, almost, completely worthless the day following consumption. And yes its happening again. Drink with caution and have nothing strenuous planned mentally or otherwise. Putting on my sweatpants correctly followed by successfully microwaving a pizza is the best possible outcome for tomorrow."
"Poured a cloudy orange with inch thick head. You can smell the yeasty spicy belgian sweetness. Taste is sweet, floral, spicy clove and warm alcohol. Could really parse through all of the differnt flavors. The clove spice mixes well with the high carbonation tingle and alcohol to create a good bite. The flavor does last a long time and shows up stronger and stronger after the initial taste. Very tasty and there is a stong alcohol flavor that sticks around. Very smooth mouthfeel."
"D- this one tastes green. it could use some time in the cellar to reduce the spiciness and alcohol burn, and let the malt's tastes come through a little more. one is enough for this one right now. not victory's finest."
"D- Pretty drinkable for the ABV...not the best tripel that I have had, but still a quality beer...I know that the spicy flavor is not for everyone, but I enjoy it"
"D-Moderate to high. Quite complex and enjoyable, along with being easy to drink, despite the higher ABV."
"Drinkability: I am not a big fan of many tripels and this beer embodies a number of things I don't like about the style; way too hot and sweet, with a lack of balance; to some, this may be a classic tripel and I can understand their perspective; it is just not the interpretation of the style that I prefer"
"Overall, this just isn't a great beer. The only difference between this time and last is that now I understand what it is I don't like about it."
"Could get a case of this, very nice."
"D- Very good. A respectable offering from an American brewery. I've had better Trippels but I also paid considerably more for them."
"Drinkability- Pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to locate."
"Drank fine, good amount of ABV, so just had a 12oz. An enjoyable beer, just disheartened by the looks and waste due to over-foaming"
"A decent brew wrecked by some weird finish. Don't know what's going on but the bottle seems fine every other way."
"Prickly carbonation - which is strong - gives way to some creaminess. Although the alcohol plays well as a part of the taste profile, it is too evident to make this that drinkable."
"An OK brew from Victory. I haven't been too hot for Victory after trying a number of their issues, but I thought I'd give this one a try. Seems to be their headliner. Two words come to mind right away after first sip: spice notes. Very spicy beer. It's good but not as good as an Allagash White or a La Fin du Monde. There's something a little off in the spice composition. Good if you're looking for something spicy and different, but I'm not buying again."
"D: good for such a strong beer, very subtle for a spiced strong belgian. I would like to drink more, but I think that would be dangerous."
"D: Got better as it warmed, which is it's saving grace and why it's above average. I would still have it again, but I wouldn't necessarily go looking for it."
"D- Not so much, the high ABV does not scare me, it's just that GM is difficult to drink. A nice warming from the heat on this cold snowy day so GM has that going for it. This seems to be pretty popular on the whole but it is not for me. So maybe I'm missing something?!?? I will try this again in another 4 years to again, see what's what."
"Cool bottle though."
"Overall I don't think the Golden Monkey is really worth drinking with the ABV. I usually like Victory's beer, but I really haven't liked drinking the it in the three or four times that I've had it."
"A nice drinker and a good representitive of a Triple. High ABV does not make this a session beer."
"This is a bit more fizzy than I was hoping for but interesting flavors to say the least. Not an instant classic but still worth mentioning."
"I don't have a problem with the lack of complexity in this beer (relative to other Belgian tripels): I'm ok with a simple tripel. What bugs me is the lack of any real lingering flavors. All the flavors seem to come and go without leaving a lasting imperssion."
"Definitely easy to drink, which could spell bad news for the unsuspecting drinker. The 9.5% ABV could easily catch up to you after a few of these. Still a good beer, just not one of my favorites."
"Poured an apple-juice orange from the bottle with very little head resulting from an aggressive pour. The smell and taste are also full of apple on top of a pleasant tripel funk. In the finish is sugary malt, caramel, and light hops. The beer is medium-bodied and finishes dry. While the alcohol doesn't come through -too- much in the taste, I felt it to some extent. Overall, I enjoyed Golden Monkey more and more as I sipped on it."
"2.5 D: Easily the worst tripel I've ever had. What the hell is Victory doing? All of their other beers have been great or better."
"D - Rather harsh considering the lingering taste and heavy alcohol notes. Only 2 of these max."
"Drinkability - A good beer that goes down easily. The profile is hardly complex, but friendly. A bit over-hyped, but not a failure."
"EDIT: It's growing on me the more often I try it. Not bad stuff..."
"Note- I planned on giving Victory a pass on the carbonation issue, but almost every review on the front page mentioned the light amount of carbonation in their own, fresh bottles. If this had been a side effect of the aging of the beer, I wouldn't have marked down for it, but it seems to be more a side effect of the beer itself. Also, for the record, between my wife and myself, we didn't make it through a full half of the bottle before we DP'd it."
"Not big on this brew."
"When Golden Monkey is poured a nice centimeter head appears, but quickly dissipates to a ring with some foam in the middle. Golden Monkey has an orange tint with a bit of yellow shining through. Tons of esters come through, some citrus and spicy yeast notes also come through, and there is also a slight bit of bready yeast character. While drinking this beer a huge carbonation bite hints your tongue, but a quite smooth estery flavour comes through; however, there is a bit of alcohol warmth coming through at the end, which is to be expected. While lingering around in my mouth, I get a lot of a fruity flavours; oranges and almost an apricot flavour are the most prevalent. Only a bit of Phenolic characters come through though, and there also isn't much malt to the beer. The mouthfeel is exactly where it should be; the beer isn't outstanding, but a solid example of a tripel."
"Thanks to Shawn for sharing!"
"Excellent drinkability,"
"Drinkability: I think this is one of those beers where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, it was enjoyable. It was not your typical tripel, and felt almost like a champagne. It's a beer I'd have to be in the mood to drink."
"A definite sipper; sadly, I was forced to down this rather quickly. Alcohol is formidable, and there's a bit too much going on to make the beer fully drinkable, but for a nice take on the style, this is certainly a good pick."
"Overall: This is a decent interpretation of a triple and seeing as I'm not that big of a Victory fan (or a tripel fan for that matter) I'm surprised that their Belgian style ale turned out to be one of my favorite offerings from them."
"I was very excited to try this beer. I heard some good reviews and was told it had the price tag to go along with it. After trying it I was let down. The taste was very bold but muddy. The flavors sort of jumbled together. I struggled to finish the bottle. It could just be my palate, but this one will go in the ""once is enough"" category."
"A decent tripel, doesn't compare to the monastaries. The funkiness in the aroma wasn't very pleasant and i thought the clove was a little heavy in this beer. Nonetheless, a solid effort."
"D - Very low considering I have all of the other Victory Hop and Stout beers to choose from. Also, with 9.5%, give me an imperial stout any day. No question asked. This review will remind me to always stay away from the fat monkey."
"This is a very herbaly spiced beer. The Apperance is a very golden sunlight color. The taste is of a traditional german malt with whole flower european hops with definate tones of yeast of a belgian orgin. There are also sutble aftertones of peppermint and exotic worldly spices from the far corners of the earth. It has a very delicate mouthfeel, lets leave it at that. The overall drinkability is sub par. I like other vitory beersz better."
"(D) A decent, well flavored Tripel. If I had another I'd pass it along."
"D: This is a good solid Belgian style.. the high Alc % doesn't cut through the flavor, and it has just the right balance of sweet, and bitter. I Raise my glass!"
"I would say this is a tripel of my liking- yeasty and sweet."
"Poured golden with a large, active head. Aroma is soapy and astringent (but good). Flavor is laced with a subtle pepper component. The lingering flavor is a sourness across the roof of the throat. This beer drinks very easily considering the ABV."
"The glowing yellow to light orange color allows the thin, yet active, bubble beads to be viewed with ease, two finger white head upon the pour takes its time fading off. Sweet cinnamon, ginger, clove, anise, cumin spices build through the nose, lively tangerine and lemon zest, suggestions of apricot and peach fruit, alert for the weight it possesses in the nostrils, grips well. Medium to full-bodied, the carbonated fizz teams up with the sweet baking spices for a zesty attack, creates a fetching inner mouth perfume. The lemon, orange citrus entirely in place, much hoppier here in the mouth so fewer fruit flavors. Yet, breadiness and honey glaze directly expressed. Cleans up adequately after itself while leaving sufficient residue to reverb for some time. As far as spiced ale goes, balanced and not pushy."
"pours a golden cloudy color with alot of particulates,also very thick white heading. An immediate smell of hops and alot of it a decent amount of honey also. With the 9.5% ABV you can't really taste too much of it. The hoppiness a bit overpowering for me but all and all a good brew."
"Has a sligtly sweet taste with a bitterness towards the end with alcohol noted. Feels smooth on the palate with moderate carbonation and could easily put down a couple of these in one sitting. Overall a decent tripel and worth trying."
"Drinkability is too good for the abv. I could easily have a few of these before they hit."
"This beer is drinkable, but after one I'm probably done. Definitely moving on after two. Alcohol shines through and it's a bit sweet for my tastes."
"D-Easy to drink but be careful with the abv,it can sneak up on you.The smell reminds me more of a wit or a hefe,but otherwise no complaints."
"For a triple, it almost delivers. Not a bad beer, but can do a lot better in the triple family."
"After 2 of these, I will switch to regular beer, as I don't want to get totally trashed."
"D - A nice sipper which I like, but compared to other triples it really lacks in some areas and has a bit too much alcohol presence."
"Drinkability..I probably would skip this one in my next round. It goes down smooth but becomes too boozy after a few sips."
"The feel is creamy on the palate, but fizzy like champagne. Damn nice overall. A fine example of a Belgian tripel. Balanced bitter/sweet/sour/spicy. Real nice."
"This is fairly drinkable, none of the tastes are overpowering and it is a well brewed beer."
"Poured golden and cloudy with a head that dissipated quickly. I really enjoyed the smell of bananas and cloves and was excited to taste. Slightly disappointed after the smell and appearance. It started fruity and ended mildly spicy. The carbonation wasn't overwhelming. I could have two of these and probably need a nap if I drank them to quickly based on the abv."
"D - Not bad, I just don't think the aroma/flavors blend well."
"Overall - A good representation of the style. Well spiced and tasty. I must admit that the aroma was more attractive than the taste but still, a very good beer. I have a 750mL bottle in the cellar that I'm eager to meet again in a few years. Note: does NOT pair well with Bagel Bites, pizza, or Cheez-Its. Don't worry, I finished the review before trying it with food."
"(rated Feb 28, 2007)"
"D. Its high alcohol content makes it less drinkable but otherwise nothing preventing me from having another."
"A superb brewery but not a style that have got on target yet."
"NOTES: BBCSD-E2"
"Interesting tripel. Pours gold with some floaties and a fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is spicey banana with strong yeast. The first sip threw me. Yeast and spice up front followed by the strong taste of grapes. This faded into a mellower bubblegum flavor as the beer warmed. Heavier mouthfeel than I wanted, but overall a very nice tripel."
"Smell was kind of fruit aand maybe floral. Same with the taste. IT really surprised me that this is a tripel."
"Even though this beer lacks the ""wow"" factor of its Belgian counterparts, it's still pretty solid and worth checking out."
"Drinkability is good, this is a pretty tripel, and time has served it well. To bad I didn't have the patience to age it another year, it would only be that much better I'm sure!"
"Drinkability: This bomber should be shared amongst friends, split at dinner. Two people can easily finish this together, or one determined person alone."
"Pours a golden yellow color body, with a good sized head. Has an aroma of flowers, some perfume, and some alcohol in the nose. A nice taste of flowers, some raisin, fizzy palate, and a medium-strong alcohol taste."
"Reviewed 3/29/08. Bottle. Poured a mango orange with a small white head. Aroma of citrus fruits, mango, cantelope. Taste of the same fruits, some spices, finish of bitter rind. Heavy mouthfeel for a tripel. Ehh, I just didn't really like this one. The flavors didn't mesh together very well. 7/4/5/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"Pours golden with a quicky dissipating white head. Aroma is very spicy with hints of yeast and citrus. The golden flavor of this beer is beautifully balanced with a generous amount of spices and hint of hops. Very underated tripel from Victory. I loved this beer a lot more when I first sampled it."
"Firm on the palate, it is not nearly as sweet as the nose suggested; although fruity and candy like notes abound, alcohol and a bitter bite come and go to provide some balance. It lacks depth, and over time the sweet stuff just overpowers. I am a big fan of both sweet beers (which this one was not supposed to be)and belgian style ales, unfortunately this one does not please me a lot on either aspect."
"Have fun."
"Overall, this brew is much more well-balanced than the young version, but I really miss the esters. I think I really love Victory's off-balance brews: they bring certain great flavors to the forefront. While the aged Golden Monkey is quite great (rivaling many Belgian Trippels I've had), it's not the same as the crazy young beer that got me into Belgians to begin with."
"Overall: Horrible. One of the worst beers I have ever consumed. I had to pour the remaining third of the beer down the drain and rinse my repeatedly with the closest beer I could find. I will never buy this one again."
"This stuff is strong, real strong. Drink responsibly. I have a buddy who drank four of them in a night without remembering they were 9% and he ended up in bad shape. Drinker beware."
"Poured into a 12oz glass from the bottle forming a cream colored head over a yellow-gold body, very slight haze and a good bit of visible carbonation. The head disipates to a thin cap on the top of the beer that nicely laces the glass. The smell is quite sweet and somewhat alcoholic in nature, too damn complex for me to describe, maybe grains and sugar and nutmeg??? The taste is equally complicated, malt up front then a light floral hops taste with an overall spice bite with a light alcohol presence. Hell, let's make this simple, it tastes and smells real good. It's real creamy too, slightly dry finish with a sweet aftertaste. I think this is a very easy drinking beverage but the high ABV kicks it out of session beer category most of the time. Sayonara!"
"Flavors are alright, ultra sweet juicyfruit gum, drying alcohol in the finish. Body is mellow and carbonation is low. Mild astringency, some floral aspect to the aftertaste. Overall it's not bad, just not something I would return to."
"Very drinkable. This is a great beer to have when starting to investigate the Belgian styles. I'm not saying it's as good as some of the classics, but it's very interesting and a nice introduction to the style."
"Mouthfeel is very clean and goes down very easy. Maybe a little too easy for a 9.5%."
"A very big beer, and not as typically clear and refined as true Belgian tripels. A good beer, but not one for the light-hearted."
"Taste is very much a liquid profile of the smell. Sweet, fruity, slightly grassy.Overall, too sweet for my taste. Really lacking in the Belgian spiciness and yeasty complexity. This is what happens when American do a ""Belgian Style""---Belgian without Belgian complexity--good, but not graet. If you are new to Triples, definately try this one. If you can appreciate the finer points of Westmalle Triple or De Dolle Du Teve---stick to what you know"
"The taste is not a pleasant one, I had a couple of more sips just to make sure it was as bad as I had remembered. IT WAS, I am an admitted IPA, and stout fan, this wheat beer is simply not good. I will not buy this beer ever again, but I will be back to Victory for plenty of the Prima Pills, and Hop Devil!"
"An interesting beer but not my favorite Ameri-Belgian brew. Victory's other beers are full of flavor and delicious, this one is just a little funky and boozy. Go for Hop Devil instead!"
"A very enjoyable beer, quite an unusual balance even though the sweetness kind of takes over about half way through. Deceptively high abv makes you think twice about having too many."
"Good beer, although I think some aging will do it wonders!"
"D-Careful with this one. Victory is known, or should be, for making high ABV beers that sneak up on you."
"Drinkability- Very good, could sit back and hammer of few of these, which could be dangerous considering the abv."
"Victory has arrived in Maine, and I am very happy to see it. This beer is a great tripel. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass, the beer was a hazy orange color with a medium-sized white head. It had a fruity (banana) and spicy (clove) aroma. Fruit and spice in the taste, some biscuity malt. Warming alcohol. A very smooth, drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink more of the 6 pack, but stopped after two."
"This is one beer which is always on my to buy list. It many ways reminds me of the Degarre in Bruges."
"Well do it again, but next time, I'll buy the whole six instead of a single. Pretty strong stuff, so I'm not sure I'd have more than two 12ozs at a time."
"D- Too spicy to be chuggable but it is very pleasant in slow consumption"
"The first Belgian I ever tried.. a pretty good one too. Now that I've had others I see it isn't the best interpretation but it's still very good. Very spicy.. I mean like, super spicy. This will turn off a lot of people but I thought it was a good flavor. The taste did seem to vary by bottle but for the most part it was a flavorful beer that really warmed you up."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass"
"D - At 9.5 it's pretty potent, I enjoyed two of them and was very happy. The taste of cinnamon stopped me from having a third."
" The drinkability of this 9% brew is scary, it is easy to polish of three bottles but you better not drive home after!! (trust me) Take your time and really enjoy this one."
"This is a drinkable beer, with complex and appealing aromas and flavors. The flavors are very well balanced. The ABV is a bit high to be sessionable, but a couple at a time is nice."
"There is plenty to taste, just not that great of a taste. There are better tripels, but def. worth a try."
"Clear golden color with a nice white head that stuck around. Smelled of... everything!.. citrus, spices, hops, and earthy malts. There was literally pupl floating the the beer. The taste broke free of of the smell, with and upfront sweetness followed by smooth finish. My friend put it best and I completely agree with him, he said,"a slight malty hefeweizen taste with a clean smooth spice finish."" Bottom line, try it, this a good fackin' beer."
"Not the best tripel I've had but it's certainly worthy of a try. I probably wouldn't get it again, but I would recommend giving it a shot."
"D: High ABV not well-disguised. Unique tripel as its malt and yeast flavors not as complex as some but still interesting."
"Poured into a pint glass. Bottle was marked ""Best by May 2011."" Pours a light blonde with little carbonation. A moderate head that fades quickly. A bit of lacing that hangs on for a while. Smells of cloves and spice with a hint of citrus. Not a very powerful aroma. Light bodied with a touch of fizziness. Not a very strong taste for a tripwl, but well balanced. I'm surprised to see this is 9.5% abv. I don't taste the alcohol at all. Drinks well but I've certainly had better tripels. I'd buy this again though."
"From a bottle marked: BOTTLED Mar 15 07. Poured with a medium head and a little lace. Some precipitate in suspension. Color of polished brass. Aroma of bread dough, yeast, crackers, and a little spice. Flavor is sweet overall but bitter highlights. Good carbonation and body. Boozy going down. Warm finsih. Good effort for the style."
"Drinkability is average at best. when finishing the Golden Monkey it does not ask you coming back for more. Not bad."
"The slightly over-carbonated character of this beer is apparent upon first pour, as it produced a thick but quickly dissipating bubbly head that overflows if you're not careful. This Belgian-style spiced Tripel ale is yellowish rather than golden as the name implies. Cloudy from the sediment, this unfiltered brew is modestly appealing to the eye. The nose is very assertive, drawing your attention and anticipation. This is a complex ale, with a wave of gustatory impressions parading across your palate as you slowly draw it in, which is the only way to drink such a robust brew. For a tripel, the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but bites a bit from the carbonation. The sweetness and spice follow all the way to the finish, but graciously step aside to leave a nice bitter after. The strong spicy flavor combined with the nearly 10% ABV keep this off the most-drinkable list, but it's a nice brew for cool weather."
"It's not a bad beer, per se; it's just a little boring. I could have a few of these, though I wouldn't recommend too many since I'm sure this beer could wreck you pretty quick."
"mouth feel is good. very smooth. not a whole lot of carbonation. nice flavor, very drinkable. a very good beer for a hot summer day/night. i would say this is worth a shot"
"The drinkability of this brew is fairly smooth but with the amount of alcohol in it, I don't reccommend drinking more than a six pack."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body. Mild carbonation and a bit of a alcohol zip."
"D: This is one smooth, easy drinking brew."
"Drinkability: A pretty disappointing tripel, and one I should perhaps give another try to at a place other than McGrady's Irish Pub (not the best location for keg quality control, from past experience). Seems like a lot what makes a tripel a tripel was absent, and a lot of notes that seemed, while not bad, definitely out of place. All that being said, the 9.5% abv was very well hidden amidst all that malt sweetness, so I do give 'em some credit for that."
"This is a great beer to be sipped on a cool fall night."
"A decent 'American' tripel that is a bit lacking in body and feel compared to the stalwarts of the style."
"Good beer but disappointed. I was hoping for more from it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As said before this has a dry finish. Body is light with delicate carbonation that suit the beer. This isn't one that I'd be quick to pick up again, it just doesn't do it for me in the way of tripels. Nothing really special about it."
"Overall a very good, high ABV beer. I've enjoyed a six-pack on multiple occasions."
"Very carbonated mouthfeel that burns the tongue a bit. Pretty good drinkability."
"Grabbed a few of these in a recent mix sixer. This tripel pours a radiant golden hue, with a big fat head that didn't last as long as I would have liked. Smell is sweet candy, with a heavy spicy floral note as well. A strong yeast element hints at something bigger ahead. The taste is again sweet Belgian candy, with hints of honey induced sweetness as well. The yeast comes through here as well. Along with the 9.5% alcohol it almost starts to burn a bit. Mouthfeel was almost a bit cloying. In the end I really enjoyed this beer and would like to see it in my local store again some day."
"Pours a golden color with a thick head that dissipates rather quickly. Well-carbonated and slightly hazy. Smell is spicy with some mustiness. Taste is peppery with some mild fruitiness. Lightbodied and easy to drink. Barely notice the alcohol in this one. A solid beer."
"D: Good drinkable beer but in my opinion not one of Victory's best offerings."
"Drinkability: Having heard so much about Victory in general and this brew in particular, I was expecting something a little more. The flavors don't seem to blend well, and there are several which I would not normally associate with this style. Not bad, but I'll stick to some of the other brewers for Belgian ales."
"Still one of my sentimental faves and one of the absolute best values around. I still go back to the Monkey every few weeks."
"Six 12oz bottles purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston for $13. Best before date of February 2011. Pours a nice cloudy gold with a fluffy white head and lots of carbonation. Light wheaty, lemony aroma that wouldn't be out of place for a witbier. First sensation is a tangy mouthfeel from the carbonation and some light spices. Some bubblegum flavours with the yeast. Medium to full bodied, and a bit hot going down the throat. This one didn't stand out in a rash of similar tripels I've had lately."
"Better on tap, but very good all around."
"Golden Monkey is a pretty good display of the tripel style. I have had tripels that I loathed before, and I must say this one is pretty enjoyable. The aroma and flavor are both very tripel-like. The spice is present, but not overbearing. Aroma has a bit of banana, as well as orange creamsicle, a bit of orange peel, and a bit of wheat. These carry over to the taste, citrusy orange, lemon zest, wheat, and some sweet maltyness that is present in the back of your throat. Mouth ahs a lot of carbonation and a light to moderate body. A crisp bite and the flavor sets in as it moves over your tongue leaving a faint, sweet aftertaste. It definitely excited all of your taste buds. Pours an amber-yellow with a thin frothy white head. Easily drinkable, and, again, a nice display of tripel style"
"M/D - Light to medium bodied. Alcohol is not string in the taste at all but you can quickly feel it hit you."
"Interesting brew that packs a punch, but the smell is chemically and really turned me off."
"D - Pretty decent tripel"
"I still am not quite sure what to make of this beer even after I have finished it. Poured a surprisingly rich golden color. This beer appeared somewhat dense as the carbonation slowly made its way up to a nice frothy head that left good lacing. The aroma is very complex with scents of banana, clove, pepper, and sweet malts. The alcohol could also be detected easily by the nose, which is no surprise since this tripel boasts a sturdy 9.5% abv. Crisp mouthfeel but nothing out of the ordinary. The flavor was an intense concentrated version of the aroma that was given off. Overall I can't say this is a great beer and I can't say I hated it either. I don't think the overall flavor is quite my style but It is interesting to say the least and worth a try. The funny thing is that my insides are still warm all over from this one."
"D: this is a 1 or 2 beer due to its high abv and strange after taste"
"T/M/D - bready, powdery yeast taste, with a good wallop of candy sugar. It finishes nicely, and the alcohol is apparent. This a pretty good beer, but I find it a touch on the ordinary side when compared to some of its Belgian brethren (Karmeliet comes to mind as a good benchmark)."
"this is a solid beer that suffers only when compared to the many stellar brews in it's style. Appearance is average. Nose is where it begins too fall short. Very little scent outside of a vague floral aroma. Taste is heavy on alcohol, light on spice. Nonetheless a very refreshing, surprisingly drinkable (for as blatantly string as it is)"
"D: Such a high ABV, makes it a non-session beer. Overall, I enjoy the spicy wheat flavoring, but the taste of alochol was too apparent."
"D-Decent considering the ABV"
"I found the flavor of this beer interesting but ultimately unsatisfying. Just didn't hang together for me. Too strong and too light. I don't know. I need to try more tripels and understand them better. For me, the golden monkey is not worth it for the price. I am much more a fan of Victory's HopDevil and Prima Pils."
"Ordered at Flying Saucer in Austin. Served with no head, but the color is pretty...orangish gold. Sweet and alcoholic smelling, not bad, just strong. Tasty ""tripel"" flavor. Fizzy as it hits the tongue and zesty going down. I am liking this beer, but it is quite strong and could effect the overall drinkability. A nice tripel to sit back and take your time with."
"Poured an attractice, hazy, thick, golden color, but with a bit of a small, dull head. The smell was pleasant: plenty of sweetness, with orange, honey, maybe even some berries in there, plus yeast, spice, bready notes, and a touch of light hops. I was excited to give it a try, but the taste dissapointed. There was the usual cast of character: the yeast, orange peel, banana, pale malts. But the tastes that I took away from the beer were the alcohol and the sweetness. The beer did not do a good job of masking the alcohol, making it as the dominant flavor, leaving a dry, metallic aftertaste in my mouth with each sip. If anything, they tried to mask it with sugary and fruity flavors, but the beer just came off as syrupy, especially with its pseudo-thick mouthfeel. I usually enjoy triples, and I think that there are plenty of better examples of this beer out there."
"Serving type: bottle"
"At the end of the day, this is a beer I would love to keep in the fridge regularly."
"Taste is overly strong for what I consider a good tripel. Strong in every respect but especially alcohol. I feel that this is a perfect example of how ""americanizing"" a classic european style goes too far. It's too dark, too strong, and it loses the delicate nature of the style in the process."
"Poured in a ripply bottomed wine glass, because I cracked 2 Duvel tullips in the dishwasher. Pours somewhat smooth with a foamy white head and orange/copperish body, think the color of orange sucker at the doctor's office. Smell = orange peel, grapefruit, vanilla extract, clove, and nutmeg. Taste = pear, light caramel, light citrus, butterscotch, and pudgent spice. As you let the beer sit in your mouth you can feel and taste the alcohol warm the sides of you gums. Your cheeks will tingle after you take a swish and swig. I am a huge fan of Belg. style Tripels, this is definately recommendable. Cool Hindu/Buddist Monkey Idol on bottle is a sweet logo."
"As my name entails, I love this beer, and always get it when visiting VBC. I seem to pick out new subtle nuances with ever glass of this 'complex' brew. Drinkability is the biggest surprise with a beer with such a high abv %. Can easily finish 2 or 3 without problem. (Which unfortunately means the end of the drinking for the evening.)"
"However, this more than a game effort at a Tripel, all the more because it masks the high ABV. Although not on par with its other contributions such as the brilliant Hop Wallop, Victory has done itself and its devotees proud with this delicious Tripel. Well worth trying, a fine Tripel."
"Had a hay/golden color and smelled of fresh fruit, spices, and herbs. The first flavor to hit my palate was a biting spicy hop followed by sugars. Fairly well hidden alcohol - surprising light mouthfeel - just a little sticky. Really from the beers I have had of Victory's (which is only the three listed above), they are a very conservative brewer. That is, they stay true to form of the style and dont venture to far out with experimentation. This was not a very remarkable tripel."
"Overall: A worthwhile tripel. The alcohol presence could have been better disguised- thus better served as a sipper."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried this new style, and will eventually drink this beer again. I've had a darker Belgian before, and my initial reaction is that I enjoyed the darker one more (although it is unfair to compare different styles, obviously). So, for now, I consider this to be an ok beer that has me interested enough to revisit sometime in a few months."
"It's a golden, slightly hazy color with a thick fluffy white head and some light lacing. It smells fruity; there are some hints of lemon zest in it, some herbs and spices. It has a medium/light body that's mildly sweet when it first hits your tongue, slightly bitter around the side of your mouth and has a mild aftertaste that's semi-sweet and has a dry alcohol feeling to it. It really warms up your mouth; I would definitely buy this one again"
"A full body is well carbonated and goes down well. Another very nice drinker from victory. Quality example of the style."
"Would not seek this one out again."
"I'm really not impressed at all by this beer. There are so many better tripels out there."
"D - I love this beer. It has a high alcohol content and the monkey will bite if you drink to many too quickly."
"Drinkability - As soon as I got to #3 I passed out."
"NOtes: A really great beer to have one or two in a sitting. Certainly a sipping beer, not to be drunk over and over in a session."
"Drinkability is fairly nice. The smooth beer goes down nice, but I can really feel the alcohol and taste the sweetness, making it hard to drink too many of these."
"This is not an excellent tripel, but it isn't a bad beer nevertheless. It pours a very thick, syrupy, cloudy, orangy yellow, with decent carbonation, some head that retains around the edges. The aroma is the high point. There is a very nice sweet malty, almost bubblegum quality, banana and clove aroma. The smell is quite pungent and is indicative of things to come. The taste of the beer is compromised by the strong alcohol content, too strong in fact, and it gets in the way of the flavors. There is a decided rum soaked banana and pineapple taste, there is clove and other tart spices, there is also a tad bit of lemony tart citrus in the beer too. The finish is very acerbic and it leaves a mouthfeel as though the alcohol content in the beer is sucking the saliva out of the glands. The beer is medium to full bodied and quite syrupy. The mouthfeel is the low point. This is a sipping beer, way too strong, with the warming alcohol notes, surpassed by the strong alcohol that causes problems in the mouthfeel, finish, and aftertaste."
"Nice amount of carbonation, medium bodied, although the sweetness is very dominant. This is a very enjoyable beer, but the sweetness and higher abv make it a slower sipper."
"Very impressed. Poured a little darker then a lot of belgians...very nice golden color. The spices are what make the beer. Hints of clove and orange peel, even a little bit of cinnamon in the finish. The beer is so balanced that the higher abv is almost undetectable."
"Golden monkey is a nice beer to have on a relaxing evening. It is a decently strong ale at 9.5% ABV, which is definately tasted and has a nice kick. Way to go, Victory!"
"I approve!"
"If you like this style, that is ,belgian tripel, you will like this brew. It is definitely a sipping beer, I found it heavier in alcohol and lighter in drinkability than my drinking companion, fellow beer advocate bert haley...I prefer the golden carolus and the leffe blonde better - but not bad for the keystone state... salud'!!!"
"84/100"
"An enjoyable brew to sip on, however somewhat strong. Kinda like that about it though. Surely not a pussy brew."
"Golden Monkey is a pretty good american attempt at a belgian but doesn't come close to the real deal. Still a good beer though."
"9.5% ABV means I won't be drinking a whole sixer in one session. However, this is a great beer to share, so long as the sediment doesn't drive anyone away. This is a great beer for a cool crisp evening."
"12 ounce bottle of the Golden Monkey. Yellow to orange hazy liquid with a modest head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is yeasty spicy and orange citrus. Slightly creamy and coats the palate. Bitterness present throughout but balanced nicely by a slightly spicy fruitiness. The sweetness builds while drinking the bottle as does the warming from the deceivingly high alcohol. Good brew, drinkable brew, but if you drink to much it will knock you out."
"Finished the night with this bottled. It poured with a murky gold appearance with no head. A pretty decent citrus, orange aroma was prevalent in the drink. The taste was also pretty fruity and had that orange flavor to it, but it also had a good hoppy quality to it. Medium body with nothing special there. Overall, this was a pretty tasty, decent drink."
"Overall not my favorite style but still a nice version of a tripel."
"Pours a soft orange, with little bubbles and very little head. Coriander completely dominates, with a slight bit of grass and possibly honey. Taste is again coriander, yet the taste is a bit more like hot dog coriander. Spices are noticed, but not on the forefront at all. Pepper is incredibly present at the finish. A weird attack by a sourness that I'm not sure exactly where it comes from. My least favorite brew by Victory, from a producer I respect quite a bit."
"Pale straw, cloudy, no head showing and a hint of lace. Smell is apricots, oranges, carmel, a little phenol, and a touch of pepper. Very balanced. Taste is very malty at first, then the citrus fruits come on, ending in a pepppery and nutty finish. Very smooth & well blended together but fairly single-dimensional. Afterwards you notice the alcohol & a lingering pepper and candy element. The mouthfeel is silky but a touch cloying. The drinkability is probably the monkey's strongpoint. It masks the alcohol well & if you can get past the predominant pepper, you've got a heck of an afternoon or evening in front of you. At 9.5%, just remember to take water breaks in between to get the monkey off your back for a bit."
"Extra notes:Jan.17th.2009-I had a bottle from 2007 that I tried today and the main difference was that the carbonation seemed to be toned down and the sweetness seemed to take over on the spice kick. The hops were also toned down and the cloves/herbs were more dominant. I would grade it a B."
"D: Nice, the 9.5% is not all that noticeable. Great with peanuts."
"I'd like to drink this one all day long as overall it's very nice, but with an ABV this high I think that I can only have one (or two) in a session. I'd definitely recommend this to others."
"D. Dangerously drinkable. I once drank a six pack of this in my early beer drinking days, I was rendered useless on my couch."
"A few friends recommended this beer, so I thought I would give it a whirl. This beer poured a nice deep gold(hence Golden Monkey). I only drank this beer about 6 ounces at a time. It smelled of citrus and spice. Very fruity!! At first sip, I thought the alcohol really pierced through. After that, it was ""game on"". The more I drank, and the warmer the beer got, the more that strong spicy citrus flavor started coming out. I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of style preference. As far as Belgian styles go, I think it is unique(and good)."
"Still a really great beer that will only get better!"
"I got a big whiff of citrus and spices, especially some orange, but not much else. Unbelievable smoothness and spicing in this beer, as it is medium-bodyish. The spiciness hits first, then it smooths over the tongue with some caramel and the citric flavors kick in, like orange, and then there is a peppery backbite. To be honest, after the first sip I thought that maybe the bartender gave me the hefe beer next to this, but I checked the bottle to make sure. Not too much malt, but it did have a little breadiness to it (I think). I don't know, I thought this beer tasted real good and I'd have another (I wouldn't session it). People who have had it told me it isn't that good, but I disagree. I don't know, I'd say give it a shot and let your taste buds form their own opinion. (Note: Like stated before, it tasted like a hefeweizen and I love hefe's, so maybe that's why I like it)"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy, wheat-gold color with a two-finger, glistening head that dies down relatively quickly. Nose is heavy with spicey phenols and yeast; alcohol is well hidden. The taste is spicey also, almost hefe-like with the banana/clove flavor coming out strongest. The hops are not really percievable but they balance the beer nicely. Mouthfeel is medium in body and has a light mouthburning carbonation and a dry alcohol finish. Decently drinkable for being as high of an ABV beer as it is. Overall, not a bad beer but if you're looking for a good Belgian tripel, this is not what you want. Decent American take on the style, but not what I was hoping for."
"This is a decent stab at the style at best. It is something I could drink if I had to, but there are much better belgians to be had."
"BTW: I was quite intoxicated when I had this and wrote the review. I will not posthumously edit this review, but I have a bottle of this in the fridge, and will give a more thorough review of the bottled Golden Monkey soon."
"D- This is a hard beer to put down but it is very tasty. This is a beer you might have one or two a week justtosit and relax after you had a bad or stressful day. This is potent beer and will mess you up if you drink this like bud light."
"On tap, it pours a beautiful cloudy golden yellow. Aroma is not strong, but crisp and wheaty with a strong citrus component. Flavor is richly wheaty with a strong lemon overtone and some surprisingly strong hoppy taste. It goes down smoothly but with some pizzazz and leaves a satisfying hoppy aftertaste."
"This beer poured poured an opaque yellowish orange with a fluffy single-finger head. The smell is some sweet malt with hints of fruit and spice. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives away to banana and apricot fruitiness that finishes off with some nice spice. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with some nice warming from the alcohol. It's a very tasty beer, but it might sit a little heavy to have more than one of at a time."
"Hmmm. There is nothing extraordinary about this beer. Just a solid, good Tripel."
"D - This is a very good tripel. Maybe one of the best American versions of the style."
"D: The above mentioned would be the only points that would hurt drinkability, along with the fact that the ABV is up there, but that's expected when going with a Tripel. A little smoother and it would possibly be a bit nicer... maybe I'll use it as a 'cellaring experiment.'"
"This poured a slightly hazy gold with a little bit of white head. It smelled of honey and apricot with some hops. It tasted sweet through and through, with a smooth aftertaste. It was watery and carbonated, but had an unbalanced flavor with almost no bitterness. Overall it was pretty good but too sweet for my likings."
"Overall impression: Hard to believe the ABV of this one, it is dangerously drinkable."
"D- dangerously drinkable? yes indeed. if you delve too deep lookin for spices you might find yourself with a near empty glass in only a few minutes which can lead to screwed up dinner plans, lack of ambition, and nap. fortunately for me i already took a nap today and have lacked ambition for quite some time so since dinner's on the stove i'll have another monkey and pick apart this golden s.o.b."
"Drinkability here is average. I'd drink it again for sure, but as a session beer I don't think I could do this, not because of the ABV, but because of the aftertaste."
"The appearance is orange in color with a white head. You can spot the yeast in the head. Smells of candy sugars, clove and spice. All the familiar smells of a Belgian style ale. Tastes of citrus and spice. Slight taste of hops, sweet and tart. A drinkable beer. Well balanced."
"Pours cloudy golden with a fizzy white head an inch thick. Small sediments make their way through the beverage. The head has good retention as it laces the glass nicely as I consume this beer. Aroma is spicy. Orange peel/orange curaco. Nutmeg. Cinnamon. Very nice. This beer has some taste. There's a bit of alcohol. There's a bit of hard candy. There's some spice, including cinnamon and pepper. A bit lemony. Tangy. All of this backed up with a nice belgian malt backbone. Very complex beer. Has a light-to-medium body I would say. Very drinkable for a beer with this much alcohol."
"Considering the ABV, I guess you can't grade this tasty elixir as very drinkable, but it sure goes down dangerously easily. I didn't realize it was packing so much heat while drinking the first one... then I saw the % on the bottle. Wow.. smooth!"
"Poured a hazy golden-yellow w/light head. Nice lacing. Nose was primarily spice, light nectarine, and faint apricot. The flavor was rather sweet with very strong spice characters of clove and nutmeg, lemon rind, faint dried apricot on the midpalate, and warming alcohol throughout. The finish was very spicy. Body and carbonation were great, but overall, although I enjoyed this one, I found the spice to be overpowering."
"Pours a nice glean golden color with a white head. I hate to say it, but this beer smells much better than it tastes. It has a great sweet sugary aroma. The taste leaves me a little disappointed because I was expecting a little more. It has a nice sweetness to it but I think it could be smoother, given its style. It is a nice try, but not my favorite."
"D: Not very. I will finish this one and not get any more."
"Not my type of drinkable beer, but definitely enjoyable for one."
"D - This was an interesting beer not compleatly what I expected but it was very good and something different worth trying"
"Overall, this is a pretty decent beer, but it's not as gripping as its Belgian cousins. With those beers, there's a nice mellowness about it. With the Victory, the bite that's added is somewhat off-putting. Still, not a bad beer at all."
"D: Drinks bigger then its 9.5% alcohol but is crisp with a good warming sensation that is fairly easy to handle."
"I thought this would be great, ended up decent. Glad I snagged a bottle from my roommate and didn't buy this myself."
"I really enjoyed this beer, much more then I expected. I have a number if tripels (Belgian and North American) and found this to be one of the more pleasing, probably agrees with my palate and favoring American spins. Recommended."
"will have to try from the 750 mL"
"D: A pleasant blend of tangy sweetness and spice with a hidden but high alcohol content. Would be a great early summer, out on the porch with nothing to do tomorrow beer."
"This is one of my favorites and at 9.5%ABV it packs a punch. It pours a nice sort of orange-yellow (more orange than yellow) with a thin head and some mild lacing. Has a solid nice citrusy scent with a hint of spice. The taste is much the same, as you are hit with the spices and then the strong citrus. Has an above average carbonation to it, but still goes down smooth and has a nice, crisp finish. Like I said, one of my favs."
"The bottle has a best-by-date of ""Nov 05 12"" printed on the label for you skeptics who think I simply got a bad bottle. Sorry Victory, but I sense defeat in this beer. Back to the drawing board on this stuff."
"D - Not a bad tripel at all. This has a lot of characteristics that remind me of a wit, but with tons more alcohol and sugar. Sort of reminds me of Celis Grand Cru."
"Poured a hazy yellow, gold with a thin fizzy white head. A lot of lacing and a lot of effervescence bubbling up throughout. Smelled of fruits, apricot and grapes jumped out. Taste was mostly a tart grape like a light white wine but with a sour and a spiciness that compliments the sweetness. The mouthfeel was sticky yet smooth with a high carbonation. Not too much alcohol present for a 9.5 and definitely no burn. This was a great offering from Victory and I will definitely be getting some more to stick in the beer ""cellar."""
"I now pick up a bottle whenever I go to the singles shop. This stuff is absolutely delicious."
"I like this beer, it reminds me of a true Belgian white. A nice incorporation to the victory lineup."
"Cheers!"
"A pleasant experience that can leave a serious punch. Not the best triple out there, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Pours a hazy light gold in color. Plenty of haze and some yeasty chunks suspended in the glass. Smell is belgian yeast a good amount of spice there to help. The belgian yeast, not surprisingly, is dominating. Very smooth and easy drinking. Packs a hefty punch thanks to the ABV. Decent beer to have once in a while."
"D - Well, once this beer smooths out, you're able to drink it."
"Pours a nice golden color with a slightly off white head. Very good carbonation. Smells a bit spicy and yeasty (is that a word?). Complex taste, medium bodied mouthfell, and good drinkability for the ABV. Solid American Tripel and one I would love to have again."
"The aroma was yeasty Belgian strain with some flowery smell. The taste was spicy with a hint of nutmeg. In the mouth it was spicy and the spice sits in the mouth for a long time. Very cool. Very enjoyable Tripel."
"D:Not very drinkable. Between the sweetness and the funk. Could not pick up the ABV though. Much better examples of tripels out there."
"Regardless, I wouldn't pass this one up."
"The mouth is pleasantly sharp. I can see having this one every once in awhile."
"Another top-notch sample from Victory... been waiting a long time to sample this brew, and it was worth the wait... an awesome American depiction of a Belgian style... pours a hazy, cloudy, golden, straw-colored appearance with a minimal frothy head that soon was gone... Nice citrus and floral aroma with a sweet presence certainly noticeable... taste is bombarded with sugars, candy, vanilla, slight caramel, and pears... very sweet flavor that tackles the tongue... good job by Victory for creating a true-to-the-style brew that is really pleasing... Nice mouthefeel with a good drinkabiliy that took a little bit of a hit due to the hefty 9.5% ABV and the slight alcohol that is noticeable in the taste... otherwise, a very good brew, worthy of praise and recognition... good stuff... Recommended..."
"I know this isn't a true trappist tripel but it seemed a little rough around the edges for me. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy this ale thoroughly but I think there are others in the style that I would pick up first. As for domestic Tripels - I like it."
"T: somewhat plain with the effervescent fruit type taste. its got some yeasty almost wheat beer type flavors and finish. a little banana... not super impressed compared to others in this style, that said its not bad. its a good beer that you can def understand the style its in, however its not the best example. try and enjoy"
"Great beer, there may be others I would choose, but this is a great example of the style and a great buy as far as price and availability are concerned."
"Overall, this was a very nice Trappist ale. It's hard to imagine that it is 9.5%."
"The first time I tried this, I wasn't so into it, but a year actually did this beer surprisingly well. Very unexpected. I dunno if I'd call it the most authentic-tasting tripel around, but not too shabby if you're in the mood for that kind of that kind of thing (which to be honest, I'm usually not, but I'm trying to be un-biased here)."
"Notes: Good American tripel. Good flavor profile. Nice beer overall."
"A decent attempt at a Belgian tripel, but invariably sweet due to the high alcohol. Could have used a bit more balance with bitterness, IMO. Still, a nice drinkable beer with a fruity exotic creaminess to it. I would try it again but only as an occasional treat."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Pours a mellow orange color with a small head. The beer is very very fragrant; malt yeast and fruit aromas alcohol does not come through at all. Tastes of more malts and finishes smooth with some melon and bannana after tastes. This beer has a nice carbonation that makes it refreshing to drink."
"Close to 10% alcohol, the bang-for-the-buck effect is in play here. Pours with a nice head and an unmistakable aroma, this is like an extreme Belgian. The alcohol content can be noticed, but it is mostly well rounded into the flavors. There was no sweetness to this beer at all, which was unique but left me hanging a bit. A sharp wild yeast bite to it in the aftertaste quickly followed by a lingering sourness & bitterness that didn't play too well together, but probably helped to hide the alcohol bite. Pretty clear beer with mild haziness. Like I said, bang-for-the-buck, but not at the top of my list for tripels."
"Initial impression is a bit lackluster. Puny head over cloudy peach liquid. Haze is mostly of small chunkies. Aroma is medicinal with some spiciness and citrus. Flavour is an initial hit of yeastiness and moderate bitterness and some orange peel. There's some coriander (I think) and a bit of a wheat-like character as well. Body is fairly light with a creamy touch, and drinkability is quite good. Aside from the appearance, I would say this is a bright, fresh, light interpretation of the tripel."
"Its got a nice soft yellow color, almost that of straw. You might mistake this for a macro-lager from across the room. Get this baby anywhere near your face and any case of mistaken identity will be resolved real quickly. The strong yeast smell you get on first whiff is nothing compared to the rich flavor on the palate. Theres not much to separate this beer from the hundreds of other tripels on the market, but this one is a bargain at ~$12 per 6pk instead of $10+ for a 750ml."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a tripel. Alcohol is not that evident in the taste. Easy to drink and good tasting. Definitely worth the try."
"Morey's Bottome Line: An interesting beer for sure. Not one I could have very many of, but a nice choice if you're in the mood for something different."
"Pours hazed gold. Lots of sediment floating all over. Nose is subdued with a mild chalky yeast. Flavor is...ack! Sweet! Bitter on the tail end, but nowhere near good enough to save this. Feel is low on bubble, thicker on sticky syrup for the liquid feel. Drinkable? No. Actually...this is pretty damn bad."
"Heavy on the palate but clean. Bright with a yeasty warmth that lingers with a fruity vinous quality. The texture/flavor is a surprise after observing the appearance. I really expected something lighter and bubbly. Tasty and complete, a very solid selection. But beware because this stuff will sneak up on you fast with a relatively well hidden 9.5% abv."
"There are only a handful of North American breweries to nail the Belgian styles. While Victory gets closer than some, this is still a mediocre version of a tripel."
" Edit, 7/13/08 : had one from may '07, aged well, flavors melded together well, a slight coconut flavor seems to have developed in this one as well as a bit of co2 loss..."
"Nondescript mouthfeel, and really at this point not terribly drinkable. Worth a re-visit in the future though."
"High alcohol content on this spicy beer. Smells of bread-like hops, yeast, spices (coriander, maybe), bananas, and malts. The first noticeable taste is the herbal spices and hops, followed by the sweetened banana-flavor. Reminds me a lot of Unibroue's Don de Dieu, which had the same bready, banana-like, coriander flavor. But this beer has a noticeable alcohol content; very warming and a bit in-your-face. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the banana/coriander/bread mix, but it's a decent beer and worth a try."
"Drinkability- Not a bad beer to try or have as an evening sipper but there are a lot better Tripels out there."
"D- It was really not a bad drinker. Beyond the alcohol tones, it has a nice flavor and is easily sipped."
"I will probably by one next time to store away for a year or two."
"Drinkability: This is a pleasant beer, and Id never turn one down. However, there are better ones in this style."
"D = Quite drinkable. Given the ABV, probably only good for one at a sitting, but it goes down easily and enjoyably."
"I could drink this shit all night, so good.."
"D: It was a nice flavor filled tripel. The high ABV and full body make it a brew that is not well suited for a session beer."
"Long finish and easy drinking, but not as complex as most tripels out there."
"d: This was the last bottle from a 6 pack I bought a year ago. I thought maybe a year would help, it didn't (bottled Sept. 06). The worst offering from a great brewery IMO."
"This is a BIG strong flavored triple that is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: A pleasant tripel, but I don't think I could have more than two in a sitting."
"I expected a bigger beer. Just too thin and has a lack of depth considering the style. It tastes good and drinks easy but there are better."
"I would definitely have this one again."
"This is still kind of fun, but I think it may have passed its prime."
"Poured a cloudy amber color with little evidence of head or lacing. The aroma was a fairly typical clovey wheat blend, not too strong but inviting. The flavor hops out as almost a licorice, some excpected alcohol, fine carbonation for a bit of a bite but not harsh at all. There is biscuit and many of the usual tripel qualities, maybe a bit of cranberry, but it does seem to mask the ABV pretty well, so it's relatively drinkable for the style. It's solid but not highly memorable. Worth a try, I wouldn't turn it down."
" Alchohol right out of the gate but does seem to mellow through the sitting. This monkey will knock the ape shit out of you. Not one of the best i've had from this style BUT, I'm loyal to Victory and i do like this enough to purchase again. Give it a try."
"Drinkability: It is so-so. The harsh alcohol bite sort of mellows out by the end of the glass. But I think I'll let the rest of this six pack mellow out for a few months before I go for another."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty solid beer. It is a little sweet however. My wife loves this one. I enjoy it, but cannot see myself ordering it with other belgian beers available. It is in my opinion a good call."
"Drinkability: For an Amerrican micro, this is not a bad attempt. But you cant make a great Trippel without bottle conditioning. My stance is that if it is not bottle conditioned it is not worth drinking again. (3.0)"
"Very drinkable, quite good."
"i actually like this quite a bit. Other reviewers are right though, this is a poor example of the style. But i don't really drink it as an exmple. Weak head, that certainly doesn't last, and the lacing is weak when it's there at all. Very full and silky mouthfeel however. The flavor may not be rich and complex, but i really like it's basic profile; not too sweet and not as bitter or alcoholic as others of the style. In an odd way this reminds me of Midas Touch from DogFishHead. Not as sweet or complex, but far more economical. A great strong beer for a Friday night at home if you can get it easily."
"Smell is fruity esters from the yeast, some spicy hops, malt, and alcohol. Taste is similar. Not very subdued and not as balanced as a true belgian (of any quality, at least). Definately an American version. I can and do drink this occasionally. Good, but not worth the effort if you can't find it easily and for a good price. As part of a variety pack paired with HopDevil, V Lager and Prima Pils, though, this is hard to beat. I love victory for what they are (local, cheap, ballsy) but there are certainly better tripels out there."
"I bought this beer in a 750 ml bottle. Right before popping the cork the bottle caught the sunlight just right and I noticed a nice cloudiness from the beer. Upon pouring the the beer was a slightly cloudy golden color with a a white head that dissipated fairly quick. There was a good aroma with orange peel and belgian yeast dominating. The taste was good, what I would of expected out of the tripel with some hints of fruit with a slight alcohol finish. The mouthfeel on this beer was of a fairly high carbonation and good density. The finish was a little sharp and you knew you were drinking a 9.5% beverage. Overall I'm a fan, I'd drink again."
"Drinkability  quite drinkable, I would have another."
"It is quality, but not one that I will be buying again anytime soon."
"I love tripels and Golden Monkey is a widely available, really solid local version. It's not the best out there, but it's damn good and I always smile when I see it on tap."
"The punch of the alcohol keeps it from being easy to drink. It's easy to enjoy but one or two should suffice."
"Ron and Bill ...thank you ! A gem of a tripel for the price !"
"poured into a Piraat tulip glass. Has a 1cm golden head with but doesn't linger with some mild lacing. Has a beautiful citrusy smell and a light alcoholic taste. There is a somewhat watery mouthfeel that is pleasant, but alcholic. This is the most affordable, widely available acceptable Belgium ale that I have found in OH. This beer makes me happy. It's not Piraat. Chimay or Watou, but it's pretty damn good. Give it a try."
"Golden Monkey pours a bright cloudy gold with a bubbly head that doesn't linger. The aroma is dry chalky yeast and light fruity esters, with some sweet light malts. The flavor is sharp and crisp at first with a sour/tart flavor. More chalky yeast with some nice spicy hops, plenty of bitterness to go around. The alcohol is certainly apparent, not quite as well hidden as I would like, there is a slight solvent taste in the finish. I'm curious about the spices, maybe some citrus or coriander, but I'm not picking up a whole lot."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Not quite an all nighter, but 2 or 3 sets the mood right!"
"D - A little bit rough in some of the flavors. Not as drinkable as a triple or strong golden ale should be. Not all bad though; if they toned the alcohol down just a bit and upped the spice it could make a nice saison."
"With all this sugar I would tend to think that this is not that sessionable."
"Pours a clear orange color. Moderate carbonation. Fizzy white head. Low head retention. Aroma is very fruity, apple cider like with hints of cinnamon & spices. Taste is of dried fruits, along with some clove as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, slightly astringent, fizzy. Drinkability... Hmm. It's good, but the spicey flavors make this an aquired taste. Share a bomber/750 of this with friends and you'd be very happy. Try to drink the whole thing yourself, and you may not finish it."
"Like it fresh, like it old. My favorite is about a year old or so."
"Pours clear gold with strong carbonation, but nearly zero head or lace. The smell is super sweet, with big honey overtones on alcohol laced peaches and grapes. Some spicy medicinal gin notes in the background as well. The flavor takes some acclimation. Bitter initial medicinal spiciness seques into strong alcohol and sour notes in the finish. Some honey in the center and dry hops in the finish. Becomes smoother, much more mellowed and honeyed as it warms. Body is rich and syrupy, with strong alcohol sting. Pretty agreeable by the end, but i expect that the strength and flavor will make it an acquired taste."
"Victory is an awesome brewery, but GM has some improving to do. Great for the price. It really seems they tried to stretch regular ingredients into something supreme. Will try again in a year or so, since V Brewing deserves it! I shouldn't be a pig since Victory cannot be purchased in Tennessee."
"Great pick up for five dollars on sale"
"Fantastic brew! Okay. Is this the BEST Tripel out there? No. Of course not. The trapists and other Belgian brewers have them beat hands-down. But let's look at all aspects of this beer. First off, it comes in a six-pack. Can the best-of-the-best tripel brewers say that? Not so much. Next, look at the ABV. 9.5%. Quite impressive for a six-pack beer. Now as under-rated as this topic is, you have to look at price. At $8.50 per six pack (at my local liquor store), that brings the price down to about $1.42 per 12 oz bottle. Now add that all up. A delicious Belgian tripel at 9.5% for $1.42 per 12 oz bottle? Are you kidding? What's not to love about this beer? This one wins my all around drinkability award. Wonderful stuff."
"The mouthfeel was thin and sharp. The carbonation was high, and without a richer texture, that made for a bite that I didnt love. I thought that I might have an old bottle, since my friend from back east told me, Dude, you have to try this! and it was such an average attempt at an interesting beer. But no; its best by date was December of 07  3 months from now. Anyways, I drank it all. It was OK. Drinkability-wise, Id say this: each sip was definitely an experience just not a great one."
"This beer was okay. I don't think I would seek it out, but I wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me."
"*S"
"ABV is heavy, never have more than two of these. The wispy flavors allow for stronger flavored beers with less ABV to follow."
"This beer pours a solid golden color with an average head that fades. There is heavy esters wafting from the glass. Very phenolic, with bits of clove and spice, even smells hot. So so. I did not enjoy drinking this beer at all. I finished it because I bought it, which I wont do agian. Rocket fuel abounds in this beer, malt and spice attempt to balance but it comes up short."
"D- Best after a shitty day at work, very smooth."
"Bottle in a trappist glass...intriguing aroma of grapefruit with yeast to spare....balanced hops/malts too...the body is an attractive orange, though only a rim of head exists...carbonated malt explodes at the back of the mouth, while a fleeting sizzle creases the tongue...for a triplel, this shows softly by mid-finish...another victory for Victory."
"The taste matched the aroma fairly well; Belgian spices (cloves, coriander), herbal and earthy hops, and a slight banana flavor all blended nicely. A slightly warm alcoholic finish rounded out the brew. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but overall not a distraction. This is a solid attempt at a Belgian tripel, since it's very flavorful and packs a punch. I would have it again."
"Its not too bad. Still there are much better examples of this style of brew, even the American ones kick this beers tail."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is okay. It's a hefty beer at 9.5%. Pretty drinkable at that level. Overall, it's a pretty good. I'd drink it again."
"Decent enough to kick back and sip one. It's how I ended Sundays session. Popped one anew this afternoon for a fresh impression."
"D - Overall, not very good in my estimation. Not worth your time."
"Pours a light amber color with little carbonation (poured from a bottle into a snifter). Almost no head, little retention and virtually no lacing. Has a fairly ""spicy"" smell to it, with some hints of banana. Smells very alcoholic (with good reason, I guess). Fairly mellow taste, considering the style. Bread-like. Spicy, and banana tastes to match the aroma. Very malty. A pretty heavy mouthfeel. Again, very alcoholic. Definitely a sipping beer. Overall, a decent beer, but not very impressive, especially for the style."
"Overall-I always want to review my locals well but alas I could not this time. It made a nice plate of mussles from the recipe on the victory website though"
"Golden Monkey tastes okay, but it is one of the worst American interpretations of a Tripel that I have sampled thus far. If you want to sample a good American Tripel, pick up some Allagash - that stuff is delicious and highly representative of the style. That said, Golden Monkey is still a good brew - it tastes pretty good and goes down smooth, but when compared to others in the same style, it falls short. Really short. It is worth sampling for the experience, and I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me, but I doubt that I will ever buy it again."
"Another solid brew from the boys in Downingtown. On first pour this brew was gold with almost no head, a subsequent pour, after the brew had warmed, produced a good head. Aroma is fruity, but mostly citrus and a little dry, some biscuity malts in the background. Taste has a little bite, but not too distracting. Goes down smooth. A fine brew for the style, but there are better out there."
"Appearance is pretty terrible. The first two I poured out had no head retention at all. I gave the third a fair chance and a different glass. No help at all. It's a golden beer with absolutely no head. Smells like sweet alcohol at first. A second smell gives it a fruitier almost grassy smell which is pretty good. The taste is quite similar to the smell, if perhaps more grassy. Not bad, just not all the hype I've heard about it. It has a nice full body and a hint of alcohol warmth, which is probably the nicest feature of this beer. Nothing would really stop me from drinking this beer, except that it's 10% alcohol and the crappy appearance."
"I split this bottle with a friend and I was glad. The monkey is deceptively strong as you cannot taste the alcohol. The color is a cloudy golden yellow with a white head. The smell is yeasty and spicy. The taste was fruity, yeasty, spicy and delicious. I would have drank the whole bottle but I am glad I didn't given the high ABV. This is a solid beer from Victory and if you like the style, give it a shot."
"Its nice and fairly smooth, but tastes like its missing the candi sugar. There;s a sweet complexity missing here, the flavor is all on the golden grains. Still, this beer really hides the alcohol to the point of being a little dangerous. Just remember it's not a session ale. It's tasty and smooth enough to put you on the floor."
"d reach for an Allagash any day against this. Disappointing."
"Fizzy with a mineraly finish. Well attenuated and overall a pretty good tripel."
"D - Overall this was not bad at all, not my favorite belgian style ale, nor my favorite from victory, put definatly not bad. Will have to give it a secind try, just seems a bit strong for my everyday tastes, definatly unique and one that you should definatly try."
"Beautiful golden color with ample carbonation, yet a bit of a lackluster head for the style. Smell is honey and fresh flowers. The peppery flavor is a fine example of the style, if not overly complex. Alive with fruity esters, coriander, and the usual suspects in a well-crafted triple. Mouthfeel is luxurious and crisp at once. Having consumed more than my share of botched attempts at Belgian beers by micros, I shied away for awhile, but now having tried it I'm very impressed by this, and will definitely buy again. Where else can you get a sixer of a triple for $10, anyway?"
"Pours a heavy, hazy, yellow gold color with little head to speak of. This being my first taste of one of Victory's selections I was impressed and the reputation preceding is unmistakable. The smell was apparent as soon as I opened the bottle and the poor brought out all the spice and sweetness. The nose was filled with sweet; like honeysuckle, slight spice, alcohol, and hop notes. Taste was impressive, not aggressive like most tripels. This is sweeter than most and well balanced with (again) honeysuckle, spices (that I can't describe), alcohol is very present but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and wet with just a touch of slime that sticks to the throat. Yum. This tripel is the top that I've tasted."
"D - 9.5%...Just watch it. I just fell asleep on my in-law's couch after four of these and dinner. Not a great idea to advertise my ""hobby."""
"Drinkability: I did not care for this one at all, as its excessive spiciness, as well as its array of weak, uninteresting flavors was a complete turn off for me. Pass."
"Decent brew...don't know how well this follows trappist style but I like it because when FRESH..it's a great 'big"" beer..like liquid custard with massive kick and decent drinkability."
"Tastes of sweet fruit preserves & candied ginger. Slippery, with a bit of a hard alcohol burn going down; the carbonation has trouble making an impact. Sweeter & sweeter as it warms, to the point of being too much to differentiate flavors. It coats & chokes. Burps up lovely though. :)"
"The flavor features a creaminess that doesn't show up in the mouth. I notice some bitterness from hop and certainly the alcohol level. High carbonation. Slight sourness in the aftertaste."
"Nicely balanaced, bananas and biscuty body. This balalnced doesn't stop there; doesn't fall in to the sour/sweet category. Slight estery notes sandwiched nicely in in between and unbelieveably well hidden 9,5% ABV."
"Additional Comments: This beer isn't for everyone, it's not your typical tripel... way to go Victory!"
"D - A real easy one to return to with all the spice and depth that a tripel has to offer. The golden sweetness w/ strong abv makes it hard to deny, but at the same time only a good rating for drinkability since it's high abv makes it difficult to have more than a few."
"Pours an hazy golden orange color with a below average head for a tripel. I actually needed a hard pour to get a decent head. The smell is a bit metallic, Belgian yeast, tropical fruit, not as pronounced as most tripels. The brew makes up for the lack of smell with its taste. It is a solid tripel but not as complex as those from Belgium. The taste is of the Belgian candi sugar, clove, a bit of corriander, and a light light hop finish. The feel is a bit too crisp for a tripel, well carbonated, and a tad boozy. Overall, a decent American tripel. The appearance is pretty sad for a tripel but it does have good taste and is quite drinkable."
"Got this one in a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass at the Fox and the Hound tonight. Tasty beer. Pours a nice fairly light copper color, although the head is pretty weak and dissolves really quickly. Nose is nice, lots of malt and dried fruit. Taste is solid as well; lots of molasses, brown sugar, some spices as well, and a little bit of fruitiness too. Feel is full and tasty, quite good overall. Not a bad beer; it's kind of a stereotypical tripel, embodying a lot of the characteristics I imagine in the style. It's good, just not great, and there a lot of great tripels out there (although maybe not quite as cheap as this one)."
"This is a fair version of a triple. Love the price."
"Overall a good beer, more like a Belgian strong pale ale. Very sweet and thick, but still quite enjoyable."
"This brew poured a hazy yellowish straw color. Nice carbonation with a clean white head. It dissipated rather quickly. Smell is very floral and yeasty. Sweet apricot scent with some banana and pineapple hints. Smooth taste with a rather sharp finish. Mellow yeast taste with a sourness mixed in. There is a mild pale malt flavor in the mouth with the nice sour tone. Certainly seems to be a decent Belgium style offering. At 9.5% abv I was surprised how hidden the alcohol was. I enjoyed this one both in a bottle and on tap before at Pitcher's Pub in RI. Bold freshness stamp right on the front of the bottles label. Bottled Nov. 03 06. Good brew and definitely worth giving it a shot."
"Fun American take on the Tripel indeed; I would definitely try it again."
"hops play a much more significant role in the flavor category. more lager malts, though and a hint of cinnamon and coriander"
"The beer pours a nice yellow with a thin head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma was of sweet malts and peppery spice. The taste was also of sweet malts with a decent spiciness to it. Not quite as much as some authentic Belgian Tripels. The beer was medium to heavy bodied with a low carbonation and warming alcohol. This is a very decent Tripel for one most commonly found in six packs. I would love to get my hands on a corked 750ml and see if its better."
"Pours a clear golden with a short head for the style and no lacing. The smell is a little sharp from alcohol, and with a trace of the typical Belgian yeast aromas. The taste is a little better, especially as it warms. Definite alcohol, but also some banana and clove- very restrained, though. Mouthfeel is a little sticky, but the body is appropriate. Not bad in its own right, except that its a little hot. The problem is that there are plenty of better tripels out there."
"Overall: This is a decent tripel, and a beer I would certainly drink again. However, its appearance is a disappointment, and there are many other examples of the style on the market that are superior."
"Drinkability - The alcohol high alcohol content is very present but is not offensive or distracting."
"I had a bit of a time getting this one down. Could just be me, but this one rubbed me the wrong way. I am a huge Victory fan and I have to say that this one did not live up to my expectations of this brewery."
"Drinkability - I have two of these in 12 oz bottles. I'm curious now to see how these will compare to the on-tap presentation. I enjoyed this brew for the variety and the additional expression of a more ""fruity"" tripel than I'm usually used to."
"Drinkability: The taste wins over everything else making this one well worth the effort. Twos the limit however."
"While this beer feels soft in the mouth, it feels much less substantial than most Belgian tripels I've tried. While this is not one of my favorite styles of beer, this is definately not one of my favorite tripels- probably on the less complex end of the spectrum and I wish it would finish much drier."
"Overall, Golden Monkey is a fantastic beer. Perfect for giving someone an introduction into Tripels."
"Taste is light malty with some spicy and fruity notes, the yeast adds a solvent taste. Mouthfeel is thin like a lot of sugar was used. Bitterness was low. This beer has very little character, the yeast profile is not spectaculair, hops are invisible and body is empty."
"D- hey this is very drinkable and enjoyable. Great example of a belgian triple with a twist. I will definately buy this one again."
"Understandable why this tasty tripel falls in Victory's year-round rotation."
"Straw-colored and clear, head development was minimal despite vigorous signs of carbonation rising to the surface. Smell is mildly sweet and peppery with the distinctive yeast aroma typically associated with Tripels. Taste is sweet and alcoholic with a bit of citrus. While good, flavor is a little too sweet for my taste and the alcoholic warmth a little too biting. Mouthfeel is warming and very carbonated with a good crisp finish. Overall, a very good, drinkable beer."
"This is one of the best American ""Duvel wannabes"" that Ive tasted."
"a little too sweet in the end. I would much rather have a La fin Du Monde."
"I seriously doubt that there are actually adjuncts in this beer, but I'll have to try again to be sure. The mouthfeel is fairly light, similar to Westmalle. The sweetness is nice in small doses, but it's just on the edge of being cloying; it'd be hard to drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and nice though the alcohol is noticeable."
"Drinkability - Nice beer, a sipping beer this is. Enjoyed this one."
"My first tripel so I'm hardly qualified to judge based on style but I definitely enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying more examples of the style. Another delicious beer from Victory."
"All in all... I like it. I recommend it."
"I had this a while back, and didnt like it, being new to the style, so I thought I would try it again, and see if my taste has changed since. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer poured a light gold, forming a white 1 inch head, that slowly faded, leaving light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of sweet dark fruits, a hint of alcohol, and maybe some sweet malt. The taste is great!! Sweet dark fruit flavors up front, a little malt thickness in the middle, and a light sharpness from the hops in the finish, along with a little alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I can safely say that my taste has changed, and my appreciation improved. This is a very delicious beer, and one to be savored, but that said, I think I could still drink a few in one night. Very enjoyable!"
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with zero head to speak of. The nose is vinous with sharp floral alcohol esters, sour fruit, pear, and apple. Richer malt character is more evident on the first sip and a honey and cane sugar sweetness is plenty. Pretty substantial alcohol burn towards the end might hinder some of its nuances. Yeast tones are nice with a straw, biscuity taste. Medium carbonation and a full body leaves a descent mouthfeel that is fizzy on the palate. The finish starts with a big alcohol tinge but mellows out to expose herbal notes, grain, and sweet bread."
"Very sweet flavors dominate this brew up front and all throughout. A hope bitterness kicks in just in time to balance everything out, but this brew is still just too sweet to be highly drinkable. One very good thing about this brew...it does a damn good job of hiding its high ABV."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, it has a good kick to it, however this one wouldn’t be my first choice within the style, even though it’s a pretty decent beer."
"pours a hazy golden color a minimal head almost no lace. smell is of fruit and herb and spice. taste is same but can't really pin point what type of fruit also very sweet on the palate. mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and warms you up going down. very drinkable but with a 9.50 abv it might bite you back."
"Don't drink and review."
"When this entered the glass it appeared as the perfect line between straw- and gold-colored, hazy with a thin head and no retention. The spices come through heavily in the smell and entice you before the first sip. The taste is also heavy in the spices and becomes smooth and mellow in the swallow. Good, but a boy amongst men in the Tripel genre."
"appearance of this beer is a pale cloudy yellow... smelling sweet yet mild... the taste has a little bite to it yet suprisingly sweet, kinda fruity,,, the mouthfeel you get a little back lash of the alcohol but thats expected... drinkability goes down smooth... all in all its good beer worth a try..."
"Drinkability: Overall I enjoyed this as it warmed up a little seemed to take the alcohol edge off a bit."
"Poured into challice looked a murkey straw amber. Faint smell of clove and spice. I did a yeast pour but apparently this is not bottle conditioned? No yeast or sediment of any kind. Taste of cloves and maybe pepper in the finish. I felt the alcohol in the first bottle. Not a session brew. All in all a good beer but far from a great triple."
"Notes - I could see a hate against the yeast tsate/smell, but I enjoy both. Overall a well balanced and dangerously drinkable tripel."
"Good tasting beer,jusy on qualm, its the yeast taste to it,im not fond of it.Other then that its very solid and worth seeking out"
"Despite its high alcohol content, the beer is easy drinking, which could lead to problems down the road. Quite a good beer."
"Good unique beer that reminds me of the few Belgians I have tried, but on steriods. This almost seems like they forced the flavor into it. Not that it's a bad thing."
"Mouthfeel/carbonation was appropriate for the style, and I thought this beer to be fairly drinkable."
"Poured out a murky yellow orange color with zero (see:none) head. The nose gives big spice, yeast, alcohol, orange, and something woody. The taste is at first malt, then alcohol and yeast, countered by orange and spice. Has a peppery dry finish. airly drinkable for a big full bodied beer, nicely flavored and balanced."
"A good attempt at a Triple, but there are better examples out there from American breweries."
"1/10/08 edit: Fresher bottle, actally liked it less. Too sweet, became cloying after a while, alcohol just too high. Knocking down my ratings a bit."
"This is a Tripel. Be careful and no one gets hurt. This really is a yummy beer, wich actually seems to have gotten better in recent years. It is no substitute for the true Belgian Tripels, but this beer paints the broad strokes of the style, and could be a very nice introduction for the uninitiated."
"Good job Victory, but not quite a victory."
"This was another great example of how much Victory rocks. This was the best American shot at a Belgian tripel without putting any yeast in the bottle. It was right up there with the best of them. Smooth, sweet, balanced, bold, and it sure packs a punch. Great job Victory. You are maintaining a great standard with me."
"Drinkability - Really enjoyed this brew, the Victory guys score a big winner here with a great change of pace, when you're in the mood for something strong and sweet brew. Glad I gave it a 2nd chance after initially being turned off by a sample at the Victory brew pub (chalk it up to beer immaturity on my part)."
"victory proves that they can not only excel at german-style pilseners and hoppy apa's but belgian tripels as well."
"Overall, a decent interpretation that doesn't stand up to most Belgian tripels I've had."
"Very drinkable for a 9.5% abv beer. I think I'll have another!"
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a hazy golden color with about a finger of frothy white head. Left little lacing on the glass. Had a sweet , fruity aroma with a little alcohol present. Lots of strong smells coming from the glass. Tasted very belgian actually, with a nice smooth malty taste. Some ginger and other spice flavors. Lots of alcohol up front. This beer was a little overwhelming on the taste buds, with more alcohol in the finish. Not the most drinkable, but with a year or two of age it would be great. Very complex but needs mellowing to reveal all the flavors."
"I didn't find this a very drinkable beer. It should be noted that I'm not a fan of most tripels, but I try to keep this in mind when reviewing. The slight booziness, the thickness, the sour wheat, and definitely the graininess really slowed down my enjoyment of this beer. By the end of this beer, however, it started to grow on me. However, not enough to seek it out again. Fans of tripels may have better luck."
"If you disregard the style, what we have here is a decent enough strong beer. If you like Tripel and have tried some of the good ones, this will not stack up to well. Worth a try..."
"by volume."
"D: Not a huge fan of triples but this one wasn't so bad. Lacked a lot of the dryness and over the top sweetness that can turn me off from the style. I'd drink it again but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"The aromas come over very strong in this brew- overly sweet malts, with a fruity finish. Taste was more of the same- sweet malts with tones of bananas, and sweet flower honey dominate without mercy. No other profiles to mention, aside from the slick oily finish, sweet burning alcohol mouthfeel. Decent, but some other flavors to balance this brew could help a lot."
"D: This one's pretty good, but with an abv at 9.5%, I'd probably have to love it to go another round. Still, would definitely crack this one open at another time."
"D: Would I drink this again? Yes. Would I go out of my way for it? No. A good tasting US version of a Tripel, but it pales in comparison to its 'authentic' counterparts. Worth a try, if only to have a basis point for tasting a truly delicious Belgian Tripel..."
"Would I want another one? Well I'm enjoying the second of the night as a write the review from the first of the night, so yeah."
"Opening of the cap would make a great sizzle, poured into a tulip glass and a storm of bubbles would stir up. Head forms and thins out into a white crown. Plenty of yeast particles suspended, crowding the body, leaving it clouded. A golden apple colour. A light, bready malt aroma. I get some over ripened fruit - pear, apple - some lightly floral hops. Lightly spicy! A nice, soft touch of malt on the aftertaste. I taste both standard German malts and the Belgian yeast. Some sweetness. Body is well rounded, seems a little compromised though. I could use more spice in the taste. Some faint alcohol as it goes down. A little too neutral/dull for my taste. This was good, but it wasn't exactly like other tripels."
"A high ABV and the presence of the alchohol flavor really don't make this a sessionable beer. It's not bad though, give it a shot if you wanna try it!"
"D - A good choice if price and or availability exclude you from a better Belgian option."
"A good strong Tripel for my tastes, and at $2 for a 12 ounce, an outstanding bargain as well."
"D: Score another hit for Victory. A very good domestic tripel."
"A crisp bitterness gives way to sweet and tart fruits. Apples and apricots. Lots of malt, with subtle spices. A bit of alcohol edge to the flavor develops as it warms."
"Cool label. Pours a lively golden straw with a slight haze. Off-white, rocky head laces nicely. Yeast, banana baby food, pepper, fruit cocktail and some alcohol on the nose. A little too yeasty? Spicy alcohol and peppery hops up front. Fruity (banana and passion fruit) candy sweet malt follows and swells. Warming, peppery, long, yeasty finish. A bit hot. Full body, syrupy feel. Decent, but not one of Victorys top offerings."
"Victory for me,one my favorite breweries."
"Aww man. This already is one GREAT tripel. I sang its praise in a previous review but it's even better on tap!! Finally got to have it on tap at Track 84 in Warwick, RI. It's the same ol' Golden Monkey but even more fruity tones are up front. I was surprised at how it was even more complex than it is in the bottle. Great beer got even BETTER."
"Pours a peach colored beer with a thick head that quickly disapates to a thin lacing. Scent of apricots and peaches are present.Very sweet and refreshing with some alcoholic overtone and no aftertaste. A great Triple to go along with the long line of great beers. Cheers to Victory"
"Unfortunately, if this were on tap in my area I could spend the whole day at the bar...maybe the weekend."
"It pours a nice golden color with about 1cm of white head. For those value such things, the lacing is pretty good. The nose is milder than the first bottle I had seven months ago. The smell of yeast is much milder and mixes decently with the spices. The flavor even better several months down the line. It starts with sweet malts and a touch of yeast and and finishes with spices. Much better balanced than the first bottle I had. All in all, when it's had some time to age, it's a rather drinkable beer. If you don't like it at first, give it some time. It does get better."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I like the medium, slick carbonation very much... it feels right for this beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't give me more of a reason to go back to the fridge and enjoy another one... drinkability is hindered previously. I would suggest finding the right culinary match for this beer and giving it a chance to shine, because it could use some balancing."
"Overall, this is not a very good tripel. It tastes like an amped up macro (malt-liquor-y) with a little spicy yeast funk."
"Drinkability-- a very vague term on this beer at its 9.5%ABV which caught me off guard as I found myself zig-zagging through the hallway afterwards. Rather drinkable if you're into the mood for a very honey-sweetish beer. Drinkable in whatever quantity your blood ABV can tolerate. I'd probably move on to a more balanced experience, however, given the opportunity. Very drinkable in whatever quantity you might enjoy, considering the hefty ABV%."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Mouthfeel is slightly harsh due to alcohol, about what's expected for a 9.5% ABV beer. Drinkability is good, I could have a couple more, and would like to, but a 6 pack would have me stumbling."
"The head starts out pillowy and white with at least some lacings as it falls away. It has a golden clear color to it that looks good. The smell is of sour fruit, like that found in Aventinus. There's nutmeg, plum, clove, and fig. The taste is light and nice with fruitiness and a warmth as it falls down the throat and the belly. The taste has a lighter fruitiness and has clove, fig, orange, and a little nutmeg in the finish, but not much. The mouthfeel is ok, but too carbonated and it doesn't have a smoothness I look for. Overall I didn't not enjoy this beer, but wouldn't think of having another right away."
"Straw orange in color, smaller off white head lasts as a partial film. Spicy aroma of coriander and pepper, it almost smelled a bit like corn. Some fruity aroma like apple juice, maybe a bit medicinal, and alcohol stings the nose. Spicy flavor, coriander and quite peppery, almost grainy as well. Strong alcohol in the taste as well, a bit too much, made the beer coarse going down, mouthfeel was not smooth at all, though it was a bit light and sparkling. A fair amount of fruity flavor and some yeasty/bready flavor, but not enought to smooth the beer out."
"D- I'm not a big fan of fruity beers so this one was a bit to fruity for me but still was alright. I'm glad I tried it."
"Poured a cloudy golden amber with two-finger head that rapidly subdued to a thin sticky film on top. Smell was minimal, but had hints of musty fruit. Taste was very sweet tropical fruit and raisins, with a nice alcohol warmth carrying through to the finish. Presence of hops was all but gone. Full syrupy mouthfeel. Preferred this cellared considerably more so than fresh."
"Poured in a thawed out chilled glass (the bar did not have a single glass not frosted). Appearce is what I expected, decent head retention and a good amount of bubbles from carbonation. Smell is malty sweetness but with some spice. Taste starts sweet, but soon turns quite herbal and some nice spiciness. Mouthfeel is pretty good, enough carbonation but I could have probably done well with slightly less. Drinkability was docked a point because the taste was a bit harsh near the middle. Some alcohol quite noticable in the taste as well as effect. I may go for this if no other belgian is around, but only if it's on special. It's probably not worth what most places ask for it. At 2.25 down the street, I will probably try it again."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, thick white head forms, great retention and sticky lace all over the glass. Smell is sweet, caramelly, alcohol and citrus through the middle, yeast, wheat, some honey as well. Taste is more or less the same, very sweet up front, wheat and alcohol, lots of citrus, yeast, very flavorful. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some significant heat going down. Not bad, pretty different, not as subtle as most tripels, but enjoyable."
"Too many flavors dominate that I don't care for. Tripell isn't my favorite style, but this is lower echelon compared many others I've had"
"Poured with just a hint of head. Body is aptly golden and inviting. No lacing. Nose is pineapple, spicy and evident of the alcohol this contains. Taste is more pineapple, a dollop of spiciness, pleasant alcohol, and what I can only describe as freshly cut grass. Very nice. Mouth is rich and velvety. Very smooth. The 4 years this one has had to mellow must have contributed a lot. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but dear lord I could drink a ton of these aged beauties"
"Sampled this in bottle form and on draft and both are equally impressive, although I think I prefer the draft version overall."
"Drinkability is good for the style do not guzzle this. MK"
"D: This was the first tripel I ever had, long before I knew what a tripel was. I remember liking it a lot more then. Quite a disapopinting offering from Victory; I don't think I'll be buying this again."
"D: Wow, maybe I should have eaten a little something before drinking this because I fell all warm and fuzzy in the belly now!! Great smelling and tasting tripel, good all the way around. Would for sure have this again. I bet this tastes wicked good from the source on tap. Thanks to nlmartin for this one, you da man!!"
"Pours a peachy-orange color with a pinky-finger sized head that vanishes fairly quickly (by the time I walked from the fridge to the living room) leaving only an outline around the rim of the glass. Looks cloudy and I can only see a few tiny bubbles near the surface. It smells sweet and citrusy--maybe even like melon, but I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't taste as sweet as it smells--it tastes more like cloves. When I was a kid we used to make clove-studded oranges at Christmas--Golden Monkey tastes like those smell--if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel is good--smooth and lightly carbonated. I would drink a bunch of these if I wasn't such a lightweight. ;)"
"I had this beer many months ago, after a trade with another BA member. Now that I have moved south I'm finding how common place this beer is, although its not changing my opinion of it at all. Pours a hazy golden color with a head the diminishes quickly. The smell is just what a Tripel should be, with hints of spices and many sweet notes. The taste is huge! Very sweet and spiced as it goes down, with almost a honey finish to it. The taste and mouthfeel are just what they should be dangerously easy to swallow, especially with 9.5% ABV!"
"I doubt this beer would make a good session beer. It is high in alcohol, so you would need to limit your self. The flavor is quite aggressive also. Too many would not be great. One, however, is good. I will definately drink this beer again. It is a winner."
"D-Not exactly the smoothest drinker, its not that bad either. You can tell its a bit higher in ABV."
"...and this is my ""monkey tale"""
"Pours a pretty nice golden color with a nice white head that stays for the whole glass. Smell has banana, some clove, lots of breadiness, there seems to be some pepper-like spices. As it warms more, the smell has a sour apple and overripe fruit smell to it as well. Taste starts out with a combination of apricot and banana, moving into some clove and a spicy bread finish. Medium carbonation and medium to full body. Pretty nice, I would probably have this once and a while, worthy of a try."
"M&D: so...ft in texture and rounded in mouthfeel, the full-flavoured beer benefits from a relatively light body and an overall balance... well-crafted! This is the first Tripel I've tried that's made-in-USA, and not bad at all it is. Yet somehow the yeastiness hasn't been able to create a deeper complexity that is THE key to the success of this beer style. Even so I'm quite satisfied that I've tried it and feel really impressed with what this great brewery could achieve..."
"Eric"
"Served in a stemmed glass, honey colored, with a half inch of fizzy head, which stayed along for the ride. The smell was fairly inviting, crisp and fruity. With the first sip, the front of the mouth really lit up, and I thought for a moment I would really enjoy this one. A strong rotten peaches aftertaste followed, along with alchohol. I don't see myself buying this one again, as I had a hard time finishing."
"Overall, quite flavorful, easy drinking and refreshing."
"It smelled aggressively spicy, a quality that I dig. The first taste hits me with its sugary sweetness. As it continues to warm, it grows ever more spicy and I don't know, tangy? After reconsidering my ""favorite style"" designation, I return to drinking. This will not be my last Golden Monkey."
"On tap at the Victory brewpub. The beer was served in a chalis and poured a hazy straw color with a substantial white head that left solid lacing on the glass. The aroma of the beer has some strong yeast notes along with lemon peel and other citrus tones. The taste also had a strong yeasty presence but was also complimented by the citrus tones and a hot burn of the abv on the tongue. The body is medium to full and makes for a drinkable triple."
"D - Drinking more than one of this would make me ill. It is a bit too spicy and sweet for sessioning. This is a fairly odd Belgian, but it tastes alright. I've had it before, but it's nothing I'll seek out. I will drink it if available though. Among those beers from breweries that don't specialize in a Belgian style brew, Golden Monkey is an above average Belgian, but when compared to the totality of Belgians, I'd say it is mediocre."
"Drinkability? I sure wouldn't mind another one. Very slick and a great American Tripel. Another winner from Victory!"
"Not a big Tripel fan, but this one is coo' with me. I won't get it reguarly but will definately try it again. Perhaps in a Victory mix case."
"Taste is the same but alot more of that fruitiness. Big fruit, apples and raisin. A more delicate sweet spice. Some alcohol in the mouth. Much less pronounced alcohol profile witha year on the bottle. A smooth brew with a quite sticky mouth. Builds as it goes. Sticky fruitiness lingers long. Pretty good tripel with a year on it. I was not that impressed with this brew fresh but it smooths out nicely."
"Victory comes through with a solid American version of the Belgian tripel. Despite the high alcohol, this is almost too easy to drink. Be careful with it, but just TRY to not enjoy it!"
"- Dan"
"D - easy to put back, sweet and wheaty and balanced a great tripel, easily one of my favorites"
"Sharp and tangy, a fine sipper  and a big saludos to BeerBeing for the brew!"
"M&D: Mouthfeel is creamy and slick. A bit to sweet for my taste, but a good beer none-the-less. I may try another Tripel just to get a better idea of the style."
"This beer is about a year and a half old and definately benefits from aging. Large yeast deposit in the bottle that adds a lot to the beer."
"Monkey's color is a hazy golden orange. Head is creamy and of medium height. The aroma is a combination of sweet and spicy smells. Candi sugar and malt combine with a peppery spice. The smell of orange peel overides the other aromas. All in all, a very fresh and inviting mixture of smells. A sip starts with a strong, tart combination of citrussy orange peel and spices. Candi sugar and bready malt flavors provide an excellent base here and work hard to subdue the powerful peppery spice. Midsip everything comes together to provide a complex, layered taste. Finish provides a strong coriander flavor than is accompanied by a tiny hint of alcohol. One downside, perhaps, the amount of coriander in the finish is just a bit to high for my tastes. I really enjoyed this one, lots of full, strong flavors come together to make a great brew."
"Thanks go to ski271 for hooking me up with this one."
"When I first got into craft beer I started with Belgian styles, and I always thought this was a good beer, but a step or two below the Belgian imports. After a couple years I still have that opinion. Still pretty good, but not exceptional."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable, and Golden Monkey definitely tastes like a well brewed beer. Check it out on tap, or pick up a six, but this beer may not stand up well to strict comparison with beers like La Chouffe, La Fin Du Monde, Duvel, or Delirium Tremens. A little too sweet and one-dimensional."
"P.S: I know a guy who can drink a case of this stuff in one sitting. During his lunch break. Proof that aliens do walk among us?"
"Pours a cloudy, chunky straw yellow hued beer into my chalice, room temp. Fluffly white head dissapates slowly, good lacing. Aromas of clove, hay, bubblegum, and some sugar. Flavors are typical of the style and not particularly noteworthy. A bit of heat from the alcohol, and it's quite dry. This is going down quite warming, and enjoyable. Reminds me of a Unibroue with its characteristic yeast qualities. Noticing the bottling date of March 1, 06, this bottle is really new and should have been cellared a bit to mellow out some of the hottness from the alcohol. Otherwise a quality beer."
"This is not a bad version of a tripel and is reasonably priced. The taste is way too sweet. The smell is good, some of vanilla and banana. It pours a nice head and lacing keeps up down the glass. There is a strange, however, aftertaste to the beer. Almost pale and skunky, which I did not care for. If the golden monkey is offered to me at a bar or someone's home, damn straight, I'll drink it again. But not one you'll find in my fridge very often."
"I'm only finishing this for the sake of a proper review. I won't drink it again."
"D- Enjoyable and drinkable. High ABV is right for the style but keeps the session short. Complex and delicious."
"Mmmm beer, to say the least. This is a beer that I will have to get again."
"A pretty solid tripel, just the slight metallic taste is a bit distracting."
"I really like half a bottle, but it doesn't agree with me the longer it spends in the glass."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Pours a cloudy straw color with some good carbination, forms a large foamy head that dissappears into a film after a minute or two. Smells like sweet malt with a little bit of hops (saaz i think). Taste has firm malt backbone, with increasing bitterness as the you drink the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty good, the high carbination dances on the tounge. A fairly drinkable triple, not the best but a good introduction to the style."
"This one is highly drinkable."
"In my opinion, much too sweet for the style. However, if you are new to tripels, this will suit you well. Would be interesting to see how these would age. If I can say one great thing about this beer, it's how well it hides its alcohol content. It may be sweet, but the 9.5% will knock you to the floor. Give it a try."
"Not as crazy as I remember it being, maybe my tastebuds have just adjusted some. Just a well-rounded, sweet tripel and a pretty tasty one. I'd like to see what some aging would do to it."
"Golden Monkey served as something of an introduction to the tripel style for me years ago, but I haven't had it in a while. Pours a cloudy, bright and light amber with a big head that fades to nothing. The nose is highly alcoholic, with a lot of fruit: pears, melons, and some berries make appearances. Taste is big and bright and sweet. Sugar cane sweetness competes with white fruits here. The mouthfeel is insubstantial, with a huge alcoholic burn. Overall, this one used to seem a lot better. It's still OK, but there are many, many better tripels out there."
"D good. I d have this again for sure."
"A very tasty refreshing Tripel. Not overly spiced. Quite drinkable."
"Tastes spicy (not hot) with a lingering sense of wheat. I enjoyed this beer over a reuben sandwich and it complimented the spicy pastrami very well."
"Not a bad beer, and a nice trip down memory lane, but I'd rather stick to drinking the California brewed Belgian styles."
"A drinkable beer, especially at 9.50% ABV, but the strong spicy-clove flavors make it something I wouldn't want too terribly much of."
"Overall I would say that for a tripel this is not the easiest beer to sip and enjoy. Its sharp and somewhat unpleasant taste really hurts its overall appeal. Most damaging is its lack of balance. It has some good qualities, but too many flaws."
"I think this is a very solid beer overall. Very respectable American tripel. I actually enjoyed it equally, if not more than, the St. Bernardus I had about a week ago. For my dollar, a good alternative when you don't want to dish out for a Belgian tripel."
"For some reason, I have not reviewed Golden Monkey even though I've enjoyed this numerous occassions. Since NC's Cap's been Popped, this has been a great go to beer. Let me tell you, this one packs a mighty punch . . . my buddy had this over Christmas as his final beer of the night and he was gone. The fruit and spices hide the alcohol and the balance is tremendous. Nice light color to fool any BMG drinker at first. Just a great all around Tripel."
"Chalk up another winner for Victory. I've yet to be disappointed with them, and this is no exception. Very nice american interpretation of a belgian style."
"Pours a slightly hazy strawberry blonde color, with some white bubbly head and pretty lacing around the glass. Smells spicey and lemony, barely vanilla-y. Tastes quite spicy- corriander, clove, black pepper. Belgian. Mouthfeel is a tad watery but still a bit bubbly. Sneakily, sneakily drinkable. 9+ percent? Never saw it coming. Great bang for your buck."
"The multiple taps of Golden Monkey Ive consumed over the past several weeks in an attempt to understand why so many people enjoy this beer were a complete waste of space in my belly where better beer could have been. Golden Monkey could be appropriately renamed Sugar Monkey. Its main aroma and flavor is sugar. The yeast works and so does the appearance but other wise I am done trying this beer. The syrupiness churns my stomach. Way, way too much sugar. Blech!"
"Went great paired with some creamy blue cheese and priscutto."
"Overall I like this beer. It's always a treat to curl up with the Monkey. This beer is very warming and reminds me of cold nights at my favorite college hangout which had this on tap."
"Drinkability - I could easily drink one of these after another, after another, etc., which is okay if you're not driving, because of the almost 10% abv., but watch in any case, this goes down easy and the abv is not obvious from taste ( much like decent wine, where you don't taste too much alcohol, so you keep drinking, thinking you're okay ,but then, bam!, seemingly out of nowhere you're buzzed real hard). Good stuff, that I as a hophead can see enjoying frequently as break from hops, and of course, another great offering (of so many other great ones) from Victory."
"Pours out a hazy golden orange with a thin head that leaves quickly. No lace to speak of. Smells really grainy with a wealth of yeast and booze. Actually, the more I sniff this, the more I realize that this smells like vomit. This is gross. This is really overly sweet with a too strong alcohol presence. This is grainy as all hell. I'd rather some malt liquor. Mouthfeel is sticky and gritty, but not too heavy, thankfully. I would drain pour this, but I just spent all my IRS refund check. Word."
"Victory's Golden Monkey would always be welcome in my glass, but I dont think i'd ever go out of my way to get some more. A better than average brew, but nothing to write home about."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is slick and oily as if its coating your mouth. Bold and heavy handed with a high abv that's slightly noticeable in your nose after a gulp. Slight burning sensation in the back of the throat. Smooth finish with flavors of bananas and other soft fruit. Pretty drinkable beer from Victory and a nice try at a tripel, although there are better tripel's out there for cheaper."
"It pours a pale gold/yellow color with a small head that fades rather quickly. It had some carbonation and was somewhat hazy. The first smell was slight hoppiness followed by an aroma of banana and a big yeasty smell at the end. It has a moderate to heavy mouthfeel with flavors that follow the aroma characteristic in order and strength. There is a slight bite of alcohol towards the end, but it is quickly masked by the yeast. The yeast holds on and will stick with you long after you swallow. All in all a decent Tripel. Another good beer by Victory...not their best, but still worth a try."
"-SS"
"Overall, a good beer, but rather simple."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel:the taste is very strong. This was my first triple(as well as my first Victory beer). I waited until the second bottle of the six pack to review. The alcohol was not as hidden as I expected it to be, but that was not a bad thing(the first bottle that I drank about a week ago seemed to have the alcohol more hidden). The carbonation was mid to high. For the abv being 9.5% this beer is very drinkable. I've found that the drinkability increases slightly as the beer warms."
"A great American Tripel. Big smooth malt presence balanced by the hops and spice. Complex and nice depth of flavor. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Bottle Pours a hazy light amber with a rocky white head. Head is mostly diminishing with decent lacing. Has a great sweet aroma. A whole bunch of fruits with a touch of bubble gum. Has a very light mouthfeel. Light bodied and lightly carbonated. But thats where the lightness ends, the flavors explode on your tongue. Very well balanced with a wonderful palate. Great duration and a fine finish. Its hard to believe this was brewed on this side of the Atlantic. Monk or monkey this is top notch."
"Simply put: the best Tripel I've ever had. Very drinkable, with a rich, complex flavour."
"Overall this is a pretty decent Belgian-style tripel; I was glad that Victory didn't try to Americanize this style by overwhelming it with Cascades or something."
"This is a golden beer with a large chunky white head. The smell is of lots of estery yeast thing like bannanas and a residual sugar sweetness with a touch of booze. The body is wuite thick on this beer we had a room temp, thins up a little as it gets colder. The taste is learge of a very active yeast that spun many different esters for the tongue to taste along with some spice to break up the fruit. Easy to drink and these crept up on me a little."
"Pours a bright golden yellow with a slight yeast haze and a finger of white head. Nose is musty yeast, caramel malt and lots of candied fruits. Taste starts of dry and musty with the yeast then transitions into tripel spices, coriander, clove, orange peel, pineapple and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is bubbly and champagne dry. Overall a well-interpreted American tripel, solid and tasty on all fronts."
"Although not a bad beer, this really pales in comparison to the Westmalles and St. Bernarduses of the world. For me, I'll skip the Monkey and stay with the Trappistes."
"Was poured an Imperial Pint at Ginger Man in NYC on 3/1/03. . . . Nice clear, orange color with a white head that lasted a little while but not too long. . . . First impression was the scent: fruity but I couldn't quite nail it down until about halfway through the pint, when I concluded that I was smelling (and tasting) bananas and cloves. . . . As for taste: yeasty and fruity, with the banana and clove tastes predominating but followed by a definite alcohol burn. I didn't know this was a 9.5% ABV when I ordered it, but I realized it packed a kick as I drank it (especially as I had 20 oz to go). . . . It reminded me of a stronger version of Wit, a Belgian-style craft beer brand that I used to come across about 10-12 years ago at beer festivals. . . . The battle in my mouth was between the fruity banana and alcohol burn, with the fruit winning most of the time. . . . Personally I didn't find it tremendously drinkable as the alcohol and banana tastes were somewhat overwhelming, especially as I worked my way down the Imperial Pint. But I do think it's a nice version of a Tripel."
"Although I did not care for this beer, it was still a great experience. I have some on my got list if interested."
"Mouthfeel- Overall a very earthy sweet palate with some damn good carnoation that helps to open up the taste buds to the jovial monkey like flavors of this tripel."
"Golden color with little head. Just a small lace. The aroma is not strong but has hints of yeast and bread. The taste is a little syrupy. Full bodied and an alcoholic sweetness. Drinkability is ok. The sweetness just is little too much. This is just not the ussual tripel. It lacks the clean fruity taste I am use to."
"drinkability: i think i could drink this one all night and to be honest, im pretty sure i have. i am sucker for tripels, and this one is up there as one of my american favorites."
"A fantastic push from Victory."
"A nice experience, although probably not something I'd go out of my way for. Will definitely try more Victory brews in the future (mmm Storm King)."
"Overall, I enjoy this American take on the Belgian Tripel and will go back to it in the future, when the mood strikes me. Smooth, fairly drinkable, and definitely with a character of its own."
"I've changed my rating numbers to reflect this...must have had a bad bottle the first time."
"Pours a very cloudy gold, with streams of tiny bubles rising to the semi-dense head. Two fingers high, and eggshell in color, it falls rather quickly and leaves spotty lacing. Classic belgian nose of yeast and play-doh, but not much else. Sweet pale malt flavor, with a good phenolic tartness a slight apple ester. The aftertaste is dry with floral hops and a very spicy alcoholic bite. Good example of style, except the bitterness/phenols are low for the very sweet and boozy flavor produced by the fusels and ester. Medium/high carbonation and nearly full body are only tarnishesd by the gin-like finish, which sets the drinkability below average."
"New edit May 2014. Having had this MANY times since the last review, I have to lower the ratings a bit. I mean, it's good and I enjoy it, and it's one of the go-to beers at a bar I visit. But it's a bit too forced and comes off a little 'fake'. Compared to others of its style it just doesn't match up to most of the imports. But I still really like this beer."
"It's a strong, fairly drinkable ale...did I say strong? Victory does it again....American Triple?! Enjoy!"
" Can't taste the insane 9.5% ABV but could still be a tough mission to down a few... regardless of the alcohol content. Another mid of the range brew from Victory, one that has the potential to be something fantastic, but falls short of expectations."
"Much more Belgian in profile than I first thought or understood. Subtle. A solid all around strong pale ale."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a bit too pronounced for continued consumption. Yet the pleasing flavor encourages another. Nice complexity; as if one could pick out new flavors with each beer."
"D- This has some nice qualities of a Triple but they are very faint and aren't strong enough. The alcohol boost the taste of hops and spice which are two flavors that stand out over the other flavors. Perhaps it is an ""American Tripel""?"
"no matter. this is a damn good tripel. only picked it up cause i thought i'll never be in PA, so i better get it while i can. glad i did."
"This beer poured a yellowish, cloudy gold color with a nice 1 inch head that lingers throughout. Smell was kind of fruity with a slight whiff of hops. The taste of this beer was way too sweet. I could detect some spicy, clove-like flavors but mostly all I could think about was the sweetness and the alcoholic punch that came with it. There are some much better representations of this style available. I would drink this again, but only if there were no other choices."
"beer is very drinkable can be enjoyed or a cold night or a hot day,"
"Cheers!"
"With that being said, this is an above average triple and worth picking up at your local store."
"Citrusy taste, apricot hits mid-palate. The finish is clean and smooth. Quite drinkable for a beer of this potency. I wouldn't put a 12-ouncer of this down half-finished."
"The color was a semi cloudy light medium yellow. There was not much smell I could pick up on. Maybe a little alcohol. The taste was of alcohol and bannannas. The alcohol presence was unmistakable. The mouthfeel was a little harsh due to the bite. I would not want to drink many of these in a row but it is not a beer I would not want from time to time."
"I find this beer to be too heavy for it's sweetness. Simply put, I served it to a friend and he didn't drink it, but was too polite to ask for something else. I tasted it again later and came to the same conclusion. If I had it in a bar, I would probably drink up, but at home I too would heitate to quaff. Too rich for my blood."
"Just an incredible beer from Victory! A golden brew with just a bit of carbonation an white colored head that lingers and leaves behind intense lacing. Aromas of candy, apricots, sour apples, and alcohol come out nicely. The taste is just so rich and delightful for this style. Normally, Tripels can be a bit much to swallow with lighter fruit only slightly masking the alcohol taste (unlike Dubbels and Quadrupels using dark fruits). This beer has the flavor profile of a Belgian Pale Ale with the texture of a Trappist ale. The rich fruits used simply add to the aftertaste in terms of sweetness and bitterness. The interplay of the flavors is what makes this beer so unique and such an excellent beer."
"The mouthfeel is spicy and slightly carbonated. The mouth becomes parched after a while. Not something I would want to drink more than one of, but glad I was able to try it."
"This beer poured a hazy apricot colour topped by a fluffy, white, 1 inch head. It was a bit rocky and produced a fair bit of lace. Bready, yeasty aroma with some citrus and floral hoppiness. Light alcohol as it warms. Initially sweet and bready, an earthy, spicy, sharp bitterness followed closely. Citrus at the mid and it finishes with a touch of coriander and lingering malt. Definite alcohol warmth in the finish too, along with a little phenolic character. Medium bodied and crisp, with ample carbonation and moderate dryness. Quite enjoyable overall, just a bit of weirdness in the flavour that didn't sit well at first, but improved as it warmed."
"This is a decent beer, although I think that Victory could do better. Bigger is often good, but this beer is relatively one-dimensional."
"Final Thought: The beer gets itself in gear the whole way through, from a weak appearence to a strong taste and a smooth/session beer. Interesting and brilliant!"
"This is a great beer for all kinds. It is a spicy, clear beer, but it goes down very easy. It has an interesting, complex flavor, leaning toward a hoppy edge. It is a tripel ale, which i have no idea what it means. i love the head on it, but its not great. I think overall the beer is dynamite, considering its high alchohol content (10%) for an ale. Overall, very impressed, but you might not wanna down a twelve pack."
"Drinkability: This ale is surprising drinkable. At 9.5%, one would expect the alcohol to dominate and prevent a drinker from having more than one. This ale defies that stereotype and gives a drinker a very pleasant experience."
"Drinkability- Odd and potent tripel, but still very good and would and will try again since I have another in the cellar. Maybe another year of rest will calm this one down."
"This was the first Tripel I have sampled so I have nothing to compare it to WRT the style. Golden Monkey poured a hazy golden color with very little head. The aroma: citrus and astringent qualities was fairly pronounced. The taste remined me of the Delirium Tremens I had last week but without the head or the stronger aroma. The alcohol taste was more pronounced that the DT. I don't think I would take this one for granted if I didn't know the ABV. The taste was better and more complex as the beer warmed up, but this is probably not my style of beer. Golden Monkey was ok, but for this hop head, if I was going for something similar in taste to Golden Monkey, I would opt for DT instead."
"Not too much going on here. I must say that Golden Monkey in a bottle lacks the unifying sweetness that is found when its on tap."
"Comparing this to the other tripels I liked (Allagash and St. Bernardus) this just doesn't stack up. This is a cloudy orange/yellow. Not bad looking, but meh to me. Smell is very alcoholic with a hint of sugar. Taste is fairly sweet, with a chalky spice to it at the end. Not really bold enough to classify it as unique, it relies mostly on the alcohol to get its flavor. I dunno, this one is a good beer, but it doesn't really do it for me when I know there are much better examples of the style out there."
"Certainly a belgian style brew but not quite as drinkable as i would have expected. It poured a very hazy light gold color with no lacing and a tiny head. Very small bubbles rising at amazing speed! Unfortunately this smell contained way too much essence of steel reserve which is fuckloads of apples and alcohol. It has sort of a weird cidery taste to it. The taste follows a similar road but the clove at least makes it beliganny. The mouthfeel was fizzy and light. Drinkability low to medium. I still might be able to reccomend this one i just need to have a few more(another day). and Jesuss, let it warm up first."
"This is another good beer from Victory. This is my first beer of this style so I can not compare this to others and am not sure how it fits in the style."
"Overall a great beer, i think. I could choose this over some belgiums, or be fooled this is a good belgium in a blind taste, but at the same time, i would choose many others of this style. very drinkable though. The alcohol is way too hidden in this one as i feel i could down a six pack of this in one night."
"Drinkability: This is not bad on the nose or palate. I just think there are better tripples available for the price."
"Even leaves some nice lace on the glass. Overall very good replication of the style."
"I am a fan of victory beers so the Golden Monkey had to be sampled even though not my favorite style of beer. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Cloudy orange color. Spice smell, not sure that spiced I am picking up. Very spicey taste and orange flavored finish. OK, but no my favorite Vicory offering."
"I detected a Rothchilds butterscotch taste that evolved into bananas and holiday spices that finished on a dry note. Nice and quite yummy. The feel was nice on my palate with a medium/light mouthfeel on nice carbonation. A solid brew."
"Pours a bright golden color with a creamy, stark white head that only makes a brief appearance. Powerful aroma of coriander and allspice, along with some nice Belgian ale yeast and light sweet malt. Palate is held down by a backbone of sweet, treacly malt, accented by the aforementioned spices and some fruity hops. Notes of peach and treacle are around in there, too. Body is a tad thin for a high-gravity beer, but still serviceable. A nice interpretation of an old-world style."
"The carbonation is light and the body is around medium flavor. Overall the beer is a great experience, but could use a little more balance from the stronger phenol and fruity/sweeter taste."
"Taste; pretty much follows how it smells, with the cloves, oranges, bananas, and those Belgian yeasts. There's just a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish. Mouthefeel is just a little thin for a Tripel. Overall this is a good beer that I will drink again."
"Powerful taste with a lot of residual sweetness. Extremely malty. Body could be a little heavier for a tripel. I like this beer but it is very sweet which lowers the drinkability score. Could have used a little more bitterness to offset the malt."
"Edit: One year later November of 2006 and I still feel the same way if not a bit worse. This beer is so fricking candied sweet even for a triple. Huge alcohol flash and hard to enjoy. I've heard this is better with even more time in the cellar and will hopefully re-review it over the next five years but for now even with a year on it. Avoid."
"Not very drinkable as it could hide the alcohol better."
"cheers..."
"Golden Monkey pours a hazy gold color with a nice big head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very yeasty with hints of citrus. Taste is very sweet and malty with some nice fruit complexities- I detect some banana and apple flavors. There is definitely some alcohol evident here as well. This beer has a great medium to full mouthfell with some very nice carbonation and pleasant dry and warming finish. This one can be a little rough due to the alcohol flavors but it is quite tastey and quite good overall."
"This brew pours a semi-cloudy golden orange color with a small white head that recedes within seconds. The aroma is of orange peel, and is huge. The taste is very juicy, with huge orange notes and slight alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice American Beer, and a fine tripel."
"A very good triple IMO. One that I would look out for."
"For such a high ABV, this brew is quite (dangerously) drinkable."
"This beer has been around for a long time. It's not a bad beer at all, but I'd be willing to bet that Victory is at least slightly embarrassed by this offering. It is a good selling beer, and if I were Victory I wouldn't change it, but I find it hard to believe that Victory Brewing Co. can't make a really good Belgian ale."
"overall: this is a tasty drink with nice characteristics, but i don't think this fits the bill for a tripel very well. tasty, so i ranked the taste higher than i would for a style match. alcohol should definitely be more well hidden, but makes a nice sipping brew. a nice try, but there are better trips out there."
"Cloudy yellowish orange with no head. Very urine-like in appearance. Smell is faint, but inviting. A bit of sugary sweetness with some phenolic character lets you know this is a Belgian style beer. Also some toffee which doesn't show up in the taste. The taste is a well merged blend of peppery spiciness, sugary sweetness, and some yeasty breadiness. If one aspect dominates, it's definitely the spices though. Finishes a bit dry with barely perceptible alcohol and lingering sweetness. Hardly any bitterness here at all. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but a tad grainy - the spiciness doesn't help. Definitely not bad, but it takes a lot for a tripel to impress me these days, and this doesn't live up to some of the better examples of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head above the clear golden brew. Head lasts well, with average to good lacing. Aroma is malts and spices, as expected for the style, but with a bit of a sour undercurrent. Taste starts with pale malt sweetness, sliding into some spicing (but not too much), and then a slight alcohol warming to close. Mouthfeel is pretty good, although nearing the cloyingly sweet line, and drinkability follows the same road."
"Smells pretty bready and yeasty, maybe a little spiced. I like it. In the taste, besides those characters, the alcohol makes an appearance after being notably absent in the nose, but it behaves itself for the most part. There's a substantial bready finish to Golden Monkey that I'm enjoying particularly. Feels light and fluffy in my mouth, rounding out what is a very pleasant beer to sip while cursing the Yankees."
"Delicious. The mineral and alcohol give it some backbone."
"The appearance is a crisp honey color with a tightly packed pure virgin white head that clings decently to the glass and maintains its shape the entire glass. Smell was heavy on the cloves, orange peel and coriander. Smells like a belgian wit to me. Not as fruity as I hoped for in a triple. The taste and mouthfeel is what turned me off on this beer. The huge alcohol rush overpowers everything and stings the mouth like a bad malt liquor. The spiciness of the alcohol and cloves, make this seem unbalanced. To be honest, I don't think this is necessarily a bad beer, but for a tripel, I think it is a joke. This should be taken off the shelves and re-introduced as the first ""double belgian malt liquor wit""!"
"End notes: Dissapointed with this brew. Victory is capable of so much better, I expected this to knock my socks off like all of their other offerings I've had so far- That's not to detract froim a solid brew, however. Just lacking that extra something."
"Slàinte!"
"A very flavorful tripel - really struck me as somewhere in limbo between a weisbier and strong pale flavor-wise, as this beer has a lot of depth of yeast flavors that go beyond what I normally find in a tripel. Poured a hazy apricot. Funky yeast aromas abound. Candy sweetness offset by sharp bittering and a piercing but pleasant alcohol bite. Yeasty flavors play throughout. Very approachable, in spite of the higher abv. Well executed. Thanks to Far333 for the treat."
"A different ale from one of the best brewers in America.Great two finger head and a clear golden color thats a little light,but not bad,the carbonation makes up for it.This taste a little too much ""wheat"" for my taste,but still not bad.The label says its a spice ale,but not overly spicey.This packs a punch at 9.5% alc."
"I have to give tryon distributing and Victory credit, my bottle has a bottled on date of 9/19/05 and i bought it on the 22nd...damn fine turnaround . Pours into a chimay chalice a beautiful, sparkling hazy gold color with a thick, frothy white head that retains well for a 9.5% brew. Aroma is very belgian; spices (corriander and anise), candied sugar, bready and slightly musty malt aroma and some light penolic aromas, nice and authentic but not particularly inviting. Flavor is complex, with notes of phenols, toasted bread, horseblanket, candied sugar, earthy and mineraly hops, spices (corriander, clove anise), and fruity yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium to light body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly bitter herbal finish with a noticeable alcohol bite. Interesting beer, definately think cellaring could improve this tripel (its very, very fresh right now) but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel was very good, the carbonation leaping out and grabbing the drinker's attention. Very drinkable, but watch yourself with the high alcohol content. A most wonderful tripel from Victory."
"Wow. My first beer from Victory and it's really good. Poured out to a golden color with some haziness and a nice head that came down to about 1/8 of an inch. Higher carbonation. Aromas of buttery malt, spices and some breadiness. The taste is full and rich, following the smell; flavors of malt, sweetness that is similar to cider, and some bitterness from the hops. Some buttery like yeast toward the finish. The carbonation makes the flavors very vivid and present. Very nice. Mouthfeel is not too filling, yet not weak or light. This has high drinkability despite the 9.5% ABV. This is a great American Made Tripel. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is hurt somewhat by the noticeable alcohol. Not that it's overwhelming, but I find myself aware that I am drinking a stronger beer. Otherwise, I enjoy this beer immensely."
"Bottom line is that it's good, but not quite like the Belgiums I've come to love. Not that Belgiums are the only ones allowed to brew a triple. But they have an understanding for the complexity needed to make it world changing. It's not all that cheap either. I'm not turning it down. Not at all. I'll happily finish the rest of these. But it's not changing my perception in the least."
"The smell and taste was dominated by an unpleasant belgian yeast taste and not much else. There were subtle hints of fruit, but they were overshadowed by the yeast. Not a balanced beer at all."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden/honey color with barely any head. The appearance was good but it had a strange smell which might mean I had an off bottle. You can really taste the alcohol but not enough to stop from drinking. After awhile, it does get to be a bit too much for me though. Finished it but last few drinks didn't go down easy."
"Not the greatest tripel specimen, nor the greatest victory beer, but enjoyable nonetheless"
"Pours a cloudy golden. reminds me of a wheat. Not much of a aroma. I was not impressed with this beer. It had a bitter finish that I just did not care for. The initial taste was ok,but the finish just left a bad taste in my mouth. i did not finish th bottle. I would not buy this beer again. I guess I'm in the minority here."
"golden monkey, i could not think of a better name for this beer if i had to. it is a cloudy golden colour. taste was fruity and i could taste the alcohol quite a bit. but i enjoyed it. i also could taste the spices a bit. i'm not going to attempt to name them because i have no idea, but they did indeed add a good quality to the beer."
"This poured out of a large bottle a nice golden orange with slght cloudiness. One inch of head, and not very lacy. There is strong citrus, licorice, sweet malt and hops on the nose. It's very sweet smelling. The taste is almost like a creamsicle. Citrusy& malty sweet. The aftertaste has some bitterness, but its esay on the palette. Very high ABV."
"Very tasty brew! I had as desert after a steak dinner, and was very happy! Powerful though, which will greatly limit how many I'm can drink."
"Bottled on May 22, 2003. Pours a cloudy yellow, nice carbornation with a nice little white head. Leaves a nice bit of lacing after pour. There are some sweet and fruity scents. The taste is very sweet with a little bite, but for being a 9.5% ABV not much of an alcohol taste. Light in body, and very drinkable. Compared to the one or two tripels I've had, this is very unique. Give it a shot if you can get your hands on some."
"Very unusual and very delicous, this Golden Monkey."
"This monkey makes a dangerous quaff because it is incredibly drinkable."
"Victory Brewing is a relatively new but great addition to the Texas market. I hadn't had a tripel in a while, so it was a nice change of pace. It poured a slightly cloudy golden yellow from the bottle with only a slight head that disappears quickly. Aroma is light, but a little fruity and sweet. Some lemon, banana and spices detectable in the flavour. The higher alcohol content is only slightly noticeable. A good drinkable beer, but I've had better tripels."
"Pours a hazy light peach with a quickly receding head. Smell is good, but very subdued. Subtle fruit and floral aromas with a touch of alcohol come through. The taste, while not exceedingly complex, is good. Slightly sweet fruit (apples?) and subtle corriander flow nicely into a moderately dry finish. Nice crispness in the mouthfeel from the carbonation gives just the right amount of bite to each sip. I do not detect any hint of the 9.5% ABV in the taste. As I should have expected the beer is getting much better as it warms up and I write this review--numbers have gone up a few times. Drinkability is good. I couldn't have more than a few of these, but as its not overly sweet, its the closest thing to a ""session tripel"" that I have seen in a while."
"Taste is malty and floral with a hint of fruitiness in the background. The fruits remind me of a lemon/peach combo. Mouthfeel is slightly dry but pleasant and seems like it would be a good desert beer. Drinkability is dangerously high. These are 9.5% and you really would never know from the taste or the smell. The style is the only thing that would tip you off."
"The bottom line: a slightly above average trippel. Worth trying, but I probably won't buy it again."
"Poured a slightly hazy gold with yellow edges. Medium white head with short retention and no lacing. Smell clearly matches the Belgian Tripel style. Yeast, bread and alcohol are the main things I could pick out. Taste is more impressive than smell. I found a nice blend of soft floral and sweet malty elements with more abrasive bitter and peppery notes. Lots of yeast in the flavor too, in a pleasant way. I have had more complex examples of the style, but this is still and enjoyable beer."
"Pours a peachy golden color with a finger of head that falls to a very healthy coating over top. The nose is light banana, lemon and yeasty spiceyness. There is a light raisin and underlying creamy aroma as well. The flavor is more raisiney than the aroma would lead me to believe. The banana and lemon are in the background. The mouthfeel is big and full, with the creamyness. Overall, an okay beer. I'd like the flavor is not doing it for me. I'd probably have it again."
"Drinkability is good but it's a bit too good for it's own good."
"D - . Tastes great and leaves you wanting another sip. Not heavy tasting at all and very crisp. Watch it though, a very strong ale that could sneak up and leave you in store for a shitty morning if you let it's extremely drinakable taste take over."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full and crisp. Not much carbonation. Coats the mouthwell and the flavor lingers for a while. Drinkability seems okay, something about this makes me only want this one for now. Not my favorite triple, but good nonetheless."
"Hazy golden yellow average sized head with no apparent lacing. Smells of light malty fruits (banana). Initial taste gives off spicy bitterness. Flavor mellows to phenol fruitiness. This brew is a bit too spicy for my tastes, but not bad American Belgian triple though."
"Mouthfeel is light but slick. Not the greatest tripel I've found but certainly a great attempt. I agree with many others, it is a bit one-dimensional but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Nicky likey."
"Entry shows extra-zippy carbonation along the tongue and a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Midtaste begins bright as the flavor leads with sugar...quickly followed by a triple dose of malt. The finish leads with whole flower hops and fruity overtones, only to be replaced once again by the rich, complex malts and a slow Belgian yeast fade."
"Notes: This is it for me as far as American Tripels go. My favorites are still from overseas (Westmalle, LaTrappe, St. Bernardus), but this one is very acceptable to me."
"Overall very drinkable. Perfect for summer and with spicy foods."
"Mouthfeel is on the light side. Drinkability is OK nothing really negative to say just not as flavorable as some of the better Tripels out there."
"After waiting a LONG time for Victory beers to come to Texas, I was excited about trying this beer. Quite a disappointment. Sort of the Coors Light of the Tripel world. The beer poured a haze golden. Not much else to talk about. The aroma was muted. The taste was slight. The mouthfeel not impressive. The alcohol gave me a quick buzz but added nothing to taste or mouthfeel. Sorry just not impressed."
"This is another slow drinker. Could probably drink more of these than I should, but the alcohol flavor and feel really keep you aware of what you're drinking. It's good to pace and enjoy, in my opinion anyway. Great beer. Victory knows what they're doing."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a decent head. The head though thick and about 1 or 1.5 fingers, disapates fairly quickly. The scent first noticed is the yeast witha slight citrus and sweet spice. The flavor is the same, yeasty with sweet spices. Very powerful beer. Great american tripel. Easily up there with my other favorite belgian style tripels."
"A decent attempt. I'm interested in what some age will do to the two I have remaining."
"Very interesting, complex, and tasty. And quite deceptively strong: it's hard to believe such a light refreshing beer tops 9% alcohol."
"Cloudy golden brew w/ a huge white head. To the nose I didnt get to much except some sweetness and malt. As I tiped the glass back to take a sip the white head took a minute to get though. With my nose covered in this beautiful head i finally got to the good stuff. WOW! Loads of malt. Tons of sweetness, with a apricot middle. The finish is warming with a fade of apricot then it returns quickly to the nose. A great brew despite the week smell and appearance. This was my first tripel and was deeply impressed."
"Had this over at the Chapter House. Slightly golden body, big white head that held its own throughout the drinking. Nice and sweet aroma, corriander, yeasty. Really sweet taste, lots of bananna, maltiness. Quite a bitter kick at the end. Quite drinkable as well for 9.5% abv. Certainly worth a try, won't be dissapointed."
"pours a nice golden color hence the name. has a nice white foamy head that splits quite quickly, and leaves a bit of lacing. smells like flowers and alcohol, tastes like flowers alcohol and lemon, and its a bit syrupy. i think it has some sort of spicy yeast in it. can't drink very much of this in one sitting, however it feels good in your mouth. an overall good offering from victory, so go out and get yourself some."
"Tart upfront, but then turns cloyingly sweet. Alcoholic/peppery notes towards the end. Not very smooth or balanced. Glad I only bought a single of this."
"This poured form the bottle into a tulip glass a bright, slightly hazy gold with a thick white head that was refreshed by a stream of champagne bubbles. The aroma had bread dough, citrus/orange and a mild spice finish. The flavor favorably reflected the aroma with a bright lemon citrus and a slightly yeasty character. The finish had a slight alcohol warming and a lingering pepper character. It has a slick, yet full mouth feel, and a good drinakbility."
"This bottle was brewed on may 4th 2004. It has aged really nice in my opinion. It pours a hazy dark yellow and has a nice white head and lot's of yeast floaties. The aroma is very sweet and fruity and the yeast imparts a nuttiness. The taste is very sweet upfront and then the alcohol tries hard to overcome the nutty, fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is very full like any good tripel. This is one of the best tripels I have ever had. Kudos to Victory for brewing this winner."
"Served from a 750ml bottle in a Corsendonk glass. Pours a golden-amber color, very clear with a little bit of a white head that quickly vanished. Fruity aroma, maybe a little bit of bread thrown in. Delicious on the first sip; quite sweet and malty, with the alcohol extremely well hidden. Goes down too easily for a 9.5% beer! Another great product by Victory; I'll have to cellar a couple of these and see how well they age."
"Overall = I like this one. Recommended for fans of Tripels. The sweetness is nice and it's not overkill."
"A very enjoyable brew that would be an excellent kick-off to any session or pair well with some lively/spiced foods. Will enjoy this one anytime opportunity allows."
"Drinkability: Good. Another one of those undercover wolves that has the potential to do a number on an unsuspecting drinker. I cannot detect any alcohol presence in any aspect. Could be dangerous. Overall a good show, although I can't think of a time when I would want to drink this."
"Mouthfeel was great, the taste seemed lacking in direction, the alcohol not hidden well. I'm glad the bottle was aged, or I suspect this beer would've been a club-handed brute."
"Drinkability: defiantly not a session beer."
"Pours a clear golden yellow hue with a thin white head. Smell of grass and subdued malt, with some bready notes, and some alcohol. Malty taste with mild fruitiness yields to warming alcohol. There is also a noticeable yeast presence. Crisp carbonation balances a bready and smooth mouthfeel. Finish includes some citrous hops and of course alcohol. Not a bad beer, but not awe-inspiring. I may try this one again at a later date."
"poured a beautiful golden color with decent white head and bubbles that just will not quit. The smell is hard to describe (bananas??) but I love it. The first taste is superb, and each additional sip is even better. The felling it leaves in my mouth is complex and long-lasting. A winner !!!!"
"WAY TO GO VICTORY!!! Keep up the good work and keep those Monkeys coming!!!"
"Maybe aging this for a bit would do it some good?"
"Overall, this is a bit too slick for me, as I like my tripels to be a bit more heavily carbonated. Nevertheless, the flavors are solid and this is certainly a beer that I enjoyed."
"Pours a golden (yellow with shades of amber-orange) color with a uninspiring wispy head. Lots of suspended matter in this brew. For sure, its not particularly pretty. Aroma of alcohol, yeast, malt, and a wild background of sour-spiciness. The smell is actually pretty nice. Theres a big, intense malty sweetness. That, coupled with a sharp alcohol warming are the centerpieces of this beer. They dont particularly blend well with the aroma. Its a thick, syrupy brew. Its certainly a Belgian style beer, but it doesnt meet the bar set by the style. Generally, Ive been very happy with Victory. Unfortunately, this one is way off the mark."
"This is a good beer, though I'm not sure I'd call it a Tripel- it is almost too cautious in its approach. A stronger aroma and flavor profile would help balance out the alcohol presence."
"Another winner from Victory."
"Ultimately, this is a good beer. Good enough that I could see myself drinking a lot of it. However, it's a drastic failure as a ""tripel."" Rating it against the style, I can't help but slam it a little..."
"Pouring a golden honey color into a tulip glass, it pours with a 1/4 inch head that is rather thin with some decent cling to the glass- maybe a slight haze to this one. Aroma is some hops along with a strong sense of white grapes, vanilla, and spice (cloves/nutmeg). Alcohol burns the nostrals a bit also. Taste is mainly of cloves (spice), which was nice, along with the grape flavor and a slight hoppy finish. The alcohol comes through on flavor at the end as well with a nice drying effect. The carbonation plucks the tip of your tongue, but then gets very smooth throughout in the middle with a drying alcohol finish. Overall, I love Victory and find anything they produce fun to drink! Yes have some!!!"
"Pours a golden, near honey color. Smells spicy but with a hint of sweetness as well. Strong alcohol aroma. Tastes sweet, but also very strong alcohol flavor. Unlike other beers I've had. Mouthfeel is good, fairly thin. Drinkability not bad, not the best thing in the world but decent if you want something different. Tasty for what it is."
"Appearance: Dark gold in color with little head which dissipated almost immediately. Lacing is there as you sip, but falls rather quickly. Smell: Spicy with hints of orange and definitely yeasty. I'm starting to smell the bouquet now as it warms. Taste: Yeasty and a strong alcohol aftertaste. Not as malty as I expected. Yeah, definitely lots of alcohol as my stomach is warming up after that sip. Very sweet with herbal spice flavor. Mouthfeel: Rather nice the way it rolls off the tongue, but the alcohol aroma which comes up through the nose is a little annoying. Drinkability: Almost like a good champagne, it tastes good at first but you can't drink a lot of it."
"Overall- I can certianly appreciate Victory trying this style, yet this is too sweet and thrown together for most connoisuers of this style and it is BRUTAL on those who've never tried the style before (like my father for instance) so while I give props to Victory for trying the style I can honestly say I wish this would be replaced in their variety pack. Not a bad beer in any respect, just not great for the style, although I would still love to try this on tap sometime. Drink this at room temp, it's much better than cold"
"Cloudy orange/gold pour with a small white head that is pretty foamy but disappears in a snap. Smell is yeasty and spiced, maybe with a bit of anise I wasn't expecting. Taste is also yeasty with a nice touch of hops and some spices. The only way to describe the taste is ""rich."" It's very sugary, but the aftertaste is pleasant and leaves some lingering orange flavors which I prefer to the actual taste of the beer. The mouthfeel is creamy. For its ABV, this is a pretty drinkable beer, as it's not really all that boozy. For me, though, it's just not as good as the rest of Victory's offerings. I wish they would pull this one out of the Variety of Victories sampler case and replace it with one of their other brews. Not terrible, but I won't be seeking it out anytime soon."
"Pours cloudy honey colored with little head, nice lacing. Smell consists of yeasts, sweet malts, and some hops. Taste follows with nice rich yeasts, mildly sweet malts, and medium hops to round it out to a nice robust flavor. Just a bit of kick at the end. A very decent brew."
"Notes: I'm not a big fan of Belgians and from what I've read, this is the exception and not the norm. An enjoyable beer but I still prefer my American hop bombs or my Russian Imperials. I would definitely recommend this to all."
"(The bartender told me she tries not to recommend this beer to younger beer drinkers!)"
"Despite the high ABV%, I could throw down a few of these in an evening...another keeper from Victory!"
"You gotta be ready for this one. After a few sips, your mood has been mellowed. This is a very pale light in color. But don't let that fool you, you silly monkey. There was plenty of carbonation and mouthfeel in my bottle. The lacy beads clung to the sides of the glass very nice. Some bottles I had were a little hazy. Not this one, it was crisp and clear looking. Very nice. Nice Belgian yeast and hops, although not too many hops. Or were they over powered by the pure amount of Belgian Candi added? I think it's true Belgian counterparts aren't as potent (close but not quite). It drinks very smooth for that much alcohol. Makes you want to reach for another, if you can find it."
"This is a pretty good little beer (although perhaps one best enjoyed infrequently). Very potent, with a warming quality that's perfect on a cold night here in the nation's icebox."
"from the bottle. poured a cloudy golden to honey with a white head. aroma,spicey, lemon orange rinds, cinnamon, yeast, whet, musty, and hints of alcohol. flavor, fruity, orange, dryness, some sourness, honey, spices. lemon. not to bad but I think I should of had this earlier was bottled july 20th of 04"
"I am in love."
"The beer in the glass looks like a cross between orange juice and apricot juice with pulp dispersed throughout. The head is a little on the weak side with little lacing as I drink. The beer smells inviting and seems true to a Triple but the taste tells otherwise. This is too sweet for a triple in my opinion but yet a good tasting beer. You can definitely taste the alchohol in this one. Mouthfeel is not true to a Triple either. It's too thick and sweet but yet very drinkable in my opinion. I gave this one a 4 based upon it's merits as a beer, not because it is true to it's style."
"10-month old 750mL with cork. Pours golden, yeasty cloudy, leaving decent spotty lace. Good fruity, yeasty, spicey flavor, like I remembered. This remains a unique brew that makes each time I drink it a special time, but doesn't encourage me to drink it more often than a truly special brew does. Age doesn't seem to improve it as much as other tripels, but it's hard to imagine how much better it could be. It deserves the original rating I gave it more than 1 year ago."
"Chilled the 750 ML bottle, (bottled on 10/10/02) to proper temperature and poured to produce a vigorous head (as instructed on the label.) Its color, a warm mocha almost as fluffy as meringue. This brew is slightly cloudy, the color of clover honey and has a light carbonation. The nose offers up essences of honeyed oranges and malted milk chocolate augmented with a malty-nuttiness-absolutly delicious! The yeast is fresh, young and clean on the nose. There is a pleasantly complex citric element to the taste, akin to key limes, but not overstated, definitely subdued as this acidic element makes this brew crisp, bright, and refreshing. The after taste lasts easily for several minutes! For a brew with some weight and character, it is quite drinkable en-mass. Never noticeable, the alcohol is buried well beneath the massive flavors imbedded well within this brew. The mouth feel is a tad lean for the style, but this is by no means a criticism whatsoever, as this is the only thing that I could find even remotely debatable. A fantastic, glorious, blockbuster beverage!! Bravo Victory!! Again!!"
"Drinkability is pretty good as there is no off flavors and not to much of the high abv is noticeable, goes down pretty good."
"There are a lot of othrs in this category that I would buy before this one, however for the price I would buy Victory's trippel again when strapped and looking for a trippel."
"This is a seriously rich beer. Very sweet and malty. Actually a little too sweet and malty for me, and that's saying a lot. Anyone who reads my reviews would notice I like my beers big, malty, and somewhat sweet. This was was just too much for this guy. Had a nice head to it, with good retention in it."
"still much thanks to felonius phil for the sample"
"Tasted: 12/02/05"
"OK, maybe I shouldn't have drank this 750 by myself, I did it in the name of research dammit! Pours a hazy golden orange with dense white head. Aroma is packed with fruity, yeasty spicy notes that tell me this will be good. Initially sweet/sour with a nice balance of fruit and spice. Alcohol is evident and warming. Just a tad too carbonated, I prefer a softer mouthfeel in a triple. Towards the end of the bottle I'm picking up on a slightly astringant metallic taste(is it the beer or is it me?). Overall a nice beer, I believe would definately benefit from ageing."
"This is quite a bit more enjoyable than I was expecting, most American interpretations of Belgian beers use too many spices, in fact much of the Belgian character is really derived from their yeast and not spices. That being said I do like the mix of spices and fermentation characteristics found in this beer."
"The mouthfeel is pretty sharp, and the alcoholic content is definitely apparent."
"Bottled on Aug 11, 2004. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a goblet. Cloudy orange color with a very small head that lacks retention and lacing. Bready malts with light hops and slightly fruity. Very sweet and acidic flavor. Light to medium bodied with a heavy alcoholic finish. Wow, this beer is STRONG! Not a bad offer from Victory, but there are much better examples out there for this particular style, and much better products produced by this brewery as well. Skip over this one and go straight for an authentic Belgian strong ale."
"Overall Impression: The beer makes an impact! Strong alcohol, but hidden alcoholic tastes. Firm spices with sweet strong fruit tastes. This is a memory maker, but it would be a devastating session beer at 9.5%. I acquired the bottle in a trade and am shamed to say Ive forgotten with who (beermail me for appropriate citation and thanks). If you live in a monkey infested area, I recommend catching one and giving him a good home."
"A raw and rollicking Tripel, but not for those who dislike things spiced up."
"Drinkability: This beer gets better as it warms up. It is not a tremendous tripel, but it is certainly worht a try."
"Cloudy yellow. Invigorating spicy taste. Yeasty, lemony. below average tripel.Crisp and fresh on-tap at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse. Thought it might be better in the bottle but was partially wrong:Had a bottle a year and a half later, too yeasty and thinnish. Good level of carbonation."
"An enjoyable Belgian Tripel."
"That witbier citrus coriander dominates the palate. Overall sweet, reminding of honey. The 9.5% is imperceptible! And it's not even THAT sweet or spiced or having anything that's blatantly covering up the booze. Cool. An interesting hop texture mixes over the sweetness in the aftertaste, which is also sweet, like candy apple. Lightly spicey. Developed and balanced--and even seemingly light."
"This beer pours a cloudy golden color with a small white head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and full of citrus notes with a little sweetness. The flavor is spicy and a sweet citrus. I did not like the taste, as the one I had was very sour and unenjoyable. Usually I like Victory products, but this one didn't do it for me."
"Mouthfeel is think and chewy, even a bit syrupy. The drinkability is pretty good as well. However I don't think I could have more than two of these at a time...flavor wise, for me, this is a brew to enjoy every now and again."
"Another good offering from Victory, though certainly not their best. I personally enjoyed Weyerbacher's Merry Monks Ale more than this tripel. But this one has more of a Belgian quality to it, which is very nice. A very good beer definitly worth a shot."
"12 oz. bottle pours a clear straw colored liquid with a minimal head. Has a grainy, spicy sweet bread smell. It is medium bodied with sweet and spicy flavors of butterscotch, vanilla, lemongrass, and black pepper. Finishes with a tangy alcohol taste. A pretty good triple for sure."
"On draught at Winking Lizard in Columbus and served in a snifter. This beer pours a lightly hazy orange/gold color with a very thin white head. Thin and quick lacing. Aroma of spices, fruit, wheat and a little alcohol. Crisp body with a nice blend of fruit (apple and banana), spices, warming alcohol and sweet candy. The finish is long and sweet with a pinch of peppery hops. This is a very good Tripel that is immensely enjoyable on tap."
"Bottled Aug 11, 2004. Pours a lightly hazed golden yellow with a white head. Aromas of sticky pale malts, candi sugar, white bread, spices, alcohol and a slight bit of orangy fruitiness. Sweet and warming on the palate, residual spicing shows up moreso in the finish. Alcohol's noticable, but a melange of flavor helps keep it under wraps. Fruitiness, bordering on tropical, melds pretty well the alcohol warmth and the spicing and dryness in the finish helps to bring everything full circle. Not a bad tripel at all, quite enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with some tingling sensation. Goes down very easily. A decent brew all around. Victory is simply amazing."
"Malty citrus nose. The flavor was mostly coriander, peppar, and a nice yeasty spiciness in the back. All three flavors stayed with it throughout the beer, even as it warmed. Didn't read any reviews prior, and was surpised to see that it was both a Tripel and had a very high ABV. The alcohol is completely hiding deep within the flavors. I had no idea. I was initially going to rate it lower, thinking it was a Hefe with no real complexity. The Golden Monkey is a tricky beast..."
"Overall this is a great triple with complexity -- a nice blend of spice and fruitinesss."
"This is very drinkable at 9.5% ABV. Very good American interpretation of this style. Another great offering from Victory Brewing in PA."
"12 ounce bottle. Bottled on Nov 11, 03."
"At 9.5% abv this one goes down a little too smoothly. I've had this as a session beer in the past and it definitely did me in. 3 or 4 in a sitting is definitely my limit with this monkey, even though I crave more."
"It is quite a tasty beer, and very drinkable, but not your typical tripel. However, still very enjoyable."
"This poured out a very hazy golden orange with a tall white head that drops to a ring of scattered bubbles. Strong smell of spice in nose with I believe orange peel being the most recognizable, there was some sweetness mingling with the spice as well as earthy hop notes. The taste had spiciness to it as well that went great with the fruity sweetness. Good creamy mouthfeel and the alcohol is hidden extremely well for being so high. Not you typical Belgian Triple but a good beer not doubt. Not one of the best triples I have had but a beer I do return to quite frequently just because it is good."
"after your first bottle you'll feel very warm and possibly light headed. if you've drank high ABV beers before the effects of the alchohol should be nothing but warming. i consider this a big beer because of it's high ABV and the richness of it's flavor. if you're new to belgian ales this would be a good introduction to the style. very easy drink."
"A North American take on a Tripel this beer makes its presence known. Hazy Orange with a monster head , this beer needs a goblet to strut its stuff. The main flavours are spicy orange notes with hints of the alcohol . The beer starts off sweet but ends dry which is a plus in drinkability. This is a well made Tripel with lots of panache and boldness."
"Bottle: Poured a golden hazy beer with a medium head with average retention. Aroma is quite spicy, real funky spices have been added in here. Taste is quite sweet at the beginning with what seems like wheat and then spices kick in providing a nice ending. I must say this is quite spectacular. Body is above average but carbonation is bit weak. Overall, I would say I very much enjoyed this fine beer."
"This beer was a hazy light orange with a nice frothy white head that quickly reduced to a thin film. There is a great spicy, yeasty aroma. The flavor is sweet, spicy, fruity, and yeasty. It has that distinctive Belgian flavor and smell. The mouthfeel is great for this style. It is a delicious beer."
"Still, I could drink the stuff. Why not? Ok, maybe I couldn't drink a lot of the stuff - it's, um, strong, but, hey, I could drink the stuff."
"This is a little lighter in feel and really doesn't give that nice buzz that Railbender's 6.8% leaves you with. If someone buys one of these, you def. will not be disappointed, just don't spend your own cash."
"Poured into a tulip glass, this beer appeared a golden orange, much like the color of a a cloudy apple juice, with a 1 1/2 finger head. The Immediate aroma was of overripe bananas (another BA mentioned nail-polish... that's right-on!) with sub-aromas of sweet spices and the expected earthy smells of Belgian yeast. Taste was immediately candy-sweet and cloves and pepper spicy but was followed by a wollop of tangy fruits like green apples and bananas that almost left me forgetting the initial tastes. By the time I swallowed this beer, I was left with a Riesling-like after taste... very cool. It's medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation, with bubbles that blanket your tongue, really accentuating the spicy flavors I mentioned earlier. As the beer warmed, more and more esthery scents were released and if I took a deep enough inhale, I could really detect the alcohol. It seems very drinkable at first but towards the end of the glass, you really start feeling warm and fuzzy (I make it sound like a bad thing) so I'm not sure if I'd go for number two but for enjoying one, it's wonderful. Victory never fails to impress me and this is no exception."
"Overall, this beer is a nice interpretation of the style. Although being a bit unorthodox in its approach, it is a nice example of a craft beer."
"lightly hazy gold color with a thick white head. tangy fruit smells like sour apple and lemon dominate, with some mild clove, bubblegum and bannana. some grassy hoppyness and yeastyness. very interesting spicy taste, the apple pineapple and citrus take a bit of a back seat to the clove, ginger and peppery characters, along with other baking spices, but come back stronger towards the end. i taste caramel malts with some balancing herbal hops. the alcohol is very well concealed almost not noticable except for the light warming. very smooth with a good middle of the road mouthfeel and light but plentiful carbonation. refreshing despite it's complexity, a beer that can be picked apart and analyzed, but i think works better when you don't think too hard about it."
"Wyll-"
"All in all, a good Tripel. This would probably be something I'd drink readily, but not in the class of the Belgian Masters. This would be, though, a great way to introduce someone to the style who's used to tamer beers."
"A good effort"
"Served in a 12-ounce Chimay glass, this beer was a burnt orange in color. A thin head clung to the glass. The hops came through as sweet and fruity, with a (almost inconsequential) bite of bitters. The finish was of kiddie fruit juice. Overall, quite a good beer, but rather rich in flavor and the taste buds might be on sweetness overlaod after a couple of these."
"Complex beer, probably on purpose to mask the 9.5% ABV. Full aroma of spice, fruit, malt, bit of hops and some alcohol. Taste is deep, medium body with hints of many things floating around the palette. Spicy, sweet, malt, carbonation, fruit, etc etc. You just have to try it. Another beer that can sneak up on you if you're not paying attention and go through a few bottles... but its oh so worth it."
"A bright white head that doesnt stick around for the finish. This clear bright pale brew has a nose to excite the taste buds. The spicy aroma pulls you in. The taste is as bright as the color. Spices abound and delicately balance out the alcohol that has the potential to do damage when youre not expecting it. This beer is DANGEROUS, it can easily become a session beer and at 9.5% it will floor you. Dangerously good!"
"i drank this 6er fairly quick and have since bought more and more. great beer! it would have gotten all 5's but i just wasn;t getting any smell off this one. its just smelled like beer, weird."
"Subsequent larger gulps bring out an easy-drinking character that reminds me of a sweet, well done wheat. A bit of lacing. Carbonation is an afterthought . A delicious brew that I cannot ever find up here!"
"Appearance: Murky apricot yellow with a huge foamy white head which subsides into the risen bread look. Smell is huge on ground wheat and bananas, with some peppercorn and a small hint of citrius. Hoppiness is small. The taste gives hints of charred wood, and is quite sweet overall. There is a fruity starchiness as well, but I cant quite put my finger on it (bananas maybe?). The taste is a bit too sweet and fruity, and I would love to have had a bit more depth in this beer. The mouthfeel is decent too. The body is medium, a bit syrupy, and has a good amount of small carbonation. A pretty good beer overall, but not great compared to some of the other beers in its class."
"I expect triples to have more depth. Then maybe it could have stood up to the spices. This could pass for a wit. As is, this is one beer from Victory I'll not be rushing to re-visit."
"12 oz. bottle, bottled on date of dec. 03. Pours light golden and clear, white, tiny bubble head and leaves some lacing. Nose in lemony, powdered sugar, flowers and a hint of spice. Crisp and a bit prickly on the tongue, flavors are subtle, sweetness evident but not cloying. Fruity, yeasty, spicey. I love this stuff. Nice American Triple style from Victory. If you like the style , this one will be a pleaser."
"Thanks to PSUDREW for sending this my way!"
"A good beer. Not your typical tripel, but it's always good to have a beer that goes a little against the grain."
"Pours almost the color of a hazy BUD I hate to say.Very little head-nice lacing.Nice malty,sweet aroma-somewhat spicy but not too much.Great flavor I cant say enough about it.Citrusy-almost lemony.Malty with a nice lingering sweetness.Theres definately spices in there but they seem to swirl together with none in particular standing out on its own.Nowhere near as phenolic as some Belgian triples can be.Silky smooth mouthfeel-goes down dangerously easy.A great beer from Victory-most Ive had have been great actually.Nice to see an ""American"" version of a Belgian classic that is just fantastic."
"It was the end of a long evening, and this elixir was not at all a bad way to close things out. The many components work hard to play well together, and the outcome is a busy but entertaining beer. You don't balance all this so much as juggle it, but nothing gets dropped during the performance. Granted, sometimes you find yourself concentrating to discern just what it is you're tasting, but once you get out of ""review mode," you can sit back and easily enjoy what it has to offer. Noticeably absent was overt evidence of the muscular ABV, so it bears watching, because it can and will reach out its paws and grip you firmly. Still in moderation it'll go down capably and enjoyably. One more victory for Victory."
"Nice cloudy golden honey body, but pours with almost no head and I don't really like that for a tripel. The aroma is pretty quiet which is a shame because what I get seems to be truly pleasant, but I wish it was more expressive. It seems quite yeasty not unlike an apple pie crust and with a deep malt profile (fresh harvest oranges, pears, bananas, melon bubblegum), honeyish and spicy (ginger mostly). There is a restrained alcohol suggestion in the back as well. The first sip surprises by the lively carbonation which is very tongue-cleaning and complements the banana/honey/yeasty palate interestingly to my liking. Very flowery, herbal and appealing taste, with obvious but well contained warming alcohol notes. Oh yeah, the mouthfeel fits the overall experience like a charm, not so thick, but plain clean and silky. Great, if not exceptional, american rendition."
"Watch out, the buzz will creep up on you at 9.5%. The bottle has bits of what not floating in it which are not really noticeable once the beer is poured. A nice foamy head of about an inch or so emerges and stays around for awhile. There is a nice golden color. Smell is some what fruity but not over bearing. The taste is is also fruity and rather pleasant. contray to some other reviews, I could not taste the alcohol whatsoever. It is certainly there however posseing a problem, cuz I found this rather drinkable..."
"This is a great take on the style."
"A tasty and drinkable brew, mine was only a year and a month old when sampled. Would like to try a 2 and 3 year old specimen."
"D&N: Wonderfully tasty with just a bit too much ABV to make this a good session. Still, this is a wonderful offering and should be tasted by everyone."
"A nice warming quality, relatively smooth, however there seems to be nothing exceptional about this tripel."
"I can't really find Tripel's around my area so when I saw a fresh 6-pack of the Golden Monkey I decided to nab it quickly. Bottled on March 20, 2004. Poured out a nice golden/orange color with a bit of carbonation in it. Smell was mostly sweet. Some malts, grapes, and some spice in there. Taste was pretty much the same. It's like a one-two punch of sweet and spicy. Candy-like sweetness hits first then fades away to a spicy/tart flavors. Some hops can be detected as well. Not a bad beer, maybe just a little bit more balancing may be in order for this to be ""out of this world."""
"12oz bottle bottle on Sept 08 03. Pours with a cloudy yellow color. Cottony white head develops with very fine bubbles of carbonation. Aroma is of candi sugar. Maybe a slight off smell like a hint of vinegar. First sip reveals a lighter bodied drink and less alcohol presence. Drinkability is high more like a refreshing summer drink. I had to check that this actually lists 9.5% ABV on the label. Pretty well hidden. Slight peppery taste. Slight metallic aftertaste. I'm getting a flavor like a watered down version of a good tripel. This is the weakest Victory offering I've tried thus far. Not bad just not that great."
"As I felt with similar beers, this is an excellent beer to try - and that is about it. I wouldn't buy more than one of these -but at the same time, I am glad that I tried it. In concept alone, this beer acheives much."
"Poured a cloudy yellow orange (OK, apricot) hue under a one finger off white head that disappeared way, way, way too quickly for a Trippel. Hardly a few sips had passed before the head was nothing but film and collar. Tsk, tsk. The nose is lovely, however, with fruits and spices leaning towards sweet. The mouth is very carbonated and heavy with the spice and alcohol. The taste is sweet - apricots and raisins - and spicey - coriander and a touch of, well, vanilla? There's a very subtle touch of hops in the finish, but this is all about the fruit and spice, plus the alcohol. Not my favorite beer, but it's quite tasty."
"A big, impressive brew besting many other triples, this one comes highly recommended. Good job Victory...I'm psyched to try their others!"
"Wow, this seem to be quite the brew, did not realize that it was 9.5 ABV. The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a smallish white head that broke down very quickly with hardily any lacing. The essence of this brew is mostly of bananas, cloves, citrus and sweet caramel. Most of these aromas are also entwined in the taste of the brew. As the brew warmed you could also notice a stronger and stronger rummy alcohol taste. Overall this brew has a number of different flavors and smells going on that seemed to spark the senses, I would classify it as more interesting experience than a great brew, but it is worth a try!"
" This turned out to be an excellent tripel, although a little too sweet. Excellent effort here, by one of the best East Coast breweries."
"Hazy golden colored beer. Froathy, white head slowly faded to a thin ring. The aroma was mildly sweet, some light fruits and earth smells. The flavor was similar with apricot, light malt, and some yeasty flavors. A smooth, fairly light bodied beer, that coats the tongue with just the right amount of flavor."
"This beer has a lot going on for it. Very zesty. It has a a lot of Belgian esters going on, very much like their Grand Cru. It has a nice peach color with ""fruity"" smells. While the taste is wonderful and complex due to the yeast used (I'm assuming here), it has a lot of sweet and fruit-like flavors which lower its drinkability. Very good, but in small doses."
"This brew comes out a cloudy orange color, with a white head comprised of small bubbles. The scent is grainy, with some citrus notes as well. This beer is quite sweet. Lots of candy/sugar flavors. You can definately feel the alcohol, and its spicy flavor is noticed as the beer goes down. Not a bad beer, worth a taste."
"Sit back kiddies and let Ahhdball to you on a journey with the infamous Golden Monkey of lore. Few have heard the name and even less have gazed upon it's hazy gold existence. The cloudy effervescent liquid holds a slight ring above the head of this animal. It's smell is a sweet banana, mango, and apricot which is very hard to miss. The flavors of the sweet malts, more fruits and hints of spices that leave no taste bud untouched. As the flavor leaves and we descend away from the monkey, an oily sticky sweet hint of malts and alcohol is left in the mouth to slowly disappear only to return by drinking another. Come hither children, taste the monkey!"
"This was tart enough to make me think I got a bad bottle, but the fact that I purchased it from a reputable store and it was 9.5%ABV and bottle conditioned sorta ruled that out. I guess it's just a different interpretation of the style, unfortunately one I don't care for."
"Drinkability: Maybe a little too heavy for session drinking, but I could still drink a few. ;-)"
"Notes: the alcohol taste can ruin this one for you. It's not overly complex, heck, Its not even complex. if you have some friends over, start with something you love, then finish with this. WICKED EXPENSIVE for what you get."
"i guess it doesnt hurt to try but damn, i know ill never buy this again."
"Previous GM's I've had are super-sweet or citrusy or even pretty mellow. I have had more than my share of GM bottles that I have not enjoyed, though. The only time I've had it taste good consistently was at the brewery itself."
"there are many better and more authentic versions of the tripel out there, but for a strong belgian golden ale, the monkey suits me just fine. i've had some off batches from time to time (when the flavors seem even more over the top than usual), but overall it's an enjoyable sipping brew."
"Citrusy sweet and malty but also floral. Nice, bright golden color does its name justice. It's so drinkable, with its mildly carbonated mouthfeel, that you can't help but drink a few too many."
"Golden Monkey was a light clear straw color. The head was creamy white and didn't linger too long. The aroma was busy - metallic, clovey, and earthy. The taste was metallic, citrusy, and a little yeasty. There was also some sweetness that helped take the edge off the bitterness.The high alcohol content also took the edge off of few things. The finish was a bit dry and citrusy."
"Victory"
"I like this one. (Of course, I'm into the second bottle, at 9+ABV, that may have something to do with it.)"
"Well done, even if the high ABV is too obvious -- but that might be likable to some drinkers, including me."
"It pours a light straw color. Although it has some different charecteristics, this has a very sweet malty flavor to it, and the typical barelywine flavor that masks or mixes the sweetness of malt and alchohol. While the belgian style is not my fav, per say, it has a nice all around charecter, esp if you age it, grad a couple and enjoy your night."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall- My first Victory beer is a bust. It's just to citrusy. I think I'm getting GERD because of it. A similair beer that is paletteable is Heavyweight's Lunacy."
"Some times it's good to have dessert first and then again and again and again... The Monkey is fun! I first had this at the Standard Tap in Philadelphia. It was the perfect beer to try on my first visit to the Tap. I'd like to think that it's better on tap then from a bottle but my tap experience was long ago. The monkey poured cloudy and appeared to have a honey color. The head built quickly but also faded quickly. It was easy enough to stir more foam by swirling the glass. The flavor is fruity and sweet which is why I think it's perfect to have for dessert. (a habit that developed recently) This beer commands your attention because if you let your guard down, the Monkey will have its way with you...Monkey...it's just fun to say!"
"Clear, golden yellow with an impotent head, as far as a tripel is concerned. Glass seems quite carbonated, but the head struggled and settled quickly. Nose is acidic, with notable spice (coriander mainly.) Hmm... has quite a bit of bite at first, and it settles into acid and hop. The malt flavor is genuine, and a sweetness lingers on the tongue. Where's the yeast? I dunno, a good brew, but seems like a tripel adapted for the masses."
"It poured a hazy golden orange but without a head. Immediately I was drawn to it by it's color. The smell is fruity, tasty (if that can be a smell) it makes one want to drink it right away. The taste is sweet, not so much malty or like honey, but just sweet. You get the sweet which gives way to the sour and finishes off with an alcoholic aftertaste that isn't bad at all. I would have liked more complex flavors, as the taste was good, but could be improved, perhaps with spices. The taste is smooth, and barring the high alcohol content, I could spend all night with this beer."
"Dark gold, clear color, lots of active carbonation, big white head that fills out the top of the goblet I am sampling it out of. Smells fruity, almost like champagne, and a hint of alcohol. Not particularily flavorful, has a very sweet flavor that finishes with hops and alcohol. Not up to Victory's other beers, somewhat of a disapointment."
"Overall - Another triumph for Victory. This is an excellent brew with some good characteristics. Take this one for a dance."
"I love this beer."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is of Belgian yeast and spices. It has a very fruity smell and a Belgian pale malt scent. The taste is good. Again, it has the traditional Belgian Abbey flavor, but with a banana flavor from the different spices and the amount of malts. It has an elevated aba (9.5%), but the beer is definately drinkable and enjoyable. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation; a very nice sessions beer."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow body with thin white head. Aromas is light citrus fruits (maybe lemon and peach) with a typically spicy Trippel background and a hint of alcohol. Flavors are is simlar to the nose very citrus like but doesn't have the yeasty, spicy tastes of great Trippels. Mouthfeel was not lively enough to make it a memorable beer."
"flavors had a sweet orange tasting foundation with cherry with some loam-like characteristic. an understated spice helped alot, and i thought there was a hint of mint here. an herbal after palate was appriciated as was the warm belly. the mouthfeel was not very bubbly, was filling, more chunky. not as many changes as i am apt to expect from this style but it was solid and straight ahead. i like this to a degree, i found it to be pretty good, i'd sub this for a trippel or introduce someone with this but if you've spoiled yourself...."
"A Hazy looking beer at first, but evidence that there is a good amount of yeast in it. Nice flowery aroma emerges from the glass. This Belgian style Triple has a smooth, clean taste, imparting citrus like sweetness. Certainly not overpowering in taste, this beer packs a punch with it's alcohol content. The alcohol is hidden I feel, and one must be careful if they plan to have more than one. Overall a decent, easy to find triple, which can be consumed with a variety of foods."
"Very carbonated, and a medium feel. Drinkability is reduced by the ABV. Spices tend to cloud the pepper taste I'd expect as a warning for strong alcohol. I put some in the cellar to see how time would affect it."
"Not my favorite Victory brew. Appearance was ok...but head quickly dissipated....smell was wheat like. Taste was somewhat citrusy and wheaty...not bad for such a high abv. Mouthfeel was puckery and not overly pleasant. Astringency kept drinkability rating down."
"I bought a six pack for $8.99. Little pricy but I support Victory in all their efforts. An excellent brew overall. Poured a cloudy gold, with a pale white head that fizzled down fast. It smelled like most other Tripels but this one kicks you. What a taste! The alcohol is present but it can be subtle with all the spices. One of the more spicier beers I have tried. If you like spice, than this is your beer. This one of the better domestic versions of a Tripel."
"Overall, a solid offering, although this is still not a favorite style of mine."
"Initially, I thought I prefered Golden Monkey to New Belgium's tripel, but now I'd have to say that I prefer NB's version. This is pretty good beer, but isn't one I'll look for again."
"The taste is very medicinal/fruity. Hard to describe. A very strong beer that doesn't hide it's alcohol, yet remains very complex. You get some bannana, clove, and bitter apple. The hops are pronounced at the end but aren't overbearing. This is a strong beer that requires strong balance."
"Poured a golden orange color with cloudiness and tiny floating white specks. Beautiful white head that stuck around to the very bottom of the glass, great carbonation. The aroma was yeasty, bread-like, and some orange rind. The taste was a little musty, great spiciness from clove and coriander. I enjoyed the spicy aspects of this beer a hell of a lot more than the yeastiness. The alcohol level was not as overpowering as I thought it would be, well hidden. But overall, this beer failed to overwhelm me completely."
"High ABV is evident from the after effects. I'll have another, please."
"Aromas of candied orange and tangerine in sugar syrup together with mild, sweet spices. Black pepper, cough medicine and hazelnuts are suggested around the perimeter. Quite a mouthful with tangy, syrupy fruit that plods along nicely."
"In total, I find that Victory has not over-hyped this beer. I think it has not gotten enough press. The taste is almost addictive. At least, I hate to think that I'm coming back just for the high alcohol content. But no, it really is the definition of drinkable."
"Bottle dated July 30, 2003 tried October 29. Appearance: Golden yellow; slightly cloudy. Head fades rapidly. Smell: very spicy, some malt. Taste: Dominated by spiciness. Some malt sweetness, some earthy hops. Mouthfeel: creamy, fairly thick. Drinkability: Good, but would prefer more dryness in the beer, and would be more appropriate to style."
"Notes: A tad aggressive and overwhelming, but nonetheless enjoyable and challenging."
"I don't have a lot of experience with the Belgians but this is about what I expected..banana/cloves on the aroma and the initial taste..pretty charged up carbonation wise...tastes like a Belgian...has a high alcohol content but it is not overwhelming on the taste...It has a hint of alcohol/warming effect but doesn't taste real heavy of alcohol...actually pretty smooth and easy drinking....overall a very interesting beer definitely worth trying...not one I would drink a lot of, but a nice change of pace..."
"Pours a nice golden copper color with a thin amount of head thought there was a lot of carbonation. Decent armoa but I thought it was a little week. Slightly hoppiness but mainly a spicy type smell. The taste was good with a good balance of malt, spice, and bitternss. Hints of fruit and yeast. Not to strong for such a high alcohol beer."
"Poured a nice golden color with a thin head. Nice carbonation in the glass. The aroma was slightly yeasty, but some citrus overtones were apparant. The taste was similiar, very smooth but sporting a nice balance of malt, bitterness, yeast, and citrus. Very dry and somewhat crisp on the tongue. One of Victory's best efforts."
"The yeast esters, maltiness, and hint of warming alcohol in this brew make this a wonderful example of the tripel style of beer. I will relish finishing off this six pack! What higher praise is there?"
"Hazy golden ale with an orange hue. White head dies quickly leaving but a disorganized white film. Has a wonderful peppery spicy aroma. Has a creamy mouthfeel that is velvety and smooth. Very nice. This is a very nice Tripel. Terrific flavor that is fruity, spicy and has a good yeasty malty thing going on. It's great to see an American brewer do well at a non-Ameriacan style."
"Update  I revisited this in 2004 and was even more impressed with the way Victory put this one together. After attending the 2004 Belgian Beer Fest and sampling many American efforts at the style Ive come to reallly appreciate this offering from the V. I was particularly impressed with the Mouthfeel and am raising that score by 0.5."
"We all know that Victory is an undeniably world-class brewery, but I still don't know how they managed Golden Monkey. It runs with Belgium's best and is easily the best tripel I've ever ever had. The Belgian-style taste is taken to a new level by an exceptional fruitiness that I consider to be unequalled by any other Belgian-style beer. Honestly, when it comes to tripels, this is paramount. The strong, alcoholic smell is deceiving compared to the sweet and yeasty taste. This beer has everything Belgium has to offer and more; only the greatest trappists can top this brew. With regard to the Victory brewery, I think Golden Monkey rivals Storm King in terms of general appeal."
"This Monkey pours a light gold color. I gave it a hard, rapid pour and this brew did produce a semi decent head, but it faded quickly. The color is a sight bit hazy. The aroma reminds me of green apples with tones of yeast and citrus hidden. Taste is smooth; there is a bit of a malt flavor with the green apples mixed in with a very slight yeast zing near the end. The flavor does masks the alcohol in this brew. There is always bubbles moving to the top of the glass and it has a very nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. A very enjoyable brew and easy to drink. I could easily enjoy more than one of these, no problems."
"Honey colored and surprisingly tasty. Fairly sweet yet a dry honey aftertaste. This beer really sneaks up on you strength-wise, since the malt covers the alcohol taste well. I would recommend it if you want a strong sweet beer and are only having one."
"Golden color, slightly hazy. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and a touch floral. Big bold beer with complex flavors. Tastes like a triple wit. Sweet and spicy with fruity and yeasty flavors. Sour apples, grapefruit, mango, coriander and etc etc. Tart and sweet. Both malts and hops and sweet and tart nicely balanced. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet and tart."
"This is an embarrassing attempt at a Belgian Tripel, laughable. Sweet, sweet bready malts, really sticky, toilet cleaner flavours, one dimentional and boring, i liked the yeast character though, but thats the only positive. The yeast tastes Belgian, but the rest of the beer doesn't, seems a bit out of place to me."
"I have to guess this was a bad bottle. If it's not, this would rank as one of the worst I've let past my lips. Lord knows I tried my best but ended up dumping the last 6oz. Golden Monkey's appearance and mouthfeel are quite appealing. However, the slightly rotten sourness leads me to one word: undrinkable. I'm happy I only bought one."
"This was a little sweeter than I would have liked, and slightly sweeter than most beers of this style. Still, a solid effort, and I'd have this again."
"Another victory for Victory! Thoroughly enjoyable. I was a little apprehensive going in, having tasted a Corsendonk, which I found too ""champagne-y"" for my liking. The Victory was smoother and more doughy, creating a nice drinkability for so potent a brew. I could have had another but I would have been sleeping in my chair for the night. Overall, the spiced fruit flavors are there but not overpowering. I will have a hard time keeping this ""monkey"" off my back."
"Hazy golden hue with a steady stream of carbonation present. Fizzy white head dissipates into almost nothing, although the thin ring of head does leave sparse lacing down the chalice. Yeasty, doughy nose features notes of fruity esters and alcohol. Passion fruit, apple, pear, apricot, yeast, sugar, and alcohol all appear in the taste department. Overall, this is a fruity, sweet tripel-style with the high abv covered by lots of candy sugar. Finishes very sweet with the sugar and alcohol making the most impact. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, almost too overly so. This is a fairly drinkable tripel, but one that is a bit too sugary to be incredibly enjoyable. Even so, this is a tasty creation."
"It's golden. The Head is not much.... but there. The lace is THERE! It's well intended. The truly interesting thing is its little stink. It's like perfume. Good perfume has a little rot in it. So does Golden Monkey. It tastes a little rotten too. It has a good mouthfeel. It's actually quite silky. I'll keep it on hand always unless I have tricks played on me and then I'll have to make the trip to Downington. Drink this beer."
"I have previously had this on tap at Victory's brewpub. The bottled version doesn't appear to drastically differ from the tap version, except that the head was a bit weaker. The beer is a rich, hazy golden color with a bit of a head. The aroma is spicy, floral and fruity. Coriander is the most evident. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. Complex, yet mellow taste. Alchohol evident, but subtle in taste. I've convinced my local packy to carry this, albeit on a rotating basis. Very much like Duvel. A superb beer!"
"Dayton, OH AleFest:This beer formed a small sized ivory head that contained fine sized bubbles that mostly diminished.The body was clear with some fizzy carbonation and the hue was yellow.The nose was lightly malty, light hops, fruity, sweet and some clove detected.The flavor was acidic and bitter tasting along with a smooth, tingly, and light-medium bodied palate."
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a smallish head which diminishes very quickly. Some minor lacing is present on the glass as well. Nice smelling: floral and spicy scents. Tastes fruity, especially of bananas. The taste of the high alcohol content comes through as well especially as it warms. A decent beer which I will likely have again, although it certainly does not rank as a ""favorite""."
"Pours out a golden straw color with a medium to thick head that lingers around for a while, then laces up. Aroma was yeasty and fruity. Carbonation was noticeable and adds a crispness to this brew. Taste is quite good apples maybe banana and slight yeast/wheat. Very drinkable but watch out, as its 9.5 abv will eventually catch up to you."
"June 02 03 bottling. Looks like a belgian triple should. It's a straw/hazy yellow with a decent frothy white head, and decent carbonation to boot. Nothing to write home to mom about, but it loooks like what I paid for.Smell of sweet & fruity esters along with some slight maltiness and barely detectable hoppiness. Taste is excellent. I remember trying this in the past and being a little unimpressed..it seemed a bit ""all over the place"". Not this time. Taste is quite good with apples, oranges, grapes detected in the the taste. A bit sweeter than most triples, but the carbonation helps balance this a bit, but not quite enough..this beer after a few sips tends to be a bit too sweet. Decent mouthfeel that's crisp at first but turns a bit syrupy. Alcohol is masked well. I'm impressed. Victory seems to get better & better. A good attempt at a tough style."
"Overall Impression: Damn disappointing. Actually had to dump it. It's too cloyingly sweet and the alcohol afterburn is not pleasant. I dinged it big-time in the Drinkability category for that. Also, the sediment in the bottle was very loose. A big cloud of it stirred up just by taking the bottle out of the fridge. No big deal, just bad form. Victory can do much better than this. Did they forget an addition of bittering hops?"
"This beer was recently added to the taps at my local bar, and I felt adventurous last evening, so I took a pint of Victory's monkey. Now to preface, this was my first tripel and I may not have the right idea of what one should be, but I will review the beer as a beer, and not as an interpretation of a style. The color is not surprisingly, a bright yellow/golden that is topped by a head of white lace. First smell is of faint alcohol, and fruit. The taste is interesting. There is a certain bit of malt to it, and flavors of clove and light citrus with banana as the most prevalent fruit. The finish is dry and alcoholic, spicy and almost sour. Now, I keep mentioning the alcohol content, but while drinking this it never detracted from the beer. It is very well masked behind a well structured arrangement of sweetness and spice (and everything nice, ha ha). I would certainly try this again, and the style is intriguing to say the least."
"A few sips into it and its girth announces itself. Painting suddenly seems more enjoyable. This is a very accessible Belgian style beer, and I must remember to suggest it to friends who are willing to make the step."
"High marks for drinkability considering the high alcohol."
"With the (deceptively) hefty alcohol level and the pile of residual sweetness, Victory must pack the kettle with sugars for this brew! And the sweet spiciness in the finish makes this massive beer dangerously refreshing! Mmm, danger."
"The monkey is cloyingly sweet and will make you drunker then a monkey before you know it and from there a bit of a what I think about the good but somewhat over the top beer. The monkey pours a nice golden color with a head the flairs up for a few seconds but descends to nothing but a ring around the color lace. The smell is of a carnival full of funnel cake sugar and cotton candy downright sweet to the nostrils and will bring you right back to your childhood of riding unsafe rides at the county fair. The initial taste surprisingly is not sweet but more of a dry pepper then that where that ends and it takes you on the roller coaster of sickeningly sweet, which by the way isnt a bad thing to me, malts and slight hint of honey on bread. This beer more so then any other reminds me of my childhood of going to the fair and eating crap foods and thus is overly drinkable and will remind you of your job in morning when you walk in there with a head split and kidneys of stone. Good beer none the less drink it and remember some past times even though you wont remember what happened the night you drank it."
"Drinkability: Beware this monkey! the 9% ABV is well-hidden. Quite easy to empty the glass in a heartbeat. Great combination of flavors and sparse aftertaste make for a well-crafted beer."
"Hazy, pale tawny-honey hue with yeast chucks fluttering to the bottom of the glass and loads of bubbles streaming to the top of the glass. Thick white head with excellent retention it produced minimal lace. Limited nose, the bouquet could barely muster enough tart lemon aromas to be detected, hints of funkiness and spice. Disappointing in its lack of complexity. My goodness the alcohol bite on the palate is harsh (!) nicely spicy, peppery somewhat tart and fruity, lemon & pear mainly the hops bitterness is moderate at best, plenty malty, the finish is dry. Medium-light body and ideally high carbonation produces a near perfect mouthfeel for the style. The alcohol is warming, limited mass consumption (in theory, it is damn easy to drink). Golden Monkey is an excellent attempt at the style; it does have some flaws however. Plenty good, try one!"
"Pours a nicy deep yellow color with a nice medium rocky head,the aroma was pretty tart and spicey.The taste was pretty cloveywith a malty sweet background,dangerously drinkable,wow.A very good beer from Victory,impressive maltiness in the ending on this one,pretty complex."
"This has been quite an inconsistant beer for me. If enjoyed sometimes other times it just didn't seem like the same beer. This was a great time and how I'm sure the guys at Victory intended it to be. Hazy gold color with a large white head that eventually diminishes into nothing. Aroma is spicy with what seems like a bananna flavor I usally don't associate with the style, but is welcomed here anyway. There are so many tastes in this beer, but overall it is quite spicy in character with some alcohol. A very very complex beer. A little too wild for a tripel in my opinion."
"Hardly the aromatic beast I was kind of expecting, the aromas present were a spicy orange-ish alcohol. Angel food cake with lemon icing. Kind of exotic but not nearly enough of it. The flavor is a bit one-sided, not really pushing my tongue around at all. I think perhaps the big nature of this beer with all its alcohol and fruity, malty sweetness demands a bit more of a peppery, hoppy kick at the end. It's there, but it could be bigger. Regardless, it's very delightful, and it's size makes up for its lack of complexity. Highly drinkable despite the big 9.5%. Pretty damn good."
"This isn't a GREAT tripel, but with its wide availability around here, certainly is more than a decent one. I think if Victory tinkers with the recipe a bit more, they could have a real winner on their hands!"
"A very good appearance and a nicely complex flavor. The Golden Monkey is a very solid ale that tastes as good as it looks. The golden hue is slightly cloudy giving the appearance of great substance. The clovish flavor immediately gives you a sweet spice sense while the thin ivory-colored head dissipates and leaves minimal amounts of lace. The nose is light, but gives off hints of its malt base along with bits of fruit and spiciness. Very smooth and rich body leaves a nice full mouthfeel to cap the experience. A memorable brew with high alcohol contnet."
"Great beer and thanks Gavage for the recommendation!"
"The clerk I bought this from was a fairly big guy, but he made sure to warn me about the Monkey, and I can see why. A bit too drinkable and smooth for the octane level."
"This tripel is a triple all right; it pours a murky yellow with a thin white head. The smell is hoppy and some light spices--a little apple and citrus thrown in. The taste, though, is wild--much more potent than the smell. I can taste the alcohol buzzing all over the place, which pushes powerfully through the finish . Wow. I'm not sure I've figured it out yet; whatever, this is not a brew to be taken lightly. The mouthfeel is thinly seductive. I'll need to have another, but not tonight!"
"The color was a spot on deep gold, little to no aroma, stiff malt backbone with delicately balanced hopping, a bit of cloviness, plus a significant (but not overbearing) alcohol contribution that just made you want to dance. Drink my monkey."
"This is a solid attempt from Victory but falls a little short of the leaders in the class on almost every point. Appearance is one of the biggest downers and mouthfeel is a little weak. I still order this occasionally but would prefer a true Belgian to Victory's offering."
"The flavor reminds me a bit of a white beer, like Celis, but it is a strong ale & it hides the alcohol very well. I am sure glad that it is now readily available in southern california. Another fine beer from Victory. For such an elegant beer, it could be easily used to convert the BMC fool to great beer"
"Hazy golden pour, thick and dense white head, slowly diminished and left good lace. Aroma is pretty big, yeasty, grassy and apple dominate. Flavor is equally big & sweet, apple, banana, some orange and lemon, and hints of spices. Mouthfeel is quite full, minimal alcohol presence detected towards the end."
"Surprisingly pale. Bright golden hue catches the light nicely.Wimpy head. You expect more from a tripel.Excellent effervessance keeps me from knocking too much off.Looks like a dark pilsner. Distinct clove and wheat flavors and aroma. Hints of bubblegum. As it warms, it gains some cheesey notes."
"The pour a slightly blurred golden amber color, the head is modest in size, the texture frothy, the color and off white, with a fine coating of lace left behind. Nose is sweetly malt, crisp and clean, fresh as a spring day, with the start ambrosial, and loaded with malt, the top is middling in its feel. Finish has a purposeful acidity, the hops are mellow and pleasant to the palate, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a Most Quaffable beer to say the least, and I must thank beerluvr for this bottle,"
"Pours a bright golden color with a foamy white head that soon settles into a good amount of lace. Nose is sweet cake-like malt, floral hops, and lots of spice. Medium to full in body with a very soft carbonation. Taste is sweet candied fruit and lots of spice at first followed by notes of bready malts and coriander. Some lemony citrus and peppery alcohol are present towards the end leaving a dry finish. A complex and thoroughly enjoyable brew. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"
"Not a bad night, though!"
"Pours to a brilliant, golden color with a copperish hue. It forms a thick off-white head with good lacing. The aroma is sweet, herbal/medicinal, fruity.bananas? It also has the fresh hay-like aromas. The flavors I detect are candi sugar, medicinal and fruity flavors. It is a sweet beer with a sweet finish. It is smooth, and easy drinking for its strength. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Brass monkey, that funky monkey. Poured a nice semi-cloudy yellow. Good hops, a slight citric bitterness. ABV does not interfere with it's consumption. I purchased it in a 12oz bottle, I would probably have liked it better in a 22oz, if it was available."
"Comments: Served at room temperature which was just perfect. Quite a nice and dangerous brew. It is incredibly drinkable but also very strong. Watch out."
"Pours a golden hue with a white head, smells like belgium, yet made in PA, this kicks ass, A multitude of flavors, yeasty spicy malty. I am a novice as far as Belgian styles go, but this beer seems to quench my thirst for that hard to descirbe flavor."
"cheers to frank4sail for providing this sample!"
"Bottled date was 10 Sep 02. Pours a hazy golden color with about a 1/2-inch head. Minimal lacing was left on the glass. Aromas of citrus, bananas, mild hops and a vast array of various other fruits seem to burst out of the glass. The taste is incredibly refreshing. Theres a ton of carbonation that tickles your nose as you drink it. An amass of flavors attack the taste buds all at once; bananas, hops, citrus fruit, yeast, corianderI dont know where to start. This is a very crisp and refreshing beer great for drinking on a warm summer day, yet the high ABV will warm you up on the most frigid of days."
"A nice attempt by victory, but unless I'm just looking to get wasted on a budget, I'll probably stay away from this beer in the future."
"Revisit June 28, 2003 - Pours a nice golden orangey color with a heavy white loose frothy head about two fingers high, leaves minimal lace in strings. Smell is super nice floral aroma with good amounts of crispy citrus with a bit of spice. Taste is very smooth with complex layers of hard candy, bright citrus of lemon, orange, and grapefruit, with a sweet caramel malt backbone and a note of spiceyness. Feel is full bodied and solid. One hell of great offering of the style, impressive."
"Admittedly, I am relatively new to this style so Trippel lovers take my review with a grain of salt I suppose, but this is really an addictive beer (or perhaps that's the high alcohol content talking). But on to the review.. it pours a very nice deep reddish gold in color and leaves less of a head than the weiss beers I typically drink. Not much laceing either. But the proof is in the very smooth taste that goes down quite easily. A very fine beer that defiitely whet my appetite for the style."
"I really enjoyed this ale. Definitely one for those who think they don't like Belgian beer."
"My first Belgian style trippel that I had toward the beginning of my journey into the realm of beer. Now, I approach the mystic monkey once again a more disciplined deciple. Pours a vibrant drop of sunshine golden with a white highly carbonated, quickly dissipating head. Very alcoholic nose with fruit esters, honey, and cloves contains a sharp sweetness that tickles the nose. Taste is spiced up quite a bit, very unique banana esters in the flavor. A syrupy mouthfeel with a very alcoholic finish, this in my opinion is one of the most unique offerings from Victory. Pretty drinkable for the high ABV, but I would tend to stick with something a little more quaffable."
"Decent head, decent lace, with a definite nose of sugar, honey, cloves, bits of banana and bubble gum  all typical tripel or strong golden ale characteristics, but none of were as crisp or fresh as the more classic examples. In nose and taste it seemd more rounded and flat than a typical sharp trippel, kinda like how a soda is sweet. A creamy taste, but a bit wheatier than normal, softly hopped, with a fairly thin mouthfeel. Is a good try at a class style, but does not match as well with the Westmalle standard. Too clean, soft, and rather simple. Regardless, a great beer to woo newbies, especially the ladies, with."
"One of the better Triples on the East Coast. I would not classify this as a Strong Pale Ale. 9.5% alcohol will creep up on you as you enjoy this highly dangerous, drinkable beer. Enjoy slowly if you can as it is very refreshing and seems light, but is not."
"Bottled on Oct 23 02: Man, more like chunky monkey! This beer has a *lot* of sediment in it. Hazy golden in color, with a head that is wispy thin, but surprisingly persistant. Aroma is bready, with hints of orange and floral hops. Flavor begins with a wonderful coriander spiciness, and a really terrific floral hop flavor. It then gives way to a sweet, bready, somewhat sugary body with a big herbal spiciness. Finishes dry, but gives way to a lingering sweet aftertaste. This is a great tasting, very assertive beer -- not the most complex belgian golden, but leaves a strong impression and is enjoyable nevertheless."
"Footnote: I was so taken by this brew on our first introduction that I put it on the list at my restaurant/bar. One of the musicians in our Tuesday night band last summer had a serious monkey fetish (tied into the ""Hundredth Monkey"" concept...on one tune he made monkey sounds...). This was the beer for him! And, when one woman asked a bartender for our ""sweetest beer", he chose GM, and she was an instant fan. The furor spread, and for a short time in the summer of '02, Tuesday night was Golden Monkey night at the Blue Nile in Minneapolis. Ah, memories."
"Golden Monkey poured a deep golden color with an airy white head. Carbonation seen throughout. Aroma consists of spices, pineapple, yeast and seems a bit peppery. The 9.5% abv is masked very well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, tangy and crisp. This trippel has a mild sweetness to it that is toppled by a tart spiciness. The Monkey is somewhat seductive in a sassy sort of way and the flavor grows on you. The taste consists of pineapple, sweet malt, and sour lemon with a peppery spiciness. Smooth and easy drinking."
"This dubbel poured a hazy, golden color with creamy, rich, white foam that left good lace. There was lively, fizzy carbonation. The smell was lightly fruity (pears, bananas), with some citrus and biscuit aromas. The taste was malty (slightly sweet), with the flavors of fruit (bananas, grapes), toasted caramel, candy sugar, and alcohol thrown in. The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, and warming. The sweetness and light fruitiness lingered. This was a very tasty and drinkable dubbel style ale. Not as full bodied as some from Belgium, but easy drinking nonetheless."
"The Golden Monkey poured a bright gold with a small foamy head that didn't stick around long. Aroma was a citrus fruit smell, very reminiscent of a hefeweizen or other wheat ale. The small pieces of sediment floating around took off from the appearance, as it just looks a little gross. On the first sip the alcoholic sweetness makes itself known. Belgian roots are obvious in the taste. Very refreshing and very warming, although I could see myself in bed after just a couple."
"This beer poured a cloudy gold color and formed a minimal white head that vanished quickly. Some carbonation and particles were present. The aroma was of citrus, bread and spice. The flavor was of citrus and spice. The finish was a touch light, but bready. Not really the most impressive thing that I have had from this brewer."
"This beer did not impress me at all. I poured a foggy, light golden with not head to speak of. The smell was lightly sweet with a mix of yeast and roasted corn. Pretty standard aromas for a Belgian(or Belgian knock-off). The taste was very, very sweet with very obvious notes of apricot, plumb and white grapes. There was a pretty apparent alcohol taste as well which I would have been ohk with had the flavor been more complex. The mouthfeel was thin, but overly sweet as if I was drinking sugar water, which resulted in a sticky effect on my lips. I will not buy this beer again."
"This beer reminded me of a sweet tasting Duvel. It was not as spicy as its Belgian counterpart, but had a good combination of flavors that make it unique."
"Backwash: A worthy competitor to other tripels, to which it is most akin; but doesn't quite reach the high watermark of Westmalle or the domestic Allagash Tripel Reserve."
"I had this one following a Hennepin (both for the first time). Two entirely different experiences. Golden Monkey reminds me (in taste and mouthfeel) of the darker, stronger Belgian beers like Rochefort or Westleverten (but not as complex). Despite pouring a hazy, golden color, it has little in common with the more typical golden Belgian Ales. Poured very little head, and what was there disappeared quickly. No lace whatsoever. The taste was initially a little overwhelming (particularly following the delicate tasting Hennepin). After a few sips, however, I began to warm up (literally!) to this beer. Malty, thick mouthfeel (for the style) spicy and fruity (pear?), but just not as lively as the best beers of the style. This being said, for a domestic brewer to make a Belgian styled beer this authentic and powerful is an impressive feat. If this beer were available to me, I certainly would buy it once in awhile. It is different enough, and certainly will boot you in the arse. Thanks for the sample, Joe!"
"Works for me!"
"Hazy, effervescent yellow. Thin head that stays for a while. Quite a melange of aromas: yeast, bread, lemon, butterscotch. Sweet and sour taste. The high alcohol content is apparent but not overpowering or distracting. Nice rich, creamy mouthfeel. This is quite a summer quaffer although you couldn't pound down very many of them. If you want to tie one on, this is your baby. Another accomplished brew by one of my favorite breweries."
" This does lack the large head like most triples iv'e had. The hard pour produced a light yellow color fogged with sediment. A fruity banana and sweet honey aroma adds alot to the enjoyment of this brew. Pears, honey and clove are all there along with a pepper and spice taste. The warming alcohol feel begins to come on at the end, but slowly. Another winner from Victory."
"I knew there was a reason I moved back to Pennsylvania. Boy do these boys make some good beer. This one is quite a treat. The carbonation is strong but dies quickly. The head is only a thin, white layer. But this brew smells so nice and tastes so good. The spices are not overwhelming, but they add a nice touch. The alchohol does not make this brew undrinkable. In fact, this beer keeps you coming back for more. Golden Monkey is definitely worth having many times."
"Very, very strong beer. It's not the strength itself that distracts, but rather the lack of flavor to hide the alcohol. Floral, hoppy flavor and nose, with some strange spice action going on. This is a good beer, but as a Belgian-style tripel, it falls short of expectations."
"I like this beer. The paleness could fool a guy not ready for the alcohol strength. Contrary to crispness for style this has a very good ale smoothness. The sweetness is pushed without becoming cloy."
"Pours a hazy, golden straw color with a slightly off-white head. Fades to a ""cling-ring"" after a little while. Yeasty and spicy aromas dominate. A floral hoppiness too. Taste is sweet with an alcohol kick to remind you that it's there. It's sweet, yet dry; a feat I'm still awed by. I was expecting more fruity flavors for a tripel, but I did enjoy this beer. I don't think it really is a good example of the style, but quite good nonetheless. Nice carbonation and consistency to this beer as well. Thanks go out to aaronh for dialing me in with these fine Victory beers."
"Pours a clear golden honey color with light bubbling making its way up to the small white head. The head dissipates rather quickly leaving just a thin layer. The smell is a pleasant floral/fruity ester with alcohol being noticeable. The lightly sweetened taste reveals light fruit and yeast combination blended with light hopping and finishes with a strong warming alcohol. This brew has a light bodied mouthfeel and drinks down plenty easy despite the high ABV. Nicely done! Thanks to Rostaruch for sending this to me! Cheers!"
"3) Am I spoilt by Unibroue? Most certainly, yes."
"Thanks Frank!"
"It pours into the glass a peachy gold color. The head is white that seemed to stay for awhile. It left some residue but no real lace. The aroma was pretty complex. Fruits like oranges, cherries seemed to be present. Malt (yeasty, alittle) some spices hops (slight) and alcohol was present. The taste was good. It was rich full and again complex. It seemed to change as my hands warmed the glass. Temperature is a definite factor. First you notice the carbonation, then the flavors hit, the some cherries, oranges, dates, spices, malt (sweet) and the alcohol and a bit of hops. All these seem to jump around with the temperature. None of the flavors seemed to be too much. A very drinkable beer. I think this was as good as the monkey from the tap. Keeping some on had at all times."
"Drinkability: I'm not really sure...as I believe I'm drinking a soured bottle. I'll have to see if I can get ahold of another bottle to compare. For now, my numbers stand..."
"Poured a golden light with pieces floating around inside.Bubbles rising from the bottom to the top.The first sip really shows the ABV of this ale,extremely strong.The lace is very solid and thick like cream.The alcohol taste is somewhat overpowering making the mouthfeel harsh.The taste offers some spices I cannot place and seems acidic with some hop character and bitterness.Orange zest,coriander and lemon are noted.One of these and you'll be ready to switch to something lighter.The color definitely deceives you as far as strength."
"pours a light golden yellow. alcohol smell is immediately apparent though not overbearing. hints of spice and citrus fruit throughout. i guess i have to be in the mood for the style, as i've had golden monkey numerous times and sometimes i can't stand it and sometimes i can't get enough. right now, i can't get enough..."
"Once you pour this stuff you notice a lot of alcohol. I just got done with a winter activity in the snow and this beer fit the bill. very spicy, citrus like. Coriander or clove. I like to have this on hand for the opportunity to sip something nice next to the fireplace. A great Winter drink, but not more than one at a time. Tastes similar to a Belgian White I tried in Harrisburg, only with much more alcohol.If you're going to drink this beer out, make sure you can get someone else to drive."
"Dark golden hue, w/ a slight haze. Moderately thick, white, well retained head leaves web like lace. Tart lemon and lime citrus and orange zest dominate the aroma, without much to back them up. Hint of spicy alcohol and trace clove. Cleanly spicy overall in aroma. Strong, almost acetic tartness hits the tongue at first, then mellows and tartness becomes akin to unripe orange and lime juice. Light curacao bitterness. Tartness partially wanes to allow residual sweetness to meld with the citric fruitness, lending an orange marmalade impression. The moderate hop bitterness accentuates the persistent tartness, lending an overall dry flavor profile. Lightly bodied. Crisp and light on the palate, and thus deceivingly quaffable. Finishes both sweet and tart, with ethanol warmth creeping up the throat. An enjoyable, albeit oddly tart pale strong. More residual sweetness and / or esters would have provided balance. Nevertheless quite tasty and dangerous."
"Not as ""Belgian"" as I hoped. Give me a Westmalle Tripel any day."
"Opaque straw/yellow color pours a good head that diminishes as the beer is drained from the glass. Flowery aroma with a subtle hint of alcohol. Smooth and creamy body with a faint alcohol yeast taste. Finishes ok as it only starts ok. Next to Lunacy this one blows."
"-F"
"Just tried a 22oz. bomber (thank you Rotsaruch) that was one of the first off the bottling line (didn't even have a label). This was much fruitier than the 12oz version. Banana and caramel aromas were much more pronounced. Taste was sweeter also with flavors of honey and tangerine present along with some stronger notes of alcohol. This one is much more complex than the 12 oz. bottle. Will most likely cellar better than the 12oz bottle also."
"Pours a cloudy yellow, with a thin white head that doesn't last very long, not much lacing either. Flowery yeasty aroma, sweet and malty, thick and creamy full mouthfeel, warming alcohol taste and an awesome, spicy clove flavor,a big and beautiful trippel, I need more."
"In the bottle, this is a terrific beer. On tap, it's exceptional (especially when the ""tap"" is in the Victory brewpub in Downingtown!). Beautiful Duvel-yellow in color, with a frothy white head. Aromas of sweet citrus and spice, especially coriander. Taste is a magical blend of tropical fruits and spices, again coriander, and perhaps some clove and pepper. This is really an exceptional beer."
"I feared the Belgian styles. I was afraid that I could be opening a Pandora's box of great beer that I would then have to go and try.  They got me.  Great beer."
"Pours with a firm rocky pure white head, over yeast-hazed yellow-gold liquid. Nose is spicy with some coriander notes, tart aromas also. Taste is a bit tart and sour at first, then a small amount of malt sweetness creeps forward followed by a slight dryness. Finishes a bit dry and tart...not one of the best interpretations of the style, I remember this being a little bit better tasting last time I drank it."
"Straw color with no head of any significance. Predominant smell is of bubble gum. Mild carbonation. Taste is overwhelmingly sweet; confectioner's sugar/cotton candy flavors are all over the place. Not very drinkable. If you're looking for a domestic tripel, there are much better choices out there."
"drink up!"
"* review made during 2002 World Series."
"Nice! 750ml corked bottle, one of four I hid from my wife, for about two weeks. Definitely got better as it warmed to room temp. Nice, big head, slowly fading to a nice collar. Aroma of yeast, fruits, alcohol. Tastes of spices, hops, yeast and alcohol. Clean, dry, spicey finish. Nice triple. Good Ale."
"This beer is almost overpowering in it's youth.  The bottle I had was bottled July 25, 2002, I believe.  The beer pours with a nice head that produces a light lace and has a very attractive orange-yellow color.  The aromas seem to be constantly changing as the beer warms.  Most smells are sweet, as is the taste.  My initial taste produced almost emtirely alcohol.  While the beer was a little too cool, it tasted as though somehone had put a shot of Vodka in my beer.  As it warmed, the alcohol nose and taste diminished, but never completely disappeared.  Towards the end of the glass, the sweetness became very strong, almost overpowering.  I will let the other 5 age for a while before opening another, because it is a good beer that will probably mellow with some aging."
"Hazy, peach colored with a white head that holds fairly well, and drops to a nice creamy collar but leaves no lace. The aroma is quite full with a soft fruitiness, some orange, a sweet bready malt, a light spice and some alcohol. The body is medium with a very fine & effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue and fills the mouth. The taste is rich and full, with candyish malt, spice - some coriander is noticeable, and finishing with a lingering spicy sweet malt. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Very well balanced with just enough hop bitterness and spice flavor to keep the big sweet malt from getting out of hand. Not extremely complex, but big. Very rich and highly enjoyable."
"No sir - I don't like it.  Had a draught at GingerMan in Greenwich and I was disappointed.  I love Storm King Stout and was looking forward to trying another Victory beer.  It may be that I don't have alot of experience with type of beer, but still ... I didn't like it.  The taste was all over the place and I was unable to grasp anything.  The color and smell were fine, decent head.  I honestly couldn't wait to finish it because I was in my favorite beer bar and there were other beers waiting....  Storm King Stout is strong and tastes great, doesn't knock you over with the alcohol taste, this did for me."
"Just out of this world. I like to discribe the taste and aroma, but I can't. It is just out of this world. Victory  Brewing does it again. This is a must to beer lovers. I can discribe the feeling you get when drinking this beer. This has to be one of my number one beers to buy. I now have three!"
"Pours with a nice head but this disapates fast due to the ABV%.  Sweet complex nose.  The taste beats the tongue with  honey sweetness and a yeast/clove taste.. the finish is dry.  This brew is not for the timid, but you will will be rewarded with a ""mindblow"" of a beer if you try it...  Watch out for the 9.5 ABV...."
"Hard to control pour (making it ideal to bring to parties as many will think its a ""golden"" lager and wonder why they have to constantly suck on it to keep it from overflowing ; ) )...Hazy and slightly chunky gold color, parts of the head rise an inch and others less, as it settles.  Complex aroma, promises of flavors to come.  Medium bodied mouthfeel, flavors of deep cherry, some dried dates, and an alcoholic warming of a brandy.  Very similar front to back, maybe could use more complexity, but the brew is assertive.  A pretty good match to Belgian Pales, with fewer sour notes than some.  I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Notes: Compare this beer to its style and it falls short. There's much better examples out there, and with less hype surrounding it. Is it a good beer? Yes it is, good ... but that's about it. Just another big beer with lots of hype and good marketing for the beergeek fish to bite at."
"Just had this fine brew on tap at the local beer bar. It has a distinct golden color which was quite appealing. While I'm not generally one for pale ales, much less strong ones, this was a very winning combination of silky smooth mouth feel with a nice bite on the finish that was very appealing. Not sure I could drink it for an entire night but it is definitely worth a taste."
"Wow, this stuff is strooong! A good strong Belgian-style, but I still prefer other beers over this of similar style. I am re-reviewing this beer now, almost 2 years the day...my how far I have come. Today is July 9, 04. Anyway, back to the beer. Looks beautiful with a huge pillowy head, and is very smooth despite the 9.5 abv. Needs more oomph in the nose to back up its big-beer profile. Aroma is nice, citrusy, spicy, mildy hoppy and alcoholic, but more reminiscent of a Belgian Wit moreso than a Tripel. It's a smooth Tripel as well, which is a bit of an oxymoron. Where's that spicy carbonated bite? I don't know if I should complain or not on that front. One that is quite quaffable but could use some more ""tough-guy"" character."
"i love belgian style ales, and this one does not fall short of expectations. smooth, creamy, and potent as all hell. it goes down great, and gets you hammered with a great taste that is not dominated by malt"

"An exceptional would-be Belgian bier.  Very fruity and spicy aroma with a nice head that fades to a lacey head down the glass.  Great taste from this tripel.  Not as strong as many other tripels (9.5% abv), but still has plenty of kick to offer.  Well worth seeking out.  Prost!"
"I've seen this wonderful golden brew fermenting in their open tanks. What a beautiful sight it is! The perfume in the nose carries over to a fruity flavor on the tongue. The alcoholic content is well hidden and is very drinkable which is scary. This brew is another example of Bill and Ron's desire for quality and responding to what the people want in a beer. Distinctively in the Belgian style, this is made in a small town in PA giving the imports a run for the money. Don't miss this one!"
"Nice gold color and medium body.  This brew presents with more that the usual malty sweetness with a nice hoppy bitter twang half way down the glass.  Easily drinkable and a decent representation of the style.  Deceivingly high in alcohol which is not very apparent oin the flavor or finish."
"Nice yellow color with orange hue and a thick white head.  Noticed some chill hazy and sediment suspended in the beer.  Spicy flavor with some malt sweetness towards the back of the mouth.  Highly carbonated with a pretty large alcohol kick.  Overall a pretty good beer."
"Pours an orange-golden color with a huge, chunky head almost like whipped cream. Head hangs around for a long time and leaves lacy rings down the glass. Aroma is mild, rather citrusy with hints of banana. Mouthfeel is on the creamy side and seems to coat the tongue. Rather cloudy in appearance due to the yeast. Victory calls this a tripel, and though it tastes similar, it's not as complex as some of the Belgian tripels I've sampled. Still a nice beer to get mellow with."
"Thanks to pbrian for sending this my way!"
"I found the color to be surprisingly light: a bright golden color. It's chock full of big floaters (I know, bad choice of terms). The head is thick and bright white. It smells a bit like a cross between a lemon and an orange with big chunks of clove stuck in it. The taste is also full of citrus and spicy sweetness. Although it is warming, I wouldn't have pegged it at 9.5% abv if I hadn't seen it on the bottle first. It's an interesting beer and not quite like anything I've tasted before. However, there are too many good tripels and Belgian strong ales on the market to go out of the way for this one."
"I am now a full fledged Victory fan. I was a little worried about the name and the label, Golden Monkey ? The smell was very strong at the beginning then settled once in the glass. I noticed alot of citrus, fruity, oranges maybe.  Poured a nice cloudy golden color. The head was nice a big and melted down the side of the glass, the taste was delicious. Alot of yeast, but very crisp, citrus, slightly sweet, but very drinkable. Unbelievably drinkable. 9.5 % ABV will sneek right by you. I can't wait to have another."
"Thanks to VENOM for providing me with another knock-out!"
"Pours a nice golden color, a little bit hazy due to some yeasties, with a nice pure white head that sticks well and a nice lace.  Great aroma of spices (coriander?) and citrusy orange zest.  The taste is great, banana, orange, spices and something like grape rind (tartness) in the finish.  The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and it is very drinkable.  Well this is my favorite style and this is definitely a damn fine example of it.  It has all the qualities that I enjoy in the style, light fruit, spiciness, and a little twist in the grape rind.  Definitely something to get your hands on if you can."
"Pours cloudy golden with a fizzy white head an inch thick.  Small sediments make their way through the beverage.  The head has good retention as it laces the glass nicely as I consume this beer.  Aroma is spicy.  Orange peel/orange curaco.  Nutmeg.  Cinnamon.  Very nice.  This beer has some taste.  There's a bit of alcohol.  There's a bit of hard candy.  There's some spice, including cinnamon and pepper.  A bit lemony.  Tangy.  All of this backed up with a nice belgian malt backbone.  Very complex beer.  Has a light-to-medium body I would say.  Very drinkable for a beer with this much alcohol."
"Pours a cloudy golden/orange color, with decent lace. On the nose the aroma is slightly spicy. On the palate flavors are slighty spicy, hints of orange peels, slightly tangy, alcohol makes itself known, slight peppery tones. Mouthfeel is smooth. Warming in the gut in the finish. Good brew!"
"As good of a brewery as Victory is, this tripel is a good example of their excellence.  A sharp, spicy beer where the alcohol content kicks your ass if you don't watch it."
"Instead of a warming alcohol finish, this one has a warming alcohol greeting, but finishes nicely.  There's no deception of strength with I believe marks the great Belgian strong ales, like La Chouffe.  A very good beer none-the-less."
"Man oh man, this is strong @!#$. What a kick, they should have named it after the devil though. Not all Belgian beers are as wild as this, some are just clean, bitter and alcoholic."
"Another winner in the Victory catalog.  A delicious strong Belgian style golden.  Beautiful cloudy, flocculant appearance.  Thems some tasty particles!"
"This really surprised me.  Terrific flavor that I would not expect from an eastern brew.  But, this is from Victory Brewing, fast becoming one of the best breweries in the country and one of my favorites.  Keep the surprises coming."
