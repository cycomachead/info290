4.65,8.9,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Had a bottle at toronado, san diego. Not cheap. Every year Russian River does damnation aged and I figured I would try it out. The bottle says aged with oak chips. Definitely note of something a bit woody with a stronger mouthfeel than regular damnation. Goes down smooth with a bite at the beginning. Taste is similar to damnation with a distinct twist. The appearance is a perfect amber color with a little lace around the glass. It smells a good bit like hay. While I would prefer almost all of Russian Rivers beers over damnation, I do enjoy this beer. Was it worth the 20 dollars I spent on the bottle? Hell no. The idea of drinking a limited beer is nice but I would take most of their other brews over this one. Still very good as are all of their brews. This weekend I take on pliny the younger!","ThaddeusGhostal","Feb 15, 2014"

Aroma which consists of citrus and floral hops are well balanced against the sweet notes of the malt bill. Taste is a great mix between some citrus and floral hoppy notes and some semi—sweet malt notes. Oak is very subtle but seems to bring a rounder taste at the end. Yeast strain a somewhat fruity and can be detected. Body is full with great conditioning and some excellent carbonation with no apparent alcohol. This is a great improvement IMO over the regular version which is just too fruity.","Phyl21ca","Oct 24, 2012"

This wood-aged batch of Damnation is most of those things, yet it is less challenging and seems to be nearer to perfection. Appearing as much like an imperial Sanctification as a wild version of Damnation, it lacks the palate-scorching sourness which has come to define that other beer in recent times. It is beguiling and drinkable, not suggestive of the high (10+ percent) abv, thanks in large part to the rewarding textures it is imparted with.","beagle75","Dec 23, 2011"
4.29,0.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Damnation Batch 23 (69) pours what vacillates between a hazy goldenrod and lemon yellow, depending on the degree of backlighting. The creamy white froth that forms at the top of the glass reaches just short of three fingers in height. Head retention is very good, but lacing is nonexistent (as surprising as it is disappointing). The first whiff is all juicy pale fruits, gobs of granny smith apples and pears. In time a rounded oak-y aroma melds nicely with some light phenolic notes to play against the fruitiness. It would be nice if they were a bit more apparent though. The flavor is a little less one dimensional, as while the fruits still take center stage, everything else jumps out a bit more. Specifically, there's a bit of hoppy bitterness, as well as a slightly more pronounced clove and pepper yeast presence. Woody influence from the oak is a bit more subdued here than in the nose, and there's a light warming sensation from the alcohol. For some reason, my immediate reaction on the first sip was that the beer is overcarbonated, but that's definitely not the case. What is the case is that the body is absurdly light and dry for an 11% beer. The carbonation is creamy and lively, just about spot on. Batch 23 is a bigger, badder version of regular Damnation (a fantastic brew in its own right), and one I'll have to look into getting some more of. Another fantastic beer from Russian River.","axeman9182","Dec 22, 2011"

4,-6.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a medium bodied honey gold in color with a billowing three finger, soapy white head. It took about five minutes for the head to recede. The aroma consists of some spicy Belgian yeasts, orange peels, coriander, fruity esters, and a slight floral componenet (can't pinpoint the flower). It's nice and aromatic. The flavors are smooth and yeasty. I pick up plenty of fruit esters, slight bubblegum, spicy yeasts, more yeast and slight banana. There is also some slight butter, most likely from the oak aging. Since they don't say, I'm curious as to which oak they used. Local, French, etc.? Regardless, it's solid. It drinks very well for being 11% and the alcohol isn't noticeable at all.

This stuff pours a clear pale gold topped by plenty o' cream-white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, bleached wheat, light soap, light balsa, and light banana peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light orange zest and some light Brett-like funk. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' brew, though I feel like the oak was far too subdued for everything's own good (yeah, I admit I was looking for some crispy oak notes in there...). Good times, nonetheless.","TMoney2591","Beers"

Scent is immediately funky with definite barnyard aromas and some tangy, tart fruit scents. A bit of tangerine mixed with cinnamon spice and Belgian yeast. Spicy and fruity with just a bit of hoppiness. Taste is initially bready, buttery yeast flavors with citrus. Funky yeast flavors with some clove and orange flavors. The oak comes through in the flavor more than in the aroma. A bit of alcohol as it warms. Pepper and just a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is very creamy and full bodied. Drinkability is high, especially for such a big beer. Overall, I enjoy this a lot more than regular Damnation. Yet another solid offering from RR.","DovaliHops","Nov 27, 2011"

Flavor doesn't let me down a bit - very similar to nose, but all have more impact, vineous, and flat out tasty. Very true to style. Body and carbonation is similarly true to style.

Mild spice character mid-palate with a little clove, a little pepper. Not particularly yeasty. While a little sweet, this beer dries up quite well on the finish.

You really get more of the oak and just a bit of lemon in the flavor. The oak really smoothes this beer out. Incredibly creamy and velvety smooth in the mouthfeel. This is dangerously drinkable for the ABV. I think the oak aging takes away from my favorite characteristic of the regular Damnation, and that is it's carbonated mouthfeel.

I get the higher alcohol but the oak contribution is less obvious. Extra body is the real story here, which makes the beer much easier to drink and helps the flavors come together a lot more.

Sweet peaches and white grapes up front, even sweeter yeast and malt. Nive vanilla/clove spice combo, close to what you may find in a trippel.

Aromas of strong classic golden ale perfection, apple, a bit of spice from the yeast esthers, sweet biscuity malts, and slightly dead vegetal hops in the back. This version also has a big hot boozy oak note that dominates the front aroma quadrant. Taste si big with the oak and alcohol head, a bit hot at this point but will be oh, so, smooth in about 14 month time. Oak chips, mix with spicy yeast/hop notes with a metallic twinge of biscuit malt in the back palatte. Mouthfeel is smooth, but this is hot which hurts it's drinkability a bit. Still damn good.

If wholee barreels had been used it probably would have been ethereal- especially ones that had been softened by long use. Poured very pale golden with an excellent head that faded tto a ring. Smelled sweet and oaky with some light notes of Belgian yeast. Tastes a bit sweet to start with more oakiness quickly following as well as some apple and pear flavors as well as a bit of straw.

A tiny hint of wood also mixes in throughout. After the first sip, the one thing that comes to mind is a sweet NY Riesling. Honey and pear up front with a spicey corriander tingle. Pleasant oak flavors with a honey and banana combination. The aftertaste is a bit boozey with some vanilla. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy with a medium body. Carbonation is very smooth, I really enjoy how this one feels in the mouth. I may be taking a different approach with Damnation by trying Batch 23 first, but hey, everyone is different. A non-oak aged version is in the fridge waiting as we speak, Batch 30 to be exact. Russian River continues to blow me away. Keep up the good work Vinnie!","BeerTruth","Sep 07, 2007"

4.46,4.4,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Aroma is sweet, lightly spicy, with twinges of alcohol and oak coming out at the end. Taste follows the nose's guide, with the front being the sweet/spice area, and the latter half being oaky and alcohol focused. Halves meld together better as the brew warms. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very impressive. Except this is the only bottle I have, so I'll have to just remember this one, and keep an eye out in the meantime.","ppoitras","Aug 01, 2007"
4.25,-0.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy honey and straw gold with a decent white head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma is sweet honey, soft vanilla, lemon, and some grassiness; a little agitation also produces some nice woody oakiness and some booziness. Nice soft sweetness cushions the palette up front before some lemon and citrus develops, a touch of tartness fights to surface but is held pretty much in check by the sweetness. Nice grassy and straw flavor towards the end mix well with a crisp effervescent bite on the tongue. Alcohol becomes evident mid taste thru the finish but is never overpowering in the taste. Oak flavor also comes in mid taste and pushes into a drying finish. Really wish I had another one of these as this seems that it will develop very nicely with a couple years in the cellar. Thanks to Tim for the chance to try this.","hoppymeal","Beers"
3.7,-13.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from the bottle at the brewery on July 25, 2007 into a thin chalice. I am immediately taken aback by how mellow the oak is. This isnt an overwhelming bourbony oak by any means, just a light dusting of wood and vanilla. Body pours a brilliant and well carbonated gilded copper with a 2 inch off white head that dissipates quickly to a steady but thin lace. Loads of butter in the aroma like a California Chardonnay. Taste is sweet and boozey. Orange and sweet apples, tannins, vanilla, and a touch of spiciness. Chewy and very warming mouthfeel. Barleywine like. Fairly drinkable. I managed to finish the bottle, mostly by my self so it must be. Should improve with time. Plan on revisiting in a couple years.","DaPeculierDane","0"
4,-6.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer definitely is strong, while the 10.5% does not quite hit you over the head, it is still noticeable. I really am enjoying the soft, orange like flavors & aromas in this beer; these notes pair quite well with some of the oak components. I have a feeling this beer will age quite well for a long time. In fact, this beer really needs to age for quite some time as it is a bit too young right now; perhaps a year but maybe even three would do this beer wonders To tell you the truth, I wouldn't be surprised if this peaked at 5 or 10 years even. It is certainly not a bad tipple right now, it is just that I see this getting a lot better.","Gueuzedude","Jul 08, 2007"
4.35,1.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Luckily I am able to get this beer easily from my favorite shop in SF, City Beer! I will lay down several bottles because this one will be a great beer if not already in a few years. I have sent(traded) at least a 6 back east and can't wait to see them review it.","red80go","Jul 06, 2007"
4.4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Quite a bit different from the regular Damnation. I like this a bit more than the regular because the flavor and aroma are more complex and rewarding. Great one-off beer by RRBC. Better get your hands on this while it lasts.","WeisGuy","Beers"
4.32,1.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I really feel that the drinkabilty of this "batch" dropped with the increase in alcohol and body. Overall I feel that this is a very good beer however very different than past Damnations. Sip this one. Plan on laying a couple bottles down.","bosco7","0"
