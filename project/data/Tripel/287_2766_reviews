"Like fine champagne... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset golden-brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light banana peel, light green apple skin, and a touch of spicy yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, with the biscuit and a less-spicy version of the yeast taking full control. Every now and again, some chlorophyll-laden flowers peek their heads in to make sure things are going okay. What diligent babysitters (he says sarcastically). The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, not all that reflective of a tripel, nor all that sparkling. It's not a bad beer, but one I just don't see drinking all that much of in the future."

"A little flat in flavor, but good esters. Wish they surfaced as much in the flavor as in the aroma. Could use age to tame the alcohol."
"This beer needs to dry up and get a serious dose of carbonation. The label also promises northwest hops of which there is barely a trace."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with honey and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells slightly better than it tastes in my opinion."

"Overall, a quality tripel. This is not my favorite style (I prefer dubbels and quads to tripels), but Bell's has made a very enjoyable entry here."

"Overall: I have been searching for this beer for quite some time and was expecting a lot from it. It did not disappoint. I am glad that I found it at Bell's. Very good in every aspect and pretty close to a perfect american tripel."
"This pours a cloudy golden straw color with a tight foam cap. The aroma is nicely spiced with yeasty esters. It’s floral with honey notes, along with some orange peel and coriander. The flavor has a light yet pleasing bitterness. I get orange peel coriander, yeasty esters and a light funk which I imagine might emerge as it develops in the bottle or over time. The effervescence keeps the flavors lively. This is by now a common style but under Bell’s craft it just stands shoulders above the majority. Good stuff!"

"Another tasty beer by Bells, proving that they aren't afraid of the Belgian yeast culture. High drinkability for a relatively high ABV brew - be careful or this one could sneak up on you quickly."
""

"This poured out as a nice slightly hazy golden color with a thin white head on top. The retention is thin and scattered. The lacing is minimal. The smell of the beer is bready, sweet and has a subtle spice note on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet upfront and has a dry fruity spice finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of an oily feel to it. The carbonation was pretty high but should be for the style. Overall it was a pretty good brew, I was glad to see it on draft in my area."
""

"Bell's has done it again!! This beer accentuates the qualities of a good tripel. It has a good bright mouthfeel with a warm finish. The taste is imaginative without being overbearing. The notes are subtle and discreet. It was a fine beer to bring in 2013."
"Served in a pint glass this beer had a thin skimming of white foam leaving no lacing on the glass. Completely clear and golden. Aromas of phenolic clove and yeasty banana esters. Not unlike a hefe. Some spiciness here that would suggest a triple. Tastes like it smells. A spicy aftertaste with just a hint of bitterness. Medium bodied and carbonated. Alcohol is very well hidden. Overall a solid but not outstanding brew. A welcome brew from bells. Better than their dubbel."
""

"Slightly hazed pale gold with a frothy head of clean white foam. Smells very fruity and effervescent with some belgian type yeast. The taste is exceptionally clean and fruity with just a light belgian character to it. Some floral notes as well. So clean and flavorful with about a medium body that dries the palate but leaves no trace of residual flavors. A wonderful take on a tripel. I wish they would bottle this again, as I would love to have this on hand."
""
"It was alright. I got through it but at times didnt know if i would. Thanks TATURBO for thr try. Bottom line, drink 'em if you have 'em."

"This beer is a deep hazy orange with a one finger off white head. The beer is undoubtedly a tripel. There is a slight bitterness up front. The beer sweeps over with a light dark fruit flavor, with figs and raisins. There is some flowery notes, a bit of wheat, a slight lemon grass, a little onion perhaps. This beer is spicy. The Belgium yest is obvious. There is a crispy spiciness, an earthy spiciness. Plenty drinkable for 9%, I do prefer bottle conditioning in my Belgian beers but tap is fine. A solid american take on a Belgian beer. A spicy and hoppier version."

"Overall: Not a bad beer. I have not had many tripels before so I dont have much to judge this beer off of. It was an enjoyable beer."
"O - Light and sweet floral and citrus, refreshing."

"Overall I was reluctant to try this beer because usually belgian styles are not my favorite. This beer really didn't bring the traditional flavors I had come to expect and it really came through like a nice sparkling wine."
""
""
"Overall I would like to try it in a bottle again but sadly can't find any around my state. It's as good as many others I have tried and worth a second visit."
""
""
""
"O- This was very drinkable especially at being 9%, but the flavor and aroma seemed a little restrained for being a triple. Quite refreshing though."
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of a hint of cinnamon, sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of citrus, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of a hint of spice, hint of hop, sweet malt, and slight pale malt. Overall, lacking in appearance and body; good aroma and blend."
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, a little yeasty, grainy, I'm shocked that this beer is 9%. Amazing. Hides it well, good finish, not too dry. I'd have this again."
"Overall for a tripel this is not what I look for. It's an enjoyable beer but I probably wont be wanting to try this again anytime soon. I prefer some creamyness."
""
""
""
"o - overall seems like another american take on a belgian classic. definitely not classic to style, but not bad by any means. seems like a tripel in the way that kerbos from flyingdog is a tripel."

"Overall, this is a great beer for special occasions."

"Fuller medium body, ridiculously high carbonation, very bubbly and tingly on the tongue. This is somewhat like a cross between champagne and a trpel, which has a pretty interesting result. Good, but not great."
""
"Taste is good, but not anything that really stands out. I'll leave it to others to suss out the nuances, but this is more of a belgian pale ale than a tripel. Alcohol is nowhere, at least after a 20oz. Alpha King. I'm at MacNiven's on Massachusetts Avenue in Indianapolis, for the record. I like this place, and they have wireless! It's a bit bourgeois for my taste, but not horrible. They play music, its busy, the beer isn't THAT costly, and they have good stuff on tap. Bombers are prohibitively expensive, though. Oh well, I drink bombers at home, I come here for stuff on tap. But I digress. Pretty one-dimensional ale. Not much of a yeast presence, but its there, sort of a sour-sweet thing going with it. Not a heavily spiced or really heavily flavored ale to speak of. I can appreciate its simplicity but its hardly worth having as a special. Glad I got to try it as I probably never would have bought a six pack of it. Malty. Some hops. You get it."

"The beer is mostly transparent, just slightly hazy. Orange hued with nearly an inch of white head that recedes to a thin layer after a few moments, leaving some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma offers malt, yeast, spice, ripe oranges, hops. The flavor is not up to par with the authentic Belgian tripels. I appreciate that it has a different hop character and is not necessarily trying to replicate something Belgian, however, Bell's Sparkling Ale lacks the delectable quality found in the upper tier examples of the style. Yeast character is lacking. Malt presence is there, but could certainly be more robust and present. Middle class in the style, yet solid and worth a try."
"Pours a medium gold color w/ a thin off-white head. Very clean and clear looking for the tripels I'm used to seeing. Average lacing on the side of my snifter glass. The nose is apple, pear, anise, pepper, and some spices. I'd really like to smell more yeast and malt in this brew, and it's a little on the weak side for me. Taste is fairly sweet, with fruit, spices and pepper coming forward in the flavor. I don't get any of the 9% alcohol at all. Feel is fairly light and dry, w/ a tiny bit of alcohol burn on the aftertaste. Overall, this is a solid brew from an excellent brewery. I would get this again- Cheers."

"Overall the beer is good, though I get tired of it after a awhile. Nice."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a solid beer but there are better ones within the style."
"D= Drinkbility was good, I enjoyed this. Yeasty flavor can be a little overwhelming at times, though."
"Pours a clear golden color with a lovely creamy, fluffy white head. Smells and tastes of sweet bready malt, bananas, cloves with a nice peppery Belgian yeast. Banana really dominates the flavor, which is ok in my book. Slightly peppery and spicy. Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. Nicely drinkable, I wish I had bought bottles of this when I had the chance."
"Drinkabiility (3): I don't think this is a Tripel I'll come back to. Even with the benefit of some age to not down the alcoholic heat, the flavors weren't that impressive although they went together well. Maybe that was a product of the age as well though. Still, this is a below average Tripel in my book."
"Had while at Brewvival! Served from tap into a sampler Brewvival imperial pint. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, subtle banana, and just a hint of alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew, but not very memorable. I had forgotten that I had tried this one until I found it in my notes. After all of the other great brews I tried, this one just wasn't very memorable. Still had a nicely balanced flavor, just not very robust. Worth trying at least once, but that's about it."
"Overall for a triple, this was fantastically drinkable. No hints of alcohol at all and really just amazingly complex. I would love to try this one on tap as I heard it is mind blowing. This is one that needs to be sought out!"
"I really enjoy this beer. I know this gets mixed review on this site, though in terms of American tripels this is pretty high on my list. My guess is that it gets dogged a bit because it's not exactly true to style (when compared to Belgian tripels) though I really think this is a prime example of an American take on this style (kind of like IPAs - you've got your hoppy American styles and your more subtle British varieties). My review reflects my opinion of this being sort of a subgenre of tripel, thus I scored it pretty well. Against other Belgian tripels, I could see how this wouldn't do as well if someone was expecting a similar flavor profile. If you can get a hold of it, this beer is well worth trying and truly underrated. Approach it purely on it's own merits and I think you'll like it."
"Pours a fairly clear light golden color with a fairly large off white head and a good amount of lacing as it goes down. Nose brings a fair amount of Belgian spice and hints of fruit, as well as a bit of sweet bread. Taste adds in a bit of sugar, although it is mostly dry. The earthy spice and fruit flavors are present, but faint. Feel is light and airy, with good carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but isn't much compared to many of the Belgian versions of the style."
"D- Very drinkable, the 9% ABV barely shows itself except for in the flavor just a bit. I could easily drink a couple of thes"
"I'm very impressed with this beer. Very drinkable despite the ABV and very tasty."
"D: Overall a bit of a misstep from a world class brewery. Fuck it. They can't all be Black note"
"Drinkability: high drinkability, it's a light bubbly ale that goes down easy for 9%."
"A semi-hazy golden orange brew with plenty of lively carbonation bubbles an. d a thick white head that slowly dissipates with some lacing. Aroma of light bread malt, orange zest, some yeast and a touch of grassy hops. Flavor is zesty ,peppery with flavors of semi-sweet malt, bready yeast and some spiced oranges,Medium body , clean mouthfeel , dry peppery finish , very drinkable and quite good"
"Sparkling ale pours out a bright golden color with bright penny highlights. Some rising bubbles but nothing producing a head or a cap. Not all that sparkling. Smell is pretty weak all things considered. Getting some faint fruits apples, pears, and plum, but they are very light. A sweet malt hit and just a bit of sugars. Corn. Taste is a step up with the fruits souped up with pears coming out on top with apple and plum after. I do get some corn/ adjunct flavor, light but noticable. Some yeasty bread in the back. Not memorable. This was good but does not hack it style wise. Im a De Dolle guy myself, but I've had better american triples."
"Pours a nice, bright gold color with low, yet spritzy carbonation, minimal head and lacing. Scent is very floral, rose water, pear, apple and fresh grapes. Taste is unique for a tripel, slight candied sugar taste accompanies the rose water, hibiscus, vanilla, pear, apple and grape flavors. Somewhat creamy body, dry finnish and moderate carbonation. A unique beer for the style with a lt of nice floral and fruit notes."
"D. More like champagne than I expected - higher alcohol in the mouth than on the nose, light and fruity on the nose, but a little lackluster on the carbonation. Not a great representation of the style, but a surprisingly champagne-like beer: they hit the bottle's stated target on the mark, but I'm still disappointed that all of the wonderful scents didn't fully transition into the taste."
"Drinkability? Maybe a little too grainy... now that I'm deeper into the session, I'll call it more earthy than grainy, to give it great drinkability for me. I don't know, the flavours come across as a little harsh so I'll say it isn't the easiest drinking Tripel I've tasted but it's interesting. Give it a shot if you see some. You may like it more than I do."
"D- not my favorite style but is drinks really easy. Not a hint of the abv present."
"A nice clear golden color with some white head that leaves little lacing. Smell is largely of some belgian yeast, a bit of clove, and some pale malt notes. A bit of fruit there too. Taste follows suit, with some bigger hop notes than I expected--some grass and leafy-ness. It's good, just more suited to the BSPA category than Tripel (not fruity enough, IMO). Decent MF, a little lacking in the creamy/filling department, could have used a bit more carbonation. This one, however, really wins on the drinkability, easy drinker with well-masked ABV. Good stuff, just not my favorite from Bell's."
"Drinkability isn't bad, but the grassiness interferes more than it balances to me. Still, a well made beer that impresses in more ways than it doesn't."
"I enjoyed this beer. I don't know that I would drink too many of them in one sitting, but I could see enjoying one or two with friends. I think this is definitely a good outdoor beer, sitting on the porch or around a campfire."
"Doesn't live up to the expectation cultivated by Bell's hopslam or stouts, but was solidly enjoyable."
"Pours a deep, dark golden color, with a good three inches of fluffy white head. Good traditional tripel aromas of white pepper, Belgian yeast and some light lemony citrus. Nicely carbonated, this beer is sweet, crisp, malty, nicely hopped with just a bit of drying alcohol coming through in the end. A very good example of the style."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with an average white head - not inspiring, but appearance isn't everything with beer. Fortunately, the rich, fruity, slightly yeasty and slightly sweet aroma promises much better. Flavor is fruity and yeasty, a bit sweet, a bit bitter, with just a touch of butterscotch. Flavor is quite smooth and fairly tingly."
"Thanks to kstrickler for the trade!"
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV & style, doesn't quite pull together for greatness. Booze warmth & syruppyness slow me down more than normal for the style"
"Drinkability is pretty high, the alcohol is masked very well."
"D - Flavors are very light for a tripel...typically I expect things to be a bit more intense. This is very easy drinking...too easy drinking for a tripel. Can't believe this is 9%. This is Belgian in style, but definitely not up to true Belgian examples."
"Notes: I really enjoy this beer. I am glad that I got a six-pack. I would like to say that a beer with this high of gravity that goes down as nicely as this one could be a problem."
"Bell's said this an American Tripel, so I wonder if that is why there is a lack of spiciness. I usually expect spices at the forefront in a Tripel, but it was not to be in this brew. Still, a very solid brew."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: The carbonation is what this beer was about to me. It is very crisp and clean. This beer really has a stunning appearance."
"D: Tastes like a decent trip, but is carbonated. Very interesting blend. Fairly large in body, but accented with forward mouth-feel."
"Wish I could be more descriptive, but getting over a minor cold is killing me. Even so, my senses were awoken by this beer. Very good."
"Overall, while a decent enough beer, it's just not my thing. I don't think I'll be seeking this out again, as this isn't one of Bell's best beers."
"This is crystal clear and pale orange with no head. It has a phenolic aroma with a little underlying honey and green fruit. It tastes like red apple with spicy phenols and esters, and a light, effervescent body. It's funky for a tripel, more saison-like. I always check the ABV before choosing my drinkability score. I literally just said out loud ""Damn! Nine Percent?"""
"A definitely unique beer, although not my first choice."
"Not La Fin du Monde, but still a tasty and satisfying beer."
"drinkability: nice beer, not bad for american belgian"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Pours golden with very slight haze, nicely capped by a white foamy layer. Nose has some interesting lighter fruits such as apple or maybe pear, and bread dough. Palate reveals some alcohol warmth and sweet candied flavors. Finish is sweet and alcoholic."
"very similar to champagne in flavor, but quite a bit heavier and not nearly as carbonated... not really my style of beer, but i much more prefer this to champagne, so i would possibly go for one of these again on special occasions"
"Drinkability- Not bad. Again, not the biggest of Tripel fans but this is decent and not overly sweet. It's pretty damned yeasty though and dangerously drinkable considering the alcohol is nonexistent. Not bad, not bad at all."
"Had this at a microbrew fest. This pours a light golden color with lots of carbonation. Smells quite citrussy with hints of hop. This had a very crisp mouthfeel with a citrus bite. Tasted a little fruity but not too much. Tastes very good, easy to drink. Hard to believe it is 9%."
"Nicely drinkable, but the sweetness slows you a bit. Too sweet for a tripel as far as I'm concerned. Not bad, but I'll stick with Tripel Karmeliet if I'm in the mood for a Tripel. And if I'm in the mood for a Bell's I'll pick something else."
"Drinkability is pretty good! It goes down easy and while not having a tremendously complex flavor it still tastes pretty good. I'm sure there are better examples of the style but its still pretty good and I'd have it again. Maybe only a couple at a time as I feel the alcohol could sneak up on you."
"The flavors of fruit were noticed and the tinge of high alcohol was present, but overall quite enjoyable.. I will definitely purchase again.."
"D - All in all, not my favorite tripel I've had, but by no means the worst. It is definitely one you could easily have a few of. For the alcohol content and the decent flavor, this is a decent choice."
"Note: I guess Bell's has started filtering this beer, 'cos I don't see any cloudiness that some other reviewers have noted."
"D - This is one tripel I could have glass after glass of. Very well brewed and supremely enjoyable."
"(D)- Kind of a bland beer actually. It has some flavors & smells that fits into the style, but overall a disappointing representation of what makes a great Tripel. Not one of Bell's best efforts."
" Very drinkable America Tripel. Alcohol is masked very well for a 9% brew. Definitely one I would be willing to drink a couple in a sitting."
"Overall, very ok."
"Loosely knit had of multiple bubble sizes, huge upon the pour but settles down into a half finger of dimpled white foam, highly credible amount of lacing left behind. Perfectly clear pumpkin orange color, yellows some around the rims, kinda looks like a cheap adjunct lager. The nose couldn't smell any different than what it looks like, sweet fig, apricot, date, pear fruit, orange juice, baker's yeast, some wet hop, herbaceous notes, the ginger, coriander spice a touch lower than expected, still here it fits the beer type. Medium-bodied, extremely smooth and fluid, the carbonation subtle and makes no sudden moves. Pepper lifts the ginger, coriander, allspice, not that sweet overall. Peach, apricot, pear takes precedence over date or fig. The orange and lemon citrus on the dry side, leaves plenty of room for the moss, forest floor earth. The breadiness and honey most apparent through the finish. Seems like a take on a style within the ""house idiom"" which is interesting but not to be confused with the original."
"D - I'm quite the fan of some of the big Belgian tripels, and maybe I'm being a little harsh on Bell's because I was expecting more. An enjoyable beer overall, it just can't hold a candle to it's Belgian brethren. Worth a try but probably not a standout to the tripel aficianado."
"D: Not a very good tripel overall. Misses on multiple style points with high alcohol presence, thick syrupy feel, light aroma, and metallic aftertaste. I imagine it's filtered now as the yeast profile is low and the slightly hazy appearance with some suspended yeast described in older reviews is not there in the nowadays version."
"Can't say I find anything exceptional about this save for it's very well carbonated. Flavor goes about halfway into tripel territory but falls short of the complexity that defines the style. Overall not bad at all."
"Overall, a very tasty beer with just a tinge too much sweetness for me. But good."
"Mouthfeel is sparkling as the name indicates but actually not too carbed. Drinkbility was good, I enjoyed this. Yeasty flavor can be a little overwhelming at times, though."
"Mouthfeel is a slight weight to it. Not exactly light bodied, but less than medium bodied. Very crisp carbonation keeps each sip fresh. I have a tendency to ignore tripels, which is why I often miss out on tasty beers like this."
"Eric"
"Very easy to drink and high ABV beer from my hometown. I have cellared this for a year previously and just added one to my cellar."
"D Good drinkability for the style. I finished the somewhat large glass within about 10 minutes. 4.0"
"This is pretty decent, but not quite as good as some of the Trappist instances of the style."
"D: A nice example of the Tripel style from a brewery that typically only does the English side of things. Worth a shot, but not worth seeking out."
"The brew is enjoyable and is probably what I have come to expect from an ""American Tripel"". There are better Trips out there but this one isn't too bad."
"Really enjoyable flavors in this beer match with a light, effervescent body that makes it immensely drinkable. The 8.2% ABV is only an afterthought in the warming sensation that develops in my cheeks overtime. The fruity esters provide some syrupy sweetness that combines well with the depth of the toasted, almost cracked tasting malts. There's a clear tart bitterness that matches perfectly well with the bright, bubbliness of the beer. The aftertaste hints at caramel and the sweet stickiness of apricots and raisins. Finish is slightly dry despite a subtle sticky coating on the tongue."
"As I said before, the finish is super dry and leaves a spicy character on my palate. Very easy drinking and this could probably sneak up on you."
"D- It's an easy drinker for the style. I plan on putting a few back during the Christmas and New Year's celebrations. It might not be quite up to the authentic, Belgian counterparts (though I don't know that it's supposed to be. I think Larry was going for an American take on the style). Then again, it's a lot more affordable than most of the imports. Very solid beer."
"The primary flavor I get is banana bread with a certain sour element, like it's slightly moldy. There is a creamy aspect to the flavor as well that goes nicely with the banana, but the body IMO is too thin for this style. And overall I feel as if this has good flavors but not enough to carry this through to being a great triple, although it's a good introduction...and they do call it an American Triple."
"Well carbonated and a full medium body, very nice drinker, not a great tripel but a good one."
"D- easy to drink with a deceptively high ABV. another quality beer from bells. glad to see this one on my shelf finally."
"Taste: More cloves and bubblegum. Clove aspect comes through stronger in the taste. Leaves my mouth with a sweet syrupy feel. Mild hop bitterness in the finish."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a very slightly clouded gold with a minimal white head. Very dough-forward nose. Spices are there, but not as strong. Much more of the spice on the flavor as it really kicks on that first sip and stays throughout. Feel is about typical I would say. This is a pretty easy drinking tripel, even though the level of spice character is high. Decent."
"D- This one has a strange taste on the end that Im not too fond of. Ive definitely had better tripels...*cough*La Fin Du Monde*cough*"
"This shows potential, but if they did bump up the quality we wouldn't see it being affordable anymore."
"M/D: Medium-full body, pretty surprising actually. Notes of alcohol. Carbonation is champagne like and provides a nice fizzy sensation on the tongue. Pretty drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden."
"I like this beer as a thirst quencher, I find it hard as a seasonal. I guess it's only claim for seasonal is the champagne like bubbliness and dryness and it certainly delivers in that department. An interesting drink and I'd be happy to have more in future but won't be going out of my way looking for it."
"Notes: nothing spectacular, but a great interpretation of a tripel"
"Overall a pretty good Tripel."
"Poured a light brown color with quite a bit of sediment floating in the beer. Smells malty with a little fruity sweetness. The taste was initially very malty. As the beer warmed I got a little bit of a citrus aftertaste. It leaves a very yeasty sweet taste in the mouth after the drink. Goes down very well and is a very good tripel."
"Rich creamy head that dissapates quickly. Very little lacing. The aroma is gently citrus/orange with hints of spice. The taste is rich and the high alcohol level is apparent - almost numbing the tongue. Fruity with a nice aftertaste with a slight hop tinge. Reminds me of a Fin du Monde. Pretty good stuff, but a little pricy. (10.99 for a sixer) Served a 12oz bottle in a snifter."
"12 ounce bottle purchased at Goldstein's Deli in Kingston for $2.25. Poured into my Maredsous chalice and appears a slightly hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of bone white bubbly head. The head leaves no lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of spicy yeast, fruity notes such as green apples and grapes, bready malt. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and quenching with little alcohol presence."
"D: Pretty nice and refreshing. A nice gateway beer for those wishing to try a belgian triple but are afraid of the bigger, funkier ones."
"Drinkability: That biting aftertaste keeps you coming back for more. Overall very drinkable. However, with a slightly higher alcohol content, you'll be feeling it more after just one than your average beer."
"D: Something I could drink a few of.. tasty mellow, and very refreshing..If they were trying for champaign, then they failed, but they did make a great beer."
"Overall, this is a very delicious belgium treat. I love bell's and I love this beer. It is over a year old, but it tastes pretty fresh to me."
"Pours an extremely cloudy, somewhat fizzy orangish color. Small head, white, somewhat lasting. Small bubbles. Strong sweet Belgian ale aroma. Floral, alcohol, very strong overall. Warm mouthfeel, flowery, pollen aftertaste. Somewhat sweet, slightly bitter. Strong alcohol. One flavor dominant - flowers."
"Bright yellow color with a white head that dissipates to a bubbly ring around the glass and spotty lacing. Aroma is yeasty, with bits of bubblegum, hay, chamomile, and a touch of creamed corn. Taste has chamomile, bread dough, banana, and some sort of spice, perhaps clove. Pretty high carbonation with medium body. I didn't really know what to expect when I tried this, but what I found was a nice little Tripel. I could probably see myself getting this from time to time."
"M/D - Very interesting beer, I can't say I love it, but I did enjoy trying it. The mouthfeel was nice but the sweetness might have overdone it for me."
"Notes: this ale is not as clear and pretty as some of the other Triples, also, the taste is sort heavy on the sweet side for a Tripel, there are other examples of this style I enjoy more."
"Notes from 3/3/06"
"This would be a good beer to introduce someone to the Tripel style. It doesn't have anything that's too ""in your face"" about it, has a nice light sweet taste to it, and the higher alcohol is hardly evident. While it's not the best Tripel I've had, I thought this was a good example of the style."
"it pours a sligtly hazy golden color with no head. it smells sweet and malty. there are hints of apples as well as booze. it has a pretty light body and a nice light carbonation. it tastes very heavy though, even syrupy. the sweetness and booziness stand out."
"D - Great taste and mouthfeel, Bell's rocks"
"D= This is not the best tripel I have had, or even in the top 5 North American interpretations of the style. That said, it is not a bad beer and certainly worth a try before Bells' impending discontinuation of Sparkling Ale."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with lots of sediment floating throughout. The fluffy white head receded to a bubbly cap leaving no lacing. Yeasty smell with hints of fruits, mainly bananas, and some candied sugar. Hints of spices are present in the aroma as well. The taste is sweet and fruity up front with a definite banana flavor which gives way to the yeasty backbone in the middle. The spices are present but subtle in the taste as well leaving a little kick in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and maybe a tad thin with good carbonation. This is not the best or most complex tripel I've had but it goes down easy and is quite drinkable."
"Damn glad I picked this stuff up. It's a shame they are retiring it. Tastewise, I actually think I enjoyed this one more than the Allagash Tripel. The only downside is all those floaters in the beer, it still tastes good though. If you see this stuff I would recommend getting some before it's gone for good."
"Well rounded and worth seeking out. I want more."
"MK"
"Pretty drinkable for its strength, but not something I would seek out at all."
"It never fails to amaze me that so many excellent American brewers seem absolutely incapable of making good Belgian knock offs. Rogue's no good at it, Three Floyds is no good at it, and now Bell's is no good at it. This beer isn't horrible, it's not or even bad, but it's not up to snuff with what you expect from a brewery of this caliber. `"
"Addition- had a 2007 bottle in august of 2009 and the flavor was not as good. Sort of biscuity and plain."
"D: One glass, at 8.2%, is more than enough."
"Drinkability: High abv, but it's not harsh or hidden poorly. A fairly dry and interesting Tripel - call it an American interpretation - that's not outstanding, but that's definitely unique and worthy of picking up a sixer. Give it a shot!"
"D: Great Triple, not too heavy on the spicing, great flavor and balance. Deceptively strong, but still very drinkable. Matter of fact, the more I drink the more I want more of this beer!"
"The higher alcohols and fusels get to be a bit much at times; they actually almost give me a headache. A decent beer that seems to be lacking some depth. Actually if it wasn't for the hotness of this beer it would be quite enjoyable and flavorful."
"D - A great American take on the Tripel, although it would be an average Belgian version. Alcohol is very well hidden. Another impressive beer from Bell's."
"Good beer overall, but if the flavor matched the nose it could have been great. Reminds me a lot of Batch 8000, but more balanced with a toned down sweet-and-spiciness and more citrus."
"More bitter than a typical tripel but it's done well. Different and worth a try for sure."
"All in all, a very nice tripel."
"Poured this into a pint glass, pours an awesome yellow with some serious suspension in the glass, hold it up to sunlight to see what I mean, this is about the best thing I enjoyed about this beer. Smell has that belgium smell with nice fragrance coming from the nose very sweet with hints of lemon and outdoor freshness. Taste to me was pretty difficult, the alcohol was very present and hard for me to drink this, taste was a bit of a mess like a nice hefe with a strong weird alcohol grape taste in there, boy was this a mess. Well to put it midly Bell's brews some of the best beers imo in the world, this is not up there."
"D: Nice take on a tripel, but I'm not overly impressed. Alcohol is a little too strong and overall taste is little too cloying and earthy. Like most Bell's beers, I like it, but don't love it."
"D- It's decent but probably won't be getting it again."
"I had one of these, it was very nice, I could probably go for one more, but then it's time for something else."
""
"Not bad for a triple. Better head and a fuller body would be nice, but it's still worth a try."
"Overall Impression: Wow. I was thinking this was a blonde ale, boy was I wrong. American Triple, ok, I can see that. Belgian yeast characteristics save the day for me on this one. The alcohol is heady and heavy handed (and go a bit fusel) making this a sipping beer for sure. Some really nice flavors, I think it would cellar nicely (which makes dating all the more important!)"
"Drinkability: Chalk this one up as another domestic failure to pull off a Belgian tripel; for some reason this style gives our better brewers fits"
"Bright gold with a little head and enough ""floaties"" to make the glass look like a glass snow globe that you shake up. LOTS of sediment. Sweet fruity aroma. Kind of thick and sweet in the mouth... Just like this style is supposed to be. Reminds me of that banana/apricot/clove sort of taste that La Fin Du Monde has. Good beer. Hard to tell it's 8.2% ABV."
"More carbonation might have made it easier to drink, and gave it a better, more pleasing appearance as well. otherwise, it was an average tripel at best."
"Paired this with chicken satay. It went okay, but was too sweet and powerfully flavored for the lighter accompaniments of steamed veggies and rice."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thick but balanced out by the carbonation. I did expect a bit more carbonation by the description on the bottle, but this is actually closer to the style I guess. Nice to try one, but not a beer or style I'd go to often."
"Drinkability- Not the greatest, both the high ABV and the high oxidation content make it a bit difficult to choke down a 6 pack of it. Being that this is the last one I have though, it was pretty easy to put down 12oz."
"Another winner by Bell's."
"Overall: We all know that Bells' can make wonderful beers and I guess I can add triple to the styles that they have perfected. It is one of the better triples brewed outside Belgium. Bell's has another winner with this one as I venture thru their beer list I become more and more amazed as I drink beer after beer, style after style."
"Bottle courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a cloudy yellow with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with some sweet malt. Taste is a mix between some interesting fruity ester, some sweet malt which may include some wheat. Full body with some great carbonation but some light alcoholic phenol which were not too upfront. While I really enjoyed this beer I thought it lacked some complexity and subtlety."
"Thanks to Rblwthacoz for the sample."
"The mouthfeel is nice and light with some beautiful carbonation. Quite drinkable despite the abv. It's a good beer, but nothing outstanding."
"Bell's Sparkling Ale pours a stiff finger of white foam over a slightly cloudy tea colored brew. There is a certain amount of suspended particulate matter but this is a Belgian styled beer, after all. Carbonation is steady, and the nose is fruity and spicy- also quite typical of the style. The flavor is bright light malts backing up against crisp herbal hops, with, again, notes of fruit, clove, and grain. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and a bit dry. I went to the Bell's website, and entering this beer's batch number (8204) discovered that it was bottled on November 15, 2007, and the alcohol by volume (not listed on the bottle), was a delightful 9%. For all it's lightness of body and flavor, Bell's did a fine job controlling that alcohol burn- it only makes itself felt as a warming effect. This is why Bell's is one of my favorite brewers. Get it if you can- but be careful- it really sneaks up on you!"
"Poured from bottle into flute. Golden hue with high carbonation and sediment. Almost no head...first sign of trouble. Smell is lemon/citrus. Taste adds spice and maybe coriander, but is much weaker than anticipated. For a self-styled tripel--this is one of the weaker versions. On the positive side, it is light and drinkable (especially considering the ABV), but I expect more from Bell's."
"quality, should try, might buy again"
"Drinkability: Yikes. A decent experiment I suppose, or one that should've been, but I'd stick to the other failsafe Bell's brews. I was curious about this from the beginning, because I wasn't sure, with what their brewing staples are, why and how and if they could pull this off. And I wouldn't want to try this again. Thankfully I just got the one bottle. Go for a 4-pack of an import or a nice corked and caged Belgian. Cheers to branching out, but not if it's going to be a seemingly mediocre attempt."
"Drinkability: No thanks. Cloying and somewhat of a chore to finish the single bottle."
"Got this one in the bottle at the Brickskeller in DC. Pours a very little, yellowish color, clear, with tons of bubbles. Nose is good, wheaty with a lot of bubblegummy fruitiness. Taste is likewise, a fair bit of alcohol, along with wheat, spices (corriander?). A nice flavor, although not one that really blows me away like a lot of tripels I've had. Feel is highly carbonated, which I guess is the point, although I prefer a tripel a little more mellow. Overall, it's a tasty beer, although it doesn't really blow me away in one of my favorite styles of brew."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid pale malt scent along with an earthy/fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a full flavored pale malt taste that goes down smooth and silky with little warmth. The yeast provides a fruitiness as well as a dry earthy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It a fine take on the tripel style, but it's far from the best around."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a thin head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is an abundant blend of spice, Belgian yeast, sweet malts and a hint of citrus hops. The taste is a bit on the malty side for the style, but the yeast and spice are not far behind at all. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a decent amount of warming alcohol. This is yet another enjoyable beer from Bell's, certainly the best American Tripel available in six-packs I've had yet."
"D: Pretty good. This one would be a great starter for people who are interested in trying to get in to Belgiums."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is good. Around 8% seems good for this beer. It's smooth and pretty drinkable. Overall, it's solid. Not a huge fan of the style, but this one is far from bad."
"Pours a very slightly clouded gold with a minimal white head. Very dough-forward nose. Spices are there, but not as strong. Much more of the spice on the flavor as it really kicks on that first sip and stays throughout. Feel is about typical I would say. This is a pretty easy drinking tripel, even though the level of spice character is high. Decent."
"D - This is a very good beer. A nice interpretation of a Belgian ale."
"Overall, my least favorite from Bell's, which is becoming one of my favorite breweries. BUT, I'm much more an American Hop guy than a Belgian Tripel guy, so please take my opinion with a grain of salt."
"This Tripel from Bell's is delicious and quite easy to drink even with the 8% alcohol. So be careful, they'll sneak up on you."
"Didn't realize it was 8% alcohol... it certainly doesn't taste like it."
"I was slightly disappointed with this Bell's offering as I really enjoy most of their offerings. Kind of sweet. This was a subpar belgian, in my opinion, but a nice effort. 8% abv + so the drinkability is somewhat low, but arent most Belgians? Just a bit off overall to me."
"Light straw color with a thin white head. Pleasant aroma of yeast, sugar, bubblegum and coriander. Flavor is the same, but this is not as sweet, which is great - it has more body and silkiness, leaving more complex and lush flavors without the extra sugar rush. This almost reminds me of a cross between a Saison and a Tripel. I actually went into this with a skeptical attitude (""sparkling ale"" huh?) but this here is proof that serious quality can overcome prejudice when it pleads its case well. Some prophecies are not always fulfilled by the self."
"d: No session beer. Sweetness and booze are too much. I'm not a huge tripel fan, but this is pretty good. Better than average probably, but nothing amazing."
"D - Okay. A good flavor, but a bit much for every day drinking. A nice treat however."
"I'm a sucker for packaging. The label and description had me salivating for a light, bubbly effervescent beer - it does compare itself to champagne. But then, it also calls itself a tripel. First, nothing sparkling going on here. These are still waters. Dark gold, some yeasty haze, and a tight white head that is coaxed back up with gentle swirling. Smells are strong up front - alcohol and yeast. At first, I was not taken with the taste, but I appreciated this beer much more once the 2nd bottle had warmed up a bit. Characteristics of a wit and a saison are both present. Sweetness of a tripel is dominant, but never cloying. Alcohol is present, but never offensive. Mouthfeel is this beer's strongest point - smooth and delicious, making this beer much more drinkable than the aggressive flavor profile would lead you to believe. Not the beer that I was expecting, but I must say I like it."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange yellow with small yet fluffy head. The nose is very yeasty and wheaty. smells like a witbier. Wow! wonderful triple flavors! awesome yeast and wheat flavor with a touch of banana on the finish. Nice and creamy and very very belgian in character. The mouthfeel is flawless. I beleive this is a wonderful tripel! Incredibly drinkable and by a ways the most belgian tasting american made ""tripel"" I have tried as of yet. Mad props to JCB for this inclusion. Very very good. I am jealous of those with easy access to this!"
"Sparkling Ale ain't a standout, but it's pretty solid, easy to drink, and an easy introduction to the style for folks getting started down the Shining Path. Er, Sparkling Path? Well, whatever path leads into an appreciation of Tripels, this is a decent first step."
"Crisp and spicy with a medium body. Some citrus. A little alcohol in the finish. This is a very easy drinking beer for the ABV, maybe a little too easy! I'll look forward to drinking this again next winter."
"Overall this is a pretty easygoing take on the triple style, something I'd drink again."
"Drinkability: Very good beer that could be enjoyed at any time, not just winter. Good complexity and very smooth. Definitely worth seeking this one out."
"D: Strong brew. I'm having this in my early Sunday afternoon. I may have to nap afterwards. Seems like good beer to quaff after a day at the slopes. Sit by the fire and enjoy one then have a hearty dinner. Then take off your skies and throw them in the fire."
"Medium bodied, easy enough to drink with a good carbonation level and just a bit of alcohol warmth at the end. Not quite up to a good Belgian tripel but still a good effort."
"I got this Bell's offering on tap at the Brew Kettle on 12/28/07. It came to me a bit on the cold side and in a cool looking tulip glass. This Bell's was a hazy tangerine color with a small tint of amber. It could have been the shape of the glass, but it had a minimal head of white foam with decent retention that left behind a hand full of small white rings and few small white streaks of lace. The smell was heavy with Belgian yeast. Behind that heavy yeast aroma was some juicy fruits, floral hops, and a slice of banana. The taste was very Belgian like. The taste was fruity with juicy fruits, Belgian yeast, dry citrus hops, a pinch of toasted malts, and just a dab of sweet banana. The mouthfeel was very slick! It completely masked its 8.2% ABV. The aftertaste was that of bitter citrus hops and Belgian yeast. This aftertaste was not long lasting, but still very good. It's not my favorite Bell's beer, but it was a nice take on a Belgian style of beer."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Wow, I can honestly say this is the first beer from Bells that I didnt completely enjoy. I knew that day would come but I didnt think it would be today. Poured a hazy golden with lots of suspended yeast. It had a big head that disappeared quickly, left no lacing. Aroma is sweet maltiness with bananas and spices. Taste is strong on bananas and yeasts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty dry. I can see how many people would like this beer, just not me."
"Nice golden color with a fine white head. Lots of suspended yeast floating around. Some fruity smells and a lot of sweet maltyness. As it warms the 8.2% shows itself to the front with the phenol burn in the nose and on the tongue. Taste of banana and butterscotch. Malty at first but then the ABV comes to the front. This one turns into a real sipper. Not sure that the name sparkling really fits this one. It's not a bad beer but it is not what i was expecting at all."
"Nice clear golden color but a pitiful head. Aromas of golden apples, pear, lemon rind, and butterscotch malt all carried by a moderate alcohol ester. Fruit flavor is about the same as the aroma with a some floral, spicy herbal hop characters for depth. Yeasts offering the usual tripel phenols and the malts have a buttery, nutty character and develops a touch of salty as it warms. Medium bodied and subdued yet enjoyable carbonation is still better than the pour had shown. Pretty good tripel for an American."
"Bottle. Poured a clear golden color with a light white head. Some lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast and banana. Nice mouthfeel, with about the perfect amount of carbonation. Flavor has a lot of apricot and banana in it, with that Belgian yeasty aftertaste. Yet another solid Bells offering."
"-Oelergud"
"M/D: Heavier than thought, carbonation is just right (but for a ""sparkling ale"" you would think there would be more). Drinkability is OK, I could have another but not if I had another tripel option."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was pilsner looking and I was excited to try something along that line from this great company. Head was good and white. Smell was hoppy. The taste was NOT good. Very fruity and a tad sour. It tasted like a Belgian ale to me which I'm not all that fod of. Alcohol was over the top also. If you like Belgian sour beers (Abbey) then try this. However I will not try it again."
"i think larry bell did a fine job with this one. appearance lacks a little... pale golden with a head that has minimal retention and little lace. smells is great. sweet bread, some clove, spice, and a little hop. just like a tripel should. reminds me a little bit of st. bernardus tripel. tastes almost the same. maybe it should get more points. mouthfeel is just short of belgian classic. i know they call it bubbly, but it doesn't seem as live going down as my favorite tripels. easy drink, and you'd never know it was an 8% abv beer. overall, i'm very pleased, and am glad that an american made a belgian style beer that doesn't suck. it seems like bell's can do no wrong, and i really hope they keep it up!!!"
"Mouthfeel is light, verging on medium light. Enjoyable. I could drink this beer, but it isn't my favorite for the style. I think this just gets beat on all fronts, though. Brooklyn Local 1 is a better American belgian style beer, and golden monkey comes in a fairly inexpensive variety case with hopdevil, prima pils, and V lager, so i don't know if i will return to this, but it is good and definately worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body, the higher levels of carbonation are appropriate. Finish is dry. This is an easy beer to drink, good for a slow sip, but I don't think this is one I'll buy again. There are many others that I've had that are way better, stylistically speaking."
"Overall, a Tripel with more body and flavor than usual. More of a heavy-duty witbier. Very solid, an enjoyable beer."
"This ""sparkling"" ale is just that. The beer continues to bubble as it sits in my corsendonk snifter. Golden in color with a nice, white head that quickly dissipates. Its crazy how the bubbles continue to flow from the middle of the glass at the bottom to the top. This is the ""champagne of beers"". Smells like a belgium, sweet, little spice, with a mild alcohol taste (depending on temperature). Definately better than most american versions of a tripel. When you look through the glass, you see so much yeast floating around, maybe thats what keeps it bubbling??? Smooth mouthfeel, decent lacing, all in all a very well crafted, intriguing brew from Bell's that is sure to please. I didnt see any bubbles in this beer when i poured it into a pint glass, so make sure to use the right glass!!!"
"The ratings I gave aren't the greatest, but this was a pretty decent beer. I like it better than Victory's Golden Monkey, but it's a step down from some other tripels I've had. The strange thing was the lack of head on this beer. But the taste and mouthfeel were fine despite the appearance."
"Surprisingly full bodied and higher gravity. It still manages to have a clean bright finish even with all the Belgian character. Moderate/high carbonation. Not at all what I expected. A very nice surprise. I shouldn't have underestimated Bell's; they've never wronged me."
"12 oz single into a wine glass. its golden amber appearance is surprising and looks much more pale than belgian tripels. taste is vastly different from belgians like delirium. spice (cloves and coriander?) up front and dominant non-citrus fruits make it taste much more like a cider than a tripel. but it certainly is drinkable. it's crisp carbonation and light body feel like a session beer. i was a bit disappointed but it's worth a try."
"This falls far from its genuine counterpart, as it displays no complexity. It is light and refreshing which helps me forget the lack of depth."
"D- Strong, but tasty. Not the best tripel or one of the more memorable offerings from Bell's. It is worth a try though."
"Not terrible, but not great either. I suppose it's ok for an American-made tripel, but that's really the best praise I can give it. I can't really think of anything horribly wrong with it. It's just very average. There are better options available."
"D - If you put the appearance part aside, I found this beer to be quite drinkable."
"D-No where near my favorites for tripels. I am not sure if it was a bad bottle or not, but this one lacked balance."
"Overall, an OK trippel. It's a little sweeter than usual. The flavors just rub me a little wrong."
"Sorry, Larry, but this one didn't do it for me."
"I hope this makes it's way to the shelves here in NC, I'd like to experimant w. this a bit more!"
"I have a bottle of this well over a year and a half in age in the cold cellar, I'm curious to see how it will pair with this fresh sample. Guess we'll have to keep waiting until another special occasion..."
"Mouthfeel was slick and creamy with prickly alcohol/carbonation. A sweet film coats the lips."
"D - This is my first tripel so I have nothing to compare it to, but I did enjoy drinking this beer."
"Possibly the cloudiest, hazy-est beer I've ever had. Lots of chunky yeast floaters. Nice rich amber color with a thin head. Smells like a funky cider. Some pear, tart and sweetness, with a tart, almost sour aftertaste. Biggest downside is the sweet, almost cloying mouthfeel, but the finish is dry enough to make it dangerously drinkable. Probably could only have 1-2 before it became overpowering, but this one is disappearing very quickly. Highly recommend letting this one spend some time alone in the cellar before drinking."
"D: Well, thats different. Too bad it was based on a tripel style, which I'm not a fan of. But I like the concept here and appreciate the effort."
"Paid $1.99 for a single, beer pours a very hazy peachy-gold color with a nice two finger creamy head. The smell of the beer is of spicy malt, slightly fruity, and if you try really hard, maybe some miniscule amount of alcohol - well hidden. The alcohol is also well covered in the taste, with the same spicy malt flavor and a decently hoppy finish. To be honest, the first drink was a little off-putting, but after a few swigs I really like it. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with thick, creamy carbonation. Overall I have to say that this is a pretty drinkable beer, given its relatively high alcohol content."
"Overall, this 2 year old Belgian strong ale has held up pretty good. Im guessing the taste is probably more subdued and the alcohol has overtaken the flavor. Besides the palate and appearance having declined (again, Im guessing), the flavors are still there in enough force to be enjoyed. I will have to try a fresher version to compare."
"Not so drinkable for a guy that doesn't have a sweet tooth. Also, the incessant tartness slowed it down too much for me."
"It IS a trippel, so it would not likely be considered all-night drinking fare. Still, it is a very smooth and exceptionally pleasing beverage so I wouldnt mind having more than one."
"Bright, golden apricot with a bold, slightly hazy core. Fluffy, long-lasting, off-white head. Nose is honey-soaked biscuits, honeydew melon, metallic powdered sugar yeast, and fruit cocktail alcohol. Sweet, fruity malt strong over fresh hay and spicy pepper. Sweetness rounds out more sugary, with increasing heat and minty bitterness in the finish. Yeast is noticeable and good. Full, creamy mouthfeel, that coats the mouth well. Another nice ale from Bells."
"Nice carbonation but slightly thin mouthfeel. A tripel that hides it's alcohol under it's sleeve making it very accesible."
"I enjoyed this beer and can tell there was definitely quality & craftsmanship involved in it's making; but it's not the best tripel I have ever had."
"While I like this it probably will annoy some drinkers. That strong herbal bitterness could get annoying after a while or under the wrong circumstances. I like it so I did bump the drinkability up a little bit."
"M: smooth and drinkable, not as carbonated as I had thought it would be."
"A white fluffy head sits upon an apricot tinged sparkly gold body in a white wine glass at Maduro. Head is lasting and carbonation is highly active and very appealing to the eye. Aromas of bready yeasts and toasted malts form a base under a peppery spice and citric finish. Tastes of bread and toast with lemon/lime jam, pepper, and just a hint of light alcohol. Feel is sparkling, mediumbodied, and mildly warming. Drinkability is decent but the alcohol sugars, which become noticeable when the beer warms to room temp, create a sweet coating on my palate that prohibits me from drinking more than two glasses. Overall, I find this to be an impressive trippel, largely because it grasps subtlety and isnt overly sweet, tropical, or banana filled as so many American trippels are."
"D: Drinkable, but one a night would suffice."
"Mouthfeel- Dry pallet with a slight tart, almost bittersweet finish."
"Drinkability - this is very good, and it goes down well, high abv limits sessionability."
"Batch 6636 - Pours a medium orange color with a thin head ... complex lacing in the Duvel tulip glass. A MASSIVE amount of yeast sediment in the suspension. Nose is wildly fruity, and definitely has the Belgian yeast notes all over the place. Sweet candy aromas as well. Some odd scent too ... can't place it, but it's not offensive, just odd. Palate is quite sweet upfront with sugary fruit flavors, yeast, and some spiciness from the yeast strain. Quite smooth and thick in the mouth. Alcohol is detectable and warms nicely. Mouthfeel is medium - heavy and quite warming. Some alcohol bite, and a lingering sweet malt and candy sugar finish. This is a wild Tripel. Kind of reminds me of Delerium Tremens a bit ... Quite good. If I didn't know better, I'd think this one was from Belgium, not Bell's! Good stuff."
"Massive amounts of floating sediment suspended in a bright amber body with a big foamy white head. What do they mean by ""sparkling ale?"" Sediment just makes it look cloudy. Odor is mostly a European hop smell with some pear/apple odors too. Not a massive smack of flavor like i expect from a tripel....instead a smooth pear (and other fruit) taste with hops and spices that is very mellow and tasty. Mouthfeel is slightly harsh with the obvious alcohol zest stinging a bit. This last also hurts the drinkability somewhat. Overall i think its another delicious Bell's treat and i'd grad some more if i ever see it again anywhere (i bought this single bottle at the Bell's general store in Kalamazoo)."
"Bell's Belgian-style beer pours with a classic tripel color and lots of yeasty cloudiness. The smell is fairly straightforward, with white fruits and some spiciness (nutmeg?) dominating. Smells like a tripel. On the palate this one is initially quite sweet, with a ton of candi sugar asserting itself, followed up by some thick bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty full, with lots of carbonation. Overall, this one drinks as one of the better American tripels, but not up to the standards of Belgium."
"Batch 7134, bottle conditioned since Nov '05. Pours with cloudy golden straw body and tons of off-white, sticky head. Smells wheaty, floral, slightly lemony and a hint smoky. Definitely some earthy yeast aspects coming through in the nose. All that and more in the palate; definitely more earthy/smoky aspects, somewhat medicinal with hints of mandarin orange. Remarkably mellow carbonation for the nearly-explosive head; maybe I just poured badly. Definitely a noticeable level of fusels; I suppose it's not TOO hot for being 8.2 and all, but the bite does affect the drinkability a bit."
"D - Refreshing and definitely complimentary with a meal. Very good representation of the style, but without any extraordinary points."
"a stand-up american belgian-style that needs some refinement to measure up to the big boys. but like others have said, this measures up to golden monkey and other similarly semi-accurate tripel clones."
"Taste; yeasty and spicy with coriander, and touches of pepper. The fruits are there with bananas, oranges and pineapple. The malts come across more like cookie dough, instead of bread dough, with the sweetness that the beer has. Even though this is so sweet, it doesn't come across as cloying in my opinion, with juct a touch of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and very drinkable."
"over all a good beer, its not quite a tripel and not one of bells best but still a good beer and worth the buy. it just seems to be lacking something that a good tripel has, mbc has the same problem with there tripel, i think they have to much body."
"Thanks for sharing Mike!"
"Very drinkable, though it does taste boozier than other similar beers. It reminds me very much of a Belgian stong pale ale. A good sipper, went well with my lunchtime sandwich."
"It was good, damn good, but I wouldn't want to re-visit this again. I'll stick to Pales and Porters."
"Golden amber with a generous, bright white head. Plenty of lacing. Bready, lemony aroma with clove/coriander spiciness, a hint of banana and a bit of alcohol. Quite sweet with a bit of citrus, doughy malt, herbal bitterness and spice towards the end. Alcohol is evident in the finish, fairly warm. Full, thick body, but not sticky. I quite enjoyed this beer - it has plenty of character. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"An interesting interpretation of the style. Rerate: Extremely bubbly mouthfeel with loads of fruit flavors. This sample is a bit oxidized, but still very tasty."
"Hmmm....drinkability - how do rate it on a high gravity beer? Pretty easy drinking, but you know the alcohol is there. Please don't try to compare to a pils for drinkability."
"D- For a sparkling ale this has the smooth light qualities but there were just a few off notes that didn't really blend with the flavor and aromas. Very drinkable especially for none BA friends."
"Mouthfeeel is dry, mildly tropical w/ apricot standing out among the mix."
"Very initial foamy, aroma of strong yeast and alcohol. Blondish yellow and whitish head. Easy full mouthfeel without heaviness-could be quickly drunk. Cirtus, and fruit sweet. Very little tartness, and of the cheery type. A real American version of a Belgian, very fresh with no skunkiness or mouldy yeast.I don't think I've met a triple I don't like, and this is no exception."
"The best part of this brew is the color. A magnificent, glowing orange, copper color. Very bright, very hazy, with a slim half inch, white fluffy head. A good amount of delicate lacing. Smells of breads, yeasts and hints of bananas. Taste mimics the smell. Very subdued flavors of breads, citrus and them some bananas. Decent mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation, and finishes clean. No bitterness whatsoever. Drinkability is good, alcohol is not a factor, even though it does have a abv of 8.2%. Worth a try, if you can buy a single bottle."
"On tap at Billy's Lounge...The beer arrived looking like a golden straw coloured brew. It sported a little head of white and left some sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose was heavy on candi sugar sweet scents and Belgian yeast qualities. The taste was quite sweet and candi laden. It almost felt gritty. Very tasty. This had just a bit of estery banana like flavours, but it was mainly just sugary sweet and a bit spicy. It did have a pointy white grape aspect to it though, which lent a sort of sharp tartness. The mouthfeel felt somewhat syrupy. Medium in body if I must say so. Drinkability was good. This was just missing something that I cannot put my finger on. Still damn good."
"Pours a golden orange with a tall snow-white head that lasts and lasts and good lacing. Smell is strong yeast, green olive, and clove. Taste is sweet candi sugar, caramel malt, Belgian spice, citrus, and a little alcoholic kick. Mouthfeel is slick and a little thin. Overall a pretty good ""Belgian-y"" beer. Not sure how authentic it is, but who cares, it's tasty enough."
"I like it, I'd say that there are a few aspects that could smoothed out and the flavor could use a little something extra, but I like it. Hard to judge precisely because I think of Belgians and that's tough competition. Haven't tried anything like it from other American craft brewers. Abv quite warming."
"The unbalanced alcohol makes this beer not real drinkable."
"This is an interesting selection from Bells and unique in its own way for a Tripel. It pours a nice light orange color. Pretty hazy with a fairly large, fluffy and lingering white head. Fair lacing as well. Smells of yeast and fruit--mostly orange and citrus. I'm very impressed by the full, sweet and balanced aroma here. The taste is somewhat puzzling. This beer is a lot more bitter than usual with the style. And this bitterness does not come across in a pleasant way. Although the yeast and fruit notes are nice, there is an overall lack of complexity. In the mouth Bell's Sparkling Ale is sharp and again a bit bitter. Carbonation is a bit above normal. Overall, I would say this is a pretty good beer. Not your run of the mill tripel, but then again no where near as good as the best of the style. A nice sippable beer, though not particularly smooth for a Belgian-type."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Sparkling Ale has a hazy yellowish brown color with lots of floating chunks. The beer is topped with an inch of dense foam. Bitter orange peel aroma along with strange yeast smells. This beer smells disconcertingly similar to the beers in the Wheat series. The flavor is very bitter, which is odd for the style. Bready malt. Some hop flavors, but they are in the background. The finish is yeasty and weird. A decent stab at a tripel, but there are some extra off flavors that nearly ruin the beer for me."
"Another good beer from Bells Brewing. Not the best example of the style but a good beer overall. Keep up the good work Bells!!!"
"An imensely rich beer that is easy to under-estimate. A beauty to the sight: Almost bubbly carbonation and fluffy white foamstand. Very bready, doughy, yeasty, and fruity to the nose. Flavors are much like sugar-cookie dough with lots of citrus (lemon) flavors. Reminescent of a chardonay or champaign in its flavors, textures, and sweetness. Active and vibrant against the toung with a mildly fizzy texture. Finishes warm and sweet with a bit of a fusal hotness. Aftertaste is bite-ey and a bit harsh, but fair for a belgian-like beer. Good stuff."
"This beer pours a pale, yet bold, orange color. The head is small and white, but recedes ever so quickly. The aroma is amazing and strong. It reminds me a lot of La Fin Du Monde. Oranges, yeast, dark fruits, more oranges, and more yeast. The sip is of oranges, with a dry yeasty finish. The aftertaste is a nice warming of the throat by the alcohol in this brew. The taste isn't bad, but there doesn't seem to be much complexity to it yet. I think some aging would mellow out the orange flavors in the sip, and allow other things to come out more. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, and nicely carbonated. Overall, this is a decent tripel, and a nice change of pace from Bell's."
"A handsome exemplar of the Tripel: just what I've come to expect from Bell's. Be sure to try this if you come across it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle. Looked about right for a tripel, clear golden color with a Belgian yeast aroma. Taste and smell were better than I expected, based on varied experience with Bell's other beers. The main drawback for me is the name on the bottle (""Sparkling Ale""). It sounds like a spritzer or something, kind of embarassing to buy. Anyway the taste was good so if I can find in my area, I'll pick it up again."
"The drinkability seems to get a little rough after a few sips. Maybe its the high abv or maybe the slick-feeling style. Definitly a sipper. Another quality offering from Bell's."
"Cool beer, and a fun one to drink. One of the few beers I've had that overwhelms its (relatively) pedestrian taste with its accoutrements. The, uh, Bell's and whistles work nicely for the Sparkling Ale."
"thanks dirtylou for bringing me this bottle"
"I had been sitting on this one for a while, and I have a feeling Riley's had been sitting on it for a while beforehand. Luckily, it held up pretty strong."
"To be sipped and enjoyed and never forgotten. A joy to experience."
"The name is somewhat misleading--this tripel style is not very sparkling at all. However, it is crisp and refreshing, citrusy and smooth. The aroma is actually very muted, not alot going on there. Easy drinking, which is dangerous due to the over 8% ABV. The yeasty flecks that are prominent throughout are a surprise--they kind of freaked my wife out! All in all, a very good beer, though a little on the pricy side to buy very often."
"This beer poured with a big, white head that slowly dissipated away. The nose was spicy, redolent with pepper. Warming, the nose became yeasty and musty. The color was a sort of orangish-yellow, with flecks of yeast swimming throughout. The mouthfeel was almost creamy with a taste of yeasty spiciness on the palate. The finish was both citrusy and chocolaty, like one of those milk chocolate oranges. I enjoyed it, but the high ABV makes me hesitant to mark drinkability as good."
"Thanks to TastyTaste for this Tasty Taste Treat!"
"The taste is good. Has a bit of a grainy sweetness from the malts. The alcohol is quite noticable, as is the spicy hop in the finish. It is a good tripel, but far from the best I've tried."
"give it a whirl, but a true belgian is much better."
"A solid brew all around. Poured out to a nearly clear golden color with good carbonation and touches of lace. Odors of yeast and herbs were noticed, as were a sweet alcohol scent. Taste was good, exciting the tastebuds with flavors of stronger citrus fruits and a crispness that reminded me of a strong hefewizen. Finished rather crisp, with a slightly sour aftertaste. Bell's has a good brew here. Recommended."
"Pours a slightly peachy yellow color with a small head over top. The nose is nice, with some nice orangey citrus character with some banana creamyness and some spiceyness hiding behind. Smells nice. The flavor is not bad either. A nice dose of banana and spices with a slight alcohol spiceyness in the back. I like it. The feel is a little thin, at moderate, with a creamy texture. For an 8%+ brew, this is a keeper. I enjoy it."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, light and slightly creamy. Good carbonation allows this one to go down super smooth. Overall, this is a refreshing tripel with a more laid back flavor profile than most. Worth a try..but if I want a tripel I will probably look elsewhere."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color, with minimal white head. There are some floaties present in the glass. Interesting aroma of fruits (lots of banana), some bread, and alcohol. Crisp taste is bursting with fruit and sweet citrous. Lots of yeasty, bready characteristics along with creamy malt form a doughy backbone for the sweetness. Finish is a great blend of sweet fruit, and slightly bitter yet definitely dry hops. A little alcoholic burn is present in the finish as well. Creamy mouthfeel is complimented by the sweetness, yet put off by lots of carbonation and the slight sharpness of the citrous. A good American rendition of the tripel style, with a relatively safe 8.2% abv."
"Dark golden color topped by a minimal white head. Nice sweet aroma with a touch of spiciness. Very enticing. The flavor is great, more grand cru/saison type flavors than many of the classic tripels. Tastes like coriander, bitter orange, and nice malt sweetness. Maybe a touch of candi sugar as well. Alcohol is there, but not in the spotlight. Mouthfeel is solid yet light, as most good tripels should be lighter in body. Drinkability is debatable. The higher ABV and the prominent flavors would likely fatigue the palate quickly, but it is a beer you could look forward to as an occasional or even regular treat. All in all, another well craft beer from Larry and the gang at Kalamazoo."
"Awesome beer. If I want a Belgian, I want a Belgian pale and man, this hits the spot. Another thanks to Feloniousmonk for this one!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a thin white head and nice lacing. Aroma is wonderful: banana, berries, cloves, and oranges. Flavor is dominated by spice (mostly clove) and is very sweet with candi sugar. Some ripe fruits come through in the middle and the sugar aftertaste lingers. Full-bodied, light to moderate carbonation and warming. A very good ale. Thanks to feloniousmonk."
"This is nice. Good complexity in both aroma and taste, but especially the latter."
"Not as impressive as some of the other offerings from Bell's, but a very drinkable beer despite the relativly high abv."
"Uncle Hamish says: ""Wine's fer girls and the blasted Italians lads, move on."""
"The bottle implies that this could be a champagne substitute. While I'm not sure about that, it's certainly worthy of toasting. Not one of the Bell's beers that gets a lot of notice out this way, but one worth sampling."
"This brew is a slightly hazy, golden colored brew, with some suspended yeast bits. Nice foam off-white head. The scent is lemony, with light fruits and malt. Sweet matl front, with fruit and candy. Subtle bitter hop. A light spicyness. Full creamy mouth. Overall a pretty standard tripel"
"Heavy sediment visible through the brown glass bottle. Pours with a gigantic head, several inches at first. Heavy yeast sediment in the glass, with a foamy off-white head that lingers long. Smells of alcohol, with woody earthy flavors, yeasty with slight clove and other spice smells. Taste is also very earthy and woody, like it was barrel aged, very dry on the pallette, too. Body is very effervescent, much like champagne. Taste is very complex and delicious, a great belgian-style brew from the midwest."
"OK, BA has this labeled as a Tripel. Im not sure I would agree that this is the style. Thats probably why it doesnt score better than it did on the site. Bright gold color with a thick, creamy white head. A thick foamy lace drapes down the side of the glass with every sip. Bright fruity aroma. Almost a citrus grapefruit character. This carries over to the taste, along with almost a champagne astringency. Very bright, almost tart. The champagne character in the flavor becomes more evident later in the beer. It has a rich almost velvety mouth feel in front with the astringency on the back. Very drinkable. This would be a great warm weather beer. It would also be a good beer to use to convert a wine drinker."
"Almost one-dimensional in it's sweetness, though I'd love to see how it develops."
"My first Triple, so I'm not too familiar with the style, but it looks very attractive and has some nice characteristics that make it a nice winter alternative to my regular stouts. I'll check it out again, as it has a limited availability, another nice offering from Kalamazoo Brewing!"
"Mouthfeel...nothing to say really. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand out either. There isn't a ton of carbonation, which I was expecting from a sparkling ale, and it isn't particularly ""full"" like a champagne or anything like that. Pretty dead on average, as was the drinkability."
"I am drinking the brew at room temp in a tulip/chalice. The brew pours a very nice bright orangish gold color that is slightly hazy with some yeast sediment. There are numerous rising bubble streams floating towards the surface. A bleached white fluffy head foams up 3 cm easily and releases a sweet fruity aroma. I get some floral hops mixing with orange citrusy scents and a bit of apricot and white grape. The first sip reveals very light body with fizzy carbonation. The flavor is mild up front and is light and fruity just like the nose. I find orange and apricot mixing with some banana yeast charabters and a bit of biscuitiness. The beer is smooth and lite, very easy to drink. Reminisicient of champagne, just like the bottle states."
"Many thanks to feloniousmonk for this beer! This one hit the spot really good."
"Easy to handle and well contructed. Bottle is soon diminished, leaving my glass with a bit more color than it started with."
"thanks go out to feloniousmonk for providing me a bottle of this fine bell's offering!"
"poured cloudy golden with a medium size head with a lot of floaties. aroma, citrus, malty.alcohol,yeasts , flavor sour grapefruit, yeast, as the description says tart alcolol burn, fruity. not to bad. bells does it again. I am glad that bells is so easy to get."
"Golden sunny day body. Head is limited to a thin film from the beginning. Very floral aroma, grassy with notes of honey, lemon, grapefruit. Youd almost think this is a well hopped pilsner and youd be right werent it for the very yeasty counterpart. Saazy taste, floral and orangey. Creamy lemonbite, slight mineral tones. Foamy mouthfeel with fitting effervescence. The comfortable texture and nice fruit/yeast development make it pretty good and theres certainly a good amount of balancing hops together with a slight tart presence, but dont expect anything spectacular. Thanks Jeff."
"I drank the yeasty sediment separately and liked the taste much better. It was spicier and less flowery. I'll try rolling the next one before opening but I'm sure it will adversely effect the mouthfeel and appearance."
"This seems like an odd duck tripel to me, not based on the Belgain-style malts that I usually associate with the style. But variety is the spice of life, I guess, and this one was an enjoyable brew. Experimentation is always welcome. Not always appreciated, but always welcome..."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Tripels aren't my favorite style, but I must admit that they're growing on me. I would put this one at the top of my list along with Great Lakes Anniversary Ale. I'd have to have them side by side to pick an absolute favorite, but both are excellent domestic versions. Bell's Sparkling Ale is a fine beer and I recommend it heartily to those who have even a passing interest in the style."
"Comments  Thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this beauty shop out my way."
"After browsing this beer several times I always passed it by based on the label. Sparkling ale? Only after reading the fine print did I see that it was a Belgian. Pours a lightly cloudy dark golden color with a medium thin off-white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is a nice concoction of spice, malt and a little sweet fruit. Medium-bodied with a strong wheat character and flavors of malt, citrus and spice. Some alcohol is evident at times too. The finish is rather short and leaves a lingering yeast taste. This is a pretty good beer but doesnt compete with the better Belgians out there, especially considering the price."
"Beautiful medium gold with a very thick bone white head. Very vigorous carbonation. Herbal notes dominate, with some good malt and (wheat?) tones. Lots of tropical esters; bananas and stone fruits. Mild hop herbiness subtle in the finish. Light mouthfeel, but fairly flavorful and slightly sweet. IMO, a good interpretation of a tripel style ale. Not a fave of mine, but worth a try."
"On a side note, I usually don't like the lighter Bell's offerings, but this is the lightest I have had and I like it. I feel the alcohol flush after just one (empty stomach?) There must be some non-linear relationship between color and flavor in Bell's beers. I must investigate further. . . ."
"Drinkability: Good, unique, hides the alcohol well"
"Poured a somewhat hazy golden color with a nice tight head that remained for the most part down the glass.Nice aroma-somewhat floral,fruity.Malty flavor-tart with a slight residual sweetness.Has the typical Belgian ""wang"" to it.Full mouthfeel-leaves you with a mild puckering.Decent beer-quite enjoyable."
"Thanks to at least 3 BAs who sent me this one (feloniousmonk, MJR, WVbeergeek); it was worth the wait as perhaps it improves with age."
"Ok, what a relief. I was trying to figure out just what the hell was going on with this one. I was expecting a lighter refreshing summer type ale, and what I got wasn't fitting into my expectations. My bottle was very fresh as the yeast poured in as a cloud instead of chunks. Very cloudy medium gold with a thick white head that sticks to the sides of the glass. Pineapple and banana and a good bit of spice in the arome. Lightly sweet malt flavor is a bit of a letdown after the aroma, but still tasty. The name is appropriate given the plentiful and constant streams of tiny bubbles."
"Served from a 12oz bottle. Poured into my glass a light golden color, somewhat hazy, and whitecapped with a fine thick white head that sticks around for quite some time. Aromas of yeast and bread rising, with a hint of spice and alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is absolutely delicious, complex, and very drinkable for a tripel, even an ""American"" tripel as Bell's calls it. Starts out sweet and bready-malty at first then roils into a complex blend of hop bitterness, tangly spice, and hints of orchard peach and lemon. Finish is nicely dry and just a bit sour, with a nice hint of warmth. Very drinkable stuff, wish I had more than this one bottle...."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with noticeable flakes of sediment floating throughout the beer. Nose is quite sweet with aromas of candied sugar, fruity yeasts, and a bit of Belgian spice. Light to medium in body with a very fine carbonation that is a bit zesty and spritzy in nature. As with the aroma, the taste starts off sweet with flavors of cane sugar and apricots followed by some citrus fruit and sweet malt. Next comes a good deal of spiciness with notes of coriander, clove, white pepper, and some vanilla extract towards the end. To me, this was sort of like Duvel with a good dose of extra sugar addedpretty darn tasty. Thanks to faernt for the sample!"
"Foggy orange in color with a brief, white dome of creamy suds. The aromas are an enticing blend of toast, butter and orange marmalade. On the palate it is pleasantly bitter - from beginning to end - and drenched with flavors of peach skins, root vegetables, orange peel, and noble tannins. Cutting edge, bitterly hopped Belgian-style Triple and one of the best Bell's beers of any style."
"While this one was interesting, I don't think I could drink too many of them. This was a little bit sweeter than I like a tripel as well. Still a solid offering from a solid brewerey."
" Drinkability? Good for a tripel. I'd have another. I just may as the bottom of this one is pretty clumped up with junk and I think my other one won't last. Very good overall. I definitely reccomend it."
"I came to this beer after an Expedition Stout and its the difference between night and day (well almost - their nearly as strong!) This poured a pale, hazy dull gold color and was topped off with a white cream like head of foam. Nice light and spicy aroma of grainy fruits. Good blend of dry spiciness and sweet malts. Yeasty, with an assertive sour tang in the finish. I love the spiciness in this beer  it blends together perfectly with the dryness that the alcohol creates. Lemony and peppery. This is a refreshing Trippel. Strong and sweet, sour, citric and dry  all at once. Ive had better examples, but this is very nice overall."
"orange tinted hazy gold in color. big frothy white head. aggresive carbonation machine-guns CO2 to the top. spicy clove and clean biscuty aroma. medium bodied, lively and crisp on the tounge. loads of pale malt flavors with an earthy biscuity undertow. big hit of belgian spiciness (corriander? orange peel?) in the middle followed by an assertive saaz type hop bite. then things get strange. there is a subtle but lingering bitterness that is not really pleasant as you finish your sip. seems weird. i've never tasted this before. sort of brings the beer down a notch. still enjoyable once you get past it. could pass for duvel if things didn't get funky at the end. regardless, a solid american tripel."
"Thanks Feloniousmonk!"
"This is honestly amongst the best tripels I've ever had. A nice floral sweetness with only a slight yeasty character makes this a great beer, and one I'll hope to have again in the future."
"Complex but a bit too much hoppy bitterness for the style, in my opinion, and this Styrian-sort of wallop further underscores the bready and yeasty tones a bit too much in the lingering finish."
"Wow, Thanks to BigHuge for this Tripel-tastic Beer  Recommended."
"Appearance: Mesmorizing glowing golden orange amber hue with a fluffy growing massive white head leaves thick patches of lacing so good evenly dispersed. Aroma: Herbal clove combo with the funky yeast characteristic that every Bell's brew has, a warming sweetness but no acohol ridden nose. Taste: Excellent ties everything together so well, seems farmhouse funkyness of peppery spices and then the bread yeast characteristics, with an herbal clove and underlying fruit sensation this is good stuff. Mouthfeel: Fluffy very right on the mark for carbonation spritzy but still holds together some great texture awesome. Drinkability: Dangerous I could chill with these all day but a bigger beer means beware, so good clean well made triple awesome one of the better American brewed versions."
"A quite outstanding brew. Was not expecting a belgian style ale, but was happily surprised to find one in the bottle. The aroma of candi sugar and tropical fruit was a wonder to behold. The flavor was nicely balanced between sweet chewy malt and acidic grapefruit flavors. An obscenely well crafted brew and a pure joy to drink. Could easily make this a session beer if it weren't for the high alcohol as it is incredibly easy to drink."
"I bought this brew for New Years not really knowing it was a abbey tripel or what to expect. As soon as I opened it, bubbles formed in the bottle neck. On a careful pour I got an inch of liquid brew and one massive head. I let it sit as the hazy amber gold settled back to liquid from the bottom up. The head was white fluffy, lace sticks around all glass long. The aroma of flower, hop, and citrus. The taste was lemon-lime citrus, hop, slight malt backed by a soft (but noticed) hint of alcohol. The mouth is left tart. I should of bought more for the cellar. I agree, the sweetness of this 2003 had not developed yet. But a good brew of bubbly to be had, Happy New Year!"
"Like this beer a lot, but frown a drinking too many, given the high alcohol content."
"Thanks CRJMellor!"
"The beer pours a muzzy light yellow-orange color with a pythonic sized head that is brilliant white in color with the texture creamy and the lace a heavy blanket to keep the glass covered. Hint of lemon-lime, crisp and fresh to the senses, sweet at the back with the start malt laden and mild in its sweetness, the top moderate in its feel. Finish is rigorous in its acidity and the hop titillating in their spiciness, quite dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, a quite tasty brew."
"This beer makes reserving examples of annual bottlings worthwhile."
"I was a bit let down by this beer. The aroma was very nice - quite spicy with orange, coriander and clove - along the lines of a spiced-up witbier. Not a lot the aroma translated into the flavor. Up front a quick hit of some yeast fruit, and then the flavor washed out. The middle was rather flavorless, and the finish was a nondescript bitterness. The label noted that it was an ""American tripel"" - I guess this is like the ""American wheat"" interpretations - bland and without soul."
"I don't know what I was expecting when I picked this beer up, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Pours an orange color with a large head and leaves a little lacing on the glass - lots of floaty stuff. The aroma is mostly citrus and yeast - not too strong. The flavor is big. Be prepared. The citrus and the yeast pack a strong punch when you taste it. There are also some spices in the flavor. The alcohol is very evident in the taste, but blends pretty well. The drinkability isn't as high as I would like, but it's a pretty decent beer once you get used to it. Very unique."
"Hazy light golden yellow color, medium white head bubbly head appears, fades somewhat quickly to a thickly foamed ring around the edge and a firm skim on top. Good sticky lacing of every kind, sheets, spots, and strings. Complexing aroma of spice and crispness, solid waft of clove, underlaying tones of minerals/medicinal yeast, and citrus peels. Wheat malts standout with light hops in parts of the back, and alcoholic warmth smolders through. Taste is crispy and malty with a quick citrusy start, sweet and candyish, subdued clove and spicy medicinal yeast bring forward a popping mouthfeel of zip but doesn't last, jumping quickly to the finish with a dry and light peppery end. Feel is of a solid medium body and a nice easy carbonation which makes for smooth drinking. Smoothes out even more as it warms. A fine Triple style, but surprisingly mild for Bell's."
"Have also had it on draft before and it was even better."
"A beautiful pour here. Orangish gold and cloudy in appearance. Large head that was sticky and foamy. Intense amounts of bubbles rising to the top with a good amount of yeast floating around. I could look at this all day long. I couldn't get too much from the nose of this beer, kind of champagne in smell. But the taste hit you like a bag of bricks! A sweet precense hit my tongue first followed immediately by a citrusy and tarty fruit taste. Hoppiness is at the end but not really that noticeable. Strong flavors of yeast and peppery spices finish up this complex and well made brew from Kalamazoo. I must get this one again."
"A really lovely brew from the folks at Bell's."
"This beer could be called ""Son of"" Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. It has a syrupy, sticky mouthfeel and a bubbly carbonated character. The alcohol is apparent, but the overall flavor of the beer is strong enough not to let the alcohol dominate. Not what I would call a session beer, because it is heavy in flavor and alcohol content, but it is a good beer to have when you are in the mood for just one."
"highly carbonated large yeast chunks very pale orange off-white head lasts a minute or so smells like a creamsicle with big yeast esters and phenolics tastes smooth and well balanced alcohol makes its presence known finishes with a long lingering spiciness reminds me a bit of heavyweight lunacy except this has the phenolics in more control very creamy texture by the end of the beer it was as much from white labs as it was from bells"
"It pours a crisp golden yellow with a lot of suspended sediment making it sort of hazy. Tiny bubbles, Champagne-like. It has a yeasty wheat-like aroma. You cant really smell the alcohol, but its there, believe me. Sweet and smooth. Nice job again from the people at Bells."
"Hazy gold color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and yeasty. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Very typical of a Belgian ale, Fruity and sweet, yeasty and spicy. Flavors are peachy, apricots and a touch of vanilla. Sparkling is a good description. This is a VERY dangerous beer, as there is NO hint of its 10.5% alcohol content. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet"
"Sticky sweetness left on my lips."
"592"
"I like this beer but there are higher rated tripels."
"Cloudy amber with a thick, nearly white head capping it. This beer looks the part, and laces very well. Aroma was a bit weak, and really suggested a bit more Hop than I expected. The taste was a real dissapointment for me. I felt that the hops overpowered all the other flavors I love in a Belgian. The finish was a bit bitter, and the mouthfeel medium bodied. The ABV is very well hidden, and if it tasted better it would quickly put you on your ass before you had any idea what was coming. Not a bad beer, but not what I like in a Trippel"
"I really didn't know what to expect as I poured this ale into my glass. It was a mere coincidence that it resembled the liquid that previously rested in the very same glass, Allagash White. Appearance was amazingly similar, cloudy honey colored with a towering white fluffy head yielding great retention. Aroma was quite accurate to a good Belgien Wit. Sweet and an almost yeasty wheat aroma and slightly sour. Body is very smooth and full with a slight crispness but not as sparkling as I expected. Alcohol of 10% is disguised beautifully. This is a fantastic ale and as good as most Belgiens I've had."
"This brew pours a very envigorated head of fine to medium sized off white bubbles and a carbonated yeasty cloudy golden colored body with a lot of yeast floating in it. Its aroma is very mild and almost non-existant. It had very little lacing. THis brew is very belgian like with a flavor of yeast, bread, flowertry and citrousy. Its mouthfeel is slightly fizzy. Iverall, it is a very nice brew. An American-Belgian ale for indeed."
"When this brew was poured it had a white creamy head that consisted of fine-small bubbles. The body was golden in color and there was a lot of carbonation present. I wasn't sure what name to give the aroma as it was hard to figure out in my opinion. The lacing was very good on the sides of my glass. There was also some yeast observed with this brew. The first taste of this brew seemed to leave a tingling sensation in the back of my throat. This was not a bad drink in my opinion."
"-F"
"Originally sampled on 2 November 2002. Cloudy golden belgian-style ale. Incredibly drinkable considering the 10.25ABV. Nice aroma of apricots. Great flavor. The alcohol is very well hidden. This was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting a nice, simple beer and wound up w/ a top notch belgian"
"This beer is very drinkable, lest you must drive your drunken ass home. I would need to space them out, though. Give my palate a break and whatnot."
"Deep golden hue with a light murk. Thick, virtually solid, stiff porcelain white head retains well and leaves roughly textured lace. Soft, but bright, juicy acidic fruit akin to ripe kiwi and starfruit are dominant aromawise. Alcohol provides a heaty undertone, and subdued clove phenol adds a sweetly herbal tinge. Clean & well rounded in aroma. Citrus laced sweetness upfront in flavor is quickly supplemented by a mellow clove and lingering bready malt combination. Breadiness morphs into a oddly thick, pseudosweet, jackfruit and starch melange akin to breadfruit mid palate. Ethanol and fusels are well integrated, and provide a subtle heat, lending a heated tropical compote impression late. Moderate bodied, with a firm, yet smoothly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes mostly clean, with a snap of hop bitterness and peppery alcohol yielding to lingering, mellow sweetness. A flavorful, highly drinkable tripel. Not as complex in yeast derived flavor contributions as others, and certainly more dextrinous. Perhaps fermented too low and a touch under attenuated as well. Nevertheless a dangerously balanced brew. Very tasty. Kudos to Feloniousmonk for delivering the bottle of another fine Bells."
"Pours to a golden/straw color with a creamy off-white head. Leaves good lacing. The aroma reminds me of a Belgian. It has a soft medicinal aroma, with sweet candi sugar. A tad bit of clove and hay-like aromas are present. It is a very unique aroma. The flavor is medicinal, and sweet with an alcohol flavor. It is a medium-full bodied brew with a dry finish. It has a masked alcoholic kick that will definitely sneak up on you. A tasty brew."
"Thanks feloniousmonk!"
"This beer pours a clear golden hue with a white head. An excellent ale, Malty, Yeasty, Spicy, and warming. This is a really good representation of a triple, yet from Michigan. A very enjoyable beer. It's cool to see brewers take on complex styles like this."
"Bell’s Sparkling Ale: What a tremendous head, three inches of solid white foam that lasts and lasts. It will take several minutes before the head dissipates and I can try my first sip. A deep golden yellow. The beer is very hazy, with suspended particulates. The aroma is very nice and appealing: oranges and just a touch of parsley. The initial sip shows off the high carbonation levels of this beer. The taste is very fruity, with oranges and a hint of bananas. There is a hint of sourness toward the end, that is not only not unpleasant, but really helps to balance out the sweetness of the fruits. Boy, for a beer with something north of 10 percent alcohol, it is not that noticeable, except for a little warmth deep in the throat. Very nice."
"Initially, I could have been fooled that I was drinking a Duvel. The appearance, with that lemon-meringue head, that somewhat sour taste, etc. But, as you go on, you notice the difference. There is something in the aftertaste that doesn't sit as well. Whereas, with a Duvel, I crave another, I don't think I'd drink more than one. It doesn't seem to hit at 10.25%, either. I won't go into any more detail, but this is similar to several great Belgian beers, and it doesn't miss by too much. I'm sure if any of the homebrewers on the site tried to make a ""Duvel"" and came up with this, they'd be thrilled. I'm sampling several Bell's beers (thanks, Monk!) and so far, I'm impressed."
"I am floored. Reminding me of a cross between La Fin Du Monde, Celis Grand Cru, and Great Lakes Anniversary Ale, this is one of the most exceptional brews I've ever had, comparable to the world's best Grand Cru's. If you love Unibroue's 10 or 11, this is a must-try! This beer is pure punch-drunk love. I'm giggling, and a shit-eating smile erupts across my face. I'm in love."
"It's a little bit orange and pale yellow with some cloudiness and sediment floating. A gargantuan fluffy head forms and stays throughout. The aroma is very citrusy, mostly lemons and grapefruit. Flavors consist of citrus strongly as well, some spiciness, and some warming alcohol in the finish. It's rather smooth for such a high ABV. I'm pretty happy with this beer. It's most definitely worth a try. Anything with the name Bell's has impressed me thus far."
"This beer surprised me. It poured out to a bright color, almost orange in the glass. The aroma was that of light hops. The taste though is where this shines through. Somewhat sweeter than I was expecting from a Bell's beer. Hops are here, but aren't an overwhelming presence and balance quite nicely with the malt. The 10.25% ABV is very well hidden and isn't noticeable."
"In the middle, more fruitiness comes through, peach, apricot, but sugar is still strong . Light in body and texture, but full of flavor, and bursting with playful hops. ""Sparkling"" is the appropriate name for this ale, and Bell's has crafted the best Duvel imitation I've ever tasted, from Belgium, the U.S., or anywhere else in the Universe."
"In the glass it looks like a lemon meringue pie. Smells like one too. Huge frothy bright white head. Hazy, yellow effervescent liquid. Very mild flavor. Tart and slightly sour and very lemon-like. Most refreshing and much more suitable for a hot summer day. Enjoyable none-the-less on this cold January evening. I'll remember this brew come August. I'm impressed with this brewery's range, I've always thought of them as Stout makers."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, with a thin but persistent white head that leaves a nice lace. A nice musty aroma of orange peel, coriander, and malt.. somewhat sweet and doughy. The aroma is somewhat reminiscent of Duvel. Flavor is musty as well... with yeast, toasted malt, coriander, and slightly sweet citrus notes. Very good full body, and a smooth mouthfeel. This is a very good Belgian pale... and is quite unique. Highly drinkable, and deceptively strong. I couldn't believe that it's actually 10.25% ABV! A definate must try if you like Belgian beers!"
"This ale appears to be a true Belgian at first: deep golden color with a well retaining head and excellent lacing qualities. The nose, however, keeps it from being so. Aroma is of yeast, apple and dried peas. Not too attractive. Taste is similar, with that pea note making itself known more than any spices, hops, yeast, whatever. Mouthfeel is pretty good, but not as prickly as I prefer from a Belgian pale strong ale. Drinkability is fairly strong for a beer of its size, but I'm glad I only bought one bottle. This is one of Bell's weaker efforts, but I applaud the effort overall. For a brewery that specializes in stouts and the like, this isn't too bad for what it's worth."
"Confused, unique, and interesting...I'll see how my other bottle of this responds to a year or two in the cellar..."
"Hazy glowing golden-orange color, huge off white, foamy head. Fruity citrusy sweet aroma, sweet Champagne-wine like fruity flavor, full body, loaded carbonation like seltzer or champagne, some alcohol in the finish, very drinkable."
"Hazy bright peach color with lots of chunks and a 1/4 inch head that laces in rings. Some yeastiness and definite bread in the aroma, with a little sour apple. Viscous mouthfeel, prickly sense of coriander and thistle flowers, candied lemon, and a musty sense of canvas. Finishes with impressive hops and a big and bitter alcohol bite. Something about this was unsettling in my mouth and stomach, some sense of a bitter anisey medicine and thick flavor warbling that's not my style. The yeasty smells are distinctly Bell's and seem more appropriate in their Stouts. Oh well, you can't love 'em all..."
"Okay, this beer is Bell's attempt at a Belgian in the sea of it's November Stouts. This beer poured a cloudy golden color with sediment/particles present. It formed a nice white bubbly head that subsided leaving circular lace. An faint aroma of malt and spice. A flavor of malt, hops and grain with some spice element. The finish reminded me a touch of an IPA."
"Pale golden orange, mildly hazy, small lacy head.  Sweet & sour spicy aroma, fruity and yeasty.  Taste starts sweet but then the confusion begins.  A sourness rolls past the tastebuds.  Is it an attempt at a lambic?  Nah.  Coriander next.  A strong Wit?  Stupid idea.  Dries a littte but stays sweet, finishes astringently bitter.  I like this beer but have no idea what I'm drinking."
"Pours a cloudy, golden-orange body topped by a full frothy white head that eventually receeds to an 1/8"" creamy surface covering. The thin head holds exceptionally well (buoyed by carbonation) and leaves some very nice lace. The aroma is fruity, yeasty, and sweet with cookie dough. The body is light/medium with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts lightly tangy and fruity (citrus), then becomes quite creamy in the mouth as it warms & CO2 breaks out of solution enhancing the sweet bready malt. Alcohol, peppery notes and a firm bitterness burst forth... then gently receed with a lingering sweet & fruity (cherries, berries, orange) maltiness in an exceptionally long finish. Quite impressive. Clearly a little bit on the wild side, but also unique. Clearly not a pale ale - definitely a tripel."
"Cheers to Deuce for the sample!"
"Looks great and smells very nice...but tastewise this it has a strong sour/ grain alcohol presence.  I guess at 10% you might get that but I would never buy this one again.  Really a sour finish...I'm not a big Belgian fan to start with and this one really doesn't sit right for my personal preferences."
"Bell's does much better than this."
"No longer my favorite beer this is still one of the best of style in my book, a very good tripel.Its a bit candy sweet and fruity but it goes down oh so smooth with just enough drying herbal hop profile in the finish.Its big time drinkable and a great beer."
"Pours a white frothy head.  Cloudy, pale appearance.  Fresh hop aroma.  Maybe candi sugar aroma?  The aroma reminds me a bit of some of the better Belgian beers that I've had (like De Dolle Stille Nacht).  Very slight alcohol taste.  Not as much as you'd expect from a 10+ % beer.  There is a sour taste present similar to Belgian Beers also.  There's a hoppy taste, but this beer is not bitter like an IPA.  Pretty easy drinking for 10+ % alcohol.  Kalamazoo website describes this beer as a tripple pale ale."
