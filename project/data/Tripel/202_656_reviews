"3/23/15 (Draft - Monk's Pub Chicago) - Light golden pour, nice carbonation, poured with a full a rich head. Lemon, wheat and orange among the aromas noted. Taste was light and very smooth. Lemon and somewhat sweet fruit taste prevalent.  Very smooth beer, mild carbonation and a nice ABV which is noticeable upon finishing this very good offering."
"I find this beer too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
""
"Had on tap. Has a spicy fruity nose with light malt. It pours hazy gold with a one finger thick foam cap. The palate is big and fruity with apricot over bread finishing with a bitter accent. It is creamy with an average body and average carbonation."
""
""

"330ml bottle. 19/09/16. Straw coloured. Towering, frothy white head, good retention with some lacing. Effervescent. Aroma of yeast, cloves, lemon, wheat and perfume. Slightly medicinal. Light sweetness and similar bitterness. Light to medium bodied, effervescent and creamy. Pleasant alcohol warmth. An interesting drop in terms of aroma and taste but the mouthfeel of this one is superb and the more I drink, the more I enjoy it. 8."

"poured from 750ml bottle into orval goblet. Golden and clear, peppery smell. Taste is spicey and mild to moderate esters. Moderate carbonation, feel is smooth and easily drinkable."

"On tap at Toone in Brussels"
""
""
"Feel: A little thick and creamy, sort of weird with so much carbonation but definitely not unpleasant."

"Amazing. The flaked oat mash addition smooths the palate of this beer well. It's missing some of the spice and zing of a traditional Triple."

"This is a bit sweeter than most triples I have had, but not overly so.  It is very drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden, and has a nice mix of flavors. Definitely a top notch example of the style, well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M:  high carbonation, surprisingly light though not at all watery, hides alcohol very well, crisp."
""
""
""
""
""

"All in all an excellent beer. Definitely will buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad,but not so well"

"Great belgian and enjoyed every sip of this beauty"
""

"Pours a cloudy gold with an impressively huge billowing white head that recedes but remains as a half inch cap.  Carbonation very apparent.  Aroma of lemons and coriander.  Prickly and spicy mouth which is suprisingly light.  Peppery taste with a fruity (apple, pear, banana) middle.  Much lighter in body than expected for 8.4% ABV.  Could session a few of these but not sure what the result would be.  Was quite good with a dinner of knockwurst, cabbage, onions, apples, red pepper over Bavarian spaetzle."
"Way too carbonated for me"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As tripels go, this one is pretty damned good - manages to pack in 'typical' Belgian witbier flavours (orange peel, coriander etc.) with a good alcohol kick without tasting at all boozy. If you're curious with regard to tripel beers, this is an excellent starting point as well as an excellent beer all round. Heartily recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Side note: Poured from bottle at McNellie's Oklahoma City, Ok. I have bought before, am buying now, and will buy again! My wife says the perfect combination of alcohol and flavor on a tripel..."
""
"Overall, an excellent Triple that hits every mark for the style. This is up there with the best as I can't really find any flaws here."
""
""
""
"This one was a really nice Belgian ale from the start, much as I've come to expect from beers hailing from the country. Tripel Karmeliet was quite a spicy offering with a very lively and well-carbonated feel to it that proved highly enjoyable and every drinkable. Whilst I wouldn't rank it as one of my favourites in the style it was definitely one worth trying and proved to be a fairly good example of the style."

"I see that a lot of people really like this brew.  I really wanted to like it.  I... wanted to, but alas...  I guess I just don't care much for tripels.  The color was very nice, golden sunlight with a beautiful creamy head.  As William Shatner would say, I can definitely get behind that.  But then I smelled and tasted it.  It's that damned aftershave meets mouthwash taste I can't stand.  So I might be a bit harsh here.  I do like Belgians. A lot.  But just not tripels.  However, as my ratings suggest, I tried really hard not to let my distaste for the style affect my overall judgment of the beer.  Others may love it.  I just don't."
"Very possibly the best Belgian Triple that I've ever had - only trouble is that it was on tap at a local bar and I can't find it at any area stores!"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 08:58. AROMA: complex aroma with notes of orange and coriander, mixed with spices and a sweet background. very faint hop notes. APPEARANCE: gold color and hazy. large white head with below average retention. poor lacing. TASTE: mix of flavours of spice, oranges and coriander. low bitterness leading into a sweet finish. low alcohol presence. PALATE: medium body with a slight creaminess from alcohol with no obvious warming sensation. high carbonation. OVERALL: a very interesting 8and delicious) variation of a belgian tripel."

"I drink on tap in the Karmeliet glass several times on the last months, 8,4% abv don't apears nor on aroma or flavors, but the floral, fruity and herbal in these beer is one of the great pleasure i found in a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a hazy yellow with a huge billowy head. Smell is spicy, a little bit of funky yeast, some floral notes. Taste is really fruity up front, with both citrus and peach notes. I get a little bit of coriander and another spice I can't quite get a handle on, but it's exactly what is right! Mouthfeel is luxurious, velvety smooth, with just a touch of prickly carbonation that makes it perfect. This is an awesome beer in all respects! I just love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-bodied, defined by yeast, fresh supporting carbonation, and perfect fitting spiciness of cloves, a little pepperiness with citrus peel. Still, this beer is surprisingly refreshing without loosing its decent complexity. Yeast becomes even fluffier, softer as the beer warms up, spices get a little sharper, creating an even more complex body. Spiciness varies between, sweet, sharp, bitter - in that order, leaving a warm feeling in the stomach. Aftertaste is still very smooth, toffeeish, sweet malts, and still spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guarantee there are not many Tripels this heavily spiced.  For those who want the spice/phenols toned down, this beer is not for you, but for me, this is world class stuff!"

"This is a pricey brew for a reason. I was surprised. Very very good tripel. 3 grain tripel with notes of frui. Perfect carbonation level, and thick head. Smells fruity. Everyone should have this beer.  Definitely drink this from a challace."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy gold with two fingers of soapy white head, settles in a minute with sparse blobs of lace behind. Smell: straw and dough and honey in the back with lots of fruit and notes of booze and the floral. Unripe peach, white grape, coriander. Taste: ripe pear, peach candy, notes of unripe banana, apple, clove. Spicy and herbal with a little pepper in the finish. Medium-full bodied from the prickly into fluffy feel. Finishes drying but sticky with peach skin. Very good."

"Overall: I never thought I'd find a tripel that appealed to me but this is top-tier. It lacks the alcohol heat that ruins many other tripels for me. Drinks great on a summer evening."

""
""
"Like drinking tart cherry juice spiced with clove and cinnamon; just the right amount of sweetness that lent a near-perfect drinkability, a fantastic follow-up to my Delirium Tremens. In fact, I enjoyed it even more. Loved this beer and I´ve made it my go-to!!"
""
"Overall: not overly complex; the warming alcohol and spice are what stick out; not in my top few for the style, but still very good"
""

"11.2 oz bottle poured in a chalice glass.  Yellow, with a modest head of foam.  Amazing citrus and fruit notes.  Reminds me of a fine Hefeweizen.  Banana, orange, and wheat.  Smells like a floral bouquet.  It's hard to believe this has 8.4% ABV.  It's as smooth as a soft drink.  The perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness.  I'm going to run, not walk, to my local beer distributor to buy more."

"Very nice - a classic tripel. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour have a superbly balanced character that is dominated by Belgian yeast esters and hints of grain. The booze is nicely integrated. Good body. A tasty brew that goes down a treat - add this one to your must-try list."
""
""
"Had on tap. It's a fantastic beer! Slightly sweet. Super smooth. Esters align with the great balance of the beer, equal amounts of banana, spice, belgian yeast. Soft, pleasnt bitterness inviting me to sip on-it was gone before I knew it. A nice balance of citrus, light caramel, balanced out by the soft, earthy hoppy bitterness. Thinner, but rounded, silky mouthfeel/body. Alcohol is perfectly covered, seems non existent. One of my new favorites. I am looking for clone recipe to replicate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is rich, at first warming and full of alcohol, lemony, zesty, semisweet. Raw grains on palate. I'm very disappointed, the beer looks like overfermented witbier, lacking tripel charming significantly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And you can find it at Costco, too, at least in Michigan. Never would have thought, but never more appreciative."

"One of my favorite Belgian beers of the over 1000 varieties brewed in Belgium. The complexity, carbonation, and overall feel of this beer is truly remarkable. Very few (if any) beers brewed anywhere in the world compare to Tripel Karmeliet.  Any beer aficionado must try Tripel Karmeliet at least once in their life to expand the limits of their ""beer horizons"".  This is the Standard for all other Belgian-type ales to strive towards. High alcohol content makes this a beer to savor - not suitable for pounding down on a hot summer day - drink a Tripel Karmeliet slowly and believe your taste buds when they tell you this is as close to a religious experience as any beer has ever come."

"Even in finish, its lovely bouquet holds confidently even as the ale's quickly drying, sweet straw bitterness and vinous acidity dries the beer with ease. There's still a candied and perfumy nature to the beer that doesn't overstep its boundaries. Though semi-dry in taste, the ale is effortless on the mouth and stomach; making it a fool-proof choice for any drinking occasion."

"The taste has a nice toasted biscuit character and Belgian sweetness to boast about. Some vague spice and pear play up the rear. Little to no hop character. Very enjoyable all told."

"Pours into a transparent light gold color with a nice head. Smells like a Hoegaarden. Orange peel, coriander, some lemon, some vanilla. High carbonation, light body. It tastes like an improved version of Hoegaarden with a fancier flavor. As it gets warmer it tastes more like a hard liquor. Similar to the Kwak. Half way, at room temperature you forget you are drinking a beer and you wonder if you are having a peach liquor."

"O - a very good tripel, easy to drink any time of the year. Definitely recommended and it's relatively easy to find."

"I hope I got a bad bottle. This is one of the worst Belgian Beers I have tasted. As a brewer, the obvious flaw is too much grains of paradise. Way too much black pepper."
""
""
""
""
"O: Less bitter than other tripels, but that could be put down to my changing palate which is growing accustomed to the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is hard to imagine a better Tripel, surprisingly decent value stacked up to some closer to home Tripel's. Some beers chase after style definitions, the rare ones define a style. This would be a case of the latter."

"I'm a person who is obsess with IPA's-DIPA-American Pale Ale's. But if I had to choose another style beer it would be the Tripel. And the Tripel Karmeliet set the bar for this style. This beer should be rated higher. Perfect Tripel Belgian Style with a wheat taste. You gotta love this beer."

"Wonderful creamy head and mouth. Just the right amount of spiciness and bitterness. Peppery and bready. Good carbonation. Beautiful hazy straw color with rich puffy white head. Not to sweet but not plain or bland either. Just the right balance of flavors. One of the best in its category. Superb."
""
"Delicious, bright, extremely well balanced, excellent mouthfeel, smooth. Extremely drinkable. Complex and crisp, an exceptional beer."

"Had this on draft at Federal Taphouse in Lancaster. Outstanding beer and one of the best, if not the best triples I have had. Shockingly tasty that I almost gulped down despite my desire to see if it would change as it warmed, maybe next time. I would love to find a bottle to see if it was as good. They have 100 drafts but go with this one. Wow"

"O: better than I imagined, and I imagined it would be good ... a fantastic mix of sweet and tart notes with nothing overcoming anything else ... there's citrus notes, there's sweet fruit, there's even that pinch of grassiness -- more the flavor of hops than bitterness. a fantastic brew, so good I plan on revisiting this one often this summer (it seems perfect for hotter weather)"
""
"Pretty high carbonation and a medium light body. Really enjoyable beer. Would be excellent on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"By far one of the best beers that is mass produced. I have found variance though from small bottles vs. big bottles, particularly when drinking it in the EU. The fresher it is the more spice and flavor it has. This is a very refined beer. It goes down smooth with no weird tastes. You can never go wrong with this one."
""
""
""
""
"330ml bottle. Tripel Karmeliet large Tulip glass. Bright gold color & clear appearance. White foam, very close & lasting crown. Belgian yeast, sugar, intense herbal, pale cereal, subtle phenolic & cane sugar aromas as well as citric, vanilla & estery hints. Sweet malty & sparkling upfront rounded by spicy touch & gentle fruity bitterness. Medium to full body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Velvet palate, voluptuous & dense with spiced notes. ABV is felt as a kind & sugary heat. Crisp herbal & bready freshness in the middle. Long sweet finish lingers in a fruity aftertaste – peach & apricot- with vanilla touches. Refreshing & delightful!!"
""
""
"O - This is one of the best tripels I've tried, and I'd easily put it on par with La Fin Du Monde. As for which one of these is superior, I don't know of I could give you an answer. A bit steep at $14 per 750ml or $6 per 12oz bottle, but I feel like this was worth the money. With La Fin being so much cheaper, I don't know if I'll try this again any time soon, but it's definitely at the top of its game for the style."
""
""
"Light bodied with champagne like effervescence. Surprisingly mild in flavor which is awesome, light toasty graininess, dry biscuits, sweet fruitiness along the mid-palate with an extremely dry and clean finish with an earthy herbal hop flavor. Extremely subtle with delicate flavors that layer beautifully. Light refreshingly and full of immense subtle character that is in perfect balance."
""
"Tripel Karmeliet would make a fantastic pairing with boisterous conversation and hors d ’oeuvres, or a flavorful meal."

"Was a bit disappointed. This is supposed to be one of the best tripels in the world, but I've had many beers that were much better. It is a good, decent beer, but not outstanding. I miss some spices in the aroma, the flavor is good, full but a bit flat. By no means a bad beer, but I just expected so much more of it."

"While not a big fan of triples, this one is pretty good. The subdued alcohol taste makes it easy to drink."
"Clear golden, white head with good formation and retention. In the nose fruity, spicy and orange, maltiness in second plan with earthiness os yeast. In the taste nice balance, maltiness, orange and yeast fruitness really in equilibirum. Really great belgian tripel, one of my favorites"

"The taste starts out a little yeasty and definitely carbonated. This carbonation holds as the taste adds a little tartness. A bit of banana sneaks in as well. The starting taste, however, remains as the backbone throughout. The rest of the tastes simply accent the flavor."

"O-I found this Tripel quite unique, it has a bit of saison-like character to it"
"purchased at total wine in naples,fl for 15.99$ for a 4-pk of 11.2 oz bottles."
"O: I can't say it's my favorite tripel. There's a lot of good ones out there and this is to me lacks the depth of some of the other Belgians and even some American examples. But the crispness here, enhanced by healthy carbonation, is a pleasant surprise."

"O-great tripel great wheat taste and light wonderful amounts of sweetness and spice,"
"O: An idyllic Belgian Tripel Ale. A true nod to the pilsener heritage with tons of Saaz hops and clean, crisp drinking experience. The Karmeliet abby cleverly used wheat and oat as they advertise instead (or in addition to) Belgian candi sugar. This provides extra alcohol and grain flavor while remaining dry. The balance in this beer is so complex, with low aromatics, big hop flavor, low bitterness and lots of oomph. For me, this is a whimsical blend of classic Saaz hop flavor with high quality malts brewed in the Belgian tradition and is remarkable every sip of the way."

" Basically, this one was nearly void of all of the really enjoyable aspects of this style. Perhaps my bottle was a lame duck, because clearly, this is a highly rated version of the style, but I call 'em as I taste 'em. I will give this another shot before I call it good."

"probably the second best tripel out there, behind only the one from westmalle, which to me is the end all and be all of the style. this one pours a lot more clear than that one, yellowy and shiny with an inch of really active white bubbles and soda looking carbonation racing to the surface. the nose is sweet, probably from the oats, and the yeast is nicely bready. light fruit notes as well, maybe pears or green apples. the taste is immediately peppered from the yeast, spicy really, quite intense as it finishes. its a good balance with the sweeter malt. the feel is probably what makes this what it is, a beer of lore. that's because its ultra carbonated with an extremely dry finish. it tickles my tongue quite hard, and swallows easy with just the pepper left on my tongue. soft pepper, white pepper, but pepper all the same. just a hint of warm alcohol too, maybe a little more than necessary, prevents sessionability, but I like whats going on here overall, an excellent example of a Belgian tripel."

"Nearly two fingers white head, small bubbles, pretty fast dissipation. Fruity nose, sweet, peaches, green apple with light coriander aroma in the finish. The pepper notes are a bit more pronounced in the taste, pushing the fruitiness aside. Full mouthfeel, average effervescence, lingering coriander in the finish. A pretty full bodied and spicy variation on the style, certainly unique in my experience. Worth a try for fans of the style."

"Overall - A great beer that strikes me more as a fusion between a saison and a trippel. It wasn't what I was at all expecting, but it was a very nice experience."
"After sitting down with some time, it is hard not to really marvel at the complexity of this brew and just how great it is. Brings some flavors that can be abrasive to the table but they all seem to balance out very well. Not the first time and won't be the last time I have this one, a must try."

"Sampled from the 33cl brown glass bottle. The blonde hazy beer leaves a nice 1.5 inch white head. A bready aroma predominates. A citrusy, yeasty flavor is evident, light mouthfeel, the high alcohol is not at all evident. This is a unique,, very special beer."

"o: I'm more used to this type of flavor than I was when I first tried Sofie. Just not digging it as much as I had hoped. Clearly my palate needs more schooling since this is a top rated BA brew. Perhaps an old bottle though, since others report milder flavors. No explanation of the code on Dating Beer, but there is a Best Before block on the label, with H. B.G. B.E. 3.25 10:38 in it, whatever that means. Bottle conditioned so perhaps the yeast just went wild. It really does taste like a pungent Farmhouse Saison rather than a Tripel."

"O: Really clean and crisp beer. Well integrated flavors complementing each other with no one specific flavor dominating."

"Poured from a 75 cL Belgian bottle into a tulip glass, bottle ""best by"" date is 4-4-15, drank on 10/11/13. Pours a brilliantly clear gold color with a large white head . Lots of visible carbonation. Smell is very fruity and yeasty, some citrus to it. Taste has a little funk to it and a lot of yeast character, fades into a lingering alcoholic sensation with a slight hop bitterness. Highly carbonated mouthfeel balances the strong flavor nicely for a good crisp finish. Overall a very good beer, traditional tripel style."

"Ah, perfection. I have had many tripel karmeleits and it is a time for a review. Had at Yard House on tap in Fenway. This has a bland blonde color which masks the taste. Smells of a malty scent. The taste though resonates with a great blend of hops and malt which is hard to match. I like this a lot. Great stand by. My go to fantastic beer. Can't say enough about this perfect beer"

Perhaps it is one of the best tripels I have had, and it is a great way to celebrate life, which is why I am drinking it today. To me there is nothing better than that full Belgian yeast profile...it screams happiness, and this beer brings it."

"This really has that wondeful combination of a bit of fruitness of La Fin du Monde, but also that really strong dry finish with the classic Belgian tripels. It’s a light refreshing beer and bounces around the palate. My favorite non barrel aged tripel."
""
""
""
"It's VDubb's rehearsal dinner, and this beer stood out for me on the menu. It's been too long since my last Karmeliet. This stuff pours a mostly clear gold topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, light black pepper, clove, restrained citrus (I imagine a small, literally-fruity straightjacket), and Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, with the yeast and its spices dancing their way into my heart (or, at least more directly, my stomach). The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, as solid a tripel as I remember, this one tends toward the drier, more saison-like end of the spectrum than the sweeter end. It's good times regardless."

Dangerously drinkable as after finishing 1 bottle I didn't hesitate to get a 2nd. Went well with dinner (Sweet and Spicy chicken and brown rice) and the 2nd bottle was a great dessert."

"A golden yellow with a huge long lasting white creamy he’d on the pour into a chalice. Aroma and Taste of Belgian yeast, bread, a nice ripe fruity bouquet, with some nice citrus mildly spicy fruity hops. A medium bodied ale, crisp with lively carbonation and sweet dry spicy hops on the palate. Finish is sweet biscuit malt, Belgian yeast, bread, citrus apple fruity notes with some flavorful spicy fruity hops bitterness for balance. Overall a excellent, flavorful and enjoyable ale. Very nice indeed."

"On tap at Elgin Public House. Poured into branded Tripel Karmeliet tulip glassware with a massive head and bright golden hue. This was my first tripel style beer. Smells of honey, orange, spicy, fruity mango deliciousness. Sweet taste and the balance of the beer makes this a very sneaky 8.4% ABV. Clean and smooth mouthfeel but I might be biased as I don't like a lot of carbonation in my beers. Finishes dry and amplified alcohol taste towards the bottom. Overall I loved it and can't wait to try more tripel style ales - have my eye on the Allagash Curieux next."

"O: This is a solid brew. It doesn't strike me as a super traditional triple, as the flavors remind me more of a saison, but this is a delicious treat on a hot summer day. I like it. I'd drink this again if I was in the mood for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This Belgian brew is a very gassy and very smooth drink with a hint of fruit. Tasty brew to say the least! Light blonde appearance with a fluffy head, could sip, gulp, or chug this one! There is essentially no bite and leaves you wanting another. This beer is a definite must!"
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. Had never heard reviews or tasted before. I was really surprised by how much I liked drinking it all the way to the end. For me, normally a tripel is a bit of a challenge as it overpowers me by the end of the beer. This one tasted great all the way through. Would buy again and recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Tripel. Definitely different than other Tripels, but worth trying. It had a superb head and was good tasting to me on the whole. Towards the end it got a little too sticky for my taste (but honestly that is something I don't like about most tripels). Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"

""
""
""
""
"Notes: Why did it take me so long to try this brew? Recommended over and over again. Being typically not too keen on a good part of triples I overlooked it until now. Well, glad to fix that mistake. Fruity and dry, this flows great and is a nice crowd pleaser. I'm sure revisiting and sharing..."

"Pair this beer honey smoked salmon over a rice pilaf, or get a smoked spicy sausage with sauerkraut, caramelized onions, and smoked peppers for some contrast"

"Yes, this was strong but it never felt it. While I couldn't get down this quickly, I never wanted to because I never had anything quite like this before. The way this beer faded from a Wit to a Tripel during each sip was a wonder to behold as the candy sugar quietly made its presence felt. It's not often that a beer this bold sneaks up on you but this one fit the bill and for any Belgian beer lover, this is certainly a must-try. It's a shame I can't find this in a larger size!"
"OVERALL: A very drinkable trip with only a slight maltiness that adds definition and depth to this perfect, all day ale."

"Excellent beer to be had at a tapas restaurant. A variety of seafoods was my personal preference. The beer was refreshing and also very full of body which helps the hollow after taste of most seafood. As with most seafood a slight hint of citrus will always entice the pallet. There were other delicacies that went well with the Triple Karmeliet too. A beer to be had with a variety of fine foods. Top notch compliment to the meal."

"A truly classic take on the style. Personally for me, I'd like it to be just a tad bigger, but make no mistake - this is one satisfying tripel that is an absolute must try. Like so many others, this a bit more flavorful as it warms. Halfway through the abv is making its presence felt - in a nice warming kind of way. Great brew."

"O: The mouthfeel just ruins it for me. Maybe it's because of the taste i had on the day, but somehow every sip i took was taken over by a lot of carbonation tingling. Also the flavor is too one dimensional. There's not much more then citrus fruits. The only good part is that you don't get any alcohol at all, which is an achievement considering the ABV."

"Pale blonde colour, a little over one finger of white head, good retention with some good lacing as well. Smell is a mix of yeast and spice, quite grassy, fruity as well, lots of citrus, lemon, pear, honey, banana and bits of bubble gum as well. Taste follows the nose with yeast and fruit, citrus, vibrant grassy/herbal/floral notes, mild bitter hop, honey candy sweetness, pear, apple, quite the complex drink with a ton of new flavours popping up with each sip. Fairly high active carbonation fitting for the style, medium-full body. Really great stuff here, among the best in the style, super complex and very delicious as well."

"Pours a blond color that is slightly hazy with big head. Smells like sweet grass, medicinal, faint sourness to smell, white sugar, spice. Tastes of wheat, straw, grassy, sweet oat cereal, honey, malt aftertaste, lemon. This was a great beer. I’ll have another."
"Pours hazy orange with a huge creamy/crispy slight off-white head. Aroma is orange peel, yeasty and some malt, the combination simply screams out what a true belgian tripel is. Flavour follows the aroma tightly, orange, spice and clear malty flavoured in a mellow malty sweetness. Finish is vaguely bitter but more malty and spiced. Very well balanced and still light. Uncomplicated (but not simple) and well crafted balance between the spices, malt and the yeast notes."
""
"O: A very malt-heavy tripel. You can really taste the different kinds of malts that they used so it's not so one-dimensional. Quite malty sweet in general with the strong yeast picking up a close second place. No real noticeable hops or bitterness. Tasty and delicious example of the style - a must-try if you like maltier tripels."

"The Karmeliet tripel is easier to drink than, say, a La Chouffe. There is nothing acidic or citrus-like about the Karmeliet tripel. It's a beer that doesn't have profundity. But you'll find yourself reaching for it again and again."
""
"This was a great Tripel. It was complex and refreshing. The abv was well hidden. This was dangerously easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer."
""
""
""
"O: Worth checking out for sure, a solid beer. It hides the alcohol well, without being too obvious about it."
""
""
"This is what a tripel should taste like. Nicely done."
""
""
"Edit--I have since had this beer again on multiple occasions, and it is coming back into my into my good graces. Perhaps the bottle that I reviewed got overheated (because, honestly, that it what is tasted like...skunked). Regardless, I am bumping up the smell, taste, and overall score by a half to a full point."
""
"Pours deep golden with a bright white sea foam-like two finger head, thin lacing as the head recedes. Clove, earthy yeast, grassy and herbal notes, and medicinal phenols on the nose. Fairly spicy and peppery, significant fruit notes perhaps a bit of papaya and mango. Heavy alcohol warmth that becomes more and more evident as the brew warms and is consumed. Fairly high, fizzy carbonation, on heavier side of medium bodied with a touch of syrup. Very complex with a very strong alcohol presence, but one of the better tripels I've had the pleasure of drinking."
""
"Medium bodied with a rather high level of carbonation, the mouthfeel is very good and drinkability is outstanding. Yeah, that's my bottom line for Tripel Karmeliet, outstanding."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this, probably one of my favorite Belgian ales so far!"
""
""
"O- This is a great triple! I been pushed enough times this week to try it, and I am so happy I finally got around to it. It is not complex with flavor, but very bold and robust indeed! Any fan of triple belgians, this is a must! If you are new to the style, you may not appreciate it as much. But I would definitely enjoy to try this again. GREAT beer!"
""
""
"D/O: I genuinely enjoy this beer in small quantities. But this is not my preferred style, and the banana/butter finish wears on me over time. A 25.4 ounce bomber is"

"O - Really really love this beer. One of my favorites for the style."

"overall, this is a different kind of brew for me. kind of hoppy-tasting, akmost, but without the piney flavor, i guess this is what an OAT< WHEAT< BARLEY from belgium tastes like. my apologies, i had a very time-consuming review erased into the nether regions of cyberspace and this is no reflection of the time or quality of that production. but what i would like to state here is that there is a very nice, relatively new, Belgium pub in Garden Grove, California called THE GLOBE which has this, and about 25 other beautiful Belgian brews, on tap. i have no interest in the business except for converting my hard-earned wages into beautiful belgian suds but i'd like to make more people in the area aware of this site."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with fizzy head. Very herbal nose, a little yeasty as well. Taste-wise it's a pretty big brew considering how light it feels. Herbal/medicinal sort of flavor plays with yeast and fruity phenols. I think it's a good beer and a major stand-out flavor profile among tripels."
""
""
""
"This was my first time tasting this tripel, and it is perfect for a summer day. Very distinctive. A world class tripel."
""
"The only negative comment I might make involves that carbonation I mentioned earlier. This is a beer that can make you full. But at 8.4% that isn't really a bad thing."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is enjoyable and relatively refreshing even though there is a fairly high ABV in which the alcohol is detectable. This is much more of a sipping beer but is very good. Very good example of the style."
""
""
""
"Aroma is of apple, pear, clove, coriander, and that signature Belgian yeast character. The smell is present but not overwhelming. The taste is spot on with the aroma, except with a massive dose of prickly carbonation. I'm also getting some citrus on the back end that wasn't as present in the aroma, as well as some mild hop bitterness. This is your textbook Belgian ale: spicy, prickly, and fruity. Not much to critique here, though one could argue that the extensive carbonation overwhelms some of the subtler elements in the taste. Regardless, this is one tasty and refreshing brew that goes down way too fast for its ABV."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber. Nice large white head that lasts a long time with nice lacing. Aroma subdued wheat. Flavor is wheat developing into sweet malt and light fruit. Sweet malt and spicy middle and finish with a touch of hops. Very well integrated. An excellent tripel and worth a revisit."

However as an authentic Belgian tripel it is an unbalanced mess and a disappointment to boot. On top of that, it had me all fooled into thinking I was going to be treated to a nice gueuze, which I am now craving. At $11 a bottle, there are much better triples to be had, but I am also inclined to give this one a second chance. After all, if I am reading the date correctly, this beer is a year and a half beyond peak freshness."

"O: given its overall rating, i had expected more complexity, i do suppose that this is a spot on representation of the style, it hits right as it should, drinks nicely enough and the alcohol is not perceivable"

"This is a solid tripel. It's pretty balanced, and it's distinctly Belgian. It's a little sweeter than I like a tripel, but it's good. Worth a try."
"Overall: Unrelenting and unapologetically Belgian. You want to taste Belgian yeast, drink this. Too aggressive in the long run."
"A tremendous beer all around. No weak spots. Easy to drink, smooth, alcohol is present, but plays nicely. Would love to have a few more of these."

"A nice brew, but this is a bit too sweet for me. Gets a bit boozy as it warms. In some ways, it reminds me of a cordial or sherry more than a beer. I can appreciate that this is a nice ale; it just isn't the ale for me."

"Overall: Very nice, unique tripel. The 750s (green bottles, ugh) go for between 11-13 around here. For that, it's not a bad deal, and provides a nice counterpoint to Chimay's version. I have yet to try the Westmalle and St. Bernardus. This is very good, balanced beer, with the yeast doing wonderful things but nto getting overly complicated or muddled. Still, for $15 a 4-pk, I don't think I can give this more than a solid B, even if it's edging higher."
""
"O: If you're a fan of triples you will not disappointed. Dangerously delicious and coy at hiding that 8.4%. Enjoy, at home, sitting down."
""
"Poured from bottle into chalice. Pours hazy golden color with big white pillowy head. Sweet floral and herbal odor. Amazing aroma with vanilla, alcohol and some aroma hop. Heavy sweet taste with some bitterness. Medium body with lively carbonation and creamy silky texture. Strong and long alcoholic finish with all the aromas which appears earlier. Fantastic beer!"
"Overall a truly astounding beer. I have tasted a few Belgen beers before but this surmounts them all by far."

"Golden straw-colored with a rich thick head. Aroma of very citrusy hops, almost like Sprite. Malty rich sweetness to the hop flavor with definite lemony finish. Really pleasant bright carbonation. I typically don't like tripels to be this sweet but I appreciate how this one kind of marks its territory as a certain take on the style."

"I received a gift set of this brew with a glass from my fiancee. 11.2 oz bottle poured into the comically over sized chalice that came with the set. After the pour, it becomes very clear why the glass is sized and shaped the way it is. The clear orange liquid collects in the bulb shaped bottom of the glass, and about 4 inches of head collect on top. Splotchy lacing is left behind and after the head settles down, about a centimeter of thick white foam retains nicely. The aroma is yeasty with huge notes of lemon zest, waves of chamomile, a touch of clove along with some sourdough bread. The taste is starts off with moderate sweetness with notes of fruit. Citrus is present along with sourdough bread. The finish is dry. Great balance...the abv is very well hidden. The feel is highly carbonated with a medium body. Overall, this a very tasty and well balanced Tripel. It drinks more like a Belgian Pale which makes it a little dangerous."
""
""
"O- excellent triple. One of the better ones I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly murky light yellow with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very fruity with some spice and very floral aromas. Taste is of grain, spice, yeast, and floral flavors. There is an almost medicinal bitterness on the palate that sticks around after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good tripel but it's much different from what I was expecting."
""
""
"O: A really solid tripel but nothing really jumped out at me to make me love it."
""
"O: Real nice Tripel, to my preferences its better than the St. Bernardus as well as the Westmalle. Refreshing, clean, drinkable."
""
""

""

"Medium bodied with some very exciting carbonation, this beer's mouthfeel gives it a rather deceptive drinkability. The body really allows for full taste bud immersion into this beer while never becoming coating or sticky (which one might expect from a beer of 8.4% ABV). The carbonation is just as expected. It fizzles, and rumbles, and explodes in your mouth, trying to disturb your delicious experience. Luckily, the body is big enough to stand up to the carbonation."
""
""
"Body is medium while oat adds creamy sensation to the fluffy mouthfeel."
"This pours a golden orange color with a nice foamy pure white head and still great carbonation. Some haze from sediment. Smells of fruit, malts, and some sweetness. Not overpowering but inviting smell. Taste is full of fruit and honey up front with a nice malted bitter finish. Still some alcohol on the palate as well. Really good tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall I thought this would be slightly pass prime but it is still drinking really well. Very good belgium tripel."
""
""
"Overall, an amazing beer. I have no doubts that this should be in the Holy Trinity of Tripels. Must try this if you haven't!"
""
""
"O: And here’s the reason a trip to Belgium is on my bucket list: besides pairing this with some local European cuisine, I’d love to have another bottle or two of this (maybe even fresher). Complex and satisfying beer."
""
""
"Overall: Very good. I think this beer tends to be sweeter on draft, but seems more balanced out of the bottle."
"Overall (4.25). Yet another amazing example of Belgium's finest."

"Pale amber in color with a slight haze. Pours with decent carbonation, an off-white head, and minimal lacing. Flavor of orange and coriander nicely balanced. Smooth and drinkable. Complimented foods from pizza to roast chicken."
"Poured from tap onto tulip. Golden hay color with a good amount of foam that is gone quick but leaves spotty lacing behind. Smells of belgian yeast and slight fruit. Taste is of belgian yeasts, banana, biscuity malts...but it has more personality than I can pass along here. Smooth as can be. Just a superb offering and world class of the style."
""
""
"Golden in appearance with a nice white head. A warm, sweet aroma and matching flavor of fruit of some banana, some grape, some citrusd some wheat, some bread, and spice (coriander shows itself, maybe clove too). The alcohol is masked pretty well but not completing hidden. A nice creamy, medium bodied moutfeel with a nice dose of carbonation to give it some life. A very nice tripel that is worthy of return visits."
""
""
""
"Pours a goldenrod body with a finger tall white head in my wine glass. Carbonation is visible rising in the body. Smell is sweet, citric and earthy. The taste is of smooth malts, fruit, apple, wheat, citrus. Mouthfeel is medium, with good carbonation. This is a pretty good tripel, though not my absolute favorite."
""

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best by 3/29/2011. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts the entire glass. Decent lacing on the glass; with extremely ample carbonation streaming up and keeping a dense head going. Aromas of big pepper, clove, lemon zest, grass, coriander, biscuit, orange peel, herbs, and yeast spices. Fantastic and well balanced aromas. Taste of big pepper, herbal, lemon zest, clove, biscuit, coriander, orange peel, grass, and yeast spices. Fairly dry finish; but some lingering notes of herbal, citrus peel, biscuit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Medium high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Fair amount of prickly carbonation initially that dies down in the glass. Very smooth and drinkable for 8.4%; with only a slight alcohol warming on the finish. Overall this is an incredible Tripel, as I was expecting it to be. Fantastic and unique flavors; with great balance, complexity, and smoothness. It has taken me far too long to finally try this one."
"A world class standard. Simple as that. I used the glass to make a vigorous pour as this brew is well carbonated. Explosive head that stays and stays. The lack of copious lace is the only knock I can find in this slightly cloudy, golden honey colored brew's appearance. There is some due to the goodly carbonation and high malt content. Aroma has lots of sweet malt and a mild peppery spiciness. A trace amount of alcohol and light Belgian funk.. An apple and grape tinged fruitiness merge with a dinner roll yeasty breadiness. Taste is superb. Very well balanced with honeyed malt and mild dinner roll sweetbread. A bit of vinous sourness flows into an artful hop combination that is drying and delicately bitter. Finish is so clean and dry that you wind up drinking this like a lager. Feel has just the right amount of carbonation, finely effervescent and and creamy. This beer feels lighter than it is and it makes for superb drinkability. As i said at the top, a world class brew that set the standard in drinkability for tripels and is really in a class by itself. If all I could drink was tripels this would probably be the one."
""
""
"This would be a great summer beer, but I like how it worked when it is below freezing outside."
""
"O: A decent Tripel, I usually stay away from green bottles, I'll have to try one of their 12oz brown bottles to see how this compares"
""
""
"Beautiful sticky fluffy white head leaving great lacing and not going anywhere. The aroma coming off the head is great as well. The smell alone just lifts you up off your feet, peaches banana, clove, citrus zest, fresh baked bread, belgian yeast, springtime, flowers, the best smelling woman you ever laid your nose on. Tastes similar but different. Honey sweetness, granny smith apple, bread still there, floural still there, some clove I think and that woman, even though she smacked you upside the head for smelling her, is still there as well. Effervescent MF and light on the tongue. A beautiful beer that is right up there with the best of the style. One day I would like to have it side by side with La fin du Munde adn Wstmalle."

"a massive three figer head with the consistency of dish soap bubbles sits atop a crystal clear golden straw colored body. even though the head eventually dies down, you can still see hundreds of bubbles rise to the top to hold the foam cap together. my nose is greeted with hints of spicy yeast, banannas, wheat and oats to produce a wonderful bread aroma. i can taste a definate wheat bread body with a mellow bananna flavor and a spicy dry finish. mouthfeel is light and airy at first thanks to the nice balance of carbonation. then it becomes heavier as the grains and yeast form a bready body and finishes with a long dry spice finish."
"O - A very enjoyable and classic example of the tripel style. Would recommend if you're in the mood for a Belgian tripel."

"I had a chance to try the Karmeliet Tripel at ""The Bank"" in Wheaton, IL. The beer pours a hazy yeast filled pale yellow or straw color, very large foamy white head which left a very spotty lace due to the fruity precence. The smell is sweet yeast esters, some banana, some pepper, honey, very good. Feel is light lots of tingling carbonation. Taste is good, there is a nice dry finish, I get sweet honey, malts, a little hop bite, some peppery aftertaste along with the dryness. Overall a good triple."

"Tripel Karmeliet: I am not one to by $20 four packs of beer. But after a year of exploring beer on Beer Advocate, I was puzzled by how these expensive Belgian beers could have thousands of reviews and sky high ratings. Are they better that a New Belgium Triple? What is the fuss? So I sprung for a four pack of Tripel Karmeliet, which was the only A rated Tripel I could locate at my favorite beverage store. You have probably tried this brew, so you know the body is cloudy and golden in hue. The head is thick and billowy, laces well and forms wonderful patterns as you make your way to the last sip. The aroma is bountiful with amazing complexity. Which brings me to the flavor, or should I say experience. Waves of ever-changing notes wash over the palate. All of those adjectives you read in beer reviews, well, you can actually taste in this brew: tree ripe apricot, light dust of fresh ground cinnamon spice, warm homemade bread dough, lick of a cement trowel. In the Tripel Karmeliet these adjectives really do apply. Now I get it. But is it beer? After trying many brews, this Tripel blows you away with the complexity of flavors, and leaves you in wonderment of how did they do that? How can you brew beer with those notes? But really, the Karmeliet does not taste like beer, does it? I would not serve one to a beer lover who does not have a minimum of Belgian experience or he/she will think I just added fruit juices to an now ruined Budweiser."
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Tripel. Nice use of fruit flavors and spices that complement each other well."
""
""
"Price Point - $10.99/750ML bottle"
""
"Overall - According to the Bosteels' website, ""the name Tripel Karmeliet thus refers both to its origin and its in-bottle fermentation."" I find that confusing. Are they saying that it *actually* has been fermenting twice and then the third time being the bottle?? I dunno. But regardless, this is a quality beer and one to be enjoyed on almost any occasion. I love the complexity and sweeter elements to help distract from the bitter, dryer flavors induced by the grains. Again, arguably a little too sweet in my opinion, but an excellent Tripel nonetheless!"
""
""
""
"Is it a contradiction for something to be really subtle yet complex at the same time? Because that's what I'd say about this. Character without missing refreshment at all...I wish I could get this on-tap locally."

"O: Wonderfully well-balanced and delicious beer. I am so glad I found a four-pack and have another three to enjoy and savor. Highly recommend this beer."

"O: I like my tripels on the drier, spicier side, and this fits the bill. Very drinkable, too, much more so than most of this style and potency. This would make a great holiday dinner beer."
""
""

"Goes down crisp and clean, almost like a normal lager. Very easy drinking."
""
""
"Had it from a growler and paired it with chicken, rice and squash. This is good. A good ballgame watching beer. As much as it pains me to say it, this is a better beer than La Fin du Monde. This is good stuff. This is what a triipel should be. Would certainly drink again."
""
""
""

"Overall Impression- I am definitely going to be keeping my eyes opened for this one in stores! I was able to keep a good tab on most of the attributes but there can be MANY more with this one. If you get a chance go for it! This one is a flavorful Tripel and would suggest for anyone out there. Easy drinking too."

"this beer pours a nice golden yellow with a fluffy white head. the smell is lightly spicey with hints of fruit and a nice bready maltiness to it. the flavor follows with the light fruitiness slightly beating out the light spiciness and malty backbone. this has a nice light mouthfeel with high carbonation. overall a great tripel."
""
""
"It is , when well poured of cxourse , a tough of soft fluid silk that fils your mouth, it's full flavour and frechness at the same time is the key of it's well diserved succes.

"Tripel Karmeliet pours a pretty clear golden yellow. The clean white foam billows up to near four fingers in height, and it's quite a while before it's faded all the way back down. Everything looks great, except for the lacing (or relative lack-thereof). The nose is fruitier than I typically find in a tripel, and leans more towards pear than a menagerie of pale fruits. There's a bit of a phenolic edge to the aroma as well, with some clove and even a bit of coriander standing out in particular. The sweet-spicy balance is just a little off for me though. The malts allow some more room for granny smith apples and apricots, among others, to join the pears in the fruity open to the flavor profile. There's also a honey-like sweetness that weaves in around the fruits and manages to linger for just an extra second. As with the nose, the phenolic back end is primarily clove and coriander (though the clove is more dominant here than in the aroma), and it struggles a little bit to come through against the sweetness that came for it. Unsurprisingly I guess, given my above quarrels with the beer, I find the body to be a little bit too chewy and profound. The carbonation has a bit of pep and liveliness to it, but I imagine if it didn't have to cut through as much sweetness, it would really pop. Tripel Karmeliet is a fairly enjoyable beer, it just doesn't seem to be as well attenuated as most of the tripels I've really enjoyed."
""
"D - A very very good Tripel, but a definite notch down from top of class grouping... Lots of good things going on but a bit rough around the edges in all categories..."

"Literally a dinner rolled up in a beer. The only tripel I've had that's more ridiculous and fascinating than this is Unibroue's La Fin du Monde. One of the big ones responsible into getting me into more diverse beers. Despite inconsistencies in the recipe, it's still a beer I could order all night without getting tired of it and eventually collapsing on the floor in a drunken euphoria."

"It's more viscous than I expected but it works wonderfully with the slightly prickly carbonation to provide a smooth creamy experience. Probably my favorite tripel at the moment which is saying quite a lot as it's one of my favorite styles."
"Drinkability – This goes down soooo well. One of the best tripels out there."
"excellent overall and I can't recommend it enough."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice from a 750. Straw yellow color with a good inch of white foam. Smell is wheat with a little lemon, not overwhelming. Taste is very smooth and balanced. Nothing really jumps out at me. A little citrus maybe. No alcohol taste which is pretty outstanding for a 8.5 ABV. Nice carbonation. Great medium mouthfeel. Overall this is a great, easy drinking beer."
"Pours a fluffy and sturdy gold with a pure white one-inch head that stuck around for longer than most. It never completely dissipates so there is a constant quarter-inch of creaminess. Medium amount of lacing. It has a very interesting look because of the lasting head and retention. Aroma is crisp wheat and banana, even a bit grassy. I catch a scent similar to noble hops as well. A great tasting brew that is crisp and wheaty. Banana, citrusy, and buttery flavors dominate. A very creamy feel with moderate carbonation and not a heavy brew at all for 8.4% abv. Tripel Karmeliet is just downright quality and a mastered blend of grains that gives you one of the best Tripels on Earth."
"O- A fairly solid tripel. Pretty good flavors, albeit a bit less spicy than I like from the style. Even so, it's worth a try."
"O - very good example of the style."
"There's a lot going on here flavor-wise. Initially, it tastes like a wheat beer - crisp and dry. Then the flavors develop and it becomes sweet and creamy with a nice tart, fruityness underneath. Starting about mid-palate, a faint champagne-like dryness starts to impede and carries you to the finish. This is a really good beer, but the sweetness would make it difficult for me to drink more than one."
"O: I think this might be the best Tripel I've had. Really a great beer. Now if only they would switch to dark glass."
"O: Delicious! Best with salty/fatty foods like munster and whole wheat crackers."
"T: This is a really great tripel. Lots of grassy hop flavor and earthy malts backed up by some subtle spiciness. One of the better tripels I've had."
"O- Great belgian, very true to the style."
"D: Just the right amount of sweetness with a pleasant medley of flavors which transition well."
"D - Nicely done, the malt is readily apparent, but it takes a back seat to the spicy yeast and musty hops."
"O: Solid beer that likely would do good with a bit of age on it to knock down this oppressive alcoholic heat on the tongue. Time to go buy another and chuck it in the cellar."
"This brew poured as a hazy orange yellow color with a fluffy white head on top. It had a pretty good lacing also. The smell of Beligan yeast and some citrusy aromas were heavy in this one. The taste on the first sip was a bit boozy I thought, as I drank more it got much better. Some nice yeasty flavors with some fruit in there too. The mouthfeel is a smooth with a decent carbonation to it. Overall the I thought that this brew was very nice."
"Have found it to be even better the 2nd time."
"Overall: A very solid, well-made representation of the tripel style."
"This poured a golden/yellow color with about an inch of white head which dissipated quickly, but has a champagne-like bubbliness to it. Really nice looking. Aroma is typical for a tripel, belgian yeast, spices, coriander, etc. Taste is spicy up front, a bready, belgian yeast taste finish. The carbonation dances on your tongue. Very nice. Overall, this is a pretty good tripel, I'd say you can get better at The Bruery, but good, for sure. I'd probably pay the 11.99 for this again. Fuck it."
"F: refreshing, complex and well balanced, some sweetness, spicy and very delicated bitterness, very long lasting, medium light body, throat warming,"
"Overall - very good taste...not terribly interesting, but not at all boring either."
"O: As a tripel should be, it's sweet. If you are a fan of this style as I am, you'll enjoy this beer, especially with a big ol' plate of fish 'n chips. Cheers."
"Takes the bottle version and shaves off all the rough edges. Frighteningly drinkable."
"O- Pretty good Tripel overall, but I really think a real-person bottle would help it. It's a reasonably good beer that should definitely be protected from light..."
"One of my favorite beers! Sit back and enjoy!"
"O- A pretty great Tripel, the alcohol on this beer is done extremely well."
"A very drinkable tripel, very enjoyable as well. Definitely worth picking up if seen, and enjoying whenever a the light-fruit Belgian style beckons."
"D - delicious in my book; the lightly toasted bread and grain is a treat"
"Pours a hazy yeast filled pale yellow or straw color, very large foamy white head which dissipates quickly to a thin layer. The smell is sweet yeast esters, some banana, some pepper, some funk, honey, very good. Feel is light lots of tingling carbonation. Taste is good, there is a nice dry finish, I get sweet honey, malts, a little hop bite, some peppery aftertaste along with the dryness. Overall a good triple."
"But it ain't no Westmalle Tripel."
"O - A well-balanced, good tasting, lightish tripel."
"O: One of my favorite tripels. I actaully get a craving for this specific brew at least once a month..."
"Overall- a phenomenal beer and one of the best tripels out there."
"O: Very drinkable, maybe not in quantity. Nice balanced yeast character."
"Overall this was a nice experience. It's a tripel but it remains me of a Belgian wit a bit."
"This one pours a nice gold in color with moderate turbidity and a one finger thin and very well carbonated head. The aromas are very yeasty and it is FULL of citrus overtones. Damn, didn't expect so much orange. It's almost like seriously faded hops. It smells great. The flavors too have a perfect amount of yeast and spice and again this very heavy on the oranges. It's an orange and coriander bomb, tangerines included. It drinks light to medium in body and is very well carbonated. Overall this is a pretty damn good tripel. Everyone knows it, tell your friends."
"Note: For some reason, I'm finding the large bottles to have a more effervescent body and lighter taste profile. Unsure of what might be causing this difference."
"O - excellently delicious"
"Overall a very solid triple."
"I am not familiar with the brewery, or the beer for that matter. But I like it. This is one good brew. Again, just because it smells good and tastes good… but provides my palate with two totally different experiences. Bottoms up people!"
"O: A great Belgian for beginners, those who've experience Belgians, or simply an old Fan..."
"This beer was great and dangerously sessionable."
"This is one of my all time favorite beers to get all over Belgium. I don't always visit ""craft"" beer places while I'm here, my wife and I regularly go out with friends, and. Always stoked to see either westmalle triple, or Karmeliet triple on the menu."
"I am pleased with Karmeliet - not top of the line."
"D: Fantastic Tripel. Easily one of my favourites. One of the most well balanced beverages I've tasted."
"Cheers."
"This is an absolutely exceptional beer, the best tripel I have ever had bar none"
"Overall: For me the best tripel in the world."
"Dark amber color, slightly cloudy with smallish head and good lacing. Complex, spicy aromas and flavor. Muted hops and bitterness, nice malt backbone, somewhat boozy but very pleasant flavor. Yeasty and faintly citrusy. Carbonation is perfect, very nice mouthfeel. Highly drinkable despite the ABV, which may get you into a bit of trouble if you're not careful. Not the top of the heap, but close. Overall a really good tripel!"
"O: Nice appearance to this good tasting tripel. Enjoyable."
"Overall - this is a great tripel but nothing about it makes it especially remarkable. It does everything well but lacks a unique character and has none of the quirks of the trappist tripels. Also a little too sweet IMHO. None-the-less in my top 10 in this style. The mouthfeel is definitely the highlight."
"Poured into a signature stem glass, an amber-honey color, hazy, with a huge puff of foamy white head that almost floats right out of the glass. Retains well and leaves some delicate lacing. Aroma is full of spice and perfume, with essences of fruit. Light and crisp on the tongue with a cavalcade of flavors: herbs and floral perfume give way to peach, pear, melons, orange blossom, and a touch of banana esters, with a ubiquitous peppery sensation. Tasty all over, with hints of its relatively high alcohol content. Medium-bodied, complex, full of flavor, and highly drinkable."
"I can't believe I'm just reviewing this for the first time. This is a phenomenal tripel and a phenomenal beer. I've had better tripels, but this is quite good, especially for the price. Love it."
"The mouthfeel was a bit low carbed, maybe that kept the flavors from popping? I hope that was the problem, hopefully it was a bad pour or something, but i wasn't impressed."
"Overall a really nice trippel. Kudos to the dude who made the recommendation."
"Dr: Nice drinkability, decent quality. Fair price. Give her a spin, lads."
"O: Decent, but not my favorite Tripel by any means. I will continue to keep my eyes open for this beer though, and will hopefully grab a fresher one for comparison if I come across it."
"O: This is a great Belgian beer for those of us who prefer a subtle, soft flavor. Go for the 750ml though.. way more economical."
"Strongly present residual malts lead the way in the taste and occur mostly mid-tongue and follow thru to the finish. Dry and spicy all over. Hop character was very balanced, as well as a very balanced hop to citrus spice. A nearly perfect feel lends much favor to the taste and drinkability. Great brew. Could have enjoyed many more that night if I wasn't on a budget, ;)"
"very nice, super sweet, smooth."
"O: Very tasty with a great mouthfeel, extremely easy drinking and overall a very nice example of style."
"O/D - Fantastic brew. It looks great and the smell and flavor are really well balanced. Great brew to drink on a summer evening or anytime for that matter. It does a great job of showcasing the malts and yeast. The light hops take second stage and back them up very well. I will drink this many times in the future."
"O - A nice tripel. Its well balanced and pleasant drinking. I think this a great example of this style. Not sure if the carbonation is normally this high, but thats the only flaw i could find in this beer. I will definitely try this again."
"Overall it's just another satisfying tripel to be had."
"All around, a solid beer. I was happy to be able to celebrate with a tripel of that caliber."
"O: This is terrific; it is beautiful and is more dynamic than most tripels."
"The only thing I could have wished for is a little bit extra mouthfeel. The belgians always seem to like their beers very light, whilst I prefer a little extra body. Well, if there was such a thing as a perfect beer there would be little reason to continue this fantastic hobby, would there?"
"O - A superb Tripel, stands among the best!"
"Light/medium body with a smooth feel, extremely drinkable!"
"D. Heavyish, but balanced that it doesn't leave you wanting a change."
"Drinkability/Overall-Yeah, perfect; just perfect, goes down as easy as anything but its complexities demand it be sipped. I cannot get enough of this Tripel."
"This is by far the best tripel I've ever had. Previously I counted myself as a dedicated fan of dubbels but reserved tripels for more adventurous, risk taking moments - I wasn't the biggest fan of the style. This beer just changed that. Fantastic."
"Overall - in the style as a strong effervescent ale with restrained alcohol and flavor. Very nicely made."
"Good triple. Glad I tried but may only get once in a while."
"WONDERFUL!"
"O- the ourfuminess is what makes this beer a little much on the palate. If it was turned down a few notches, the beer would be a lot more drinkable."
"Tasty and drinkable brew. I think this particular bar may have an old tap as I remember this being more carbonated back at Wurstkuche in LA. The lower carbonation did not seem to detract much from a solid brew."
"Taste is fruit, freshly baked bread, flowery leaves, light warming alcohol hint. It has gentle, subtle complexity giving good well-roundedness and depth of character but is highly drinkable and gentle. The feel is soft yet lively. Overall, this is an excellent ale combing great complexity with high drinkability and smoothness."
"Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation, floral and sweet aftertaste"
"Medium body and good carbonation. A pretty good triple overall. The peppery notes are fairly unique. A bid yeasty foe me. For god's sake don't let any sediment into your glass."
"What's up with this ""overall"" shit?"
"A great medium to light beer with a lot of carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable. Great job!"
"Pours a very golden, hazy, straw color with a large white head that hangs around for quite some time. Head is beautiful and frothy. Scent is a little funky with some delightful spiciness and fruity aromas. Nice Belgian yeast scent linger in my Bruery tulip glass with hints of grass and green apples. Taste is initially spicy with some pepper and coriander quickly followed by delicious Belgian yeast flavors. Then I get some grain and tasty fruits with lots of green apple and a bit of lemon. Finishes nice and sweet with a little banana. Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry with a medium body. Drinkability is very high, as I could sip on this all night and ABV is well hidden. Overall, a fantastic take on this difficult, complex style."
"Overall, a top notch brew for the style. I've waited too long to try it and now need to have it again. Definitely a benchmark for the style."
"o- a tasty tripel well balanced with fruit citrus and hops an easy to enjoy"
"O: a little dryer than some but is a good tripel. Will definatly seek this one out again."
"A little sweeter than I like, love the fruit character though. Peach, pear syrup, hint of banana, light spiciness, floral and grassy, dry finish but outdone by sweet body, some alcohol warming in the finish. Zippy carb, hefty body. Not as refined as some but nice character."
"o 4.5 goodness cubed, not tripled? a little brasher than the fin, perhaps, but the dynamism is excellent."
"Overall - A nice triple. Its balanced pretty good. Just wish it has some more fruitness to it. Easy and smooth to drink, almost a little to easy. I like my triples a little more strong and citrus influencd, la fin du monde is a perfect example. This is soild and would drink again."
"Tripel Karmeliet is very dry, very smooth, and very carbonated. Swishing around the mouth really brings out the alcohol, but its just the right amount. I could drink this beer over and over again. I really wasn't expecting anything like this."
"O amazing a great tripel. yes there is better but they are few and far between. I am seriously considering serving this for the toast at my wedding in lieu of the fiancee's OK."
"Final Notes: One heck of a beer, and it would be even better if they didn't package it in those damn green bottles (seriously, what's up with those?). Sweet and fruity, would be a great champagne substitute. I love it."
"A solid Tripel with well balanced flavour and well hidden alcohol. A delicious beer that I would more than happily have again."
"One of the more hoppier Tripels out there. Very complex flavors. Glad I had a chance to try this on tap."
"Tripel Karmeliet comes in a really nice bottle. It has a pale orange colour and a big head that lasts. The smell is mostly Belgian yeast with a hint of cloves. The taste is all yeast up front into a real kick of alcohol and cloves. This beer has a very intense taste, but I don't really like it. The combination of cloves and alcohol is overpowering."
"This was a pretty good beer, nice flavor and very easy to drink."
"Some of these Belgian styles are becoming among my favorites."
"Very drinkable which could be dangerous at 8.4%ABV. I found myself taking a lot of sips exploring the flavors and it was gone before I realized and left me wanting another. A great beer I will seek out again."
"-Cheers"
"D: very tasty and refreshing. slightly on the lighter side for a trip, but still a solid example."
"Medium mouthfeel with a high level of carbonation. Superior Tripel."
"Tripel Karmeliet was pale gold in color and hazy. It had a towering white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was yeasty with pepper, clove and other spices. The taste was peppery spices upfront followed by candi sugar, light malt, and light fruit. The finish was long, dry and peppery with just a touch of noticeable alcohol. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and high carbonation. The drinkability was very good. This is one of the best Tripels that I have ever tried and is highly recommended."
"D-Love this beer. Its a great tripel. Tastes amazing with great citrus and hopy notes. Would get this on a nice summer or fall evening!"
"Poured into my Tripel Karmeliet glass a golden yellow, with nice carbonation. Head is white and pillowy three fingers that sticks around a long time. Smell is fantastic. Spice, apple, pear, malt and a hint of alcohol prevail. The spice definitely has the edge here, w/ the fruit in the background. A magnificent smelling beer. I gotta say- I've had this beer many times, and for a Tripel, it doesn't get much better than this on taste. Everything seems to be in perfect harmony- it seems impossible to imagine anything different here. Mouthfeel is amazing. It's creamy, like a piece of sugary angel food cake w/ fluffy icing. The ABV is the only thing keeping me from drinking a bunch of these. They go down REALLY easy, although I always try to sip and enjoy these. Truly a world class beer."
"Drinkability: Good beer. I think the Tripel is well done and a definite inclusion in my rotation despite the steep price for a four pack. I would recommend that people drink this beer at least once to see what the fuss is about. Even though some people might not think much of this beer as special, I can definitely say that the Tripel has taken beer drinking in a whole new direction."
"Cheers!"
"D - The overall experience is bright, fresh and clean. This is an older bottle and I have had even more tasty, presumably fresher, examples in Belgium. One of my favorite beers because of its swirling, complex flavors that still maintain balance, brightness and drinkability."
"D- This is plain good stuff. Decent complexity in a pleasant, warming, but still easy drink. Overall, a very good beer and a fine example of the style, but not a standout beer as some say"
"Hands down one for the best tripels I've ever had. I'd like to see how it compares in a bottle as most of the more in-depth reviews seem to come from a bottle tasting."
"D - Slam dunk. This beer would be enjoyable in almost any situation. I could relax after a stressful day with it or kick a couple back on a nice evening."
"D: This is a beer to sniff, sip, and savor. One in any given session is plenty for me."
"A great example of the Belgian Tripel style. The 8% ABV allows you to drink more than one without feeling too buzzed. A great Belgian Tripel!"
"D: WOW! I guess that's the best (along with St. Bernardus Abt 12) beer I have ever had!"
"d - A very nice Belgian tripel. I thought this one smelled great and was very drinkable. Would love to have again sometime."
"D: Light beverage that goes down easily due to creamy body and refreshing smell and taste, the high ABV could get one in trouble with how fast this beer may be consumed!"
"Dangerously drinkable. To me, a good Tripel tempts you to gulp rather than sip even though you know better. THis one goes down very easy."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, looking forward to having it again soon!"
"Poured from a bottle, the beer has an orange-gold color, with a slim, white head that quickly fades to a sparse film. Lots of carbonation bubbles throughout the beer, lingering well into the drinking phase. The beer has aromas of butter, coriander, and citrus. The taste is largely riding on a sweet foundation, again with buttery notes, and some toffee, with the spices (coriander and nutmeg) balancing out, and allowing the slightest hint of lemon to fade in and out. The beer is creamy and light in mouth, and fades to a semisweet and smooth finish. There is a bit of a sweetness to the aftertaste, with none of the spice. Very pleasant and easy to drink, and the ABV doesn't impede or encroach on any of the flavors. Well balanced."
"a solid triple that I wish I could afford, a hard sell a 20$ a four pack when LFDM 6 for a 750ml. still even at the price its a must try"
"Overall: Great beer in my humble experience of Belgian imports. Thanks to my brother Ben for the Christmas present."
"Light body, very clean, creamy and smooth. Perfectly drinkable. Fruity and clean with the perfect carbonation."
"The CPJ"
"Served up, too cold, in a beautiful branded tulip - my nose was excitedly greeted by your typical clove & Belgian yeast triple-threat; highly drinkable, well executed with a high ABV and a satisfyingly charming old-world sensibility. It's a style I've recently really begun to enjoy and in collaboration with a nicely charred & quite tasty burger and some obligatory beer-battered fries it made for a perfect afternoon lunch."
"This will eternally have a place on my beer shelf. Multiple visits have yielded multiple interpretations. Looking forward to much more meetings."
"Drinkability - I am glad we went all over Gatineau to track this down, just upset i only bought one! Great beer with great flavours."
"Served from bottle into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Poured a hazy yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, banana, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, dark fruit, and slight alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly excellent brew. This was my first time trying this one and I can now see why it is listed in the current Top 100 list. Had a very nicely balanced flavor and great aroma here. Not much missing at all in either aspect. Really glad this one is readily available in my area (on tap even). An absolute must try!"
"Drink - Definitely one of the better beers I've ever had. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and it has terrific balance. However I'm not sure I could drink many of these in a night."
"D- man, i looked down after a few minutes and my beer was over half gone. this one basically drinks itself. im definitely picking up the gift set with the glass. check this one out. this is a seriously under appreciated beer that can stand up against any other beer of the style."
"What can I say? These beer is one of those rare ones that I can genuinely say that it is one of the best I've ever had. As someone prone to darker beers, I found this one to be surprisingly good. The appearance wasn't the common straight piss yellow color, but rather a cloudy, bright yellow. The taste wasn't bitter at all, and I found it quite friendly but different. I would strongly recommend this beer to anyone, and I look forward to the opportunity to try this beer again."
"Drinkability: This is one enjoyable brew."
"Bottom line: I'll drink this again."
"D: Super easy to drink as most belgians."
"Had this on tap at Burp Castle in New York City. I actually hadn't heard of this beer before, but I figure they have a good beer list there and I like tripels, so I'll just go for it. Pours a cloudy orange colour with tight, thin white head. Lacing around some of the glass. Smells of saison almost, with the Belgian yeast and some spices. Very dry flavour, not as sweet as many tripels. High carbonation level. Very enjoyable beer, I'd be glad to have this again."
"Notes: An unbelievably tasty beer. Seriously epic and decently priced."
"D: Dangerously drinkable because of how the alcohol plays into the taste and the light body. This beer will knock you out if you're not careful and take the 8.4% into account"
"Overall impression: champagne-like but surprisingly bland for the aroma and appearance."
"I recommend this over some other better known Belgium Trips... I won't mention any names."
"D: Taste and smell is very good....way too over the top with the carbonation. Less carbonation would make this an excellent beer."
"D: I bought this Tripel per a suggestion of a fellow beer geek who I randomly met @ Binny's in Buffalo Grove (n. burbs of Chicago). He said, ""you like Belgians and tripels, you need to try this one!"" This is quite good and worth trying."
"My favourite beer. I could sip it all day long."
"Overall, an very good example of Belgium's excellent breweries."
"I really liked this beer. A great example of the style. Looks just like it should, feels just like it should, easy drinking (despite its strength). Nose is grassy and floral, with some nice lemony notes. Spicy too. Refreshing, I liked it a lot. Flavor is more standard as far as tripels go. Nice combo of malts, yeast, and spices to give an overall great beer. Very clean and well-done."
"Drinkability is very good. It's got a sweet and tasty bouquet of scents and flavors, a crisp mouthfeel and just about no alcohol or bitterness in the taste, making it something that is easily and readily quaffable. I've yet to meet a tripel I haven't enjoyed, and this offering from Bosteels isn't changing that anytime soon."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how well the beer is blended. With such complex, and strong, competing flavors, it can be hard to find a nice balance. This, however, is not the case here. We are left with a final product that is immeasurably clean and delicate, with inseparable undertones which are robust and delicious."
"I've had Tripel Karmeliet several times, and it's been delicious each and every one of them. I don't know if it's the world's best Tripel, but it's a great example. There's really not any criticism to constructively dole out. Nothing needs to be changed. If you're looking for a great Tripel, look no further. This is definitely one of the best!"
"D: Goes down very smoothly. This isn't my favorite tripel on the planet, but it's a damn good one."
"D: Good. Nice beer, just wish the flavor pulled through more."
"Smooth, mellow, very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Drink- It's a very nice beer. Will def. have to find a bomber somewhere of this quality beer."
"Outstanding. Beware the 8.4% because this is highly drinkable. As good of a tripel as I've had."
"overall it deserved all that it deserves, really a great and light an highly drinkable beer."
"D - Decent drinakbility but either it's a way old keg, the tap lines need some cleaning, or it's just not the same as the bottle. Possible pour sanitation in the line I feel, but my friend likes it more than the bottle and stands by his pour. Hmm."
"Prickly but full mouthfeel."
"All in all a very tasty treat, easy to drink, or sip. I'll have another please."
"D: About as drinkable as you can get!"
"Interesting beer. Seems like a spicier and sweeter version of the Chimay White. I like it a lot. 2nd best Tripel I've had (next to of course Chimay White)"
"It's a bit of a different take on a tripel as far as the flavors are concerned. I'm a fan of it though. They work very well, and this was incredibly easy to drink."
"The palate opens with a pretty big fruity sweetness, pears and peaches being right in the forefront, along with a melange of light fruits. Cotton candy, a little citrus, some floral character and a little honey. Despite the sweetness, this is very light on the palate, crisply carbonated and rather refreshing. Some crystallized ginger is present too. The finish is rather spectacular. Long lasting with flavors of light fruits, a light hoppiness and a little sweetness. The only detraction is that there's a light splenda-like sweetness present. Excellent stuff, this is one of the better tripels there is."
"D Probably not the best example of a tripel, but good if you like Saisons. I would rather drink something else. 3 "
"Hands down the best Tripel I have had. Just a wonderful beer, and maybe the best example of the style. This is a must try."
"D: Lighter than most tripels and wonderfully easy to drink. Very balanced and easy to sip on. Not my favorite, but a great example of the style."
"Verdict: Very good, worth trying, but not elite."
"Very drinkable brew - was a little sweet but not overpowering for a tripel ."
"D - Not bad for being sweet."
"It was a dark golden-yellow. To me, this wasnt a beer, but more like a sweet wine wine. It did not taste like a tripel at all. Great stuff, one the best beers I've had to date. I can drink this all night."
"Pours a clear golden-yellow under a large, frothy snow white head. Bright, perfumy aromas of orange peel, lemon, subtle spices, honey, almost doughy yeast, and pale malt. More phenolic as time passes. Peppery, fruity flavors...spicy with a lemony tartness and honey-like sweetness. Medium bodied and creamy, though quite effervescent. A little splash of alcohol in the throat. Nice..."
"Overall this is a decent beer but I can't use any words better than that. There are a couple of off-flavors that bring down the overall package and the high ABV is too noticeable for the lighter flavor profile."
"D: I liked this beer I just think there are better examples out there by far. This is also a super expensive beer which also means it is not something I would grab normally."
"D: Very nice. I went in with no preconceived expectations, but if I had, they would have been exceeded, I am sure. I will be buying more, and this tripel is highly recommended. I could drink this beer every week."
"A bit banal compared to other Belgian tripels I have had, but still worth trying."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a big, frothy head. The smell is fragrant and flowery like cloves. The hops is very evident. The taste is a little more subtle than the smell, a slight banana and yeast on the back of the tongue with a sugarcane aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little heavy or thick and slightly sticky, but not like syrup. The alcohol is there, but it doesnt overwhelm this beer. A very pleasant beer that compares well to other tripels. I could drink this fairly regularly."
"D: A top notch tripel that ranks right up there with my favorite, St. Bernardus."
"The best part of drinking the beer is the mouthfeel. Medium bodied beer combined with very active and tight carbonation combines to create an exceptionally creamy beer. Really delicious beer that's smooth and easy to drink."
"D) Very good. Careful, strong stuff..."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with carbonation being high. Drinkability is good, it has some great flavors and was complex and balanced. A very good version of the style and a very good beer overall."
"one of my favorites! i recommened it!!!"
"D: This is a highly drinkable brew for the ABV and the style, not a strong note of booze to be found, even as the beer warms. This is an easy drinking beer, that is full bodied, with lighter notes as it goes down. The flavors have me coming back and really is a great example of the style."
"D: Really good. It is slightly sweeet, which is a drawback."
"The alcohol is noticeable through a warming effect, and somewhat in flavor, but this Tripel drinks quite nicely."
"Drinks: I often find that a drinking experience is improved when served in the most appropriate glassware, and it's hard to get more appropriate than the glass built and labeled for that specific beer. At 8.4 percent alcohol content, Tripel Karmeliet is a smooth, easy-drinking beverage. It paired incredibly well with my pear and walnut salad, and even better with balsamic."
"Purchased a single small bottle at Whole Foods for $4.49. Poured into my Tripel Karmeliet chalice; glad I finally had a chance to use it. Huge white head forms in the glass, all the way to the top. The body almost had a neon yellow color to it. In the glass made for this beer, the presentation is amazing. Smell has nice fruit notes to it, like bananas, and some cloves. Taste is also quite good. This beer has wonderful flavors of fresh apples and pears. There is also a musty and yeasty flavor undertone that I really enjoy in Belgian ales. The mouthfeel was fresh and crisp, though possibly just a hair thin. Very easy beer to drink, as it was smooth and light, and the abv hidden well under layers of flavor. A great tripel to try if you are a fan of the style."
"D- great for a triple, very well balanced and easy to drink for the style"
"MF/D: smooth throughout, a sessionable tripel, pleasing from the initial taste to the exhale."
"d - fairly drinkable for the higher abv, refreshing and the flavors are intresting, the heat takes away somewhat"
"The cloying nature of the bubblegum flavor eventually began to turn me off from this. Still, glad I tried it. Probably a 1/2 glass would be enough every now and again."
"D: extremely drinkable. The 8.4% is only noticeable after it warms slightly. One of my favorite tripels."
"D - Has become my new go to Belgian beer lately. Just a great beer to have as it seems to hit all the right strides for drinking several of them in one sitting."
"Overall, a very nice tripel. One I'd have again. Which is good, since I bought a metric buttload of 'em."
"I'm not too sure what I think of this beer, I feel like I'd may need to get La Fin de Monde from Unibroue and compare side to side to see if I just don't like tripels in general, because I remember liking that beer, but I was not a fan of this one."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Best before 15AK indicated on the back label. Pours a pale, orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity. Head was one inch, loose and bright white and quickly dissipates into a solid, sudsy band around the edges and a thin slick of foam. Nose reveals essence of tangerines, candi sugar and a faint herbal presence; perhaps cloves. Taste consistent with nose - perhaps a hint of syrup reminiscent of canned peaches in the mix, with just a kiss of hops to balance out the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a carbonation level that is pleasant and consistent from start to finish. This is, by far, the best tasting Tripel I have had the pleasure to try to date. Just a fabulous beer. My only regret is having not tried it sooner."
"Pours a brilliant golden yellow, with about a hand (yes, five fingers of head!) initially, settling down to a sudsy and soapy head. Chunky lace. Aroma is awesome, huge yeasty fruit esters (banana, peach, green apple?, nectarine), a bunch of spice and some alcohol clearly. Just what I want from a tripel. Taste follows the fruits found in the aroma, with a touch of Belgian candy. Spice makes itself known, but doesn't overpower. Alcohol slips in a touch at the end. Clean, smooth and medium-high carbonationl. Slick on the tongue and goes down way too easily. Impressive."
"Great flavours on that; warming and sweet and quintessentially Belgian. Just delicious."
"Wow, that is very tasty. I cant believe it has taken me so long to finally get to this beer. Freshness and the green bottle have scared me away multiple times. Yeast is really active in the flavor and throws off alot of cloves and melon flavors. Alcohol is there, but it seems more dialed down than in most tripels. Mouthfeel is very soft and creamy and the grain presence maintains its lightness. Finish is dry and has a bitter hop and alcohol kick. Highly carbonated, a bit too much for me. This is probably up there in my top 5 favorite tripels. Nice beer."
"D- Really nice tripel; well balanced and refreshing."
"D: One of the best tripels I have had. The alcohol is strong but still plays nice and enhances the lush, fruity flavor profile."
"I'll drink it any season of the year, though I still love Fin du Monde."
"Poured a nice straw color with a slight haze to it. The off white head was massive and pillowey. Aroma is spicey, earthy, yeasty and tropical with maybe the slightest skunk. Tastes similar to the smell but the banana yeast flavor is super strong. Alcohol is warming to the tum but not really detectable in the taste. A really nicely spiced tripel that towards the end starts to get a little cloying. Feel is slick but slightly thinner than medium. This is pretty drinkable."
"D: Pretty pleasant brew. The carbonation I felt was a bit to much, but besides that it was nice."
"Had this one many times. Clear yellow pour with a nice lasting head. Awesome nose, the belgian yeast profile is amazing. Alsomainly banana but a strong underscent of citrus specifically lemon both of which you find in the taste with an all-so pleasant alcohol sweetness and yeasty flavors. The kind of beer you don't want to share. The best tripel out there."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden amber color with nice cap of white head, good retention and lacing. Scent is light, made up mostly of floral and herbal notes, hints of banana, lemon, fresh baked bread and yeast. Taste slightly more aggressive than scent, good solid fresh baked bread backbone with the floral and herbal qualities mixed with a touch of lemon and bananan. Highly complex. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly dry. A very nice beer different from many in the style."
"After reviewing, I read the other reviews and think that the beer might vary mildly batch to batch, maybe it's the yeast. It doesn't seem like it's hit or miss...but hit or pretty good. If that makes sense."
"Medium-bodied with a good carbonation level. Very drinkable."
"Taste is sweet and fresh, lots of yeasty fruitiness. It's got a nice full mouthfeel with really drinkable. Alcohol comes out a bit more as it warms."
"This is the first of the style that I have roundly NOT enjoyed. Overall quite disappointing"
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprised, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how strong the ABV is."
"The color was a hazy straw blond, aided by the wheat and oats if I were taking a stab at it. There was a substantially striking plump white head. The aroma was fruity, slightly citrus like, with a tiny bit of spice and flowers. The flavors were nice with a reserved malt character, almost pasta like, along with citrus fruit and spice that strikes me a touch like lemon pepper with some nice hop bitter thrown in. The alcohol is wonderfully deceiving in this beer. Spritely, active carbonation and a medium body with a fairly dry finish."
"Pours a pale, creamy light golden with a decent-sized white head and some good lacing. Smell has some nose Belgian esters alongside some citrus. Taste is similar. Quite smooth and nothing terribly intriguing, but overall quite good. Medium body with some nice carbonation and a bit dry. Very well done. Overall, not nearly one of the best tripels that I've had, but still a solid offering."
"I didnt think this beer could come close to La Fin Du Monde, but it does!"
"Quite a complex ale, with so many flavours it's easy to dissect but hard to convey the full experience. Definitely one to try."
"Sampled this at the Atlantic City Brewfest not too long ago. Poured a golden-yellow hue, with a finger of bright white, good retention, and great lacing. Smelled of lemon, orange, sugar, coriander, clove, oak, banana, and peel. The taste was very balanced between all of the above flavors, with a surprisingly malty backbone midpalate, and a spicy dry citrus finish. Very carbonated, and a little on the thin side. No hint of the alcohol content makes this a dangerously drinkable triple."
"D: An excellent sipping beer with a lovely combination of tastes."
"All in all, I figure I just do not like the style. Everything I have tried for Tripels has disappointed me. I hated La Fin Du Monde which so many people love and has a high rating on BA. I have not found any Tripel that I actually enjoyed. So, this just not be my style. If you do not like Tripels than avoid. Otherwise, give this brew a chance for you."
"Beer is medium body with some forward and midpalate sweetness. Very nice overall. Finishes a little dry but not bad. Some sweet malt in the midpalate with some fruit esters. A very nice beer overall. A good tripel and I've had it a lot."
"My first triplel and still my favorite. Use the appropriate glassware and you will enjoy every aspect of this beer. The head is thick and has a complexity all it's own. You will pick up on banana and vanilla flavors along with spices that make this drink exceptionall. Great full body with a golden, slightly cloudy appearance. The combination of flavor is outstanding. The finish is spicy and smooth."
"Wow , what à brew , much better thn the bottel , awesomes"
"Bosteels Family Brouwerij, Buggenhout, Belgium--Tripel Karmeliet--2008 Corked Green 25.4 oz. Bottle. 8.00% ABV. 10 IBU's? (4.75 / 5.0) Belgian Ale--Blonde. Foamy white mild lace head. Fizzy clear bright thin peach gold color. Delicate wildflower mild fruit ester front. Fizzy creamy mildly tangy complex Barley Oat Wheat Bottle Conditioned mild sweet fruit spice rich body. Cloying mild clove refreshing end. No Belgian Yeast Ester. Sampled 8/23/2008. 1 @ $11.99."
"This is quite a good Tripel with fantastic traditional characteristics, quite tasty, and again a deceiving abv."
"Taste was dry and sweet, filled mouth up with bubbles, this was too carbonated. Too much stuff a standard American hophead won't really appreciate. Just a weird pharmacuetical grade astringency was what I took away from this."
"Creamy and fluffy on the tongue. The head feels like whipped topping! Alcohol, even while the beer is cold, cuts the tongue coating tastefully and leaves a very smooth warming all way down the pipe. This is way more drinkable than it should be, though a little more crispness to match that carbonation would have been nice. More please!"
"Sweet, but not overly, good balance."
"Not your run-of-the-mill tripel, I like the different fruit tastes, it's complex and changing the whole time. The booze taste could be toned down but wasn't a major deterrent."
"D- drinkability on high. perhaps a little too much so. and since i hate to recork this awesome brew, i've been forced to commit to it and a solid buzz shall follow. alcohol is deceptive and only shows itself as a soft flowery pineappleish haze that gets lost in the lilies. the pleasant flavor and insane body only beckon another filled glass in celebratory fashion, for today's arrival of the lil black puppy who at the moment, lies sleeping soundly at my feet. here's to poopin outside, cheers."
"Excellent Tripel albeit sweeter and less complex than other tripels, but truly a delicious and highly drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a complex and quite smooth tripel that I enjoyed drinking very much. It's up there with my all time favorites St. Bernardus Tripel and Koningshoven Tripel."
"Drinkability: Well, I really love this beer. I'm not blown away by the nose, but the flavor and mouthfeel of it is near perfection. Hell of a beer."
"Drinkability is good. While the alcohol has a slight burn on the nose, it's well-hidden in the taste."
"Drinkability: A really enjoyable beer that has some great flavor and drinks really well for 8.4% ABV. I can see myself enjoying a few of these in an evening, but I have a feeling the ABV would catch up with me eventually. Definitely recommend this one if you get the chance."
"Overall this is an excellent tripel, probably the best one I've ever had. It's not too sweet but stays within the style with sweet and tart flavors. A true classic tripel that deserves a top spot in the category. Well done, I will no doubt enjoy more!"
"Arrives a hazy golden orange, with a nice white head. Good carbonation. Aroma is bananas, cloves and that nice belgian yeast, but also a whiff of the alcohol. The taste is at first very sweet. Candies sugar and bananas. But then the alcohol kind of burns off the sweetness, making this a great sipper of a Tripel. I think this stands out among Tripels as a unique version. Very well crafted with the haet of the alcohol mellowing out the sweetness of the yeast."
"jd"
"D - Tastes great, pairs well with food, widely palatable; a very good beer, all things considered."
"The oats on the grain bill make for a thicker, smoother drink than most Tripels. The relative creaminess does right by the beer's sweetness. As far as Tripels go, this one has good drinkability. I think I'd still prefer a La Fin Du Monde over it, but you could drink a couple of these in the summertime and feel sated."
"Drinkability: I find this to be an above average tripel, but there are several others I prefer in the style. I would not turn this down, but also would probably not get this again."
"D-this is so sweet, it is tasty but just too sweet. the nose had a good balance that was missed on the taste. too much sugar; but hid the 8.4 alcohol."
"Summary - A pretty nice example of a Tripel."
"Peace out...."
"Attractive beer once poured. Beautiful head that settled and laced very well. Great hints of pepper and citrus that contrast nicely. I wish it was slightly less carbonated. I felt lik it thinned out the beer and lessened my enjoyment of it. I would have preferred a more robust mouthfeel. Other than that, truly enjoyed it. Yummy."
"Poured on-tap at the Pangea Cafe at just below room temp into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip. I haven't had this one before and haven't been drinking Belgian ales lately but decided to treat myself. Brilliantly clear, golden yellow in color and great head formation, retention, and lacing. Bananas, orange peel, and coriander on the nose and much the same on the palate. Not really complex in these aspects. What you see (smell, taste) is what you get which isn't exactly a bad thing but I thought if there was anything lacking it was in these areas. Just medium bodied but still almost syrupy in texture. I found it to be quite drinkable for a number of reasons: relatively low carbonation, the malt is very sweet but very light, the presence of alcohol is nearly undetectable, and the finish is surprisingly clean for a relatively heavy beer."
"This isn't a bad beer, but I really didn't enjoy the experience. I would rather call this a Strong Golden or Belgian Specialty. I'll stick with the classic tripels."
"My second favorite Tripel after La Fin du Monde."
"Superb."
"D - Great drinkability if it wasn't so high up in ABV. Then again, for a tripel, this really shouldn't be surprising. Not that that's a bad thing."
"(D)- A fantastic Tripel. It has everything one should expect from the style. My biggest problems with tripels have been over carbonation or being too spicy with clove or whatnot, however this one has everything in its place & is balanced wonderfully. A definitive example of the style, not to mention one of its best in my opinion."
"Another BIG tripel with plenty of character that is surprisingly easy to drink! No wonder it's rated by many as one of the best. I have to agree as it is my favourite tripel."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is great and the beer is crisp and refreshing."
"It was also very cool to hear how this beer came about from the Brewery Rep."
"Nice effervesence in the mouth. It is a great beer for one or two but I couldn't have a Karmaliet session."
"D= I was almost able to finish the whole bottle without feeling like, ""I can drink this whole bottle without sharing it."" The ABV is just on the border of, ""Don't try to drink this whole thing on your own!"" Otherwise, very drinkable."
"the ABV sneaks up on you since its so well blended, but i couldnt get tired of this taste, could have a few pints."
"I'm not too sure what I think of this beer, I feel like I'd need to revisit it a few times. My first impression is a good one, however. I'd love to come back to this one. I find the herbal quality to be super interesting, never having come across it before in a beer. Definitely not sessionable but I'm not having any trouble with this bottle. Out of Tripel Karmeliet and Duvel, I'd say it should be this one getting all the love. Much more interesting."
"Overall Impression: It was my 3rd beer of the night, and my favorite of the three. I had 3 of them - YUMMY!!!!"
"The mouthfeel is quite good, lots of body and a good carbonation; extremely drinkable."
"The high alcohol comes across quickly on the palate but then the malts and esters catch up, giving this an almost champagne dryness."
"D- excellent. So good. 4.5"
"One of the better triples."
"Shared a 75cl corker with my brother in law. Some serious head, took about a gazillion years to get it under control. A little more yellow in color than I expected in a tripel. Nice smell, a little fruity to my olfactory bulbs. Great tasting, hides the EtOH dangerously well, could see this one sneaking up on you. The real cool part about it is somebody gave it to me."
"D; The alcohol is evident, but not overpowering. Better to sip slowly and enjoy the ester flavors."
"Very crisp and scrubbing carbonation. I think it keeps the feel a lot lighter than what it would be otherwise. The three different grains, wheat, oats, and barley creates a smooth body. The 8.4% ABV is smooth and does not seem so high."
"D: pretty easy to enjoy at any point in the night. Or the day, for that matter! I really should drink this more often."
"The taste was so smooth and wonderful. It perfectly melded the malt and citrus taste together. I want to say it had a slight pear taste to it, but I'm horrible at picking out specific flavors. Either way, I greatly enjoyed it."
"D: Drinkability is good but not so good that it inspired any sort of creativity in my description here. Solid brew."
"D - Not bad. This is a proper, flavourful Belgian tripel, but I think Chimay White is more drinkable, if you're looking for something you could enjoy more of."
"This is my favorites of the belgain tripels I have tasted. Sweet and very balanced."
"D: Other than that up-front kick in the head, I could drink it forever and a day."
"D: This is probably more drinkable than alot of Tripels I've tried. It's easy on the palate and goes down smooth. Overall, a very nice beer."
"11.2 oz. slender Belgian bottle with 07H1 on the back label; brewed with barley, wheat and oats. The damn bottle volcanoed on me, but I still got a decent pour. The beer is bright gold, fairly clear, with two fingers of white head that clings, but contributes little lacing. Honey, spicy yeast and a dash of pilsner malt in the nose. A little sharp on the palate, but there are notes of orange, honey, alcohol, spicy yeast and a light, but rough-edged hop flavor on top of a light, creamy, highly-carbonated body that brings some warmth on the way down. Nice and drinkable, but this tripel could be a bit smoother."
"Drinkability- this beer is easily drinkable but just kind of bland and with so many other great belgian triples out there no reason to settle for just mediocre, again wont offend you in anyway but nothing you would come running back for"
"D - classic belgian sample. Tasty."
"This beer pours a clear gold with a beautiful Belgian-style head on top. Lot's of lovely frothy foam. Smell of sweet, citrus and jasmine tones. Also some smells of cardamom and coriander. Flavor is lightly sweet with lots of fruit and some honey. Which gives a great contrast with the spices! Very smooth, and bubbly with a dry finish. This is one of my favorites!"
"The beer poured a very clear, straw-yellow with a thin, white, creamy head into a chalice. The smell was of bubble gum, banana, cloves, with a slight floral undertone. The taste was the previously mentioned unmistakable Belgian yeast profile, with a slightly harsh hop bite at the finish. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with perfect carbonation and lacing down the glass. A very nice tripel, with the high ABV nicely masked - reminds me quite a bit of Brewer's Art Ozzy."
"I need to buy another one and review it - interrupted by family a bit and this beer was a little past the best by date."
"I have just checked and gave the St Bernardus tripel a lower score so may have to revisit that but this is so good a must have !!!"
"O:spicy and floral, very good, unique"
"D- Very impressive beer with quite the presentation. Looks lovely in a Belgian tulip glass."
"Notes: Good mix of sweet and creamy with some spice and alcohol to cut it. Really nice beer."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and finishes dry. I look forward to having another some day."
"This will not replace St. Bernardus Tripel as my favorite of the style but I am certainly glad I gave it a try."
"I would buy it again."
"D: A very nice Tripel indeed. I was through my little bottle in a flash. An excellent pickup."
"The mouthfeel is carbonated and luxurious. Very light leaving me wanting another drink. This beer goes down well. This experience would have been close to flawless if only I was enjoying this beer over a leg of lamb meal with roasted potatoes."
"D - A tasty Tripel and a great example of the style."
"A pleasant enough Tripel, the high booze quotient at least tempered by the various (ok, '3') malt inputs, as well as the particularly active yeast. Decent, but exhibiting perhaps a bit too much heat to be considered all that drinkable, though it will likely steel me for the stroll back to my hotel on a so-so Toronto mid-late winter evening."
"Drinkability- I like it."
"If you like tripels, you can't go wrong with this. Worth a try."
"A very appropriately thin body. Impressive considering the high abv. Bubbly and light, making this a very drinkable beer."
"Tripel Karmeliet is a slightly hazy and very sparkling pale yellow ale with a thick, fluffy head that has great retention and lacing. It has a doughy and fruity aroma with notes of banana, pear, apple, peach, cherry, nutmeg and clove. It's light bodied and very lively. It foams on the tongue. The finish is crisp and clean. It's perhaps a touch sweet with a barely detectable bitterness. It tastes very fruity-- almost cider-like. All of the fruit present in the aroma is in the flavor. There is perhaps some bret at the finish. This comes off as pretty light fare, but it's pretty complex. It's very refreshing. (I was shocked when I read the ABV later!)"
"750 ml. green corked bottle. Served in a chalice glass. Golden colour with a bit of haziness and quite a good head, that leaves a crown and lace. Malty aroma of fruits, honey, some spice, vanilla, orange peel. Sweet silky and liquor like flavour. Taste of honey, oranges, banana, maybe apricot, coriander... Both smell and taste have everything so subtle and integrated that is hard to tell exactly what anything is, and that can be good and bad at the same time. Great, really great stuff. Sweet!"
"I always come back to this beer... esp when I find it on tap in Colorado!"
"Appearance is the characteristic tripel golden. Nose is sun screen, hops, pears, raisins. Flavor adds more hoppiness and a hint of blueberries, ending with a dry, slightly bitter finish. Alcohol is reasonably well hidden. A delightful beer not unlike the Leffe Blonde."
"O: Excellent drinkability. A Belgian masterpiece. Mandatory to Belgian Ale lovers"
"Tasty and good. I do like a good tripel and this is one that goes down pretty easy."
"D- This style is not always up my alley, but this is a great representation of this style. Easy to drink and delicious. If you like belgians or trippels...most likely you have had this already...if not it is a must try."
"Has an excellent balance of fruit, sweetness and malt. Starts out sweet, but finishes dry. Very nice effort"
"the label says triple but my mouth says session."
"Great drinkability especially for a beer over 8%. Almost as quaffable as a saison and more complex. Awesome beer and one of my new favorites (I have many)."
"D: I don't know about this one... it's certainly a nice tripel, but it's not very complex or dynamic - you drink it, flavor hits the tongue, and it's gone - nothing really gives it much to get you interested in drinking a lot more."
"Creamy, spicy flavors are also quite fruity and even if the origin of these remains difficult to identify. It reveals, however, the apricot. The beer is made with barley, wheat and oats (each grain is taken once believed, once malted) and is very warm and contains little bitterness. The flavor is mild and sweet with a finish reminiscent of quinine. It is less sweet and more balanced than the pressure bottle and she appears much more refreshing, even if it is full of flavors. Complex beer."
"330mL bottle poured into a tulip glass. Clear copper color with a huge long-lasting white head. Sweet aroma of yeast and fruits. Complex malt flavors with more yeast, citrus, and spices. Sweeter than most tripels, but not too sweet. Alchohol isn't noticible at all. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Well balanced and very drinkable, this is one of my all-time favorites!"
"Beer pours golden with a huge white head and lots of bubbles. The aroma is a mix of Belgian wheat and fruit, very inviting. The flavor is very similar with lots of lemon and other citrus dominating. You also get the Belgian yeast and malt character you expect from a world-class tripel. The beer has a light mouthfeel and is very carbonated. Very refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a luscious and soft amount of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Aside from the initial overly-excited burst of efferevescence, the texture is soft and full with a mouth-filling presence that reaches all areas of the tasting spectrum. An absolute classic in the art of Belgian brewing, this is the one beer I will support and recommend to anyone looking for the best of the best."
"MK"
"Overall, I really like this beer. It is well down and I could easily drink more. The MF is amazing. Good drinkability as well."
"Drinkability: this is just one fantastic beer. Tripels are usually good at hiding their nuclear ABV and Tripel Karmeliet is no exception; throw in the amazing flavor and this is an experience I can't wait to repeat."
"This could possibly be the best example of a Belgian tripel that I have had the pleasure to enjoy. Very drinkable, even at 8+ abv."
"Sat aroung in the evening with friends sipping."
"Purchased a 750 ml bottle at Flannery's II in Oconomowoc, WI. Poured into my new Tripel Karmeliet goblet, this beer shows a golden straw body with an enormous, puffy white head. Aroma is of yeasty lemon peel and sparkling wine. Mouthfeel is effervescent and very carbonated. Spicy yeast esters are the initial flavors. Even with all the bubbles, the wheat and oats give it a smooth finish with a bit of alcohol warmth. This is good out of the bottle, but I think it's better on tap."
"Lots of personality, yet not at all overbearing. Among the best of the lighter Tripels."
"Overall a treat to embibe in. Strong and great as a night cap."
"Pours a cloudy, dark maize color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus, hops, spice, yeast sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Tripel. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, yeast, slight spice, slight hops, some sweet malt, alcohol, and slight pale malt. Overall, well blended, there's a good body, and nice aroma."
"Good Stuff."
"Cheers!"
"D - A solid tripel, good benchmark for the style and a pleasure to drink."
"drinkabilty. rather good"
"D= Pretty good. I think the large amount of bubbles in it kill it a bit so I had to let it sit out for quite a while."
"Strong presence of Belgian yeast throughout, but had a really nice, oaky finish that you get from an excellent chardonnay. Finishes like a crisp apple cider doughnut. Excellent and round. Really delicious."
"Overall, this is a very tasty tripel. Perhaps not my favorite tripel, but it's a very refreshing example of the style. Good, complex brew that I would highly recommend."
"Thanks to zorprime for this world-class bottle."
"D: a tad too strong and flowery to drink all night but a great beer to introduce some one to the style."
"Poured this beer from bottle into a chilled pint glass, poor presentation from a fine Steak house, but I did mention this to the bar maid who offered to correct it. Smell was not much to consider but there was a swirling of other smells in the restaurant, what I could make out of the smells were full of nice mellow fruits, apricots raisins. Color was dark golden with a wheat cloudiness to it that was inviting. Full fine head that was a slight eggshell off white but it faded right away and the lacing was ruined by the chilled glass. Beer was very drinkable with good carbonation and sweetness on the front of the tongue that was very pleasing. Beer was representative of the style and full of flavor."
"Definitely enjoyed this one, although there are better represenations of the style. Don't hesitate to buy it if you see one well preserved. Perhaps this one could use a bit more aging?"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow/gold, huge fluffy white head forms, nice lace, good retention. Smell is sweet, grainy, some orange, spices, wheat, little yeasty. Taste is sweet, orange and spice again, yeast, some alcohol, and a wheat dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. A decent tripel, but too sweet for me. I don't think it should be as high as it is, but enjoyable."
"Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. The initial appearance is beautiful but the carbonation seemed overdone at first glance...however the mouthfeel is not fizzy or in any way bothersome so turns out this wasn't an issue at all. Overall a great reprsentation of the style."
"D - Very drinkable and enjoyable. Could definitely drink more."
"Drinkability - The perfect tripel. Not too much bubbly, malty, slightly sweet with just the right amount of bitter, smooth with several distinctive flavours. A perfect beer for before, during and after meals - Magnificent!"
"This beer was pretty good. It reminded me very much of Leffe Blonde. It had a pretty good head and was light gold in color. It was a bit honey-sweet with hints of citrus at times. I would definitely try this again. I didn't drink it with food, so I'm curious to see how it would pair with a meal. Although something tells me it makes a better after-meal drink."
"This beer was great! The more styles I drink, the more beers I find that make me wonder how I ever lived without them. I will categorize this beer under ""Special Session."" It is definitely a sessionable beer (be easy though, it's 8.4ABV), but I think I'll save it up for those nice summer lobster dinners. This has the great taste and character of a wheat beer as it leaves the palate but it is not as heavy on the palate or too much of a bully in the taste department. I could really drink this year round because of it's subtle but fantastic taste. It has a very short, light and crisp finish, which I think, can allow it to be paired pretty well with light summer meals, as it is a very refreshing beer. This is white wines summer replacement!"
"Drinkability: Balanced, alcohol barely noticeable. Any price is a good price for this gem. But most important of all this a beer that is not only true to style but also transcends it. Unique."
"MF&D - the feel is perfect, what can I say. great amounts of small scale carbonation with a medium body. smooth, creamy, mouthcoating: this beer is the perfect embodiment of these characteristics. the carbonation goes down so well for its abundance, it is quite hard to believe."
"D: For 8+% ABV this beer is wonderfully easy to drink. Generally prefer doubles over triples so TK extra sweetness is a bonus to me, help cut through the dry herbal notes that dominate other triples."
"Sweet, fruity and somewhat simple in flavor though surely not cloying in its sweetness. Flavor, like the nose, is simple and straightforward though quite pleasant. Offers a moderate feel and a light sweetness that masks the ABV quite well and, along with the general 'lightness' of the beer, affords an impressive drinkability. Again, improves with exposure. A bit unique but quite nice. I'd warm this beer up to 55 degrees or so prior to opening, and pouring very carefully at that point."
"Nice easy drinking brew, I like it."
"D: Very smooth and complex definitely need to taste more than one. You can tell the evolution between the two."
"Wow a gentle pour of this beer produces a healthy rising two finger head which is a pale see thru tawny yellow colour with really beautiful carbonation with the head slowly slumping to a big ball of froth in the middle with heaps of lacing,the aromas are really pleasant notes of bananna,yeasty bread,white grapes and some peaches soaked in alcohol,it has a nice weighty mouthfeel with a nice taste of apples first then some yeasty malt notes which finishes with a subtle stonefruity finish and only a touch of alcohol is present on first taste but after that not really noticeable at all quite an easy drinking Tripel that could drink abit of."
"D: Well, to be honest, I never expected that I would like a tripel this much and I'm even more surprised by my own rating. Should maybe expand my tripel tasting."
"Full mouthfeel with a strong carbonation which makes the beer unbalanced."
"Wow! I was not expecting this beer to be this exceptional. I'll definitely be back for more."
"D: A little sweet to drink a lot of, and a little strong, but still a very tasty beer, if this were available in a party setting, I could probably drink this all night, which would be a waste of a very fine beer. Highly recommended."
"I have to say I just had a bottle of it and it wasn't nearly as good. It has a bit of a metallic taste to it. I haven't yet figured out the reason for this ""off"" taste in beer, but it's annoying to get a beer that I know is really good, with ""off"" tastes..."
"I don't think this is my new favorite Tripel, but it's very good."
"M/D: Slightly syrupy but still light, wispy but abundant carbonation. This beer slips its way over your pallet effortlessly. This is one of my favorite tripels, and I could definitely have a few."
"Great drinkability. A real asskicker in that you can down gallons of this stuff and not realize it packs an 8.4% wallop. One of my perennial favorites. Cheers to Belgian Triples and Cheers to TAPS."
"Notes: This is an outstanding example of the style and a very satisfying beer."
"Overall, one of the better tripels I have yet to sample."
"Pours straw yellow with a thick foamy head that dissipates pretty quickly. Well carbonated. Nose is quite strong, lots of alcohols and sweetness going on. Taste is pretty funky, like a mix of whiskey and beer. Minimal body but alcohols dominate with a sickly sweetness. Not anywhere near my favorite Tripel, but I'd try it again elsewhere to confirm."
"D-Very enjoyable, would buy this again.This is a complex tripel with a lot going on that I would very much like to re-evaluate in the future."
"D: Plenty drinkable. Would be a great intro beer for BMC to imports/craft."
"when it comes to the alcohol. Nice with a meal or as a treat alone."
"Pours golden with quite possibly the biggest head I've seen. Very bubbly. Strong aroma of yeast, malts, citrus. Flavor of orange peel, malt, and spice. Nicely balanced and a good mouth feel. Finish remains balanced between sweet and bitter. Very nice beer overall. I;m far from experienced in Belgian tripels but this gives reason to try a few more."
"Karmeliet came to me in a tulip glass with not much in terms of head. A small white cap barely covered the surface. Small streaks of lace. The liquid is light brown/bronze in color. The smell is that of a refined triple, alot of fruits and dark sugars. Candi with bubblegum as well. Sweet but not a sweet mess. The taste is of the same ilk with dark fruits guided by a backdrop of candi sweetness, residual sugars. Getting some banana plus spices as well. Hops don't even try to make a dent. The high ABV also does not come into play. The feel was great with a above medium smoothness with perfect carbonation, not rough at all, goes down with ease. I could have drank another. I will be visiting this in the future again."
"The tatse is surpisingly sweet with notes of fruit and hops."
"A classic among Tripels, this will be my first time trying this beer out of the bottle. Poured rigorously, with some of the sediment added for extra flavor. Appearance was a murky orange, with not as much heading as when served on tap. Big nose of peppery alcohol, peaches, pears, bread and more fruit. Some musty medicinal flavors come through, with some hop and grain bite, still with plenty of fruit to go around. Prickly carbonation makes it rather refreshing for a beer of this weight. Drinking this one is easy. This is one of the best Tripels out there IMO...possibly my favorite example of the style. I suggest putting this up against some kind of creamy cheese. Humboldt Fog, as usual did not fail to make a lovely accompaniment. Cheers"
"Pours a cloudy gold color with a foamy 2 finger head with poor retention. The aroma is not very strong, smell is assorted fruit and cloves. The taste is sweet with phenols present. This beer is highly carbonated and medium bodied. A nicely drinkable beer. The flavor is better than expected given that the aroma was not very strong. The alcohol is also well hidden. I would not have guessed that the alcohol was as high as 8.4 %."
"I resolve that this particular batch of beer was left in the fermenter too long... and I intend to re-review at some point, given the high ratings from other BAs"
"Another sublime Tripel, right up there with St. Bernardus Tripel and La Fin du Monde in my book."
"HIGH DRINKABILITY"
"D: Very drinkable. My only complaint is that it wasn't what I expected..if that can be a complaint. Definitely would recommend to others, especially for those looking for a summery belgian ale with some kick."
"A beer to try if you like Belgians particularly tripels."
"Drinkability: Awesome triple. A new staple for my collection"
"D - very enjoyable. The taste and mouthfeel are great."
"Drinkability: Well, I made it through the whole 25.4 oz bottle.... that's all I would ever want. Typical for a big beer like this.... at 8.4% abv."
"Oh my. I've had a number of chances to try this beer, but it wasn't until a late-night run at Total Wine last night which I decided to buy it. the wait is no more, and I am gald to have sampled it, and I'm happier to report I dig it."
"OVERALL: Great nose and taste, but the mouth-feel was very difficult for me. If you like thin airy beer, such as Duvel, the you'll love this triple. A couple years may have helped the taste mature, but didn't help the look or mellow out the carbonation. A tasty treat, but not one I'd want to re-visit any time soon. On the other hand, if I can find a fresh bottle sometime in the future, I'll definitely give 'er another go."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and it offers just about everything I want in a Tripel, feeling like a middle ground between the zing/yeastiness/citrus of La Fin Du Monde and the softness/floral complexity of Westmalle."
"Drink - absolutely perfect, would enjoy this all night if possible."
"Overall, this is very easy to drink. A knockout, and a huge surprise for those who expect a chestnut brown dark fruit bomb from their Belgian tripels. A great surprise and a terrific find for me -- so glad I grabbed a bottle. At $5.80 per, not exactly a 6 pack I'd seek, but this will be a regular treat for me. Drink this now."
"Drinkability- Great could drink this all night or until I fell over."
"Notes: The bottle says that this is a ""true 3 grain beer", and I believe it. The sweet, malty deliciousness sets the perfect backdrop for the precise bursts of flavorful fruit, and the explosive nature of the spices. Every sip leaves an aftertaste that makes me lust for another. I'm not sure how this could possible be any better! I've had some really great tripels, but this is an easy call...Tripel Karmeliet is my favorite one of all. As a matter of fact, this is one of my favorite beers, period!"
"Could definately drink more than one glass of this, and I did!"
"M:"
"Poured with a fairly large, white head. Dark yellow, hazy body with very good lacing. Very nice aroma - average yeast, with hints of various fruits (definitely some banana in there). On the palate, the body feels medium-full, with a thin-yet-slick texture and lively carbonation and a nice, even finish. Great flavor, lightly acidic and bitter, but with the fruit and yeast present as well, and a good duration after you've finished sipping it. A great tripel that will always remind me of Belgium (it was the first beer I tried there)... very glad it's available in North America."
"Overall, if you love Vitus, you'll love this: a bit stronger, a bit funkier, but very wheaty and bready. Mmmm. I want some more!"
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a thick white white head. (A little too clear and yellow IMO.) Nose is a lot of grains with a defined sweet tone. Flavor brings the sweet as well in a consistent and smooth delivery. Spices are in there as well as a minor amount of dough. Feel has a pretty vibrant carbonation. Liquid is smooth. A new classic and a must try. Could also be a good gateway beer for those about to dip their toe into the Belgians."
"Drinkability: Nice sipper, and the alcohol is not very apparent. While this was very nice, I personally prefer a Tripel with a little more hop bite."
"A nice tripel. Great beer and glad I have access on a regular basis to it."
"Drinkability - Very high drinkability, this is my favorite Belgian Tripel. Never disappointing and always delicious. No strong alcohol taste for a beer with this ABV."
"D: I had a good amount of this stuff while I was in Belgium due to the widespread availability. I remember it being more heavy and reminiscent of Leffe there, with the yeast funk taste completely absent. Now that I've had a bottle in the states, I'm not sure I'll want another one. There's nothing really special to distinguish this from a typical blonde other than its slight sweetness."
"M/D - smooth going down but a little over carbonated for my tastes. Definitely a good beer that i could drink a couple of but at near 8.5% it will catch up to you."
"This one is in my top 10 of beers,a strong and honest beer to be drunk slowly to give you the time to appreciate its greatness."
"D- Had no trouble finishing the bottle- would go nicely with some earthy cheese or perhaps beef."
"Just a great beer."
"Drinkable? Well it is certainly satisfying on this cool almost summer rainy afternoon. The hint of warming alcohol is much more welcome than it would be on a hot day. This is damn tasty stuff, and i would certianly recommend it to any fan of tripels, belgians, or a newbie looking to expand their horizons. Thanks again Mark!"
"Drinkability is only average. I was expecting more from the brewers of DeuS. To me, this tastes like a beginner Belgian strong ale, though I do see many reviewers who would disagree with me."
"Pours a light golden, Huge head dissipates to a 1/8 "" film with a bit of lacing. Aroma of fresh honey and raw fruit (pear and apricot). Light but full flavored (hints of fresh grain, dough and earthy hop bite). Estery and quite effervencent. Very drinkable, could be a dangerous one on a hot summer day."
"Will go back for more after getting through Brooklyn's Local 1 & 2."
"Real smooth, almost too much so. Again, I like the ones that stain the palette and like to stick around."
"D- ok booze takes away form the drinkability"
"D: Pretty tasty, but nothing special. Not as cloying or sugary as some in its style."
"I could drink this all night long, this beer is really much more than the scores do it justice. I highly recommend it."
"Overall good tasting beer but mouth feel could improve refreshing and light."
"D - A nice try. Like it!"
"This beer surprised me positively. It's quite different from other belgian tripels I've had so far, but very high class."
"Overall, a very good beer. I will have to look for this one again."
"The wheat put a spin on things, but otherwise this is just a typical belgian tripel, albeit quite a tasty one...."
"D - I hate that most Belgian beers are packaged in 750ml bottles because I often don't want to drink that much of such intensely flavored beers. Karmeliet however is outstanding, and I will gladly finish the last 1/3 of this bottle. Phenomenal stuff. The alcohol is detectable in flavor only rather than a burn on the throat. Carbonation is near perfect allowing for a sense of quaffability. Damn. I really don't know what else to say about this beer except that, after nearly 600 brews, this is one of the best things I have ever tasted."
"Taste: Yeasty, like many tripels. Very fruity, as well."
"Overall, a great beer. I would definitely drink this again. I've also had this beer draft, and it definitely kicked all of its complexities into overdrive. So if you have the opportunity, I'd absolutely recommend trying it."
"bottle from The Caboose, Ashland, Virginia"
"D: It's a pretty good tripel, but none of the flavors blew me away or made it stand out."
"This is an enjoyable beer: definitely a Belgian, but missing those yeasts that make a Tripel a Tripel. Nevertheless, I think it is still worth giving a shot for those who enjoy Belgian ales, or those who maybe find more typical Tripels a bit difficult."
"The not-inconsequential abv was well hidden too, but not to such an extent that I was unaware that my beverage was of the alcoholic variety."
"Glad to have finally tried it, rather go local (Schlafly) with my next tripel."
"This is a very nice, uncomplicated, easy to appreciate Belgian tripel. The relatively low alcohol makes it all the more drinkable and enjoyable. Not bad at all..."
"Drinkability: I can't think of a more drinkable tripel. Finished one 75cl and tempted to open another."
"Taste is good, solid belgian blond, off dry, not sweet really which is nice."
"T: A really easy, tasty flavor. Not over the top, but still a fulfilling experience. Comes in strong up front with spicy, earthy grain and hay. A slight peppery undertone carries through until it finishes a bit sweeter with a touch of caramel in the back of the palate."
"Very drinkable. Probably one of the better tripels."
"Drinkability: The carbonation factor in this one makes it a sipper."
"Very nice beer. Look for it."
"Pretty good brew. Damn excellent for the price (I tried, half heartedly to correct the clerk, but she insisted $1.79!). I won't be getting that deal again but I'll certainly consider picking another one up. If I don't find an American brew to fill the niche."
"Smooth warm caramel flavor, sweet bread, vanilla finishes crisp and dries out. Very complex, with tropical fruits (pineapple?), earthy spicy hops, and bready yeast all playing subtly in harmony. Dangerously drinkable for 8.4%. I could drink this alll day."
"D - The carbonation adds to the drinkability...this one is highly drinkable since it's bubbly and you can not taste the alcohol...sweet but not too sweet"
"A strong beer that would go well with some taste offensive foods like those cheeses everyone talks about."
"Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a huge head. This was super carbonated. Aromas were yeasty, spicy, and hoppy with a sweet malt. Very tasty, started out with yeast, coriander spiciness and then finished with a warm alcohol flavor. The flavors ended abruptly and left an alcohol warmth and slight spiciness. As I was drinking this, I noticed that the aromas and flavor work together, almost fine tuned. I got the feeling that a lot of work went into the flavors, aromas, and body of this beer."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a clean golden color with a robust white head that fizzled down to a nice cap. The aroma is fruity with banana, citrus, some yeast, and even a hint of alcohol. The taste is sharp with a nice fruity taste highlighting orange, lemon, and banana. There is a strong carbonation with small bubble that help the taste explode in your month. This seems to be a brew that stands the test of time! Definitely worth a try!"
"D 4.0 - A very drinkable Tripel. This was my first time enjoying this brew it is was nice."
"Score yet another for the Belgians. They sure can brew it."
"Overall this is a very refreshing trippel that gives no hint of the 8% ABV. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall: The mouth feel on the beer is some carbonation and slightly creamy. The body is medium to medium full. The finish on the beer is bitter but clean. This is one of the better triples that I have tried. There is a nice marriage between the spice malt and hops. Well made and very tasty. Although disappointed in the fact, that the head retention was lack luster."
"Overall: I am not sure I would drink this one out of a 750ml again. It warmed to probably 60-65 degrees by the time I was able to finish it, and while tripels are easier to drink up to higher temperatures than some other styles it was over 80 degrees last night and I guess I was looking for something a little more refreshing. If I had the opportunity to share this with a friend next time or found a smaller bottle I would probably seek it out again."
"It was never going to be my favourite Tripel, but I warmed to it pretty quick. Good stuff."
"Feel and Drinkability: I can't see how this could possibly get any better in the mouth. Its crisp with carbonation that really does the job for this one, at first it seems to scrub the palate, then it fades to a delicate feel and then is gone altogether leaving the palate with a long lasting aftertaste. I can't get over the similarities between this and a wit....Body is medium-light on the palate and is much more delicate than the Feuillien. For a beer that brags about being for connissours and gourmet taste the Feuillien sure lets down. This is a beer that I'll be drinking again and soon. If you've not tried it definitely give it a go. This is a great tripel that impresses. Now I've got some good beer to drink."
"Very good beer, I don't think its as good as Delirium Tremens, but I think its up there with it."
"This is what craft beer is about."
"on tap from rattle and Hum NY . a slightly murky pale light yellow. Good carbonation but unimpressive head and lacing. Very little observable scent. creamy taste of banana, on the sweet side. Definitely the type of beer that can sneak up on you with its smoothness and high alcohol content. Very drinkable and pleasant for a high alcohol beer."
"Good, but certainly not great. I've heard that the version in the green bottle is tightly filtered and lacks the character of the brown bottling. I've never tried the brown bottles, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is true. There is hardly any sediment in this."
"enjoyed with dinner, and the entire 30+ minutes i savored it, it lost nothing from first to last drink."
"Very good drinking for a big flavorful beer."
"I really like this one. Costs a bit, but want to keep a few around (if I can keep from drinking them) to introduce friends to the easier side of the wonderful world of Belgian Beer."
"I like the fact that this is brewed by female ""monks."""
"This is a good beer not my favoate trip but nice to drink"
"The mouthfeel is easy and balanced, the abv does not hit your palate too hard, so remember to sip this one."
"D: Easy to drink, but stay away from having too many."
"drinkability: good"
"Beautiful golden hue, moderate to deep. Aroma is strong of banana, light on the vanilla and a hint of lemon. The smell is a preview of the taste, and it gives way to a banana bread type of flavor and lemon on the end. This beer is huge on mouthfeel, touching on liquid bread, attributable to the 3 grain recipe (which inspired my next homebrew containing 3 grains). Drinkability gets high marks, it doesn't hit me like an 8% beer should. The high alcohol doesn't linger too long and just makes for a sooner second sip."
"This is now a favorite, and despite the steep price tag, I have a feeling my local liquor shop will be ordering extra cases just for me."
"One of my top six active bottled beers for style."
"Overall: I've been looking forward to this particular beer for a long time and I must say I'm a little let down. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I will buy another bottle sometime... Maybe I'll think differently next time."
"this a triple that i would feel pretty spoiled having on a regular basis."
"mouth is clean and crisp, incredibly drinkable. Truly a contender on my favorite representation of this style."
"D: A nice sipper... pleasantly surprised by this one. The flavour may have come across as a touch thin, but it's still a very solid beer. I will happily enjoy the other bottles from this pack and will perhaps look forward to more."
"not horrible, but maybe it's just me. i've realized over the past half year or so that i just don't like all the medicinal phenols in many of the classic belgian tripels and blondes. not all of them, of course, since for example achel blond and st. bernadus tripel are amongst my favorite tripels. anyway, i kind of regret getting a whole case of these here in beijing, when i could have gotten something else (like more achel!)"
"Absolutely awesome. I had this as a recommendation from a friend who described it as an ""easy"" Belgian. Saw it was on draught at dinner last night so I ordered it. It was served in a snifter and had a beautiful golden appearance. There was a generous amount of lacing on this one that slowly subsided. The smell was a great balance of fruits and sweetness. Upon drinking, mouthfeel was lots of carbonation but went down smooth. Despite the 8% alcohol content, I noticed no taste of alcohol but started to feel it rather quickly. Great beer!"
"D= A great example of a moderate strength tripel with a sweeter flavor profile. For me the complexity was just average, but the flavors present were all excellent and well balanced, making this one very drinkable beer. I almost always have two in me before I know it!"
"Pours a semi-hazed golden color, with an epic soapy/foamy white head, threatens to spill over the top of the glass, fades into a 1/4"" layer of foam on the beer, some sticky lacing in the glass, and a constant flurry of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Some apple on the nose, pear, maybe a faint vanilla aroma, and yeast. Explosively fruity flavors, pineapple, some banana, vanilla bean....this is just a beautiful beer. Very active carbonation = very refreshing = big-time drinkability. Where has this beer been hiding my whole life?"
"Drinkability: This tripel is crisp, light, and smooth. There is not much more you could ask for in an easy-drinking tripel."
"Another factor assisting in moderating the sweetness is Tripel Karmeliet's exceptionally light, quaffable body. Had a drink with the super-sweet profile of this one presented itself as heavy or syrupy, the scales might certainly have tipped into the land of cloying, but as is, I find the brew exceptionally light and refreshing with a bonus tummy-warming wrought of otherwise totally-invisible alcohol."
"Pours a cloudy orange-yellow colored body, with a small head, and is diminishing. Has an aroma of orange, and some spiciness. Has an odd spice taste to it, some orange, and a fizzy mouthfeel. Kind of flat."
"Its pretty amazing. Deserves every bit of this rating."
"This is an extremely good beer. This is everything triple should be. Big and complex, but extremely well balanced. Absolute joy to drink."
"D - Great beer, excellent example of a triple."
"A great way to start an evening."
"I heard a lot of good things about this tripel before I tried it, and can easily say they were all true. Pours clear gold with a very light head. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is sweet and fruity, with scents of straw and sugar. The taste is so clean and light, it almost feels like it does not touch your tongue. Sweet and slightly fruity that turns to citrus and spice. A near perfect beer."
"Definitely one of the best Tripels I've had (and beers for that matter). It is a perfect balance of sweet, citrusy malts and peppery hops. I'll definitely be picking up another bottle of this, and I'm eager to try Kwak as well. Outstanding brew."
"Pours a cloudy yellowish/orange color with a massive frothy off-white head that settles into a lacing that lingers throughout. . Aroma of crisp light fruit, earthy hops and alcohol. Slightly sweet, with a crisp golden flavor to it. Hints of apple, pear, hops and alcohol. Very tasty!"
"Reviewed on 2/29/08. Bottle. Pours a murky yellow with a fairly sizeable white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, some light fruits (apple, pear, citrus). Tastes of Belgian yeast, spices, and wheat. Strong mouthfeel, but I felt that the taste was one dimensional. I didn't really care for this one. 7/3/6/4/15 (3.5/5)"
"Pours a darkish gold mixed with amber tints and a two-finger head that receeds quickly but leaves a thin lace ring. Has a sweet malt smell, like caramel or honey, and has a light, springy hop aroma. Not full-bodied overbearing on fruits like other Belgian triples, this beer maintains a lighter edge while still packing a dark fruit, tropical fruit taste and having a smoothness to it that is almost slick. Very mild spices and pepper in an otherwise smooth ""fruit"" beer. ABV hidden well. This is one I definitely recommend, and I could've had it all day if it weren't the alcohol content knocking me down."
"This is a very good beer. I would say the style should be Flanders Red but the name might get non-sour beer lovers to give it a try. It pours golden and clear. The head is a silky white. It looks like a tripel but the taste of tart citrus is unmistakable. It is not too sour/tart but just enough to add character. This is a must find and ust drink."
"Have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Am going to have to scramble down tomorrow and grab a couple more bottles."
"Very enjoyable, my favorite Tripel thus far."
"Another beautifully presented beer at the Trappist. They seem to have the correct brewer's glass for every single beer. The Karmeliet glass is one of the better ones I've seen, and the beer looked great in it. Bright, hazy, golden color with thick white head that took a while to settle down. One of the best beer presentations I've ever seen. Smells and tastes sweet, spicy, citrusy, and refreshing. I could have drank this all day, but there were too many other good things to try out at the Trappist."
" ~ This is a very enjoyable brew. It offers excellence from the ""head"" to the head. Which I might add, still lingers at the top of this tripel almost 15 minutes later."
"Good carbonation, with some fruity sweetness, spice, and alcohol. I wish this one was a bit weaker in the abv, wouldve enjoyed it better. Crisp vineous and champagne like finish, dry. This was a really enjoyable and interesting beer. I'd recommend anyone try it if you see it."
"Answer: YESSS!!!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down real easy, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent higher-gravity and flavorful Belgian to drink for a long time."
"Absolutely delicious and easily quaffable for a beer of this magnitude... well done."
"I would say this is a drinkable beer and could have a couple of these, but I would rather prefer other tripels."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. There are few Belgian beers crisper and livelier than this one."
"In writing all this - I Loved it though!!! definately have it again."
"d: Every last detail is attended to, a well executed tripel. Tripel Karmeliet is a quintessential version of the style. Why did it take so damn long for me to try this? I'm putting this one on the top of the list of my favorite tripels. A must try for Belgian beer fans."
"D: Very nice, highly recommended."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. I would certainly buy it again."
"D- I could easily drink this again, but the fact is that there are better tripels out there I would partake in prior to this one."
"D- This as of yet (September 17, 2008) is the best beer I have ever drank. If you like tripels, and you like belgian ales, you will find it unbeatable."
"D: this was a very enjoyable tripel for me. Definitely can feel the impact as I make my way through the bottle."
"D - If socially acceptable, I would drink this beer all day. Hell, it's only 9am, I'm off today and there's another in my fridge... gotta run!"
"Enjoy and Savor this one!"
"This is quite complex and could be heavy from alcohol and sweetness if the citrus notes didn't help it drink so clean. There's some heft to this but it's extremely enjoyable in true moderation."
"A pretty good tripel I say, very tasty. Not all over the place like some wilder Belgians, this one's more tame."
"Sampled from a big 750 ml corked bottle. Pours a golden color, pretty clear not as hazy as I was expecting. Nice frothy head which leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is bananas, vanilla and maybe a little grassy or hay-like which remains nice even after the bottle breathes a while. Smooth, pretty easy drinking but with a full enough mouthfeel. The flavor is much of the same: citrus, banana, vanilla with a little bit of a tangy tart alcohol presence. Somewhat spicy flavors which balances it nicely. Flavor doesn't necessarily jump out at you but it's very good."
"Gorgeous gold tint, with a feisty white head that seemed to last. An enticing spicy fragrance augmented by distinct pear and clove. The flavor told a delicious story, beginning with a quick bite of spice, followed by a smooth fruity plateau, and ending with a soothingly warm finish. Significant carbonation, medium-bodied, perfect balance. As far as tripels go, this is my current favorite, and I will drink it every chance I get. I compared it to the Allagash and found Karmeliet to be superior in its complexity, taste and character."
"Kept hearing about Karmeliet being so different. I finally give it a whirl, and it is certainly distinct... I hope you like pepper in your tripel. This is a good beer, and I'm certainly not put off by it's agressiveness, but I'm having a hard time deciding if it is something I really like or not."
"Pours a light gold in color with a huge two inch frothy head. It was served in a Tripel Karmeliet glass as well. Smell is citrus and spice. Taste is light fruit, some spice and lemon zest. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is an absolutely delicious tripel."
"Very tasty tripel. I'd happily consume several, but I would no doubt be paying for it later. Definitely one I'll be having again."
"T/M/D - slightly carbonated, full and chewy with a sweet, sugary finish. Many beers of the style are reminiscent of the taste of Karmeliet, but this remains one of my favorites (especially since it isn't too hard to find). Delicious and well worth a try if you've never enjoyed one!"
"A good tripel here."
"D= very drinkable for a few but the 8% ABV might make it a waste or an unpleasant experience with more at one setting."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, but is also great for just sipping."
"Mouthfeel is not overly bubbly even though this stuff bubbles forever. Very true to what I call a triple. Clean and refreshing. This is one of the best. Very drinkable. A fine beer."
"750 ml corked bottle. into chalice. Nice looking hazy wheat golden ale, with a lovelly large thick and bubbly white head. Fantastic nose on this beer. all the usual Belgian style yeast, malts and spices but ampliphied. Very fruity, pink apples, red plums come to mind. All the flavours mentioned in the nose are present a little banana and a tinge of alcohol added in the end. Fantastic palate, great mouthfeel, smooth silky yet carbonated very well. Very good beer. Will have again."
"drinkability - This is a strong bee, nice sipper. Would buy again. Enjoy!"
"One of the best tripels I have had. A world classic that is a must buy."
"MF&D - Good example of this style, but due to the spicy flavor and high ABV, I doubt I would session this one."
"D: very fizzy so will fill (bloat) you quickly. good to above average taste for a tripel. exemplary of the style. would definitely drink again, and could maybe drink several in a sitting."
"D - This is a very nice tripel. I had been looking for it and finally found one. I really enjoyed it."
"This is a very tasty brew. Flavor is unified, offering a depth of interesting balanced flavor. The high ABV is well concealed behind the sweet fruity aspect. I will get this one again."
"Easy to drink and tasty, easy to see why this could be the benchmark for Belgian Tripels."
"overall, one of my favorite triples yet. Just awesome yeast character and beautiful texture. The balance is really there with this one. I would drink several if: A- I could afford them, B- I thought I'd be standing when finished. Outstanding"
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange color with a nice cap and plenty of carbonation bubbles racing to the the top. The smell is of stale grassy hops, funky belgian yeast, some candi sugar, white pepper and very light corriander and some honey suckel. The taste is quite similar to the aroma. A nice floral honey suckel sweetness, earthy/peppery spice, tropical fruit flavors, delicate pale malt presence. Maybe not quite as deep as the top notch tripels but the flavors are spot on with this one. The feel is fairly light with perfect carbonation; finishes sweet but on par with the style, not cloying. A very good text book tripel, serves well as the general example of the style."
"Really wine-like. Interesting color change over time from peach to straw."
"Maybe a bad bottle."
"A great beer. Will be buying it in the future."
"Overall, Karmeliet is very special beer. Its three different malts give the beer a distinct character. The sweetness of the malts is well counter pointed by the crispness of the flavour. It is very refreshing and quite dangerous, as you almost cannot feel the high alcohol presence."
"Pours orange gold with a substantial white head. Funk dominates the aroma, but there are detectable notes of caramel and citrus. Very heavy carbonated. Delicious. Starts out with notes of sweet malts and funk, very bready tand spicy hrough the middle, with a spice finish. An excellent beer."
"By the way....this was a 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounce green bottle. Nice art on it, but seriously...as cool as it may look...who cares, right? Very good Tripel! One of these will be more than enough for you and a friend for an evening;) Cheers!"
"""I'm looking for Belgians."" I say to Jeff at Charley's and he responds with this - his ""favourite beer."" Appearance can mean a lot, and this arrives in its own elaborate engraved glass like something out of a monastery. It pours quite similar to the Duvel, big dense fine head that lingers a lot. A fine, pale yellow, a hint of haze. Splendid phenolic slightly malty aroma invites you in. On the palate a complex mix of yeasty, earthy mineral components, slight caramel sweetness. Lingering finish that you remember hours later. Close to the Duvel in my book."
"Finishes lengthy and candy sweet, and all too easy to drink."
"D - This has become a favorite of mine. I really like the simplicity of it. It's very easy to drink."
"Tripel Karmeliet is one of my favorite tripels. It is one of the few beers that I keep coming back to. It is light and refreshing, and has a complex profile that comes together very nicely."
"a very young sample, BOD 11/07, pours an almost clear golden color w/ 1"" of pillowy white foam that never really settles all the way down leaving an almost unbroken lacing in my snifter ; a strong smell, loads of bready pils malts, and a mostly floral hop aroma blended w/ fruits and some hot alcohol make for a sweet ""beer perfume"" ; a crisp, faintly tart flavor made up of a huge malt front, cereal grain with a hint of nuts(?), greener fruits and a bit of grassy hop bite, some caramel and hints of raison midway, finishes smooth, dry and alcoholic, incredible overall flavor ; extremely dry, actually quite light bodied and ever effervescing, excellent mouthfeel ; not only drinkable, but addictive, i can't say enough, this stuff ROCKS !!!..."
"Pours a golden yellow, with a massive white head. Smells of grain and alcohol. Taste is quite dry, light in body, but a nice spicy character. The hops balance out the beer with a medium bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, though carbonation levels are slightly high. This is a good beer, though I personally would only want to have one at a time, its drinkability isn't as high as other Tripels I have had."
"O - Fantastic beer. Very complex nose and flavors with light finish"
"A+ indeed."
"D - An absolute classic yet more of a Saison w/ its spice and earthiness. A very excellent tastte and definitely must be tried on draft. I consider this a unique and fine Tripel that is very accessible and well crafted. World Class, must be experienced."
"Mouthfeel is light and plenty of carbonation. Highly drinkable beer and ABV is hardly noticeable. I really enjoyed this tripel and would recommended on its aroma alone."
"This well balanced ale presents so much yet lets nothing stand out. I need to find out how to get a keg of this stuff. Delicious."
"Drinkability: Although the alcohol content is far from overwhelming, it is more present here than in some other tripels I have had. This beer is fun to sip and enjoy, but I'm not overly depressed I don't have a second one on hand."
"Too sweet for my liking but good to try. Good replacement for those who don't like wine. High ABV (8.0) so I wouldn't consider this a session beer."
"This was a very nice beer to sip and enjoy. I'd certainly have it again."
"The beer is drinkable, but like most Triples I just want one of each kind."
"I have no real complaints here. A good textbook Tripel. I could go with this one for a few more rounds."
"MF&D- Very high carbonation but suits this beer well. light bodied but leaves behind a sweet sticky coating in the mouth. Very good beer but not quite worth the $15.99 price tag on the 4-pack."
"Note: Yummy tripel."
"M/D: Bubbly, light and very bitter for the style, a slight touch of sweetness and some sourness. A very complex feel in the mouth which makes it a little tougher to drink but still is good."
"All in all a well balanced beer that is great for a tripel. I'm not usually a tripel fan, but this is just balanced enough for me. Nice job Bosteels."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for such a large beer. A good beer."
"Pours an excellent golden-orange with a big and fluffy 2+ finger off white head that lasts forever. Big grapefruits and esters hit the nose all mixed in with some alcohol and a bit of bready sweetness. Tastes sweet bready and malty up front with some hop bitterness coming right before a fairly decent alcohol heat finishes things off. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, very satisfying and there's a little paradoxical creaminess to round off the crips edges. Carbonation is excellent, yet the drinkability suffers just a bit due to the alcohol content, which is not a problem for me, but might be for some. Tripels are my favorite brews at the moment, and I found another stellar one to add to the list with the Karmeliet."
"Overall: I can see why this is rated as the number three triple in the world. It is big on flavor and a true joy to drink. When I purchased it I had no idea of what I had just bought. It was a real pleasant suprise. Try it you'll like it."
"M&D: Despite the complexity, the overall flavor profile is relatively light to medium in body. The carbonation is rather lively, albeit in streams of fine bubbles, and adds to the levity of the mouthfeel. Everything comes together wonderfully to produce a highly drinkable and very enjoyable brew. One of the best triples I've had."
"drinkablility is good. this is a lighter belgian in body and character, but still showcases a rich and well proportioned profile. cheers!"
"Rich orangish honey colored beer with very little head on it. Mildly malty, wheaty nose to it. Light but noticeable belgian yeast in the smell as well. Flavor is malty, caramelly and of light alcohol. Somewhat creamy and tastes of smooth maltiness and belgian yeast. Decent, but not for me."
"Subtly excellent. Crazy drinkable. This isn't as big, sweet and syrupy as most tripels. When I was in Belgium, someone told me this is actually not a true tripel, despite the name. I thought that was crazy, but considering that it tastes and feels more like a crisp Belgian pale ale or a lighter Saison...maybe that's true after all. Whatever you call it, it's a very good beer...extremely refreshing for the coming warm weather, and something that would be a perfect gateway beer for anyone curious about the world of better beer. (I guess they kicked it up .1% recently, as my bottle says 8.1%. Hairsplitting Extraordinaire!)"
"D: The ABV is hidden extraordinarily well in the nice example of a tripel. The defintion of drinkability. Overall a very light and simple beer that would best be paired with a stronger food."
"D - I am ready for another."
"Overall an excellent beer. Will certainly drink again."
"A very complex, yet delicate and classy Belgian Triple. Worth the search"
"D: Very nice tripel. The alcohol is very subtle, so watch out. Sip this beer and the flavors become more complex as it warms."
"D - this is very easy drinkin. drink it on a train in the rain, on a boat with a goat. yes stu i am, i love this green egg and ham."
"deceptively drinkable as well."
"Perhaps I need to try another bottle to get a more rounded experience."
"An excellent example of a Tripel. This beer poured a nice golden haze, with a thick 2"" head. The smell was very fresh and light, a slight amount of hops, and lots of summer fruit.. peaches, plums, apples, and pears. The mouthfeel was good.. small bubbles, just right. I was surprised on the whole.. I expected it to be a lot heaveier than it was, but it was really great."
"D- I know some of you frown on beer/wine comparisons, but I only do it so you can get your wine drinking friends to try better beer, and convert them! A good gateway for white wine folk, the riesling, pinot grigio, sweeter chardonnay drinkers. I really enjoyed this with some spiced pork chops, in place of apple sauce."
"Overall: A very well-balanced trippel & i love the spicy feel to it. Definitely one to keep in mind."
"drinkability is excellent. perfectly balanced with almost no alcohol in the taste. perfectly restrained spice. this beer is an exemplar for the style and certainly the best tripel i've had the pleasure to try. i will definitely be seeking out more of this one."
"Pours a golden color with a nice thick white head. Spices immediately fill the air as the scent pleasantly overwhelms the senses. It tastes of spices and fruits: cinnamon, coriander, apples and pears. It is extremely well balanced and fits the style head on. Has a medium body and a nice dry finish. Overall, great beer."
"A great Belgian I can see why it won some medals I wish they would change the bottle color green glass is not cool. Extremely drinkable will gladly seek this one out again"
"D - Very easy drinking, and an excellent tripel benchmark. Drink frequently."
"Deep aroma when first poured. Settled into a mellower ""tripel"" aroma: slightly pehenolic, with a good dose of hops and malt. Poured with a creamy head with lots of lace and a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color. Flavor was slightly sweet with a good balance of hops and acidity. Every sip seemed to reveal different flavors: sweetness, malt, acidity, alcohol and a hint of anise. Good carbonation with an effervescent and creamy mouthfeel that lingered for several seconds. Very complex, well balanced and drinkable. Excellent."
"d: overall a very quality tripel that has unique flavors to distinguish it from the pack"
"Been waiting a long time to sample this one, as I've heard so many good things about it... certainly didn't dissapoint... copped a large, green, 750 ML bottle from Gary's in Madison, caged and corked... ""Conditioned ale made with oats, barley, and wheat"" on the back logo, along with the recognition that it won ""The gold medal at the World Beer Cup""... appearance was very impressive, with a nice golden, sunshine color with a long-lasting foamy head that lingered for some time and left some lacing as well... very fruity aroma bursting with fresh florals, fruits, and sweets... taste was very thick, rich, and creamy, with strong, sugar-laden flavors, ultra-sweet, loaded with fruits, pears, apples, and rich candied sugars... very thick and rich brew, replete with flavor and character... certainly a fulfilling Tripel in every sense of the word... this one isn't like most other representations of the style that I've sampled... it certainly stands out due to its ultra-thick and very sweet flavor that really makes itself known... 8% ABV is hard to notice, as it is well-masked behind a rich conglomeration of thick and sweet flavors... Recommended..."
"D - very easy to drink, an exceptional beer. I will definitely be getting more of these..."
"Refreshing taste. Light orange zest and lemon. Yeast and biscuit in the middle. The end is sticky and crisp. Perhaps too light, but this would be good in the summer instead of during a snow storm that had thunder and lightning."
"D: Given the apparent alcohol content, I don't know how many of these I could put down in one sitting. However, this is a very pleasurable beer to drink and it offers a very nice sensory experience. A well crafted ale - highly recommended."
"D: Wow. This was a real treat. I had it several times while it was on tap at Zenos in State College. Definitely worth a try."
"I received two bottles of Tripel Karmeliet from a friend as a Christmas gift. I was hesitant to drink it right away because I knew that it would be difficult to find if I wanted to purchase more. My first taste reminded me of a mix between a Hoegaarden and a Leffe Blonde. The beer pours great has an excellent body and feel and tastes full. At first you don't taste the alcohol but after a few glasses it starts to set in. I enjoyed this on a cold winter night while watching some hockey. I am planning a trip this weekend to go and purchase some more in time for SuperBowl. I am looking forward to trying other Bosteels brews such as Kwak and Deus. I will be sure to follow up when I do!"
"Into a Duvel tulip, pours a clear apricot, a continuous stream of bubbles issuing from the base, I nearly over-poured this sucker as the head explodes (thus the size of Tripel Karmeliet's glass... which someday I'll own... someday...). The head eventually subsides to a thin film, and the lacing is nice but doesn't stick much on my glass. The aroma looks like the picture on the bottle, waves of wheat, pastoral feeling to it, with notes of citrus orange, coriander, lemon, apricots, peaches, all kinds of lovely stuff. The taste follows suit, and man its powerful, and getting me into a jiff quick. It just drinks so well, I'm taking it too fast, the sweet nectar urging me on. The mouth is fairly medium, smooth and warm, and all is pretty good. If I had one complaint, it'd be that it gets a bit too sweet at times, have to take breaks. But still, damn good beer."
"A very pleasant, drinkable, tripel. Nothing that stood out as exceptional, but nothing to point out as unpleasant. If you like tripels you will like this beer."
"The Karmeliet has a cloudy golden appearance, pouring very little head. The smell is fairly strong and sweet. One gets the impression of fruit and spices, mainly pepper and coriander in this one's strong taste. It has a nicely carbonated mouthfeel, though not as powerful as other tripels. This is definitely a drinkable beer. I might actually seek this one out again if it's possible."
"This beer was good. It poured a nice golden color with nice white head and great lacing. The aroma was of cloves and fruits. The taste was similar to the smell but with a hnt of pepper up front. Mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall a great beer."
"Pours golden with a good head and decent lacing. Smell is sweet with some herbal and clove aromas. Spicy and sweet flavors up front with clove, black pepper, and coriander. Softens on the finish to a light breadiness. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but soft and sweet. Very easy drinking, and would be more so if the carbonation were a tad more restrained."
"There is a strong yeast flavor that might scare some people off, but I think it adds to the complexity. Lots of flavors, spicy bite along with the malt and grain flavors. Also has a warming alcohol aftertaste that made it nice to sip on a chilly night. Lots of carbonation made it feel almost fuzzy on the tongue. Well balanced, all around a top example of a tripel."
"Really nice tripel that I would gladly have again."
"Tripel Karmeliet makes me rethink my cellar .... I really need to stock up on triples and other Belgians and let the RIS and BW's come as they may. I've been a fan of Belgium for years.. but actually typing this review is ponderous."
"Taste is also pretty impressive. More fruity ala pears, melons, banana, etc....clove, coriander, candied sugar, honey, very quaint alcohol detected when I try to find it. Only 8% abv, which is low for a tripel, but very well hidden nonetheless. The low alcohol content makes this one even more drinkable than it already is due to the flavor and aroma alone. Mouthfeel is above-medium body, definitely has some body to it. Very refreshing. Finish is semi-dry. Not nearly as dry as some other tripels. This is probably my favorite of the style. Excellent representation."
"One thing is for sure, I'm getting full from this beer. It's sweet, and kind of syrupy, but an incredible beer to enjoy in the evening. Probably best split between a couple people when it's this big bottle, but I have no issue draining it myself! I will buy this for as long as I'm a beer lover. Could not be improved. Excellent style example."
"I first enjoyed this brew in Belgium and was delighted to find it available in the States...this will be a staple beer in my cellar for years to come."
"A very good beer, but falls short of Westmalle Tripel due to greater alcohol presence (despite having a lower ABV) and slightly less complex smell and taste."
"A fantastic example of the Tripel style. Im intrigued by the 17th-century recipe making use of oats, barley and wheat. It pours a beautiful golden color thats fun to look at, and is *quite* bubbly besides. The nose is incredibly rich: apricot, wheat, snow peas, coriander, Chinese 5-spice powder, and a wee bit of banana. The taste brings on a touch of toasted sesame, and the spicy bubbliness keeps on coming. Not an every-day beer, definitely a special-occasion, rich, rich beer. Thick, even. It would go well with Vietnamese cuisine (think light, but spicy, noodle-bowls with peanut sauce), but it loves it some balsamic peaches, and also is very happy with romano, ricotta, and a good whitefish like skate. I think this has become my favorite Tripel. An amazing beer."
"This still is one of my all-time favourite tripels. 2 years in my pantry has made it a little smoother around the edges. A beer that i usually recommend to people that want to try a belgian-beer. Recommended!"
"I find this beer to be a bit overrated but i can see it getting better with a year of cellaring ( maybe ). It pours clear and yellow with a moderate head that dissappears quickly. lacks the creaminess of a classic belgian trippel. races down the throat in a soupy way, seems undercarbonated. slight piney sweetness to it, and a hoppy finish but not bitter. Interesting, but if you are looking for a classic belgian trippel go elsewhere. Bosteels least desirable brew. But good nonetheless."
"Crystal clear, golden ale with a big, long lasting head. Aromas of fruit, candy sugar and malt, with some mustiness. Comes across spicy and highly carbonated, but with a strong fruity-sweet backbone. Finishes hoppy and sweet. Carbonation slightly strong, but mouthfeel is well attenuated as one would expect from a Belgian brewer."
"Appearance is a yellow straw color with a huge fluffy white head. Smell is of clove, banana, white grapes, yeast, and sweet malt. Tastes as it smells with some lemon and apple mixed in there. Flavors are on the lighter side. Mouth feel is creamy, smooth, and light. Highly carbonated. Drinkability is fantastic. Flavors and aromas work well with each other. 8% ABV was barely noticeable. Recommended!"
"Poured from an 11.2 oz that was shared with a buddy. On the brighter golden side with a 3 inch head that took a while to come done. Plenty of lacing-looks delicious! Smell of phenols-cloves and banana but not like a hefe-more subdued. Taste was top notch. The ""3 grains"" produce a very smooth beer. Alot of tripels are too sweet and have too stong an alcohol flavor for me. This hides the alcohol so well that I would never have guessed it was 8% and although it tasted sweet-the wheat character was evident which helped balance. Hops are low but present and feels very smooth in the mouth. Give this one a shot."
"Taste/texture: Opens with a pronounced banana flavor, slowly becoming more dry and spiced as it sits on the tongue. A slight warming alcohol presence is felt, but it's not a detraction. A bit syrupy on the palate, making it more of a sipping beer than a session beer. Overall a great tripel."
"Overall this was a wonderful beer. A great true Belgium tripel. A new favorite for me, and I will try to always have some on hand."
"Drinkability : une bière gourmande"
"D: This is good because its perfectly balancedwhich above and beyond it the most important aspect of a beer, IMO. Not over the top in one direction or another. Its not my favorite style so my review is probably a bit low for the caliber of the beer."
"Simply put, I spent about two hours on my one bottle, not because it was difficult to drink, but to savor it. Again, this is one of the beautifully balanced beers I've tasted. It's rich and complex, and had there been more, I'm not sure I could have prevented myself from drinking it."
"I'd drink again, but not in the same sitting. Half a bottle was just about right."
"D-This is an excellent Tripel. It does not hit one over the head with any of its' characteristics but is a good well made beer with plenty of complexity. The alcohol is well hidden"
"A first class tripel. Excellent beer that I could recommend to anyone."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. Aromas of a dry, Belgian candy sugar, and yeast. In the taste, a dry sweet malt and a hint of fruitiness. A smooth malty mouthfeell and a dry yeasty, and small sourness aftertaste. Very easy to drink, nice yeasty presence, a great triple."
"A definite recommendation to lovers of the style, and of beer in general"
"I approve and will likely purchase again."
"D - A great tripel that is well worth having on hand for drinking every now and then."
"D- This beer has a wonderful subtle complexity with notes of light fruit with some good floral notes and sweet flavors without being cloyingly sweet."
"M - Medium viscocity, but the carbonation is very well balanced, making it a little too easy to drink. Very enjoyable. This is by far one of the best Belgian ales I've ever had. Gonna be getting a few bottles of this to age. I'll be reviewing these in the future..."
"D- It is a tasty brew. It is a solid offering from Bosteels. I have had better tripels but it is a good one."
"D: Overall, very good, a great tripel, one of the most complex beers you're going to find coming out of Belgium, a must buy."
"The Belgian style continues to impress me. This brew is highly recommended."
"I used this beer as the toasting champagne at my wedding!"
"I tried this beer on September 14, 2007 at 'The Beer Bistro' in Toronto. The beer poured a hazy gold colour with a large fluffy white head that lingered throughout. A high amount of effervescent could be seen. The aroma was surprisingly hoppy and perfumey and had floral tones. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with high carbonation. The flavour was malty with some citrus hints."
"My second favorite tripel, St. Bernardus being the first. I must get more of this. A terrific beer."
"Very slick mouthfeel. You can't feel the alcohol at all. A little thin but very drinkable because of the lighter body."
"D: No alcohol heat but damn it can take you by supprise, very refreshing for a tripel but not quite what I was expecting, this one tastes a bit more like a belgian strong pale ale."
"I hope it's served more often."
"Highly recommended."
"A real classic!"
"Drinkability: You won't be pounding these but it's easy to drink."
"D: Good on the drinkability scale although it is quite alcoholic. A very good tripel but I've liked several of the other tripels that I have tried more than this one. Certainly worth trying though."
"Overall: The flavours are great, apart from the over abundance of alcohol(hence the 3.5 rating). Perhaps while in Belgium my palate got accustomed to very high alcohol brews and thus this seemed more drinkable to me when I was there."
"This is a first rate Trippel and quite a treat. The beer pours a nice white head, plenty of fiz, with a nice herbal and floral smell. The beer doesn't lace, which is a bit surprising. The taste is just great. This is a medium to full bodied beer with lots of flavors in the citrus, banana, orange, rind, lemon family, and maybe more. There is a nice tingle on the tongue from the carbonation and the live yeast. The alcohol is present, and you would expect it from a beer with 8 ABV, but it isn't omnipresent. The only down side is that there is too much of a yeasty bite at the end. The aftertaste is pleasant. This beer makes a statement, and it is a fine one indeed. L'Chaim."
"D - Great tripel beer defiantly one of the better ones out there."
"D- This is a wonderful beer that went down very easily. I will definitely be getting this again."
"Overall: An outstanding tripel, subtle and refreshing. Highly recommended. I picked mine for about $9, which makes this an affordable luxury."
"very interesting malty, chewy belgian beer. drinkable. well rounded . has A clear golden color. a fine off white head with no lace. good carbonation. tasty beer. nice hops. good body. sweet to bittersweet finish. a suggestion of alcohol. champagny. balanced. sort of a balanced belgian if that exists"
"750 ml corked and caged into a duvel glass. Beautiful golden color with a creamy head. The smell is pure sex. Peaches, apricots, floral hops, the taste doesn't disappoint. All the fruit. It gives way to a malt finish that gives it a nice finishing kick. The hops aren't there. Simple but divine. The mothfeel is a great balance of tingly carbonation and silk. The drinkability is fantastic. The alcohol is no more than a warm finish and the end of the bottle is coming way too soon. Mmmm..."
"From my notes 6/1/2007 On-tap at Brasserie Chagall in Brugge, Belgium, 330ml tulip glass for 4.10 ($5.62). poured with a one-finger white head that fades to a slim head leaving a trace of lace. Clear amber color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Balanced nose. Flavor is sweet to balanced. Slight bitter finish. Imported bottle is better."
"pours golden with a huge, bubbly head. i can litterally see every bubble that makes this head what it is. cool... decent retention, with minimal lacing on the glass. smells of yeast, bread, a little banana, spice, some fruit and a bit of green apple. to me, the green apple really comes through in the taste as well as a little hop in the nice, dry finish. i can also taste the three grains, which make this one real interesting and unique. dry/spicy meets smooth and creamy with great carbonation for a nice mouthfeel and drinkability. nice..."
"Overall a very good beer, I have a soft spot for the Belgian Tripples and this is one of the best without a doubt."
"Continuing with my exploration of Belgian Ales, I decided to try this one after seeing it on the cover of BA Magazine. Poured from a bottle, into a snifter glass. The beer pours a light copper, forming an enormous fluffy off-white head, which eventually fades. Light rings of lace dot the glass. The aroma is a mix of dark fruit aromas and alcohol. The taste is a mix of dark fruit flavor, a hint of caramel, a little spice, and a slight alcohol presence. Smooth light mouthfeel, with plenty of carbonation. Good abv. and full flavor, make this a very drinkable Belgian. Highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel-very carbonated and champagne like in taste as well. gets a spicy flavor as it warms up. Some of the wheat comes through with a bite. Finishes somewhat dry. A froth on the palate increases the complexity. I have not had a tripel much less a Belgian lately. This still has hints of the grape taste-wise. Alcohol is present but has a medicinal quality vs a warming on the palate. Not bad, different, and I dig! If your Belgian palate is rusty this will make you sit up and think. A very pleasing brew."
"The most enjoyable Tripel yet. Extremely drinkable, this stuff is awesome. Highly recommended."
"-Oelergud"
"If I could drink this all day, I would be a lucky guy. This is a mainstay of my beer rotation. Perfect for drinking outside on a spring day. If you love tripels and haven't tried it yet, stop whatever you are doing right now to go find some."
"Pours out like a lighter hazy honey with tons of carbonation in the body and a thick, fluffy, dimpled head that leaves ample lacing. Smells of wheat malt, grains, and lots of tropical fruits attributed to the yeast. I get some sweet apple juice in the nose as well as a faint hint of alcohol, but it is very well-hidden overall. Tons of malt in the flavor with bread, honey, fuji apple, nuts, passion fruit, mango, and peaches all inter-mingling. Yeast isn't off-the-wall spicy, but lends a good kick to all this. Mouthfeel is rather light on the tongue but has some body to it thanks to the (I'd imagine) oats. The carbonation starts off prickly, then subsides to a smoothness that works just as well as the stronger bubbles. An excellent tripel, but the slight sweetness could wear on me."
"Hazy pale yellow-orange color with big frothy white head and lots of carbonation effervescing off the bottom. Light and cirtusy, yeasty. Notes of lime and, dare I say, something like pink bubblegum? Mostly I mean that it smells somewhat sweet. Tastes like what I imagine a heavy hefe-weizen would taste like. Wheaty, sweet, lime and kiwi, with a subdued bitterness that permeates throughout. Pleasant and complex if a bit sweet for my tastes. Full bodied but with lots of crisp carbonation; a little of the alcohol can be felt deep in the chest. Not too strong for drinkability, but I find beer as sweet at this to wear on me a bit. Quite tasty and not what I was expecting from a Tripel."
"Nice acidity and bitterness that slices right through the sugar. One of my favorite Tripels, stands out from the (rather large and mediocre) crowd these days."
"D: A delicious, 'all-star' beer and so very drinkable. Well-balanced between sweet maltiness and a more bitter finish. Excellent mouthfeel. Very highly recommended!"
"Very well balanced big body brew with great flavor and the alcohol skillfully hidden...I highly recommend this brew as a great example of this style, and a very tasty one at that!"
"D- I enjoyed this beer. I am newer to this style and the quality of the beer gives me a good lesson on how a tripel should taste. The few I have had were too sugary/candy like. The malt character comes thru and leaves you wanting alittle more."
"I've had this on tap and out of the bigger bottle in the past (it's been a few years) but I don't remember it being so over-carbonated. Will have to try again. Still, a good-tasting tripel."
"Drinkability: Very smooth...hides the ABV very well. Yummy and drinkable."
"A strong and classy beverage that would suit well for pairing with poultry or pork dishes."
"Nice glass too..."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle. I love painted bottles and this one had a cool label. The neck had a small paper label with a best by date of May08. It had a slightly hazy golden color with bits of yeast floating especially towards the end of the pour. The bottle gave a loud pop and the cork nearly shot out of my hands. It had a massive 4 finger whitish head that slowly, slowly settled to a constant foam with great lacing. The aroma was incredible. It was fruity with a ton of spice. It really reminded me of the better wit smells. The mouthfeel was creamy and has the perfect amount of carb (which was constantly bubbling from the bottle of the snifter). The taste was also incredible. The problem I have with most tripels is that the great flavors get overpowered by the high ABV. This one is on the lower end of the ABV range and is perfectly balanced. The spiciness just washes over your palette and has you reaching for more. Overall, an incredible beer that I can't recommend enough. I try to rarely give out all 5's but I couldn't find a single area that didn't truly deserve it. (5, RR, T, Y, HOF)"
"Bright golden color and a enormous head of fluffy large, loose bubbles that does reduce but maintain one of two fingers. Strong fruity bouquet of apples, pears, pineapple, and lemon rind with some hot alcohol esters and a little piney hops in the back. Tastes of bitter sour fruit, green apple, and pear with dry, bitter, piney hops in the back. Developing are vinous characters,lemon pith, husky pale malt and barley sweetness, and vanilla notes. High carbonation makes for a foam filling mouthfeel on top of a thin consistency. The finish start with sour fruits and quickly fades to a mellow version of the taste with an emphasis on its hop character."
"The alcohol was well hidden in this brew, however I doubt I could drink several of these."
"Ok I uncorked the caged bottle and the cork exploded champagne style and I had a bit of a mess on my hand. The ale smelled wonderful, a bit of spice and Belgian yeast. A conservative pour yielded lots of fluffy foam and an amber fairly clear brew. I found this to be a very clean, spicey, slight banana taste brew with a bit of citrus in the aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable. I prefer the funkier St Bernardus Triple but this will be purchased again."
"From a corked 750ml bottle, poured a straw gold with pretty good clarity. The head was nice fluffy white with pretty good retention. Taste was of yeast, some soft hops, and fruit... very fruity and sweet. Mouthfeel was highly carbonated. Drinkability was good as the alcohol was masked very well."
"Overall: Possibly my favorite Tripel, taking over St. Bernardus' Tripel. An absolute pleasure to put down and a new regular here at the pad. The perfect summer beer. Highly recommended."
"D- This was a very drinkable triple that I will definitely have again."
"gulping as it warms better."
"Interesting brew, but perhaps a bit too sweet o drink more than one."
"11.2 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a super thick white head - nose of yeast , hay , orange , spices , and slight candy  taste of sweet orange , yeast , cereal , slight red fruit , mango , pear , apricots , and plumbs - body thick , and creamy  aftertaste of candied yeast , and orange"
"From the 75cl champagne bottle. I chuckled to myself as I recalled the old Miller ""champagne of beers"" campaign as I popped the cork out of this legitimate claimant of that title. This looked and poured like a barley champagne ... pale yellow with a gigantic poofy, airy, bright white carbonic head that actually squeezes atop my tulip glass and stands on its own with a 1/4-inch protruding well beyond the lip before it subsides, slowly and elegantly. The aroma is airy and extremely fruity, not unlike a carbonated lemonade! This drinks like a dream ... light and airy, with light and fruity flavors, yet with a big robust character. Sweet lemon, light yeast. I believe Ive discovered a prototype for all the good beers of the world. There are fewer and fewer bad beers in the world, but there are also few exceptional beers. This is one of them.(#2725, 2/23/2007)"
"The pear rules in the sweet taste of this most exceptional Tripel as well. Mouthfeel is prickly with carbonation, a must to keep something this sweet from becoming too cloying. Wonderful stuff that is a real sipper thanks to the sweetness. Had this with some Bar-B-Que chicken and lightly sauteed vegetables and it was spot on. Looking forward to my next bottle of this."
"Sampled from a beautiful screen printed bottle with a caged cork. Appropriately fizzy, a bit spritzy with vigorous carbonation. Smooth and refined, with no ETOH notes in the flavor profile. Very clean, some bready notes and a touch of light fruit. A white-wine of beers that would pair well with any fish or chicken dish."
"Aroma is nice , fruity , wheaty . This was a joy to drink as the carbonation tickled in my mouth . Crisp , energetic . Not like the Bruins who stunk out the place again . I will drink this sweet stuff again ."
"Overall, an outstanding beer that i could always enjoy."
"Pours a semi-opaque medium gold color with a tall, bubbly white head that has some staying power. Spotty lacing in the chalice. Nose is a fruity delight - sweet mango, pineapple, guava, and pear. Pleasantly malty with a decent hop balance in the form of a ""bite"" on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium, with a strong alcohol bite and acidity coming in late, leaving the finish rather dry though this one starts a bit cloying. I really enjoy this beer a lot. I had it first at the Hop Leaf in Chicago about two years ago. Loved it then, and still love it now. A ""top-shelf"" tripel."
"Notes: Overall I'd say this was above average. A good take on the style. Mouthfeel issues while trivial in most beers stood out like a sore thumb in this. What saved this beer and makes it a must try is it's best feature is the taste!!!"
"I'll recomend James Squire's Golden Ale to anyone in Australia who wants a similar brew at a fraction of the cost."
"When served in the appropriate glassware at Stubbie Shirt Pub in Gainesville, this beer is a majestic hazy golden in color with good lacing. Very nice looking. Aroma is very nice: fruity and spicy, with Belgian yeast characteristics, although perhaps not quite as appealing as St. Bernardus' tripel... Taste is along the same lines, fruit and spice, very light on the hops. Touch of vanilla, alcohol presence well-hidden. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is very smooth, carbonation is good. Drinkability is high - a very good beer."
"This brew is very refreshing and altogether well balanced. It's also got the typical warm alcoholic quality to it."
"Drinkability: Very intriguing flavors but more of a sipper than something to drink in quantity"
"Taste is an absolute feast of flavour. There is just so much here to enjoy it's hard to put into words at first. Various spices hit the tongue immediately, clove, coriander, perhaps a little cardamom, then the mellow fruitness sinks in, with bananas, pears, and golden delicous apples coming into play. This then moves into a slight drying tartness, much like a Granny Smith. All this combined with lots of chewy, nutty malt and bready flavours, and you have one drinkable and tasty Belgian. All the flavours are very sharp and well defined, never muddled up which makes this one so enticing. I found the mouthfeel very thick and chewy but a little more carbonated than I usually like. Dries out well in the finish and sticks to the throat a little. Drinkability takes a hit because of the ABV, but other than that I could down this in large, tasty gulps. A very enjoyable Tripel."
"d: this is my standard for trippels with an excellent balance across the board. any time i venture off to try a new trippel & get disappointed i can return to this old reliable"
"I could drink this beer all night long."
"Vibrant, slightly unique character, great, tasty recipe, melodiously balanced - very easy to see how this is hailed a world-class tripel. Certainly among (if not, the) best of the style I've tried to date."
"I poured it in the beautiful factory glass. The color is bright golden, with a nice head. Fairly low retention. Aromas of peaches everywhere in the nose. Nice carbonation on the palate with a sweet start that ends in a semi-dry fashion with notes of grapefruit. Gorgeous brew."
"This was just so-so in drinkability, trippels aren't my favorite style & this one was just l little to ponderous for my tastes. Tripel fans will like this a lot more than I did"
"D: A very satisfying tripel. An excellent balance between sweet and dry, tangy and hoppy. With a dash of alcohol to hold it all together. I am a big fan of its' grainyness. It adds a certain ""raggedness"" to this which is greatly appreciated."
"Drinkability: A tasty tripel with a pleasant , delicate complexity. Nice yellow fruit flavors and one hell of a nice bottle."
"Drinkability: I don't think I'd be able to down more than one of these. The ABV isn't that high, but the ""bite"" in this one makes my mouth long for something a bit smoother."
"Pours a nice clear amber/orangy color, nice carbonation, nice creamy off-white head, nice lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of malts, slight hops, yeast, spices, and pears/apple, grapes. The taste is slightly tangy/malty, nice not overly spicy. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty tripel, one of the bes I've had to date."
"Probaby the best tasting Tripel I've ever had, and that includes Westy 12. It doesn't quite have the 4 Alarm intensity of your average tripel, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"A very drinkable beer. A must try."
"11.2oz brown bottle with a best before code of 07 I H. Pours a medium gold with lots of carbonation and a huge head, decent longevity and good lace. Honey and citrus abound in the smell mixed with a touch a spicy herbs. Lots of rich honey like malt flavors mixed with citrus. Just enogh hops to balance out the huge malts but barely noticeable. Lots of phenols and a fair amount of noticeable alcohol. This should be lovely after a year or so in the back of the fridge."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet a hazy, golden straw color with a huge, thick head. The smell was of citrus and a hint of spice (nutmeg?). This is one of the best, if not THE best tripel I've tasted; sweet without being overwhelming, with just a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is incredible; the carbonation is dense and rich, which allows the flavor to linger on the tongue. This is a terrific tripel, and a great representation of the style."
"Overall: I actually enjoyed this brew, if only because it hides it's 8% alcohol well. This was quite tasty, and I'm not one to enjoy fruit beers, so this one had just the right proportion to not turn me off."
"Looks a hazy straw yellow, and smells of apples and green grapes with a touch of spice. The spice expands on taste, as does the fruit here. This is one of those beers that amazes you at what a beer can taste like. Not overly sweet. I'd say its perfectly balanced. Give me more."
"O: Very malty, milkshaky... for the sweet-tooth"
"Prost!"
"Mouthfeel is nicely done with smoothness, excellent carbonation, and full bodied."
"D-I'm slightly disappointed. It has some redeeming qualities but I prefer several others in the style more. Won't purchase again"
"Classic barley wine flavors"
"D: Meh, would be good during a hot summer day, when you wanted to get ripped. Not terribly drinkable for me, but I know people who would love this... Damn you belgians, I may never totally understand you."
"This is one beer I could drink a lot of and am really wishing I had more on hand. I got my bottle from BuckeyeNation, so thanks go out! Thankfully I discovered a boutique store that carries this fine beverage and it will regularly fit into the rotation."
"This brew is just outstanding! It gives the biggest head since Monica Lewinski! Great 3 finger head, nice soft pillowy body. Has some corn flavors and nice fruity esthers. Leaves unbelievable lacing down the glass. A drinkers dream! Pours a golden colour with that big head. Lovable beer and can actually be drank as a session!"
"This beer is available in 750ml, however, I bought the 12oz 3-pack version. Very pretty bottle and the beer is a nice straw color. Very nice fresh citrus smell with hints of lemon. I love the taste with orange, lemon and citrus flavors. The yeast must really be unique in this beer. I did not care for the over carbonation. I don't like to have the beer foam up in my mouth when I take a drink. I do reccomend this beer though."
"Cheers2Beers"
"A nice sipping brew. A delicate, floral fruitiness is the main characteristic. On the sweet side, even for style, but not cloying. A nice ""ocassional"" treat."
"Poured haphazardly into a chalice. This beer has a crazy aggressive head, which turns out looking wonderful. The body is a golden amber with tiny bubbles running from top to bottom maintaining the head. Smells of citrus, brown sugar, Belgian rock candy, apple, young banana and a tinge of spice. Tastes begins with a sweet citrus and candy flavor, then a slightly tart green apple and banana sensation and finishes with some alcohol warmth. This is a nice crisp tripel, not quit as bready as my favorites, but a nice tasty brew all the same."
"Cloudy golden-yellow with a big frothy head, served in a Duvel tulip. Sweet, yeasty aroma. Taste is incredible! Sweet, malty, spicy; a tremendous blend of flavors. Alcohol gives a little pleasant warmth without being overpowering. Incredibly drinkable Tripel."
"Poured to a hazy golden-orange, with lots of carbonation that almost poured over the top of the glass. Snow-white head was thick and pillowy, and lingered through the entire drink, and reduced to excellent lacing up and down the glass. Aroma was a very pleasant blend of floral hops and spices, mostly clove and corriander. Taste was more of the same spices and floral hops, reminded me a lot of Duvel at this stage. Very long smooth finish topped this beer off. The only thing I noticed was that the alcohol became a little to evident at late glass, and I would recommend not letting the beer warm all the way. But a most delicious beer."
"D: I doubt I would toss too many of these back in a night, but its a good beer and I would recommend it to anyone."
"Pours a hazy, straw orange color with plentiful frothy white head. Aromas are very funky for a tripel. Lots of different esters throwing off grass, cheese, spicy herbs and a little bit of bubblegum. Flavor mimics this weirdness of a kind of savory funkness I can't quite describe. Carbonation is very high giving it a biting mouthfeel and finishing sweet. This is a very unique tripel, one that I can't feel compares to others. I have to say it puts it in the periphery of other mainstays and I can't quite enjoy its strange funk, giving it a lower drinkability score."
"D- One bottle was enough for one sitting. I followed it directly by a very dry stout and that threw my taste buds for a loop."
"This is a good Tripel. Nothing outstanding about it but still very solid."
"Taste is fruity and slightly bitter, The grains used are barley, wheat and oats, I can really taste the wheat and maybe the oats. This beer is in fact a strong witbier and I can really taste it. Everything is really smooth. Carbonation is sizzling on my tongue. .Body is medium/thin. I think I can taste a strange aftertaste which I cannot place, but it must be something the yeast has produced."
"Nice tripel that is nicely balanced between sweet and spicy, and smooth and carbonated. Very nice overall."
"Very drinkable despite the 8% ABV. The alcohol refrained from ever overpowering the aroma or flavor."
"Da sipper for me and a good one at that. Id have it again for sure."
"A very nice ale, a wonderful sipping beer. Drink it only slighlty chilled to truly enhance the flavors."
"The head is big and white and fluffy, the color is golden and clear. The lacing isn't so sticky. The head is still very dense and has good retention. There's some copper in there too. The smell is wheaty, malty, and fruity. The fruit is sweet apple. The taste is good. The taste of the head is where the copper come from. I first noticed the copper when I opened it but thought it had gone away. Taste also has sweet green apple and a little clove. The mouthfeel is smooth and inviting. Overall I like it except for a few different things. I will have another one in a while."
"D: Exceptional (but it's fairly light on the alcohol for a tripel)."
"A golden cloudy body with a huge head and incredible lacing. The nose has lemon, ahy, lime, and some yeast. My first taste gives me yeast,champgne, and sherry. It finishes with some strawberry and prune. The beer itself is wonderful, andh ighly drinkable, but it was far too carbonated, and I was often sloshing th beer arund in my mouth trying to get the sip to a point where I wasn't swallowing all foam. It was otherwise superb."
"Taste; this is a very sweet and fruity tripel, with oranges, peaches, apricots and many others that I can't place. The yeasts add a bit of chalkiness, and the spices are a touch peppery, with almost no alcohol noticeable in the profile. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and drinkability is very good, but with the sweetness and abundance of fruit flavors I would not be able to drink more than one of these."
"The drinkability was through the roof. Several bottles served at 50-55 degrees F coud easily be enjoyed without strain. A great beer."
"Poured a hazy golden color with a medium sized, fizzy white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet fruity aroma with citrus fruits, and some pepper as well. Similar taste, sweet, citrus, more Belgian spices and an alcohol burn on the way down."
"Update March 2007: A little bit to add to my previous review. I have upped the appearance to 4.5 after having more experience with the tripel style. The fluffy white head is spot-on perfect, just gorgeous architecture spilling over the top of my gold-rimmed Rochefort chalice. Near perfection. Little bubbles stream from bottom to top for several minutes, this very active head eventually reduces to a frothy top-coat although the lacing is very persistent.This time around I noticed the wheat characteristics more than the oats, barley makes itself known. I didn't mean my references to witbier and hefeweissen characteristics as slanders, this is a much more complex brew than those two style, but the drinkability is where I made the connections. There was very little sediment in this bottle, I don't remember my old review..the light brown bottle was completely clear when I got done pouring this one. I also bumped up mouthfeel and taste for this review, the wheat characteristics make it full yet very smooth, and the taste is among the best I've ever had for the style, absolutely rivaling St. Bernardus and Westmalle for supremacy in the category. I loved it before and I appreciate it even more now. All in all this is one spectacular beer, absolutely stunning with the combination of flavors and big abv. Highly recommended to Belgiophiles as well as someone looking for their first Belgian brew."
"Went nicely with some chedder cheese and pepperoni."
"This is somplex, and yet easy drinking."
"Beautiful creamy head. Not as thick and majestic as a Duvel, but it's there. Fills the mouth with some yeast and malt (wheat) taste. Really a great beer, it has so many attributes that it's hard for me to describe them all here... Hmm I guess I have to go there and have another one in order to take some more notes. :-)"
"Drinkability/Overall: Truly the gold standard of the class, this has mellowed on the shelf at Riley's for some time, and it shows in the understated, ultimately controlled complexity. Just beautiful to watch/smell/taste/feel."
"Drinkability: Great. Fruity without being too sweet; tart in places without being overwhelming. Not as assertive as Westmalle, but allows for a much deeper range of developments. Perfectly balanced and a pleasure to drink."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer and I would recommend it."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow/gold, huge fluffy white head forms, nice lace, good retention. Smell is sweet, grainy, some orange, spices, wheat, little yeasty. Taste is sweet, orange and spice again, yeast, some alcohol, and a wheat dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. A decent tripel, but too sweet for me. I don't think it should be as high as it is, but enjoyable."
"Mouth: Strong carbonation upon the entrance, immediate anise flavors mixed with a sweet touch of a citric taste. The mouthfeel is stupendous, transforming from a strong bubbly entrance to a creamy finish with spicy, herbal yeast notes and a touch of alcoholic warmth. Unfortunately, the swallow is also a bit metallic and astringent, making the after taste less than desirable."
"This is a review of a 750ml corked and caged green bottle of Tripel Karmeliet. It opened with a nice pop, always a good start. It pours a light orange color with a huge white head into my Tripel Karmeliet glass (a very cool glass at that). It has a citrusy/lemon dominated aroma, with a little bit of the alcohol noticeable. The flavor is light, even delicate. No off flavors at all. Citrus is noticeable in the flavor, the hops and malt are hiding in the background. This is a magnificently well balanced beer. Nothing about the flavor hits you over the head (unlike most American big beers), but it's darn good. The alcohol is barely noticeable, other than some warming. Very drinkable, highly recommended."
"the taste is dominated by walnuts and sandalwood with a light almondy finish, which in itself would be great, however paired with some citric acidity which does not seem to match (at least doesn't for me) .... some might like the refreshingness, for me it lacks the sublime harmony you would find in the great trappist brews ...."
"try it."
"A great belgian blonde. Poured into a large wine glass. Formed a nice white head that went straight to the top of the glass. Champagne like in mouth feel. Coriander and spice on the nose, great yeasty smell as well. Pale yellow in color. Well balanced with a slightly spicy kick. Not overly alcoholic tasting for it's high abv. Another great Belgian beer."
"This pours a yellow straw with with a giant white foamy head. And like other Belgiums, this has a ton of carbonation. The smell is full of candy sugar,coriander, and bakers yeast. The taste is very sweet with candy sugar along with lemon zest, and some honey. The beer is so sweet that the sugar overpowers almost all the other flavors. The m/f is light and almost champagne like. The flavors mix well making this a very drinkable beer. For a high alcohol beer,this is very mellow and easy to drink. Another excellant Belgian."
"Served on draft in the official, over-sized Karmeliet snifter, which is incidentally my favorite beer glass of all-time, Belgian or otherwise. Pours a beautiful golden straw color, with moderate haze and an unusually large, milky head, for which the snifter was artfully designed, making for a stunning presentation. The head is very slow to subside, leaving behind a thick, luscious lace. Candi-sugar really dominates flavor the flavor of this one, in both aroma and taste, with some citrus and sour apple esters. There are no noticeable hops, although the Wheat and Oats on the grain bill are clearly evident in the body. Personally, I'd have preferred more grain over the candi-sugar, which I feel makes the Karmeliet a bit too sweet on the finish. Still, the body is typically digestible for a strong Belgian, making for a smooth, easy-drinking, and deceptively dangerous beer. Overall, the Karmeliet is a great beer that is very enjoyable, so long as you don't overdo it!"
"I thought this beer was well balanced and very refreshing. It reminded me of a white wine, however I found the carbonation fizz to be a bit overdone for this beer."
"Very drinkable. The moral to the story; Always give something (or someone)a second chance."
"At all a good, natural beer: Interesting, complex , but also quite drinkable."
"D - Highly drinkable for a beer of this strength. A favourite tripel and easily one of my favourite beers."
"The Bosteels family scored with this one."
"Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. The aroma is bright and intense with notes of lemon, hay, candy sugar, herbal hops, corriander, anise, bread dough and alcohol. The flavor starts out with an intense lemon tartness, followed by candy sugar, herbal hops, yeast, spices and some alcohol. This beer reminds me of Westmalle tripel with it's intense lemon flavor. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation; drinkability is good. A very good tripel, solid in all aspects."
"This beer had a coppery/amber appearance with a great head with a lot of larger bubbles and lacing. Very good overall appearance. the smell was a syrupy, about what you would expect from a tripel. I really liked the taste, it was sweeter than most triples almost like a white wheaty ale, with hints of citrus. Definitely a bit heavy which usually brings the drinkablility down a bit."
"Drinkability, not the most drinkable, but again tripels are probably the toughest to rate in this category..."
"(edit: I just saw the picture...my bottle looked NOTHING like that...green glass with graphics applied directly on a translucent label.... did I have a really OLD bottle, or did I have a NEWly redesigned bottle? Anyone know?)"
"I will definitely try a bottle...and look forward to finding it on tap again. Highly recommended...IMHO."
"Verdict: This one feels much lighter than it actually is. Be careful, though. It catches up to you pretty quickly. A deceitful treat, for sure."
"11.2 oz bottle."
"Pours rather thick and dark for a tripel, kind of like a dark apple juice, with a good-sized head that diminishes to lacing after a bit. This beer smells of pear and yeast, but the overall impression I get is of a doughy smell. I don't find this aroma to be really complex (which puts me in a minority, I guess). The taste is also doughy, with pears and green spices. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with spiky carbonation and a creaminess in the malt. Although this beer hides its alcohol pretty well, it's still very much a sipping beer. A good tripel, but there are much, much better ones out there."
"mouthfeel, drinkability = the ""tripel"" character comes out here, as the beer is extremely smooth and thick for a brew that smells and tastes a little like wheat, citrus, and vanilla. Because the beer was smooth on the mouth and rather light for a tripel, I could have at least one more of these!"
"Slightly hazed yellow/gold beer topped by a generous, fizzy white head that keeps being replenished by ample carbonation. Great head retention once the carbonation settles and it formed dense, clumpy lace. Lemony citrus and spicy clove aromas dominate with some bready wheat. Sharp, aggressive carbonation kicks things off. Lemony bitterness throughout with gentle coriander and bread. Bitterness becomes a bit herbal at the finish and lingers. Palate drying at the finish. Slight alcohol warmth. Overall, a solid beer and one that I enjoyed."
"this is one of those beers i've seen time and time again on the shelf (everywhere) and never ventured to venture. but it's damn taaasty. good find. i win"
"I love it, love it, love it."
"Tastes complex and refreshing all at once. There is a nice ""edge"" to the taste, not sure what it is. Very nice to swirl around the palate. A delicious brew."
"Clear light orange in color with a head bubbly in texture, gigantic in size, and sticky in its falling. Very funky nose with bright fruit aromas, whiffs of alcohol, along with a hints of yeast and pepper. A Tripel just loaded with flavors. Very complex, funky, farmy, yeasty flavors loaded with fruit flavors. A sensational beer."
"its a bit dry, but the tartness makes up for it. its quality."
"Beneath the medium head of this hazy yellow beer there's some suspended particulate hanging out. On the nose I find the pleasant aroma of Fruit Loops. That's right, the dryish, cereal-meets-light fruit smell of Fruit Loops. The palate offers the appropriate fruit dose along with a solid if modest maltiness. (And yes it kind of tastes like Fruit Loops too!) The aftertaste is sweetly fruity, leaving behind a mild tartness. This pleasant, welcoming trippel drinks soft and easy-- quite easy, in fact, given the ABV. Yes sir, she's a fine brew."
"The flavor seemed a little harsh. Fruits seemed to attack the mouth. I know that is an odd why to describe it, but I expected a smooth flavor with some sweet and tart fruits, but what I got was a harsh fruit and alcohol flavor. By no means a bad flavor, I guess I just expected more."
"I love glassware of all kinds and have tons, but I have never had a beer in its respective glass look better and be better presented than this. Funny thing is that the glass alone is almost silly looking."
"While not the best triple I've had it was a great find. It is very drinkable and when friends of mine that arent really into beer tried this they thought it was rather nice and where pleasantly surprised to found out that real beer was this good."
"oh my god this is outstanding! a nice full balanced taste, complex enough to be interesting but simple enough to easily enjoy. alright that doesn't make a lot of sense, but what i'm trying to say is - this is an easy 5. creamy smooth, delicious, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen or tasted. buttery mouthfeel, highly drinkable."
"On tap at McGraff's Pub in Harrisburg, Pa. Served as a hazy medium amber colored beverage with moderate white head. Smell is a tantalizing mixture of citrus (lemon) scents combined with bananas and yeast. Taste is extraordinary, being a bit sweeter than other beers of this style, but very pleasant. Good combination of bananas, spices, and other fruits. Nice pleasant finish, with the extra sweetness leaving a nice taste. Very easy to drink and extremely enjoyable."
"This goes to show you that mainstream can be delicious in its own right. There's no stepping way out or taking chances here, but there's plenty of classic tradition delivered with fundamental good taste. While the alcohol is very well disguised, the ABV still comes through as a smooth, credible warmth. When it's time to get back to the basics, this is a fine one to turn to."
"M&D: given the ideal condition of carbonation, the beer's creamy and soft texture is one of the most enjoyable for this style... The medium body and complex flavour against an almost non-existent alcoholic backbone makes this beer utterly easy to drink... If given a richer flavour profile this just might be an all-time winner, IMO!"
"flavor is tart and barny with lemons, yeast and band-aids. prickly and spicy. alcohol well-hidden among the strong, but balanced flavors. doesn't jump out at me as a world-beater but i can't find anything to complain about. nicely made beer."
"D - This is a great little beer. I would if having that much floating protein affected the flavor at all."
"Had this beer on tap at my favorite watering hole. It pours a slightly murky gold-orange color into the Triple Karmeliet glass with plenty of head 3 and lacing that lasted all the way down. I love the design of the glass and bought my girlfriend a couple a few months back. The nose is floral and caramel with just a hint of malt. The taste is like honey and caramel and has a quick warming effect. It just a little too sweet for me, otherwise its great. Its very drinkable which would be quickly intoxicating at 8%."
"It is a costly beer when compared to most, but the quality is worth it!"
"Taste: a bit odd, fruity, sweet ending on a sour note. Very alcoholic mouthfeel. Would make a wonderful summer beer. Very drinkable at 8%."
"33 cL bottle, dated (best before, I presume) 12/07/07. Shimmering gold, very active carbonation, unstoppable rocky eggshell-white head. Lovely Belgian yeast esters: pear/apple wine, citrus zest -- a sweet scent not unlike that of Lemonheads candy. Biting spiciness up front, sour apples, lemon drops, coriander seeds. Huge fluffy mouthfeel. Softens greatly to a smooth, dextrinous finish. Overall, the taste is characterized by a spicy sweetness. Demure Saaz presence peeks through here and there. Yeast pour adds a slight haze and a minimal chalkiness. No alcohol taste at all, but my tongue is numb, so I know it's there. Super drinkability. An incredible tripel, and an utterly beautiful beer all around."
"Alcohol taste and definitely a heating sensation on the way down. Slight fruitiness that is overpowered by the alcohol with a yeasty taste rounding it out. Great feeling beer that tingles all it touches. Smooth and very well carbonated. This is an enjoyable beer that I found at a great price. Pick one of these up if you can."
"This is a great triple. Its spice flavors aren't as big as others, and that probably makes it even more drinkable."
"Overall: This is a really nice example of the style. The flavors are complex, but well-balanced."
"Overall- such a good beer. Just as delicious on tap. I could drink this all day. Although not a chugging beer. I could easily polish off several!"
"An excellent brew you should try and, if you like, pair with a good piece of italian ""parmigiano reggiano""."
"Cheers"
"Served in my Piraat snifter, this one looks to have massive carbonation. It has a slightly hazy yellow/gold color, with a decent thick head on top. Fine lacing. Smell is complex and perfumy with notes of citrus fruits, cloves, and other spice. The taste hits you quickly along with a burst of carbonation. Sour fruit at first and fairly phenolic toward the finish. Bitterness is fairly low, or at least not very noticible with that medicinal flavor in the mix. Very crisp, smooth feel, and again, very bubbly, which I like for a lighter beer. I think the strong malt flavors hide the 8% alcohol well. Highly drinkable brew..."
"Drinking it from a 750mL bottle and poured into my favorite snifter, I will enjoy this for the remainder of the Rose Bowl game."
"Tried this out as part of the best flight of beers I've ever experienced at the Flying Saucer in Addison, Texas. This is one where you know you're drinking a high gravity beer but the alcohol is not apparent or cause for hestinancy. A great Belgium beer that I would drink all evening. Nice light color and carbonation. Quite impressive."
"the mouthfeel is key here the beer coats your mouth with flavor"
"Drinkability: Very, very good! Some Belgium brews find me doing one and done. I had 3 of these beauties in one sitting on Christmas Eve and all I could say is ""It's a Wonderful Life""! !"
"This beer pours with an enormous head that never stops growing, and particles continually float around the whole body. The smell is very sweet, much like the candied malts you would expect in a tripel like this. The taste is almost perfect after you let it mellow... There is a slight hint of alcohol which is not hidden and a lack of a substantial body like other Belgians. Overall what a great tripel should be, highly recommended."
"Had this a few times, finally reviewing it. Pours a hazy straw color with a nice fluffy head that laces well. Smells grainy, of apples and faint lemon. Starts off with a stab of sweetness then slowly dries out through the palate. Slight apples, apricot, a little yeasty funk--some earthiness as well. The mouthfeel is beautiful. When allowed to hit room temperature, or close to it, it is so light and fluffy, almost weightless. Softly effervescent and terrific. As drinkable as any tripel i suppose..."
"Very refreshing and enjoyable, but with a slight sour metallic tinge. It may have benfitted from being served a bit colder."
"Appearance is a little misty (poured the whole bottle in), pale golden yellow colour, white diminishing pillowy head, no lacing. Aroma of sweet spicy fruit (bananas, pears?) and belgian yeast. Flavour is refreshing, spicy, fruity and grainy with a warming finish and a bit of alcohol. Juicy on the palate. Overall rather drinkable."
"D = The alcohol taste in this brew makes it hard for me to drink more than one per session. But definitely one I will drink again."
"Drinkability- Could have a couple pints over spread out over the course of teh evening. But not a session before."
"10/07 Another bottle. Still great, but for some reason it just seemed too sweet this time. Not sure if my palate has changed, the mood, food, or whatever."
"Appearance: Served up in official glassware at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse, has a golden slightly orange hazed hue with a frothy egg shell white colored head measures four fingers deep this in the very artistic tulip shaped glass, forms fine intricate Belgian style lacing as it dwindles slowly. Aroma: Spicy black pepper note teamed with a slightly grassy hop character matched with tropical fruit notes of melon and fresh pineapple, what a nice blend of everything some mild acohol is present but very nice. Taste: Somewhat bitter for a Belgian Triple the bitey hop profile pairs nicely with the mango and melon honey tinged malt tones with a slightly alcoholic edge some funky yeast notes finishes dry excellent triple. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied effervescent carbonation slightly syrupy in nature but glides across the palate very silky. Drinkability is amazingly effortless this is one of the greats from Belgium, solid complex layered flavors blend so nicely this brew comes together."
"Poured this slowly and my glass was half head in no time. Theres a torrent of champagne bubbles roaring up from the bottom now sustaining the foam rubber textured egg shell white head that leaves a thick wall of foam on the side of my glass too thick to be called lacing. Perhaps matting? The color is golden straw. Heavy spicy yeast in the nose with some wheat, some sourness, and a touch of alcohol. Theres also a slight bit of banana and bubble gum. The flavor is very dynamic. Starts out a bland wheat flavor, but an explosion of the carbonation releases the yeasty spices and the latent sweetness. The mouth feel is slightly thick and is about as carbonated as a beer can get with out being annoying. It leaves the palate numb and tingling, awaiting the next sip. This is a very nice beer and an absolute pleasure to sip."
"Although the alcohol is a little prominent, I think this beer is very drinkable. Infact I wish I had another."
"Appears a crystal clear golden color, initially with a big fluffy head, but it died in a few seconds. Smell is sweet, lightly grainy, with a nice grassy hop profile, much like a Belgian pale ale, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is on the sweet side as well, yeasty and grassy, but with a bit more noticable alcohol than is healthy for this style. Not particularly balanced. I really think this fits into the Belgian pale style more than the tripel. It just doesn't have that rich carmelly sweetness or mouthfeel that a top notch tripel does. Nice spicyness however, and a refreshing beer."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, but I dont know where I would classify it. I wouldnt call it a Tripel per say, nor would I say that it is a Saison. It doesnt need a slot on the BJCP guidelines to taste good. It is a very clean and well brewed Belgian alewhat else can I say? Try it for yourself."
"Dark gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Aromas of banana, mild citrus, mild bready malts, and a touch of alcohol. The flavors begin somewhat malty and sweet, but quickly evolve into a pleasing melange of spices and fruit. The finish is rather clean, making it very easy to drink. Very drinkable stuff and extremely well made."
" This is the most over the top tripel I've had to date. Sweet and alcoholic up front. Lemon- lime orangy tangerines too. The sweet honey attempts to balance this, to no avail. Grassy hops play a small role. The mouthfeel is not as carbonated as I'd like in a tripel, despite the foam. I wouldn't want more than one of these in a night, unusual for me with tripels. I might like this with a little more age on it."
"I like what the carbonation does for the mouthfeel: keeps it lively and fresh. Drinkability....hell yes. The abv is well hidden and the best part...the taste is complex and wonderful."
"While my experience with Belgian tripels is still somewhat limited, I've found a 'tripel triple' that I really like: De Dolle Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch), Westmalle Tripel, and now Tripel Karmeliet. Each has its charms, but at the moment, this beer is my clear favorite. From where I sit, Tripel Karmeliet is the quintessential Belgian tripel and is the unqualified best."
"Food note: I had some Humboldt Fog cheese with honey with this beer. Quite good together. The honey tastes hook into each other, but the sweetness in the honey provides a contrast in those two ""honey"" tastes as well."
"750ml bottle corked and caged. Pours out a clear golden orange body with a tall off white foamy head. Good amount of lacing clings to the glass as it is consumed. Aroma is pretty big with a bunch of things going on. Lots of spice and fruity sweet notes seem to dominate. Some toasty malts in there as well. Sweet fruit flavors of pears, apples and other fruits lead off the flavor. Various spices are present as is a bit of a yeasty note. Finishes spicy sweet with a bit of a lingering spiciness. Lively with carbonation and very smooth going down. Ample body. Very drinkable and complex stuff from a style that usually doesnt impress me."
"Thin, whispy head holds for the life of the brew.. appearance is hazy gold with a fizzy head & streams of carbonation coming from the bottom of the goblet. Tons of yeast, even after a careful pour and trying to keep the sediment to a minimum. Aroma & flavor is quite complex..banana, cloves, raisins, wheat, oranges, etc, etc.. all present in the taste and taking their turns in the spotlight with every sip. Still, a bit too thick on the spices for my taste. Not offensive, just leaves it a bit unbalanced in my mind. Very smooth for a complex, 8% alcohol offering. I finished off the bottle and wanted more. A well-crafted Belgian brew."
"Burnt golden color with a beautiful, solid, serious, bulbous head. The aroma is yeasty, and peppery with a backdrop of alcohol. It al blends together in a nice little packagetogether with a little sugar and fruit smells. The taste has a notable candy flavor, with a graininess and maltiness. Slight bitterness in the end, but framed with pepper and spice. The mouthfeel is a little light, given the nice flavors. I expected something more mouthfilling and creamy. Instead, its kind of thin. Still, this is a tasty, enjoyable, very flavorful Belgian."
"Drinkability: This would make an excellent choice for your first Belgian Triple. If you get this in a 750 ml bottle, this is a must share beer with all your good friends. Also, watch out if you buy this in a green bottle, it might have been exposed to too much light."
"I've had this excellent brew several times in the past, but realized that I hadn't reviewed it. I could be drinking a Unibroue and not know it. Very similar taste to the Don de dieu, Blanche de Chambly, and La Fin. Similar yeast, maybe? A bit lighter (but not much) than my favorites of the style (Westmalle, Allagash, St. Bernardus), but very refreshing and satisfying. I was very happy to see this one appear at a local store, and would never be disappointed to choose this when in a tripel mood (like tonight). Buy without hesitancy."
"A wonderful tripel. Poured out to a dark golden color with high carbonation. Belgian head is present, building up to about 3/4 of an Inch. Minor lacing around the glass. Aromas of citrus (?!), malt, yeast, and some floral notes. Interesting. Taste is dryer than some belgians, but not bad. Flavors of fruit and sweet malt are present, with a alcohol backbone that is not attractive. Aftertaste of again, citrus like notes with a dryer finish than most. Mouthfeel is exciting and very bubbly, with carbonation making it's way into the mix bringing the nuances of this brew to the forefront. High drinkability. A worthy example of a what a good Belgian Tripel should be. Recommended."
"Overall: I'm not a huge fan of tripels, but I think I'm in love here. Just all-around solid, easy to drink, and deceptive at 8%."
"Not something you throw back a few of, but very tasty brew!"
"The first thing I noticed was how sweet and soothing this was. Perhaps inducing a little nostagia, making me think of eating canned pears as a kid with the similar sweetness. This quickly gives way to a sharp sour punch that is just what the doctor ordered to offset the sweetness. Although it has a nice mouthfeel, the drinkability factor is suffers because, as this is really tasty, its so complex, one almost feels as if they need something a bit more simple after this complex monster of a beer."
"I could drink a bunch of these."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, incredibly well carbonated, full gold color with a frothy, rocky, light tan head. The aroma is spicy with notes of sharp ginger, vanilla, clove, tart pear, plus earthy spices like coriander and grains of paradise. The aroma is quite enticing and zippy. The taste is sweet up front and actually get a bit sweeter as the beer moves across my tongue. The high carbonation levels cause it to dance across my tongue and helps to offset the sweetness. The spicy, herbal, astringent character of this beer also helps to offset the sweetness. This beer has notes of orange peel, ginger, pepper, and a bit of cardamom and clove. This beer is quite tasty, but would be that much better if it was not quite so sweet."
"D - I can't put my finger on it. There is something amazing about this beer. I keep wanting it. Looking at what I said, I agree with all with all of it, and it seems complete. Yet somehow there is something left out. This beer is excellent, and the rating doesn't do it justice. I know this beer it good, but it is also not the best I've had, yet I have a feeling that in the future, I would choose it over many beers I've rated higher."
"Pours with an extremely foamy white head settling over very, very light golden/yellow liquid. The nose is gentle malt and fruit. Flavors of soft maltiness with a depth of sweetness and little in the way of hoppiness. Finishes quickly without much fanfare...lighter in body and more restrained in flavor than most other Tripels I've had."
"Notes: This was very good, and I'll drink it again."
"The 3rd phase is really just a slow aftertaste of the complex malts. There is a lot of flavor to ponder as you savor this brew. This is where mouthfeel completely mirrors the taste profile. There is so much going on I feel like to describe it all would be a dizzying maze of rambling... ""If writing a beer review were a romance novel, this would be it!"" my friend replies."
"330 ml bottle. Slightly hazy light orange color. Billowing white head. The aroma is a little fruity, with lemon and mango. Peppery spiciness. Sweet, malty vanilla flavor. Fruit and spices. There is a doughy characteristic to the flavor. The finish is hoppy. Some of the flavors in this remind me of a wheat beer. The high alcohol level is well concealed, but this is still clearly a big beer. This is one of my favorite Belgian Tripels."
"Very drinkable, despite the impressive strength of flavor and alcohol."
"Drinkability: it's refreshing. It's a good hour to spend with this beer. Will come back for more."
"I have had this quite a few times now, but have never entered a review for it. This review is from notes of several tastings. I have only had this beer in 12oz bottles, so this review is of that format. Appearance is right on. Dark golden with a huge head of white billowy foam that lasts and leaves nice lacing as well. The aromas are all white pepper, yeasty spices and some nice fruitiness. Alcohol is muted and basically not noticeable at all. Taste is fruity with some citrus notes and some sweet candy sugar notes as well. Middle is doughy and bready and the finish is peppery and hot, but not boozy in the least. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not too thick at all and the drinkability remains good as well. Reviewing this after Westmalle makes me realize how good ofa Triple this is. In the top 5, and possibly even the top 3 for the style."
"Best beer I've ever had. At 8% ABV it might not be a sessionable beer, but that won't stop me from having a few, now to find it in a closer location than Oregon."
"My friends and I loved this brew so much that we ordered some Tripel K tulips online. This beer has turned over a new leaf in Beer Advocacy for me, as heretoforth I had only gotten my friends to drink hefes and dunkels with the occasional bock."
"Pours a bright cloudy orange with a small off-white head. The aroma is strong, and of oranges. Nothing else can be smelled which is kind of a let down. The taste is a lot like the smell. Big orange flavor, but a bit tangy too, and very juicy. Nice, but not very complex. The alcohol is completely hidden. I would liked to have seen the alcohol come through, and add a little complexity to the taste. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and juicy. Overall, drinking this beer is a lot like drinking a glass of orange juice. Which isn't necessarily bad. It's big, juicy, and flavorful which is enough in my book."
"definitely a new favorite."
"side note: in belgium, this is a very common for a micro beer, like the sierra nevada of belgium. even the stankiest bars carried it and served in proper glassware. this gave me my first exposure to this beer and the US limited availability has given me a renewed love and appreciation for it."
"Overall - an excellent tripel. Maybe not up there with the Westmalle... but not far off..."
"Bummer."
"Mouthfeel is quite lovely- bubbly, not too watery, with no bad aftertastes, and no overpowering alcoholic feel, making it quite drinkable. Not sure I'd crave this all the time, but I can see myself picking it up every now and then. A solid beer."
"One classy bitch of a beer."
"I dunno if it was not having breakfast- or sleeping only 3 hrs today- that made this 75cl give me the buzz, but it's just what I needed right now....flavour included. this was a marvellous acquisition and it should soon be back on the top 50, for god's sake."
"Entry lights up the tongue with carbonation and is bright with carmelized sugar. Midtaste reflects a beautiful balance of sweet red berries, yeast, and a captivating dryness. The finish culminates with a final fresh-fruit sign-off leaving residual sweetness on the lips to be releshed post-sip following a dry yeasty fade."
"notes & comments: drank this with smith college admissions officer, she says she will only let belgians into smith from now on. a beautiful tripel, well worth the money, and masks the ABV like no ones business."
"Poured out a dark shade of yellow with a good foamy head. Smell was very yeasty, doughy, with a few spices and an underlying of tropical fruits. Taste was quite good. Alcohol upfront, but not overwhelming, with some spicies and tropical fruit. Some spices show up in the middle. Yeast underlies all the flavors throughout, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied, with a smooth, creamy texture. A good, solid tripel."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Appearance is very nice, a golden yellow hue with a nice long sustaining bubbly head with a lot of carbonation. Nose is light with fruity tones to it. Taste is a wonderful medley of Belgian yeast, pepper, and a lemony/fruity/grassy finish. The complexity is very interesting! Mouthfeel is very full and very lively with all the carbonation. The 8.0 abv is well masked which with all the other great qualities makes this an extremely drinkable brew!"
"This is a beer that I've had a few times, working up the courage to post my first review. Certainly that should indicate that it's a pleasant, highly drinkable brew, one that I would not only recommend but that I will return to when I'm looking for a reliably good beer."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and rather light on the palate. A refreshing, satisfying brew. I could easily drink loads of this if given the chance...especially off tap in the proper glassware. A treat of a tripel and highly recommended."
"On draught at Winking Lizard. Pours clear golden with a thin off-white head. The snifter in which it was served offered little lacing. Sweet fruit and clove aroma. Medium-bodied and bubbly with flavors of yeast, spices and peaches. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden. The finish is dry and lightly spiced and hoppy. An enjoyable Belgian through and through."
"The mouthfeel is lush and full with a medium body. Large playful carbonation quickly settles down and allows the flavors to penetrate your tastebuds. Really a superb tripel, well worth the wait. Probably the best tripel I've had yet."
"I appreciate the primer on some good Belgians. They definitely aren't my favorite but a finely crafted beer."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. $5.99 at The Caboose in Ashland, VA. Unsure how long I may have had this bottle, but the flavors are well done and it does not appear that age may have affected anything. The carbonation is there, just not very high and the head was nonexistent."
"Outstanding! If you have not experienced Belgian ales before, this is an excellent way to start."
"Oh my, wastes no time in asserting it's sweetness. It's almost mead-like. The mixed grain portfolio sweet talks with a husky voice. There's a pleasant sourness, floral, spritzy, grassy finish. Spicy aftertaste: Ceylon cinnamon, cardamom, coriander. Give me a couple of pitchers please."
"The alcohol content is very well masked which makes this beer very drinkable so know your limit because it could catch up to you if your not careful. Overall quite satisfying and ranked right up there as one of the great tripels that I would recommend to all!"
"The beer felt light and airy on the palette and went down quite easily. Wouldnt mind picking up another one when I am in the mood."
"This one's a keeper, and Belgium has once again secured a top spot on my list. Seek it out, this is good stuff."
"Talk about a surprise. So much going on with this beer. I think this one could have a shot at the tripel championship versus St. Bernardus."
"Drinkability: damn near off the scale. This is a tripel's tripel, a masterful blending of characters that make it dangerously quaffable. One of the finest examples of the style."
"From a bottle in a large wine glass. My first ever Tripel, so I may come back and revisit this one. Golden yellow with a slight haze. Small white head which dimished, although the glassware was less than perfect. Fruity aroma with apple dominating, almost cider like. Flavour is sweet and fruity at first with some alcohol kicking in with the reasonably sharp carbonisation, and a slightly bitter spicy finish - all very well balanced and smooth. Long pleasant after taste. Is this a beer? Almost like a dry cider with hops added. Interesting beer, much character and well balanced."
"One of my favourite pale belgians. Just the right amount of alcohol, flavour and aroma"
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a light yellow color with one finger of head. There's a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very very spicy, with lots of pepper and clove aroma. There is some orange and lemon in there as well. The taste is bubbly and spicy. More of that peppery flavor on the tongue, and a slight sweet citrus taste. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is really nice for an 8% brew. A really nice tripel."
"Overall, this is a great tripel, and at 7 bucks for this 750, it's an amazing value. Tasty, soothing, warming, refreshing: This is a perfect beer for an almost-spring night. (If I find more, I'm definitely stocking up.)"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for brining this one to our last tasting. Pours a cloudy yellow color with a tall head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma screams 'Belgian Tripel'. This is what a tripel is supposed to smell like. Lots of spices, some fruits, some yeasty character. The flavor was much the same. Lots of good spices, fruits, yeast. Very solid. I'd have this one again any time."
"This beer poured a nice yellow color with a finger of head nd a very active bubble. The nose was spicey and tart, with some lemony acidic qualities. Very nice. The flavor was lemony and peppery, zesty. Refreshing and well balanced. The feel was crisp, nice and bubbly, drying on the finish and moerate in body. I liked the crisp feel and drying aspect. This is one of the better beers I have had recently. Everything worked really well together. This was paired with a fresh mozzerella cheese, which worked very well with it."
"Ceratinly a nice brew, good belgian (as usual). Nice complex flavours in there but still nice and light."
"Wow, this one is hellacious. Just wish I could get it around here more often."
"When this brew first touched my lips I was initially very impressed with this brew, right up until the middle of that first sip when the pepper and spice really kicked in. I must be particularly sensitive to those sort of notes because they always seem more pronounced to me than what others around me seem to experience. Overall still a tasty beverage and without that peppery notes I think I'd like this one a great deal more."
"good beer. oh yes, very good."
"Pours a dark to medium gold color, with a huge head on the pour with excellent retention. This is going to take a while. (My girlfriend says it is the color of the amber that they extract the dinosaur DNA from in Jurassic Park). The smell is very piney, not in a hoppy way, but somewhat juniper berries. Taste is very sweet, probably overly. Very tart, and somewhat one dimensional. Complexity and shifting flavors are really missing from this beer. Too metallic, and the sweetness is still getting to me. Mouthfeel is fine, but this is somewhat of a dissapointment."
"Pouring a gold/slightly amber color w/ 3 inches of head with lots of sustanance and very spongy but while dissipating finally, not much cling on the glass; nice cascading as well. Aromas are pretty grainy, reminding me of oatmeal with some citrus aromas and possibly some cherries and spice- very complex...tough to determine exactly, but great aroma! Taking a sip, i notice some spicy nutmeg and cherries that jump out w/ some citrus tones (limes) and lots of sugar; very complex as well. Feel is pretty carbonated that stings your tongue a little too muchl; some nice alcohol burn on the finish, but light bodied and warming! Decent brew, but not my favorite belgian ever."
"This is an awesome beer, no question about it. I was lucky enough to have this on tap at Anam Cara (Brookline, MA) a few months ago and it blew me away. If you enjoy Tripels, this is strongly recommended."
"One of the tastiest, yummiest abbey beers around."
"Comments - For $7 a bottle, I wish that the brewers would have had the sense to put this beer in a brown bottle. The label says that it wona Gold Medal at the World Beer Cup. I'm guessing that if you can get this fresh, it could be much better."
"Pours a transparent light gold with lots of carbonation and a medium-sized frothy white head and lace. Smells invitingly of sharp grains and spices with a healthy dash of herbal fruitiness. Flavors are dominated by very crisp and clean grainy malts, which ride a wave of carbonation and develop floral and spicy tones along with fruit notes and relatively-tame alcohol at the finish. Quite light in the mouth. Complex, tasty and very, very drinkable."
"This is a very drinkable 8% beer. Not the best tripple but not half bad."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Superb mouthfeel and wonderful taste make this one an easy drinker."
"Thx"
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a huge thick foamy white head with excellent retention. Aroma is quite complex with a mix between candi sugar and good old Belgian yeast. Taste is very refreshing with some spices, candi sugar (well balanced by the way), good malt and finish with the yeast. Carbonation is excellent and body is above average but still not too full. Good interpretation of the style with all the ingredient well balanced."
"A Carmelite beer from Dendermonde, using the three classic grains for a beer: wheat, barley and oats. The label suggests a cooler temperature than cellar, about 6 to 9 degrees. A brilliant, clear golden colour greets the eye served in a chaliced glass. Sparkling golden honey; lighter than I expected. The head is aspirin white, fine, extremely creamy on top and more large-bubbled and chunky on the bottom. A thing of beauty when poured properly. The lacing is thick and extremely viscous. The very first aromas I detected where wheaty, with that creamy soapy character in some witbiers. A very malty aroma, which is not surprising in a three-grain beer. Spices, cloves, lime, and lemon. Some very strong, almost astringent chemical smells, but balanced with the malt, and the fruity yeast. Definite citrus in this beer. The oats I think add the creamy vanilla notes. The wheat malt is the strongest grain aroma for me in this beer. The taste is all malt up front, and even in the middle is a strong bread/nuts flavour. I also taste salty fish. More sour citrus in the middle, with the alcohol lurking in the finish, strong, phenolic and flowery. In fact, I can taste the alcohol more than I expected. Otherwise, this is magnificently tasteful. There is some caramel in the aftertaste. A predominantly malty finish, with little dryness. Very creamy mouthfeel, turning to foam almost immediately on the tongue. This beer is, despite its myriad aromas and tastes, approachable, and very drinkable, with no overpowering aspects whatsoever. It is refreshing, like a wit, yet very full, like a tripel. This is simply an extremely complex, flavourful and easy-to-drink Belgian. The lees are green and yellow, less malty and more soapy. More spice and less malt in the taste, too. This would pair exceptionally with a hot spicy dish."
"Drinkability is good; this has a nice sweet sour and spice balance that goes down well."
"Very refreshing, but with a kick. I've had this one several times and it managed to amaze me time after time. A most excellent beer."
"This is now my favorite beer. It's so light and refreshing yet strong enough to kick your butt. I like to drink a bit colder at first because I like to watch this beer bloom in my hands. It's nice colder and then as it warms up it brings out gorgeous flavours. It becomes so brilliant after warming up with a full bouquet of spices. Though not overly spiced. Just a fantastic beer. I describe this like I describe fine chocolate, there is some that you give to your friends and there is some you give to the ones you really love. This is a beer to be had with someone worthy!"
"Served from a large bottle, I think it was 750 ml. Pours a clear and shiny golden orange color with a white head that lasts through the whole glass. Very good head retention. The aroma is spicy and fruity, sweet malty scent and apple peel. The flavor is crisp with a sweet malt flavor as the base. Flavors of apple and wild berries comes through as well. Very gentle on the palate with no flavors being too bold or overpowering. Very enjoyable drink."
"The carbonation and the alcohol finish keep this beer from breaking into my favorites, but it is a nice beer with some nice flavour to it. I'm glad I have a second bottle to sample later."
"Drinkability- Can't tell it's got an 8% abv. Hasn't hit me yet and I had two of them. Very tasty and possibly even better in the bottle."
"Those Belgians might be totally nuts, but when it comes to strong brews that resembles of nothing else, look no further!"
"Pours a light golden with a huge blooming head that leaves big globs of lace down the glass,big spicey aroma peppery and yeasty a touch of smoke and orange.Yeasty up front on the palate with a spritzey lemon note with the spiciness more subdued compared to the aroma,pretty refreshing for a beer with such a high alcohol content.A well made Tripel worthy of high marks."
"Remarkably smooth and drinkable for a tripel. My girlfriend remarked it instantly reminded her of a riesling and I agreed. I didn't find it very textured or layered, but it some respects that was refreshing. Simply put it is a very enjoyable slightly sweet straight forward tripel."
"Beautiful offering that settles and filibusters its way through the synapses."
"This is a great beer that was a treat to consume. I have been drinking so many German style beers lately that I almost forgot how satisfying a good Tripel can be."
"Small Belgian style bottle, classy looking label. A best before date was on the label, but it was too faded/washed away to decipher. Poured into a super nice looking tripel Karmeliet glass, very clear and golden, luxorious and stately looking. White head, nicely developed lacing. Nutty nose, very fruity, lemony,yeasty and spicy stuff. Snappy dry finish, intense flavors, simply lovely stuff. Seek and enjoy."
"Tasting this beer blind in a tripeltasting I was more ore the less disappointed of it. A smell that is only koreander and paradijszaad, and it was tasting like a (cheap) parfum. Hardly any bitterness and nothing that a lover of belgium ( trappist) tripels( like me) would try again... strangely enough this beer came out second in the tasting so there must be a lot of people that like it.... but not me!"
"For $6.99 a bottle -- what a bargain!!!"
" A nicely crafted tripel."
"749"
"Fairly clear golden body with abundant carbonation and a monstrous foamy white Belgian-style head. Orange citrus and spice plus some esters, but not too dominating. Some bubble gum comes through more in the flavor than aroma. Honey is a dominating element in the flavor. More sweetness than Ive recognized in other Tripels. Very smooth."
"This is a special beer, that when served on tap becomes even more special. A nice beer to celebrate my birthday eve!"
"Drinkablility: Highly drinkable - both as a special treat with a meal, a night cap with a book, or a crazy drunken feast of Dionysus sesh."
"The taste is very smooth, light and airy in the mouth but deep in character. Dangerously drinkable and well-rounded, this is easily the best tripel I've had in recent memory, and quite possibly ever. Simply excellent."
"Absolutely Superb, a definitive Belgium Tripel."
"I finally got my hands on one of these, although I had to go to the west coast to do so. Poured from a slender 330 ml brown bottle, best before date on back is 19/08/05. A stunning slightly hazed pure golden body, this tripel seems to emanate an inner light of its own. Smallish foamy white cap for a head, which maintains itself most of the way down the glass. Sweet fresh apricots appear on the nose at first, accompanied by coriander seed, mild pepper, and wheat. Starts off like a wit, but the orchard fresh apricots appear immediately after that, blending with mild spices towards the finish. A sweet tangerine/madarin orange character starts to develop as this warms up. An enchanting mouthfeel, like soul kissing an angel. At 8% abv one doesn't even come close to noticing the alcohol presence, this is such a smooth ale. Something to definitely keep on hand for when the mood strikes, it is an absolute delight to experience. The Carmelite tradition is most certainly a worthwhile one."
"Dusty golden-orange in color with only a tiny layer of thin white head atop. Sparse lacing. Aromas are boisterous! A rainbow of fruity aromas leap out of the glass. Bannanas, oranges, lemony zest mixed with a honey-wheat character. Flavor falls just short of the smell. Big on the fruit flavors as well, there's only a dash of bitterness for pseudo-balance. Definite doughy/bready flavors as well, finishing with a lemon-honey aftertaste. Medium-bodied. Definitely a dessert beer, this one is far to the sweet side."
"This beer is like the girl you met at the beach as a teenager.. You saw her pour into the ocean. Her golden blonde hair going under just as a wave crashes over her and capped with huge white cap of foam on top.. eventually the blonde shines through again. Later you walk by her on the Boardwalk she smells of light spicy earth and perfume. you work up the nerve to finally address her and her kiss tastes of good light bread, a touch of light brown sugar, citrus a bit of apple and spice... The taste lingers on your lips and gets deeper some how warming you like that first shot of brandy your uncle gave you. Your mouth feels clean and warm after you walk home... The taste leave you wanting more and more.. THis is one hell of a beer that proves that its not only the Monks that are brewing kick ass beers in Belgium. I hope this stuff comes back on tap soon in the area."
"Had A range of experience by letting it warm aggressive mouthfeel.Beautiful lacing and honey pale gold. Particular spice including pepper, cariander wasn't for me but ameloriated by various strong spicey food. Tip off cap to Malto. Had a bottle another 2 years later and hit the spot again. Had a bottle 7.5 years later and lots of candi and fruit, this one aged for 5 years."
"One of the richest triples I've had...very much a dessert brew, and a 11.2 oz bottle is about enough for me, although I would gladly drink this in the future. Quality brew, and one of the finer triples I've had. Recommended."
"I'm very happy to have found this on tap."
"The flavors hinted at by the aroma are there on the tongue with citus and pepper the overriding forces. A very nicely balanced beer with little to no bitter quality at all even though the hops are predominant in flavor (little to no malty quality)."
"Pretty light in the mouth with a truckload of carbonation. Scratchy going down, leaving your wondering why you should be trying to mouth it down."
"Flavor is a mouthful! Mostly sweet again with apple, nutmeg some biscuity hints and a touch of clove I think. The finish reveals a white grape presence. Definately a lot going on there. Quite a tasty brew. I get a little alcohol warming on the end as well. Very nice!"
"Served amber with a huge head!! Spicey withh some alcohol notes. There are thin malts with a crisp bite for balance. A very well crafted beer, but not a beer for me if other tripels are around. Or good beers of other styles for that matter."
"Mouthfeel is effervescent on the front of the tongue, smooth, medium-bodied. A good drinkable beer, very smooth, flavorful with a nice citrusy/spice taste that hangs out comfortably all over afterwards."
"A beautiful beer in a beautiful bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a medium sized white head and slight carbonation. Aroma- a marvelous blend of Belgian yeast earthiness nicely balanced with sweetness and fruit (lemon, banana) and spices (vanilla and others). Flavor is not incredibly complex, but very nicely balanced. One of the sweeter tripels (which I like) that has a nice smooth sharpness at the end. Flavors include sweet lemon, honey, flowers, vanilla, banana, and some grains (banana nut bread may be a good comparison). This brew is incredibly well balanced!"
"Golden color with a nice size head. Nice appearance. There is a lot of lambic-like aroma and a bit of sour taste as well. An interesting beer, just not what I expected out of a tripel. It leaves too much of a sour apple taste that just doesn't make me care to drink any more."
"Beer is good. Happy belgian beering."
"I gave this enthusiastic 4.5+ marks at the end of a marathon tasting last week. Now that I try it again I wonder if this is a case of bottle variation (the former notes from 750ml - this time from a 12 oz.) or beer-judging fatigue. The latter always seems to favor extreme, alcoholic and sweet styles like this."
"Poured clear and golden with tons of carbination. Nice, fluffy beaten eggwhite head. Scents of chardonnay and white grapes. The carbination bites you tongue. Vineous taste, almost champangne. Citrus and freshness. Front of the label at first makes me think, great another one in german where I can't learn anything about the beer just by looking, but like I keep telling my beerbuddy, blitheringidiot, ""find the freaking website if ya need to know"". There is a bit of info on the back though. Decent taste but just a bit too sweet for me to have more than one..."
"taste is really delicate. no overpowering alcoholic rush at all. a nice horsebarn yeastiness is evident, hinting at lambic-like flavors. spicy and hoppy notes came around and just blew me away. not a big, over-the-top beer, but insanely complex grassy, flowery and spicy notes. the body of this one is so light and effervescent that i really think it could almost stand up to champage as an aperitif. a very poetic drink. i highly highly highly recommend the karmeliet. if you want a super complex beer, this is the one."
"Pours a cloudy orangeish gold under a one finger white head that featured lots of big bubbles and disappeared quickly, leaving no lace. That's not at all what I look for in a Tripel. The nose is full of sweet candy sugar, with a touch of either anise or Grand Marnier Orange. The mouth is very prickly and light, like a heck of a lot of other beers. The taste features the sweet of candy and fruit liquer, with lots of sweet Belgian yeast to remind that this is a beer. The finish includes a crisp hoppy bite (OK, now I know it's beer), while the aftertaste recalls sweet fruitiness and fruity bitterness (a la cranberries). It's good, but there are many much better."
"World class. Aside from Allagash, I cannot think of a Tripel that compares."
"paid $2.99 for the small bottle"
"Overall Impression: A very tasty brew. The balance is strongly to the sweet, so this is much like a candy; not to be gobbled, but slowly nibbled for maximum enjoyment."
"Great beer, try again and again. If I try more belgians, maybe this will have to be updated but until then... I drink."
"Well, this beer was originally raised as a toast to my (soon-to-be) alma mater, California University of PA, and our women's basketball team winning the Div II national champion, but tonight we discovered that one of our favorite craft beer bars changed to a tacky beach theme, so we also raised it as a toast to our old place as well. A nice, flowery, sweet tripel that's definitely a new personal favorite in the style, and one I hope to see in Southwestern PA shortly."
"Overall Impression: I know this is one of the more ""mainstream"" beers in Belgium, but I think it's quite good despite that. Hadn't had one in a long timem, so I had kind of forgotten how good it is. The only detracting factor is that it is quite gassy (lots of burps) and the sweetness tends to stack up a bit and become almost cloying after a while."
" This is incredibly complex, and supremely enjoyable. I will definitely be getting some more bottles of this, as I fear I may have underrated it on my first sampling."
"A golden color with a slightly creamy head that made the first sip really pleasurable. Sweet citric aromas abound. The taste was what the smell made me guess it was: very citric, lemons, oranges and a nice sweetness that took of the tart that you could expect with the citrus. I could stick to that beer for the night. I only had a bottle thoughI'll get this one again."
"Very enjoyable beer. Really interesting. Golden copper in color. Pours with a nice medium white head. Fruity nose. Like fresh fruit. Really good. Medium body. Great beer. This is my second time having it and it is still a great beer. I would go by it again."
"33 cL bottle best before 2/05. Pours a bronzy golden color with a big, rocky white head. Spicy, clovey aromas mixed with some peppery, honey-like smells. Quite inviting. Rather sweet initially, then shifting towards a more lemony, drier finish. I like this triple a lot; it's very complex. A touch too sweet, but awfully drinkable."
"Huge Fluffy head with tons of aroma. There were wonderful hints of citrus and malt. The initial taste is actually kind of sour, but it gets sweeter as it goes down. There is almost a candy-like aftertaste. This is a very carbonated brew with tons of flavors rushing through. This is a wonderful Abbey tripel from Belgium."
"I finally had a chance to try this brew at Anam Cara, and was extremely pleased. From what I could tell in the glow of the fireplace it had a nice golden color, and a surprisingly nice head (not too carbonated, just right.) Strong fruity flavor, easily drinkable, super smooth, peach and caramel aroma. I am partial to sweet\strong beers (Tripels and Barleywines) so if you are not you might find this beer a little too sweet, however if you are a fan of Belgian Tripels I'm certain you will enjoy this beer."
"A wonderful brew! The beer flows into the glass leaving a wonderful head. Large bubbles create a fluffy white layer of foam. The bubbles stay with you throughout the entire beer giving the high carbonation I know and love in bottled beer from Belgium. The color is an exceptional light blonde color with outstanding clarity. The nose is fruity with spicy notes. The taste is bright and clean with a wonderful sensation of CO2 dancing on your tongue. Not a session beer due to its alcohol content but its tempting. :-)"
"Easy to drink given its weight and all the flavors packed inside. A classy, classic tripel whose attention is well-deserved. Good on tap, but preferred in the bottle."
"Pours with a bubbly white head that diminishes pretty quickly to a thin lace that, in turn, lasts for quite a long time. The body is a golden amber and is almost clear with just a slight haze. Lots of carbonation is bubbling to the top. Quite a strong aroma that is slightly doughy and sweet. Some honey is noticeable on the nose as are spices  coriander, clove, and maybe nutmeg? Nice smooth sweet start with a honey sweetness that lasts throughout. Some notes of bubblegum and banana are also noticeable. A fluffy carbonation comes in mid swallow followed with noticeable spices and a slightly tart finish. Slightly warming on the swallow. Nice brew and fairly complex, yet its a bit on the sweet side. Id like to try this one again, but there are other Belgians that Ive enjoyed more that might temp me again before this one."
"This beer reminded me why I like Belgian beers so much. Had on tap at Redbones. Color was faded golden, slightly cloudy. A fluffy, creamy white head perched on tap. My notes say ""aroma is full of promise."" I detected some musty, but still spicey notes, with even a whiff of perfume to top things off. Medium bodied, there is an abundance of fruit, with sweetness, crisp citrus, and then a finish of dusty cinnamon. And so smooth! A very delicious brew to be savored. Highly recommended. pat"
"served on tap at redbones in a small stemmed glass. nice puffy white head. aromas of earthy yeast and fruit. quite complex in the nose. taste was just as amazing- citrus, belgian malt, caramel and yeast. medium to full body. this was a wonderful find and one that i will seek out in the future."
"After I loosened the wire cage around the cork on this 750ml bottle of this beer it shot away with a loud ""pop," the carbonation pushing out some of the beer with it. Luckily, not too much escaped. This is a beautiful beer. I wish I had the glass designed for this beer so it would be displayed as it was meant to be displayed, especially since the glass for this beer is equally beautiful. Since I don't, I picked something close enough from my collection for smelling and tasting purposes and gave it a go. A huge rocky head forms very quickly on this beer, so a gentle pour is required. Below this massive white fluffy cloud of bubbles is an orangish straw-colored brew. Big splotches of lace are left on the sides of the glass. The aroma is full of complexities, including wheaty and oatmeal characteristics, yeast spiciness, vanilla, orange frosting, and what i'd describe as a tea bag aroma with some hints of medicinal herb. Very creamy on the palate with a good amount of carbonation. Complex flavors meet every taste bud in a different way. A sweetness from the combined barley, wheat, and oats is the main characteristic of this brew. It has complexity in itself from these 3 grains used in the brewing of this elixir. Orange-like yeast spiciness compliments the sweetness perfectly along with a medicinal character and a tinge of vanilla and bubble gum. This certainly is an amazing beer. One of the best tripels I've tasted, and certainly the most unique. Very well-balanced and great in every aspect."
"Crystal clear copper color with huge long lasting white head. Great lacing and a steady stream of bubbles. Malty and sweet aroma with orange and lemon. Crisp mouthfeel from the strong carbonation. Dry finish. Very well balanced bitterness keep the sweetness in line."
"Unmanageably huge, rocky head. Golden-yellow in color with very attractive CO2 streamers decorating the interior of the glass. The nose consisted of sour-ish pear and some candy sugar. Granny smith apple start to the taste, followed by pale Belgian malt and warming alcohol peppered with, well, pepper and some phenols. Good fruitiness and cleansing carbonation. Well done. I havent had this one earlier because it was something that was so common that I always said some other time. Im glad some other time rolled around."
"Feel is a solid medium body with a wierd smoothness thats hard to fathom, but reminded me of light soup. Whats with the soup aspects of this beer? Buttery-like smoothness that actually has a nice hold of carbonation that seems to fit the citrusy sweetness and the finish has a subtle complexity of things portrayed in the smell. Politely skipping across is a lime-like twinge left on the lips after each sip. One hell of an interesting Triple, this is more of what I look for from a Triple other then a mega hefe profile of clove and yeast thats been multiplied. This was very interesting and now I am left wondering if its like this all the time. Reviews of this seem to be widely diverse so I will definately get some more soon and try again to make sure this is something that continues to comes across as the same. Either way; this bottle was all Yum!!"
"Nice presentation with a big glass with lily flowers drawn on. Hazy olden color with a pretty fine white head, rather large, but it doesnt stay up its throne long. Superb aroma of flowers and fruits. I'm really tempted. Very complex flavor developments in mouth. I can't count all those fruits: orange, banana, apples, lemon. Was that butter? Spicy, yeasty. Refreshing tartness spreading out, more hops than most triples. Comfortable medium mouthfeel that bites the tongue a bit when too fresh, it's so easy to drink it's not even funny. Pleasant aftertaste. Almost ridiculously complex. The perfect type of beer I wish to have more once I'm done with the first bottle. Delicious, the best tripel I've had up to now. Two thumbs up."
"The taste was slighlty sweet, spicy and bitter. Well balanced. Slightly dry on the tongue and during the aftertaste. The bitterness also rode the tongue for a bit. The alcohol level was not very noticeable making this an extremely drinkable belgian tripel. I was so pleased I had another..."
"YUMMY!"
"Drinkability: the beer itself is decent....alittle better than average maybe. But it is the glass that makes me want to try another."
"Tasted on draft at Cafe Botteltje in Ostend. Appearance: Big, creamy head, orange color, crystal clear. Aroma; Hops, malty, very clean. Flavor: Malt dominates; does not taste as hoppy or as dry as the bottled version. Finish: Clean and very crisp. Again, not as dry as bottles."
"The warmer this beer became, the better it tasted in my opinion. It poured a large sized white frothy, creamy head that contained fine sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was cloudy with lively carbonation and a golden hue. The nose was fruity, spicy, coriander and some clove. The flavor was fruity, sweet, some spiceness and smooth. The mouthfeel was a little tingly, smooth and bubbly with a thin texture. It was light bodied with good lacing."
"Typical triple appearance, slightly opaque and a golden color with a nice fluffy head. Lots of citrus and yeast overtones, cloves and spices intermingling quite nicely. A very drinkable concoction that will not disappoint in the least. Highly recommended.."
"No thanks for this one. I thought this one was waaay to sweet. It had the similar elements of most Belgians, but much more sweeter. I also noticed the ever present element of skunk, which was present in the taste, as well as the smell. I was not happy with this one and just consider this one a mark in the ""L" column."
"IMHO: A well balanced triple with no big surprises, and is subtly complex. Karmeliet has a great combination of flavors and smooth transitions."
"Blonde/orange color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, floral and fruity (peaches and bananas). Medium bodied tripel. Malty, yeasty and bright. Herbal hoppiness. Touch of barnyard. Touch of dryness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Nice beer."
"My rating is for a 75cl corked green bottle. This one opened like champagne and poured just the same with a high carbonation and a champagne like head. The head settles down to a creamy dense froth and rests there the duration. Lacing is subtle and scattered inside the glass in various places. Tiny streams of bubbles rise gallantly from the bottom of the glass throughout the session. Aroma is fruity and spicy with a subtle earthiness to it. The mouthfeel is like a comfortable pillow, smooth and delicate with a warming finish. Flavor is as complex as any good Tripel I've had and the use of three grains enhances the complexity even more. Fruity, earthy sweet and a full complex malt flavor. This bottle was good to the very last drop and I enjoyed it completely. Thanks JohnnyDuvel :)"
"Nice-looking right from the bottle, with a hazy orange/peach color and a medium-thin white head. Good lace. Aroma is largely tropical fruit with a hint of yeast. The flavor is quite full, with a big, well-rounded fruit flavor, and just a hint of vanilla and banana in the end. A very nice tripel, which stood up to the pizza I ate it with and would do quite nicely on its own."
"This tripel poured a clear, golden color with towering white foam that was long lasting and clung to the glass. The smell was fruity (orange) with notes of candy sugar and malt, and was very pleasant to sniff. The taste was mildly sweet and fruity with a bit of candy sugar and some alcohol detected. The mouthfeel was smooth and light on the tongue and was a bit warming. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. A very nice and enjoyable tripel."
"First off, the head was much better and showed good retention. After tasting and reviewing a boatload of Tripels (OK, 42 to date) I really appreciated the rank odor and sharp flavors of this Bosteel offering. I jacked nearly all of the scores up my 0.5 point and hogged the entire champagne bottle to myself."
"Whoa, this is a nice beer, if it is indeed a beer. Tastes a lot like champagne, but most Tripels do. Lots of complexity and strong alcohol taste but not overpowering by any means. Ripe fruits come and go. Other malts are there with some non-bitter hops. Slightly spicy and refreshing finish. This would be great for celebrating something with or sharing with a girl. Well, not as good as a flavored lambic, but close."
"Drinkability/notes: A wonderful beer, perhaps best suited for dessert, its strong, spicy character might prove daunting if consumed as a session beer."
"Flavor: It has a rich, sweet taste w/ some yeastiness."
"Clear yellow, it looks a bit like a US lager with a fat, foamy white head. A strong citrus, somewhere between lemon and orange, is most immediately noticeable in the smell. The taste is strongly citric and a bit astringent. The alcohol is fairly well hidden. The taste is nice but many tripels surpass it."
"Golden-yellow in color with a thick white head. The aroma is herbal and medicinal, fruity with lemony-citrus aromas. It has the fresh hay smell like some lambics. The flavor has a fruity sweetness with the lemon flavors, I also get the medicinal, fresh flavors. It is a medium-full bodied beer, but smooth and easy drinking, with a slight dry bitter finish."
"Strong golden colour, with oranged reflexes, a lot of creamy and white foam. The smell is very fresh, herbaceous and floreal (roses?), with cream, cereals (oats). Fizzy (maybe a little too much), with a round taste, but ""simple", without the complexity of the smell. Maybe lightly tannic-wood. The body is medium and round, with a good hop. We found a clear difference between two glasses, one with the bottom (yeast) of the bottle, and the other without it. In the first it was noticeable even some solvent..."
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber with an enormous white head. It takes a bit to get this into a standard bee glass because is big and bold. Finally it diminishes and leaves light lace from the ring. Nice nose yeast and malt. Lovely flavor that bounces the palate up and down like trampoline. Hints of honey, spicy clove accent, sweetness, some bittering elements, all set against a full body with decent feel and great crispness. Quite a brew, what?"
"This is a wonderful beer. Light, frothy, spicy, sweet."
"Pours golden amber in color with a tall pillowy white head that leaves thick sheets of lace on the walls of the glass as it dissipates. Nose is sweet honey with notes of fresh wheat, vanilla, and lemony citrus. Medium to full in body with a spritzy mouthfeel due to all the active carbonation. Taste is sweet and fruity up front with notes of pineapple, mango, and apricot followed by some peppery papaya. Little hop bitterness is present but there are some drying notes of grains and alcohol towards the finish. A complex and very tasty beer!"
"This beer feels like a nice cotton on your tongue. A little more hearty tasting than other classic Belgian tripels, due to the peculiar use of oats as well as the typical malt and hops. Hate to invoke Mr. Beer Micheal Jackson, but he called it full of finesse and complexity  he is dead right on. Easily a leader in its style, I gotta have another to catch it all. Have one if you pick up on subtlety and enjoy it!!"
"Musty malt nose. Gold color with lots of little tiny bubbles in the goblet. A nice 1/4 to 1/2 inch white head results from the pour. Musty malty taste with and aftertaste of burnt corriander and apricot. Smooth medium mouth. A solid Tripel and at 8% quite drinkable."
"The body is surprisingly yummy: oily and with a slight viscosity to mitigate the airiness. Michael Jacksons Great Beers of Belgium (Running Press 1998) claims that the beer is heavily spiced, but annoyingly fails to elaborate. Still, I can taste the spices, which paradoxically dont contribute to the spiciness of this brewthe yeast takes care of that. I can also taste the classic Belgian sourness in the back of the mouth. However, through the annoying flavors of coriander, the fluffy body and the sour finish, I can find some really intriguing aspects of this beer. The oats seem to be the biggest difference between this and other Tripels. The slick creaminess that they impart is really unique and quite appealing. They even helped me see past the coriander enough to score this beer highly. Kudos to Bosteels for making Belgian beers that dont just taste like all the other Belgian beers. While I like Kwak more, Karmeleit is one that I can thoroughly appreciate, even if I wouldnt drink it again. Still, my irrational hatred of coriander should not dissuade any other BAs from trying this unique, exceptionally well made beer."
"There's a very nice, spicy smell, full of sweet fruit. The front specializes that fruit to apples, I think. Sweet and spicy. Then malt. The finish is just a little syrupy, but still manages to be fresh. Some alcohol is noticeable in the aftertaste. This probably isn't the most interesting tripel, but it sure isn't far off."
"I love this one. Poors a nice deep cloudy golden color. Head has bigger bubbles than I would expect, but settles to a nice tight head although not much of one. The smell and taste are very compatible - both have a nce mixture of fruit and spices. Considering the ABV, there is no alcohol taste - just citrus and spices, with a yeast undertone. This make for an excellent dessert beer or on a hot, mid-summer day. Although, I prefer to drink this one all year round."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Pours deep hazy bright golden orange in color, has a huge white frothy lasting head. Fruity and spicy wet cardboard aromas. Fruity buttery and spicy yeasty flavors. Somewhat sticky but crisp finish. Full bodied with lively carbonation full but crisp mouthfeel, alcohol is hardly noticed, a great tripple."
"Unfortunately, this happy ride was all-too brief, for the otherwise unredoubtable pub poured a meager 8 ounces. Geez, guys, I'd pay an extra $.50 for another 2 ounces, and willingly, too!"
"Pours a hazy yellow with an enormous head, so big I had to let it settle a little while. The head lasts through the glass, and ample lacing as well. First aroma caught me by surprise, fruit, but not sweet. Grapefruit and sour aromas. The taste was acidic, with alcohol up front and a slight dried fruit mouthfeel. Clean dry finish though, with hints of spices coming out. Didn't see this one coming, a fine ale, I just wasn't crazy about it."
"The pour a deep golden amber color, with a magisterial head, the texture creamy and the lace formed is a thick sticky sheet to smother the glass. Ripe fruit like pineapple comes to mind, malt, fresh and clean to the nose, and the start quite sweet with a medium in feel top. Vinous and astringent finish with the hops sparse, but still noticeable the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. All things considered a decent drinking beer and well worth the price of a sample."
"Golden copper color. Big and bubbly white head that has good retention. Appearance indicates a high level of carbonation. Really nice doughy, yeasty aroma. And smoke. I get a definitive smoke aroma which surprises me a little bit. Some banana like esters make their presence known right off the bat. A little bubblegum as well. A very light phenolic presence. Finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied. Enjoyable and drinkable."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice bubbly white head that left some circular lace as it slowly subsided.  Some carbonation is present.  An aroma of citrus and grain.  A flavor of citrus and grain with a hint of clove present.  A bit of tanginess to the body no doubt brought on by the carbonation.  A good beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy, pale gold with just a hint of an amber tint.  Huge amounts of carbonation apparent in the body that feeds the thick, creamy head.  Long lasting head, that leaves quite a bit of lace clinging to the glass.  Aroma of tart citrus blends with a spicy, but not quite peppery, smell.  Very grainy taste, with plenty of fruit and spice flavors adding complexity.  The blend of grains is very apparent - the oats and wheat seem to stand out above the barley.  Finish is rather grassy and a bit bitter, with accompanying hints of berry-like fruit.  Aftertaste has a nice lingering dose of alcohol, along with a dry, tart fruitiness. Carbonation gives this beer a fairly rough feel.  Very drinkable brew.  I'll have to experiment with food pairings..."
"The tremendous, forceful pop upon releasing the cork starts off another Belgian Tripel experience.  After a gentle pour, a dense, very thick, soft peak beaten egg white head sits atop a clear golden hued brew, if decanted off the sediment.  Beautiful heterogenous melange of sheets of bubbles interconnected by lace down the glass.  Tart citrus fruitiness comprised of lemon and unripe orange hit the nose at first, then are ensued by rounder and sweeter tropical notes akin to ripe pineapple.  When combined with the sweet fruit notes, the mild green apple acetaldehyde and alcohol take on a ripe jackfruit like character.  Subdued clove adds an herbal accompanient to the overall fruity aroma.  Honey like sweetness hits the palate initially, then is ensued by a light wheat tartness and soft white bread graininess.  Sweetness then mirrors the aroma mid palate, and becomes fruity and kiwi like in nature.  Persistent, mellow clove maintains an herbal undertone to this brew.  Hop bitterness is indirectly perceived by its well calculated contrast to malt sweetness.  Moderately bodied and fairly well attenuated, but with a full dextrinous mouthfeel derived from the oats in the grist.  Finishes dry, with trace phenol and residual sweetness briefly lingering.  Karmeliet is an assertively fruity tripel and is certainly unique and absolutely delicious.  Robust, yet refined and soft on the palate... drink up!"
"Triple Karmeliet: On tap.  Fantastic!  The triple refers to three grains: barley, oats, and wheat.  Highly carbonated, very nice head.  Aroma vaguely smells of oranges, and coriander.  The taste is sweet/yeast taste, and pressed oranges, with a perfectly balanced Belgian taste.  This is a very, very good beer: on tap, it is one of the five best beers I’ve ever had."
"11.2 oz. bottle. Just another very good Belgian trippel... yawn. Not that that's a bad thing. This one's got all the typical attributes of a fine trippel. Champagne-like level of carbonation. Full of crisp, fruity, yeasty goodness. Can't go wrong here, IMHO."
"Notes: Quite the alcoholic brew, big boisterous and complex. Perhaps over the top but still a brew to reckon with. A good cheese pairing would be with a nice creamy Danish Blue and some rye crackers."
"Bottle was monstrously charged, a full 12 oz volume of foam during a careful pour. Hazy yellow, yeasty, fruity aroma. Chunky. Lemony citric notes stand out over the oats and barley also used. Flavor profile is upfront with a consistent fade. If you pour to the back of the mouth, its seems estery and fuller. Too astringent, overcarbonated, and champagne-like for me, it crosses that ""Belgian Tripel"" line that my tastes buds don't want to. Could be higher alcohol refresher for some. Respectably brewed."
"A very good tripel, had a unique taste with a good bitterness on the finish, not to sweet also, which i count as a good thing."
"Very sweet with loads of carbonation. Fruity, but with a kick.  Yeast is clearly present,but the sweetness of this beer slightly overpowers it.  In adding to this review, I tried it agian 9/8/02 and found it sort of dry, with some very noticeable grain flavors- of which I cannot readily identify.  This was a smoother brew then before, but remains sweet.  You can really taste and smell some sort of crystal like sugar."
