Since then I've had it now and again, revisiting bottles from time to time including some more than five years old; my experiences have been this beer does not age gracefully. But this fresh bottle of Abbey Triple wonderfully showcases Belgian yeast and the juxtaposition of both subtle and powerful fruity and spicy components brought about wholly by fermentation. Abbey Triple is a lovely beer that's also dangerously drinkable.","BeerFMAndy","Apr 26, 2014"

The smell of the beer is where I would expect a tripel except there is a hint of caramel which I does not belong. It ends up making the beer taste sweet and, I believe, gives it a viscous mouthfeel. An excellent tripel would be drier than this, which registers with me merely as an interesting Belgian style ale that comes up lacking in the deadly deceitful drinkability that a tripel should have.","pweis909","Mar 16, 2014"

The yeast-forward approach is nice here, and the beer is very attenuated and refreshing. The acidity of the flavor could be toned down some- which is maybe suggestive of hotter fermenation temps.","Ricelikesbeer","Feb 27, 2014"

3.68,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"16 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 1/28/2011. Pours hazy deep orange amber color with a fairly dense 1 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Decent spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of apple, grape, banana, caramel, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, bread, honey, and spicy yeast esters. Pretty nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity; they were slightly offensive at first but got a lot better as it warmed up. Taste of pear, apple, banana, caramel, candi sugar, honey, herbal, clove, bread, and light spicy yeast. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, candi sugar, honey, herbal, clove, and light yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Pretty good complexity and balance of flavors; with no cloying sweetness at all surprisingly. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Tripel with a pretty unique flavor profile. It could use some more carbonation and spiciness to balance out the malty fruitiness; but overall it is still quite enjoyable and easy to drink.","superspak","Jul 08, 2012"

Mouthfeel and taste are more like a Belgian Strong Ale than a Triple; it feels more fragile and brittle than the fluffy head and body I would have expected. Alcohol comes to the fore upon warming, a little overwhelming. Overall, better than I remember it being. I'm wondering if when they switched from 16 to 12 oz. bottles if they didn't tweek the recipe a bit. Definitely worth a spin for those whose palates have not become too spoiled by the top shelf stuff.","anglagard1","Aug 03, 2011"

The taste holds the above, as well as ginger, coriander, and a pinch o' nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish.

The taste was of honey and ginger with hints of lemon behind them. the higher alcohol level was a bit apparent in the taste by causing a slight bitterness on the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel was a nice crispness that was accentuated by the higher levels of carbonation in the beer, yet it still remained light on the palate. Overall it was an easy-going tripel style beer but at 16oz a pop, definitely a one per night deal.

Anyways it tastes like a dessert beer, nothing wrong with that just don't call it an Abbey Triple. Carbonation was fine just the body was filled with residual sugars alcohol clearly evident just not the beer I'm lookin for.

Fresh and light attack, but it instantly goes into a heavy and malty presentation. The flavor is heavy and malty and the mouthfeel is consistent with this as well. There is a mild sweetness imparted upon the beer by its heavy malt concentration. The finish leaves the mouth dry with a mild bitterness at the finish.

The bubbles *seem* to be working their way to the head, which was off-white in color and about two fingers in height. The beer itself was a lovely tawny-bronze in hue, kind of coppery too. Head retention was fantastic; it was very slow to subside. I like active looking beers. Subsequent lacing was none but the head lasted forever thus keeping the attractive look. The nose is too clean for a Tripel. None of the aromas are loud. I get many suggestions from the bouquet like marshmallows, bubblegum, toasted grain, traces of spice and flowers (from hops?), and even some cereal. Is this really a Tripel? Without context the nose is okay, I wouldnt call it inviting. But for the style the nose is really lacking. Where are the Belgium qualities? Pathetic. The palate is fairly bland; it lacks the desired complexity, as it is far too clean. The taste is not Belgian; the palate offers cereal with grains and then some unpleasant sweetness that tries to mix with some fruity qualities like melon. For a fleeting moment the beverage becomes tasty and then the beer turns average again as some trace spiciness enters along with some flowers. I also get random flavors like bubblegum and marshmallows. There is nothing awful about this beer but really, is this a Tripel? It is insipid with flavors that are not in harmony. Medium-light in body with tight but active carbonation, the mouthfeel is decent but thin, empty. Clean aftertaste. Sure, this is drinkable but it is pointless to quaff. I mean, why bother?

3.06,-14.8,3,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Had this on the Sprecher tour. Had a hoppy fruity aroma a sweet and zingy honey taste which lingered thick on the tongue. There was an odd aftertaste I couldn't identify, perhaps some hops I had yet to experience. I'm not sure I totaly liked that, but if th bottled brew tastes like this, I'll try it again.","grynder33","May 28, 2003"
2.75,-23.4,3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This is a very odd Belgian Triple... pours a deep copper with a dissapointing head... no lace and little head retention. Aroma of banana and clove... no musty yeast character in the aroma or flavor. Flavor has a dominant caramel tone, with some banana in the background. Medium carbonation and a thin to medium body. Overall, this beer is a great letdown... I would recommend almost any other Triple I've had over this one.","zerk","Dec 24, 2002"
3.25,-9.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Abbey Triple pours a clear amber with a fizzy off-white head that disappears fairly fast. Plenty of carbonation visible from the multitide of bubbles in the body. The aroma consists of cloves, peppery yeast, malt, orange or tangerine and a hint of cherry. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. The taste lacks the complexity of a good tripel. Initial fruity flavor and yeast dominate. Finishes with a biscuity malt and alcohol taste. Overall pretty drinkable, but not the best example of a true tripel.","Winter","Mar 30, 2002"
3.45,-3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a deep golden color that's quite beautiful in the glass. The only question I have is, where's the head? For an abbey triple, it's almost nonexistent. Smell is of clove and banana, as would be expected. Taste is similar, with notes of fruit, spices, a touch of alcohol and yeast all making their presence known. Mouthfeel is quite drab for the style. Carbonation, like the head, just isn't there. Fairly easily drinkable, this beer isn't all bad, but it's certainly not up to par in its particular category.","Jon","Mar 25, 2002"
3.06,-14.8,2,3.5,3,3,3,"I'm no expert on this style, but I expected more head and carbonation. It does have a rich, royal gold apperance to it, but the lack of carbonation was interesting. On the nose, I thought this rated pretty well...bananna's and cloves. The taste seemed very sweet at first and then settled down...Tasted like a strong wheat beer actually...pretty smooth and drinkable but I was expecting something a little different from this...Belgian ttriples are not my thing, so I may be off on this, but it didn't seem the same as the few others I've had in this style.","ZAP","Beers"
2.78,-22.6,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Pale color.  Fruity nose.  Yeasty, fruity taste.  Very thin body.  Light taste.  Kind of a refreshing beer, although I'm not sure that is the intent of a Belgian Tripel.  Some small hints of alcohol.  I'm not a Belgian Beer expert by any means.  (I've probably had a total of about 20-25 Belgian beers in my life.)  But this seems pretty bland compared to some of the others I've had.  I'm glad I only have one more of these.","Bighuge","0"
