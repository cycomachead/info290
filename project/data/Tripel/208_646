Some sediment from the bottle made it into the glass. Aroma is fruity with pears, white grapes, tangerines, some white pepper and just a hint of skunk that you would find in a green bottle Heineken. Flavor brings through much of the fruitiness with a huge bready, yeasty flavor towards the end. Flavor is huge, prominent and potent. Body is much of the same, big, bready, full-flavored, everything you would expect from a world class Belgian. All in all very different than most tripels that I have tried. This one drinks heavier and has a very strong bread yeast component. That being said, besides the hint of skunk I was getting on the nose, this one is a great example of what the tripel style can be.","stephenjmoore","Mar 24, 2015"

5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"I bought a case of this and have been drinking a couple of bottles a year. Its best to drink it within the first couple of years after bottling. On the more youthful bottles the nose is light fruit in various stages of ripeness mostly peach like but it becomes more like pineapple with traces of banana and then sherry as it ages. It pours straw gold with a slight haze under a 1” finely bubbled, rocky white foam cap. It has a fruit palate with peach and traces of bubble gum suspended in an outrageous texture halfway between liquid and foam that finishes with an assertive bitterness. The bitterness fades as it ages.","pat61","Mar 18, 2015"

Maybe the yeast was stirred up a bit? They all had this flavor I didn't quite like, a staleness which was a turn off. I couldn't quite understand why people kept calling this tripel one of the best. Today I had a bottle which was fantastic. This is what a tripel should be. Estery and dry, peppery aftertaste. The color is pale gold, nice white head with good retention. Improves as it warms. Not a fan of the initial smell but this too improves as the beer sits for a few minutes. Overall I loved this bottle, now I know what all the hype was about!","LordofthePings","Jan 26, 2015"

Aroma is a beautifully smooth blend of doughy yeast, dried fruit, flowers, oranges, spicy phenols, and sugar cookies.  A little alcohol hovers over it all, but isn't a distraction. The flavor follows the same plan and further highlights the artful blending of flavors that is bold, yet easy to handle.  Spicy, peppery yeast, apple, orange, flowers, and a soft pale malt sweetness all in a tidy, damn near crisp package.  Fluffy and dry, not wearing down the palate with sweetness or overbearing yeast...just very pleasant and drinkable for 9.5% ABV.  It's been too long since I've had one of these.","wedge","Sep 21, 2014"

I just finished that little bottle and I'm pretty sure I caught a decent buzz. Unfortunately, I feel like the alcohol presence becomes astringent and just too absrasive in this beer, which is really holding it back from a very high rating.

4.75,10.5,,,,,,"11.2 oz bottle in a chalice glass.  Yellow in color, with a thin head of foam, little lacing.  The Westmalle Dubbel is one of my favorite brews, so I had very high hopes for this one, and it didn't disappoint.  The sweet aroma of fresh fruit is top notch.  The taste hits with sweet, ripe banana initially, then rush of earthy spices and herbs that blends in with perfection.  The carbonation is excellent and the finish is hoppy but sweet, and very crisp.  The alcohol is surprisingly under control for a 9.5% ABV, and it seems to linger a bit in the background.  It's an amazingly engineered trippel.  It seems that every Trappist-style ale that comes out of Westmalle is liquid gold.  A must for any beer aficionado.","ENogueira","Sep 06, 2014"

Good carbonation, thick and creamy palate. Taste of fruits, maybe apricots, hints of tropical fruits, some citrus,almonds, spicy. Long dry finish.

Nevertheless, I figure that there are probably some IPA aficionados out there who would be intrigued at the opportunity to try a world-class ale and are wondering if they'd like it. My advice - if you like champagne, you'll love this ale. If you love hops, probably not.","DeanWormer","May 30, 2014"

Somehow, the monks at Westmalle have figured out how to up the ABV without altering the basic and delicious taste of a Belgian Ale. This beer is legendary for a reason and while it is not perfect -few things are-- it is certainly worth a purchase. In fact, if you are a fan of Belgian beers, you MUST try this Tripel!

Aroma of dry hay, yeasty banana esters, a bit of grassy hop, light spice. Flavor is hay, banana, yeast, lots of spices, dry grassy finish. Very much on the dry spicy side of the style, and I like it. Full bodied but finishes dry with high carbonation. Overall solid as expected, though not my favorite in the style as I like a tad more sweetness.","BMMillsy","May 03, 2014"

It didn't last long and the aftertaste was earthy and a bit fruity. I love Belgian Tripels so it is rare that I can score one average or lower.","BVukelich","Feb 08, 2014"

The presentation is about perfect. The smell hints at what's to come but doesn't spoil the surprise. The taste is sublime but is different from most tripels that I have had.

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, lemon, pepper, clove, banana, bread, candi sugar, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, floral, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, banana, clove, pepper, bread, candi sugar, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with an outstanding malt/spiciness balance with spiciness being over malt; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible tripel as expected. All around awesome complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. Completely outstanding.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

The after taste was the cause for concern. My girlfriend likened it to gasoline although I didn't mind too much. It does go straight to the sinuses and opens them up. Overall, I would recommend this beer.","mikefuski17","Aug 11, 2013"

When eaten with cheese, it is reminiscent of hop candy: sweet and floral.","ProblyAboutBeer","Feb 17, 2013"

The lacing is pretty welcoming too! The aroma is nice and complex, but no one smell is over powering. It’s light and floral overall with hints of citrus, malts, various grasses and an ever so mild alcohol smell. It’s got a medium-to-full mouth feel and is remarkably refreshing. The flavor is pretty good and is bitter overall, the spices and malts hit you up front almost as soon as you take a drink.

The first phase of the sip is a subdued version of what is to come: a snappy, fruity, bready combination that takes a second to hit full force but does so with impunity around the middle of the tongue. In some ways the taste is a bit more yeasty and bitter than the nose would suggest, but if you really dig for that miasma of spicy fruits, you'll find them in absolute harmony with the yeast and malts. Also worth noting is the ever-so-slight alcohol burn near the finish that is just enough to be consistently pleasing, especially in this season. Carbonation is fairly high and contributes to the "snappy" character of the beer, and it complements the smoothness of the brew perfectly.

4.73,10,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"75cl bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Westmalle Tripel is a hazy pale yellow beer with a moderate white head. The aroma is very yeasty, fresh and fruity (banana, citrus); very inviting. The beer is perfectly balanced between sweetness and bitterness. It's very refreshing, an ideal thirst quencher. Fruity and spicy accents. Moderately bitter finish. Excellent beer, one of my favorites.","Marc_V","Dec 04, 2012"

Roughly two inches of pure white, fluffy head develops; it leaves a nice, frothy coating on the glass as it settles. The aroma is of wheat, straw, white pepper, lemon citrus, a bit of tart orange, funky yeast, and some acidic apple notes. It tastes of light grains (straw, hay, wheat), some grass, lemon and orange citrus, sour apple, funky yeast, and a hint of clove. No surprises here, it tastes how you would expect from the aroma. The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and a hint acidic. A clean, but almost prickly finish from the carbonation livens it up.

Of course I was going to try all their style, but I ordered the Triple first. I was surprised that this was the only place in Belgium that asked if I wanted the beer "chilled" or "room" (cool). The best part of this beer is the smell, not that the taste isn't great. I could sniff this hay-scented beer all day. It reminds me of the fields that surround so many of the rural areas of Belgium. Besides the price, this is always a beer that I turn to if it appears on the menu.","paleoplant","Aug 13, 2012"

Taste very much follows the nose, but there are additional notes of fruit (apricot, cherry,) pepper, lemon, and a really nice yeast profile, its very clean and complex, and just a little creamy. It lingers on the tongue, very clean aftertaste. Despite the nice flavor profile, it isn't as sweet or rich as I would have expected and the alcohol content isn't hidden very well. The mouthfeel is very odd, bites the tongue initially with lots of fine carbonation then is gone right away with a lingering ghost of the flavor profile, which leads me to compare it to a very dry champagne in terms of mouthfeel.

On the nose there is yeast, pale malts, spice, and tart citrus with the hops downplayed. The body is medium to bold. The taste begins with an appealing yeasty and malty character than quickly morphs into a tart, peppery, dry hopped finish.

Smell- pears, sauvignon blanc grapes, dark fruits like prunes or raisins. Taste- so much going on here: sugar coated apricots, a sweet bready grain, nice sweet fruitiness.

While Tom Boonen’s victory for Belgium was fantastic, the Westmalle Tripel was not. No head developed, the aroma was thin and while the flavor was OK with tones of honey and almonds, there was not the complexity I was expecting from such a highly rated beer. The Westmalle Tripel was caramel in color and very hazy. The last glass from the bottle was near brown in color and thick with particulates. So maybe this bottle came from the bottom of the barrel, and not up to snuff. There were two dates on the label 7/1/2008 and 7/1/2010. I do not know what these dated referred to, but this bottle was purchased on 3/2012 and tasted on 4/2012, so another reason for the lackluster performance may be the age of this bottle. Anyway, I need to call them as I taste them, so the Westmalle will get a low score and one disappointed fan.","iSip","Apr 09, 2012"

4.25,-1.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow color with a monster meringue-like head. Aroma is very clean and fresh with notes of fresh cut grass, citrus fruit, and spice. Alcohol becomes more evident in the nose as it warms. Taste is a bready malt profile accented by lemon, apple, and spice. Noticeable grassy hop bite in the middle that diminishes in the finish leaving a dry yeasty aftertaste. Carbonation is very aggressive, even for the style, and could perhaps be toned down slightly. It has been a while since I've had this beer and I thoroughly enjoyed it this time around. A clean, crisp, complex flavor profile--a great refreshing tripel.","MattyV","Mar 06, 2012"

5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours hazy golden with a three finger length white head. The aroma of white grapes hits the nose as well as apple and citrus. The alcohol hits the nose as well as that of the malt. The taste is spicy and the flavors of hops, yeast, white grape, and malt. The finish is dry and the carbonation is abundant, but it does not take away from the flavor. The body is medium and the alcohol isn't very apparent in the taste. This is a great tripel and an overall excellent beer.","acevenom","Mar 05, 2012"

Taste is spicy, yeast, a floral hop bite is underneath the yeast and spices, fruit in the way of orange and light citrus, nice dry finish with a yeasty aftertaste. High zippy carbonation, medium body, excellent feel for this style for me. Great tripel, one of the best I have had for sure, very drinkable and something I will come back to often.","peensteen","Mar 05, 2012"
4.45,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought that I was a very good Tripel that is for sure worthy of the title of second best Tripel in the world. This beer had great drinkability, it went down very smooth with hardly any alcohol coming through, this bottle went down faster then expected and if I had another one and nothing to do tomorrow then another one would be pretty hard to turn down. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, I especially liked the way it looked and how great the balance between the fruits and the spicy yeast. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of carbonation, I know this style should have a higher amount of carbonation but this one was a little to high, but it didn't affect the beer that much. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's a little pricey, but it's worth every penny and would make a great beer for special occasions. I highly recommend this beer, if Tripel's are your thing they don't get much better then this. I was really impressed with this beer, I expected a lot from it and it really did deliver, I think it is worth all the praise it gets. So far this is the best Tripel I have had, it is exactly how a good Tripel should be, Great job Westmalle, you can bet that I will be searching out the Dubbel and extra. This is one world class Tripel.","StoutHunter","Mar 04, 2012"

Golden bidy, high clarity.  Aroma is fruity, slightly hoppy with a nice yeast smell profile. Taste is also nice and fruity, some banana from the yeast. Pairs well with spicy mustard and a light cheese.  Delicious, of course. ","KickbacksSteve","Mar 04, 2012"

Good retention and lacing though the beer is rather unassuming. Yeast particles easily visible in pour. The aroma is rather subdued. Hints of citrus, belgian yeast character, and perhaps a hint of roasted malt but not much. The flavor builds on the aroma for a smooth and light flavor, which is impressive for a 9.5%abv. Hints of citrus, mild bitterness, and toasted malts. Not an abundance of flavor like I would expect based on previous Trappists. Lower end of medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, though perhaps I had it too late as a lot of the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. Very easy to drink and hides the alcohol extremely well.","hopfacebrew","Jan 29, 2012"

Full of fruit and carbonation, this beer is great for any occasion. Light in body, lots of carbonation gives it a champagne like feel, crisp, refreshing and very dry.

Do yourself a favor and drink this beer right now.","OMGTheyKilkenny","Jan 03, 2012"

4.58,6.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Westmalle Tripel pours a light gold color w/ a beautiful two finger eggshell head. Great lacing on the glass. Fairly cloudy and murky in appearance as well. The nose is nice- citrus, pepper, spices, apple, malt, yeast. Warming the beer to almost room temperature does wonders for the strength of the nose. The taste is a tiny step up. The same profile as the nose, but the flavors are bigger and bolder. Very complex, and it seems each taste reveals something slightly different. Feel is amazing- the perfect combination of a malty/yeasty backbone, spice, hops, bready chewiness and carbonation. All w/ a tiny alcohol burn on the aftertaste. I can't think of anything I'd change on the feel for this style- thus the 5. It's perfect. Overall, this is one of, if not the standard for Belgian Tripels. There are a lot of good ones out there, but maybe none better. I will always continue to pick this up and be thankful I can find it easily around Washington DC. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 23, 2011"

I also recently split a 750ml bottle in Brussels with several other people and found the batches in Belgium to be more aggressive on the palate due to the freshness - and therefore more delicious! This beer is a true divine savior in a bottle. After having it several times, I've appreciated it more due to its ability to taste different on every single sip. Seriously! It's uncanny. After enough tries, it's now one of my all-time favorites.","magictacosinus","Oct 17, 2011"

The flavor is actually cleaner than I expected from a tripel, though it isn't boring. There's a strong spicy hop flavor not quite balancing the wheaty/yeasty/malty sweetness, but it's strong enough to finish fairly clean. Mouthfeel is very heavy and creamy.

Poured very, very slowly, so got about 1/4 finger of total head, but the bubbles are keeping it in place, and leaving very nice lacing. First whiff gives me spice and a pleasant corn chip smell. Banana/clove. I can smell a nice sweetness lingering in the background and a light hoppiness. Can barely detect the alcohol, especially at 9.5%. Lots of Belgianess (for lack of a better made-up word) on the palate, overripe rotten fruit (in a good way), medium sweetness, and a surprising amount of hop bitterness. Some sort of earthy grassiness. A little bit of Robitussen on the back end. It's not unpleasant though. Incredibly creamy mouthfeel, with lots of tiny bubbles attacking my tongue. Fantastic beer.

Complex aroma of yeast, fruit salad, alcohol-soaked wood, caramel and candi sugar. Good to let it warm up before tasting...don't want it ice cold. Nice cavalcade of flavors on the palate, with notes of caramel, toffee, bready yeast, bananas, pears, apricots, raisins, grape skins, lightly roasted nuts. Subtly hopped. Medium body, very distinguished and highly drinkable. You feel like royalty drinking from the chalice too.","Rifugium","Sep 11, 2011"

5,16.3,5,5,5,5,5,"Westmalle Tripel: The mother of all Tripels! This is a must try beer. The benchmark example in which all others must be judged against in the style of Tripel. What is a Tripel? It is the name given by Trappiste Monks to a Strong Top fermenting Golden Ale. It earns the name Tripel because it takes three times the amount of ingredients to make in comparison to the simple beers made at the Abbeys. The beer is bottle conditioned with yeast to evolve over time like a Champagne, and it really is very much like Champagne. In the first 6 months the beer will be very fruit forward showing more pear and apple flavors, from 6 months to a year it will show much more of the hop character, and after 1 year those two characters will marry into a perfectly balanced beer. The bottle I am tasting is Seven months old. Westmalle is 9.5% ABV It has an darker blonde to honey-like color and a fluffy white head with a lengthy retention. Aroma is a blend of bright aromatic hops and subtle spicey yeast esters. Amazingly balanced and showing a great hop presence here. Cereal grains and honey support a lovely bitterness that is long but not highly toned. Great interplay of flavors. Not one truly dominates. A truly dry and crisp beer showing perfect structure, body, and a very complex flavor profile. This beer would be a great alternative to Champagne. It has a very similar flavor profile to some grower Champagnes I have tried that tend to have a softer bitterness and focus more on rich fruit and bread dough aromas with biscuity flavors.","grotonmarketguy","Jul 24, 2011"
3.58,-16.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O- I know this beer is pretty much universally lauded, but I found it to be just OK. It does have a stronger, more complex taste than many tripels. Not bad, but I'd take a Chimay White or a LFDM over this any day.","seabass87","Jul 23, 2011"

Tastes quite fruity, with notes of orange peel, bitter orange juice, lots of coriander, a bit of lemon, some slight sweetness- not nearly as much as many tripels- and some earthy, herbal bitterness.

Lots of nice sweet watery fruit flaors, floral touches and nice zing of lemon zest with some bitterness behind it. Medium bodied, quite dry with active carbonation.

There is no unpleasantness at all in any of the flavors. It's more bitter than one might expect, but this is not to say it's unbalanced. On the contrary, the balance is exceptional. I took this out of the fridge about 30 minutes before serving and I would recommend to anyone drinking this to serve it at the proper temperature rather than right out of the fridge and in a glass other than a pint glass, one with curves that will bring out the nose.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is bready malt, yeast, orange peel, and some fruit and spice (it just smells fruity and spicy in general, I couldn't pick out any one particular fruit or spice). Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a bit of pear and an earthy taste noticable in the brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth but has a little too much carbonation for me.

4.46,3.7,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottled poured into my Chimay Trappist glass. I'm rating a pair of Tripels tonight, this is my second. This one pours a bright golden color that's hazy in appearance. Better head than I was expecting, with about a quarter inch of soap suds around the glass. Some pear and pineapple notes in the nose. Smells brighter than I thought it would, if that makes sense. First taste is dry, very dry, with a light mouthfeel and a huge alcohol-infused finish. As my palate acclimates I get more citrus, specifically lemon and orange, flavors. Theres' some nice things going on with the malt in this beer - it's almost sweet, kind of like French bread. Aside from the obvious alcohol - there's no where for it to hide, after all - there's a nice bright finish to this beer that's somewhat citrusy and grassy. It's hoppier than I expected, but that's not necessarily a criticism, as I feel it's very well balanced. Some Belgian beers have a tendency to be overly sweet however that is not the case with Westmalle. Indeed, it's dry but not overly so. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but not too watery. This is one balanced beer, and really well done. Maybe one of the best Tripels I've had, and that's saying something.","eclaycamp","Aug 14, 2010"

It finishes with an obscured hops flavor that's grapefruit-y, but buried under the malt. Overall, I don't think the flavor is that amazing. Yes, it is quite nice, but not my favorite tripel.

But I poured this into two glasses, and the second glass got much more yeast than the first. If you don't care for yeast in your beer, pour slowly. Personally I call small bits of yeast "flavor crystals" in my beer. The same goes for hop flakes, though you won't find those here. There is nothing overpowering about this beer and the flavors blend together surprisingly evenly, with the alcohol winning out only slightly. Hop presence is minimal while the beer exhibits a noble spice given off by the Wesmalle yeast.","DanOLeary","Jul 16, 2010"

Poured a slightly hazy, pale, orange-gold with a half-inch, fizzy, bright white head that eventually settles into a fairly consistent, soapy skim. Some spots and strands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced in solution from the stem to the underside of the cap. Nose is somewhat subdued but aromas are well-differentiated - spice, coriander, orange rind, light, toasted wheat. Taste follows nose - not as sweet as many of the tripels I've tried. In fact, there is a definite grassy, hops bittering that dominates the middle and finishes with a light, lingering herbal/medicinal bitterness and some citrus astringency. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a fizzy carbonation that is also somewhat prickly across the tongue. I have to be honest - I'm not sure what the hype is all about with this beer. It was decent, but the flavor profile was a little lackluster, and the carbonation was way too aggressive.","Jwale73","Jun 27, 2010"

The smell is almost completely dominated by the Belgian yeast strain that we've all come to admire in Trappist ales. The taste is delicious, with a smooth sweet malty taste. The yeasty smell is consistant in the beer's taste as well with spicy notes of clove throughout. There's a pretty viscous body, but not as full as I would expect from a Triple.

I can detect the alcohol, but it actually adds to the taste rather than detracting. Nice dry finish. Very balanced and a wonderful tasting brew. Medium body with a surprisingly smooth drinkability.

Consequently, it's also a sure bet to find disappointment in a good portion of every tripel you have for the rest of your beer-drinking life. Trying a couple of lower-rated tripels would be a great lead-up to enjoying this one for the first time.

The smell is on the intoxicating side, but after the first sweet drink the alcohol is hidden under a blanket of well balanced spices. Carbonated to high heaven, definitely a sipper. Keeping the pipes warm as well. Finish is dry, pleasant. What little aftertaste I can detect is pleasing, the slight aroma I push out of my nostrils carries the spicyness with it. Mouthfeel is juicy, it definitely covers every corner of your mouth nicely. High carbonation really makes you take your time, I wouldn't drink more than one glass in a sitting. Not memorable but certainly a good beer worth some praise!","parchedjay","Dec 30, 2009"

Medium creamy body danced a little on the tongue, helping to release the flavors of fruit, and slight pepper, ending with a nice hoppy bite at the end.

There are light streams of bubbles, too. Head is bright white, with small bubbles and a dense texture. Aroma is a bit sour, definitely loaded with oranges and yeast. Body is noticeably thick, and the taste is dominated by oranges. I was surprised; I expected something less fruity and more bready.

Only a Belgian could pack this smell. Taste is more of the same, although a tad sour for my liking. The beer has a very crisp, almost biting feel to it, but still goes down smooth and there are flavors of fruits, figs, malts like caramel, some peppery spices and a hint of hops which leads to a quasi-dry finish (mostly fruity though).

Nice aroma with fruity esters (citrus and banana), a bit of phenols (peppery and spicy) and a very light malt character. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma. The phenols dominate the flavor but they aren't overwhelming in their intensity. The esters are again present but the citrus flavor is considerably more noticeable than the light banana and light pear flavors that linger at the edges. There is a bit of malt character that comes through but its fleeting and always supporting another flavor. Mouthfeel is quite good, medium-light body with effervescent carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, this brew manages to sneak in 9.5% ABV that is (damn near) impossible to detect.

4.72,9.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"I fucking love tripels! Ok, we got that out of the way. Pours a magnificent bright orange into a snifter. A huge off-white head full of scattered bubbles fills the glass to the rim and stays there for a while before slowly fading, around the sides first, which leaves a hill of froth in the middle of the glass, before it eventually fades all together and leaves big chunks and stringy lacing all around. Bold aromas of sweet bread, oranges, grapefruit and candy rise to the nose. Tastes spicy and melony up front with a good hit of alcohol heat immediate following. I like it a lot (in my best Jim Carey voice). Other various fruits, some malts, and bold helping of hop bitternes finish things off. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. I am duly impressed and am going to stop writing now so I can concentrate on how good this one is.","stephens101","Sep 12, 2008"
3.82,-11.2,5,3,4,4,4,"I love those Belgians but am a little confused with this one. First of all this is an amazing looking beer. A nice pale orange, hazy, with a huge rocky white head. Great retention and that Belgian lace that I love. Smell I didnt much care for. Although there was some yeast, sweet fruits, and bit of bread I thought the alochol was overpowering, this I didnt not expect. When it was first a little cooler, and as it warmed, I couldnt get away from the alcohol. I expected it to be present, but I thought it dominated. The taste was pleasant. Very good Tripel flavor, some fruits and spices, that sweet candi sugar, a bit of grassy hops and that bite of alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel was a little fuller than I expected but still pleasant and overall it was a good, drinkable beer.","bunnyhustle","Sep 11, 2008"

4.12,-4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a peach, orange, perhaps I could call it grapefruit color. Moderate head that tapers off pretty quickly. About a quarter of the way through just a patchy head remains that does produce some lacing. The aroma is pleasant consisting of fruits, some of the sweeter one's such as oranges and some nice yeast. Semi-tangy citrus flavor, yeasty and extremely easy drinking. There's almost a clean watery note mixed in with the fruits. I would never have known there was 9.2% alcohol in there if I didn't look at the bottle. Quite refreshing too but if you're drinking this you aren't looking for something to slug down while sitting in the sun. As the beer warms it becomes a little more spicy with a sour grapefruit flavor and a banana note I didn't get earlier but still, I can hardly taste the alcohol. This is a great beer but it didn't wow me.","changeup45","Aug 26, 2008"

Not much in the way of foam or lacing, but that's probably due to the high ABV. Very sweet, boozy aroma. Hints of apple and spice, big hits of candy sugar, and citrus. Flavor is incredible. Orange juice, candied citrus fruits, slightly grassy and floral. Slight acidic wine flavor shows up as it warms. Alcohol is well-hidden on the tongue but a warming can be felt on the way down. Nice amount of carbonation, tingly at first, but a little thick on the tongue as it flows. A true delight and a true sipper. to be consumed in small, adoring amounts.

Clove, citrus, band-aid all are predominant notes with some sweet alcohol notes to round out. On the palate, it continues to be a very clean flavor with the spiciness really coming through. It is quite dry and effervescent giving it a rather thin body. The alcohol is well hidden with just a hint in the finish.

There's quite a bit of yeast in the bottle, so pour with caution. Smells yeasty/bready and of some malt sweetness. Tastes extremely dry and very carbonated. Lively mouthfeel creates a prickly sensation on the tongue. Somewhat champagne-esque, but not fruity at all. It drinks very dry and quaffable.

The smell is very tart lemon citrus with a touch of grass, pale malt and a hint of yeasty phenol, very refreshing. The taste is aggressively peppery and tart upfront then comes a subtle rush of smooth alcohol and finishes with a fair dose of hoppy spice and bitterness. Despite the somewhat strong flavor profile the beer remains amazingly well balanced, not too sweet, fruity, yeasty, bitter or alcoholic. The mouthfeel is light from the carbonation but also tingly and warming from the alcohol and pepper flavors overall the pleasant peppery spice will linger in the mouth for a long time. Well hidden alcohol in an incredibly tasty beer make this a real treat. I think I like La Fin du Monde just a tiny bit more than this beer but that is only because the pepper flavor is a bit less harsh in that one, but that said they are both simply amazing.","fank2788","Mar 18, 2008"

After tasting the Dubbel the other night though, and being thoroughly intrigued, I decided it was time to give the Tripel another go. Poured in to my Westmalle chalice (thanks Julios) an inviting slightly dark golden color. Heading was awesome, big, white and fluffy, with many tiny air bubbles racing toward the head. Aroma is surprisingly clean, almost pilsner like in its dryness. I guess I was expecting a little bit more fruit or spice from the smell. Taste starts off with a big splash of hop bitterness, with traces of pineapple, pear and pepper in the back. It leaves the palate slightly numb after swallowing. Body is medium, and drinkability is high. Having said that though, this beer is incredibly complex, so I would advise drinkers to take their time with this one.

It finishes with an obscured hops flavor that's grapefruit-y, but buried under the malt. Overall, I don't think the flavor is that amazing. Yes, it is quite nice, but not my favorite tripel.

The 9.5% is masked well at first, but a dominating alcohol note warms through eventually. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated with a light body and a nice alcoholic bite to the aftertaste.

The first is that when I bought this beer I was afraid it may be past its prime and questioned the date on the bottle (http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/903581) because the same store might occasionally try to sell a less-than-fresh bottle to you by placing a red, clearance price tag on it. Some fellow BA's at the time helped me realize that the date was "best before 5/18/08" and that the beer would be fine and I thank them for that. The second story (which happened before story #1) is that two people whose opinions of beer I deeply respect tried this beer at the same exact time with their backs turned to each other so each wouldn't see the reaction of the other. When they turned around, both of them had shocked looks on their faces and were amazed at how great the beer tasted.

Yeast aroma with a sweet malt note. Aroma is a bit weak and is the only thing preventing me from giving this Tripel all 5's. Absolutely Superb mouthfeel in every respect. It is a bit more bitter than most Tripel's I've tried, but I like it. Slight Phenolic taste on the finish. Creamy with a rolling texture. Due to high ABV I cannot give it a 5 for Drinkability. Although the alcohol is well-hidden it is definately there and makes me wonder how I am going to finish this whole 750Ml bottle by myself, but I'm sure I'll manage. Bitterness is most distinguishable towards the end of your glass. A touch of spice and vanilla adds to the medium body. Overall absolutely exceptional.

Lively carbonation keeps the head fluffy. Has a great mix of pale malts, cracker-like grain and spicy yeast without letting things get overboard phenolic. I get some light apricots and alcohol heat in the nose. Taste is bready malts accented by mild grain and candi sugar notes. There's some refreshing wheat cracker like flavors as well as a drying mild tartness and some alcohol notes. Finishes with some herbal hop flavor and a perfect dryness. Aftertaste lingers on with fruits and bread. Mouthfeel is light enough from the dryness, but has a slight slickness from the alcohol. Carbonation is of tiny uniform bubbles that ends up being kind of smooth. Drinkable, but the alcohol can get to be a bit much.

The color of the brew was a cloudy golden color with a lot of carbonation action and a lot of swirling yeast particles. The aromas consisted of many scents but fruit is what first comes to mind, pear and grape? Also present is a bubble gum like scent that is very intriguing, a lot going on in the nose of this brew, but all go together in an excellent fashion. The taste actually goes along with what was found in the nose but the toasted malt and spice flavor comes out very nicely and complements everything.

The smell is of Belgian yeast, candy sugar, tart fruit. The taste is of apricot, tart sour apple, bitter hop, alcohol. It has a nice fizzy carbonation yet creamy and moderate mouthfeel.

4.95,15.1,5,5,5,4.5,5,"This beer is truly a delight to drink: poured into an oversized wine glass, given a hard pour this had a sizable head that eventually shrunk to a decently sized layer that retained really well. The bubbles are very small and stuck to the glass. The color was a glowing opaque yellow/golden. The smell had some lemony bite to it, along with some alcohol - there's more to it, I swear, but I just can't pick it out. Same story with the taste - I always find it difficult to specify what fruity flavors I'm picking out with belgian beers - here I taste a bit of lemony-tartness, granny smith apples?, and asian pear. It slip slides around...Also, there is some alcoholic bite to it, along with a balanced hop spicyness! That's why I love belgians, they balance the flavors oh so delicately... The carbonation was a bit weak, but still enjoyable. It was medium bodied and went down easy: the alcohol sneaked up on me. I was telling my friend while I was drinking this that I wish it came in six packs...or even 24 packs! I could have had at least 3 more of these bottles and still loved it. Truly a delight!","EmilNoldSinclair","Dec 30, 2006"

The taste is little short of heaven (no monk pun implied). The apricot and peaches are there, along with a flowery hop note and a dry but savory finish showing that pepper and a warm alcohol note. There is a caramel malt overtone that mellows the flavor and binds it all together in a delightful fashion. Mouthfeel is bubbly, with a satisfying oily, viscous quality that anchors the beer's light, fruity flavor. Drinkability is unsurpassed. I could drink these one after the other, particularly on a warm afternoon. A dangerous thing when talking about a 9.5% beer, so beware and enjoy!","roblowther","Dec 21, 2006"

Aroma of delicately sweet malt, spicy Euro hops, and notes of caramel, candy sugar, lavender, and a generous whiff of alcohol. Palate is rich and complex - lighlty sweet malt and light fruit up front, becoming more herbaceous and fruity with notes of pineapple before the swallow.

Smell is richly aromatic, of caramel and candi sugar, cloves, scent, perhaps mildly spicy from the alcohol. Taste is milder than the smell, earthy, peppery, candi sweet, mildly acidic, very smooth. There's a nice citrus zest to it as well, although it finishes somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, and the carbonation is very high, leading to an almost effervescent feeling.

Flavor was similar to aroma, with alcohol presence continuing to strenghten as beer warmed, although fruit, especially apples, remained strong as well.

A bit spicy as well with some grassy/earthy hops. Some Belgian yeast flavor but overall its more about the very sweet fruitiness. Refreshing body, not quite sparkling but not quite sticky.

4.13,-4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This one displays a sort of sunburst pattern when eyed whilst it rests in the goblet glass. The center of the half circle is more of an orange colour than the golden hues that flourish on the edges around this darker core. Yip. A matress of luscious white presides over the event and is continually fed from plentiful springs of gas. The nose is a bit blunt. It smells of a dull spiciness. The sweet tones are not as prevalent as I had expected. This smells quite raw and earthy. If you want to know what earthy is: earthy is a more poetic way to say it smells like barks and rind and other organic debris and natural shit have been introduced to the mixture by some means. Raw varies by degree. Raw is a facet of earthy that denotes level of perceived rotten ambiance. This one is low on raw, but it is a bit raw. Some degree of rot is always suitable and needed for character. So you see, earthy and raw sound better as such than do the aforementioned descriptives. Thin layers of banana and sugar lay underneath these assertive rough textures. In time a more acidic and fruity nose crops up and becomes noticeable. The taste shows the sweet and fruity aspects boastfully. It has a tang to it that reminds me of some acidophilus barrel dweller. She is sweet up front moving purposefully to a sudden bitterness that is again overtaken by sweet in the finish. It unfolds like the tortoise and the hare. The mouthfeel projects a creaminess to bolster the lighter qualities of the liquid. The end result is another stellar Belgian beer. Otherworldly in a sense. Right on you Jean Claude Van Dammes.","SupaCelt","Jul 04, 2006"

The real difficulty with this particular beer is taking in the breadth of flavors that are available before one has consumed too much of the stuff to be all that perceptive. This might be the central paradox of beer tasting, or at least Belgian beer tasting.

The flavor is also initially very fruity (with big apricot, tangerine,pear, peach and lemon character), as well as some damp straw, candied sugar, herbal and mineraly hops, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation and an astringent and slightly tart finish with some alcohol warmth.

The alcohol shines out a little too much. Overall, it is an earthy, yeasty, grassy flavor. No real deep complexity to talk about. It makes for an average medium mouthfeel. Surprisingly not as alcohol warming as I might expect from the flavor. Drinkability is decent, but because there are so many excellent members of the style available, I can't give it high marks in this category.","cracgor","Dec 16, 2005"

Light grassy hops accent a spicy, yeasty, estery taste. A slight alcohol kick gives this beer a nice edge. Love the balance between sweet and spicy.

This has a fairly full body to it, yet still remains quite dry on the palate, mainly I think because of the yeasty spiciness. As I mentioned this tastes quite yeasty as well, it gives it a sharp yeast bite to it.

Dark golden with a big pillowy head of white foam. This is really the benchmark look for this style of brew. Excellent head retention, fantastic Bruxelles lace. It's all here. Aromas of fresh baked Belgian bready malts, candy sugar, banana esters, other fruits notes, spices like black pepper and coriander come to mind as well and round out the fruity yeastiness of this brew. Taste is fruity and sharp, totally warming with just a small hint of alcohol. The heavily fruity taste and spiciness blend together with the bready malts and make for a very complex beverage. Mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and drinkability remains very, very good. As I drink more and more beers, I sometimes forget about the "starter" beers that really got me into the whole good beer/Belgian beer scene. This is one of those beers, and it is as good today as it was back than. As I said before, just watch out for old bottles of this, I personally think Westmalle brews do not age too well and should be consumed as fresh as possible.

Honey sweet is dominated by a mildew hop/yeasty smell. Tastes funky sour with oranges and spices (clove and perhaps coriander) and some belgian candy sugar. By 'funk', I mean it tastes like cobwebs and white fluffy mildew smell. Some fruits (oranges, pears, green grapes) muck about in a honey malty sweetness before the alcohol and spice dry up the finish. The swallow produces a brief moment of chocolate. It's quikckly replaced by a yeasty flavor and mild alcohol sting. Green apple and funk aftertaste. How interesting...it's somewhat bitter, like it's been hopped to a level that competes with the other teams on the field (sweet malt, fruity esters, and spices). Medium body with moderate carbonation. Well, this is certainly a multi-dimensional beer.

As far as Tripels go, this is probably the best I have had. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","May 29, 2005"

In fact, this is the best smelling beer I've ever had---spent a good 5 minutes just sniffing before a taste. And what a taste it was. First impression is very fruity, pineapple and pears come to mind. Then, I start to get a spicey yeast taste. Finish is a little tart and just slightly hoppy. A little alcohol taste creeps in towards the last third of the glass. The mouthfeel was on the heavy side, with an amazingly smooth and creamy feel. This is an excellent beer, but because the price ($6/bottle) and the fact that the spiciness really asserts itself towards the end, will keep me from drinking this more than as the occassional treat.","cubedbee","May 04, 2005"

Tightly knit white head is trying to get out of my glass, really outstanding looking. Malty sweet aroma intensified by fruit, along with some spice, lemony notes, and alcohol. Flavor is VERY smooth. Lots of creamy malt forms a canvas upon which fresh fruit, spices, and alcohol paint a beautiful picture of flavor. There is more to the flavor going on that I can accurately describe - very complex. Alcohol is pretty warming in the stomach, but is not very noticeable in the taste at all. Great blend of bittering hops and sweet flavors. Low carbonation embellishes the very smooth, very full mouthfeel. Definitely a kick-ass beer!

Dare I say...breathtaking. Aromas are quite yeasty, mixed with orange peels, bubble gum, a can of pineapple juice, and a dash of earthy funk. What was more surprising for me was how different the taste was from the smell. There was a pervasive "perfume" flavor to this beer. Not overpowering or unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination, but a very distinct flavor that mixes with the other flavors: fruit juices, peppery spice, malty sweetness. Finishes on the dry side, with a dose of bitter hoppiness arriving on the scene. ABV is up there at 9.5%, but is cloaked nicely by the rest of what's going on here. Not as thick or chewy as expected.

As much as it pains me to say so, this stuff really has a bitterness to it that I just totally do not care for. Very disappointed indeed. I have been looking forward to tasting this for quite some time now. The texture, or mouthfeel, is quite nice. Smooth and just heavy enough for the style. Again, I don't know what the hell is going on with the taste, but it seems offensively bitter. I am, however, just now getting over a sickness that has incapacitated me for last four days or so.

4.35,1.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Trappists never disappoint. Westmalle Tripel poured golden, somewhat yellow, tangerine, or bright honey. There are definite orange and yellow hues, giving a dense appearance. Off-white, thick head, leaving patches of creamy, slow moving lace. The head started large, and kept at a very consistent cm of foam. Without the lees poured, this is a clear, translucent beer. The aroma is definitely malty, with some soapy yeast. When first poured I smelt massive fruity yeast and salty ham. Fruit and burnt candy; sugary once it warms. Buttery smells, nuts, chemical leather. Dried nectarine or grapes above the rim of the glass. Flowery a little, and definite salinity, or tangy acidity. Balanced, with sweet malt and yeast, and some faint spice. I smell also candied apples and red licorice. I tasted dry muskiness in the middle of the tongue, and a finish of caramel malt. Burnt leather also in the middle, giving a chemical tang. Up front, dry, dusty and sweet with fresh bananas. caramel, grassy hop, some sesame seed oil, some vanilla. The aftertaste is slightly hoppy, dry yeast, but mostly lightly roasted but delicious malt. Superb balance. No excessive dryness or must feel in the mouth. There is some citrus, akin to a witbier. Roasted nuttiness. This beer is not as alcoholic as expected for a 9.5%; indeed, there is little alcohol in the taste, only asserting itself by a warmth on the tongue. This is perfectly balanced betwixt the malt, sugar and yeast. What really impressed me was the mouthfeel, which was delectably CREAMY! This beer hits the tongue and becomes creamy like ice-cream, exceptionally smooth in the mouth. And this certainly does not suggest 9.5% alcohol, which means drinkability is incredible. Well-masked phenols. The lees were pea-soup green, and extremely milky looking. They tasted heavy and dusty, with less aftertaste. You will find new tastes and aromas every time you lift the glass with this tripel, yet, as complex as it is, it is quite approachable, for a Trappist tripel. Perfect with sharp cheese or pasta.","Cwrw","Dec 15, 2004"

The spicy, herbal bitterness and the sweet sugary malt fight it out as some medicinal alcohol sneaks in along with its friend yeast. All this crashes magnificently into a long, bittersweet finish, that's substantially warming. Terrific. This is a big-bodied ale that starts with a sparkling, tongue-tickling, effervescent feel and then moves hefty, mouth-coating feeling, that borders on syrupy.

It's rather diffiucult to pinpoint specific flavors, it starts estery and sweet, and the alcohol burn tries to meld with the dryness in the lightly bitter finish. Rather yeasty tasting (I decanted entire bottle), probably attributing to a majority of the esters, phenols and fusel alcohols. This tripel is majestic in the sense of its complexity.

And this says nothing about the whipped foam topping the beery nectar. The head was at least three fingers in height, the white mass was rocky and it held very well. The head was slow to fade, at the lowest point it was still a finger in height. Impressive. Subsequent lacing was patchy but it clung very well. This beer is pure eye-candy; Im digging it. The complexity of the nose is very impressive. There is no dominant aroma, nothing stands out but it is not like every aroma is yelling over each other. No they are quite egalitarian, sometimes a smell of hay leads the charge but other times it was funky horse blanket, then again a fruitiness coupled with spice spoke up. There is also pepper, and licorice, sometimes there was a suggestion of bubblegum. Sugary. Tart. Musty. Oranges. Apples in a wooden basket next to an open jar of ginger and nutmegboy, was that some poetic drivel or what! Maybe, but it is true. I wish the potency was louder but this is a common complaint with me. Very inviting, I need to stop smelling and take a sip. The palate does have a start and a finish and one hell of a middle! This is unlike the nose. Upfront the palate is raw and surprisingly hoppy, firm bitterness that lingers into the middle where it is quickly teamed up with some well-placed astringency. A bite of alcoholic heat cuts the party short, or so I thought, but in actuality more friends were invited to the party. And they were a fruity bunch! Oranges mainly, lemony citrus too, some apples and grapes in the mix, and these guys start to dance with some spicy ladies. Nutmeg, ginger, coriander, and pepper performed a tasty tango. There were yeasty moments as well but the finish was quite herbal with a noticeable blast of malt (rather clean, very nice!). This ending is quite firm, I like that. In the aftertaste a peppery jolt mixes with some fruit, bubblegum and razor sharp acidity, oh so dry! Bring on a platter of cheese and fruit, please. The palate is heavenly from start to finish. Complex and damn tasty! There is nothing Id change about the taste. Medium in body, big, lively carbonation, the body is both firm and pliable. Yet there is a softness about it. This is another impressive aspect of this beer. So drinkable, it is yummy beyond words. I could drink this daily and surprisingly it is available in Omaha, where I purchased this bottle for $5.00. I will buy more. I have to. It is so good. This is the best Tripel I have ever had and second best is somewhere in a distant abyss. Highly recommended.","bditty187","Oct 13, 2004"

The aroma is classic Belgian, with the farmhouse like smells of hay, horse blanket, and dust, along with pepper and mustard like spiciness. The taste is delicate, and a lot drier than others of the style. The alcohol is quite hot and spicy, and there is a fair level of hop bitterness as the beer laps the tongue. This Tripel does not try to hide the strength it possess, but instead tries to sweep you off your feet with it.

After a medium pour, a good half of the chalice fills up with a huge, pure white head with small, persistent beads; almost a meringue-like quality. Vigorous carbonation currents rise through the center of the glass. Unfortunately, lacing is not as spectacular as the head itself would suggest. Color is a bright, brassy, golden-orange. Very subtle in the aroma department... grassy hop smell plays well over sweet--rather than dry--champagne aroma and sums up with a citric pithiness. Herbal (sage, basil (?)) elements are found yet deeper in the nose. Nosefeel is almost ethereally light, airy, and dry. Flavors are also firmly balanced: initial light, honeyish sweetness; main body of citrus peel and a barely bitter grassiness; finishes something like mandarin oranges and herbal tea (?!). (Trying to search for individual flavors... could this almost be too delicate?) Mouthfeel is warm without being alcoholic, smooth other than a touch of carbonation, and utterly dry in the finish.

Little sediment but there was some. Lots of lacing along the glass. The smell is yeasty, woody, and bubblegum like, it's sharp on my nose. The taste has a light complexity that one tries so hard to find in true Belgians yet struggles to aquire. Light honey hits me first but that sweetness is quickly offset by a tart granny smith apple taste. The alcohol seems more apparent in the middle and fades towards the end. The yeast provides another complexity to this. The finish has citric notes and is very sharp. Quite a great beer to sip and savor. Pairs amazingly with good cheese and crackers.

Vineous scent, apple juice. First taste is more alcohol than anything else. Extremely high in carbination, but still smooth. Sweet apples and chardonay, but bitter background.

Although the dub was nice, this is a really terrific beer. It's lighter in color than expected but everything falls into line nicely. A bit of ripe fruit is present, but many other flavors are bouncing around. The alcohol is nicely hidden, making it nicely drinkable.

Pours a clear, honey gold with a billowy, ivory head that retains well, and leaves classic Belgian sheet lacing behind. Nice aroma of bananas, cloves, and alcohol. Mouthfeel has fizzy carbonation and hard alcohol bite. Alcohol hits the palate immediately, without any disguise. Not good. Hop and yeasty bitterness dominate the taste. At room temperature, some banana and pear tastes struggle to emerge, but don't really arrive. I found this Tripel difficult to finish, as the taste is all unpleasant bitterness and overwhelming alcohol. Maybe the yeasts got out of whack in this bottle, but it's the first Belgian Tripel I didn't like. Very ho-hum.","merlin48","Feb 19, 2004"

Again, fruity bublegum flavors, enveloped by rich, warming alcohol and more very extracted hop bitter.

Lovely aroma of spices and citrus, flavour and aftertaste is spicy and quite bitter, not as complex and rounded as the Dubbel. Very potent with its 9.5% ABV, but the alcohol is relatively well hidden for a blonde. Like all trappistes well made, but not quite in the class of Rochefort.","Sigmund","Sep 12, 2003"

If formed wonderful foamy/puffy white head that stayed the lace stuck to the edges like glue. You could white wash your walls with that stuff. A huge amount of carbonation was present, which may account for that. An aroma of malt, bannana and cloves. A flavor of malt, clove, bannanas and bread/yeast.

It seems that the copycats tend toward bigger flavors, but Westmalle has it just right, IMO. The subtle, soft pale maltiness mixes wonderfully with the lightness of the candi sugar and the billowy airiness of the Trappist yeast. The resulting fruity, warming, slightly peachy, slightly lemony beer is well balanced and ridiculously subtle and complex. Just like I like my Belgians to be.

After that the aftertaste is dry and bready. I could have really used a little more complexity in this one, but it was a very fine beer as far as flavoring goes. I was most impressed with the mouthfeel. It starts crisp, and smoothes out after a while. The alcohol is warming. Every part of your mouth will be involved in the feel of this beer as it awakens all your nerves right down your throat.

The taste is dominated by alcohol up front, which gives way to a very strong clove flavor. Sweetness fills in behind the alcohol fumes, which has hints of carmelized sugar and banana. A robust bitterness finishes off the flavor profile. A unique lingering aftertaste is also pleasant, and reminiscent of alcohol-laced bubble gum. The mouthfeel is very rich, and coats the tongue while still having a lightness to it due to the fine carbonation. The drinkability is good from the enjoyment factor, but the alcohol factor hurts it just a bit. An enjoyable beer that is well worth experiencing.","aaronh","Feb 13, 2003"

The color is a dull gold with a cloudy vision. It smells of fruit, spice and alcohol - it really has a strong but pleasant smell. You do not have to stress your olfactory skills here.

Juicy, sugary sweet candied fruit flavors hit the palate upfront, then give way to mellow pepper spiciness, light nuttiness & yeast mustiness. Mild clove persists as a constant undertone. Sweetness, although assertive, maintains a constantly luscious smoothness from start to finish. Full, almost chewy in body w/ more than sufficient residual dextrins to lend a velvety mouthfeel.

A slightly sweet finish is quickly overtaken by a semi phenolic sensation. Hmm...curious given the stellar reviews here so far. I didn't think the alcohol was blended well with this one.

Most tripels seem to be firework displays on the tongue, but this one is much more subtle. Slightly malty and fruity up front with a dry, slightly bitter short finish.
