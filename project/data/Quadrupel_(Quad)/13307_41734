A aroma that comes across as a little bit of dark fruit, more toffee and raisins than anything, and a hint of sugar and spice.  Smooth, medium body, yeast keeps it smooth while adding a little chewiness, the dark fruits come out as I get raisins, figs, toffee and there is even a little bit of booze in the finish.  Spicy edge gives it a little depth and adds balance and overall a pretty good brew.","clayrock81","Jan 23, 2015"

I love the flavour profile of this one, but unfortunately it suffers from a few forgiveable flaws - namely, the relatively limp mouthfeel and (comparatively) straightforward bouquet. Like all Mikkeller beers this is not a cheap tipple, but going by the typical price point of an imported quad, it's certainly not unreasonably expensive for this market. Very good stuff, and definitely worth a try for any BSDA/Quad fans, but not world-class.","thehyperduck","Nov 22, 2014"

The overall character is wishy-washy; sweet and fruity but not fully committed. Body is OK but not amazing. My impression is that it is under-attenuated, possibly due to not being fermented at a sufficiently high temperature. It falls short of the best that the style can offer.

Pours hazy extremely dark brown, almost black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, molasses, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, toffee, roasted malt, dark bread, dark candi sugar, dark earthiness, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and spicy yeast esters. Taste of raisin, prune, date, cocoa, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, dark candi sugar, light clove, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, cocoa, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, dark candi sugar, light clove, and dark earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of robust dark malt flavors with fruity/spicy yeast esters; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish; but still definitely a slow sipper. Overall this is an excellent Quadrupel style. Great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly. A very enjoyable offering; this ages very nicely.","superspak","Beers"

I would put it in the latter as it holds up against some of the great beers like St Bernardus Abt 12 and the likes...so this is not a beer to be taken lightly. That said, I prefer the blatant drinkability that you get with some of the other Strong Darks over this one as this has a relatively assertive dark malt character that isn't quite as ""quaffable"" as it is adding acidity and a burnt toffee note that slows down the whole drinking process. Either way, this is a very good beer and I would recommend that you pick one up and try it for yourself. It is good enough that it just may be YOUR beer.","SkeeterHawk","Jan 08, 2011"

3.78,-3.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"""Monk's Brew", eh? Well, it must be true, as those two guys on the bottle are both tonsured. That's about all it takes for me. The pour is as dark as a monk's robe and has the same coloration: dark, dusty black-brown, with that lighter splash on top (normally, this would be the monk's head, but this time it's the beer's). Though he may spend quite a bit of his time praying, the monk also toils diligently in the garden. Returning, he reeks of walnuts, dust, figs, wheat, and sawdust. When he brews, he likes to assimilate many of these scents into his beers; it's what he knows, what he loves. Thus, walnuts, wheat, sawdust, raisins, dried oak, and plenty o' brown sugar pervade his concoctions. Yeah, he's heavy (there's a Hollies-based joke in there somewhere, but I'm too lazy to tease it out), but he ain't no Tuck, that fat lunatic. (Is it me, or was Friar Tuck a symbol of a greedy church looking to stick it to a strangely newly-assertive crown? Or was it the same greedy church stricken by guilt and looking to make amends? Too literary, I know, but this brew has brought these ideas out of some demented corner of my mind.) He's also not all that bubbly, but he'll always have a welcoming ear should you come a-knocking at his cell door. Although confessions with him can be spiritually uplifting, I have trouble seeing him all that often, as he is usually a bit too booze-headed.","TMoney2591","Jan 26, 2010"

Medium heavy on the palate, not quite as full as I expected it to be. First of all, I mean full for a belgian is different than full for a RIS, but still, I think that this one is a bit lesser than what I'd expected. Carbonation is low, which is good, adds to a fuller body. I'll definitely enjoy the rest of this beer, and I'm glad I picked this one up. Definitely worth it, however I'll prolly not visit it again anytime soon. I think there are better out there...Rochefort 10... but still a solid offering, well more than solid, great.

There is a slightly sour dark fruit taste with a pomegranite sweetness competing to tickle the tastebuds. With air, some banana and clove notes, hints of coffee, and a long finish that has a bit of alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is rewarding, rich and smooth with good body. This beer demands to be sipped and savoured, it has some depth and complexity to it and might be better savoured with some ageing although can be enjoyed now as well.","ThatWineGuy","Nov 20, 2009"
3.09,-21,3,4,3,2.5,2.5,"Haven't had a Danish quad, let's see what the Danes got! Very dark, almost black in color with a very light tan head that forms a dense, creamy layer and laces nicely. Interesting, looks more like a Belgian Strong Dark. Intense chocolate aroma, with plums and cherries. Dry taste throughout, pleasantly malty with a bread-dominant flavor and a nice chalky finish. Not complex at all, sort of a one-note orchestra, but they hit the note. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and a little flat. Drinkability is decent, but the strong roasted aftertaste limits it for me. An interesting derivation of the style, but very simple and a little dry. Its an interesting brew but definitely not a standard for a Quad.","roblowther","Nov 01, 2009"

This time around was pretty close to a philospher's stone, great quad or dark ale or whatever they're trying to pass this off as, excellent dark Belgian ale that's worth going back to.

Aroma of sweet caramelized malt with notes of light dry fruit and some fruity ester. Taste is also dominated by sweet caramelized malt with some notes of candi sugar and cookie dough. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no signs of alcohol. Well done thought it is lacking some complexity compared to some of the best from this style.","Phyl21ca","Sep 09, 2009"

3.98,1.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The body might be where this beer separates from traditional Belgian varieties. Medium fullness and roundness, where the authentic ones are soundly full and robust. Still, this beer finishes quite dry, medium malty, medium on bitterness and bite, and medium on alcohol. Maybe too timid? But then we've seen American versions that throw caution to the wind and instead of increasing the intrigue, we create a mess of a beer. I think this beer is on the right track, but not quite reaching its intended destination.","BEERchitect","Jun 12, 2009"

Mild roasted malts and heavy tastd malts that have an undeniable sugary sweet aroma. The taste starts with Light roasted and candy syrup. The middle gets more balance with the toasted roasted malt flavors. The yeast adds more of a fruity, cake flavor. Pretty complex yeast flavors and very malty sweet.

It is slightly thin in the mouthfeel for a quad, which keeps the overall impact and taste subdued but seems to increase the drinkability.

Without overanalyzing, I find myself quite enjoying this brew.","frothyhead","Mar 25, 2009"

The beer was dark murky brown with a thick tan foam, not much lace. The smell is just about perfect, this has a very similar aroma to Westvleteren 12. Dark fruits (plums, figs, etc) with delicious esters and some alcohol. The taste is nearly as good, although I taste some spice (maybe coriander) that I didn't detect in the aroma.

As it turned out, that was more in a bad way than a good way. Lots of malty flavor up front, with some cereal-like qualities. Very little in the way of ale fruitiness. Some tart brown sugary notes come in late. Really seemed more like a barleywine.

The alcohol makes itself known in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but a little lighter than most quads I've had with tons of carbonation.
