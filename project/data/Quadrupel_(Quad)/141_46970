3.41,-6.3,2.5,4,3.5,3,3,"I love quads so therefore I was eager to try this beer. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a let down as it just lacks the sophistication of most Belgian quads. The head is lacking and while the aroma is good, the beer is way too sweet. Very nice dried fruit and clove characteristics with alcohol becoming more prominent as the beer warms. If the sweetness could be dialed back a bit it would do wonders for the beer.","rangerred","Mar 09, 2015"

3.94,8.2,3,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into chalice, 2015 vintage bottling. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring pretty quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of golden raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, toasted bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt notes; with good strength. Taste of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, candi sugar, toasted bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale Quadrupel style! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 07, 2015"

There is some yeast and hop scent in the aroma as well, along with a huge fruit profile. I got peach and apricot at first, but then a multi-layered, spice-backed complexity came forth. Intense. The taste is equally big and powerful. Serious bitterness and lots of alcohol warmth. The alcohol could be folded in a bit more subtlely, but the brew is still very well made.

Clean alcohol sting is drying and digs a small amount into the overly sweet malt. It's not cloying, due to the spicy and alcohol, but it's not far from it. Medium thick in the mouth with modest carbonation. Too much for this to be an abbey ale, perhaps a trippel in the malt profile?","mentor","Oct 18, 2013"

3.75,3,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Super sweet chewy beer, let it age. That's the short review. Appears a deep amber highlighted golden hue with khaki head forming thick head clings evenly to the sides of the glass. Aroma has deep fruit, think ripened apricot, figs, and in this beer's case loads of pureed raisin. A bit of alcohol on the nose, brightens things up a bit let's you know what your dealing with a big ass Belgian style Quad...to balance out the sweetness I'm smoking a RoMa Craft Anthropology, Nicaraguan rolled big ass cigar to bring some earthy spice, black pepper, and leather into the mix it really let's the beer shine the contrast between dark earthy tobacco leaves and these dark fruit elements I speak of. Flavor of the quad is super sweet it just sits on the sides of the tongue, it's big chewy and flavorful in the back end be ready for some alcohol to add to the depth. This bottle I bought for $6.50 needs to be laid down for a year at least, it's still a bit hot and I believe the overwhelming layers of sweetness will mellow out. Body is big bodacious and heavily filled with residual sugars on the palate, it's big and definitely burns and warms your chest with each sip. Overall I suggest getting some 2013 now and sitting on it for future use, great beer now will only get better with some mellowing.","WVbeergeek","Sep 23, 2013"

Very light in color for a quad looks more like a barleywine. Nose is raisin, dark fruits, plum, date, caramel malt, candy sugar, a quick glimpse of bread but really more cake like malt and alcohol. Has a very high abv. Taste follows the nose all the way. Raisin, butter and rum. Reminds one of fruitcake. It’s a little out of balance with no bitter at all and lots of booze. It’s immediately warming, medicinal and has just a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is thin and has a sticky fruit juice quality to it. This is a big sweet beer with not a lot of carbonation that finishes dry from all the booze.

Aromas of booze, toffee, and biscuit, with some rich berry and old world fruit highlights. Flavors are bold and rich, with a date and raisin sweetness that overpowers most of the spicing. Only hints of all spice sneak through, and barely. The booze overpowers all of the flavors, and deadens some of the palate. Slick and smooth in mouth, the beer comes off a bit muddled, both with flavors and feel. The aftertaste is richly sweet and slightly warming, with a smooth, mid-lingering finish. Not bad.","GarthDanielson","May 19, 2013"

If it weren't... then it wouldn't be advertised as a quad! All in all I'd say its a pretty tasty brew. But if I'm looking for a delicious beer thats the same style.. I'm just going to go out and buy a 12oz Rochefort 10 and not worry about spending the extra bucks on a bomber. Wish I picked up the bomber of Zinneke instead of Gravitation.

Aromas are sweet and boozy with caramel and toffee, not much Belgian. Tastes are sweet and boozy once again. Complex notes of toffee, candi sugar, caramel, brown sugar, and raisin. Reminds me of liquid butter toffee? Not as much Belgian influence as I'd hoped for. Mouth-feel is buttery and smooth, full-boded and syrupy. Finishes sweet with a slight prickle on the palate from the alcohol, which is relatively well concealed given the massive ABV. Overall, I really enjoyed this, but it seemed to lack the Belgian qualities I was expecting for a quad. It seemed to be a great American Strong Ale at best. It is still worth the try if you can find it, as I really did enjoy it....again, just not what I expected.","barnzy78","Feb 03, 2012"

Pretty tasty smelling, although not quite in the realm of the best in style. The thing I'm missing in this brew is belgian yeast- it's like a gaping hole in an otherwise solid brew. Taste is the same as the nose, with the raisins and figs really coming out. Slight alcohol burn on the aftertaste, but I like that in big beers.

Dark garnet ruby color. Good head and nice amount of lacing. The aroma just fills your nose with cherry. The taste was quite sweet. Flavors of dark fruit were striking - cherry, fig, plum, and raisins. Very sugary also, which took away from the mouthfeel a bit. It was thick and somewhat cloying on the palate. But overall I liked this beer. I remember when this beer first came out, people were saying this beer was too hot with the abv and needed some aging.

Taste is a one note raisin flavor, largely unsupported by other elements. Where's the character? Sweet, sticky, one-note. Not exactly my expectation of a Quad, undercarbonated as well.

The drinkability is average; it certainly does not encourage quick drinking. Overall, I like this beer, although it might be a little too much. Definitely interesting, and worth trying.

Had a fruity aroma to it, particularly dark fruits, definitely raisins maybe figs or dates, finished by some malts at the end. The taste was very good. Could barely taste the alcohol in it at all.

Taste is almost cloyingly sweet at first. Brown sugar, raisin, candied plum or dark fruit of some sort. Some biscuity body. As it warms up the candied sweetness fades and is more malty/molasses sweet. Lively enough mouthfeel. Not really any hop presence in this throughout. Not my fave, but certainly above the average and drinkable on a descently warm spring night.","Bung","Apr 23, 2009"

It doesn't taste bad, not at all, but just doesn't taste like a quad or belgian brew. Not sure if a belgian yeast strain was used or any candi sugar. Moderate feel, with fizzy carbonation; finishes sweet. If you are looking for a sweet old ale with fizzy carbonation, this might be for you.

Usually a fan of the style but this lacks the interest and balance of the all stars of the style. The fact that I tried some Southampton Abbot 12 this afternoon did not bode well for this selection.

Just a hint of hop kick at the end helps ground the flavor, so that the sweetness doesn't become unbearable. The big malt presence just lingers in the throat and on the tongue after, but the fairly high carbonation keeps it feeling fresh. It's actually a pretty light body for the style, much lighter than I'm used to. It's not the highest in alcohol for a beer like this, but still, what it carries is almost undetectable. This is a dangerously drinkable beer, and another solid offering from Smutty. To me, it doesn't really go beyond solid, it's good but not great.

A bit of spicy Belgian yeast with a dry finish that leaves sweet and phenols on the palette. Body is thick, mouthfeel is creamy/syrupy, carbonation is medium to high.

It's a world away from St. Bernardus or Westvletern, but somewhat similar to Avery's the Reverend. Like the Smuttynose Saison, there's a thick, powerful kick of phenols that borders on medicinal, but is largely clove. The fruit flavor are interesting, with a mix of strawberry juice, dates, and blackberries. Once the punch subsided, a clean, dry cocoa flavor kicks in that's unusal, but not unwelcome.

I love the artwork on the label, which I am guessing is some sort of tribute to Milton's Paradise Lost. Anyway, back to the beer; pours a dark rosy color, with just a lacing worth of white heading. Brown bread in the nose, followed by some sweet dark fruit, creamy, almost reminds me of a dessert wine in some ways. Taste starts off with a punch of chocolate, then some fruity flavors, and ending on a malted milk ball quality (not unlike whoppers). Body is thick, syrupy and boozy. Sweetness can become a bit much at times, making it a tough one to finish on your own. This was an ok beer from Smuttynose, but I don't feel that it resembles a Quad. My first thought after sipping it was that it had a strong bock character to it. I am not one to quibble over style, but it does say on the label that this is a Belgian style quadrupel. Anyway, not bad at all, just not something I will be going back to any time soon. Cheers","jamie2dope","Jan 28, 2009"

4.5,23.6,4,4,5,5,4,"Smuttynose's website lists this beer as 8.5%. I just finished the bottle, and I'm not nearly as intoxicated as I would be after drinking other quads. Absolutely a plus, as the flavor clearly hasn't suffered.","admiralcrunch","Jan 27, 2009"
4.12,13.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A dark ruby, almost opaque brown pour with little head or lacing. Smell consists of cherries, which is also te dominant flavor found in the taste. I would like to taste more of the belgian style yeast in the beer, as the tartness of the cherries overtakes it. Excellent drinkability and overall, another great big beer from smuttynose.","ericlawton007","Jan 26, 2009"
3.58,-1.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"All in all a good interpretation of a quad by a great brewery.Seems almost like a belgians interpretation of a double- bock. A little to sweet to drink a bomber alone but a good beer.","alovesupreme","Jan 22, 2009"
