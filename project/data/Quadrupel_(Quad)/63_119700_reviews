review_text
"I am drinking this 10 months before its best after date. A: Chestnut with a slight haze that clears up as the beer warms. 1‚Äù quickly dissipating foam collar clings to the side of the glass leaving sheets of lace. Has legs. S: Big fruity molassey nose, some pomegranate and some dark dried fruit with a suspicion of smoke and rye. T: Caramel and vanilla on the palate tending towards brown sugar, some prune, date, fig, not quite fruit cake. M: Chewy body warming, fine soft carbonation. O: Almost fruit cake in a glass. This should get more interesting as sherry notes develop as it ages."
"D: This one had an interesting thought process behind it, but the end result just didn't pan out.  Meh.  And I don't really think it's going to improve a ton with aging."

"Overall this is a solid beer due to the barrel aging. However, its on the expensive side and its only solid beer because of the barrel aging. The underlying quad is overly sweet, not interesting and is average at best. The rye bourbon barrles (15%) and wine (15%) improves the ale and mellows the 12% abv but neither of the barrels are very distinct making a below average beer slightly above average. This will mellow more with some age but the already minimal barrel characteristics will fade even more."

"Rouge mahogany body, mild haze, thin light khaki head. Huge sweet dark fruit aroma with prominent plums, raisins, overly ripe prunes. Super sweet with prevalent alcoholic heat. Red wine, red grapes, sweet grape juice. The quad character is totally lost here. Too sweet and overbearing. Not a fan."

"O:  Significantly sweeter than the average quadrupel. Lighter as well, but still very full-bodied. Hides the high alcohol content very well."

"bough t bottle at brewery. Best Afterdate April 22nd 2015. Expected a little bit more from this beer but it doesn't seem like it's ready yet. little bit of the sweetness. would be interested to see how this ages."
"MF - Great feel, smooth, med heavy, definitely not dry almost cloying it is so sweet. That sort of slick syrupy feel."
""
"First of the night.  Steaks on the grill for Ravens/Pats game.  Black wax cap then poured into a chalice. Awesome all around. Worth the price. Get some."
"Red wine with a sugary sweet aroma. Very short lived head on the beer and a nice darker red body, more blood red then your red from darker crystal malts. The beer had a pleasant sweet wine flavor that had a slightly astringent almost spicy flavor on the finish. Slightly tart and bubbly at the same time. The overall mouth feel was  dry for the flavor at the start and after the flavor diminished the beer had this thick cloying covering. The beer felt like the wine had coated and dried on your tongue like a paste. The complexity in flavor, mouth feel, and aroma is amazing.  I must say I enjoyed this beer more at the start and the last few sips were not as good as the first."
"V - Extremely expensive at almost 17 dollars for a 22oz bomber. But definitely worth trying at least once. Belgian fans will want to buy a few to cellar and let age for a special occasion."
"Dark brown in color with small head. Sweet malty aroma. Wonderful robust taste, sweet & malty.  I could drink this beer all night"

"Cheers, you filthy maniacs!"

"Deeply fruity and sweetly alcoholic in a head-spinning way. An interesting brew to sip. Hardly worth the price, though. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego."

"very tasty. Great quad! World class"

"really tasty beer, but whats up with all the pomegranate stuff happening with these guys, it seems to be in more and more of their beers. it adds a cool sweet and tangy character to this quad, which is lighter in color and malt toast and caramelization than others, but still has a nice rich malt sweet base, and not overly intense on the belgian aspect. more of a barleywine meets a quad than anything else. the wine barrel gives a little tannic thing that goes great with the tang of the pomegranate molasses, and the rye barrel gives it a sweet vanilla whiskey thing that works with the malt richness. great depth to this, really really good. im not sure how different it is than the stoic, its been a real long time since i have had the original. wonderful winter beer, fit for long ageing, and really one of the more unique takes on the style. not much booze poking through here either, which is real impressive. deschutes won my respect long ago, but it gets reinforced every time i have a new beer from them. this is like no other."

"Enjoyed from a growler in a snifter, this FANTASTIC quad pours a cloudy brownish orange with little to no head or lacing.  Nose of plums, brown sugar, raisin, light floral hops, and a brandy like alcohol.  Flavors are complex to say the least.  Plum and pomegranate to the front and sides (best representation of pomegranate I have tasted thus far).  Tons of brown sugar goodness with rye barrel coming through on the back blending to make a brandy like quality.  Intriguing.  Moderate carbonation, slick mouth feel, and a wet finish with alcohol warmth.  Fantastic.  Worth getting more in a bottle to lay down for a time."

"Bottle review, had it later on tap and didn't like it quite as much for some reason. The aroma reminded me very much of your stereotypical barleywine, there was also, brown sugar, mollasses, pomegranate, cherry, cranberry, raisins and booze. Poured a deep ruby brown color with a tan head that receded quickly. Had a great full body while stil feeling kinda light in the mouth. On the palate there was molasses, dark fruits, raisins, brown sugar, wine, oak and booze. This is a beer I can see aging well and I can't wait to have it again in a year. As it stands now though I thought it was absolutely fantastic, I'm a big fan."

"O:  A solid beer, overall, but doesn't quite nail the depth and is a bit too boozy.  This would be a good one to stick away for a few years."

"Outstanding quad. In fact, only Boulevard's BBQ would beat this out for best U.S. made quad (that I have had). Lovely, rub-red/brown color. Decent bloom with definite lacing. Deep, rich malty notes. A decadent but highly drinkable (and dangerous) beer. Surprising, actually, since I have not been fond of all of Deschutes more ambitious beers."
"Low B"

"Very nice on the nose with the cranberry/pomegranate smell, but the complexity ends after that. It's a basic quad that drinks well. This one is just okay for what I've had out of other quads both foreign & domestic."

"The barrel aging and blending adds a bit of complexity. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and not  picking up the pronounced raisin aroma and taste I expect for the style. The use of Rye barrels added a bit of spiciness which was nice. Could definitely use some cellaring."
"Goes down fairly easy, but interesting.  This beer's best days are ahead of it, but can't find much fault with the taste right now (4.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yes the stoic and pours a ruby brown hue with a two finger creamy head and some tight leggy lacing, the smell is oaked whiskey, molasses and port, the mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and moderately carbonated with tastes of tart cherries, molasses, a slight hit of pomegranate, whiskey and finished with a pinot noir bitter sweetness and overall its very exspensive but I couldn't resist with the different blends of barrel ageing and definitely enjoyed it the once cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this version of Deschuted Quad is definitely much better than the first effort.  The barrel blending is a nice spin on the style and definitely enhances this brew.  I believe i am going back to get another bottle and letting it rest for a year or so."

""
""

"Dark fruit, light caramel. Pretty mild."

"O: I liked this more than The Stoic, but they were similar beers. Interesting when compared side-by-side. I would recommend this beer."

"O: Solid American interpretation of a Belgian Quad. Very easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Definitely one of the better US made quads I have had. This one has a best after date, so I feel I am reviewing a more fresh and unaged sample. It does show, while very good, the beer likes the refinement of the best quads. I am very tempted to get another bottle of this and let it sit for a year to compare the difference. I think if aging smooths it out, this will change from a very good beer to a truly outstanding one."

"Taste is immediately noticeably sweet. The plum that played on the nose is very present on the taste buds as well. There is also a very strong sweet bread feel going on here. There is a bit of a sherry character and noticeable alcohol, but not in a bad way. Flavor is nicely complex and very easy to drink for the alcohol content. I will look for this in bottle form because I would be very interested to see how this one ages."

"Wow! What a great beer. I am somewhat limited in my experience of quads. But from what the style has to offer, this is one of the better ones that I've had. A complex beer, with extremely high drinkability. The beer has a sweet, but balanced entry. Sweet with residual sugars, raisin, prune. I picked up some nice grape notes as well, not sure I've had that in a quad before-welcomed, though. As the brew warmed, poured at about 50F, the brown sugar, cinammon, and molasses became more present. The sweetness is present from entry to finish, I didn't find it cloying or overbearing. I am a huge saison fan, so I don't particularly care for sweet beers. I did not find it to be too sweet. I really dig the estery, min clove, and spiciness from the belgian yeast. There is a nice sweet, bready and soft bitter finish to the brew. The beer is thin bodied. Alcohol is well masked with only a slight warming effect upon consumption. To me the beer drinks like a 7-8%, eventhough it's a 12 percenter. I thoroughly enjoyed the beer. Have one if you can."

"Spicy, warm and continuing savory flavors seep deep into the tastebuds and are reluctant to release, saturating the late taste with dessert like effects that render the ale as a sipping after dinner delight. Its full upstart finishes malty-sweet with balancing vinous and whisky spice that play onward, well into the next sip."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque deep brown with modest khaki head. Aroma is dominated by molasses, raisins, rum, and dark cherries. Somewhat subtle initially. Flavor is sweeter throughout, with a toasted malt base that finishes a little dry. The underlying tart cherry contrast nicely. Notes of raisins and dates are young, and should open well with time. I really like the tart contrasting notes, though I could do without banana esters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this has a lot going for it but would be better if the sweetness was toned down."
""
""
""

"GReat take on the Quad. The base beer shine early on and then gets amped up by the barrel notes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good twist on the Belgian Quad style. The rye whiskey and wine barrels add a nice kick to a very good dark fruit rich base."

"O: A good beer, but not worthy of the Deschutes Reserve family."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very complex ale. Definitely drink this one as it warms to get the whole transformation from dark fruit rich belgian beer to a strong boozy mix of rye and wine with a touch of molasses. Can't wait till that best after date for my next one"

"This is the first beer I've had with a ""best after"" date on the bottle. It's great now. I'll have to buy another bottle and age it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty beer that was good enough for me to buy a second bottle to see how it tastes at its ""best"". It's been a long time since I had the original Stoic, but if my memory is correct, I think I prefer this one a little better. Of course, my palate has likely changed a great deal since then anyway, so it's probably an irrelevant distinction. Ultimately, this is a well done beer, as long as you aren't expecting a ""traditional"" quad."

"This is a very interesting beer, with both tart and oak boubon notes. I'll probably grab another to age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, brown sugar, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is solid but quite boozy at this time."
""
""
""
""
"Hey, ya got any grapes? This brew falls short of what I'm accustomed to from Deschutes. Questioning if I can recommend @ $15/22oz. I guess. It's worth a pass"
""
""
""
"O: Nice quad. No real sign of the wine, just the rye whiskey to me. Nice complexity and strength but surprisingly smooth and easy drinking for over 12% ABV. Lots of cola, chocolate and fruit in this one. Really enjoyable."
"Overall - Not bad, in fact pretty good. A bit too 'dark fruit and sugary sweetness' for my liking, but that's what you get with a quad, and there wasn't too much to turn me off completely. Glad I tried it on tap, but the price on the bottle I saw at the store the next day frightened me off from buying it. I liked it; didn't like it that much!"
""
"Tossing the barrel aging aside, I think it meets the style nicely. I could have used this brew during the very brutal Winter we had. I'll buy more."
"pear and caramel. Taste is outstanding, rivaling the Belgian quadsrupels. It definitely has persistent notes of red grapes from the wine barrels it was aged in to add to the richness. Although not as thick ar intense as a typical Trappist quad like Abt 12, I actually prefer this version of the style. The complex fruit and sweetness tantalize the palate instead of overpowering it. If it wasn't such a high ABV, I could easily drink a few of these."
""
""
""
"The beer is good in it's flavors and aromas but the mouthfeel drags it down a bit. Some booziness is present, which compared to say a Rochefort or Westy that show almost no booze, also doesn't help the beer out. But I must refrain from comparing this to belgian classics and take it for what it is, a partly barrel aged American interpretation. Tasty but not world class."
""
"O - Very nice with an emphasis more on fruit than melanoidans. On the sweet side but a nice twist on a quad."
""
""
"Overall- An awesome beer been waiting to try this for a while now...glad I had a chance to have it on tap...if you have not had this beer and are able to get a it either on tap or in the bottle..do yourself a favor and grab some....CHEERS"
""
""
""
"That taste really fires up my senses because if its dark malt, licorice, and pomegranate notes. Alcohol is very well integrated into the beer. You'd barely know it was there except at the finish your head when you get a little woozy. A sipper or sure but a delightful one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a lot of great flavors here. Not too much bourbon/barrel flavors, but enough to notice it. More American quad than Belgian quad."
""
""
""
"This is just an all around amazing beer with a ton going for it. Yum! I hope it's as good in the bottle!"
"An impressive effort from Deschutes, though the sweetness and high alcohol definitely wears on you are a while. Got an 8 ounce pour at the T&G, and that was more than enough for me. Great beer, but a little bit goes a long way."
"D: This was a fantastic brew, with tons of complexity and depth in the scent and taste. The body was solid, and the finish was fairly smooth. It did pack some heat, so it was much better to sip. Would probably improve with age. Wonderful beer, one of the best of the style."
""
""
""
""

"O: awesome barrel aged quad with lots of interesting things going on, so glad i got to have this on draft and got a bottle, will definitely be searching out more to store away a bit"

"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. Pours a medium to dark red amber with a half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dried and fresh dark stone fruit, rye whiskey, cherry juice. Flavor is mild caramel malt, sweet fresh dark stone fruit, pomegranate, whiskey, estery. Finishes with dry wood, mildly tart, rye whiskey and light hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Not a typical quadrupel profile, with more sweet/sour fruit flavors and less maltiness. Well made with nice mixed fruit flavors and barrel influence, more along the line of a Belgian and American strong ale hybrid. Enjoyable, but not to style."
"O- just really well done. Everything comes together well."
