"Enjoyed in a snifter from a 22 oz bottle.  This fine quadruple pours a dark cloudy brownish red with a thin off white head that dissipates to a thin ring and light lacing.  Nose of Belgian candy sugars, strong alcohol, and some dark fruits.  Flavors are warming sweet candy sugars up front, rather hot really for the alcohol content, dark sweet cherries to the back, and a sweet aftertaste and coating finish.  A very nice quad from an American brewer."

"Taste has caramelised dried cherries,leather.hint of brandy,some earthy toastiness and hint of dried fig. It is lightly on the sweet side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted, nutty, sweet toffee backbone in aroma. Flavor is extremely toasted nuts, hints of sherry, with dark cherry notes. Dry finish, and slight sweetness initially."

"Overall, a good quad, but unfortunately the one I got may have been a little past it's prime. I'll grab a fresher one if I ever see it again."
""
""
"Overall it is a good beer, but falls short of the expectations I have for a quad. Lacks complexity and depth of flavor I expect. No flaws, but falls short of what a quad can be."
"Overall, I found this a very nice, very tasty quad."

"O - Good flavor enjoyed during an afternoon thunderstorm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is wonderfully roasted sweet maltiness with Belgian sugar, brown sugar, and.or molasses in there to sweeten it even more. A toasty biscuit feel too. Mild and low hop finish. The alcohol cannot be tasted but it certainly gets into my head. Drink slowly and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really nice ale, from great brewers. Pretty Things has put out another winner."
""
"O: This is an excellent example of an American produced quad. Fruity and rich; this beer is a great after dinner sipper. Pretty Things hits a home run with Baby Tree. If you’re a fan of dark Belgian or Trappist beers, this is definitely worth picking up."
"O - Nice beer. It doesn't stack up with the best, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."

"O- Advertised as a spring beer it is very light for a quadruple."
""
""
"Ok time for a quad and it pours a chestnut hue with the creamiest three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is brown sugar,sweet plums and candi sugar,the mouthfeel is full bodied but a touch syrupy roasted caramel,brown sugar,dark plums and finished with a candi sugar sweetness and overall for me it's just too sweet for a proper abbey ale instead of tasting like liquid bread it comes across more of liquid Xmas pudding and not my sort of quad cheers."
"Pours a clear medium brown with almost no head. Thinnest of light tan collars. Aroma is of toffee, medium malt sweetness and a healthy indistinct nutty-fruit. Taste is deep fruit, medium malt and woody-nuttiness. Kinda thin body, with medium to low carbonation."
"This was a good quad for sure, I'm really liking all that I've tried from Pretty Things."
""
""
"O- A fantastic quad. I just had St. Bernadus Abt 12 last night, and Baby Tree is comparable and worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence. Admittedly, it is not as quintessential as St. Bernardus Abt 12, but it is more approachable. Certainly worthy of another go around in the future."
"A well done beer."

"Overall: Pretty solid and enjoyable quad for a fall Boston evening."
"Overall this is a pretty good representation of the style. Definitely a tasty brew. I recommend that you give it a shot if you come across it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: good quad but there are some better ones out there. Could definitely use some tweaking, would be interesting if they changed up the brew slightly batch after batch. Regardless not bad but for the money there are better options. Salud!"
""
""
""
"So... yeah, imagine a really thick, super malt-forward quad without much of a spicy belgian yeast presence to balance out the sweetness. And in place of that discern Belgian yeast you get tart, juicy plums. Yep. It's something else, but not the kind of something else I'm entirely interesting in getting acquainted with."
""
"Overall - a tasty brew. Sort of a run of the mill quad but I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"All in all this is solid. It's no Trappist quad but particularly as it warms this has some nice flavor and body. I may not buy another bottle online but I'd definately drink it again."
""
""
" O- This quad can easily hang with the big boys IMO. Highly recommended especially if you like a pronounced sweetness."
"Overall quite nice. This isn't the best batch I've ever had, and I wish I recorded the batch #, but oh well. I have another few bottles waiting review in my cellar, so when I crack those I'll note the batch and re-review if I feel I should."

"O: This beer is about 16 months old now and dont know if it was intent to be stored, but I enjoyed it and for $3.00 you cant go wrong. Not my favorite beer by Pretty Things but its good and worth a try if have have never had the beer or the style."
""
""
""
"O: A nice little American quad with a big focus on dark fruits and nuttiness. Certainly not the most complex quad I've had, but it's nice. Not a bad deal for under $7 for a bomber"
""
""
" Im guessing its a Belgian Strong, or Quad, but I wouldnt be surprised if it were a Barlewine with Belgian yeast... The reveal is a Pretty Things - Baby Tree Quadruple. Im thinking that is another want off my list."

"O) A delicious quad. True to form with a pleasant flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just a simple, nice-tasting quad. Could have used a little more complexity but its good enough to get again. It just wouldn't be at the top of my list."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's good, but doesn't stand out in this style. Would have benefited from the dried plums they stopped adding about a month before this came out. 3"

"Overall It's an above average quad and picking it up for 5 bucks I hoped it was old since 1+year old quad are tasty. Wish it was brewed with plums it would have added that extra layer of complexity."
""
""
"Pours a hazy brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruits, and brown sugar. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think this one smells better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well done & refined quad here. I like that it had the right amount of sweetness & dark fruits that balance wonderfully."
""
"O- This was an interesting quad that definitely wasn't like your typical quad. This definitely had a lot more fruitiness going on which I liked, but it just reminded me a little bit too much of bubble gum. I enjoyed drinking it and recommend trying it out, just don't expect it to be nearly as good as some of those Belgian Quads. Definitely an interesting and unique try."
"Although Baby Tree delves further into authentic Belgian taste and texture than do the more timid and more usual American attempts, it comes closer to tricking me into believing the true character of Belgium. But its creamy carbonation gives it away. A more sprite and zesty tactile notion here would have really sealed it for me."
""
""
"O: very tasty brew, darkfruit sprinkled with dry coca powder... Had a bit of alcohol bite to it, another good brew from pretty things."
"O: Pretty decent quad. Very dark fruit-forward. Doesn't seem to be a huge amount of belgian spice influence (didn't get any cloves, pepper or anything). Just a sweet, fruity and mellow beer. Shame about the apparent oxidization, didn't expect a 9% quad to be going downhill after only 2 years."

"Overall (4/5): Pretty Things has a good beer here in Baby Tree, though I wouldn't say it's on a par with their other creations. Still, it is a tasty, fairly drinkable Belgian-style Quadruple ale that really hides its alcohol presence well and is loaded with good dark fruit flavors. Worth a try."
""
"The beer pours a dark brown fruity color with some nice ambering that reminds me of raisins. The head is very compact with nice little white cream head and some excellent carbonation running up the sides. Lacing is a dribbling sheet of white on the edges of the glass, leaving behind slight tendrils to suggest its passing. The beer smells sweet with dark candy sugars and dark fruit notes like raisin. The malt profile in the nose is sweet and the yeast is slightly souring and pear-like but nicely Belgian and definitely influenced by the trappist beers. There is a great syrupy sweet tinge to the nose which suggests a big sweet Belgian body. There is also a sweet alcohol smell lingering beneath everything else in the smell and suggesting the beer’s 9%. The beer tastes wonderfully complex with an interesting splash of pear-like esters in the initial sip rounded with dark fruits and the sweet malt blanket that gives the beer a creamy feel. The pear flavor actually continues into the aftertaste after a slight lull and gives the mouth a slight pucker when mixed with the hops bitters at the end of the sip. The beer is a little cloying on the mouth with the sweets. The hops are surprisingly there in the flavor with a nice dry bittering in the mouth and some slight earthy spice in the middle of the taste. The mouth is left slightly wet on the sides with saliva after the beer has passed but the roof and tongue of the mouth are quite dry. Overall this is an interesting take on the quad style, but I’m not sure I like the bittering that they did to the style. I see what they were going for in and American interpretation of the quad, but I wasn’t really blown away by the interpretation. Pretty Things is an awesome brewery, I love what they do but this one just didn’t do it for me. The beer is an average quad overall."
"O: Decent."
"The beer is fairly hazy and chestnut brown with a small tan head that leaves sparse lacing. The aroma malt, raisins, plums, a touch of yeast. The flavor is quite good, much better tan expected. A fine example of the style. Not on the level with the greats of the style, but a solid brew nonetheless."
""

"D - This is not a style that always ranks high on the drinkability scale, but this beer definitely does."
""
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Bottle clearly dated May, 2011, on the neck lable; how totally responsible and helpful is that? Pours a very dark ruddy brown amber with some dark floating particulates. One finger light tan head fades to a ring around the glass, leaving lacing. Dark Belgian aroma, dark and dried fruit, Belgian yeast, little bit of grape and brown sugar. Flavor follows with sweet dark fruit; plums and cherries, dried fruit; raisins and dates. Belgian yeast. Finishes somewhat dry, which is nice to offset the sweet start. A very pleasant take on a quadrupel, perhaps closer to a Berlgian dark, but tasty either way. A bit light in body and flavor for a quad with a medium body with light creaminess. I've yet to not fully enjoy a Pretty Things Ale. This was great."
""
""
"O: I can't give too bad a review, but I also like quads and BSDAs, and this was a good beer, so I am glad I bought it, but it does not displace my other (favorite) good quads"
""
""
""
""
"Watery mouthfeel, a bit slick. Overall could be darker, richer and maltier for me, with reduced phenols."
"O- baby tree is an amazing American Belgian quad of flavor that is so dangerously drinkable. The flavor is so complex and enjoyable that I can't say enough about it. Pretty things is an amazing brewery that has yet to put out a sub par brew"
""
"Pours dark cloudy amber/brown. Head dissipates quickly. Slight alcohol smell but true to this style. Strong beer, but not over-powering. Still a beer to have one of for the night and move onto something else. Taste is sweet - Belgian candy or brown sugar."
""
"O: This is a very nice American brewed Quad. Big, sweet and slightly warming yet drinks incredibly smooth with a well masked abv."
""
"Pours a light half finger coating across the surface of a dark tan color, mostly mid-sized bubbles, average retention, nothing unique either way, the lacing is basically a thin solid sheet which glides down the glass sides. The liquid is a dusky brown base, shifts into orange and yellow hues nearer the glass sides, actually notable for the lack of chunks floating about and general cleanliness, not many bubbles visible but when you swirl the glass it foams up again rapidly. The nose is dry and lean but not lacking, grass, yeast and packed dirt appear first, yielding to honey, brown sugar, maple syrup and orange peel, even as apricot, fig, date fruit appears never seems sweet, not getting a lot of spice scents, stays properly mannered and focused. Medium-bodied, very creamy and gently carbonated mouth texture which helps in distracting from the dryness, mouth almost gets parched as the glass gets drained. Again, not for any lack of chocolate, molasses, maple syrup, toffee or licorice flavors, even some coffee hard candy notes in there. Touch of ginger, the citrus element diminished. Fig, golden raisin, yellow apple, apricot fruit stays measured. Minimal traces of clove or banana, some yeastiness. Smooth, wears its alcohol level well, nothing to complain about."
""
""
""
""
"Got this as an extra from one of you generous fellows but I have forgotten who to thank so thank you all! Clear amber color, interesting wispy head that still laces the glass. Smells strong, alcohol, esters, a hint of apple, not bad. Taste is sort of ester, alcohol, fruit, and for a second I got a hint of chocolate which was cool. Overall not bad but not my favorite for the style. then again I don't usually seek out quads so what do I know?"
""
"I like the way the malt and yeast bring forward some toast and slightly dried fruit flavors together with a pine/herbal hop flavor. There is a slight currant/vinous tinge with a mellow element of raisin and fragrant wood accent with some mild sugar and alcohol in the background with spice and other hop flavors appearing mid-taste. I like the flavor and it is pretty drinkable for the strength-not the best quad I ever tried, but certainly high in drinkability-welll worth trying."
""
""
"O- A solid Quad that I am very happy the I got to try. I have not had too many American Quads, but right now this is my favorite. This is only my second beer from Pretty Things and can't wait to try."
"O: I can't help but want to keep smelling this beer and it tastes fantastic. Pretty Things is quickly becoming one of my favorite East Coast breweries."
""
"a very nice sipper! comes in a beautiful looking bottle, pours very nicely with a very reflective (in the light) deep shade of mahogany. smells and tastes wonderful with a nice even balance of fruits and nuts. a great beer by pretty things."
"O-this is pretty impressive for an American quad. The flavors are all pretty decent and it's extremely drinkable. It does become less and less complex though not any less enjoyable. "
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An intriguing, engaging beer, and probably the best example of the style made in America that I've ever tasted. Highly recommended. Would drink again."
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a dark, vibrant, chestnut brown coloring with a thin, small bubbled, dense, beige head. Aromas are subtle, with some dark sweetness and earthy characteristics. Flavors are heavy in old world fruit sweetness, with raisin, date, and fig flavors giving a heavy, layered, and earthy tang for the backbone. Slightly spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon characteristics, the beer has a solid, balanced, and smooth body. The aftertaste is rich and earthy, with a slight tropical fruit highlight. Smooth, rich, and roasted finish. This is a tasty, strong brew."
""
"original review on: 10-11-2010"
""
""
"D/O: More than the sum of its parts, this quadrupel is understated from start to finish but still manages to capture the essence of the style. The smell over-prepares the palate perhaps, coming across as traditional with plenty of fruit. Flavors are nuanced, but the most interesting elements are those that are buried under a layer of traditional fruit and malt, and not normally associated with the quad sensory profile: spice that is herbal and peppery."
""
""
"O - A great take on a Belgian quad. Not the most complex quad available but very solid. Great flavor and drinkability. Amazing artwork."
"O: A fantastic and pretty easy-drinking quadrupel that has confirmed to me that I love this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth checking out, certainly for the brewery's sake (and for the bottle artwork). While it's not the most complex quad this side of the Atlantic, it's certainly quite tasty."
""
""
"This belgian quad appears a fruity raisin brown and smells like a mild yeasty belgian ale with a hint of the dried plums. The name quadruple to me is a bit bold, this is a beer which hides its alcohol well and comes off as a tripel or double. The beer is full bodied with a very delicate mouthfeel which blends amazingly with the dried plum flavor. Baby Tree won't blow you away with intense hoppy or yeasty flavors but to me is a well balanced and enjoyable fruity belgian that I could recommend to anyone."
""
""
"Quite enjoyable, though better with food as it lacks the contemplative qualities I seek from a Quad."
""
""
""
"O - Quality beer, though a bit sweet for me, the end of the bottle gets a bit cloying."
""
""
"Since this is old enough that there have been plenty of batches since this particular batch 6, I may just have to revisit this down the road to see how it has progressed with the dried plums no longer being put in."
"O: this brew was definitely a solid quad and was glad to have another good beer from pretty things."
""
""
""
"This beer isn't for everyone- and it doesn't have the depth of other quads. However, it has an interesting alcohol signature. It's worth drinking on tap with cheese foods."
""
"O: A bit on the sweet side but I was in a sweet mood. I thought this was a good beer that is super easy to drink and very smooth."
"This was sweet, fruity, spicy, and a little boozy. I guess it would get better with time. It was good fresh. I don't think this counts as a Quad, but I think I could try it again."

"As with most beers of this type, when young it seems like it could use a bit more complexity (Westvleteren 12 definitely has this problem), but this one actually seems to work a little better at this young stage than many of them. It has a bit more complexity, though I get the feeling that a bit more edge will soften some of the fruitiness out and allow other notes to come forward, while likely boosting the complexity a bit."
""
"Someday American brewers will learn to recreate the depth and complexity of Belgian quadrupels, but today is not that day. Baby Tree is just a little too thin for my tastes. Glad I got to try it, but won’t seek it out again."
""

"O - I really dig this stuff. It's not what I expected, but I think that that is a strength. I won't deny that I enjoy the banana-bomb quads that exist out there... But this one took me off guard a bit, and made me think, and work a little harder to get, and sometimes you need that beer that pushes you a little. Really tasty stuff, and Pretty Things continues to rightfully hurt my heart a little bit with this one as they aren't distributed in Maine."
"That being said this is a good effort and is definitely worth trying."
""
""
"M: creamy, and highly drinkable for ABV, has an aged quality to it"
""
""
"Overall this is a must try if you ask me. Very unique beer that doesnt stray away from still tasting like a beer."
"Overall a very nice american quad."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the more drinkable quads I have had. It is lighter in body than others of the style, with plenty of satisfying carbonation."
"It's an interesting quad, likeable, worth a try."
""
""
""
"Sapsuckers of Huntington pours the Baby Tree Quadrupel in a footed ale glass. This beer has a beautiful deep reddish hue and white head. The aromas of raisin, plum, and ripe apples are very distinctive on the nose. The first taste surprises you with the tartness that settles into flavors of green apples, raisins, and plums. An excellant beer that went surprisingly well with my almond-crusted Chatham cod."
""
"O: Pretty good quad, definitely a sipper. Another solid beer from Pretty Things."
""
""
"I was served this blind and had no idea it was meant to be a quad. Now I recognise quad as probably the hardest style to brew well, but I think there's been a big failure here even to create a faux-quad character. It feels like there's substitute ingredients, no interesting flavours and an overall distasteful sensation. Disappointing."
""
"Not a bad beer but I just wasn't impressed with it after comparing it with other quads that I've had."
""
"The palate opens big, fruity and mildly sweet with a blend of cocoa, dark caramel and toffee. There's quite a bit of fruit character as well, with plums and raisins. Cocoa dust is apparent on the mid-palate. As it warms up, the perceived sweetness increases, mostly as a bigger body. However, the spices here are pretty excellent, tempering the sweetness in a good way, with clove and pepper being very nice. A little bit of dry, leafy hop bitterness is present on the finish. While medium in body, this beer has enough grainy bitterness and spices to cut the sweetness. Carbonation is moderate, and there isn't much I can complain about with this beer. Very good, especially at this age (which is the only age I've had this beer)."
"O- I am glad I had this if nothing else to confirm my notions that quads should be left to the Belgians. The yeast didn't incorporate into the fruits, and the whole thing was a bit muddled."
"O: The most consistent quality of this beer is it's sweetness...but it's such a pleasant sweetness. Solid body and mouthfeel. Not overly bubbly. A strong American version of a Belgian Quad. I dig..."
""
"Overall, I'm exceedingly disappointed with this. Pretty Things have done some interesting beers in the past, but this is pretty insipid, and an extremely average attempt at a quad that gives the style a bad name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not a bad example of the style, though it is lacking the deep complexity of some others. The dark sugar is really dominant here and while there is some spicy yeast character I would have liked to see more dark fruit and perhaps a dryer finish."
"O- This is my first offering from Pretty Things and only one of a small handful of quads from the states I've enjoyed."
""
""
"O - A nice Belgian style quad, one that I will try again."
""
""
"Overall - I really love Quads, but this one departs from the style in a few ways that make me not love it. Still tasty, but more in a spiced BSDA way. With so many quality Quads available, there's no need to pick this one up again."
"22 ounce bottle into chalice; Batch 3 bottled Oct. 2009. Pours slightly cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts forever. Some awesome thick lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, toasted malt, bread, molasses, plums, light chocolate, and spices. Nice aromas, but weaker than I wanted them to be. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toasted malt, bread, chocolate, nuttiness, plum, other fruits, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of toasted malt, caramel, molasses, and dark fruits on the finish. Nice balance of flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice and creamy mouthfeel that drinks smoothly. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very impressive and excellent Belgian-style quad. 2 years have been kind to this beer."
""
"Fairly good flavor profile, just wish they had dialed the sweetness back a bit. 11 oz of it was a solid beer, but that was around the absolute max I could take of this before it became too cloying. A good one to cellar and drink with friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a slow siping beer that goes well with sitting in front of a fireplace on a cold night. Easy to consume the whole bottle by yourself."

"Pours a dark orangey red, with some chestnut highlights. A cream coloured head, with great retention and some lace. Nose has some dark fruits, a bit of apple, some caramel and sugary notes, with a bit of candy. Taste has more dark fruits, a green apple notes, a touch metallic, some caramelly malts, and some grape and berry notes. Full body but not too heavy, creamy feel with a modest low carbonation; a touch of alcohol comes through after the sip is finished. Quite a nice American take on the style, and something easily revisitable."
"D - Not one I would want to drink regularly but one i'd like to keep in the cellar to have on hand for when i want one."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown in color with a tan head. In the aroma, ripe dark fruits and sugary plums. In the taste, sweet dark fruit, licorice, plums, and just a note of alcohol. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruit and licorice in the aftertaste. Hides the ABV, nice presence of dark fruit and nice notes of licorice."
"Drink- It was a nice smooth quad for 9%. Like I said, light all around but still flavorful and balanced. Pretty things does some good beers. Thanks again for this one Matt."
"$6 a Bomber"
"O: This is a well made, easy to drink, and very focused beer. Extremely drinkable."
"Overall this is a rich, malty brew with well-layered flavors of caramel, bread, dried figs, and sugars, among others. Could use additional complexity but can't really recommend much other remove for complexity. Delicious and dangerously drinkable."
"Dark amber hue in my snifter, off white head with ok retention reduces to a small cap. Scent is dark fruit heavy: plum and raisen. Burnt sugar, yeast. Taste is a bit more muted, but sweet. Light bodied and well carbonated. I find it hard to fathom that 9% abv can be this well hidden, but it is."
"Fuller body, higher carbonation, sticky and coating on the tongue. Tasty quad, I enjoyed the addition of plums, and the higher ABV wasn't overbearing at all."
"Overall: One of the more lackluster offerings I've had from Pretty Things. The flavors never really hit it for me and the carbonation was killer. It's a nice try for the American take on the style, but there are better examples out there. I'm missing the desired complexity of the style."
"Not as interesting as other PT beers. Makes me think of some of the dark, heavy Stone beers without the hop overdose. In some ways it's an improvement over the heavy, syrupy Quads, however."
"O/D-Overall, considering this is not my favorite style, I still think this is a pretty good representation of such style. Pretty Things did not strike out here. Rich is a good word to describe this brew. Pretty Things is a SOLID brewery."
"Poured into a chalice a rich burgundy infused russet with a thinner tannish colored head atop.Funk and more funk overtop of dark fruit in the nose,maybe the most funk I have come across in a quad.Cakey with dark fruit flavors the at turn into quite a funky finish,Iam not a fan of funk so it kinda turned me off a little.A well made beer but I think the funk is heavy handed for the style."
"Kind of disappointing actually, this is the second beer I've tried from PT, and both have only been decent. Meh."
"O: This one really blew me away. Maybe it's because the last few quads I've tried have been duds, but I thought this was fantastic!"
"Overall: a decent quad, but not overly notable."
"O: Quite a drinkable quad, not the most complex example of the style, but tasty and approachable."
"A nice quad with good flavors. Gets a bit syrupy on the finish, which holds me back from completely loving this beer."
"Body is medium-full with medium-low soft carbonation. Goes down easily and is very drinkable."
"O This beer was a disappointment. I would not seek this out again. The nose was just not that great and the taste was forgettable."
"Many American brewers see Belgian ales much like their own, but with added yeast…that's entirely missing the point. When it comes to Belgian ales, it is a another country - a story of different worlds as much as different beers. Quads are not just darker, more potent beers; they are intricate, sensual, relaxing tipples. Pretty Things obviously understood that well - this is one of few American-born examples to get it right. And that's not easy to do."
"O- This is a decent brew but not a standout amongst the style. I like my quads to have stronger, more pronounced flavors. But it might be the easiest drinking quad around."
"The dried plums lend a pleasant fruity punch to the lightly spicy nose without overwhelming it. The plum flavor is pretty strong, but not overly sweet. The malt profile itself seems to be rather restrained in the sweetness department, too. Tasty, though, with a good balance of spicy, sweet and bitter qualities. Good 'beginner quad', perhaps. Goes down a lot easier than your average 9% brew. A hint of funk now and then has me wondering if there's brett in this stuff. Not terribly complex, but certainly worth a try."
"Pours a dark brown with hints of purple and red when held up to light. Tiny white head that disappears quickly. Scent is heavy with dark fruit and caramel malt. Taste is just as it smells. Initially I get prunes and raisins, followed by plums and hints of brown sugar and caramel malt. No alcohol flavors detected. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light (watered down) side for a quad. Highly drinkable though. Overall, this is by far not the best example of this style, but it is a very tasty and drinkable beer."
"Definitely a complex and enjoyable beer. Like I said before, it is more dominated my the spice than dark fruits or other flavors."
"I'd rather huff jenkum then drink this again."
"middling"
"Matched up against any standard Belgian Quad, this doesn't really pass muster. As an inventive take on a seminal beer style (which is really Pretty Thing's M.O.), this is a solid effort that I'm happy to see on tap around town. Treated as an American Quad, this is great to outstanding."
"I am very glad that Pretty Things' distribution is making it's way to California. I've liked a lot of the beers I've had by them, but this one was somewhat of a let down. I wouldn't mind giving it another shot sometime, but it just wasn't for me."
"Notes: I absolutely love what Pretty Things is doing, but this might be my least favorite beer by them so far. That's more of a compliment than anything else, as this is not a bad beer, just not really what I was looking for in a quad."
"Poured from a brown 22oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head, good carbonation. Smell is very fruity, plums, maybe banana, yeast. Taste is also very good, plum, cherry, banana, some alcohol is present but well hidden for the most part. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall I would highly recomend this beer."
"Very one dimensional. Almost all dried dark fruit taste. It still tastes good, but not as complex as others of it's style."
"jd"
"Booze is well hidden -- its ABV mask is the only aspect of this beer that's on par with the Big Boys of this style. A decent beer, but it's quite far from being special."
"aroma is everything you would want in a quad. rich malty backbone, hints of prunes, figs, earthy tones and light caramel sweetness that is balanced nicely against a tight profile of light spices. really well done. very nice full feel with near perfect carbonation is exactly what i was looking for. the flavor opens up with loads of dark fruits and brown sugar colliding with light spices and a smooth, even flavor that hides the alcohol and smooths the palate."
"M - Medium body; light carbonation."
"purplish brown body on this beast with a big two finger head that settles to a line quickly with decent lacing. the nose is sweet malts caramel plum bread and crackers. taste is beautiful plum sweet malts and caramel. very very sweet. carbonation is moderate to low finish is nice and dry. overall this is a damn fine offering from pretty things."
"I would probably not recommend this to others over the incredible selection of local favorites and imports that exist at my fingertips."
"Drinkability – Nice blend of complexities and drinkability. Alcohol is very sneaky and well hidden. A malty treat."
"Nice stuff."
"O: One of the better American quads I've had, thanks to Brian for sharing this rarity."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a very modest level of carbonation. The alcohol is present and fitting for the listed 9% with both flavor and warming factor. This brew seems like a bit of a jumbled mess that never really came together and blended well. While the sweetness, hops and alcohol are balanced well, the flavors and aromas seem a bit off. It isn't a bad brew by any stretch but it also isn't something I think I would return to again if given other options. The label states this brew was made with dried plums. I believe there are other examples of the style available that incorporate more plum flavoring without actually using plums in the brew."
"Pours a dark maroon with a good amount of white frothy head. Looks very pretty. Smells plum heavy and floral. Tastes a bit boozy and very plum heavy. Fruity but a bit over the top on the heavy dark fruits. Thick full mouthfeel but very well carbonated. Overall i really like this beer but it's not something i would drink often"
"Beer is medium in body and has a mildly metallic flavor to it. Some nice sweetness up front and an overall pleasing experience on the palate. The initial flavors are just a little off. The metallic thing in the beginning prevents this beer from moving up in the listing to me. Oh well, still a decent beer."
"O: This has to be the blandest quadrupel I've ever had. Maybe it's too cold? I'm not too sure. Even flavorful cold beers have flavor when chilled well."
"Overall, a nice American interpretation of the Belgian quad. Welcome constructed and tasty. I've yet to be disappointed with the beers from Pretty Things."
"Notes: First offering of the much sought after Pretty Things in this region that I get my lips into. I actually was not hoping for nothing out of the envelope so this one did not disappoint. But it did not quite make a dent in the memory either. All shorts of decent, and a nice take on a quad that I would not mind having again, in fact it might be a good one to offer socially for some early craft aficionados."
"This was a VERY big surprise in the palate and this is one of the easiest drinking quads I think I've ever had. Just wonderful."
"This beer poured out as a nice reddish brown color. The head was fluffy and white with a decent lacing. The smell of the beer is sweet and had some nice fruity aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer is nice, lots of brown sugar sweetness with some plums and raisin on the tongue. The mouthfeel is light and slick. Very easy to drink. Overall I enjoyed the beer and would like to have it again."
"O: A very nice American Quad and a dangerous sipper at 9% ABV. One of the cleanest American big beers I've had that offered such soft, fruity flavors with authentic Belgian malts, yeast and spiciness. Well done!"
"Overall: Compares well to the best Belgian Quads but just missing a little something that they have."
"It drinks easily enough and I certainly wouldn't mind drinking it again, from time to time. It just isn't really what I expect from a well-made quad."
"O: This is a pleasant fruity and bready quad; another great beer from the folks at Pretty Things"
"O: Really enjoyed this beer. Thought the flavors were interesting. Love Pretty Things and what they put out. Can definitely drink quite a few of these and intend to get more."
"If it wasn't good the first time around, give it another try!"
"Overall a fantastic quad. All the flavors are subdued, but recognizable, and meld very well together. Would love to try this one with about two years on it."
"Sorry for the verbosity."
"D: Enjoyable for sure. We had a batch one fresh and I remember liking that more. A good American example of a style that is difficult to make well. I really am curious as to the yeast selection. I think this one might be better fresh."
"Cheers..."
"O: Pretty Things beers continue to disappoint me. This just didn't have many/any of the characteristics I look for in a Quad."
"O: Standard Quad that I would love to try again. Hard to get out here in Oregon, but I guess that means i will just have to start trading more for it!!"
"O: Had high hopes, and was prety dissappointed. I will revisit, possibly after aging this batch, and trying others."
"O - This has good drinkability. Its easy to drink, and it has a nice flavor. I could easily put a few of these back, even though its 9% ABV. I recommend giving this a try."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Lots of flavor and more of a sipping beer. Very nicely balanced flavor with all the flavors mixing well. Bit of alcohol taste, but it fits in well."
"O-For a brew of 9.0%, it's incredibly sessionable. I could easily drink these by the pint while out with friends. The baby tree picture on the bottle creeps me out though."
"This seems like a very different take on the Quadrupel, not to say that I've had two that are too similar. The smell takes on more of the yeast with hops and a dry sweetness as secondary aromas. The beer has a nice taste to it, again, more of a dry and bittersweet quad with a that bit of alcohol peeking through the rest of the flavors. Nice take on the style."
"O- Not a bad Quad overall. Pretty Things always seem to put out legit brews."
"O: I really enjoyed this."
"drinkability is pretty good. fairly well balanced. nice depth. the astringency takes away from it slightly, but overall i still enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost oily and slick, low carbonation, not enough for the style. Pretty warm going down, and a little too astringent for my liking. Thanks Russ!"
"D-an interesting take on the Quad style, not my favorite offering from Pretty Things, but better than may others which are too hot"
"In a bottle, it has a bit of metallic flavor and there is a syrupy flavor and sweetness that is a bit overpowering."
"Ah, and I misjudged. This didn't last nearly as long as I had intended and it never got to even 50F. It's been quite a while since I've had a quad, let alone a good one."
"Bottle: Poured a clear medium copper color ale with a super large light brown head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of light brown sugar notes with some light maple syrup notes and light dry fruits. Taste is a nice mix of brown sugar and light dry fruits with not as much character as expected. Body is below average for style with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I must admit to being slightly disappointed by this one with thin body and not much character but again though style to brew considering the best in style."
"CHEERS!!"
"Did not like this beer too much. IMO quads should be way more sweet/complex and yeasty than this one. I found that there was too much hop presence and that's not what i look for in this style."
"Another very solid effort from Pretty Things. I remain impressed."
"A really nice example of the style and an all around enjoyable and well crafted brew. Nice to see American breweries putting out such nice examples of the belgian style beers these days. I would love to have this again."
"As far a quads go, this was not one of my favorites, the fruit characteristic is there but light and it is a bit Sweeter than I like"
"Enjoyable beer, but I won't buy it again."
"D - Easy enough to drink, the plums made it nice but could have been more complex."
"D: it is quite drinkable for the abv. it is a tasty beer."
"Earthy medium body that is very sweet with a soft tart presence. Again, there is a very earthy, dirt like flavor up front that lingers throughout. Lots of estery sweet dark fruit notes especially plum, prune, raisin, tart dark cherries and other dark berries. Slightly cloying but there is a decent amount of tart character to balance this. Slight alochol sweetness but no warmth in the finish. Slightly metallic and syrupy with subtle hops. There's just a bit too much going on here for my liking and I find it way too sweet."
"Drinkability: It's nice. An interesting brew that grows on you as easily as farm-fresh babies in a tree."
"Forgetting style, and simply taking it for what it is, I find it to be an enjoyable beer, and fairly interesting. It is a bit bitter, but I don't feel that's completely out of place. Would it work better if it was a bit sweeter? Most likely, yes. If it didn't follow a particular style would it work? I'd also say yes. However, it is a bit less drinkable because of it. The bitterness of the hops and the bitterness of the dark fruit skins combine, and then stick in the mouth. It almost finishes with a bit of a licorice note. But then again, I have to ask, is that such a bad thing? Style not taken into account, maybe not. You'll have to judge this one for yourself."
"Botted in June 2010, batch 6. Pours a ruby brown colour, with very thin head. Head dissipates fairly quickly. Smells stongly of dark fruit, must me the plum. There is also some brown sugar with a mild Belgian yeast aroma. Flavour has a bit of tartness to it, but quite sweet overall. Thin mouthfeel for the style."
"D: A really easy drinker for the style/weight."
"D- again, there's so much to like about this beer but the flavor makes it a little slower to drink and by the time I finished the 22oz bottle, I didn't want another straight away."
"D: Not real easy drinking, kindof astringent and dry. Not the best quad ever."
"D= Was kind of hard for me to finish the bomber didn't really care for it that much."
"This bottle is quite fresh, I think maybe having a year on it would do wonders and I'd be willing to try it again sometime, especially since I'm a huge plum fan."
"D - A real easy drinker. ABV is not noticeable, and overall, tasty quad."
"Drinkability: Other than the marzipan flavor, which I don't particularly care for, I like everything about this beer"
"A pretty decent quad, though I find the bitterness distracting, and can't help but think that something mellower would let the plums shine more. Cheers Eric!"
"Interesting take on the style, wouldn't really call it a quad though. Toffee, toast, rich caramel malts, earth, nut shells, walnut,cocoa, molasses, hint of plum which comes across slightly tart, really long lasting bitterness from the hops, bone dry finish. Light sweetness but left feeling, that to showcase the plum a bit more, less bitterness and a more rounded sweetness would help. Still, I enjoy a dry complex beer so this is still pleasantly drinkable."
"Rated it based on Quad - but for an infected Quad - fairly complex. Perhaps try this on purpose?"
"Overall this is quite nice and a solid American Quad offering, less carbonated that the traditional Belgian examples which is good or bad depedning on your preferences. Nice flavors meld well together and make for a very pleasant brew."
"22oz bomber: This one pours a dark caramel brown color. There was a pretty substantial off white head on it that lingers a bit and leaves some lacing. Nice nose, but a little light for a quad. Some spices up front, of which clove is the most prevalent. Some sugary caramel and some dark fruits also. Medium bodied, which seems a little light for a quad. Taste is good. A nice little bit of spice to the start. A bit of caramel, dark fruits, but a very minimal sweetness to it. A nice enough beer, but not quite up to par with some other Quads."
"Overall, a decent beer. Its not world class but its a respectable effort. I would give it a try but wouldn't seek it out if it weren't available to me. Cheers!"
"The flavor is along the same lines with a bit of booze. Dark fruits pervade along with a bit of Belgian yeast. The plums are apparent, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a big of a big dive from here, as there is an unpleasant metallic astringency in the finish. It drinks well enough in the end, but there are a few little things that prevent this from being all that drinkable."
"mouthfeel is oddly dry, which a quad doesn't wear too well. and the hops are over the top...let the yeast and complex beliganisms shine! i feel the same way about residual sugars: leave some so that i can revel in the yeasty-strong-quad complexity!"
"Note: The more I drink this, the more I like it. Really comes into it's own around room temperature."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body feel, with a nice velvety smoothness. Overall a very enjoyable beer and a unique quad."
"D: This was a mediocre beer, but it could have been much better if it was aged a year and bottle conditioned. Clearly an American attempt at a Belgian style, with strangely high hop levels. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink, but it just didn't taste right. Not worth buying again."
"the taste score should be something like 3.8 or 3.9, but if i marked it 3.5, the weight of the scoring system would be too detrimental to the overall score. same with mouthfeel, which should be a 3.7 or so. to compromise, i gave the drinkability a 3.5, when otherwise i feel 4.0 would be appropriate."
"D - This is a really tasty quad. I'm glad I got to try this one."
"Overall, it is a decent quad. I like the nose a lot, but the taste doesn't follow up as well. It has a decent drinkability and I think it was a fine choice for a nice fall evening."
"Bomber of above average yeasty, slightly sweet dark Belgium. It has a drying finish, with a hint of plum, and the finish offsets the previous sweetness. A little different. Above average thickness,caramel, both in looks and in mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Worth seeking out. Yeasty malty aromas."
"Overall: A pretty good American Quad. An interesting take. I really like how Pretty Things puts their own take on different styles and makes them their own."
"medium bodied mouthfeel, a bit of chew; style-appropriate carbonation and fairly drinkable."
"This is the second Pretty things extra I have received in recent weeks, and I've enjoyed them both. This is advertised as a quad with dried plums, and the plums really come through on the palate, along with raisins, brown spices and light brown sugar. A very solid effort, and one that was enjoyed by most the other night."
"Overall, I dug it, but not as rich as I hoped. Dries out too soon. Fruit/malt/hop/bitter/sweet ratio is way off. Good beer, but not perfect. Worth a try and will get again."
"Appearance is a dark brown color with a very thin ring of lace w/ a few bubbles on top for the head. While the smell consisted of raisins, molasses, and was very faint overall. Taking a sip of Baby Tree, I taste malt immediately, with an overall richness. It is also a sweet tasting beer, but has a bitter finish. The mouthfeel on this quad has a medium body, with good carbonation, it is solid. Drinkability on this offering from Pretty Things is better than I had expected, considering the style. Although it has a 9 % ABV and some big flavors to it, it can go down easily. Sip & enjoy."
"Overall, a disappointment for me. Too bitter and hoppy for a quad and nowhere near the assertive sweetness I look for. Not a bad beer, but not a good example of the style."
"Batch 4. Poured from bottle into Oerbier tulip. Pours a cloudy dark opaque brown, quarter inch head fades to sides with nice lacing. Not a lot in the smell. Some fruit, a decent amount of hops given the age, iron, and belgian yeast. Taste is also bitter, much more hoppy then i would guess for the style or age. Yeast flavor follows, some candy sugar and a bit of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and clean, but I would like a quad to be a bit heavier. None of the flavors really mesh up in this beer, every taste is fighting to be in front. I find myself begrudgingly going back to this, so based on flavor alone this has a low drinkability."
"D. I love quads. This is no quad. So disappointed."
"D - Dangerous! For 9% its light bitterness leaves you wanting another sip. Before you know it, the glass is gone and its time for another. Superb brew from Pretty Things."
"Baby Tree is another solid effort from Pretty Things. Quality quadrupels aren't easy to come by in America, so this one deserves credit for doing most things right. Time to get those pillows ready. The 9.0% ABV is beginning to work its soporific magic."
"Batch number 4. big big frothy off white / light brown head that has some staying power. dark amber body color with lots of carbonation pulsing through it. Smells of solid alcohol and Belgian yeast. Not much malt or fruit smell considering it says it's a quad with dried plums. Overall balance of the flavor is good, with a strong alcohol finish. Surprisingly mild malt front with a spicy hop finish. Mild bitterness. No surprises though, and the plum flavor is hard to detect. Maybe some caramel in the middle. What makes this quad different is its overall lightness and delicate flavors. This is not a heavy quad; you could say this is a refreshing quad. Very easy going and not flashy, but satisfying. I think this beer is one of those cases where ""less is more""."
"D. Not the best or most interesting quad I have had, but its alright. Drinkability is ok. I guess I was expecting a little more than I got out of this one."
"Price = $11.95"
"Nice dry and sweet finish. Simple but with character, this one will do well in any season."
"Feels very good in the mouth and goes down smooth. Not a chugging beer by any means, but it's smooth enough where that 9% could get you in trouble pretty quickly."
"The beer was easy to drink for a Quad but a 22 oz's was enough for me in a sitting. An enjoyable brew I will be drinking more of."
"D: Really good!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good stronger Belgian-style beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"Overall this beer used to be better. It's not bad, but nowhere near as good as the imported ones. This beer has become one of my least favorite of Pretty Things."
"Overall this was a solid and well-crafted beer but it was too muted to be great. Still, it's worth a shot to decide for yourself."
"D: Very drinkable, I'm happy to have tried this one after seeing such a long line at ACBF."
"Another exercise in the mastery of brewing full flavored but subtle beer by Pretty Things. In my review of Saint Botolph's Town, I mentioned how I enjoyed the beer for all of its English Brown flavors despite many of them not normally being up my alley. Baby Tree is exactly up my alley, and it's as well-made as Botolph's Town. I'd say it's just a touch below beers like Saint Bernardus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10."
"D-this isn't bad, lots of phenol and banana in both the nose and the taste but the plums don't seem to really show through. a faint bit of dark fruit towards the back but not like i had hoped for."
"Drinkability - It's a very tasty beer. There's no doubt about that, and it's really easy to drink and entire bottle of this with no problem. After the first glass you really feel the 9%."
"D: The quad doesn't feel like 9%; although its lush flavor should be a dead give-away. Another strong Belgian offering from Pretty Things."
"D: I anticipated not liking Baby Tree because I usually don't like dark fruit flavors in my beers. However, this one surprised me."
"Taste is rich and sweet but still it's not too dry. It's got lots of raisins and dark fruit. It's really got a nice rich mouthfeel, very tasty and drinkable."
"D: I was more impressed than I expected to be. Really great beer."
"Drinkability: A nice and complex beer and certainly one I would get again. I like the breadiness and fruit. There are other quads I would reach for first. However, I would still reach for this over several other beers across styles. A good beer, in a style with several excellent brews."
"Poured this straight down this middle of my stemmed glass; just as the bottle told me to. Pours a rich dark ruby color with an off white four finger monster of a head. The head looks really nice and has nice retention. Lots of sticky lacing. I'm actually kind of having trouble picking up some of the aromas on this. I definitely smell the dried plumbs and other dark fruits. Other than that I can only smell a trace of alcohol and aromas that can only be explained as earthy. Sweet malts and the dried prunes take the forefront on the taste of this one. Warming spices such as cloves coat my pallet on this nice dry finish. Hints of vanilla. Really a lot going on with this one. After the aroma I was a little afraid this would be a hot boozy mess. However, it has a nice silky mouth feel with subtle tingling carbonation. Not heat and a nice comforting beer to cap the night off."
"D-Quite nice and while a solid quad not totally typical. Nice flavours meld well and make for a very pleasant brew."
"D - Saison Noir? Tripel Noir? Pretty nice, Pretty Things..."
"I like the taste though not overly complex but a nice puckering tartness with prevailent plum, cherry, caramel, barnyard, and earth. Not overly complex or big but quite drinkable."
"3.5 D: Not terrible, but there are a ton of better examples out there. I had a similar experience at a tasting a couple months ago."
"With its strong, whiskey-like character, alcohol presence and full body, this beer drinks extremely slowly."
"D- Really nice quad with some distinctive flavors going on that sets it apart from most others."
"D - bitter linger balances flavor, but impedes drinkability. Good for fall."
"A decent domestic quad - I hope to try future batches to see if the yeast strain develops/improves over time."
"Batch Four - February 2010"
"Medium to full bodied, relatively high fizz. Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol very well masked."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle(batch 4) into a snifter. It pours a mucky, murky brown with a fizzy 2 finger head. The head sticks around leaving nice lacing. The aroma is full of plums and has just the slightest hint of booze. Sweet candi sugar, dark fruit and a hint of alcohol with a sweet, dry finish. The beer is well carbonated and full bodied, the high abv is well hidden. A solid quad."
"D: It's very drinkable and the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Probably not Westy 12, but no doubt worth a try."
"This is a nice take on the style but really lacks the overall richness, smoothness and depth of an elite quad. It's still pretty drinkable and enjoyable, but just not quite on par with the elite."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light but medium bodied with some nice carbonation to go with the easy drinking feel of this beer. Is a really nice MA local brew."
"As usual with Pretty Things, this is a unique take on a traditional style. A dry roasty quad with very little sweetness. It's not one of my favorites in the style but it is memorable for it's unusual character."
"I'm sure this brew would mellow out nicely. There is some very nice complexities and flavors at the heart of this brew."
"D - Pretty drinkable quad. Soft and smooth and packs a punch. Not the kind of beer I'd have a lot of in a night, but one that I'd have again."
"Drinkability: Flavor and aroma were a bit off, but this was nice to sample. I enjoyed it."
"Dark ruby red/brown color. Not quite opaque but very dark. Light colored head. Flavor and aroma definitely have a dark fruit: plums, etc. Very good late night sipper."
"D - An interesting take on the Quad style... The taste is not as sweet as I expected nor is the mouthfeel and smooth or rich as expected, both of which detract slightly from the overall experience... A challenge to the senses... It little bit of warming goes along way and allows the complexity to breakthrough... Pretty Things is doing a lot of great things and while this may not be my favorite offering from them, this is another fine example of their fine craftsmanship and forward looking vision..."
"Pours a dark, hazy brown with quick poof of off white head leaving little behind and little retention. Smell is fairly deep... a quick shot of prunes, an almost artificial scratch and sniff sticker-like whiff of rasin, candy sugars, faint herbal and spice notes, backed up by yeasty sourdough bread. Taste brings the dried fruit and sugar flavors to the front mellowing out to a nice herbal and spiced concoction. The breadyness hits right when the finnish becomes slightly alcoholic. Medium bodied, small lingering boozy aftertaste clouds my overall opionion. A very different Quad, good, but sometimes muddled."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy brown color. Nose is faint caramel. Flavor is sweet and tart dark fruit; dry almost hoppy finish. Pannepot Old Fisherman's Ale is a better quad. High ABV is hidden. $6.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D- This beer was enjoyable times three. Not what I would consider a quad but interpretation should be a staple in a brewers resume. This hides the ABV very well so be warned. Would suggest to anyone to try."
"M- Full body with high carbonation. Finishes easier than a lot of quads."
"Picked up a bomber to drink with my wife after Easter dinner. Batch 4, bottled February 2010. Poured into tulip glasses. Dark brown color with garnet red highlights. Moderate sized white head. Lots of carbonation noticed. Bit of fruit in the nose but not a lot. Taste was good, but not what I was expecting. There was no big quad taste up front, and I also really didn't get a feel for the dried plums at all. Just tasted like an average Belgian brown ale. There was no big juicy, fruity, sugary aspects to this beer that I have become accustomed to with quads. A bit thin in the body also, and for a 9% beer, didn't feel that heat at any point. It's a nice beer to drink, but was not at all what I was hoping for."
"Mouthfeel is sugary, full bodied, and sticky sweet with raisin cinnamon rolls resounding along the palate."
"This is a well crafted beer, but I found the body a little thin. It's definitely a sipping beer that should be enjoyed over a period of time so the intricate flavors come out as the beer warms."
"* bonus points for the creative name and bottle design: 5.0"
"d - Not a bad quad. Had an enjoyable sweet fruit smell and taste. Would try it again."
" I was hoping for more, especially for this being a sort of locally made quad."
"Pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a lot of malt with some fruit. Not as much aroma as I expected. The flavor is better, with caramel malts, dark fruit (cherries and plums) and some Belgian candi sugar. No detectable alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability was a mixed bag. I really enjoyed the aroma and the initial flavor profile but this beer disappointed on the finish."
"Pretty Things makes some good beers, and Baby Tree is no exception. It's a big quad that drinks like a beer half it's size. Overall it's a solid beer."
"A bit cloudy, but it had a very nice deep red/purple colour when held up to the light. A fluffy beige cap appeared during the pour and fell quite slowly. There was a bit of chunky lace too. Bready, fruity aroma, red grapes and berries, plums and a bit of malt. Same in the flavour, mild bitterness with caramel malt sweetness. Plum character had a hint of tartness to it as well. Full bodied with lowish carbonation, slight warmth as it warmed, fairly smooth. Pretty good overall, quite fruity."
"M/D: The first thing I notice is that the body is a little thiner than most quads. Kind of dry and the alcohol content slows this beer down."
"Drinkability is only average. A pretty good American Belgian quad overall, but not a standout. I was a little less impressed with this than with the other Pretty Things beers I've had for sure."
"Hazed brown, with mild crimson tinges, with a frothy off white head. Malty, yeasty aroma with blend of dark fruits, plums, figs, etc. Medium bodied with typical yeasty quad flavor with pleasant dark fruit twist from the plum, mild and complementary. Very nicely balanced, very drinkable."
"Bottle shared at Woodshop 5.0. At a tasting where Odonata Rorie's Ale was flowing like blood from a stabbing victim, I was intrigued to try this quad brewed with fruit and do a little comparison. Pours a hazy, sort of ugly muddy brown color with a light-tan wispy head. Aroma is full of Belgian dark esters and spices without much plum going on. Plum finally comes through more in the flavor but it's a mushy mealy overripe plumminess. The base beer is very yeasty with additional accents of raisin, dark bread, and caramel. A little underwhelming but still pretty good."
"Drinkability is insane for a 9% belgian-style ale. (I see its listed as 8.7% on here but the bottle says 9%)."
"Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Booze is a little high which pulls down the drinkability...but the flavor is good so it's enjoyable."
"Eminently drinkable, a beer to sit back and savor."
"Ahh Belgian quads not for the faint of heart or palate. A deep magohany glance stares back at you with a lot of bubbles. The celebration begins with a yeasty earthy aroma that harkens you back to hours of prayer. History comes alive with this ale embrace it. Dried plums slowly do a waltz with your taste buds and a slight bready taste coats your palate. a session beer to trade stories with your friends, this ale is not but a signature to a good evening this ale is."
"D- Yet another good thing feom Pretty Things. I would not have been able to pick out the dried plums until the very end. I would have another for sure as the 9.0 abv is undetectable to me. I would lean towards a LA Judgement day if presented with such a win-win choice."
"D - Look out Westy :)"
"Pours a dark brownish red with thick white head. Reduces to some nice swirls on top with decent lacing. Smells of sugar plums and is quite sweet to the nose. Taste is less sweet and more complex. Definitely smells Belgian and that is good as I enjoy Belgian beers. The plums add a nice sweetness and the beer is perfectly tart with a dry finish. This beer is excellent and really grows on you as you continue to indulge. Mouthfeel is thin with good carbonation. Very drinkable but the high sweetness and ABV prevents extreme overindulging. Wonderful beer!"
"Baby Tree, why have thou failed me?! I really wanted to like you. Baby Tree is the attractive redhead at the bar who at first agrees to go home with you, but knees you in the balls when you begin the walk to her car. Use caution."
"Overall, a very good quad and unique in a very good way. I'll be having more Pretty Things in the future."
"overall im glad i got to try this but i wouldnt seek it out and i really appreciate the bottle i received..."
"Notes: Much lighter than expected,easy to drink.It was good,but for the style I do not think I would choose this again.Just too heavy on plums and grapes."
"d: I'm curious to know how large a role the dried plums played in the finished product. The effect seems subtle to me and I'm very glad for it. I really enjoyed lingering over this, top-notch stuff."
"Thanks for the chance to try!"
"Andrew.. I truly appreciate the hook-up... consider me an ""always"" trader for you."
"Overall this a pretty easy drinking Quad. I was taking big gulps trying to decipher all the flavors. I don't know much about the style having had only one other Quad in my life, but upon reading the description, I'd like to see more malt flavor in this beer. It fits the bottles description but not I guess the letter of what a Quad is. Also very few phenols, or clove like flavors. As a beer this a great a representation of the style maybe not. Its up to decide if thats necessary or if the beer is fine on its own. It isn't that complex, so if its a complex and strange Belgian ale your looking for this isn't it."
"Next review!"
"Pretty good beer. Not really as interesting as belgian quads. But still nice."
"Excellent brew, that gets better as it warms. A very nice twist on the style in more ways than one."
"Drinkability: Very good. Well crafted and understated beer. Balanced, flavorful, refreshing. I like it quite a bit, starting to really trust Pretty Things."
"Pours a dark brown color with some honey highlights; short tight head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is quite faint; some barely noticable dark fruit notes and yeasty phenols but that is it. The taste is big on fruity sweetness with some cherry and grape juice flavors which transitions into a raspberry tartness. It has a light earthy characteristic but it is short lived in the fruity flavors. Seems to have more of a fresh fruit juice flavor over your typical boozy dark fruit flavors of most Quads/BSDAs. The feel is light and extremely fizzy, kind of burns the tongue; sweet on the finish. A decent Quad, seems to be lighter and more refreshing than others in the style. The flavors are kept in check, nothing cloying. Good to try if you want something sweet and refreshing but not overly boozy."
"D: Overall not the most intriguing beer in an otherwise complex style. Everything is just ok here. The one part of Baby Tree that stands out is the mouthfeel. Very smooth, goes down easy and this significantly enhances the drinkability of a beer that is otherwise really average."
"D= pretty good beer. Nothing special and actually a little disappointing for a quad. I'll buy this beer again for sure to throw in a cellar and just because I like the art of the bottle and want to help this brewery do great things. Like I mentioned nothing wrong with it it's just not my kinda quad."
"I hear tell Pretty Things tweaked batch 2 so I may give that a go but I'm pretty (ha!) all set with batch 1."
"Impression: Good, not great. Perhaps will improve with age."
"Reviewed on 12/6/2009. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a cloudy mahogany brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, alcohol, spices (including clove), prunes, and dark fruits. Flavor of lots of dark fruits and Belgian yeast. A decent quad, fairly drinkable."
"Dark amber with ruby highlights, small white head, nice lacing and lasting cap. Aroma is full of dark fruits and malts, light chocolate, apple, and light plum. Taste is right on with the nose. The plum isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be but it's certainly tasty. Body is a tad lighter than I like in a quad, but again it's very tasty and definitely drinkable for the high ABV."
"D: Yet another fantastic Pretty Things beer!"
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely, I was very impressed by this and I think it will do well in the cellar. I plan on buying a few more bottles now that I know where to find them."
"D: Interesting. Not as heavy as I would want from a quad. In all honesty it could use some more alcohol in it to give it a bit more zing and emphasize the interplay with the fruits."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a large tan head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Appetizing aroma of dark fruit, cloves, candied sugar, and malt. The flavor does not quite live up to the aroma. Has a dry, almost caustic component that brings the score down. Otherwise has nice Belgian qualities of a fruity and spicy Quad and slightly vinous. Not as sweet as most. Has a good body with nice carbonation that gives it a soft texture. One of the better American interpretations of the Quadrupel style. Worth a look if you see it in the store."
"M/D - Medium bodied, a little on the thin side for what I expect from a Quad. Very spicy in the finish and it lingers in your mouth. Very easy drinking here. A good quad, not great, but certainly good."
"This beer pours a brownish plum color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of plums, cloves, lots of spice, hints of bubblegum, and Belgian malt. This beer smells really good. The taste is much like the aroma. There is lots of spice, lots of malt, and enough fruit to balance things out. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really good quad that I will surely drink again."
"This is the third beer from Pretty Things I've tried and they have knocked them all out of the park, I can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"This is a sweet, fruity, thick, syrupy ale with a grape like taste, from the plums, and maybe some pineapple, a touch of citric tanginess, and good dose of ABV. This is a sipping beer, it is strong, it has some warming alcohol notes on the back end that lead into the finish. It's a nice, strong, fruity type ale that has much to recommend it."
"The beer pours a darkish brown color with OK head retention and not much lacing. While the beer didn't look all that impressive, in this case looks were deceiving. The aroma profile is undeniably pretty sweet, with brown sugar and chocolate, coupled with some underlying prunes and cherry. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose pretty closely, but I was impressed by the amount of flavor and richness in this beer. I would describe the mouthfeel as no more then medium bodied, with a fairly long finish. Drinkability is OK, though you can tell the alcohol is up there a bit in this one, which coupled with the sweetness, makes drinking this beer rather slow going. Nevertheless, I thought this a very nice effort from this ""new to me"" brewery."
"I have mixed feeling about this one, the aroma is right up there among the best of the style but after that I'm not sure if it does it for me. Overall, though, this is a very interesting beer and I'm very curious to try more Pretty Things brews in the near future."
"Bomber from the first batch in April '09. Pours a very dark, cloudy brown with a small light beige head that doesn't really last. Smells of bready, fruity, and even tangy yeast; pretty reminiscent of Chimay Première, actually. A wee bit of chocolate/roastiness. Sweet overall. The taste has all of the same characteristics; a doughy but fruity yeast presence, along with a good amount of sweet, dark malt. Brown sugar. Very sweet finish that leaves a rather cloying aftertaste; kind of like Cracker Jacks. Warming. Full body. Too sweet, though I guess that keeps with the style."
"I really dug this one. I think a tad bit of aging would smooth it out even more. Nice to have such a hopped quad. Worth seeking out."
"Overall a good entry for the Quad field, impressive considering this brew is American."
"A really nice quad, balanced without being too cloying. I love the plums in this beer, really drives the flavor and pushes the fruit to the forefront. Highly recommend."
"Poured into a chalice a ruby red color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some figs, raisins, plums, slight spice. The taste is sweety, malty/yeasty, with some dark fruits thrown in, slighlty spiced. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"This is a hoppy quad--much hoppier than I had expected--but it works, as the bitterness balances well with the sweet dark fruit notes of plum and fig. Finishes clean with some toasted malt and Belgian candi sugar. The medium body is well-carbonated, making this also one of the more drinkable quads I've encountered. Great beer; Pretty Things is definitely headed in the right direction."
"Bomber bottle, tape over the cap says ""Bottled July 2009,Batch two"". Pours a moderatly dark shade of brown, murky and welcoming. The Frothy head is dark khaki, long lasting and leaving a rich collar, then well developed and quite beyond respectable sheeting/lacing. Nice looking beer. The sniff is soaked in ripe dark fruit, raisins and figs. Full flavor and quite tasty brew. Dark Belgian beer lovers rejoice. Loaded with notes of rum soaked raisins, ripe and goey figs and plums. Pleasing mouthfeel and smooth finish. Alcohol present but well folded into all the other good stuff going on here. Classy sipper, night capper, dessert beer. Well done, PT crew..."
"Opened up a bottle from the first batch (according to the cap label) and it poured a hazy brown with a short off-white head. Overall, this beer reminded me a bit of Ommegang's Three Philosophers, but less-so of traditional Belgian quads like St. Bernardus 12. While the beer is smooth drinking, it's also considerably more bitter and has a roasted toffee flavor that stands out. Of course, there's also cherry, caramel, fig, and plum flavors rolling around in this almost too-drinkable beer. Definitely worth a try for an interesting and tasty take on the style."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, formed a 3/4"" brown head over the cloudy dark red brew. Frothy head receds very gradually, with a thick coating of lace. Aroma is yeasty, spicy, and dark fruits. Taste is moderately sweet upfront, fruit in the middle, and the close finds the spice and alcohol coming together. I'm having trouble separating the flavors, they all merge so well. Mouthfeel is way smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Liking this."
"Not as strong or sweet as some other Quads I have tried, but that is a good thing. Good thing I bought a few because this will be a great beer in the fall."
"I absolutely love this beer. It's one of my favorites. I'll be buying it again, and again, and again."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and crystal malt scent along with a nice fruity yeast aroma. It's dry with a bit of warmth and plum aroma. It's not overly fruity; just complimentary. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that's rich in crystal malts and Belgian ale yeast. The dried plums add some complexity, but the yeast is the dominant flavor here. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a tastey brew. I tried it at the ACBF and couldn't wait to buy a bottle for home. Nice work!"
"M&D- The mouth is nice on this, sweet and a bit syrupy, I would say baby tree as an above medium body with light carb, especially when it warms. A smooth sipper with just a bit of heat when going down. The ABV is not as high as other quads which is a nice change of pace, The lighter ABV does not take away from the taste which is superb. I would have no problem drinking a whole bomber of this & I would not be stumbling around afterwards. This might benefit from some short term aging, but it is great where it's at now."
"the mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium bodied with a soft delicate, but fairly active carbonation. this one starts off being a little ho-hum, but it grows on you. i'm liking the earthy sort of dryness."
"Drinkability- Definitely not bad. I think it may be slightly young at this point but honestly it's packed full of big flavor and not too sweet (the most important trait for any Belgium for me). Very impressive for such a young brewery (or at least a young bottling brewing, honestly have no clue about them). Thanks Adam!"
"Drinkability: Drinkability is good but suffers a bit from the sweetness. Overall a pretty good beer from Pretty Things."
"Pours dark prunish purpley-brown into my tulip with a nice lofty head, and some sticky lacing as the beer goes down. Smell is sort of boozey, which is odd, kind of sweet. That boozey smell may be plums, since I get it on the taste too. It doesn't taste boozey, but something with that slightly bracing bitterness, that eventually smooths out. I think it is the plums. Sweet, plum, velvety. Nice and smooth. It takes a bit to get used to, but it becomes very drinkable when you do. Probably my least favorite Pretty Thing so far, but by no means a poor showing."
"For the Summer, it is a pretty cold, dismal day out that reminds me more of Fall. For this reason, I decided to pick up something with a little alcohol girth to it. Before I go any further, the artwork on this beer, and all Pretty Things beers (which I believe are drawn by Dann) are some of the coolest out there. On to the beer...Dark in color, sort of burgundy, a quick forming head that quickly becomes white lacing with multiple levels. Dark stone fruits meld very well with the Quad character. Sometimes this style gives off smells and flavors of dark fruit not unlike the ones found here. In this case however, the addition of dried plums does raise the bar a bit without becoming too sweet or artificial seeming. Besides the fruit, other accompanying complexities include some brown bread, molasses, bubblegum, powdered sugar and delicate alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied, yet very manageable. When this brew first hit the shelves in April, some friends of mine felt that it was a bit too hot. If that sentiment was true, it is drinking superbly right now. Still, I am sure a year or more of cellar time would do wonderful things to this brew. My final thoughts are that this fits in perfectly with the rest of Pretty Things exceptional line of beers. BAs not within the distribution area of this brewery should be setting their sights on Baby Tree and the rest on the lineup."
"Quite drinkable - might be a good gateway Quad for the uninitiated."
"Pours a clear and lightly translucent mahogany hued brown color with a big light tan colored head of big bubble fluffy foam that settles quickly. Shallow surface collar kept alive by underlying effervescence. The smell is good too...earthy Belgian yeast, figs and plum. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied and creamy. A damn fine drinker; taste is sweet and fruity, like my favorite Belgian Strong Dark Ales without significant signs of the 8.7% ABV. Had a ton of fun with this one; going back for more :p"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a crisp carbonation."
"Great label! Poured a deep and muddy brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of dark fruits (plums for sure), roastiness, yeastiness, and chocolate. Tastes of the same dark fruitiness, chocolate, breadiness, candi sugar, and some nuttiness. Alcohol content overall well hidden."
"Pours a rich, muddy brown with a silky tan head. Some light lacing. Nose is quite fruity with spicy yeast, plums, bready malts and a tinge of alcohol. Taste lacks the complexity I look for in this style. Nice bready malts, Belgian yeast and more plums. Body is a bit thin, but well carbonated."
"I'm really impressed at the Pretty Things artisanal beer/community project thingy whatchamacallit. I want them to keep 'em coming!"
"Drinkability is top notch. Delicious, a very nice quad."
"Another tasty one from Pretty Things. Possibly a good cellar candidate. Not the biggest Quad, but plenty interesting and quite fruity."
"An interesting Quad, adding dark fruit to contribute to the normal dark fruit profile. High drinkability as well. Recommended."
"Brownish amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is dark fruits.Taste is dark fruit soaked in alcohol and sugar cane.It has a nice mouthfeel and warmth to it.Very smooth despite high alcohol levels.I would recommend at least one try and I would gladly purchase again."
"I liked Baby Tree. It's not as intense as other Quads, but it has a pleasing fruity maltiness and a nice dryness in the finish."
"Like a true Quad: Lots of alcohol warmth, dark malt flavors with a touch of sweetness. Some spiciness in the swallow. Short lived aftertaste. Only distraction is the thinnish body--just under the standard. Overall, a very nice entry into the Quads."
"D: The quad designation is somewhat misleading; this is just a straight up good, dark, higher octane brew with some Belgian characteristics. Suspend disbelief on style expectations and enjoy. It's an engaging, inviting offering from Pretty Things that embodies the fecundity of late Spring."
"I like this but I want to like it more. Maybe 'cause I'm an unabashed homer that wants to see a plan come together like the Pretty Things Project. I don't want to only drink this out of local loyalty. I'm straddling the fence. It's good, and I'd have no shame sharing it with anyone. Could it be better? Of course. Ditch the butts deal and this is an excellent local with a Belgian take. As is, it's merely quite good. I'll definitely look for it again."
"22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Bottled April 2009 First Batch indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Poured a murky plum color with a half inch creamy, off-white cap. A swath of thick lacing is revealed with each tilt of the glass. Mild nose, but definitely picking up belgian yeast, candi sugar and some dark fruity esters. Taste is consistent with nose, but dark fruit (plumes/prunes) really comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lightly effervescent with a slightly dry finish. Solid Quad. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the offerings from Pretty Things."
"I prefer this as it warms to the 55 and higher temp. It does seem to follow Belgian Quads in style. While good, it isn't quite in the ranks of the best Quads. Having another small, high quality brewery (project) in Philly like this is appreciated."
"Jesus Christ, I used to say no one could brew a decent Belgian quad except for the Belgians and Unibroue from Canada, but this has proven me wrong. It's definitely not Dann's previous Rapscallion Creation type quad, this is very much it's own beer and with the addition of the plums actually very true to style. This beer can hold it's own with Chimay or Westy any day of the week. Kudos to Dann. Every beer you've brewed is phenomenal."
"Final Thoughts - Good sipping quad. I really enjoy this new brewery propject. Even in Boston they can be a little difficult to find, but they are well worth the effort."
"mmmm...Pretty Things...bad name, great brewery! Dan used to bring oddities of his years ago while he jumped around breweries & they were always anticipated. Much like reading about the new offerings now, the anticipation is quite itchy! My wife & I eagerly grabbed up another First Batch for the evening of bison burgers & spinach salad. Brewed last month, we happily started the dinner with this lovely 1p9.6oz big bottle of lovely Belgian Quad-style plum ale...mmm, plum. The pour was a nice cloudy brown with reddish hue and minimal head & lace, but an immediate banana aroma that disappeared and did not linger in the slightest. The dark plum-skin - currant wheat aroma prevailed thereafter, but not in any overwhelming manner. The flavor was likewise with some wheaty-malt & lemon peel, leaving a bit of mustiness in the nose. Quite a delicious dinner session."
"I tend to find that most (not all of course) Belgian style beers brewed in America tend to fall just short, coming across as a bit of an imitation. But this one is just great. It did not cross my mind that I was drinking a particular style of beer, or beer from a particular region meant to taste like X Y or Z, but simply that I was drinking good beer. That's the way it should be."
