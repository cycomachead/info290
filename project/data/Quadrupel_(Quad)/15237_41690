These aromas reappear in the taste, combined with some hints of chocolate and coffee and a little smoke in the afterstaste. You can really taste that this beer is matured in wine and calvados barrels. But all these different tastes are so well balanced, which makes it a top class beer.","Wanne","Mar 08, 2015"

The use of calvados barrels as a finish is what really elevates this higher than the standard oak aged. Great wine, grape,plum, and rum flavors that aren't as prominent in the Reserva. Hope I can find more of this.","MarcWP","Nov 20, 2014"

3.99,-7.2,,,,,,"Hauled this 2009 bottle back from Bruges, Belgium. Pours dark brown in my glass with some purple showing in the edges where the light comes through. Small off white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma of dark fruits, figs, plums, light molasses and even chocolate, candi sugar. Flavor is sweet plums and figs, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolateyness, and a smooth nuttiness from the barrel. Age showing a bit here with some oxidization going on. Thick body, low plus carbonation, really rich and palate coating. Nice beer but would like to try one a bit fresher as this wasn't nearly the level of Reserva or even the regular version. Still yummy though, which speaks to how good those are.","BMMillsy","Nov 13, 2014"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, candied fruit, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with candied fruit, caramel, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

This has the power of an ancient Quad, the wine fruit scent and the deep dark earthy tastes that just gets better as it warms up. My new all time best beer of any style, could drink this exclusively if suddenly the rest of the world forgot all their beer recipes and all you could drink was this. Sorry I cannot include more descriptive terms, like steak, mushrooms and biscuits, but if you get the idea that this beer is awesome I have said enough.","RockAZ","Jan 27, 2013"

4.2,-2.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. 2008 vintage. Deep dark brown, nearly black pour with one finger tan head with minimal retention, but nice lacing. Somewhat subdued nose initially, but it comes alive as it warms. Very complex and dominated by dark fruit with hints of cherry, vanilla, caramel, and oak, with just a touch of chocolate. The taste is complex as well but definitely dominated by the wood. Hints of dark fruit, specifically figs, cherry, tobacco, brown sugar, espresso, vanilla, and just a bit of cinnamon and chocolate. It has a subtle vinous character to it and tons of wood with a perfect amount of sweetness. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, but very smooth and surprisingly drinkable for a 10% beer. This is definitely my favorite Pannepot and yet another winner from De Struise! A great beer for those who love them aged in wood!","beerdrifter","Apr 05, 2012"

A little too much oak, a little too boozy compared to the others. Not bad by any means of course. Once it warms up fully, I swear it becomes a different beer. I had to adjust my taste score to a 4.5.

Pours a murky plum-colored hue with a creamy, half inch, tan-colored head that eventually recedes into a consistent quarter inch cap. Creamy swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose expresses vinous notes, dark fruit, anise and nutmeg. Taste consistent with nose; however, the dark fruit character is much bolder than in the nose. There is also a suggestion of Belgian yeast in the flavor profile as well as some metallic notes towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant carbonation that falls just short of lively. Some residual alcohol heat also peaks out the finish. All and all, a very good Quad; however, I can't say that I really pick up any of the oak aging. That said, at the price point this beer comes in at, I would have to say that St. Bernardus Abt 12 is still the way to go.","Jwale73","Jan 30, 2012"

Smell is old dark fruit with plum being the focus. Faint sour apple with some faded roasted malt scent. Some port like quality with grape and small fig. Cant really pick up the barrel, this is an old bottle here. Taste is way left field at this point, perhaps past the point of no return. Dark fruit and some tartness has taken on effect. It's different and pleasant but not what im looking for in a quad. Plum and some apple with grape, sour grapes, Port like flavors, calvados. This is far off from a normal quad. Feel is a big medium and the carb is tame, yet this leaves a tart zing when sipped. I vastly preferred the Pannepot Reserva to this 'grand' version.

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Trying this side-by-side with the regular was a very interesting experience. Both beers are excellent, but I'd give the slight edge to the regular due mainly to a slight edge in mouthfeel. I also feel like the sweetness of the Grand Reserva might make it tough to drink more than one bottle, where the regular Pannepot is just so easy to drink. Overall, however, I'm just nitpicking. Both are great beers.","starrdogg","Nov 06, 2011"
3.7,-14,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"2005 Vintage. Had to finally try this one after thoroughly enjoying the standard and Reserva versions. It pours a dark cherrywood topped by finger of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises fig, brown sugar, toasted caramel, light oak, very light vanilla, dates, walnuts, dark fruit, very light cocoa, and a small touch of green apple. The taste holds notes of dark fruits, pear, oak, brown sugar, toffee, clove, light vanilla, and light white wine grapes. The fruitiness is a bit off-putting, particularly the sour-leaning pear and spicy grapes. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, it's a solid beer, but I think the barrel-aging detracts significantly from the great base by introducing a number of new flavors that clash with the pre-existing ones. Still pretty good, though, interestingly...","TMoney2591","Nov 04, 2011"

4.2,-2.3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"It pours a muddied and syrupy dark brown, full bodied, with the look of creek water after a good rain. It looks great for the style. The aromas are big and malty. It's very bready and also features raisins, spiced rum, toffee, molasses, cloves, and sweet banana like esters. The flavors are heavy on raisin bread, toffee, smooth malts, molasses, and it finishes with a light yet boozy banana finish. It drinks very full and has a moderate amount of alcohol. It is also exceptionally smooth. Overall this is a fine quad with good complexity and well worth a try.","aasher","Oct 23, 2011"
4.55,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This 2005 bottle came courtesy of Bermans in Lexington. Pannepot Grand Reserva pours out a dark chestnut color, with just a small amount of white heading. The first thing I get from the nose is brown bread, followed by chocolate, candy sugar, pepper and some stone fruit. The flavor is very jammy, with elements of plum, dark cherry and strawberry. The alcohol is held in check in an incredible way given the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is the standout here in that it is incredibly smooth and well rounded from first sip to last. I have had many versions of Pannepot over the years, and I have to say that none have impressed me in the way that this one does. It is so damn smooth and complex. It rivals any of the Trappist Quads out there, and surpasses some of them. Despite the steep price tag, this is one to hunt down. I would be interested to see what further aging will do to this beer, but it is drinking wonderfully right now.","jamie2dope","Oct 13, 2011"

There is a bunch of depth to this brew to savor and enjoy. The alcohol is initially well balanced and countered by the residual sugar, but as it warms up it gets a bit boozy and the 10% abv is wide out in the open and not hidden at all. This is medium to full bodied leaning more towards full than medium. It's light to moderate carbonation is perfect to give some bubbly life to this brew but not distract from the deep rich flavors. This is a fantastic sipper, among the best I have had not only from struise but across the board in the quad category.","stakem","Jun 28, 2011"

Instead, the aging has left slight nuances of oak and vanilla throughout that really do compliment the brew. Wonderful nose, flavors, and a beautifully creamy palate that plays the supporting role perfectly. A classic example of an oak aged brew. Well done gentlemen.","Jeffo","May 19, 2011"

Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, toffee), average hops (flowers, herbs), average yeast (horse blanket, earth, leaves) with notes of dates, vanilla, and cinnamon. Picked up alcohol smells as well. Taste of Beligan candy, bittwer sweet, oak, and champagne flavor. Full bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish.

The biggest weakness here is a strange astringent bitterness around the edges, which comes off as almost sour and simply doesn't belong in this brew.

Spotty lacing encompasses the circumference of the tulip glass. The aroma is of an authentic Belgian quad: yeasty, bready, enticing. The taste is incredibly smooth and delicious. Five years of age on a well crafted quad does some wonderful things.

The label (from the Ontario importer Roland + Russell) claims it's limited to 30 Hl / 2 years. That's not a lot, but it implies they at least intended to rerelease it...but the fact is, it's hard to get (I saw it going for over $100 a bottle at some beer bar in the Bay area after I traded for it, although I doubt they really sell it at that price), which hurts the score a bit, even if I'm in love at the first whiff...","ccrida","May 18, 2010"

4.4,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Out of a vintage 2006 bottle this beer was a dark, burgundy color with two fingers of beige head that retained well and left rings of lacing down my glass. The aroma was of dark fruits, roasted malt, toasted malt, sour apples (from the French Oak barrels) and spices. The flavors were complex and highly advanced. I hate to sound pretentious, but this would roll right over a pedestrian beer drinker. I tasted the French oak, an array of malts, plums, raisins, simple syrup, brown sugar, port wine, buttery bread and alcohol on the finish. There was so much going on and the elements were so well blended it was difficult to discern the spices but this impressive montage of flavors was reflective of how well executed the beer was. My only complaint was the French oak plus Calvados that the beer was aged in came through so strongly, especially as it warmed up, that it suppressed some of the more subtle elements. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation medium.","thekevlarkid","Feb 01, 2010"

4.44,3.3,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Another great beer by one of my new favorite breweries. Pours dark burgundy with mild carbonation. Nose is a deep vanilla, notes of rum, chocolate, and burnt malts. Hints of lavender and I detected a small amount of nice yeasty funk at the beginning. Oak/vanilla elements dominate the palette, with mild sweetness and bitterness, and a very slight tartness. No detectable Belgian yeast phenols, though there may be a slight kiss of Brettanomyces. Is this really a quadrupel?: tastes more like an oak aged stout/porter.","gyllstromk","Jan 08, 2010"

The body is as you would expect - medium carb and weight. Raisins also come through strong in the flavour, as well as there non-dried, still on the vine counterparts.

The oak is well integrated into the overall flavour of the beer, and just adds to the complexity instead of screaming "OAK." I'm glad I got the chance to try this, as it really is outstanding, but the price point (about $14 per 330ml bottle in Alberta) seems a tad excessive.","markaberrant","Jun 20, 2009"

Excellent head retention, with two fingers of foam settling to a finger's worth over several minutes, leaving behind some chunky, clinging lace. A thin cap lingered right through to the bottom of the glass. Big dried fruit aroma, mostly raisins, with some earthy prune skin and figs. Lots of malt too, rich and sweet, with notes of molasses and toffee dominating, along with cake and dough in the background. Kind of smells like fruitcake, but much better than that, with a hint of boozy rum. Wood character was quite subdued, but there was a bit of vanilla in there. Very fruity flavour too, again with the dried fruits mentioned above, but with more of a fresh plum character. Alcohol was more pronouned than in the aroma, as were mellow oak tannins. Alcohol was a little spicy in the finish and vanilla appeared here as well. Lots of sweetness, but just a little of that was from brown sugar and toffee flavours, more from the fruit department. Finished with a bit of cherry sourness. Pretty tasty. Medium to full bodied with creamy, lowish carbonation, just a bit of astringent dryness and plenty of warmth. Really quite good and pretty drinkable for a big beer.","DrJay","Oct 30, 2008"

I am really enjoying this beer. The oak character is very soft, which is nice, with the biggest influence being the rum / brandy notes picked up from the calvados cask. This is a very good beer, one which I easily wish I had more than 330ml of; my bottle is gone way to fast leaving me really wishing that I had more.

Taste is intense, tons of fruit, wood, wine, caramel, butter, bread, tart and earthy, red wine, cherries, alcohol comes through in finish, bites the tongue.

Great carbonation with a full body and no discernable alcohol notes.

Taste follows this well with the breadiness mixing with the raisin and dark fruit sweetness up front, a small amount of the slightly tart cherry and apple comes in mid taste and blends well with some spices and a good woody flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body, decent spiciness mid taste to the finish cuts through the maltiness and leads into a good dryness, a small amount of alcohol warmth at the back of the throat in the finish.
