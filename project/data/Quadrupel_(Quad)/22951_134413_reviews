"An interesting tack to take with such a big brew, one that doesn't usually benefit from exposure to wood, but it's been done before, and will be done again - here, the results are rather ineffectual, overall, so it's not really worth spilling any more words over.  In and of itself, this is an easy-drinking, generally pleasant Quad ale, none too complex, but so what?"

"I am normally a fan of Clown shoes but this one did not do it for me.  At this point I would say Quads don't need bourbon barrel aging.  Not sure what it added to this beer.  Too sour for the style."

"This is a good, enjoyable beer, which I find to be true to the style.  I read some of the reviews where people are venting their spleens, and I think it's a bit much.  It is true that the bourbon barrel taste is virtually non- existant, and I understand people get hacked about that because it usually adds about $2 to the price, when declared.  But when I see ratings at the the level of piss in a bottle, it's way overboard.  This is a good, not great or unique Quad."

"Overall - I generally believe that quads don't need to be barreled, but if you're going to do it, this is a textbook example of how. Restrained barreling that adds to and doesn't overpower a solid quad. If a bit alcoholic, I love that complex profile, espexially the toasted oak and yeast spice balancing the sweetness."

"I'm sorry but this beer isn't to style. This beer isn't good.  It's 14 dollars a bottle which is a joke.  If you LOVE overly sweet and non complex flavors this might be worth a try.  For all else run."
"The aroma conjures the taste of caramel, creamy vanilla, cranberries, and some nice raisin. A good balance of bourbon, tartness, brown bread, and earthiness summarizes the flavor appropriately. A sweet black cherry addition is very enjoyable. The finish is a tad herbal and sharp, with perhaps a bit of a clove element to it as well. Although the body and mouth feel are moderately light, the warming sensation is heavy... and in this case, it's quite welcome. I don't think anyone who seeks out a BBA Quad is looking for an easy- drinking beer! Overall, this is a memorable entry in the style.  A note to future drinkers and in reference to other reviewers: It's essential to enjoy this beer chilled, slightly above room temperature. If you try to have it right out of the fridge the flavors do not come through properly; you are not getting the correct experience out of it."

"Overall: While interesting, and the only Clown Shoes beer other than Vampire Slayer that I did not find to be a single-note assault of hops like Marine mechanized infantry pouring out of an APC with guns blazing, I don't know that this is a repeater for me. The barrel notes were anything but subtle, and the quad flavors were 100% ester with little to no malt evident. Still, a decent beer."

"O-Wow this one is not as advertised very little  BA qualities did  have  some good  Quad flavors this is not one of CS best efforts , not recommended"
""
"If it's optional why do I have to review it?"
"Overall decent and enjoyable, but not what I was looking for in a Belgian Quad."
"This beer was so soured, what a disappointment. I had literally purchased it a week prior and have been on a bourbon barrel aged kick recently. Being a home brewer about 4 years now I have had one batch I produced with a simile outcome. That I paid $14.50 for a commercial producer's soured product is very disappointing. Unfortunately turns me off from trying their regular stuff. Best of luck to these guys with QC in the future. Tasted of lactobacillus, pediococcus and Brett."

"There is something off about this beer; the tartness is completely out of place both for the style & the Clown Shoes taste profile. It’s not bad enough to engage my delicate gag reflex, but it’s nothing I’d be happy to pick out of a lineup. Not very good."
"If I had another Peace, I would age it and hope for developing complexity.  Not going to get another. Good to try once"

"No review to give now."

"Overall, the aroma of this is inviting, but the richness and stickiness accompanied by so much sweet candy like flavors just doesn't do it for me. I'd like a little more bourbon character."
"22 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 12/16/2014. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, light bourbon, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark malt, and light-moderate barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, light bourbon, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, candi sugar, pepper, clove, oak, bourbon, vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of dark malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of dark malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and light-moderate bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Tart wood and medicine taste. I had to drainpour. I am not a big believer in bad bottles, but this may change my mind. I am just not sure how others enjoy this otherwise."

"A nice quad. Not setting any records, but enjoyable. Would consider cellaring, but I'm not sure it would improve."

"This beer just didn't do it for me, too much alcohol taste"
"I have been very impressed with Clown Shoes Barrel aged beers, but I would never have known if this one didn't say so on the bottle. Certainly drinkable, but I was pretty disappointed with it."
""
""
""
"A bit thin with just hints of BBA character. A bit of heat and actually quite boozy. A good quad overall, but falls short as a BBA one. I expect some age to do some good for this brew."
""
"I'll say up front, I've grown to be quite a fan of Clown Shoes; they make some really good beer, and they are responsive and friendly on forums here. But, this offering falls a little short. In the taste, there are hints of brilliance—cherry, toffee, stonefruits, molasses, tobacco, smooth bourbon—but it is all a bit messy and harsh. Don't get me wrong, it's good, and for a lot of breweries, it would be the best in their portfolio; but relative to the high bar CS have set for themselves, it leaves a little to be desired. I may have to buy another bottle, because if another 18+ months smooth this out at all, it would be a giantkiller."

"Has a fruity, plum, bourbon spice nose. Pours Chestnut with a slight haze under an off-white foam cap. It has a super creamy palate with bourbon, toffee, vanilla and spice. A light initial sweetness dries on the finish. There is some alcohol heat that grows on its way to your stomach. The carbonation is very soft and airy and gives the beer an impression of less body than it actually has. As it warms the bourbon becomes more apparent."
""
"I love the subtle bourbon barrel notes. Not overpowering, JUST right. The quad itself is a little thin. Very little head, no lacing, somewhat watery mouth feel, a little too sour for the style. Overall I think the beer is still successful, but it's all in the taste. Pricy, but worth it if subtle bourbon barrel notes in a quad sound like your thing..."
""
"O:  Wonderful beer. Bourbon aged beers and quads are among my favorites.  I should seek out this combination more often."
""
""
"Pours brown in color with a fluffy off white head that retains nicely. Smell has a doninant Belgian yeast aroma over toffee malt notes bourbon and oak barrel are almost non existent in the nose. Taste has a nice balance between a fruity prune and cherry Belgian yeast flavor along with a semi sweet toffee malt. Bourbon and oak barrel are much more prevelent in the taste than the nose with finishing notes of caramel oak and vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body with high carbonation and a dry sticky finish."

"I salute Clown Shoes for their five year milestone and enjoy celebrating it with The Peace That Money Can't Buy. Despite the fact that the style is a bit out of their typical wheelhouse, this is a solidly brewed quad. Glad to have collected multiples to see how it develops."

"F - Smooth drinking and very nice for the abv. Decent carbonation."
"Really missing the bourbon barrel taste, smell or something. Really good quad but not living up to bring advertised as a BBQ"

"This beer Rocks place it in the fringe nice and cold, then drink as the beer gets warmer the flavor will slow pick up to a very strong taste AMAZING"

"Quads seem to vary. This one seemed more sour then mellowed by the BBA. I've had other BBA aged quads. Track 8 from lost abbey and Avery 5 monks. Both very different than this offering and better. Still love you clown shoes."
""
"O: A nice BA quad that goes fairly light on the barrel but still gets some of the qualities. Quite easy to drink for being 11.5%, making for a nice sipper. Yet another solid anniversary brew from CS"
""
"I've had several of Clown Shoes BA offerings now. While this one seems to be the lightest on barrel character, it's still a nice Quad and great sipping beer."
""
""
"O- was hoping to get more of the barrel qualities but didn't. Even the sweetness usually expected from a quad was lacking. Potential's there but some tweaking is needed."
"O: Surprisingly authentic belgian quad. Barrel character is not too strong, just adds a bit of caramel sweetness and perhaps a little heat. Does not feel nearly as heavy as it actually is, it drinks well for an 11.5% barrel-aged quad in fact. Warms the belly for sure though, so there's no hiding in the end. Very tasty and easy drinking. Well done Clown Shoes, to another 5 years of even more delicious brews."
"way too sweet and where was the bourbon"
