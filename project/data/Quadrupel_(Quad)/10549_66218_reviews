"O – The chocolate is well done, but not sure this beer meets the definition of a quad.  Tasty, but ultimately not satisfying."
""

"On tap at a new joint in Arkansas. This is a straight up chocolate truffle. Sweet and chocolatey. Doesn't disappoint-hits the name straight on. Well done."
""
""
""
"A Quad? Seriously? I'm not arguing, I'm just saying this tastes nothing like any other quad I've encountered, and that's totally fine by me. I'd have thought porter or stout judging by the flavors, which are amazing."

"This beer is a chocolate lovers delight.  Rich aroma and taste.  Sweet without being cloying.  Glad I have a second bottle to enjoy later."

"Overall, this beer lives up to its name. From the smell to the taste, right down to the quad base flavors combining with the chocolate to create a truffle flavor, this beer is slightly sweet and very rich."

"Overall, I appreciated the effort and enjoy trying experimental beers from small breweries. Thanks again Tom."

"Overall. A nice brew but with the name I was expecting more chocolate."

"I understand that this beer is supposed to be reminiscent of a box of chocolates, but seriously... This is pretty ridiculous. It's certainly unique, but I can't say it's exceptional. Brb insulin shot."
"Interesting, but not memorable. More like a melted candy than anything else. Some hint sof the Belgian influence, but it's ultimately a better version of Choklat."
"O - Seems like a dessert beer and man it delivers."

"Very nice. This was a great surprise for me at a tasting full of incredible beers."
""
""
""
"O: Like I said, the chocolatiest beer I've ever had, which as a result I have to give this beer high marks. Very tasty."
"O- This was crazy chocolatey, would drink this box of chocolates again"
""
""
"A must try."
"O - I am a big fan of chocolate beer and a big fan of quads I was unsure about this one before I tried it and now I think chocolate and this style are perfect for each other. The sweetness lends to the tame qualities giving this unique mouthfeel without being overpowering or ""hot"" there is something silky about this beer and I dig it. There is a high drinkability here despite the style and I think that might be a bit dangerous. I love this and will be cellaring a few more of these to see just how much like Hershey's syrup this can get like. This is the first beer from Charleville I have enjoyed this much and look forward to more."
""
"Overall, a good brew. Tastes like no quad I've ever had but that doesn't take away from the experience."

"Pours a dark brown color, much like a rich coffee, and develops a very thin veil of khaki head; little retention or lacing, but some scattered bubbles persist across the surface. The aroma is of dark cherry, biter cacao, brown sugar, milk chocolate, plum, date, raisin, and other ubiquitous ‘dark fruits.’ A bit of caramel and chocolate mousse as well. The flavor is fruit-forward in the beginning, highlighting some of the traditional ‘quad’ aspects (date, raisin, a mild yeast character); chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and cacao become more noticeable towards the finish. Sweet cherry and candied prune also come through. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, with the carbonation seemingly keeping the sugars at bay. Finish is relatively clean. Overall, this is a good beer that I’d be happy to have again. It wasn’t overdone in any aspect (not to much or too little chocolate), and I think it turned out nicely."

"This Quad poured out as a very dark brown color. There is a nice creamy looking head on top. The retention is moderate, some very light scattered lacing. The smell of the beer is sweet with a beautiful chocolate aroma in the mix. The taste of the beer has some cocoa flavors with the dark fruits and bready yeast. There is also a slight sourness in there also that fades into a creamy chocolate sweetness. The mouthfeel of the beer has a good carbonation with a medium body. Overall I thought this was really impressive. The balance in the flavor is really good. The chocolate comes and goes nicely leaving the base flavors on the tongue. Very happy I got to try this."
"Good looking pour: dark brown body, fizzy tan head. Aroma is pure milk chocolate. Delicious chocolates of all types inside this bottle; the quad base turns out to be a perfect choice. Fruity, creamy, decadent. A terrific creation that every beer geek should try."
""

"Overall: This is a great spin on this style of beer. I really enjoyed the beer alot. I would love to revisit this beer again someday. A unique and well crafted beer. This brewer has an adventurous side and it really worked well in this beer. No doubt that the brewer hit his mark on what he tried to accomplish with this beer."
"The beer appears dark chestnut brown with a broken head of tan bubbles. The aroma offers a lot of chocolate scents, along with a rich, dark roasted malt. Definitely a huge chocolate presence. Not sure I would identify this as a quad, but hey, it's good stuff. Heavy chocolate presence throughout. Overall, this is ok, but not something I would regularly crave. Now that I have had it, overcoming the anticipation of never having had it, I would choose any of the standard Belgian examples of the style over this. Bonus points for chocolate deliciousness, but counteracted by lack of depth and complexity."
""
"Poured a dark brown into an ""Ales of the Revolution"" tulip glass, tiny ring of tan colored head quickly fades. This quad smells A hell of a lot like tootsie rolls and cocoa powder. Taste Very sweet, rich chocolate flavors, some dark fruits, belgian yeast, and boozy underneath. This is one of the better chocolate beers I've had, I'm generally not a big fan of Belgian style quads but the play on this is exceptional. Would love to have another one of these."
"Edit: This beer was much better on draft when sampled at Bailey's Range in St. Louis at the beginning of 2014."
""
"OVERALL: This was lousy at best. Not off putting, just mute and boring. The chocolate component was mute and the base quad was pretty boring itself as well. I can't believe the high scores this one has received; I can only hope this most recent bottling is over the hill and it was much better fresh. Regardless, I was happy to finally give this one a shot, so cheers for all the hard work bsuedekum. Best to steer clear of this one at this point."
"o - Overall I thought this was an amazing beer; exactly what I was hoping it would be. I think the cloest thing I've had to this is Southern Tier's Choklat, which I also love. Definitely not for everyone but if you like very sweet chocolate and ST's Choklat, you'll love this one. Would love to have it again."
""
""
"The feel is a little thin for me, but it rolls over the palate nicely. Overall a solid beer, I bet girls who love chocolate would absolutely LOVE this beer."
""
"Bottle at the May 2012 iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Well this is really chocolatey. Mainly tootsie rolls and chocolate syrup, but also a little like chocolate soda. Candied dark fruits make a minor appearance along with a bit of alcohol sharpness. Delicious in small servings."

"Overall I definitely enjoyed this beer but I can say I would have rather split it with a friend. The flavors don't change or develop as you consume and in the end this is more of a gimmick than a beer to be honest. It tastes delicious don't get me wrong, but it will never be confused with a world class Quad. All of the Belgian yeast flavors are completely masked by the cocoa/sweet dark caramel maltiness, so I have to deduct points there. Makes for the perfect after dinner drink but I didn't need to consume a whole 22oz by myself, 8-12 would have sufficed. Definitely glad I tried it and recommended for it's quality and unique flavor but don't break your back to track it down."

"Thanks to StLThrash for this one!"

"O - excellent taste. cool recipe. a bit too sweet for high drinkability but it's not supposed to be a session beer. would definitely try again if i had the chance."

"Smooth feel, and full bodied but deceptively light considering the 10.5% abv. Overall a better chocolate beer than Boulevard's Chocolate Ale, for a comparable regional example."

"This is very well done, an interesting take on a Quad with artfully blended chocolate. This is one I'll buy again to cellar"
"O: This one did not disappoint. Thanks to Scoot1969 for hooking me up with this want! Another great beer experience and a beer I would easily have again."
"O- The only word I can think of to describe this is decadence. This was an absolute treat. Thanks to Blake (bsuedekum) for this unbelievably great beer!"
""
""
""
"O: While it's listed as a quad, the chocolate really just overpowers everything. What else would you expect from the name though? The real standout here is the mouthfeel. It's just the right amount of heaviness and sweetness without being syrupy and cloying. It's a joy in each sip."
""
""
""
"O - An amazing brew. Quads are typically hit and miss with me, but this is one of the most enjoyable I have ever tried. It's a shame this is as limited as it is, because it is something everyone should try!"
"Pretty good offering. Great desert beer by the fire."

"Overall nice, very drinkable with great chocolate flavors, no super bitter roasty or estery flavors, and not overpowering."
"Cheers..."
"Nice fresh chocolate finish with light bitter character. Nice."
"Comes close to a one-note charlie, but the beauty of the chocolate is that it's not sickeningly sweet, & allows the base beer to surface for a breath or two. Excellent beer & a must for chocolate lovers."
"What a wonderful brewing experiment. I hope this becomes a regular. It has great drinkability."
"D - The flavor and aroma is nice, albeit lacking in subtly. Quadrupel seems like an odd choice for a base beer and can't seem to compete with the overwhelming chocolate - I'm not sure I'd even know it was a quad if tasted blind. Like anything intensely sweet, this is best consumed in small quantities."
"O: well there was a little debate among the tasting group about whether or not this brew qualifies as a Quad, and none of us could pick up identifiable Belgian characteristics. This makes reviewing as such a little difficult. Either the chocolate is masking all Belgian qualities or this brewing is mislabeled. Either way, it is tasty and full of nice chocolate qualities and it blurs the line between dessert and beer."
"Overall Impression: I’d love to find out how they get the chocolate flavor in this beer. On my first sip, it tasted a bit artificial, reminding me of the chocolate flavor in O’Fallon’s Cherry Chocolate beer, but after a couple of sips, I started to enjoy the rich and complex chocolate and cocoa flavors. Surprisingly, the beer really lived up to its name, with a complex mix of chocolate flavors that reminded me of a box of chocolates. While this isn’t an every day beer, it is a great dessert beer, that I’d recommend after a nice meal."
"D - ABV pretty well hidden and I am a truffle FIEND! LOL."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of chocolate, alcohol (liquor), sweet malt, roasted malt, and a hint of coffee. Fits the style of a Quadruple. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet chocolate, alcohol, slight roasted malt, and slight coffee. Overall, the alcohol is strong in aroma, but well blended in body."
"Overall, this drinks more like a chocolate porter... Certainly not unpleasant, but not worth the crazy hype!"
"Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one during BASC! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and a floral note. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream, and subtle roasted malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The chocolate notes on this one dominated and took NO prisoners! I would not have guessed that it was a Quad based on the flavor and aroma notes going on here at all. It was really well put together and easy to drink. Would have loved to sit down to a whole bottle, but I will take what I can get for sure."
"O - Did not live up to the hype. Just a sweet chocolate beer with no bitterness at all."
"For a quad I imagined a bit of a thicker and boozier experience. I really enjoyed this beer and would gladly drink it again."
"o - overall...i don't know if you can call this a quad. you can definitely call it unique and really tasty. as a hardcore quad fan, i feel somewhat torn giving it such high marks since it is a novelty quad, but as a beer fan who cannot ignore my taste buds, this is worthy beer. chocolate milk as a beer, who would've thunk it?"
"O: It's an interesting beer, definitely worth trying and definitely something a little bit different, but it's not outstanding by any means. The chocolate quad could be very successful, and these guys are definitely on the right track, but I think you need a little stronger of a base beer to make this an overwhelming success."
"O - Pretty damn good. I was expecting it to be more towards the Belgian style, as the cocoa dominates, but its still a tasty beer. Worthy of seeking out. Thanks Kyle!"
"6.4/10"
"O (D) - an appropriately named beer for sure. Not sure if it fits the style (aka, this doesn't seem at all like a quad). But it's tasty."
"Overall a wonderful beer that it was really a pleasure to get ahold of."
"This beer pours the murky dark brown that one could expect from most quads. The nose smells faintly of cocoa powder, respectfully of Belgian yeast, and there's not much more to it than that. Upon sipping...Holy crap this thing taste like chocolate syrup. That rich cocoa flavor is all you taste, and all you need to taste. It's really really good. This beer goes down easy and I could sip on it all day if that were possible. Overall this is a very good beer and one that I highly recommend you try just so your tastebuds can experience the same shock that mine did."
"Pours a pretty dark brown with a lot of off-white head. Its fairly pretty. On the nose there is tons of chocolate. Milk chocolate which is a bit weird but its pretty decent on the nose. No real belgian characteristics. The flavour profile is chocolate heavy. Tons of milky sweetness. Well carbonated. Overall very interesting and fairly tasty"
"It might suck to think you're getting this beer in a trade, only to find an actual box of chocolates come instead. Then again, tastiness will happen regardless... Anyway, this stuff pours a dark, murky black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, light Belgian yeast, vanilla, whipped cream, oats, and light walnut. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, very light mint, vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon, very light roasted malts, and clove. This stuff really lives up to its name tastewise, though the chocolate is extremely dominant, keeping most of the quad characteristics at bay. Damn tasty, though. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth-ish feel. Overall, a very nice brew. The only negative I can really come up with is the seeming lack of most of the quad character. Having that mix with the chocolatiness would create a ridiculous beer, I think. Still, this is some tasty stuff, lemme tell ya!"
"O: A very nice drink, though I perceive this one to be more of a novelty beer than a complex sipper. Flavor profile is very one dimensional, but it does come through with the chocolate."
"O - Very nice. Very true to it's name."
"O - Decent, but really more of a letdown for how hyped this one was originally. I can get past the fake chocolate and lackluster mouthfeel to really say it deserves anything more then slightly above average."
"pours a dark brown that’s a bit watery, light tan head, ok ring... the aroma is outstanding, smells like a trappist quad mixed with Dr. Pepper and chocolate, additional notes of dark fruits, unique twist on a quad... the taste is not as successful, comes across a bit fake, summed up simply as chocolate soda, a little too carbonated, but drinkable incredibly so for something that is 10.5%, mostly chocolate... not up to the hype but very solid"
"Overall it's really a chocolate beer, and not really a quad. The quad elements are very muted by the overdone chocolate flavors."
"Overall: Nice chocolate flavor. There were more other flavors in the mix than I expected. Really good and I would love to have more."
"(sampled at Dak’s Memorial Day tasting. I think Dak broke this open!). Pour dark brown with a tan head. Aroma is all milk chocolate . The flavor follows suit with sweet chocolate and some tootsie roll. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Slightly bitter finish, but balanced. Pretty nice beer with nice chocolate flavor, but the hype machine is in full tilt for this one."
"Drink- So low bottle count, high buzz. Nice flavors but I wasnt blown away. Its good but a unique take on a classic style."
"Pours a murky super dark brown with a 1 inch beige head that fades to an oily cap. No lacing with this beer. Smells of chocolate covered dark fruits (raisins), chocolate syrup, and chocolate taffy. Taste is pretty much the same with dark fruits in chocolate, chocolate syrup, and cocoa powder. The chocolate smells and tastes are a bit fake smelling for the most part even though the bottle says ""brewed with natural chocolate flavor"". Not too impressed with that aspect of the beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with a decent level of carbonation. Overall, this is fairly good but not as great as I was expecting it to be based on the hype. However, I know there was a low bottle count on this one so I feel lucky that I got to try it."
"This is a damn good beer. It seems to be built on a nice, rich and study base quad. I’d like to try the base beer as well. Box of Chocolates is a dense, rich sipper for the chocolate lover."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to birchstick for this bottle! Pours out the darkest quad I've ever seen, dark brown, almost black, small head that was gone in a flash and no lacing. Looks lifeless after a minute or two. Big wafts of chocolate, mostly of the Tootsie Roll variety, with just a small touch of quad characteristics in the background, notably dark fruits and maybe some cherry. Smells great, as this thing is basically all chocolate. Taste is pretty damn similar to the nose. All chocolate. I'm losing the Belgian characteristics here as there's not much of the yeast coming into play. Again, the Tootsie Roll qualities come out once again, with just underlyng of dark fruit/raisin, and a touch of caramel. Alcohol isn't noticeable at first put comes out and is slighly hot when the beer warms. Creates some nice, chocolaty belches! Good, medium-full body, light(er) carbonation. A very nice chocolate beer. It really dominates everything, so if yours is the sweet tooth and the cocoa bean is your dark master (a la George Costanza), you'll love this as much as your Bosco."
"Black with a dark brown head with excellent retention and nice lacing, this is a gorgeous quad. The nose smelly like Hershey's Chocolate Syrup with some milk chocolate added. Belgian yeast character is present, mildly at that, with a little bit of spice. Apart from that, I smell chocolate, chocolate and some chocolate. The palate opens thin and chocolatey, while paradoxically tasting rather syrupy at the same time. Not very complex, there's chocolate and tootsie roll here. Sweet, this beer is light in body and has a noticeable caramel character. Not much yeast expression on the palate either. Not very complex, but moderately delicious, in small quantities."
"This beer is sweet like milk chocolate but has that artificial chocolate flavor all over it. I don't know if it is artificial chocolate or not but it tastes like milk chocolate and a tootsie roll the entire time. It has a wet finish and no aftertaste at least. It is super sweet and not my favorite."
"I was expecting a better integration of fine chocolate with the dark caramelized fruit flavors of a belgian style quad. The concept seemed really interesting and I imagined it much differently. Instead this is like a sweet chocolate bomb from the lost recipe vault of Southern Tier."
"O - Overall a very good beer. Taste is excellent, smell is very good, with the one downfall being the mouthfeel. An interesting beer for sure, and I'm glad to have tried it!"
"Overall this was a pretty big disappointment, im stunned at the reviews its gotten so far. This beer is quite simply not good."
"It is really hard to find a ""good"" chocolate beer in my opinion. This one is not too bitter or too sweet. I really appreciate the fact that they consulted a chocolateer while developing this beer. It has a great nose and look when poored. I was also fortunate enough to try it on draft at the St. Louis Microfest last weekend, and enjoyed it even more on tap. I highly recommend this beer to anyone looking for a chocolate beer unlike most others."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. Very unique offering from a relatively unknown brewery that gives a traditional style a modern twist. It's not bad at all but not life-changing either. If typical quads have you in a rut, seek this out and live a little!"
"O- Great beer we have here. Would easily drink this again, if we had one, it would be open. Big thanks to Tyler for hooking this beer up!"
"Overall: This is at the top for me when it comes to quads for sure. I would love to score this one again. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Its a nice change of pace from all the imperial stouts and IPA's that I drink. Look forward to it again."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malt. The chocolate is nearly overwhelming and really melds well with the dark fruit notes from the quadrupel. The flavor is more of the same. The chocolate tastes like malted milk balls, with some roasted malt and a little bit of raisins and figs mixed in. Thick mouthfeel and medium mouthfeel. Definitely a chocolate-heavy beer that somewhat surprisingly mixed well well with a traditional Belgian quad."
"Overall it's pretty damn fine stuff. Great stuff from Charleville, a brewery with a bright future no doubt."
"Overall, I don't know whether this is one of the best American quads I have had or if it is nothing more than a solid attempt. My thoughts changed with every sip. Hmmm"
"D - Interesting take on a quad. The name Box of Chocolate is very appropriate for this beer as chocolate is the main theme with the quad characteristics playing more of a supporting role; I was expecting it to be the other way around. Really good stuff from Charleville."
"Meets the hype, IMO. Although if you're not a quad fan, then I don't imagine this one will suddenly make you a believer. It's merely a very nice, well-made cocoa-infused twist on the style."
"This is a fantastic beer and I really like what the chocolate brings to the table. One of the most unique quads I've ever had."
"O: A bit hard to drink through a whole bomber, so more of a dessert beer, but a great dessert beer at that. Hope they brew this one again!"
"O - Really good. Its just so tempting to down it. Really a delicious beverage and one that I'm really glad to have tried. I was debating on saving it to get some age on it but I wonder if that will effect the chocolate. Nevertheless, a really good beer and worth seeking out."
"Pours a medium brown with short off-white head that sticks around for a bit before falling to a thin collar. Not too much lacing. The nose is fairly light with some nice notes of chocolate and a bit of dark fruits in the background. Very nice. The taste really explodes off of the base the nose had going. It's just as described: a very nice quad with layers of chocolate over the top. The chocolate character is really dominant, and the quad underneath is spot on as well. Nice mix of dark fruits, raisins, and semi-sweet malt. A bit of brown sugar as well. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth and doesn't reveal the 10.5% at all. Overall, a very solid beer and its acclaim is well-deserved."
"O - I am glad that I picked this one up and that I have a couple of additional bottles to drink. I don't think that they are going to last long. This is a really good beer, although some might find the chocolate too one dimensional. Given what they were looking to do, this one is exceptional. Go get this one, you will enjoy it."
"The body is medium to medium-heavy with a light carbonation that softens the consistency a bit and makes this a delight on the palate. A very solid offering, and I am surprised that this has flown under the radar as much as it has to this point. Get your hands on some. It will be worth it."
"M - this is hard to rate. On one hand it's"
"Drinkability:This is a fantastic spin on a Belgian Quad. The chocolate could easily overwhelm a beer like this, but the backbone of the beer still makes itself known."
"Overall, this was an absolute treat to drink! Fantastic flavors and the beer is everything Charleville said it would be. With the superb taste, rotating production, and low 600 bottle production, I expect this under the radar beer to start drawing some attention."
"This was a nice take on the Belgian Quad. Smooth and easy to drink but too chocolatey to have more than one."
"I would suggest looking for this beer both on tap and in a small release of bottles."
