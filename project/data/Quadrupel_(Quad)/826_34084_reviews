"Mouthfeel"
"O:  a bit sweet and definitely darker -- the licorice note exists, though it's not omnipotent here -- but hard not to say it's quite yummy.  fun getting a chance to try it straight from foreign lands.  it's not anything I'd go to great lengths to find, but good brew."
"Flavor echoes, but is more dry than expected, with a bit of alcohol bite."

"Flavor also had a pleasing level of sweetness, with LOTS of dark fruit present. I found raisins, dates, currants and cherries mixed in, with some mild hopping at the finish. A super bier! I loved it and bought three, plus was comped a fourth from the owner. Much obliged, my friend!!  Zum Wohl!!"

"O: A grand beer with big malty flavors, balanced evenly with bitterness and with abundant dark fruity notes. A really nice classic quadrupel that puts many to shame and drinks more like a BSDA with its medium body and low-medium carbonation. Val-Dieu brings it again and it is one of the unsung Belgian breweries in my opinion. I expect excellence from them and again they have delivered!"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 4/2015. Pours fairly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, dark candi sugar, clove, pepper, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light caramel, toast, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding quadrupel style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: like they all said at work - fan-freakin-tastic... a 'quad' with a bruised, fleshy tone... try this shit... do it"

"Val Dieu shows why the legacy of Belgian ale will live on and in the highest of quality possible. Its a unique recipe but is also true to form. Its taste is simply divine."

"The flavor is incredibly subtle and delicious. Slightly sweet dark fruits, some dark belgian candi sugar, that hearty grainy flavor comes up on the back end for a bit of balance, a little bit of alcohol heat on the back and a little bit of lingering sweetness. Incredible subtlety though with a velvety medium body and prickly carbonation. It's a really great beer, for being so big it drinks so easy, simple but well blended flavors."

"The taste is a classic quad, malty earth with hints of leather and almost red wine. There is a noticeable amount of alcohol but it cuts the mouth making a nice dry mouth."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid Quad to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"This beer is like a dessert and after-dinner liqueur all rolled into one. My only gripe is that the booziness, while delightful, is perhaps just a bit too prevalent and lends the beer a somewhat cloying character, reducing the drinkability. Perhaps my palate is just too sensitive and is over-reacting to too much of a good thing. At any rate, this is certainly one of the best quads I have had yet. A delightful drinking experience I must recommend to every fan of the style."
""

"O: While you can tell that this is a strong beer from the sweetness, it hides its alcohol very well from the taste. This is exactly how I like my quads - with lots of fruits and a good amount of sweetness."
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the style Quadrupel."

"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"I'll admit I did represent this brewery in California in 2007 and found all their brews excellent...great yeast and big malt profiles. The Grand Cru has a touch more of a bite than the others, but nevertheless a lovely beer, fresh or with a few years age."

"While maybe not on a totally even par with the Rocheforts and Westvleterens of this focused little world, Val-Dieu's Grand Cru (I just love saying that, for some reason) still comes off as a serious player, in both flavour and otherworldly complexity. I still can't inwardly reconcile how they sneaked a 21-proof ABV offering past me so cleanly, so additional kudos for that."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a re-buy"
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Really good beer. Great aroma. Flavor is not on par with the very best quads. Just not the traditional Belgian flavor of the very top Quads. Has a lot more caramel flavor, and lacks some of the sweetness. Never the less, this is a really good beer."
""
"Taste is chocolate covered bananas with a dusting of cloves...interesting and tasty belgian offering. Id go more BSDA than quad but that is mainly due to the spicy zestiness the beer throws down. Interesting blend of flavors, but a bit on the sweet side for me and the phenols are raging."
""
""
""
"Aroma and flavor of dark, candied fruit, caramel, toffee, clove, banana, tart Branston pickle, ginger, lemon and orange peel, and honeyed melon, cherries, grapes, and pears. Very complex and appealing with just the right level of carbonation. One of the better Grand Crus I’ve tasted."

"O: One of the best Quadrupels I've tried in a while (or ever). Very, very drinkable."
"Pours a deep reddish orange color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. The smell is quite fruity. Orange and cherries and raisins in front of a solid caramel and darker sugar back drop with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is quite fruity as well with orange and citrus mixed with some sweet cherries raisins and plums. A solid caramel and melanoidin malt sweetness provides a nice balance against the fruit. There's a warming alcohol, but its very faint and never harsh. Medium to thick body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is a very nice quad, the citrus flavor adds a nice dimension to this brew."
"A very rewarding and in every sense great beer."
"Man, this was a damn good Quad! It was extremely flavorful and smooth for the size and was just a real treat to end our meal with. I’m glad we can get these beers in the States. Val-Dieu is on my radar in a big way now."
""
""

"O: Good drinkability. Nice Quad"
""
"Mark was right. (not that I doubted him) This is a great beer."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"M-very drinkable, if the abv wasn't so high could session this one!!"
"Served in a Val-Dieu chalice, which was a nice surprise. Very dark brown, nearly black in the dim lighting with an attractive silky beige covering on top. Sweet raisin aromas dominate upfront, opening up to reveal strawberry, cherry, caramel, chocolate, banana, and vanilla...very nice. Somewhat less fruity flavor, though the raisin continues along with plum, fig, and caramel malt. No booze at all. Medium-full bodied with very light carbonation making it satisfyingly smooth. I really liked this one..."
""
""
"O: A beautiful beer that ranks up there with some of the best Quads and Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I have tried."
""

"This poured out as a deep amber/brown color with a tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer was a little sour ot funky... It worried me a little bit, I was expected a sweet malty aroma and I got something that reminded me of a Wild Ale. The taste however completely made up for the aroma. The sweet malt and candy like flavors that a quality Quad has were in there and very pronounced. The beer tastes sweet with minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it was moderately thick feeling with a low carbonation to it. Overall I enjoyed it, the smell still doesn't please me but the beer in general is quite good."

"Found a bottle gathering dust at one of the beer stores on my regular route. Given the ABV and the quadness, I figured that even if it really had been sitting eternally on a shelf it wouldn't be rotten and old. As it turns out, this really wasn't too bad but it leans toward being gritty-sweet, similar to the frosting on a supermarket sheet cake. Dark-brown to near-black; decent head, if a bit thin; sugary aroma mixed with a Dr. Peppery pruniness; a taste of peaches and figs and then the slightly out-of-bounds sugar. Definitely mellows out upon warming, and makes a nice winter accompaniment to beef stew, popcorn and a decent Hollywood Western. I took about 90 minutes to drink half the bottle; by the bottom of the glass my opinion had definitely risen (although that may just have been the 10.5% talking)."

"Abbey Ale from Belgium, the Val-Dieu Grand Cru pours a clear deep amber hue with an inch of bubbly film. Active carbonation rises from the bottom of the etched goblet. Aromas of grape, belgian yeast, and sweet malts. In the taste, raisin, brown sugar, mild sweetness and finishes clean and dry. Effervescent, medium bodied with very solid flavor. Enjoyable for being surprisingly light given it's strength, and flavorful at that. A fine example of a Quad."

"D- While the aroma and taste were great, this is still a big beer. That being said, the alcohol really mellowed out as compared to the fresh version."
"The nose brings some light roast as well as a good amount of dark fruit and a fairly-prominent anise character. Light booze. Flavor mixes dark fruits and anise quite well, leading to a nice finish after a medium body. Really interesting and tasty."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 750ml corked and caged bottle purchased in 2009. Cork reads 02/10. Pours a hazy mahogany with an off-white head and thick bands of lacing that are revealed as the brew is consumed. Nose suggests a bit of oxidation, yeast and dark fruit (primarily prunes). This beer taste great - vinous, dark fruits interspersed with a subtle spicy character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a crisp carbonation that leaves a residual bite at the back of the throat. A very solid Quad - carbonation is bit too assertive, but not overly off-putting. Not mind-blowing but really quite pleasant."
"O - Strong taste, nice after dinner beer. A very, very good beer."
"Fluid is normal to darkbrown. Little head. Smell and taste are a bit sweet. Well balanced beer where the alcohol was pretty well hidden. Corbonation was normal."
"Overall: Very, very good, in fact much better than I anticipated. This beer may very well end up in my top 10 quad/Bsda’s."
"A good quad, with just a touch too much alcohol heat."
"deep amber in color bordering on a nice brown with a small head of light off white color that quickly faded into obscurity and left some nice lacing along the sides of the glass. Deep boozy aroma here, lots of alcohol present along with some nice caramel malts and a touch of light grassy notes as it warmed. Some nice fruit flavor on the first sip but this is drowned out quickly by the hot nature of the booze. Really could use some time to sit down as it is just too fresh I feel. Still though I push on letting it warm and come through some light touches of raisins, perhaps a touch of light fig now mixing in as well. Smooth, light and subtle carbonation leaves the mouth dry"
"O- Really nice beer in one of my favorite categories. Opens up quite a bit w/ warming. If you see it, buy it. Highly recommended."
"Served on tap, poured into a chalice; a dark mahogany brown with a small eggshell head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Aromas of dark sugars, rich maltiness, and notes of dark, dried fruit. Nice array of flavors on the palate, with yeasty bread, brown sugar and caramel, raisins, pears, plums. Smooth and medium-bodied, and pleasantly drinkable."
"Overall this is an amazing beer: strong, full bodied flavor with a great complexity and lasting finish. Highly recommended."
"O: I believe this sets the standard for Gran Cru's. I found it to be awesome and it beer be at $9"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I paired it with my saltier steak and it was perfect."
"An excellent quad, a good value, with decent aging potential (maybe not enough to warrant picking up a 6L methuselah, but it's nice that you have the option)."
"There are quads out there that have more complexity and bigger flavor profiles. Compared to some of those, this one may not be the greatest beer on the planet. Let those ones stand as a main course. This ones for dessert."
"O: One of the better Quads out there. One of my favorites."
"overall; A nice drink but lacking the usual complexities of the style. Still a great drink and well worth the price."
"Pours dark brown, relatively opaque with some great head and retention. Mild spotty lace. Nose of dark fruits, tons of spice, cloves and pepper, all taking on a subtler and well integrated flavour given the 5 years of age on it. Taste has more of the dark fruits, plum, spice and a nutty quality. Fruits are rich, as is the body. Grape skins and chocolate. Alcohol hasn't yet disappeared. Full body and rich feel to it, not overwhelmingly so. Complex and a nice treat."
"A nice beer, but I don't really feel impressed by it. It lacks the dark, heady flavors that I generally associate with this style, and after a while starts to taste a tad too sweet. Not bad, but I was expecting something more and I'll pass on this in the future."
"jd"
"Wonderful beer. Active frothy head with pour. Used a New Belgium .47L tulip glass. Color is dark, around 18-23 lovibond. Taste was sweet with hints of caramel and red wine. Had a sort of resin aroma. Very active on the palate. Definetly getting more for the price I found it."
"D - This is a top shelf quad, that I enjoyed very much."
"Overall this is a very fine quad. Not complex at all, but quite tasty and easy drinking for the huge ABV."
"Its heft renders it not terribly drinkable, but impressive nonetheless."
"This beer succeeds in every aspect except the most important: flavor. Maybe this bottle needed more age. Yet, with a cork date of 3/12, I would expect this to have been bottled in 2008 or earlier, so it should really be much more drinkable than it is."
"But recent reviews don't match previous reviews."
"Drinkability: Heck yes, get one and enjoy the dark flavors that await. Brewery's best offering maybe?"
"750ml bottle $10. I have always passed up Val Dieu beers and for some reason this caught my eye. Maybe it was the black label? Anyway, this poured a very dark brown and looks like your typical Belgian quad. The smell was fruity and sweet, almost too sweet. The flavor was raisins and sweetness, cloying sweetness. This was not my favorite quad and now I may know better about buying Val Dieu beers."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer, but not that great of a quad, especially for an actual Belgian. Its just too sweet and not multifaceted enough. It was enjoyable enough, but I won't buy it again."
"This beer is a little hotter and a sweeter than I would prefer. There are some nice notes of dark fruits soaked in alcohol and classic Belgian yeast strain flavors, but this is a step below the upper echelon of Belgian quads."
"I'd say this is more of a strong dark than a quad, but all around, it's a great brew."
"D: A solid quad, but the complexity and flavour was considerably better in the Brune which I had back in the day."
"In all, I enjoyed this beer, but I don't think its something I would seek out again. To me, it was a little overpowering and less subtle and complex than other Abbey ales."
"The body was full, rich and smooth. Drinkability was great, couldn't be better. Overall, a true gem of a beer, worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, well balanced, tasty, and lightly boozy"
"A nice deep ruby colored beer with about a finger of white head. Aroma of dark fruits, bready yeasts, some mild sweetness. Taste is similar to the smell, a delicious blend of fruit, spices, and malt. The 10.5% abv is definitely not apparent in the flavor. Overall I really enjoyed this one. Of course, it's not something I'd have more than one of in a sitting, but I'd certainly have one again."
"Very nice looking, dark brown with ruby hues to light. lots of sediment. Huge off white head. Smells of cloves, bread, yummy. Tastses like a medium to thick mouthfeel.tastes of cloves, belgian yeast, a little bitterness in finish. almost metallic. Very drinkable.Nice quadruple. Nice lacing on glass. Finish is a little lacking though."
"Pours a murky medium-dark brown color with a white head. The aroma is cherries, dark fruit, malt and some sweetness. The flavor is dark fruit with a strong malty sweetness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I won't ever drink this cold, but warmed, it is happy for the taste buds (and the warming of cheeks)"
"Worth a try, especially if you like the style. Probably worth a trying in a taste test next to something similar."
"This was delicious. Did not find the alcohol imposing, or even really noticeable. This is like a rich dessert: one is plenty, but you can't help yourself going back for another helping."
"Pours a dense black body that leaves a big head and lace ring down the entire glass. A mix of roasted, coffee, burnt chocolate, toffee, oak, maple...I'm picking up a lot of malts and hints of fruit. A thick bodied and stick beer that is a little dry, has a large portion of roasted and burnt malts with some sweetness from chocolate, vanilla and caramel (even licorice). Not quite sure but I know tasting something like maple or molasses along with a berry type fruit. Finish is dry and a tad bit of an alcohol burn. A quality quad that is meant to sip and enjoy for a very long time...it's just that heavy and like a meal in a bottle."
"Overall, highly recommend aging this one. If only they made it more convenient by placing the date on the bottle instead of the cork."
"Can't believe the reviews give this an A! This is the only Val-Dieu offering i've had... and the only Quad but this doesn't come close to american belgium offerings from Allagash and Ommegang."
"Pour black, with not a thick body, virtually no head, I think this one 5 years old. Still good mouthfeel conistency. Spicey aroma. Taste of cocoa and licorice predominately, still very nice with supper. Rich aged taste, not your coriander. Sweetish spice."
"D - Dangerously so. Buy a few of these and save them for those splendid autumn afternoons."
"D- This beer really opens up as it warms and has a nice mysterious complexity making it a easy drink especially for a 10.50 ABV. It didn't have that wow flavor that pulled in lots of flavors but it was pleasant to drink."
"I was thoroughly impressed with this beer. Just silky smooth, leaving a delectable presence on the palate. Quite an easy drinker too, although it would probably be best to keep this to one or two glasses. Those Belgian Strong Dark Ales and Quads never cease to amaze me with their ability to pack an amazing flavor-punch, yet retain a low alcohol presence, despite the high ABV."
"D-Every day beer....No, but it is a wonderfully crafted Belgian Quad that could be considered a great example of the style. This is the type of beer that I strive to create as a homebrewer."
"M - Creamy, velvety, decent carbonation."
"T + M + D: Flavour is excellent. Creamy, smooth malts - again, a bit of a chocolate, and some breadiness. That provides something of a fruitbread hint with the yeast flavours. Smooth and incredibly easy to sip liberally. Mouthfeel isn't as shimmering, rich, and full-bodied as many of the other quads out there, but it's amazingly smooth. An incredibly tasty beer, and the value is great to boot! Recommended drinking."
"Overall it's not my favorite quad (there are many great examples) but it's very enjoyable and worth a try if you're a fan of the style."
"D- too strong to be sessionable, but goddamn would i want another! very underrated. check thsi one out if you get the chance. one of the best quads ive ever tried."
"Although the head is large and dense, the carbonation is rather low. This was decent but tasted like Coke with yeast. Cant say it is my favorite or even one of the best of the style."
"This beer will only improve, I am already very impressed. Time to set a couple back for 2 or 3."
"D -- What can I say. I enjoyed this brew. It is worth an extended taste test. I would by another case of this, but there are so many beers to try, I will move on for now."
"Notes: This is a fantastic Belgian Ale that is almost like a Belgian Stout! Good complexity, intriguing depth, great flavors, and good drinkability. I'm going to go snag the last bottle off the shelves the next chance I get. Now, if I could just get my hands on the rest of the Val-Dieu lineup..."
"Drinkability is pretty good, one of the fruiter quads, big flavor without being a palate buster. The light body also really drives home what a benchmark example this is of the style."
"D: A very drinkable beer, I could easily sip this all night although the high ABV would get me in the end."
"This is a good little find. Picked it up while in Spain for I believe 6 euro. Not bad for 75cl. I could see this being a gateway to some of the more complex. Not overly aggressive, except its drop kick to my uvula. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to those that enjoy this style."
"Comment: I never noticed the ABV--10.5%--and this is the charm of a well executed and dangerously tasty beer."
"Drinkability- were it not for the high ABV, I would've had more, but I was driving, so I shifted to something with a lower ABV. Next time I come here, not driving, and having more than one of these. Excellent Quad!!!"
"I liked this. If someone was getting into Quads I'd point them in this direction. Very easy drinker for 10.5%!!!"
"Tastes perfect. Excellent. Excellent and perfect. Giant fruit, fresh and authentic like you're on a grove, walking amongst the fruit, and you just pull one right off the goddamn vine and bite into it. What fruit these are, I do not know. It's really fucking tasty, though. Moves into medium-bodied red wine, peppery yeast, pleasant alcoholic zing."
"Mouthfeel is probably one of the best I have ever had, it has this creamy texture upfront that leads to a refreshing crispness at the end. Great, great beer put on to try again list."
"Overall this is on the top tier of quads. All the flavors work very well together and it's so very smooth. Give this one a shot if you see it around."
"The taste is fruity like grapes or cherries. Background notes are sugar and caramel. Very very nice drink. Alcohol is very warming but this is an easy to drink beer."
"Poured into a Chimay glass. Deep brown in color with a medium head, low carbonation. The aroma is of rasins and plum. The taste is a touch of sour rasins, but a mix that is warming as it goes down. The alcohol is well hidden, but hits you at the end. The body if full and rich. This makes for and enjoyable drinking experience. A very smooth drink with a good amount of subtle flavors."
"Drinkability: Great example of the style; I often see the other Val Dieus around, but this should be more widely available"
"Pours a dark purple/black almost prune-like color with a thin off-white foamy head. Aroma is dominated by chocolate maltiness, dark fruit and toast. Very smooth drinking beer that masks the high abv very well. Smooth creamy maltiness lasts throughout with dark chocolate, fig, toast, caramel and toffee notes. Slight dry finish."
"Drinkability: A damn fine beer. First, the reason it's a 4.0: it's sweet, intensely sweet, with tons of sugars hanging around, fruity, malty, etc. It's also slightly medicinal in the phenolic profile, which is enhanced slightly by the dominating lighter fruity flavors (dimetapp anyone?). The alcohol's also pretty high. On the other hand, that alcohol's well hidden, the phenolic, medicinal quality doesn't come through as strongly in the taste, and this is - on the whole - a really damn complex and good beer. I don't know if I can in good faith classify it as a quadrupel - there's too much yeast character and too little malt character - but, regardless, give it a try. Recommended, highly."
"D - So smooth, thin and complex. The 10.5% is extremely well hidden."
"Overall, this is a great Grand Cru and/or Quad."
"This pours a deep mahogany color with a silky beige head. Very nice lacing as well. The nose is very fruity with a sweet candy, bready malts and a good amount of peppery yeasts. The flavor is full of ripe earthy fruits, spicy yeasts, biscuity malts and chocolate. Creamy body is well carbonated and suits this style perfectly. A rich yet well balanced brew from Val Dieu. I'll have to try the triple next."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a full foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma consists of sweet malt with some candi sugar and some dry fruit characteristics. Taste is also a well balance mix between rich Belgian malt with notes of candi sugar and some dry fruits such as raisins and plums. Full body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and some thing that I would have on a regular basis."
"Great drinkability on this, a little high in the alcohol department to drink too many of these in one sitting. I guess though it depends how the night goes."
"Would go perfectly on a picnic, or another hot day when you normally would not want to bottoms up a quad."
"This was my first taste of Val'Dieu Gran Cru and let me tell you that it wont be the last! Like I just read by another taster it has such a silky smooth mouth feel and the lightly well balanced fruity taste was well balanced with the high gravity alcohol level. There is also a slight spice taste that only sneaks in and doesnt take over. I might just have to visit Brasserie De L'Abbey DU Val-Dieu in Aubel Belgium someday and thank them for such a well done brew!"
"D - This is a very good Quad. Only drawback is that it became very heavy by the end."
"D- very good"
"Clear, dark auburn. Big rocky cap of tan froth recedes gradually and leaves nice swaths of lace. Aroma is full of sweet candy, yeasty, estery goodness and warm biscuity malt tones. Very solid flavor profile that exhibits more earthiness than the aroma led on to. The candy like maltiness lends a sweetness to the overall impression. Subtle spice and subtle cookie dough yeastiness. Everything is so subtle, yet so perfect as well. This is truly an intricate work of art. Cinnamon and cardamon. Earthy fruitiness. Mouthfeel is like cotton. So damn smooth. This beer wilts away in the mouth like cotton candy. This whole experience is exceptional. Great, great beer. Owe a thanks to the Zapster for this B-day present. Next time I crack one of these I'll have to whip up some Lobster salad and salmon steaks on the grill and truly make it an evening of Decadence."
"This is big, sweet quad with enough spice to make you wonder if the yeast can really do that much work. It's fruity, of course, with dark fruit of blackberries, dates, and raisins. The spice elements is all very smooth with light vanilla, corriander, white pepper, and cinnamon. My only complaint is that while this doesn't drink cloyingly sweet, it can become a little much and this is a must-share beer."
"750ml bottle, cork says 11/09...I don't know what that means, really. If its 2009 that's in the future so its not bottled date and its too soon to be ""drink before"" for a bottle conditioned ale north of 10%. Oh well. Some things are not for the knowing. Pours absolutely perfectly black with a dense, creamy head that leaves lacing that makes me want to lick the glass clean. Smell is brown sugar, raisins, cherries, vanilla, sawdust, and lemons. :) Taste is oak, cinnamon, raisins, and cloves. Much drier than I expected, with an almost puckering finish. Very nice indeed. Mouthfeel supports the appearance, creamy with a nice tingle of carbonation to offset it. Drinkability is excellent, the bone-dry finish not withstanding. Still won't be an issue at all to polish off the whole bottle. Definitely worth the trouble to acquire."
"Aged bottle, not sure how old but says 03/10 on the cork. Guessing about 4 1/2 years old. Pretty much the same as I remember it being fresh, but super smooth, hardly any alcohol or solvent. Quite sweet, quite delicious, everything is quite integrated into one cohesive whole. Sort of like Christmas pudding. Very nice beer, it aged gracefully."
"Randomly picked from the shelf with no expectations, had never even heard of it. I was immediately impressed. Pours dark as can be, not quite black but a tremendously dark brown, thick off-white head with decent retention and ok lacing. Smell is of a typical Belgian, some bread and yeast, a touch of sweet fruit and a bit of alcohol, a little heavy on the bread smell. Taste is great. It has a very sweet taste to it, very sweet sugar, almost Duvel-ish. Plenty of fruit flavors, a little grassy taste and a warming alcohol taste as it goes down. Medium bodied with low carbonation, a very smooth drinker. the 10.5 ABV is impressive, but whats more impressive is how well its hidden. This is a truely great beer and one I will definitely revisit in the future."
"Very, very nice dessert beer."
"Medium/heavy body. Its not really that viscous but once it hits the tongue it really coats everything nicely. Very drinkable, if it were cheaper I would buy a ton of this stuff."
"Wonderful Beer poured from from caged and corked 750ml bottle. Smells of raisins and fermented apples. Deep Brown color, thin foamy head with nice lacing, head diminishes over time. First sip of the dark caramel-goodness is raisin/plum with citrius and vanillla notes. Slight alcohol taste upfront, alcohol becomes more noticeable as if warms. Nice finish, apples, caramel and yeast become more prevalent as beer warms. Complex but not cloying as some other quads. Fantastic beer highly recommend if you can find. Took my bro and I 2yrs to find our second bottle!"
"Good smooth, slightly fluffy full body that is a pleasure to consume. A very good, solid Quad, that I fully recommend. Chalk another one up for Belgium."
"Fabulous stuff. Just absolute nectar."
"There are a number of better quadrupels out there, but this one is still very pleasant and worthwhile."
"D: It was full bodied and had a high ABV that might limit its functionality as a session brew. It is a sipper and a wonderful treat to share with friends. I intend to add it to my stash for special occasions."
"Glad I tried it, and nothing wrong with it. But there are other quads I prefer."
"A very nice Quadrupel. It's nice to know there are so many good Quads on the market."
"The flavours hung around in the mouth and although it is a strong beer, the thickness wasn't rich or pudding like. Can't put my finger on it, but something was missing. Which is why the drinkability is only a 3.5 score. The no show of any aroma doesn't help either."
"Highly recommended. A very tasty quad indeed - if not one that you can afford to drink every day."
"Drinkability: this beer represented the style well and is a slow sipper. Alcohol will catch up to you with this one. Nice beer worth finding."
"Burgundy color, with a full and creamy foam that lasts. Lightly aromatic, with hints of burnt popcorn, brandy, dark fruit (plum) and the attributes of Belgian Yeast. Flavor is very rich and full, with extremely well hidden alcohol, fruit, chocolate and Belgian yeast."
"Pours very dark, with very little head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is lots of malt, dark fruits, and a little bit of spice. The alcohol is barely present in the aroma and does not even come to the front in the taste. Mouthfeel and carbonation are very nice but this beer is way too sweet for me. I love quads but I think I would turn this down next time. Give me a Rochfort or Pennepot Fisherman's ale instead."
"d - Pretty good. I'd have it again, but I am in no hurry to do so."
"Pours very, very dark -- nearly black, with only shy tawny highlights that show up with the liquid at a very low level. Strong Brussels lacing, little head. One of the darkest Belgians I've ever seen. Aromas are predominantly sweet, with roasted coffee, cola, dark candi sugar, and some bubble gum leading the way. Very rich, sumptuous aroma. On the palate, cola tastes lead the way, from syrupy sweetness right down to that tarty cola tang. Nutty at the mid-palate, then creamy, before drying out at the finish. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and thick malts. Overall, this is a big, sweet, smooth quadrupel. I wasn't crazy about the cola flavors, but it's in line with style and well executed. Very good."
"A pretty decent Belgian Quad here. Val-Dieu's Grand Cru is by far one of the better, top notch brews to be produced by them and worth giving a try. The unique effect of body from start to never ending finish in flavor and tone is the best part(heart) of the whole beer and the main reason to seek it out."
"Taste: mmmm-MMM!!!Espresso whispers, cola hushes, dark fruits and anise, black pepper peeps in, black and chocolate malt, and delicious Belgian malt and yeast. Mmm, darkness and spice aplenty! Yu-um! That's what makes this special, this particular sparkling spiciness....a bit rough in the texture, burrs against the buds to much, methinks...but then this unique and wondrous flavor creeps in ...too much..."
"Mouthfell/Drinkability; the mouthfeel is full bodied, with a nice smooth carbonation, and the drinkability would fantastic if the alcohol was not so high."
"Wonderful beer...wish I had a caseful at hand...alas, and alack!"
"We went to Ebenezer's Pub in Lovell, ME for a party, and Chris had a metheuslah of this beer. Besides the impressive presentation, this is a very good beer. A brown color with a medium head that lingered well. Sweet, fruity aroma. A nice vanilla taste, with the dark fruit and Belgian yeast present also. Lovely beer, very smooth. Didn't know it was 10.5% ABV until I was admiring the bottle."
"for a beer that is 10.5% alcohol, this is very smooth, and i definitely put it right up with the other quadrupels i have tried, 3 philosophers and st. bernardus...great beer, pick it up if you ever find it.."
"Wow, this is one of the better quad's/noel's that I've had in some time. Great flavor, well balanced, and enjoyable from first sip to the bottom of the bottle. I'll probably pick up another few bottles to lay down for a few years. I think that this will age very very well. Highly recommended."
