"Big thank you to @dutesanch for sending me this delicious quad in a trade. I've probably tried 8 quads in my day and this one by far was the best. I drank it with a blackened pork chop marinated in a small batch know creek sauce with white beans and peppers. You will not regret buying this quad the taste is savory with hints of molasses and oak. Delicious!!"

"OVERALL: Really nice. This is certainly a very sweet beer with a massive OG and only 22 IBU, so it might not be for everyone. The people I shared it with all found it to be too much. I love me some malt bombs though, especially if itâ€™s got a good barrel component to go along with it, and this one certainly delivered in both departments. Lots of good flavor and a big feel to go with it. The head could use a little work, but whatever. Thanks again ScottO. Enjoyed this one."

"I like this Sticky monkey beer"

"Overall very nice, so much great characters, but hard to drink much of it since it's so sweet and boozy. def a winter sipper so glad I didn't wait until it was warmer out. Also wish the barrel came through a bit more, but I def like the vanilla and aging effect it has."
""
""
""
""
"like every barrel-aged Firestone Walker beer I have had this exhibits an excellent balance and similar barrel characteristics and mouth feel to most of their other barrel aged beers...exceptionally smooth for the ABV and I mean EXCEPTIONALLY.. not extremely quadish if that's a word but somewhere between that and a stout."
""
""
"Just too boozy and syrupy for me."

"Favorite beer by far. Can't wait for another bottle."
""
""
"All I can say is what a pleasure to drink.  This beer definitely met my expectations!"
"Boozy, sweet bottle of goodness"
""
""
""
"Velvety and slightly hot from the high ABV with flavors of vanilla up front and the burbon-toffee finish.  Sugar is present but less pronounced than fresh bottles/pours.  Aging well."

"2014 version. Pour is a thick brownish-black. It will be a little surprising for a Quad fan. Head forms only around the sides, but securely. Aroma is a deep bourbon-y vanilla--I inhaled several times before consuming. Feel is purely robust, with barrel sweetness dominating the taste. It's so rich, a slow drink is required, if you happen to consuming all 22 oz. alone. While both being different styles, I find the overall feel and taste to be a mix of BCBS and Backwoods Bastard. Overall, a unique pleasure to drink."

"Not a huge quad fan but enjoyed this.  Incredibly sweet.  I don't think I could handle more than 6oz."

"o; A wonderful sipper, a rival for BCBS.  Different of course because it's a Quad with some dark fruit undertones instead of roasty malt, but in both cases the bourbon flavor dominates beautifully."

""
""
""
"First ""barley wine"" versions were better"
""

"Overall, a damn fine brew."

"Tastes like drinking a vanilla toffee. super sweet, super smooth, the abv is completely unnoticeable."

"Five out of five."

"O - This is one of the best Quads I have ever had!!! Every barrel aged that Firestone does, they nail it!! I am looking forward to this next year"
"In a league of it's own. Absolutely perfect and unique with some many delicious flavors coming through."
"Firestone walker does it again.  It is on the sweet side."

"Leather and cherries nummy. Could definitely use some aging, The alcohol took a bit to get past."
""
""
""
"Overall - Quite enjoyable.  A slow, sipper of a beer, of course, but worth the alcohol and sugar investment."
""
""
""
""
"Solid....lots of barrel, figs and toffee. Think some time might help the barrel integrate better as it seemed a bit disjointed....but, as always, I'm likely full of shit"

"Just going to say if I'd never tasted Saucerful 'O Secrets, this would be my favorite Quad. This beer is supremely drinkable."
""

"O - Stickee Monkee indeed!  Well done - a very drinkable quad that would make a wonderful sipper on a cold night or as a desert beer.  I really like this one."

"My first review? I am reviewing based off of memory unfortunately, and basically what I remember is that this beer is the shit. My favorite of the barrel aged series, super sweet and delicious like I love. And that is my highly-qualified review of my favorite Firestone beer."
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with a thin khaki head that lasts for seconds before disappearing. Very little carbonation and the beer is completely opaque save for the edges. The nose is quite amazing. I got brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, a hint of roastiness, and dark fruits. The taste is vanilla bourbon with a prominent sweetness and subtle hints of fruitiness. The finish is full and smooth as could be. Next to no carbonation leaves a heavy mouthfeel and a thickness to the body. It's a definite sipper but more than worth the experience."

"O: more like a beer-aged barrel... this brewery hits the mark too much... they seem to have a distinct flavor to their barrel-aged beers, and it's intoxicating (not to mention, the beer)... if you like expertly-crafted, strong, malty beers, you may commit crimes-against-humanity for this one... most certainly an engaging sensory tussle... happy birthday to me!"

"Overall:  I am not going to touch the quad/English barleywine debate on this beer but will just look at it on its merits; for all the malt and barrel treatment here, the beer lacks the complexity, in my view, to merit the high scores that it has achieved; some of the scoring has to do with the brewer's reputation and, while this is a good sipper, it is not among Firestone Walker's best; it might be interesting to see how this ages once the heat diminishes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor follows with that burst of plums, dates, and raisins up front along with caramelized brown sugar. The beer is quite sweet, but that Firestone oak character dries out the beer. The beer tastes nothing towards 13+% and is dangerously drinkable."

""
"Firestone does barrel aging very well."
""
"O: It's amazing that a beer this rife with residual sweetness is even drinkable. True to its name, this is one big and sticky sipping beer. The well-rounded barrel character distracts the palate away from all the sweetness enough to keep it from going over the edge. They bill this as a 'Central Coast Quad', but if you are expecting anything resembling the Trappist classics such as Rochefort 10 or Chimay Grande Reserve, you will be completely confounded. It comes across more as a huge, sticky barleywine. In the past this beer was used only for blending purposes, and with its ridiculous sweetness it's not hard to see why. However, this is one of the rare instances in which a blending beer can stand on its own two feet, even if it is teetering on the edge of drinkability. Brinksmanship at its finest."

"Bomber poured into a snifter. The brew appears a clear mahogany color with an off-white cap that holds fairly well fading leaving patchy lace. The aroma contains notes of sweet caramel and toffee malt. A slight kiss of bourbon is present across the back. The taste is reminescent of raison and plum. Caramel and toffee round things out with a yeasty spiciness. This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. A fine sipper and good representation of a barrel aged quad. Id drink it again if the opportunity presented itself."

"Overall great; tastes like a BA barleywine, like a less hot Sucaba, and nothing like a Quad in my opinion. Does not taste 13.4% ABV at all, super smooth. Bourbon is sweet and delicious, as is all the caramel and toffee. Would love to get a bottle of it."

"Overall I like this quad just as much as FW's  sucaba and parabola. Cheers!"
""
""
""

""
"O:  Although this one blurs the lines a bit between a barrel aged Barleywine and a Quad, it is clearly a fantastic beer.  Look forward to finding another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: When I first had this beer at the 2010 Pizza Port  Strong Ale Festival it was classified as an English barleywine.  Call it Central Coast Quad or whatever else, to me it is a very good Bourbon bal-aged malt-centered beer.  Sweet but with enough complexity to not be cloying in the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D:  Another fine fireside sipper from the Proprietorâ€™s Vintage series with its full malt body, high ABV, and layers of barrel aged complexity. Signature FW barreling at work here with those lovely vanilla and toasted coconut components.  With such a mild Belgian yeast presence however this drinks more like an English Barleywine.  In fact I would prefer this over the Sucaba.  Damn just another wallet thumper to add in my lineup."

"Overall (4.25), another fantastic barrel-aged beer from Firestone Walker. It's not my favorite of the portfolio, but I like the fact that it brings a slightly different perspective, with quintessential characteristics of traditional Belgian quads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good attempt at a difficult style. But, sorry, this does not compare to the Belgian originals."
""
"O-great BA Quad, one of the best I have ever had"
"Definitely a tasty beer, but I wish the dark fruit flavors would carry through to the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Net sweet, but extraordinarily well put together.  Firestone Walker's Proprietor's Vintage Series is simply outstanding, and Stickee Monkee pulls it's weight in what I would argue is the best signature series in brewing."
""
""
"Very sweet, a little syrupy, and a little too hot for me."

"reviewing from memory, had on tap at Monk's cafÃ©.  served in a tulip.  aromas are boozey, mostly brandy.  some coacoa and dark fruits as well.  on the palate a brownie type chocolatiness, with the brandy or rum soaked quality.  raisin, coacoa, maybe a hint of coffee.  very sticky and thick like the name would suggest.  a hint of hop to balance things out, and a little heat.  really complex and warming beer"

Taste follows nose and more...almost tastes like a piece of candy..toffee indeed. Smooth and oaky..like a fine whiskey. Mouthfeel is glorious and rich. Overall a rich unforgettable brew."

"worth the hype, more of a barleywine than a quad though, although i suspect thats what they are getting at by calling it a central coast quad instead of a belgian one, but it exhibits a whole lot more barleywine to me. nevermind definitions and classifications though, this is insanely good beer. deep but royal red/brown in color, like good root beer in shade, but super thick and viscous, sticky as taffy, and not very carbonated, but it doesnt need to be. the nose on this is all grain, caramelized malt sugars abound, with notes of toffee and butterscotch, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, honey, and bourbon right from the bottle. its intensely boozy, but in a refined and intentional way. i get the malt layering expected in a quad, but the lack of any real belgian yeast character in the flavor puts this squarely in the barleywine world for me. scorching sugars and vanilla bourbon predominate, but it never really ends up all the sweet considering how much sugar is in here mid palate. oak mellows it for sure, and the booze cuts it well i think. layers and layers of grain nuance keep coming, i absolutely love it. i was so sad to have missed the bottles when they came around, so i am thankful to hops and pie for giving me the chance to finally try this one on tap. its worthy of its high praise, very firestone walker too, very barreled and big, just delicious big beer here. a musty try, more interesting than sucaba i think, but thats just me."

"Pours a heavy, dark brown. Smells of bread, liquorish, brown sugar, cigar. Taste is figgy, soy sauce, vanilla, sugar cane, and leather with a toasty background. Mouthful is heavy, think and boozy but smooth, with buttery velvet texture. Truly a world class creation."

"The combination of lots of time to kill and a recent paycheck means I can afford to pick up a bottle of Stickee Monkee at the bar. Let's do this shit. It pours a clear sunset topaz-sienna topped by a finger or so of sandstone foam. The nose comprises caramelized Belgian candi sugar, mild molasses, toasted oak, toasted coconut, light Connecticut tobacco, graham cracker, clove, light allspice, and a hint of candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, the oak, spices, and sweet elements taking full command in a lovely display of cooperation. A small faction of booze enters into the equation, but it is mostly drowned out by the delicious din around it. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly-syrupy feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, well worth my investment (and anyone else's, for that matter). Get some!"

"My local craft beer bartender got one of 75 cases shipped to NYC, he promised me one bottle and is keeping the rest for next year (Thank You!). Amazing and well worth the price tag! Looks and feels more like a BA Stout than a quad. The carbonation and presence of stone fruit flavors are the biggest ""quad"" qualities it has. The high ABV is masked quite well. This beer lives up to the hype and is another amazing example of fine BA from Firestone."
"Overall: this is truly unique and can't be categorized. A perfect dessert sipper. Best way I can relate to it is a cross between a quad and a stout. If you made monkey bread into a beer from heaven, this would be it."
"O:  wow.  Could be my favorite beer ever tried."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For two years, I thought nothing could ever surpass Parabola as the quintessential BBA beer, but this may have just changed my mind. FSW has once again created art, something so magnificent that you should have it sparingly lest you grow inured to its greatness."
""
""
"Drink- This was a good beer. Took me a while to find this one in So.Cal. Missed out on bottles so tap was a great solution for me. Was lucky to have during a tap takeover I found on accident."
""
""
""
"Easily one of the best beers Ive ever had. Well worth the wait and price"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: elegant drinking experience, on the sweet side - don't know what kind of barrels were used, but the alcoholic airs are rum-like (as mentioned). I think it was a $17 bottle for me, and its worth it."
""
"O - Unusually I actually preferred this beer at the start, and found it a bit one-dimensional by the bottom of the bottle. In terms of style, it's not an orthodox quad, but it's certainly closer to quad than english barleywine territory. I haven't had a beer quite like it, and from my perspective it's a bit of an enigma. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this beer is its drinkability; at 13.4% I was expecting a lot more heat."

"A previous reviewer used the term rum taste which fits perfectly. Low carbonation, high malt/sweet and a rum boozy aftertaste with warm lingering flavours is a simple summary. This is a great sipper as the taste is so rich and full. Another wonderful complex beer by Firestone!"

"Overall - Man, this is a hell of a brew. I'm not a big Quad fan because I find them cloyingly sweet and with too syrupy a body. Conversely I find many BA brews suffer from beer that may not be big and complex enough to withstand the Barrel Aging process, leaving an end product that's overwrought with too much booziness. To me this is one is a perfect marriage. Big flavors that aren't overwhelmed by the bourbon influence, while the normally thick and syrupy Quad body is thinned out nicely, delivering a smooth and approachable quality of drink. The end result is something like a BA blended barleywine, and it's wonderful. Glad I picked up a 2nd bottle for aging... should be fun to re-visit!"

"Call it a quad or call it a barleywine. Whatever you name it, it is rich, smooth, dark stone fruit, brown sugar, malty goodness. It goes down way too easily for a beer of this weight."

"This is another great BA offering from FW. It does not disappoint."
""
"O - Again, FW hits a home run! A little cheaper than some of the other releases but still sold out everywhere in like a day. Can't wait to see how this ages."
"Definitely a sipper. Hard to imagine drinking a lot of this, but a small glass after dinner for dessert would be perfect."
"Firestone Walker really has their barrel program cranking on all cylinders. Poured a dark brown, no light getting through with an off while head. Classic Firestone Walker barrel aged beer. Huge vanilla and toasted coconut notes, underlined with toffee, caramel and burnt sugar. Taste mirrors the smell, smooth as hell and decently viscous. A nice little bourbon heat that sticks with you at the end. If there is one complaint, it's that this doesn't really do much to differentiate from other Firestone Barrel Aged beers. If I was blind folded and told to guess between this and Sucaba, I'd have a hard time telling them apart. Like I said, not much of a complaint because they are both great."
""
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a fine half finger light brown head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma dominated by oak and bourbon, with light supporting dark fresh and dried fruit and caramel, really a barrel aged barleywine profile. Flavor is sweet syrup, vanilla, caramel, dark dried fruit, light stone fruit, oak and bourbon. Full, almost syrupy bodied with little carbonation presence on the tongue. A very interesting flavor in the finish, almost like a fine fruit reduction, flavorful but indescribable. This has quad sweetness, but the heavier fruit of a barleywine, but without the heavy malt flavors. A unique and tasty definition breaking strong ale. Quite sweet and little hop presence. A perfect desert ale. World class. Lucky enough to have an extra for the basement and look forward to this with a few years on it."

"Bottle from Doug. Thanks man! Pours dark amber brownish purple with a small yellowish head that recedes pretty quickly. Aroma of big time bourbon and vanilla, caramel, toffee, figs, other dark fruits. Smells like a BA Old Ale. Flavor is massive bourbon notes with a smooth vanilla finish. Dark fruits behind the booze, some big oaky notes, and lots of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and toffee. Not much Belgian Quad going on here but I suspect they weren't going for that anyway. Big rich mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Lots of booze but still very smooth with a lingering vanilla and dark fruits on the palate. Mmmm."

"Super glad this long-time draft only rarity finally found it's way into a bottle. Stickee Monkee does a great job almost bridging the gap between two of my favorite styles. I believe that it's less a full-on quad and more an English barleywine with quad elements but no matter what you call it, this is a sweet, multifaceted, delicious treat! I would love to accumulate multiples for enjoyment both now and it the coming months/ years. Another fantastic beast of a beer and real winner from Firestone Walker. Get it while/if you can!"

"Overall another rock-solid barrel-aged beer from Firestone Walker."

"O-Overall another great BA beer from Firestone. A very balance beer that is never in full force with bourbon. Was lucky enough to stubble on at TW since I missed out on draft the day before at Frisco."
"A rare miss from Firestone Walker; the elements are there, just not in a pleasing balance. An incidental note: I have had this one several times on its own over the years, but never reviewed it. However, it doesn't seem to be very different from how I remember it."

"FW knows barrels and how to brew a good beer to go in them. I said that after Parabola and Sucaba but this is just icing on the cake with a Belgian style. Sweet but not overly so with big fruits and smooth vanilla oak."
""
""
""
"Overall: best BA quads I have ever had. Sticks with what they were trying to achieve. The one complaint is with a higher abv, I wanted it to at some point hit me in the face a little, but the immense candy flavor masked that a lot, exactly what they wanted, but not what I wanted....oops. I have another one cellared, so I will re-rate in a couple years o_O"

"O-Not as complex as some of Firestone Walker's other specialty beers. It's still, a really neat take on a style that I am far from enamored with. Even if it isn't my favorite from this brewery, it's one of the best Quads I have had."
""
"Overall- Good beer, hides alcohol well. Has a very nice and clean flavor and scent. Definitely worth trying."

"O: 4.5 This beer is great. Almost on par with sucaba. It seems strange to be categorized as a quad, but a good beer is a good beer regardless of what the label says."

"O: Very, very good. A littttle sweet for me, without a ton of depth. This will be even better with some age on it, I'm sure."

"O: I like it, but my favorite is still Parabola. I think it would be alot better after a year or two but overall it's what I expected from FW. Top Class. It's not mind-blowing but in a year or two, this would be my top 20. I would definitely recommend anybody that is into BA stouts or BA barleywine. Cheers!"
"O: I actually prefer this over many of the Firestone barrel aged brews because it packs a bit more punch in terms of flavor, sort of like what Sucaba wishes it was"

"This is now more English BW than quad now. It's got that Belgian-yeast presence like a quad, but without the spices. The flavors are much more in unison than it was fresh. The heat's still there, but more warm and inviting than it is disagreeing, like it was fresh. Overall, very nice and may even prefer this one over Sucaba."
"O: Seriously big and sweet quad. Barrel-aging is quite nice, adding even more complexity and....sweetness with caramel and toasted sugars. Loads of bourbon, fruit, chocolate and sugary sweetness. What's not to love?"

"I bet this would age very well! I'm a fan of the 2014!"
""
"Verdict: A very tasty beer from Firestone Walker. They call it a quad on the bottle, in the past I've seen it as a barleywine and that's a bit of how I think of it, hard to find much in the way of the yeasty goodness that makes up a strong quad, but this has all the hallmarks of a great barleywine. The alcohol is hidden perfectly and is the beer's best asset. The richness and sweetness is cut nicely by the barrel aging and the complexity is right in the sweet spot where it's definitely layered but still straightforward enough to be accessible to everyone."
""
""
"O: Firestone continues to do something in the BA program where I feel it's good drinking now. Gets different as the beer warms but the flavor profile doesn't change too much. I will sit on a couple bottles. Definitely up there on par with Parabola. Got a few at $15.99 which is very reasonable and would probably spend up to $20 on the bottle if I get antsy with my other bottles and have to get desperate. Well done Firestone."

"O: I would compare this favorably to such favorites as BB4D and Brandy Old Stock. Remarkably well-integrated out of the gate, and with tons of depth of flavor/aroma. Will absolutely seek out more."

"22oz Dark brown color, looks like a barleywine. Aroma is sweet candy, sugar, vanilla, barrel, booze, my goodness it is nice. Flavor is more of the same, very delicious, boozy, sweet, great barrel characteristics. It really tastes more like a barleywine than a quad to me, it doesn't seem to have any Belgian characteristics at all. This is quite the fine beer and I stupidly passed on a bottle which means now that I'd like one I won't find one. Oh well, lucky to have had a taste at all. This compares really nicely to Parabola and Abacus, buy it if you see it."
"O: I had high expectations for this beer, heard great things about it, but it lived up to those reputations and surpassed them IMO, each category for this beer has something thatâ€™s different and stands out from other categories, but every characteristic of this beer pieces together so well and makes it complete, itâ€™s like a puzzle, sometimes all the pieces are there, but sometimes you canâ€™t find some pieces, but the harder you look you end up finding those missing pieces, this beer has taken my palate on a tour around the world instead of a measly roller coaster, MUST GET! Probably my new favorite offering from FW, well done guys!"

"I love FW's Double Jack, and when my local purveyor recommended this, I had to go for it. It's expensive, but if you want something special and unusual, I think this is worth the price. Really good, not for everyday use."

"I get grape, plums, oak, and zero bitterness. So many flavors in a bomber, compared to a taster on tap at the brewery"

"Another great brew from Firestone and one of my new favorite Barleywines. There is A LOT going on here. Huge smell, huge taste, and huge ABV! Lots of boozey belly warmth from this! Smell is thick with brown sugar, leather, cherry, chocolate, and oak. Taste is very sweet, but complex with vanilla, butter, dark espresso, chocolate, and of course bourbon. There is no booze in the flavor at all and you would never believe it was 16%."

"Overall a tasty treat. Much like a Barleywine and close in spirit to Sucaba. Enjoyed this just as much as I did at the Firestone Walker Invitational last year. Another great addition to the barrel aged portfolio at Firestone."

"O: I thought this was solid overall. There was a little too much heat from the booze for me even at 12%. The beer did get better as warmed up so I'd suggest waiting a touch before consuming given the opportunity."

""

"D - Very drinkable. Very sweet and bold with a nice bourbon mix with the sweet rich caramel and nutty malts."
""
"D - This is quite good - reminds me of draft Abacus a little, and definitely one of my favorite FW blend beers. Definitely explains why I like FW14 so much, although I'm puzzled as to why I didn't love FW15 - I must hate Helldorado."
"On tap at Toronado. Pours a dark reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big caramel, some brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, some plum, and a bit of brandy. A hint of of alcohol, but not much. The taste is sweet with caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, plum, and some bourbon. The finish is warming with a little alcohol apparent. Big, full bodied beer, but not syrupy. Low carbonation."
""
""
""
"On tap at City Beer Store. Clear hazel color with low carbonation. Big toffee and vanilla aroma, slight butterscotch, a lot of barrel. Heat is reigned-in. Palate exceeds the nose, showing a nice balance between barrel heat and rich toffee flavors. Full bodied, with light tannin and alcohol in the finish. Finishes very nicely, extremely smooth and palatable. Side by side with Abacus this was slightly better."

"Pours a clear copper color with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and banana. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, sticky toffee pudding, and bananas covered in caramel. Awesome flavors on this one. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with lots of complex aromas and flavors. I am very glad I was able to try this one."
"O: Excellent beer, perhaps a bit bolder in places than Abacus. I'd love to see this make an appearance in the Proprietor's Reserve Series, so others (and myself) could enjoy this heretofore draft-only delight in bottles. Yum!"
"O: I took a good 30 minutes or so smelling and sipping on this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this, more so than Abacus personally. I hope they bottle this one too at some point, as it has more of that bourbon vanilla I like, and less of the dark fruit notes."
"(Justin 4.0/Nick ?/Natalia ?)"
"Definitely could drink more than the 6oz pour they're offering here."
"D: This was a weird beer. In fact, several of the blending components for FW14 aren't all that great, but somehow they make a delicious final product."
