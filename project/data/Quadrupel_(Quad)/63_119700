3.96,-4.3,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Overall this is a solid beer due to the barrel aging. However, its on the expensive side and its only solid beer because of the barrel aging. The underlying quad is overly sweet, not interesting and is average at best. The rye bourbon barrles (15%) and wine (15%) improves the ale and mellows the 12% abv but neither of the barrels are very distinct making a below average beer slightly above average. This will mellow more with some age but the already minimal barrel characteristics will fade even more.","Harvest06","Feb 14, 2015"

The beer had a pleasant sweet wine flavor that had a slightly astringent almost spicy flavor on the finish. Slightly tart and bubbly at the same time. The overall mouth feel was  dry for the flavor at the start and after the flavor diminished the beer had this thick cloying covering. The beer felt like the wine had coated and dried on your tongue like a paste. The complexity in flavor, mouth feel, and aroma is amazing.

Nose of plums, brown sugar, raisin, light floral hops, and a brandy like alcohol.  Flavors are complex to say the least.  Plum and pomegranate to the front and sides (best representation of pomegranate I have tasted thus far).  Tons of brown sugar goodness with rye barrel coming through on the back blending to make a brandy like quality.  Intriguing.  Moderate carbonation, slick mouth feel, and a wet finish with alcohol warmth.  Fantastic.  Worth getting more in a bottle to lay down for a time.","Brutaltruth","Nov 13, 2014"

The aroma reminded me very much of your stereotypical barleywine, there was also, brown sugar, mollasses, pomegranate, cherry, cranberry, raisins and booze. Poured a deep ruby brown color with a tan head that receded quickly. Had a great full body while stil feeling kinda light in the mouth. On the palate there was molasses, dark fruits, raisins, brown sugar, wine, oak and booze. This is a beer I can see aging well and I can't wait to have it again in a year. As it stands now though I thought it was absolutely fantastic, I'm a big fan.","BrewChatKen","Oct 26, 2014"

4.38,5.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"Wow! What a great beer. I am somewhat limited in my experience of quads. But from what the style has to offer, this is one of the better ones that I've had. A complex beer, with extremely high drinkability. The beer has a sweet, but balanced entry. Sweet with residual sugars, raisin, prune. I picked up some nice grape notes as well, not sure I've had that in a quad before-welcomed, though. As the brew warmed, poured at about 50F, the brown sugar, cinammon, and molasses became more present. The sweetness is present from entry to finish, I didn't find it cloying or overbearing. I am a huge saison fan, so I don't particularly care for sweet beers. I did not find it to be too sweet. I really dig the estery, min clove, and spiciness from the belgian yeast. There is a nice sweet, bready and soft bitter finish to the brew. The beer is thin bodied. Alcohol is well masked with only a slight warming effect upon consumption. To me the beer drinks like a 7-8%, eventhough it's a 12 percenter. I thoroughly enjoyed the beer. Have one if you can.","mac31","Jul 19, 2014"

It's been a long time since I had the original Stoic, but if my memory is correct, I think I prefer this one a little better. Of course, my palate has likely changed a great deal since then anyway, so it's probably an irrelevant distinction. Ultimately, this is a well done beer, as long as you aren't expecting a "traditional" quad.","LambicPentameter","0"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, brown sugar, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is solid but quite boozy at this time.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"

A bit too 'dark fruit and sugary sweetness' for my liking, but that's what you get with a quad, and there wasn't too much to turn me off completely.

It definitely has persistent notes of red grapes from the wine barrels it was aged in to add to the richness. Although not as thick ar intense as a typical Trappist quad like Abt 12, I actually prefer this version of the style. The complex fruit and sweetness tantalize the palate instead of overpowering it. If it wasn't such a high ABV, I could easily drink a few of these.","wattoclone","May 29, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, dried and fresh dark stone fruit, rye whiskey, cherry juice. Flavor is mild caramel malt, sweet fresh dark stone fruit, pomegranate, whiskey, estery. Finishes with dry wood, mildly tart, rye whiskey and light hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Not a typical quadrupel profile, with more sweet/sour fruit flavors and less maltiness. Well made with nice mixed fruit flavors and barrel influence, more along the line of a Belgian and American strong ale hybrid. Enjoyable, but not to style.","LiquidAmber","May 01, 2014"
