The sweetness lends to the tame qualities giving this unique mouthfeel without being overpowering or ""hot"" there is something silky about this beer and I dig it. There is a high drinkability here despite the style and I think that might be a bit dangerous. I love this and will be cellaring a few more of these to see just how much like Hershey's syrup this can get like.

The aroma is of dark cherry, biter cacao, brown sugar, milk chocolate, plum, date, raisin, and other ubiquitous ‘dark fruits.’ A bit of caramel and chocolate mousse as well. The flavor is fruit-forward in the beginning, highlighting some of the traditional ‘quad’ aspects (date, raisin, a mild yeast character); chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and cacao become more noticeable towards the finish. Sweet cherry and candied prune also come through. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, with the carbonation seemingly keeping the sugars at bay. Finish is relatively clean. Overall, this is a good beer that I’d be happy to have again. It wasn’t overdone in any aspect (not to much or too little chocolate), and I think it turned out nicely.","eclipse54","Jan 22, 2013"

Definitely a huge chocolate presence. Not sure I would identify this as a quad, but hey, it's good stuff. Heavy chocolate presence throughout. Overall, this is ok, but not something I would regularly crave. Now that I have had it, overcoming the anticipation of never having had it, I would choose any of the standard Belgian examples of the style over this.

The flavors don't change or develop as you consume and in the end this is more of a gimmick than a beer to be honest. It tastes delicious don't get me wrong, but it will never be confused with a world class Quad. All of the Belgian yeast flavors are completely masked by the cocoa/sweet dark caramel maltiness, so I have to deduct points there. Makes for the perfect after dinner drink but I didn't need to consume a whole 22oz by myself, 8-12 would have sufficed. Definitely glad I tried it and recommended for it's quality and unique flavor but don't break your back to track it down.","claspada","Apr 15, 2012"

On my first sip, it tasted a bit artificial, reminding me of the chocolate flavor in O’Fallon’s Cherry Chocolate beer, but after a couple of sips, I started to enjoy the rich and complex chocolate and cocoa flavors. Surprisingly, the beer really lived up to its name, with a complex mix of chocolate flavors that reminded me of a box of chocolates. While this isn’t an every day beer, it is a great dessert beer, that I’d recommend after a nice meal.","kkoz","Jul 26, 2011"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and a floral note. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream, and subtle roasted malt. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The chocolate notes on this one dominated and took NO prisoners! I would not have guessed that it was a Quad based on the flavor and aroma notes going on here at all. It was really well put together and easy to drink. Would have loved to sit down to a whole bottle, but I will take what I can get for sure.","thagr81us","Jul 12, 2011"

That rich cocoa flavor is all you taste, and all you need to taste. It's really really good. This beer goes down easy and I could sip on it all day if that were possible.

Anyway, this stuff pours a dark, murky black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, light Belgian yeast, vanilla, whipped cream, oats, and light walnut. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, very light mint, vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon, very light roasted malts, and clove. This stuff really lives up to its name tastewise, though the chocolate is extremely dominant, keeping most of the quad characteristics at bay. Damn tasty, though. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth-ish feel. Overall, a very nice brew. The only negative I can really come up with is the seeming lack of most of the quad character. Having that mix with the chocolatiness would create a ridiculous beer, I think. Still, this is some tasty stuff, lemme tell ya!","TMoney2591","Jun 19, 2011"

The chocolate smells and tastes are a bit fake smelling for the most part even though the bottle says ""brewed with natural chocolate flavor"". Not too impressed with that aspect of the beer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with a decent level of carbonation. Overall, this is fairly good but not as great as I was expecting it to be based on the hype.

Looks lifeless after a minute or two. Big wafts of chocolate, mostly of the Tootsie Roll variety, with just a small touch of quad characteristics in the background, notably dark fruits and maybe some cherry. Smells great, as this thing is basically all chocolate. Taste is pretty damn similar to the nose. All chocolate. I'm losing the Belgian characteristics here as there's not much of the yeast coming into play. Again, the Tootsie Roll qualities come out once again, with just underlyng of dark fruit/raisin, and a touch of caramel. Alcohol isn't noticeable at first put comes out and is slighly hot when the beer warms. Creates some nice, chocolaty belches! Good, medium-full body, light(er) carbonation. A very nice chocolate beer. It really dominates everything, so if yours is the sweet tooth and the cocoa bean is your dark master (a la George Costanza), you'll love this as much as your Bosco.","KeefD","May 16, 2011"

Apart from that, I smell chocolate, chocolate and some chocolate. The palate opens thin and chocolatey, while paradoxically tasting rather syrupy at the same time. Not very complex, there's chocolate and tootsie roll here. Sweet, this beer is light in body and has a noticeable caramel character. Not much yeast expression on the palate either. Not very complex, but moderately delicious, in small quantities.","DefenCorps","May 16, 2011"

It's just as described: a very nice quad with layers of chocolate over the top. The chocolate character is really dominant, and the quad underneath is spot on as well. Nice mix of dark fruits, raisins, and semi-sweet malt. A bit of brown sugar as well. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth and doesn't reveal the 10.5% at all.
