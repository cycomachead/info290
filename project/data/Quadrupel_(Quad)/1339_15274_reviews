"A little harsh and boozy."
"Hazy red/brown, rich head. Dark fruits, rum, candies. Very sweet and boozy, like Gulden Draak or La Trappe Quad. Nice dessert beer, but not on the same level with Rochefort, Westvleteren, Chimay or St. Bernardus strong dark ales."
""
""
"Somewhat smooth but the alcohol is poorly masked. That being said it is a 11.5%"
""
""
"O- A dangerously drinkable quad.  Can easily hang with the best of the Trappist versions of the style.  Very pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A flavourful and enjoyable sipper that falls short of classics like Rochefort 10, Westvleteren 12, and St. Bernardus Abt 12. Still a good quaff, though."

"Overall: This is a strong brew for sure. Not one to have daily. Have one on Fridays or share a 750 ml. bottle with someone that is close to you. The alcohol is noticeable, yet it is not offensive in any fashion. This brew is very worthy."
""
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - A very drinkable ale, well balanced. Not heavy or boozy, despite very high ABV."

"O: one that doesn't bombard the senses with flavor.... gotta let it sit for awhile for it to open up.... even then, dry and quite mellow... nice, if you're digging the subtleties and simply want to quell the swelling in your brain"

"O: Extremely equilibrated, poised like no other. Belgians sure know how to make a beer tasty beer full of a disparate amount of sensations without having to compromise one taste over the other (take note, Yankees)."

"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this quad. The nose didn't live up to the taste but that'd be my biggest complaint. Great complex flavor, awesome mouthfeel. A case of this could probably last forever but a 4 pack would be a great pickup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. The main thing this beer had going for it was a distinctly ""nutty"" aftertaste, which I found interesting. Other than that it kinda tastes like ""normal beer"" which isn't bad at all, but I was expecting a much more complicated flavor from a ""quadrupel."""
""
""
"O: this is a winner for sure. Nice take on the style that is different than the Trappists."
"Taste: definitely a sipper. Strong alcohol is notable but not overwheliming. Some obviously hints of chocolate and caramel. Well balanced."
""

"Drinkability : a nice beer in the Belgian style Quadrupel."
""
""
"Overall, a great brew but not quite as refined as the elite of the style. The aroma needs some sophistication, the taste could use a bit more complexity and the carbonation is plainly just off."
"overall, slightly to bitter for my taste with a huge alcohol warmth finish. I have another bottle of this that I am saving, hopefully time will help balance it out."
"O - Really good example of the style and very well balanced with hoidden alcohol. Reminds me of the Pannepeut but a little more refined."
"This was a pretty flavorful beer, the alcohol presence is overpowering at times but it is still tasty."
""
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, coded bottle date. This pours a cloudy yeast filled tea brown color with a small thin tan head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. The smells are very fruity and malty, you get a load of ripe dark fruit, some cherries, a little Belgian funk and brown sugar. The feel is medium with a creamy high carbonination. The taste is good enough, the alcohol is very present and you get some heat, besides that there are dark fruit, candied sugar, malts."
"Poured at a good temperature with a nice, cream-colored head that slowly settled. Color is a clear red amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, fruit, a bit of brandy. Flavor's like nose, mainly sweet with some back tang and bitter; also hint of fish. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, boozy, and of average length."
""
"I employed a very gentle pour as lees were visible in the bottom of the bottle. This resulted in a dearth of head, but a very clean, deep-amber liquid with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a dried, dark-fruitiness to it, like prunes, raisins and figs, very apropos for this time of the year. There was also a yeast-driven mustiness and a definite alcohol burn noticeable on the nose. Mouthfeel was medium and my first thought was ""Brown Sugar!"" thanks to it s massive malt presence on the tongue. Phew! Next, I got some real heat from the alcohol and once that passed, the fruity esters really asserted themselves. Warming, the fruitiness became even more prevalent and so did the heat. The finish was extremely dry, thanks to the yeast really having done its job. I would bet that there was not much in the way of fermentable sugars when all was said and done. My my my. Many thanks for the hook-up!"
"Overall very tasty! Very much a sipper and quite good. Not the best Quad but I would never refuse a glass of this."

"Well-aged bottle - 2 years old, a local store had them on clearance for $1.99 each so I grabbed a few. Cloudy dark amber with two fingers of creamy khaki head. Nice and rich while maintaining a quenching dryness. Toffee, gingerbread, plums, figs, and slightly charred sugar. Mild hop bitterness puts the balance toward the malt side. Alcohol is noticeable, but lends just a subtle warming quality that is quite pleasant on a fall evening."

"Overall a solid, drinkable quad."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a nice dark orange-red amber. Minimal head and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, Belgian spicing. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Dark and sweet fruits, malt. Somewhat dry at the very first, blending into malts and fruits. Sweet and dry finish. Very complex and tasty. Alcohol a bit forward, detracting from the overall experience. Still a very nice and tasty quad."
""
""
"Overall: It's really a little bit too sweet for me, but certainly different and interesting."
"Pours a ruddy amber color into my Belgian glass, with a 1"" off white, foamy head. Some haziness. Great lacing as the beer went down. The nose of this one is very citrusy, with tangerine, lemon, and sweet grapefruit notes to it. When drank, a huge malt flavor dominates, with sweet candy, apple, dark fruits (raisin and fig), molasses, and cherries. Very yeasty as well with only a slight spiciness. The ABV is warming, yet perceived as not too boozy. It's full bodied and it coats the palate very well. Overall, I would say this is very tasty and enjoyable, but not on the same tier as say the St. Bernadeus Abt 12 or Rochefort. Could use some more balanced complexity as this is primarily just very sweet and fruitier than the other quads I have had."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, fruit, spices, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, dark chocolate, bread, wood, and vanilla. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation which gave it an almost creamy texture. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. To be honest, there were quite a few notes that I was not expecting in this one. The vanilla note was definitely the biggest surprise to me. Granted it did add a nice touch to the other flavors there, but it just felt a little lackluster overall to me. While good, it just felt a little off to be labeled as a good brew. Worth trying if you get the chance, but that is about it."
"11.2 ounce bottle into chalice; bottle code K08E8. Pours super clody reddish brown color with a small 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass; with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big molasses, caramel, dark candi sugar, pepper, fig, raisin, toffee, and light yeast spices. Big malty aromas here with a good amount of complexity. Taste of big caramel, toffee, molasses, raisin, prune, dark candi sugar, pepper, roasted nut, biscuit, and light yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and roasted nut on the finish for a while. Great flavor balance with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Very smooth to drink but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is an outstanding quad. Big flavor, complexity, and balance. Very smooth and highly enjoyable to sip on."
"This is definitely an after-dinner type sipper, or a dessert beer, but it is still balanced and drinkable despite it's high abv and complexity. I would reccommed this to anyone who likes big beers or belgian strong darks. Might be my favorite Urthel beer so far."
"I'm sorry, but this just isn't my style. I'm not sure what else to say. I hate to give a rating that's so below the average, but if I don't like it, what the heck else am I supposed to do?"
"O: Good for a quad, but i'm not in love."
"O: Delicious beer with a distinctive flavor."
""
"O - This is on my upper quad tier with Bernardus 12, Westy 12 and Pannepot. I'd love to throw this into a blind tasting with those and let them fight to the death."
""
"overall, this beer is so good, if you're a fan of big Belgian beers, little sweeter than a Rochefort #8, but more hoppy than a sweet barley wine. A beer well worth checking out and well worth it's price ($9). Really enjoying it."
""

"This is a first-time-having-it. And, pretty happy about it. Long time coming. Recommended."

"Poured a 3"" beige head with good retention. Deep clear burnt orange colored body. Smells of malt and dried fruit. Taste is classic big quad with toffee, caramel, malt, dried fruit, and fig. There's higher alcohol but not to the point of distraction. And a fairly long fruity finish. This holds up against many other quads."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The smell is better than the taste experience. Lacks malt backbone and is overburdened with the high alcohol. I'll give it a try after it sits in the cellar for a couple years."
"Smell of banana. Taste is good, no questions about that, a bit sweet but that is what most quads have. Drinkability is very good thanks to it's super mouthfeel."
"M: Creamy, velvety smoth. Low attenuation, carbonation low but spicy. Perfect but slooow sipping. No session beer."

"Seems a little bit oxidized, notes of prickly booze, baked apples, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon sticks and clove that numb the tongue. Sweet and sticky on the lips, overripe fruit and spiced apples soaked in brandy. A bit dry and fusely in the aftertaste, can't really get down with this. The booze is more than apparent, though somewhat appropriate for a Quad. Going to sip for a bit to see if it changes at all. Served around 50º, it's not making a good impression. Harsh alcohol, overly sweet, unbalanced. Not planning to revisit this."
"This poured out as a nice looking brown color with a good looking head on top. The retention wasn't too bad, but there wasn't much lacing. The smell of the beer is a little sweet and had some nice light caramel aromas and dark fruits. The taste is a little tart upfront but settles into a nice sweet and rich vanilla like aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer is nice as well, it had a solid carbonation to it and a soft mellow feel to it. Overall this was a pretty nice Quad, doesn't beat La Trappe but still very nice."
"Overall: Not rally digging this one. Alcohol too strong. Too sweet. Needs work."
"O: Not bad, well put together. A bit more sweetness would do the beer good."
"Quite a different quadruple. Maintains the complexity that you would expect, but differs from the trappist examples. The bitterness helps with this. It is not a bitterness that you associate with hops but one that goes perfect with the dry fruity flavors of the beer. Very enjoyable indeed."
"330ml bottle served in a Tripel Karmeliet Tulip glass.Enjoyed on apr´11.Pours reddish light brown in color.Foggy.Crown is a close,dense,big bubble,2cm thick layer foam.Yellowish in color.Yeast,raisin & acid fruit on nose.Spicy,sweet burning mouthfeel while dark fruits play on palate.Full body.Good carbonation not bothering at all.Prune & apricot on the aftertaste soften the ABV.Well balanced & complex flavors & aromas.Pleasant drinkability.Look out!.alcohol level is gentle but actually present."
"Overall, while the flavors in here are superb, the ale is hindered by the poorly-disguised alcohols, which tend to overpower everything else--especially as one gets deeper into the bottle. The tastebuds simply can't handle the strain, and collapse into Urthel's vodka-sting event horizon. Approach with caution, and drink very slowly."
"O: Not bad, well put together. Very good representation of the style, I only ever saw it once and held onto it for around 6 months. Might pick another up if I see it again."
"Overall: Nice beer, will age some for later"
"Urthel Samaranth has all the rich sweetness and sensual qualities that have made the Quad legendary in the beer world. It is, for my money, every bit as good as the household names and definitely deserves more limelight than it's currently given. This is one import worth the extra few dollars - you'd be hard-pressed to find such quality from non-Belgian brewers."
"A tad hot. A decent brew, but nothing to get too excited about. I think I'll stick to hop-it."
"I like it. Not a session beer, but not meant to be. Very nice."
"O- This beer has some nice flavors but not a great deal of depth and a pleasant alcohol that works with the soft sweetness."
"Overall a very good beer, a little on the strong side for me and better for winter, but something I'd wholeheartedly recommend."
"Pours a fairly-clear reddish-copper color with a good off-white head and loads of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some mild caramel and a nice date character. Raisins there as well. Nothing too spectacular; fairly weak. The flavor really improves upon that. There's a mild amount of booze that works well with the raisin and date character. Really quite nice. Medium body and really smooth. Booze is nice. Really nice all around. Thanks to Amyliz4 for being gifted these glasses and picking this bottle out."
"Poured into its branded glass. A rich amber/copper in hue, some small yeast particles are suspended. Soapy white head forms and recedes to a fine layer. Sweet whole grain bread in the smell along with some brown sugar. Complex beer, roasted malt, caramel, fig, raisin. Very little alcohol presence for an 11% beer. Mouthfeel is rich and full bodied. A good quad, true to style, and is a detriment to sobriety."
"Dr: Covers up its high ABV very well. You could easily down it because of how good it is; I did! Give this one a go, lads. You won't be disappointed. I'd love to try this on-tap."
"Overall, a decent quad with a lot of solid flavors. I dig it. I really enjoyed all of the fruit flavors here."
"I understand that the Koenigshoeven quad was the original inspiration for this, and they are quite similar. This one impresses me as a bit spicier and not quite as sweet, but variety is a good thing and I wouldn't fault either for not being the other. This one also seems far more complex in the flavor profile, and I'd give it five and a half on taste if I could. Luscious stuff, makes this quad-lover plenty happy indeed."
"Not the king of quads but a good quad. Since I also have great acces to Rochefort, St Bernardus and even Westvleteren I don't see myself picking up this one more often."
"Very dangerously drinkable. Good mouthfeel and nice tingle. Certainly will buy this beer again, and will add one to my collection to be aged. Great job!"
"Pours a dark brown w/ a one finger chocolate head- nice looking beer. Smell is of fig, licorice, spice, and alcohol. Not crazy about the licorice smell. Taste is that of licorice, spices, mint(?), alcohol. Maybe some clove thrown in? Mouthfeel is clean, w/ fig/alcohol aftertaste. Not the normal quad- this is definitely different than anything in this style that I've had. Pretty good, but not great. Some of my buddies really liked this one (more than me). Glad I got to try this beer."
"D) An outstanding quad with unique hoppiness"
"This beer is full bodied with a lovely creamy mouthfeel. A worthy component in the land of Quadrupel's."
"M/D: Really easy to drink despite the high abv and almost cloying sweetness. A good beer to try at least once."
"D: Quite drinkable for the ABV (which is only occasionally noticeable). A good Quad, but not the best. I would drink it again, certainly, but I hesitate to recommend it above more worthy competitors."
"D: I am trying to explore more imported beers, so i picked this one up honstly I will never pay money for it again."
"D - Very drinkable for an 11% beer...almost scary. The sweetness is there, but it really doesn't build up to a point of unpleasantness."
"D: Fairly good Quad, first that i have had that was fairly bitter. Overall pretty average drinking quad. Not the best on the market but still pretty good."
"I really like this selection, and like Chimay, another one of my favorites, I often overlook it because I'm always on that quest for the perfect ale, but I should opt for it more often. Definitely my favorite Urthel."
"Drink is decent, some booze but better than 11%, dry finish, bit of bitterness, nice."
"This is the oddest Quad I've had to date. It reminds me more of a heavier Triple. There's alot going on in this beer. Very complex yet incredibly drinkable. I loved it. It's almost if there was ingredients in this beer that I've never tasted before."
"Bad news: not overly complex, color and profile are far too light for style, and flavor hits some strange notes. Not the best, but definitely off the beaten path."
"D: Damn good beer. This beer is very sweet, however, the finish is clean and it doesn't seem like a sugary mess. As it warms the booze becomes more prevalent but it is quite welcome. Very complex and delicious."
"D: This could become slightly cloying, but it was a good solid quad."
"Because of the amount of sediment, I have to subtract points for appearance and mouthfeel, but overall, this beer was good and is worth trying out."
"Notes: Strange beer and not really what I was expecting from a Quad. Seemed a bit more like a malty Tripel. Overall I wasn't a big fan, but it wasn't a bad beer. Probably won't get it again, as there are a number of Quads (and Tripels for that matter) I like better for the same price."
"Very good beer."
"D: Excellent Belgian QUAD! No regret..."
"D: This is a tough style to nail. This is drinkable but it certainly isn't up to trappist quality."
"It is very similar to Belgian Trappist quads, but this one is not very full bodied."
"I'm a bigger fan of the urthel tripel but this is definitely a great beer. Huge rum flavors/nose, clear, dark amber color, medium, sticky mouthfeel, light on the head with a good deal of lacing, and very sweet. Raisin flavors really come through as it warms, and alcohol is always present. I'd normally like a bit more complexity in my quads, but this is definitely enjoyable."
"This is one heavy beer. Taste is very dark fruit with shades of prunes, raisins, dark cherries. Throw in a dose of malt. Not much bitterness. The finish is quite creamy and smooth. i drank this cool but not cold. The alcohol was not hard to put up with and the taste improves as the bottle is open."
"D: This is a very strong ale so it's definitely a sipper. It's not bad but I am disappointed with the level of bitterness I encountered in this one."
"This is the sixth Quadrupel I've reviewed on BA, and I think it slots in midway on character and overall scores (without checking)."
"Overall, a solid quad but far from spectacular."
"Pours a clear amber colour with thin white head. Head dissipates fairly quickly with very little lacing. Smells very sweet of cherries and Belgian yeast. Taste is quite sweet as well with small amount of bitterness. Some caramel too. May be one of the sweeter quads I've had without the darker malts. Very smooth, possibly because it is a bit under-carbonated."
"jd"
"medium-modied, low carbonation. drinkability is average to slightly above - will finish the bottle but that will be enough."
"d- I'm glad this bottle was a leftover for volunteers at a recent brewfest. this definitely isn't worth the premium import price. I'll take any Allagash among many others all day over this one. the alcohol presence hurts this one's quaffing rate significantly, too."
"Notes: Overall this is an outstanding Quad in my opinion. Its complex, it's big, it's pleasantly boozy, it drinks well, and the only thing I can really pick on here is the head retention and lacing. Well done!!!"
"Very different than all other Belgian quads. A very good one to have in the cellar."
"This Quad offers a beige-yellow pour, light head, leaving light lacing. A nose of ale, taste of bitter hops, yeasty aftertaste, like a slice of bread soaked in beer. I am not particularly liking this offering, due to the combo of bitter hops and yeasty aftertaste. I wonder if I have a skunky bottle??? I usually enjoy Quads, but not this one."
"drinkability: Amazing for a beer this big."
"Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and boozy. This is quite drinkable for a Belgian Quad, though I would drink this at cellar temp. Straight out of a cold kegerator doesn't do this beer justice."
"A very flavorful nightcap."
"Poured a darkish brown with decent carbonation that died quickly and left no lace. A good mix of belgian yeast along with a semi-sweet sugary malt smell along with hints of citric fruit pass for the aroma. Medium bodied with an immense sweet malt body of sugar and caramel and some bitter chocolate. Has a dry, bitterish toffee feel/hoppy taste as well and is slightly chewey as it passes over the tongue. The yeast strain along with the ABV lead to a dry finish that makes this beer a great sipper to enjoy."
"D - Great full complex flavors throughout this beer. Good body and great aroma add to the enjoyment. The alcohol level is very present but not overpowering. Not to say this is a sessionable beer, but I dont think two glasses in one night would kill you."
"Extremely drinkable - could easily drink this all night long."
"It could very well be the other brews from De Leyerth, that are lighter in alcohol, are more to my liking."
"D-this has got some solid flavors going on but it is pretty hot. It could use some time to mellow."
"The Urthel feels thick and silky in the mouth. Very smooth. Dangerously drinkable!"
"I love the story behind this beer, added to its being delicious, and what we have here is a perfect party beverage. However, one could equally consider it a companion for contemplation. I even like the little bald guys."
"Overall - An excellent Quad and one of the best i've had... recommended..."
"The beer pours a dark reddish color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a sweet malty scent along with a warm fruity yeast aroma. There is a nice dark fruit character. The taste is good. It's incredibly smooth with lots of yeast character. The malt profile boasts primarily of pale and light crystal malts. There is definitely a dry feel and a nice bit of warmth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn tasty beer. It's simple in nature, but well done."
"Drinkability is pretty good . Smooth..not too sweet, good flavor and warming alcohol. A nice winter nightcap."
"In the final analysis, this is a very nice, flavorful, balanced, and pretty complex beer. It is undoubtedly potent as well, yet easy to sip and enjoy. The Urthel troll dudes have come up with a winner here."
"This poured a cloudy light mahogany with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like rich dark chocolate and creamy yeast and banana nut bread, with some earthy caramel. It tasted like banana nut bread with some creamy yeast and powdery milk chocolate and earthy nutty malt. It was fairly thick with smooth carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very refined beer with a very delicate taste and body, but nothing super rich or powerful. The alcohol was apparent, so this beer is definitely better to sip. Definitely an enjoyable beer fresh, but it will likely mellow out and the malt might further sweeten with a few years of age. This didn't have the obvious or powerful characteristics that some quads do, but the subtleties had me thinking about it the next day and wanting more."
"This is a nice quad, yet a step below the best. Certainly worth a try for anyone who likes this style, yet it still has room for improvement."
"A quadruple just a little above the average. Maybe it gets better after some cellaring?"
"Smooth, tasty and easy-to-drink. Not my favorite quad, but a damn good one anyway."
"Ruby red and maroon color, relatively clear with lots of suspended particles. Lots of effervescence, but rapidly disappearing white head. Aroma of leather and orange peel. Taste is very large caramel with lots of malty sweetness, but well balanced with hops. Long, syrupy caramel finish. Very nice indeed."
"Drinkability: Well, this is a weird quad. I really like it, but its not St Bernardus or Rochefort. This 750 was $11, so it aint cheap either. Would I have another? On another day, sure, if price was no issue. Would I choose this over a superior, similarly priced one? No."
"MF&D - its all good: enough cabonation, but not particularly drinkable from the booze."
"D: To drink a quad is to drink something very complex. If you're into the adjunct lagers you probably shouldn't bother but for rest of us - try this one and the try an adjunct lager (it's just like water). Anyway this beer style is one of my favourites, and I havn't had a bad one yet..."
"Ruby colour, small white head. Aroma is not good at all, smells like chemical solvents and that ruins it. Apart from that i find Burnt sugar and dark fruit in the aroma, maybe with a hint of honey. Flavour is better than the aroma lets on, but it is overwhelmingly sweet to an extent that it takes over all the other flavours, with that said I do find some nice notes of dark fruit, honey and port that makes this beer interesting enough to get a rather good mark for flavour. Palate is ordinary for the style."
"Full bodied with a smooth and warming mouthfeel. A good sipper for a while, but the more this sits out, the more noticeable the 12% abv becomes. The alcohol isn't masked quite as well as some other versions of this style, it's not quite as complex as some of the Trappist quads, but overall this one shows a lot of promise. I think I might hang on to a few bottles to see how much it can improve with age."
"D: I know it's a quad, but it goes in the direction of a barley wine imo. It's a little too sweet for me but I will put some bottles in my cellar. This should become much better after aging."
"M&D: the consistently lightly effervescent palate helps greatly to lift the overall heavy body a bit, and also renders a soothing, even semi-refreshing mouthfeel. My criticism of this ale is the heavy presence of the sugary elements on the balance, which come at the expense of a clearer manifestation of fruit esters and spiciness. Having said that, undeniably this ale is very well crafted indeed, not least demonstrated by how attenuated the alc. feels on the palate and down the throat..."
"D - great, this beer is a beast and an excellent sipper and cap to the night. it tastes and feels like i am already in dream land."
"drinkability- of this beer drinkability is huge, will be interesting to see in coming years how this great beer hold up"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a trio of snifters. Shared with psycohops and brothercannon. The quad appears a deep crimson-chestnut color with a good two inches of tight tan foam. Nose and flavor consist of sweet candi sugar, dark fruits such as cherries, dates, raisins, plums, prunes, some spicy yeast, fruity, caramelized malts, bread. Just shy of full bodied and amply carbonated. Alcohol is quite noticeable, detracting a bit from the drinkability. Overall though, a pretty decent quad."
"With age, I expect this beer would improve, and aside from the blatantly obvious alcohol it does perform well. Don't drink it young."
"Is it a quadrupel or is it a barleywine? Who cares. It is big, bold and wondrful. It is one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Definitely world class! If you like big, bold, dark beers, don't miss this one."
"Jordan."
"Color was a mahogany with small and thin off white/beige head. Aroma was like grain alcohol soaked raisins. No real notes of yeast or any spiciness whatsoever. It drinks like a brandy. Warming."
"D - Drink it while it is cold. It's a good beer cold, but as it warms, you can really note phenolic flavors and slight astringency."
"Sipping beer, would drink again in moderate amounts, but can't drink a lot of it."
"D - This was a nice quad and is for sure a sipping beer...sweet but boozy...it really gives off that warming effect"
"Light- to medium-bodied, moderate carbonation compliments it well. No way this can be a session beer with the high ABV, but it'd be nice to compliment an evening conversation by having this one to sip."
"Big flavor, nice and boozy without falling prey to extreme heat or harshness. Sip this baby slow, and it will undress on your tongue to reveal sweet amber malts coated in molasses, sticky caramelized raisin rum, and a finish of breathy ethanol and spiced hop leaves. Creamy, chewy body, but not so viscous that it impedes on its drinkability. Alcohol begins to wear on the palate slightly after half a glass, but I can see this sexy beast of a beer being a perfect candidate for a few years in the cellar. Highly recommended Quad."
"Copper color beer poured a thin off white head and dissapated quickly. Nose is quite nice, light and dark fruits, belgian yeast, and alcohol. Taste is apples, pears, figs, finishing with a nice dry hop. Mouthfeel is lighter than hoped but has a pretty good belgian yeast smooth feel as it goes across the palate. Drinkability is good, the beer was hot with the first sip but subsequent sips present a nice winter sipping beer."
"D- this one is a slow sipper that would be perfect in the colder months. very enjoyable, but i should have found someone to split this one with. about halfway through i was ready to try something else, but too buzzed to attempt it. this one makes me want to try the other urthel beers that are sitting in stores here."
"Drinkability: Not up there with the other Urthel beers I have tried; just too cloying"
"OVERALL: Another solid effort from Urthel. Definitely a drinkable quad, and the 12% ABV doesn't get in the way of enjoying this one. Urthel consistently makes good beer, and this is one that is certainly worth re-visiting in the future. Recommended."
"M - Viscous, medium bodied, mild carbonation."
"750 ml cage and corked bottle. Poured with a nice foamy head. Brown to amber translucent color. Dark fruit aroma. Raisins. Plums. Figs, figs for real! Figs in the flavor. Oh no, I am stuck on figs. A little bit boozy in a great way. Some sweetness, and some bitterness. Some dryness. Thin to medium body, quite perfect. A deadly drinkable quad at 11%. You might wanna share this 750 with a buddy, or your wife."
"It poured a copper amber color with a cream colored bubbly head. Definite lacing on the glass. The smell was very malty, what you would expect from a quad. it is a full bodied beer and over takes your mouth. The carmel and banana are typical and overpowering. It is a good belgium beer and a true example of a quadruple - high abv and high sweetness."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very full and creamy. The carbonation is very lively in this one. Extremely drinkable."
"There is a reason this beer is one of the top rated Quads. It is unbelievable. The head is foamy and a full opaque color that takes minutes, not seconds, to dissipate. The taste is crisp, full, and sweet. Truly, this is what I expect to pay a little more for when I purchase a beer from Belgium. Fantastic beer. You should at least try it once."
"Pours a dirty brown in color. There is a huge 4 inch off white head forming on the pour and taking several minutes to die down so I could top off the glass. Smell is candy. Lots of belgian candy sugar abounds in this beer. Small amount of yeast in the flavor as well. This is incredibly smooth and creamy. You only get a hint of the ABV in the flavor, but boy do you feel it about half way through the bottle. Very good beer."
"Pours a strong brown body, hard to see through. Average head, tan-whitish, diminishing. Heavy aroma of grape juice, that's all I get, and not very strong. Alcoholy grapey taste, heavy, but not too bad an aftertaste. Very strong mouthfeel, a little fizzy but not soft. As it warms up, more fruit flavor, but also much alcohol flavor. A little smoother."
"Overall - I would drink this again, but this is so different than other quads that I have had it does not seem to fit in the category. If you like Troegs Mad Elf, give it a try."
"D- A little unique for the style. It most definitely lacks a certain magic that some other quads have, but it is still tasty."
"I have had the honor of drinking two of the Urthel beers and can't wait to find the others. I am a huge fan of the bald-dude."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Sits pretty in the Palm tear drop glass; beautiful ruby amber color, clear, with a very tight white head that settles into a puffy cap. The aroma is sweet with raisins and candied cherries, some peppery spice and some fusel alcohol. The taste is big on honey and raisins, candi sugar, very light tobacco. A very very sweet brew; hard to separate from a BSDA. Moderate body with prickly carbonation, again very sweet but not quite syrupy or cloying. Nice big flavors but not quite what I expected from a quad, expected more of a malt body and balance to the sweet. Still a well made brew but for a quad I can find better examples."
"D - This is a really nice quad. Another good one from Urthel."
"Thanks to jhamilton84 for the hook-up. 11.2oz bottle into a Le Merle tulip, pours a nice hazy dark orange with a thin lasting head that leaves almost no lacing. Aroma is loads of dried fruits and caramel with hints of molasses and alcohol. The taste is a nice complex blend of fruits, caramel and some subtle spice. The beer is certainly on the heavy side, but there is a smooth dryness that eases things up. This is a very enjoyable quad, one of the best beers from Urthel I've had."
"Pours a hazy amber color with some suspended yeast. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, tart malt, sugary sweetness, slight fruity aroma, and a hint of raisin. Fits the style of a Quadrupel. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt up front with some slight alcohol, then a strong sweetness overtakes. There are slight fruit flavors throughout. Overall, the sweetness smooths the alcohol flavors nicely and the finish is amazing."
"It's hard to believe this is nearly 12% abv! Taste is pretty standard for the style. Not exactly unique, but in no way flawed. Surprisingly bitter finish considering the big malty smell. A terrific balance. Full-bodied and extremely drinkable. I've had worse quadrupels! I would definitely recommend this, and probably get it again if I see it."
"D: Outside of the bit of heaviness I feel from this beer, it is quite good. It can be a challenging brew, but given plenty of time, it should make for an enjoyable evening."
"This is a great beer, but it would be more drinkable if it weren't so sweet. Definitely a ""special ale"" for that special winter occasion--drink a bottle when the blizzard starts and by the time you wake up, the blizzard should be over."
"Second Urthel beer and it beats the pants off of Hop It if you ask me. Pours copper/amber mix with thick, off-white head. Good retention, lacing was so-so. Smell is of yeast and dark fruits, some alcohol as well, almost vodka like. Taste was complex as a good quad should be. Nice mix of yeast, bread, dark sweet fruit, and an alcohol kiss. Warming as it goes down. Mouthfeel was thick and silky. Overall an easy drinker given the massive ABV. It was too strong in the nose, but well hidden in the taste."
"Now I regret waiting, this is an amazing beer with a very rich, complex taste and aroma that, for me, puts to shame most of the beers I passed this up for in the past. Thick, somewhat heavy, and sweet, tastes of dark berries and dates, plus quite a bit more but unfortunately I didn't take notes while drinking so I'm working off memory. There are other reviews here with excellent details of the aroma & taste though. If you enjoy wines, the complexity & richness of the tastes reminded me of the first time I had Jarvis Cabernet Sauvignon, but at about 1/10th the price. High alcohol content (my bottle says 11%, not the 12% listed here) that's very well balanced with the multitude of other flavors."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As with most of the Quads we sampled, this mouthfeel was absolutely sublime. A soft, seafoamy texture that brings the best out of the beer's flavors. This won best in show for me, and I can't wait to enjoy another one soon with a wedge of good Trappist cheese."
"I enjoyed slowly making my way through the bottle."
"This beer is everywhere at once, but always giving a confectionate sweetness and wine-like fruitiness that makes it difficult to drink. It's sweetness, along with the disjointed nature of flavors and the inbalance keeps this beer from competing with the St. Bernardus and Chimays of the world. Definately prefered to the La Trappe and most American attempts of the Dark Strong Belgian styles."
"Yum. Mom and I found this 12 oz to be tasty tease. Other than the strength, no impediment to drinking more than one. Even though I mentioned booze in the nose, mom had no idea it was high abv until it was gone and I told her."
"Overall impression: A big, fruity, Belgian Strong Dark Ale. This one is a sipper and dangerously drinkable. Nicely done."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into my Westvleteren goblet. Pours a sort of ashen goldenrod color, sort of sickly to be honest. Certainly far lighter than any standard quadrupel. Creamy tan head displays great retention and leaves films of sticky lacing. Aroma is diacetyl and caramel. And that's it. Flavor is very similar. Old butterscotch and caramel make this a very sweet beer. There is also a whisper of dark fruitiness and alcohol. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and sticky from the sweetness. Pretty one-dimensional, and possibly suffering from a brewing flaw with all that diacetyl. Not really mindful of the style either."
"Urthel Samaranth is definitely a quadrupel ale. The color is a dark amber and is opaque. It has a scent that I can't place. Not bad. Just different. The flavor is very similar. There is a destinct malty flavor and you can taste the alcohol. But, there is something else that I can't quite put my finger on. There is a fair amount of carbonation. The combination of the malt and carbonation give the beer a good feel. Overall, it is a decent beer. It is very strong in both alcohol (11%) and malt flavoring. Not something that you are going to drink several of. Just a nice beer to sip and enjoy. Cheer!"
"This beer, even with the high abv is highly drinkable. That is one of the hgh points. Taste vs. Drinkablility v. Price is amazing. Have one. Give it a try."
"Not bad, but like I said at least twice already this is way too unbalanced."
"A pretty easy drinking quad , worth trying."
"D: Given the heft, this was surprisingly drinkable. Would love to try this on draft."
"Drinkability: As far as Quads go, this one is just a bit too sweet and syrupy for my taste, but I would still buy it again. Seems complex enough where if paired correctly it would be delicious."
"Mouthfell was medium body with hint of spiceness and alcohol which it hides very well for the percentage."
"D: It was a rich, flavorful and complex beer that left me wanting more. I'm prone to keeping this one in my stash for special occasions."
"I could drink a couple of these."
"Poured into a tulip glass, it was a hazy dark red with a good white head that was retained over the entire length of the drink. Could see some slight streaming of carbonation to the top of the glass. The aroma was sweet and fruity. The taste had some fruit flavors, I could swear that it was cherry, mixed in with malt a every so slight mention of the alcohol. A little too sweet for my taste. Carbonation was good and the beer was easy to drink, but you probably don't want to drink too many at one time. Overall, a very good beer."
"A 750ml bottle served in a tulip glass. This beer was a ruby red color with a medium-sized white head that left a little bit of lacing. It had a sweet, fruity aroma. I would describe the aroma as that of cranberry orange bread. The taste was fruity, with a strong malt presence. Hops kicked in late. Maybe a little bit on the sweet side, but a truly enjoyable beer."
"Tasty and strong, but it could definately dry up a bit. Too sweet."
"Poured into a snifter and got a huge bubbly, almost white heat about three fingers thick that would not go away! ... it has some very dense lacing and it covered a nice deep amber body that was full of carbonation. It has a very faint fruity aroma with a faint alcohol and some sweet scents as well, but that's all I got room it. It has semi-smooth feel with a thick body and some a strong carbonation feeling on your tongue. It has a good earthy taste mixed in with some dark fruits, a few spices and a dry aftertaste, and it warms up your mouth as it goes down, but you can barely taste the alcohol init."
"Thanks, Jason, for sending this, back in January '07."
"Other than the insanely delicious Hop-It (and possibly Tonicum Finiboldhus), I haven't been impressed with De Leyerth Brouwerijen beer. Samaranth is decent, but it's no quadrupel. Sorry, can't recommend this one."
" Good, fruity Belgian / Dutch strong ale that just lacks the complexity to make it a really great beer. This one seems very filtered so I doubt aging would make alot of difference, but it may be worth trying. Decent drinkability for such a big beer but the aggressive alcohol aroma detracts and makes me think I could ignite a shot of this stuff every time the glass gets close to my nose."
"750ml caged and corked bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy brown-red body with a thin light tan head. Smells fruity - grapes, plums, and apples most noticeable, with a generous dose of brown sugar and caramel. Tastes very fruity as well, with apple and plum like qualities, along with a generous dose of caramel and toffee... Just a hint of alcohol toward the finish, with a fair bit of alcohol warming apparent. Heavy bordering on viscous body with light carbonation. A sipper for certain, but the pleasing combination of flavors helps the drinkability some. All-in-all a solid tasty quad, no more, no less."
"Sampled on 4/12/08."
"D: Very good drinkability considering the abv with a nice complexity leaves you wanting more."
"A good sipping beer. Just don't drink too many too early if you are planning a long night out!"
"Quircky little gnome-looking dude on the bottle looks like he's enjoying this one. Have a feeling I will too. Pours a hazy copper with a fleeting and thin off-white head into a goblet. Biscuity aromas up front with some phenols, fresh baked cinnamon bread and apples as an afterthought. This creates an interesting smell that I have not quite experienced before. Big and edgy malts fill the palate. The alcohol heat is present. I like to know it's there, so that's cool with me. Apples, white grapes and pears mix in well with some sour candy while a very inconspicuous hoppiness lurks in the background. Carbonation is quick, huge and excellent. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is as expected in a beer of this magnitude. That is, it makes you respect it's complexity. All that being said, there is something about this beer that doesn't totally suit what I'm looking for in a quadrupel. It's something I can't quite put a finger on, but that in no way makes it lesser of a beer, and is probably due more to personal preference than anything else."
"Deceptively easy to drink. Once you start sippin' the alcohol seems to settle way into the background"
"Drinkability - Very nice for a beer with high alcohol."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is moderate really but the alcohol really brings on a heavier feel. Carbonation is relatively light but persistent. The strength of the brew is distracting to me, but the more you drink the more tolerable it becomes. Overall pretty good, but it's something I really need to be in the mood for."
"Taste strongly complemented the aroma... Certainly not the best Quad I've sampled, and a far cry from many of the more well-known Belgian versions out there... Nonetheless, this was a decent brew, gathering some flavor, with a decent mouthfeel, although drinkability took a hit due to the high ABV and lack of exciting and intricate flavors..."
"Can you say underrated? Maybe I somehow got a bottle that was blessed by the beer gods, but I thought this brew was absolutely wicked. I'll be revisiting this again soon."
"Overall, this is a big, tasty beer, but the alcohol catches up with it. There's a fusel alcohol feel and big warming feel. The appearance is a dark brown with a thin tan head. The aroma is an almost creamy sweetness of caramel malt and esters. The flavor is quite complex, with chocolate and cherries, cola, toffee, caramel, and a touch of dates. The fruits are very big, but rather a nice compliment to the sweet malts. It's a shame about the booze, we'd have an otherwise awesome quad here."
"Full body with a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Very strong and the alcohol doesn't hind at all in this one. All in all, a nice strong Quad worth your time and money."
"Overall, I would say to head on down to the place where you buy your beer. Request that they start carrying it. Walk in there one day with a ski mask on and yielding an automatic rifle, demand the money out of the cash register. And with that money turn around and buy the Samaranth. You just can't steal beer, can you?"
"Overall a nice and warming pint, but the finish had me drinking a glass of water and ordering something else new."
"a fitting beer for the last while in Amsterdam!"
"It is pretty drinkable for a quad, do not get me wrong; as compared to a more traditional quad (or even a non-traditional one, like the Ommegang Three Philosopher's that I had on Sunday so it's the most fresh-in-my-mind-quad-experience) it is a lot smoother, a lot crisper, a lot easier to drink. The alcohol is there, so if you're drinking a 750 by yourself you'll be feeling it a little before you finish it. But it is a lot easier to drink then a lot of quad's that there are. However, what is interesting about this beer is that I can't foresee a lot, if any, people falling in love with this beer. It's a little tart for quad lovers, a little too dry-sour for flemish sour lovers; I can imagine people who love Geuze's might find this acceptable, but that's a really low in alcohol style, so the alcohol might get to them. It's a tough beer- there are so many things to like about it, but there isn't anything to love about it: dammit."
"Pairing suggestions: good with mild goat cheeses. I'm imagining it a solid winner with: grilled scallops, creme brulee, salmon, pork terrine/chops (esp. with cherry sauce), duck with cherries, sweetish mushroom napoleon, or a fruit tray: apples, pears, kiwi fruit."
"Thanks to Brouche for sending me this brew in the NoBS BIF ULTRA. Served slightly chilled in my Westvleteren glass, from an 11.2 ounce brown bottle. Poured a deep, almost brown, amber color. A solid inch of thick, bubbly off-white head rose up from the glass. Awesome head retention on this beer, thanks to the very active carbonation bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Tons of thick, clingy lace was left behind on the glass. Smell was of plums, dark cherries, a touch of wood, Belgian yeast, candi sugar, and a touch of alcohol. Very fruity. Flavor was again plum, semi-sour dark cherries, some sweet malts, sweet candi sugar, and some faint yeasty notes. Finishes rather smooth, with some alcohol heat felt in the back of the throat. Tons of carbonation felt as well. A nice full bodied mouthfeel, that was somewhat thick and palate coating. Pretty good drinkability, just becareful, the big ABV will sneak up on you. A solid Urthel offering."
"Somehow this is a bit dull tasting; certainly not bad and nothing seems particularly off, but I is just not quite as well balanced and flavorful as I expected."
"clearly by my rating i feel that this beer is severely underrated. I think this brouwerij would do a lot better if they got rid of their goofy ass labels. pours a dark, yet fairly clear and very yeasty brown. nose is of dried fruit. The taste follows with typical dry dark fruit taste with a little bit of spices. very sweet on the lips and very smooth for its 11%. a wonderful example of a belgian quad. Dont be fooled by the pathetic attempts of american breweries at a belgian style quadruple, so far only belgium has perfected this style. not to say those beers arent good cause they are ( the Reverend by avery) but they are a long shot from a real quad. great beer, worth the price, be careful pouring unless you like a little extra nutty flavor."
"I've had this brew probably 6-8 times over the year, and have always been happy with my purchase... tasty and a good value for a Belgian quad. I need to pick up some more for the cellar and promise myself to not actually drink them when I am feeling a jones for Belgian beers."
"Flavorwise this is more subdued than Urthel's tripel, which is odd, but it still has a great taste. I should note that my bottle is different and the ABV is marked as 11% (since the tripel I bought was also different, I think the pictures/ABV info need to be updated for this brand). The scent is characteristically Belgian with some trappist cheese figuring into the odor. Tastes of candi sugar, blackberry and mild spice; the alcohol is well-masked. I thought the tripel tasted a bit better but this is also excellent."
"Very good beer. Perhaps not exceptional, but quite enjoyable nonetheless."
"A sipper no doubt. But a very interesting one to enjoy."
"Easy to drink for such a warmingly alcoholic brew, I can only have one at a time, but I am glad I have a few more in the cellar."
"M/D: Carbonation is just right, smooth. Drinkability is OK considering the ABV. Medium bodied and incredible smoothness."
"The glass started out pretty good at first but the alcohol finish got to me after a while."
"This has a good deal of promise and allure, and I'm rating it decently, because I feel the good outweighs the bad. Ultimately, it probably needs many years to settle down. And even then, I have a feeling the sparse body will have a hard time dealing with its firewater tendencies."
"This is definitely a beer to keep around during the winter months."
"Try this one with glazed ham (sounds unusual - but it works!)"
"Pours a medium brown orange with a good crean colored head. No real hop aroma to speak of but I do detect sweetess in the aroma. Taste reminds me of burnt candy sugar-carmel? I don't expect hops-and don't get them. Mouthfeel is edium and drinkability is high. I am no a huge fan of Belgium beers-but this is one of my favs."
"Mouthfeel is full and luscious while maintaining a reasonable amount of drinkability. It accomplishes this with a dry finish. Highly recommended."
"D - Not my favorite quad, and not my favorite urthel product. A bit rough on the palate with a strong alcoholic taste, perhaps some more aging could do this one well. Sort of a light take on the quad, and although its interesting, its a bit of a let-down."
"I'd consider buying it again, but for this style I find it more exciting to explore than to settle on one brew. Something that could be thoroughly enjoyed around the holidays."
"D- Cant put my finger on it I mean, at first it seems like a decent beer but something about this one kicks ass. I loved it!"
"Good drinkability for this ABV. This new style 11.2 oz. bottle reads 11.0% ABV."
"at night."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy/sticky, and the drinkability is only so-so."
"Drinkability: I can't properly explain it, but this bizarre beer saddens me."
"Draught. Red-Orange. Aroma of sherry, caramel, salty almonds, raisins, prunes, Belgian malts, citrus hops and big, big, alcohol. Tastes of big, caramel-like Belgian malts, toffee, sugars, fruits (prunes, raisins, plums), coconut and pineapple. Well hidden alcohol. An enjoyable beer and this pounds very well. Its like drinking water."
"Drinks a little slow, due to dryness& little too much booze profile. But not for 12%. Not my favorite quad, but reccomended none the less. This brewery has yet to dissapoint me"
"Drinkability- I do not see 11.5% in this brew. I would have guessed it for a very flavorful Dubbel of around 8%. Exceptionaly easy drinker for a quad and very tasty as well."
"I am not a beer fan in general, but I LOVE Belgian ales. In fact, I have yet to have one that I don't like. I recently had the Urthel Samaranth at Richo's Pub House (aka New Albanian Brewing Company) during their Gravity Head shindig. I have to say it is easily in my top 3 of this style, Chimay Grand Reserve and Delirium Tremens being the other 2. I was served in the appropriate Urthel glassware and it was very pretty too look at, and it smelled wonderful. It was very sweet and very strong. I'm not an expert at picking out flavors and such like some people on here, but I know that I am definitely going to be looking for it anywhere and everywhere that sells beer."
"I got this bottle for just over $4, a steal IMHO, if it wasnt mispriced Im going back for the lot of them."
"You can tell from the first appearance that this is not your ordinary quad. Urthel continues to impress with solid brews that push the boundaries of existing styles."
"Another outstanding Belgian from what is fast becoming my favorite Belgian brewery."
"Dark honey-gold and cloudy. Flavor is rich and smooth with fruity hints and just a whisper of bitterness. The texture is smooth, but it has a nice bite that reminds you this is a strong ale. One of the best beers I have ever tried, worth seeking out."
"I'm sure this one is great fresh, but two years really added some smoothness, I'm buying some more of this first chance I get."
"This was poured into an Urthel chalice, and produced a dark reddish brown with a tan dense head. Good lacing. It is very rich in apple and sugar smells, with other fruit as well. Very hearty and strong. The apple qualities prevail in the taste with a nice sweetness and strong alcohol start and a good hoppy finish. Very smooth and very drinkable despite the ABV"
"There are better quads out there, but this is still a great one. Recommended."
"I had the pleasure of being introduced to the brewer of Urthel and her beer at Toronado in San Francisco a month ago. Ever since then, I've been trying to get my hands on (no, not her although Hildegard is a sight for sore eyes) her Hop It creation, but I have yet to find a store in my area that carries it in the 1 plus pint bottle. While my search continues for that precious gem, I came across this accomplishment and what an accomplishment it is. This quad with the funny name was popped from a corked bottle and instantly got me pumped to experience its flavor. Lots of fruit, particularly strawberries and sweet fruit in general, but not in an overpowering way. And this is not to suggest this headed into lambic country...quite the opposite. It pours into my Duvel tulip glass with a deep copper color and a white head that settles quite nicely. Lace draped the glass throughout the entire experience. A very abundant aroma, again strawberries and sweet fruit gushed from my deep glass. And lots of candied sugar in the aroma too, which introduced itself in the initial taste. Again, not overpowering, but the sweetness balances so perfectly with the slightly boozy finish and the silky smooth mouthfeel. I think ""balanced"" best describes this quad. It's sweet pleasant flavor makes this a highly drinkable treat, in fact one of the best I've ever had. Although there is some alcohol in the finish and at 11.5% abv, it's a whopper of a brew which will give you a nice buzz, the alcohol is quite subtle. Drink it with a roaring fire in the hearth and a block of room temperature Cabot's Seriously Sharp Cheddar cheese. It simply doesn't get much better than that."
"From a 750ml corked, caged bottle. As God, or at least his workers, intended. Pours an energetic cloudy brownish-orange with a medium density rocky head. Much lighter than I expected for a quadrupel, which is I assume the style based on the description ""quadrium ale"". OK, so also I cheated by reading the style listed here, but let's not nitpick. Smells of caramel, bubblegum, sour oranges and a hint of something oaky. Also not what I expected of the style but nothing I don't like yet. Taste? I think I'm doing the dog getting scratched in the right place leg twitch. Oranges, cocoa, lemons, a dry finish that just brings the malty start to a perfect balance. The mouthfeel is silky and oily, not really chewy at all. Again, surprises me for its style. Drinkability probably goes without saying given the review so far. No real alcohol burn a bit of warmth, so no problems there. The balanced flavor will make this whole bottle go down rather easily. In short, find this one...and fast!"
"A nice quad. Seems like a nice beer to be drinking on this Super sunday, as the Colts repeatedly punt and turn the ball over."
"D: Very drinkable and quite enjoyable. Extremely coating on the palate. High abv isn't noticeable."
"an interesting beer. pours a wheaten straw color. i kind of expected something a little darker, this being a quad. the nose is kind of absent. slight fruit notes, slight alcohol. not real exciting. the taste on the other hand is much better. the malt is a little subdued but the fruit is right up front. overall really well balanced, nothing to write home about though. this beer did have incredible lacing. not bad, but at 12% the lines of good and ba"
"I also get a bit of booze but not enough to suspect the 11.5%. This is a very drinkable beer, but a little mild for a quad. I was a little disappointed."
"Eric"
"Overall, it will be a good experience if you're not turned off by a fruit influence on a strong Belgian Quad. The malt is not completely lost on this one, but it is far from a focus. Certainly worth a go."
"I look forward to trying more of their product as their whole line is available here."
"Excellent beer."
"The pour into my Chimay chalice raises a lasting two finger head that falls slowly. It's very creamy, and colored very light tan. The beer is barely translucent, and has very visible carbonation streaming from the center of the glass. The body has a murky brown color, but with an odd internal glow, perhaps due to odd light diffusion. The lacing is certainly resilient. There are some ruby highlights, as well. The nose is yeasty, darkly fruity, raisiny, caramel, and has hints of coffee. The taste is very sweet throughout, with many of the above characteristics joining in, plus a lovely cinnamon flavor. The alcohol is hidden very well, and only shows itself when the sips are too closely spaced. Perhaps it adds a bit of a peppery taste, too. The mouth is definitely on the thick side, with very tingly carbonation. Definitely the best quad I've gotten to thus far."
"I first sampled this last year at Arbor Brewing Company's Belgian tasting. I was so impresssed that I went out the next day and purchased some for more intensive 'sampling'. It's been a favorite ever since. Beware: the alcohol in this little fellow can sneak up on you. An excellent beer for winter-time hibernation."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, tons of lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, slight hops, spices, and slight citrus. The taste is slightly tangy/sweet, some spices, with a slight dry finish, and warm feeling in the throat. Medium body, a well rounded/complex brew, alcohol content hidden well. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from Urthel, highly recommended."
"Poured out a cloudy orange, light-brown colored body with a big off-white head with decent lacing. the nose is citrus, with a yeast and pepper aroma. the taste starts malty with an alcohol bite. It continues to grow into yeast, apricot, peach, plum, spice, pepper, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and oily. Finishes big and long with a burn."
"Great beer."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great. Also obviously, high abv supresses sessionability."
"This beer pours dark gold with a foamy cappuccino like head with nice lacing. The smell is sweet and yeasty but not too strong. The taste is very much like the smell but much more up front, plus there is a lot of spiciness that compliments the beer nicely. The mouthfeel is cery creamy with a nice carbonation that feels like bottle conditioned beer. Overall, its nice, a very good beer."
"Color of clear honey - egg shell head semi frothy - nose of tobacco , red berries , molasses , chocolate , and metallic Taste of molasses / brown sugar , subtle dark red berries , milk chocolate , and cane sugar  body is frothy , and creamy  aftertaste of molasses , acidic fruit , and is dry"
"However, I do remember enjoying this! Good example of a Quad and I will by this again."
"A very impressive quadrupel. Poured a honey color with not to much head. Had very nice lacing inside the glass. Smell had a little alcohol in it but not to much to take away from th rest of the beer. Only way i can really explain the taste is very ""winey"" if that makes any sense. overall a vey good belgium, considering I am not a big fan i thought this one was very drinkable"
"Mouthfeel- Warm and light in fruitiness."
"On tap, poured into a Three Philosophers Snifter. Initial 2-finger thick head that very slowly dissolves into a web of fragmented lacing throughout the sides of the glass. The hue was thin and golden and a little more transparent than you'd expect for this style. Initial nose hints at a a subtly candied banana flavoring with a a haze of alcohol. The first swig reveals a dry and slightly bitter taste, offering a spicy tickle on my tongue. The feel is initially vibrant and complex with a splash of sour banana jumping out. That complexity, however, fades pretty quickly with each sip. After finishing, I was left with a subtle burn in the back of my throat. Overall, a pleasant experience - something I'd definitely order again, but with the high alcohol that starts to kick in as the glass empties, I'd probably drink no more than 1 of these in a single sitting."
"Extremely drinkable. Has a nice winey taste, but very balanced, dep and rich while retaining a nice smoothness."
"Drinkability: Above average, nothing grating or cloying about this beer, and easy to drink. Well above average."
"Piquantly spicy with a touch of black pepper coupled with a nicely sweet ripened tropical fruit flavor. Mouthfeel is slightly viscous, and carries with it a moderate alcohol sensation, though not as strong as one would imagine from an 11.5% ABV beer. A well crafted, thoroughly enjoyable beer. One of the better I've had in recent memory."
"It takes a lot of flavor to punch through the heavy blanket of alcohol, but the interestingly complex components nonetheless blend enjoyably to come of smartly. The ABV, as noted, is mighty beefy, and it is wisely heeded, placing a very real limit on things. A lot of beer, a lot of flavor, and a lot of fun, all in one bottle. What a deal!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The flavor matches the aroma nicely as it begins witha slight touch of a citrusy bitterness that segues into a sweet/toasty malt flavor that finshes very clean. For an alcohol content of 11.5 this ale drinks incredibly smooth and I find that it is easier to drink than Duvel though I find this much more complex."
"A great beer but a little thin for a quadrupel."
"The draft pours a deep golden amber color, with moderate haze and small whitish head, which lingers around leaving a delicate, sugary lace. Very strong aroma appears to be a gridlocked battle between caramel/sugar, fresh, bitter hops, sweet, fruity esters, and alcohol. The discreetness of the aromas was my first indication the quad might be bit unbalanced, and a few sips quickly confirmed that tastes of these aromas were indeed not well blended, albeit a bit more complex then the nose had lead me to expect. The hops, accentuated by the apparent hardness of the water, ultimately dominated the finish of this beer, which is rather unusual for the style but indicative of the brewery's willingness to experiment. There was also a very pleasant tartness from the yeast in addition to the sour apple, grape and citrus esters. Although the body was rather syrupy, the generous use of sugar drys out and balances the richness of the sweet malt, with notes of caramel, honey, toast, rum and raisins. There is a lot to the mouthfeel, but it would have done better had the overall taste profile been smoother. This quad is fairly drinkable, as it's relatively digestible in spite of such high gravity, making for a robust tasting beer that goes down easy and masks it's high ABV very well. Still, the recipe could use some tweaking, and additionally, the beer tasted a bit young. Bottle conditioned I'm sure it would smooth out nicely with age, but the fresh keg I tasted had clearly not fully matured. The Urthel is certainly worth trying for those that tend to gravitate to the more 'extreme' beers, but purists (and light-weights!) might want to steer clear."
"Taste marked down some due to increasing bitterness into the bottle, despite being in a very poorly lit incandescent light area."
"This pours a clear reddish amber with a huge head. The head has a million tiny bubbles,alot of carbonation in this beer. The smell is candy sugar and smoked wood. The aroma is very sweet with abit of a hop afterscent. The taste is sweet with candy,smoked wood, hops, and maybe an apple aftertaste. The m/f is medium and very well balanced. This is a very drinkable quadrupel, The alcohol is sudued. I would highly recommend this."
"Taste was sweet and sticky with alcohol, and very little bitterness. There was fruit like apricots and peaches, packed in an overly sweet body. There is little I can say about this beer, except that I feel this beer was completely out of balance, very little bitterness to compensate for the alcohol and sweetness of the beer. I am probably one of the few that has this opinion and I don't think this is a bad beer, but it needs less body (sweetness) or more bitterness."
"Yet another in a long line of Belgian beers that I would die for. Despite the high alcohol it goes down easily and the complex, exotic flavor profile makes every sip a joy."
"On tap at the Sharpe Edge Emporium, appears a deep ruby amber tone sorta cloudy leaves fine belgian style lacing as the off white head dwindles slowly. Aroma contains lucious fruity highlights of plum, raisins, tart apple, and alcohol tones also presents a light herbal hop tone. Taste comes off a bit tart with the fruit tones a deep rich sweetness caramel malts with all of the raisin, apple, plum notes finishes with a mildly alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied smooth easy going brew very soft carbonation and very flavorful. Drinkability very nice another winner from Urthel love the Hop-It as well, great quad not over the top way too drinkable."
"An unusual quad, in that most brewers aim for darker malts and more ripe fruits. Very tasty, though, and the strength kinda sneaks up on you."
"Pours out a light orange amber with a lightly tan head. the aroma is very fruity, orange and apple. It smells sweet. The taste is also quite fruity, apples and grapes. Is pretty sweet and lightly spiced, just a touch yeast. I dont taste any of the alcohol. The aftertaste seems to be fruity and more on the tart side than sweet. It's got lots of carbonation. I didnt expect this one to look or taste anything like it does when i bought it. But still good to enjoy."
"This was my first Urthel offering. Nice intro to their line of beers. Up next, Hop-it. But not tonight."
"large bottle, caged and corked, no freshness indication, but the label reader is informed twice that this is ""Belgium's newest cult classic"" pours clear glistening, light almond amber, minimal yeast in the bottle, near white puffy head, leaving, gobs of fine and scattered lacing and high quality sheeting. Nose is full of alcohol, some vanilla and honey. Strong, heady brew, lucious and smooth mouthfeel, notes of spicy honey,vanilla, pepper, warming alcohol. Nicely rounded flavors, fruity, with a spicy hoppy finish, clearly a high quality sipper. More B.A. worthy Belgian brew from Urthel. Well worth seeking out and enjoying"
"The taste is truly nice with hints of alcohol and fruits permeating the mouth. Most beers of this strength can be a slow drink but Urthel has created a very drinkable quadrupel. It is a beer that can be drank in quantity since the alcohol is there but not as strong as many beers of this caliber. I highly recommend."
"This is my first offering by Urthel, and I am quite impressed. At $6.99 per 750 ml of this, I will surely fall back on this as something to treat myself to every now and then. Although this was quite different from the St. Bernardus ABT 12 I had some months ago (and I really don't know which one better represents the ""style""), I found this to be uniquely different and uniquely delicious."
"d: Not a bad drink. I'm drinking it slow but steady."
"recommended, find someone to split the bottle with. 750ml worth of this rich liquid is too much IMHO for one person."
"Aroma is strong with a sour mash of a wide variety of fruits. name a soft fruit and this smells a little like it and thext seven soft fruits you can name. Definitely leans toward the exotic ones though. Mango, papaya, guava, but there are overripe bannana pear notes as well. Color is hazy orange. Head is fast diminish and bubbly white. Fruity/yeasty fore that is quite soft and tasty. Finish is all hot throat burning alcohol, but its works with the flavores here playing the thorns to the fruity flavors rose. Gets a bit spicy just before the finish, but the spice notes are second fiddle to the exotic fruit mash of flavors here."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable big belgian beer."
"Had on tap at Brouwer's Cafe in Seattle, labeled on the beer list as Urthel Quadrupel so I am assuming this is it. Came in the proper Urthel glassware a surprising bright candy red, I was expecting something a bit darker...very nice looking nonetheless. Taste was strong with malts mixed with yeast born fruitiness....alcohol is fairly well hidden although the finish is quite warming. A much different beer than say Rochefort 10...an interesting beer to try if you have the chance."
"Opinion: I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe this beer. I like the flavor for the most part, but I am thinking that it is a little off. I am thinking that there was a bit of oxidation that is causing the off flavors, so I will have to go back and try the beer again to see if that was the case. Regardless, I would have a hard time putting this beer up against some of the other beers listed here as ""Quads"". So far, I am much more partial to their Tripel."
"This is a delicious beer; huge, but very well made. It has some Belgian funk, but not much. Malt is the star in this one, along with the work of the yeast. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is amply carbonated, smooth but tart, and the 11.5% ABV is masked very well. Very drinkable for a Quad, perhaps dangerously so. An excellent offering from Urthel."
"Really good and unique strong ale."
"This beer came in a tulip glass with a slight head that fell to ring quickly. Its honey gold in color. Smells of apples, candy, sweet malt and a touch of spicy yeast. Tasted of oranges, honey and sweet cream. The finish left the back of my tongue dry with hops along with a little warming. Mouth feel was heavy with little carbonation."
"I wouldn't be surprised if the colour only comes from dark, caramelized sugar."
"It's a well balanced, spicy, fruity, firm quad that really sinks its teeth into ya. It goes down just right for its higher ABV and will hit ya late as it dwells in the head. Recommended."
"Body medium, yet dextrous and coating. Mouthfeel smooth, but with rough edges due to the alcoholis heat. Very happy to finally have this available to me."
"Drinkablility was good on this one, but just a little too over the top to be a regular."
"Overall Impression: As a Quad, its a bit light in body, a bit lacking in depth. I think this is more of a Belgian-English Barleywine. Ok, I cant make up styles, but I really think thats pretty close to whats going on here. I enjoyed this over the course of a Sunday afternoon, it warms wonderfully (both me and in terms of flavor). Id recommend this one, just take your time with it."
"33c stubby brown bottle. Been sitting on this longer than I had intended (a few months) so let's see where it takes me. Clear copper with a thin ivory lacing, surprisingly no yeast in the bottle. Tiny bubbles constantly cascade from the bottom of my Duvel glass, keeping the lacing intact. Spicy, slightly smoky aroma blends with bubblegum and apple cider. Taste is rather one-dimensional; the hops are ever present at the start, but nothing seems to follow but the warming alcohol finish. Highly acidic and quite dry in the finish as well. My stomach is warm. The alcohol is present both in warmth and quickness to the skull. Watch out for this one. Though I believe any beer is worth trying once, this is not one worth seeking out in my opinion. If you can find this, you can certainly find better Belgian examples of the style."
"On-tap at Marcellar's in Idaho Falls. Brilliant, clear deep golden yellow body with a generous, fluffy white head. Nose is outrageously sugary and sweet, but not offensively so. Candyish, but also fruity (apple?), with a definite herbal hop bitterness. Sweet, candy malt flavors up front. Sugary fruits and grain that trend toward trippel-like. Some pepper in there too. Big sweetness demands and receives ample bitterness. Dries out the sweetness with some acidic, herbal bitterness. Finish is warming and nice. Full-bodied, with a thick feel. Not too syrupy though. Like a big trippel. Nice and more drinkable than a 12 % avb beer should be!"
"Cheers!"
"11.2 ounce bottle, code dating on back. Says 11.5% abv on label."
"I found the mouthfeel to be a bit light for a quad. I'm guessing the alc renders a numbing effect. Not impressed with the drinkability."
"Poured from a squat 11.2 oz bottle this was a surprisingly clear orange with tall white head. Light rings of lace were left as the foamy head receded. Fruits and sugar sweetness dominated the aroma. Some alcohol was there as well. Not much else unfortunately. Sweet candy sugars and light fruit notes made up the majority of the flavor as well. Alcohol was a bit more apparent in the taste. Not much going on here it seems. No off flavors just sweetness and alcohol. Warming with a syrupy sticky sweet feel to it, pretty thick. Drinkability was so-so. Definitely at the bottom of my list for quads I have tasted."
"Pours a small foamy cream colored head that fades quickly to a thick film. Smells of toasted malt and butterscotch on top of apricots and apples. Hazy, glowing golden amber colored beer. Flavors of light fleshy fruits mix with a light malty sweetness. The bitterness picks up midway through and becomes almost salty towards the end. Mouthfeel is slightly slick, and the alcohol is warming. The bitterness fades as the beer warms and the flavor really smooths out. Not bad, but I'm not a big fan of strong sweet toasted/butterscotch flavor."
"Explodes out of bottle and pours a five-finger+ light tan head that stays forever and leaves a good lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet malty nose. Starts with a nice mix of malt and hops, finishes with a sweet piney flavor. $7.45 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"The beer comes fresh from the tap a hazy deep amber color with a plentiful head that is a winsome light tan and creamy in texture, after decomposition the resultant lace forms a surrounding blanket on the glass. Nose is earthy from the yeast, an over ripe apple aroma also noticed, spicy and fresh, start is slightly sweet with a nice grain profile, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is striking in its acidity, the hops plentiful and the 12 percent ABV leaves a bit of alcohol bitterness at the very dry finish, potent brew, and quite tasty to boot."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy medium brown ale with a huge head with great retention. Aroma is mix between spices, great malt and strong yeast. Carbonation is excellent and body is above average. Very sweet taste (probably a tad too much) with some subtle raisins in the background. Yeast is very present and may hides a bit of overall taste of this. Alcohol is not detectable which I always appreciate from brewers. Great for the style but still not up there with the greats (Westy, Rochefort, St-Bernadus)."
"thanks to crjmellor once again!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Wow. This is an incredibly Quadrupel. Altough it's not a West 12 or Rochefort 10, it's still a wonderfully complex and balanced ale that in a few years will be out of this world. Killer stuff."
"This beer was listed at the Lucky Baldwin's Belgian Beer Festival as a Barelywine. Some much for creative names. Whatever you call it, this beer was interesting at best. It is served in a Chimay chalice with a clear yellow color and a thin head. There is s fruity aroma and a light yeast smell to go along with the barely impressive color. The flavor is sweet with notes of citrus, candy, and light malts. It did not taste like such a big beer. Kudos to the brewer for being able to hide 12% without over doing the flavor. As impressive as that may be, I still was not terribly impressed with the flavor of this beer and consider it slightly above average at best."
"This 750 ml bottle will be drained with astonishing quickness, and I can be counted for picking up more bottles, to guarantee future happiness."
"Pours a glowing dark amber with a nicely building and nicely lacing head. This is a lot like a barley wine as brewed by the belgians. Its got that sugary sweet caramel flavor common to many British style barley wines (think JW Lees Harvest Ale) with a slight bit of that Belgian yeast funk. Theres a noticeable bit of alcohol in the aroma and flavor, but it complements the rest quite nicely. I thought this was top notch."
"I will try this again if I get the chance to have it on tap again."
"Large 25.4oz bottle. Cork explosion here. This beer pours a yellow color with a huge head that has great retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Lots of spices in the aroma. The flavor is very spicy as well. Some caramel malts as well as some alcohol. Finishes with a lot of spices. Very good. This is really how I like a Belgian to be."
"Shit man. We just popped the cork, and it was under so much pressure it hit the ceiling and came back down and nailed Chris before we knew what happened. That is the most explosive popping of the cork that I have ever seen. The beer pours very heady, with about 5 fingers of head over the beer that don't really allow us to get the contents of the bottle to the two glasses. The beer pours a golden amber color with a thick head that stays around. The nose is light raisin and tons a spiceys. The flavor is much more intense than the nose would tell. Lots of good raisin followed by a good dose of alcohol, finishing with a really big blast of spiceyness. The feel is right at moderate, smooth and slightly creamy. This beer has an aparent alcohol, but its not really affecting how easily it goes down. I think this is a very nice beer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" of eggshell head over the light copper brew. Head is resilient, with good lacing. Aroma is yeasty fruits, with a sweet undertone. Taste is initially slightly spicy malt, which gives way to excessive sweetness. Alcohol is not particularly apparent, but that mouthful of sugar could hide just about anything. Mouthfeel and drinkability both quashed by the sweetness, which for me, even for a quadrupel, seemed over-the-top. Worth a try if quads are your thing, but I probably won't be revisiting."
"Pourrs ashiney orange with a fluffy head that leaves globs of lace down my tulip glass,aromas of toasted grain and very fruity banana really comes out along with some very ripe sweet pineapple even noticed a little chocolate in there.Spicey flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg with a light tropical fruitiness with the alcohol burn really coming thru as it warms.Quite yeasty in the Belgian tradition a good cold weather sipper here on Xmas eve a nice quad."
"Drinkability: nice for a quadruple. Great brew - worth seeking out."
"Very good but not outstanding yeast makes for a much better than average brew. SIgnificantly spicy, orange-pineapple citrusy, nice orange with pretty lace. Liquorish. biscuit medium mouthfeel. Bitter finish. Nice hops, noticeable alcohol. Barleywine and citrus yeast aroma."
"Had on tap at Anam Cara. Pours a huge head, more than half the glass, so you have to wait for this one to settle down. Smells malty and fruity, with some bread smell too. Reminded me of a Belgian waffle with fruit poured over the top. Strong coconut and pineapple as well. The flavor has the hints of coconut, and somewhat musty / earthy tone. Strong alcohol flavors through out, and a watery mouth feel."
"A finishing tartness brought a pouting smile to my lips as I finished my last sip with the warring angel and devil at my shoulders completing their battle - the side of darkness capitulated, with whites bald statement that the following day was a school day resonating in the hollows of my mind."
"This Belgian Quadrupel ale poured a very slightly hazy amber color with tall, pillowy, white foam that persisted. Very nice. The smell was mildly fruity: banana, coconut, and pineapple. There was some caramel and a bit of sweetness in the aroma as well. The taste was sweet with notes of caramel, malt, coconut, fruit (bananas, pineapple). As the beer warmed, a bit of alcohol could be tasted. The mouthfeel was smooth but with an initial sharpness. It was sweet with medium body and low carbonation feel. The sweet fruitiness lingered. This was a good, sipping beer. Enjoyable."
"Appears that I should cellar one for awhile and then re-assess. A bit brazen and sharp at this point."
"I thought this was really really good. Not the most outstanding brew ever, but very good. Had it first last Friday at Redbones, and reading my notes say form that session: I'll be honest, the beer sounds decent, but no real exclamation points. Now on the next evening where I encounter it again on tap at Anam Cara. I got to drink it out of the most adorable glass ever (sorry!): big nose, gnome like fella, green meadow and flowers around the bottom of the glass. Of course, the proper glass made cream colored head about 10 ft tall (ok, more like 2-3 inches). Anyway, the presentation brought it all back on what lept out at me on the intitial sample I had at bones (before I ruined my pallet with another brew): Powdered cinnamon and yeast in the aroma. The beer had an orange amber glow to it. I found it full bodied, with more cinnamon spice in the taste. Yeatiness is apparent, although the alcohol sneaks in at end (at 12%, how could it not). Tasty. A special treat. Blew me 1/4 away across the room, but note: not halfway across the room."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle. Pours a hazed copper/bronze with a willful beige head. Aromas of some hefty teast, malt and a small bit of fruitiness. Head and lacing doesn't quit. Some biscuity-type malt flavors with some underlying fruitness to it, shortly like blueberry. A definite higher-alcohol puncher. A good. fruity quad, some that should be considered by many as a quality, high-gravity brew."
"Drinkability is very good. Little bit lighter that some quads but a sloid drinking beer."
"Update - I got a hold of a 2010. This really is a fantastic beer and unlike others of the style is not overly sweetened. There's actually some mild bitterness here that balances out the monster malt profile. This really is a fascinating Quad and I never get tired of exploring the different vintages. Best of all, if you want to age this you can put it away for five years and get a monster sugar-bomb."
"Big 750 ml bottle...first glass is surprisingly clear, later ones are lightly sedimented. Bright deep darker orange color -- big frothy yellow foam. Laces in sticky globs and sheets. Spicy aroma along with a vanilla-infused custard smell, nice. Heavy cinnamon sense comes on in the flavor quickly, but so is an impressive bittering that gets a little on the annoying side. Maltiness is good up front, some sense of pear and cherry but the body seems a little thin for as big a beer as this. Finishes dry with alcoholic heat. For a Quad, I was surprised how bitter and dry this one was (similarities to the Tripel recipe ?). Combined with the alcohol, this was less drinkable than I was expecting."
"Well, the cork on this one went of like a rocket. It poured an clear amber color and formed a bubbly white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, and spices with a hint of ginger. The flavor was of malt, caramel, yeast and some candy sweetness, with a warming aspect of the alcohol present. The finish was a bit sprite, yet sweet with a hint of dryness, but not really that astrigent. Another pretty good beer by this brewer at a good price for a Belgian."
"The aftertaste is on the same notes, fruity and warming, with a hop bitter in the finish that come back and envelops all."
