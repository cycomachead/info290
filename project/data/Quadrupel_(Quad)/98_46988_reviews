"O- huge flavors with some nice dark fruity notes, wasn't a fan of the mouthfeel but a worthy American example of the style."

"Overall- Not Harpoon’s best offering. Although… It is still significantly better than it was fresh. The alcohol has mellowed and it has become a pretty decent sipping beer. There was no real front or back to the beer. You had a big burst of flavor and then it cut off"
""
"O: Harpoon gives this style a decent effort but it is a bit hot in the alcohol presence and it may need to rest a few years to mellow. Decent fruit esters and nice peppery bite give the drink some good interest."

"2012 vintage poured into a snifter, super thin light tan head, no lacing, dark ruby/brown color, relatively clear, bubbly. Smell is easy, dark fruits mostly, hints of malt, some sweetness. Taste is similar, but also with a little spice. Not exactly what I am used to recently with other quads. Mouthfeel is average; carbonated, not particularly smooth. Overall not a huge fan, but not surprised."

"(3.5) D: Likely not something I would pick up again considering the whole cherry cough syrup thing. A little disappointed considering my enjoyment of the other Leviathan line offerings :("

"O - Overall, this is a very interesting beer, and the first quad I have ever had. If this is considered to be a bad quad, I cannot wait for Rochefort 10!."
""
""
""
""
"Not the worlds greatest quad, but I found this to be a fairly drinkable and pretty tasty take on the style."
"A mess of a brew.. I was very disappointed with this brew! It's becoming more and more rare to find a good quad, maybe I should give them up. This one didn't end up in the drain, but it's not recommended."

"12 ounce bottle into chalice, 2012 vintage. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Minimal lacing clings to the glass, with a small amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of plum, prune, molasses, caramel, cherry, toast, biscuit, banana, allspice, cinnamon, clove, and a bit of alcohol. Some pretty nice and quite unique Quadrupel aromas; with good balance and complexity. Taste of prune, cherry, toast, raisin, biscuit, allspice, banana, clove, and alcohol. Lingering notes of dark fruit, toast, spices, clove, banana, molasses, caramel, and biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Flavors are pretty good, but it is a bit boozy and not as complex as I was hoping. No cloying sweetness. Medium-low carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a fairly slick and thick mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol presence is quite noticeable with a large lasting warming on the finish. Overall this is an ok quad. Decent flavor balance and complexity; and pretty smooth to sip on slowly."
""
"I always have high expectations for Harpoon Leviathan beers, and this one does not meet them."
""
""
""
"O-Maybe with some aging, the alcohol will calm down. Because this beer has to much alcohol."
""
""
"Overall a decent quad but a bit too boozy in the nose and taste for me."

"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of cherries and plums, as well as some bread and brown sugar. The alcohol is also quite present. The flavor is similar. The beer is very boozy, but the dark fruit, candy sugar and Belgian yeast notes also are strong. The beer is very fruity overall, with a lot of cherries and figs in the flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"O - I gave this beer a legitimate shot, but it just didn't bring much enjoyment for me. I'm not against a big presence of alcohol, but in this case, it took away from accompanying flavors instead of enhancing them. I might try this beer again down the road, but only a bottle with significant age in hopes of mellowing out the heat and a more harmonious flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's big, sweet, and Belgian-esque, but it doesn't hold a candle to the principal Belgian quads (or even many of the domestic American renditions)."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, 2012 edition. This pours a darkish brown color with a long lasting massive tan head. The smells are of yeast esters, some ripe bananas, brown sugar a little caramel. The feel is medium to slightly thick. The taste is of brown sugar, ripe fruit and alcohol."
"I haven't liked the other 3 or 4 harpoon beers I've tried because I think their house yeast strain is awful, so knowing that they brewed this with a trappist yeast strain is why I tried this one. This is a really good, if not great, American version of a Belgian quad, better than many other American brewed Belgian quads. Up there with Allagash and Avery. I would definitely buy it again and highly recommend you try it."
""
""
""
"All in all Harpoon has made a tasty beer. The alcohol is as hidden as it can be in a beer of this strength. Barley wine like flavors start things off. More traditional quad flavors start to pop as things warm up. This quad may not quite measure up with the best of the best. Its still a tasty Belgian inspired brew."
""
"The aroma has notes of chocolate which mask the strong ABV. Very drinkable for this style of beer, which could be dangerous in the long run."
""

""
""
"D: Low. It tastes good, but can take a while to drink."
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is big with two hands. There is nice bold flavors and big feel that is boozy but sweet. A nice heavy beer that does not seem too big."
""

"Let me start by saying this is not one of my favorite styles. Poured a medium to deep brown/red with a nice 2 finger tan head, adequate lacing. Went downhill from here. Smell was intense booze and over the top sweet with fruits/malts (oranges, cloves, cointreau). Taste was melted carmel with carbonation. Heavy sugar taste, almost syrup. Way too sweet for my palate. Felt thick and heavy on the tongue, almost hot. Does not hide the 11.75% ABV very well. Letdown by the sweetness and over the top booze. Would not track this down for a 2nd try-"
"Overall - Kind of disrespectful to the style. This is so amazingly over sweetened with little depth to it at all. Booze soaked fruits are dominant and COMPLETELY dominant. If you want to get drunk, buy this beer, if you want to enjoy a beer, dont."
"Overall, a great beer to have on a cold day; its warming and pleasant. I am very impressed and will buy again."
" Sip this slow, 11.75% is hot with too little yeastie complexity."
"Toasted marshmallow malts up front. Warming notes of tropical fruits and rum come on heavy and fast. Ripe bananas, caramelized fruits, caramel, and boozy maple syrup round out the palate. Brown sugar and toasted marshmallow fill out the finish. Some faint herbal hop notes throughout, but they get very lost in the malt and booze of this big boy. Full-bodied, syrupy feel. This one will warm you up and give you your fill of rummy fruit. A definite sipper!"
"Quad reminded me of a cross between a Unibroue beer and Samuel Adams' Imperial White, the only drawback being that, unlike in those brews, Harpoon didn't quite manage to hide the strong alcohol flavor as well, leaving a bitterness to the aftertaste that didn't match the rest of the mouthful. Mouthfeel is indeed velvety, as noted in the brewer's blurb, and while I (mostly) agree that this is a ""superbly drinkable beer," I would also caution that this is not one for chugging. In fact, it should probably be savored like a glass of port."
"D - Very nice sipper. The second of the Leviathan series I've had so far, and the second one I've thoroughly enjoyed. Would give this one a second date anytime."
"Overall, an OK beer but not a particularly great example of the style. I'm not sure when this beer was bottled, but perhaps the booze would calm down a bit with some more age."
"Really not bad for an American made quad. A bit medicinal but not too bad, better than some of the other Leviathan series beers."
"O: My first Quad so I don't have a direct comparison. When I'm in the mood for dark this can play."
"Finishes with an almost thick coffee taste left on the tongue."
"A definite sipper and liquor type beer with Port-like qualities. There are other high alcohol beers that hide the alcohol better (e.g. Night Tripper)."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of brown sugar and dry raisins is enjoyable. Taste is a nice enough mix between some brown sugar notes with some notes of dry fruits. Body is not completely full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad overall with nice drinkability factor but lacking some complexity for the style."
"A solid and strong Belgian-style Imperial quad here, definitely worth enjoying again."
"O - I liked this. There's some complexity and a lot of flavor. At the same time, at 11.75% ABV, it's not a very sessionable beer."
"An interesting take on a Quad...but lacking some complexity, and just a bit too hot for me."
" Aroma was ok...light fruit notes, grapes, dates, perhaps some prunes at first come through. Lots of grain notes and a touch of alcohol as well. Not really very complex and overall a touch light for my tastes, but no matter we push on. Average here, perfect word. Not the most complex thing I have ever run across in my lifetime to say the least, this seemed to be amped up enough as the abv was quite apparent, but the rich fruit notes and complex taste were lacking. Lots of bland flavor that really did not go anywhere for me."
"O. This is really nice as on a dreary rainy day - rich and comforting. It is hitting me hard, so a sipper for sure. 4"
"D: Very low, its just too heavy and thick to have a lot."
"Drinkability - a pretty good bottle of beer in my book."
"O- Nice beer- but definitely not what I was expecting for a quad. Still, this is worth seeking out if you haven't tried it. Cheers."
"O - Not bad but seems a bit young and not completely harmonious."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle simply marked 026. Sampled on May 7, 2011. The pour is a handsome reddish-brown with little to no head and good clarity. The aroma is powerful with its malts and slight alcohol note. The body is between light and medium. The taste is full of sweet malty notes and a dry hop bite at the end. It is a reasonable take on the style."
"This beer matched with that entree was outstanding. The food and beer were perfectly complimentary and overall added to an excellent night. This is a quadrupel belgian style that for me is a 1 for 1 fine wine replacement. Being $10 for a 4-pack you can't drink it all the time but it is a nice treat for special occasions."
"O - like I wrote, a little one-dimensional, hard to get past the primary flavor, but that 11.75% really does you nicely. Not subtle, more of an in your face quad."
"D - The appearance is less than spectacular, but the flavor and aroma make up for it. Very delcious flavor and aroma. Maybe not as complex as a quad should be, but still very full. I would buy this again!"
"D - Pretty drinkable. The amount of alcohol in there beer is not too high, but is quite present in the nose and taste. Otherwise, the flavors are nice and rich."
"I liked this beer very much, overall; although it is quad-style, don't expect it to try to reach the quad prototype; quaddish is probably a better name, and you'll enjoy it all the more."
"O: A pretty unbalanced and decidedly American take on a Belgian Quad, Harpoon's Leviathan is a rich, fruity malt bomb with uncontrolled alcohol and somewhat poorly integrated hops. The near 12% ABV is not well-masked, leaving the majority of your brew feeling like a glass of liquor rather than a beer."
"Mouthfeel is ok but again far from great. It has a nice dry finish but the sweet lasts too long and doesn't really compliment the other flavors in the finish. The carbonation is nice and sharp but the beer overall is syrupy and just not great. A poor attempt at a quad and close to undrinkable."
"O: This is too simple; American versions all seem to be similar to this; strong dark fruits, a lack of complexity and carbonation, but well-hidden alcohol. I'm still searching for a decent American-made Quad."
"Quad is second only to the amazing Imperial Red Ale when it comes to my most favored members of the Leviathan series. There might be better American quadrupels out there, but there aren't many. If this isn't a year-round (or seasonal) release, it sure as hell should be."
"A bit too boozy and unbalanced, with a disappointing body and appearance and a high price tag to boot, this is one of those examples of an American craft brewery's mostly failed attempt at recreating a Belgian specialty. Though not undrinkable, this is a passable effort and one of the weaker points in the Leviathan series."
"Overall, this is one of the better offerings in the Harpoon Leviathan line. A very solid American quadrupel."
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color, with a small light tan head. In the aroma, fruity and a hint of licorice. In the taste. dark fruit, raisin, fig, plum and a alcohol note. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry licorice like aftertaste. Not a boozy as expected, big and nice."
"O - This is a huge chewy beer. One 12 oz. bottle could easily be split between two serving. I have a feeling that a fresh tasting would not even compare to a vintage tasting. I imagine that the strong alcohol aroma, flavors and warmth will mellow over time letting all these earthy fruity aromas and flavors come to the foreground."
"O: Okay quad, although the flavor is a little on the harsh side right now. This might go away with some extended aging though, so I'll put a couple away."
"There are several Leviathan beers that I really enjoy. This is not one of them. Not something I would recommend."
"Warm and a bit chewy full bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a plenty drinkable quad but it doesn't quite stand up with the best of them."
"Thanks again neorunner!"
"Not as fine tuned as the original Quads, alcohol seems to cloud the palate and there is some loss of depth. Aside from that this would do well with some age."
"D - It's not a bad beer, and the only thing I really dislike is the lingering cough medicine finish on the palate. Other than that I could and probably will drink a few of them."
"D: just not super impressed by this one. it's big and boozy more than big and complex. a decent attempt at the style, but not really worth seeking out."
"from a belgian style glass. This is a decent version of a Quad. Nose is dominated by citrus fruitiness, phenols and alcohol. Coriander and belgian yeast and sugars round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is moderate, with substantial carbonation. i enjoyed this quite a bit and will look for it again"
"Still, the flavor is good, but it could use a bit more balance. This is just a bit too sweet and the lack of carbonation doesn't help that at all. I would say the overall B rating is pretty accurate."
"D: On the whole, this is decent beer, though not at exactly the quadrupel I've ever had. Drinkable, though."
"D- I drank it to help me sleep, which helped, but I won't help myself to more of this. Sure some age may tame this beast in terms of alcohol, but I don't see it tasting any better."
"For a Quad, it's definitely hoppy but in the Leviathan Series, this one doesn't work so well for me. It's a booze bomb and so far to date, it's the biggest beer in the series coming out of Harpoon. The Imperial IPA remains my most favorite in the series and a regular resident in my beer fridge whenever I can find it."
"D: The flavor itself is simply more aggressive, strong and powerful than it is balanced, complex or centered. Not one of my favorite Harpoons."
"The taste continues the dark fruits and alcohol medley, with the heat hitting both sides of the front palate. But despite all the booze in your mouth it still manages a light, smooth mouthfeel. This is a very approachable quad that wil sit you on your ass if you're not careful with it."
"Overall an OK quad, has a good nose, ok taste and a poor mouthfeel and drinkability. Not even close to the Belgians."
"D: Definite sipper. The spicy, earthy finish is rather cloying."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. okay drinkability; holds its own as an american-made quad, just don't compare it too the likes of rochefort, bernardus, or westvleteren."
"A solid quad. Big on banana flavor, with dark fruits further behind. The alcohol does not attempt to disguise itself here - it's a sipper, and a tasty one at that. If I could give it a 4.25 for taste I would, but there wasn't quite enough there for me to give it a 4.5. Still it was a memorable quad and I could see myself putting one in the cellar for a while."
"Cheers!"
"D: This beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its strength. The alcohol makes itself evident in the taste, but doesn't detract from the drinkability."
"D-This is very drinkable. the candied sugar is present but not overwhelming. The alcohol is noticeable but does not detract. Very smooth."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours dark brown/ruby color, with a light tan head. Lightly spiced caramel and dark fruit nose, the high alcohol is almost noticeable. Yeasty and sweet caramel malt flavor with dark fruits, the alcohol is not as noticeable in the flavor. Smooth, creamy and rich body, I think this is a somewhat underrated beer."
"Overall- Not bad, but feels more like a boozy barleywine than it does a quad. Slight oxidation flavors/aromas and astringency take away from the brew just a little bit. Lacks Belgian character and is screaming with booze (definitely hinders drinkability)! Its worth a try, but nothing to get too steamed up about. I would suggest sitting on this brew for quite some time to let the booze mellow, but it may be prone to oxidation which is a bit of a bummer..."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown color with a tiny bit of a purplish hue. Off white head with some nice lacing as it makes its way down. Really nice lacing. The nose is dark fruits with plum, fig, dates, and a tiny touch of light caramel. A nice yeasty character throughout. Taste isn't quite as complex and the tastes blend together for some moderate malt and a dark-fruit presence. Feel is really nice and creamy with a touch of booze. A really nice American take on this brew."
"Drinkability: Quite good, but only a little bit better than moderate due to the massive heat -- I really feel this would be a good one to let sit for a couple of years and I would like to see how it is then. Very nice flavors though and I feel that it's a fair representation of the style."
"Pours a transluscent chestnut with a thin head. Smells quite fruity with typical Belgian yeast notes. Tastes like a textbook quad with dark fruit, Belgian yeast notes, and rich malt. Decent mouthfeel, but a bit hot. Everything is done right here, yet still, something is lacking to elevate this to superlative. perhaps its that it isn't perfectly integrated, or lacks some of the esters that unleash some particularly interesting fruit notes, but although it is pleasant enough enough, its just lacks that ""moreness""."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"I had a twelve ounce draft of this at the Amsterdam ale house in manhattan. I think this is the last leviathan draft that I hadn't had. It was very good and a very god example of the style. The bartender wasn't sure if it was the imperial red or the quad a d there was no question after I one sniff and a sip. Dark brown color, great Belgian aroma and amazing sweetness combined with alcohol. Very good!"
"I'm not exactly sure what to make of this as the alcohol is really in-your-face and there is tartness coming out that doesn't seem quite right. An interesting but not overly tasty quad."
"This does not meet those beers. Not even close."
"D- This beer, although I could only have 2 and be done, turned out to be a good beer after all said and done. I would suggest looking for this if you can. Not the greatest of true to style beers but this was a tasty treat that cellaring did some justice to."
"Pours a deep dark red with about an inch of eggshell head. There is an absolute ton of yeastie beasties floating around. I feel that there is way too much sediment floating around in my glass, even if it is an unfiltered beer. The head dissapates quickly, but leaves a ton of lacing atound the edge of the glass. The aroma is extremely sweet malt. eviathan Quad is extremely thick and malty with a very sweet beginning and an ending that has more than a hint of boozey warmth. Not quite as complicated a taste as a Bernardus or any of the great Quads, it's more of a simple type of sweetness similar to Troeggs Mad Elf. This just feels like the high abv beer that it is. This makes it a little harder to drink, especially the way the sweetness coats the tongue and contributes to a sweet aftertaste. Finally, the sediment floating around actually makes the odd taste chewy and for me that is a problem."
"Harpoon continues to disappoint a little with this Leviathan series. I'm still waiting to be blown away by one of these beers. Quad is okay, but could use a bit of work. The nose is a bit weak, it's warm and boozy, and lacks a strong Belgian yeast presence. Despite those shortcomings, it still manages to be an okay beer. One that's definitely worth a try. If the opportunity is available, grab a single bottle and skip the 4-pack."
"Not the best quad ever, but a pretty good representation. The alcohol is a little bit too prominent for my liking - even at 12%. A little bit over-carbonated, which takes away from it a little bit."
"This beer has some tough competition within its style; when I think Quad I think of some of my favourite all-time beers, most of which are permanently on stand-by in my cellar. That being said, all comparisons aside, this is simply not a good beer. Unless they find a way to scale back the alcohol and diversify the flavour this is just not worth drinking. Period."
"I am still pretty new to quads. Not sure if this is the best of the best but still a intresting brew."
"D- Very, very drinkable for this style. At 11.75% ABV the alcohol is very smooth on the palate. Also a nice dryness to the brew. Perhaps slightly overhopped.... Overall a fine brew from Harpoon!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, not the best Quad that I've had but it's a decent strong Belgian-style beer to drink for a while."
"Had I more time I would have just ordered a full pint and I really should have."
"Drinkability: A few of these could finish your night rather quickly. I was pleasantly surprised with the tastiness of this beer. I would certainly grab this one again."
"Dangerously easy to drink, but the presence of alcohol in this Rodenbach Snifter, is plenty of warning. Paired with a cigar, strong flavored food, or hearty conversation, bring it all together, and enjoy."
"Full article: http://timdudley.net/beer/?p=99"
"Is it comperable to a great Belgian Quad? No. But for $10 a four pack (who can stomach a 22oz quad anyway?) its pretty alright."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
"Purchased at the Whole Foods on Houston in Manhattan on a visit to see my sister. Thanks to my girlfriend for stowing this bottle, along with a few others, in her luggage for the flight home."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again but just another because of the high alcohol in this."
"D: alcohol is a bit too much, I'd like to try it in five years"
"Wow. taste is very boozy as well. Raisins, vanilla, sweet fruits, very complex, slightly syrupy so you could age this for a few years without issue. A lot going on here. I like it but it's a bit too much to drink too often. I'd go for their IIPA or Imperial Pilsner over this."
"A good big beer, I could have one or two easy at a time, maybe three in the winter"
"Pours a really nice cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, banannas, figs, grapes, plums, raisins notes. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, with some bananna and dark fruits. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"This one is definitely a sipper. I only scored it a 3.0 on drink, not because the high abv, but because the boozy sweetness was a little too much for me."
"Notes: I don´t know if this fits style,.. And I´m sensing and understanding that it may not so much while remaining a good attempt. Thinking that it leans too heavily to some barley wine versions may not be such a good thing...? I just had an early forum on this lesson for me. Still it is a sturdy complex and nice drink, quad or not. Maybe a touch too much on the sugary side, which to some extent might be a quad identifier, but again maybe not so well resolved. I like it quite a bit though."
"Poured out a clear deep copper/brown (SRM17) with a thin tannish head supported by moderate carbonation. Slight legs on glass. Bubblegum/spice aroma followed my moderate malt. Big malt flavor on the toffee/caramel side with a spicy/bubblegum flavor. Warmth from alcohol very evident. A thick almost cloying maltiness with low levels of stone fruit as the sample warms."
"Overall, I like what Harpoon is doing with the whole Leviathan series, it has got me to start buying it again. This probably wasn't my favorite of the series, but I am still trying out the whole Belgian style at this point. Give it a chance to see what you think."
"Damn tasty brew, but only if you don't mind the booze. I don't mind, it sipped nicely this cool August day, although the cheeks are glowing fire red after finishing this bad boy."
"D - Too sweet and boozy to enjoy."
"Cloudy, hazy red with a decent head of tan foam. Rich, yeasty, fruity aromas with vanilla, apple and dark fruit. Also some bread, light toffee, mango and pineapple. Flavour is rich and bitter. Lots of malt, fruit and solventy alcohol. A bit too heavy for my taste. Lots of Belgian spiciness and a hefty caramel and malty complexity. Could use some mellowing with age maybe, but atm too over the top. Thick body and moderate carbonation."
"D- Definitely a sipper. There are a lot of quads out there that I prefer over this one."
"Potent alcohol warmth. Lots of malt but relatively thin body; average carbonation. The aftertaste reminds me of brandy. Low level of hop--just enough to prevent the brew from being an overly sweet offering."
"A sipper at best. Now I know, but would not buy again knowing there are so many high abv, but excellent tasting brews."
"Can't have more than one- actually shared this with my buddy."
"Off the tap at the brewing co this beer was a copper/amber color. The khaki colored, two-finger head displayed excellent retention and lacing in semi-sticky bands. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, candy sugar, caramel and toffee, floral hops and a touch of alcohol heat. The flavors were spot-on for the style, but not as yeast dominated as a true Belgian. At first candy sugar and caramel came forward followed by alcohol heat in the middle, wood, Belgian yeast and an herbal, bitter finish. It had a nice flavor arc of malt to yeast to hops with all the elements well-defined. The mouthfeel was soft, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. Well worth tracking down and another success in this series."
" This is a pretty darn good quad, I does not have as much going on with it as some others but what it does have is very good. I would not mind getting more of this beer."
"It is sweet/malty and boozy - a bit harsh/astringent. It's a ""big"" attempt at a quad, that doesn't really impress me. Doesn't have the complexities I was hoping for, and the aftertaste doesn't ""thrill"" me. It's a slow sipper..."
"Certainly one to savor over an hour plus.. Not to shabby of a Quad from the folks at Harpoon. Better than expected."
"Purchased a single of this at Liquor Depot in Avon, CT. The color was a very deep amber. The aroma was very sweet and fruity. You smell the belgian yeast. The mouthfeel was very thick and there was a fruity plum taste from the first sip. There was a buttery feel of alcohol on the lips which provided a good amount of alcohol warmth in the finish. Even though Belgian is not one of my favorite styles, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a nice dark purple/red with tons of head and moderate lacing. Smell is very yeasty and banana like. Taste is almost way too much to describe. You get hit instantly with this nice rich flavor, but also a pretty big accompanying alcohol kick. Very smooth in the mouth though.. get a nice mix of dark fruits in there, maybe some raisin or date flavors. Nice body and mouthfeel to it, although the alcohol presence is quite prevalent and this may not be for everyone. After a long day of work though, this works out perfect for me. I liked this beer.. I don't have much to compare it to but it was different and a great nightcap."
"Overall, not a bad attempt at a quad, just not my first option. Don't think I'll go back to this one too soon."
"Not the best. Tastes way too medicinal and leaves an almost dirt like aftertaste. It does taste a little better as it goes, but still nothing to change the way you think about Belgian Quads. Not recommended unless you really love Belgian ales and want to try something different."
"D: Reminiscent of St. Bernardus and pretty close to being quite delicious, however, the overcarbonation and over-the-top alcohol make this one pretty difficult to drink for me right now. Needs some time."
"D: Better early, when it's cold and before the booze shows up in the nose and on the palate. Then, it's slow-going. . . ."
"Pours a five finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Slight caramel nose. Flavor is caramel, smooth almost syrupy. High ABV is hidden. $10.19 for a 4-pak of 12oz bottles from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"I like this style. Pours dark, with quickly dissipitating white head. Rich smelling, maltish more than yeast. A tad above average mouthfeel, very drinkable, rich. Booziness is covered up, until too late. Caramel, decent demonstration of style. A little Dark fruit."
"D- I think this is a pretty solid American interpretation of the style and a tasty beer either way."
"Drinkability overall is good for the style I've had much worse from American brewers and I must say this is one of the best on the market in some time. A beefy beer that will get you through many mid summer nights or hold to a couple until this coming winter rolls around and light a nice cigar and enjoy the combo."
"I'm going to buy a four pack for the cellar and see how this is with a little age on it."
"I'm thinking this might need about 6 months to mellow out and it'll be much more drinkable."
"Solid complex brew."
"Wow I'm really enjoying this one! Pours a hazy mahogany tinted dark amber color with an absolutely huge stiff light tan head that decomposes slowly like an ice cream float. Sheets of lacing...wow, i'm really surprised. The smell is really good...classic earthy Belgian yeast, notes of figs over lighter harvest fruits. The mouth feel is tangy from the alcohol, lightly carbonated and full bodied. Full flavored, and complex...there is a strong earthy taste, pears and apples carried over nicely from the nose and a great spicy character over a caramel-like sweetness. It has a nice warming creamy smooth drinkability. This one is scoring BIG points for imagination and complexity. Highly recommended. Its interesting that previous reviews are using words of praise yet the scores aren't there...i don't understand. If it kicks your a$$ you must ACQUIT... : ) Peace...Go Team Harpoon!!"
"Overall, this is good...a knock out of a beer. One of these and I'm feeling pretty good. There is a lot of flavor here...but one of these will be enough. I feel like with some time this beer wil really stand out."
"An excellent example of the style. I can't wait to try this again, in a year or more. I think it will only get better."
"D: Very drinkable, but certainly not a session beer. I like these 1 at a time, thank you."
"D: Not too hard to drink but it also doesn't keep me wanting more somehow."
"D: This one is a bit rough at times. Its got a lot of alcohol to it and I believe this really needs some time to mellow out. Maybe a year or two. Right now it is a bit too hot. Its a bit rough getting through, but I can see where Harpoon is going with this and it will probably quite good with some time. At this point in time, not so much. Its a booze bomb with some malt and light Belgian qualities. Not bad, but not quite there."
"a couple months has done this beer well.way more mellow in terms of phenolic flavors,highly drinkable for a beer that is 12% an a full bodied mouthfeel."
"Overall very enjoyable and well made. Will definitely seek it out again. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a goblet, this beer was a hazy red/brown color with a small tan head. It had a sweet fruity aroma, and was also a on the peppery side. The fruit came through more in the taste, with the pepper aroma loosing out. The beer was rich and yeasty. Alcohol was hidden at first, but quickly asserted itself. Be careful with this beer."
"Pours a deep, deep reddish-amber color with very foamy light tan head. Smells very belgian-y; wheat, cloves, spice, peppery, fruity (grapes and bananas).. Tastes fruity and spicey. Noot too black pepper-like as some stronger belgian styles do. Yeasty, clove, a bit whiskey-like. Quite sweet with a warm boozey finish. Mouth is fairly moderate, a good medium carbonation level. A bit of spice in the mouth and a bit syrupy as well. Its definitely, but becomes a bit difficult to get down with the sweetness opening up as you go.."
"D: World class quads are a perfect marriage of the complexities of sweet and spicy dark fruit, fruity yeast, and high abv. This has the makings of a fine quad that had a shit-ton of raw alcohol dumped on it. Meh."
"pours a brown/dark amber/red with a thick head that fades after a minute and good lacing. can smell the alcohol right off the bat- malty with various fruits. fairly sweet, good balance between the hops and fruit, fruity taste becomes more prevalent in the pellet after taking down with alcohol lingering from the throat to the tongue- pretty hard to miss. wholesome body- pretty thick, almost creamy. great one from harpoon, needs to slow down on the alcohol- a bit too pungent for me, but a must try none the less."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the cloudy burnished copper brew. Head recedes slowly, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet and spiced. Taste starts sweet, yeast spicing in the middle, hops peek out next, and then the close finds acohol turning on the burn. Mouthfeel is smooth until it gets too hot at the swallow, and drinkability is somewhat limited by same. Dial the abv back a touch, and we'd have something here."
"The beer pours a dark red/brown color with a thin offwhite head that fades to almost nothing. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of dark fruits and raisins. The alcohol is well pronounced. The taste is decent as well. It has an alcohol ridden taste that's ripe with raisiny flavors, and crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average quad, but it's lacking complexity. I applaud Harpoon for the the effort. I hope they continue to produce these kinds of beers."
"I like the way this beer drinks. I have 4 bottles left that I am going to keep for a few months, hopefully longer, to see how this brew develops."
"this is definately a sipper of a beer. prolly wouldnt want more than one of these in a night. the high amount of the solvent alcohol taste is the only thing that really prevents this from being a really great beer, still good nontheless. not for beginners. put 2 away in the cellar, hopefully after a year or 2 the alcohol will become less harsh."
"Final Thoughts - I seem to be one of the few on this site, but I am really loving this beer. Great sipping beer that provides a largely complex blend of various flavors that are harmonious rather than clashing. Leviathan is a great addition to Harpoon and I really hope they expand and keep it going."
"I really wanted to like this beer, but this just ruins it. Not much better than mediocre."
"I feel obligated to note here that I am rating this beer a little more ""on style"" than I normally would, because the Belgian Quad is one of my favorite styles. This beer and all the American attempts at Belgians that I have had before it makes me wonder if there should be a new category for American Quad and perhaps even American Tripel. Although some come closer than others (this being solidly in the ""others"" category), we clearly can't get the Belgians quite right."
"D - A bit rough and not very drinkable. The aroma is pretty nice but the yeast character in the flavor is out of control and the alcohol is really hot and unpleasant. The solventy off flavors really hurt the overall impression."
"Not a bad example of the style. Drinkable. Alcohol is present but it's not overwhelming to me."
"Pours a lightly chunky, but mostly clear dark reddish brown, big and thick light tan head forms, slowly settles down to a medium sized ring and thin layer around the glass, a few spots of lace stick around, looks alright. Smell is wacky but pretty awesome, tons of banana like esters, some biscuity malt and candi sweetness, sherry, tons of fruit, some strawberry, cherries and pineapple, guava, more banana, alcohol is well hidden, pretty crazy stuff. Taste is really sweet, very sugary, more banana, lots of fruity, light bit of biscuity malt in the middle, big alcohol, sherry, fusely, kind of earthy, brown sugar in the finish, very sweet. Mouthfeel is not good, especially for a quad. Way too thick and syrupy, lowish carbonation, like drinking a sugar solution. Does burn a touch on the way down but otherwise alcohol is hidden decently. Some good and some bad about this one, back to the drawing board for them."
"D: I liked it. Yes it is boozy but it is a fresh Quad. The thing about American quads is they are almost all like this. It is part of the flavor. Saying a quad is boozy is like saying you don't like Chocolate and then reviewing Choklat. If you want a smooth quad go to Belgium. This is a good American quad."
"Served - 12oz bottle into a snifter"
"1116"
"Drinkability: The big, noticeable, 11.75 ABV hampers drinkability in my opinion, and makes this one a sipper. This brew will definitely bite back. Doesn't seem real true to the style, but I give Harpoon credit for such a bold release."
"I was surprised to see this on tap last night at the Sports Depot (of all places) in Allston last night, so I ordered one. Was served in a Leviathan 10 oz glass. Dark ruby red color. Nice white head that lasted a while. Good amount of lacing. Smell was a bit on the strong side, very boozy. Very grape-like smell. Taste was fairly nice, but a bit overly sweet. Caramel and grape jelly flavors dominate. On the downside, the alcohol profile is very hot. Noticeable burning feeling on the palate. Sad to say, but this beer was a bit of a burden to drink. Way too much flavor and alcohol. Needs to be toned way down. In bottle form, some aging might do some good. I can see why it's only served in 10 oz pours. This is my first taste of the Leviathan series, and it certainly is an extreme beer. A little too extreme, in my opinion."
"In both the taste and nose, the alcohol knocks consistently, letting you know its lurking, before it finally just completely kicks in the door and unleashes itself, not unpleasantly."
"Decent, but I prefer their Leviathan IPA more."
"A full-flavored brew that pushes the flavor envelope just a little too much in multiple areas: sweetness, alcohol, and spice. Best to probably lay this one down for a few years to see if the flavors can relax a bit."
"Thanks to ppoitras for this extra."
"Mouthfeel medium heavy bodied with strong carbonation."
"A little disappointed with this probably just because the Baltic Porter and Imperial IPA were quite awesome."
"Overall, another brew from teh Leviathan series that I enjoyed trying. Worth the investment."
"A: 3.5 S: 4.5 T: 4 M: 3.5 D: 3"
"Tempered sweetness throughout, most prominent up front. Quickly has a spicy twist to it that opens up a huge raisiny sour bitterness. Towards the end, a decent hoppy kick (for something like this) comes in, and the bitternesses mingle into something leaving almost an acrid trail down my throat, yet it's all slightly sweet. Not at all what I was expecting. Complex in a different way than I was expecting. Definitely not a normal-style quad. I'm really torn. I hate the bitterness, but somehow it all seems OK at the end. Still not my favorite flavor, though. Mouthfeel is bold, exciting, different. Drinkability suffers bigtime between the high ABV and the sour kicks. The alcohol doesn't really burn a lot, but it is very evident in the finish. For me, this is nice to try, but I think that's all it will be."
"This beer poured a dark amber red. Nice size head. First smell is alcohol and a candied sweetness. The taste follows this, very candy fruit taste, almost too sweet. There is definately that alchohol feel that lingers in the mouth. But its a very warming feeling, you don't need to have more than two of these at a time. Overall I think I prefer the Sam Adams Imperial White to this Harpoon offering. The Harpoon is a little too sweet."
"So far I have not been impressed by the Leviathan series brews from Harpoon. Alas, a Quad sounded really good to me tonight, and this one I haven't tried, so might as well go ahead. Pour yields a really beautifully colored beer, has a rosewood color, with a pillowy white head. Booze and stone fruits are the first thing that came to mind when I smelled. I suppose the alcohol is to be expected though with a beer this size. At the beginning there was a really strange smell in there, but that has since faded, so I guess I can disregard that. As it has warmed some honey and nectar smells have come through. Alcohol is more subdued in the taste, leaning more towards the dark fruit aspects of this beer. Toward the end of each sip however, some alcohol bitterness does manage to appear. Luckily it does not linger on the palate for too long. Decent enough heavy bodied mouthfeel on this one. Drinkability is not bad, as it definitely does not seem as rough as the other two Leviathans. Overall a pretty good effort from Harpoon. I would not go out of my way to seek out a four pack, but a single is a good enough buy in my book. Cheers"
"I have been a big fan of the Leviathan series. This is definitely another winner and I'm thoroughly enjoying the whole series so far."
"Overall - another solid beer from the Leviathan series by Harpoon. I will say that the DIPA was probably our favorite so far, but this is worth picking up and giving a try."
