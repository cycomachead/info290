"Some dark raisin & alcohol smells, you get some of that latent alcohol taste mixed in with the bready malt and dark fruit / raisin."

"Pours a cloudy deep gold with amazingly fizzy head and nice lacing. Aroma is of ripened fruit and bready malt. Taste is sweet malt, with hints of raisin and dark fruits. Some yeasty notes here also. Mouthfeel is mild and pleasant. 10% ABV is very well hidden !!"
"Pours out a hazy leathery brown with a thin head.  Smells fruity with spicy Belgian yeast - caramel malts.  Taste: caramel malt base and spicy yeast.  Umami savory yeastiness.  Dried fruits and berries.  Finishes dry.  Moderate weight on the tongue with active prickly carbonation.  Delicious."

"4.32/5: Christmas in March, mofos!"

"Pours brown with sizable stick head. Great nose. Tons of fruity esters. Good full mouth feel and not particularly hot for a 10% brew. Big malt, spice, complex flavor profile. Very enjoyable. Glad I got 2."
""
""
""
"Brown/ruby pour with khaki head (12oz draft into snifter); fruit, cloves, cinnamon, and banana notes; sweet malt with stone fruit with  banana and clove from the yeast; medium feel and good tongue coating; overall, complex -a lot of flavor and alcohol-a good way to end the drinking day!"

"this is a great quad. nice body."

"Overall / Drinkability:  I personally felt the alcohol was well hidden for a quad, but I could notice it in a pleasant way about 2/3 through the glass.  Full of flavor, well worth savoring as a sipper, and a big bottle is the best way to enjoy this beer to get a nice serving of the beer.  It went well with food (Doro Wat) and I think it would pair well with a wide range of food.  While I was not able to have this at Christmas, I think I'm going to have to pick it up again next year and see if I can make it a Christmas day beer.  A very good Quad and a very good beer."

"Vertical of 2010-2013 shared by raveskdr. Thanks Chris! Copper brown body with a broken beige head. Aromas of Belgian yeast, caramel malt, well water, mineral, raisins. Smooth flavor, showing some signs of age (’10, ’11). Medium bodied with soft carbonation on all vintages, with the most recent perhaps a bit more vibrant. Lots of flavor. Slightly sweet, with subtle spice and a touch of brown sugar. Tasty."
"Overall: incredible brew which took me by surprise. Mellow and strong, has pretty much everything you are looking for in a beer."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Delicious. smooth quad.  Would love to drink this again!"
""
""
"Cloudy brown with thin head, nice spice aromas; this is definitely a slow drinking beer, not one to consume in multiples, the 10% ABV is there, but somewhat masked with a nice taste; decent mouthfeel; this is one I would go back to, but not buy in large quantities unless you were serving to people that could appreciate this style."
"Overall - Mmmm. Really, really good. Perhaps my favorite quad yet, in part to the fact that it doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna develop diabetes from drinking it, as most are too sugary and syrupy for my liking. This one is up my alley, though. Nice, smooth delivery of a complex yet refined dark, fruity and bready profile."

"I got banana bread like overtones on this one. I feel like it offers a bit more than the abt 12, but without the big bite of the 12."
"Drank for the first time this past Christmas season and I now babe a new favorite Christmas beer.  Perfectly balanced and with a high abv I would have never guessed it to be so smooth.  The Abby ales are rising to the top of my favorites list."
"Overall: A great beer and one I'll definitely buy again. A good way to usher in the new year! Would highly recommend."
"A pretty fun take on the base beer with Christmas fruit cake spices throughout. Along with the dark sweet fruits is a general tone of caramelized banana. A decent mouthfeel with good carbonation to move the beer around."

"Overall, a very good beer, but I definitely prefer Abt 12. I generally avoid winter warmers and holiday-spiced beers, but this one is very well done. The spices are not overwhelming or unbalancing, but to me they still detract from the sweet, rich flavor characteristic of the style. I doubt I will try this again, but it's not because I didn't like it. Anyone who enjoys holiday beers should check this one out (and definitely try De Dolle Stille Nacht while you're at it)."

"O-Setting aside my quibbles with the mouthfeel, this is a great holiday offering. It doesn't rank as high as the Abt 12 because even I found it a bit too sweet and spicy, but if you want a big, dark, holiday offering, there are not many choices better than this."

"Picked up a bomber for a Christmas Celebration.  Poured a dark ruby red with a small white fluffy head.  I picked up what I thought to be malts in the nose along with spices, dark fruits, and floral notes.  Taste was off for me at first.  I did not detect the spice(s) in the taste as I did in the nose.  I definitely tasted what I thought to be fruits and some sort of for lack of a better work floral taste(s).  I am glad I was sharing a bomber because I would not have been able to drink this by myself.   The alcohol was well hidden.  I am new to quads but I would purchase again."
"This is a good seasonal beer. However, I thought it was a little too sweet and carbonated for my liking. I think next time I could split it with somebody because it is too rich to drink the whole bomber by myself."
""
""
""
""
"Great seasonal, Very smooth, well hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -  What a treat. Great Christmas beer, but I can obviously see this bee delicious at any time, especially in winter. Similar to ABT12, there are resemblances, but this is it's own beer through in through with the butterscotch being the star."
""
""
"OVERALL – Very nice Christmas Beer!  With two bottles of this tonight, at 10% ABV it most certainly is ""...the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"""
""
""
"Overall: This beer tastes like it comes from an older time and i can respect that. I wouldn't drink it all the time but it was a nice experience and change of pace."
"Went great with Brie and St. Joseph's Abbey (Spencer) Damson Plum Jam.  Champagne like carb, refreshing, great."
"A really nice winter quad that I would really look forward to making a Christmas tradition, this brewery continues to do great beers."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown mahogany with ruby highlights in the correct light.  Strong carbonation maintains a thin head and accentuates a nice feel. The flavor is breadier than I expected, almost marzen like, but obviously with greater potency.  Slightly spicy character, but more related to the yeast than actual spice additions.  Quite dry finish, with barely a hint of alcohol.  Lovely beer."

"Overall: Delicious, with a perfect blend of fruit, malts, and spiciness. This tastes how a Christmas ale should in my opinion. Consumed on Christmas day, 2014."
""
""
"O - I always heard good things and I was certainly not disappointed. Definitely a go-to Christmas from now on."
""
"Overall, this is a great Christmas Ale.  It is not as rich and spiced as many Christmas Ales and you need to be in the mood for an extremely sweet Belgian Ale, but if you are, then this is an amazing beer."
"O: Really, really like this beer, perhaps more than ABT 12, maybe my favorite quad.  It's become a Christmas tradition."
"More classic in taste in style.  Clear malt, strong yeast qualities, darker fruits.   Clear shot of alcohol in the gut.  Richness.  Nicely drying on the finish.  Huge effervescence in feel."
"Slightly hoppy.  Fruity with a slight over carbonation."
"Deep brownish mohagany color with a thick tan head and some spotty lacing.  Aromas of sweet bread, alcohol soaked dark fruit, fruit cake, spice, burnt caramel and toffee.  I could keep going with descriptors because it's a deeply enticing brew.  Taste is of alcohol soaked dark fruit, sweet bread, cherry, spice, pear, burnt caramel and toffee.  Great creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry.  Light medium body and scary drinkability for a beer with 10% alcohol.  This is a great Christmas beer with a seemingly endless flavor profile."

"On tap at McNellie's OKC. Pours a reddish brown with a fantastically creamy head that hangs around for a long time. Thick, substantial lacing on the glass. It's a bit cold, and I imagine the temperature is keeping the aroma subdued. There's some breadiness and a bit of spice. Lots of dark fruit and spices on the tongue, much like a fruitcake. Sweet toffee on the end, but not a huge aftertaste. It's very creamy, but not overly thick. This is one of the better Christmas beers that I've tried, and I'll certainly choose this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is an excellent beer, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The higher alcohol content would prevent me from having it often but it's great to have on a special occasion like Christmas.  This beer would most certainly appeal to anyone who enjoys the Belgian Quad style."
""
""
"O:  dangerous beer here -- perhaps the lightest, easiest drinking quad I've run across so far in limited experience with the style; it's got plenty of dark-fruit notes, even as dark as raisins, but it's still very accessible and sweet"

"Pours dark reddish-brown, with a nice one finger of light foam that receded pretty quickly, very light lacing. The aroma is heavy of dark fruits and sweet malt, with a very light nutmeg or allspice note. The taste is very nice, with sweet malt, figs, plums, raisins, nutmeg and a touch of vanilla blending superbly - not one overpowers any of the others. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, very smooth, with just a touch of alcohol burn. I think this one would really benefit from a bit of aging. Overall this is a very tasty beer, fits perfectly for the season."

"I can't remember exactly what this tasted like.  That's the problem w/ having a Christmas beer party... there's so many good ones but they all blur.  I think I slightly prefer Scaldis Noel"
"i like it, not too sweet and a nice spice finish cheers!"
"This is excellent stuff as I would expect from this brewery. Why have I never tasted it before? I have three more bottles to cellar and I expect them to improve. Hopefully after a year or so the spices will integrate a bit, and as they fade after more years I hope to see some development of the dark fruit, leather, tobacco favors that can show up in the great quads as they age. Maybe the spices will be able to last till then too, time will tell."

"This was good. Very nutmegy and peppery. Very warming with the alcohol and cinnamon. Mild hops, fairly high carbonation, medium body."
""
""
""
""
""

"I deeply enjoy  the ABT12, however I just purchased  a few 11.2 oz bottles of this Christmas Ale. For me this is nearly the best ale I have tried. I prefer a sweeter ale with less hops and this is it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am rather underwhelmed by this beer, especially from St. Bernardus. The Abt 12 is spectacular, but this does not disguise the alcohol content half as well - instead, it disguises the  underlying yeast flavors with alcohol and spice. I wouldn't say it is a bad beer, but I would not go out of my way to have it again. Perhaps if I were to encounter it on tap somewhere for a decent price per pour."
"Outstanding"

"Corked and caged 750 ml bottle shared with Dad. Pours dark reddish brown, some purple color, creamy one finger white to off white head. Aroma has much more fruit character than the 12, with lots of sweet cherry notes, caramel malts, funky Belgian yeast of course, and candi sugar. Much more muted hop notes here than the 12 as well. Flavor follows the smell closely with big sweet fruit flavors--tastes like the added cherries to this one, but can’t find info on fruit additions--light spice, candi sugar and sweet malts. Very smooth and pleasant. Sweet but not cloying. Medium carbonation and plus body. This was really nice."

"Full great flavor, nice head"
""
""
""
"Overall – You have to be in the mood for a beer like this.  Perhaps October is a little early for a christmas tasting brew.  Regardless, as far as Xmas beers though, this one is solid.  It's got a fruit cake like flavour and the ABV is very well hidden"
"Decent Beer I would not go out of my way to buy it though."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Very nice.  High carb actually makes this super drinkable for what it is, and the peppery spice with a year of age on it melds beautifully with the beer."
""
""
""
"Very sweet smell. Kind of like bubble gum. Nice shiny brown pour. Awesome taste. Sweet, malty, caramel, and bananas. Very fine beer."

"O: Excellent brew.  Got online in Thailand, drank for the second time January 5th, 2015.  Drank first at Turkey Creek, NC two summers ago.  I went to the brewery near Watou last Christmas, and they had none left.  I asked the head brewer to be sure to send more brews, particularly this one, to China.  Was glad to have at least found it in Thailand."
"O: More like an ABT 12 than St. Bernardus Prior 8. Better than the Prior 8 and, if not for the aroma, it would be better than the ABT 12 too. Despite the Xmas theme, quite enjoyable in the summer. Highly recommended."
""

"O-St. Bernardus does no wrong. This Christmas Ale ages perfectly, you can sip one in the summer. This quad was meant to be sipped. So complex and boozy. I do wish the body was more grand and creamy, silky. Other than that, you can't get much better in look, smell and taste. Quads are probably the best beer style on Earth. St. Bernardus Christmas Ale is powerful proof for that claim."

"Quite a dangerous beer, very tasty and balanced, one might finish the 0.75 l bottle without even noticing. Christmas ale indeed."
"Overall a great winter brew, well balanced, crisp and enjoyable after every sip."
" The Belgians know how to brew. If you can get your hands on this, I recommend it"

"750ml bottle: This one pours a very cloudy mahogany brown color. There was almost no head on it, and left no lacing. Nice nose! Christmas spices, caramel malt, faint dark fruits, some breadiness and Belgian yeast notes. The taste is very good. Rich malts, not too much sweetness, dark fruits, yeasty and bready, Christmas spices. Definitely a keeper! Has this on tap at Monks also and was equally good as the bottled version!"
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of high intensity, resulting in a somewhat fizzy, calming to foamy and smooth mouthfeel. The mouthfeel fits the expected idea for a Belgian trappist, though I think it's a bit overly aggressive and rough for such a huge beer. Ethanol present as slight heat in nostrils and mild burn on the back of the throat. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness lingering on the palate."
"O-Overall a great Christmas Ale, my new favorite."
""
""
""
"Overall: Dangerously sessionable for a 10% ABV. Very enjoyable. I'd love to age a couple of these in the basement."
""
"I knew this would be the clear winner of the tasting as soon as I took a sip of it - it may not have the yeasty prowess of other quads we tasted, nor as much of a robust malt profile, but it certainly wins in its ever unique profile and versatility for the pure and simple purpose of consumption. I'd love to buy a case of this and see how it evolves over the course of 12 years, but every vintage is different, it seems. The 2012, from what I can gather, is going to be quite generous in its development. The '13 is drinking supremely well as well, and whether fresh or aged, this beer really knocks most spiced beers out of the park, and perhaps most of its other Belgian peers overall."
""
""
""
"O: I dont usually like belgian Quads or Tripels as their often cloying. This was quite excellent though. Would pair great with christmas dinner. Could go well as a dessert on its on, with dessert, or in contrast to a savory dish. Too much flavor for white meat or blander food. One of my favorite belgians."

"A murky mahogany color with an island of wispy off-white fizz on top and decent traces of lace. The aroma offers delicate malt and hints of apple and maybe even a touch of clove. Weaker than I expected but it comes through if you give it a chance. The flavor commands an unusual fruit melange that includes cotton candy mango and grapefruit. Quite odd. At once interestingly nice but then a bit off-putting. Caramel malt is definitely there but the odd fermenting fruit flavors take over and it's attention getting. There's some cinnamon and grassy grain apple to top off this interesting brew. Alcohol is not overly notable but it's a little warming. The body is easily medium with a good fizzy carbonation that gives it a slightly lighter feel for the style. Worth a try but not a real wow for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Just an outstanding seasonal brew. Balanced, smooth and dangerously sessionable at its entirely undetectable 9.0%+ ABV, this is a present I want under my tree every year. I know that some purists out there may complain about ""Specialty Market"" this and that, but if every specialty beer could turn out like this one...wow. All I have to say is, ""Vive le marché spécial!!!"" Also...why is this not classified as a ""Belgian Strong Dark""? Seriously, get it right, folks."

"O: Probably the second best beer they make. It's a great beer to have on Christmas."

"o - excellent as always from St. B. i'll always drink one of these during the holidays i hope."
""
""
""
""
""

"O – Remarkably drinkable at 10%. Nicely balanced and quite a mellow beer in all respects. Would have liked a bit more dark dried fruit and spice since it’s a Christmas Ale. Quite pricey too."

"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is a dark, ruby coloring that is hazy, with a clingy, coating, off-white head. Nose of date, cherry, fig, roasted notes, booze, and sour tannins. Flavors are tart and crisp forward, with cherry tones forming a foundation beneath old-world fruit richness of date and fig. Very layered, very rich, and very balanced. Rich cherry and fig aftertaste, with earthy and woody notes. The finish is lingering sweet, with a perfect balance. Great beer!"
"O -- Love it. Cheers!"

"O: A belgian winter warmer if I've ever had one. Very spicy, almost a little too one-note since the spices are so prominent. Quite tasty though, I will give it that."
""
"Really good Ale. Deep head with a fruity/nutty aroma. Nice moderate body with appropriate carbonation. Dark fruity/nutty taste, finish is nice and lingers and then gets hit with an alcohol taste. This beer was definitely enjoyable during the holidays and was an appropriate recipe as a seasonal, probably a top Christmas beer that I've tried."
""
""
""
""
"O- good, I just wish it had a fuller body."
""
""
"Pours deep dark brown with immense thick white foam. Heavy lacing, patchy all over. Rich toasty fruity nose, raisins and cinnamon. Nutmeg. Plummy. Hearty flavor, spiced malt, quite boozy. Cherries. Chocolate. Loads going on here. Powerful carbonation. Excellent."
""
""
"Overall - An excellent beer - pretty much how i expect Belgian Christmas beers to be... recommended..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A terrific seasonal. Just a shade under the abt 12. Recommended. Great to give as a gift."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is an excellent beer and if memory serves, it is somewhat of a bargain in terms of price. Obviously a year in waiting did not hurt it any. I would not hesitate to pick up leftover bottles and let them stay with me until next Christmas. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Christmas Ale is definitely a bit fruitier, and less chocolately. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than expected, but still not bad. I like the 12 slightly better, but you really can't go wrong with any of the Bernardus beers around the holiday season.."
""
"A very good beer with a great depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A delicious quad. This beer evolves as it warms, bringing out more flavor and complexity. Perfect to wind down with on a cold winter day."
""
""
""
"Banana in the nose obscures some of the more subtle flavor elements, but they are there. If you like St B's dark, you will like this for the same reasons. Nice one to wrap up the holiday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great Quad. The craftsmanship is very impressive. This is pretty similar to their Abt 12, in my opinion. There's minor differences, especially the subtle spices. I think I'd give Abt 12 the edge, but I'd have to do a side by side to really tell. Either way, this is a great beer. Recommended."

"O - 4 - Good belgian beer. Nice and fruity. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"So, like said ex's sister that I never got a piece of; St. Berny Christmas was a bit less flavorful, slightly less robust, but I'm sure like a romp with sister #2, it was still a good time."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Westmalle goblet: looks like a wonderfully made milk chocolate with whip cream on top. Thick white head followed by a cloudy chocolate. Alcohol warms it enough so that it smells and tastes like hot chocolate. It almost melts. The sugars and hops are perfectly balanced. At 10%, drinkability is fantastic."

"As a huge fan of the ABT12, I was excited to see this on tap at Always Ron’s in Hagerstown.  A murky brown, the smell is of figs, dates, toffee, and all around fruitcake flavors.  First sip evokes memories of dried fruits and various forms of sugar…brown sugar, honey, turbunado sugar, on and on.  It seems that the sweetness can morph into whatever style of sugar my brain wants.  The dried fruits complement this well.  A rich, thick brew, the mouthfeel is heavy and rich, and a 7 ounce pour was perfect.  A great strong ale for the Christmas time."

"Overall: A good winter warmer, and worth your time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like the aroma, the taste is alive with toasty malts, dark fruit, molasses, and raisins but it ends with a big lingering hop bite at the finish. Some alcohol burn."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability- A nice sipper for a cold eve because the alcohol doesn't hide too well as the brew warms. Would I be seeking it out at $12-14 a bottle again? No. However it is definitely a good spiced quad."
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour with a massive head with excellent lacing that lasts forever. Nose is of dark fruit, raisins and dates, against a malt backbone with a hint of spice. Light medium body and very well carbonated. Alcohol is well hidden with dark fruit and malt flavors. Spice is present, but subdued. Clean finish with a slight alcoholic bitterness. Not as flavorful or smooth as Gouden Carolus Noel, which in my opinion, is the best of the Belgian Christmas ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavors are certainly in line with a Quad but it has a fruit cake like thickness that makes this an excellent winter holiday beer. Sweet and savory notes of dried candied fruits couple with malt to give this an excellent smoothness."

"I'm not thrilled with this. I'm sure my score says 'bad"" to mean, but honestly this is a nice beer. It isn't worth the 11-12 bucks but you get a drinkable beer with some nice flavors and it isn't boring or something you start naming clones of instantly. That said no, it's not new or unique but hey what is, right?"

"This particular bottle has been aging in my fridge for the last year. The Christmas Ale is bottle conditioned so it poured with a generous head over its deep ruby brown body. The aroma was of fruits and malty sweetness with the taste following the same with some added complexity and a slight bitterness on the palate. The creamy mouthfeel rounded out this truly excellent Christmas Ale that is a fantastic beer for the Holidays."
""
"Overall: Not overly sweet or spicy, though there is a definite abundance of this in the beer's character. Again, probably best served when it's cold outside as it will warm you right up. Bought a second bottle to open Christmas Day."
""
"Overall, I should have kept cold. I will not be buying this again. I like sweet beers but this kind of sweetness is something else entirely. I have tried most of the St Bernardus offerings and I have to rate Abt 12 number one followed by the Tripel then the Pater 6 and Watou Tripel. This Christmas Ale I will lump in with the Prior 8 and the Wit as beers I will probably never have again."

"O very enjoyable, had on tap at OSDH Denton on world beard day. Loved it, very warming, although we were sitting in a humid Texas evening, it was still very nice and comforting"
""
""
""
""
""

"I remember thinking that I needed to take smaller sips, an extremely sweet beer with a very strong mouthfeel and such a high ABV definitely indicated so. Soothing, velvety- Christmas-y. The sweetness reminded me of a concentrated caramel syrup, but in the best way possible. In beer. One of my favorites."

"The definitive Belgian Christmas beer."
"750 ml bottle into signature chalice; best before 7/24/2017. Pours lightly hazy very dark red color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, light banana, brown sugar, molasses, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, coriander, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with balanced malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, pear, light banana, clove, pepper, toast, brown sugar, coriander, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, banana, toast, brown sugar, clove, pepper, brown bread, coriander, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors with dark malt sweetness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong dark ale! Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for 10%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured a beautiful deep, dark color with two fingers of rich off white head. Gorgeous. Scents of dark fruit, banana, alcohol and Belgian yeast. The flavor is excellent, dark fruit, raisins, chocolate, Belgian sugar, slight hints of alcohol and peppery notes are present. Light carbonation and a sticky, let drinkable body lead to an excellent mouthfeel. A fantastic Belgian. By far one of my absolute favorites."
"A great Christmas beer. Not quite as good as Abt 12, but still one of St. Bernardus' better offerings."

"It is important that I mention that this particular ale has an ABV of 10, so I would caution anyone to be very judicious when imbibing this great brew to either be home or have a designated driver. Cheers!"
"O- Bernardus is in my top 5 favorites and this beer does not disappoint. Softer/flatter on tap versus bottle but I'm glad I had the chance to get it on tap. kegs are without conditioning so the experiences are different."
""
""
""
""
"This is an exceptionally good beer. It's very alcoholic but it's well-hidden. Easy to drink. I wish this wasn't a seasonal. Unless I crack open a bottle of Westy 12 that's been aging for a year, I already know this is the best beer I'll have this year."
"O- This beer has everything i want in a quad, except for the taste, they really lost me on it, looks perfect, smells amazing, taste just isnt there for me, not feeling this one St. Bernardus"

"Certainly one of the best Belgian beers I’ve had. On tap at Pizza Port in Ocean Beach. Transcribed from 12/12/12 tasting notes."
""
""
"This is a nice, malty beer where the yeast does a great job imparting spice and character. The ABV was well hidden, there was great balance and drinkability, and it has a solid all around flavor profile. This is definitely a winter beer worth checking out."

"I hadn't had this in a while, so I figured I'd give it another spin. Slightly hazed, ruddy brown pour, with a small cap of off-white head that retained well and left a bit of lacing on the snifter. Nice aroma, toasted bread, light spice, yeast, peach and pear. Taste reflected the nose, caramel malts, yeast, brown sugar, allspice, candied fruits. It's an easy drinker, medium-bodied, crisp, flavorful, some boozy heat, but as it is a 10% quad, you have to expect that a little."

"This is my interpretation of a perfect Christmas Ale."

"at 10%, this is a real piece of work. there is some bitterness to contend with but it's actually a nice part of the overall taste. not as smooth and delicious as the others, but an appreciative craft of art. and it's on tap at the local belgian pub. i gotta get down there soon!"

"This is the best Christmas Ale I have had. Everyone should try this beer, it doesn't matter if you like or dislike beer. This is one of those brews that could turn a Miller Lite drinker into a craft beer/Belgian ale lover over night. Get out grab a glass and raise it to the sky."

"One of my favorite Belgian Christmas beers, if not my favorite. So rich and decadent. Unreal good."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22oz caged bottle into pint glass - new bottle i think. Pours a deep mahogany brown with slight off white head. Nice deep dried fruit typical belgian dubbel aromas bu mixed with big spice character. Taste is of dried fruit and lots of spices - nutmeg, cinnamon, etc...its a bit heavy on the spice, but its still excellent. Deff worth having and a great brew for the holiday season...this would probbaly mellow a bit with some age."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer hits harder than the rest of the St. Bernardus line. It treats the palate a little more roughly, and the alcohol presence is not as well hidden. That's not a bad thing for a big winter beer though. I really enjoyed this Christmas offering. It has all the complexity one could want, and it retains that distinct St. Bernardus 'house' taste. An excellent fireside sipper for sure."
""
"Overall, this is really one of the best beers I have ever had. Just so much going on and all the flavors and characteristics are perfectly balanced. Dangerously drinkable and one to really savor during the holidays."
""
"Pours a dark ruddy amber with a thick head and minimal lacing. Smells of spices, raisins, plums, cherries and brown sugar. Taste is more spices, dark fruits, brown sugar and molasses. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a fantastic Christmas ale (my new favorite)! which is a nice alternative to the Abt 12. Alcohol is well hidden for 10% ABV. Merry Christmas!"
""
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours dark caramel brown with a thick, eggshell colored head that dissipates slowly. Plenty of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of banana, spices such as cinnamon and clove, malt, fig, and some caramel sweetness. The malt backbone is bready and mildly sweet with banana, cinnamon, clove, and fig. The 10% alcohol is well hidden in this beer. Saying the taste follows the nose is true, but it also understates the execution of the well-balanced and complex flavors in this beer. One flavor does not dominate the other. The beer is medium to full bodied with strong carbonation. This makes the beer smooth and dangerously drinkable. If you are looking for a great Belgian strong dark ale, this is a great place to begin."
"A well made strong dark ale for any season. Another great brew from good ol' St Bernardus."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the better Christmas ales to come out of Belgium; my bottle was a bit undercarbonated but still quite good"
"First taste I can tell this is an ongoing complexity. Raisin, bread pudding and sweet dark fruit (date/ raisin), nutty and with nutmeg, some peppering, with a long burning finish. Pretty well carbonated. This sipper was a great choice for a Christmas beer. Complex, strong, nice seasonal flavoring. Would recommend to anyone, especially those who enjoy Abby beers..to try Christmastime or anytime during the winter."

"This is one of my favorite Christmas brews. Pours a nice dark brown, with several inches of head. A nose of banana, raisin, and cloves. Flavor of raisins, figs, and a tad boozy. Very malty with little to no hop presence. Has a nice velvet mouth feel."
"O: Pretty tasty! Don't know that I'm going to actively seek it out every year, but certainly enjoyable."
""
"A solid Christmastime BSDA that acts as a wonderful winter warmer. One of the things I like about most BSDA's are their complex flavor profiles, and this one is no different. Lots of things going on, but they work together well."

"Bernardus makes a great beer, including this one. There is great balance going on. This is an excellent Christmas beer."
"O: One of the best Christmas Beers I have ever had. Somewhat dry and not too sweet, the flavours of the yeast are fantastic."
"Huge body and tons of carbonation. Very lively and strong brew with a velvet like texture. Only minor complaint would be that it's almost too bubbly and it gets in the way of the flavors."

"I prefer the Southern Tier 2xmas for the season. Easy drinking and an excellent spice finish."

"St. Bernardus Christmas Ale pours a very dark mahogany, with a handful of cherry highlights. Roughly two fingers of bone colored foam crown the beer, but head retention and lacing are both a bit disappointing. The nose displays a nice ester and phenol balance. There's plenty of dark fruit in the aroma, with a solid, yet secondary spicy quality to it. There's not as much fruitiness as far as the flavor goes. There's a bit of plum, but overall the sweetness is more caramel than anything else. The clove phenol character is a bit more potent here, perhaps just a little too much for my taste. There's also a warming (but not hot) booziness that lingers a little bit. Can't argue with the mouthfeel though, as the beer is wonderfully dried out and drinkable for 10%, and the carbonation has plenty of life to it. The Christmas Ale isn't the most impressive beer in St. Bernardus's repertoire, but it's still a fairly solid strong Belgian brew."
""
""
"Overall: It was much sweeter and lighter than I expected for a Christmas Ale, but I liked it. I don’t know if it is the taste, mouth feel or just the glass, but it reminds me of a good wine. It taste lighter than an 10% ABV, but I got a nice little buzz from one bottle."

"A = 93"

"O: This brewery produces some awesome beer for sure, and this is one of the many examples!"
"O: Not a whole lot about this beer says, specifically ""Christmas"" but there's a lot that says winter. The spices are warm, the alcohol is warm, the beer is thick and sweet and delicious. Honestly, no single part of this beer stands out to me, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
""

"Overall – Quite tasty of fruit, warming and just the right amount of spice. A delicious winter warmer."

"O - What a nearly perfect beer for those who love strong Abbey ales. And I do. Could drink this from the Macy's parade to first day of spring."

"This pours an opaque brown and smells like Belgium yeast an then sweet. It tastes belgiumy and is sweet and malty. It had good carbonation and a medium body. Overall I would recommend if you can find it but its seasonal and I got it after Christmas."

"This is the perfect Belgian Ale. The 10% ABV creeps up slowly. It is so perfectly balanced with intense caramel and spiced sweet apple, dark fruits, vanilla and notes of banana esters with a lingering tartness similar to a freshly baked apple pie. My concept of perfection, sweet fruitiness, caramelized burnt sugar, and cinnamon spice with no hoppy bitterness to spoil the experience. On my death bed I want a bottle of St. Bernardus Christmas Ale. Then at my wake I want everyone to drink St Bernardus Christmas Ale until they pass out to remember me by. Beer Advocate is a great place to learn about beer, but they should allow pictures of beer poured into a glass which is way more important than the appearance of the bottle."

"Poured into a tulip glass. Color was a nice dark reddish color with a frothy dirty white head, small traces of carbonation rising from the bottom in a few places.. Head clung to the sides nicely, and then lasted a bit. Aroma was sweet, slightly fruity. Had hints of a mid range wine as well with just tad of alcohol. Flavor was fruity sweet, but not overly so. A small bit of spice hiding in there, but reminded me very much of a barleywine. Coated the mouth extremely well, felt nice and rich and creamy, with just a hit of carbonation in the mouth. Overall, a solid beer. Hid the ABV well, but was definitely a sipper, and most likely suitable for cold weather, not late August."
""
""
""
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, ruddy brown amber with a nice one finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, dark and dried fruit and Belgian spicing. Flavor follows with strong dark fruits, brown sugar and spicing; somewhat astringent aftertaste. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice Belgian winter warmer from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: Great beer and easily drinkable. You can drink this beer pretty much year round. May be a little heavy for summer though."

"Will pour a five+ finger cream head that fades very slowly, leaving some lace. Deep, opaque brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is Belgian yeast and flavor is sweet Belgian yeast and spice, nice Christmas ale. Higher ABV is hidden. $11.20 for a 750ml caged & corked bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Deep walnut brown in color and murky. Poured with a billowy off-white foam with awesome retention that left huge sheets of lacings on the glass. Spicy aromas hit the nose first with sweet estery and dark malts in the background. Medium bodied with aggressive yet smooth delicate carbonation. Dark fruit and banana flavors from start to finish with spices overtop. Herbal hops come and go through the middle. The flavors are consistent and coexist nicely as not one flavor overwhelms the others. Finishes semi-dry with a light yeasty and spicy aftertaste."
"While a very strong beer there is no taste of alcohol and even with the cherries, honey and spices this is not a sweet beer either. This is great for the holiday season."

"M / O. Full bodied beer for sure, but smooth and sweet, the malt finish fading out slowly, lingering. What a tasty brew this was! If this is fresh, then it is a tremendous recipe. I really do think this is the second best beer I've had from this brewery, after the 60th Anniversary. Saint Bernardus Christmas is a true Belgian classic, and one that will be finding its way into my glass a good deal more often. Highly recommend."

"This was my first Christmas ale I have tried. And as usual like all St. Bernardus beers it was simply amazing. The fruits and chocolates all worked very well together. Tremendous amount of alcohol present which is always good. But it was very well balanced with the taste. There is an amazing head when poured out of the bottle. I actually had to use my Stella knife to cut the head off. A must try in my book."
"Full body with a smooth carbonation. Finishes strong and sweet. Way too rich for me, but it's a fair Belgian winter ale."
"O: Quite an amazing brew. If it weren't for the sweetness I could make this a regular indulgence."
""
"Appearance is deep red-brown, some lacing going on. Its` nose has raisins, yeast, candy, brown sugar and figs. A very robust smelling beer. Taking a sip of this strong dark ale and I taste spices from the winter season such as cinnamon and clove, along with some more dark fruits. MF leans towards full, the alcohol does not really hide. Sip this one and enjoy on a cold winter day."
""
""
""
"O: A great winter sipper; complex and delicious; another superb ale from St. Bernardus! Mmmm...."
""
"A decent beer, but not as complex as I was expecting. I have had several beers of this style, and it doesn't quite match up to the best of them. Still, it is a nice beer to drink on a cold night, and glad I tried it."
"Poured from a 75 co bottle into a goblet, 2010 edition. This pours a slightly hazy dark tea color with a decent white head which dissipates quickly. The smells are of belgium yeast esters, dark fruit and spices. Feel is very high carbonation, medium feel. The taste is good pretty malts, lots of ripe dark fruit, a little alcohol burn, but tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was pretty disappointed with this bottle as I felt the carbonation was extremely high compared to what it should be. I have one more bottle in my cellar that I hope to enjoy sometime in the near future. If it's less carbonated, I intend to possibly change the review. I liked the flavors that were coming through however."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, with high carbonation levels. Overall, this is a great brew, that goes down wonderfully. Besides the lack of balance, everything works together in great ways."

"Definitely one of the finer Christmas beer offerings."

"O) Great beer...not much more to say..."

"D- if I didn't know what I was drinking I wouldn't have said this had anything to do with Christmas. No real Christmas spice note for me but that's no bad thing. Would have liked to taste more malt depth/complexity but overall tasty and deceptively smooth. No alcohol heat at all. Dangerous stuff and potentially one to age!"
""
""
""
"D - My first BSDA, and a solid one at that. Doesn't exactly show off a whole lot of seasonal flavors, but I enjoyed it a lot overall. Sort of reminded of the Abt 12, but I liked this one a bit more. Nice and easy to drink, but the 10% ABV is disguised way too well; this one will certainly sneak up on you!"
"easy sipper. Complex, interesting, and enjoyable. Slightly under the original Abt. 12 but still amazing."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great all around beer and worthy of a special occasion. Very easy drinkability despite its indicated alcohol content. Malty lush body with a good support of yeasty character makes this all you can want from a Belgian dark ale. Once again Brouweij of St. Bernardus and St. Sixtus (Westvlteren) seem to be in a league of their own when it comes per style and overall quality."
""
""
"O- As i have already mentioned this beer is very complex but quite a bit of a mess. It still is decently drinkable and warming, but it's musty, herbal character just not gets in the line with it's dry malt character. I didn't notice bad or completely off flavours nor any other major issue, so i'm reviewing it"
"Pours a murky dark brown with a huge 3 inch foamy beige head that settles to a small cap. Base on the first pour I got mostly foam so I think there may an issue with the carbonation on this one. A latticework of thin rings lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt, brown sugar, and some dark fruits. Taste is very much the same with a nice flavor of dark fruits (raisins, plums, etc.) on the finish. Like I suspected based on the pour, this beer has an extremely high level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Way overcarbonated in my opinion but without any indicators of infection or the like. Overall, this is a good BSDA and a very nice beer to sip on for Christmas night but the mouthfeel brings down my enjoyment of this beer."
""
""
"A perfect Christmas beer! Sweet and spicy upfront and dry and satisfying on the finish."
""
"Overall - Personally, I do not find this ale nearly as balanced as the Abt 12. It is a great Christmas beer, but maybe not as quite as good compared to others I've recently had (see my other reviews). I love the cherries in this beer and I certainly appreciate the label! Fairly festive and the dried fruits and cherries really bring out an interesting quality to this. A solid Christmas ale."
"MO- What a great beer. I'm halfway down my glass and it just keeps tasting better, the foamy head has calmed down but is still thick and creamy. Got this for Christmas from my wife and now want to go out and get some more."
""
"O- Overall a very nice Belgian/Christmas ale."
"Overall another great Belgian Christmas ale. Not too much difference among the three I tried, and all are worthy."
"O - Fantastic. I've made this beer a part of my Christmas morning traditions. A perfect beer for the holidays. I enjoy just sitting by the tree and indulging on the rich, sweet taste of this beer. The dark fruit, bread and spice elements all blend to create an amazing Christmas experience."
""
""
"Overall: A very good Belgian Dark Ale and one of the best Christmas beers in the world. Great use of dark fruits and spices."
"O- Awesome beer. It is in my opinion, a little better then the 12. Its just like the twelve but with a slight Christmas kick."
"Notes: Super! This is really good stuff. I've had 5 different beers by St Bernardus and love 3 of them; Pater 6, Abt 12 and this Christmas Ale."
"D: a delicious belgian dark from a brewery that doesnt really make a bad beer. wouldnt hate to see this year round. dangerously drinkable and hard to detect the 10%ABV on this tasty treat."
"M: rounded with incredible depth and balance, tastes like it's been aging for years"
""

"O - A great Christmas beer that I recommend to anyone who likes these types of beers."

""
""
"O: I liked this, but it didn't overwhelm me. 4"
"3/4 finger medium brown head, slow dissipation with some lacing over dark brown opaque body. One of the best smelling beers I've had in a long time, pronounced stone fruit presence, plums, raisins, red currants, a little bit of pluots, balanced nicely with floral hop aromas. Taste features the above stone fruit profile with healthy dose of caramel malt or dark candi sugar which provided quite a bit of residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is well on the full side of medium, good effervescence, a surprisingly astringent mouthfeel given the inherent sweetness. This has to be one of the world's best Christmas beers especially when aged, though drinkablility is a bit impaired by high ABV."
"O: This is a very tasty beer. The most interesting thing is the way the fruity and peppery esters separate from each other, makes for a very pleasant beer. I will need to have this again before the holidays are through, probably more than once."
"St. Bernardus Christmas Ale does all that world class Belgain Strong Ales are expected to, and with many extraordinary nuances to set it apart from the mere good ones. An absolute delight with each sip as new flavors reveal themselves with each visit to the glass. The descriptor words for this beer are seemingly endless."
"Tastes like it smells only good god it is as smooth as red velvet cake. Caramel gets overtaken by fruit, which gets overtaken by spice, which gets overtaken by boozy burn, and then everything ends on more spice, but then, even after that, there lingers silky smooth fruit with more bananas and the burn, holy heaven above the burn does not abate."

"This is a big, bold beer with a lot going on. I'd like to store one of these for a year to see the difference."

"O - a nice strong dark ale with a nice crispy spicy flavor"
""
"Bottle. A deep red beer with a thin tan head. The aroma has notes of over ripe fruits, yeast, spices, alcohol, prunes, and a bit of wood. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, over ripe fruits, prunes, and yeast, leading to a dry alcoholic finish. The alcohol prickles the tongue."
"O - Seems like an effervescent Imperial Saison with some holiday spices. Quite pleasant. A nice holiday diversion."
"Everything requisite for a strong Belgian Christmas ale is present. Toffee, cinnamon, treacle, and clove. Good balance with a firm bitterness. Sweetness and alcohol creep up after the first glass. Earthiness emerges after it warms up in the glass. Nice beer, but it's more expensive than Abt 12 sitting right next to it on the shelf, and we all know that one is world class."
"A true classic and a beer I’ll never tire of drinking (if I’ve got the next day off)."
""
""
"Lovely smooth medium body. Not a bunch of carb that I was expecting since it blew the cork off. That’s prob where some of it went. Leaves a little tongue tingle."
""
"Overall: Truly fantastic. I couldn't expect much more from St. Bernardus. Tastes a little like ABT 12 with spices. A good sipper for a cold winter night."
""
""
""
"OK, ever made that root beer float and had the head that just took a few to go away...that is how this poured. I am currently at the end of the bottle and there is still some lacing sticking around the pint glass. For me, this has just enough of the hops and toffee/chocolate to keep me coming back for another (and I am wanting a second bottle at the moment). I will be back for another of these and will be looking for other St Bernardus bottles in the local markets."

"A must try and a great winter warmer."
"Can't imagine a better winter warmer."
""
"This pours a tan-brown color. It has a spicy aroma—I pick up a lot of the so-called holiday spice mix blended/balanced with an estery Belgian-style aroma. Upon tasting I find cinnamon and cloves dominate, along with an underlying Belgian quad taste. Warms nicely with little hint of its strength. Tasty."
""
"O-i'm actually surprised at how drinkable this beer is. it goes down very easily for the high ABV. as i drink it more, the flavors in the after-taste seem to come out more. its not my favorite christmas brew, but it isn't bad. i'll get this again some time, but next i'd like to share the 750mL possibly. this is great beer though...a must try."
""
""
""
"overall, it's a bit reminiscent of (at the risk of being simplistic) a spiced version of the abt 12 - which i would prefer. a very good christmas ale, just nothing overly spectacular."
""
""
""
"O: I've always been a fan of both St. Bernardus and this style, so I really wanted to like this beer. Unfortunately, I just couldn't. The overwhelming alcohol presence and heavy mouthfeel ruined this one for me. I doubt I'll be purchasing this beer again."
""
"Super carbonated, Belgian ale just in time for this holiday season, pours a slightly clouded mahogany brown burgundy color with a light khaki tan head forming thick and fully bubbled. Aroma is full of Christmas spices meaning hints of cinnamon, ginger, and other famous pie spices. Full on flavor of ripened fruits and sweet bursting dessert like bready pie crust. Fruit filled with spices galore this is some big festive drinking Christmas ale. Full on honey tinged ripened fruit with hints of papaya, pineapple tartness with bittering hoiday spices balancing out the pure sweetness of this big Belgian ale. Alcoholic slight medicinal burn in each sip with high carbonation this really tickles the nares but the effervescent carbonation carries things well, and it finishes with bitter dry holiday spices. Wonderful amazing freak of nature Belgian Christmas bier that we all look forward to each year."

"Drink- I really liked this beer. It was a good way to end the evening with friends for a Xmas party in the beginning of Dec. I would/should go get another bottle of this one to age till next year."

"Judged against other BSDAs, this is pretty mediocre. As a Christmas ale, I feel just about the same."

"Poured into a chalice from a bomber. Huge foam! Maybe two inches of thick creamy head that slowly dissipated to a nice 1/4 inch layer that lasted to the end. Great lacing too. Scent is dark fruit, molasses, a little orange and clove. Taste is similiar, dark fruits and molasses. Good carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Overall a great beer. I was defiantly wanting more when it finished. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Overall Impression- Rich, Complexed, and a very WILD Christmas Ale! I'm definitely stopping by Lukas Liquor to pick up a bottle of this and review/enjoy again! I suggest you do the same (but of course, your local bottle shop). See if you can spot the cherries in this one! There were a huge attribute in this brew for me that made it so enjoyable. Thanks Brouwerij St. Bernardus! Fantastic."
""
""
"O- Delightful beer that I look forward to getting next year as well. Pairs nicely with the summer sausage and cheese spread I've got going."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a nice once finger cocoa head. Excellent lacing left on my snifter glass. Nose is mainly figs, raisin, dark fruit, clove, and other spices. Not quite as strong as I'd like, but still very balanced and pleasant. Taste steps it up a notch- this is one of the better Belgian Christmas brews I've had. Just super balanced and really well put together. Feel is full, smooth, and incredibly balanced... Pretty amazing! Overall, this is probably the #2 Belgian Christmas beer I've had- it's definitely worth a buy. Cheers!"

""
""
"O - A good Christmas ale but not so special. It is over the top. A not so good attempt to make something good even better."
""
""
"Overall this is quite nice, but you do have to pay attention to it; it's complex, but not a flavor bomb. I can't quite place why, but it does feel like a christmas beer to me, despite not really having any christmas-y spices as far as I can tell."
""
""
"Served with a smallish, cream colored head and lots of lace. Color is a cloudy brown amber. Aroma is super malty, vineous, yeast, caramel, toffee, fruit. Flavor's very similar to nose with toffee, caramel, malt, yeast, carbonic tang all in the fore! Body and carbonation are faultless. Finish is malt, carmel, toffee and a touch of fruit while of average length. Luscious beer!"
"Overall - Fantastic, love this! A boat load of flavor, easy to drink, but this 22oz is plenty. A great once a year beer that i seek out annually and use to start my holidays with. Christmas has started offically for me. Great beer, espically for St. Bernardus 10 and 12 fans."
"O - Very good beer by St. Bernardus. Complex yet approachable and high on the ABV but not too intense. Very good beer and great for the cooler weather."

"I've been waiting to try this beer for a while but got totally shut out last year. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in my St. Bernardus chalice. Be careful opening this one - once I removed the cage the cork fired like a shotgun blast and ricocheted off the ceiling. Pours a deep plum color with a slightly hazy clarity. Head starts off as a fluffy, two inch, cream-colored cloud of foam. As the head recedes into a quarter inch cap, delicate, textured spots and strands of lacing are revealed and exhibit excellent adhesion. This beer looks exquisite in its proper glassware. Nose expresses dark fruits with a slightly vinous character, Belgian yeast and some nutty notes (perhaps hazelnut). Taste follows nose - flavor profile is pretty standard for the style in my opinion; however, there's a trace of ethanol that overshadows things a bit, making it difficult to tease out the subtleties. I also get a little wet cardboard towards the finish, but it dissipates quickly. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slightly prickly carbonation, as well as a bit of gassiness. Overall, a very solid Belgian Strong Dark; however, perhaps a little young. I would probably sit on this vintage for a couple more years."

"awesome beer, basically like a spiced abt 12."

"O- Very tasty! I love St Berandus. I am really enjoying the Christmas version. If you like big beers this will deliver what you are craving."
""
"Overall - An incredibly delicious brew and so fitting for a christmas setting. I bought two to see how one tastes in the summer out of curiosity!"
"Drinkability: Frankly, it justifies the price. And then some. This is a very tasty and potent holiday beer. It makes an ideal stocking stuffer."
"O - Great Christmas Ale with ABV very well hidden. I highly recommend it."
"O-A typically classy, high quality beer St. Bernardus. I expect this bottle would be fantastic with a few more years on it."
"Opinion: As is usual with St Bernardus products, I have been really happy with this beer. It is great tasting and has lots of character and is dangerously easy to drink. That said, I think that I like their Abt12 better, just because. This one comes across a bit fruity in the beginning where I don't remember that with the Abt12. I am splitting hairs here. If you haven't tried this beer...try it. I would recommend anything with St Bernardus written on the bottle, and this beer is no exception. I'm glad that I finally tried it."
"Got this beauty from my nephew Kevin. Dark mahogany-ruby pour with huge three finger head with great retention and lacing. Big herbal, complex nose with hints of black cherries, metal, brown sugar, dark fruits, and tobacco. The taste is complex as well. Lots of black cherries, plums and bananas with a nice herbal backbone with hints of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla and just a touch of chocolate and orange peel. The finish is crisp and dry. The mouthfeel is carbonated, but slightly syrupy. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. It's not as ""christmasy"" as I had hoped, but still a classic beer from a great brewery. Thanks Kevin!"
"Looking at this beer you don’t notice any carbonation, but this beer does have a carbonated mouthfeel."
"This beer pours out as a deep red color with a foamy tan colored head. The lacing isn't too bad here. The smell of the beer has a lot of spice to it. There is some decent flavors once the beer warms up. The beer right from the fridge has a metallic flavor at first. The spices kick in and leave a slight amount of heat in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little warming and had a lot of carbonation. Overall it's not a bad Christmas ale."
"Overall/notes - Christmas in a bottle! I've heard and said this phrase before, but it here it really rings true. It definitely needs a bit of warming, but you'll be rewarded in kind. With the exception of that first shockwave, I had little to no complaints about this ale. Drink and be merry!"
"The mouthfeel nice with a solid full body and pleasantly well carbonated. Overall this is a fine holiday sipper best enjoyed with your family and/or friends. My uncle and I thoughly enjoyed this while the family rushed to the kitchen for the desserts, we already had ours in our glasses..."
"O - a winter warmer if there ever was one, its not the super spiced up version that some go for, but is more of a strong sweet belgian with a little x-mas cheer baked in, well worth a purchase"
"From corked and caged 750ml. Pours a mostly clear dark reddish brown with two fingers of creamy khaki colored foam. Settles to a decent sized clump and coats the glass in thick lace. Smell: quite vinous and fruity...cherry, raisin, plum. Brown sugar. Very slightly acetic. Taste: brown sugar, tartish apple skin, red plum, cherry. Vinous again. Feel is extraordinarily creamy, but is also massively carbonated which boots the flavors from the tongue too early. Though the high carbonation and the decent but nondescript hopping keeps it from being really sweet. It might just be me or this bottle, but this one seems like a combo of a BSDA with a mild flanders red. Interesting, but odd. Best by 7/28/15, so bottled 7/28/10."
"O - Super glad I had an opportunity to taste this one, and I would highly recommend anyone in a festive mood grab a bottle and share the experience with a fellow BA. Tons of flavours and the high ABV goes nearly undetected making for a fantastic experience. Cheers for the beer Joe!"
"D- Very drinkable considering the alcohol content. Very well made. World class."
"Overall, an interesting beer that's well worth picking up."
"Sizable head drops down to a latte-like foam; this ale is nearly black in color as well. Candied fruit, plum pudding, hint of broth, burnt sugar and mulling spices scream X-mas to the nose. Carbonation smoothes the palate, silky with a delicate but thick medium body. Malt character is on the dry side for the most part; a smattering of caramel is in the middle. A bit hoppy with a side of phenols, all of which go herbal. Alcohol is pretty tame for 10 percent--it warms but does not rake the taste buds too much. Fruity, spicy and yeasty with hints of dark sugar and some earthy yeast in the drying finish. Super complex, yet still a sipper. This ale is waiting to be thrown at a rich holiday meal."
"Overall: A great beer I wish I would have bought more and now its all sold out! I am getting at least 2 bottles next year! This is one of the very best Christmas/winter seasonal's I have had! I highly recommend this one!"
"The 75 cl bottle is perfect size for two people."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a heavy chalice glass. A- Murky caramel/orange hue, huge amounts of off-white frothy head that is effervescent and mostly sustaining, splatters of lacing S- Nose is dark fruits, sweet belgian candy, alcohol, green apples, and spices T- Initial taste is dark fruits followed by spritzy spices, peppermint, and bananas, finishes with sweetness and alcohol warming M- Full-bodied, thick chewy texture, amped-up carbonation D- Smooth and balanced strong ale, milder spice flavors and lively carbonation contribute to a unique taste profile, very easy. One of my top winter brews."
"Strangely enough, I am not a fan of this flavor but this is a well put together brew. I wouldn't want this again, but I can see the reasons why people would have this beer again no problem."
"Not a typical Christmas Ale by any means. Very original sensation from start to finish, but this wasn't my kind of beer. And at $11 for a 750mL bottle, I don't think I'll be picking one up next year."
"D: This is terrific and definitely the best abbey-style Christmas ale."
"Overall a real nice Christmas Ale that I will surely pick up each year from now on. Not a superstar, but just a really solid enjoyable beer....like I expected anything else from St. Bernardus."
"D: Very good. A nice holiday offering, though I wasn't blown away by it."
"A nice beer with plenty of flavour. Balanced with just enough dryness to make it drinkable."
"D- killer killer stuff. I love it what else can I say. one of if not the best xmas brew ever."
"Carbonation seems a little too high for these flavours."
"VERY GOOD; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
"Pours a rich ruddy brown with a nice thin head and fine lacing. Nose is fairly subdued with yeasty/dark bread, chocolate and fruitcake notes. Fairly rich and sweet on the attack but the body isn't as heavy. Compared to the Abt 12 this is less weighty and fairly drinkable. Mouthfeel lacks some weight and richness one would expect from this style. A little more density would help to balance the 10% ABV. Still the pedigree shows with excellent purity in the dark malt/yeasty/toffee flavors. A fine Xmas ale for a winter night but by no means transcendent."
"Overall this is a very solid brew, not as good as the original ABT but tasty nonetheless - 4.25"
"jd"
"D: There is a slight taste of alcohol but the 10% is masked pretty well, making it highly drinkable. Very good offering and a must try BSDA."
"Drinkability on this is a must have for any belgian beer fan. I will procure another bottle and cellar it. I can only imagine how much smoother and silkier this brew will get with time."
"Pours a dark plum color under a fluffy, light tan head that settles to a creamy ring. Smells of dark, fruity bread...rich berry and fig, caramelized sugar, faint vanilla bean, and warm spices. Juicy dark fruity flavor...more yeastiness than the nose. A rich maltiness lurks beneath the fruit (and a solid helping of booze). Cocoa, pepper, and xmas spices. Wait for it to warm up a little to bring out the best qualities. Slick, plush mouthfeel - warming and lightly bitter. Once this warmed to slightly cooler than room temperature, everything seemed to come together to form a delightful holiday beer."
"A dark cola brown color with a sizable head of off white foam. Good lacing and retention. Aromas of fruitcake and rum. Bananas and toffee. Good Belgian yeast profile and a bit of sweet alcohol. Taste is much the same with a bit of bready malt at the core. Spiced and toasty. Raisins and figs really push forward here and the alcohol while well integrated is apparent in the finish. Finish is dry and earthy with a bit of fusel booze. Some good bittering. A warming and very complex beer here. Feel is thick and rich with a lightly prickly carbonation. Goes down nicely and the flavors develop nicely as it warms. A sipper for sure but you keep sipping often. Yum."
"Mouthfeel-Medium carbonation delivers a very sweet body with some booziness. The alcohol is not too hot, but present. The malt is obviously there but the fruit profiles along with rich bready flavors really dominate with this one. The yeast has chosen to put these to the forefront, and the malt backbone is disguised. Sweet and rich and tasty. The finish reveals a little of the Belgian-yeast-funk, a bit on the tangy side. The fruitiness of the aroma and flavor swings from fig to raisin to cherry to...This was a good one to share with others who are not big beer folks and everyone enjoyed it."
"D - An easy drinking Belgian Strong Dark Ale which should be no surprise coming from a Trappist brewery... I would gladly enjoy this offering each holiday season..."
"Merry Christmas"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with a full body and moderate carbonation."
"Notes: A BSDA with plenty of spice and bitterness. Good beer but I was expecting a little more. I enjoyed it for a holiday sipper for a winter day with family. Good beer overall."
"D - good drinkability."
"D: Not bad, not bad. I don't think it's amazing, but it is a pleasing brew and I'd probably get it again to age."
"D: Drink is good too, but not outstanding."
"MERRY CHISTMAS!!"
"Drinkability: Great flavor, smooth, ABV very well masked, an easy drinking beer."
"Overall, while I would normally prefer a sweeter, less tart brew, this is an excellent offering for sampling on a cold winters night."
"Oh yeah and the cork damn near took my head off shooting out of the bottle."
"This is a very tasty beer that has many typical Belgian characteristics. I'm not sure what makes it a Christmas beer (orange peel maybe?), but it's definitely something to enjoy while available for the holidays."
"Cheers."
"Edit: Just checked and this is my highest rated beer to date (out of what I have reviewed). When I think about it, this makes perfect sense, this beer is exceptional!"
"It's been way too long since I've savored one of these special brews from these smiling monks. Absolutely exceptional brew here."
"First rate."
"D: This is a great winter brew that shows classic style notes and a sweet winter warmer. While I would only visit this brew once a season, I would still highly recommend it."
"This beer is uncorked with a resounding 'pop'. It pours a deep, clear, rich, not-quite-crimson red color. The head is towering, firm, and light tan in hue. Nice, big, malt aromas are front and center. Healthy doses of alcohol, dark fruit, and phenols key to the smell as well. The taste is surprisingly smooth, with a serious fullness for the high carbonation levels. Not quite as dry as I expected. The taste is heavy on the malt and fruit character. All in all, this is a fantastic beer."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden."
"Worth trying, great winter Christmas beer."
"Overall: I like this one better then I liked St. Bernardus Abt 12. The dryness really makes it enjoyable. It cuts through the sweetness to balance things out. This is the closest beer I've had to Westy 12. It really reminds me of it. I recommend this one highly."
"Drinkability is pretty good, drinks a lot smoother and lighter than 10%, and sweetness is balanced well and the aged malt flavor probably helps."
"This beer was poured in my Essen Christmasbeerfestivalglass (what a word for wordfeud!) The beer was disappointing again..."
"D: The beer has a very strong flavor. You can definitely taste and feel the alcohol. However, the beer is tasty and has quite a kick."
"D - Smooth, solid flavours with a great appearance. The appearance of this really sealed the deal for me. Such a gorgeous ale."
"From a 750ml into a chalice. Nice hazy, brown carbonated with a decent head for ten perecent. lacing is slight. The aroma is fruity like sweet sugary candy. The taste is just like the smell, but with bread pudding taking over. Rasins and molasses also come through in the flavor. There is a lot going on with this brew. The body is full, but that doesn't stop you from craving more."
"D: At 750mL 10% it's highly drinkable and smooth, a good one to share on a cold winter night by the fire."
"D) Easy drinker given the ABV. As the beer warms the flavors come thru. Very enjoyable Christmas brew."
"My only complaint is that this beer is a bit sweet for all its medicinal flavors. The gestalt is an underattenuated ale with Brettanomyces cherry pie flavors. If I hadn't been a sickly child, swilling Dimetapp every winter, I am sure this beer wouldn't conjure the same images. As it is, a dryer finish would steer me into bliss."
"EDIT: After two days in the fridge, the character of this beer changed drastically. Obviously, it became less carbonated and more sticky, but, more dramatically, the sourness disappeared completely to be replaced by maraschino cherries and a cough syrup flavour. The smell is different too -- cherries, christmas cake, and plum pudding."
"D - Yet another top brew by St Bernardus, would go down well with christmas pudding."
"My only complaint is the flavor, which is a little bit 1-dimensional compared with the other aspects of the beer. Nonetheless, it's still very good, and would definitely fit the bill as a winter warmer. Belgians often do a good job at making the alcohol in these high ABV beers sneaky-this one is no exception."
"Spicy and hot. It is malty with very little hop character. aftertaste has a slight astringent quality. This beer is really smooth and flavorful. It is an exceptional beer, fitting for a limited release."
"D: This is very drinkable. It would probably go well with a gamy meat without spoiling the palate."
"D - I polished this off quite easily and the flavors are not too bold and could allow for a second to be had."
"overall not impressed"
"D: Maybe the best of all the Belgian Christmas beers I've had to this point. This is pretty much what I think of/look for in this kind of beer."
"Man, that monk sure looks happy and festive. His brew pours a hazy sienna topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises nutmeg, fig, cinnamon, and a touch of roasted malts. The taste runs very similarly, with the addition of banana and chocolate. The body is a staunch medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat grainy feel. Overall, another win from Bernardus. I can't wait to try the others I've yet to experience."
"D: for me, the appearance is the best thing about this beer. I've never seen a beer as opaque, a head as thick with such good retention and carbonation as unrelenting. The beer itself is good but in a I've-definitely-tasted-this-type-of-thing-before kind of way. I'm feeling that ABV though, warming on a cold winter day, a great feeling."
"D: Easy to drink, but one glass sure does for you."
"Notes: Feels a touch short of the impression from their XII but by the same token it may be more popularly liked, at least as an entry point for festive drinking across a diverse table. Not a favorite of mine, but with sharing in mind I would repeat it."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, I only had one because of the alcohol content and the sweetness, although subtle a little more than I prefer."
"When enjoyed slowly, its drinkability is great. Given that the bottle says you can age this for up to 15 years, I need to buy a handful of these now to save for the next Christmases."
"Like other holiday season libations, this is a barely restrained, indulgent sipper, for satisfying that sweet tooth, keeping out the chill, and keeping the craziness to an acceptable hum."
"D: Different than I expected (I'd been hoping for Abt 12 plus spices, and this is more of a brown with spices). However, it definitely grew on me. Very drinkable at refrigerator, cellar or room temperature."
"An excellent Christmas Ale. Happy to try it."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black but with a hint of purplish edges. A nice light fluffy head that has ok lacing. The smell follows the taste. You can taste dark fruits (plum, currant, some raisin), figs, some spices and strong belgian yeast which is no surprise. You can definitely feel the alcohol in the mouth and the carbonation, sharp bite on the tongue. This beer is delicious and a great Christmas release."
"Very good brew to drink on a cold night and get ready for Christmas. Very well done flavors and mouthfeel; the added bonus, and what sets it apart from the others I have tried of this type is the great appearance. The velvety smooth head coats the tongue as you drink. Very good sipping brew. This isn't my favorite style of brew, but if you are going to go for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale this is maybe your best option."
"So far this one of my favorite winter offerings this year. St. Bernardus rarely disappoints and this is no exception."
"Mouthfeel is a difficult to describe combination of light and heavy...it's rather thick and sticky, but the carbonation makes it sort of seem lighter than it is. It's kind of nice. The strong taste and the strong alcohol make it not so easy to drink. It's a good and interesting beer, though."
"D: I enjoy the beer, but this was a tad too sweet for me. I would certainly enjoy another, but it is a sipping beer for sure."
"D- I had no problem killing this one myself. A very excellent brew."
"Drinkability is great, due to the carbonation it definitely isn't cloying. Flavors are interesting and light. Dangerously smooth at 10%."
"Overall: What a beer. It has lots of complex flavors, but, more importantly, it has restraint. Like any good Belgian beer, it has elegance. At 10 percent, it puts some warmth in your cheeks. It is without a doubt a great beer for the season."
"Popped the cork and this exploded with foam. Had to wait 15 minutes before i could pour it. Not sure what happened. Off white head is thick and creamy. Body is clear and deep brown. Aroma is of belgian yeast with some spice and dark dried fruit. Alcohol is barely noticeable in taste. Sweet, fruity and malty. Feel is moderate and has the slightest tingle from carbonation. Very drinkable, but share it with a friend as the alcohol will seriously sneak up on you."
"D. A very nice seasonal holiday beer. Can't imagine drinking anything better on Xmas. The abv is well hidden."
"Appears a hazed murky brown, obviously some yeast is there in suspension. Aroma is light and primarily malty with some banana aroma from the yeast. Great belgian ale flavors. Some dark fruits, downplayed spice with light touches of allspice and cinnamon. Some citrus is also noted, possibly from the hops. Brown sugar, burnt caramel. A really nice and well rounded belgian ale. Medium to high level of carbonation with a more-ish finish. I really liked this one. St. Bernardus brews some tasty beers."
"D: Very drinkable. Hides booze moderately. Gave me a nice warmth from the alcohol but didn't hide it."
"D - A very drinkable 10% beer. A winter, sit inside and enjoy a few brews beer. I really enjoyed this. Going to pick up a few bombers next time I hit the bottle store."
"drinkability: Delish goodness. The alcohol of a 10% is there but with kid gloves."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet up front. The midpalate gives way to a semi-dry finish with some more sweetness and no bitterness, the beer overall is highly drinkable and nice. It falls a little short in the middle of the mouth with the sweetness on either side and dryness at the end. I like this beer and this brewery, they are awesome."
"A very good Belgian strong dark ale, which doesn't come as surprise considering the source."
"This beer pours a dark amber with a huge head that lasted throughout the beer. Has a sweet smell, strong nutmeg smell. Very complex taste. Spicey like a good belgin beer, sweet, nutmeg flavors are also presnte. Tastes like a christmas cookie. easy to drink but should be enjoyed slowley. Overall a grea beer perfect for the holidays."
"A HUGE tan foam head. Sell of plum, caramel and figs. Taste is a complexed mix of malts, slight citrus, cinnamon, nutmeg. Mild carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth with a lingering of malt on the palate. Much like a desert. This is a great gift for a holiday dinner party."
"This is a very good beer. It is very smooth and warming. The malts compliment the yeast and give a nice inviting drink. I just want more. I really like this beer. I'm glad I have a second bottle for aging."
"Pours a dark caramel with a nice tan head and some good lacing. Nose is quite nice, dominated by plums, figs, dates, nutmeg, allspice, a touch of cinnamon, and some doughy malt. Lovely yeast character. Taste is just as complex and uber integrated. Like a nice holiday dessert without being at all overly sweet. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy; super smooth. Drinkability is quite nice. Will have to make this a tradition."
"D - easy to sip on and finish a 750ml in an evening. The alcohol is there, but hidden fairly well. I could easily drink one of these each week throughout the holiday season..it is a great beer"
"A very nice example of a dark Belgian ale."
"D. of course this one is a sipper, but very enjoyable!!"
"D: For being such a big beer that is so complex and sweet it is pretty drinkable, but not great, this is definitely a sipper, but on a cold winter night this would probably be perfect!"
"Drinkability- Overall really good, would love to have it again"
"D: OK drinkability. Yeah, this is a Christmas brew, but I would tone down the spice on this a bit. I agree with a recent reviewer: give me an Abt 12 any day over this one."
"Notes: I noticed many comments saying that there is not much flavor to the Christmas Ale. I disagree. It is very flavorful, if a little one-sided (in the raisin and fruity aspects). Perhaps they didn't let it warm..."
"A little too one sided at first, but as it warms, things get better. Still, I'll take an Abt. 12 for Christmas instead of the Chrsitmas beer, how's that for irony?"
"This is a fairly highly carbonated beverage with a solidly strong, big bodied mouthfeel. At 10% alcohol, this is extremely drinkable. A very plesant Belgian holiday brew that I would drink again in a heartbeat"
"Enjoyed on tap at the Tops Tasting Room. Finally got up to this. Pours gorgeous black with a significnat white head, and some spices holding on the tap. Lacey. This is a rich ale, mildly malty, with ginger, allspice, c-hop, white pepper. Just had been tapped last night.A sipper."
"Honestly this was a bit of a let-down. Maybe I'd set my hopes too high, having been waiting for a good time to enjoy this bottle that I'd had since Xmas, but that surely isn't all. I would have expected a bit more flavor and aroma; it didn't really feel like a Belgian Christmas ale, and for a beer of this style it wasn't particularly impressive."
"Finish is long with lingering holiday spice."
"This one has a serious toastiness to it while still being sweetly caramelly. There's a nice cinnamony bite with the spices characteristic of a Christmas ale. There's a little sweet honey, slick feel, slight bite of the alcohol. Dried cherry taste in the background. Decent mouthfeel; slightly creamy and filling."
"Overall- Excellent winter warmer, would like to try one fresh to see what the spice level is and how muted the perfumy alcohol notes are as opposed to this older bottle. Have a feeling a bottle of this fabulous winter brew would hold up for quite some time! Well worth a try, especially this time of year!"
"Taste is lightly roasted, with a candisugary sweetness. A light bitterness, which is a combination of hop and malt bitterness. The yeast adds a nice fruity, Belgian taste."
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell NJ: poured mahogany with one finger of khaki head with good lacing. Smelled of candied fruit, cloves, and blood orange; very unique. Tasted of orange, clove, allspice, and candi sugar; very similar to the nose. However, the alcohol burn was certainly evident in the finish. Very malty, velvety mouthfeel..probably the best aspect of this beer. Good sipping beer."
"A really nice beer, very slick without being cloying with great flavors. Just very well put together."
"An excellent Christmas Ale which was one of the best I've ever had. It went down easy on it's own as well as complimenting the meal I had it with. A great beer!"
"Great brew, although the flavor and mouthfeel don't live up to the incredible aroma, not to mention other St. Bernardus brews such as the Abt 12. Still a great beer to enjoy on Christmas Eve!"
"Wow. Awesome beer. One of the best seasonals I've had this winter!"
"D: Overall a great representation of the style."
"Reviewed from notes that I took a few nights ago. Pours a hazy dark copper-brown color with a gigantic creamy head that would not go away. The head is so creamy that I could almost skim it off and eat it. Medium lacing is left on my glass. Smell is huge fruit and spices. There are yeasty/bread-like notes and a tiny bit of alcohol. I get cloves, coriander and pine in the nose as well. The smell is a bit too spicy to me. The taste is also very fruity. Dark fruits like raisins attack the mouth. Nutmeg, coriander and cloves also assault the palette. There is also a huge yeast taste but no alcohol, impressive for 10%ABV. The taste is a little over the top for me in fruits and spices. The mouthfeel is a bit watery to me. Not what I expected from the huge creamy head. Lighter body than I would want for a pretty big beer. A huge coat of spicy fruit is left on a warm tongue. As far as DB, drinking a lot of this would be tough. I am very happy that I halved the bottle because the spices become extremely powerful after even one pint. The alcohol also starts to get pretty hot as it warms up."
"Love it. Awesome Christmas brew. Much enjoyed."
"Thine is the kingdom and the power."
"Pours a dark copper/amber with a MONSTROUS head that does not quit, must wait 3-5 minutes for it to die down and pour the rest of the beer. Smell is caramel, raisins, dark fruits, sweet, and toasty. Taste is big and sweet, lots of fruits and some burnt toast. Caramel as well. Mouthfeel is good, creamy, could be a tiny bit heavier. Lots of fruity sweetness, the alcohol is well masked but it warms nicely. Good brew, lots to take in."
"D - oh yeah."
"Still decently drinkable especially for the ABV. A bit of a slow drink, but it's worth savoring."
"I could get used to drinking this, but I don't think my waste band could."
"the drinkability is a solid 4. the abv is very well masked, there's no trace other than the slight warming in the throat. it would be even better with body and carbonation adjusted a bit. overall, while not without it's flaws it's a very good winter beer that hits most of the right notes."
"Pours brown with a beige head. Lots of extremely small, fine bubbles. The aroma is Belgian yeast as well as dark fruits and candi sugar. The taste pretty much follows the aroma, with lots of caramel malt. The overall flavor is pretty sweet and the alcohol is present and warming. Medium mouthfeel and highly carbonated."
"The witbier and quad offered by St. Bernardus are at the apex of their respective styles - and their Christmas offering is no slouch either, even if I have had a few Winter brews I've enjoyed more."
"No surprise that those behind St. Bernardus, monks or otherwise, would turn out an excellent Christmas ale. Their regular line (which is anything but regular) consists of some of the greatest beers in the world, and this one is no exception."
"D: A superb drinker. The cool thing is the label says it can be cellared for up to 15 years. Cool. They make nothing but excellent beer after excellent beer."
"This is a great sipping beer. Fairly complex and flavorful with a satisfying warming feel about it."
"D - This is an excelent Christmas beer with an excelent taste definitly worth trying"
"Red crimson beer with an off-white foamy head. The nose smelled like a Christmas fruitcake. Lots of nuts, toffee, mild chocolate and raisins. The taste was there, mouthfeel was not. A slow sipper for sure, dark brown bread, sweet almost cloying from the malts, dark candi sugar and spice cake in the taste. Mouthfeel was not alive, not sharp either but dull, slightly dry and semi-flat tasting. Definitely a complex beer, just not impressed with much else."
"Full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this one plays out very much like the Abt 12 but with a more noticeable spice presence. Very enjoyable and a great Christmas treat."
"drinkable, but over the top sweet. I guess that's what people want for the holidays."
"Lots of small bubbles of carbonation that turn out prickly and somewhat unpleasant. Medium-full bodied, somewhat firm. Very tasty, but unfortunately not a beer style that I seem to like."
"Nice holiday ale, a bit sweet overall, but well spiced. Alcohol is high but the flavors carry it well."
"Overall, I love this beer. It reminds me of the abt. 12 but not quite as luxurious. I am glad I purchased it and may even purchase it again next year. I highly recommend it. It made my Christmas even better than it already was."
"This beer tasted unfortunately close to cola. The horribly overdone carbonation doesn't help matters. Very disappointing offering from such an outstanding brewery."
"D - a good slightly different twist on an exceptional beer. overall pretty enjoyable."
"My first St. Bernardus beer, pretty stoked. Cork pops off with a big explosion, hitting the ceiling followed by a little bit of foaming spillage. It's a Christmas miracle! Pours very dark, looks black until held up to the light which makes it blood red with lots of sediment floating about. Big fluffy pillow of off-white head rests on top, leaves good lacing. Smell is big on Belgian yeast, fruit and a bit of booze. Taste is excellent with lots of flavors bursting through. I'm tasting lots of fruit, mostly dark ones such as cherries, plums and raisins, also a hint of banana. Lots of Belgian yeast/biscuit taste, winter spice and molasses as well. Alcohol extremely well-hidden the entire time. Very tasty and complex. I will definitely buy this next year."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper, both due to the carbonation and the high alcohol. An enjoyable beer, too, although I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more of a...special, or holiday, feel to this beer - it tasted almost generic, and there wasn't something that made it stand out. I would certainly have it again, but it's not one I would spend hours searching for. I wouldn't mind having one of these on hand to age, though."
"This is a very tasty Holiday treat that I can easily look forward to every year. It is a slow drinking beer but savoring it's complex flavors is no problem! Every Belgian beer I try just leads me want to try another."
"This is the first time I have ever tried this. Bought another earlier in this season to age for next year, now I am interested in cracking it open to see how it compares to the aged version. For some reason, these go on deep discount after Santa arrives. Heading to the beer store tomorrow to see what is left."
"drinkability: Great Holiday belgian but I prefer a few others to this."
"Surprising I finished in a single sitting. Medium body that hides the 10%."
"D- This is a easy one to drink quick. I could do a whole bottle easily and in fact i will because the way my life's been going recently I need to be drunk more, the 10% helps. Im thinking BSDA with a winter warmer twist. This could be my favorite offering from bernardus, either this or the 12, may have to compare."
"Very good beer."
"Not my favorite holiday beer but still quite nice and enjoyable."
"Sint Bernardus is one of my favorite breweries for its Pater (6), Prior (8) and Abott (12) line. However, those beers are legacy of tight cooperation between the brewery and local monastery and could be classified as descendants of Westvleteren. Unfortunately the rest of Bernardus offerings does not meet the high standards set by the pious brothers 6,8 and 12."
"Recommended Music Pairing: Ray Charles - The Spirit of Christmas"
"I'm not sure what makes this a christmas beer, but it's really good regardless."
"What a Xmas treat this beer is with a nose that never stops developing and a huge head flecked with brown spots from the sediment. I got a huge rounded mouthfeel with lots of dark candy fruits and typical Belgian yeast. No spices in this Xmas ale but rather the suggestion of Xmas pudding. I really savoured this beer with every sip as it was part of a trade and not available in BC."
"Pours a deep ruby red with a deliciuos fluffy mocha colored head. Has the sweet malty/funky aroma of a good Abbey ale. The first sip is YUMMY! Malty, smooth, and creamy, with ahint of cinnamon at the end. Each sip is even better than the first. More malty smoothnes with hints of dried fruits and nutmeg. A great ale for Christmas. I will be looking for this one every December!"
"It is a shame this was the last one in my store, otherwise I would buy another :)."
"Drinkability - Relatively so - definitely a sipper. Near the end, as it warms up more, you can taste the alcohol a bit more than at the beginning. Overall a very good ""fireplace"" sipper."
"Overall this beer is becoming one of my favorite Christmas Ales and it is another well crafted ale from the brewers of St. Bernardus. Recommended."
"I'm not sure if the two years of age helped this out, but this beer is in that small group that defines Belgian greatness. Classy stuff."
"Served to me in a Belgian style glass. Appearance was dark, with a huge amount of head which laced extremely well. The nose hasd hints of cherry and a prominent alcohol aroma (not in a bad way, just bold). Taste was a wonderful blend of sweetness, warmth from the alcohol, and complex fruitiness and spice. The high carbonation of this beer really gives it it huge mouthfeel. Given the higher gravity of this beer, I'm impressed with the smooth finish which makes this beer highly drinkable. Overall, one of the better Christmas beers I've had all year!"
"This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with tons of fluffy tan head. It smelled like spicy and sour Belgian yeast with rich caramel, nutmeg, candi sugar, fresh wheat, and a bit of alcohol. It tasted like wild creamy yeast and spicy malt, with some sweet candi sugar and caramel and a bit of raisin and fig and alcohol. It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a bittersweet and sour aftertaste. Overall this had a great dark Belgian scent and taste with a bit of a spicy twist for the holidays. It had good body too, but the alcohol was fairly hot, so a fresh bottle wasn't entirely easy to drink. It was still enjoyable to sip, but it didn't blow me away like Abt 12 first did. Regardless, with some age this would be amazing."
"D: Too easy. Finished the bottle and didnt feel it till much later."
"I'm slowly going off these Belgian Strong Darks, as the sweetness doesn't appeal to me as much as it used to. That said I do think this is a nice example of the style, and would be a definite reccomendation for lovers of good Belgian beer."
"D - This should be had all year, not just at Christmas. Great Belgian dark! Great flavor and mouthfeel. The only downside to the drinkability is the higher abv., and I wouldnt even consider that a downside. Overall another great beer from St. Bernardus!!!"
"D= Really an exceptional beer and easily the best ""Christmas ale"" I have had to date. Dangerously drinkable despite the big ABV."
"Go and buy another bottle of this beer, idiot."
"Flash of toasted malt up front. Estery fruit follows and is quickly joined by a huge swell of sweet, fruity, caramely malts. Sweet Concord grapes blend with sugar-coated raisins, perfectly ripe Bartlett pears, brown sugar, and caramel. Sweet cake batter, toasted nuts, and even a little cocoa lead into the finish. Lingering rummy fruits swell once again in the finish. There's also some yeastiness and a cocoa nib and herbal hop bitterness. Warming. Full-bodied with a thick, gently carbonated feel. Very nice, especially on this 10 degree F night!"
"This beer has plenty of legs and tastes good. It starts off velvety with a slight bit of spice and caramel. It then goes into raisons, toffee, and some winter spices. Being 10%, I would not sit down and drink more than one or two, but this is a beer for the winter months. As far as Christmas beers goes, this is not quite as good as a Corsendonk Christmas, but it does rank high within this category of beers. Merry Christmas!!"
"poured from a corked 750ml bottle in a de koninck ""bolleke"" glass...nice reddish color with about a three-quarter-inch head. quite delicious. beer like this almost makes a chicago winter worthwhile. smells like melting caramel and tastes very malty. i think i detect some coriander notes in there."
"D: Very well balanced, slight alcohol is welcome with body that accompanies."
"Pick it up!!"
"Pours a dark copper brown with an small, dense off-white head. Clumpy retention, minimal lacing. Smell is of dark fruit (fig, prune, raisin) with mulling spice background. Taste is sweet dark fruit (fig, prune, raisin, date) with a mulling spice background. Velvety smooth on the palate with only a minimal alcohol burn. Very nice holiday brew with a full flavor profile without going overboard on any particular ingrediant."
"D: I like more plum and bready flavors in my quads, and they're totally absent in this one. Drain pour."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Small, off-white head sinks into a murky amber body. Aroma is mainly of sweet dark fruits, dates, figs and raisins. Taste is sweet, slightly warming, and includes all of the aforementioned fruits and some peppery spice. ABV is wonderfully hidden behind the loads of flavors in this beer. A truly special and delicious treat. Paired well with Thanksgiving deviled eggs, sweet potatoes and cornbread."
"Poured from tap at Henry's 12th street. Medium head settling to a nice lace. Dark brown hue. Packed with dark malty goodness, and holiday spices, nutmeg, molasses, brown sugar. Yum. Rich flavors of dark malts and said molasses, spices. Medium weight, almost smells and tastes like it needs more body. Smooth, low tannins, very easy on the finish. Good brew, but expect more from this brewery and at this price."
"Note: From a bottle this beer needs to release some carbonation to really shine. Pop it cold and let it outgas and warm before serving. Malt structure is welcomingly light for the ABV yet offers good depth."
"Drinkability: This is really a nice beer for sipping and in many ways is a showcase for the spices and the subtle effects of the noble hops. I'll be looking out for this in the future. As a seasonal treat this is a nice one to have and to serve. If it were not for the ABV I'd have another immediately this one is gone. Based on my experience with St. Bernadus Abt 12 I was expecting a more malt dominant brew as a Christmas seasonal. However, while this beer has malt present there is a very different balance between malt and hops than in the 12. Here the spiciness is never lost in the malt. At first I was not sure I liked this beer but as I have sipped my way slowly through it I find a growing appreciation for the balance of flavors. In addition this one has shown some very nice and interesting changes in flavors as it warmed to room temperature."
"Poured into a goblet for a well carbonated brown body with lasting tan head and bubbly lace. A great yeasty smell along with some sweet caramel malt and minor citric hop bitterness along with orange. Real smooth, a little creamy, medium-bodied with a little bit of oakiness along with minor pepper and spices. Hints of vanilla and chocolate along with caramel give it a balanced sweetness and there is a good fruit base with orange and pear and a little citric notes. Has a dry yet clean finish and the ABV is well hidden. A very enjoyable ale to relax with and sip on."
"Summary: Extremely drinkable beer and thus far my favorite ""Winter Warmer"" to . Will for sure be drinking this one again..."
"that being said, it's not all that impressive, to be honest"
"d- fairly high, good beer overall, not bad for a x-mas release, but I still would take the 12 over this one,"
"Carbonation is just about perfect for this full-bodied brew; it has a pleasant mouthfeel overall. Much more smooth of a drink than I expected from its sharp smell. Cheers!"
"Overall, a wonderful brew. Worth seeking out, a must try."
"I dunno. Belgians brewers just do what they want, eff the style, and I respect that (extreme beer in the USA). Strange and yummy. Quaint step out of the ordinary."
"Amber brown, with a thin light tan head and a scant malty aroma. Full mouth, light chocolate start progressing to caramel with some spice. Sweet, but not too overly so. i'd like to try this one after laying it down for 3 or 4 years - hopefully will become more complex."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and consistent with the style. Drinkability is excellent for such a strong beer, but after a couple you really start to feel it."
"I taste a lot of dark fruit flavors and high lov crystal malts. The raisin malty sweetness tastes fantastic. I don't really know what I expected but it was really a treat. I'll grab another one if I find it again."
"It was poured on-tap into a chimay goblet with the silver edge - looked a nice dark brown/black with very little head likely due to the pour. It smelled terrific - dark and spicy with a fruitiness as well. The taste was also quite good but I expected a little more from the smell. Mouthfeel was merely ok - perhaps slightly more carbonated than I would have expected. Drinkability was good - I would have drank several more of these."
"On tap at Kinsale as part of their Xmas in July weekend. Served in a tulip style glass. Dark orange & reddish color. No real head and doesn't look very carbonated. Smelled a lot like cinnamon and orange peel. Has a definite dubbel taste to it. Lots of ripe fruit and jam. The only thing that surprised me was the mouthfeel. I found this beer very thin and watery. I expected a bit more from such a well know Belgian brewer. It was a nice beer on a cool evening, but not one of my favorite Christmas beers I've ever had. Not hearty enough for a winter themed beer."
"D not the best day for drinking, ""summer"" night in calgary would have been better as a winter warmer (DUH)"
"D-- Very drinkable. Savor this beer on a good cold night. It will keep you warm. I could easily see drinking 2 of these puppies and still wanting more. A classic example of a good Christmas Ale. Very well done. Too bad it is July and I am in Sydney, Australia."
"Damn. First Lost Abbey Angel's Share Brandy last night , 750 corked, flat. Tonight, this one, completely flat too. Both have great taste, but without carbonation, it's like saltines without the salt. I am not going to even bother drinking it. Need a food recipe to use it...."
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a super large foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry fruit and fruity ester with some candi sugar and some nicer Belgian malt. Taste is a well balanced mix between some fruity ester, some dry fruits such as figs and notes of Belgian malt. Body is full with great carbonation and no appearance of alcohol. Very well done though it probably fell short of the ABT 12."
"Caramel/copper body with a frothy head. Sweet raisins, spiced stone fruits, and a little funk. The palate is sweet caramelized sugars, raisins, figs, spice, earthy yeast, alcohol, and a bitter finish. The body is medium and finish dry. Good brew from one of the top Belgian brewers. Like ABT 12, but maybe a touch more sweetness."
"Dark amber in color with reddish tint. Thick frothy head and a little bit volatile. Sweet malty nose with fruity and floral hints. Fruity malt attack with a sweetness like licorice. Very malty. The malt is so strong that it presents as a sweet beer even though it is isn't sweet in a sugar sense. The body is sufficient to carry the 10 percent alcohol which is impressive by itself. Clean finish with lingering malty aftertaste. Some spicy notes and an effervescent type of feel to it."
"As it breathed, the carbonation settled down a little and made for a very nice treat. Just lovely balanced flavors, no hint of the lurking 10%. This was a very enjoyable beer, and i'm anxious to see was 2 years on one of these would do."
"Poured a cloudy dark amber color with a dirty white head and good carbonation. Nose is malt, yeast, driedf fruits, spiciness and candy. Taste was of malt, caramel and candy with the added spice. Finish was nice, not as boozy as the 10% ABV leads you to believe. Good brew overall."
"Drinkability: Wish I had more of this. The little 4oz. sampler wasn't enough. Really tasty, but I could see this one being very hard to finish on one's own. The carbonation, spice, and body may get to ya."
"D- This is definitely a slow drinker here. Perfect for the cold holiday season."
"Drinkability: this one goes down quickly despite the high alcohol levels. A few of these could be consumed in a session, but you will be feeling it quickly."
"D - Very drinkable for a couple of bears, but the spicy flavors would wear on your after a few."
"Tasty beer, very rich. Good after dinner sipper."
"Drinkability: A pretty awesome beer, St. Bernardus or not. A lot to admire, which I wasn't surprised about. It's fairly expensive, but certainly worth it, especially for a beyond-great holiday brew to share with friends and family. I can't think of a better one to drink at Christmas really at this point, and I can't believe it's taken me this long to get to it."
"A bit too sweet to drink a whole lot of, but very rich and complex. Definitely a solid and genuine Belgian strong."
"This is a very, very good example of a Belgian beer and if you have any remote interest in the style then you'll love this one."
"Not my favorite St B, but good on a cold night with the fire going."
"This Ale was worth the price and is worthy of being opened any time of year despite it's name."
"It's not as multi-dimensional and smooth as many St. Bernardus offerings, but it says Happy Holidays in a bold, auspicious manner. In fact, it's the almost obnoxiously prevalent ABV, searing and blearing, that holds things back a bit. And yet, despite the intimidation factor, I'm happier at the end of the bottle than at the beginning, and that's in a good way."
"Taste: Again, light malt with a bit of date. A hint of some medicinal herbs and has an ethanolic finish."
"It tastes like the nose with a bit hit of not overdone sweetness at the end, very complex, spicy, with intriguing aftertaste."
"this brew pours up a red tinted brown color with a nice frothy off white head. great lacing. the nose is red apple, faint candy sugar, sweet malts, caramel, pear. the taste is very sweet, dark cherries, yeast, chewy malts. medium bodied and medium carbo. I like Belgium Holiday Ales because they generally don't have a set taste and they are all different. A solid beer."
"The body is closer to moderate but a bit much for a Belgium holiday beer. Some heat from the alcohol. Overall good but very muddled together. Would have liked to see the spice back off and more Belgian characteristics come out."
"Pours a huge, active, frothy tannish colored head, with big bubbles. Body is a dark brown color, can't see through at all. Very floral, sweet smelling nose. Dark fruit like plum or grape. Some spiciness too, and a little bit of alcohol. Not an overpowering aroma. sweet spicy, effervescent aftertaste, not too drying, thirst-quenching. A fruity taste, somewhat dark, but some light fruit present too, like pear and banana. Nice winter spices. Carbonated palate, somewhat creamy. Not too bad, tasty for a spiced brew. Even tastier as it warms."
"Mmmm...not quite what I was expecting from a ""Holiday"" (grr..Christmas) Ale. But thanks to Christopher's in Cambridge & St. Bernardus, I can expand my expectations of such! It was lovely to find this gem on draught, served proper, glassware & all. Served up dark & mysterious with a thin, lacey head that soon disappeared, a grape-malt & lavender aroma pervaded, but not tacky or overwhelmingly so. The color showed in the light as a dark purple-brown and an intial alchol nose upon sipping soon opened to a chewy dunkelweiss with grape hints in a Belgian lambic style. Quite a lovely sipping & savoring ale (& quite potent!)."
"D - Won't buy this one again, but was fun to try nonetheless. If friends have it, I'd give it another go, but I was underwhelmed this time."
"D- At first I didn't really get this beer- it seemed to be a high alcohol Belgian w/ lots of banana. But after reviewing it I began to enjoy the complexity of the taste and mouthfeel more. While I wouldn't rate it as my favorite Holiday beer it is certainly good, and probably were I in a colder climate during January I would like it even more (I bet it's great in front a fire as the label advertises."
"D: Full drinks make the most of this one, but 10% abv dictates some time in between."
"Good brew."
"Overall one of, if not thee best beer I've had that has called itself a ""Christmas"" beer or ale. Can't wait till next year!"
"D: 10% ABV is not for the faint of heart, but the huge and delicious flavors do a pretty good job of hiding it, to a point."
"D: Wow, for a strong Belgian ale it just does not get any more drinkable than this. Very good with the alcohol well hidden."
"This is a fantastic beer. Tons of deep flavors, almost too easy to drink, begging you to take another sip, and the high ABV does not overwhelm amongst the various flavors."
"D - This is a sipper. Quite sweet so limiting to one would probably be wise."
"Drinkability- Without the metallic note it's very good. Not quite up to their flagship, but could be almost as good. With the note it's slightly annoying and better than average."
"This was less than expected for the brewery. I tend to prefer the non-spiced winter beers, but this one - well...doesn't really do it for me. Nice, but expected better from this brewery."
"Pours a dark brown in color with no clarity. Head is an off white/brown and thick. Aroma is some malts, fruit and slight hops. Very sweet. Sweet taste with some malts and hops. Lots of spice and very fruity. Excellent texture and body but not heavy. An excellent session beer especially around the holidays."
"It really doesn't get much better than this. I'd been looking forward to the bottle for a long time, and it does not dissapoint."
"D: I had been saving this one for a few weeks to cap off Christmas night. Very drinkable and a great offering for the holiday season. Complex and first rate beer."
"This is one good beer. Why oh why deer lord would this only be available at Christmas. I guess that answers it's own question. The lord is no fool. Beautiful mud pour. Nice head. Aroma of wine. Taste is sweet then sour and then just good. Heavy alcohol makes it a bit tough to drink when driving. Otherwise down it goes."
"I've always been a big fan of St. Bernardus, so I was expecting a great beer and it delivered. One of the best holiday beers I've had recently. Highly recommended!"
"St. Bernardus Christmas Ale manages to capture the spirit of the season with a spiciness whose origins are a mystery. It probably won't be everyone's cup of ale, but I'm having a great time sipping and savoring. What a wonderful beer to cap off Christmas 2008 in style."
"Recommended..."
"An OK beer. I've had better Belgians."
"Brouwerij St. Bernardus is one of those special breweries that really can't make a bad beer. I was on the fence a little with this one as far as flavor goes. At the end of the day, it grew on me enough to warrant a 4.5 score for taste. It is that good. The nose could be a little better, but this is a damn fine beer all the same. It certainly warrants an annual purchase. Definitely recommended."
"I might go buy another bottle to let age in the cellar to find out how well this ages for next year."
"This was tasty, but a bit too sweet for me to have too much of."
"Pours a murky chestnut brown, slight reddish highlights when held to light, and an absolutely gigantic foamy beige head, settles extremely slowly and leaves big clumps of lacing on the glass. Lots of spicy dark fruits on the nose, raisin, plum, fig, and big Belgian yeast aromas. Taste follows right along, some belly-warming alcohol, slightly earthy character to the beer as well. Really, I'm having a hard time imagining anything more enjoyable to sip on during a freezing snowy night, with the holidays right around the corner. Absolutely delicious."
"Overall a great beer."
"Great stuff. I need to get some more."
"D: This is a solid effort from St. Bernardus, a brewery that seems incapable of making a bad beer."
"D - Real good, despite thinness, but the nose and taste this a great beer."
"Expect to get a little warm and twisted off winter sessions due to higher ABV,but I had four glasses in a four hour span and certainly could have had more."
"This comes out of the tap an opaque dark brown with a thick pale tan head. Aroma is very hoppy and spicy, inviting a taste. Flavor does not disappoint - it is mainly hoppy with spicy overtones and a spicy, evergreen aftertaste. Texture is very smooth and cooling. An excellent winter brew."
"D: All winter long. Enjoy this slowly and relish."
"Creamy with a mild sweetness and the archetypical Belgian flavor from the yeast. Alcohol is potent and adds to the rich body. The swallow has a faint touch of hop, but it's a predominantly sour malt flavor. The aftertaste is brief."
"Overall, I am not a huge fan of the Christmas styles, but this one is a one of a kind, not to be missed, outstanding beer!!!"
"On-tap at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Overall, this is a pretty good Belgian, but it's not as complex at the Abt 12. It actually reminds me of Chimay Blue more than Bernardus 12. The flavor comes off like a cinnamon spice caramel apple with toasted toffee and sweet bread. Delicious, but it doesn't reach the depths of a great strong dark ale. Still very easy to drink. Worth a try."
"Wonderful drinkability here. Too bad this only comes out once a year."
"Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is complimented by the creaminess of the head and the figgy flavors. Full flavored, this is textbook to style...the Belgian malty fruit thing is center stage... the mouth feel is creamy and much heavier than your everyday abbey ale. The 10% ABV is well integrated. I personally HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one as part of your holiday festivities!! Another High Quality product from Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV."
"This is a jovial holiday concoction. It's more or less like a fruitier, spiced 12."
"D - Very good but spicier and sweeter than other St Bernardus offerings making it just slightly less drinkable."
"Pours a murky amber to brown-ish color with a big light tan head. In the aroma, candy sugar, small roastiness, cinnamon, and nutmeg. In the taste, cinnamon, a dry sugary feel, and small hints of plum (as sugar plums danced in my head, sorry...) A small spicey bite, and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon/ spice aftertaste. Quite smooth and not overbarring, nice spices, all around pretty good."
"This is a great winter brew. Highly recommended, and something I will have more of."
"75cL bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a hazy but still translucent dark copper with a half inch of light tan head. Smells intensely fruity and spicy, with banana, nut, and chocolate notes. Tastes fruity, chocolatey, and spicy, with an underlying toastiness. Banana, nut, cherry, dates, and cloves all play nearly equal roles. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with ample carbonation. More of a sipper, though one sip most definitely invites another and this beer was gone long before I wanted it to be. Wow. Quite possibly the best beer this brewery makes, a phenomenal Christmas beer, and one of the most flavorful and complex beers I've had all year. Amazing!"
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a muddy dark brown with a thick tan head that sticks around until the liquid is gone. Great thick lacing. Aroma is very deep, with fig, overripe plum, green apple, caramelized orange peel, ginger, phenols, and a touch of saccharine cola. Flavor is a little more straightforward. Rummy raisins, orange peel, ginger, and licorice. Alcohol and carbonation are a bit too apparent and so this beer is not particularly drinkable, but it is a nice warming winter treat to share."
"D: It was rather difficult for me to down my chalice-full of this beer. This beer is 10% ABV and doesn't hide it in the least. The heat from the alcohol makes it difficult to drink and detracts from some of the flavors that otherwise may emerge. I sampled on-tap, but I think getting a bottle of this and sitting on it for a year may do it some good."
"A MUST-HAVE for the holidays!!"
"I highley recommend this one for the holidays."
"Notes: Merry Christmas to me!"
"overall a good beer but slightly overrated, too much carbonation and needs to be a little thicker for my liking."
"Good, but not great."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, roasted and crystal malt scent along with a fruity yeast aroma. It's warming to the nose with loads of fruity esters. The taste is good as well. It has a solid malt bill of crystal and roasted malts. It's complex with a warm fruity finish. The alcohol is right up front. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine seasonal. It's full flavored and warming; just what I want in the colder months of the year"
"I had this on tap at Monk's and in a 25oz bottle, and it's consistently incredible. Grab a bottle of this while it's around. You could session with this if you pace yourself."
"Will I get more? I'd bet on that."
"Overall this is a very good beer that everyone should try this time of the year."
"another good beer by st bernardus"
"Very drinkable! Not as heavy as most holiday beers!"
"Very nice addition to the Bernardus lineup."
"Drink/Overall: I'm certainly glad I tried it. Well worth a taste-testing. Certainly a high quality beer. I have had my bottle for this holiday season, and I can see how it might be one-bottle-worthy for each new holiday season."
"Head is a bit thin, but the beer is a rich rosewood color. Nose of dark candy malts, ripe fruit, christmas spices, and Belgian yeasts. The taste is sweet and malt strong but well balanced by the spices and herbal, peppery yeasts. Full body and perfect carbonation. Never a bad beer from Bernardus."
"Not a bad beer, but not my favorite. Too sweet for me...worth checking out if that's what you're into."
"Pours a dark ruby/ chestnut brown with thick, slightly beige head. Pleasant aroma consisting of cherries, dark fruits, chocolate, cinnamon spice and alcohol. Very smooth drinking and surprising amount of fruit. Cherries, plum, sugar cane, dark berries and peppery cinnamon taste. Dry finish with a nice alcohol warmth. A very nice balance of maltiness, spiciness, fruit and alcohol. Very tasty!"
"D: one of the smoother beers and nicest christmas ales I have had. It was complimenting the cool brisk day we had and warmed me up real nice and fuzzy like. Try it and love it!"
"D - Pretty easy to drink and very enjoyable"
"Bomber, caged and corked, best before date etched on the bottom of the bottle (sometime in 2012) Pours dark dark brown, initially under a huge head, that slowly recedes , leaving gobs of heavy lace all over the glass. Cola and raisin nose, prickly carbonation, lots of character and cola, dark fruits, yeasty goodness and alcohol all swimming around. Let it warm up, let the flavors open up and savor this flavorful Belgian beauty"
"D: This is a very nice xmas beer, complex, yet drinkable, another excellent brew from St. Bernardus, a must for any belgain fan"
"get another St. Bernardus offering in the mix."
"Drinkability- Quite good. I will probably pick up a couple of bottles and save them for next year. Give them a couple of good shakes to get the yeast going again."
"Overall - I was highly impressed with this offering from St. Bernardus. Quite different than what I expected from a holiday beer, almost like a Chimay Blue but less fruity. Candi sugar and caramel malts prevail and make for a sweet ride throughout the experience, yet it is well balanced with slight hop notes. For $8.50/12 oz, it was definitely worth every drop. I would like a few bottles to cellar and see how it turns out next year. An excellent accompaniment for a fireside chat after a nice holiday dinner. Highly recommended."
"D: St. Bernardus once again makes a fantastic beer that needs to be sampled by all."
"Deceptively drinkable, plus a great starter ale for the style, it's user-friendly and not intimidating. Perfect for sharing at holiday gatherings as well."
"A very nice beer. Not all that different from the regular abt 12, but quite delicious nonetheless. Don't see any previous reviews of this beer on draft, so I'm assuming this may be the first year for this beer to be released in that format. Good stuff."
"Poured into my new St. Bernardus Watou Over Sized Wine Glass, the color is a nice brown/amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus foamy light tan color, with some nice small islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malyt, nice touch of yeast, figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, nice tones of dark fruit. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from St. Bernardus."
"Drinkability - I prefer the Abt 12, but this is one I can look forward to trying again come Christmas time. Would make a heavenly sipper on Christmas eve or night, shared with the family celebrating the holidays."
"D: This is one of the best Christmas beers i've had. It's very complex but very enjoyable. If you love Belgians and the christmas beer style then this ones a must. I hope we get this close to Louisiana. I'll definitely crack one of these come December 25th."
"The only thing bad I have to say about this beer is that I didn't buy enough, so now my wife and I will have to wait until next year for more."
"Taste is controlled by the load of fruits but not entirely sweet, some yeastiness, can make out some alcohol tones, way too carbonated, every sip and drink turns into foam in my mouth and becomes a bit distracting."
"Similar to St. Bernardus in many ways, this one will probably age beautifully, would drink again, hopefully it is released again next holiday season, recommended"
"God bless St Bernardus, they make some fine beers!"
"D: There was a lot of carbonation in the beer. Making it challenging to really enjoy the full taste of the beer."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours dark brown with an inch and a half frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, cinnamon, bread, yeast, pepper, cloves, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a good bit of alcohol/booze and also a slight metallic taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium with high carbonation. Way too much carbonation for my taste. This hurts the drinkability for me. The high carbonation makes this brew hard to drink, it feels like I'm drinking bubbles and not liquid. Overall it's a decent brew, but would be much better if the carbonation was cut down some. It looks good and tastes good, but it's not easy to drink at all."
"D: The abv is high but the flavor profile makes up for it. I only bought one bottle, so I will have to sit patiently until next Christmas."
"Damn drinkable. After tasting this I am even more pissed that I was not able to get this into Nebraska this winter. Next year, for sure! This beer really hit the spot with me. Honestly, this might be my favorite St. Bernardus beer. Damn, damn tasty. Thanks Bill!"
"Pours a cloudy orange/brown, big and loose off white head forms, settles to a thin layer, leaves behind some decent lace. Smell is caramel, cinnamon, bread, yeast, apples, alcohol, pretty rich aroma, nice. Taste is raisins, caramel, spices, bread, quite sweet, apples and spice in the finish, touch of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overly sweet, carbonation was a little too high, made it kind of prickly. Overall okay but I was expecting more from this. Thanks Lexx!"
"Great going down the pipes and easy to drink. A little carbonation for the bite with a mix of an alcohol taste. If you let it rest on your palate you will truly respect the flavor in this beer and the message that it sends to your brain when you drink it. It is a great holiday treat and it is very stimulating for relaxing the mind after a long week of work."
"Good stuff."
"Poured into a chalice. The beer had a nice, tan two inch head on it that seemed to last an eternity. It was a beautiful shade of mahogony brown. Smell seemed very bready with a hint of maybe figs and...raisins? The taste had a lot of alcohol. Alcohol was the first thing that I could tast and the last. In between, were the flavors of figs, a faint taste of anise, more bread and a hint of toffee. Overall, a very nice beer to wrap up to on a very cold evening. It did seem a little hot, but over the course of the bottle (and as it warmed to room temp), it seemed to mellow out quite a bit."
"Pours brown in color with a huge off-white head. The head was at least 2 inches and took several minutes to fall to a froth. Smell is belgian yeast and some dark fruit, figs. I'm not really getting a lot of christmas spice or taste in this. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, very nice. A decent beer, but I couldn't help but to get something metallic out of the taste."
"2007. Good Looking muddy brown brew with a slight orange tinge. Head pours large and stays pretty well. Head is an off-white tan in color, creamy smooth in texture, and has nice lacing. Aroma is complex with cirtus hoppy-ness coming throught the most. Allspice and a light yeasty-dough aroma is second, followed by many other smells including chocolate, apple, and possibly even red wine. Flavor was pleasent, starting on the sweetish side and over a long duration finishing ever so slightly bitter-sour with defined fruit undertones. Medium in body with a lively carbonated but creamy texture, the overall mouth feel is clearly the best part of this brew. Pretty good stuff."
"D-One of my least favorite of St. B lot...not horrible but certainly not in the same ballpark as some of my favorites of theirs. Too much air, heat, and a little heavy on the black licorice/ginger snap taste too..."
"Clear, coppery red hue with burnt orange edges and a billowing, fluffy cap of beige foam. Great head retention with chunky clumps of foam sticking to the glass at first, then some spotty lacing later. Great aroma - figs and prunes, apple, cinnamon, bready and yeasty, floral hops, bubblegum, pear, and mild medicinal alcohol. Sweet with some warm alcohol up front, dried fruit in the middle, with bread crust towards the end. It finished with a flash of gingerbread and lingering peppery alcohol. Medium to full bodied with very high carbonation. Palate coating with a bit of slickness and warmth. A great winter warmer with pleasing fruity notes. I'm betting this will age gracefully."
"A good, OK, a very good beer. In my mind, I think I would rather have the plain old ""normal"" St. Bernardus lineup than this special brew, but that's just me. Recommended."
"D - I expected a big beer, but this is huge. Very complex, with a very nice, wintry roasted quality. Not exactly an easily drinkable beer, but my overall impression is very favorable. Considering the complexity and the high alcohol content, I am inclined to think that this would age very well. I also think that with its smokey tobacco flavors, this is one of the few beers I have had that could really stand up to a good cigar."
"St. Bernardus Christmas Ale pours a mahogany brown with a huge tan head from a brown 750 ml bottle. The aroma is spicy. The taste is also quite spicy, almost a wintergreen like flavor, but not as strong. Spice definitely dominates the flavor, but dark fruits are also present. A very enjoyable Christmas beer, definitely worth a try."
"Overall a very good beer. It's no anniversary or abt 12, but still... worth every penny for a solid St. Bernardus."
"Dark mahogany body. Thick crop of beige head. It sticks around forever, though it does diminish ever so slightly creating a rocky landscape on top of the nectar. Very inviting nose. Subtly, yet very pleasing to the sense of smell. Doughy yeastiness with bready malts and cinnamon spiciness blend to give the warm aroma of comfort. Biscuity malt base serves nicely for the layers of complexity on top. Spice tones intermingle with fruits and candy. Light alcoholic tones are present to create a little warmth. Body is light-medium and the carbonation lends an ever so sublte effervescence to the whole experience. This is quite enjoyable and I'm not exactly surprised being that it comes from my favorite Belgian Brewery."
"Very foamy pour. I had to use a 3rd glass due to rapid head building, even pouring very slowly Tan head is very rocky with small bbublles grading to large bubbles at the top. Body is slighly murky dark chocolate color with very active carbonation. Leaves bubbly, spidery lace. Rich and malty aroma with spice, herbs, and a little fruit (apple). Maybe a hint of chocolate and a bit of alcohol smell as well. Big malt IF with slightly acidic finish that is long lived, slowly mellowing to a pleasant bitterness on the tongue. Full bodied with creamy texture and an alcoholic finish. Overall, this is a great slow taster wthat is at once big and very drinkable."
"Muddy bronze color with a goofy head. Aromas of bubble gum and cough medicine (not in a bad way). The flavors were of raisins (""purple"" popsicle from childhood) and some yeast and candi sugar. This may be good after a year in the basement for next Christmas, but I'll take the Abt 12 first."
"Pours a clouded dark brown with a good sized creme head that leaves a decent amount of lacing on the way down. Nose is spices and yeast. Flavor is extremely heavy on the spices. Just buckets and buckets of them. Dough rests in the background. Carbonation is extremely full and attacks the tongue. Liquid is as it should be. This is definitely a winter style brew. It is so spice forward and heavy on the body that it is to be sipped and savored over time. A nice brew for sure."
"One of the nicest Christmas beers I had this year. I'm really glad that St. Bernardus decided to make and bottle this brew. It is still a little sharp, I think a little time in the bottle will smooth out the edges. Nevertheless, it is still delicious now. Pours a beautiful dark brown with a batter like head- big, thick, and creamy and which leaves excellent lacing. Aromas of sweet malt, banana, alcohol, and cookie dough. Well carbonated with flavors of pffefernuse- black pepper, clove, cinnamon, coriander, and cookie dough. Not overly sweet, in fact there is a dry somewhat astringent bitterness throughout that nicely offsets the spice cookie flavors. Delicious! Mouthfeel is carbonated, full, spicy, and creamy. Drinkability should improve with a few more months in the cellar. A great addition to the Belgian winter repertoire."
"I will be adding this to the winter lineup every year."
"Not bad, but I'm not sure it's anything I'll pick up again unless it's on sale."
"Drinkability  This is a terrific addition to the St Bernie inventory. It's a wonderful wintertime specialty ale."
"D  This is a very nice Christmas Ale. It is quite a lot to handle in one sitting. I might have to pick up another and cellar it (the bottle claims it can be cellared for up to 15 years)."
"Warming alcohol. Frothy carbonation gives this a medium body feel. A big beer, with layers of character. Very nice."
"This was a damn nice beer. Not surprisingly it was rather complex yet very well balanced. A great beer that would be perfect to take the chill off any beer lover. That said, I do think this would (as the bottle indicates) benefit from a few years (well, maybe more than a few) of cellaring to round it off and soften those edges. They suggest up to 15 years. Not sure I could wait that long, but I do think a few years would definitely reward the cellarer (cellarer?) with a more robust, full beer.It would take a very, very strong cheese to hold up to this. A great Belgian winter ale, definitely recommenced & strongly suggested as a cellaring candidate....but definitely worth at least one bottle's worth of enjoyment now."
"Mouthfeel is medium full and lingering of raisins, fig newtons, fennel, sweet nougat, caramel, and pine needels."
"D: Good drinkability due to the fact that the alcohol is nowhere to be found, especially for a 10% brew. This was a good offering but I think that this one will likely get better with a little aging."
"This offering from St. Bernardus pours a delicious dark brown leaving a thick tan head that is frothy and typical from the previous offerings from St.Bernardus. The aroma is very fruity, plums, figs, dates, brown sugar, sweet earthy spices and dark pitted fruit. There is also a faint sour fruit aspect in the back of this brew but nothing over powering. The taste starts matly, fruit, brown sugar, spiced seasoning, just a fantastic array of flavors and aromas massaging the palate. The finish is slightly tart on the back of the throat, hard to make out any specific christmas spices in this brew but that doesn't matter to me. A quality brew made for sipping at 10% abv the alcohol presence is barely visible well hidden in this beer."
"Drank this one after everyone left on Christmas Day. Good way to finish the holidays."
"The taste is similar to the aroma. Very spicy, more so than their other beers, seems as though there is a touch of cinnamon to go along with the clove and ginger. A very fruity and banana-like yeast presence. Nice beer, and a nice way to enjoy Christmas. Not my favorite of their beers with all of the spice that brings the drinkability down some."
"Carbonation is high but with a couple swirls it becomes less prickly and lets the body of the beer shine. This was quite the treat. So complex and drinkable: a perfect winter companion."
"Drinkability: A fine holiday sipper (regardless of the 10% ABV) that made for pleasant Christmas Day drinking."
"Christmas Eve seemed an appropriate time top open this beer. It was very dark brown with a white head and the bubbles seemed really compacted together. It smelled like slight herbal mints, whiff of chocolate (barely detectable), and raisins. The flavor was raisin and plum-like. Decent stuff but the 10.5 ABV knocked me down."
"Drinkability is not good for me wouldn't want to try this one again. Find this a problem with Belgians sometimes, just too much CO2 for my tastes. Looked great smelled great first sip ruined it for me, as I finished the bottle CO2 did mellow some what but still too much for me, wanted to like it but."
"12/25 edit - This left me with probably my biggest hangover of the year. I don't know what the deal is....it's not as if I've never had a 750 of strong beer to myself. Be careful with this one."
"A very good brew, but not spectacular as I expected from St Bernardus."
"Murky brown in appearance. A very dense, thick off white head. Pillow like sticky lacing, that hangs around. Aromas of raisins, tons of other dark fruits, and spices. Well blended flavors of dark fruits, tart grape, candied sugar, mild chocolate, and some spices of clove and cinnamon. Finishes with some warming alcohol. Mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Highly carbonated, very fizzy. Drinkability is excellent and very enjoyable. Very similar to Abt 12. If you like boozy beers, then this one's for you. CHEERS!"
"The perfect looking Belgian brew, deep, murky brown with dark ruby highlights and a great, thick retaining head. The only thing that its look is lacking is the bubbling. The aroma is very Belgian and awesome in that sense, but not very Christmasy. Makes me think of figs and sweet bread. The taste is very pretty sweet and complex. Lots of brown sugar with some with a few spices. Hints of clove and cinnamon. But just not as seasonal as expected."
"Well two days till Christmas so time to pop the cork on this one. The bottle poured ruby red with a large billowy light coco brown head. Aromas of Belgium yeast, fruit and spices (cinnamon, ginger and clove) filled my nose. This ale has a full creamy mouth feel with carbonation that tickles the tongue. The first thing I noticed about the Flavors was sweet fruit figs and raisins with a nice balance of Christmas spices. A nice bitter finish that is not to over whelming, almost the typical peppery bite. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this beer will sneak up on you. Great holiday offering from St. Bernardus hope to find another one for next year."
"Drinkability: Too sweet and spicy."
"D: Im conflicted. This beer needs some time to lay down but I fear that the spices will be lost. Well, its way too hot now but Im reviewing it for what it is. Its taking me a while to get through it. And as the flavor is good, its horribly unbalanced right now."
"Deeply malty flavors with light fruit and nuttiness. A bit too sweet for my taste, but it's not overdone. Dry finish hints at the high abv, but it's hidden in the taste. I'm happy that I shared this at a holiday party instead of trying to drink the whole thing myself."
"Another beer of the highest quality from St. Bernardus. Of course that's to be expected. This beer has some really nice Christmas spicing."
"Overall, this is a solid beer, but not as good as I expected it to be. Compared to the Abt. 12 the alcohol is more noticable and it is less complex. That being said, it was still tasty and easy to drink."
"Wow! Great stuff! No big surprise really. St. B knows how to impress and this is perfect for the holidays!"
"Not a bad beer, but i think I expected a little better from St. B. Not the hilight of the season."
"Served at cellar temp."
"D- Smooth and balanced strong ale, milder spice flavors and lively carbonation contribute to a unique taste profile, very easy-drinking but best enjoyed sipping slowly on a cold night"
"D - wow. This is a fine, fine beer (would you expect anything else?), but I think more than 1 750 mL of this would be crazy. Luckily I split mine with my gf, and I think 1 glass will be enough. Really enjoyable and warming me up nicely. Highly recommended for the holidays!"
"The beer was dark brown with a thick head, but lacked the floaties from ABT 12 and the creaminess in the foam that ABT 12 provides. Still looked OK, just closer ot the Prior 8 in appearance. The aroma was the signature yeastie fruitiness, but with a hint of spice I haven't noticed in the sibling beers. This spice came through in the flavor as a peppery note, a little biting, I'm not sure how to record it except ""cracked pepper"". Very nice, definitely you'd know in a blind taste test who made it, but you'd also know it was a little different. Highly recommended, along with all their other beers."
"This is another prodigious offering from St. Bernardus. This pours a deep brown with a frothy, thick, dark head that plumes on the sides of the glass and leaves tons of lacing. The beer also retains quite well with soapy head still lingering in my fluted glass well after I've had a few sips. The smell is sweet malts, candied sugars, yeastiness, Xmas spices, such as nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange rind. The carbonation of this beer will keep you burping and then some. This is a medium bodied beer that hits all the right notes. The taste is very Belgian throughout, you'll get the candied sugars, malty sweetness, spices, yeasty bite, and the sweet caramel and butterscotch flavors. The high ABV is masked over quite well, although there are some warming alcohol notes that arise towards the end. The aftertaste is very modest, all things considered. This one is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim"
"A 750ml bottle poured into a goblet. Medium brown color with red highlights. A very thick tan head, almost the appearance of whipped cream. Nice aroma of dark fruit and some sugar. Similar taste, but there was also a pronounced spiciness that lingered really well. A great after dinner sipping beer."
"Overall, recommended. While not my favorite from St. Bernardus, it is still very tasty - and very drinkable."
"a good beverage, warming, alcoholic, spicy, a blast of pepper and malt, and somehow not quite what I expected from St. BErnardus...a bit less, a wee bit....there;s burnished cherries, there's raisins, and dates, and more...."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson, AZ"
"I'm going to save a bottle for next Christmas, this should hold up really well."
"70ml corked and caged bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a dark brown color with a large tan head with excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is sweet malt, dark fruits, spices and yeast. The taste is sweet malt and an array of spices with a rather dry, spicy and boozy finish. Overall, this is another good beer from St Bernardus. I am curious to see how this one ages, it should improve greatly with a little more time."
"Poured a rich dirty brown into goblets, with a spotty dark head; lacing lasted through to the end. Piney smell, and the taste was full of spices. A touch of bitterness showed through, perhaps making it taste even more like Christmas. I poured it chilled initially and wasn't very impressed, but it improved tremendously as it warmed up a bit. Great to have by the fire during the holiday season, and the bottle size makes it nice to share with friends/family."
"D: Alcohol barely makes its' presence felt in either aroma or taste, but boy does it ever warm the cheeks! This is friggin' Christmas in a bottle!"
"D- St. Bernys has yet to let me down and once again they pull off another great beer. Wish you could find this in Vegas. I would love to have a few of these closer to Christmas. Also I think it would be great with a year or two on it."
"One fine specimen. Rich with tingly carbonation and a good amount of acidity. Really lively on the tongue. Full of fig notes with a bit of carmelized pear, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Great balance with a bitterness on the finish. Spicey belgian qualities and a yeasty finish but not overly done. Good amounts of alcohol on the finish in the chest as well. A definite winner."
"Drinkability  This is a terrific addition to the St Bernie inventory. It's a wonderful wintertime specialty ale."
"This is a fantastic beer, but one for the evening is plenty."
"D: I think I have found the ultimate beer to pair with pumpkin pie in this one. Full of rich, complex, dark flavours, St. Bernardus Christmas Ale is a world-class Yule beer made by one of the best producers in Belgium. I really liked this beer."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Dark dried fruits, caramel, a bit of molasses. Dry and spicy in the finish with a greater hop presence than I was expecting. Crisp but soft carbonation similar to other St. Bernardus brews. This is nice, but I think it will drink better with 5 or 6 months on it. Recommended."
"hazy reddish brown w/ tons of bubbles and huge off white head. great belgian lace and great retention. I was surprised by the hop character that was really really present in the nose. i imagine that will mellow out with time, and i am exited to see how this will tate next year. nose was musty, earthy hops, malt, spice (cinnamon, ginger?) dark fruit and booze. taste was dark fruit, roast, spice, hops and hints of booze. in both the nose and the taste, i could detect something new every pass. i think this one needs a little time, but the full body (which seems lighter because of the heavy carbonation) is smooth, and this is another solid solid beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark amber color and formed a very airy large head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast and candy. The flavor was of malt, caramel and candy. Fairly light compared to other styles by this brewery. The finish was quite sprite. Not a bad beer, but not up to the others from the brewery. Aging may help this one to improve."
"Caged 750 with a loud pop upon opening, poured heavy into a St. Bernardus glass. Massive tan head that slowly dissipates to a pillow cover. Very large bubbles. Color is murky brown... typical, but nice. Leaves icicle like lacing around the sides. Even though the bottle suggests drinking this a bit cold for the style, I'd really recommend letting this one warm up a bit. I was SLIGHTLY disappointed when I first cracked this one,but now with a little more than a half left in the bottle, at a warmer temp... This is a fantastic beer. Glad I bought a few bottles! Nice addition the Bernardus line-up."
"Rather carbonated, but it's the nice small bubble thick carbonation I've grown to love that leaves a velvet mouthfeel with just a bit of a bite. I rate this high on drinkability because I think I could sit around and sip on this all night long. It's not drinkable in the usual sense of the word but being so highly enjoyable you don't want your glass to ever empty."
"A good beer, but pales in comparison with its other illustrious brethren. Not a fair standard I suppose, since most other beers do as well."
"The beer is very carbonated, maybe a little too much since it stings a bit as it rests on the tongue. I feel that the carbonation imparts a bit on the flavors, it would be a little easier to detect more flavors with less carbonation. Let this one get to room temp. though, it gets a little better and less carbonation sting."
