"Probably not my favorite beer simply because it's not my favorite style, but no doubt one of the best I've ever had - wonderfully done."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - It would be nice to have a little bit less boozy flavor (although it fades a bit as the beer warms up) to taste all the other nice things happening, but otherwise a great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Subtly sweet, very boozy.... Interesting flavors.  This one definitely grows on you"

"Brew pours a pretty hazy amber in color with a good 3+-finger foamy off-white head. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. Lots going on with the aroma as there is burnt brown sugar, spices (cloves and pepper?) with some dark fruit overtones. More going on with the taste as the cloves and spices are right up front along with the brunt brown sugar sweetness with a hint of caramel and yeast in the mix along with some plums/raisins and really not as sweet as you might think. Actually finishes pretty smooth without tasting the alcohol, though you know it is in there. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, you won't get to 'the sixth glass' as you would be pretty well blitzed by then I would think. Overall a tasty brew."

"It's magical... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HSVN3lijfdA"
"O – An interesting beer, as it is still very sweet despite its dryness and high attenuation.  I like the saison-like peppery notes a lot.  Very complex but still very accessible/drinkable."
"Pours a very dark burnt orange, with a thick sand colored head.  Lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass; ruby tones and crystal clear after pouring first half of bottle, the butt of the bottle introduced healthy sized clumps of sediment.  Mostly dark fruit on the nose, prunes, cherries, a heavy biscuit flavor, toffee.  Best by 8/22/2015 and still getting some heat from the booze, fruity yeast, toffee, full bodied and extremely carbonated.  Toffee comes out in the taste, as well, with a nutty/raisiny aftertaste."
""
"OVERALL:  An impressive take on the style, and very respectable. Dry yet almost creamy, and smooth as you'll get for the strength.  Enjoyable and fun to drink, and from Boulevard, another feather in the cap so to speak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Too boozy, a sipping beer."
""
""
"EDIT: Tasty beer burps, too"
""
""
""

"A good brew..wouldn't  call it world class ."

"Definitely lacked the complexity of a true quad but was not bad. A little to sweet for me but still loved it. Great job for a American quad with Belgium style"
""
""
""
""
"Would definitely have again; worth a shot if you come across it and like Begians.  (4.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a tremendous beer from Boulevard. I'm not crazy about this style, but I will return to the Sixth Glass next time I am in the mood for a serious American riff on this classic Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear orange-amber color with lots of bubbles from the center and a large, quick to dissipate off-white head that's quick to dissipate with decent lacing.  Malt, dark fruits and some bubblegum in the nose. Alcohol and pepper bite in the taste, with some cherry, a little orange and more gum.  Hop bitterness on the back end.  Not bad, but not the greatest."
"Overall impression:  A big Belgian Dark Strong ale.  The phenolics are a one trick pony and I would have liked more malt or fermentation character.  Still, a very solid example of the style."
"not quite as effervescent as I've become accustomed to with this style. Lots of spiciness and fruity phenols.  Soft malty body with warming alcohol in finish no doubt from dark candi sugars.  I've only had two Boulevard beers and they have both been outstanding.  Will be on the lookout for more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal - incredible quad!"
"Overall: I won't be picking this one back up. When I want a quad, I'm looking for yeast esters to shine against a backdrop of sweet malt. This doesn't accomplish that at all. It tastes like an attempt to hop up a quad. Back to Abt 12, Rochefort 10, Three Philosophers, Trois Pistoles, and so forth I go."
"Unfiltered and effervescent. Garnet colored pour into my tulip. 2 fingers of loose, fluffy light tan bubbles. Spicy yeast notes, caramel, breadiness, figs, raisins, plums. Mild but pleasing nose. Huge dark fruit on the palate. Warming alcohol. Spicy yeast notes. Complex, yet seemingly simple. Dry finish with lingering dark fruits. Left me wanting more. So clean, crisp, and dry. Exceptional brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a robust head. Sticky aftertaste. Floral smell. Robust. Taste great!"
""
""
""
""
""
"not my favorite style of brew but its a decent beer in my book for the complex minded pallet"
"Awesome quad at an awesome price point. Boulevard makes awesome Belgian-style beers -- it's easy to see why Duvel Moortgat bought them up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a forward, almost pushy effervescence. Warming from the get-go. Dry finish brings out a slightly harsh astringency but it isn't offputting. Wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour very carefully! I lost a bit of brew to the ever expanding head on this. I find it solid for the style and really, really good coming from an American brewery. There are hints of bubblegum phenols found in strong dark ales, but it is very well controlled compared to many American versions I've tried. Big, rich, dark fruit, dark sugar, and dark malt flavors. Hops serve to dry up the mouthfeel enough to keep the experience from being a cloying one. This sample came from a twelve ounce bottle with a bottle cap; not sure if a corked version would change the character or not. I am happily willing to investigate this matter. I would very much like to drink this next to other examples of the style. I expect it would do very well."
""
"Pours a clear copper with tons of sediment in suspension, with thick khaki colored head that settles to a thin cap, but very little is able to stick. Smell: dates and clove most prominent with caramel apple and a little spicy hopping; mild bready back. Taste: pear, caramel candy, date bread and plum notes...fruity but too quickly into big earthiness and a note of clove. For a quad the body is surprisingly light upfront then goes limp and heavy midsip and just as quickly vanishes, fleeting on the palate. For the 4/pack price, certainly worthy, but I'm not picking it over any of the similarly available Belgian heavy hitters."
""
"O: I enjoyed this one plenty. It's fruity and pleasant. There's nothing here that makes me feel I need to buy this one a gain in the future, but I'm certainly glad to have tried it."
"The Sixth Glass  pours deep rich chestnut with a slight haze with a pillowy off-white foam cap that mounds up over the rim of the glass. The nose is fruit - a mix of large pitted and dried, and a hint of dark moist Carmel cake. Large pitted fruit, a faint citrus, dark raisins and a hint of fig begin the palate  with a touch of chocolate and caramel. Medium full body with above average carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark fruits, booze, and earthy Belgian yeast. A decent American-made Quad."
"O: On the lighter side of the quad spectrum, so maybe not what people tend to associate with the style as much. Great attenuation and nice fermentation. A lot of great complexity and character here. It really began to grow on me as I drank my way through it,"
""
""
""
""
"Solid offering I have no problems drinking this one again a good rep of the style"
"Overall- Really superb and unique take on the style. wonderful job. would love to try again."
""
"This is a great Quad. This is definitely one of the better ones I've had that was brewed in America, and it can hang with examples of the style brewed out of the country. It's tough to beat from a value standpoint as well. Well executed and well crafted. I'm interested in what some age would do this."
""
""
""
"The flavor has a deep dark fruit overtone. Lots of dates and prunes followed by light bubblegum and banana. My issue is this is way too boozy at any temperature. The alcohol can be found in taste and feel. This really opens up to be a great Quad but washes away in the alcohol."
"Mostly straight fours without analyzing too much this tasting.  Straightforward raisin-like dark fruitiness, malt-based with perhaps a tad heavy carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appreciating the spices and pretty suspensions in this beer. A very nice quaff."
"Overall: Having never heard of this brewery before, I am pleasantly surprised by how good this is. Definitely my new favorite non-Trappist Quadrupel."
""
"Delightfully sweet and dense, a must-try for any drinker of heavier beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a 12 ounce bottle.  It is a chestnut color...towering head...lots of lace.  The beer is hazy, with a few yeast floaties in suspension.  The aroma is of yeast, spice, ripe fruit (plums) and some malt.  Lots of alcohol in the taste...warmth and spice.  Sweet and full, with great complexity (spice, yeast, pepper, malt, and booze).  Great beer."

"Ugh, miss. Raisin finish is too much to bear.  Not good at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Boulevard hit a homerun with this beer.  A must try on any beer list."
"Tastes kind of flat and boozy at first, like malt liquor. But as the beer warms and settles a nice grapey, fruity, figgy character emerges. Definitely on the lighter side of the quad flavor spectrum - more fruity and dry than chocolatey and sweet. Still, the booze is always present and comes off a little 'hot' and off-putting at times. This bottle is fresh and could probably benefit from some age."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a hazy dark Amber with a nice two finger fluffy off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. The smell was candy sugar, dark fruits and some grassy notes, and alcohol. The taste is sweet, with some cherry and fig flavors, some sweet malt, and a bit of estery notes. Mouthfeel was fairly thick and creamy- very smooth with a nice aftertaste. Overall, this one is pretty close to some of the better Belgian Quads- not quite there yet, but pretty good for an American Quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"750ml bottle poured into a goblet. Color: light brown. A little to sweet for me and lacking the complexity I look for in the style. Yet, still a good American version of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer escapes me. I love it, but I can't quite define what makes it so good taste-wise. Nevertheless, a solid beer, and a good value."

"This beer was good all around.  Nothing wowed me, but I wasn't mad I drank it.  Not sure I'll go out of my way to drink it again, but I'd take it over many other brews."

"Boulevard Brewing Sixth Glass is a very good beer!  Nice amber color.  Good head and nice aroma.  This tyle of beer is definitely one of my favorite go to beers.  Explosion of favors.  Nice finish.  At 10.5%, definitely one you have to respect, but it's too goodto sip.  Thankfully, not an overpowering alcohol taste.  Tangy spicy finish, easy to drink."
""
"O: Definitely a sipping beer - enjoyable with a nice amount of complexity to the flavor/aroma but definitely a big beer (even though the alcohol is well hidden).Very sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall - no doubt a great brew, however, it certainly falls short of quads like Abt 12 and 3 Philosophers, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really nice example of the style.  Often times I find that the American versions of Quads to fall short in a lot of areas, but that was not the case here. Certainly not of St. Bernardus/Roche/Westy caliber, but worth a try and very enjoyable.  4.25"

"wonderful beer!!! the Bros have it right! world class!!! the only reason I didnt give it a 5 is I didnt have an orgasm!"
""
""
""
"Literally the best beer I've ever had in my entire life."
""
""
"Pours a nice hazy brown with little to no head. Smell and taste of strong alcohol but this brew is smooth. Dark fruits stick out with this one. Maybe some figs and raisins. Taste grows on you for sure as this one warms up a bit. Surprised this is from Missouri."

"Nice beer but it is a bit too hoppy for a quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours hazy amber with tall, creamy, long-lasting, off-white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of funky yeast, grassy hops, caramel malt and dark fruit.  Body is full, creamy and crisp. Taste is of herbal hops, caramel malt, sherry, brown sugar and dark fruit. Complexity of flavor is increasing as beer warms up.  Finish is long and dry. Outstanding brew."

"Notes of molasses and raisins. You feel the abv , good beer"
""
""
"Don't be fooled - this was every bit as strong as a Quad should be and this beer made no bones about it. Coming up short in this category is like saying that you shot the moon and missed. This beer still made it to the stars and we're all the better for it . Boulevard should be commended for crafting this as I was nearly fooled into thinking this came from overseas and anyone who loves Belgian beers or something that elevates the American art of craft brewing owes it to him or herself to give this a go. It's strong in the sense that all the components to this beer fit in harmoniously together, with results worthy of it's world-class rating on here."

""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Slick but with an almost capsaicin like burn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich and sweet, with very little alcohol burn.  Quite smooth for a beer of this strength.  A lot of American brewers have nailed Tripels, Quads are a different story.  Boulevard has done an outstanding job."

"I first had this beer when I was living in Missouri.  If you ever have the opportunity to try it make sure you do!  Wonderful flavor with a high alcohol content.  This (at least for me) is a beer that I only have one at a time.  It goes very well as an after dinner beer."
""
""
"Crisp and light, 20 something IBUs, its perfect after a long day at work, Amber color, very little head poured cold and let come up in temp for 15 to 20. Reached right into the gray matter and gave me a happy smile!"

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good offering of an American Brewer trying a Belgian Style. The flavors are pinpoint to a BSDA. The only thing that lets you know it is an American brewer is the carbonation. The body and carbonation is a bit light for a Quad. Enough said this is worthy."

"Fantastic.  Tastes like fig and plum and at a wonderful 10.5 percent abv it really gets you there. Very slight warmness of alcohol followed by an aftertaste to die for.  Fruity but not overly sweet.   St.  Bernardus has a son and sixth glass quadrupel is his name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another homerun from Boulevard. Beer has several layers of flavor. Malty front, light black pepper middle, Belgium yeast and sweet finish are revealed. I haven't had this beer for a while but appreciate it more than the last time I had it."

"Not as good as I’d hoped. The other Belgians from Boulevard were much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oveall, I am very impressed as I have been with most Boulevard beers that I have encountered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome beer. Highly recommend. First time trying this from Boulevard and I would definitely buy again. I am very impressed."
""
""
""
"O: A wonderful thick beer, chocked full of massive flavors and big character. Extremely malty, somewhat sweet with some interesting fruit characteristics. Big molasses, cherry and brown sugar flavors on top of its malt balance. Delicious and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sixth Glass pours a dark reddish color, with a nice large frothy lacing head. There is a sweet, wine like aroma. There is a rich taste, nice subtle dry fruit flavors, wine like flavors, and a nice warmth from the alcohol. Great body, and very good feel. Overall its a very solid and very tasty quad."
""
"This is a really good beer! It has sharp teeth, so be wary of the bite - the ABV presents itself almost instantly. The taste is similar to many other quads but what makes this one unique is the taste of almond and overt caramel. The mouthfeel and the body are identical in many respects to other quads, but the level of smoothness that this particular one brings to the table is paralleled by few others. It's definitely worth a try. Kansas City has made big strides to match the monks' skills and pallet."

"Like what? Trappist-style ales seem simplified to me, but the tangy yeasts and bready mouthfuls of flavor in this bronson are smooth despite the 10.5% alcohol. Really impressed with this number, even considering the enormous amount of decent trappist ales out there. Fantastic beer that I look to make a staple of my summer Tour de France viewing libation menu."
""
""
""
"O-Overall a great example of a Trappist quad. Will get some more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly complex brew. Nice dry finish prevents it from being cloying, and the esters are yummy. A little hot, this would age well."

"O - I liked the beer, but for the Quad price point I need to love it. I'm already paying premium for a treat, so I'll pay a buck or two more for St. Bernardus."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is what I would expect from a quad and this quad is one of the many great quads out there. You must try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to lump this into a category of quads, it seems to want to be its own class of alternative quads. It's not horrible by any means, but it is not something I will go out of my way to purchase either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, yet another traditional Belgian style that Boulevard does well. It's a little lighter than many beers in the quad/BSDA category, but that's no problem by my view. The only thing I will say is that I wish there were a little more depth of flavor to this one. One of the things I like about the style is that it continues to evolve and develop throughout the enjoyment of the glass. This one was pretty similar from start to finish. As such, I feel the need to dock the overall score, because the sum of it's parts were just not quite as good as the individual components."
""
""
""
"Overall: outside of the richness of the beer (which is a huge element), this beer is pretty great, especially for being an American made quad. I like the stuff that I have had from boulevard, I just haven't had enough. Look forward to trying some more of their stuff in the future. Well priced at a little of 3 bucks for a single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice drink all and all, I was surprised in how easy it was to drink, though it does pack a punch."
"My advice don't waste your money. I realize it's voted world class but pond water is more tasty! Or hell sewer water!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like the aroma the roasted malts kick things off with a return play by the cherry-based defensive receiver. There is this definite pungent tart bite that makes me wince briefly but I get used to it. Some dry afterbite for certain. A little booze but that's to be expected at 10.5%. I wonder how it would be at this time next year with proper cellaring"

"Overall- I really enjoyed this beer. I would definitely recommend Sixth Glass to a friend. For a 10% beer you can taste it, but it didn't overwhelm me. Strong bold flavor, but smooth all the way through."
"My first review! The past few weeks I've been drinking these and really digging the taste. Out of the handful of quad ales I've tried, I like this the best. Drinking one right now, good rich color, a lot of particles in it but I like the added sediment. You could pour it slowly to reduce the cloudiness. Head doesn't stay put for long though compared to other abbey ales kind of reducing aromas. Or maybe I should stop typing and finish this brew right. Cheers!"

"This one warms quite well, developing character along the way. It makes for a contemplative beer that proves to be quite enjoyable on a cool autumn evening before dinner. I enjoyed it with a pungent, creamy bleu “Valdbon”. The cheese brought out a sweet fruitiness, otherwise not detected."

"Picked up a 4 pack at Old Farm because I had not seen this before and big fan of Quads. Awesome looking beer, great head that grew and has a good, clean smell. Taste is excellent, great balance, did not taste as strong as the 10.5% that is was. Overall is was a great beer that I am glad I have 3 more of and will buy again."

"This is one of those beers that tastes better with every drink. The first drink your like OMG WTF and your mouth is almost hot feeling. then by the last drink you have an oddly clear buzz and your left wanting another bottle... I love ales but this was almost too strong for me.. It barely tasted like a beer. I think the high note of this beer is the complexity of the smells and taste.. and the warmer it got the more it changed.. at nearly 10 bucks a bottle I honestly don't know If I'll get more. But it's definitely one to try for sure! But be warned the taste is extremely potent.. I think the majority of beer drinkers would think this beer is hard to drink. It doesn't exactly go down smooth. But then again, it has 10.5% alc so... that's to be expected. Some wines have less.."
""
"O: Not the best quad out there, but definitely worth a try. I'd like to try an aged bottle or the bourbon barrel aged version."
""
""
""
""
""
" Nice. Overall a very enjoyable sipping brew take your time."
""
"One of the better American-made quadruppels that I've tasted. With the few samples which I've tasted from Boulevard, it appears that they can pull off Belgian styles too."
""
"Overall - A great beer, very strong on the spicy end for a quadrupel. It is interesting and a different take on the style, maybe not the best but different and unique."
""
""
""
"I don't drink Quads very often, they're not really a style I prefer but I do truly appreciate great versions like Rochefort's and St. Bernardus', with that said I'll have to pass on Sixth Glass. It's a good beer, worth a try, but I'll skip this guy in the future."
""
""
"Booze booze booze. The beer was absolutely dominated by alcohol. It gets even worse as it warms and I had to pour it out. I don’t know if it was infected as it nasted like nail polish and alcohol."

"O: Cold weather beer, no way I could drink this in the summer, or any weather that isn't cold, rainy and above 40 degrees. So sweet with a huge spice profile, and a fragrant alcoholic character. The flavored and mouthfeel were extraordinarily well-balanced. Not a beer to be consumed cold, started at 55 or so, and it got better as it warmed. The only quadrupels that will match this, have a label only in French and the brewery is in Belgium."
""
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied. The carbonation was the key to how enjoyable this was. It was just a hint. The beer left a light film across the tongue and finished slightly dry."
"Overall – Really enjoyed this beer, it reminded me a bit of Rochefort but with a touch more vibrant fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a great beer and one of the better American quads I have tried. It packs a lot of flavor and complexity, and mimics the feel of the best examples of this style. I don't think it is quite up to the level of the Belgians, but I would definitely drink more of this."
""
""
""
"This is not the first time nor the last I've had this. It is an excellent American quad, with wine like qualities and a lot of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious!"
""
""
"Overall I may have to go back and snag the Saison since it is more impressive. This beer is a great quad not too bozzy or sweet. Wish it was cheaper though but its PA so what are you gonna do trading would be more expensive..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't all that impressed with the first offering that I sampled from Boulevard Brewing (Tank 7) but this quad is excellent."
"Reddish amber in color. An inch thick layer of foam rests on top of this brew. Brussels lacing on the glass. Dark Belgian candy sugar with hints of caramel. Intensely thick and alcoholic mouthfeel. This is serious stuff. I get loads of sweet malt and dark Belgian candy sugar. Lingering fade of Belgian yeast and dark malt. This is a great teat."
""
"Overall: A perfect beer to warm up with while it’s14 degrees outside. Easy to see why as it’s very sweet with a huge spice presence and fragrant alcohol. The prominent alcohol in the nose left an odd presence but I really enjoyed it in the taste. I would also like to stress that this is one of those beer that you should just drink at cellar temp or if anything chilled. In only got better as it warmed. Overall, while it’s not up there with the world class quads I still highly recommend it."
"I would refer this to everyone of my KC and non-KC friends alike. Great ale. Thank you, Boulevard."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of high intensity, resulting in a fizzy, prickly mouthfeel at first, which then fades to a foamy (9/10) and slightly smooth (1/10) feel. Somewhat overcarbonated for the beer and the style, with time correcting this. Ethanol easily felt on the palate, back of throat, and in nostrils: not well integrated into the beer. Closes dryly, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"This is a very nice, easy drinking 10.5% quad. Probably wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting but it makes for a great winter-weekday-evening sipper!"

"o: An outstanding Belgian style quad. Anyone who likes the style should be pleased. Tastier and easier drinking than some Barleywines I have had as well. Given the ABV, I'd look for the twelve ounce fourpacks instead of going for the bomber, unless you have a friend to share it with or a big alcohol tolerance."

"Summary - A proper Belgian. I have a higher standard for Tripels and Quads (so many great ones out there), and this one is a good Quad."
"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 3/2015. Pours lightly cloudy reddish orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, grape, toast, brown sugar, clove, herbal, pepper, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of caramel, raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, candi sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent quadrupel style! All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: It's always neat to see American brewers make quads, and it's definitely up there as one of my favorite beers. It's definitely a beer that you're going to want to serve at proper temperature, so let it warm up a bit to get the full experience. This was my first beer from Boulevard and I'm looking forward to trying more. It's a good one to have on hand as the weather cools down and if you get the chance to pick up a bottle or 4-pack it's well worth the money!"

"Poured a ruby red brown with one finger head that died quick. Has a slightly boozy aroma, dark fruits and figs (maybe raisins) are a tad noticeable and there are some sweet malts. Beer is medium bodied, smooth, real sweet for some reason, good amount of caramel, candi sugar and a touch of fruit sweetness. Good balance as I get some dark fruits as well and there is a hearty, heavy finish. Not a bad American quad at all and well worth the low pricepoint; not the tastiest or most complex quad but it got the job done."
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid if slightly different quad, with lots of peppery notes, along with the usual fig and other dark fruit tastes. Not as bready or complex as the best in this style, but it still provides a satisfying experience for lovers of quads. Starts out good in taste, if a little thin, but then gets better as it warms. You also start to notice the alcohol heat as you drink longer, maybe just a little too much. The aroma is nice, with figs and some alcohol predominating. Very nice and the best I've had from Boulevard so far, although I look forward to Saison Brett."

"I am afraid I set myself up for disappointment on this one. I was hoping to have an experience similar to a La trappe, but it wasnt there. The color is amazing, smell wasn't horrible either. My biggest dissappoinment was in the flavor and mouthfeel, they are almost inter-twined for me on this. It didn't have the smooth and rich feel I was expecting and that brought along a kind of harsh flavor for me. I am not sad I tried it but it will not make it into the regular line up."
""

"Overall this is an extremely impressive brew, probably the best American Quad i have experienced to date including Allagash Four."

"This beer thus far for me is the best example of an American crafted Belgian Quad. Very good beer and at a great price point. I am so excited these guys have expanded to Ohio as I've been a fan for a long time. Any fans of Belgian Quads will enjoy this beer. Also has a slight uniqueness that you don't find in a Belgian but I can't quite put my finger on what it is."

"M + D: The alcohol is certainly not hidden on this one, and it can be a little heavy as the bottle goes. I find that many other quads keep this element of the beer more under control or subdued, relative to the other highlights of the beers. It's certainly a decent brew, yet I believe it's open to some improvements."
"O: A good quad. Lots of rich flavors, and a nice balance. 12 oz. ends up being a fair amount of this beer, and I'm glad it's not a 750 ml. Not as interesting as some quads, perhaps a little too balanced, if that makes any sense. Just a lot of god flavors all playing together nicely."
""
"O- rich, complex, malty and boozy. This is a solid quad that begs to be sipped over and over. Another winner from the Smokestack Series"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is less complex than the not overly complex aroma. Bit of caramel and some muddled fruits. Nothing negative to deter yet overly one sided. Perhaps too much science and not enough art. 'Clean' comes to mind. Feel is soft and creamy nonetheless, isn't overly sweet and yet still capable of masking the ABV to a large degree. Overall a pretty well executed though not so well designed brew that drinks like a lighter Dubbel. Needs more malt complexity to call itself a Quad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good American quad. It does not hold a candle to the Belgian classics, but it is a very nice beer. Would be better if the booze was toned down."
""
""
"Thick, rich, with a bit of spice. Deep amber in color, with a nice head. First sip was exceptional as the carbonation seemed to enhance the spice. Smooth, with just a minor hint of bitterness at the end. Almost a perfect balance. Exceptionally easy to drink ( I tried to take it slow to savor it but it slides down the throat with the greatest of ease.)"

"O: My first try at a quad, was very different than anything else I've had. Very strong everywhere, a sipping beer best with some food. Some good cheese and crackers would be good. Can't pick out the unique flavors, I'll need to have another and try again."
""
""

"It's not a knock to say it's gritty and slightly staining. Delightful as doesn't sit at all heavy, not anymore so than an Amber."

"Overall- Probably the best you could expect from a quad that isn't bottle conditioned. This is definitely worth a try and a steal at the price. Just don't think you've found a replacement for Rochefort, Bernardus, or (gasp) Westy. There's a reason you pay money for the big hitters."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad Quad, but there are a few things holding this back from being really enjoyable to me. The problem is, my palate (like many others) has been spoiled like a pre-teen in Bel-Air by things like Westvletern XII and St. Bernardus Abt 12. Those beers have changed the Quad game forever and Sixth Glass doesn't quite hit the bar. Still enjoyable but nothing to get hard over."
""
""

"I was blown away when I opened this bottle. The smell of all sorts of sweet, dark fruits blasted me in the nose. Frankly, quads aren't the most attractive looking beers in the world so I didn't take long to admire the appearance of it, but man does it smell fucking wonderful! Upon smelling this brew, it's hard to believe that it is 10.5% ABV and even though it's more relevant a taste upon drinking it, the presence of dark fruits and spices are much easier to identify. I don't know enough about quads to be able to compare this to the style, but I know that I definitely like this beer, like a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"The dark fruit characters are the star in this one. Plums, raisins, fig are all easily picked out. If you like dark fruit characteristics rather than the more caramel/molasses heavy quads, this might just be the best one you can buy."

"Overall a very satisfying Quad. I generally like my Quads as I like my women: sweet and rich. I like the malt to be front and center and just enough spice to add complexity. Still, this is a nice departure from my usual ventures in this style. Definitely a distinct offering in a field populated by several world classics that are among the greatest of all beers. I've had a few quads and this one stands out as one of the spiciest ones. I probably wouldn't buy it again for just that reason, but those who enjoy this style and don't have a sweet-tooth like mine will probably love this. It's a terrific beer, just not quite what I look for in a Quad."
""

""
""
""

"What an interesting twist on the style! As indicated by their saison, it seems these guys get traditional recipes and provide their own Americanized rendition of them. This is not the greatest quad I've ever had, but it is not a chore to drink at all, and the raisin/caramel profile is quite good here, if only lacking complexity. I would love to revisit this one for sure. Definitely looking forward to trying more of their Belgian-style beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a murky brown with a fluffy tan head that laces with a residual thin blanketing. The nose is fruity, malty, molasses-y, a little boozy, and has a touch of yeast/bread. This drinks with stone fruit upfront, big malty sweetness, followed by a spicy, boozy, effervescent finish, and lingering plumb fruitiness. This is a heavy-medium bodied, strong flavored, fruity quad with masked booze and great yeast. Definitely a good beer that has aged well with 1-2 years on it. Highly recommended if your in the quad mood."

"Overall, I like this beer!"

"Overall: Not at all a typical Quad. It's lighter, simpler, and far easier to drink. It doesn't have the same complex contemplative nature that define the classic Belgian Quads, but if you think of it as a a fresh and original take on the classic style, it's a very nice brew."
"Overall: A nice quad for sure. Not an all the time beer or an all the time style but worth trying"

"Not a fan of quads really, but this is one of the best American renditions I've tried. Cheers. :)"
""
"Absolutely one of the best Quad's I've ever drank! Nice deep yellow color with an orange hue. The aroma was like heaven, with all though components (spices, fruit, hop's and malts) and you can't believe your drink an ale that's 10% alcohol. So mellow, but be careful, it can jump up and bite you! Great brew, can't wait to buy a case of four packs!"

My absolute favorite part of this beer is the after taste in the back of your throat on the finish. The plum and caramel smell is favorable and I wish I had saved my bottle for a pairing. I will definitely buy more of these to put on my summertime beer pairing! Schwing Town!"

The appearance was the beast part of the beer, it was beautiful. It's a very strong beer, and im usually not a fan of quadrupel Belgians but this one was fantastic. The subtle fruit notes and dash of chocolate made for a great flavor. Mouthfeel was crisp."

"Poured into a tulip glass. A very nice amber and cream colored head that lingers. Fruity aroma and bit medicinal, likely due to the high alcohol content, but not unpleasant at all. The taste was surprising; the fruitiness comes through up front followed by dryness with some bitterness that I wasn't expecting based on my experience with other quads. A very pleasant surprise though! After a few sips to get the full effect I settled back and savored every mouthful. An excellent quad and definitely worth a return engagement!"
"The beer pours a cloudy reddish amber color with a few fingers of a creamy off white head. The head sticks around nicely throughout the pour. I had this next to a BBQ. I'm getting slight sweetness with some dark fruit. There is also a slight banana note. This has some age and it has smoothes things out. There is a slight cherry note to the beer. In the finish, I'm getting the dark fruit and cherry in the finish. I liked this more than the BBQ."
"The beer pours a dark maple syrup and candy brown with a creamy yellow head that sits at a half finger’s width with lots of small tightly packed bubbles. Carbonation bubbles can be clearly seen racing to replenish the head, but the beer’s body is murky and hazed, letting very little light pass through, even though the beer is clearly not black. Lacing is sparse, thin, and patchy on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells like spicy cinnamon raisin bread with a touch of cloying alcohol. Dark fruit malts give a firm body to the smell, highly suggesting raisins, but also verging on dates and perhaps a touch of plums, though the malt also suggest rich dark caramel. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly raisin-like with good sweet plum notes and alcohol spice backing, and a touch of bready yeast at the close. The beer begins with light spicy alcohol before opening into sweet raisin and then slowly moving towards sweet plum. The close brings the yeast to the forefront, suggesting breadier Belgian yeast characteristics in-between the sweet dark fruit notes. The malt is mostly dark fruit but does suggest the lightest bit of caramel and brown sugar. From the beginning, spicy alcohol bubbles under the tongue and the flavor, placing the sweetness of the beer just below cloying. On the mouth the beer feels thick and creamy with a touch of sticky heaviness on the tongue. The carbonation is light and fluffy and the mouth is left slightly dry and slightly cloyed with sweet sugar and a tingle of alcohol. Overall, the beer is a success within the style, and a lovely beer overall. The beer has great rich and complex flavors masking the heavy alcohol nicely, while still letting you know that this beer is for sipping. A success from Boulevard!"
""
""
"The nose is overpoweringly figgy. Figs, dates, raisins, dark fruit, toffee, brown sugar, a hint of vanilla, an oaky undertone and did I mention figs? The taste is mad figgy too. Heavy dark fruit, figs, dates, brown sugar, toffee, oak, caramel, raisins, a hint of alcohol warmth, bready notes and a surprisingly light but substantial body and lively carbonation. This is a great Quad and the best of the Smokestack Series that I have had. I wish I would've gotten more than one. I'm sad now."

"O: Really nice quad. One of my favorites in the group. This will have to become one of my regular purchases."

"-Overall 3.75: Unusual and satisfyingly big and heavy quad. This certainly does not taste like any traditional Belgian quad I have ever had and the emphasis on the hops and the malt is reminicent of Stone's ""Double Bastard."" However, this brew is more dry and somewhat less heavy on the flavors."

"Overall- a very good and approachable quad. I think you could have multiples of this and not completely shred your palette or be completely consumed with sweetness. The alcohol content is another story. I still think the standout beer from this brewery is the Tank 7 Farmhouse. But If i had a friend that liked belgian beer and never had a quad to start with this one."

"Boulevard's Quadrupel offering pours a rich dark amber color with just a touch of garnet hue. The light colored head dissipates very quickly leaving only a rim around the edge. The aroma is sweet and fruity with hints of apple, pear, and dates. The first sip delivers a well balanced beer. There is a caramel sweetness followed by just the right amount of bitter. There is a lingering alcohol warmth after swallowing. Subsequent sips provide a depth of sweetness. the caramel fades a bit and the fruity notes come forward. Sixth Glass has a rich mouthfeel with a mild foamy effervescence. It's not too syrupy, but delivers a richness that a Quad should. Overall, this is a great beer. It keeps one wanting more, sip after sip."

"O- A pretty good brew. Sadly there's rochforte 10 & st. B 12 to compare it to, and it does not stack up. The smell is nice and the brown sugar is a plus, but it's way to boozy. IMO the way a brewery can hide this is a main staple when deciding on the quality of it. It's decent but i wont be buying it again."

"O: really was digging this beer and was a good interpretation of an abbey quad."
"Overall: I'm glad I tried it. I think I'll carry on sampling some other quads before I come back to this one. It tastes good enough, and will definitely make you very jolly in a good hurry. I felt warm after two sips. The price was also very good, even compared to the same beer in different areas. I paid $8.25/4-pack. Good beer."

"Large format bottle from Lets Pour. Pours dark red with large head. Aroma is cherries, figs, plums. Taste follows the aroma with a lot of sweetness, big focus on the black cherries, and a bit of alcohol burn. Slight dry finish after a medium-heavy body. Decent quad but nothing to call home about. I continue to find Boulevard to make medicore brews."

"Its a bit harsh..boozey, and just intense with flavor, and very very sweet. Nice brew that would likely benefit from some aging to mellow this out. I usually like my quads a bit darker and mellow, but this is a good interpretation."
"A deep, hazy, rusty brown color with a healthy light tan layer of foam on top and generous lacing. The aroma notes brown sugar and maple sweetness, caramel and some grassy bite. Pretty heavy duty but compelling for the sweet tooths out there. The flavor follows suit with a murky blend of grass hops smothered in clove malt and more brown sugar, somewhat cloying with a hint of fruit nougat sherry. The body is pretty much full with a nice, velvety feel. Carbonation is smooth and full. This is a classy brew for those that can handle a little sugar shock."
"Overall good but not world clase."
""
"This is a really solid beer. It's complex and delicious. The ABV is completely hidden and the crisp carbonation lightens the body making this very drinkable. I will definitely have this Quad again."
""
""
"Overall, this beer was a pretty big letdown after saving it for 2 years. Maybe it was better fresh, but in my experience strong Belgian ales are best at about 2 years. Anyway, the beer lacked the super dark caramelized sugars and other darker fruits that are necessary for a stellar Quad. This is almost like a Belgian Barley Wine or a Belgian Strong Amber Ale (I know that doesn't exist as a style but it's not dark and it's not golden). A disappointment for me considering the high rankings on this site, as per usual, so fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, and some spice aromas. As the beer warms up, there is an aroma of caramel covered bananas. Taste is much the same with a pretty intense alcohol kick and a medium spice bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it's pretty strong alcohol wise."

"O: Fans of Achel Bruin and St. Bernardus Prior 8, if you can find this you will love it. I know I'm blending categories, but I think I'm right on this one. Easily one of the best American-made quads I've had. Just a really good beer."
""
"Pours a murky ruby reddish color with a large cream-colored head that goes down quickly. Some floaties floatin around in there as well. Scent is quite lovely. Very similar to a true trappist Belgian quad. Great malt aroma blended nicely with spicy Belgian yeast aromas. Dark fruits and fresh bread with some pepper and light banana. Very lovely and inviting aroma. Taste is just as good. Great Belgian yeast flavors with fresh dark fruits. Great plum, raisin, and date flavors. Peppery, spicy finish on the tongue. The high ABV is there, but it's not overwhelming at all. Very well-balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and crisp at the same time. Tingly, spicy finish. Drinkability is high for such a big beer. Overall, this is one of the better American Quads out there. Very tasty, and I'm so glad Boulevard comes to California now!"
"O: Can't tell its 10.5%. Decent drinkability for a quad. Not my favorite style, but this is a pretty good interpretation for an american brewery though it is lacking in complexity."

"Good to see Boulevard here in NC.Poured into a chalice a deep auburn (just like the bottle says) with a large but pretty quick to fade off white head atop.Dark fruits abound in the nose along brown sugar and sweet alcohol.Cakey flavors like that of christmas cake that has soaked in alcohol for awhile, toffee, and a faint shot of yeasty spiced notes as well.It's a little hot but it doesn't hinder the beer much.A solid quad it's not a big complex monster but it has all the components of a solid quad."

"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a more interesting flavor profile than the aroma suggests. There's a very nice balance of peppery spice, sweet malt, vinous fruit and subtle alcohol without a trace of heat, making it deceptively drinkable. Some zesty clove and pepper up front followed by silky chocolate, caramel and toffee. The malt notes are countered by dark fruit sweetness giving off hints of plum, raisin, dark cherry and fig lingering into a slightly dry finish. Perfectly balanced and the 10.5% ABV is excellently masked. I enjoyed this beer very much and had to stop myself from guzzling down the whole 750ml to quickly."
""
"O: Very tasty and smooth quadrupel with deep, balanced flavors. Almost like a heavier version of a Duvel. Nice dryness that's not overwhelming. Bottle indicates aromas of date and fig, which I didn't pick up (and I'm not sure I'd recognize them anyway). Quite drinkable even with the high ABV."

"O: while this is a good quad, I feel the balance is a little off and the carbonation hits to hard at the front of the taste. However, will drink again and recommend to try."
"D - Complexity is the name of the game for this one which was a very welcome introduction to Boulevard... Sinful and indulgent... If this is any indication of the rest of their line-up I can't wait to try some more... A rock solid quad that kept my undivided attention throughout... A very nice brew that I highly recommend..."
""
""
"After continuing to sip this, I had to downgrade the taste from a 3. I struggled through this glass, and I don't ever plan to drink it again. Hoping that Boulevard's BBQ is nothing like this (at least, nothing like the bad half). How does a 10% beer come across as THIS alcohol-forward."
"Overall: Love Boulevard's take on this style, you can tell how much effort they put into this one. Highly recommend due to the drinkability--yet a beer one should definitely savor."

"This was a pretty good take on a Belgian Quad from Boulevard, with a nice mix of fruit, spice and sugars that kept this flavorful in its profiles. That 10%+ ABV is deceptively hid as well. Watch out!"

"The shape of the bottle, the quirky label artwork, and the Boulevard Brewing Co. name engraved on the neck gave off a very European vibe. The body looked a little paler than a typical Quad, with the color of mahogany. The head was fizzy and short lived, settling down to a lacy collar. The smell had fragrances of apricot, hazelnut, and pear. The flavor was delicately sweet and a bit spicy. I could taste raisin, pears, saffron, toffee, and chili pepper. The aftertaste was sweet like hard candy, until abruptly being cut off by yeasty dryness. Quite sticky in the mouth, and not quite as velvety smooth like the true Belgian varieties. The beer would have benefited from some darker malts to further enhance the date and fig flavors mentioned on the label, and add complexity."
"All in all a very solid and tasty quad. A great American rendition of a great Belgian style."

"O- this is only okay. In a line up, I could definitely confuse it with a true Belgian though. It has a certain rawness I like to see in my quads. The flavors themselves aren't wonderful though. It's strong, definitely a sipper."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber with an aggressive light brown head and nice lacing. Hops and malt right up front with a slap of booze. Light malt and fruit middle with a sharp edge from the carbonation. Boozy, hop finish. Underlying taste is nice, but he alcohol is not well integrated. Light bodied. This was absolutley delicious with a chocolate chip cookie."
""
"O- A solid Quad from Boulevard. Not as sweet as some of the other Quads out there, but would definitely make a great fall/winter beer for tailgating in cold weather."
"wonderfully warming; would make an excellent winter beer"
""
""
"Over all it is a great beer that I would recommend."
""
"Don't get me wrong, though, this is still one of the best American quads I've ever had. If you can't find the two I've mentioned or don't want to drop $8 or $13 (respectively) for a single bottle of the aforementioned, then go ahead and grab this."
"O- A solid and really well made quad, not quite up to par with some of Belgian's best but I think it will make it to their level in time. I got a few to age."
""
"A 'total package' craft quad with impressive flavor and bursting nose. Better than you'd believe."
""
"T&M: slightly, but only slightly, lighter than some other quads I've had. Nice mildly drying finish cleans off most cloy. Subtle bitterness and spice, close to the finish. Dank fruit similar to the nose up front, clean up on the finish. Bit of rum/fruit cake. Alcohol warming but soft. Busy malt; I could sit here and list a dozen other associated flavors. I like it. One of the best from one of my least favorite styles."
""
"O - if judged as an American offering this would rate higher. But when quads are the style I really started on and Belgium is where I started, perhaps I am too harsh. If you can find Rochefort 10, St Bernardus, Pannepot or Westvletern, give this one a pass. For the price though it has its niche."
""
""
"O: It ain't Rochefort 10, that's for damn sure, but that's slighting this one far too much. I'm enjoying sipping one of these - it's a great American take on a quad, at the very least."
"Pours a deep rich clear amber with a nice head that does a good job of lasting and lacing. Pepper, dried fruit and belgian esters dominate the nose. The body has all sorts of interesting stuff going on. Raisins, sweet caramel, earthy bitterness, black pepper, more dried fruit... Yum. Bitterness keeps the residual sweetness in check. Average carbonation for the style. A solid beer worth having again."

"4.0 D: Really nice beer. Good complexity but just barely missing with the depth."

"Poured into a beer tulip glass. Huge 4 finger head, amber colored. Just beautiful! Nice lacing. Smells of caramel and some fruit. Very complex taste. Starts with caramel and bread taste. Ends spicy. Very smooth at first with a nice kick at the end. The alcohol really comes to the fore as this warms up. Very nice, but quads are one of my favorite styles. I would definitely drink this again."
"Overall (4.5/5): This is one masterfully engineered beer. A heady, heady brew that is beautiful to look at, packs a ton of flavor, and does a stellar job of honoring Belgian brewing traditions. Excellent in every way."

"Poured a very light colour for a quad. This is only my second or third quad, but I know the colour is supposed to be darker. It's sort of a yellowish red. The head was enormous for such a high-alcohol beer. I'm not sure how it was possible. I had trouble pouring it gently enough to get a decent amount of liquid in my glass without it foaming over. I'm fast becoming a fan of quads. Perfect for someone who likes the high alcohol and intense flavour of trippels, but dislikes coriander. This one is pretty good, but it is not as good as the last one I had, The Reverend. Sorry to get so personal in my reviews, but I like to give as useful a review as possible by giving my background in the style. This one is just a bit too bitter and dry for a quad. It tastes like it's been dry-hopped. From what I've read, I don't feel like this is the idea of a quad. The last quad I had was much better balanced. This one is quite good as well, but not at the same level. A really good quad doesn't need as much spicing as this one has, in my opinion, but then again my opinion is truly a humble one. I'm a total noob to the style. So, take that with a grain of salt."

"This beer deserves the best.

"outstanding beer, as all the smokestack series have been. i got a 120z. bottle of this for less than 3 bucks, what a deal! pours into a thick stemmed chalice a deep mahogany color with brown and red forces combining in stunning beauty. a thick tan head comprised of very large bubbles rests casually on top. smells very rich, caramel, toffee, belgian yeast, brown sugar, and raisins are all involved in a very complex aromatic experience. flavor is amazing too, for awhile i was thinking fruits like figs or dates as the label suggests. it really does have that dried sweet middle eastern fruits kind of flavor going on, but it also tastes very similar to those bit-o-honey candies you still see around sometimes. very very intriguing and delicious. intoxicating as hell at 10.5% and so yummy, be careful, this is a sipper despite its down easy feel. carbonation is medium but takes on a very laid back characteristic. medium body is perfect. its sweet in the finish, and warm from the alcohol, but not unpleasant in either sense. this is one of the best american quads i've ever had. really."

"Overall – This is a good beer overall. A little outside my comfort zone, but still a solid offering. Like I said, it’s probably the most appealing looking beer I’ve ever poured. It’s looks are downright impressive, and the rest of the drinking experience is good too. I’d recommend it and drink it again, although I wouldn’t likely buy it again."

"Due be careful. I did not catch the alcohol content when I purchased this one and it was quite the relaxer as I just kept drinking due to the malty sweetness."

"Overall: Best American attempt at a quad that I’ve tried so far. A solid beer."
""
""
"Dates and raisins again provide the sweetness. Cheesy funkiness and some slight boozy flavors. Not much complexity, but still a very rewarding beer."
"Overall - For a beer that is complex in taste, it manages to come together very well. To top it all off, it goes down very easy as well! I'd recommend this to any craft beer lover, or to any beer lover in general!"
"Pours a dark red with a brownish hue. Nice white head. Very sweet aroma of malt, brown sugar, and dark fruits (raisin, fig) paired with the yeast. Very sweet taste, as you'd expect from the style: raisin, figs, some brown sugar coated banana, some breadiness and alcohol. Medium bodied to this and active from the carbonation. A nice quad but its a style of beer that I generally find too sweet and this is no exception."

"Poured from 12oz bottle to snifter: What a brilliant color - a bright, glossy ruby with a finger and a half of off-white to tan head after an aggressive pour. Good lacing. Light, needlepoint beading. Nose is stuffed with delicious Belgian yeast. Soft citrus and pungent floral sweet bread. Refreshingly light and approachable for a quad. All the highlights of the nose carry through to the taste buds with the addition of a subtle licorice presence and clove. Really enjoy this beer, it’s far less invasive than most true Belgian quads but still complex and intriguing. The feel is appropriate. Overall, this is a unique take on the style, while still being true to its origins. Well done."
"O- Very good Quad. Had nice sweet malt, breadiness, and dark fruit without the dry, metallic yeast notes like some others have."
""
"Re-evaluated January 2015. Mediocre at best for a quad. Thin and harsh from a 12 oz bottle. I feel like this has suffered a lot since the brand changed ownership. Ratings adjusted."

"Pours a hazy deep amber to orange-ish color withh a tan head. In the aroma, sweet dark fruit and a bit of alcohol. In the taste, licorice, dark fruit, a small sweetness to dryness, and a alcohol note all the way through. An Alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small licorice and alcohol like aftertaste. Quite muted flavors, but nice flavors and a mellow alcohol throughout."
""
"This poured out as a nice looking brown color with a light tan head on top. The smell of the beer has a sweetness to it along with some fruity essences on the nose. The taste of the beer had a sweet dark malty flavor with some of the Belgian sugars doing their thing as well as the dark fermented fruit flavors. The mouthfeel of the beer was creamy with a good carbonation to it. Overall I wouldn't say it's my favorite Quad, it's good but not really one that I would rave about. I would drink it again though."
"O- Best American quad I've had yet. Really solid."
"Appearance is red-brown with an off-white head. Its` nose has caramel, dark fruits, brown sugar and raisins. A fairly typical aroma for a quad.

"D: This was a decent quad, but not very refined and far from a Trappist brew. The scent and taste were ok, and the body was good enough, but the alcohol was hot, so it must be sipped. Not sure if age would help, but it couldn't hurt. Not a must have beer."

"Very woody. The sweetness is on the lips as you sip, but it tends toward a dry alcoholic intensity. The aroma is very beguiling-- caramel apples and brandy. More than a slight oxidized taste. Batch number 58312, so this must be from early 2010."
""
"Overall it is decent, but not as good as other quads I have had. A richer malt body would improve things in my mind."
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Dark fruit nose. Flavor is sweet dark fruit, not cloying. Nice quad. Warming, but higher ABV is hidden. $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma. Best by Apr 27, 2013."

"Almost great. Boulevard can crank out some execellant Belgian style beers in the Midwest."
""
""
"This is a wonderful beer. It’s complex flavors liven the senses just as quickly as the large amounts of alcohol numbs them. This beer’s head is as short as a marines hair cut. Reporting for duty it leads the charge to battle beer boredom. An initial blast of freshness and hops. As the hops fizzle away the tongue relishes in rich caramel, oak, cherries, and ale. Every sips swings between fresh and light, and rich and smooth. The aroma is great, but it is not strong."
""
""
""
"Another winner from Kansas City. How can you not like a quad that is packed with fruit, isn't overly fizzy or belchy, doesn't overpower with yeasty booze, has a subtle taste of almonds AND goes down well with an obscene fistful of Nestle chocolate chips? The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't make it impossible to sight-read Schubert song transcriptions at the piano. Well worth the cost."

"Overall: If you like the taste of pear, you should love this as it is about as pronounced here as in any beer I have had. I like how the bread and other flavors interact with it. This ranks right up there with the best domestic quads. I will get this again."

"Overall: A fairly sugary beer that screams dessert. Very nice to curl up with and enjoy a movie at the same time."

"O- Easy to drink. Quite tasty. Not too sweet. Will look for more."
"Cheers!"
"D - Would get this again. One of the best Quads I've had in a long time. Very impressed."
"Mouthfeel: Perfect for my liking, not as heavy as a Belgium quads often are."
"overall, I think this is an average quad. Not terribly priced though at $9 a four-pack. dont know if i can find a better quad for less."
"Medium mouthfeel with only a slight notice of the alcohol. Didn't expect a Quad this good from Boulevard, but the Smokestack series scores again."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy caSSino for giving me this one as he saw I had never ticked it. Thanks buddy! Served from bottle into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Poured red brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, fruit, dark fruit, banana, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, and fig. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The complexity on this one was quite nice and kept me going back for more. My only gripe on this one was that the alcohol definitely let itself be known throughout. While this didn't kill the enjoyment of this brew by any means, I wish it would have been toned down just a touch and been replaced with more dark fruit notes. A definite must try."
"I'll stick the the original kings of quads here, the Belgians make a better quad. This is, however, a very clean and easy to drink cheaper alternative."
"This is an easy drinking beer with a descent flavor. Could use more bitterness to balance out the sweetness."
"O - A pleasant surprise. I was not expecting something this amazing from a $9 bottle. Very, very drinkable. Not sure if it gets much better than this."
"Overall: Some of the sharp citrus mellows as it warms, but begins to taste rather flat. Really good appearance but lacking in the taste department."
"O - It's not bad, something about the taste didn't leave my mouth right. Tasted a bit artificial and harsh. Not a bad beer though, but not great."
"O - I thought this was a good beer, unsure if I'd buy it again, but it is nice."
"Poured in a snifter glass. Shows a deep copper color with a smallish tightly bubbled white head that shows moderate retention. Smells of brown sugar and candied dark fruits mostly with a hint of pepper and spicy yeast. Taste is sweet candied fruit and brown sugar mixed with a bit of pepper, yeast, and ethanol goodness. Medium to thick body, spirited level of carbonation, sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, finally a solid American Quad I can relate to well!"
"O: this was a reall incredible brew, im a big fan of this style and i think this one is a homerun, my biggest concern is that this one might gave just passed ommegang three philosophers which has a particularlly important place in my heart, great style, great brew, well done"
"I enjoyed this beer much more the first time I had it - it seems much thinner than I remember - I think quad I think syrupy fruits. Definitely some of my all-time favorite bottle art, though."
"O- This beer has some nice fruit estery flavors with some good caramel character but there is a brassy wheatwine bite that just doesn't taste right. I'm hoping age will help this mellow as I think it is close to being a great beer but now I just think it is a bit odd."
"A deep amber hue, some slight cloudyness and a humongous head bring this beer as a feast for the eyes. Smells of sweet yeats, spent grain, lemons and grapefruits hit the nose. A palate is built of belgian candy, belgian yeast, andblack spicy pepper. But unfortunately the spicy alcohol seems to dominate an otherwise fantastic quad. Medium body, very warm, and a heavily carbonated brew gives the mouth a lt to take are of. I like it, I would have it again, most likely split with a buddy."
"D/O: This American-brewed quadrupel hits a number of authentic notes proficiently, yet it is only really comforting and enjoyable in the finish. However, late flavors leave a strong impression, making it become more compelling as the glass is emptied. It volunteers for duty against complex spicy food, such as Indian, which is consistent for abbey-style strong ales."
"This comes across like a beer that has been blended with a aperitif, like a cognac. The swallow is of white pepper. Very high carbonation while the body is nearly oily. Alcohol is also strong, leaving warmth in the belly."
"Given that St. Bernardus is roughly the same price, this is quite a tough sell. An inferior quad, and an unfortunate miss from Boulevard."
"Verdict: Really top notch Belgian Quad. This is my first beer from Boulevard and it will certainly be a place to remember. One of the best American quads I’ve had and rivals many that come from Belgium."
"Full bodied and chewy. A mouth coater. Wonderful to drink, but the alcohol will bite you. A great version of the style."
"Pours a deep copper color with a smallish tightly bubbled white head that shows moderate retention. Smells of brown sugar and candied dark fruits mostly with a hint of pepper and spicy yeast. Taste is sweet candied fruit and brown sugar mixed with a bit of pepper, yeast, and ethanol. Medium to thick body, spirited level of carbonation, sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I liked this a lot, it smells and tastes wonderful. That said, I would have like it a bit lighter on the carbonation."
"O: A solid quad, very drinkable for the style, but it is certainly a beer you could open up and drink throughout the night as well."
"Kind of starts off a bit harsh but ends up balancing out decently with warmth. I think it is a bit alcohol heavy and somewhat medicinal, although not enough to call it a wasted effort."
"A pretty big Quadrupel with some refinement issues."
"Overall it's a good quad."
"Pretty solid stuff. Lots of complexity."
"Overall: Wow. Boulevard has done it again with their Smokestack series. I love thier Tank 7 Sasion, and I really love this Quad. An excellent American interpretation of the style, and pretty close to the Belgian Trappist versions of this style (and that's quite a compliment!). Will buy and drink this one again for sure!"
"Doesn't come close to matching the Belgian greats of the style, but good for an American interpretation. Certainly one of the easier drinking quads I've had and at less than $3/12 oz it's a good deal."
"Nice carbonation and creamy chewy body. Quite an alcohol kick. I'm a fan of this brew not quite on the same level as my love for the bbq, but very close. This guy stacks up quite nicely with any Belgian quad."
"The taste is solid although not as world class as I think some give it credit for. Maleness hits you right away with a somewhat chewy bread pudding note that follows and finally a rush of carbonation finishes you off. Not bad."
"O: Overall this beer was very awesome i had some of the smokestack series before and i'm looking forward to rating the rest including the collaboration with deschutes"
"This is a nice american made example of a quad. I prefer a La Trappe Quad which has more sweetness, but this is one hell of a complex brew. Drinking it, I could swear this is barrel aged, but I guess not. Boulevard really cranks out some quality beers and this one is no exception. Not to mention, the price point is solid as well."
"overall a never good quad, easily one of the better american renditions i've come across but naturally falls short of the belgian archetypes (the rocheforts and westvleterens of the world). would like to try the barrel aged version (BBQ) when it's released."
"O: This beer is very good, but it is not perfect. It seems to be a bit too agressive; usually I find quads to be a little more subtle than this. On the other hand, how often do you find a quad that is this good for the price? I think I paid $2.85 for the bottle, and that's in Alabama. It's a good value for every now and then, but not a regular brew."
"This is a big complex beer that stands alone. I'd love to try it again with a strong smoky cheese or a creme brulee. I look forward to it in a snifter!"
"good job by Boulevard Brewing. fantastic quadruple. i think this could use a bit more age on it, as the flavors were still a tad on the raw side, but still...well done!"
"Not long ago, while perusing the beer selection at a local liquor emporium, I decided to give this one a shot ($8 for a 750). Arriving home, I cracked it open (quite a chore) and poured it into a tulip. Poured a slightly hazy burnt orange color with a good beige head. Aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit and sweet caramel. On the palate, this one was medium to full bodied, with flavors of dark fruits, candi sugar, caramel and booze."
"Medium body and nice stickiness. Just faint warming. I would have liked just a tad less carbonation, but it's not bad. These guys do some nice stuff, pretty good American version."
"Pours a amber brown with a 1 finger head that lasts into my ccb snifter. Aroma of fruity figs and raisins, bready malts with a heavy yeasty nose. Taste follows the nose with sweet fruits, malts and yeast. Alcohol is present more than other quads but still fairly smooth. I would love to try this in a corked and caged 750, bottle conditioning in a larger bottle makes a big difference."
"O: Not as good as BBQ, but very few beers are IMO. This one is readily available in the Midwest and is one of the stars in Boulevard's line-up. I'm sure I'll have it again."
"Body is medium for the style. As it warms gets a little more syrupy. Some time would not hurt this bottle which says best by 4.27.13"
"Been enjoying my trip through Boulevard's offerings (seeing as they're now all over the place here in the Chicago 'burbs), which means I'm lookin' forward to this one. It pours a clear garnet-ruby topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises fig, rye bread, red apple skin, light raspberry, black pepper, nutmeg, light cocoa powder, and toffee. The taste holds notes of caramel, rye bread, black pepper, fig, light plum, light strawberry, red grapes, and a light sprinkling of chocolate powder. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice quad, one that deftly balances the bready, sweet, and fruity characters very well."
"Overall: $10.99 for a four pack and it is worth it. The body and flavor are both well-balanced. Many subtle flavors at work. It's really a fantastic beer."
"O: To be honest, it's a pretty good try at the elusive quad, but not at the level of the real thing. Perhaps this one's past its prime, or not there yet? It really does have a champion nose, but doesn't quite live up to it. Got it in a random trade, so I can't comment on the value."
"Comes out of the bottle a pretty and very inviting clear coppery red-brown with a nice light tan head that is none too persistent. Malty aroma has a strong spicy undertone, mainly cinnamon and cloves and quite appealing, with just a touch of caramel. Texture is fizzy, dancing on the tongue and leaving a fairly persistent fizz on a malty, caramel finish. Look for this one!"
"Note to prospective tasters: The four-pack of twelve-ounce bottles at $9.99 seems a far better buy than the twenty-two ounce bomber at $8.99. However, the bomber with its caged cork makes an elegant presentation for a special occasion."
"O- Very solid rep of the style, quality shit meng."
"o - Overall an above average quad; I think with a few more months on it it could have been even better. Would like to have it again."
"D/O- good, middle of the road quad. Widely available pushes this over the edge with me. Thank you boulevard for the Smokestack Series."
"O - I think this is a fine Quad and am sort of regretting not having picked up another one. It will age well, I suspect, and once the heat is died down a bit, it'll be real good."
"Overall: I find I am greatly enjoying this beer. I had some misgivings at first because of the aroma, but was pleasantly surprised thereafter. A good brew."
"O: This is a great beer, glad I picked it up would buy this one again for sure"
"O: All in all, this is a nice and drinkable quad, but fairly light and really doesn't compare to others in the style."
"Overall: Extremely well made Quad that further proves how well Boulevard can nail the appearance and mouthfeel of Belgian beers (most US craft brewers fail at these aspects). I just wish it was a little less sweet."
"D: Really a nice quad that is very flavorful and has a nice complexity.  My only gripe is the alcohol heat.  A bit off-putting and it makes it much less enjoyable and easy to drink.  It's not hot enough to not enjoy, but it's a bit too powerful for my taste.  Other than that, this is a really good quad.  This will probably be better with some age, so I'm going to revisit it in a year or so."
"Overall: It is nice quad. Another good beer from the smokestack series!"
"O- I purchase at least 1 every time I go to the liquor store. Pairs well with pretty much all food, and works as a winter ale or a night time summer one when sipped slowly. It's also my go to beer when showing why I like Belgians or abbey ales."
"I liked this beer. A good example of the style and one I would definitely have again."
"O: Not a bad American interpretation of the style. One of the better ones in America. Would love to see what some age can do with this."
"O- A good sipper overall, not a true Belgian quad but not a bad shot from a brewery out of Missouri."
"O: Very tasty. Glad I traded for it."
"Fairly sweet overall, with a bit heavy carbonation but still a nice beer."
"Brought to the beer club by a friend - definitely a tasty beer to have again!"
"O: Seems like a good beer. Reminds me of apple cider with alcohol added. Definitely nothing saying it's bad. Might not be my style, but still enjoyable."
"Sixth Glass pours something in between maroon and more of a brown color, but it fades to a clear ruby when held to light. The cream colored head is almost out of control, more than four fingers tall and threatening to spill out the glass. Head retention is solid, but the complete lack of lacing is a major letdown. The nose is a bit higher on peppery phenols as compared to dark fruits than usual, but there's also a nice background note of overripe banana that I don't always find in quads. The flavor just can't hang with the best of the style. The most important thing for me in a beer like this is to have a solid sweet fruity base to hold the rest of the beer together. While there are certainly notes of plum and figs, they aren't nearly potent enough to keep the pepper and clove yeast notes from, together with a generous warming sensation from the alcohol, running roughshod over the brew. The body ends up on the light side for 10.5%ABV, and the carbonation is middle of the road, and just a little bit dull. In the end, the beer captures neither the creamy texture (despite a dry finish) nor the expressive carbonation of a world class quad. I had high expectations for Sixth Glass, having really enjoyed my previous Boulevard offerings (including BBQ), but this goes to show just how hard brewing a top notch quad is."
"Cheers!"
"Overall- A very, very nice American crafted quad. I only expect this to smooth out with some age as it approaches its best by date, and should hold sturdy even beyond that. Have the other 3 bottles in the cellar and will probably pick up some more at some point. Solid beer and at a good price point all things considered, definitely would recommend this."
"mouthfeel - strong and warming, more of a wintertime quad. syrupy, but crisp."
"This is a nice beer"
"Drinkability is great, not my favorite style prefer a good Dubblel but this one is very well done and I am wishing I could get more locally. Nuff said if you see it buy it you will not be disappointed."
"Well worth a try if you are lucky enough to be in an area Boulevard distributes its fine beers to."
"O: Its definitely a quad, but its not quite as refined as I've come to expect from what is probably one of the most refined and complex styles going. It went really well with my roast Cornish Hen for what its worth."
"O- overall, i think that this would greatly benefit from some time in the cellar. its a little hot right now and i think the flavors would blend better if it had a little age on it. one of the better american quads that ive tried recently."
"O - Tasty and balanced, I could see myself drinking this frequently."
"Pretty good but not my favorite of the Smokestack series."
"O: Bready and fruity with a big alcohol kick. Pretty good but would benefit from a year or two of cellaring."
"o - overall a nice US quad, better than most, but doesn't hold a candle to the flagships."
"D- Compared to the few other quads I've had, this one fell way behind. The dark fruits weren't as strong and drank a little bitter. Doubt I'll have another one... unless they are giving them away. lol"
"Overall: A nice beer! The alcohol is still very firm, but that's not completely unexpected, and was why I pulled the bottle to help put a bullet in my day. Quads are good ""contemplate your life"" beers, this one is doing the trick."
"Overall: Good start, needs some improvement."
"D/N - A good sipper. This one bottle will last me well past the hour."
"overall - while the beer is not the greatest example of the style the flavor is there and it is very enjoyable"
"Poured into a tulip glass this beer has a light copperish color with a really nice red tinge on the edges when held up to the light. Has a light tan head, that was 1.5 fingers high. Left a light lacing on the glass throughout sipping it. Really like the smell on this one. Some dark brown sugar, dark fruits like plum and a great smell of sourdough bread. Taste follows suit. Balance is great in this beer. The sweetness is not overwhelming at all. Plenty of fruit and spice, and bready yeast are there. Carbonation is well tuned to keep this 10.5% beer fairly light. This is my first Boulevard beer, but it certainly won't be my last based on the quality of this beer."
"Overall this is a very nice beer. I am happy that Boulevard will be coming to Chicago soon, I want to get more of this one."
"Pours a very light color for the style--light copper with a bit of a reddish hue. Single-finger off-white head starts it out. Eventually the head fades into a light collar with a few spots of lacing on the side of the glas. The nose has some faint dark fruits plus a bit of lightly-sweet malt. Perhaps a hint of caramel. Nothing too complex. A bit of booze there as well. The flavor has dark fruits, cherries, light alcohol, and a bit of sweet malt. Everything melds together quite well. Medium body with lowish carbonation. Overall, pretty good. Glad I got to try this."
"O: Tasty and quite drinkable for 10.5% ABV, pretty solid quad all around and for $3 a bottle this is a steal. There are better quads out there but no better bang for the buck, at least from what I've had."
"O: A great beer-- one I will revisit often. Thank you, Boulevard, you have another winner."
"D - Better than I expected, despite the ABV presence it didn't feel like much of a sipper to me. Enjoyable brew from Boulevard."
"I pour in the dredges as promised and notice a massive increase in the breadiness of the nose. Very scone-like now on each whiff. Flavor doesnt change as much but the nose is dramatic. This is a very nice big beer that I would probably buy again if it were on the shelves here and I was looking for a one bottle buzz."
"Pours a beautiful deep, hazy, amber color with an off white fizzy head. The aroma I get is mostly yeast. The mouthfeel is medium, very carbonated, a little bit of that creaminess you expect from belgians but certainly not as much as a Trappist. The higher alcohol creates a perception of bitterness and does give off some warmth that flirts with being hot. The flavor is suitably complex with a rounded malt character, figs, maybe a hint of orange, some peppery character. With the high alcohol you sometimes get the flavor of some type of liquer. I've had quadrupels that have hidden the alcohol flavor more, but this is a well made beer."
"The appearance and smell are by far the best attributes of this quad. I had big hopes that quickly faded after tasting. Not a bad beer but doesn't match up with some of the Belgian/Netherlands versions."
"Pours a hazy browned-orange with a beautifully thick caramel colored head and smells malty and lush with sourwood honey, apricot, bread and white raisin flavors. The palate has a sweet and alcoholic delivery with a moderate level of oily hop character balancing the loads of robust malty sweetness- flavors of peach, caramel and black pepper- and a full and somewhat creamy body. Finish is long, with more of that peppery spice and apricot."
"(D)- A decent quad. Very rich and earthy at the same time. Might need some time to mellow out, but I do wish more fruits were present."
"D--Strong, it is a quad. Probably not a beer I would sit and drink a bottle of...Oops, oh yes I did."
"D: started out strong but ended short of perfection. As a whole it was a little out of balance; I found the alcohol too strong and not well integrated. Fairly drinkable but not something I'll be returning to."
"Great extra in a trade w/ GCurlow, thanks! Nice robust head atop a reddish brown amber beer - a little lighter for the style I'd say. Nice retention. Aromas of fruit at first, bananas and apple pie, sweet spices, sort of fluffy. Wow, surprised by the palate here which is nothing like I was expecting from the nose. Everything leading up to the first sip was pointing towards a lighter profile for a quad but this is pretty beefy. Very sweet up front, brown sugar and maple candy, caramel. Some bready malt undercurrents but really nothing too out of the ordinary beyond the sweetness. Slick slightly chewy mouthfeel. I gotta say this is the first Blvd beer that I haven't been totally blown away with - still a decent take, maybe just not up my alley."
"Medium bodied, high carbonation, sweet, and smooth. I like much about this beer, but it does not seem like it is true to style. The 10.5 % abv is well hidden, which is a plus."
"I thought this beer was very smooth and had a good taste. Had a bit of a fruity taste to it. I would suggest drinking it at a warmer temperature, because it was too cold straight from the refrigerator."
"Medium-bodied with pleasant carbonation, the mouthfeel is good. Drinkability, however, is held back by the booziness. Again, I'd love to see what a bit of age does to this one."
"D: Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it. A real sipper, and noticeably alcoholic."
"D: Very drinkable, At over 10% abv it definately sneaks up on you. Wanted another right away, probably lucky it only came in a 4 pack!!"
"D: overall not the greatest example of the quad. Still an enjoyable drink."
"Age and enjoy"
"Drinkability is pretty good. Solid quad."
"D: Excellent. High ABV is the only downside (drinkability speaking)."
"D: This beer is a respectable drinker. I'm enjoying it enough to have it again, but it wouldn't be a top choice when in the mood for something special. This is my first taste of a Smokestack Series Boulevard brew. It's a decent beer, but I have higher hopes for some of their other offerings."
"This was my 3rd sitting with The Sixth Glass. I wanted to make sure that my first impression was reliable. I wouldn't say this is all that drinkable as high abvs usually aren't. The perfume and strong alcohol flavors keep it from being a really good beer. It's good, but falls short of the big boys it's modeled after. Perhaps the 750ml bottles offer something more."
"D- Unbelievably sweet. Like ZERO bittering agents come forth to combat the sweet factors on this beer. It really starts to detract on the drinkability here with such overwhelming sweetness. Some quads I feel I can drink a gallon, some I feel a glass is too much. This is almost in that glass is too much category. It opens amazing, but it starts to build into something rancid. Least the super high alcohol is well placed."
"Will definitely buy again."
"Very nice glass full of darker ale with a lite hint of malt and fruit. The smell gives you the feeling it wil be a very fruit ale, but it is not overwhelming. I split the bottle and it might get a little sweet after a whole bottle. Overall it is a great pour..."
"I'd buy this again. Might share with my no-hop friends."
"Really nice looking beer, although a little light four the style. I expect deep mahagony and get deep amber. Nice carb, nice lacing, great retention. Aroma is full of phenol, peppery, and spices. Faint roastyness and raisin, but why less than usual. Flavor is spicy and peppery. There is some chewy malt and deep flavor, but I am missing the deep dried fruit flavors I'm acustomed to. Plainly put feels more like a saison, dry, attenuated but well carbed. Yeah its quafable, but I'm not so sure a quad should be. I think its a tasty beer but suffers from poor yeast selection."
"Not a bad beer, but has the potential to be so much better. Glad I got to try this one."
"Drinkable in a sense, but a bit too much alcohol heat. Not as bad at many American breweries' attempts at a quad when it comes to this though."
"The mouthfeel is slightly heavy, and oddly spritzy. The carbonation could stand to get knocked down a peg or two. A bit harsh on the finish. Good full flavors. The booze is noted at the first sip, but either I'm getting used to it, or it wears off on subsequent sips. This is followed by dark fruits, mild candy-like sweetness, and yeast on the finish. This was a pleasant sipper, but certain aspects could be tweaked IMO. Not the best Quad out there, but a good one no-less."
"D: Delicious. I would definitely recommend this."
"The Sixth Glass was a hazy dark amber color with fine particles floating throughout. It had a large beige head with good retention and minimal lacing. The smell was malt, yeast aromas, and spices with some alcohol. The taste was quite fruity with clove-like spices and some alcohol. The finish was long, dry, and throatwarming. This beer was medium-full in body with medium carbonation. Drinkabity was good."
"Poured into a pint glass, a nice red-orange hue with a finger of thin head that settles into a loose fringe on the surface, leaving almost no lacing. Smell is sweet, fruity, and somewhat similar to a fruit wine other than the hint of malt. Taste is initially all deep fruit and sugar sweet, giving way to a nice malt and warm alcohol finish that cleans up the sweetness fairly well. This is fairly drinkable for the ABV, but the sweetness begins to stick around torwards the end. Two would be enough, but they would be thoroughly enjoyed."
"Drinkability: Yum. This is a big, flavorful, and immensely enjoyable beer. My second from Boulevard and a great comeback from the disappointing last beer."
"The drinkability is pretty good with this beer, this is a sipping beer, treat it as so."
"Looks brown until light reveals a reddish hue; small head that dies away quickly; aroma is delicate and inviting, with candied sugar, hints of banana, and even some nuttiness present; taste is simply impressive, making me wonder why I've waited so long to try this; the body is outstanding, I really can't recall ever having a 10% beer feel this light and bubbly; kudos to Boulevard! Back to flavor... Bread, caramel, maybe slight almond, bananas, milk chocolate--lots going on, making it hard to dissect, but easy to enjoy and appreciate. I'm really enjoying this and will certainly be buying it again."
"D -- Worth the purchase. Another win for the smokestack lineup."
"During the holiday's I've been drinking nothing but Belgians and this was today's beer. This beer has a sexy apperance, but is lacking in mouthfeel and taste. It has a wonderful head and is a very nice dark ruby, but something was missing when I tasted it."
"Opinion: This is a very well crafted beer. I may have had this beer for 6 months, and it has held up perfectly. It doesn't quite have the sheer malt complexity that some of the Belgian greats have, but it is something to be said that I am comparing this beer to the likes of St Bernardus, or Koeningshoeven. I am very impressed with the overall flavor and presentation of this beer. It is of world-class quality and I would definitely recommend it."
"My hats off to the guys at Boulevard for this exceptional brew. This is the best beer I've had from Boulevard and I would have to say it's one of the better beers I've tasted as of today. With 10.5% abv it was not to strong as compared to others with the same abv. It is a well balanced beer which i poured out of the bottle into a goblet at around 45 degrees. Great taste, very drinkable, and a great all around beer."
"smokestack is no joke and this is no exception."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Pretty easy-drinking for a Quad, and great aroma, which made the taste a bit of a letdown. Clearly an Americanized Quadrupel, but still really tasty. Absolutely trying at least once, plus the price is right."
"Drink- I could do another one even at the 10.5% These 12oz bottles could do some damage in a 4 pack."
"Notes: A bit above average Quad. Not bad, but alcohol was a little strong. I enjoyed drinking it, but I wasn't blown away by it."
"D: Another whopper of a beer. The Sixth Glass is a think-piece about a mid-level beer struggling with its own limitations in the harsh face of stardom. Almost famous indeed."
"This is my first review so bare with me here. First off, the bottle, a 750ml, is quite impressive. The overall feel of what you are getting yourself into can be felt by the great design of the bottle. To the beer, absolutely brilliant! It was a great drink and went down very well. Mouthfeel was again exceptional. The taste, well it hit all the right buds. And at 10.5%, drinking the whole thing in one setting definitely got me buzzed! Boulevard's The Sixth Glass should be on anybody's short list of beers to try."
"D - Pretty enjoyable although I wouldn't drink a lot of this at once. The 750ml bottle is something to share with friends, not to drink alone!"
"Mouth feel is just about perfect. Great level of carbonation and the medium body is exactly what I would expect from a quad. This is one insanely drinkable beer...it certainly doesn't feel like 10.5% while drinking. It is very easy to down the whole bottle very quickly, but it is probably a good idea to take your time and enjoy."
"D: The bommer is tough to put down in a single sitting. Great to share. The high ABV makes it tough to finish (while standing), however, this is a great american interpretation of a belgian. I would purchase again"
"D: I put down the 750mL myself. A good beer, but against the true Belgians, this falls a bit short."
"D: OK."
"D - Very well done ale. This is a perfect bottle to share at 10.5% ABV and coming in a 750mL bottle. Get some friends over to enjoy it with."
" Body is creamy throughout with good carbonation, but, as stated, the finish is just a little chalky. A nice take on a Belgian quad by an American brewery. Enjoyable."
"D - Good drinkability, probably a good idea to split. Became more complex as it warmed. This is a very very tasty beer."
"*Edit: by midway through the bottle, the residuals are now lacing on my glass. Small development, but worth noting."
"Great sipper to welcome in some fall temperatures."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied with a fairly smooth mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden nicely by the dark fruity flavors."
"Overall not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. What I enjoy about Belgian styles is the subtle nuances and depth of flavors. This one just punches you in the face."
"D - Fantastically drinkable. Will definitely seek it out again."
"I can remember the first time I ever had The Sixth Glass. BeerAdvocate member Turamarth and I were just getting deep into craft beer. This was the first Smokestack Series beer we had, Hell, it was the first Quad we'd ever had. I remember the amount of cinnamon spice and raisin flavor being intriguingly strong and I especially remember thinking that this was the booziest beer I'd ever had. My palate has grown an awful lot since then. I still find it to be too boozy tasting but this is a fine, fine beer. One of the best American examples of the Quadrupel style."
"This beer has an impressive appearance there is a lot of carbonation. The head was thick but disappeared quickly. The lace was not thick as one would imagine. The aroma is complex. There are strong scents of wood and fruit. The body is dark reddish amber. There are a lot of wood flavors which were nice but I felt it did not counter the alcohol flavor enough. You can definitely feel warmth from the 10.5 percent alcohol."
"Typically big for the style and drinks appropriate for style, maybe on the easier side of it."
"D - Very drinkable, very delicious! I will be sure to pick this one up again. Nicely balanced and a very enjoyable complexity."
"This is a great beer. The aromas and tastes are very complex, and ever-changing as it warms. While the high alcohol obviously makes it a sipper, the muted alcoholic taste makes it very inviting to take sip after sip."
"D - While a good example of the style, this is not something I consider to be drinkable to the point that I could have more than one. It has a candy-like element that keeps me from enjoying as more than a digestif. Very good -seek this out -great for sharing, thanks again Karen!"
"D: Tastes like a liquid mincemeat pie! Very tasty."
"I don't say it too often but this is a beautiful looking beer. I really didn't find this too complex but a pleasant beer overall. It is a fairly fresh bottle as the best before date isn't for another 3 years so at $9 a bottle I may grab another to age a bit. It was certainly a fine companion for watching the end of Dexter season 3..."
"Overall, a very powerful drink full of sinful deliciousness. Be careful or this one could damn you."
"EDIT: upon re-review multiple times, I'm upping my rating on this one to a perfect FIVE. I've done enough reviews that I know that this one is as close to perfect as it's likely to get, and I have never, ever liked a beer more than this one. If something else winds up beating it, I'll change my review back to the original 4.85 it was on the first go-round. Even on my fifth or sixth re-visitation of this brew, I still absolutely love it every time. This is my favorite smokestack, favorite quad, and remains my highest rated beer for good reason."
"Got this as an amazing extra in a trade with wnoble. Pours a murky bownish-reddish-orange with a huge head which never got below a half finger of off white. Lacing was lasting but thinner. Nose was dark fruit, some alcohol and yeast, grapefruit and spices. Taste was complex and very tasty - starting with dark fruit, moving to sweet cinnamon, grapes and dates with notes of chocolate and a wonderful interplay with sweet and bitter and alcohol warming at the end. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy, almost chewy and well carbonated. Alcohol is whew - there, in feel and in effect. Definitely a sipper. Liked this a lot and can imagine it would be even more wonderful if I had the discipline to have cellered this longer. Try this!"
"I knew absolutely nothing about this beer before trying it, though I had heard good things about the brewery. It poured a pale amber with an absolutely massive and very long-lasting head. The aroma was very unusual, with some sour elements that I did not expect, besides the usual malt and dark fruit notes common to Belgian Strong Dark Ales (or quadruples). On the palate the beer was delicious, with wonderful mouthfeel, some heat from the 10.5% alcohol, and maybe a hint of sourness? Or perhaps it was wood from cask aging? Hard to be absolutely sure, in spite of working my way through the entire bottle, trying to decide. The beer that I think it reminded me of the most was Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo, which is pretty high praise. I regret that this was the only beer from The Smokestack Series that I've been able to try, and I wish I could have brought a bottle or two back to Alaska to share."
"Amazing, Boulevard hits this one just right. Packed with flavor and small complexities, yet still very drinkable and even approachable. We've been to Belgium a few times and have tried numerous Belgian-inspired beers around the globe, and this one sits very close to the top."
"D: This one is too strong and intricate to pound back, but it's very drinkable. I'd pound them back until I fell off my chair. Fortunately, all it takes is a single bottle."
"M- Softly carbonated, slightly warming. In all it finishes clean."
"This is indeed a spot on quad. Sippable, complex and pleasant on the palate. One of the best tasting quads I've had yet."
"The body was a bit thinner than I like for this style. Drinkability was good, but again, this is one of my favorite styles, so I'm predisposed to like it. Overall, a pretyy good, but not great example of the style. Worth a shot if you see it."
"Overall a very heavy and tasty beer. A good after meal desert almost. I would not recommend drinking this with any food or shortly before or after a meal as it is VERY rich. Definitely pick this up if you have it on hand at any place around, I will definitely drink it regularly if I can find it around my hometown, but I have only seen it at Fred Meyers grocery."
"Picked up a bottle for $8.99 at the QFC in Bothell, then enjoyed at the in-laws place in Seattle on the 4th of July during fireworks. Served in stubby wine goblets. A bit lighter in color than I was expecting, as it was a lighter shade of chestnut than other quads I have tried. Decent sized head forms with the pour. Smell was very boozy, and full of ripe plum notes. Taste was very good and true to the quad style. Lots of raisin notes, with some black licorice, and a sugary aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick but smooth enough to enjoy. Drinkability was above average as it's a flavorful beer, but it's very hot with alcohol. Some aging might mellow this beer down a bit and do it some good. A nice example of a quad from a brewery that I was curious to try, as you can't find Boulevard in MA just yet."
"Not a bad beer, just not one that blew me away either. it is very drinkable for the alcohol level, I would just prefer a bit more complexity. Still, a nice beer, and I wouldn't mind trying this one again."
"The taste was bold and rich. Very strong malt and well spiced. Very mild bittering but it wasn't at all cloying. Alcohol was warming but not at all overpowering. Very good carbonation and mouth feel."
"Poured a hazy reddish orange color with an average frothy brown head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy tart fruit and small alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth sticky texture and lively carbonation. Medium to heavy dark fruit sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid complex brew."
"D: Delightful; flavorful, complex, but fairly balanced. The ABV will catch up."
"my fourth smokestack series sample and a pretty decent attempt by boulevard. not my favourite so far but definitely recommended...and definitely buzz inducing at 10.5 ABV."
"D - Excellent. I can't imagine someone not liking this. Also, I am beginning to suspect that Boulevard, all things considered, may be just be one of the best breweries on Earth."
"*Edit: Two hours later, as I sip this, I really find this a very enjoyable beer. I have no qualms about pouring out a pricey beer(hello, Darkness and Hunahpu!), but this was an excellent and welcome surprise. I'm upping the taste and drinkability to reflect that."
"Poured from a Champagne style bottle into a snifter, beer has a huge fizzy head with a murky reddish-brown body. The nose is sweet with sugar, Belgian candy and brown, along with a hint of molasses. Light to moderate phenols that just cover the alcohol. The taste is also rather sweet, more so than I would have thought but it is to style. All malt, bitterness only to balance slightly and a definite alcohol finish and linger. Mouthfeel is very full but due to the carbonation it seems lighter and bubbly, this could almost do the job of champagne. As drinkable as any beer this big can be, one that probably should be sipped and drinking 6 smaller glasses as opposed to chugging the bottle would probably be a good idea."
"There is caramel sweetness that will ooze out of my pores. There are dates and cherries, the oxidation slight and carefree. The booze lingers throughout the adventure, never overpowering, omnipresent. Each small sip a moment of divine pleasure. Subdued hops round out this beer beautifully. I announce the winner of round 1's pairings, and one of my favorite flavors of the day."
"This is a great take on a Belgium quad. The beer pours a clear dark reddish brown with some purple highlights. The nose is nice and complex with notes of raisins, brown sugar, dark cherries, malts and herbs. The palate is full bodied and caramelly, with soem fdark fruity flavors and notes of citrus, spice and herbs."
"A nice take on a Belgian quad... Sweet, fruity and caramelish, but balanced with a dry touch in the finish. Drinks well despite the boozy character."
"M&D: the mouthfeel remains as creamy-smooth and healthily-carbonated as any quality bottled-conditioned beer must dream to achieve... The body never goes too heavy - in fact extremely balanced and approachable against its alc. strength. Also, the hoppiness balanced with the fruity-maltiness in the aftertaste prolongs the depth and complexity altogether. All in all, this Quadruple-style ale is slightly too expensive, but I've made my efforts to fully enjoy and memorise every single drop from this bottle~~ This is perhaps the best bottled beer I've tried for many months now, even outperforming Westvleteren 12 as far as my last bottle last month is concerned."
"D - Very drinkable especially with the high ABV."
"D: A nicely strong brew, but a good one for the nicely strong you! Drink away boys. Drink away!"
"Drinkability is good for the style and ABV. This is a nicely crafted American-style Belgian-style quad overall."
"D: A good one to split amongst a few people. Maybe it is the banana overkill but definitely best split"
"This is a strong beer. The cherry bourbon quad blows it out of the water. But it's not bad, just the worst I've tasted in a stellar lineup. Kinda like Nick Swisher on the Yankees. Still Major League business but not even on the same level as Jeeter (Saison Brett) and A-Rod (BBQ)."
"D = Lacks balance between the sweet fruits and the alcohol. Reminds me of watered down raisinjack. I'll finish the bottle but won't buy another."
"Drinkability is incredible for such a boozy beer. I could pound this back quite easily. So delicious."
"Pours a cloudy medium brown with a khaki head. The aroma is dark fruit with some candi sugar, yeast and brown sugar. The aroma has something that reminds me of red wine. The flavor is brown sugar and dark fruits with some alcohol. The alcohol is a little boozy and also very warming. There is some light spicing in the flavor and once again something that reminds me of a dark, big bold red wine. Low carbonation and medium body. An excellent American quadrupel."
"D: High. This beer is delicious. I'll bump it down a peg to 'fairly high' due to the strength of the beer. One bomber of this and I would be gone."
"Overall, not my go to style. Been a while since I had one. But this seems to be a very balanced effort that gives the trademark quad characteristics without going to any real extreme. Very close to a barleywine in my opinion. Boulevard continues to impress with the smokestack series."
"Body is full, while mouthfeel is well-spiced and contains a small alcohol wash, which is not at all unpleasant. Come to think of it, I taste a little alcohol as well, but it too seems at home. Sixth Glass was drinkable in the sense that, splitting the 750 mL bottle with a friend, I did not become tired at all of the beer. Sixth Glass was not drinkable in the sense that, after splitting the bottle, I wouldn't feel comfortable driving for a while. All in all, very recommended."
"D: Hmmm....decently drinkable. The carbonation knocks it back ever-so-slightly because the taste makes up for it, but it's also heavy enough and in your face enough that it is a sipper to start with."
"D: Obviously, not a lightweight session beer at 10.50 ABV. Comparing it against other quads, the drinkability is good. I won't have a problem finishing the bottle in one sitting. Another great Smokestack Series offering!"
"Drinkability: Ok, so my two biggest complaints about are that it's a little too hot and a little too sweet. That aside, it's a solid brew. At 10.5%, I'm not gonna be pounding it down anytime soon, but it was a good sipper on a quiet evening in. BBQ it is not - the barrel notes and earthiness of the sugar really did work wonders with the relative lightness of this one - but it's a vast improvement over the Saison I had the other evening. Recommended."
"D: Excellent, given its' heft. The base beer of the almighty BBQ is a star in its' own right!"
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours an over ripe, bruised orange with a big, off cream head that leaves very, very little lacing. Of all the Smokestack beers, this one definitely has the worst head retention. The aroma is dark fruits muddled with dark malts. Fig, date, bruised apples, and over ripe cherries all come out in the nose. Mix that with toast, yeasty biscuits and a heavy dose of caramel. Also just a hint of alcohol comes through in the nose. The flavor is pretty typical Quad. Big raisins, dates, figs, bruised bananas and just a hint of bruised cherries. Also overly toasted bread mixed with overly caramelized sugar. The alcohol is there but well hidden. My biggest problem with this beer is its mouthfeel. It's just a bit thin for how big this beer is. Overall, this is my favorite standard Smokestack as long as Tank 7 doesn't go into regular production. Thanks Boulevard."
"D - I'm not going to be slamming this, but it's a very nice beer. Wish I could get more of it."
"D: a great quad with plenty of complexity. Thanks Zach!"
"D: This is a tasty and drinkable quad. Reminds me a lot of St. Bernardus abt 12 which is a good tihng. This is a winner from Boulevard!"
"Overall: Thank you monsterfat for this beer. It is pretty good. Definately a slow drinker."
"Picked up a couple Smokestacks in Iowa, where they are $2 cheaper than here in Minny. 6th glass was quite tasty, I haven't had a quad in a while so it was a nice treat. If I was a bigger fan of Belgians this would definitely be a mainstay in my fridge."
"D: For a quad this is extremely drinkable; goes down smooth and the alcohol isn't as dominating as the inital aromas would indicate"
"Not bad, but really boozy. Poured with a nice sized, foamy frothy, off white head and lots of lace. Color is rich walnut. Aroma is toffee, malty, and bananas. Flavor is malty sweet, with a little residual bitterness. body is very good, ditto carbonation. feel the alcohol at the end."
"This was quite enjoyable, I'm loving the smokestack series. Not quite Rochefort, but a nice beer here."
"Many thanks to wagenvolks for the trade! 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a nice murky dark orange with a very nice frothy khaki head that lasts and leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of dried fruits and spices with just a hint of alcohol. The taste is a very nice blend of sweet, dried fruits, figs and sweet burnt caramel, quite complex and very tasty! The beer is somewhat heavy bodied, but smooth carbonation does a good job of masking the 10.5% alcohol making this one a very nice sipper. I've enjoyed every beer I've had from this series, and this one is no exception!"
"Overall, I wish I had bought two of these so I could leave one in the cellar. It could sure use it."
"One to slowly enjoy, but certainly very nice."
"The taste has a strong malty sweet presence that encompasses the whole spectrum of sugary flavors from light candy sweetness to caramel to toffee to heavily caramelized brown sugar. That being said, this beer is not overly sweet. Notes of spice and dark fruits complement the malt and alcohol adds a pleasant warming spiciness. Bitterness and hop character get out of the way to let the malt shine."
"Poured from 750 ml corked bottle; it presented a caramel, herbs aroma with presence of alcohol, deep dark amber color, frothy tan foam head, medium sweetness and spicy taste (apple cider), thin feel, light medium body, I like the entire series of Smokestack brews from Boulevard but this is just average."
"Nice bottle presentation and cool labeling. I'm a little biased about this brewery because I bought a sampler a couple weeks back that was full of tasty beers. The smell is nice. Almost licorice, but definitely an overwhelming sweetness. As I poured the beer I got a great waft of scent. Tasty, tasty tasty! Rich chocolate, caramel, toasted almond flavor. Does have a fairly present alcohol flavor, but the acidity does not overwhelm the sweetness. The aftertaste does continue the sweetness but has a bit of a bitter alcohol feel too. No quadrupel is considered very drinkable to me. I can drink a bomber and that's about it. I could drink more, but I wouldn't enjoy it as I did the first bottle. So with that said, this was fairly drinkable for a quad. It didn't leave an overwhelming aftertaste."
"D- Really nice brew that had a definitely felt like an American Quad (if there is such a thing). Complex and flavorful. Definitely worth picking up."
"Taste is sharp and sweet, a little funky but still rich and strong. Very sharp but not too carbonated. Overall a really good, but I'd say go for the BBQ if you can it really kicks this up a notch."
"M&D - super velvety smooth, what a quality brew, rich and complex in flavor, full bodied, many different flavors create such a layered taste, one of the best, if not the best, American Quads i have ever had. nearly Rochefort levels"
"Reddish brown and impossible to see through with a fizzy tan head that slowly settles into a skim in the middle of my Chimay glass. The nose is belgian spice and dark fruit with fresh pumpernickel breadiness. The flavor is rich and spicy with flavors of gingersnap and hot buttered rum. Full bodied and highly carbonated with a warmingly alcoholic finish. A nice sipper for the money and a decent stab at the style, not on par with the best Belgian made examples but a fine brew worth checking out."
"a barley wine colored beer with a nice amount of head. prominent apple, bread, clove and a mild acidic quality. sweet burnt brown sugar caramel. a bit of alcohol on the nose but for a US quad not bad. sugar qualities similar to their triple. not a must but sufficient."
"an excellent example of the style now if I can get my hands on the Bourbon Barrel version we'll be in business."
"Flavor is warm. Obviously a lot of alcohol, some bitterness on the backend due to roasting. Lots of sweetness up front. There is some sour character in the beer as well. Beer is relatively thick in the mouth which is good. Drinkability suffers slightly due to high alcohol flavor. Overall a great quad."
"Pours an initially hazy amber color. Not quite brown. A giant head forms on top, falls back and leaves very sticky lacing. It then clears up pretty well, staying a nice clear amber color throughout. A nice looking beer, a little lighter in color than I would expect, but nice looking. The smell is incredibly nutty and raisiny, sticky like syrup, and a tiny bit toasty. It almost gets rich and buttery in the smell a bit. There's even hints of some different grains, maybe some regular sugars (un-starch converted kind). The taste kind of sticks out as a spicy, caramel syrup flavor. I notice some cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, maybe some other floral aspects. There's also a slightly bready, toasty aspect to the flavor, with a bit of earthy nuts. Pretty good, I like the somewhat clean profile in some respects. It's pretty full a bit medium, but not quite syrupy and sweet. The carbonation just sort of rushes in pleasantly, without a bite. The alcohol is a bit powerful, though quite normal for the style. Enjoyable, fits within the style, nothing wrong with it, but nothing outstanding. Recommended for those seeking out new examples of the style."
"I love the story on the back label, regarding the name, and I made sure to heed its lesson. This is a strong beer, and it tastes strong, so it's one to sit with for a couple hours if drinking it alone...and this long, lazy Sunday afternoon seems just right for such a thing..."
"This is a very well crafted brew from Boulevard... I'm dang impressed with this.. Its terrific..."
"if i could afford it i'd put away about four fifths of this magic elixer in a in a row."
"D: Very nice, and a good deal for what I got it for. Give it a show for sure."
"D - This is a nice complex beer to sip slowly and I would like to try this one latter sometime."
"D: That heavy is almost too much. What I do really like is the way that there isn't an alcohol burn, but when it gets to your chest it is very warming and then you really feel the alcohol. Like a good stiff drink."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful because it dances on the line between extremely attenuated and full bodied. Another highly drinkable beer out of the smokestack series. I wish I could get these beers here in Central PA. Highly recommended."
"Tastes all of that. A bit of bitter astringency which is normal enough for the style but still a fault, if you asked me. Bitter orange peel (not-quite-ripe blood orange juice). Some spiciness... Hints of anise."
"A tasty quad, next experiment; see how aging a bottle will change the alcohol character"
"Poured into tulip glass. Pours a nice dark amber color with a good amount of head that sticks around for a couple minutes but finally calms down. Has a decent lacing. Has an earthy smell with hints of caramel and malt. The taste is somewhat sweet with hints of caramel and fruit. The mouth feel is good with just the right amount of carbination."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but ironically, I feel like the balancing earthy bitterness in this one actually holds it back. Tone it down, pull back the alcohol, this one soars."
"Mouthfeel is gritty and fizzy. Noticeably strong."
"Overall Impression - Mediocre Quad. Nice color. Okay aroma. Very drinkable, but with other beers available I probably won't buy again."
"All and all another authentic Belgian beer. It doesn't quite live up to the Belgian greats. Nonetheless Sixth Glass is a tasty brew. It's a worthy addition to the Belgian beer landscape."
"Many thanks to all who have assisted me with obtaining this beer over time :)"
"Pours a slightly hazy light mahogany color with full fingered auburn head that resists fading and a nice amount of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is sweet malty Belgian yeast and doughy caramel. Adequately carbonated and full bodied, there is an initial sharpness and spicy character to the mouth feel. The flavors are a mirror of the nose. The 10.5% ABV is well integrated. A very nice drinker."
"received in trade approximately a year ago, probably from dirtylou, or perhaps from a kinder fellow"
"D: Fairly easy drinking, but it doesn't really all fit together, something tells me this beer may need to be beefed up one way or another in the brewhouse. Needs something, and I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a little bit more of a strong beer presence, which this lacks, seems a little separated is the best way for me to describe it. Okay beer, but won't seek out again."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. A ton of of flavor, a tad boozy, but that was expected. Splitting the 750 is a great idea. Good beer from Blvd, but make sure you aren't drinking it alone."
"Drinkability: Pretty satisfying beer, but the alcohol really sneaks up on you fast. It seems to be more highly drinkable than it should be."
"Drinkability: I'm going a little higher on this than I should because of that 10+% ABV, but it is pretty damn tasty and I really like the mouthfeel that allows me to continue tasting those malts."
"D: Pretty drinkable, it has a ton of alcohol and a ton of flavor, which is why they call it a quad I suppose. Good beer for sure but I had to split the bomber with a buddy."
"are there people that really just enjoy phenols? i wonder..."
"I love Quads - this is a very good quad, more in the Belgian style than some of the other, lighter American-styled quads. I really like this beer"
"Overall a little too one-dimensional with it's sweetness. I unfortunately have to compare it with some pretty great examples of the style, and it just doesn't stack up to its true Belgian counterparts. A decent value..."
"its not as drinkable as some beers but i only need a pint or two of this and im ready to pass out. it could easily by my favorite beer but i have so many i havnt tried yet."
"I haven't tried much from this brewer as we don't get their products in my state, but luckily their products are showing up in a neighboring state (about six miles away). The color of this was a dense, dark amber with tinge of garnet (when held against the light). The nose was redolent of sweet, spicy malt. On the palate, a quick burst of tiny bubbles followed by brown sugar, caramel and turbinado, then a slight bitterness on the palate and a long finish."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a decent quad, but lacking the depth you find in the best examples of the style. Still, I appreciate the strong flavor, a fine second choice, it certainly held up to the cigar quite well. Also, not a bad price for the packaging, another hallmark of the smokestack line."
"I was extremely surprised by how good this beer was. It was totally unexpected, so many flavors hitting me at once, all of them vying for my love...so damn good! It seemed like the perfect marriage of candied malts and dark fruit, a great all around quad. I'd like to know if this ages well...a part of me says no, but that may be because I have another bottle sitting down in the cellar. Bring on a Westy 12 somebody!!"
"Cork shot out of bottle, but luckily no foaming issues out of the bottle. Beer heavily carbonated, but quickly dampens down to some clinging on side of glass and on top of beer. Beer is muddy brown and very dark. Smell is quite appealing, with notes of dark fruit, especially cherry and plum. maltiness is there too. taste follows smell with hints of cherry and fig. Beer is syrupy and nicely carbonated. Some bitterness in the finish, but minimal. Beer is tasty as hell and highly recommended."
"I haven't had a whole lot of quads from US brewers, but this one was one of the better ones I remember. Definitely worth a shot."
"Boulevard The Sixth Glass Quadrupel Ale isn't as good as Long Strange Tripel, but I'm glad that it's readily available in my local grocery and I'm thrilled that it's only $7.99 per bottle. Even though I wouldn't sell my soul to Beelzebub for a bottle, this is a more than decent effort that deserves a look for anyone even remotely interested in the style."
"Thick and creamy this is a beer that stands up and say ""Hey, drink me idiot!"""
"Courtesy of ballewblake. 750ml bottle (batch 68081) served in my Allagash tulip. Pours copper in color, slightly hazy, with a half-inch off-white head; much lighter than your typical quad. Lots of floaties, but no lacing during the tasting. Nose is dark fruit, candi sugar and booze. Taste follows nose but I also get figs or apricots. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, lightly effervescent with some astringency at the finish. Easy drinking, but not as big as your typical quad-a little closer to a tripel in my opinion."
"I have more of these and it will be interesting to see how this matures with cellaring."
"Drinkability is within the style, but that's challenging. It's a big beer that wears it's strength in obvious ways. But it's a pretty good sipper."
"taste is smooth, malty, some cocoa, some dark fruit, and brown sugar, ends smooth and a little bitter."
"D=good, enjoyable beer alcohol hinders drinkability not because of taste."
"Toasted malts and singed banana bread up front. Sweet tropical fruits and bananas follow. Layers of plums, pears, and raisins come in, with hints of toffee, and coconut rum. Yeasty, with lingering ripe banana and toffee in the finish. Warming. Full-bodied, with a thick, smooth feel. Delicious and very well done!"
"Notes: Great beer!! I think Boulevard should make more extremebeers like this and their double-wide. I do like their pale ale a lot too. Cheers Boulevard! Well done!"
"D. Less complexity than other Quads. Overall a pretty good beer. In my location this an a easily accessible beer, and one I grab often."
"D: This bottle is not going to be an issue at all thanks to that feel. This SOB is going down nice and easy, not sitting heavily at all. ABV doesn't appear to be an issue in feel or taste, but I could see it catching up with you. I see this an easy kill on the 750 but not need to push it beyond there. Absolutely easy to kill 2 or 3 glasses though. A solid brew all around and really was a treat as my first Boulevard brew."
"Drinkability: Reminds me a bit of the Westvleteren 12 and that is high praise, although that beer and this are a bit too sweet and alcoholic to be particularly drinkable"
"Perhaps I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have in the middle of the winter or in front of a fire... I will try it again next december and let you all know. :-)"
"D: Pretty decent, but this one fails to impress me. Worth a try."
"Poured a dark brown with a beige colored head. I liked the aromas in this beer, there was a caramel, sweet raisin, and fruity aroma. This has a very strong flavor that to me was dominated at first by a sweet alcohol flavor. The caramel, brown sugar and raisin flavors show up in the middle and then there is a nice warm alcohol finish. I was surprised at how much brown sugar there was in the taste. It really went well with the raisin flavors. I had this with some apple cobbler, so that might have really brought out some of those flavors as well. Really enjoyed this one."
"ABV is hidden well for as high as it is. Let's be honest, you can't hide 10 1/2 easily and this beer does it, very well attenuated. The only thing that would make this beer better is a bittering presence. Maybe some dry hopping, but the style doesn't call for it."
"D: I really liked this beer. A very well done Quad that I'm glad I picked up. A perfect accompaniment to the snowy evening I drank it on."
"As a side note, what is up with the batch numbers???? I have no clue! I see most saying it starts off with a 6 but my bottle looks more like an S. BM me if you have any insight, please."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with some notes of peppery yeast with light dry fruit. Taste is also a mix between some candi sugar and peppery spicy yeast with some subtle notes of dry fruits. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well made but lacking the candy and dry fruits component s that characterize that style of beer."
"Pours a hazy dark brown color and a lighter copper color along the edges of the glass. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, some subdued tart malt, slight alcohol, and some fruity aromas. Fits the style of a Quadrupel. Mouth feel is very smooth and slightly chewy. There is an average carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, fruit, then sweet malt, there is noticeable alcohol throughout but not too over-powering, and finishes with some tartness. There isn't any dryness, which I really enjoyed and the higher ABV is deceptively hidden by the overall smoothness. Pretty good beer, but of the Smokestack I still pick the Double Wide IPA as the best."
"The alcohol is overwhelming while cool, but even when it warms I wish the alcohol was a bit less forward. More retention on the head would help but overall, nicely complex and enjoyable, a very nice sipping beer."
"Overall it is a pretty good beer, it will take me awhile to finish it, as it is drinking very thick. Not so sure I would buy it again, it is a little too bitter for my taste."
"Would probably improve with some age. Would have probably had a higher score if had not been preceded by the Westy 12..."
"750ml bottle $7.98. Nice red-brown, not quite transparent or opaque. The head died a swift death so there is not much to comment on there. The aroma was like a fresh cut apple, cinnamon, and pepper, nice. The flavor was a little hot with more cinnamon, alcohol and fruity flavors. This was incredibly easy to drink despite the high ABV and it was quite an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very lively carbonation."
"D-Highly drinkably. Perhaps a little bit too drinkable, considering the ABV. Extremely enjoyable, smooth and complex. Different and left me wanting more."
"I will buy this beer again for sure. Great taste but watch out. That ABV will sneak up on you."
"Wow...this is an impressive Quad. Complex, inviting caramel and Belgian malt layers balance perfectly with floral, semi-bitter hops and subtle, fruity yeast notes. I'm immediately taken aback by how well-hidden the 10.2% ABV seems to be; the only hint of booze is a warming finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, softly carbonated, medium-thick, and finishes beautifully. All in all, this is an excellent Quadrupel that lives up to the Smokestack name. Not only that, but I'd guarantee that this beer ages well. I'll be picking up some more for just that purpose soon."
"Now for a taste. This tastes similar to what Ommegang Three Philosophers would taste like if there was no lambic added and it had a bit more body. Thick and creamy on the tongue, and the alcohol heat comes out a bit to thin and dry it out. Caramelized apples, burnt walnuts, raisins, and sherry. Spice in the alcohol, but not too much heat. Looks like the fermentation temperature was kept well under control with this one, which is vital for a smooth Belgian that you don't want to have to soak in a sugary cover-up flavor. I'd say that the hops, alcohol, and malt is very well balanced to make this a big, complex, interesting quad. This would be great for after a big dinner in the winter. I would even pair it with apple or pumpkin pie. The residual sweetness lingers as it warms up keeping it very drinkable."
"Taste is alcohol, chocolate and crystal maltiness and white bread toast. I knew the moment I tasted it that further aging would be benificial. Not as much residual sugar sweetness as some other American quads I have had recently. Some raisin-like fruitiness, but not as much as I expected. It does have an actual hop presence not found in many examples of the style. Pretty good, but quads are far from my favorite style."
"Nutty aroma of almond, maybe dates also. Subdued and not overly sweet like some Belgian Quads. Malty flavors with strong estery notes from the yeast. More dried fruits and nuts, with a slowly dissipating warmth following the finish. It was sturdy, but not heavy or syrupy. Light enough to want to finish the whole bottle easily. Great choice for a winter night, with good cellar potential."
"Pours a huge creamy tan colored head, diminishing, and a dark ruby red color body. Strong dark fruity, flowery aroma, fig and a touch of alcohol. Very sweet nd floral, very Belgiany. Creamy mouthfeel, flowery taste. Lightly sweet, not sickly. Dark fruit is not as pronounced, sweet aftertaste, some hotness. Dark fruit and fig taste, apple too."
"Don't know about this one, not on my short list of favorite quads. Tons of rougher tastes that would be better with time. Some prevelant alcohol tastes which really overshadow the other sweeter tastes. Way to hot. I'm serious my mouth lit on fire. Each sips tastes like a St. Bernardus 12 with a shot and a half of cheap vodka. Maybe try and grab another and let it sit for at least three years out of fear."
"The Quadrupel ale presented a dark and slightly cloudy appearance. Almost chocolatey looking. Surprisingly, there was not much aroma with this ale. The taste was chocolatey with hints of a caramel finish. The Sixth Glass seemed very carbonated but kind of heavy with a smooth finish. This is a pretty decent ale I would definitely drink this again."
"D: I didn't make it past the first glass, so that probably speaks for itself."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle, batch number 68025. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky dark brown/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is average, not much lacing. The aroma is excellent, it smells like brown sugar, raisins, figs, cherries, Belgian yeast, rum, ginger and some pepper. The taste is slightly different than the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit, pepper, ginger, yeast, booze, cloves, and a slight tart taste I can't identify. There's also a bit of a bitter finish, which I didn't expect since the aroma was so sweet and malty. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and slick but seems a bit thin (but not watery) for the style. Carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, even with the high carbonation it's still easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good Quad, I'd pick this up again in the future."
"-Many of my friends can't stomach most of the beer I like and they all enjoyed this. That should tell you something."
"Picked up a bottle at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove. Man, this is my favorite quad that I've had in a while, and I had a Pannepot the same day. At first it smelled of spiced rum, but as it warmed sweet dates and black cherries came out with a tinge of cinnamon and ginger. Clove phenols grow, but never overpower as the beer approaches room temperature. Very drinkable and rich in flavor. Something a bit different from your normal caramel-malt driven quad. I'd call this must-try for quad-lovers."
"D - a nice sipper, especially as a weekend nightcap."
"D - This aspect of the ratings always puzzles me, of course you don't want to guzzle something like this for a session, but on the balance its a very easy drink given its abv."
"This is a less heavy version of a quad but that lends to very high drinkability for the style and I made it through the bottle much easier than I should for a beer this big. Be very careful, because I wasn't..."
"Nice, deep orange color with a huge fluffy white head that goes on and on. Moderate spicy/sulfury aroma. Very earthy. Great big boozy, Belgian taste to it. Traces of caramel and spices. Really has a nice sweet, sugary taste. Yeasty flavors with a minimum of spice. Dried fruit? Lingering bite. Good mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer for sure. Only my 2nd try at Boulevard Brewing but a very solid effort."
"D - Sits heavy on the palette. The carbonation is making this beer very filling. The alcohol is probably the factor that reduces the drinkability of this beer the most - you have to be very careful with it."
"Despite it's 10.5% ABV, this is pretty darn drinkable. Just don't drink too many, too quick, as they will hammer you."
"If you're in the Midwest and see a 750 style bottle of this for reasonable prices (7-9 dollars), don't hesitate for a second if you're in the mood for a dark Belgian style ale."
"Very well done, impressive take on the style from N. American brewery. Goes down easily as good quads do when I drink them. Size of this beast is cause for restraint. Still, this is one to sip, savor and share."
"Notes from 12/17/07"
"Keep up the great work with the Smokestack beers, I love them!"
"Pretty good stuff. Looking forward to trying the other Smokestack beers from Boulevard."
"D- Quite delicious. Turned a friend of mine into a Belgian lover, he originally would only drink IPAs. Though this beer is quite high on alcohol so it's not a force to be reckoned with."
"d: This one caught me off guard. Thanks to mhewes for one of the best American Quads I've tried. Boulevard absolutely nailed this one."
"These are for real."
"Body is heavy and sticky. Very enjoyable but in moderation. It takes its toll quickly."
"From what I have had this follows the style closely. I just don't think I am a big fan of the style. Interesting, and I am not having any problems finishing the bottle. For those that like Quads, this is one of the best American versions I have had."
"drinkability: good"
"Pours dark copper with a thick tan head. Brown sugar, yeast, dark candied fruits, and malt in the nose. Boozy glaze over all the flavors. Raisins, dates, molasses, vanilla, and caramel blend with the spice to form a heavy Belgian ale. This would do well as a winter brew."
"Nice, but a bit too sweet to go the whole bottle; you need help."
"D - Wish it was less boozy but enjoyable otherwise but rather grab other quads in the end"
"Pours brown with red tones. Tan head. Nose is perfume and dough. Flavor profile brings lots of caramel, a full plate of spices, a good amount of dough. Just a slight touch of alcohol there, but it's really balanced. Feel is smooth on all aspects. This is really nice to drink. Good complexities and a good American interpretation."
"This is my first experience with Boulevard and it's been very impressive. The Sixth Glass can easily compete with some of the top Quads out there. Given that it's brewed here in America only makes it that much more impressive. I can't really identify any material flaws here. This is a very good beer that's worth seeking out."
"D - Drinkability is good - approaching very good. The 10.5% is pretty easy to get through. Still, one bottle is enough. Starts to get boozy about half way through but not completely in a bad way. Nice complexity and very smooth. This is my first experience with the Smokestack Series and it is a good one. Easily recommended as this is a nice example of the Quadrupel style."
"Overall- Easily my favorite offering from Boulevard. A great take on the Belgian style, and, in my opinion, on par with the Chimay, though not quite on the sublime level of goodness that Westvleteren and Rochefort have achieved. Looking forward to the Bourbon-Barrel edition."
"A quality brew. Would work well with a thick sauced meat dish. A great brew in style from the states. Makes me look forward to finding others from the brewer."
"Overall, a wonderful quad. Not only did I get to try a local beer from Missouri, but I got to try my first quad made in the U.S. This is not only worthy of a try, but it should be compared with Rochefort, Pannetpot, etc. The only negative is that it just seems to be missing that ""it"" factor that the other European quads have. I can't explain it, but still an awesome beer."
"D: A very good quad. I can not find any faults really. One I will be going back to many times I am sure."
"Taste is very mellow and sweet malts with a slight bitterness then the alcohol warms the throat and BAM< you have a very drinkable beer from Boulevard Brewing. I think the Tripel and this Quad are the best of the series. REally a great tasting drink that goes down suprisingly goes down easy even with the high abv."
"Massively carbonated as four fingers of honey comb tan head reaches the top of the glass and fades crackling to a half an inch in minutes. Body is a deep burgundy brownish amber, very beautiful. Nose is zesty and spice filled with tones of fresh cut wood, vanilla, pepper, soap and carmel. Enters the mouth with a pillow like soft creamy feel that rides a zesty carpet of even spicyness. Vanilla is big and sweet up front on the palate. Spice feel is a bit peppery but really very smooth. Toasty phelonic feel is so soft and consistant. Mouthfeel thickens on the back of the tongue as you continue to drink. This is a hugely drinkable beer at 10.5% alchol, which is superbly well hidden. This is a sleeper of a brew."
"The quaff is not that impressive, a semi-boozy blast of a cloying cherry syrup. No Belgian yeast, just an over carbonated brew that doesn't drink that well. A mediocre stab at the Belgian dark ale, I won't be after any more of this one."
"D - Would tire easily, but a nice one to try."
"Did I mention the sweetness? I could sip this all night. First class brew, & now I'm eager to try the other three from the Smokestack series. Excellent!"
"A good beer. Reminds me of the Long Strange but a spicer and not as sweet. A little goes a long way."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber color. The head is a massive, billowy three inches, and recedes very slowly into a thick cap that lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of anise, dates, prunes, and figs. The taste leans more towards the dates, figs, and prunes than it does toward the anise. The is also a sharp alcohol burn in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very good quadrupel. In fact, I can't think of a better American made example."
"This is a good attempt by a Midwestern brewer at the Quad style. I think this beer would be even better if it were shelved properly."
"Probably the best non-Belgian quad I have had, I thik they nailed the style here. I am quite impressed and hoping to try more from this KC brewery."
"750ml corked & caged, out of the fridge long enough to sweat a bit. My mouth is watering. It's cloudy copper brown with an active light tan head that starts very frothy & then settles into a thin creamy layer. The smell is cinnamon, raisins, sugar, with an appealing peachy flowery smell. It has a nice underlying chalky note. Taste is wonderful. It is peppery at first, with a nice biscuity malt, and then melts to a rich caramel. Maybe a touch one-dimensional on the finish but that one dimension is delicious. Maybe a bit too sweet in the aftertaste, but that's a nit to pick another day. The mouthfeel is chewy & a touch sticky, with nice carbonation throughout. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol just a pleasant warmth down the gullet. I'd definitely buy it again & its a welcome good example of the style from a US brewer. Evidence that not EVERY beer brewed in the US is brewed for hopheads. Not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Poured into a Westmalle chalice a hazy brunt orange/light brown color with two fingers worth of foam that recedes semi-slowly, leaving behind some decent lacing. Candi sugar, yeast, candied fruit, and hints of caramel in the nose. Taste is fairly sweet in the front, flavor of cherry cordials, burnt sugar, some fruitiness, maybe some orange flavors that creep up and then disappear, some caramel, slightest hints of chocolate, some green hop character in the background, slightly spicy and peppery. Very complex, and that's definitely a good thing. Nice, creamy mouthfeel, but enough carbonation zip on the tongue that makes this one bright and extremely drinkable for the high ABV. Alcohol warming can be felt, but its fairly well hidden for the amount. A fantastic Belgian Style Quad. I've been impressed with the Smokestack series so far, and out of the three I've tried, this one has to be my favorite. Looking forward to the Bourbon Barrel Quad w/ cherries to come out."
"Kudos to Boulevard."
"this is the 2nd out of this smokestack series from boulevard, and holy tap-dancing christ, they must of kidnapped half of the brewers in belgium and forced them to make beer in KC. Out of the bomber, pours a very dark red amber colored brew with a nice ivory color, smell is fantastic, a very spicy aroma hits you first,the alcohol is noticeable in the nose, but overall its a yeasty, spicy aroma. taste is awesome, a full spicy, flavorful journey of a beer. well worth the 8 bucks for the bottle, it is comparable to alot of your true belgians which cost far more for far less beer. so its a good value. just an awesome beer, one of the best belgians i've had, as well as one of the best domestic beers."
"I would love to get my hands on a few of these to cellar. This seems like one that will be absolutly great with a bit of age on it."
"Big body, big ABV...tastes like a fine Belgian Quad, great quality brew."
"D - Bad ass beer but it is very strong tasting and with its high abv it isn't too suitable for a high volume in one sitting."
"D. somewhat."
"Drinkability was pretty high for this one. Would have it again."
"A very nice job by Boulevard."
"A surprisingly good Belgian style quad. Flavor is full, rich and fruity. Recommended."
"Poured into my Westy glass a very nice cloudy brown color, very nice carbonation (HUGE POP), very nice one-finger creamy tan head, with alot of nice creamy/sticky lacing and some small islands. The nose is malty, with some yeast tones, figs, plums, raisins. The taste is sweet, malty, with some yeast, nice touch of dark fruit. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it. Thanks Tim and James. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are decent, but the alcohol is very and apparent as well as the mouth being overly carbonated. I was really hoping for something great out of this one, but I""m slightly disappointed. Perhaps the Tripel and Saison will be better?"
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"Very good brew from Boulevard. A tad high ABV which hurts drinkability but nothing a couple buddies can't cure. Possibly the best that Boulevard has to offer and that's no small claim. Thank you Boulevard for making me proud to enjoy a local product."
"Pours a reddish brown until back lit when is glows with a bright rich looking orangish amber with some haziness. This Quad looks so inviting that this mammoth head is hard to wait on,but it actually deflates in a timely manor leaving huge webs of lacing covering the entire Duval snifter it's served in. Smells like straight up maple syrup,dark fruits and alcohol. This is delicious,Quads are not at the top of my favorites list,but this one is winning me over! Tastes are dark fermented fruits(raisins) and alcohol with subtle yeasty character,syrup and honey sweetness finish off this boozy beast. Full bodied and warming to the tongue encourages sipping,not to mention a ABV that I would have guessed to be even higher than 10.5. This one is an stunner from start to finish,pure darkness at its best."
"D - This is an outstanding beer from a brewer that I've grown to love. Boulevard is making some good stuff these days, and this is just about the cream of the crop."
"D: I love quads and this is a quad to love. It fits well in the Belgium tradition. It is a bit much for a session beer but a wonderful sipper and great night cap."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. I wish I had brought three or four bottles of this back instead of one. DAMN YOU TSA and your liquid restrictions. Damn you US Air and your $15+ per checked bag! Damn you liquid and glass for weighing so much!"
"D: Pretty damn good and easy drinking. Great flavor, great aftertaste and even though the ABV is on the higher end it's almost barely noticeable...but will limit how much you can drink."
"By sixth glass I've had my fill and the alcohol is getting the better of me (granted, the sixth glass is a small one). Still, I'll make sure not to follow any well-dressed men home."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice ""lighter"" tasting quad. Doesn't have that thick feel and strong flavors that I usually taste in the style. But this is a nice beer, that is surprisingly easy to sip."
"definitely a sipper but I could enjoy this all night long"
"Score one for Boulevard Brewing Co. I've always been a fan, but they've outdone themselves this time."
"Now it's time to head back to the store and buy the IPA."
"Although this seemed at times a strong dubbel, I'm again impressed that Boulevard has so successfully understood and conceived their Belgian ales true to style. This came on a little spicy and a little strong, making it a good candidate for aging, and definitely a beer that would pair wonderfully with a number of traditional Belgian dishes (Flemish stew, perhaps?)"
"drinkability is good. the carbonation helps lighten things up a little, but also carries just a touch of sting. not quite balanced, but i still like it."
"Pours a cloudy amber orange, pretty vibrant colour, medium sized off white head forms, retains a pretty solid layer, good retention, a bit of lace when I swirl it, looks good. Smell is sweet and sugary, apples and pear, lots of fruit, cherry, biscuits, alcohol, caramel/honey sweetness, yeast, nice. Taste is neat, caramel, nuts, very bready, sweet grainy beginning, yeast, some iron, honey, butter, earth, bit of spicy bitterness, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, alcohol is pretty well hidden. An interesting take on the quad, don't totally get it but definitely a drinkable beer. Thanks Russ!"
"D-Not something i would want all the time but very good and i'll but it again, would like to see how it ages"
"I probably trade for a few more of these while they are still available. Big props to Tim and Jimi.. Jimi is a fantastic trader, and Tim punched me square in the tongue with this one."
"D: at 10.5% abv, I elt the weight of this big brew but surprizingly drinkable. Better paired with food. I had chocolate with it. Savored slowly, it's an incredible beer."
"Wow, a surprisingly solid and well mannered Quad that looked, smelled, felt, and tasted like something right out of the Belgian realm from which it is to emulate. Great job by Boulevard on this one!"
"D - Bring it on."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 2"" beige head above the cloudy orangey amber brew. Thick head lasts and lasts, with spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet, but overpowered by strong rubbing alcohol-ish character. Taste is also sweet to start, edging towards alcohol by the close, and plenty of warming action. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. The rubbing alcohol nose does last, however, and puts a damper on things."
"Kudos to Boulevard for brewing this. Glad to have tried & would gladly have again."
"Perfect appearence. Deep ruby color with a full, long lasting head of a light tan. Fairly nice nose, with a lot of Belgian character. Plentiful dark fruits (cherries, dates, plums,) and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is loaded with tons of depth. Deep caramel and honey glaze, with dark fruits. It's a really nice beer and very Belgian. I think this series from Boulevard shows their brewing skill."
"The first of the Boulevard Belgians that I haven't cared for."
"Tastes peppery, chocolate, clean alcohol sting, mild toffee. Cherry and streched thin raisiny. Mild belgiany phenolic character persists as an undertone. Strong carbonation with noticable alcohol to wipe most of the sweet of the palate. Leaves a dry residual chocolate in the aftertaste. Good drinkability now, I'll bet this one ages to become fantastic."
"Thanks!!"
"Pours a dark amber brown with a huge tan head. Smells of alcohol and oak and a strong presence of sour cherries. Tastes of cinnamon, brown sugar, and a slight amount of earthyness. Not as dry as other Quad's but quite good. Mouthfeel is rich, with massive carbonation. Drinkability is quite good, especially for over 10 percent alcohol. An excellent American Quadrupel."
"The drink ability is surprisingly good given the alcohol content, but the strong sweet flavors kept me from having more than two glasses at one setting."
"I find quad's to be a widely varying style but one I am drawn back to quite often. So, that said how's the boulevard offering? I found it ""quad subdued"". What the heck does that mean? It's got sweet caramel candied fruit malt aspects, a solid belgian yeast aspect, the right color and a sticky lacing head. It's also boozy and the flavors while blended well are more subdued than I would prefer in my quad. Worth a try."
"This is the last of the Smokestack Series for me, and I can't imagine I would be any less impressed with this one than the previous three, but I better make sure. Pours a dark copper with some almost indiscernible streaks of red into a snifter. Has a huge foamy tan head that recedes in a dilatory fashion leaving little lacing behind. Has a robust and complex smell of raisins, figs and other dark fruits with some alcohol right behind mixed in with some big malts, caramel and toffee. Tastes is just as complex as the smell with some big malty creaminess, light chocolates, caramel, sweet bread, some grains, dark fruits, hops and some big alcohol heat bringing up the rear. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and smooth, but the big alcohol heat might be a turn off for some, although is welcomed to me. There is plenty of brisk carbonation to keep things exciting. All I can say is hell yeah!"
"Dark burgady ruby red blend. Big airy beige head is erected with the pour. It fizzles out fairly quickly, but a nice little frothy head has some staying power at the end. Decent nose, but overall, too sweet smelling. Blackberry Brandy comes to mind as does cherry juice and sweet rock candy. I think this is appropriate to an extent, but my nose tells me it's a little overdone. Let's proceed. First impressions on the palate are spicy, sweet, yeasty and alcoholic. This is not a bad take here on an extraordinary style. Brandy soaked figs with some plum and raisin. A little of that ""spiked punch"" feel to it. The alcohol is all over this, but never really off putting. Rum soaked fruits make their presence, like apple and melon. Light-medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. My only recommendation here is maybe a little less heat and a little less sweet. Overall though, this is a good beer."
"D - This is a very good Quad. I was really impressed with Boulevard's take on a big Belgian style."
"Pours a murky brown color with some reddish hues. Big cream colored head with great retention and lots of lacing left behind. Aroma is alcohol, dark fruits, and spice. Taste is a bit boozy. Some funky yeast. Pretty spicy. A bit fruity with some pears and raisins. Mouthfeel is very thin in my opinion for a quad and it doesnt lend to the drinkability because of the high and noticeable alcohol. Not bad but certainly doesnt stack up to the trappists i've had."
"Drinkability: A decent quad and pleasure to have tried it, but one is enough for me, thanks."
"Pours dark red and orange with a strong 1/4 inch head. Average lacing. Nicely carbonated with a super sweet Belgium hoppy flowery citrus smell. The light hops balance well with the malts and Belgium yeast. It finishes with a lovely sweetness with just a hint bitterness. This is not a disappointment. Recommended!"
"750ml bottle: Batch 68018: This one opened with a loud ""pop"". It poured with a large tan head on it, and was quite fizzy. The color was a hazy mahogany. The head dropped off rather quickly. The nose is good, but not as strong as I would have expected. Mainly bready and spicy, with traces of caramel and fruits. A bit of effervescence on the tongue. Not quite full bodied. It took a couple of sips to appreciate the taste. Subtle hints of different tastes, but they all blend well together. Nice."
"Pours a deep ruby red/brown color. Smells of rich malty sweetness(apricots, prunes) some yeast and bread, subtle hop kick. Coarse head is intimidating but settles to a decent layer quickly and fed by very good carbonation. Tastes is somewhat complex. Lots of carbonation in there and in the finish. Tingles the tongue in the beginning. Transitions to a subdued malty sweetness. Finishes strong with a meddly of hops, carbonation, and alcohol that seems to go on forever. Nice body to it but seems to soften as it opens/warms up."
"This quadrupel is not overwhelming in its flavor. For people looking for a big, brash quadrupel, this might disappoint. Yet for those looking for a good, well-crafted, well-flavored, smooth Quad, this should satisfy. At $8 for the 22 oz. bottle it's a little pricey, but certainly enjoyable enough--and a bit boozy enough--to ultimately overlook (or plainly forget) the price in favor of the flavor. Definitely recommended."
"D: Not too bad, along the lines of La Trappe Quad if I remember correctly."
"Atlanta Ale meeting. This one is funky, with apple juice as the predominent taste, and cloves, toasted caramel, candy brown sugar, fruit, above average mouthfeel. Lacing. High alcohol is there.Looks like a quad,Drinkable but not my go-to quad. Is this bottle right?"
"And outstanding quad. Glad I got the opportunity to try it."
"If Boulevard is going to move in this direction, then The Smokestack series is a great start. The regular line of Boulevard brews is nothing to be ashamed of, but these SmokeStack beers seem to be pretty special"
"Several stretches short of greatness, but an enjoyable glass or two, or six..."
"Drank pretty good, probably needs to age a couple of years to smooth out some of the boozeyness. Went well with my Christmas dinner (goose)"
"As others have stated, I'm very happy to see Boulevard going in this direction. I've suggested the Smokestack series to many of my local friends who haven't tried a whole lot of exotic beers, and the Sixth Glass seems to be one of the favorites among them. Highly recommended."
"Overall, its an enjoyable beer that has me excited to see what Boulevard does with this new series."
"Notes: Gotta love my local brewery branching out a bit with their expanded capacity. This is probably one of the finest quads I've had here in the States."
"That's being pretty picky though. This is a great beer that I'll buy again."
"Mr. Pauwels, you are awesome!"
"Overall, I was impressed. I haven't had too many American quads that I've enjoyed. This is one that I did enjoy though. And it's not too expensive either - I paid $7.50 for the bottle at Red X in Kansas City. Stack this up next to a Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus Abt 12 and it comes up a bit short, but it's nothing to sneeze at either. Grab a bottle if you see it."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a Chimay chalice. Cellar temp. Bottle conditioned. Loads of carbonation. Two fingers of fine bubble light tan head. Hazy amber. Bubble gum in the aroma with burnt sugar, fruit, and a little alcohol. Full bodied, lots of raisiny fruit. A little spice in the middle. Very warming. Some alcohol in the finish. Very drinkable for the alcohol level."
"Mouthfeel is very warm, yet dry. The alcohol does make itself known, but is not overpowering. Very well balanced and drinkable. I am so excited that Boulevard is expanding in this direction."
