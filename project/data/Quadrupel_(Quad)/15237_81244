4.25,1.2,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty brown color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry fruits with some bourbon notes and some residual sugars is quite complex. Taste is a complex mix of bourbon with light residual candi sugar with some, fruity ester and some dry fruits notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nice level of complexity thought a fuller body would have help appreciate this even more.","Phyl21ca","Oct 17, 2014"

4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"2009 edition - poured a muddy red-brown body (like dark brown leather couch brown) with two finger head that dies quick with little lace. There is some booze and vanilla in this beer and it a touch of sourness to along with some sweet malts - pretty complex aroma that I can't really nail down. Beer is medium-bodied, a little sticky, the booze is hidden but after awhile hits you as beer warms, some typical Belgian yeast and citric zip come in as well and there is some moderate sweetness with a blend of sour that I get. A really enjoyable quad that the aging has smoothed out and sweetned and is a great sipper (this is not meant to be more than a sipper).","clayrock81","Feb 16, 2014"

4.63,10.2,4,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Picked this up at Bierhandel Willems en zoon in Belgium. Beautiful clear mahogany pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is amazing with huge vanilla, bourbon, and oak notes along with hints of butterscotch, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, and subtle dark fruit. The taste mirrors the nose with the oak, vanilla, and bourbon once again the stars. Hints of maple, caramel, pecans, leather, tangerine, figs, apple,brown sugar, and booze. The mouthfeel is lightly syrupy with perfect carbonation and a smooth as silk, subtly warming finish. Overall, this is an amazing beer! It's rich and flavorful and hugely drinkable for an 11% ABV beer. I've had this numerous times on tap, but this is the first time from the bottle. I have to say it's just as good, and perhaps has mellowed a bit in the cellar. For me, this is a Barley Wine disguised as a Quad. Highly recommended!","beerdrifter","Dec 26, 2013"

The flavors are gorgeously balanced and the alcohol is not so overpowering that it is difficult to drink. The guys at De Struise have really created something marvelous here.
