"Got this on tap at Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, PA, when I dropped my kid off at college.  Whoda thunk?  I was pretty amazed at the flavor, dried fruit like raisins and prune, good malt and very yeasty but very little hops.  Very high alcohol percentage but it doesn't show up so much in the flavor, more a warmth as it goes down your throat.  It pours a light brown, lighter than the Gulden Draak dark triple.  Carbonation is good, not too much, small bubbles like a good champagne and it has a very rich mouth feel.  I like it better than the dark triple; possibly the best beer I've ever tasted.  I wonder if it would be as good in bottles and I wish I could find it in stores.  The dark triple is now available in Wegman's but not not the 9000."

"Ligher in color than most quads.  Really nice yeasty spice on the nose.  Taste is great and balanced.  Warming finish.  Very creamy full bodied feel.  A really nice quad. Nothing wrong here.  Glad its easy to find this one."
""

""

"You'd think Gulden Draak had been making this quad for ages instead of just 3 years or so. Poured a one finger white head over an amber body into a 25 cl La Trappe chalice from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle. Light, musty fruit smell. Tastes of toffee and tobacco, with a subtle fruit sweetness, and a unique ginger ale type undercurrent. Absolutely spectacular effervescent, mouth-puffing mouthfeel, a leader in the style, right up there with St. B abt 12. Gulden Draak may be late to the quad party, but they nailed it."

"O: Basically this was brandy thinned out with water, a really heavy sipping beer, the booze took away attention from anything else, slightly disappointing offering from one of my favorite breweries, I hope age can mellow this beer."

"Dried cherries and cranberry. Fizzy carbonation. Alcohol at the end is slightly medicinal"

"Overall - A flavorful Belgian Quad/dessert beer. Have had this both aged and fresh and like it equally both ways. Not your everyday Belgian quad in appearance or flavor. Has some flavor similarities to more traditional quads like St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Trappist Rochefort 10 but has an interesting and welcome twist on the style. Not my favorite quad but still very drinkable."
""
""
"Poured from 750, internet suggests bottling code indicates 11/13 bottling. Red tinted orange, slightly hazy, two fingers of soapy off white head, a few rings of lace on the glass. Smell: date bread, cherry note, floral, sweet apple note. Taste: raisin bread, moderately boozy, peppery, pear, cherry. Syrupy start into fluffy carbonation, but thinning and drying quickly into strong peppery and grape skin finish. Disappointing that a beer this big doesn't have more depth of flavor and heft."
"Total perfection.. plain & simple. That's all I have to say."
"Apart from the Tripel Karmeliet, this is absolutely the best beer I have ever tried. Though I'm a bit of a newb on the craft beer scene."
""
""
""
"I really love this belgium beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy golden-amber colour, with a normal head that leaves some lace and a ring. Smell is very alcoholic, with dark fruits, ripened fruits, vanilla and spices. Medium body, creamy and sticky palate. Taste is the same as smell: alcohol notices a lot, dark fruits, spices... Really good."

"Definitely a bit better than the Piraat, but to me more of a beer to have near the end of the night, not because of its strength, but its feel.  If not the final beer of the night, have it as a gateway to a nice smooth stout."

"Beer is good. Much better from the tap. Need to air it out, if drinking from the bottle."

"Outstanding example of the Belgian quad. Hazey bronze with loads of effervescent carbonation. Sweet and mild yet packing a strong punch. Delicious, will certainly buy again."
""
"Different from the archetype of the traditional Belgian Quad, this baby pours a peachy amber and burnt orange with a fair amount of bubbles creeping to the surface. Not brilliant but definitely not opaque. A nice cream lacing after each sip. On the nose, lots of fruits: pear, peach, tangerine as well as other citrus in addition to the exceptional yeasty breadiness as well as some carmelly toffee. Taste is excellent. Think triple hefeweizen (as pertaining to the triple IPA usage) if that style existed. The belgian yeast is at the forefront here dominating the palate. Pretty much mirrors the aroma with the addition of banana, clove, raison, dates, plum, jelly and fig but the aftertaste has a slight fruity sourness to it which is delightful. Atypical for the style but an astonishing beer nonetheless. If you like Gulden Draak this is definitely worthy. If you don't like Gulden Draak then you must not like Belgian beers and are henceforth unworthy."

"Cheers"
"Heavy, stubby 11.2oz bottle served in a chalice glass.  Beer pours surprisingly pale in color, but appears golden red in the glass.  Crystal clear, too.  Aroma is rich, of peaches, or stone fruit.  Flavor is comparatively mild/neutral.  Yeasty and fizzy.  It just doesn't have the depth of flavor I want in a quad.  What it does have, however, is impeccable balance, and the perfect disguise for its massive ethanol payload.  I must disagree on this point with my fellow reviewers, apparently. Very drinkable, just not all that interesting.  But apparently I had the same complaint about St. Stefanus when I reviewed that.  I really must pick up and review the standard Gulden Draak (Tripel) as well as Piraat, which I remember quite liking.  There's just no excuse for a beer this heady and drinkable to be so middling in a category like Belgian Quad."

"Body is medium, effervescence is quite sharp up front but fades reasonably fast though it retains a kind of tanginess to it. Warming from the get-go. Slightly drying. Damned good."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (syle 18E). Bottle 33 cl - Batch unknown. AROMA: moderate low malt background with some peppery and caramel notes. no hop aromas. alcohol presence. APPEARANCE: deep amber or coppery color and a bit hazy. average ivory head with good retention. TASTE: very sweet malty flavours with some caramel notes. alcohols on the spicy side. low bitterness rendering the beer unbalanced. finishes sweet. PALATE: medium body with average carbonation. OVERALL: unbalanced and lacking aromas and flavours. could be better."

"As a big fan of Gulden Draak, I was excited when my local Belgian import focused bar got the 9000 in. I was a little disappointed, to be honest, as I very much enjoy the Tripel, but that said, the 9000 was still an outstanding beer. Very fruity and earthy, fans of Gulden Draak will encounter that same almost-pungent flavor that distinguishes its cousin from other tripels, but the 9000 does very little to improve on the experience, while upping the price tag slightly. I'd recommend sticking with the tripel."

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation that is quite a bit overdone. It id a warming beer overall and I get the feeling that my bottle might be off due to the plastic hint and over carbonation. I was sadly let down by this beer and probably would not revisit it again."

"Great malty tone to this with a distinct and consistent sweet edge. Way too easy to drink. Strikes me much more as a strong amber ale, but who cares. It's a nice hearty ale that carries mellow, yet pointed, sweet tones. Like I said, way too easy to drink. A great beer."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 11/19/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pear, apple, plum, golden raisin, apricot, white grape, light banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big pear, apple, golden raisin, plum, apricot, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, golden raisin, plum, apricot, white grape, light banana, pepper, clove, candi sugar, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and pale malt sweetness; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/prickly moutfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome pale Quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"I don’t know why I was expecting an even more powerful version of Gulden Draak (I guess the label), but I got a bit less complex and intense beer that is rather smooth, which in a second thought, it is a quality on its own, it is extremely drinkable at 10.5% abv. Anyway, it is a definitely a good beer and kept getting better as it approached room temperature."
""
""
""
""
"Similar to the white bottle Gulden Draak. Amber with a nice chunky head. Very nice bouquet. Smells like brown sugar, caramel, toffee, some chocolate. Low to medium carbonation. Fruity in front. Bitter in the middle. Strong finish. Very complex and flavorful. A very detailed brew."

"A delicious refreshing and complex quad, and surprising to have all those rolled into one beer. Not an overly heavy beer, it doesn't compromise on flavour and complexity once it gets going, an assertive yeasty and earthy character backing some spice and plummy jammy dark berries. Tied together very nicely with enough sweetness and crispness to make it drink really nicely. Recommended, though I still prefer roch and st b. This just seems to be too light on the fruits/spice, too mellowed, but still a pleasant quad."
"It's not the sweet, dark fruit heavy, plenty of depth quad that I've had many times before. It's lighter on its feet and straight shooting. As in your face as the alcohol is, it's surprisingly drinkable and I attribute that almost solely to its finish. I prefer their BSDA but I enjoyed this more and more as time went on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fairly typical Belgium quad; by that I mean good. It is sweet and complex, more of a dessert ale than a breakfast substitute."
"Overall I thought it was very drinkable especially with the higher ABV. It is definitely something I will come back to sometime."
"I'm glad I aged this for as long as I did, I as I feel I cut down the sweetness and heat over time, and therefore, increased its enjoyability. It's definitely not the greatest quad I've ever had, and my interest for this brewery has most certainly gone under in recent times, but it's a good one for beginners of the style and definitely has its place in the sea of quads worldwide."
"Gulden Draak 9000 is, in my opinion, no better than the original. It is almost as good though - which means it's a pretty great offering. Brouwerij Van Steenberge may not be the best brewery in Belgium but most of their stuff - this included - is certainly worth picking up, if only once."
"The sweetness kicks in right off in the taste with the apple, pear, and malts taking center stage. Then there is is this vibrant bitterness the ends dryly. Alcohol is well integrated. I was in the mood for a Quad today and I found this one top be delightful through and through."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is amber hued and pretty clear and with minimal head. Aromas of alcohol, Belgian yeast, sweet, fruity esters. An aggressive beer, with a present sweetness and a touch of spice. Alcohol heat is a tad forceful. That said, there are some nice flavors happening here. the body is lighter than I would have expected. This was decent."
""
"O- Great beer, makes you sleepy if you get it at lunch. It'd be a great last beer."
""
""
""
""
"Hazed deep orange colour, one finger of white head with some lace. Smell is fairly yeasty, spice and dark fruit, lots of plum and raisin, some pepper as well as some over ripe banana. Taste follows the nose, yeasty, plum and dark fruits, raisin is more pronounced as it warms, light sweetness, a bit of alcohol, burnt dark sugar and fruit in the finish. Medium carbonation, creamy full body, nice weight and mouthfeel. Quite good, I enjoyed this more than I expected, would certainly revisit."
""
""
""

"Overall: I think this is a very underrated quad. It is firm in my rotation and that is a great accomplishment...my favorite beer from the brewer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: delicately sweet -- a balance between relaxed fruit and taught dryness that brewers of this style frequently seem to miss. a very impressive beer that I'm going to be on the look out for in the future."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"An outstanding quad. Very easy drinking and delicious. Some other quads might be more complex but none will be more delicious."

""
"This is a great intro to quads. If you like the Gulden Draak tripel, this is a real treat. I encourage all new beligians to try this early because of its accessibility and quality. The only thing that I'd say is a distant drawback is the consistency from bottle to bottle. There've been a few misses, and by that I mean they were 4/5."
""
"O: Due to the alcohol abundance in this brew it leaves you ready for a night of sleep. This is a pleasant nightcap brew. I am giving this review as someone who does not care for Quads, but this brew was pretty pleasant."
""
""
""
"A really manly beer, clearly a quad. A sipper, full of alcohol. Yet it provides complex flavors and feel. Aggressive, but never crossing the line. Another good beer from Van Steenberge."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a pretty fine beer, well crafted and packing a punch you don't expect. The smoothness on the palate is excellent, and the approachability overall is genuinely surprising. For a beer weighing in at ten-and-a-half percent ABV, this is ridiculously drinkable."
""
"Overall, 98/100. Try it, you will not be disappointed."

""

""
""
"O: I personally prefer the regular Gulden Draak, but I'd recommend this to anyone who likes tripels. I liked it."
"Overall – A rather tasty Belgian Quad/ Strong ale. Big sweet flavors with a decent booze and still quite drinkable and very enjoyable. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: while this may not be in the league of St Bernardus or Rochefort 10 it is a nice quad. I think it is a good easy drinking quad that is not overly pretentious. I'm glad I picked a few up and I will be interested to see how these change over time."
"Overall – I was expecting a little more sugary fruity sweetness based on the regular draak. Still a good beer but not in the same tier as the famous quads like bernardus, trappe, rochefort etc. There is just nothing really exciting about it."
""
"O/D - This is obviously far too young for a Quad. Mild, muted, etc. I can see the potential in it though. Gonna have to revisit it later."
""
"O: Great beer. Sweet and warm."

"The finish is fruity and sweet, and very pleasant overall."
""
"Overall: Like I said a perfect dessert beer due to its sweetness and creaminess. I certainly enjoyed this quadruple and will be buying it again. You wouldn't know it because of the sweetness but the abv is 10.7 which makes it enjoyable because one is all that is necessary."
"A rather unique quad obviously, companion to this brewery's ""dark tripel"". Looks, smells, and tastes distinctive, as one would expect. I let mine hang out in the cellar for around 8 months or so before finally getting down to brass tacks this afternoon. Poured into a goblet, this brew is a dark honey amber color rather than brown, with around four inches of light-colored head that disappeared quite quickly. Aroma reminds me of a saison, with nutty, spicy, funky yeast paving the way and pungent sweet honey and cooked fruit bringing up the rear. Smells quite a bit like fermented prune juice. Palate is richly sweet and spicy, with honeyed breakfast cereal, golden syrup, cooked applesauce, pumpkin, sultana raisin, prunes, clove, coriander, and dry burlap sack/horse blanket all blending together. Unique combination of flavors yet still a quintessentially Belgian ""malt bomb"". Fairly thick and syrupy body, an effect amplified by the relatively tame carbonation. Hard to taste much in the way of hops. Certainly has its own charm, even if I do prefer the more traditional dark takes on the style."
""
""
""
"O/D-Happy I didn't buy this one myself. The more I drink them, the more I realize how this big, rich, Belgian malt elixirs are not for me."
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoy that this Quad has a nice balancing bitterness to it. We're not talking IPA bitterness here, but it cuts the big sweetness just enough, and lends to a fabulously complex brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am very glad that I put this bottle away for a while - I think if it had been fresh there would have been a little too much alcohol. I am going to have to by a few more bottles to stick in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn tasty, very similar to the standard Gulden Draak. If you haven't tried one or the either, definitely seek them out."
"O- A great Belgian Quad, will definitely seek out again. And relatively inexpensive, picked up a bottle at 4 bucks."

"A wonderful beer. Saved this one since last Xmas and it held up wonderfully. Would def try and drink again."
""
""
"O: This is highly regarded and I see why. Would seek out if in the mood for a big quad with these expressive and apple notes. This is not as subtle as some Quads I have had, but it brings a lot to the party."

"O: Very good beer i'll buy again, but far from the best in my opinion St-Bernardus"
""
""
""
"O: good brew, forget what i paid for it but it wasn't bad and for how good this beer that isn't a bad thing at all. It is my first quad, i am more accustomed to triples and trappist strongs (like Duvel and Chimay white). Moral of the story is I would buy it again."

"Dark Amber with a slight (one finger) head. Beautiful looking beer. Smells a bit like wine. The alcohol is very apparent in the flavor. It's not as drinkable as I would've hoped. The flavor's not awful though. It tastes smooth at first but the taste is quickly replaced by a bitter boozy aftertaste. Overall, it's decent. But a little too boozy for my taste."
""
""
"Served at Hunger & Thirst in Lancaster. Initially, there was very little aroma with this beer but the look in the glass was formidable. A pretty head capped an opaque deep golden goblet and it too a while before the nose developed. The great flavor was evident from the get go and all the way through. Complex and well balanced, one of the better beers I've had in a while."
""
""
"A fine quad to enjoy as if every sip was fine champagne. Nice to have enjoyed this fall Sunday watching football. Not feeling very wordy today as this quad deserves more. Plain and simple; this is delicious."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this and I am not always the hugest fan of all Quads (it really depends on how cloyingly sweet the Quad is, I prefer the ones that are a little less sweet). There is enough complexity to the flavor and aroma of this beer which makes it very easy to drink and enjoyable. Alcohol is well hidden considering the strength."
"O: This tastes a little strong, but nothing like a beer over 10% abv because it hides its alcohol very well from the taste. For this reason, it's rather drinkable."
"Overall, a decent quad but different than other ones I have had. OK but I'm not sure I will revisit this one."
""
"Poured a darkish gold, almost amber, that is seethrough (somewhat) with decent head and lace retention on top of a tropical fruit like aroma, yeast for sure, some sweet malts like candi sugar and caramel, maybe a bit of spiciness as well. Smooth, somewhat light bodied, a mix of sweetness that is sugary (I'll go with caramel and toffee) and some fruit flavors that are akin to pear, mango, sour apple for a little sour bitterness/tartness, touch of spice, all well-balanced. Odd beer for me to review in only that I know I really enjoyed it yet couldn't really pinpoint anything specific down."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, a really nicely done quad, with great malts and sweet characters, very malty, with a pretty decent attenuation, nice dark fruits, good booze esters and phenols which are good in this case, perhaps the only downfall is the over carbonation. I can only imagine what this would be like in a bourbon or rum barrel, and come to think of it I may try that, buy a bottle or two, age in a growler with some oak chips or something. very interesting!"
"I haven't had the 9000 Gulden Draak, but I have been drinking the golden dragon for years now. Appears a deep amber bronze hue with billowing off white head forms thick fine even bubbled carbonation, Belgian lacing clings to the glass this is effervescence. Aromatics offer up deep dark fruit notes with raisins and tart apples, mild slightly spicy herbal hop notes. Flavor is tart up front with the fruit punching the palate, think green raisins and tart apple slices blending into a malty mix of alcohol and herbal hops. Big bad Belgian ale at manageable costs in a mixed six pack format, super sweet finish is almost killing this for me. They came out with new beers that are bigger or the same in alcohol with really noticeable alcohol on the palate and unfermented sugars making it overtly sweet. So one dimensional it pains me to see they did this to a great complex big Belgian ale like Gulden Draak, carbonation is solid, but the finish is a mix of alcohol heat and cloying sticky sweet malts. Overall why drink this version when you can drink the classic, enough said about that."
""
"O - A damn good quad, but to be honest, the carbonation was so distracting as to affect my enjoyment of this beer. I would buy again, but I would probably seek out St Bernardus first."
""
""
""
""

"Early on (past 7 years ago or so ) in my Belgian beer loving career I was a quad aficionado. Gulden Draak was my go to beer. However, over past few years, and esp. lately (since I'm now pushing 50) I seem to have developed a low tolerance for sweet and have moved away from quads altogether. I'm definitely more of a triple fan these days. BUT - just had a a Gulden Draak 9000 and it is perfect. Superb - dry -with the essence of sweet plums and brown sugar. Phenomenal. Started out with 2 bottles - just finished one, one left, so wish I had more!"
""
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml into a tulip. Dark orange/medium amber beer with a huge number of effervescent tiny bubbles and a cream colored, dense head. Completely clear. The nose is bready, like a lightly toasted challah. Orange marmalade, toast, and toffee on the tongue, with a tad of alcoholic warming on the finish. Spritzy and medium-bodied. A bit unusual for a ""quad," in that it presents very much like a trippel, in color, nose and flavor profile. An outstanding beer."
""
"OVERALL : After cleaning up the beer that spilled on opening - even though you handled the bottle like live nitroglycerin - and waiting a full 5 minutes for the head to shrink to something less than 5/6 of your glass, you'll have an amazing time. Well worth waiting for, and well worth buying lots of it. A very well done lighter quad that can be drunk in a wide variety of occasions."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, amber-gold coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, white head that starts tall and slowly settles into a surface coating. Nose of apricot, pineapple, toffee, caramel, roast, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The different aroma characteristics come together masterfully, remaining balanced and avoiding overpowering the senses. Flavors are bold and smooth, with a solid caramel backbone supporting a warming booze character, spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice, and a fleeting highlight of bubblegum, old world fruit, and some earthy notes. Very bold, very robust, and a touch of heavy. The body is robust, but kept slightly light and effervescent through the carbonation. Rich sweetness and booze warmth in the aftertaste, with an old world fruit linger and building warmth in the finish. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: reminds me a bit of sherry (if carbonated), a bit too alcoholic. But it has some nice complexity it the taste."
"O A really good quad. Overall a tad lighter in each category than what I prefer for the style. On its own, however, a really great beer."
""
"O: Great beer. very complex with a great mingling of flavors. Not my favorite quad but one i will never say no to. The mouthfeel isn't quite as great as some of the other quads ive had. /92"

"Overall: This is a great beer, much sweeter than the Trappistes Rochefort 10. This is still a great beer although I don't think it compares to it."
"overall: This Quad honestly gives a monk a run for their money. Easily my favorite non-trappist Quad (that's including ABT 12), this is honestly a very underrated beer. I've had their Tripel and it was amazing, and this is just an all around amazing brew. I will be buying this again, in my opinion this one almost rivals the beloved Rochefort 10, AND is cheaper is by about $3.00 where I live. Pleasantly surprised once again from this sleeper Belgian brewery, will be trying all of their beers."

"D - Great Quad. Good balance, complexity, and mouthfeel."

"Sorry, but I haven't actually paired this beer to anything, however, it would more than likely be good with some smoked pork, Cotswold cheese, and black grapes"
""
""
""
"Not a bad quad by any means...but different. If you are looking for something like st bernardus or westy...this isn't it. Its a bit lighter...more like a german quad if that's possible...I'd drink again for sure."
"Cheers!"

"To be fair, this one's a doozy once the bottom of the bottle is hit and the alcohol fully kicks in. This never fully tasted like booze but this was one of the most aggressive Belgian beers that I've ever, or would expect, to have. It's to be expected for a Quadrupel and while this wasn't as good or as dark as the Trappist Quads that I've had, this held its own and was certainly worth a go once. I view it more as a strong Tripel than a Quad if only because the hue and styles of fruit were different but aside from my take on this, this was a Quad in every sense of the word and worth a go for anyone patient enough to enjoy all this had to offer."
""
"O: Great brew."
""
""
""
"While a genuinely tasty offering, the overall intricacies don't really keep up with the best in class - sure, the booze is expertly integrated, and while there's lots going on in its own right, there's just a certain je ne sais quoi lightness of being that renders me just a wee bit down about this style that I share many's affinity for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While not quite to style, this was enjoyed while reading and listening to live harp music. The moment was sublime on a gentle, quiet afternoon, while the stark exterior whiteness contrasted against the dark green Norwegian pines."
"Overall, this definitely one I will be revisiting...especially since the Brewpub is only about a block away from me."

"I like the regular version better I think. this one is punishingly boozy, with no apologies. I mean, I know its a quad and it should be big, but this is hard to drink. pours super light for its genre, orange hued bronze color, maybe even lighter, fairly clear, with a sudsy white head. the nose is all alcohol, a touch of banana and other fruits towards the end, and some candy sugar, but the alcohol is by far the most forward aroma. same is true with the taste. it finishes hot, but some banana from the yeast is left over after the alcohol burns off. hints of honey, vanilla, and black papper flash in and out, but in the end its booze and sugar. too much for me, and I am a lover of quads, but this one has glaring imbalances even for its strength. its still a very well made beer of course, but in comparison to the regular gulden draak, this is inferior in my opinion. 750mls of this could kill a small child."
""
"O - After the cork incident, I was prepared for the worst, but got a pleasant surprise. This is a wonderful Belgian pale strong ale. It's a barley wine unashamed to have all the great Belgian characteristics."
""
"Overall, rather sweet and high ABV--one glass is enough. Can't say I'd seek this out again when there are more complex and tasty Belgian quads to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 4.25: Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes. I am a big fan of the Van Steenberge brewery and this version of Draak is worth the price, IMHO. Different in several important ways from its more easily found cousin, this beer is, nonetheless, excellent and well worth tracking down. Excellent and further proof of the embarrassment of riches present at Van Steenberge brewery."
""
""
""
""
"More a BSPA than quad, this is a golden copper with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and moderate lacing. The nose is a blend of yeast, spice (clove, fennel), golden raisins, ripe white grapes, honey and caramel. Too sweet for my liking, this beer opens with a blend of honey, caramel, toffee and spice. There's bubblegum (not my favorite flavor) as well. Spicy and sweet with some yeast on the finish, this beer is medium-full in body and highly carbonated. Decent, i much prefer the regular version of this beer."
""
""
"Pretty damn good."
"Flavorful, tasty quad, good balance, contains its strength better than you would expect, all around fantastic."
""
""
""

"Overall a very good quad. I'd like to know specifically what's different between this and the standard Gulden Draak but both are enjoyable."

"O - not what I expected in a quad. Used to Bernardus as the measuring bar. falls well short."

"Price Point - $6.49/11.2oz bottle"

"Very tasty quad, although I think I may prefer the regular Gulden Draak to this one. Certainly not bad for the price, seeing as how it's cheaper than many quads of similar size."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gulden Draak 9000 is a bit dark and the booze is a bit overpowering; however, it's delicious with a lot of layers and complexity in the flavor. It's not a great Quad but it's a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
"Light carbonation works for it, not so overwhelming that it needs any more. I've had better in the style (i.e. St. Bernardus) but this sure ain't bad for not being a trappist."
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid quad, but not as deep and rich. Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"O: Except for the crazy foam when I opened it, this was a wonderful brew. Recommended"
"Good looking beer. Good sincere smell. Balanced in terms of grain and hops. A light, sweet flavor, slightly fruity. Yeast is hidden in flavor profile. Amber in color and very clear with slight coagulation from refrigeration. Residual effects of ABV from a Quadrupel wasn't evidenced after one, but drinking several, those effects might accrue. 4-packs were selling for $23.95 so this is expensive too. A single 12 oz bottle was purchased for $6.59."
""
"Mouth feel is medium, the tingle and fluidity are light."
""
"Overall, a good beer but it has really been mis-marketed. Although there are some quad elements in the flavour, it is much closer to a tripel or BSPA. I have reviewed purely on the merits of the beer rather than ""to style"". You would certainly never include this beer in a ""quad tasting"" or anything of the like. Pretty unusual."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale."
""
""
"Pours a lovely amber with some pink and orangish hues. I'm getting almost no nose from this at all besides the typical yeast you get from a quad or a tripel. I'm actually very disappointed in this. Once you take a sip the disappointment from the nose goes away pretty quickly. Biscuit, apricot, leafy things, with a bit of citrus all meshing together seamlessly! Mouthfeel has a lot of carbonation early and finishes semi dry for a very different mouthfeel that covers all areas. Overall a very good beer but not being able to smell it brings it down a tad."
"overall - okay, but not as good as the regular Gulden Draak"
""
"O: Gulden Drake 9000 seems to straddle the quad and the triple styles and it does so with skilled precision. With hints of alcohol but notes of sweet malts it does marry the 2 styles, but overall this brew is terrific. If it were presented as a triple I think it might get better marks. However if you think of it as a variation on the style - it still blends the 2 styles artfully. Definitely worth a try - keep an open mind."
"very interesting beer. it calls itself a Quadrupel but is the lightest in color and flavor of any Quad I've ever tasted. it juicy and mildly sweet. Ultimately the beer falls short with its poor mouthfeel and flavor that is a little too subtle for the style."
""
"Overall: Funny the call the regular Gulden Draak a “Dark Tripel” and it taste just like a good BSDA. The call the 9000 version a quad and it’s much more like a strong tripel in flavor. Either way it’s a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: About five years of age would probably do this one some good. It’s good but just a bit too sweet and boozy for me to love. If you can, wait a long while to crack this one open."
""
"O - This is a fantastic quadrupel. Glad I was able to find one in Kansas."
""
""
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, didn't see a bottled date. This pours a mid sized off white head which has medium retention and leaves a lacing and the color is slightly golden color. The smells are spicy, some Belgian funk, some coriander, some fruit esters. The feel is medium high carbonination. The taste is spicy, a little hop bitterness, not as much malts as expected, very dry, but tasty."
""
""
"Overall, this is excellent beer, and one of the better quads on the market. I did find that the taste didn’t quite live up to the promise of the aromas, but even at that, the flavors were delicious, and almost perfectly balanced. A must-try for fans of Belgian ales."
""
"Taste comes across like a freight train! It's strong and assertive on the palate, with a wallop of fruit, spice, and bread right up front. The finish leaves a warming, boozy kick. Truly a big, heavy, and complex ale that rivals the original Gulden Draak. Classic and beautiful!"

"O: Easy to drink and lots of lighter flavors. This is an odd-take on a quadruple, this is brighter in color and hoppier/sweeter/lighter flavor than other typical examples of the style. Although, I will purchase again."
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer and I am glad that I have been able to try it. The quad thing really bothers me because it just doesnt taste like one, but if you can overlook that part, it's quite delicious."
""
""
"Quite good, as I expected it to be."
""
"Drink- I thought it was really tasty. Didnt exactly fit the style but oh well. Sometimes line blur between things. Tasty beer. Might grab a bottle or two."
""
"D - One is enough. I like the other Draak better, I think."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear amber color ale with a large foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma of fruity ester with some residual sugar and some dry fruits notes is quite intense. Taste is also a complex mix between light alcohol ester notes with some dry fruits and some residual sugar with light warming notes of alcohol. Body is quite full with good carbonation and some alcohol was apparent. Nice level of complexity but still a tad too sweet for my taste buds which could have been levelled out with a 2-3% reduction in ABV."
""
""
""
"A good beer, quite balanced and such but I prefer a dark quad over this."
""
"Overall: Hmm, I'm kind of conflicted about this beer. It's appearance is out of this world. The taste is very nice, refined, smooth with good mouthfeel, but it's just not....doing it....for me. I can't really put my finger on it. Everything works for what it is, but it's nothing new and lacking soem complexity i look for in my quads. Very good beer that's very refined with a dynamite appearance, but there are better quads out there."
""
""
""
""
"Quite enjoyable, but the appearance is not what I was expecting...."
"Interesting and different: a fine, strong beer and one I shall endevour to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells of candi sugar, caramel, a touch of bubblegum esters, some vinous dark notes appear as the glass warms up. Tastes mostly of caramel malt, various colors of apples and plums with some sour cherry / prune tones, and a medium-light booze sting in the finish. It's a fairly nice Quad!"
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light to medium orange amber. A careful pour resulted in a massive 4"" head of light brown foam that slowly dissipated leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of light and dark fruit, Belgian spicing, light caramel malt. Flavor is sweet stone fruits, dark fruit finishing slightly drier with fruit and a bit of peppery spice. Flavors are well integrated and cover the high ABV nicely. Medium bodied, a bit syrupy and creamy. A nice, flavorful quadrupel."
"Overall it's a good drink. It's not as dark and packed with flavour as you might expect, but it's ok."
""
""
""
""
"M/O: Very nice beer. Recommended. Light, spicy, sweet, and engaging. Still, I might not want to drink an entire bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong aroma has fruity, yeasty, and subtle malty notes plus a hint of caramel. It pours a clear coppery orange-brown with a fluffy, respectable pale wheat head. Satisfying flavor has a malty core with fruity and caramel notes and more than a hint of honey. The alcohol bite makes itself known, adding to the smooth yet lively texture that has firm, rich body. Don’t slay dragons - ride them!"
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, dark fruit, brown sugar, yeast, and spices. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, spices, and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and dangerously drinkable for its ABV."
""
"Overall a very nice beer. Not quite up to my favorite quad, but well worth having. I would gladly drink more of this."
""
""
""
"Tastes as a it smells: straightforward for the style, but still wonderfully strong and variegated. Honey starts things off, moving into a pleasant alcohol burn that lingers over nodes of ripe plums, brown sugar, green apples, caramel, and ending on a long wisp of spicy yeast."
"Dark amber in color with a khaki colored head. Sweet caramel and brown sugar on the nose right away. Some banana and dark fruit notes (quite a bit of red grape) follow that. A mild spice note and a hint of bubblegum as well. The bubblegum is more pronounced on the palate and adds to the sweetness of the caramel, brown sugar, and banana flavors. Similar dark fruit notes, almost overripe plums, grapes, and cherries."
"This beer poured out as an orange color... Not really what I was expecting for a Quad. The head was big, fluffy and cream colored. The head settles and leaves a film on top of the beer. The smell of the beer was loaded with caramel, dark fruits, and Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer was a little stronger than it should have been. There was a light amount hop bitterness in there that I feel overpowered the beers sweetness. The mouthfeel was sharp and not as soft and creamy as it should taste. Overall this isn't the best best Quad out there, it was nice to try but I wouldn't reccomend this to someone who is curious about the style."
""
""
""
"O: Good Quad here. Unique in the fact that it is more like a Tripel. The alcohol is somewhat tame given the ABV%. Refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
"A very nice mellow quadruple, no big gestures, rather light."
""
"I like this, its very good and has a lot of great belgian characteristics, but is quite a bit removed from what most people consider a Belgian Quad. It seems more like a super charged tripel, but its good enough that it doesn't matter."
""
""
"Overall another world class beer from Brouwerij Van Steenberge N.V. Just as good as regular Gulden Draak."
""
""
""
"I may buy a bottle or two to forget about for a year or so.. but I doubt it will do any good, it is just too estery and the residual sugars just hammer it."
""
""
""
"A rich brew. A little sweet, but very good."
"Overall - This is really good, very flavorful and strong, yet the alcohol is masked well. Tons of sweet fruits, yeasts and spices. Its very pricey but this should be treated as a speciality, not a everyday, or week, or even month beer. Shell out the cash if you enjoy quads, regular gulden draak, or belgium ales in general. Very nice beer."
"O: I'm not as impressed with this reimagining of Gulden Draak as some other reviewers. I enjoy the more pronounced hop character and the flavors imparted by the lighter malts, but the alcohol presence is way too heavy and forceful, even for the style. Couple this with the fact that the head retention is severely lacking, and you have a strong ale that may need to be tweaked a bit in the future. I may revisit this one a year or two down the road to see if anything has changed, but for now, it's solid, but not exceptional."

"Although the alcohol is roughly the same as the original Draak, it's barely lighter malting allows for superb balance of fruit and spice to play a larger role, although it also exposes its higher (and somewhat distracting) hop bitterness and needle-prick alcohols."
"Overall, a lot different than any quad I've had. The tartness balances out the typically cloying malt bill well, but there's enough complexity to keep me coming back for more."
"Taste is ooh, yeah."
""
""
"Overall: sweet and sugary like I would expect from a quad."
"D - complex and relatively balanced, the tart malt works well with the yeast."
""
""
"I'm left wondering if this is labeled a quad simply by nature of being the strongest in the lineup. As such I didn't rate to the style guidelines beyond the general characteristics of strong and tasty Belgian beers. Rated on its own merit is is definitely enjoyable although not exceptional."
""
"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Lots of carbonation. Poured a deep gold with a huge white head. Some Belgian yeast spice and a little alcohol in the nose. Bottle conditioned. Not as boozy as the nose would suggest. Fair amount of malt sweetness with more Belgian spice in the finish. Way too easy drinking for the ABV! You could get in trouble with this."
""
"330ml bottle. Chimay Chalice glass. Enjoyed on may´12. Amber color, orangish hues to the light.Hazy appearance. Close, off-white, slowly fading crown. Intense sugar, figs & spices to the nose. Gentle sugary upfront then increasing alcohol lingers into the end. Slightly peppery in the middle, just an illusion, fluid molasses all around –no cloying even though-. Full body, moderate carbonation. Pleasant drinkability. I love Quad style!"
""
"O- original GD reminds me more of a quad than a triple. the GD9000 reminds me more of a triple than a quad. maybe they just like to have fun with their beer classifications. either way, both brews are phenomenal in their own right. If i was a wealthier man, i would have a steady supply of each in my fridge. I can see myself picking this up more often if it ends up being a new regular GD brew."
""
"O - Very good flavor, a little sweet. Easy to drink for the alochol content, but probably can't drink more than one glass because of the sweetness. Prefer the regular Gulden Draak, however this is still good."
"A golden quadrupel, perhaps more of a bastard child of a BSPA and quad. Has a lot of BSPA characteristics but does some fruitiness and earthiness you can find in quads. Its good."
"I was overtaken by the color of the beer as I poured it. I was expecting a darker tone. The rich amber color was very nice. This beer, for me, is highly yeast driven as I picked up the aroma of spices, and somewhat of dried banana and corriander. VERY nice. A great pallet cleanser, and very enjoyable brew. A lighter SRM to its original version. Cheers."
"O - Enjoyable beer and at 10.7% you don't need too much."
""
"On tap at Sessions in GReensboro.Poured into a fluted glass a a deep burnt orange with a fluffy white head atop.Canied sugar/caramel with alot of fruity ester in the nose,candied sugar plays a big role in this beer.Burnt sugar flavors are big with some vanilla caramel flavors almost like a hard toffee,light yeasty spiced notes along with some juicy fruit round out the palate.This is a rich tasting full flavored quad,one of the best I have had,seek it out if you can find it."
"ow and I have to say it's OVER 9,000!!!"
""
"I'm a little taken aback. This borders on a mega-strong pale ale. It's an amped-up Gulden Draak Dark Tripel without those delicious dark chocolate and plummy notes; subbed with more and more and more booziness, drier fruits, and a piquant quality. I'll stick to my go-to quads from here on out. 3.5"
"Alcohol is quite strong but mellows after bottle is opened. Carbonation is just right. Start to finish the was a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: truly delicious - with only a few reviews I guess this is a new release or a rarity; the abv is rock-solid and, man, this is why Belgium gets such respect for their beers - those guys know beer - shoulda bought the whole 4-pack..."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer. I'm not very impressed. I'll try it again in the future"
"For now it was a lovely experience. In the category sweet heavy beers: a topper!"
""
""
""
"Tasty tingling and a long aftertaste."
""
"Overall: I poured this into a Cantillon tulip. I was surprised to read that this is a quadruple because it’s much lighter that what I would suspect. Although it’s high on ABV (10.5% ABV) so perfect for splitting. It’s very good, and drinkable. I would buy and drink again and again and again. Lekker! Note, in Belgium the bottle is titled Gulden Draak 9000 Quadruple; in Dutch/Flemish it means golden dragon."
"This is a very nice beer, but not as bold a flavor as I'd expect from a quad."
""
""
""
" Aftertaste: little metallic, more ripe banana’s, dried apricots. Will probably improve a lot upon aging. I guess it’s still a little too young."
""
"Pours a dark brownish-orange w/ a beautiful one finger cocoa head. Excellent lacing on the side of the glass. I'm super excited about this one, as I love the regular Gulden Draak. The nose is Belgian yeast, fruits, raisins, dates, and spices. Not quite as complex as the standard Draak. Taste is the same- it's just not quite as amazing and complex as the regular Gulden Draak. It's still really good- just not amazing. Feel steps it up a notch. Very little of the 11.3% ABV is evident- they hid it somewhere. Overall, this is a really good beer that falls short of great. Cheers."
"Overall good by not overly memorable. Worth a try, though maybe not at $11 a pour..."
"O - The man at the booth was correct and we all agreed, this stuff is DANGEROUS. Such a high ABV packs great flavors and appearances, but the lightest of mouthfeels. This is a scarey kind of dangerous, by the time you feel the ABV you've slammed back a couple and its too late. Will be buying many bottles of this."
