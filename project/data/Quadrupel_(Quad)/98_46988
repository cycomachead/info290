Minimal lacing clings to the glass, with a small amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of plum, prune, molasses, caramel, cherry, toast, biscuit, banana, allspice, cinnamon, clove, and a bit of alcohol. Some pretty nice and quite unique Quadrupel aromas; with good balance and complexity. Taste of prune, cherry, toast, raisin, biscuit, allspice, banana, clove, and alcohol. Lingering notes of dark fruit, toast, spices, clove, banana, molasses, caramel, and biscuit on the finish for a good bit. Flavors are pretty good, but it is a bit boozy and not as complex as I was hoping. No cloying sweetness. Medium-low carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a fairly slick and thick mouthfeel that is decent. Alcohol presence is quite noticeable with a large lasting warming on the finish. Overall this is an ok quad. Decent flavor balance and complexity; and pretty smooth to sip on slowly.","superspak","Aug 09, 2012"

Smell was intense booze and over the top sweet with fruits/malts (oranges, cloves, cointreau). Taste was melted carmel with carbonation. Heavy sugar taste, almost syrup. Way too sweet for my palate.

Ripe bananas, caramelized fruits, caramel, and boozy maple syrup round out the palate. Brown sugar and toasted marshmallow fill out the finish. Some faint herbal hop notes throughout, but they get very lost in the malt and booze of this big boy. Full-bodied, syrupy feel. This one will warm you up and give you your fill of rummy fruit. A definite sipper!","alexgash","Aug 12, 2011"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Quad reminded me of a cross between a Unibroue beer and Samuel Adams' Imperial White, the only drawback being that, unlike in those brews, Harpoon didn't quite manage to hide the strong alcohol flavor as well, leaving a bitterness to the aftertaste that didn't match the rest of the mouthful. Mouthfeel is indeed velvety, as noted in the brewer's blurb, and while I (mostly) agree that this is a "superbly drinkable beer," I would also caution that this is not one for chugging. In fact, it should probably be savored like a glass of port.","jondeelee","Aug 09, 2011"

Decent mouthfeel, but a bit hot. Everything is done right here, yet still, something is lacking to elevate this to superlative. perhaps its that it isn't perfectly integrated, or lacks some of the esters that unleash some particularly interesting fruit notes, but although it is pleasant enough enough, its just lacks that "moreness".","Georgiabeer","Sep 05, 2010"

I feel that there is way too much sediment floating around in my glass, even if it is an unfiltered beer. The head dissapates quickly, but leaves a ton of lacing atound the edge of the glass. The aroma is extremely sweet malt. eviathan Quad is extremely thick and malty with a very sweet beginning and an ending that has more than a hint of boozey warmth. Not quite as complicated a taste as a Bernardus or any of the great Quads, it's more of a simple type of sweetness similar to Troeggs Mad Elf. This just feels like the high abv beer that it is. This makes it a little harder to drink, especially the way the sweetness coats the tongue and contributes to a sweet aftertaste.

At first candy sugar and caramel came forward followed by alcohol heat in the middle, wood, Belgian yeast and an herbal, bitter finish.

Pours a hazy mahogany tinted dark amber color with an absolutely huge stiff light tan head that decomposes slowly like an ice cream float. Sheets of lacing...wow, i'm really surprised. The smell is really good...classic earthy Belgian yeast, notes of figs over lighter harvest fruits. The mouth feel is tangy from the alcohol, lightly carbonated and full bodied. Full flavored, and complex...there is a strong earthy taste, pears and apples carried over nicely from the nose and a great spicy character over a caramel-like sweetness. It has a nice warming creamy smooth drinkability. This one is scoring BIG points for imagination and complexity. Highly recommended. Its interesting that previous reviews are using words of praise yet the scores aren't there...i don't understand. If it kicks your a$$ you must ACQUIT... : ) Peace...Go Team Harpoon!!","jjayjaye","Jun 06, 2009"

Tastes fruity and spicey. Noot too black pepper-like as some stronger belgian styles do. Yeasty, clove, a bit whiskey-like. Quite sweet with a warm boozey finish. Mouth is fairly moderate, a good medium carbonation level. A bit of spice in the mouth and a bit syrupy as well.

Aroma is sweet and spiced. Taste starts sweet, yeast spicing in the middle, hops peek out next, and then the close finds acohol turning on the burn. Mouthfeel is smooth until it gets too hot at the swallow, and drinkability is somewhat limited by same. Dial the abv back a touch, and we'd have something here.","ppoitras","May 09, 2009"

It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of dark fruits and raisins. The alcohol is well pronounced. The taste is decent as well. It has an alcohol ridden taste that's ripe with raisiny flavors, and crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average quad, but it's lacking complexity. I applaud Harpoon for the the effort. I hope they continue to produce these kinds of beers.","WesWes","May 09, 2009"

This beer and all the American attempts at Belgians that I have had before it makes me wonder if there should be a new category for American Quad and perhaps even American Tripel. Although some come closer than others (this being solidly in the "others" category), we clearly can't get the Belgians quite right.","frothyhead","May 01, 2009"

Smell is wacky but pretty awesome, tons of banana like esters, some biscuity malt and candi sweetness, sherry, tons of fruit, some strawberry, cherries and pineapple, guava, more banana, alcohol is well hidden, pretty crazy stuff. Taste is really sweet, very sugary, more banana, lots of fruity, light bit of biscuity malt in the middle, big alcohol, sherry, fusely, kind of earthy, brown sugar in the finish, very sweet. Mouthfeel is not good, especially for a quad. Way too thick and syrupy, lowish carbonation, like drinking a sugar solution. Does burn a touch on the way down but otherwise alcohol is hidden decently. Some good and some bad about this one, back to the drawing board for them.","Viggo","Apr 21, 2009"

3.26,-11.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"I was surprised to see this on tap last night at the Sports Depot (of all places) in Allston last night, so I ordered one. Was served in a Leviathan 10 oz glass. Dark ruby red color. Nice white head that lasted a while. Good amount of lacing. Smell was a bit on the strong side, very boozy. Very grape-like smell. Taste was fairly nice, but a bit overly sweet. Caramel and grape jelly flavors dominate. On the downside, the alcohol profile is very hot. Noticeable burning feeling on the palate. Sad to say, but this beer was a bit of a burden to drink. Way too much flavor and alcohol. Needs to be toned way down. In bottle form, some aging might do some good. I can see why it's only served in 10 oz pours. This is my first taste of the Leviathan series, and it certainly is an extreme beer. A little too extreme, in my opinion.","morebeergood","Apr 10, 2009"

2.93,-20.4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Tempered sweetness throughout, most prominent up front. Quickly has a spicy twist to it that opens up a huge raisiny sour bitterness. Towards the end, a decent hoppy kick (for something like this) comes in, and the bitternesses mingle into something leaving almost an acrid trail down my throat, yet it's all slightly sweet. Not at all what I was expecting. Complex in a different way than I was expecting. Definitely not a normal-style quad. I'm really torn. I hate the bitterness, but somehow it all seems OK at the end. Still not my favorite flavor, though. Mouthfeel is bold, exciting, different. Drinkability suffers bigtime between the high ABV and the sour kicks. The alcohol doesn't really burn a lot, but it is very evident in the finish. For me, this is nice to try, but I think that's all it will be.","damienblack","Mar 14, 2009"
3.18,-13.6,4,3.5,2.5,4,3.5,"This beer poured a dark amber red. Nice size head. First smell is alcohol and a candied sweetness. The taste follows this, very candy fruit taste, almost too sweet. There is definately that alchohol feel that lingers in the mouth. But its a very warming feeling, you don't need to have more than two of these at a time. Overall I think I prefer the Sam Adams Imperial White to this Harpoon offering. The Harpoon is a little too sweet.","Liverpool08","Mar 14, 2009"
3.21,-12.8,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"So far I have not been impressed by the Leviathan series brews from Harpoon. Alas, a Quad sounded really good to me tonight, and this one I haven't tried, so might as well go ahead. Pour yields a really beautifully colored beer, has a rosewood color, with a pillowy white head. Booze and stone fruits are the first thing that came to mind when I smelled. I suppose the alcohol is to be expected though with a beer this size. At the beginning there was a really strange smell in there, but that has since faded, so I guess I can disregard that. As it has warmed some honey and nectar smells have come through. Alcohol is more subdued in the taste, leaning more towards the dark fruit aspects of this beer. Toward the end of each sip however, some alcohol bitterness does manage to appear. Luckily it does not linger on the palate for too long. Decent enough heavy bodied mouthfeel on this one. Drinkability is not bad, as it definitely does not seem as rough as the other two Leviathans. Overall a pretty good effort from Harpoon. I would not go out of my way to seek out a four pack, but a single is a good enough buy in my book. Cheers","jamie2dope","Mar 11, 2009"
