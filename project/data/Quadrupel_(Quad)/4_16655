3.75,-8.1,4.25,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Perfect brew to open up for Juno.  750ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash chalice.  2014 vintage.  Pours somewhere between cider and mahogany in color with a slight haze to the clarity and a rocky, two inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Nose is somewhat subdued - figs and yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a faint medicinal quality and a trace of something metallic towards the back.  Mouthfeel is medium-light with an easy, even carbonation.  Overall, a decent Quad but the pricepoint ($18.49) and overall character isn't on par with the exemplars of the style (e.g. St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 10, etc.).","Jwale73","Jan 23, 2015"

Aromas of subtle spicing and a rich, bready backbone of old world fruit and toasted bread. Boozy highlights throughout the nose, also. This one smells rich and solid. Flavors are rich and roasted, with a nutty backbone supporting fig and black cherry sweetness. Tart and rich throughout, with a fruit sugar base that is enduring from start to finish. Spicing comes out as the beer warms. Pepper, basil, oregano, nutmeg, and clove, amongst other spices. You could sit all day and pick apart the intricacies of this one. Amazing. The body is smooth throughout, but avoids overpowering. The aftertaste is boozy, with highlights of roasted notes and old world fruit sweetness. Smooth, clean finish with only a hint of sweet linger. Just enough to entice you back for another sip. Solid, big, bold beer. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Jun 22, 2013"

Nice presentation. Aroma is sweet with heavy stone fruit, light malt and Belgian spicing; slightly sour. Flavor of sweet and caramel malt and light fruit. Moderately dry in the middle. Finishes with Belgian spices, a bit of hops and sweet fruit. Nice medium to heavy body. Not as intense or complex as the best Belgian quads, but pleasant and very nice to drink. Another top notch Allagash ale.","LiquidAmber","Mar 11, 2012"
4.45,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle purchased at the Charleston Beer Exchange. The appearance of this beer is outstanding. Poured into a tulip glass the beer has a thick creamy persistent head. The color of the beer is a gorgeous reddish orange. The nose is cherries, apples, and a hint of clove. The taste is predominantly a pleasantly sour fruit mostly cherry and apple. The hops are subtle. These are definitely not west coast hops! The 10% ABV is very well hidden, almost no burn. This is a very smooth and mild quad. It is much lighter and not as vinous as a Westvleteren. This beer really tastes like a saison ale to me. The only negative is a slightly thin body and mouthfeel. However, at 750 ml, you better share this one! I highly recommend this complex beer. I will drink it again.","tomfneph","Mar 09, 2012"

4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip, batch 18(2008 bottling I think). Pours very hazy dark red color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, banana, caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Nice aromas with big fruitiness. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toasted malt, molasses, candi sugar, biscuit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, toffee, dark fruit, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 10%, with hardly any warming after the finish present. Very smooth and drinkable, but it is still a sipper. Overall this is an outstanding Belgian Quad with tons of great flavor and balance. I would definitely have this again.","superspak","Jan 15, 2012"

It has a delicious aroma. Fruity esters strike the nose first, followed by a small amount of bitter hops...all pleasant. The beer has a nice full mouthfeel, that warms the stomach nicely. It has a nice and original flavor from the darkened hops. Makes me think of nicely toasted grains that mix nicely with the esters that seem to dominate the later taste characteristics. Very good. Been holding onto this bottle far too long.","cracgor","Jan 13, 2012"

Malty taste, a little bit sweet, but certainly not as cloying and raisin-like as I've tasted in some other quad's I've tried. Drank quite easily; not as heavy as many in the style. Very enjoyable offering.","medic25","Oct 17, 2011"

4.25,4.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark amber color, with a nice two finger cocoa head. Good carbonation and lacing on my snifter. The head is very pillow-like in appearance, and sticks around for a long time. Nose is yeast, malt, hops, caramel, dark fruit, and spices. Really nice nose on this brew- it could easily pass for a Belgian Quad on the smell. Taste is good, but not quite up to the smell. This is definitely one of the smoothest, malty, drinkable Quads I've ever had. The hops are hidden, but you get some of them in the taste. The 10% ABV is there w/ a little bit of alcohol burn on the aftertaste- it's pretty mellow though. Feel is silky smooth and sweet, with the hop bitterness barely there. Overall, this is a very enjoyable Quad. Definitely in the top 3 or 4 American Quads I've had (off the top of my head). Definitely worth picking up. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Sep 30, 2011"
3.72,-8.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Enjoyed on-tap at Churchkey. Reddish brown pour without much head. Malty smell, not boozy and not a lot of dark fruits on this one, light and malty. The dark fruits and booze come thru more on the taste. Which is pretty dry. Light body with sort of a weird aftertaste. Carbonated well. A bit off-putting overall. Not a great quad. Too malty, too strange tasting.","russwbeck","Sep 10, 2011"

4.27,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Narrative: His polished leather heels clicked lightly on the linoleum floor, waiting, with knowing expectations of his own ability. ""The same magazines every time, far below my interests, yet beyond my ability to resist-"" he reached forward and thumbed lazily through a copy of ""OUTDOOR MONTHLY"" noting esoteric information about tent liners. This wasnt his first job interview, but his resume made it clear that he was overqualified, so why was he here, filling a middle management role? It was not for want of ambition, for after all, he prepared 4 times as long as most other candidates. Nor was it for want of character, his euphemisms and passing comments regailed even the most dourfaced water cooler circles. ""Glade plug ins, figures, quite the way to garnish the first foyer that expectant clients will encounter."" No, it was his robust complexity that was his own undoing, the sheer force of his resume that created expectations that he could not fill and pretentions that filled the void. There was a condescending upshot to the end of his sentences that connoted that all parties present should have known what he said beforehand. ""HoW long did THEY HAPPEN t0... SAY?"" He requested of the overqualified intern, equally nonplussed with the generic waiting room. It was his content that wowed, but his overall presentation, the custom tailored suit, the wry witticisims that ultimately cost him that job. It did not matter, in his mind he knew that he was four times as qualified as the other candidates. It was that personal victory that carried the day.","SubpoenaDeuces","Apr 15, 2011"

Also prickly with great carbonation, the sticky heaviness of the beer is countered and not murkey. I pick up sweet malts like candy sugar and some bready malts as well. Also picking up some tartness like cherry and a hint of citric hop flavoring.

4.12,1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into Gouden Carolus chalice. The bottle is marked Batch #21 and was purchased earlier today. The beer has a large foamy head colored off white. The liquid appears to be a few shades of brown mixed together; I'm tempted to call it tan, or deep copper, or burnt orange, but really it is none of these. There is a lot of carbonation rising within my glass. Lacing appears to be fairly even. The beer has a very interesting, robust aroma. The malts really get to me. There's a touch of sweet, a touch of spice and a touch of alcohol. It reminds me a lot of this beer's Belgian inspirations, but I also picture a pine cone as I inhale. It truly is a Maine Quad. The beer tastes a big spicier than I expected. The finish is especially peppery. The light and dark candi sugars add a subtle sweetness that is very good. The pepper and alcohol linger a bit and leave a warm coating. It is full bodied and feels thick. The carbonation can be readily felt. A mildly sweet and equally sticky film is left upon my lips. I'm enjoying this beverage, but will do so at a slow pace. Perhaps it is best suited split with three of your friends, but I'll be able to consume it all myself over the next couple of hours. It is a beer I would drink again, but there are other Allagashes and Quads that I prefer.","ToasterChef","Sep 06, 2010"

4.22,3.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - This beer is hard to judge, it is not as dark in malt character as some other examples of the style and seems to lose some of its potential complexity as a result, but it is very well balanced and there is a smoothness to the flavor and to the yeast character in particular that speaks of careful bottle conditioning. The malt character is mostly layers of caramel with a hint of brown sugar and molasses and the yeast is mostly spicy notes rather than the dark fruit I expected. This works fairly well and does not become medicinally phenolic the way spicy yeast character often does in dark Belgian beer styles. In a way, it seems more like a very strong dubbel than a quad/dark strong. It is not the most interesting Quad that I have ever had, but it has a balance and poise that I would normally only expect from a beer made by a Belgian brewery and have almost never seen in an American brewed example of the style.","nickfl","Jul 12, 2010"

Though this brew may not have the greens of summer, it has an indescribable amount of shades of brown and red, earth tones galore; Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away, 'cause I wanna take a pic o' this lovely collection o' hues. Above the colors floats a scent mostly composed of sweetness: straight granulated sugars, some brown sugar, maybe even some candy sugar. A bit o' yeastiness makes itself known as well. All's I know is that this smell is as sweet as the punch (like the Association's narrator's empty cup...look it up...). It's not all sweet, though, as along comes Mary...in the form of miscellaneous grains (there was a hint in there for the prior reference...too subtle?). My tongue also finds some sweetness, but it is toned down a great degree compared to the nose. The grains lead you along now, not unlike Crispian St. Peters (you can always tell when my iTunes is on shuffle whilst I review). Only this pipe leads to a varied taste sensation that hides hints of banana, clove (ah, Belgium...), vanilla, and some o' that sugar that was so omnipresent in the nose. Though ""four"" was the theme during brewing, more than four flavors play together, riding down the highway that is life (damn you, Tom Cochrane, for making me force that reference!). Admittedly, I expected a more syrupy brew when I sniffed the surface. What I get instead is a nice, fairly effervescent, medium-bodied Belgian stew. And I mean that in as good a way as possible. I want more of this, but I'm sure this bomber will be more than enough after I've driven it all night long (once again, I ahake my fist at the aforementioned Mr. Chochrane...).","TMoney2591","Apr 27, 2010"

Spices are well integrated into the foundation of the beer - not distinct but very complex. Some yeastiness as it warms, too - but there is an odd bubble gum note that comes up too which was slightly unpleasant. Finish is fairly crisp, bready malts, a hint of alcohol and general fruitiness.

Slightly burnt caramel up front, then tastes like those orange creme candies your grandmother always had in a cut-glass dish. Finishes with a sharp, woody note that makes me thirsty for more. Wow! Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, assertively bubbly up front and then a touch oily and almost sticky. Its got a body to stand up to the carbonation. Very drinkable.

It was a hazy dark amber with some light tan head. It smelled a bit faint, but like creamy Belgian yeast and mulling spices and toffee. Delicious. It tasted similar to the smell, but bolder and with a lot of nuances and complexities that I'm sure I missed (split this pint with a friend, and had already had a couple pints before). My main thought was how surprisingly similar this tasted to St. Bernardus, which is one of my all-time favorites. However, the key difference was the body and feel. Despite Four being on cask, St. Bernardus from a bottle somehow manages to be much smoother and silkier. Four was a little thin and flat. I'd probably normally give the mouthfeel a 4, but considering it was on cask, I had to dock it a half point for not living up to my hopes/expectations. Otherwise, this was a very enjoyable beer.

It's got a medium mouthfeel, not very heavy, but sweet so it stays with you. Flavor profile expands with each taste and as the beer warms, grapes give way to tart apple.

A peppery center leads to a surprisingly dry and hop-filled finish. In the mouth, the beer is relatively light with moderately strong carbonation. Ends up feeling a bit astringent.

There are hints of raisiny sweetness up front and in the finish. Mouthfeel is on light to medium, very low carbonation keeps it thinner which is quite nice. Drying in the finish with a little spicy dance of hops and alcohol. Overall, a great beer for me, the alcohol was very well masked and shoed itself in the right amounts.

It had a great lightly sour aroma of ripe juicy fruits (way too many to list), yeast, and a small spatter of bitter hops in the background. Toward the bottom of the glass, the aroma will get very oaky and sour. These fruits in the aroma were so good, I couldn't stop smelling this beer! The taste was very fruity with toasted malts, a pinch of yeast, and a slight touch of oak and citrus hops at the end. The oak was a nice touch. The mouthfeel was slick as hell! I had no idea from the mouthfeel that this beer had a high ABV%. I had to find out from the bartender that this beer had a high ABV%. Besides that, this beer had an aftertaste of juicy fruits, yeast, and a pinch of citrus hops. This was one to nice beer to try on-tap! It is expensive to try on-tap, but it's worth it.

There are hints of carob and perhaps fig. The feel is light but not watery with fizzy carbonation; finishes sweet. Definitely a brew with some big bold aromas and flavors.

Very nice. The aroma has a very complex yeasty quality, but actually a bit timid, no... refined, we'll call it, with faint spices, a dry, sweet malty and fruity nose. The taste full of fruits, complex sugars and spicy yeasts. Much similar to the nose, but also some darker stuff, brown sugar is present here, some rich caramels, plums and figs and raisins figure in, the alcohol becoming more and more apparent as it warms. The body is above medium, but should be a bit bigger, is fairly smooth and warm, not the best part but not subtracting from it.

I really like this one though. The flavors are bright and alive. Very active carbonation on the tongue. It's got a satisfying bite as you swallow. The alcohol melds well with its surrounding influences. While malt driven, you can still pick out some of the hop characteristics such as citrus fruit and a touch of bitterness. I'm not yet proficient at picking out individual flavors in belgian style beers in particular, but I do know what I like.

Tastes confirm all the fruits and yeast, while adding a confectionate sugar sweetness along with Belgian spiciness. The beer continues with a warming and numbing effect, but never getting fusal or harsh. Lots of sweet alcohols nearly hurt the teeth (kinda Samichlaus-like).

4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into Chimay chalice, a nice musty reddish amber. The head dissipates at medium speed and lingers on surface, its sustained by tiny bubbles and leaves little lacing, At first sniff smells almost like that strawberry Nesquick, predominately sweet malts, with minimal, yet supportive hop character. There are hints of strawberry, vanilla, light fruity esters and maybe even minor touches of berry and apple. If the smell doesnt get you the flavor will. The flavor is excellent, enticing and welcoming, the sweet malts are balanced masterfully, with just the right amount of hoppy bitterness. The spectacular malts are definitely the showcase of this beer, along with their excellent fruity esters. I could drink this stuff like crazy, if it wasnt 10 ABV, which is hidden ridiculously well. How ever to most this beer does not have the marks of what you'd look for in a killer quad, lacking body, head and what have you, but I still find it to be a fun version of a one. Some of the sents and flavors might at moments seem synthetic, which I acknowledge, but for me they turn out in a tasty way that works well. I mean this beer even has great quenching capability, but to quench your thirst with this is to feel its strength. Every thing about this beer screams drink me and then buy another bottle so you can show your friends, but drink me. This is a fabulous beer, and a great concept, there is no question I will buy this again.","mmcave","Oct 04, 2006"

Smells like raisin, date, brown sugar, pith, and peppery phenols. Tastes fruity, with plum, grape, date, citrus, pith, with peppery notes. Chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar also play prominent roles. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV and complexity.

Pours with a dark red-golden color with no head. Smell is tremendous, with lots of sugars and dense malts. With the taste I was expecting the kind of beer thats almost hard to drink because of the complexity, but the amount of flavor doesnt seem to be as big as the sum of its parts. The most discernable taste that really sums up the beer is of candied fruits, most likely coming from the grains. A great beer, but I dont think it lives up to the high reputation of what you'd expect from such a special beer from Allagash.","Toddv29424","Jul 11, 2006"

Aromas of plums, figs, earth, grains, and dried fruits seemed to come out. The taste was filled with earthy flavors like ripe dark fruits and grains. The dominating sweetness was offset by a subtle and yet sufficient bitterness. Layers of flavors seemed to jump out of this beer. Somewhat creamy and slick in my mouth. Very easy to sip and enjoy.

I would have loved for this beer to have more attenuated sugars and a fruitier aroma à la Rocherfort 10 (I cant really have an ABT without comparing it to the best).

The taste is quite fruity (citrusy orange peel & lemon), with the spices coming on more thick and the alcohol creating a strong warming effect..the Belgian malts and yeast really add to the flavor, but the hops are fairly subtle despite the supposed four varieties. The mouthfeel is somewhat grainy, but the rich flavors keep you yearning for more. Not a bad interpretation of the rare style, but it's hard to truly appreciate this when I'm lucky enough to have one of the best (St. Bernardus 12) on-tap a few blocks down the street.

I just couldn't bring my self to open open (if I drink one I'll only have 5 left). Finally broke down and drank one for Thanksgiving Eve; had to rationalize it). Anyway, aroma was great. Even though there are four malts in this, I really didn't notice it or the hops. What I really noticed was the cherry and ruby port. Head was creamy, light-brown, excellent lacing, that mostly diminished. Color was dark amber. Heavy sweet initial flavor that lessens. Definitely can taste the malt now. Finish was very long. The body was not as full as some quads. Texture was syrupy and flat with incredibly little if any alcohol finish. One of my favorite quads. It was very smooth without too much cherry, like Three Phils. Very interested to see how this matures. Now only if Allagash would distribute to Georgia.","doubleipa","Oct 09, 2005"

You can smell the 10% alcohol a bit. Tastes very malty upfront, crisply of apples, with some spicy alcohol and hops in the finish. Has an unpleasant, rotten apple aftertaste. I'm a fan of Allagash's other beers, but Four--actually the Quadrupel style in general--is just too malty and sweet for me to really get into.

Spiciness melds well with the other aromas and carries into the flavour. The fruitiness is more subdued in the flavour with malt coming more to the forefront. The balance leans toward sweetness, but there is still noticeable bitterness. Alcohol contributes a warming sensation with little flavour. The finish is on the dry side, with some hop bitterness and peppery spice. Lowish carbonation and a moderately full body. Overall, nicely balanced and quite enjoyable.

The nose is typically Belgian in nature with it's yeasty phenols, fruit and spice dominating over its lightly sugar-ish, delicately caramelish, and somewhat nutty maltiness. Alcohol can also be found, but it's not obtrusive. The body is medium-light; and it's zesty on the palate initially with a very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation. However, it becomes a bit more airy as it warms (as is common). In the flavor, the alcohol is a little bit more apparent; there's a touch of bubblegum to the phenols; and the maltiness has more of a brown sugar character to it - but it's basically what the nose suggests it should be. The yeastiness is very much like Chimay, and to be honest, this is very much like a more attenuated version of their Grande Reserve. It finishes dry with a slap of spicy alcohol and yeasty phenols, but not much more.

4.15,1.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Doesnt have the head normally associated with Belgian style beers...it forms a decent one with the pour, but it quickly fades. Once poured, its an opaque brownish-orange; can not see through it. Seems to me to be very reminiscent of a dubbel. Not as hearty as I would have expected from a quad. The alcohol is masked completely though, even as it warms. Even as its not as hardy as I would expect, I still think it tastes very good...I find it hard to distinguish the flavors as they blend very nicely. The mouthfeel is where this beers fails though. The carbonation is prickly (that term has never been more appropriate), and the beer is lighter then expected. The carbonation issue I find the most troubling. I had no trouble finishing this off in one sitting, but I dont think I'd revisit it. I have a Victory 12 yet to be drank, and I'd like to try some true belgian quads for comparison, but as it stands, I find this good, but underwhelming. Certainly better then their grand cru, which is the only other Allagash I've had at this point, however.","BrewMan13","Nov 09, 2004"

Subtle caramel, candi sugar and malt, faint caramel apple and fusel alcohols, suggesting a complete fermentation, and lightly herbal hops all round out a pretty subdued nose. Some scorchy malt flavors show up in the taste, spiciness and warming alcohol heats the esophagus. Hops are indiscernable, other than a slight twang undercurrented in the whole flavor. Grape, fig and pear-like fruit esters blend together with a very smooth malt profile than has a touch of wheat and has a higher carbonation level. Overall, a strong quad that hides its alcohol well by utilizing the process of multiple fermentations. Not bad, but I'll betcha it'll be better in another year when I try it again.","crookedhalo","Sep 06, 2004"

No hop presence on the nose. The malt is up front on the 1st taste too. Then I detect a bite from the alcohol, and finally a bit of a nip from the malt. Its not overly sweet which is pleasantly surprising. With the extra fermentation I was expecting it to be thicker. It has a fairly heavy mouth feel, and for me I could have 1 or 2, but this is definitely not a session beer.

Easy to pick up alcohol, but its an ABT and you dont mind that. Decent flavor balance, but just not as appealing fruitiness or yeastiness than top examples who are probably just as sweet, but manage to stuck your mind out of this thought. Full body, high carbonation a la allagash, smooth anyway.

The taste had a rum-like quality to it, with the spices and sweet fruit flavors blending together perfectly. The only negative thing about this brew, is that it is SO spicy, and SO fruity, it is almost like a fruit and spice overload! Perhaps if this is aged for a year or two it will become more blended, and less intense! The mouthfeel was medium-thick and the drinkability was very good for a 10% abv beer!

And yes, that ABV works a bit against drinking more, because it hits real hard, not only warming, but clouding things up as well.

The mouthfeel is creamy, full and smooth with a delicate feel and a lively carbonation. The flavor is also one to desire. A sugary, malty spicy treat that has a faint and enjoyable hop presence which lends a slight grassy note. Not as complex or deep a flavor as some Belgian Quads we all are familiar with but I wasn't expecting that either. This is an American brew.

I was able to talk to the brewer, so I told him I thought the taste was reminiscent of the grand cru, but much more muted and blended (in a good way!). It had the spicey taste of the cru, but as he explained to me, there are no spices used in this one, the 'spiceness' in the taste comes from the brewing art/process itself.
