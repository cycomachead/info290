"The beer has a very dark color, almost black, with a beige head. Aroma of spices, fruit (plums, raisins), and a little smell of wine. These aromas reappear in the taste, combined with some hints of chocolate and coffee and a little smoke in the afterstaste. You can really taste that this beer is matured in wine and calvados barrels. But all these different tastes are so well balanced, which makes it a top class beer."
"I had this beer at La capsule in France. Trully amazing beer. Also had it in bottle. Incredible complexity. Very Close to perfection."

"2008 bottle opened in 2014. This is brief because I did not have access to the internet at the time of opening. Past its prime but wonderful and interesting. Intricate flavors in harmony and rather subdued. I bought this bottle in Belgium at a shop in Brussels."

"Holy great 10-year old aged beer.  This must have been properly cellared because this was a nice, smooth, balanced beer.  The feel of this beer was particularly surprising.  Silky smooth with a nice tingly carbonation.  Can't wait for bottle #2"
"Overall:  Fantastic quad.  The best that I ever have had.  Absolutely delicious smell and flavor,  Great feel.  I could drink this over and over.  I want more!"

"2005. Tastes of rubber and oxidization."
"This tastes like latex baloons."

"Overall this is fantastic. Better than Reserva and quite possibly better than the best standard Pannepot that I've had. The use of calvados barrels as a finish is what really elevates this higher than the standard oak aged. Great wine, grape,plum, and rum flavors that aren't as prominent in the Reserva. Hope I can find more of this."
"I've never had this bottle fresh, but 9 years has seemed to do well for this beer. The apple notes really separate it from other quads out there, I would definitely pick up another bottle of this to see how a fresher vintage is."

"Hauled this 2009 bottle back from Bruges, Belgium. Pours dark brown in my glass with some purple showing in the edges where the light comes through. Small off white head that disappears pretty quickly. Aroma of dark fruits, figs, plums, light molasses and even chocolate, candi sugar. Flavor is sweet plums and figs, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolateyness, and a smooth nuttiness from the barrel. Age showing a bit here with some oxidization going on. Thick body, low plus carbonation, really rich and palate coating. Nice beer but would like to try one a bit fresher as this wasn't nearly the level of Reserva or even the regular version. Still yummy though, which speaks to how good those are."

"O: I had an 08 Grand Reserva and was blown away, while this is good I think Rochefort 10 is better it's odd what one single year would do to the taste. this is a good quad but I was a little surprised with the light harshness of alcohol.  Overall a very pleasant quad"

"Almost couldn't believe I saw this on the shelf. 10/10. would buy again"
""
"Its long and decadent finish is slow to release. As its sweetness gently rolls off the palate, its brandy head builds and those apple influences take hold. Slight numbing warmth and wood spices give a soft dryness to the otherwise savory dessert beer.`"

"-I think this would have been a very fine beer in its prime. I recently had a 2010 Reserva that rocked my world. This is a shell of that beer. I am giving extra points to the overall score given that opening any beer at this age is a crapshoot and that Pannepot has not disappointed me in the past."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, candied fruit, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with candied fruit, caramel, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that seems a bit old and oxidized at this point, but it's still fairly tasty as is."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"old, yes. but still drinking well IMO"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sophie Marceau...aging but still plenty well put together."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, perhaps I should have drank this a few years back but still glad I did not. Nice complexity here."
""
""
""
"Vintage '05 on the bottle. Pour is deep brown with a tight tan head. Nose has a ton of rich dark malt, figs, brown sugar, red grapes, a bit oxidized, nutty, cardboard, and boozy notes in back. Taste is also a good bit oxidized. The cardboard is strong with the rich malt being faded. Brown sugar and fig with booze in back. The cardboard lingers through the finish. Medium to full body, fairly good carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This definitely has its drawbacks. The oxidation doesn't open up any exciting flavors. It's not too old, but it's old. Nonetheless, this is a fantastic and complex beer."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - This is probably a bit oxidized, but still pretty enjoyable. The aroma is quite original and enjoyable with lot's of complexity. You can tell that there was a world class Quad underneath this, but maybe it peaked a few years ago. Still pretty darn good though."
""
""
""
""
"O-Incredible. Calvados is there, but light. Drink it now before the Barre disappears."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A little disappointed with this beer. Not enough oaky flavours and considering its so hard to get I wouldn't bother."
""
""
""
""
"O - A thought provoking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad overall, the aroma is still incredible, and there are a lot of good flavors in there, but this beer is certainly over the hill by now. I'm not gonna ding it too hard on the score though because I can tell how good this used to be, need to get a fresher bottle of this ASAP."

"With all the excitement over the WestyV12, it was a good time to try this on draft and I found a new favorite. This has the power of an ancient Quad, the wine fruit scent and the deep dark earthy tastes that just gets better as it warms up. My new all time best beer of any style, could drink this exclusively if suddenly the rest of the world forgot all their beer recipes and all you could drink was this. Sorry I cannot include more descriptive terms, like steak, mushrooms and biscuits, but if you get the idea that this beer is awesome I have said enough."

""
""
"Top 3 beer ive ever had, hands down."
""
"I swore I'd reviewed this one in the past but apparently not, I'm curious what this tasted like a couple years ago, I don't think I'd age this one beyond this point, drink em if you got em"
""

""
""
""
""

"Thanks to merc7186 for this one!"
""
""

""
""
"O: A solid beer, if not as good as it's brother. Worth a shot, but I'm not sure if this is better fresh."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Very nice. Drinks way too easy for what should be a big sipper!"
""
""
"This is as smooth a quad as you will ever be able to find. I'm letting it warm up a bit to see if some additional character comes out on it, but there are some matured wood tones with the calvados peeking through. Well, sometimes it seems a bit more than just peeking through. Apple tones can be there pretty clearly. This is as easy-drinking for a quad as it's gonna get. A real nice production."
""
"Overall, so glad to have another to sip later; I'm amassing a vertical and this shaped up to be the early favorite."
""
""
"O: Of the three, this was - hands down - my favorite. The beauty and depth of this beer is unique, wonderful, and amazing. Age has down wonders to this beer and I think it will get better in due time. Nice work Urbain - bravo!"
""
"O- This was a very good beer with lots of complexity. There was so much going on in this that it was hard to distinguish all of the different aromas and tastes. With all the complexity it still was very well balanced and drank very easily. One of my favorite Belgians I've had to date. Definitely recommend trying it. Now I wish I could compare it to the other Pannepots."
""
""
""
""
"O - a very nice quad. Wonderful cherry flavors that are mixed with some good chocolate. Smooth and beautiful."
"Simply superb."
"I have had this one once before. For me a truly amazing quad. I really enjoy the subtle acidic quality that the barrel aging has given this one, especially as it pairs with the dark fruit flavors of the original pannepot."
""
""
""
""
"O-- Has held up quite well. Happy to have one other to drink. Slowly getting back into quads and this helps the cause a lot. Well hidden alcohol and just a well balanced beer"
"O: A wonderful quad, I'm glad I bought multiples of this, as it is really a special beer. Glad to get to try it!"

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. 2008 vintage. Deep dark brown, nearly black pour with one finger tan head with minimal retention, but nice lacing. Somewhat subdued nose initially, but it comes alive as it warms. Very complex and dominated by dark fruit with hints of cherry, vanilla, caramel, and oak, with just a touch of chocolate. The taste is complex as well but definitely dominated by the wood. Hints of dark fruit, specifically figs, cherry, tobacco, brown sugar, espresso, vanilla, and just a bit of cinnamon and chocolate. It has a subtle vinous character to it and tons of wood with a perfect amount of sweetness. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, but very smooth and surprisingly drinkable for a 10% beer. This is definitely my favorite Pannepot and yet another winner from De Struise! A great beer for those who love them aged in wood!"
"O: Tasty quad, much like the other variations. I feel this is the worst of the bunch though, not as good as the reserva, which isn't as good as the normal one. A little too much oak, a little too boozy compared to the others. Not bad by any means of course. Once it warms up fully, I swear it becomes a different beer. I had to adjust my taste score to a 4.5. The cocoa comes out and it just balances perfectly warm. Interesting. Might have to re-test the regular and reserva versions now."
"O: I loved the Pannepot 2011 and 2007 I've had, and this was every bit as good as I'd hoped."
"TIP: When opening this reserve ale, I highly recommend thinking more wine than beer. This may help contribute to a better experience overall."
""
""
""
"The beer boasts a dark pour with a slight off white head. Dark fruits, some roast, candied sugar, Belgian yeasts are all noted for aromas. It smells very mellow and balanced. The taste is basically aged to perfection. Balanced and mellow, this beer focuses on roast and mellowed booze. Very sweet with candied sugar and caramel all blending together perfectly. It's so smooth, no harsh booze, no misplaced flavors, just delicious and wonderfully drinkable. Best beer of the night by far. My god it was good."
"O: This beer *really* became special right around room temperature. The flavor and mouthfeel in particular. While I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, I was hoping for a little more. The taste gained a half point during the second half of the glass, which had a pretty profound impact on its rating (went from 4.0 to 4.23)."
"Overall, I like this quad I appreciate the fruity flavours but I've had better quads. I'd love to pick up a normal Pannepot to compare ti with though."
""
"2008 vintage. 33cl into Struise tulip. 16/8/16.  Dark dark ruby, beige head. Medium retention. More carbonation than expected. Aroma of vanilla, coffee, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate. Taste. Insane. Amazing. No alcohol at all, so smooth, great flavors that follow the aromas. Awesome, fantastic. Spectacular. One of the best. Ever. "
""
"o - overall, another winner...but for my tastes, i think i prefer the straight pannepot over the reservas...the grand reserva definitely adds layers of complexity to an already amazing beer. very brandy and sangria like. really well done beer. i've come to have high expectations on everything struise i try and i've yet to be dissappointed."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff, glad to have gotten a bottle. Alcohol becomes a little more prevalent as I work my way down the glass, detracts from drinkability a bit. Still good stuff, a nice sipper as it warms and the booze steps up."
""
""
""
""
"I was lucky enough to recieve this in Secret Santa '11. I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle, 2005 vintage, into a snifter, somewhat murky brown pour, moderate white head. The aroma has a ton of dark fruit, oak notes. The flavor is very similar to the aroma, oak more prevalent. The body is full, good carbonation, very smooth for a high abv brew. Great quad, the calvados barrels seemed to add oak, didn't really pick up brandy notes."
""

""
"33cl bottle courtesy of 2BDChicago. 2005 vintage served in my Ommegang tulip. Pours a murky plum-colored hue with a creamy, half inch, tan-colored head that eventually recedes into a consistent quarter inch cap. Creamy swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose expresses vinous notes, dark fruit, anise and nutmeg. Taste consistent with nose; however, the dark fruit character is much bolder than in the nose. There is also a suggestion of Belgian yeast in the flavor profile as well as some metallic notes towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant carbonation that falls just short of lively. Some residual alcohol heat also peaks out the finish. All and all, a very good Quad; however, I can't say that I really pick up any of the oak aging. That said, at the price point this beer comes in at, I would have to say that St. Bernardus Abt 12 is still the way to go."
"This was vintage 2005, has most probably peeked a while ago."
""
"Pannepot Grand Reserva 2005 goes in the glass a medium hue of brown with some tree bark like colors. The cap is real thin with dark tannish film like appearance. Smell is old dark fruit with plum being the focus. Faint sour apple with some faded roasted malt scent. Some port like quality with grape and small fig. Cant really pick up the barrel, this is an old bottle here. Taste is way left field at this point, perhaps past the point of no return. Dark fruit and some tartness has taken on effect. It's different and pleasant but not what im looking for in a quad. Plum and some apple with grape, sour grapes, Port like flavors, calvados. This is far off from a normal quad. Feel is a big medium and the carb is tame, yet this leaves a tart zing when sipped. I vastly preferred the Pannepot Reserva to this 'grand' version. Perhaps I should try another bottle of it."
""
"A beer with an extraordinary smell. Sadly, the taste feels a bit tired and old."
"4.0 D: Good beer, but I can't say that I think all the extra stuff has made the regular any better."
"Not sure anything will ever compare with 2006 Pannepot for me but this is still a nice beer. Spices sort of take over a bit too much as I go on."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"This is certainly a rich and robust Belgian ale. The oak certainly penetrates the beer and the malt character is very prominent too."
"Overall a nice one to find on tap. The Pannepot offerings never seem to disappoint."
"D - A magnificent brew. Not drastically different from Pannepot (although the Grand Reserva has a more noticeable sour edge from recollection), but that certainly isn't a bad thing."
"11/24/2011"
""
""
"Overall - Another excellent Struise brew.. definitely recommended..."
"O- A great beer that is very easy to enjoy. At first I thought the little tartness was oxidation, but on the second and third sip I was able to place it as tart fruits, not oxidation. I really hope I am able to stock up on this, very happy that I was able to find this."
""
""
""
"didn't quit knock my socks off, but it definitely impressed me. I was expecting more barrel qualities in the aroma and flavor, but it seems the quadruple aspects of the beer managed to take precedence."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice, dark appearance with a decent head. Nose is roasted, woody malt. Flavor has a hearty roasted coffee feel, with a bittersweet finish."
"O: The complexity is excellent and I imagine will become deeper in flavor as the beer temperature rises."
"Wow, quite disappointing. The regular Pannepot is one of my favorite beers and the Reserva is great as well, this really didn't do much for me. Flavor is way too faint."
"O - I really liked this beer, but not sure it's worth $10/bottle"
"O: I really like this a lot. The flavors have developed well over the last six years."
""
"Overall this beer was a nice and new experience for me. I usually do not like Belgian ales aged in barrels but the brandy barrels work here and add a new dynamic to the already amazing base Pannepot. Do I like it more than the original, I don't think so, but is it still heads and tail above 95% of Quads on the market, yes. Definitely recommended and well worth seeking out for Quad fans and fans of well-integrated barrel aged beers."
"Very good. I've never had a quad aged this much. It mellowed it and absorbed all sugar and focused the brew. Bitter, unrelenting brew, and for all of the hard flavors, I find this oddly drinkable. This is not for beginners (either in flavor or price). But very worthy."
"Very easy drinking for 10%."
"definatly one of the best quads ive had. such a nice melding of flavors, age has done this well. id be a little hesitant to buy more because of the huge price tag for one 11.2 oz bottle, but id be very interested to see what further cellaring could do."
""

""
"Note: 2005 Vintage"
""
""
"This beer was quite overpriced, but still tasty. I would have liked to grab a 4 pack of 3 philosophers and allow it to age a couple years instead. Worth tasting, and I grabbed a few for down the road... So we'll see what happens"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nearly perfect quad—pick this up if you can find it. This is a very complex beer; Belgian yeast, sugar and alcohol are all present. This beer is a sipper, but very easy to drink. I am glad we picked up a few of these in Belgium; I will hopefully get the chance to enjoy one or two more."
""
"Overall: Very smooth. A bit more bitter than I expected, but that wasn't a problem Very complex, would definitely have another."
""
"O. Overall very similar to the base beer as is Reserva. The base beer is very good so it is really hard to go wrong. I think the barrel aging adds subtle complexity and nuances to the flavor of Pannepot, which is really what is is supposed to do. I think I would have to say that I prefer Pannepot Reserva at this point. Next up is Pannepeut."
"Overall, this a good one that I would love to try again."
""
""
""
"O: This is yet another excellent take on Pannepot by De Struise Brouwers, and I hope to see more experiments like this from them in the future. Though this is not my favorite version of Pannepot, I would still recommend it highly to fans of barrel-aged beers and/or Belgian strong ales."
""
"D - this is a fantastic beer. Rich, complex, delicious. Being 6 years old, this still has a lot of unique character to it and I see it going even longer without too many problems. Recommended!"
"O: I think this beer is fantastic. There is a lot of complexity to this brew, and yet it feels subdued and simple. The flavors are spot on and the mouthfeel is just right. Color me extremely impressed. This is the best quad I've ever had."
"2005 vintage. Pours a one-finger light brown head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and alcohol nose and flavor is also alcohol, dark fruit and some oak, mellow sweetness. Very similar to Pannepot Reserva. Expensive at $11.49 for a 330ml (label claims this is a 750ml, I guess they ran out of 330ml labels) bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"O: A very smooth, complex and well integrated beer. This wasn’t my favorite quad, and I think the original might be better, but I would sip on this any day of the year."
"O - Good beer, nothing that's really setting it head and shoulders above the regular versions, but like them, it is very good."
""
"Overall, this is a very sophisticated quad, though still not my favourite. Still worth trying, and I might get another bottle in the future if my wallet allows."
"(D)- This has much much more life left in it for future aging despite being 6 years old or so. A solid to great quad that I think will only just get better and better with time based upon what is in the glass in front of me, though it is quite good now too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: I requested another and was dismayed to find that I had ordered the last one. I'd have grabbed another in a heartbeat, and now I'm on the trading warpath for it."
""
""
""
""
"(O) Very solid beer. I think for being 6 years old at this point it's quite superb. It's got a few layers of things going on but isn't too complex for the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is probably the best Quad I've ever had and certainly the most complex. While there are some aspects that I think maybe could be a little better, it's simply amazing as it is. I'd highly recommend getting a bottle if you ever have the chance."
""

"O- overall this is quite simply Amazing. One of the best Belgian beers I've had by far and felt it was way better than than the normal Pannepot"
"O: Trying this side-by-side with the regular was a very interesting experience. Both beers are excellent, but I'd give the slight edge to the regular due mainly to a slight edge in mouthfeel. I also feel like the sweetness of the Grand Reserva might make it tough to drink more than one bottle, where the regular Pannepot is just so easy to drink. Overall, however, I'm just nitpicking. Both are great beers."
"2005 Vintage. Had to finally try this one after thoroughly enjoying the standard and Reserva versions. It pours a dark cherrywood topped by finger of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises fig, brown sugar, toasted caramel, light oak, very light vanilla, dates, walnuts, dark fruit, very light cocoa, and a small touch of green apple. The taste holds notes of dark fruits, pear, oak, brown sugar, toffee, clove, light vanilla, and light white wine grapes. The fruitiness is a bit off-putting, particularly the sour-leaning pear and spicy grapes. The body is a straight medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, it's a solid beer, but I think the barrel-aging detracts significantly from the great base by introducing a number of new flavors that clash with the pre-existing ones. Still pretty good, though, interestingly..."
"Drinkability is really high.... but for my money, I'll take the regular version every time. The oaking adds some interesting aspects, but takes away a lot of those dark fruit notes and much of the sweetness that I love in the regular version."
"I prefer the Reserva, though this is a fine beer."
"jd"
"O-Not all I hoped it would be. You'd never know this was 6 years old. It seems the extensive barrel aging has stripped away Pannepot's nuances, leaving behind a perfectly average quadruppel."
"In sum, this is a denser, more rounded out version of the already good Pannepot. Worth $10 a bottle? Yes, at least once."
"It pours a muddied and syrupy dark brown, full bodied, with the look of creek water after a good rain. It looks great for the style. The aromas are big and malty. It's very bready and also features raisins, spiced rum, toffee, molasses, cloves, and sweet banana like esters. The flavors are heavy on raisin bread, toffee, smooth malts, molasses, and it finishes with a light yet boozy banana finish. It drinks very full and has a moderate amount of alcohol. It is also exceptionally smooth. Overall this is a fine quad with good complexity and well worth a try."
"This 2005 bottle came courtesy of Bermans in Lexington. Pannepot Grand Reserva pours out a dark chestnut color, with just a small amount of white heading. The first thing I get from the nose is brown bread, followed by chocolate, candy sugar, pepper and some stone fruit. The flavor is very jammy, with elements of plum, dark cherry and strawberry. The alcohol is held in check in an incredible way given the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is the standout here in that it is incredibly smooth and well rounded from first sip to last. I have had many versions of Pannepot over the years, and I have to say that none have impressed me in the way that this one does. It is so damn smooth and complex. It rivals any of the Trappist Quads out there, and surpasses some of them. Despite the steep price tag, this is one to hunt down. I would be interested to see what further aging will do to this beer, but it is drinking wonderfully right now."
"O- I like it better than pannepot, and that's saying something. Struise does it again. I will be going back for more bottles ASAP."
"Overall: What a tasty treat. It was quite the ordeal to get ahold of a few of these guys, but I am extremely happy that I did. Fans of Pannepot and/or quad lovers, this is a must try, and it has held up beautifully."
"O: It's hard to taste the aging here, it is pretty much your standard Belgian quad, not unlike Chimay Grand Reserve."
"O - A very good quadrupel, not as good as a Westvleteren 12 but definitely worth trying"
"Overall: Really nice stuff. A pleasure to try."
"I have to review this one cause i drank a 2005 bottle yesterday. Now this beer is about 8 years old and it just becomes better and better. Wow!"
"O - This beer was amazing. Certainly the best quad I have ever had. I drank a 2008 reserva last night and found the earthy raw oak notes to be a bit distracting. This perfected that fault. The barrel notes are so smooth and delicate and do not over power whatsoever. My favorite pannepot variation for sure."
"O - This was extremely sweet - to the point that I could not finish it. It was enjoyable for about a third of the glass and then became too much for me to drink."
"A very, very nice beer. The oak barrels really leave their mark, and it works very well. Has quite a different taste than the classic quads, but is an excellent beer. However, I do find that it is a bit rich- hard even to finish a regular bottle of."
"Overall: Incredible, glad to have more in the cellar. I’m looking forward to trying later vintages because this 2005 is going to be very tough to beat."
"Overall: Fantastic brew. Quite a bit different from the 2005 version I had some weeks ago though (that one had much more red fruits in the taste). What an amazing brew, leaving you to want more!"
"This is a brew that just wont quit, just when you think you got it nailed down and you picked up on everything it has to offer, it shows you more. There is a bunch of depth to this brew to savor and enjoy. The alcohol is initially well balanced and countered by the residual sugar, but as it warms up it gets a bit boozy and the 10% abv is wide out in the open and not hidden at all. This is medium to full bodied leaning more towards full than medium. It's light to moderate carbonation is perfect to give some bubbly life to this brew but not distract from the deep rich flavors. This is a fantastic sipper, among the best I have had not only from struise but across the board in the quad category."
"Poured dark reddish/brown color with an average light brown frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Medium to heavy complex dark fruit, wood, caramel and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy complex sweet flavor with medium to heavy fruity sweet finish and a small bite of alcohol. Standout brew."
"O: Compared to my first pass of the 2005 this one was a home run. It is evident that there is considerable bottle variation among these brews, but I guess that comes with the territory. The 2005 is still drinking fabulously, seek this out."
"O: Definitely good, but I still find it very hard to top regular Pannepot or the Reserva."
"B"
"OVERALL: Despite the questionable and worrisome beginning, this was phenomenal. Unlike the Reserva, the aging on the Grand Reserva did not mute the spicy wonders that make the base Pannepot so enjoyable. Instead, the aging has left slight nuances of oak and vanilla throughout that really do compliment the brew. Wonderful nose, flavors, and a beautifully creamy palate that plays the supporting role perfectly. A classic example of an oak aged brew. Well done gentlemen."
"O - Again, solid beer in a vaccuum, but in the company of these other beers, the Grand Reserva ended up #6 of 10. I'd still go out of my way to drink this again as it was delicious."
"Age has obviously done wonders for this. 2005 bottle, alcohol is super soft and the beer goes down really creamy. Very nice."
"Overall tasty. Was kinda disappointed but not bad."
"O: Excellent as expected"
"I was happy to find this as I'm on a work trip in Calgary. I've seen the Pannepot name floating around the site and knew it had to be good. I concur, this is quite tasty."
"There's a great tart green apple flavor on the tongue, sweet red wine, brown sugar, dates - very fruity, oaky, earthy - not necessarily sweet or dry. The mid-palate is buttery, velvety, the finish shows coffee and fig, tart red grapes. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"O: A quality, yet somewhat unique quad. The barrel aging separates this beer from the pack somewhat."
"o - A nice quad, but I think this one is my least favorite of the three Pannepot beers. Little too much raisins/figs in the taste and I think the extra time in the barrels muted some of the other smells and flavors. Would like to have again as I heard a new batch is coming out, but considering this is the toughest one for me to get, I'd rather just buy the normal Pannepot off the shelves."
"I have tried Pannepot - Old Fisherman's Ale and now Pannepot Grand Reserva and I cannot say that I was enamored by either of them. Between the somewhat muted flavor profile and the excessive carbonation, this beer simply did not do much for me."
"This just feels like a simmering time bomb, the alcohol in there somewhere, strategizing, scheming beneath the enjoyable barrel-informed fruity malt. Incredibly tasty, subdued, and maybe a little dangerous. Sublimely easy to drink, at least for this one bottle - as that 20-proof ABV would make itself known eventually."
"May have caught this bottle a bit past it's prime, but it's still a complex and pleasurable beer. Glad to have had the opportunity to savor this rarity."
"About half way through my Quadrupel marathon and here's the ordered ranking thus far, starting from the best: 2006 Pannepot Grand Reserva, 2007 Pannepot Reserva, 2006 Pannepot, 2010 La Trappe Quadrupel Oak Aged, 2009 La Trappe Quadrupel, 2009 Ommegang Three Philosophers"
"Drinkability: A pretty exceptional beer, and one I'm glad I held on to as long as I did, though I am fascinated by the thought of what this might have tasted like with only a year or two of age on it - would it have been sweeter? Less tart? Hotter? Who knows, and I'll likely never have the opportunity to know. Pannepot Grand Reserva is a good beer, indeed the most wine-like beer I've ever had, so I'll leave it at - if you like wine and you like beer, seek this one out."
"A pretty simple quad. Nothing really going on too much in this bottle..Looking forward to trying again sometime though, something must be off with some of these bottles."
"Poured from 750ml bottle (Vintage 2005) into a tulip glass. Pours cloudy dark/ruby-brown with a small, rocky, light brown head, somewhat lasting with fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, toffee), average hops (flowers, herbs), average yeast (horse blanket, earth, leaves) with notes of dates, vanilla, and cinnamon. Picked up alcohol smells as well. Taste of Beligan candy, bittwer sweet, oak, and champagne flavor. Full bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness. Too much of a barley wine / champagne beer for me. I gave it a name, ""The Dark Champagne of Beers""."
"12 oz. bottle, thanks Brad! Deep mahogany pour with really nice creamy lacing. Initial blast of single malt scotch whiskey. Toffee comes in quite a bit as it warms. Creamy and rich. A booziness can easily be detected from the get-go. The biggest weakness here is a strange astringent bitterness around the edges, which comes off as almost sour and simply doesn't belong in this brew. It's really rich, creamy, has a lot of nice components, but certainly didn't all seem to come together right. Not as good as the normal Pannepot."
"Outstanding beer, and getting more complex as it warms. I can't get enough of the Struise Pannepot offerings. Can't have enough of this in the cellar."
"D - This is a good beer, rich and complex. Rather easy drinking with a nice balance of flavors."
"Taste is a bit oaky/woody. There's raisins, sweet caramel malt and some sharp carbonation. There's lots of rich malts, a bit of dark chocolate, it's quite creamy and smooth with a fairly good mouthfeel. You get a tingling on your tongue afterwards from the alcohol and the sweet malts. It is strong and complex, but fairly easy drinking."
"Overall: A good beer, but if I were to introduce someone to this style, I would probably go with something else. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"So, my biggest criticism of this beer is that I can't taste the oak, it says on the bottle that its oak aged but there is no real vanilla or tannic character, it is however good tasting. Its sweet, malty, no alcohol really, mildly spicy in the midpalate, some plums and mild raisins. Very good."
"This beer appears a dark brown color. There is an off white / tan head that fades to about 1/4 inch and holds. Spotty lacing encompasses the circumference of the tulip glass. The aroma is of an authentic Belgian quad: yeasty, bready, enticing. The taste is incredibly smooth and delicious. Five years of age on a well crafted quad does some wonderful things. There is a slight hint of alcohol in the finish, but it only serves to add a warming sensation to the finish, enhancing, not distracting from the overall taste profile. What a great beer. I'm glad to have sampled it."
"It is incredibly drinkable. This beer could do a lot of damage; it tastes and feels nothing like I expect a 10% ABV beer to be. I'm a little glad it is so rare, as otherwise I would drink it all the time. I do wish I had a second pour before I left Lovell."
"This is an exceptional beer; easily one of the best."
"D - Not a beer that you have more than one of in a session. Heavy, filling beer."
"Notes: Vintage 2005. Pretty good beer, but I'm not entirely sure if the aging in the Calvados really made an improvement to either the normal Pannepot or the Reserva as it detracts a bit from the enjoyable flavors in those two. It does add a little something different though. This is another great beer from a great brewery, and worth trying, but I don't really feel like I need to have it again if I can get other Pannepot offerings."
"This is another excellent beer from Struise - a big complex quad with an intriguing barrel presence - lots of oaky tannins."
"Notes: My second favorite of the three expressions tasted. The acidity balances things out in a more proper way than the alcohol of the Pannepot. But conversely, there's less residual sugar which makes me prefer the Pannepot. It's a conundrum, indeed. Excellently crafted though. Really a shining example."
"Drinkability shouldn't be high, but it is immense. It just goes down so smoothly and tastes so full and delicious. So glad I got to try this one."
"D: Drinks nicely but the rotten fruit/sourness is very distracting."
"a real masterpiece , this is not only beer , this is pure art"
"This is pretty good, but I was hoping for a little more. The tart flavor held me back a bit to be honest. This is what happens sometimes when drinking an aged beer."
"I would say without hesitation the Struise Pannepot is one of the most finely crafted beers I know of and that it serves not only as perhaps the finest example of its style but also as physical testament to the artistry that defines the Belgian brewing tradition at large. This version of it is a beer that, to quote Harold McGee, ""touches the mind not with release from the world, but with a heightened attentiveness and connection to it."""
"pour is a mahogany with a brilliant head. when the bartender popped it came in a rush. pour was about 3 fingers of head. a very intense nose. belgian yeast, beligian cane, figs, molasses, and toasted almonds and port wine. palate was all that with a intense amount of volume a mild sour quality that i've only tasted in the De Rocs grand cru. i really like De Roc. and this beer seems like a higher gravity of that beer. also seemed a bit too sweet... to the point that i hid the other flavors and even the alcohol like a brick. expect they're different styles. quite dense and complex as the beer expands on the palate. wonderful feel. it goes down a smooth sipper. excellent end of the night beer."
"Oh yeah.... 2005 from the big bottle. Rich brown with swirly head. Moderate aroma of malts and slight alcohol. Sweet malt flavors with some bitterness, spices, funkiness. A little more complex than the regular Pannepot... tasty, rich ...Very nice overall."
"A very easy drinking brew, for a quad. I truly believe that the five year vintage has really changed the characteristic of the beer. The best beer store in town has a lot of these sitting on a shelf but at $11.00 dollars for a 330ml bottle, it's a bit pricey."
"D - Big flavors make this one a sipper, but these big malty Belgian beers are among my favorites. Great overall beer."
"O: A good example of a strong belgian ale. The apple aroma is a good touch. I couldn't really pull out the oak aroma out of this beer. Perhaps lost over the maturation of this beer. I would not age this beer for more than 2 years due to loss of key belgian flavors in this sample."
"Drinkability is sadly awesome. The best quad I've ever had, of course it's a super rare brew that's 5 years old...hopefully they'll make more again! The label (from the Ontario importer Roland + Russell) claims it's limited to 30 Hl / 2 years. That's not a lot, but it implies they at least intended to rerelease it...but the fact is, it's hard to get (I saw it going for over $100 a bottle at some beer bar in the Bay area after I traded for it, although I doubt they really sell it at that price), which hurts the score a bit, even if I'm in love at the first whiff..."
"What a great beer. The very definition of artisinal beer. Thank you De Struise."
"Overall, this was a great beer. But I preferred the regular version better."
"D: Very drinkable delicious. Love pretty much everything that Struise does."
"Full, creamy body has a nice vinous finish. Another truly artisinal ale from Urbain."
"Overall, I didn't have great expectations because although I like pannepot I don't think its on par with trappists. However, after drinking this it clearly is deserved in such praise. Great beer."
"Time is treating this one well. Glad I have another 750ml in the cellar still!"
"Out of a vintage 2006 bottle this beer was a dark, burgundy color with two fingers of beige head that retained well and left rings of lacing down my glass. The aroma was of dark fruits, roasted malt, toasted malt, sour apples (from the French Oak barrels) and spices. The flavors were complex and highly advanced. I hate to sound pretentious, but this would roll right over a pedestrian beer drinker. I tasted the French oak, an array of malts, plums, raisins, simple syrup, brown sugar, port wine, buttery bread and alcohol on the finish. There was so much going on and the elements were so well blended it was difficult to discern the spices but this impressive montage of flavors was reflective of how well executed the beer was. My only complaint was the French oak plus Calvados that the beer was aged in came through so strongly, especially as it warmed up, that it suppressed some of the more subtle elements. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation medium."
"D - Masterfully hidden ABV in the taste. However, dispite it's pluses, this is never going to be a session brew. It's a complex sipper that needs to be pondered. I'm not sure if it's better than the other Pannepot variants, but it's definitely excellent and worth trying."
"Another great beer by one of my new favorite breweries. Pours dark burgundy with mild carbonation. Nose is a deep vanilla, notes of rum, chocolate, and burnt malts. Hints of lavender and I detected a small amount of nice yeasty funk at the beginning. Oak/vanilla elements dominate the palette, with mild sweetness and bitterness, and a very slight tartness. No detectable Belgian yeast phenols, though there may be a slight kiss of Brettanomyces. Is this really a quadrupel?: tastes more like an oak aged stout/porter."
"3 way blind taste test alongside westvleteren 8 and pannepot reserva 2006. Nice dark appearance with little head. Fruity, ripe cherry aroma and some alcohol, maybe a bit of oak. Taste is very bold, ripe and fruity. Good alcohol presence, again a beautiful palate."
"D: Excellent brew, to be sought after."
"Apparently it was aged in French Calvados oak... I liked Biergotter's better."
"D: its 10% is like a joke, when you taste it. Maybe too powerful to drink it too often, but when you have it in front of you, it's impossible to stop drinking it."
"This is terrific. Rich, sumptuous and yet somehow drinkable, not a hint of the ABV, goes down way too easy. Thanks Rob!"
"Pours a ruddy brown with a creamy tan head, which eventually fades to a wispy covering. The aroma contains raisin, brown sugar and spice. The body is as you would expect - medium carb and weight. Raisins also come through strong in the flavour, as well as there non-dried, still on the vine counterparts. Beyond this there's layers of toffee, brown sugar and red wine. Its certainly a very juicy quad, perhaps too much so, and I have yet to be really impressed by De Struise."
"My last bottle of the 05 vintage. Spicy, fruity, cola sweetness, red wine, calvados, sherry. red wine and calvados are noticeable. The palate has a mild sherry like tartness and tannin bite. Fruity, vinous and a little yeasty, age has transformed this beer. Minimal sweetness, balanced by acidity and tannins. Booze is wonderfully hidden. 4.25/4/4.25"
"Not sure extended barrel aging has helped this beer out, as I think I like the base beer version better. Nevertheless, this is still a very fine beer from De Struise."
"Overall, damn this is one fine variation of a quad. Wish I had a couple more bottles stowed away in my cellar. Thanks again Eric."
"I would have to do a side-by-side to really be able to make a judgement call, but based on memory I have found the Pannepot, Pannepot Reserva, and Pannepot Grand Reserva to all be relatively equal and world class brews. They all have their own strengths and their own weaknesses, but all are amazing."
"D - This beer is intense, but it's so damn good it keeps you wanting more. Overall, this beer was absolutely legen...wait for it...DARY!"
"Overall what a night for me. This and Delphine back to back. I was blown away by both. The pannepot is good for me, but this is great, it really just came together damn near perfect for me. I would love to have this again any day, maybe age it for a year or two more."
"D - For the style, very."
"I didn't much care for the regular Pannepot, but this is a completely different beast. Tart grape/ plum reminds me of the essence of grape soda (without the cloying sugary sweet character). The oak is well integrated into the overall flavour of the beer, and just adds to the complexity instead of screaming ""OAK."" I'm glad I got the chance to try this, as it really is outstanding, but the price point (about $14 per 330ml bottle in Alberta) seems a tad excessive."
"Aging an outstanding quadrupel in Calvados barrels sounds like a good idea, but it didn't contribute anything worthwhile in the end. I don't care whether or not Grand Reserva is brewed again, as long as De Struise Brouwers continues to provide us with the standard Pannepot Fisherman's Ale. Thanks to biegaman for the bottle."
"the oak aging seems to give some interesting complexities, but loses some of the robustness of flavor the original pannepot has."
"If you can't choose between beer and wine grab this one. It's best of both worlds."
"A great brew. Like the picture on this site (above), mine was a 2005 vintage, so it would have been four years old, I suppose, when I drank it. The time blended and mellowed the flavors to make me extremely sad that I didn't buy two (or more!) of these back in 2007, I think it was."
"D: A great beer. Packed with strong and bold flavors. Maybe it could have been a little more balanced. Nonetheless, highly recommended."
"D: As a professed lover of the Pannepot brews, this one was a must for me. Had many of the elements of the quadrupels of theirs I've enjoyed, though the muddled medley of flavors here didn'y make me a convert to this over the 'regular' Pannepot. Still, I'd never turn one down - again, big thanks to Paul for sharing this treat."
"Drinkability- I personally liked the regular version of Pannepot better, but this is still pretty good. If not for the metallic note, it would be right up there with some of the better ones."
"A rather anti-climactic quad when all is said and done, hopefully it ages well and things come together a bit more over the years."
"It is a very good beer, but still inferior to regular pannepot. Better than reserva."
"Amber red color with a tan head that quickly dissipates to a ring around the glass. Smell is of green apple, spices, and some wood. Taste consists of caramel, toffee, spices, clove, but this is also very metallic; even moreso than the regular reserva. Light bodied with a rather high carbonation. I'd try this again, but I don't know that I'd seek it out. It seems like I'd just stick with regular Pannepot over any of the reservas. Thanks to pepsican for the sample."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with raisins, and brown sugar clinging to the palate, making for a sweet but delicious beer."
"For the money I'd stick with the regular Pannepot, but this is another fantastic brew and well worth trying."
"Dark brown with some reddish highlights, a moderate pour produced a fluffy beige cap. Excellent head retention, with two fingers of foam settling to a finger's worth over several minutes, leaving behind some chunky, clinging lace. A thin cap lingered right through to the bottom of the glass. Big dried fruit aroma, mostly raisins, with some earthy prune skin and figs. Lots of malt too, rich and sweet, with notes of molasses and toffee dominating, along with cake and dough in the background. Kind of smells like fruitcake, but much better than that, with a hint of boozy rum. Wood character was quite subdued, but there was a bit of vanilla in there. Very fruity flavour too, again with the dried fruits mentioned above, but with more of a fresh plum character. Alcohol was more pronouned than in the aroma, as were mellow oak tannins. Alcohol was a little spicy in the finish and vanilla appeared here as well. Lots of sweetness, but just a little of that was from brown sugar and toffee flavours, more from the fruit department. Finished with a bit of cherry sourness. Pretty tasty. Medium to full bodied with creamy, lowish carbonation, just a bit of astringent dryness and plenty of warmth. Really quite good and pretty drinkable for a big beer."
"Dark brown with a small ruby head and tight carbonation. Aromas of various spices and heavy duty German style maltings. Star anise, fennel, and licorice come to my mind, and upon first sip they also hit my palate. Kinda chocolate-y yet not really.. there is some Cinnamon flavors in here as well. Mouthfeel is creamy, but not too thick or over the top. Drinkability is good, but I could not drink this one all night as the spices would definately get to me after awhile. This is more rounded, less spicy, and more drinkable than the regular version"
"Mad props to Northyorksammy for the hookup!"
"Pours a very nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice little tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behing. The nose is malty, with some plums, raisins, figs. The taste is malty, some dark fruits, oaky. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, highly recommended. Thanks Eric."
"Bottom line: This is damn good stuff!"
"There is so much going on with Pannepot Grand Reserva but it blends very well."
"This seems to be just getting in to its own right now and this, the 2005, vintage probably still has quite a long way before it starts deteriorating; the best by date of 2012 is definitely not a joke. I am really enjoying this beer. The oak character is very soft, which is nice, with the biggest influence being the rum / brandy notes picked up from the calvados cask. This is a very good beer, one which I easily wish I had more than 330ml of; my bottle is gone way to fast leaving me really wishing that I had more. If I could make this better I would add a touch more tartness, the lactic note that is here is quite soft and there is lots of fruit and malt character that could easily balance out a touch more sourness."
"This is my favourite beer from Belgium until this date, beating the Rochefort 10."
"Wonderful! I'd really like to lay my hands on a few more of these."
"Drinkability: Yes, very good drinkability."
"Case from Roland and Russell. Pours dark colour with dark red highlights and lots of lace, off-white head. Aroma: sherry, ok, manipulated yeast, rich. Mouthfeel is on creamy side, it tastes creamy and a bit sour and oaked, and finishes magnificantly satisfying. Deep and soulful. One of the year's best I have had from 600 beers."
"Pours a muddy dark reddish brown, huge and thick light tan head forms, quickly settles itself down into a thick ring, some spiral lacing on the glass, pretty nice. Smell is rad, very oaky, white wine/chardonnay buttery oak, caramel, fruit, figs, bread, light chocolate roast, grapey/red wine type of aroma, crazy, really neat. Taste is intense, tons of fruit, wood, wine, caramel, butter, bread, tart and earthy, red wine, cherries, alcohol comes through in finish, bites the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Wood is insane in this, and I'm not sure to think. Maybe my palate isn't 100% but I can't say I'm too impressed. I'll re-review later."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown/burgundy color ale with a super large foamy head with some exceptional retention and great lacing. Aroma of apple is easily distinguishable with some oak notes and light candi sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by the calvados notes with some oak notes and a nice lightly sweet malt base. Great carbonation with a full body and no discernable alcohol notes. Very well done overall but I still think I prefer the original Pannepot and maybe the oak-aged/calvados-aged has replace some of the complexity of the original beer."
"Sampled at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà in Roma and then again at Monk's Cafe in Stockholm. I was underwhelmed both times. Mostly I failed to see how the wood had that big of an influence on the beer. Lately, I have been drinking a lot of regular Pannepot 2006 (nearly 2 years old, its amazing.) That beer has more complexity to me than the Grand Reserva. So yes, this was a tasty beer, but I expected more oak character."
"Pours a dark murky brown in color, some chunkiness, a good sized medium tan head slowly fades with a little lacing. Aroma is bready with a little spice, some sweet raisins, and some slightly tart smelling cherry. Taste follows this well with the breadiness mixing with the raisin and dark fruit sweetness up front, a small amount of the slightly tart cherry and apple comes in mid taste and blends well with some spices and a good woody flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body, decent spiciness mid taste to the finish cuts through the maltiness and leads into a good dryness, a small amount of alcohol warmth at the back of the throat in the finish. Very nice beer, the wood ageing has worked well with the flavors and especially the feel"
"Beer poured a block hole like color, dense, with a tan head, bubbley. The aroma is pleasing to the nose. Oaky, toasted malt yet a bit sweet. Dried fruits in the aroma a bit. The taste is complex to say the least. Up front there are potent spicy notes, banana, corriander maybe, some dried fruits and definite oak tones. The high abv is a bit hidden by the complex flavors but you can still feel it on the back end. A very full bodied beer and definitely worth the wait to try it."
"Drinkability: Quite nice! A superb creation. Can I take away PBR's blue ribbon and give it to this beer?"
"Pours a deep brown root beer like color with above average head, and above average lacing and carbonation. Bittersweet oaky malt smell. Tastes a little lighter than the aroma or ABV would indicate. Has a nice malt backbone. Finishes well and tastes like it is bottle conditioned. A very good beer!"
"A Top 10 beer."
"Overall a very good beer, but not quite as wonderful as the standard Pannepot"
