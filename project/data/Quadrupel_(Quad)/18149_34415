4.07,4.1,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall: Think of this less as a Belgian quad and more of an American-style quad, reinforced by the addition of raisins. In that sense, it holds its own. While it may not be at the top of the list for American quads, I have to imagine it's somewhere in the top five. It's clear that Lost and Found is this beer's antecedent.","elektrikjester","Mar 11, 2015"

3.82,-2.3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. It was hard to peg this tape-wrapped bottle. Dark red-brown in body with a small tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring. Some spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is raisins, figs, plums, chocolate malt, yeast, and alcohol. Taste is strong dark fruit and caramel malt sweetness with a touch of cherry, light cocoa and spice bitterness, and alcohol on the swallow. Medium-plus body, syrupy thick texture, average to soft carbonation, alcohol and spice finish. I have read that newer bottles may be too carbonated, but think this bottle was aged some, so that may have affected the profile. I quite enjoyed this style-bending quad.","SierraFlight","Feb 17, 2015"

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dark khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome quadrupel style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 21, 2014"

Drinking from a tulip glass (Frog and Onion Pub, Bermuda) filled from a corked 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounce bottle. The predominant taste that comes to the front is molasses with raisins and a warming alcohol feel. The bottle should be shared as the APVis listed at 10.5% APV. My best description of this taste is toasted molasses, a very nice winter brew, satisfying that need for a filling satisfying brew. Certainly one worth tasting, savoring, enjoying. The taste is smooth to the tongue and warming. A beer worth trying!","micalj","Apr 12, 2014"

3.92,0.3,4.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O - The Lost Abbey's Judgement Day quad is a rich and robust beer that's filled with Belgian yeast complexity but at the end of the day, it's clearly an American-brewed dark Belgian-style beer. The addition of raisins is a nice touch (though they seem to practice this with some frequency) but it seems to me, achieving the aroma and flavor of raisins in a beer like this is a job for the yeast, not the grape grower. And while my biggest dissatisfaction, if you would call it that, is the overuse of heavily roasted malt, I think Judgement Day is a damn fine beer, just unique in it's own right.","BeerFMAndy","Beers"

3.87,-1,4.25,3.5,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours a deep mahogany with maroon highlights with a rocky, light tan head of sudsy bubbles. The head sits about a finger’s width above the glass with nice lasting power. In body, the beer is deep and dark, nearly opaque, but seems to be clear of particles. On the nose, the beer of rich raisins, tart plums, and soft brown sugar and caramel malt. Touches of spicy clove and even a hint of banana esters touch upon the nose. There is even a touch of smooth breadiness and warming alcohol waft over the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy sweet with lots of fruity esters. The alcohol is very aggressive at the start of the sip but does mellow into the rest of the beer as the sip continues. Soft acidity play off the esters of the beer in the middle of the sip, but only a touch of bitter hops do touch the tongue. In flavor, the beer begins as hot, stale, spicy alcohol that mellows into sweet raisins, phenolic clove, bananas, and unripe plums with a touch of tartness. The finish brings forward bitter herbs with soft astringency, and a touch more hot booze, caramel, and more raisins. The aftertaste is soft bread and raisins in brown sugar. Stale green apple flavors hit the mouth throughout sip, and what feels like herbal tannins also make an appearance occasionally in the sip. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied. Carbonation is of middling strength, but the mouthfeel is velvety, smooth with a little harshness from the alcohol. Overall, this is a nice quad/Belgian strong ale that could use a little more time in the cellar. The alcoholic heat is a bit much and takes away from the rest of the beer. Flavors are rich, and the raisin is very dominant in the taste, but I want more of the phenols and esters from the yeast. The nose is also a bit weak in terms of the flavoring of the rest of the beer. This is a good beer that should be cellared for optimum flavoring.","Maxwell","Jan 10, 2014"

The aroma was that of malt and dark fruit. In the initial taste, one gets a high level of dark fruit such as raisin, prunes, and dates. Even before identifying the initial taste, one notices the warmth on this one. Dark fruit are heavily involved. Burnt malt, molasses, and dark chocolate notes are also present. The malts become more noticeable in the aftertaste. The warming sensation continues throughout each seem.

I wanted to give this beer a shot before I try the Cuvee de Tomme seeing as this is the base beer for that recipe. If you can get this bottle for ten and under it's definitely worth a try. Seeing as some have payed up to twenty and over for the 750ml I would advise against that. This shouldn't be over ten dollars.","Jsenay","Jul 11, 2012"

While neither can really compete with true Belgian Quads, both breweries did a pretty damn good job of not destroying the style, in fact I'd have to say they both made progress of being truer to style than most. While I do chose Weyerbacher Blasphemy as the victor, it has had the advantage of having a bit of aging on it at the brewery letting the beer mellow out and become a bit more complex. If I recall, while weyerbacher quad was very good, it was a little sloppier than it's barrel aged counter part. Good show by both breweries though, I enjoyed them both.","jtierney89","0"

Aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), peppery spice, molasses and some bready malt. It tastes like dark fruit (raisins, cherries, plums), molasses, caramel, bready malt and some chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated.

Nose has loads of dark fruit notes, some berries, rich chocolate notes and some brown sugar. Boozy vanilla notes too, but this only adds to the complexity of this. Taste is rich, boozy and caramel-ly dark fruits, lots of chocolate there too. Hints of brown sugar and vanilla as per the nose. Mouthfeel has a light and peppery carbonation initially, and melts over the tongue with a creamy and smooth texture. Subtle alcohol in the finish. An excellent quad, my second favourite on the day.

Shared this one with the Columbia Homebrew Club on our last stop during our tour of all things beer in Charleston on 'the bus'. Toasted to this one at 6PM on May 21, 2011 in celebration of the predicted Judgement Day. Served from bottle into a pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a one and a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raisins, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, raisins, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The raisins really made their presence known for sure and were quite enjoyable. They really mixed well with the roastiness going on here. The alcohol was just a touch and not overwhelming at all. If I could do it again, I would choose another beer to crack on Judgement Day, but this one just felt right.","thagr81us","0"

The beer has heavy flavors of dark malt and molasses, and is heavy sweet, even for a quadrupel. The molasses is also present on the finish, but is balanced out with some cinnamon tastes.

I am a very big fan of the dark fruit flavors of Lost Abbey and this beer did not disappoint, it had all the wonderful pieces I love. I felt the composition of this beer was slightly off base, due to the lack of carbonation, it did however have an incredibly smooth, velvet like feel which I enjoy thoroughly. Overall, I am a bit perplexed by this beer.

No much lacing on the Belgian tulip glass that I poured it in. No head and didn't expect much cabonation since it was classified as a Quad. There is chocolate overtone trying to fight through the strong nutty smell. The raisins didn't punch through for me.

But there are better examples from the other side of the pond that are equally, if not better priced.","ccrida","Aug 22, 2008"

Mouthfeel is thinner than I would expect and does not have the classic Belgian feel to it. Drinkability is good as it has quite the nice taste profile with a slight warming alcohol back burn.

Warm fruity aroma with notes of prune, brown sugar, spice, and alcohol. Nice roasted malt with a hint of milk chocolate initial flavor with light bitter aftertaste that is relatively long lived with an alcohol finish. This brew comes across almost as a strong stout/barley wine cross. It is full bodied with slightly syruppy feel that coats the side of your tongue and the back of your throat. The lively, almost fizzy carbonation keeps it ffrom feeling too heavy. Overall, this beer has a nice subtle aroma that is reliatively complex and pleasant.

4.2,7.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: The alcohol comes through a bit too much, taking away from some of the drinkability. Still, this is a well crafted and tasted beer that paired well with grilled tri-tip, steamed broccoli and herb roasted potatoes. The fruit flavors are rich and meaty and hold up very well to the sweetness and alcohol warmth. Drink it if you got it.","BrewMaster","Beers"

4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Thick glug pour, love that sound! Very dark fruit forward aroma. First sip I knew I was in for a treat. This has a definite raisin flavor. I taste only a slight resemblence to DFH raisin dextra, which is way sweeter. I like this more, it's balanced, complex and simply unique. Glad I have a few more to sit on and see how it matures!! So far, every beer I have had from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey has been outstanding.","ChazMania","Apr 14, 2007"

4.75,21.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Notes: 750ML bottle corked and caged. I have been in a Belgian Strong funk lately so to speak. This has revived my interest in the style. Not as sweet as most. This is complex and a 6 month spell in the cellar may be the key to perfection here.","DogFood11","Mar 26, 2007"

3.98,1.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"The taste is all of the above with a good strong helping of alcohol to warm you up. Complex, strong and did I mention sweet? It truly does taste quite delicious if you are accustomed too this style...if not, give it a try and you just might like it.","scottoale","0"
