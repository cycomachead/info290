"This is a really nicely done beer that has aged quite nicely. I don't know how it tastes fresh, but at 6 years old, it's quite tasty. Regular Pannepot is probably better, but I wouldn't kick this one out of bed."

"2010 bottle, reviewed Jan 2015.  No sign of oxidation whatsoever."
""
"O- as stated earlier, this one really outshines the 2009. Tasted very similar to St Bernardus' Abt 12. This is what I expect a Belgian Quad to taste like!"
"A very well aged hoe"
""
""
""
"Tried it alongside best quads (Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 10, St Bernardus 12 and La Trappe Q.) and it was very different. Smoke, chocolate, black berries - none of those is present in those quads. Not much of dried fruits, like in VW12, R10 and SB12. None of the honey and candies, like in La Trappe. More bitter. Also, much darker. I'd say it's something between BA Imp. Stout and Belgian strong dark ales. Very original beer, one of the best Belgian."
""
"Pours a black color.  1/5 inch head of an off-white color.  Decent retention and slight lacing.  Smells of European yeast, alcohol, sweet malt, hint of spice, hint of wood, hint of liquor, and a hint of pale malt.  Fits the style of a Quadrupel.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of European yeast, alcohol, sweet malt, hint of spice, hint of wood, hint of pale malt, and slight liquor.  Overall, weak appearance, complex aroma, complex body, but not well blended."
"2010 Vintage. Aged 5 years. Just impressive !"

"O-This is another really good De Struise beer. The Reserva, like their other BDSA/Quad style beers is a nice mix of traditional flavors that have been tweaked just a bit. The high point of this beer is the mouthfeel, which is damn near perfect. Really well made beer here."
"2009 Vintage. Aged 4 years"

""
""
""
"Overall very nice but not as great as two year old Pannepot."
""
"O-Overall this is great quad a must have. Hides the 10% very well. Must get some more."
""
""
""
"Vintage 2009. A little assertive and astringent. Slightly sour. Otherwise, rich and spicy and magnificent. Still. Would rather have normal Pannepot."

"Dense, not stout, but unexpected for a quad. Fitting, though."

"Overall:  Expecting a six year old beer to deliver was perhaps a bit much, in this instance, but I thought the beer was going to be far more expressive and impressive than it turned out to be"

"I can't believe how bright and alive this beer is for it's age. I liked the Pannepot 2011 despite its intense soy sauce flavor but this bottle knocks it out of the park for me. Every sip brings a wave of intense yet intricate flavors. The sherry flavors in particular are very interesting and enjoyable. Let this warm up a bit if you are taking it out of the fridge. I will look for more bottles of the Reserva. Can't wait to crack the Grand Reserva."

"Overall: Bam! This beer packs some enjoyment factor for me. This beer so far is my highlight of 2014. I should go back to Max's and get the 2005 Vintage. This brew is delicate and still takes you on a joy ride like it stole your neighbor's car. Belgian Strong Ales are one of my favorite styles of beer, and then age it in Oak Barrels? Yes, Please! This brew is Recommended."
""
""

"Dark ruby red to brown appearance. The nose is of sweet plums and cherries. The taste is very strong with dark malts, figs, plums, dried cherries, and a little smoke. Very smooth for an old. Overall very nice. It's definitely recommended."

"Snagged this bottle off a shelf at Dawson’s in Severna Park, hiding behind some other brews while home for the holidays. 2009 bottle poured to a Unibroue tulip on 1/9/14. The bottle says only 3,000 bottles of this made. Not a bad find! Pours a murky dark brownish purple with a small off white or khaki colored head. Beautiful aroma of plums, super ripe pears, raisins, tobacco, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, lots of beautiful mellow oak with a nice helping of booze that makes me almost think this was bourbon barrels. Flavor of raisins, plums, brown sugar, some warming booze, light cocoa, toffee, tobacco, and much more spice than would be expected from the aroma. The oak dries out the finish a bit and keeps this a very smooth and mellow brew despite the alcohol and spice present. The mouthfeel is heavy, like huge imperial stout heavy, and yet has low to medium carbonation. This was pretty freaking awesome."

"Loved every sip of it. I asked Urbain when he is going to brew this pannepeut again because i need a crate of this beer!! I will have to wait a while."
""
""
"I have had both the reserva and the regular releases for years. Both are of the same quality, generally, although the reserva has some deep, port-like flavors that have developed more than the regular. Both are world class quad's, right up there with the Trappist offerings."
""
""
"o: Decadent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not what I was expecting but damn tasty nonetheless. I'd heard this beer is rich and estery and sweet, appropriate for the time of year. This was much drier and ""lighter"" for the style, a ""drinkable"" Quadrupel."

"Bottom Line: World Class Quad!"

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of those beer that I not forget in a hurry. Pronounced balanced flavours, plenty of aroma just a little let down by the appearance. Recommended."
""
""
""
""

"M: Medium to full bodied."

"D: not too shabby. a full bodied brew with a good deal of flavor. very complex. the oak is present and adds one more dimension to regular pannepot."

"O- Not a cheap beer but a fantastic value. $8.50 a bottle? I may need to get more. The best quad I have had to date, simply fantastic stuff. If this is the Reserva, whats the Grand Reserva taste like?"
""
"O: Decent, but pretty disappointing. The only brew from De Struise this night that didn't wow me. Mayhaps the keg isn't in fantastic shape? This would probably be better if it were bottle conditioned, in fairness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A phenomenal beer. The flavor is so far off-the-charts I need new charts. I suppose it feels just a bit thin for all that flavor and I hate to compare every quad to those nice bottle-conditioned Trappist Ales, but this one did come off as a tad under-carbonated. Still, if you like quads and come across this one, you must pick it up. Expensive, but definitely worth a try. The flavor and complexity are simply unsurpassed."
""
"With !0% abv, this is one of the better quads, but the licorice flavor is overwhelming."

"O: I'd much prefer the base beer, the Monk's Ale or the Grand Reserva. Though this beer is very well rounded, it's almost got a wild element to it. Disappointed, I admit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overhyped, perhaps, but enjoyable and tasty, oh yeah."
""
""
""
"Pretty hot. Could use some aging to calm that down, but the flavor and aroma were more subtle than expected. Somewhat disappointing. Overrated, imo."
""
"Pannepot reserva has a lot of potential, the oak flavors really add a nice adjustment to the regular beer. The problem is the base beer seems weaker and less prominent. I think age is needed on this. A 2010 served 2013 perhaps a 5 year gap between the bottle date and tasting are needed here. A shame as I thought I'd like this more from the nose and the first sip."
""
""
"330 ml bottle into chalice, 2009 vintage. Pours murky dark reddish brown color with a small khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Minimal glass lacing with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toast, clove, pepper, oak, light roast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy notes with moderate oak presence. Taste of raisin, prune, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, clove, pepper, oak, brown bread, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, toffee, oak, clove, pepper, brown bread, light roast, and earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy flavors; with moderate oak presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic oak aged quadrupel. Big complexity and great balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"O: A very good oak-aged quad. Regular Pannepot is solid, and the oak rounds out some of the harshness that it can have. It could also be rounded out due to the age itself, but regardless, it is a bit more complex than the regular version which is saying quite a lot. Definitely worthy of a purchase, especially if you can find it for under $10"

"A well made beer thats easy to drink"
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm loving this one. Seems age does this 2009 version well. I'm already planning on finding more. A highly recommended try if you like quads and dark ales."
""
""
"Overall this is a great Quad from a great brewer. I really need to sample this, the original and the Grand Reserva at the same time because I really can't recall a great difference in flavor but a horizontal tasting will hopefully alleviate that. Probably my favorite (and decently available) brewery of the Quad style."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is what I love because it has such a creamy smooth character."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well it's Pannepot so it's still a great beer, but I guess I'm just disappointed that the oak seems to have cut out the great flavors instead of augmenting them."

"Perfectly dark with a half inch of off white head. Very nice retention and some nice spots of lacing. Aroma is light cocoa and prune. Flavor is a kinda hot with a lot of quad pruney notes with a touch of sherry. The roasty cocoa is a nice counterpoint to the quad character. I don't get a ton of oak, perhaps a touch of vanilla in the aftertaste but not a huge barrel character from the oak. Mid level carbonation with a bit of a bite. Maybe could up the body a bit."
"This was delectable. Pannepot is such a great beer and throwing it into a barrel is divine."
""
"From notes, 1/24/11. Excellent beer. Pours dark brown with a small-ish beige head. Combines Pannepot’s huge fruity, malty flavors with drying oak overtones. Raisins, plums, prunes, figs, dates, molasses, caramel, spice, sherry and wood. The taste is fairly sweet but ends with a dry oak flavor. Lush mouthfeel that, again, mostly dries out in the end. Just makes me hunger all the more for the Grande Reserva. Edit: I later tried this beer against the GR and, while my scores for this beer dropped slightly, I definitely preferred it to the GR, which was a bit disappointing."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"[O] For me, this is what a quad should be like - except that I would prefer a little more complexity on the nose and more duration on the flavor. I think a younger bottle would solve this, as well as the oxidation issue. Overall though, still a great experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I finally broke down and opened this 2008-dated bottle that I had stashed inside my kegerator for around three years. It pours from the bottle with a warm chestnut brown color that is light enough that the many floating specks of sediment are easily identified. A big, foamy beige head helps to redeem the appearance, though. The aroma is sadly a bit muted, but it does convey some nice notes of dark brown sugar and dried grains. The flavor is certainly more assertive, with moderately rich, dry toffee-like sweetness, some mild floral and dried herb characteristics, and some slightly tangy yeast. The medium body and light, fine carbonation do a very nice job lightening the profile without taking away substance. Overall, this isn't a standard setter for a Belgian quad and lacks the same dry, fruity depth of the best in this class, but it is mouth-pleasing and quite a bit more drinkable than it's 10% ABV would suggest."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. The time in the barrel allows the flavors to mellow out and blend together better than they do in regular Pannepot."
""
""
"O: Good stuff. A nearly 5-year-old beer that has held its carbonation quite well. It's a tad bit more sugary than I would like in order to give it a 5 in the taste category, but it's certainly deserving of just one notch lower."
""
""
"Overall this beer is about what you would expect if you are familiar with the style. A bit smoother than most (this being from 2008 helps that a bit I would imagine) in the genre. As with most quads and bsda's I can appreciate the complexity of the taste and can enjoy it as a slow sipper, but I just can't find that flavor note that makes me really fall in love with it the way I do a great IPA or IS. Then again, I paid $9 for 11.2 ounces of this, so maybe it's for the best."
""
"The dark fruits are a little too big and tangy for my tastes -- I prefer more of the deep malt flavors."
"What a nice treat. I can count on one hand the number of Quads I've tried, and this one crushes all of them. I may need to look further into this style."
"This is a great Belgium take overall."
""
""
""
"It does have some oak in the flavor, along with good doses of dates, raisins and figs. Mix in a touch of caramel and some hints of rummy brown bread And molasses next. It also has light touches of roasty bitterness. A tasty, well-made brew. Thnx, Thijs! Prosit!"
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! This brew flies sooo far under the radar it's not funny. Amazing Quad!"
""
"Overall a solid quad that hits all the right notes."
"While I enjoyed this beer, I feel thre are more complex quads out there to be had for cheaper or the same price. The chocolate male is just too dominating."
""
"Overall: A damn good quad. I like the oak, but I'm not sure its any better than the regular Pannepot."
"09 vintage totally not worth the hype. pours a clear caramel color with a red trace and a minimal white head that fades to nothing in seconds. the smell is just fine, sweet residual sugars from a big ass malt profile, a touch of molasses, and plento of booze. the flavor is a letdown to me though. it has none of the complexity im accustomed to in a quad. nothing woody about this, nothing spirited and clever in the malts used, and just way too much sugar and booze. this is not an elegant beer. the mouthfeel is flat and watered down, made caustic from the alcohol, which should have mellowed out by now. sticky sweet feeling left after the last sip, a funny buzz, and a turning tummy. this isnt anywhere near one of the best quads ive had. good beer by other standards maybe, or maybe my bottle was bunk, but this was a huge letdown for me."
""
""
"O-i think every sip i take, i taste something new and different. this beer is too complex to accurately review. so much is happening. so much is going on. its so drinkable. i'm not sure where the 10% is, because i can't taste it in this quad. simply put, best quad i've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: solid once again like the base beer and the barrel aging worked it's magic."
""
""
""
"This is medium bodied, with smooth carbonation. This is a real treat. I like Pannepot alright, but this is definitely a step up."
"Overall a great beer, I really like what the oak did to this beer. Now I just need to try the normal version! My second beer from this brewery and again this is very good. I will look out for more of their beers!"
""
"Pretty fun drink, quite mellow, no heat on this at all either. Fun beer from these guys. Perhaps not a fav style, but I'll take it."
"I love quads. I wouldn't put this at the top of my list, but it's definitely quite good. Strong dark fruit flavors, complemented well by some those dark leafy flavors. And just like that, my glass is nearly empty (which makes me sad)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a thin beige collar. The aroma offers dark malts, brown sugar, raisins. Smells nice. Great flavor and remarkably easy to drink. Alcohol hidden very well. A tad sweet, with lingering notes of plums, figs. Another great beer from De Struise."
""
"4.5 D: The taste was between a 4.0 and a 4.5 so I'll make up the difference here. Very good beer and probably the best variant. The Grand Reserva covers up too many flavors for me to prefer that."
""
""
""
"O: Of the three, this was my second favorite. The oak character adds a lot to this beer and I think it is very well balanced and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"With so much complexity built into the beer, it's an absolute delight to the taste buds as it will make a fine complement to any dinner in place of that port wine or cognac. For comparison's sake, there's just a few nuances that keeps it from competing with Rochefort 10."
""
"Quite a beer, quite a beer. Poured at a good temperature with a small to medium sized, tan, foamy head and no lace. Color is an opaque brown in the balloon part of the glass and in the narrrower part a hazy/cloudy amber orange red with some particulates and some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is malt, yeast, roast, fruit, red wine. Flavor is like nose, very nicely balanced, with bitter, sweet, and tang all pronounced, yet harmonious. Body is full, lush, mouth filling and carbonation is perfect. Finish is like flavor, tapers slowly, and has only a little alcohol warmth. Wonderful beer!"
"O: Good sipper. Not mind-blowing, but well-done."
""
""
""
""
"O: well above average but lacking the punch of the great quads.  In comparison to the regular pannepot, of which I drank a 2011, I'd say that one was better.  The booze and heat mellowed in this one (likely more due to the age than the barrel treatment) but unfortunately the quanitity of aroma and flavor has also mellowed, plus little of the oak character came out in this brew. Definitely worth a drink, but not as great as I anticipated/hoped, and no where near the level of westy 12 or rochefort 10."
""
"original review on: 09-14-2010"
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this a lot. Maybe a tad bit too sweet for me, but well balanced, savory, and complex. Oak aging really added to this beer."
""
"Very smooth and lighter than expected. Still chewy, but not quite as heavy as some other quads. Lots of complexity, easy to drink and very hidden alcohol. Such a beautiful beer. I may perfer this to westy."
"O: 3.5"
""
"I quite like this. There are some weird things going on but they all work together."
""
"O: Pretty much you would expect, tastes like normal pannepot with some oak aspects added in. This is a little older vintage than my regular pannepot and the flavors seem to have melded a bit, making it a bit smoother. A good quad either way, very complex and intricate."
""
"Buy any Pannepot you find."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is incredible. It's very complex yet easy to drink. There is no hint of ABV. It's fairly dry for a quad, but is packed with toffee and dark fruit flavor. Well worth seeking out."
"It looks the same as the Grand Reserva, but with a better head. The smell is much less roasty and lacks some of the mellowed characteristics I loved on the 05 GR. Very Belgian, sweet, sugary, malty. Moving to the taste, this is balanced and light, the taste is more focused on dark fruits, candied sugar, and Belgian yeasts. While it is balanced, it might need some age. Slight harsh boozy finish, medium body low carbonation. Pretty damn drinkable. This was very good, should have had it before the Grand Reserva. it's just not as good."
""
"O: Very good Quad, perfect as a winter warmer, lucky to come across this and will have to pick up some more"
"If you want a reason to get this beer, then i would say to utilize it the same way you would a big bold red wine. a steak, a broiled pork chop...it would suit these things perfectly."
"0: Another classic entry in the Pannepot series. Keep 'em coming!"
""
"Overall this beer impressed me. It was a good elaboration on more traditional Quadruples that I have had. I will be returning to the store to by some more to age."
"O: This is a very good quad."
"O- A solid quad with nothing left to be desired but nothing insanely great about it"
"From 5/12/12. The 2009 is on tap at Max's today. It's every bit as good... consitent high quality from this excellent brewer."
""
""
"That said, this is tremendously drinkable and I highly recommend it to any who can get their hands on one."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a very good beer -- especially in terms of flavor -- but it could definitely use some improvement in terms of mouthfeel. The alcohol comes through to a significant extent and makes this one a bit of a sipper."
""
""
""
""
"O- The nose was great, it was very easy drinking, but I expected a little more in the taste honestly. This is a great quad and I believe the age has helped. Not the strongest quad at 10% but the booze is definitely in the background and if this were fresh I could see it being harsh. Highly recommended. Will pick up another aged bottle if I see this on shelves."
"This is a great quad. Very complex, not over the top, nice complementary oak, well balanced. Hope to get my hands on another vintage of this beer."
"O: A pretty good beer, just wish the flavor profile lived up to the aroma. Age could have played a factor with that one."
"D - Another variation of Pannepot and another winner. So easy to sip despite packing a big punch. Alcohol only revealed in the rum note and lightly warming aftertaste, otherwise expertly masked. A cracker."
""
""
"O: The best Quad I’ve had."
""
""
""
"One of the best Belgian Quads out there. Not sure if I appreciate the oak age as much because the regular Pannepot (and even Pannepeut) is just as good when aged. If you consider yourself a fan of Belgian Quads and have not had this one yet, then you're not complete yet."
""
"I don't like QUads usually but this is excellent. Most Belgians are overpowered by the yeast but this has great balance of flavors. As good as this is, I had a regular Pannepot of similar age and I thought it was slightly better. This is still a great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had a few quadruples, but not many. This was definitely enjoyable and easy to drink. This Belgian Quad has been aged on oak but the oak doesn't overpower the beer. The flavors work wonderfully with each other and this 2008 vintage has aged exceptionally well. I wish I had more than one bottle of this vintage."
"O: Fantastic. Quite a treat. Very well put together and for 10% ABV, quite easy to drink. Alcohol is very faint, which is surprising. Nice spice notes and a classic Belgian quad flavor. Will definitely drink again."
""
""
"O: I'd been wanting to try this one for a while and it definitely didn't disappoint. I'm usually not a big fan of Quads, but this was no Quad, this was candy!"
""
"Pannepot Reserva pours a dark brown color with a thin cocoa head in my snifter glass. Good lacing on this beer. The nose is oak, bourbon, vanilla, and dark fruit- really nice. The taste is the same as the nose, with a little coffee added in. The feel is out of this world. SUPER smooth, velvety and amazing. I've never had a big beer that goes down this easily, and is this amazing feel wise. Overall- Highly recommended you try this if you have a chance.."
"taste vert fresh, i would think some time could really mellow this out. i'll have to maybe buy another."
"Usually when a quad is very sweet, it leaves a sugar coating in your mouth, but the age has really mellowed out, and left the remnants of caramelized sugars. I like it alot more than the fruity, overly sweet quads"
""
"Overall, a very tasty brew, a bit one demensional with tastes being on the sweet side. Also kind of an ugly duckling..."
""
"One of the greats."
"dark dark brown (almost black) with a tan head. nose is dark fruit (mainly plum to me), spice, caramel, and charred wood. lots of layers, but humble at the same time. taste follows suit with some added vanilla and grain tastes, and i find almost a smoky hint in the end... and chocolate? pretty sweet, but not cloying. almost full body with a rustic kind of feel. very very good."
"It's better than Westy 12. By a LONG shot."

"O. Had Pannepot last night and thought it was great. I think the Reserva is probably a touch better. Both are excellent quads. Very smooth and refined beers. Tommorow brings Pannepot Grand Reserva, if it is anything like the first 2 I have had it will be a great beer."

"11.2 ounce bottle, 2008 vintage. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a murky dark brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like dark fruit, brown sugar, oak, molasses and a bit of rum. The taste is sweet and malty, it tastes like dark fruit, sweet spices, booze, molasses, brown sugar and a bit of peppery spice and oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, I've liked the other Pannepot versions I've tried in the past, and this one is no different. Definitely worth trying!"

"2008 vintage, 11.2 oz bottle split between two snifters, as Chowdahead and I did a side-by-side with a 2010 Pannepot. Color is an amber/brown, lighter than regular Pannepot and similar to a barrel-aged barleywine. Nose is Pannepot-esque but the booze notes are much more prevalent. I love side-by-side tastings, as they really give you an opportunity to see how aging or barrel-aging affects a base beer. This one did not disappoint. Notes of dark fruit, molasses, honey, subtle spice, caramel, even some port. There is truly no other beer like Pannepot in the world - I love it. A pefect beer for my 100th BA review!"

"2008 vintage. Pours a three-finger light head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and alcohol nose and flavor is also alcohol and dark fruit, mellow sweetness. Expensive at $10.49 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Overall it's good, but doesn't stand up to some of the bigger ones IMHO."

"O – Very nice brew indeed with just great tastes all rolled up together. Has a nice sweetness and makes a great sipper."

"O: This is one of my favorite quads. It is also one of the best barrel-aged beers I've tried. This is one not to miss."
""
"Pours an opaque very dark amber, some lacing and medium colored khaki foam with some big bubbles and a ring of head. Smells like green apple, dark cherry, and some bright caramel. As it warms, dark fruit, barrel spices, and some apple comes out. Taste is fruity (apple), subdued caramel malt, and a hint of chocolate. Medium body and light carbonation, doesn't show the alcohol at all. Overall, a pretty tasty quad, balance with barrel characteristics which support the other flavors well. Nice job."

"O - Very enjoyable quad from Struise. There is some apparent alcohol, but it is not detracting in the least. It really works well with the fruits and spices."
"Poured a dark brown, with a light tan/cream coloured soapy head. Fairly dense head, leaves some bubbles behind; unfiltered body. Nose is quite bold, some licorice, chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, booze soaked dark fruits. Very complex, I could sniff this for hours. Taste is yeasty,with some grape, chocolate and licorice. Mouthfeel is a tad lighter than I'd like but still fairly full, a touch bitter in the finish. Lingering flavour and a bit of booze. Excellent quad and something I could keep my nose to for hours. Flavour holds up quite well to the nose on this as well."
"Overall, definitely one of the best and most complex of the style I've ever had. Certainly a great beer. I really like how much heat is present at this age too. Looking forward to my other bottle."
"Yum. I love Pannepot in all its forms. But there have been times when it didn't live up to my fond memories. This was not one of those times. This is an expertly made and deliriously delicious beer."
"After now sampling Pannepot, Pannepot Reserva and Pannepot Grand Reserva, I can say that there is not much difference between the three variations. These are all solid beers but they lacked the intensity and complexity I was anticipating."
"Man alive, this is one complex and satisfying beer. Another incredible Belgian delight."
"Definitely a first-rate beer. The effect of the barrels is very nice, though certainly not as pronounced as in the Grand Reserva, where they really play a starring role. A classic."
"Cheers..."
"Overall: Once more a world class brew from De Struise. I would suggest drinking a fresh one and cellaring as much as you can as this beer ages, very, very, well (as does all Pannepot seemingly!)."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a paper thin head with great lacing for a quad. Aroma of caramel, figs and raisins. Tastes sweet and fruity, oak notes in the back. Thick and chewy yet easy to drink, not too boozy, the aging has done this beer some good"
"O: This one is very enjoyable but, a bit on the raisin side for me. Sweet and viscous. Too much caramel and sweetness."
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, oaky and dark fruit. In the taste, dark fruits, a mellow oaky taste, and just a pinch of alcohol. A small alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oak and small alcohol like aftertaste. A nice oak presence with a dark fruit sweet to dryness, a really nice sipper."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a great beer. The oak and dark fruits mixed very well for me. It was relatively balanced as well for the style with the yeast spice and malty sweetness kept in check. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"UPDATE 6/6/11: Second bottle was better. More carbonation, but still lacking pizazz in the mouthfeel department. The metallic, oxidized character is again there in aroma and flavor. I edited a few things in the review above, in addition to upping my numerical score (3 to 3.4). Still not as good as this beer could or should be."
"Overall: What can you say about De Struise? They make some of the best beers in the world. Pannepot Reserva, (while not completely mind blowing) is an excellent , excellent beer!"
"This is an interesting, complex beer. It is moderately strong in alcohol and makes a good evening digestif."
"O - An interesting take on the old fishermans ale. Not sure how I feel about it compared to the standard pannepot. Its certainly different and unique. Its very delicious and the mouth feel is amazing. De Struisse can make some pretty amazing quads."
"The oak is not pronounced in oakiness or vanilla in this beer though, if it were more oaky in it's nature I think I would appreciate the oak aging more. Personally."
"Reviewed on: 05-03-2010"
"Medium feel with a modest level of carbonation. This brew is super drinkable for 10% with an alcohol presence that increases with the warmth of the beer's temperature. Along with the increase in temperature comes a bit of a more grainy sweetness instead of candy but it still has a caramel quality about it which is very enjoyable."
"D - Split the bottle three ways and it was easy to finish this bad boy. I like this better than the recent vintages, but I'm not sure it's a big improvement over the other Pannepot variants. Still, well worth trying!"
"Overall – A good quad, but there is a heavy metallic taste I just can’t get past. I have a couple other vintages I will re-rate when I try them."
"O/D-Quite a delicious brew. Very impressed. Complexity is astonishing. Smooth as smooth can be."
"Thin and light body with some decent soft carbonation, but a little too thin for me."
"D-Very well balanced yet rich, flavorful, anda complex beer."
"An exquisitely crafted quadrupel. I've thought the few that I've had in the past had a bit too much heat, but this beer strikes a good, age-evened balance and drinks very, very well. Extremely happy to have tried this."
"Overall: Great beer, one of the best in the style"
"O: Really complex beer here. The nose doesn't impress, but the flavor and mouthfeel are nice."
"Reviewed on: 10-09-2010 20:08:24"
"O - Good beer, just like Pannepot was. I'd actually prefer to drink this one more, as it was smoother, but they were both winners."
"o - every now and again you drink a beer that is in a space of it's own for the style. a beer that you feel ultimately exemplifies everything that you love and look for in a beer of that style. and for a style that i adore, this beer stands at the top of the mountain with few others even in the same ballpark. extremely glad to have 2 more bottles of this exact vintage. my hats off to you, de struise...my hats off to you."
"T: I'm not a huge fan of beers that pick up too much oak flavor from the barrel and luckily for me, this one doesn't. The oak is there, but restrained along with some brown sugar, dark fruit, yeast and a nice spiciness."
"O- This beer has some nice flavor with a subtle complexity and a soft woody note. There is a nice full sweetness but a little more alcohol to cut it would be nice. There are very faint notes of brett and yeast character that would be nice to taste more of but they just didn't come through."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth! As much carbonation is found visually, there is none to be found on the palate. It's like drinking a light syrup. Such a silky smooth feel. Really glad to have finally found and tried this beer after so long! One of the best drinking aged beers I've tried. Thoroughly delicious!"
"O: This is such a good, complex and delicious quad--such nice spice and bready toasty malts make this another damn good beer from De Struise"
" Mouthfeel is light, sour, tingling and smooth. Is there 10% in this brew? Amazing."
"--Michael"
"Thick body and perfect carbonation. Not a whole lot missing here for a quad if anything."
"2008 riserva pours an oddly quick carbonated head that disappearsquicker than it came. The color is a cola brown, the color along with the head was very reminiscient of pouring a can of soda in a glass - a fleeting foamy head that leaves no trace. Nose brings fishermans friend cough drops, smoky caramel, and i am beginning to be concerned i have an off bottle very disappointing so far. A slight prune taste with simple caramel, oak and a hint of vanilla. There is literally no carbonation and everything is muted and muddled. I really hope this bottle is just off and will rereview when i open a new one."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that fades to a small cap. Super thin rings of lacing line the glass on the drink down. Smells of caramel, malts, with muted whiffs of dark fruits (especially raisins) at first. However, as the beer warms there is a very nice smell of raisin puree. Taste is of raisins and prunes, brown sugar, caramel, and malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a very good quad from Struise. If this was brewed in 2007 that potentially makes it 4 years old at this point. Time has treated this beer very good."
"D= Very good beer here, and one I will certainly seek out again. Its been a while since I had the regular Pannepot so I believe a side by side is in order!"
"O - Incredibly drinkable and there are hints of brandy as it warms. Finished #5 of 10."
"Now that I've had a three year old version, I'd like to try this fresh---this is still a sipper, a lot of heat in the nose and the taste, even now, and I'd like to know exactly what time has done to this. It made me think of how much I still have to learn about beer, and how pleasurable that process will be."
"Really nice, certainly better than my other experience with the regular Pannepot, maybe that was a lame bottle."
"330 mL bottle, unfiltered, unpasteurized and bottle-conditioned. This is Pannepot aged in French oak barrels; 2008 vintage. Pours deep crimson with some expected floaties, light carbonation and a thin cap of light tan head that retains throughout and leaves some lacing. Smells malty with fermented dark sugars (raisins, plums, cherries, blue/blackberries), spicy/phenolic yeast and some fruity alcohol. Tastes of spice, sweet citrus, raisins and prunes, dates?, and chalky yeast. A little sweet, with some bitterness underneath, and a light winey character that wants to contribute oak, but can't quite push it through. It is very thick and viscous, with low carbonation and a mild tannic dryness. As it warms it lightens and the carbonation increases, which is odd. Not terribly complex, but very tasty, with a pleasant, but restrained oak flavor. Quite an enjoyable brew that is very easy to drink. Well-worth picking up two of these - one for drinking and one for aging."
"Good feel to this. Full body with soft carbonation.Overall a nice quad. I'd love to have this more available."
"overall; one of the best quads out there, definitely worth a try, taste great with Tilsit cheese."
"O: Overall an enjoyable quad. I guess I should try the other Pannepots too."
"O: fantastic stuff, highly drinkable despite the abv. This is a triumph. Why aren't more Quads this interesting!?"
"My all time favorite Belgian beer. I know those are strong words, but this Quad is the strongest of contenders. Pricey, but worth every penny. Has improved with age as well, glad I waited an extra 6 months after purchase to review it."
"Atmosphere is profound. Appearance is nothing transcendental, but a deep and dark hue with a nice enough head. Nose has a lot going on. Sweet and bitter notes, with a robust, malty base. Flavor is a great combination of sweet spices, robust malt, and a bitter counter-balance. Thick and dry. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer and will drink more of this. Thanks again Eric."
"O- Not bad. Not nearly worth the money paid for it. I'd much rather have a Weyerbacher Blasphemy or something similar. None the less, it's a solid quad with some light barrel flavor. Nothing crazy."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 4.5/5; Taste 4.5/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"Overall: World class ...i haven't had this in years and I am not sure why now...have to soon revisit...do try.."
"i expected just a little more out of this. still decent and very different from a lot of the quads ive had. i have more bottles of this vintage, but i think id want to try this more fresh. im guessing this was aged in wine barrels as it states on the bottle "" barrels from france"" and there is a pronounced grape aroma and flavor."
"P.S. do yourself a favor, as with all high gravity beers, you will do well to drink this beer fairly warm."
"Overall this is one of the finest 4 quads in the world, perhaps the best of them. A touch less complex than W12, a bit less thick than R10. Almost like STB's more talented and mature brother. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"But that's me."
"I think I prefer this version over the regular, shame it's much harder to find."
"2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, bread, raisins, and sweet alcohol on the followthrough. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one wasn't quite as smooth as the Old Fisherman's Ale with similar age on it, but was still quite nice. The alcohol on this one definitely made itself present on the followthrough without doubt. Hard to believe that with this one having 4 years on it already. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"
"An absolutely fantastic BSDA. Love the effects of oak aging to add an additional layer of complexity. Quite a treat!"
"O:Pretty nice. Not my favorite quad and I don't know that I taste too much of the barrel aging, would be interested to know what was aged in the barrels before this beer, or if they were new barrels. Interesting and glad that I got to try it, but won't be buying it again for the price of it."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall a great quad, I am a fan."
"medium bodied, not too full, not overcarbed. very restrained but also very good."
"A great brew and would recomend to anyone who enjoys quads and old ales."
"2008 Vintage. Pours a dark brownish-red color with a small off-white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is candied dark fruits with light alcohol and brown sugar. Taste is very well-balanced and complex with hints of oak and vanilla. A little bit of caramel as well with some nice spiciness. Finishes with a bit of booze and more dark fruits. Carbonation is a bit lacking for this style IMO, but still very nice and drinkable. Overall, it's a very good beer, but I don't know if I'd prefer it to Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus 12."
"O: No hint as to the style off the bottle, just aged. I think its a good tripple?? Maybe a quad? Nice overall, but maybe aged a little long."
"Drink- One of the best quads I have had. It was well rounded, not over bearing, assertive when it needed to be but yet delicate with the profile. Would like to have a few more vintages."
"Overall, Pannepot Reserva is one of the finest Quads I've ever had. I still like the standard Pannepot more, though. The spice profile in standard Pannepot is missed in this beer. What Reserva does so well, however, is to achieve a smoothness and subtlety that few other brewers could reproduce. Quads are usually reserved for the dessert portion of a meal, but Pannepot Reserva is subtle enough (yet still complex) to pair with duck or wild game. Don't hesitate to buy this incredible beer if you find it on store shelves."
"Mouthfeel - there are cheaper and more readily available Quads out there for regular drinking, but by itself, this was a good beverage, very complex on the palate, a sipper, I am glad I tried this, very good Quad - worth seeking out if you can get a hold of it."
"D - This is an absolute fabulous quad. Very delectable and one of my overall favorites. I just want to hold it like a good sherry, so I can inhale between sips."
"Mouthfeel is wonderfully well executed being smooth and creamy with a slightly tart feel to it too. Overall, I'm really loving this beer. A bit different than some other quads but quite delicious."
"D: It goes down easily for a big beer, but hard to imagine drinking several of these. Quads are pretty extravagant, I find; this one's on the restrained end."
"D: Very high with this beer, a great drinking Quad thats hard to put down. A little pricey for a 11.5ml bottle (about 8 bucks here in Oregon) but worth it from time to time."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Good quad, but lacks the umph. I think my bottle was an '06 or '08 or something. I'm gonna need one of these fresh as I doubt they get that much better with age. The ABV is perfect, but the flavors are DYING."
"Mouth is nice and smooth, drinks great for a great big quad."
"i've sipped so many good beers over the years since that chimay in 98'. it's crazy this is even my first review, but being in philly it makes sense (this really is a beer city). i would definitely take my time with this, it almost seems to good to be true until you get to the end and you go WTF that was a good brew."
"D - I happen to not enjoy the spice cabinet things going on in this beer, so it severely hampers its drinkability for me. I do keep coming back for the wonderful mouthfeel, it's so damn creamy."
"2008 vintage poured into an Orval chalice. Deep mahagony/garnet color. Very little to no head, I expected a puffy one, shucks. Plums, raisins, dark chewy bread and green apple aromatic qualities. The palate is lightly spicy, chewy dried fruit such as raisin, plum and cranberry. Deep dark yeasty bread. Green apple and calvados, hints of sweet oak, not cloying neither is it dry. Leathery and full well attenuated mouthfeel, but not thin. This is really a fine, fine ale; wish I had bought 2 instead of 1."
"Drinkability: Bring it on. At 10% its super smooth and dangerous if your not careful. Though I prefer the regular version over this, it still stands out as another fine offering from a great brewery."
"UPDATE: I tasted a third bottle on 3/14/11 sans any oxidation which was seriously out of this world for a Quad, I have heard of some reports of oxidation but I would tell you to definitely take the chance. Im going to update my score on taste from a 4 to a 4.5"
"This was one of the best beers that I have had so far. I could drink quite a few of these if I could get more of this. Blown away by this one."
"Compared to the 2006 Vintage regular Pannepot, the 2007 Reserva is clearly better. In the looks department, the Reserva was darker and the head formed with a creamy goodness as the beer poured. The nose is a tad bolder for the Reserva; taste was also bolder and sweeter yet with lower perceived alcholic phenols which were masterfully blended with the dark fruits and molasses making it extremely delectable. The thickness this time was done right as well though not yet perfect. Now this is setting a pretty high standard for the Grand Reserva that will come next in my horizontal tasting journey."
"glassware: tulip"
"Poured from 330ml bottle (2006) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque dark maple syrup / hazy brown color with medium, lasting, even head of uniformly sized medium foam. Aroma is rich, spicy (savory), and seasonal with notes of nuts, dried fruit, caramel, plump raisin, vanilla, and typical Belgian candi. Flavor is an interesting amalgam of standard Belgie strong ale flavors, nutmeg, sweet hops, and a long savory finish again reminding of caramelized roasted foods. Medium palate is fully appropriate and strong alcohol is mostly unnoticed except for the nice buzz."
"This isn't an earth shattering beer, but I found it near perfect for the style. Paired wonderfully with 18-month aged Gouda. My only regret was not buying more than one bottle! Finish this glass had me begging for more."
"M - Medium bodied, chewy."
"drinkability was so so - i had high expectations for this beer after trying the regular pannepot but that was an 2007 - i still have one to age so if it gets better after a year or 2 i will change my ratings"
"D: This is pretty drinkable, but I expected more out of this beer. In the future, I will stick with the regular Pannepot, or spring for a Grand Reserva, both of which I enjoyed more than this version."
"Highly drinkable quad not much alcohol heat. Really nice smooth beer."
"Overall an excellent Old Ale/Quad. One of the best tasted to date."
"2008. Deep toffee colour with a tan cap of fine bubbles. Nice lacing, decent head retention. Great aroma. Bready and toasty malts, earthy, prunes, raisins, almost a spicy wood character, light alcohol. Nice flavour too. A little sugary but far from cloying, caramel and molasses, with more of a fresh plum fruitiness and less of a prune and fig dried fruit character. Honey, spices, and alcohol were all mild and balanced, as was a hint of oak flavour and astringency. Medium plus body with lowish, well integrated carbonation that made it feel a bit lighter. Overall this was a really well balanced beer, very tasty and quite drinkable for a quad."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's definitely a great beer, but I find the sweetness from the malts and dark fruit aspects to become a bit much and it comes across as a bit too sweet for my palate and stomach; ABV is also high so I don't think I could drink too much of this in one sitting, and the 11.2 ounce bottle I'm sure will prove to be just enough; I'm glad I got two bottles of this in the trade as I'm hoping that additional time in the bottle will help mellow out the astringency of the alcohol. Excellent overall though."
"A fantastic brew from a great brewery"
"The balance of flavor is extraordinary. Sweet, but not cloying, fruity, but not overbearing. Spice and oak just add a kiss of complexity to the finish. A well constructed brew that's deserves to be near the top of the Best Quad list."
"2007 vintage, poured a dark brown. murky, mohogany with not much of a head that turned to No head pretty quickly. Not very much lacing left either. Got some of the expected smells of dark fruit, yeast, roast nut, candy sugar spice and a bit of funk. Tastes were a muted version of the smell the dark candied fruit and yeast were certainly present, along with a nuttiness and a bit of tart funk, which I did not expect. the feel was quite smooth but not as creamy as I remember it being in the past. Never the less I could drink this till I pass out. the Alc is not very present and the flavors are all wonderful, plus, in the end I think my bottle was not as good as others. Not sure what happened but know this beer is better than my experience this time around."
"Found it to be very drinkable and it was not as much of a sipper as I was expecting. Maybe a bit of alcohol burn holds this back a touch, but not too much."
"D - Yeah, it's 10% and only 11.2oz but this one is a pleasant sipper. Although the smell is kind of funky the taste and mouthfeel are really great. Like I said before, I don't like quads much but I do enjoy this one quite a lot. Yeah, it was $8.99 a bottle and yeah I did buy two, but I wish I bought 3 to spread out in the next few years to see how they age. Great, and worth seeking out."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer for Christmas night... I was eating some toffee that was topped with almonds and milk chocolate while I had this- and the pairing was incredible!! Perfect beer for the toffee!"
"Really excellent beer. Just lovely. Would be very interested to try the regular."
"Pours a deep burgundy color with a big head and lots of lace. The aroma is brown sugar and earthy notes with some raisins, some floral notes, and a good nutty and spicy character. The flavor is raisny again but has a nice spicy and earthy bit with some molasses and a warming booziness. The palate is very full but a little bit slick. Really a damn rich delicious beer."
"D: Very complex quad. Zero sign of alcohol. As I said, hard to get all flavors because there were so many. Was very excited to see this on tap"
"2008 vintage. Nice to see more random goodness flowing at the Firk. This one pours a nice obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises figs, brown sugar, light molasses, light black cherry, red apples, and some very light roasted malts. The taste holds notes roasted malts, light-ish molasses, brown sugar, figs, red apple, red grapes, chocolate, and some very light coffee. The body is a slightly hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a very nice quad that ends up being dangerously drinkable."
"D- If you can get your hands on this, do. This is my favorite style and it doesn't get any better than this. No alcohol present the entire time sipping this brew."
"I suspect I would like the traditional Old Fisherman's Ale better."
"Served: December 8, 2010"
"I really wish I grabbed more of this. It was a treat and a sipped mine for a hour or so smiling. Not being a great fan of the original, the barrel aging, or perhaps this vintage just clicked."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Bruery tulip. 2008 vintage, lot A4DD. Pours a dull chestnut with a slightly murky clarity. Head is half an inch, loose, off-white and embedded with tiny ringlets. Head quickly disperses into a solid skim and a frothy band around the edges of the bowl. Some spots and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose is tannic, expresses some ethanol, dark fruit and a trace of oak, which was much more pungent off the cap pop, but is much more diffuse in the glass. Taste follows nose; however, ethanol character is not really present in the flavor profile and oak character all but disappears. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation and some very minor, residual alcohol heat at the finish. A very good Quad - great balance and a well-hidden abv contributes to its exceptional drinkability. Not sure how much aging would enhance the experience on this one, but it might be worth securing an additional bottle to sit on for a few years."
"D- Amazing, I wish I had bought two bottles. Must try."
"Fantastic drinkability. Excellent all-around beer, but the flavor and mouthfeel really bump this one up. Beautiful."
"At 10% abv the alcohol is very well hidden & drinkability benefits because of it. Appreciable heat is minimized, though it does have a warming effect. The second pour is actually murky, as some of the sediment made it into the glass; it also seems a hair sweeter. In any case, worth a shot."
"Very pleasant on the palate and highly drinkable, this is what Belgian beer is all about."
"Thanks to Smalls for hooking me up with this beauty! Nice ruby-brown pour with a quickly fading head and great lacing. Unique nutty nose with prunes, oak, caramel, red wine, and a touch of vanilla. The taste mirrors the nose and is just as complex. The nuttiness and complexity makes this stand out from other quads I've had. It reminds me of a nice red wine. Very woody and smooth and the vanilla and oak get really noticeable as it warms. The alcohol is really well disguised. Definitely the smoothest, most drinkable and enjoyable quad I've ever had. Another world class offering from De Struise!"
"This beer was poured into a tulip glass. It's color was a dark brown with very little off-white foamy head. Alcohol is well-hidden and it doesn't drink like a 10% abv beer. It is medium-bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability is good with this beer."
"D: Very tasty beer and I could drink gallons of anything Urbain makes."
"D: Pretty good, a little boozey."
"Dark fruits come through on the nose but also some malt and brandy. This follows through on the palate and it is almost like a christmas pudding - lots of dark fruit: figs, caramelised cherries, dates etc. There is clearly some biscuit malt there as well and the hopping counteracts some of the sweetness. Overall, it is a little too sweet for me (had a 2008 recently and wonder if the extra year is too much for the beer?). Really intense flavour for sure but quite heavy and I would struggle to drink more than one."
"overall - very tasty, I threw a second bottle in the cellar. This will age phenomenally. I'm surprised the lack of oak I taste/smell."
"jd"
"2008 bottle poured into a new belgium glass. Opaque brown with ruby edges, small mocha head with some lacing. Smell is caramel and sweet malt up front followed by wet barrel, sweet tobacco, and a hint of orange peel. Taste is not as big as I thought it would be. Only slightly sweet, caramel malts with a touch of bitterness and milk chocolate coffee. Doesn't have the characteristic quad yeast flavor i was expecting. Long roasty aftertaste and alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is more like a stout then a quad - medium to heavy and a mild carbonation. A great beer overall, although I am not sure it is completely within the style parameters. As far as the BA style description goes, it fits."
"D: I like the regular Pannepot a fair amount and this is even better. A really fantastic beer and one that I would easily drink again."
"Great Beer!!!"
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and silky; almost oily, but not offensively so. Very well crafted, but a 'one and done' for sure."
"2008 vintage. Light pour for this quad, a somewhat lightish brown, almost cola colored. Lots of raisins and Belgian sugars in the nose along with a good bit of whiskey. Smooth taste, rich and hearty; almost chewy like a strong stout. Oak-aged barrels show through with the whiskey-like smoothness. Dates, raisins and other dark fruits emerge. Immensely drinkable. A true classic here and one I need to find again."
"There's not much bad to say about Pannepot Reserva. Aside from the nose being a little weak it's extremely impressive. The flavor is very deep and complex. Personally, I don't think it's quite as good as Pannepot-Old Fisherman's Ale, but it's not far off at all. This is very impressive beer that needs to be experienced. Find a bottle."
"Overall impression: lacking on the aroma and appearance but outstanding flavor. complex and unique, this is good but not worth the price."
"2008 vintage."
"D- i was very excited to try this one, but after i did i was left with a feeling of disappointment. the original version is better and cheaper. ill stick with that one from now on."
"This is a very nice brew. It is full of dark fruit flavor and very smooth."
"One of three versions of Pannepot I've had the pleasure of sampling recently. This one, aged in French oak barrels, 2008 version. This one has a soft pour, as an aged ale should, relatively calm, russet brown. Definitely picking up plenty of oak in the nose, a nice layer. All the typical Pannepot flavor is there, but the barreling and aging and wood have mellowed it out quite a bit. Very nice. Layers of sweet spiced plum, raisin, rum, cake, nice matlyness and depth. Leathery. Velvety but slightly thinned out mouthfeel from the usual version. This is an outstanding beer - quite different really from the standard Pannepot. Not necessarily better or worse, but a different beast. Having sampled the regular Pannepot, the Reserva, the Pannepeut (Danish), and the Pannepot Wild, I have to say my favorite is the old standard issue, with a good year or two of age on it. But they all have their quirks making each one different, which is why we like beer. Cheers."
"I need to drink quads more often, and Pannepot Reserva justifies that statement."
"Its not the best smelling quad, but its arguably one of the best tasting and drinking quads i have had."
"Overall- Expensive... Yes. Worth it... Yes! This is excellent, its going to be tough to try to cellar my other bottles."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is amazing. Possibly the best quad I've had. Rich and sweet, super complex and flavorful. Very easy drinking its so smooth and rich."
"D: I find this to be an overly drinkable brew for the style. A beer that is great to sit back and enjoy while you take all the flavors and complexities in. The 10.00% alcohol is a bit present and if it would be masked a little different, I feel this would have received a 5 in score. None the less, stellar brew."
"A really complex beer like most quads, love all the flavors and how they melded together. If it wasn't for the price, i could drink this all the time."
"d - I thought this was a great quad; the nose on it was great. Would love to try this one again."
"(D)- A great take on the style. Thicker in texture than I expected, but it added an additional richness to the beer somehow. Smooth as can be with great flavors. Extremely easy to consume and enjoy; my bottle did not last long."
"Drinkability -- I have to admit that this is quite good, although this is making me want to revisit the original; I think I liked it better. I think the oak aging may have bogged down all of the bright and exciting flavors of the original Fisherman's Ale."
"Deep amber/brown pour with a thin fizzy head that fades to just a faint ring. Coats the glass nicely. Big Belgian Quad aromas in the nose - loads of spice/clove, dark fruits, toffee malts, some burnt coffee notes as well. Pretty much what I expected, but still very complex. Taste follows the nose but the sweet (slightly boozy) big malt flavors really kick in. Not as thick/creamy as other quads I've had, but still a nice meal in a bottle. Glad I picked up a few bottles of this!"
"DB- The regular Pannepot blew me away with complexity. This one just seems too old, I will have to find a newer bottle, it reminds of the 2007 Van Der Kaiser Blauw I had months back. A ton of stale caramel malt and nothing much else."
"I enjoyed it while it lasted, but it didn't make me want to pour another one immediately."
"D- For a barrel aged Quad, this drinks very nicely. Could be a very dangerous combination :)"
"medium-plus bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. well-hidden 10% makes this one dangerously drinkable. in the final analysis i'd put it in my top tier of quads, though toward the back of the group."
"Full bodied, a little thick and slick. Adequate carbonation. Very drinkable, because I didn't even realize I was on my final sips."
"O - This is one I've been waiting a while to try, and it didn't disappoint. I'll be picking up a few more next time I'm in the city."
"This really is a tremendous beer. I was seriously disappointed by Pannepot and found it overly roasty. However, the barrel aging has completely muffled those notes in the Reserva and added a huge vinuous character. Phenomenal quad."
"Flavor is definitely interesting. It's very good, but completely different from the traditional Pannepot. This has a lot more over-ripe fruit notes. Some raisins and dates, and also some sweet fruits like plums. Medium body, medium carbonation, mild booze...with basically no booze warmth/burn. Great tasting beer though overall from De Struise!"
"This bottle is from 2008, and was purchased at Downtown Wine and Spirits in Somerville. The pour reveals an opaque brownish beer, with some ruby hues, and two fingers of white heading. Nose is of juicy dark fruits such as prunes, figs, grapes and dates. Some brown bread and mild alcohol can also be picked up on as it warms. Big blast of candied sugar in the beginning of the taste, followed by more dark fruit nectar, quick hit of hops and carbonation right toward the finish, and a lingering dryness at the end. The body of this beer is big and in your face, and filled with complexities. Drinkability is excellent for a sipper like this. Allow this one to unfold for sure. I would also recommend pairing this with food. Last time I matched this up with a Filet Mignon, which was nice, however I would personally recommend some kind of creamy blue cheese. Excellent stuff here from Struise, right up there with the examples the Trappists make."
"** 9/6/14 - Had my last 2008 today. At ~6 years old the flavors were feeling a little muted but still nice. Classic Pannepot yeast profile, brown sugar, caramel, spice and dark fruit aplenty. More oak than I remember previously, comes through pretty well. Very easy to drink, maybe one of the smoothest 10% beers in recent memory. Mouthfeel felt a bit on the limper side."
"D: the mouth feel lets me down this beer even though i dont want to because its tasty and i want to savor it. really hardly any alcohol detected and the flavors really flow well. i would love to find a bottle of some older vintages."
"Overall a beauty! I cannot wait to try Black Albert after drinking this one!"
"Notes: Vintage 2007. Incredibly complex, yet very well balanced. Oak flavors aren't overly strong, but definitely present and make a great difference. Really great beer, recommended."
"This is a very drinkable big beer and the bottle size is about the perfect serving size. I really enjoyed sipping on this beer and many thanks to sleepydave for bringing this over. I still haven't cracked one of my regular Pannepots, but after having this I'll have to try one of those soon. There are really no flaws associated with this beer and I think it has just become one of my favorite Belgians. I will definitely have to seek out another bottle of this."
"Probably couldn't drink a lot this; too rich and sweet. Nice for a small amount. Like dessert."
"D: It's decent, but I prefer the original and the Grand Reserva to this one."
"Overall, I think it's a really good bear, but I was expecting more. I had two traditionnal Pannepot 2007 before. For the first one, I had the same reaction. For the second one (not on the same day) I thought it was one of the best bear I knew. I found it better than the Rochefort 10. For this beer. the Pannepot Reserva 2007, I think it's between this two reaction. I would not get tired after a bear, but I could not drink more than one. And the Rochefort is still a better bear than this one."
"An excellent beer overall. The others there didn't think it was quite so impressive, but damn, I thought it was good, and it's pretty rare too."
"OVERALL: Essentially, this brew is Pannepot without the added spices and herbs. Though Pannepeut is a nice beer on its own right, I don't think it even compares to Pannepot in terms of complexity and enjoyment. On the other hand, I can definitely see the appeal in this brew, and can understand why some would chose it over Pannepot. This is one I would have again, but would reach for the regular Pannepot nine times out of ten. Worth checking out to make up your own mind if you get the chance, and especially fun for a side-by-side."
"D: Strong on taste, would be a great addition to a good creme brule."
"OK...doing a vertical of the 06, 07, and 08. The 06 had a small head, slight aroma of alcohol and caramel malts, and flavor of caramel malts, slight cider, some citrus and a decent lingering after taste. The 07 had a medium head, strong aroma of malts and alcohol, significant carbonation and some rough notes of malts and alcohol. The 08 was like wood cleaner, ethanol, and bandaids. I'll hope this was just a bad bottle!"
"I drank this from a 11.2 oz bottle from the De Struise web shop...The beer pours medium brown, like a quad should look but a little lighter of a brown than the pannepot. There are tons of yeasy floaties. The head is disappointing, only rising a little then gone right away...The aroma is really dark fruits, raisins, caramel with a slight hop finish...The taste is ok, doesn't quite live up to a great quad though. A little light in feel and a very alcoholic finish. The taste is in general is just kind of flat."
"Not as tasty, creamy or complex as the Pannepot but still a decent beer."
"D- A dangerously quaffable beverage, particularly given its high ABV. I certainly wish we had this available in the States!"
"D-this is extremely tasty and big, great feel on the palate, hides the alcohol extremely well. The oak aging is faint and subtle; but still present."
"D- This was a very enjoyable treat that I wish I had a couple more of. I wouldn't mind getting a couple more to cellar a little longer. I think this one should be a staple on most people's lists of beers to try."
"Pours dark brown/black with a thin head despite initially gushing from the bottle. Aromas of deep caramel, vanilla, nuttiness, and alcohol. Palate is of more vanilla, a fruitiness of cherries or blackberries, rose water, and a little oak. A slightly tart finish with a bit of sweetness, carbonation, wetness, and vanilla exhale that evokes a cream soda."
"3 way blind taste test alongside pannepot grand reserva 2006 and westvleteren 8. Nice dark appearance with a creamy beige head. A very clean ripe white fruit smell, I get pears here mostly, and something reminiscent of soap also gets me. Taste is quite malty, lot's of those pears still around and a good boozy taste. Beautiful silky smooth mouthfeel, a real success."
"D: Outstanding brew."
"Barrel aged Pannepot all I can say is WOW.The smoothness that the barrel aging adds is over the top and if there were any edges on Pannepot. Which I never detected any Panny by itself is a World Class brew. The barrel aging adds a whole new depth to this Struise masterpiece. All the wonderfull flavors from the Pannepot the carmel vanilla spice smoothness and the added aroma of the oak aging truly push this beer into a aficionados cellar collection to be savored. My highest praise . A true masterpiece. Its METAL"
"Overall Impression - This is different from the quads that I ususally drink (St. Bernardus 12, Gouden Carolus Grand Cru, etc.), but it is definitely a great beer. If only I could get this on a regular basis. I can't speak to the accuracy of its world wide rating, but I can understand why people would rate it so highly. This is a must get if you can. I would even recommend mail ordering it if you can't get it locally. As and after thought, I think Gouden Carolus Grand Cru is still my favorite quad."
"It's delicious!"
"D: Very good, better than the Grand Reserva version."
"O: Very close to the regular Pannepot. A bit milder on alcohol and taste but, of course, a brilliant beer"
"Notes: Suitable beer for my 600th, a one off beer that I brought back from Belgium myself. Its depth and the mastery shown in how it presents were an honor to experience."
"Creamy body is delicately carbonated. Another amazing beer from Struise. Urbain is the man! Great malty quad, perfectly compimented by the barrel aging that adds a slightly dry wine and oak presence."
"This is a big fruity and vinous quad. The 4-6 ounces that I tried was satiating."
"Overall - An excellent brew although not quite as good as the standard Pannepot.. definitely recommended though..."
"Pours a murky tawny color with a large and long-lasting head that leaves a coating of foam on the glass. The nose is rich, full of chocolate, raisins and molasses. There's a faint red wine-like tartness, and a odd mineral aroma beneath the surface. On the palate it's fruity and slightly tart, like a semi-ripe blackberry. A big chocolate malt flavor makes up the foundation, with subtler notes of tannins, minerals and figs beneath that. The finish is semi-dry and semi-tart with a light astringency. The full body and chocolatey, almost roasty malt profile make this an unusual quad, and a fairly good one."
"The head quickly turns rocky as three fingers of deep biscuity tan bubbles fade slowly leaving a bit of lace. Body is almost black but does show lots of brown on the edges when held to light. Nose is a big bold rustic spice profile. Some phenol spices with tones of leather, wood, sun scorched soil, raisins and dark fruit all come through on the nose. With first sip you immediately take a step back and say wow!, this beer is something special. First off I have to say that this is probably the best I've ever had a 10% alcohol hidden, and that is totally a complement. Rich toffee and bready malts are mixed with dark fruits for a wonderful complexity. Creamy smooth with lengthy richness and soft spices all through the palate. Carbonation is just right and carries all the flavors well. Oak is classic in this one and really adds maturity. Mouthfeel is oh so lovely and slightly thick. You would really have to stop me from drinking this beer all night, but at some time you could remind me that it is $23 a bottle and 10% alcohol."
"Overall this is a tasty beer, but for the price I would recommend sticking with the non-Reserva, though if you're curious it's certainly worth a try."
"Brown colored beer with a firm tan head. Rockin aroma showcases the intricate complexities of Pannepot, with added notes of vanilla, red burgundy and a very light toasted wood. Nose is awesome. Flavor is mildly disappointing. The barrel seemed to mellow and tame the original Pannepot, but it seemed to lose a bit of its flavor intensity and concentration. Doesnt quite have the depth of flavor or body of regular Pannepot. That being said, still a killer brew."
"D: A fine sipper: luscious feel, complex flavors, enticing aroma. Not quite as masterful as the Belgian, but still a delicious beer. A strong recommendation and a beer I'm glad to have a few more of on hand (and even more at the local market)."
"Pours a clearish reddish brown color body. Suspended particles. Small off-white head. Dark fruity aroma, spices. A nice Belgian aroma. Somewhat musty, maybe coriander or something. Sweet spices, very aromatic. Dark fruity taste, plum and dark grape. Soft mouthfeel. Some smokiness present too. Very tasty, not too overwhelming."
"Poured a medium to deeper reddish tinged brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of wood, dark fruits -raisins and plums-, caramel, and some earthiness. The wood really came out more and more as I spent time with this one. Tastes of wood, the same dark fruits, and vanilla. Alcohol content well hidden."
"Very decent mouthfeel, I wish the carbonation was a little more lively and soft...it feels a bit watery in mid-palate. Alcohol is well hidden, only a little bit in the tail of the sip to help warm you up. The mouthfeel is a tad thin as the carbonation doesn't really lift the beer."
"D - Pretty good. This is tasty, the alcohol is completely hidden. I'd call this a really-nice-to-have, but not a must have."
"A - dark creamy brown in color. a tight light tan head that sticks to the glass. S - creamy dark fruit and bready yeast T - nice malty taste with dark raisin and fig taste. maybe some slight apple taste. a bready yeast taste and nice caramel malt. M - nice and creamy. low carbonation and easy drinking quad. D - pretty dead on to what I expected. a standout quad. very rich in malt, dark fruits and yeast. complex enough for balanced flavors but not too complex to confuse the pallate."
"Slightly tart finish. Possible orange peel note in finish. Alcohol still very evident through the heaviness of this beer."
"Big body with the alcohol suppressed, makes this brew easy enough too drink...just don't forget what the 10% ABV can do to you. It's bigger than it seems yet not as warming as you'ld expect. Great tasty stuff!"
"Taste is very much cacao powder. Roasted malts are present, but very mild and smooth. The alcohol is warming, but still mild considering the 10% ABV. There is a nice candisugar twist to this beer. The yeast adds notes of juniper and to a lesser extent coriander. Mouthfeel is thick, a little syrupy and sticky. A very complez and heavy beer that is a real sipper."
"Overall, I thought this was a really great Belgian ale. The flavors were rich and pure, mingling so well and cross such a wide range of style that it was almost impossible to nail down where it was coming from .A deep dark ale; this one would surely please anyone who gives it a try. Does it live up to the hype? I will let you decide that, my feelings are kind of mixed on the subject personally, but one thing for sure, it is damn good."
"Good characterful beer. I'd like some Christmas pudding with this."
"I would highly recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: A completely different beer from the import version, in my opinion. This one barely tastes spiced at all, and what spice that is present gets subsumed in the alcohol. In some ways it's better, in some ways not so good, but it's definitely worth seeking out, just like the original. Next time I'm down in Atlanta, I intend to pick up one of each so I can do a horizontal."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Very much looking forward to the new version, which will be unspiced, and as I recall, a bit drier."
"Pours dark brown out of the bottle and settles into a dark mahogany in the glass. The head is fluffy and off-white and dissipates fairly quickly to a ring with good lacing. The aroma is sweet with dark fruit, plums and raisins, and a bit of candied sugar and roasted malts. There are some spices in the aroma but very faint. The taste is a little less complex than the original version with a little less spiciness and a heavy dose of grape sweetness. There's a little bit of cola flavor in there as well on top of a roasted malt base with some caramel tones. The mourhfeel is medium bodied with a little less carbonation than the original. There is a little less sour kick on this one and, for me, leads to a slightly more drinkable beer. Either way, this is a slight notch below the original but a great beer on its own."
"D - Doesn't drink like a 10%, but it's still heavy. Quite a good beer."
"Pours a dark cola color with tan specks of yeast suspended throughout. A small, resilient tan head is present which is reminiscent of froth on top of a cappuccino. I smell toffee, rose, grapes, and caramel. Tastes of raisins, figs, sugary malt, pepper, and finishes with ginger (nice of them to help clear the palate before the next sip). The perfect amount of sweetness, nowhere near cloying. Surprisingly smooth. Creamy with a dry finish. The alcohol is almost entirely hidden. Overall, delicious! It is a complex yet very drinkable quad."
"Highly Recommended."
"Very drinkable brew that I can only assume will get better and better with age."
"Old Scores: 4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4 (ha, it still ended up being the same exact rating almost 2 years later)"
"Pannepot Old Fisherman's Ale (Danish Version) is a wonderful quadrupel that should come in 750 ml bottles. My measly 11.2 ounces is now gone (already?!) and I was just getting into a groove. It'll be interesting to see how the version brewed for the American market stacks up to this one. Pretty well, I'll bet."
"Good, but I prefer the other."
"Drinkability - I've only had the Danish version of this one, and would love to see how the American version pairs up. A very unique brew, and one I tend to enjoy. Very complex and very sweet to boot. Sweetness keeps the drinkability down."
"I'm starting to find a real appreciation for Belgians and this is near the absolute top of those that I've had... I've been wanting to try this forever and to be able to secure the Danish version is extra special... You rock, Aliza!"
"Overall very enjoyable parts of the offering but they aren't necessarily synced up with each other as well as would be desired; strong effort nonetheless."
"The beer poured a deep black body with a very thick tan head, fluffy and rich. The beer had a deep earthy nose, some chocolate tones as well. The taste gave me dried fruit up front and then some alcohol tones as well. Very pleasing. There is some subtle but distinct wood notes as well from the barrel aging. This version of Pannepot is an excellent, well balanced and complex beer. I only wish I had tried this bottle along side the other versions of Pannepot. Maybe next time."
"What a great quad. I need to seek out some more of this stuff!"
"D- I like this beer a ton. This may be the best quad I have yet to have. Certainly up there with Roch 10 and Westy 12."
"Yeah, there is a lot going on with this beer, but much of what is going on isn't good and that which is, is obscured by all the nastiness. I guess if one is inclined to like quads (I'm not) it isn't bad, but really. I mean, I can appreciate a style I do not like, but I cannot appreciate this beer."
"incarnations, I admit I was pretty damn excited to give it a whirl. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Smells of figs, raisins, malt, and nuts. Superb on the palate; plummy, raisiny, almost vinious. With a depth of character that could cause one to contemplate drinking 4 or 5 of these in one day just to nail down all the tastes/senses that this outstanding beer presents. I love Achel Extra, but this to me is WAY better...Now I'll have to get my hands on the other versions."
"Wow, this is a good beer. Incredibly complex and smooth. There's a bit of sweetness in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium, but it basically dances in your mouth then runs down your throat. Perfect amount of carbonation, almost perfect on the mouthfeel. This is a pure enjoyment to drink."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep dirty cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of bubblegum ester with some candi sugar and some light spices. Taste is comprised of a sweet malt base which is well balance with some bubblegum ester and some light spicy yeast at the end. Very well balance with no apparent alcohol and a full body with great carbonation. I thought it was slightly less complex then the regular version but I would have to do a side-by-side comparison."
"This is worlds apart from the Belgian version I love so much. This beer lacks the wonderful spice found in the first version. It's booze, equally pronounced, lacks the depth of flavor required to make it pleasant and its sugars do not add complex raison or fig character but rather detract making this beer too sweet to enjoy."
"Drink: Incredibly drinkable for a ten percenter, made quenching by the fresh tartness."
"The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy. Tongue-massaging. Despite the fact that the alcohol isn't shy at all, this is very drinkable. Overall, this is very enjoyable. Although, I do prefer the non-danish version. Both brews foamed a bit as soon as I popped the crown, but the head was nearly nonexistent on this one. Also, despite having had over a week to settle in the fridge, the yeast refused to part with the beer and arrived in my glass in all their chunky glory. The taste was quite similar between the two, but I'd need to do a side by side in order to really pinpoint exactly what makes each unique in this regard."
"Overall: It does not rank up there the with ABT quads, but is a nice beer nonetheless. Nice sweet brown sugar tastes mingled with dark fruits. It's an easy drinker at such a high ABV. I am eager to try the Belgian verison to see how this one stacks up."
"Thanks again go out to Aaron!"
"It is not the spectacular brew I was hoping for, but it is nonetheless very well crafted and pleasant. Worth picking up at least a six pack on my next chance."
"Overall, Pannepot ""Light"". I think I prefer it to the regular version."
"Overall, a nice dessert type beer."
"Pannepot - Old Fisherman's Ale (Denmark Version) pours a dark brown with only an off white ring of head around the edge of the glass, poured from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Dark fruit wafts out of the glass. The flavor is also dark fruit with a hint of spices. The mouthfeel is thin but appropriate. I can't put my finger on any differences from the regular version, I would like to sample them back to back one day. Excellent beer."
"D- It starts out a bit rough but you really do warm up to it very nicley. I wish I could even find someone to trade this with me. Great beer and I would love to have it again but chances probably aren't to high. Thanks to Delirium Cafe for carrying this."
"This version was much better than the original version IMO with not even close to the amount of spices as the other version had. This one was also lighter in color."
