"22 oz bottle conditioned, poured into a pint glass.  Great bananas aroma, very smooth 12+% abv and nice Belgian quad, thoroughly enjoyed."
""
""
""
"I love quads so therefore I was eager to try this beer. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a let down as it just lacks the sophistication of most Belgian quads. The head is lacking and while the aroma is good, the beer is way too sweet. Very nice dried fruit and clove characteristics with alcohol becoming more prominent as the beer warms. If the sweetness could be dialed back a bit it would do wonders for the beer."
""
"Loved this on draft.  It was slightly out of style, but thats part of why I liked it so much."
""
""

"A golden reddish brown brew clocking in a 12.3% abv.  It's very well hidden and quite a delight to drink.  Dark fruit aroma dominates the nose and the palate and is coated nicely.  I don't/never have claimed to be a fan/pro of belgian quads but I found Smuttynoses' take on this style to be very impressive.  I could/would recommend this offering!"

"I'm quite impressed with Smuttynose's venture into the world of Quads. The color is redish-brown and has a lovely fruity nose. The flavor is very sweet for a quad, with a silky mouthfeel. I'm curious to spree what 6 months to a year do to this beer."
"22 ounce bottle into chalice, 2015 vintage bottling. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring pretty quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of golden raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, toasted bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt notes; with good strength. Taste of golden raisin, plum, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, candi sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of golden raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, grape, light banana, pepper, clove, caramel, candi sugar, toasted bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and slightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pale Quadrupel style! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and bready/candi sugar malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"I haven't been drinking a lot of quads, this one seems slightly sweeter than average to me, but a very average brew."
""
""
""
"Very sweet and needs a bit more time to mellow. Enjoyed a few sips then it was too cloying."
""
""
"Deep red ale.  All of 12% lovely drinker out if a tulip.  Simply enjoy."

"O: Nothing to write home about, though it will certainly get you drunk."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is no traditional quad, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. I rate experimental ipas as such so why not a quad too? I'd say this is a tasty beer and worthwhile to anyone who is open to an experimental quad. the boozy and raisin aspects combine perfectly to for a tasty big brew."

"This is an amber colored brew...a bit hazy with some 'floaties' and a very thin head. The alcohol is immediately evident....it has a boozy, malt-intense smell. There is some yeast and hop scent in the aroma as well, along with a huge fruit profile. I got peach and apricot at first, but then a multi-layered, spice-backed complexity came forth. Intense. The taste is equally big and powerful. Serious bitterness and lots of alcohol warmth. The alcohol could be folded in a bit more subtlely, but the brew is still very well made. Full in body, but the alcohol warmth is distracting from the mouthfeel. A nice big brew."
""
"Gravitation is a good American quad - it is a sipper for sure."
""
"22oz bomber: This one pours a darker caramel color. There was almost no head or lacing on it. Nice nose. Yeast, spices, caramel, dark fruits. The taste is very good. Some sweet caramel malt, raisin, bready, and a hint of roast and chocolate. Smooth. A very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Descent quad. A little high on the acid and ester qualities but overall, pretty solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This isn't that great. I bet that it would mellow out and allow the flavors to marry after a year or so. If you decide to get this bottle, make sure you sit on it for a while before you drink it."
""
"Overall: This is one of few beers that I simply have to dump out. As others have said, it is a mess. A 12% ABV beer can work only if there is balance, and the effort here to conceal the alcohol with the super sweet raisin and fig flavors creates an unpleasant experience. There are 80 proof liquors that don't taste this alcoholic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes potently belgian yeast spicy, herbal, apricot & tropical fruity, with some light caramel. Ends with a peppery zip. Clean alcohol sting is drying and digs a small amount into the overly sweet malt. It's not cloying, due to the spicy and alcohol, but it's not far from it. Medium thick in the mouth with modest carbonation. Too much for this to be an abbey ale, perhaps a trippel in the malt profile?"
""

"Super sweet chewy beer, let it age. That's the short review. Appears a deep amber highlighted golden hue with khaki head forming thick head clings evenly to the sides of the glass. Aroma has deep fruit, think ripened apricot, figs, and in this beer's case loads of pureed raisin. A bit of alcohol on the nose, brightens things up a bit let's you know what your dealing with a big ass Belgian style Quad...to balance out the sweetness I'm smoking a RoMa Craft Anthropology, Nicaraguan rolled big ass cigar to bring some earthy spice, black pepper, and leather into the mix it really let's the beer shine the contrast between dark earthy tobacco leaves and these dark fruit elements I speak of. Flavor of the quad is super sweet it just sits on the sides of the tongue, it's big chewy and flavorful in the back end be ready for some alcohol to add to the depth. This bottle I bought for $6.50 needs to be laid down for a year at least, it's still a bit hot and I believe the overwhelming layers of sweetness will mellow out. Body is big bodacious and heavily filled with residual sugars on the palate, it's big and definitely burns and warms your chest with each sip. Overall I suggest getting some 2013 now and sitting on it for future use, great beer now will only get better with some mellowing."

"This poured a murky reddish amber with a thin head that fell fast to a thin ring, shimmering wet lace and alcohol legs. Little yeast floating on top. Very light in color for a quad looks more like a barleywine. Nose is raisin, dark fruits, plum, date, caramel malt, candy sugar, a quick glimpse of bread but really more cake like malt and alcohol. Has a very high abv. Taste follows the nose all the way. Raisin, butter and rum. Reminds one of fruitcake. It’s a little out of balance with no bitter at all and lots of booze. It’s immediately warming, medicinal and has just a bit of spice. Mouthfeel is thin and has a sticky fruit juice quality to it. This is a big sweet beer with not a lot of carbonation that finishes dry from all the booze. It was not unpleasant but I would call it an interpretation on the belgian quad."
""
"Overall a very good quad that is taste appropriate. If youre in the mood for a complex belgian style, this one wont disappoint."
"2013. Poured in a tulip, the beer is an opaque, bright, orange-amber coloring with a thin, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that settles into a filmy coating. Aromas of booze, toffee, and biscuit, with some rich berry and old world fruit highlights. Flavors are bold and rich, with a date and raisin sweetness that overpowers most of the spicing. Only hints of all spice sneak through, and barely. The booze overpowers all of the flavors, and deadens some of the palate. Slick and smooth in mouth, the beer comes off a bit muddled, both with flavors and feel. The aftertaste is richly sweet and slightly warming, with a smooth, mid-lingering finish. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Overall – Quite a potently sweet and big beer. Rather tasty, but nothing too exceptional."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice American take on a quad. Very comparable to those Belgian versions and look forward to more of this in the future. Might have to get another to store for a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol is not very well managed. This is a big, warming beer. The aromas are great. The flavors are good up front, but the finish is biting. But, overall, a pretty good beer."
""
""

"another american quad that falls short on all levels. the appearance was very light colored for a quad. looked like a watered down barleywine brownish red with no head at all. smell was very sweet cherry like that i knew right away was gonna be cloyingly sweet with some booze. taste and mouthfeel was cloyingly sweet, cherry like alittle raisiny and thin mouthfeel. the only thing i find good about this beer was the high alcohol. sort of a weak ass troegs mad elf"
"This quad is very approachable. Not your standard bouquet or flavor profile, but still unmistakably Belgian in influence and complex and portly. I'd like to try this side-by-side with Weyerbacher's to see which one I like better. This one's a lot easier-going, in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An average brew. Warming, still a little hot. Would probably benefit from a year or two in the cellar."
""
""
"Overall this is a great take on a Belgian Quad. It's to be expected that its going to be boozy and malty and high in alcohol. If it weren't... then it wouldn't be advertised as a quad! All in all I'd say its a pretty tasty brew. But if I'm looking for a delicious beer thats the same style.. I'm just going to go out and buy a 12oz Rochefort 10 and not worry about spending the extra bucks on a bomber. Wish I picked up the bomber of Zinneke instead of Gravitation. But alas, it was still pretty damn tasty."
"O: Could stand to be a little drier like the classic quads, but this doesn't taste bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall glad I picked up a bottle of this and can imagine it sitting well in the cellar. A little less complex than some of the authentic belgian quads but still a very big beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice and complex for an American-brewed quad, with decent drinkability right now. Definitely see this one getting better with age as the alcohol mellows and the maltiness can shine more. As always with the Smuttynose big beer series, the bombers are priced very nicely, so you might as well get a few and throw them in the cellar"
"First impression is the presence of the Belgian yeast, strong and potent. Highly carbonated, with a round, almost skim milk consistency. Very much like the traditional Belgian Pale Ale. The finish is mildly sweet with a strong alcohol presence."
""
""
""
"Overall not as good as some quads I've had, but has a nice blend of flavors and the alcohol isn't too in your face. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O- Don't really understand the low score on this one. I think this is a solid Quad with an added bonus of the raisin puree. I think Smuttynose was simply playing with the dark fruit aspect of many a great Belgian Quads. That being said, this one is enjoyable to say the least. A must try? Maybe not, but a solid beer nonetheless."
""
""
"Pours a deep cola brown color with a small quick fading head that leaves a few bubbles on top. Pretty dark for a quad. Smell is sweet and full of sugar and raisins. Very pleasant smelling. Taste is very good. Nice sweetness up front with some bitter malts to finish the taste. Raisins and plums dominate the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation. Overall I enjoyed this. Very good quad."
"O: I'm finding it extremely hard to enjoy this beer, which brings to mind Smuttynose's wheat wine, which similarly tasted of alcohol and sugar. Putting the raisin flavors aside, this tastes and feels more like a flat rum and coke than a beer."
""
""
""
""
"O – Is it “true to style?” Who the fuck cares, it’s delicious. Besides, the Quad style is a moving target. This 2011 edition is pretty big (12.5%!) but not as syrupy as the 2010 version thanks to the candi sugar. Also, while I found this beer to have a characteristic alcohol “hotness” when it was fresh (like many of the Smutty Big Beers), eight months in the cellar has done wonders for this brew in that regard."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of dark fruit and residual sugar sweetness, but enough body and booze to provide some balance."
""
""
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 10-03-2011)"
"There’s a warming effect, especially as the beer opens up and is allowed to linger on the palate. It’s a wonderful, wonderfully complex brew, even if it dares defy styles."
""
"I’ll have another."
"Overall this is a cohesive and approachable beer, with a few surprises that are easily appreciated."
""
""
"O - Too rich for my taste"
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: The flavor of this beer is quite nice. Hits the dark fruit belgian dark flavor very nicely. A more than acceptable Quad."
"This thing comes nowhere near being in style with a Belgian quad. It should be called Belgian style nail polish due to abundance of detectable alcohol. Overly cloying, tongue slapping, and a step away from being a malt liquor with grape flavoring."
""
""
"Feel again is a bit rich for the style as I prefer a better attenuated Quad. Complexity is also a bit lacking on the finish. On the flip side this beer does gain strength as it warms into the 60's I would guess but I'm not sure it's worth the calories."
""
""
"O: this beer was recommended to me at the distributor since I enjoy Belgian quads, but when I read somewhere about raisin puree being used, I was a little put off - however, as I drank the 22 oz bomber, boy, was I happy - really strong, really sweet, really soft, and really tasty - a true treat, and not what I have usually had in a quad (not that I've had that many, and I get that there are many different styles within the category) - I would definitely have this again - I know this sounds weird, but this is a yummy beer"
""
""
""
"O: Not as vibrant as the aged on tap experiences I've had. I still love old malt bombs like this though, but BA has hardened my once happy go-lucky beer raving about common treats like this. From now on I'm waxing all of these as soon as I get them."
""
"O- This beer has a big yeast character and some nice malt support with a full alcohol heat that is not harsh but dominates."
""
"Overall: Its a decent, but not real interesting quad. A little one sided with sweet, raisiny, booze. Pretty good value, but bettter quads to be had for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bomber, poured reddish-brown with a foamy, tan head that dissipated quickly as expected for the ABV. Aromas are sweet and boozy with caramel and toffee, not much Belgian. Tastes are sweet and boozy once again. Complex notes of toffee, candi sugar, caramel, brown sugar, and raisin. Reminds me of liquid butter toffee? Not as much Belgian influence as I'd hoped for. Mouth-feel is buttery and smooth, full-boded and syrupy. Finishes sweet with a slight prickle on the palate from the alcohol, which is relatively well concealed given the massive ABV. Overall, I really enjoyed this, but it seemed to lack the Belgian qualities I was expecting for a quad. It seemed to be a great American Strong Ale at best. It is still worth the try if you can find it, as I really did enjoy it....again, just not what I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-One of the few Quads I've had with banana flavors. The dark fruits I normally associate were there as well but this one had a nice touch of banana."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just ok. It's a bit rough at times."
""
""
""
"Gravitation pours a dark amber color, with a small head that dispated quickly. There was a strong sweet, grape like smell. The taste was heavy, a bit warm, and on the sweeter side. The raisins can easily be picked up. It was deffently more of a sipping beer. Overall Gravitation is a good beer, close to a barley wine in flavor, but still very enjoyable."
"M- Medium CO2, a touch of stickiness."
""
"Overall this is the best beer I encountered from the big beer series. Massive ABV, smooth taste, and great flavor for under 6 bucks. Almost beats out Victory - V12 but I enjoy that beer in it's own right. Will have to give a bottle to my brother since he like Quads. Definitely consider getting it again. Drink it cold if you can!"
""
""
""

"Bomber from Half Time poured a clear reddish amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, toffee, plum, raisin, pear, banana and light spice. Palate was medium to full bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of toffe, carmel, dark fruit and light spice with a smooth dry warming lingering toffee finish."
"Poured into a chimay goblet. There's a pork and pickle sandwich next to it too, yum. It's murky, amber, and has a tiny head dissipating into a broken ring. I smell a bunch of sweet fruits and heavy booze. Everyone else is saying they used raisin puree in this beer and I have an easy time believing this. It's also obvious with every sip that this is 12%abv. Sometimes my sip tastes like jam on toast, but sometimes it tastes like paint. If I swish it around in my mouth it feels like I took a hit of some pop rocks, which I guess is sort of cool. Overall I don't regret picking this up, but I'm not very stoked about it. I don't think it does belgian quads justice, but at least it tastes good with my hot pork."
""
""
"It has that belgian fruity malty yeasty thing going but good. Not much is disguised or subtle. It works better than some other recent tastes, which leads me to wonder what it would be like if I set a couple of these aside for a year, which I think I will do."
""
""
"O- Does the job well, but could use a little more personality."
"O: It was ok, the alcohol presence made it very difficult to drink, and got worse as it warmed. The flavors were ok, the raisin puree overpowered a lot of it I think though."
""
"Rich syrupy palate enhances the raisin and pruney fruits flavors of this beer. The middle to finish brings out that fruity pound cake, toasted malt flavor along with a well integrated alcoholic heat on the finish. Great nightcap sipper."
"It's a beautiful color and has a strong fruity scent but is overwhelmingly boozy and taste too strong of alcohol. A bit too complex and strong for this hop seeker."
""

""

"O: Definitely worse than The Reverend, but it's still pretty decent. Like stated before, it's an interesting experiment. It's not really a great example of a quad, but I'm glad I tried it. Not for the faint of heart, but at $6 per bottle, there really isn't any reason not to try it if you haven't before."
"This is a decent enough quad but it doesn't stand up to the giants of the style (Pannepot and the various Trappist quads). Still, if you see a bottle available, it would be an interesting experiment in cellaring."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark mahogany brown with a fairly thick pale tan head. Strong aroma has fruity, caramel, butterscotch and woody notes with hints of molasses and licorice. Whoa, that is one strong flavor, jumping on the taste buds with banana, apple, caramel and malt notes plus hints of wood, butterscotch, horehound and wood. It is fairly sweet, but not cloying, and has quite a strong alcohol bite. Lively, edgy texture has near-full body and leaves a sweet, fruity, slightly candy-like finish. Let this beer's gravitational field draw you in! ;)"
"O: Maybe a couple of years on this bottle would work wonders, but as is, it's a mess. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone, especially not as an introduction to Quads. I wouldn't want anyone thinking this is what a Belgian quad should taste like."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a decent beer, but not an outstanding one of the style. It felt a little unbalanced to me at times with the sweet, malty flavors being a little too dominant. Overall a pretty decent tasting beer but not outstanding in the style."
"Equally rich flavors, some velvety maltiness and dried fruits like dates, banana, sultanas. Nutty almond, walnut, and pecan flavors too. Feel is rich, medium bodied with lower carbonation. Dry finish with lingering toffee and raisin/sultana flavors. Not at all cloying. Alcohol does creep up a bit, leaving a warming sting. This eventually limits drinkability, but it's likely best shared anyway. $7 bomber is a deal."
"Smuttynose Gravitation Quadrupel is a fantastic beer with a noticeable raisin aroma. Served at Tap & Mallet of Rochester in a 8.5 oz glass had a very thin head and a deep burgundy color. On the nose the first aromas are of raisins, and molasses. At 12% ABV the first taste warns you that this is a high alcohol beer. Soon afterwards, the flavors of raisins, molasses, and a hint of honey lull you into a false sense that the alcohol is not that high. This beer in the mouth gives you a slight effervensce and syruppiness. I really love this beer!"
"Served with a nice, tan, thick, foamy head that subsides after a bit to a ring and islands. Color is a hazy dirty copper. Aroma is malt, fruit, yeast, caramel, toffee. Flavor is massively malt/fruit sweet with a little bitterness and very little carbonic tang. Body is full, round, lush but carbonation is kinda flat. Finish is like flavor with a big alcohol warming factor."
"Pours a dark brown color w/ a thin one finger cocoa head. The head quickly goes down to a sliver. Decent lacing on my snifter glass as well. This beer isn't a black hole, and you can see the carbonation swirling around when held to the light. In the nose I get caramel malt, raisin, date, fig. Pretty tasty smelling, although not quite in the realm of the best in style. The thing I'm missing in this brew is belgian yeast- it's like a gaping hole in an otherwise solid brew. Taste is the same as the nose, with the raisins and figs really coming out. Slight alcohol burn on the aftertaste, but I like that in big beers. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin/dry side for what I'd like, but it's not bad. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew. Definitely not a world class Quad, but I enjoyed it. Cheers."
"Definitely better at room temperature. Full flavored and full bodied. The 12% ABV demands; SIP ME! Personally, I think the raisins meld perfectly with this Belgianh ale. As Emeril would say: Kick it up a notch!"
"It seems my sample performed quite differently from other reviewers. Fresher, or reformulated maybe?"
"Overall, I am not sure I got the experience I was looking for. Generally, I relish the taste of a good beer, but I also like the story that goes with it. By that, I like it when you can tell a brewery has had some fun and let the creative juices flow when putting together their product. This is why Stone products, to me, are enjoyable."
"OK, YOU CAN DO BETTER!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Overall, Smuttynose makes a fine beer here but it's hard to compare this quad with the likes of Rochefort, St. Bernardus, and Pannepot. Still, at $6 a bomber its a nice bold and boozy beer to sip on for a while."
"overall it's a an decent beer but an average american quad, and would probably fall to below average if you stack it against all quads (read: belgians). ok drinkability as it is moderately enjoyable, just doesn't compare to the kings in the style the rochefort 10s, abt 12s, or westys of the world."
"Poured into my Duvel VIJF 20 oz large tulip. Very attractive dark ruby, with a half inch of mellow off white head, minimal lacing. Crazy banana, clover, dark fruits, raisin mostly, hard candy, and some booze. Taste is all that and very pungent. Not a huge fan of style, but this is a solid version for my taste. I like this beer, but not easy drinking at all."
"O: Only my second quad. I liked it, but wouldn't want more than 4-6 oz at a time in the future, and the only other quad I've ever had (Brewery Ommegang's) was better. Definitely share this one with friends. Way too much to have on your own, especially given that it's only available in bombers."
"I have a 2009 vintage bottle in my cellar, and since Sat night was a special occasion and a hurricane rolled into one, I decided to open it. Still a ton of carbonation left. Popped the cap, and the foam slowly crept to the top and just dribbled over the top. Poured into the chalice glass very slowly to avoid overflow. Crisp bubbly carbonation, like soda. Dark garnet ruby color. Good head and nice amount of lacing. The aroma just fills your nose with cherry. The taste was quite sweet. Flavors of dark fruit were striking - cherry, fig, plum, and raisins. Very sugary also, which took away from the mouthfeel a bit. It was thick and somewhat cloying on the palate. But overall I liked this beer. I remember when this beer first came out, people were saying this beer was too hot with the abv and needed some aging. After two years, it certainly mellowed out a bit without losing any flavor. This was a nice beer on a rainy night paired with a chocolate dessert."
"o - Overall a very good beer. Very tart cherry now, especially in the taste. Not sure how it is fresh, but this batch is tasting awesome. Had 2 glasses of it and would like to try it again."
"Obviously, at 12% this is a bit much to chug, but it's a nice slow sipper. I love Smuttynose and have loved the Big Beer series thus far. This isn't one of the all-time great quads, but it's still very good."
"I've become a big fan of Smuttynose Brewing Company. Unfortunately, Gravitation is not one of Smuttynose's finer moments. In fact, it's their worst beer that I've encountered. The biggest problems here are the complete lack of Belgian yeast and the overbearing alcohol. Those aren't small mistakes when it comes to brewing a Belgian Quad. As a result, this is a very average take on the style. This one needs a bit of work."
"Notes: I've had this beer before, and I could swear it was totally different this time around (and this was after the recipe change and hike-up to 12% abv). This is an under- carbonated, cloying, boozy mess. And that's after about 8 months of cellar time too. The first time I had it I probably would have rated it a solid B+. I don't know if I got an off bottle or what, but this was pretty terrible. I might have to re-visit it, but I'm kind of dreading that prospect. This is the first beer by Smuttynose that I did not enjoy."
"This beer was a big disappointment for me. After all, I love Smutty, and I never could have expected that they could produce something bad. But this is not a good beer. It's not a good representation of the quad style, and it just tastes like nasty grape jelly. Still, it's better than drinking a Corona."
"D: Surprisingly, this beer is very drinkable for the style and its high amount of alcohol content--the body isn't very heavy and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Exactly what I wanted when I cracked this bottle. Rich, thick and decadent. I wasn't prepared for such a syrupy brew, but I managed. What it lacks in dimension, it makes up for in satisfaction."
"Terrific Quad, Gravitation is packed with flavor and enough complexity to impress. Well worth a go, it more than holds its own as a fine representative of the style. One of the best offerings from Smuttynose."
"Exciting mix of flavors, absolutely delicious, but too strong for regular consumption."
"Pours a somewhat-strange purplish-red color with a bit of muddiness in there. Bit of a creamy head with some moderate lacing. The nose is actually quite nice with a good amount of sweetness, booze, and dark fruits. A bit of molasses there as well. The taste falls back a bit from here and doesn't offer all that much. A bit of alcohol. The body is fairly full with low-ish levels of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Nothing really stands out in this one, though there aren't any glaring defects either."
"Poured a deep amber/brown in my St. Bernardus goblet, a brief beige head topped the liquid with no lace. Swirled and poured the sediment in as well, but it was quite clear before that. Aroma is very nice. Hint of cocoa, lots of caramel and deep dark fruit. Fairly complex, with notes of toffee, dates, and figs. Nice alcohol to balance the flavor and aromas. Beautifully carbonated, mellow and smooth. A medium bodied beer that leaves a light coating over the palate. Sweet finish that brings out the caramel. Hint of warmth from the alcohol. Very well made and it has aged gracefully."
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation up front and an overly sweet, estery dark fruit flavor that is a bit cloying. Slightly earthy with sublte hops and spice as well as hints of raisin, grape and dark cherry. There's a prominent malt backbone that provides decent balance but this beer kind of reminds me of grape soda."
"Far from my favorite Smuttynose brew, and I've had many better Quads. But, for $5.50 a bottle it's still a solid beer."
"D - This has pretty good drinkability. It is a slow sipper for sure, but I think it's pretty easy going. I like this more than I thought I would after reading some of the reviews on here. I am glad I picked this one up, and I recommend trying it."
"D - Told Alex to finish it off, I got through about half of one glass. Too hot, too bad tasting, just not a good beer. The search for the great American quad continues."
"D - It was a struggle for Mike and I to finish this, although I eventually manned up and got the job done. Not something I would have again, although there is a serious dearth of good American quads."
"D - Really good quad. Alc isn't that well hidden, but it works. Really enjoyable and easy to drink."
"an amber beer with the gravity that is visible in the way the bottles are trying to work there way to the surface. about 5 seconds delayed of about three finger nails worth. nose of booze and apple brown sugar. palate of raisin and metal that fades over time... apple and burnt clove. hurts the teeth so much sugar and poor body. nothing worth trying from a otherwise pretty successful lineup."
"Served from 22 oz. bottle into Chimay Goblet"
"Not something I could drink a whole lot of, but is something that could be split and sipped on for a while. Too sweet for my liking and that says alot."
"A 22oz bottle is impossible to finish: I doubt I could even finish a 12oz'er. Sweet, cloying, sticky, chewy; like a liquefied jam. Not enjoyable and not acceptable. I need to see my dentist, STAT."
"Drinkability- very easy to drink but don't plan on drinking more than one of these"
"Drinkability is not good at all. A couple ounces of this beer is plenty, 22 oz is way too much unless you are drinking with a group. Tons of alcohol in the flavor, doesn't hide it at all."
"D: Not all that enjoyable. Way too sweet, impossible to finish a glass. Drinks like the Sarafijn Donker from Bruwerij Achilles, or a super-sweet nut-brown ... neither of those are compliments."
"Drinkability- i actually really enjoy some aspects of this flavor profile though its definitely got a bit of heat and bit boozy at this stage, but the malt flavor to me up front is quite enjoyable, i do like this beer but its very strong and far from fast drinker, a good beer not great at this point but decent"
"This is a nice beer. Definitely something to drink in a snifter, though, after dinner with a friend. An excellent dessert."
"Drinkability is low, due to the ABV of 12% and little else flavorwise going on. I'd have to say it does not live up to a Belgian quadrupel in flavor; only in the alcohol blitz which, unlike Belgian quads, is not matched by a diversity of interestingly complex flavors. Maybe it would be better for Smuttynose to just say it is a raisin beer, like Dogfish Head's Raisin D'extra--but that would not garner any extra points either. It begs the question: Why do people not like raisin beers? Are raisins too foreign an adjunct to beer?"
"S- Well, my room smells pretty good right now. But in the glass this beer is pretty weak. Its g"
"I wasn't super impressed with this one, which is a shame because I typically have really enjoyed the Smutty Big Beer Series. This one whiffs though at the style. Pours a murky dark brown with very little head that recedes to a small ring around the glass. Fruity aroma, big on the grape/raisin/date aromas, some sticky malt to back it up. Taste is a one note raisin flavor, largely unsupported by other elements. Where's the character? Sweet, sticky, one-note. Not exactly my expectation of a Quad, undercarbonated as well. This one should be pillowy, but it falls flat, just being sticky in the mouth. Ok drinkability, though it is very sweet, and ultimately not very interesting. I love the Smutty BBS, but this one misses."
"Thick and brown, but this is not the best representative of my favourite style. A certain richness from the raisins, but not overly complex. Still good drinkability.Maybe this is unfair, but men should not consume raisins as it is not easy to get rid of the iron."
"Pours a slightly murky brown with little head. What head there is fades away to a very thin ring. Smells extremely fruity with cherry, plum, and raisin notes. The taste is similar, but with a brown sugar sweetness throughout as well. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and slightly sweet. Not bad, but a little simplistic."
"We're major Smutty fans across the board, so it pains us deeply to criticize, but this is nowhere near a Belgian Quad. Unfortunately, everyone will compare this to a Quad, as that's what they call it on the label and they failed to mention the most unique ingredient used in the beer--raisin purée! That said, kudos for creating something innovative."
"Drinkability: A damn tasty sipper, one that's more spicily balanced than anything. This isn't authentic, of course, but it seems like they don't want it to be with the raisins, and that combination with the yeast yields pretty awesome results. Undoubtedly, I'd hope, this would hold up well for a few years, and if I can find it, I'll be snagging at least another bottle or two to cellar for sure."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky, juicy, sugary, and syrup like in the swallow. A bit of booze found in this one. I could only imagine what an aged sample would complex in 5, 10, even 15 years. Grandiose!"
"Pours a fairly clear ruby color with thin off-white head, couple of blobs of lace. Smell: dark brown sugar, raisin, date. Not particularly complex but it's pretty intense. Taste: caramel, raisin, date, plum skin. Raisin definitely shows up along with a semi-tart plum skin. Again pretty straightforward but good, and not all that sweet which is a bonus. I'd be happy with a little softer feel. May 2010 release."
"Flavor-wise this reminds me more of a dubbel than a quad (of course the sneaky ABV says otherwise), but still a solid Belgian-influenced beer (if not quite on par with their farmhouse ale)."
"Quite the big beer and definitely not something to knock back quickly. This beer is meant to be sipped and savored. I like it but this is definitely a beer you have to be in the mood for."
"D--I like this beer. I also like that I can get a bomber of this at my local bottle shop for 6.99, not a steal but good buy for a solid quad."
"Notes: Belgian Strong Dark Ales and Quadrupels are two of my favorite styles and this one did not disappoint."
"My pour created a finger of deep-tan head with decent retention. The nose had a yeasty, musty odor with an underlying sweetness. Color was a beautiful ruby-red with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with a really sugary taste on the tongue, along with fruity esters of apples, grapes and bananas. Finish had a flavor and mouthfeel like cocoa powder. My housemate really dug it, but I found it to be a bit sweet."
"Overall this isn't quite up there with the big boys as far as the style goes but it's a solid take. Worth a shot."
"Overall, a pretty decent quad. Good price on the bomber. Lots of solid traits coming from this one. Why a bomber though? Split it and you'll be fine, but a bomber solo on this one is way too much."
"Gravitiation is it's name. Perhaps gravity really was at work here, and what went up (Smuttynose Big Beer Series) eventually fell back down. At any rate, I expect a bit more from these guys and just didn't see it here. A bit less focus on the raisins and a bit lower ABV would make this much more tolerable. It comes off like a homebrewer's poor attempt at a Trappist 10 or 12."
"Pours a dark brown with very little head. Smell of raisins and dried fruit is very strong, with some of the Belgian yeast coming through. Flavour has lots of raisin and cherry, with maybe a hint of chocolate. Carbonation seemed to be a little bit weak for the style. Not one of my favourite quads, but still a really nice beer."
"Thin and very temporary layer of brown foam across the surface, ends up with an aggregation of large bubbles huddled against the glass sides, zero lacing. Amberish orange with as much brown to it as red, mild gauziness, the rims turn a glowing yellow. The nose is the joining of two opposite poles, on one side banana, molasses, butterscotch, caramel and fig, golden raisin, red apple, peach, red cherry fruit scents, then peat moss, black pepper, rye, dried straw and bitter coffee grounds, not much ""lift"" into your nostrils but does have good length. Medium and close to full-bodied, has the sweetness and and clingy qualities, just not the ability to sink deeply into your mouth pores. Molasses, brown sugar, caramel, milk chocolate distinct without getting too sweet, lemon and orange peel and apricot, peach, golden raisin, fig and date flavors likewise full yet not sugary. Ginger, cumin spices, tar, forest underbrush dry things out more, one might suggest that the weak carbonation hurts the sweetness, doesn't get the sugar zipping about. The thing is, it comes across as noncommittal, like it wants to go in a direction more decisively but then relents. Nothing horrible but there needs to be more flavor intensity as well as thrust through the finish."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best because of the ABV and weight, but I really like the various aspects of this beer and Smuttynose's interpretation of the style. Kudos to them."
"Poor Icharus. This beer pours a foggy blood-amber topped by...well, there's not really a head here, more a mere rump congregation of disparate bubbles. And things begin not with a bang, but a whimper... The nose comprises raisins, figs, nutmeg, rye bread, and a pinch of brown sugar. If these smells were more pronounced, things would be better, but at least we're moving in the right direction now. These elements are all there on the tongue, as well, joined by a healthy booziness and some light cranberries. It's like biting into a slighty toasted Fig Newton that's been dipped in some schnapps. It's good, but not all that much in the grand scheme of quads. The body is a very heavy medium, bordering on a light heavy, with a light carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, a decent quad, but not very high above average at all. A disappointment, to be sure."
"D - Not what I was expecting, not an ideal but rather mediocre quad. However, I find it rather enjoyable as I sit here after a long day at work."
"I was definitely let down by this beer. I am not sure how it would age, but the alcohol burn of this beer was just too much to take. I love other Smuttynose offerings (especially the IPA), but this did not work for me. At first I enjoyed it, but then the harsh alcohol burn took control of the beer and ruined it for me. I am not sure if this is a bad batch or what, but I won't be seeking this beer out again."
"7.5 weeks until Belgium (and hopefully a crate of Westy's)!"
"Good enough beer, but there are a lot of quads I'd reach for first, & plenty of Smutty brews, too."
"Notes: Super boozey. Much better than 2009, miles better - BUT still not a great beer. No sense of balance and a little one-note-y with the banana/clove bit."
"From the Big Beer series - 2010 batch. Sampled on July 3, 2010. The color of the pour is mainly amber brown but if you hold it to the light you get a purplish hue, which I found to be fascinating. The head is about a half-inch thick, silky, and beige. It does not last long. The aroma has a bit of yeast, breads, and thin malts. I was a little disappointed that I did not get the fruitiness that is so often associated with Belgian style ales. The mouthfeel is heavy and oily. The taste tends to lean bitter with a faint yeasty background. But the alcohol zips into my sinuses and burns its way down my throat. I can feel it move downward in there. It is easy to drink but given it's higher ABV, it is also easy to lighten your head by."
"I'll keep it short and sweet because I didn't write down a full review at all. Smelled and tasted of fruit punch that had been spiked at a high school prom. Highly medicinal, tart dark fruit. Boozy and not very enjoyable, missing the excellent balance and complexities of the Belgian quads. Mouthfeel is way too thin for the style as well. The price is low at least. Smuttynose is usually stellar and I know quad must be a tough style to brew. I did have this right after Speedway Stout, I would give it another shot."
"D- The appearance and nose were a little off for me, but the taste was really impressive; very well balanced and enjoyable."
"mouthfeel is fine but feels a bit thin and flat compared to some of my other favorite quads. drinkability is a real big issue here as even having a full pint is a real struggle with the alcohol dominating."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights, and a thin tan head that retains as well as you could expect from a 12% beer. The aroma kicks it up a notch with big dark fruits upfront (notes of blackberry, cherry, grape and plum), along with cane and candy sugar, toasted bread, funky esters, a little white peppercorn, and a little alcohol. The flavor starts out with dark fruits as well, with notes of strawberry jam, raspberry, grape, and blueberry, along with a massive sugary sweetness, along with some funky esters, honey wheat bread, and a big alcohol wallop. The mouthfeel is velvety and drinkability is bordering on bad. This is a decent quad, but it's a little under-attenuated (even at 12%) and thus too sweet and one dimensional."
"22oz bottle into a Smuttynose Big Beer Series tulip glass pours a crisp dark copper with a decent khaki head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is dried fruits, molasses and mild booze. The taste is a nice amount of dried fruits, extremely burnt caramel and molasses with a lingering dried fruit finish. The beer is certainly a heavy sipper, but it's still quite enjoyable. This is a very enjoyable Quad, one I'd love to have again."
"Smuttynose Gravitation is a cloudy red-brown ale with a dense, pale yellow head that dissipates. It has a fruity aroma with notes of pear, apple, clove and raisin. It's full bodied and smooth with a light, dry finish. It's a little sweet and a little bitter. It tastes resiny and spicy, fruity, raisiny and, most of all, wooden. It has a bitter, resiny aftertaste. This is not for chugging. It's reasonably complex and satisfying."
"Alcohol becomes more and more prominent the more I drink. I do not see this getting better with age, it is already too sweet. I think Smutty needs to axe this one, and get a better style to fit in the rotation of the Big Beer Series."
"D: Although not my favorite quad, this is still a drinkable example of the style."
"pours a ruby brown redish color with spare to no head, spare to no lacing and soft flat carbonation. spiceness and fruity hints apparent in smell and taste. very tart with a sour bitter chalky finish. medium bodied with a thin slick texture. decent brew."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. The head is minimal, and the color is a deep brown tinged with red. The smell is fruity, with definite notes of Belgian yeast. The taste is sweet, powerful, with a slightly fruity taste and a highly alcoholic body. The mouthfeel is average; it's not terribly heavy, slightly syrupy, but not overly so. The drinkability is average; it certainly does not encourage quick drinking. Overall, I like this beer, although it might be a little too much. Definitely interesting, and worth trying. I haven't had many quads before, so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I like it."
"Murky dark Mahogany, reddish when held to the light. A decent little head but dissipatedly far too quickly. Smeel and taste were quite similar. Biscuits (sweet) fruitcake, candy sugar, dark fruit. This was a bit too sweet for me though as I found it almost Cloyingly sweet. Very decent mouthfeel, and if I was to have this as a night cap I could drink more as even with the sweetness it went down easy."
"Overall impression: Cellar-worthy? I'm not too optimistic. It doesn't taste ""raw", just really sweet. I'm not tasting lots of potential here. Still, I may tuck aside a bottle or 2 to see if I can prove myself wrong (review to be updated if that's the case)."
"Drinkability: Not really a quad and a bit too sweet and jammy to be really enjoyable; some recipe tweaking would be in order"
"I'm new to belgian style quadrupels, I generally shy away from the style, but this was an incredibly enjoyable brew, enough to keep me interested to try more quads in the future."
"Beer poured dark and hazy with ample head. The smell of the beer was figs all the way to me. Almost has the smell of a port wine. The taste came off much sweeter than I anticipated at first, but leveled off as I drank the beer. would I drink this beer again...yeah I would...is it on my list to pick up next week...no...too sweet. Felt like I should be drinking it with a cigar and some cheese."
"Interesting flavors here, true to the style visual's, taste and feel. Not my favorite style, but glad I picked this up."
"Drinkability: I was able to finish my 6oz. serving, but I didn't want anymore. This is the worst quad I've come across so far."
"Drinkability - at 8.5% abv, the booze is barely detectable, which makes for good drinking on a chilly night."
"The beer pours reddish-brown with a tan head. The aroma is brown sugar, dark fruit and caramel malt. The flavor is heavy on the raisins and is very sweet. There is also a lot of vanilla in the flavor. Other dark fruit is apparent as well. The beer is very sweet overall but doesn't really have any of the Belgian character you expect from a quadrupel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty good beer, but not really a classic quadrupel."
"D-this is a pretty big beer with very solid flavors and a nice complexity. It isn't really like a quad that much as but still a very tasty and smooth drinking beer"
"3/3/3.5/4/3.5"
"This is a fine beer, but lack of complexity in a Quad is holding it back. Additionally, the tartness is out of control, again beyond the range of a quad. Regardless, if you sit back, and let it mellow out with warmth, it is an enjoyable sipper."
"A full frothy two inch biscuity brown head is easily achieved with a strong pour. Body is a very deep dark woodsy brown tone. The nose gives you tones of vanilla, banana bread and an alcoholic twinge, very sweet. The taste follows the nose almost to a T with big but mellow and creamy malty sweetness. The banana bread and real vanilla tones really comes through. This really is super sweet bordering on to much. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and very sweet. Could use a bit of a spice profile and some more carbonation. Drinkability is slightly hurt by the big cloying sweetness."
"HV"
"Overall I think this is a decent beer, but due to its sweetness is a bomber you're better off sharing with a friend. For some reason my wife loves this beer, so I picked up as much as I could before the next round of Big Beers rolled in. Happy wife = fewer scowls when thy beer budget runneth over. Glad to see Smutty is bringing this one back in 2010."
"Smuttynose Gravitation pours a brown color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma isn't very impressive, just a bit of fruit. The flavor has a pretty good amount of dark fruit. Perhaps a bit one dimensional, no real Belgian yeast flavors. Overall, I quite enjoyed this one."
"Flavor is close to the verge of raisin overkill. Reminds me of Founders Bad Habit Quad. Candi sweetness, boozy...and just overall sweet. Mild complexity and smooth."
"This beer has that old soy saucy type flavor from being around too long, so I can't do a serious review of it. There's a touch of spice in the taste, but overall the beer is just WAY too sugary sweet and not very complex. Pretty bad. Oh man, I just tried it again. It's so cloyingly sweet. The mouthfeel is pretty in par with quads, but suddenly you're hit with the overwhelming sweetness. Did I mention it was too sweet?"
"I gush with Smuttynose love."
"'ll be keeping several of these in the cellar for when I am in the mood for a quad and don't feel like dropping ten bucks or more on the table. The price make this such a great value that this beer is a wonderful find."
"Smuttynose Gravitation pours a dark red/brown with a nice light brown head. The aroma is dark fruit, heavy herbal hops, and sweet, chocolatey malt. The flavor is slightly bitter and shart upfront with some nice yeasty esters. It then quickly turns into rich, sweet and chocolatey flavor. The herbal and earthy hops are there, but dominated by the sweetness. I wouldn't have guessed raisins, it really tastes like sweet, creamy chocolate. Definitely a good start, but I would prefer it a little drier (I'm guessing that was their intention)."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep ruby, almost black color. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Dark fruit nose. Flavor is sweet dark fruit, hops way in background. Brown sugar finish. Sweeter than the typical quad. $5.49 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Drinkability - hides the hig abv well, I appreciatte the Belgian dark fruit notes..."
"The good thing about first efforts is that changes can be made. This January 2009 brew was an okay jumping off point, but the brewers need to do a little Belgian-style brewing homework before they pass the quadrupel test with flying colors. Here's hoping that Smuttynose recognizes Gravitation's shortcomings and makes the necessary tweaks. Thanks to biegaman for the bomber."
"Drinkability- Well... It's obviously WAY too sweet to sit back and enjoy thoroughly. Maybe with a bit of time it'll settle a bit but by then the bottles might be bombs. I think the flavor is okay and it's on the right track but until the sweetness subsides, stay away from. Thanks for sharing Adam!"
"D - One is enough."
"Although this is labeled a Belgian Quadrupel it reminded me (and arguably might more accurately fit the description) of a well-aged English Old Ale. Regardless of what the label says, whatever the brewery was aiming for they couldn't have missed their mark. A savory, fruity, flavourful, lip-lickingly sweet mid-range strength beer this certainly is - and that sits mighty fine with me whatever style it's considered. I'd buy it again."
"i dunno if this is really a quad.i feel like it should be labeled under belgian dark strong ale.either way,this is a nice beer to sip on.somewhat sweet,but it has enough going on to keep it interesting."
"a very drinkable all around good brew not a traditional style quadrupel it's just twisted a little ."
"The sharp carbonation with very small bubbles was very enjoyable. Light and refreshing, easily drinkable, I could hit this all day"
"Blipped ""Do you wanna get Heavy"" by Jon Spencer Blues Explosion."
"D: Decent drinkability, though drinks much bigger then advertised and is quite boozy and warming. A wonderfully creamy malting gives this an enjoyable feel going down though it took me a good hour to finish."
"I like sweet brews but this one was a little to much for me. I finished the bottle, but not looking for another. There are much better American Quads out there. Smutty dropped the ball on this one. To bad I really wanted to like this one but it just wasn't up to par in my book."
"Bottle. Pours a dark reddish brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of raisin, sweet malt, sweet dark fruits (plum, prune) and vegetal notes. Ick. Flavor is very very sweet with raisin and dark fruits. Sticky palate and rather carbonated. The flavor is not as bad as the aroma but still. This really is an awful quad though, with no similarities at all to the top Belgian quads."
"I usually adore Smutty's Big Beers. This is an aberration."
"A bit too sweet to be drinkable."
"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass (well more like two of them). Poured a dark brown with hints of red on the edges. Looked like there was some clarity to it when you hold it up to the light, but the color makes it tough to tell. Had about a 1/2"" head with many sized bubbles that was an off white color. There was some slight lacing but it doesn't last very long, trickles it's way down to the drink itself. I'm a little inexperienced with this type of beer, but I was pleasantly surprised with the aroma of this beer. Had a fruity aroma to it, particularly dark fruits, definitely raisins maybe figs or dates, finished by some malts at the end. The taste was very good. Could barely taste the alcohol in it at all. Mouthfeel was good, not too much of a carbonation bite to it. Started to drink it pretty cold and finished it in about 40 minutes, good cold and when it warmed up as well. Drinkablilty was good. All in all I enjoyed this, I may re-review this beer in the future or if I ever try it on tap."
"I'm glad I got a chance to try it but it isn't something that I would actively seek out."
"The dark brown pour would almost be black if it weren't for some diffuse shades of subtle red. A smallish tan head quickly fades and leaves a couple of spots of lace as evidence. Smells of dark fruits, sweet bread, phenols and some earthiness underneath it all. A bit of sourness is evident upon closer inspection. Tastes of sour dark fruits, grain, and more sweet bread. A nice alcohol heat warms the ending and some spices emerge later on. Fairly smooth going down, and I would say it's medium to heavy, but doesn't have a lot of weight on the stomach. A little hop bite would add dimensions to this brew, but I have no major complaints."
"Drinks alright, the dryness does slow me down though, along with too much figgyness. Not a bad effort, just didn't floor me"
"D: Will easily fit as a desert or with a meal beer. Multiple options with drinking this one."
"22oz bomber, bottle conditioned 2009, poured a deep amber with thick tan head. Raisins are very evident here and are likely the sweetest part of this brew. Dare I say it's too sweet. My lips are actually sticky from drinking it. The flavor is very nice but I was looking for more from the malt and even the yeast since it's a Belgian style. Not a bad beer by any stretch but it didn't meet my expectations overall. Hints of plums and raisins in the smell and flavor and that's about all I'm getting. I just don't find it to be very well balanced."
"Clear body of auburn. Thin beige head. Lacing is sporadic and spotty. This beer really smells good. Thick, doughy, bready malt base. Cinnamon and ginger accents. Just a real full nose. Solid flavor. Bread pudding malt base. Again, I get ginger and cinnamon spicing. Plum, raisin, fig. Alcohol is held in check. Solid quad, but nothing real special. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and overall impression too sweet for a quad."
"D - A little too sweet for my tastes but some nice ripe fruit flavors come out as it warms up. Much more roasty when it is cold."
"A very nice big beer, didn't notice a huge alcohol presence. I and my fellow drinkers could not get away from the blueberry taste, but that may be our inexperienced palate. Although it didn't make the beer any less enjoyable."
"Overall, a good quad, but by no means the best I have ever had. Lots of flavor but lacking in balance."
"drinkability is pretty good. while a bit on the sweet side, it's fairly well balanced and hides its alcohol well. even approaching room temperature i'm not having any trouble finishing it. if they dialed back on the sweetness just a little it'd be really great."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost brown away from the light, thin light tan head forms, quickly settles to a thing ring around the glass, a few lace spots sticks, looks alright. Smell is neat, more like a bock than a quad, raisins, some caramel/brown sugar, biscuits, very bready, lots of dark fruit, something kind of citrusy and floral, not what I think of when I think of quad, just doesn't have that character. Taste is very sweet, lots of raisins, iron, brown sugar/caramel, iced tea, almost cloying, lots of fruit juice, some alcohol, dates, biscuity and dry in the finish, almost feels like my teeth are rotting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol is hidden relatively well, but just insanely sweet and cloying. Very sugary finish, just doesn't seem like much of a quad, and too sweet to be very enjoyable regardless of adherence to style. Thanks Russ!"
"bomber from Whole Foods Reston a few months ago"
"Probably not something to drink a lot of in one sitting, but definitely a nice and interesting change of pace. Very pleasing -"
"This is a fine crafted quad, drinkable but strong while bringing something different to the table."
"this beer pours a nice clear mahogany color with a tan head that recedes to a ring of lace rather quickly. the aroma brings a lost of roasted character with a bit of the promised yeast. the taste brings the yeast through and through. the roasted character takes kind of a back seat. the full mouthfeel and the warmth make the mouthfeel quite nice, not a bad big beer."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice roasted character with some rainsy aroma. It's dry with some warming in the nose. The taste is decent as well. It has a rich, roasted character with some Belgian yeast esters in the finish. It's not like most quads on the market. It's borderline imperial stout/barleywine. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with some prickly carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but I'm not too high on the malt bill."
"Rich but balanced, well-made and quite a treat. I never read reviews of beers I'm reviewing until after I've reviewed myself, but looking at the composite ""B" before I headed in and comparing that with what I'm tasting, I'm wondering if this is just a particularly outstanding batch, if it's aged just the right amount of time (although this is fairly young, bottle-conditioned just this year) or if that whole ""everybody's palate is different"" thing is truly the bottom line for interpreting Gravitation. As far as I'm concerned, it's yet another great beer in the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. Don't skip it!"
"Taste is brown sugar, malts, raisins. Mouthfeel is rich with a lot of flavors on my palate, abv does show itself on the aftertaste, this is a sipper. This is a good beer overall, glad that I tried it."
"D - A sipper in any respect. It would be better to share the bomber, maybe even 3-5 ways in very small glasses, but I am going to finish it."
"Mouthfeel is rich and complex. Drinkability is ok for such a strong and sweet tasting beer. I split the bomber and that was just enough for one session."
"I felt the booziness almost immediately. It was a good quad. I recommend it."
"In summary, a QUAD should have a lot of malt, but the key is to balance that power with flavor and complexity. Aside from tasting like prune juice, this beer is NOT complex. While I appreciate the extreme take on a beer, and the daring attempt to make raisens cool again, I just did not like it at all. It reminds me of my friend who tried to homebrew with berries, and he did not cut back on the malt... it just tasted defective."
"D-This is quite enjoyable....borders on being a little too sweet but I like it.."
"D- If you're into grapes and raisins, this is the brew for you. I see the description says this is made with 200lb's of raisin and it sure resembles that.Tastes like a fruit mash. Not enjoyable, I couldn't finish this. Smuttynose hasn't impressed me.. I think I'll stay clear of them after this."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber mahogany with a medium tan head with no lacing. Good color,but the heads alittle small. The smell is light with some dark fruit and alcohol. The taste is rich with creamy roasted malt,bread yeast,dark fruit,and alcohol. The m/f is heavy and all the flavors mix pretty well. This is a quality beer from one of my favorite New England breweries."
"M/D - Very sticky mouth feel after each sip welcomes the next one! The only downside is that it is so filling it is hard to finish."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with tan head. It smelled like dry earthy chocolate malt and sour but creamy yeast, with some fig and whole wheat, and a bit of alcohol. It tasted like sweet raisins and honey wheat, with some creamy yeast and a bit of salty and sour lemons. It was somewhat thick with moderate carbonation, and had a tangy aftertaste. Overall this seemed like a blend of a dubbel with an old ale, but not really a quad. It had good flavor, but wasn't quite fitting for the style. It had good body too, but it didn't have the silky refinement of most true Belgian quads. It didn't have too much complexity either, although the alcohol was hidden decently, so it was fairly easy to drink. This was an interesting beer, and enjoyable, but it can't compete with the better quads."
"D: This is a very nice beer, they do a good job of capturing the Belgian aspect of the style, not as complex as some. No hint of the alcohol, could be dangerous. I don't think I would reach for a second one, but I would happily buy this again next year. Recommended."
"The beer was dark red in color, and looked good despite a head smaller than typical for the style. The smell was a mix of dark skinned fruits and spices, but was not as strong as most other beers of this style. The taste was much simpler than I like, as the fruit juice like sweetness was dominant over other tastes. There wasn't much spiciness or bitterness present to counterbalance the pleasing but one dimensional flavor. The beer also felt oddly thin in the mouth. I'd say that this is a couple steps behind the other Smuttynose big beers I've sampled thus far."
"Good stuff, but not amazing. I think, very much unfairly, that my view of this beer is affected by my having had Boulevard BBQ recently. Yes, different variations of the style, but BBQ was much more complex, subtle, less sweet and more drinkable. Still, check this beer out."
"D: Pretty nice to sip on, although a touch too sweet for my taste. It could use a spicier character in my opinion. This reminds me a lot of Dogfish Head's Raison d'Etre, although Gravitation is more focused and complex. An interesting change-of-pace beer, but too sweet for regular consumption."
"Overall I thought this was outstanding. Easily one of the smoothest and most drinkable I have run across in the style. I guess when taken into context it is a bit off from some of the big Quads out there, but I really feel that this was very, very well done."
"The taste is really, really smooth. This is a full bodied sipping beer that is sessionable, but I don't think I would venture in that direction. The taste is full of raisins, liqueur sweetness, maybe some brandy flavors, maybe a touch of fennel. This is a complex enough beer with a mouthfeel that is quite light. There isn't much aftertaste and only the slightest throatiness on the very back end. This one is quite good."
"22 oz. Dark ruby/amber pour. Fairly large off white head, but does disappear fairly quickly to a ring. Does stick to the glass a bit. Lots of brown sugar and malt in the aroma. Taste is almost cloyingly sweet at first. Brown sugar, raisin, candied plum or dark fruit of some sort. Some biscuity body. As it warms up the candied sweetness fades and is more malty/molasses sweet. Lively enough mouthfeel. Not really any hop presence in this throughout. Not my fave, but certainly above the average and drinkable on a descently warm spring night."
"d - ABV only hits at the end. Good masking overall but a heavy beer to session. Kinda harsh on the finish until you adjust to it."
"M + D: It's got just the lightest sparkle, and a bit of a slippery, slightly sticky feel. A little bigger bodied, but not really big or rich. It's a decent sipper, but it continues to be quite sweet and doesn't really mellow as it warms or anything, so it's a slow goer. Not a bad beer overall, but something doesn't seem quite right."
"Very good beer. Not as good as many quads, but a good drinking beer none the less."
"Edit: and on reading other reviews, no, I'm a bit surprised. I mean, it's like they weren't drinking the same beer I was! What's up with that?"
"Pours a nice dark amber brown color with a small that's gone quickly leaving very sparse lacing that barely clings to the side of the glass. Smell is dark and sugary, toasty malts, chocolate, yeast, and light dab of alcohol. Taste is very sweet upfront, lots of chocolate and candied fruits, apples, brown sugar, and a nice breadiness backed up by a nice Belgian yeast strain and a warming dry alcohol finish. Mouthfeel smooth, while alcohol is detectable it isn't overpowering. Nice sipping beer. I enjoyed this bomber to myself and drank the whole the thing over the course of an hour or two and loved every drop. Nice quad from an impressive East Coast brewery. Thanks again Keith!"
"But the alchohol doesn't intrude, its just peeping thru. Overall a little to sweet for me. Never a big fan of raisins, so I think thats what puts me off this one a little."
"D- I'm enjoying this beer as it satisfies the desire to find something different in a craft beer. It has a unique flavor and it's not overpowering. The alcohol is there but there is no burn or bite."
"D: Pretty easy drinking given the alcohol content, I think I actually like this one better than Dogfish Rasion D'etre"
"The nose is too sweet, it's got fruit (raisins, figs, dark fruit in general), syrup, malt, yeast, and toffee. The appearance is deep amber with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is a tad thin but OK. Overall it's a very decent beer but cloyingly sweet."
"D: I can't drink this."
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a huge light brown foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry fruit (figs and raisins) with some rum notes and some candi sugar. Taste is a well balance mix between some candi sugar, some dry fruits and some rum notes with a great malt backbone. Body is little bit hint for the style with good carbonation and no hints of alcohol. Very well done but I thought the candu sugar was a little bit too upfront and some additional body would have brought this to classic level."
"D- I'm enjoying this beer quite a bit. The alcohol is definitely there in the taste, but the beer is surprisingly smooth. Gravitation is a beer that I would definitely purchase again. Recommended."
"No matter what you think going into the beer, clear out an hour, it's a sipper."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear reddish copper brew. Head lasts quite well, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet, fruity, heavy on the booze. Taste follows the nose, with the alcohol close a bit harsh. Mouthfeel is a little rough, and drinkability is limited by all of the above. This one's harsher than I would have expected from Smutty, made me think of The Beast. Seems way stronger than 8.5%abv. Your mileage may vary."
"The mouthfeel is excellent, this is an after dinner sipping beer to pair with a fine cigar. Like I said before, this is a belgian barleywine, I could sip on this for quite a while."
"Pours a ruby brown color with an average khaki colored head that settles into a light head. The aroma is pretty non-existant for a Quad, not much aroma at all. The taste is of grape juice, kind of sugary but not really, I dunno. Does not have the complexity of a good quad, not even close. The body is thin, no real dark fruit flavors or malt complexity. It doesn't taste bad, not at all, but just doesn't taste like a quad or belgian brew. Not sure if a belgian yeast strain was used or any candi sugar. Moderate feel, with fizzy carbonation; finishes sweet. If you are looking for a sweet old ale with fizzy carbonation, this might be for you. Doesn't really remind me of a belgian beer at all, just a sweet beer. I guess this is the first BIG BEER Serier beer that I am disappointed in, though, again, it doesn't taste bad."
"D: I'll be lucky to finish off the bomber. The sweetness coupled with the booze is almost too much."
"Bomber bottle, 2009 notched on the label. Pours very dark mahogany with a fairly quickly departing medium khaki head. A gentle swirl reveals strands of stringy lace. Nose is of ripe fruits. One sip reveals the oncoming problem with this beer...its sickly sweet, yikes...notes of sweet jam, and sugary malts. Usually a fan of the style but this lacks the interest and balance of the all stars of the style. The fact that I tried some Southampton Abbot 12 this afternoon did not bode well for this selection. Another sip confirms my feelings, too sweet for my liking. Doubt I would give this one another try"
"Drinkability: Whaddya know, that's pretty good. A lovely, sweet, fruity beer from the fine folks over at Smuttynose."
"As to drinkability, it's certainly impressive. It's readily accessible, if a little bit sweet at first, but then again, it is a kind of a sipper as well, and that sweetness IS balanced. The strength is present but not overwhelming; and it's rich enough and complex enough to keep you coming back to it time and time again. They could have easily gone overboard with this one, but instead they kept everything reigned in and focused, and that seems to be something that's kind of out-the-door with U.S. brewers these days. Superb!"
"Still, all things considered, this is a pretty tasty beer from Smuttynose. Not bad at all."
"Notes: It is not as big as my first impression of it was but it's decently drinkable. Cheers"
"D: Thick, heavy, somewhat syrupy, and with a flavor that isn't entirely appealing enough to make me desire an entire 22oz. Although I'm enjoying it, I'm glad I'm splitting this with my wife."
"D- Ok, a very mild brew.. It goes down easy but definitely a disappointment for a quad. This is like an overly sweetened dubbel."
"Mouthfeel is a bit slick for my liking. I prefer my quads to be a bit more carbonated, but overall a good drinking beer and another great offering from Smuttynose. So glad that they've finally made it to Florida!"
"Pours with a brownish red color and a fairly insignificant head. Some caramel and spice notes come through on the aromas. It weighs heavy in the mouth with classic belgian flavors and a hint of coriander; but goes down clean and smooth. A great find. Now I gotta go find some more"
"Drinkability: Very good. An excellent sippin' beer. While its on the sweet side and not overall balanced, it still is very appealing. Interesting mouth feel."
"Taste is very creamy and slick, very very slick and buttery, good maltiness with a strong banana presence, strong carbonation prickles the mouth in a good way, pretty sweet and candied."
"A pretty beer in a goblet. Reddish/brown color with a modest size white head. An aroma of raisin bread, fruity, and a whiff of alcohol. A taste of dark fruit, and bready, making it a fairly chewy beer. A little too much on the sweet side, but still a nice beer."
"Notes - The drinkability take a little hit because there's an aspect of the sweetness I don't really care for, and for the thickness of the brew."
"I can see ""mixed opinions"" here. So, I would recommend splitting with a friend before going it alone. Also, aging might take some of the raw heat off, which would probably be helpful."
"Pours a very nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some dark fruits, slight yeast/spice. The taste is very nice of malts, figs, raisins, prunes, nice sweetness, very slight spice. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, thanks Matt."
"Taste - whoa, whats with all the residual sugar? This is the sweetest quad I've had and that's not a good thing. The overpowering sweetness overshadows whatever complexities reside in this beer. There may be a lot there but I just can't get past the sweetness and can't finish the bomber. It might not take more than a few tweaks to make this good and I hope the folks at Smuttynose rethink this one."
"22oz bomber from Shaw's. Pours a translucent dark copper body with a thin film of quickly dissipating tan head. Raisin, date, nut, brown sugar, with a touch of pith and citrus in the aroma. Raisin, date, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, toffee and coffee toward the finish. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Very drinkable for the style, abv, and complexity. A very good quad, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable for the style. Another slam-dunk from Smuttynose!"
"D: Not the most drinkable. I had around 7 ounces and by the end it was just too much sweetness."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent strong and flavorful Belgian beer to drink for a whole evening and yet another great beer in the Smuttynose Big Beer Series."
"Very sweet, low on the bitterness. A very drinkable Quad, definitely an American version. Though not as strong, the amount of malts are just as high. This one could probably be enjoyed from a pint glass. Recommended."
"drinkability - Not bad beer, worth a try, didn't wow me in any way."
"D - Very forward, overt sweetness keeps this beer from ever developing the subtleties that make a superb Quad into a work of art. Never really breaks out of average in any aspect. Would have fared just about as well as the other American Quads did in the tasting I had."
"Feel could be a bit thicker, but not too off base, carbonation keeps the sweetness at bay. Drinkability is very good, not sure if I would want another in one night, but I'm enjoying the hell out of this one."
"Had this at Track 84. Served in a tulip ($4 pour). Appearance was similar to grape cola, with a quarter inch off-white head that dissipated into a thin, fairly consistent slick. Nose was dark fruit - fairly subdued. Taste revealed dark fruit and cocoa. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and very effervescent, which placed it a little off-style in my opinion. This is a very flavorful quad. Perhaps lacking in some of the complexity associated with the style, but I applaud Smuttynose for the fact that they consistently put out great offerings. Well worth your time."
"This is quite easy to drink for the style and an excellent beer for the value. Smooth, delicious and dangerously drinkable."
"D: Good, but big, a little sweet."
"So I guess this is what 200lbs of raisins tastes like. I guess I can see that in hindsight. I wish the Sun Maid girl was here to help me finish it (she's kinda cute). Not a typical quad. Call it a desert beer or digestif. Sweet."
"Drinkability- Good, however one is more then enough"
"Not bad at all but not nearly my favorite Quad. It doesn't fit the style all that well."
"It's a toasty malt beast, a bomb of grain sugar, with a glycemic index that stares down and cows the most potent insulin. This is what happens when you deregulate maltose and dried fruit. And yet, the ABV manages to shine through as well. So it could be better, and it could be worse, and I'm hoping for more from Smutty next time, if only for more complexity and dimension in a big beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown color with a thin tan head that stays until the end and laces nicely. Smells really sweet, sugar-y like candy and caramel flavors. Tastes of lots of sweet malts, smooth alcohol flavors and great belgian spices that don't stand out to much to bite your tongue. Just a great combination and blend of flavors. It goes down so well, and drinks unbelievable."
"Moderate carbonation, even mouthfeel, fairly full. Fairly drinkable, but very rich."
"The beer pours a clear, brown color with some light brown foam, but not a large head. The smell was malty with a light sweetness and a touch of something fruity-sweet or herbal. The flavor was malty, but it had a strong, off-putting flavor that I could not put my finger on. I thought it might be from their yeast since I recall this same flavor in the Winter Ale (Dubbel), but it was not as pronounced or unpleasant there. Someone told me that it is from raisins that are used in the recipe. The mouthfeel was good: smooth, creamy, medium-full body. The strange flavor takes points off the drinkability."
"picked up a couple of these to check out the latest from one of my favorite breweries. Unfortunately what poured as a nice looking mahogany brew turned into a brow sugar overly sweet experience. I'll try again next year if they bring this back, but I'm all set for this year."
"Big hopes for cellarabilty though."
"Overall, a very underwhelming Quad and by no means one of my favorite Smuttynose offerings."
"Drinkability: nice for the style but the one bomber bottle is enough for a session. Better to share this one with a friend. Great flavor - try this one."
"This won't replace any real Belgian quads. A disappointment from one of my favorite brewers."
"Overall: Not too bad, though it's certainly not holding a candle to any actual belgian quad as others have stated. I do find it a bit too sweet for my liking, perhaps it will settle down with age."
"Pretty good drinkability. Overall, a decent beer that I could see being better in about 6 months."
"The nose is vinious and mildy sugary as is the taste. Not syrupy sweet. Not cloying. A nice balance between candy sugar and sweet friut like strawberries. The alcohol is well hidden. This is an enjoyable brew that's reasonably priced ffor a quad. Cinnamon taste as it warms."
"This beer is big on sweet and big on fruity flavors. Tastes of plum, raisin, and some sort of tropical flavor, almost like the strawberry-kiwi juice blends you can buy in the store. Just a hint of hop kick at the end helps ground the flavor, so that the sweetness doesn't become unbearable. The big malt presence just lingers in the throat and on the tongue after, but the fairly high carbonation keeps it feeling fresh. It's actually a pretty light body for the style, much lighter than I'm used to. It's not the highest in alcohol for a beer like this, but still, what it carries is almost undetectable. This is a dangerously drinkable beer, and another solid offering from Smutty. To me, it doesn't really go beyond solid, it's good but not great. It just lacks those extra layers of complexity a great Quad should bear. For a Quad-lite, it is a great introduction to the style."
"A very solid Smutty offering. Not many flaws; however, nothing flavor-wise that would assert this as a staple of the style. In comparison to my favorite Quadrupel: Scaldis Noel; unfortunately, 'Gravitation' doesn't come close."
"1108"
"reasonably priced, but quite underwhelming. i don't see this getting much better with age, but who knows?"
"Poured into a Chimay glass. I like the color. a nice amber/brown. The head disappeared a bit too quickly. The taste was sweet and raisiney with the hops comming in just after. Still very balanced. This is one of my favorites of recent. Not a session beer, but I could have two 22oz bottles in a row! A really nice Smuttynose offering!"
"Pours a clear deep red with a bubbly creamy off white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of dark fruits, molasses, very sweet and malty. A bit of yeast character pokes its head out as this one warms. Taste is sweet and fruity with an alcohol bite with some phenols mixed in there. A bit of spicy Belgian yeast with a dry finish that leaves sweet and phenols on the palette. Body is thick, mouthfeel is creamy/syrupy, carbonation is medium to high. Decent quad but a bit high on the alcohol and phenols for me, maybe a bit of age would help this one. See you again in a year Gravitation."
"Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy (and not in a good way). Rather than the smooth, rich, complex sweetness of the best Quads, this was more akin to a fountain Coke that hadn't been properly watered down."
" I'm a bit dissapointed in this Quad, and that's only because it's a ""style"" that has soo many amazing versions, usually ultra-complex but only a few American Quads even come close to the real deal Quad's of Belgium."
"Picked up a bomber at Abe's Cold Beer for $7.50. This is a uniquely American quad. It's a world away from St. Bernardus or Westvletern, but somewhat similar to Avery's the Reverend. Like the Smuttynose Saison, there's a thick, powerful kick of phenols that borders on medicinal, but is largely clove. The fruit flavor are interesting, with a mix of strawberry juice, dates, and blackberries. Once the punch subsided, a clean, dry cocoa flavor kicks in that's unusal, but not unwelcome. Good points for drinkability too. Worth a try if you're an open-minded drinker."
"Mouthcoating goodness here. Nice for a cold day, and not overpowering enough to make this hard to drink. One big-assed bomber was enough -- not like anyone is going to keep hitting this, nor should they. Prior to this, I was a quad virgin, so I need to compare to another to get a real feel for this brew and style. That said, this a a real open-minded review. Worth a try."
"Good for a sipper on a cold winter day indoors. Nightcap material through and through. Smutty really hasn't disappointed me yet. Keep up the great work."
"Very smooth and easy drinking. Excellent Quad from Smutty."
"A really sweet offering that I had some troubles with up front, but my tastebuds adjusted and I was able to enjoy it more towards the end."
"Overall it surprised me at first, grew on me a bit, but by the end of the 22oz., I was ready to be finished. Not the best quad I've ever had."
"Drinkability: Moving on to the Rochefort 10, possibly spoiled by drinking quality beers on a regular basis."
"Overall: this beer was a little too young when I drank it. I'd imagine that in a month or so the sweetness will mellow a little bit and bring up my opinion even more."
"Overall: I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me, and for the price it's pretty good, but there's much better stuff out there. Here's hoping Smutty turns down the mash temp for next year's batch, and that this second bottle I have will be better by then."
"It is always nice to see a new big beer from Smuttynose in New Hampshire. I love the artwork on the label, which I am guessing is some sort of tribute to Milton's Paradise Lost. Anyway, back to the beer; pours a dark rosy color, with just a lacing worth of white heading. Brown bread in the nose, followed by some sweet dark fruit, creamy, almost reminds me of a dessert wine in some ways. Taste starts off with a punch of chocolate, then some fruity flavors, and ending on a malted milk ball quality (not unlike whoppers). Body is thick, syrupy and boozy. Sweetness can become a bit much at times, making it a tough one to finish on your own. This was an ok beer from Smuttynose, but I don't feel that it resembles a Quad. My first thought after sipping it was that it had a strong bock character to it. I am not one to quibble over style, but it does say on the label that this is a Belgian style quadrupel. Anyway, not bad at all, just not something I will be going back to any time soon. Cheers"
"Not particularly recommended..."
"Smuttynose's website lists this beer as 8.5%. I just finished the bottle, and I'm not nearly as intoxicated as I would be after drinking other quads. Absolutely a plus, as the flavor clearly hasn't suffered."
"A dark ruby, almost opaque brown pour with little head or lacing. Smell consists of cherries, which is also te dominant flavor found in the taste. I would like to taste more of the belgian style yeast in the beer, as the tartness of the cherries overtakes it. Excellent drinkability and overall, another great big beer from smuttynose."
"All in all a good interpretation of a quad by a great brewery.Seems almost like a belgians interpretation of a double- bock. A little to sweet to drink a bomber alone but a good beer."
