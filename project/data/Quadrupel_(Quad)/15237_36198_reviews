"Already thinning, this is not a beer for long aging. I have never seen it in any local store until the last month, so this is the newest vintage I can buy. I do believe it would be much better ""fresh"". It seems the last 3 years have be a little rough. Perhaps storage conditions were sub-par, there is no way to know. The original quality of this beer shows through however."

"T - Another terrific quad that is right up there with the best of them. Flavours are balanced nicely and once again de-struise doesn't disappoint"
""
"Overall - Seriously delicious stuff.  Almost like a barley wine in some ways.  The alcohol is very well hidden and it has aged beautifully."

"Overall: Really nice notes of chocolate malts and tart fruit with an airy carbonation.  It’s a disappointment there was that odd “wet penny” note and slick oily mouthfeel.  This taste like it could have been really good."

"Inferior to regular Pannepot, but still fairly tasty. Probably wouldn’t buy it again, though."

"330 ml bottle into chalice; 2011 vintage, bottled on 8/29/2011. Pours very hazy/cloudy dark brown color with a small dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, clove, pepper, cinnamon, spice, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, cinnamon, spice, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin. prune, fig, cherry, toffee, molasses, chocolate, toast, clove, brown bread, cinnamon, spice, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of yeast, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"O-I was really excited to try this beer since I like Pannepot so much, but I felt a bit let down. The heavy roast component and lower levels of sweetness are not necessarily what I expect or want out of a quad style beer. That being said, this beer is unique and makes for an interesting drink. The strong flavors and higher alcohol heat mean this beer is not for the faint of heart. I'll re-visit this winter...."

"Poured a brown body with one finger head and some lace that just doesn't go away. The aroma not only has a touch of booze but strong dark fruits such as figs, toffee, not quite raisins to me but close, some yeast and hints of sugary sweetness. More of the same in the body as a medium body holds together some dark fruits and sweetness for a simple and enjoyable beer that finishes with a hoppy, tart crispness that I was not expecting and the ABV is well hidden (wouldn't have pegged it close to 10%)."

"much like some of the other incarnations of this beer, im not as awed by it as other folks for whatever reason. it seems to miss the belgian quad mark, not quite be an old ale, and end up honestly being closer to the stingo styles, with a slight tart or tannic element, but none of those sum this up stylistically, and to me it just doesnt taste all that good. big thick amber malt body, mostly still, with a nose of dried stone fruit, figs, tart cherries, booze, and stale grain sugar. the flavor is similar, and while it almost smells infected, the other reviews here tell me thats how its supposed to be, tartness our of nowhere battles sweetness, and booze is there all the way. to me, its not that well refined, its not that different, and its not that special. maybe i had a bad bottle or something, but ive thought this about reserva and others. will have to revisit it in time, but its lack of carbonation hurt it, as did the long tannic finish. strange brew, but not one i cared for too much this time around."

"O: Beers like this remind me why I love De Struise: it's extreme, yet immaculately balanced and delicate all at the same time. I wouldn't have had any trouble killing several glasses of this, that's for damn sure."

"Dark fruit big opaque body deep burgundy brown quadrupel on our hands, with big fluffy khaki brown head forming thick leaving fine speckled Belgian style lacing. Aroma has dark fruit raisin, plum, and other over ripened fruits seeping through your nares as you inhale each sip. I'm currently smoking a Viaje Roman Candle with this quad, and it goes great together...that's not surprising at all deep smoke, spicy black pepper, and other dark leather notes form so well with the Nicaraguan tobacco utilized in this huge spice bomb of a cigar. It's a nice combo of sweet and salty even umami at times on the palate, huge dark malt base with Belgian yeast spice providing the fermentation on this beer. Andre' Farkas from Viaje has done so well with this cigar line, but enough about the smoke let's talk more beer. Perfect level of acidity like a red grape ripened to the point that it's ready to bulge and transmorph into a plump raisin. Mouthfeel is magnificent perfect driven naturally carbonated mouthfeel leaves the palate with some effervescence to carry on the complex body and flavor. Overall, quite frankly I'm in love with this beer yet it needs more age to truly express itself the English on the front of the label says 2012 and it calls itself Old Monk's Ale...I can see why!"

"O- A very nice beer and similar to Pannepot. My only problem is that I think my bottle has been sitting on a shelf for too long. Its still good but I cant help but think it may have been better."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have yet to be disappointed by De Struise Brouwers and this beer only reaffirms my belief that I should seek their beers out at every opportunity possible. Quite good."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted malt, molasses, char, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, molasses, burnt fruit, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty, but I think the set of aromas on this one are much better."
""
""
""
""
"This is about two years old and the 10% ABV has not completely faded. Indeed the alcohol burn plays volleyball with the dark fruits, malts, and tart, semi-floral hop finale. But overall I found it to be an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"A solid beer. This should be considered one of the tops in it's class. A calm, mellow brew. Highly recommended."
""
"This quad says it all with its big malt and booze-like tones. Moderately sweet but the alcohol edge and hop bitterness keep things balanced and interesting. Bold and flavorful with a knockout punch of alcohol make this one a fine, slow sipper."
""
"overall - decent, but a disappointment compared to the top quads from Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff, though this isn't blowing my mind like some other De Struise offerings. Perhaps it would've been better fresh."
""
""
"A 2013 bottle picked up at the brewery a week ago, cellared and then briefly fridged. Poured briskly and directly into a tulip, almost inert, only a bit bit of froth and a ring of continued bubbling action around the rim of the liquid, mahogany with some ruby glints. But good legs, no sediment, enticing to look at. Not a big bloom of aroma but still enticing, with clove, cherry, cinnamon, root beer, a bit of basement workshop, meaning sawdust and a tad of funk. Whoa, caramel malt, very brown sugar, a lick of tart cherry or raspberry, a whiff of tobacco, and just a bit of some herbacious hops drying the edges of the tongue. Rich but less complex than, say, it's -pot brother. That drying helps define the mouthfeel, too, by cleaning up a bit of chewiness and oiliness in the body."
""
""
""
""
"Dive in I did: the taste is divine. I love sweet malty brews and this fits completely into my style. Gorgeous flavours of spices, yeast and those sweet dark fruits blend together giving a wonderfully tasting beer that belies the 10% ABV it stacks. Full bodied and a really lovely night cap."
""
""
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: This is a huge Belgian Strong Ale with great depth and complexity. It had a malty sweet almost brown sugary taste with notes of rich caramel and dark candied fruits. It had a medium bodied mouthfeel and hid its high alcohol content really well. It was a great gift from my dad as De Struise makes World Class beers and this is no exception."
"As a stand-alone beer- Panepeut seems to under-deliver as its taste falls tarter and more ""challenging"" to the taste. Paired with food, I can see this beer singing with pickled flavors and petite beef filet."
""

""
""
"This is solid beer enjoyment."
""
"O- Another very nice beer from this series, I probably prefer the classic version, but this is really tasty as well."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Near Legendary!"
""
""
"O - not the best quad, but solid. Dryer than usual."
"Overall: Another fantastic quad from De Struise that could easily be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus ABT 12."
""
""
""
""
"This is the only vintage I've had so I can't compare to a fresh one. The tangyness was more than expected and the fruit almost overshadowed the malts. Light oxidation was and added to the overall flavor. Good layering with a tangy fruit twist."

"O: Definitely a complex, rich and powerful quad. Sweet, fruity, bitter, and spicy. Will probably be awesome if aged longer."
"Was expecting more."
"O: In my opinion, a great representation of the style. I would expect nothing less from this brewery. Excelsior!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Haven't had a 5+ year old quad before. This seems like it can't get much better though. Good drinkability, ABV is somewhat hidden."
""
"Smooth and medium bodied. Dark fruits, spice, brown sugar, and alcohol."
"O-Damn this is a tasty quad. I don't have a fresh one to compare with, but this beer is damn near perfect right now. Equally tasty as a sipper or a gulper I wish I had more of this beer. A little more expensive than my favorite quad, St. Bernardus, but in the same class. Well done beer that brings me back to Belgium."
""
""
"(O)- Overall, an excellent Quad. Can put this up with the greats of the style and it would fit right in."
""
""
"I've liked other De Struise beers a lot more than I like this one. It's not bad, not in the least, but it's not one I'd go to again, what with all the delicious quads that are readily available. Doesn't give me anything I can't find elsewhere."
""
""
""
"Good by quad standards, kinda average for a Pannepot."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep dirty cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of bubblegum ester with some candi sugar and some light spices. Taste is comprised of a sweet malt base which is well balance with some bubblegum ester and some light spicy yeast at the end. Very well balance with no apparent alcohol and a full body with great carbonation. I thought it was slightly less complex then the regular version but I would have to do a side-by-side comparison"
""
"O-this is surprisingly no where near as awesome as the oak aged version. It's definitely an awesome beer, but there are many quads out there I'd rather be drinking. It hits pretty hard too, this one."
"O: This has aged spectacularly. Rounded and complex while maintaining a great drink after drink simplicity."
"Good, not great. Pannepot is far superior."
"Overall - Eh. Nothing near the beer that Pannepot is. I have a fresher bottle that I'll try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know what the hell some of the other reviewers are drinking. This beer is incredibly good. I expected to be dazzled by Pannepot, but this one caught me by surprise. An absolutely phenomenal beer."
""
"Nice Quadrupel that is a great representative of the style. In my opinion there could be a little bit more of fruity aromas that could balance the coffee taste. Great beer for a slow evening in the colder seasons, which means practically any day in Amsterdam."
"The beer is dark brown and fairly hazy with an inch of thick, foamy tan head. Aromas include yeast, malt, caramels, figs. The flavor is a notch better. Alcohol content masterfully hidden. Really creamy and smooth on the palate with an elegant and graceful finish. Cheers to Urbain."
"The body is medium and seems to have very little carbonation. Overall this one is fair enough. Not my favorite variation from the guys."
"D - The winter fruit is well contained and doesn't overpower the complexity that resonates through the rest of the drink. Good yeast character and very nice feel for a 5 year old brew."
"O- This was a decent quad. I definitely preferred the Pannepot Grand Reserva I had a month ago. I remember that having a less dark fruits, but being more balanced and mellowed out. This beer was a little bit too grape and plum heavy for my tastes and tasted too much like merlot (which sometimes isn't a bad thing). I didn't dislike it, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
"Overall an enjoyable sipper. I'm not sure of the difference if this were a Pannepot instead of the Pannepeut that it was (the label indicates a Danish version if that's the difference)."
""
""
"O: This is a solidly made, focused, and drinkable beer."
""
"Overall this beer was good, not the best in its style but drinkable. Body was slightly too thin for the style in my opinion, flavors were just off the mark from being exceptional. Liked the beer but dont think I'd pay another 8 bucks for it"
"O: Overall, this is good, but not great and somewhat disappointing for a sytle that demands excellence.  This is the 3rd Pannepot Ive had the pleasure of trying (others being regular Pannepot [old fishermans ale] '11 and Pannepot Reserva '09).  This is my least favorite of the 3, and the old fishermans was by far my favorite of the three.  As a whole the flavors could be stronger, and this one is quite boozy, perhaps to a fault.  Maybe Im just spoiled on Westy and Rochefort, but with latter being so much better than this offering and almost always readily available, I doubt I will have this one again in the near future.  "
""
""
"Overall: Tasted side by side with a 2006 Pannepot and this one came up way short; the carbonation level was notably lower and the depth of dark fruit and chocolate flavors was missing - this one had more spice cake elements and was a tad sweeter"
""
"overall, a fantastic quad. not quite as good as rochefort 10 or westvleteren 12 - or even old fisherman's by the same brewery - but it's very, very good. a must try for quad fans; unfortunately they just don't make 'em like this stateside. not to be missed."
"330ml bottle (Label: Pannepeut 2010). Oversized glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Dark brown color, dark amber to the light. Beige, close froth leaves a collar on top when dismissed. Toasted malts, caramel malts, chocolate hues, toffee & ripe figs to the nose. Spiced aromas –clove, vanilla, cinnamon- Flavor profile as aromas. Creamy maltiness, low bitterness. Fruity & voluptuous. Full body, soft carbonation. Ripe fruits & dried nuts showed in a lasting finish. ABV?? Who, cares?"
""
"Poured at a good temperature with a small to medium size, light tan head that soon settled and no lace. Color is a hazy amber cherry with a couple slow bubble trails. Aroma is malt, burnt sugar, toffee, yeast, wine. Flavor's like nose, subdued and dominated by mild sweetness and bitterness with little carbonic tang. Body is ok and carbonation is a little flat. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and kind of forgettable. Think I got a less than decent bottle."
""
"O- This is a truly remarkable experience, the feel of this beer alone is magical. The decadence of this beer is something I've never experienced ever."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation and a lightly sweet aftertaste. A nice beer which I would buy again."
""
""
"Pretty good - a complex, fruity quad that lives up to the style. Doesn't quite match some others that I've tried, though I can't pinpoint why. Orange seems to come through in the flavour, and the alcoholic notes definitely remind me of dark rum. All said, a solid effort that is well worth trying."
""
"Overall this was excellent. One of the best Quads I've ever tried. No doubt about it"
"O: I was hoping for a more full-flavoured brew, but I got a solid effort, just wish it was less expensive."
"a malty fruity brew that's well worth trying but I preferred the fisherman's ale by these guys. thanks again liamt07 for this little gem"
""
""
"O: A good quad but not as good as the other variations. It's a bit thinner, a bit boozier, and not as complex as the others. Dark fruits are probably the best aspect of this one. Fully warmed up it's nice and smooth but just doesn't quite have the magic."
"Poured a hazy, amber-brown with a small cap of off-white head; short-lived but moderate lacing left behind. Aroma of caramel and cake, dried fruits; a bit boozy. Taste of sugars--caramel, toffee, candi--spicy yeast, dried fruits, banana notes and bready malts. Pretty boozy, but not too offensive, though it does detract from the drinkability a bit. Otherwise, medium body and quite good overall. Nice to see it on tap."
"O: A very good and delicious Quad. May not have as many flavors as other Quads, but the quality of the dark fruit flavors in this beer are amazing. Very clean and refreshing....which is weird to say for a Quad."
"Overall a great beer. Again, I may have a little bias against this style but De Struise just exude class with every beer they make. Highly recommended whether one enjoys or steers clear of quads normally."
"O: another fine Pannepot (Pannepeut 2011 on the label) brew - had a heartier, more rum-spiced flavor to it than their others - perhaps a bit more bold, perhaps a bit more like an old ale/sotch ale meets a quad. I'd say any beer with Pannepot on the label is golden. Enjoy!"
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Not quite what I was expecting, and not nearly up to snuff with the other Pannepot products I've tired, but still nicely brewed and well worth drinking."
"o - overall the reviews call this one out as a weaker link and i'd have to agree...although a weak link from one of the masters of the style is hardly weak. this is an extremely tasty and enjoyable beer, but i won't be reaching for this over regular or reserva pannepot, but would reach for this over probably 80 to 90% of all other options."
"B"
"Not sure how this differs from Pannepot but it's a fine beer just the same."
""
"Very good beer. Nice amount of complexity. Good dark flavors, but not to heavy. I really couldn't even detect the heat from the alcohol. It may be blasphemy, but I think I might prefer this to the westy 12"
"O: Another solid beer from De Struise. Look forward to trying regular Pannepot at some point..if I can find it."
"2007 pannapeut Struise. In Struise tulip.  Huge frothy beige head. Dark tudor brown body. Aroma brown sugar, fig raisin, and....age. The aroma of age, love it. Port like.  Taste...no abv. None. Smooth as can be. Dark fruits, fig dates. Thick mouthfeel. Awesome. "
""
"Notes: Maybe close to what is most commonly expected of a quad but a top tier bracket at what it does. Long and pleasing… Pannepeut touches my nerve much more than their Pannepot… Maybe less spice, more sweetness, and a better rounded complexity here?"
"O: Absolutely drinkable beer. Struise quality. By the way, the one that I've drunk had Pannepeut written in the label, and not Pannepøt like the one in the photo..."
"O: Wow, so glad I finally bought this bottle. I'm lucky to have only finished half of the 11.2 oz. bottle reviewing the beer and I can slowly sip the other half curled up in bed while reading. Please make sure to let this beer warm up when you drink it! I had it in my aging fridge kept at 55 degrees when I poured it and it's perfect. Granted quad is a difficult style to put yourself in so I can't give it more than a 4.0 but it's delicious."
"O: Really flavorful, one of the best quads I've ever had. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of zesty spice, earthy hops, dark fruit sweet malt and alcohol.  Hints of pepper, cinnamon, peppermint and clove followed by a strong dark fruit character.  Hints of dark cherry, grape, fig and raisin before a slight boozy finish.  Some alcohol flavor but not much heat.  High abv relatively well masked.  More complex as it warms with a slight syrupy, medicinal quality but still pretty tasty."
"O - really good. Just a great beer. I do prefer Pannepot but I'll gladly take this any day."
""
"Thanks Phil!"
"I loved Pannepot and this one doesn't disappoint. De Struisse killin' it."
"2007 bottle. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a dark ruby red brown. Thin, fine light tan head with great retention. Looks nice. Aroma of dark fruit, sweet malt, dark bread and faint spices. Absolutely delicious flavor of light, dark and dried fruit with distinct cherry notes, caramel malt; sweet. Superbly integrated flavors. Finish is somewhat abrupt, but with mild dark fruit aftertaste. A slight oxidized flavor consistent with a 5 year old bottle. Heavy bodied with creamy mouth feel. This is wonderful."
""
"Good quad with some interesting flavors to it, like the grape and big spice. Nothing compared to a good bottle of Pannepot but still a nice brew. Not as balanced as some other strong Belgians"
""
"O- A good Quad, really enjoying it. I have had better Quads, including the others from De Struise, but I will definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really excellent beer and it stands by itself in it's earthy complexity."
""
""
"Note: 2011 Vintage"
"Pretty good one."
""
"O: Not too bad. An easy drinking Quad."
"O: My biggest letdown from Struise so far. Big, but one-dimensional, this is a pretty poor excuse for a quad from a brewery that usually excels at the style. Yeast presence is minimal and uncomplicated, while the malt adds little flavor of its own. The hops that are so prevalent in the nose are nowhere to be found in the taste. I'd expect this from some American brewery giving it a try for the first time, but not from these guys. Tomorrow I'll sip on a real Pannepot to cheer me up."
""
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice at 50 degrees. 2011 vintage. Pours slightly lighter than cola in hue with maroon highlights when backlit. Head is a quarter inch, loose and khaki-colored and quickly dissipates into a frothy band around the edges. Aromas are predominantly grape juice, a suggestion of yeast and an earthy character. Taste consistent with nose - perhaps a little earthier. There's also a bit of a wet cardboard flavor towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with very little carbonation and a trace of acidity. Overall, a fairly subdued quad without much complexity. Not sure what age might do for this beer, but not something I feel the need to revisit anytime soon."
"Flavors are fruity as well. Cherry, apple, some cranberry. A touch of sour grape. They mingle well together, offer some tannin. The one aspect that does stand out is the alcohol. It's a bit hot and therefore and bit thin. But is that bad? Heck no. On a cold snowy night this one does the trick. Easy drinking? A bit; glad it's in a smaller bottle."
"Really expensive for my enjoyment level."
""
"O: In my opinion, this is an excellent Belgian quadrupel. It is probably my favorite of the various versions of Pannepot."
""
"o - Overall a pretty good beer, but a bit disappointing. I love all the Pannepøt variations/beers that De Struisse makes, but this might be my least favorite of them. The nose was nice and sweet, but the taste was a bit muted and musty, and the body was a bit thin and undercarbonated. By no means a bad beer, but no where near the other Pannepøt's."
"o - delicious. easy drinking, plenty of flavor, could drink this all night."
""
"jd"
"O. Overall this was right up my alley. Really flavorful caramel malt sweet and dark fruit rich quad. Nice complexity, good aroma, great taste. Really nice smooth and complex quad."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice and superb beer - worth getting a crate of."
""
"Hazy deep chestnut colour, collar of white head, minimal retention, no lace. Smell is quite spicy, cinnamon, dark fruit, raisin, dark bready scents as well as caramel sweet notes. Taste is packed with dark fruit followed by spices but less than the nose implies, brown sugar with raisins, fig and plum. Medium active carbonation, full body with a good feel. Very good quad, ABV not present, this went down quickly, tons of flavour in here."
""
"This really works and is a testament to the brilliance of the De Struise guys. The way the malt is crafted and attenuated is really nice."
"Started off a tad disappointed, but this grew on me big time. Big malty, fortified flavours served up in a very approachable manner."
""
""
""
"2011 vintage. Pours a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Opaque dark brown color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit nose and flavor is also dark fruit, some tartness with alcohol finish. Pricey at $7.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Overall; what really does it for me is the mouthfeel, so frothy and silky...along with the subtle complexities in an otherwise excellently balanced beer!"
"O: This is a good beer, and reminds me quite a bit of Rigor Mortis. I had it recently so its more on the memory, but thats a good comparison. I'd say this beer is better than it, because it looks better, and has a better mouthfeel. Taste is very close to it. In both cases the beer is nice to sip and just enjoy. Nothing you want to pound down, just sip and enjoy the different flavors. Pick up one if you see it... You will enjoy it!"

"Poured a reddish brown, with a great thick and dense mocha coloured head. Great retention and some lace. Nose is light herbal and I got some dank (?) notes intially.Some cinnamon and some other spice notes as well. Caramelized dark fruits too. Taste has some dark fruits, sugary notes, caramel, spicing and a touch of the herbal note found in the nose. Mouthfeel is sticky, and the herbal note is found in the finish. Medium heavy, medium low carbonation and a bit of alcohol. Quite nice, but these herbal notes prevent it from standing out for me."
"O: Great. There really isn't much more to say other then go find this beer."
"Dark fruits are prominent on the palate, too, along with cola and faint spice. Slight molasses sweetness, roast and vinous notes come through mid-palate. Full on the palate, though it drinks easy and doesn't have a trace of alcohol. The finish is surprisingly dry after the initial hit of sweetness, ending with a lingering spiciness. Great overall, I'm impressed yet again with Struise."
"O - This is a very nice beer, but it feels a bit harsh due to the strong alcohol presence and the distracting metallic smell and taste. I may have had an old example suffering from some oxidation. Without the metallic overtone I'd rate the beer much higher."
"Surprised to randomly find this guy on tap out here in my neck o' the woods...but I'm not arguin'. It pours a murky ruby-sienna topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose is somewhat faint, yielding some brown sugar, toffee, light biscuit, and light red grapes when some effort is applied via my 'strils. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, fig, red apple skin, red grape, dark fruit, light clove, light cinnamon, a touch of banana peel, and a vague hint of honeydew in the very back. Now there's some complexity, folks! The body is a fairly hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a solid brew, though I think this one loses out to the normal Pannepot, which has a brighter nose and a less fruity flavor profile (which sits slightly better with me in the circumstances). Still a very good beer, though..."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer but my least favourite of the De Struisse quads that I have had. Got better as it warmed- came in the glass too cold."
"Full body, slightly higher carbonation, sticky and warm on the tongue. Pretty tasty brew, but still a bit boozy and sweet overall."
"I'm glad I had someone to help me finish this glass, as drinking 12 oz. was a tad difficult. An interesting take from De Struise, but I really prefer Pannepot."
"Vintage 2007 into chalice. Garnet brown with reddish hue and very unstable tan head that instantly dissipates. Complete absence of lacing does not add positively to visual aspects of the beer. The reviewed beer belongs to PannepØt, the cane sugar based variant hence the poor head retention is not surprising, as cane sugar is supposedly inferior to candi sugar that adds to a beer's head retention. Aromas are of chocolate coated dark fruit (dried cherries, prunes), sugar and spicy alcohol. Flavor dept consists of chocolate covered dry cherries & prunes, sugar and bread crust bitter finish counteracting the sweetened fruity tartness. Medium bodied with just about the right amount of carbonation the beer is almost prickly but never such. Similar to but thinner than regular Pannepot , lacking its fullness, smoothness and visual appearance."
"O: Great beer, but not the best of this De Struise Quad Challenge."
"An amazing masterpiece!"
"I don't know a word of Danish (and few Flemish ones, for that matter) but apparently we all speak the same language: good beer is good beer. While I, like others, wouldn't consider the Danish export quite as grandiose as the original, it is nearly every bit as sensuous and it makes every bit as good an addition to cellars and beer menus anywhere."

"D: I find this to be an overly drinkable brew for the style. A beer that is great to sit back and enjoy while you take all the flavors and complexities in. The 10.00% alcohol is a bit present and if it would be masked a little different, I feel this would have received a 5 in score. None the less, stellar brew."
"Originally reviewed 4/4/11."
"Very dark ruby; mostly clear. Small, ringy, tight-bubbled, light khaki brown head. Spicy fruit cake, dates, tartish, vinous malts. Powdered sugar and spiced rum. Nice. Leather and mildly roasted malts up front. Big, sugary and vinous fruits (plums, candied pears). Woody, madeira quality. Tobacco, light smoke, grape tartness, and hints of herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Full body. Soft feel with gentle carbonation. Would love to try the other version as this one is terrific!"
"drinkability: good"
"this was had along side a pannepot the same evening and it was more of a food beer of the two. not at all similar outside of the beligian yeast quality. had a great feel. the feel was not as wonderful as their vintage. pour was coca cola brown with very little murkiness. nose of yeast, plum, sugar cane, fig and a mild hint of porter stale fruit and booze. went down a tad warm and thick yet airy. voluminous. palate was a bit more herbal than expected. had the quality of fruit but also some earth mineral and mild smoked malt porter sour. plum, thyme, extremely subtle astringent. alcohol not noticable outside of warming qualities. sherry finish but grainier and nicely distributed with by the carbonation. a beer to be has with food like a rochefort. fantastic."
"Medium-full in body, smooth and slightly chewy. Great depth of flavor and complexity and leaves you wanting more. Goes down almost too easily. Very enjoyable."
"O/D-Happy to try it, but not my favorite. More mellow than anticipated. I won't knock the style just because it is not my favorite but I still appreciate the flavor."
"Despite the richness, finishing a sizable pour was easy. This is another excellent incarnation of an epic beer."

"Pretty easy to drink. Not too hot, but you do get a small kick of booze in the back end."
"A great example of the style to be had multiple times."
"One of the world's great Quads, stands side by side with Trappist varieties, lucky to have this on tap. I'd enjoyed part of a 2006 bottle before, while that was a bit oxidized (not overly so), this tap version was sublime, ultra complex and muy delicious. World Class."
"Drinks pretty well. A nice quad."
"For a 10% ABV-brew this is dangerously drinkable. Very different from the orignal Pannepot but not in a bad way. I like the orignal version better but this was a fine treat during a dull winter evening. Recommended"
"Well I love the normal Pannepot and had high hopes for this version and have been waiting quite some time to try it and needless to say am a bit let down. The aging in barrel hardly comes through, their are some spicey characteristics with hints of chocolate, no wood, and more pitted fruits. Things just seem discombobulated and out of place. Have a couple more I'll age and see what happens."
"Outstanding beer, just like everything else I've had from Struise. Compared to the standard Pannepot, I feel that this beer is maltier and slightly less complex, but nevertheless awesome."
"OVERALL: Essentially, this brew is Pannepot without the added spices and herbs. Though Pannepeut is a nice beer on its own right, I don’t think it even compares to its superior and better-known brother in terms of complexity and enjoyment. This is one I would have again, but would reach for the regular Pannepot nine times out of ten. Worth checking out to make up your own mind if you get the chance."
"A very nice brew overall."
"Notes: I'm surprised somewhat by the Pannepot and Pannepøt: The former smells duller and is more spry on the palate while the latter has a more bright nose but is dull on the palate. My least favorite of the three tasted. Surprising, because I like the nose the best on this one, but the palate did not deliver."

"Next time I make the trek up to Liquor Max I think I'll get more of this one, too. I prefer the original, but this one's stellar in its own right."

"Overall: This beer came highly recommended from a person who has very similiar beer tastes as i do. He even said its better than Westy 12, so that made this beer a must try in my book. But this beer just did not do it for me. This is my first beer have had by this brewery and i am not too impressed. I wish i could have tried this beer fresh to get a better idea of what its all about. It talks on the label about an ale thats brewed with spices and i get no hints of spices or any spicyness from this beer...not even a hint. I must be missing something here, i will have to give it another try sometime hopefully with better results."

"D - Another mastepiece from De Struise. The smoothnes is impressive indeed. Its my kind of beer because of the subtle and balnaced flavours. No massive flavours but rather a little bit of everything."
"This is very complex. A fine brew indeed. It is subtly sweet, yet faintly reminds me of whiskey or scotch as far as flavoring goes. The 10% alcohol by volume isn't easily tasted in this."
"Drinkability: A great beer, though perhaps not as great as I remember Pannepot to be (though, admittedly, I haven't had it in quite some time). Not to be taken lightly at 10%, this one's good, with a quality nearly as high as its pricetag, though that perhaps sounds bitter of me. Worth seeking out, though don't go too far out of your way, relative to what you could get for the same price in the same or similar styles (Chimay Blue, St. Bernardus, Rochefort 10, etc.)."

"O: Good and plenty enjoyable. Towards the bottom in the tasting though."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Wonderful beer!!"
"Drinkability: Really solid across the board without being fantastic in any one category (I'd honestly give all 4.25's if I could). Definitely worth a try."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, forming a 1/4"" tan head over the barely translucent cloudy dark reddish brown brew. Head is quickly down to an uneven skim of bubbles, with average lacing. Aroma is fruity, spicy, bubblegum, and dark malts, with alcohol pervasive throughout. Taste follows the nose, spicing, malt sweetness, light fruitiness. Alcohol more evident in warmth than flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and wow, is it drinkable. Still liked the US version better though."
"Overall, I thought this was a really great Belgian ale. The flavors were rich and pure, mingling so well and cross such a wide range of style that it was almost impossible to nail down where it was coming from .A deep dark ale; this one would surely please anyone who gives it a try. Does it live up to the hype? I will let you decide that, my feelings are kind of mixed on the subject personally, but one thing for sure, it is damn good."
"The beer pours a medium brown color with a khaki head. The aroma is brown sugar along with caramel malt and dark fruit. The flavor is very fruity: cherries, plums, raisins. There is also some lightly roasted, caramel and toffee malt. Overall the beer is pretty sweet. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I really need to try this next to Fisherman's. Best quads ever."
"Medium body with a very smooth mouthfeel. Overall, very flavorful and an amazingly easy drinker. No indication whatsoever of the 10% abv."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I've enjoyed this beer and find it nicely drinkable. At this ABV one a night is just fine but I'd be happy to sample this one again. My overall impression is of a well made beer that has a very nice balance and lots of interesting flavors coming and going in each sip."

"Pours a light copper color with a good, though slightly short-lasting, white head. Good spotty lacing on the sides of the glass and a collar throughout. The nose strikes me immediately as being pretty light on the dark fruits, with more caramel and malt coming through. Aside from that, a spicy character takes over and really sends a few good notes. Light hops there as well. Different, but quite nice. The flavor is along the same lines--nice light spice with some bready malt and light fruits. Hoppy character is there as well, and then combines quite well with the spiciness to form a beautiful finish. Medium body. Nicely done, Struise."
"A treat to be sure and solid across the board. It's also a great beer to share with someone interested in Belgian beer."
"2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, bread, raisins, and sweet alcohol on the followthrough. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The alcohol on this one definitely made itself present on the followthrough without doubt. Hard to believe that with this one having 4 years on it already. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"
"This is a medium to full bodied offering with a distractingly excessive amount of carbonation. Just looking at the glass, you can see the carbonation is too high. Even continual sips and swirls does not tame how much carbonation this has. Once it enters your mouth, it really fizzes and tingles the tongue. This brew is quite complex but in an unusual way. The good parts about this brew are really good. However, the seemingly off or distracting flavors are not subtle and they clash with the pleasant characteristics of this brew. Perhaps, I should say shame on me for opening this too soon. However, I wanted to get my own experience at having this brew both fresh and with age on it so while this bottle was an interesting experience, I am curious to see how this brew either improves or goes down hill."

"M&D: smooth, never short of microscopic fizz, full-bodied but not overflowing...! This strong quadrupel is rich in flavour but so smooth and balanced on the palate, so much so that I kind-of feel like having a second bottle almost without considering the alc. strength... (or how expensive it comes!) A superbly-crafted strong ale overall - not with heavenly complexity but not far from it, either."
"The body is thick, something like St Bernardus ABT thickness, which matches well with the massive flavors, The noticeable alcohol makes this a sipper, a very good one but I think I like the standard Pannepot better."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the Pannepøt pours a dark murky brown with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is OK. Aroma is dark fruit (plums, raisins), spice (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg), brown sugar and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's a sweet, spicy and malty brew. There's also some toffee, pepper and chocolate that I can taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, creamy and a bit slick with soft carbonation. It's also very smooth which makes this very easy to drink. The alcohol isn't noticable at all. Overall I think this is a very good beer, I'd definitely pick it up again!"
"The reveal: De Struise Pannepeut Old Monk's Ale 2007! I was thinking this was some Pannepot even though Jeff told me there werent any Belgians in this box. I love all the Pannepot variations!"
"This came off as a Belgian winter warmer to me. The spice was a nice, but somewhat overpowering, mix of cinnamon and sweet herbs. The malty Belgian beer in the background was pretty faint, but still provided a pretty nice background with a bit of fig. I can say this beer was very drinkable and quite nice, but not worth the $8 price tag."
"D: What a surprising let down. I thoroughly enjoyed Pannepot, so I thought this would be more of the same. You can't win 'em all..."
"Overall: Great beer, not too much difference with the regular pannepot to be honest, bit more sweet maybe"
"O-Don't taste much of a difference from the standard Pannepot. Age has been good to this one, could see it easily going another 5 years."
"2007 vintage. The beer pours a brown-black, and is capped with a persistent tan-mocha head; spotty lace is deposited. The nose has a delectable rich maltiness offering suggestions of medjool dates, toffee, plum, molasses, and chocolate-covered cherries. The taste favors dark fruit, brown sugar, cherries, dry sack, pears, dates, raisins both golden and otherwise, and fig compote. There is also a boozy note which is expressed rather elegantly. The feel is silky and luxurious; it is a beautifully velvety thing all in all. This beer is about as good as it gets."
"Pours a mostly clear deep, dark mahogany. The head is initially one finger of creamy foam before shrinking to a thin, creamy ring. Lovely sweet bread and berry aroma. Sugary spice, fig, raisin, plum, brown sugar, and caramel. Well rounded, smooth malty flavor. Loads of raisins, plum, some cherry-like tartness. Surprisingly soft and airy and stunningly easy to drink. Smooth and creamy, a little dry in the finish. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Really an excellent beer!"
"D - Pannepot smells better, but this tasted nearly as good in my book. It's also held up pretty well after five years but I wouldn't sit on these much longer. While each of the Pannepot variants is clearly different side-by-side, they all share fairly similar flavor profiles - I think my preference is the original beer, but I could go for any of them depending on my mood. 4.0"
"2007 bottle of Pannepot poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Poured a deep amber ruby brown color with a tan head that quickly dissapated. Dances on the tongue type of carbonation, maybe a little too much for my liking, almost champagne like. I pick up the booze taste pretty easily. Fruity type tastes as well. I can appreciate the style but this beer just had too light of a mouthfeel for me."
"Overall I thought this version was boozier than the American version which hurt the drinkability a bit but the best part of either version is the smooth mouthfeel. Well worth a shot if you have the chance, as is the American version."
"d: Best quad i've ever drank, I haven't had that many, but still. At 10% this would hit you hard after a few."
"Whatever its lineage/provenance/recipe - this is a unique and tasty example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with spot on carbonation. Goes down pretty easy considering the abv. Overall, another tasty brew from Struise and one I'm glad I picked up. Wish I had another lying around."
"D: Formidable at 10%. Small sips. A nice licquer-style beer."
"D: Absolutely world class. So complex and layered, yet so easy to drink. One of the best!"
"Drinkability: Very good, excellent beer, almost at the intersection of a quad and a stout."
"D: Fairly drinkable for 10%, very smooth which helps, but still a very big beer. Overall this is a very unique quad and very delicious, will most likely revisit!"
"Opens sweet with a touch of metallic character that disappears after a while. Fairly simple, there's a lot of brown sugar and honey with alcohol being a lot more noticeable. Rummy and fruity, this finishes medium-dry with a touch of alcohol and spices. Medium-light in body, this is sweeter than I care for. Fruity and tasty on the finish, I can't help but notice that the higher carbonation in this version results in this not being as creamy as the regular version. Splitting this beer is pretty much necessary, and I'm glad I got to try this!"
"Probably my least favorite of the Pannepot incarnations, but that's a moot point considering how great they all are. As I mentioned above, I'd like to try this with a few more years on it. I do love me some well aged Quads."
"O: Not a bad beer - had great aroma but a very different taste. For the price would probably not buy again. The tartness in the flavor threw me on this one - didn't seem to compliment the beer."
"At first I was unsure of this beer, but eventually the sour notes got to me and I really started to not enjoy it. I'll stick to the regular Pannepot."
"2006 bottle. This dark brown ale pours with a thickness that informs the imbiber this is some serious stuff. Nice though small head, with an unctuous mouthfeel of molasses, caramel, and baking spices. I could envision myself being an old fisherman getting off the boat after a long cold day at sea and knocking back a few flagons of this to slake my thirst. Excellent stuff, will drink more."
"Definitely drinkable despite it's 10% alcohol, although the spices get to be a bit much after awhile."
"2006 vintage. Pours a rich brownish red color with a thin, lingering head. Aroma is virtually non-existent, some very faint malt aromas and slight boozy alcohol nose. Was expecting more from this beer. Taste was very malty and sweet - caramel, and dried fruits dominate. Dried cherry flavors seemed to be most present. Medium-bodied and sticks to your mouth. Overall, fairly easy to drink given the alcohol content."
"Cheers!"
"D: Fuck yeah."
"This is an enjoyable beer which makes a great winter warmer. I liked the ""regular"" Pannepot just a bit more, but wouldn't hesitate to have this one again."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a decent high strength Belgian beer to drink for a while."
"I could drink this all night or maybe even forever. I'm a sucker for a good quad, and this is a great quad. My non-beer geek girlfriend, whose rare beer choices are typically coffee or chocolate porters, even liked it. Thank you Chris and Frank"
"07 bottle from 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a goblet. Dark opaque russet with a slight reddish tinge. Creamy beige head leaves some lacing. Aromas of black cherry yogurt, a dusting of coriander, brown sugar, and caramel. Flavors of dark toasty caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, nutmeg, cherries, berries, and coriander. Nice complexity and insane smoothness. No trace of alcohol. Body is a couple notches thicker than medium. Well-attenuated and so easy to drink. Great beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is decent considering the style and ABV."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The mouthfeel is a bit shy of full bodied. The carbonation is low but works with this beer. The body of the beer doesnt seem to be as thick an viscous as the Pannepot I had the other night. This is still a very good beer. Drinkability is good. Given the choice I would drink Pannepots regular offering over this beer."
"Drinkability: Even at the high ABV the alcohol is hidden and this was a great and relaxing drinking experience."
"Brown color with a beige head and decent retention. Smell is of brown sugar, plums, raisins, and caramel. Taste is slightly tart, has some tastes of pears, caramel, toffee, and some dark fruits too. Medium bodied with a heavier than medium body. Thanks for sharing this, Joey."

"D- One of the best Belgians I've had. Probably the best quadrupel, although it was harder to tell with Westvleteren 12 because I only had a 1/2 bottle sample of."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Pours into my goblet a brown color with a creamy 1 inch off white, almost khaki color that dies down very slowly. A slim creamy layer rests in the middle of this one with lacing that hugs the side of the glass. Smell is of dried figs, some raisins, and caramel sweetness. Some grape, and wine type aroma dominate the back end. Taste is almost like vinegar tartness, very different from the regular version. Creamy texture to this one makes it a nice very smooth finish."
"Drinkability is very high, since I'm absolutely loving this beer, although it's one of my favorite styles. Better then the regular version IIRC, although I've only had it once, about a month ago."
"Ok this beer is not as good as it's Denmark-free version Pannepot (but it's still really good)."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed it. As for you, well, I hope you like your beers sweet."
"Pours murky brown, good amount of sediment, with a very small light tan head that quickly fades to a ring. Aroma is a nice sweet caramel maltiness with spice, a rich and meaty red wine aroma as well. Also berries and apple in the aroma as well as evidence of the alcohol strength. Taste is outstanding blend of sugary and caramel malts with a nice ginger and spice flavor. A nice tangy apple flavor balances the sweet and spices very nicely. Hints of root beer flavor, a drying finish welcomes in a brief punch of alcohol warmth. Medium in body, low carbonation, slightly slick feeling at the back of the throat. Very good beer, great taste, everything comes together very well. I'd also say this one is a great candidate for some ageing. Very interesting to compare to the belgian version."
"Pours a murky brown with a head that quickly disappears. Very little lacing. Sherry like nose, with dry vinous and slightly oaklike aromas. Some sweet malt on the finish as well as raisins. The taste is somewhat similar, but there is a much richer fruitiness with prunes, chocolate, and dark cherries added into the flavor profile. Sherry like finish is still there, but with a hint of sweetness at the very end. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is smooth, substantial, and creamy. The alcohol is clearly there, but not in an overpowering way. Not quite as rich as some quads, or as sweet. More like an amontillado to the others oloroso, but still quite enjoyable for its own style."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a murky deep brown color with a very bubbly tan head over top that falls to a full coat. Clarity is fairly good on this one and there are tons of tiny bubbles cascading up and helping keep the head around. The nose on this one is nice and raisiny, with a blast of spicy yeast that reminds me of cinnamon, followed by a deep and sweet candied sugar sweetness. Taking a very deep inhale over top brings me a solid yeasty breadyness at the end. This one is very aromatic, with the sweet malty and sugary notes playing the staring role. My first sip brings a more subdued flavor than I would have expected. I find a mild raisin fruit with a very mild caramel and sugar sweetness behind it. There is a mild banana fruityness playing in the background along with a niticable yeasty character that imparts a breadyness. Mouthfeel is thick with a very mild carbonation. This one has no slickness as I would expect from the strong sugary aroma. It is very smooth. The only hint of the ABV I find in this one is the slight drying quality on the finish. I enjoy the strong aromatic component and very solid flavor (but more subdued from the original version). I enjoy this one quite a bit."
"I am not sure of the difference between Pannepot and Pannepøt, but they are certainly different. This beer seems to be a touch sweeter, and not nearly as aromatically fruity as Pannepot. I'll definitely have to do a side by side of these two to explore them a bit more in depth. As the beer warms up it loses a touch of sweetness, yet strangely notes of brown sugar and even molasses become evident. Still that woody, almost peat like, spiciness is quite noticeable and it starts to mix in with a touch of warming alcohol towards the finish. Definitely another really tasty offering from the Struis Brouwers. I can't wait to crack my bottle of Aardmonnik!"
"Overall a very well crafted beer, that I enjoyed immensly."
"Tasty, very nutty and malty, some black currant and prunes. Lighter than it's cousin, and decidedly less spicy. I'll have to revisit the Belgian version again, the 1st time was a little overwhelming. Primary aroma of dark malt, vague sweetness. Moderately full-bodied, what you would expect from a Quad. Lighter than others of the style though. Reccommended in a side by side pairing with it's counterparts. Interesting, and worth a try."
"This is a very good beer, but for the same money I'll stick to the regular bottling."
"Although I recommend it I prefer and more strongly recommend the Belgium version of the same beer. Not BAD but not GREAT!!"
"Creamy, medium body beer with good carbonation. Very enjoyable. If you see it, pick it up. I will be coming back to this one."
"This beer is somehow a Dane version of the previous one I had. It poured just as dark with the dark amber hints, but more light shone through this one. A off white bubbly head formed and coated the sides with lace as it subsided. The aroma was of malt, chocolate and while molasses and the other aromas where there like the last one, not as pronounced. A flavor of malt, chocolate and molasses. The finish was sweet, and less sprite then the non Dane one. For the most part, quite similar except in the aroma and the finish."
