At this point in time, I don't really get a lot of the quintessential dark fruits that you expect from a Belgian quad, but this one steps a little outside the box with the use of pomegranate molasses and being partially aged in wine and rye barrels. It's hard to compare with Not The Stoic, given the time lapse, but this one has held up quite nicely, especially for being over two years past the enjoy by date.","LambicPentameter","Aug 13, 2014"

I liked the play of the fruit with the robust yet clean alcohol character. The barrel play was modest, but suited the malt bill. Not what I was expected, but solid Belgian style ale. I'm curious how my other bottle will age, but I probably won't want it to loose all the fruit, and therefore don't have high expectations for longer term. I'll check back in within 2-3 years.","ccrida","Aug 26, 2013"

4.14,8.4,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"The beer pours a hazy/speckled dark amber with a creamy off-white head that laces. The nose has huge notes of plumb, tart cherries, cherry blossoms, and malt. The taste presents the same bold stone fruits upfront with a blast of warm, booze soaked grains in the finish. The body is a bit lighter than other quads comparatively, but well carbonated, fruity, bready, and has masked booze in the finish. The aftertaste is bitter/rindy and a bit off putting, but certainly doesn't ruin the beer. Considering the price/availability and all additional components of this review, I'd say this quad is worthy of a try, but not more impressive than a 3 philosophers (for instance).","ThePorterSorter","Jul 01, 2013"

Smells of sweet malt, yeast, hint of grape, slight raspberry, alcohol, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Quadrupel. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, yeast, grapes, hint of citrus, sweet malt, and a hint of spice. Overall, alcohol is not over-powering, which I enjoy. The body at first, reminded me of a blend of Lindeman's Framboise and Kwak. Weak appearance and complexity, but good aroma, body, and blend.","Tone","Jun 23, 2013"

This is a quad with almost no Belgian flair to it, if uncategorized it's a complex beer mixing lightly toasted and sweet malt, oak and lightly sour fruit aspects. Rather than Stoic and rigid, this beer dances over the confines of the definition ""quad"" and delivers a delightful sensory experience.","rawfish","Jan 25, 2013"

Aroma offers some belgian yeast giving off some fruity esters.,big banana,some apple and then there's the pomegranate giving off some nice tartness, the barrels, and some alcohol. Flavor is really quite interesting. You get the typcial belgian quad flavors with the yeast and its fruity esters (largely banana) but you also get the pomegranate which cuts the sweetness and offers some tartness to this thing, and then some discrete woodiness. Some alcohol in the finish but not too bad, given the earlier reviews here time must have tamed it some. A fuller mouthfeel, some creaminess not much activity. Overall, I liked this one a lot more upon my first few sips than I did on my last few sips. I shared this bottle with someone else and glad I did because I couldn't have drank more than the 12 oz's I got. I guess I'd consider an alright brew in small portions, but the fact that it got a little cloying for me the more of it I drank was definitely a let down. Interesting beer, yes, good beer?

There's a hint of vanilla and oak in the flavor but they are very subtle. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is an OK beer, but I didn't love it that's for sure. I think the pomegranate adds a fruity tartness that makes it feel a bit like a sour bottle; the wine barrel adds to this as well. I was expecting a dark caramel and raisin beer with maybe some hints of barrel and tart fruit. What I tasted was a tart fruity Belgian with hints of caramel and pomme fruits.","johnnnniee","Aug 14, 2012"

The pomegranate provides an interesting touch, but only a one dimensional one. If this is a quad, okay, I can roll with that...I guess. Overall though, it's not very interesting. A brewery like Deschutes has earned my respect by producing a lot of interesting beers that I really enjoy. However. This is not one of them. A miss, in my book.","RblWthACoz","Aug 03, 2012"

Granted, I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I know I've had better. Maybe I expect Deschutes to knock it out of the park every time and I feel slightly disappointed.","TheRealBigC","Aug 01, 2012"

Some definite light caramel maltiness in the background and a touch of oaky tannins. The taste is nice, similar to the aroma but slightly more muted, not as bright. Very light bitterness, just enough to balance the high notes of the flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, very smooth, especially for 11%.

A suggestion of the wine barrel aging, not very much oak presence. This seems less like a quadrupel and more like a Belgian strong pale ale.

I really like malty beers, and sometimes the sweet ones are nice, but this one is a bit much even for me. I will gladly finish this bottle, but I am not sure that I would be prepared to drink this beer again. Since it is so big and well balanced, perhaps it would be a good one to let age for 3-4 years and try it again.

Maybe I should drink more belgians, but this one was quite good. Simple and extremely flavorful. Sweet and light, like a medium white wine.

I think something as simple as calling this a Belgian strong pale ale instead of a quad would have increased my scores across the board.

It is a bit stronger than I expected but was very good. There seems to be 2 sides to this one. The first sip was a bit spicy as far as it started with very little sweetness and the quad style really came thru with that strong belgian yeast. Then a quick second sip became oh so sweet. It was like the smoothest blended fruit juice then some light wood characteristics then a creamy bubblegum finish. The carbonation level is about perfect on this one, just enough to wake it up some each sip but not to where it over powers it.

I get a lot of white grape aroma with typical Belgian beer spices and Belgian yeast. Very fruity and spicy with nice funk. Flavor is initially spicy with hints of barnyard funk. Then you get a ton of white grape flavor with Belgian yeast. Then the rye and oak kick in, with definite vanilla and butterscotch flavors from the barrel. Quite a bit of booziness and burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a creamy feel. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I think this is a very nice and tasty beer. I was very skeptical due to the high amount of poor reviews and trash talk on this beer. I will admit, that this should in no way shape or form be labeled as a Quad.

Very drinkable and complex. Most everything you could want from a BSGA, in fact. Definitely comparable to La Fin Du Monde, if not better. However, since the beer notes a presence of pomegranate, wine barrels and rye barrels, you'd think those elements would have a larger presence. I kept wishing there would be more of a note from any of those. Some large sips gave off a vanilla hint that brought forth the rye. The final sips of the bottle gave me some interesting pomegranate notes. However, it just never came together. This beer was too subtle for my tastes and I wish I would have beaten me over the head a bit more with each of the added elements. Then it could have been a great beer instead of a merely very good beer. That disappointment makes me give it a lower score than it probably deserves.","UTCengOwl","0"

Hard to knock it, even though this is not at all what I had in mind when I responded to the Deschutes ""Advisory Board"" email asking what we thought they should make (I suggested a Quad, as wells as some others, such as a BDSA).

3.47,-9.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Not to bad but sometimes to much fancy pants blending is overdone. Keeping ti simple is always a good thing too.","barleywinefiend","Aug 28, 2011"

3.77,-1.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O – Although I am no expert in Belgian beers this doesn’t seem to be a quadruple from appearance, I am confused here. Doesn’t have that typical Belgian cloudiness either. I don’t know where to put this beer, it is in a class of its own. I think it has suffered low ratings because it had the misfortune of being labeled a ""quad"".","uawildcat","Aug 27, 2011"
4,4.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O- This is a good beer. I want to drink more and have purchased several bottles without disappointment. But, I don't get the same sense of pleasure I've had from other Reserve Series beers. I think the brewer could do better. If I don't consider the style as ""quad"" I find this to be a very enjoyable beer. Rating this as a quad, I find it lacking, but still worth seeking out and drinking.","doverhills","Beers"
3.94,3.1,3,4,4,4,4,"I have been on this beer for months waiting for it to come out! I had no reason to drink tonight other then to try a beer from one of my 3 favorite breweries. It pours a clear amber color??? I like my quads dark, never had one i could read through. The smells: Belgian yeast is huge, i get the Pomegrante, maybe some red wine. The smell is off the charts! When i bring this beer to my lips i get a revalation of great tastes: Both the oak wine and the rye whiskey both shine through nice, the fruits are there too. This isn't your papas quad but it is a damn good beer!","Swillbur","0"
4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"O: This isn't at all bad, and certainly not nearly as bad as some reviews have suggested. VERY drinkable for the abv, and the taste is moderate and enjoyable. The downfall, as I mentioned before, is the lack of depth and complexity. Though, my opinion is not very authoritative on the style, not my kind of beer, but I enjoy it nonetheless.","Klym","Aug 26, 2011"
3.21,-16,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall I am incredibly disappointed with this beer. I had very high hopes considering its my favorite style and my favorite brewery. That being said its not a bad beer and if I saw it on tap I might consider ordering it.","beerandcycling88","Aug 25, 2011"
4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O - Enjoyed this thoroughly! Too drinkable, yet very complex, great Belgian esters and phenols, depth of character, tons of layers. Can't tell it's 11% ABV at all.","jbakajust1","Aug 24, 2011"
3.63,-5,3.5,3,4,3,4,"22 oz Bottle, fresh from the distributor. Pours effervescent clear golden-amber body, minimal head, with minimal lacing. Loud carbonation crackles in the glass. Smell is spice, sweet wheat, heavy clove and banana, some juicy fruit. Initial flavors are pomegranite-like acid juice, clove, banana, caramel, alcohol bite. Fairly well balanced. Some oak and vanilla come through, spice is medium. Mouthfeel is medium, the high and fine carbonation scrub away most of the body- I think this beer could of done with less co2. Overall I say this is pretty good, but not something I will put large amounts of in the cellar. It will be interesting to see where this is at in a few years.","youradhere","Aug 23, 2011"
3.71,-2.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: This is pretty one dimensional to be honest. The drying quality is nice and the mouthfeel is too. The sweet fruits go well with the triple like base beer. Good but not what you'd expect from Deschutes Reserve series.","waltersrj","Aug 23, 2011"
4.08,6.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall as other reviews/comments have suggested, if you're looking for Rochefort 10 this ain't it. But it is an interesting beer to be sure. The taste is a little more one-dimensional than I'd hoped, but this is still a tasty beer that I enjoyed sipping. I think I enjoyed looking at it at least as much though.","draheim","Aug 22, 2011"
4.17,9.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O: Deschutes never fails to impress me. This isn't you typical Quad if it is even a Quad. But the label says ""Belgian-Styled Quad"" so given that, I think it is a great beer. A deviance from the style that definitely works.","doughanson78","Aug 20, 2011"

2.76,-27.7,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall: I am surprised that they say this took 5 years to create on the label. The color was the first indication that it would not be like the Trappist quads I have come to love. The Pomegranate is too much on top of the already sweet beer. The yeast doesn't give me the spicy or fruity character I want. I am very disappointed with this beer, but maybe my expectations are wrong.","hobojon","Aug 17, 2011"
2,-47.6,2,2,2,2,2,"O: Sometimes, I'm a little more lenient on rating a beer if I enjoy it regardless of the style placed on it by the beer drinking public. Deschutes pigeon-holed themselves though by calling this a Quad in the first place. Admittedly I'm not very experienced in the Quad style. I can think of at least one other beer lover who is more versed and would ""know best"". I have however tried some of the higher rated Quads available in America. They all typically share similar characteristics; deep layers of complexity, big fruits, heavy sugars, and an unabashed booziness. This literally shares none of those attributes. From top to bottom, I can't think of a better definition for ""not impressed"". It's not offensive, but it's definitely not up to my expectations for the style. Easily the most forgettable and weakest of the Deschutes Reserve Series so far. 2/5","hopsbreath","Aug 17, 2011"
2.44,-36.1,2,3,2.5,2,2,"Interesting nose of baby aspirin and soft raspberry comforts with caution. Clear yellow filtration victim of a beer screams anything but quad. Is this a triple? Misnomer city. First sip reveals corn syrup and chardonnay. The finish on this beer is dry and boozy, evoking a flavor profile more suited to a gin than a beer. The finish is rife with cotton candy and biscuity notes. The Stoic escapes the fearful possibility of oversweetness, yet falls victim to many other pitfalls of American-made Belgian-style ales. The burps are nice though, filtering out much of the nonsense and leaving me with a pils-y flavor soaked in belgian air. Perhaps that's how this beer was meant to be enjoyed.","goodbyeohio","Beers"
4.39,14.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability/Overall: I haven't had a beer this interesting in a while. Lots of flavor components, great character and evolution as the beer warmed, and tasty right to the finish. I almost had another one afterward, but instead decided to pick up a few bottles for down the line. Who knows? Maybe like the actual drinking of the beer, perhaps it will get better the longer it lingers.","nomomentwasted","0"
