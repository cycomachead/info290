"Overall - This is a very good example of the Quad style. While it is not my favorite, it is a good one indeed. If you like Quads, malts, or just good beer, this is a good one to get ahold of."
""

"Enjoyed at 11,000 feet at winter park. Pours a murky red with a thin layer of head which leaves nice lacing. Nose features plenty belgo esters including bananas, clove, and dark fruit. Grainy notes towards the end. Taste is moderately sweet with red grapes and banana. Sweetness gives way to some malty notes at the end. Booze is well hidden, no burn. Nice quad."
""
""
"medium brown in color  clear, not much head. rich malty aroma and taste.  a bit boozy.  some dark fruit flavor in there too. medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasted much more like a triple than a quad. Very malty and thick. Great mouth feel. Very citrus and spicy. Defiantly best at warmer temperature."
"A quite good quad, for what it is."
""
""
"Fantastic quad.  Drinking a 2011 vintage..."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"One of my regular favorites."
"Starts out a but sweet then turns to a good bite of alcohol, then has a good hop balance to finish."

"Nice beer.  Drinkable...possibly two in a row. But carefully."

"V - Purchased in a 22oz. bomber, medium/high value."
""
"This has a dried fruit, spicy, sugary nose with a hint of alcohol. The beer pours brilliant copper to ruby tinted amber under a 1‚Äù finely, moussey bubbled foam collar. The Reverend has a rich, creamy palate like a fruit cake soaked in alcohol with treacle lightly drizzled on top, filled with figs, dates, some other dried fruit and maybe a couple of nuts. The body is medium to a little above which is much less than all the flavor would lead you to expect. The carbonation is above average but it is natural and very fine and soft. There is some alcohol warming but it is hard to believe that this is 10.0% abv when drinking it."

""
"I've had better quads before"
""
""
"O: I had fond memories of this beer from occasions several years ago. It would appear that since that time, I have encountered Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Trois Pistoles enough that this beer has lost some of that initial ""what sorcery is this quadrupel you speak of?"" luster. It's not bad, but it's not anything I would seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this a lot. This could be a go-to Belgian. In Ohio, it's about $7 for a bomber - a very good value, yenamsain?"
""
""
""
"Pretty nice. Mellower than I would expect and there could be a little bit more to the flavors, but still nice. 4"
""
""
""
"Overall: Good quad. Complex but nothing too out-there."
"On tap at Yard House in Denver. A beautiful complex beer. One of the best I had while in Colorado."

""
""
"Nice beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This definitely covers more of the toffee/Belgian sugar side of the style then the raisin/dark fruit of most quads. It's kind of like a quad style barleywine. It's good but nothing mind blowing"

"I was given a 750 ML bottle of The Reverend for my birthday by a good friend, and sadly wasted the bottle by drinking it after I had already had enough scotch to dull my senses. Deciding to give it a fair trial, I picked up a second for a fairly budget price ($6.50), and decided to give it a shot. The aroma was a little bland, but it was a very attractive brew once I poured it. The aroma concealed complex and rich flavors, with the sweet fruit notes complemented well by just a touch of bitterness. Each of the first few sips gave me new subtleties to explore, and I found myself favorably comparing it to Three Philosophers and Gulden Draak 9000, two other favorites of mine. I will be purchasing a great deal of The Reverend in the future, as it deeply impressed."

"Sweet cherries, fig, raspberry, burnt sugars, sweet malty boozyness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I remember liking this more when I first had it years ago.  Now I find it to be decent but having a bit too much alcohol presence.  All the right flavors are there but there's just too much heat.  Maybe some aging would help."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty nose, molasses and dried fruit on palate. Raisins and cherries most evident. Minimal head and lacing. Seems smoother as it warms, but ABV shows its presence."

"Overall / Drinkability: The Reverend has given me his sermon and I'm a converted believer. This is a very good beer. Deep flavor and aroma profiles, good looking, and even the mouthfeel works with everything else going on. I'd hesitate to put it in any more of a religious connotation, but I effective went to a service, listened to the sermon, took communion, and left uplifted. This is one damn good beer. The alcohol does make itself a little bit known, but not enough that I found it hot. I had such a good experience I know it's dangerous enough for me to reach for another one and be in real trouble and in for a proper preaching against sin after the 2nd bottle. Great beer and I'll be picking this up again."

"I'm very impressed with this beer. But also vexed and perplexed. This is a STELLAR American-brewed, Belgian-style ale. And yet it seems to be so over-looked... Could it be because it isn't from Belgium? Or because it's so commonly available? In any case, I now revere The Reverend. And I'm not even religious."
"Overall: very enjoyable; at the high ABV, definitely not a session beer"

"Felt like a rather mild quad when I started at fridge temp, but as the time went on and the beer approached room temp, it started really growing on me and becoming so much more complex and tasty...at the end I was completely enchanted with this quad. So yummy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy, dark brown color. Half finger head that sticks around. Hops, lots of malt, and alcohol on the nose. Amazing smooth, malty taste. Malt and alcohol overpowers the bitterness, but not in a way that it is unbalanced. I'm a huge IPA fan, but this is one of the best beers I have ever had. Aftertaste leaves a strong alcohol burn for a beer. Hops can really only be tasted when burping. Excellent beer, would definitely recommend to anyone."

"Appearance is a copper color with golden edges. There was a half finger of head that dissipated quickly. The nose was surprisingly weak. The flavor profile includes the classic funky Belgian yeast flavor. The finish includes a slightly intrusive alcohol burn."

"O: Good American example of a quad. Not nearly the best quad, but worth a try"
""
"May have again; good beer to use as a bridge into some of the bigger Belgians."
"O: A bit boring, and certainly not the best quad, but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have been burned at Homebrew Stuff a lot lately... Buy at your own risk. I suggest buying only stuff you KNOW is fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: not bad, but hardly memorable.... something tells something may have been off here - it was a bar somewhat reputable for its quality, too.... maybe give it a shot from a bottle sometime...."
"Overall: Nice smooth big beer - a nice example of a beer that can be enjoyed like wine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer but not worth the price considering the other A+ quads available at similar pricing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 10% ABV is well-masked within the sweetness of the Belgian candied sugars and malts. But in all instances I still get this sort of wine or grape character, which I find brings the beer down a notch."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not bad but somewhat disappointing. The aromas was very nice, but the palate profile feel short. Worth a try but there are so many great Quads readily available that I dont think Ill be purchasing this one again anytime soon."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - As a different take on the classic Belgian Quad, I enjoyed this quite a bit and would recommend it for those looking for something original, as this is not the toffee/date/prune bomb one might expect. All around pretty darn good though."

"O-very complex malt and spice and fruit smell make this a great beer"
""
""
"Ultimately, this is a good beer and I'd recommend it if you're looking to try something new, but if you are going to have one quad this year, this beer just isn't quite it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An agreeable enough new-world ode to the Belgian greats of the style, the booze deftly integrated, however the malt just seems more like the simple country cousin, rather than the urbane grand uncle of the family. Glad I got to try it - it's noted here to remind me of just how close it really was that I didn't."

"Overall, a good American Quad. In the future I'll stick to the Belgians, but this was worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a slightly different take on the quad. It lacks the raisin/prune/tobacco flavors (well, it might have a little tobacco), but it packs a big alcoholic punch and a decent toffee-forward flavor. If you are looking to replace St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Westy, look elsewhere, but if you want something to pair with a graham cracker crust cheesecake or toffee bread pudding, this is a solid choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice Quad, with potent flavors that are, for the most part, nicely balanced. The heavy alcohol kick is a bit of a problem, and the beer does feel like it needed a bit more of a bready note to help counter the sugars, but for the most part this is excellent fare."
""
"I don't know why, but I feel ""The Reverend"" sounds like a badass blaxploitation film... Anyway, this stuff pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises fig, chocolate-covered pomegranate, stone fruits, brown sugar, nutmeg, light candied orange peel, and some bready yeast in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the fruits and spices colliding at times with occasionally untoward results. In addition, a vein of booze pokes its head in from time to time. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly pillowy feel. Overall, this is a solid quad, but one that doesn't quite balance the flavors completely. Still, it's definitely worth a shot."
""
"I‚Äôm still rather new to Quad‚Äôs, but this one seemed to be a bit below average. It did get better as it went down."
""
""
""

"Overall: A good example of an ""american born"" quad."

"O - Worth trying and a good domestic quad that is perfect for after a meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber/red. One solid finger of off white somewhat dark head. Lots of stickage on the glass. Excellent head retention, especially for the alcohol content. Smell of grapes, alcohol, raisins, cranberries, and toffee permeate the aroma of this beer. Taste is quite complex. Beer tastes of toffee, sweet malts, caramel, and fruits. Finishes strongly with a raisiny, fruity flavor. Only a hint of alcohol is present and does not interfere with the flavors of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Think this one peaked, but I like the way this came out. Mellow and easy drinking, this was a cellar treat. You can take your time when deciding to crack this one, still very tasty."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the massive inclusion of sweet, bready, banana esters. These dominated the aroma, likely to hide the booze, but did mix well with the otherwise hearty malt base, phenols, vanillas, and spice. The flavor followed in the same vein, but let through a bit more of that aromatic bitterness than sweetness. While this guy certainly preaches on the sweet side, he remains reasonable and always palpable for such a robust style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Its worth a try and if I ever go to Boulder Colorado I would try it again."
""
""
""
""
"Drinks smooth. I like, it tastes good."
""
""
""
"Even though this seems to deviate from the traditional quad, it's tasty and enjoyable."
""
"This is a decent beer. The alcohol is noticeable, but that's fine for the style. The flavor and body are not nearly as full as I would have liked. There are some nice esters that come through that are pleasant but the big, maltiness that I would expect from a quad is missing. The thinness of the body also allows the booze to come through more than I would probably prefer. Overall, this is a nice beer, but certainly not a Quad I would return to."

"The ""Nineteen"" Tripel from Avery suffers the same spice problem, and was even more undrinkable. However, my friend, who is not a big beer drinker (although she has begun to like some craft beers, and I begin to find our tastes are opposed), absolutely loved both. I absolutely love Avery's Czar RIS. I've yet to see an American take on a Trappist which was worth drinking (although I've had only three, the aforementioned two and Brother Thelonious, which has an awesome label)."
""
""
"But...I am not sure I want a whole bomber. Once again, I am reminded that Dave+quad=meh. That said, if I see any of these on the shelf, I may grab one for cellaring. I have known a quad or two that got better over time, and this one has promise."
""
""
"Overall: A very good American take on a Belgian Quad. Has all the malty dark fruit taste you look for in the style."
""
""
"O: This is a good Quad. Looks nice and has a good feel to it. I like the smell of cherries too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful clear dark red, but without much head. Aroma of cherries, raisin, candy sugar. Very very sweet smelling. Lighter mouthfeel than expected, and very smooth. Sweet flavor with cherry and maybe a bit of banana. Slight alcohol warmth bur hides it nicely. This is a bit one dimensional and doesn‚Äôt really touch thr complexities I come to expect from a Quad. Almost like a very sweet and heavy dubbel. Not a bad beer, but there are better examples."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very enjoyable and rather easy drinking quad with well-hidden ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Best quad I've ever had. Wasn't like any other."
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable but definitely a sipper. This style tends to be a little sweet for me (as is this beer) but I will enjoy polishing off the rest of my beer."
""
"All in all, this isn't a bad beer, but it is far from an impressive quad. While I'll certainly finish the bottle, this is a good reason to stick with the tried and true."
"O - A very solid beer, not quite up to par with Belgian Quads but I would drink again. Might like to try this one if on tap sometime..Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a nice quad. Some nice fruit, especially in the nose, and pretty easy to drink for 10% ABV. Would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a fine, respectable American take at the style, but comes up a bit short when stacked against the superior Belgian examples. A bit light in the darker caramelized maltiness which allows much stone fruit esters to come through. For the availability factor alone it is worth a go."
""
""
"Served from a bottle , not much head , good lacing though , cloudy dark amber beer. Smells great , nice mouthful , just for me the taste wasnt there , not really bad , its drinkable , just not a beer I would ever buy again if given the choice of others , the price wasnt too bad , just not one of my favorites"
""
""
""
"Overall ‚Äì A very nice ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù Quad. It has a nice fruity flavor mixed with a great feel and a very nice warming taste. Tasty and well worth a try."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I am very happy that I took the time to review this beer. It is something I have enjoyed in the past, but never really focused on and I think it goes underappreciated as one of Avery's stronger efforts. I look forward to experiencing this one again in the very near future."

"Overall not really the best beer I picked up from Avery but it's not a bad take on the style. I would much rather have a hog heaven."
""
""
"Pours a deep dark maple syrup-colored amber. Hardly any head at all even after a fairly aggresive hard pour. The litttle head there is disappears in seconds and leaves a very faint foam ring. Obviously, no lacing. Faint aroma of candi sugar, raisins, fig and spice on the nose. Accents of all of the aspects mentioned as part of the nose present in the taste plus some biscuit and very distinguishable alcohol. Absolutely no depth to the taste at all, somewhat bland. Overall, I'm not a big fan. There was no head and a barely above average mouthfeel. One of the least complex quads I've had. I have really enjoyed what Avery has to offer, however, I'll pass on The Reverend in the future."
""
""
""
"Dark reddish orange pour with a beige head. Smells candied sweet with banana, plums, floral and cloves. Taste is not as sweet as the smell suggests, although still quite sweet, there are turns of raisin, currants, cherries, and clove-spice notes that try to keep some order to the candy sweet and malt base. Seems better on draft than from what I remember from a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a medium brown color with red hues and a thin off white head that quickly faded. Smells of raisin, clove and candisugar with a hint of banana, very aromatic. Tastes warm and alcoholic with some dark fruits, banana, and clove. The feel is nice and thick with low carbonation and a strong finish. This is a strong quad, a little age would probably do it some good, I would drink this again but wouldn't buy a bottle without putting it away for at least a year."
""
"O: good flavors and some nice complexity. pretty good but there are some better beers for the style"
"That being said, the reverend proved to be a very intriguing mix of spice and flavor that I would not normally expect from a quad. despite the huge nose this beer possesses the consistency was a little to thin and thus the alcohol does mask some of the flavors that the drinker knows is there, but simply cannot get enough out of them to identify. Upon drinking the ale however, the deep fruits meld nicely with the alcohol, and the drinker is left with an interesting earth aftertaste that I have never seen in a quad. The problem however is it is almost too earthy as you soon forget the first notes of the beer, leaving you with a dry bitterness that if eased up on would be rather nice, but sadly it was a hint too much. Interesting nonetheless."
""
"Pours a clear dark copper-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, yeast, and some spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice finish and a slight alcohol kick with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I expected more taste from a quadrupel. It is possible my bottle was bad, but for the price I expected more."
""
""
""
"This beer does not seem like a quadruple... I thought it was more like a strong dark ale. The color and appearance is the main reason for this opinion. The smell is characteristic of a quadruple, and it was enjoyable. The taste was also pleasant. It's not the best quadruple that I have had but Avery makes a good product."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer! Love the subdued alcohol in this one. Very dangerous. Sip this one carefully...or you may end up in the drunk tank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I reserve most of my top overall ratings in the style for true Belgians, as they tend to be the most complex in taste and aroma and always have great creamy mouthfeel. But, The Reverend has captivated me. A delicious beer with impeccable feel and all the elements worthy of the prestige of imbibing from my Westy chalice."
""
""
""
"Great beer, and a great value. Will definitely come back to it."
""
""
""
""
"The masters have this one beat in the feel; sometimes, in an effort to get that rich, full creaminess and strength without the heaviness, a beer goes toward being overly carbonated and crisp enough just to fill, almost like facsimilating a creaminess. This beer tends that way. It could also use more heft for a quad."
""
"Overall a pretty good quad. Not in the same league as the style leaders, but a worthy effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After having my second one of these, I think even more highly of it. It's the cheapest quad I've come across and still the best so far. The flavour is so complex, and very conservative on hop use, allowing me to really pick up on the whole range of the palate. This is possibly the best beer I've ever had. So, possibly also the best for the money since it's almost affordable for a quad. Some of the better budget beers can still compete, though, since they're SO cheap. But this is definitely up there in the top 5 best beers for the money. It's amazingly delicious. I didn't think I was into yeasty beers and this little gem proved me wrong."
"Overall: Overall, very good‚Ä¶better than St. Bernadus Abt 12. No care."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: More and more I think that the general Quad should be split into Belgian and American Quads. This is very tasty, but it doesn't taste all that much like the famous Trappist quads out there. Super tasty beer that is fruit centric and vivid."
""
"Poured out a clear garnet color with orange highlights around the edges and only a thin collar for a head, no lacing. Peaches and cream aroma combined with lesser amounts of raspberries and plums. Has a pretty low phenol level for a Quad, I'm impressed. Tastes of creme brulee and brown sugar, but not very yeasty in comparison to other Quads. Further light flavors of nutmeg spice and some herbal aroma hopping appear around the edges of the beer as it warms up. In my opinion it could have used about 12% heavier noble spice bittering for optimal balance against the sweetness but YMMV as that sort of thing is highly subjective. Medium bodied and lightly carbonation, lightly boozey warming finish."
""
"Bought a half gallon milk jug of this beer which came out to be five good beers. Very good drinkability and very nice smell. Went very good with gourmet mediterranean pizza. Kind of a slight pilsner ending taste. Malty more than fruity. Will definitely drink this again and again. This beer with pizza and a good mma fight made a wonderful night."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, molasses, raisin, toffee, biscuit, toasted grain, grape, candi sugar, and light yeast spices. Some very nice and well balanced aroms; with good complexity and strength. Taste of big caramel, biscuit, molasses, toffee, raisin, fig, toasted grain, light clove, and slight yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, raisin, fig, biscuit, molasses, and light yeast spices on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Extremely easy to sip on; with hardly any alcohol warming noticed other than a minimal warming after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic Belgian quad style. Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to sip on. Loved this one."

"Hot with alcohol. Taste reminds me of apple jack. Sugary yet tart. Fig Newtons and Pop Tarts. Not much hop flavor, but a funky bitterness in the aftertaste that stays with you. More than a hint of cough syrup. Dries out as you sip. Not one of the better examples of the style, in my opinion."
""
"O: A nice take on the quad style. I enjoyed this but was expecting a little thicker, heavier, sweeter type beer like most quads I've come to enjoy. I would still have this again anytime soon!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is underwhelming. It is very sweet and not balanced enough, it does display the toffee and caramel flavors well though."
""
""
"Pretty true to style with dashes of things that can be improved upon slightly. Very good though for an American quad, and on of the better American Quads I've had. This beer is just a touch too sweet and isn't nearly complex but is beginner friendly (if a quad could ever be). Pretty spot on though, Avery should be proud."
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable Quad. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I wouldn't refuse a second glass if it was being offered. The alcohol sneaks up on you after the full 22 oz bottle. I wouldn't go for too many in one sitting. Would like to try on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a very solid quad. Lacked a bit on the nose but made up for it in the taste. If you like belgian ales, acquire a bottle."
""
"(Overall) A worthy experience, this beer is another great one representative of its style. 4"
""
"Overall: glory be the light and mine eyes are open to the golden way! This is one awe inspiring beer that I'm glad that had rested in the belly of this beast! Amen my brothers & sisters...Amen!"

"O: A nice Quad. It differs from most in that it is a very sessionable Quad, which is rare. Dangerous in the fact that you don't get the big alcohol flavor and burn with the bold raisin and dark fruit. You could drink this all night, but you probably wouldn't make it too long."

"Avery The Reverend Quad: This brew is like mixing 3/4 of a Double with ¬º of a Triple. Does that add up to a Quad? The body has a mahogany color, and while pretty dark you can see through it. Not much of a head forms, and that which floats to the surface is off white. What comes in the way of aroma is a mellow mix of malt and hops. This is the first Quad I have tasted, so I was not sure of what to expect. The Reverend comes across as a very good Double to me, with the sweet malt and roasted caramel flavors tempered with a Belgian yeasty and bready notes along with hints of piney hops. Very good!"

"M: Sweet and wet with an intense warming, I'm guessing caused by the generous alcohol content. This is a strong beer that can quitely defeat you."
"A very well done and worthy beer. Enjoy slowly."

"O: A sipper. Every sip is like heaven. Rich finish."

"O: Slightly disappointed, the flavors didn't really stand out for me here."
"Pours brown, kinda opaque-ish, with a nice off white head. Sweet aroma of caramelized brown sugar, molasses, raisins , figs, cherries, and a touch of alcohol. Very sweet flavor; belgian yeast is there with some brown sugar, raisin, fig, molasses, and some alcohol. Medium body to this. Overall, its good but just too sweet for me personally. I will have to try this again on tap and see if I can enjoy it more when I don't have to drink a full bombers worth in one sitting. I definitely noticed my opinion of this was stronger at the start than it was at the end, when the sweetness had just become too much for me."

"O: Not my favorite Dictator beer, but a respectable Quad. Avery has a great line-up, and this flavorful brew just adds to this brewery‚Äôs legacy. I‚Äôd be excited to try any of their other Belgian offerings, anyway."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Full bodied with modest carbonation, and a sweet aftertaste. Unfortunately, there is not a lot to like about this beer. I will pass on it in the future."

"Creamy, just a tad bite of coffee bite, low bitterness, alcohol is just insanely well blended!"
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a very good quad. It does an amazing job of hiding the alcohol. The body feels a little light and there is some bite in the carbonation but it's still a really good beer. I would drink it again, I would recommend it."
"so easy to drink, and so delicious. the well-stocked bottle shop down the street has had this many a time, and I have bought bottles numerous times in addition to having it on tap. this has got to be one of the best of it's kind that is readily available."
"Na Zdravje!"

"this beer beer masks the 10% abv well. goes down better than almost any quad ive had. truly the best american made quad ive ever had"
""
""
"While certainly not my favorite beverage made by Avery it is interesting and worth a try for those interested."
""
""
"Dr: Quite drinkable for the ABV. I enjoy it and would have it again - preferably aged. Hides its ABV well."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a wide mouthed wine glass. Pours a ruby/brown color with little bubbles coming up continuously. This brew has very little head but pretty good retention with a little lacing. Good to know there are still active yeasts in there : ). Speaking of yeast- it smells quite strongly of belgian yeast and also of malt; has an earthy quality to it but crisp. The taste is full-bodied and clean- has the same yeasty and malty qualities as the smell with a little carbonation to keep it refreshing. The 10 percent abv is noticeable but more of a sweet sensation. There is nothing overpowering about The Reverend- everything is well balanced. That being said maybe I would like a little more excitement from a quadrupel? Boulevard's ""The Sixth Glass"" is my favorite but this one holds up to the best of them."

"2.5 finger frothy head with some lacing. Clear, red tinged amber body. strong fig and mild dark fruit aroma with a hint of spice and cola-like. flavor is syrupy with mostly dark fruit and candy like. moderate carbonation and medium to full body. Overall, this is a mild quad. Its not quite as bold as the belgian brewery versions but still a nice drinkable quad."

"DOA"

"The Reverend pours a deep ruby color, more transluscent than expected, almost like a sherry. The initial head was fairly frothy for a quad, but receded fairly quickly as others have noted. The aromas were of banana and cloves, however not very aromatic in my opinion. The taste was some more of the banana spice, along with hints of fruity sweetness, alcohol and belgian yeast imprints. The mouthfeel was nice, a bit dry, nice carb and solid body. Overall for me, this is not a standout brew from Avery, which has a lot of quality in its catalogue. For a quadrupel, I would take Weyerbacher Quad every time."
"it's damn good beer! Cheers to all and enjoy."

"Overall I thought that this was a pretty solid and good quad. It went down smooth, had no off flavors, and it didn't taste boozy at all, but it just wasn't as complex and flavorful as some of the better quads so I can't say that this is a top tier Quad. This beer is dangerously drinkable, it goes down super smooth with hardly any trace of it's 10%, I would have no problem drinking the whole bottle, this is the smoothest, most easy drinking quad I have ever had. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel and the drinkability, the mouthfeel was pretty good for a quad with just the right amount of carbonation and the drinkability was about as good as it gets for a quad, it was also a pretty good value. What I liked least about this beer was that it was lacikng some bolder flavors and wasn't as caramely as the aroma lead me to believe, I would have also liked a little more complexity. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good easy drinking Quad, plus the price makes this a pretty good value compared to what some of the more traditional quads cost and I am always looking for a good value when it comes to craft beer. I would recommend giving this a try if you like Quads, this would also make a good introduction to the style. Avery comes through with another solid beer and the best of their big beers that I have tried so far, they really made one drinkable quad, but in the end it lacked that special something with the flavor to put it on the top level. Good job Avery, you can be sure that I will be on the look out for more of your beers. The Lost Fugawi is still my favorite Quad."
"Pours a murky ruby color with a nice frothy head that fades fairly quickly, lovely lacing. Smells sweet, dark fruits , some banana. Taste starts very sugary, dark fruits , there's a spicyness present, and slight banana. This is a ok attempt at a quad, not anything special but good."
""
""
"D - I haven't had too many quads, but this one certainly is a great beer in my book. Relatively affordable (in CO), well constructed, and doesn't drink like a high abv beer."
"This ale had an agreeable smell and taste for me. Can't really be more specific as I am a real novice. Grew up on Coors and Bud, now in my 60's and enjoying craft beers."
""
""
"o - Overall a nice quad. Some nice fruit, especially in the nose, and pretty easy to drink for 10% ABV. Would have it again."
"Reddish/orange bodied brew topped by a single fingered creamy white head the exhibited decent retention and solid lacing. I smelled toffee malts backed by a solid hop profile with a slight burn from the booze. The taste was similar to the nose although the hops back off as the raisons become more prominent. Aftertaste consisted of sweet malty booze with earthy, grassy undertones. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, well carbonated brew that remains creamy. Overall, a pretty darn tasty brew."
"This smells and drinks a lot like a barley wine. The finish wasn't spectacular and it didn't really fit into the style."

"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is smooth in the feel with a pleasant warming aspect for 10% abv. Overall this was nicely done, I could see it getting even better if given some time to age and mellow. Worth giving a try."
"This was not nearly as good in a bottle when I tried it again later."
"Review: To put it short and to the point like my friend Marcus Andersson, ‚ÄúThis is a complex beer for a simple man.‚Äù Look what it did to the poor guy, yes it‚Äôs him behind the bottle."
"Bomber split with my roommate, pours a light candy brown. Good looking white cream head that tracks lacing. Booze legs, yup. Candy sweet caramel funk in the nose followed by a grain heavy and super sweet tongue - raisins, brown sugar, plum, rum, sour apple, toffee - with a strong booze presence yet solid full bodied mouth on it. Solid brew in my opinion, for the style is pretty damn good. Definitely recommended!"
"Medium bodied with good complexity and balance. VERY drinkable, especially for 10% Be careful!"
"This poured out as a lightly hazy brownish amber color with a cream colored head on top. The head sticks around for a little while but does fade with time and leaves just a bit of lacing. The smell of the beer was sweet, a little boozy and has some yeasty bread aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer was also a little sweet upfront with some fermented dark fruit flavors with some boozy heat in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth and had a good carbonation to it. Overall I found this to be a pretty good Quad, but not my favorite."
"Overall: A good almost average quad in many ways, but there is some smell that seems to affect the taste in subtle ways."
"Overall great beer."
"O- blah, this beer is ok. Probably wouldn't buy it again. I don't know If I am really a big fan of Belgians. So this beer may actually be good for this style I just haven't tried enough to compare it to."
"Overall: the Reverend is not a bad beer at all. It just doesn't fit into a flavor profile that I like."
"This is one of the better Quads that I have had. Lacy head with a clear amber/red fluid. Very inviting. Very complex. Really nice and rich texture of sweet malts followed up with some fruitiness on the finish. High alcohol doesn't warm just hits your head on an empty stomach. Nice clean tongue numb. Really good"
"this is an extraordinarily complex quad. it is smooth and rich and bright and drinkable. Pours an almost nutbrown shade of red and smells immediately of alchohol and yeast. caramel notes in the nose as well. first sip is WOW. very well balanced for a beer of this ABV. as it warms the alcohol comes to the fore even moreso, making the witty commentary on the label ring particularly true. it paired perfectly with a crumly aged english cheddar cheese and toasted flax baguette. i will absolutely be buying more of this fine ale!"
"Overall, I found the beer to be too sweet and fruity, with not enough balance from the other components to pull off the sweetness. It wasn't cloying, but it wasn't complex either. In addition, the aroma of rust and possible taste of iron turned this into one of the worst quads I've had. It's possibly I had a bad bottle, but I'm hesitant to spring for another bomber to find out."
"O: Really enjoyed this one. Smoothness stands out on Avery's interpretation of a Quad. Not one of my favorites, but a solid beer nonetheless. Great pickup at the grocery store for the price."
"A very drinkable beer, but not incredible by any means. Just well done, not exceptional. Doesn't impress or excite at all, but good anywhere anytime."
"22 oz poured into a snifter...huge dark body with a slight head...massive alcohol and malt character...some yeast funk, not quite enough...reasonably drinkable...they didn't nail it, but it's not bad either...pretty good price too, definitely cheaper than a real Belgian quad"
"Served on-tap in a goblet. The Reverend is dark copper in color with a head that faded quickly and left a thin sheath of foam on the surface. The smell was very yeasty and strong in dark fruits such as raisins or plums. It was exorbitantly sweet, probably the sweetest beer I've had to this point, complete with dark fruit and clove flavors so strong that at times I felt as though I was drinking liquid Juicy Fruit. Feels very thick and warm and smooth in the mouth, and the carbonation doesn't bite much. Overall a solid quad, but one I wouldn't pair with a Cajun Crawfish pizza (again)."
"Overall - Its decent but no way can compair to something like rochefort 10 as fair as complex flavors and smoothness. Lacks the spices and balance of hops and malts to set it apart from the rest. Not bad but had alot better."
"This is a delicious beer, and I am sad that Arizona won't be carrying Avery for a long while."
"Interesting beer that is surely worth a visit."
"Overall good beer‚Ä¶ just not a great match for the style in my opinion. Maybe I just drink to many trappists beers‚Ä¶. But I would still recommend giving this beer a try."
"O: When you first sip this, it tastes like legitimate Quad - except, the carbonation seems to fizzy for the style. But the flavor never develops. Quads should unfold their many layers. This hits you with the same surface flavors over and over again. It was a chore to finish the final quarter glass. Of the selection from Avery I've tried, this is the only one that I don't like a lot."
"D- Overall an average quad. Tasted this next to a few others that just blew it away. It is still a good beer (all quads taste good) but for the style I was a bit disappointed. Maybe some time would calm the Alcohol and Solvent notes down."
"This is a pretty tasty quad. Nice color right out of the bottle, reddish brown, fairly clear. Off-white head that sticks around and nice carbonation. Aroma of hops and sweetness. Lacing on glass. Sweet but nice malt backbone. Alcohol isn't too noticeable."
"Pours a cloudy red-brown with little to no head. Smells of light fruits with a crisp finish. Smooth initial taste with a lot of malty sweetness and a hint of hop bite. Finishes with smooth fruit tones and a clean crisp finish."
"Poured a clear amber-orange--perhaps a little lighter than I'm used to seeing in a quad--with a foamy beige head that retained and laced well. Toasty aroma, bready, yeasty, with candi notes, and some dried fruits. Sweet malt base in the taste, caramel, candi sugar and molasses, cherries and currants, a bit of alcohol-y phenols, but nothing that really negatively affects the taste; a bit of spicy hops in the finish. Medium body, and lots of flavor; very nice to drink."
"O- Overall, I think my bottle have have been different than the average one, so take this review for what it's worth. Drinkability was exceptional, and everything else was nice, but it didn't seem all too much like a quad."
"O: Very tasty and smooth; pretty heavy, so its more of a sipper - would be great in the winter; probably not something I‚Äôd have on a regular basis, but a nice change of pace; would probably go well with a big, fat Belgian waffle."
"O: Tough style to live up to, and this certainly doesn't fall short. I just feel like something is left out. Mouthfeel leads you to believe its going to be a huge quad and it just dies on you."
"Overall it is pretty wonderful as a quad and affordable too."
"Pours a clear garnet-copper color with a single-finger white head that falls quickly into a thick collar around the edges. A few bubbles on top as well. No real lacing. The nose brings forward some strong plum and prune character along with milder dark fruits in the background. Light cherry and a very faint amount of caramel. The flavor is sweet with a strong prune flavor and not much balance. Seems like a malty sweetness with fruit; no real yeast participation. Light-medium body with low carbonation and a bit of booze. Not a big fan overall, though nothing seriously wrong with it."
"O: A bottle of reverend is never too far from my fridge. For the price and availability, it's one of my favorite quads out there."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent beer. But since I'm comparing it to the Westvleteren 12, it is losing serious ground nearly by default. That's not to say that's the fault of this beer, it just has stiff competition."
"Overall, this is a very respectable quad from Avery. I will certainly look to drink this one again."
"Great beer!"
"A really great beer. Nice lower carbonation to let the flavors come through. If you're not in Belgium to get what they have to offer, this is a great alternative."
"This beer pours a red amber color with a trace of head that does not retain or lace well. The atoms has hints of caramel malt and pumpkin spices. The taste starts caramel sweet and then has notes of pumpkin and spices. The mouthfeel is balanced, but fairly watered down. Overall a good Belgian quad."
"This Belgium style quad is amber in color and has pronounced notes of caramel and dark fruit in the nose and initial taste, with a hint of spices and a brandy like character in the backbone. Well balanced and wonderfully complex, with a nice warming sensation from the alcohol."
"D - Not bad, a little too sweet for me, good spice"
"o - not bad for a quad, considering the pricing is affordable. it's a big beer with a small price"
"O: Its a decent entry quad, because its not too extreme. However there are many better quads."
"D ~ Well, This isn't readily available anymore unless I buy out the rest of the stock at Corkscrew, but I probably won't do that. Too nutty and boozy. I kinda wish I had someone to help me finish the bomber. It's good but I'm just not that into it."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with very little head. The smell is strong , there is a nut note, and strong cherry smell. The taste is malty and infused with the cherries. The alchool is subtle. Good strong flavor, and nice alchool mellow alchool taste. Overall good but not the best."
"Medium to full bodied, nice carbonation for the style."
"A very drinkable sipping beer."
"I had this one on tap up at the brewery's tap room. Poured a nice amber color, with a minimal amount of light white foam. Aromas of light brown sugar, caramel, candied fruits and alcohol. On the palate, this one is fairly sweet, with a nice bready character and a lingering alcoholic warmth."
"Note: I had two bottles in the cellar and the second was as bad as the first"
"Small mild hint of sourness in the nose, but overall its a big malty beer. Some alcohol burn powering through the taste as well. Not as complex as other quads I've had - it looks nice, but I just didn't dig the flavors all that much. worth a try, but not something I'll be seeking out again."
"O: A nice Quad; not as complete as a Trappist-one but still nice."
"Overall quite pleasant. It's a bit more harshly grainy and less sweet than many other quads, which I'm not sure fits the style, but it's still a good beer."
"Taste starts rich, sweet and caramely; then moves through some molasses and dark bread. Finishes with an alcohol flourish and leaves lingering hints of fruit throughout. Taste is better than the aroma by a longshot here. Faint note of grassy hops is notable. Not as thick and creamy as a Bernardus or Westy 12, and the malts are of a lighter variety - more toast and caramel as opposed to chocolate and roast. Glad I drank this relatively fresh, I dont think oxidation would go well here. Pretty tasty, one of the better American renditions of the style."
"D - Easy, boozy, and slightly sticky in the mouth."
"Mouthfeel - smooth, not robust, definitely a nice one for the summer for me, crisp, not overally sweet"
"O) A very good attempt in a very competitive class."
"O: Good stuff though they ought not call it quad. It should deem itself belgian style strong dark as the term Quad is classified for beers either from Trappist breweries or from those who make beer nearly as complex as them. This is fairly one dimensional and makes for a good beer at a cost which is appropriate (7.95 a btl)."
"Overall -- Decent beer, decent price, not something I would seek out, but a worthy solo beer if you had to drink only one bomber in the night."
"aroma is everything you would want in a quad. rich malty backbone, hints of prunes, figs, earthy tones and light caramel sweetness that is balanced nicely against a tight profile of light spices. really well done. very nice full feel with near perfect carbonation is exactly what i was looking for. the flavor opens up with loads of dark fruits and brown sugar colliding with light spices and a smooth, even flavor that hides the alcohol and smooths the palate. really just a tremendously good offering here."
"Overall, beastly, full flavored quad that sticks to the tradition style and is pretty damn tasty."
"This is a good beer with an interesting dark fruit character, though, it isn't a person favorite. I can see buying it again without question."
"The alcohol is well hidden."
"overall - pretty let down - maybe i will revisit this beer with some age on"
"Taste- A pretty good quad albeit a small one. A direction I didn't see it going in but thats okay since taste was pleasant. I will probably come back to this one."
"O ‚Äì Despite this being absolutely nothing like my initial expectations, I am thoroughly impressed with this brew. It‚Äôs also absolutely out-of-Avery-character, not in terms of quality, but in its raw levels of brute testosterone. Technically, I should inflict endless suffering upon The Reverend on the grounds that it clearly fails to abide by traditional category guidelines ‚Äì but I‚Äôm not going to do that. This is perhaps the perfect example of why I believe beers should not be held to strict standards of ‚Äústyles‚Äù per se. If it‚Äôs a great beer, or a shocker of one, then it should remain so regardless of the words written on its label, the picture on the bottle, the color of the glass, or the marketing and hype attached to it. At the end of the day a beer is what it is, and in this instance the ominous ‚ÄúReverend‚Äù is nothing other than a wonderful brew whose makers maybe dismayed at it‚Äôs ultimate description being simply ‚Äòdelightful‚Äô."
"Pretty good stuff. Considering the ABV, it drinks very well and isn't too boozy. Not nearly as spicy as I thought it was going to be, but quite delicious."
"M & D - good balance, lots of flavor, crisp yet a little sweet. Alcohol is not blatant. Good carbonation. Overall pretty good. I'd have it again."
"Overall-Considering I haven't had many belgian styles in a while this was a good one to wake my palate up too. Good, affordable beer. Got me pretty buzzed after the bomber too. Going to seek out some more Belgians soon."
"A disappointment frankly... I was hoping for more out of this one.."
"O- A decent Quad, but nothing that's much above average. Hides the 10% well. Nothing worth seeking out too much."
"This beer is a bit lighter than I would normally expect in a quad. It is garnet colored with a nice dense light tan head. The aroma is mostly Belgian yeast with a mild sweetness and a bit of alcohol. It has a good spicy clovey flavor from the yeast with a low level of fruitiness. The mouthfeel is light as it should be, but does not have good high levels of carbonation that I would expect. Overall, good drinkable light quad. Not the best, but definitely a solid offering by Avery."
"O: The beer definitely tastes strong, but the alcohol is well masked. However, it's definitely a beer that needs to be sipped because of all the sweetness."
"O: Overall, a nice take on a quad by Avery. nothing that is going to blow your mind but goes down easy and is very pleasing while watching the NCAA tourney."
"O: probably the best American-born Belgian Quad I've had; complex and strong; really a heavyweight in the alcohol department, so be careful! I'd drink it all day if it weren't so strong"
"Good thick two finger head and excellent lace structure. The color of the brew matches a 18 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is sweet, with fragrances of raisin, honey, clover, malt, strawberry, roasted oats and barley. The taste is sweet, with flavors of raisins, melon, strawberry, cherry, figs, honey, spices, clover, barley malt, melon, and oats. Very creamy feeling over my tongue and palate. Other than being quite sweet, and high in alcohol, I could drink quite a few of these. This brew goes good with desert, and sharp cheese."
"Deceivingly strong. A little too sweet to warrant another. Spicy with raisin and hint of cherries. Undesirable aftertaste. Very small head. Rum comes to mind along with molasses and bread. Did i say it was strong yet ;/ great valueat $6.99. Orange to amber in color. Purchased from giant eagle."
"Overall: A tasty and drinkable American quad, that although somewhat one-note, is still a great beer."
"The medium mouthfeel and the relatively well hidden alcohol make this an interesting brew to try. BUT, be careful of the high abv. Not very drinkable to me due to the excessive sweetness."
"Alcohol is well blended with a simple clear flavor. Mostly one dimensional but smooth and easy as possible. certianly very accessible for a quad and enjoyable to drink."
"Extremely bready and similar to the nose, the sweetness provides a taste bud filter to the alcohol just a bit and then about halfway through the sip it comes forward and says hello. I can't get the rum soaked cherries and raisin bread out of my head here; although, I do get a hint of candy apple pomegranate in the finish. It's solid and for just $7 for this 22oz bomber, what a great deal! I paid $17 for my last bottle of Allagash Four and this one graduates in the same class at less than half the price! What a delightful surprise! Solid, punchy, sweet but not as complex as the other big dogs in its class but at just $7 bucks a bomber, I didn't expect the type of quality I'm getting here and for that I'm giving it a B+ for a solid brew at an amazing value!"
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is candy sugar, brown sugar, dates and alcohol. The beer smells like a quadrupel should. The flavor is heavy on the alcohol, but I also get a lot of candy sugar and dark fruit notes. There is also some caramel malt notes and a little bit of molasses. Medium to full mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"**I enjoy most of what Avery has to offer. This is just not as big a success to me as some others in the lineup."
"I would recommend this to anyone"
"Drinkability: One large bottle is going to be more then enough, but I will finish it :)."
"A very good quad that I liked (I don't have a lot of quad history...), just a touch of sweetness and I was surprised at the very easy drinkability."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with medium-low carbonation. sweetness starts to wear on you after a while, knocking the drinkability back. [edit: knocking the drinkability score back further. really running out of gas on this one.] not on the level of a belgian quad (you might argue it's a borderline quad to begin with) but then, what is?"
"I know I've had this bottle for at least a year, and it is still pretty hot (I'm getting redundant). So age it longer, maybe. It's a good brew, though, and I like it. Hell, I've enjoyed it fresher than this many times. It's not Koningshoeven, (and what else is?) but it's a good Quad. Especially for the price."
"D - Very potent abv - sneaks up on you in a bomber. Not at all filling, which has been my problem with other quads. A really interesting affect to the palette."
"Thin tan head and deep burgundy color. Very plesant aroma of abbey phenolics. Tastes of caramelly malt and banana, but the body is appropriately thin. Some hop bitterness on the back end, but this isn't hoppy in any real sense."
"D: Like drinking a liquified rum raisin bread."
"D - The smell and taste are astonishingly bad, so there is just no drinkability here. It is so bad that I do not have an inclination to commit not-critical elemental observations as to the experience. In the interest of summarizing my objection to this brew, however, I will pontificate on this matter of sheistiness. There is a nasty wet hay element in the malt and a horrendously foul mushy pea aroma from the hop 'contribution'; the essence of the beer is putrid."
"Good clear colour and a nice large creamy head when poured into a large glass. The belgian yeast scents are here, very appealing nose that beckons you to taste. Nice malty, fruit based notes taste typical for a beer of this style. Quite sweet, but it balances the high alcohal well. Very easy to drink for a 10% beer. Overall this is a good beer and I like the labeling."
"Poured a dark amber/cooper color with a small head and lots of carbonation rising from the bottom. Begian yeast, alcohol, fruits and a floral note make this a delight in the glass. A real creamy brew, that is also tart, but not sour. I didn't know what to expect here, but I really enjoyed it. 10%, this was smooth, mellow, and went down easy. Had a hard time sharing it so I just kept drinking. Man, something nice here."
"D: Seems like they used the sweetness to hide the ABV. Very drinkable, but it really doesn't seem to be a true quad. Don't get me wrong, its a fair bottle and I am a fan of Avery, but look elsewhere in their label."
"Middle of the road beer for me that I think is miss labeled. More of a Dubbel for me rather then a Quad or BSDA."
"D - 5.0 - Dangerously drinkable. You cannot sense the alcohol here. The tastes are incredibly complex and clean and crisp at the same time. Very well done!"
"The 10% alcohol does sneak up on you a little. You can drink this pretty fast due to the sweetness, but be careful..."
"This beer would be rated higher if it was a tripel, but its labeled a quad."
"Like I said, this is sweet and you might find yourself gulping it, but at 10% ABV, you'll need to slow down."
"Drinkability is soild. Like most quads, it's a sip by the fireplace! I like the feel of this beer a lot. Good job and nice spin on this style."
"I wish I was a better reviewer of beers, tastes, smell, etcc. I'm not great with these so I'll do the best I can here. Nice Brown, red, amber coloer. good tan, thick head. Nice Taste. Really this is a very enjoyable beer to drink, nice fruity, Belgium. I'll buy it agian if i see it."
"D - Good drinkability, the alcohol is not overpowering as expected."
"You can tell it's 10% and at this richness there's no way I'm doing more than one pour in a row."
"A ten ounce pour that was dark reddish brown in color came with no head. Temperature was a bit too cold so after first sip, let sit a few minutes. Aromas of malt goodness with a touch of fruit. Taste was malty goodness with very little bitterness. Alcohol content was present but not overpowering. Drinkability is good if you limit yourself, otherwise I'd say lower due to the brew being 10%. I've had this brew on several occassions and will sip it again, though one is generally enough; glad this was a small pour versus a bomber."
"D: Good drinkability. Not a heavy alcohol taste, despite the abv of 10%. Will drink again."
"M/D - I was really looking forward to trying this one and now that the mystery is over this isn't one I'll be looking for again. Don't get me wrong, not a bad beer, but not a great Quad. Found it mostly too hot and not well balanced and frankly not a Quad."
"Edit: Wow...can't believe I am doing this...but bumping a few categories up .5. I let this warm up to about 55 degrees and it came alive."
"Overall impression: decent quadrupel but not my favorite. what it lacks in body and carbonation, it makes up in taste. recommend serving at a lower temp to enjoy the true flavor. worth a try."
"The color on this one surprised me. The best way to describe the color on this beer is that it is the same color as honey. That golden dark yellow with some orange in there as well. It smells sweet and doughy. Some dried fruits are hidden in there as well like apricots. It taste a little too sweet for my liking. It is a Belgian Quad that has been Americanized with over the top sweet fruit, an odd yeast like taste, a dry finish with a lot of alcohol. A little too much going on with this one. It's a very good beer but be ready for your taste buds to be overloaded with flavors."
"Very drinkable for the 10%. Smooth sweet and toasty American Quad. Worth seeking out."
"D: I wouldn't exactly describe this as a Belgian Quad. This tastes, looks, and smells like a failed, hot, and sweet mess that tried to be like Victory V12. I was reluctant to finish it."
"Sweetness - perhaps too sweet. A bit cream-sicle, maybe, but it still tastes like that Belgian quad. The dark coloration and creaminess are major benefits, but too much is truly too much with this beer, even when we're talking 10 flat abv. It could be easier to drink, and I don't like fighting sweetness; that feels less manly."
"D - really soild quad here. I feel like I pass up Avery too frequently...beers like this remind me why I need to buy more from them."
"Whenever we purchase The Reverend at Argonaut Liquors, the check-out staff always teems over it, packaging it specially, sometimes praying over it. Every time, but only at Argonaut ... :: ponders ::"
"D - I don't think I'd drink more than one due to the alcohol and sweetness even though it was decently hidden. Decent beer."
"Notes: I have no idea how old this bottle is when I drank it (on 9/17/10). It's been in my DBF for about a month, maybe 6 weeks. Before that, I'd venture to guess that it spent at least 2 years in my cellar, probably more like 3 or even 4 years. It doesn't seem to be any worse for wear, as they say."
"D: Very good. The 10% does not bite too hard."
"Pours amber with a slight head that doesn't stay. Smells are sweet caramel malts with some slight funk, very pleasant. Taste is sweet, some malts and some figs, fruity with possibly some candi sugar? Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy, very good drinkable beer."
"If you like the strong, Belgian-style sippers as a digestif, then this will not disappoint. This is very different from Avery's barleywine and pale ale variants, which have a similar hop profile. I was thinking all Avery beers are like Maharaja--which isn't necessarily a bad thing--and this was different, and therefore surprising."
"D: The 10% doesn't come through in the taste at all, but I can feel it on an empty stomach. Too sweet for me to drink regularly (and definitely not what I expected from an alleged quadrupel) but still very drinkable. The Reverend is a Good Beer."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice, solid, regal appearance, nose is not complex but full and robust. Flavor, also, not so complex but pure, full, and robust. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D- a tasty quad from an american brewer. Really accessible and easy to enjoy. Up againts the best from begium its rather solid."
"D-a nice boozy sipper if you like that kind of beer. Not the best or my favorite of this style but I enjoyed drinking it"
"M & D - Nice and fluffy. Well balanced and carbonated. boozy but not too overwhelming. Drinkable and delicious. higher ABV."
"Opaque, cloudy red-amber with average to medium lacing. Poured this one into a small wine goblet. First whiff is a sweet candy, some clove, spice, and then a profound jab of alcohol burn. At 10% ABV, this one's definitely a sipper. Faithful to the Belgian style, but substantially more assertive. Quite tasty, but perhaps a mite too heavy-duty to really enjoy often."
"btw - this brew tastes like a distant cousin to a scotch ale !"
"I tried this beer on January 6, 2010 at 'The Beerbistro' in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This is my first beer of 2010. The beer poured a semi-translucent orange brown with a thin tan coloured head...very light for a Quad. The aroma was very weak, but did have some malt and yeast. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, and mildly carbonated. The flavour was sweet malt, sugar, yeast, and plums. A good beer, but not in the same class as Trappist/Belgian quad"
"D- A good sipper. When I went into the liquor store I started talking to an employee and he suggested this. I am glad that I tried it and I did enjoy it, but I would not buy it very often. According to Avery's website it can be cellared for up to 4 years and I would like to see how it is after that much time."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Pours amber with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of bananas and slight alcohol. The flavor was of fruit, malt, alcohol, and pear upon swallowing. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The flavors present definitely mask the alcohol flavor but it is still present. It is scary drinkable which could get you in trouble quickly as it is quite enjoyable as well."
"Haven't had this one for a while and it was on sale, so I picked it up. Very sweet, reminds me of a big doppelbock, kind of like Samiclaus. Not a ton of fruity or yeasty flavors, but still pretty tasty. Might be better to split the bomber with someone, palate fatigue from the sweetness!"
"Drinkability: High drinkability, both in spite of and because of the funkiness. (There's that word again, I know.) Still, more than a pint is a lot to drink, especially for something with 10% abv."
"Just video reviewed this one over at my blog. Overall impressions are of a very nice Quadrupel, within the range of those produced in Belgium, but with a hoppier character and a dryer finish, and without some of the more complex fruity character you get from the better quads. Very drinkable, alcohol well-hidden given the abv, and definitely worth the price, but not the greatest quad I've ever had."
"Review must be over 250 characters and less than 5,000. Apparently we shouldn't be snobs, but shouldn't not be snobs, either."
"M/D: the feel is medium bodied an quite harsh not what I've seen with other quads. The dinkabilitu is ok but definitly not my favorite and it's a little hard to finish because of taste and feel."
"The Reverend is quite drinkable; featuring plenty of character to offset the high abv, and a pleasant palate. Not for the weak of heart, but worth a try if you like the Belgians."
"This quad pours a beautiful burnt orange almost amber color with about 1 finger of foam with a pleasant almost whipped appearance. Nice floral bouquet with a hint of sweetness behind it. The taste is just as pleasant as the appearance for me. Not over powering alcohol flavor considering the ABV%. Nice sweetness to start,brown sugar and citrus orange notes, coats the palate well and has a nice toasty malt finish that lasts and is slightly bitter."
"D: big abv to be too drinkable. Big and complex even if abit our of balance."
"Very good"
"I actually enjoyed this beer, a lot. It ended up being way better than I thought it was going to be and Ill buy it again. I think the biggest problem with this brew isnt the beer itself, its what it gets compared too. This beer is in the same category as Westy 12, Rochefort 10, and St Bernardus 12?!?! which are three of the top BEERS not just the top quads. So its no where near those, but that doesnt mean its bad; because its actually pretty darn good."
"I've been drinking this beer for a solid 6 months now, so it is time for a review. This beer has so many layers and is so complex, it is pretty amazing. Other reviewers give this one a heavy alcohol smell, but I can't detect it and my wife who is VERY sensitive says no to the heaviness after she saw some of these reviews as well. This weekend we picked up a few other popular American quads and still the Reverend comes out on top. The complexity of this beer is mind blowing, there is really nothing like it I've ever had. It pours OK, I gave it a 4 out of 5. This quad goes down so smooth, but it isn't heavy like a typical Belgian quad. It does have the ""this beer will Fu@k you up"" if you drink it fast though. Be warned. I REALLY wish Avery would 4 or 6 pack this one, $7 bombers are getting expensive so this limits us to a Reverend a week."
"Too bad I have to go to Houston to get these, and they don't have the full lineup, I could drink Avery all the time otherwise."
"D - The little cloying that remains and the high ABV make prevent this from being very sessionable. Nice to try, though. Good beer."
"Drinkability: not a session beer because of the alcohol - nice taste - not too rich. Pretty light for a quadrupel."
"Pours a wonderful golden color with beautiful foam/head... Slight lacing on the glass. Smells like a typical belgian, but it tastes so much better than most. It gave me a pretty quick buzz, but I was lovin every minute of it. Looking forward to drinking more of this fine beverage."
"Would be very glad to have more of this."
"This isn't really close to any other Quad I've had, American, Belgian, or otherwise. Almost like a Barleywine with a slight Belgian edge. It definitely has character, just not a character that's really pleasing to me."
"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ. Pour was a dark copper color with a small head but what bit there was had good retention and left some tracks. First impression though was that it was a bit light for a proper quad. Aroma has sugary plums, light amounts of butter, and a vinous quality. Tastes of sweet malt and fruits, plums, grapes, light butteriness, light phenols, and a spicy cookie finish. Medium to full in body with fuller amounts of carbonation. Decent quad, though pretty middling coming from a respected operation like Avery. Might have been an impressive American version of a quad ten years ago, but not today."
"The body was good, a little on the full side of medium, with a slightly sticky finish. Drinkability was very good, I'll certainly try this again. Overall, a good beer that I enjoyed, but the word that kept coming to mind was light. This was perhaps the lightest example of this style I've had. Still, a good beer, and worth your time."
"Notes: Overall very pleasant and enjoyable."
"D: A very straightforward quad whcih could use a more varied maltbill. The malt quantity is adequate, but the flavors lack some complexity. Still, I enjoyed this a lot and would give it a try again, especially with some age on it to see if it could develop more depth."
"D: one bottle is enough for me. I would drink it again at a price tag of 5.99, for 10 percent for 22 ounces, but would much rather buy a 11.2 ounce rochefort 10 for 4.99."
"pours a dark clear copper/amber with a white, filmy, and quickly dissipating light tan head. the nose is just beautiful- toasty and sweet with candied fruits. mmm. the taste is dominated by sweet malt. candied yams and fall with backrounds of dark fruits and pleasant nuttiness. reminds me of pancakes and syrup, never a bad thing. biscuity goodness and sugar sweetness. alcohol as it warms. im going to seek out another one of these."
"Drinkability: Definitely feels like it could give a good knock out so only the 22oz is all that is needed."
"It was very drinkable. It went down oh so smooth. The alcohol was barley noticable, which is hard to pull off. So props to Avery for that for sure."
"Well, at 10% abv with some challenging flavors I don't think this brew is especially drinkable or meant to be. Lately I have been trying to open up to Belgian beer styles. I have enjoyed the new flavors, but they really haven't become obsessions or new favorites. This is a good beer with a monstrous abv for the price. It was fun picking it apart as far as I am able."
"D: A bit of a heavy hitter, but nothing too hot at all. It goes down very smooth with plenty of warming which makes it so much more pleasant to drink slowly. As it breathes and warms, the flavours open up a little more, like a red wine. That's a nice quality to have, and though I might not put it on the same pedestal as I would with other quads, it's still a pretty tasty beer."
"O:does not come close to other quads, don't like their yeast too sickly sweet"
"Mouthfeel is slick and one tidge short of syrupy. Hints of candied fruits and a bit of a funky alcohol taste (which I like). Great quad for the price- and its local to me."
"D-great mouthfeel but it just shows the alcohol too much. lots of funk in there and I'm not a big fun of the big funk."
"The Reverend is a pleasant enough American-made quad. It's not in the same class as a few recognizable Belgians, but at $5.99 for a bomber, it's the best priced."
"I have yet to be dissapointed by Avery's big bomber lineup -add yet another winner. @ 7 bucks for 22 ounces for a delicious quad, this one is a no-brainer."
"First time I've tried a quadrupel, so here it goes. Served out of a bottle into a pint glass. Poured nice with decent light brownish head. The beer was amber in color with a clear body. It has smells that are lightly fruity and hoppy which blend together well. The smell is reciprocated with the taste which adds a nice bite to the whole mix. For me the alcohol content and bite that the beer has make it a little difficult to drink, but I like hoppy beers enough that I could have a couple."
"D- The alcohol seems to lend a bizarre medicinal and astringent taste that isnt very pleasing to me."
"Yeah, that's still sweet as hell. I get a little bit of a medicinal flavor now."
"The mouthfeel is slightly thin, but still good. I like a beer with more substance though. Most belgians I've had have been a bit thicker. I think I'll have to try this one again to get a full feel for it and really appreciate it."
"Pours a caramel with a light tan froth, good retention, & average lacing. The nose is pronounced & complex with aromas of caramel, raisins, clove, banana, prunes, toffee, light earthiness, brown sugar, very light orange, spice, & a sourdough starter yeastiness that follow through on the palate with additional flavors of dark belgian candy sugar, maple syrup, figs, & alcohol. For being such a high abv beer, the alcohol is well hidden. Overall this is a very good beer, but, unfortunately, not as good as it's Belgian brothers. To be honest, I'm on the fence between a B+ & an A-, however, I'm an Avery fan so I'll go with an A-. Recommended."
"Taste is awesome! Pretty damn complex with a light hoppiness and a solid toasty/malty backbone to it. Great beer and my favorite quad after three philosophers."
"Pours a hazy, copper color and a lighter golden along the bottom of the glass. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, slight hops, yeast, slight citrus, and molasses. Fits the style of a Quadruple. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly creamy with an average carbonation level. The alcohol is so strong at first it burns the throat, but that passes after the initial taste. Tastes of alcohol, slight hops, caramel, sweet malt, slight tart malt, and a toffee sweetness. Overall, the alcohol is not well blended, but otherwise a good body, complexity, and aroma."
"Poured from 22oz into a chalice glass. Had thin head that faded immediately. Pours light amber copper and very clear which I found surprising for a quadruple. Aroma is malt and toasted malt with slight hints of fruit. Taste is also of the malt up front then hints of alcohol finish which could be masked better. The viscosity of this beer is thin but the body still shows through well and is accompanied by a good flavor profile that is typical of the style. Over all a good Belgian considering it comes from Colorado."
"D. One 22oz bottle is plenty. A great brew to share with a friend. A must if you like quads and are lokking to define the style for yourself."
"upon revision I realized what it reminds me of: Malta (I tried it with tequila once and this tastes pretty damn close)"
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a small head that doesn't last long and leaves little lacing. The appearance is amber and a bit cloudy. The smell is slightly of grassy hops, maybe some piney character there. The taste is of roasted malt with a little chocolate and moderate hops. The high alcohol is noticeable and does not blend well, like adding a jigger of Everclear to a pint. (We've all done that, right?) If I were in the mood to get hammered it would be nice. The feel is full bodied, and I get the alcohol in the finish. Not one of which to drink one after another, but interesting."
"(D)- This was a very disappointing beer. I have thus far, enjoyed most of Avery's offerings, but this one falls very short; it really doesnt even fit the style at all. This was definitely not a bad bottle, its just not in the ballpark so to speak, let alone the same planet."
"not a good a style example as the ""ruler"" series brethren Maharaja."
"D- Nothing spectacular here, not the quad taste I was hoping for."
"D- Overall, not the best quad out there, but by no means the worst...definitely worth a try, but don't be surprised if you can find a better Quad out there..."
"A light off copper color, with white lacing around the edges. Smell is fruity, almost grapey. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Taste isn't highly complex but has a sweet church wine characteristic to it. The sweet taste makes this a more welcome albeit strong spirit."
"I was hoping for something more complex from this beer. I hate to be let down from one of my favorite breweries."
"The drinkability is a bit hard, not too hard to drink a bomber, but I wouldn't be opening another."
"Only moderately complex, but still a very enjoyable quad. High ABV is noticeable and reduces drinkability."
"D-- Not that great. Disappointed would be the word I would use. The ABV (10%) is there but it is drinkable. Better options out there. Too sweet I think. Almost like a Jolly Rancher."
"D: Very doable...though a bomber might be a bit much right now. Don't get that much booziness at all which is good."
"Easy to drink for the most part. The sweetness is a bit overdone in my opinion. Still a tasty quad from an American brewery. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"This one starts off pretty good but at the end of the sip everything goes wrong."
"Nice orange peel finish."
"Thanks to Avery for bringing a cask of this down to Trinity. Pours a hazy brown with a thin tan head. Nose has ripe fruits, candy malt and peppery yeast. Taste has herbal yeast, spicy alcohol and bready malts. Medium body is well carbonated. Cask definately adds to the mouthfeel and overall complexity."
"Notes: I must recognized that I¬¥m not very learned about quads, not even at my aficionado level. And sure, I was sort of expecting something more, something more special. If I had not had those preconceptions I would have probably enjoyed more what was a solid and nice brew. And yet, next to other quads, or certainly the complexity of most barley wines, it felt a bit, quite a bit actually for me, forgettable."
"Recommended."
"D- I like it...it is a bit of a heavy beer, but I wouldn't shy away fron having it again if given the opportunity"
"D=enjoyable beer, ABV to high to enjoy too many..."
"D. Average. NOTHING SPECIAL BUT IT IS NOT TERRIBLE."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is slightly short of bar syrup. Very thick and cloying and not bad for style. Overall this is exceptionally boozy and hard to drink, this my mouthfeel score."
"The feel is severely thick and syrupy. High-density, like a red-wine. Smooth and oliy and big. This is a solid quad all around; it's complex and bittersweet. Like a hefty red wine and a fruity white."
"This quad struggles to find a taste. But the taste can't make it through the wall of synthetic/chlorophenol flavor which greets you with the first sip. It's a big beer ... a sipper for sure, took a lonnng time to finish."
"Closing notes - I rated this beer as I did because I don't consider it poorly made or anything. It's not my type, but it seems rather unique. If it's not exactly a Belgian Quad, well it's not exactly made in Belgium. It's an American craft ale from an American craft brewery with a lot going on. For that, I couldn't rate it very high, but I wouldn't discount it either."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but I will not likely be looking for this one again. The ""off"" scent in smell is a bit of a turn off and the flavor just doesn't match up with others in the style."
"D- The alcohol is definitely there in the this one, so it is definitely a sipper. It isn't the best Quad that I've tried, but definitely not the worst. The"
"I'm a little disappointed, as this doesn't really compare well at all to the better Quads I've had."
"D: Somewhat drinkable, I would enjoy a big bottle to myself."
"I think that this would go nicely with roasted meat, given its sweet toasted malt character, it would overwhlem any seafood preparation, maybe a glazed tuna would work. A nice hunk of Stilton or Aged Cheddar, with a slice of dark bread would also work nicely. Maybe even a toffee preparation. overall good, but not quite as complex as coprable Belgian versions."
"Overall a pretty good beer, but not the first quad I'd reach for, though I do like the slightly hoppy twist."
"Drinkability: Overall, I'd be lying if I said I didnt really enjoy it. Its too sweet for me though, and I really like a sweet belgian. Theres just not enough other interesting flavor to balance the sweet for me. Good, but not the same ballpark as the classic quads like St Bernardus or Rochefort, not even the same sport."
"Poured into a snifter for a clear ruby brown body with a quickly receeding head that is well-carb'd. A thick smell of caramel and other sugary goodness, along with yeast and some dark fruits. Also a hint of spice and fruits like orange and grape; slightly medicinal though. A heavy, full-bodied slightly smooth/creamy brew where the ABV pokes out a little. There is a little bit of yeasty fluffiness for a slight bready mouthfeel, along with carmelized malt and some sweetness. Finishes with a quasi-sour hop bitterness backbite that is mostly smooth and clean. Contains some orange and grape taste. A somewhat complex brew that isn't bad, but is just a little off to be a really good quad."
"Looking forward to another bottle."
"Overall, this beer is really well done. It has all the characteristics I would expect in a Belgian quad but it may be lacking in the subtle qualities that define the genuine originals."
"Final thoughts: This beer is a little different from other Belgian beers I've had. Its got a much more one-dimensional flavor, less complexity than what you normally expect with Belgians. Still a very good beer. I like beers that pull off nice caramel sweetness and ""The Reverend"" certainly does. Forgive any spelling and grammar errors in this review, this beer hides its 10% AVB pretty well and I drank all 22oz in about 12 minutes!"
"Pours a pleasant brick red colour with a limited head. I'm really struggling with the nose: yeast and bubble gum with alcohol fumes, but somehow not repulsive. The taste reflects the nose, but with a slight woodiness and maybe a hint of vanilla or even aniseed. I don't dislike this: I find it surprisingly one dimensional yet remarkably difficult to describe! Shockingly easy to gradually drain a large bottle of such a strong beer."
"Admittedly, this is my first quadrupel and this one tasted good enough to peak my interest, but I imagine that there are ones out there that are a lot more balanced and smooth. I'd like to try more of this style to compare."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Clean, light character keeps this one flowing."
"Beer poured into my Rochefort chalice forms a 2 cm head that dies quickly. Minimal lacing but a nice burnt orange color. Nose is malts, a little citrus, and some floral, almost purfume like hop notes. Pretty complex and appealing nose here. Creamy mouthfeel is immediately noticeable along with a straightforward malt presence. Finish is a bit bitter with a prolonged warming alcohol sensation. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit but there are some that are a notch above."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: This was thick and creamy in the mouth with a very full body and a dry finish."
""
""
"D: A definite sipper. I look forward to enjoying more from Avery."
"D - Certainly a sipper. Without much experience with the Quad style, I am not sure how well it stacks up to its peers, but I think it is a good introduction and it certainly has me thinking about exploring further."
"D: I'm not too sure about this beer. On one hand it isn't all that bad, but I'm not reminded of a quad when I drink it. Too clear, too carbonated and too cloying, not to mention the strange ""funkiness"" in the background. I will probably pass this up the next time I see it."
"D- definitely a drinkable beer despite the 10%"
"This stuff was strong, delicious, and I will definitely be going back to pick out more quadruple's to try!"
"A very good beer. This was my first Quad, and it only enticed me to try some others."
"There is a fair amount of carbonation, and there is some bite to it. It takes a while for it to become creamy, but it does. Medium bodied, goes down fairly easy, though the alcohol has quite a large presence. Interestingly, I did not find it to be as sweet as others - in fact I found it fairly well balanced, though it is of course sweet and malt-heavy."
"Drinkability= Not super high, great beer though. The Abv. and sweetness bring the drinkability down. I think it's a good example of the style."
"D: I... don't know how to respond to this one. It's kind of like having a sandwich where the bread is on the inside and you have to eat the pepper separately. This has many of the right ingredients, and a lot of potential, but right now it's kind of just thrown together. With a little refinement, the rough edges on this beer could make it very good. Right now it's just decent. I won't buy this again soon, but if I hear the formula has been tweaked, I'll pick it up."
"I really enjoyed this beer."
"On to the beer! Looks like clear dark honey. A nice ring of white foam. Smells like wild orange blossom honey and sugar, with Belgian yeast strain notes. Taste is spot on for an Americanized Quad. Sweet, almost cloying, with earthy bready qualities and a pronounced tangy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is near creamy. With the ABV and immense sweetness, it's a bit of a sipper."
"Drinkability- Pretty decent quadrupel, not the best, but definitely one I could have a few of."
"for this style - mouthfeel is a bit sticky - one bomber this time was fine -alcohol is strong but well hidden here - i'd buy this again, but not too soon."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is dark fruits and nuts.Taste is sugar cane,dark fruits,nuts and butter.This beer is very smooth and hides the alcohol dangerously well.Overall a good beer that I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"-Dotson"
"Beer poured an amber color with a decent head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is sweet ripe fruits and sugar. Taste is candy sugar up front, with a dose of plums soaked with booze. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy weight wise and pretty smooth across the palate. Overall drinkability is pretty good. It is a whopper of a beer that you definitely notice the gravity as you are sipping it."
"A flavorful Quadrupel, especially as it warms. The alcohol slightly outweighs the other flavor profiles at times. This offering is a nice treat, but there are other Quadrupels that I enjoy more."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep red color with a finger of off white head. Leaves a bead of retention around the entire glass. Smell is almost all Belgian sugar cane and malts. Taste is very sweet and malty, alcohol is almost none existent. Thick coating mouthfeel, so sweet it almost hurts my teeth. This beer is about as drinkable as a quad can be. As far as this style this one of my favorites. I drink this often but I've had better quads, just harder to come by but they bring this ones ratings down a little. Overall a very solid quad."
"This is a big beer, no doubt. It's complexity is there, but it still seems a bit rough. Still a good beer though, well done by Avery as usual."
"Good beer."
"I could of drank more than one, very smooth and balanced despite the 10ABV."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. A very nice sipping beer for a cool evening. I think buying a bottle to cellar is in order."
"Drinkable but I would prefer a bit more carbonation. It's a pretty straight forward beer but it packs a big punch. Would be a nice night-cap."
"Great job Avery!"
"(Time for a refill - 22oz bottle) I poured the remaining beer in my glass. The beer got even heavier and sweeter as I continued drinking. I found it increasingly hard to finish...But, I gutted it out. It felt like it was sticking to my tongue and teeth. There was no way I was going to get beat by a 'Quad'. I have to admit though, I couldn't drink two Reverends."
"I either got a bad bottle or this is not good."
"Notes: Admittedly, I'm not the most experienced with Quads. But, the few that I have had were exponentially more complex than this. The flavors that are there are decent, but become increasingly un-interesting as the glass empties. Also, way too sweet for my personal preference. Not great, but not horrible. Valiant effort by Avery, but it just falls short."
"All things considered approachable and drinkable with lots of character and interesting aromas and flavor. Very different than virtually every other Belgian Strong Dark or Quad I have had."
"A big brew that is not for the squeamish, but, considering the wallop it packs, actually quite drinkable. Scarily so."
"Poured a copper-amber color with a head that rapidly dissappeared leaving a hint of lacing that marked it's presence. Really sweet smelling, so much that I approached my first sip with trepidation. I can't stand a super sweet to the point of cloying taste in my beer and I was worried this is where this smell was taking me. Fortunately it wasn't the case, yes this beer tasted sweet, but it was a complex multiple fruit flavors type of sweet, definetly not overbearing. The 10.0% was there but hidden reasonable well and I got a lot of different flavors during my time with this beer, apple, figs, yeast, caramel. One bomber was plenty, but I enjoyed the complexity of this brew. So far everything I've had from Avery has been worthwhile and The Reverend delivered an noteworthy experience."
"Review written from quick notes during the BCS Championship, and before I drowned my sorrows. Poured a clear, almost pale amber with strawberry hues. I had to take a second look at the label to make sure I had the correct brew, as it looked more like a Belgian strong or such. What little head that existed fades quickly, with some small streaks of lacing left along one side of the glass. Smelled of pears, and various other dark fruits and malts. Once again, not at all what I was expecting, but maybe it's just me. Tastes of sweet malts, candy, alcohol, some more light fruits, and maybe even some chocolate sweetness with some phenolic activitiy wrapping things up. It was medium bodied, and fairly well carbonated. While this wasn't what I was expected, or what I look for in a Quad, it wasn't a bad tasting beer. That being said, as much as I dig Avery's brews, I probably won't be going back to this one if I'm looking for a quad."
"drinks easy but a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish, mouth is slightly oily and thick."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a small off-white head that had poor retention. Very little if any lacing is left on the glass. The smell is typical for a Quad. Smells very sweet with sugar and the malt. Some dark fruit is also detected. The taste is also sweet. Has a tart apple quality to the flavor. Maybe some cherry as well. The alcohol is well hidden dispite the 10% ABV. Medium bodied with abundant carbonation. Nothing but average mouthfeel. Not the best American interpretation of a Quad. Still drinkable because of good taste and value."
"Overall...very good."
" mouthfeel and drinkability are good but not great. One bomber will do, for awhile at least."
"Finish is warm, candyish, and warm with alcohol presence. Not as easy drinking as other quads I've had."
"Picked it up on a whim, and I am very glad I did. At 5.99 it's cheap for what it is."
"D - A bit of a challenge to the palate. Feels a bit too heavy for me."
"D - Overall this is a good beer thats true to the style worth trying sometime"
"Not one I would buy everyday, but I am glad I tried this one."
"Pours reddish brown with nearly no head. Aroma full of sugar, cherries, and malt. Syrupy mouthfeel compliments the sweet and fruity taste. Lots of currants and candy sugar in this one. The yeast seems to take a back seat. Gets better as it warms, but still keeps the sweet character."
"Reviewed on 4/19/08. Bottle. Pours brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, not much fruit in the aroma. Flavor was of candy sugar, raisin, molasses, some spices. Sweet but not too sweet. Not a great quad, but a good beer nonetheless. 6/4/7/4/15 (3.6/5)"
"This is good stuff, and as good as any Belgian Quad that I have had. The aroma first hits you with candy sugar then a complex mixture of yeast, bread, dark fruit, and spice. The flavor is exactly like the aroma but with more alcohol than detectable from the aroma. The palate is almost sticky from the sugar. This is highly recommended!"
"Pours a dark burgundy color with a foamy tan head. Spicy and fruity aroma with a nice touch of maltiness. Very quaffable for such a high ABV. Spicy and malty yet sweet with hints of candi sugar, cherries and other dark fruits such as raisin, date, prune etc.."
"Notes from 7/12/04"
"Drinkability: A fine, respectable attempt at the style, but comes up a bit short when stacked against the superior Belgian examples. Still though, it is an enjoyable sipper from the good folks over at Avery."
"Notes: A big beer which delivers on its promise of being that big. It does not hold a candle to three philosophers (I will have to rinse out my snifter quickly to shield it from the memory of this guest quad)."
"Orange pour, hefty white head. Uh oh, very floral aromas, some hops, characteristics of white ales. Overly lively in the mouth and a bit thin. Too much light red fruits, citrus, hop bitterness. To me this was just not a quad. No molasses, malt of any sort, raisin, doughiness. Similar to most Belgian double and tripels that I do not care for."
"Aroma is strong, very malty, with a rich fruity overtone and hints of caramel and toffee. Color is a beautiful clear reddish copper, and head is fairly thick and fine-bubbled. Flavor is sublime - malty, fruity, nutty, strong hop hints, touches of caramel and sweetness, even a teeny bit of smoke. Texture is smooth, and aftertaste includes a hint of brandy and a soupcon of sweetness. Definitely a beer to be revered. ;)"
"Smooth, rich, full-bodied, warming at end of swallow. Light effervescence. Almost a sipping beer, extraordinarily good beer, a must drink."
"I love these guys, Avery kicks ass!"
"Pours a medium brown color, with an aroma of flowers, and some alcohol. Has a smooth taste, with a slightly oily texture, and some carbonation. Slight bitter hoppy taste, nuttiness. Has an odd taste similar to some other Belgian ales I've had."
"Enjoyable beer, right in line with most Belgian traits but it's tough to convince myself that this is a true quadrupel. Medium copper pour huge head and nice lacing. Inviting aroma sugary with that familiar Belgian yeast strain. Sharp and biting on the tongue, the finish is strong with a huge alcohol burn, it's alright. Flavor is also strong and very solid. Big candy sweetness mixed in with a good showing of crisp hops. Some yeasty earthiness backed up with a fruity hint. Overall a decent sipper."
"Not my favorite beer from Avery and certainly not best of this style I have had, not close to what some of those Belgian brewers pump out, still not bad for the money, would probably skip next time though, just too boozy for my palate, bomber could be split between three people easily, worth trying"
"D: Overall, a good American take on the quadrupel. The Reverend is well made and definitely flavorful."
"Not a bad beer, but not the kind I could drink a lot of. While good, a case of too much of a good thing is bad. The high alcohol content would limit my intake, but a nice change of pace."
"I walk away from this one with the memory of seaweed, and even as a result of that, not really the most memorable quad I've had so far. I think I'd pass next time on this one."
"D - Not going to buy again. Definitely can see how some would enjoy, but I've just had better of its nature."
"D: This is a good quad, and I found the flavour to have a lot more structure and concentration than when I had it for the first time back in 2006, definite re-buy."
"Has an dense iced-tea appearance in the glass with a tan head. Not much body, however-- rather thin and even a bit watery at times. While you'll find thing like crackers, fruit and some caramel in the malty base, what is most present is alcohol, bordering on booze. The alcohol is quite overpowering and hides just about any flavor that might be hiding in the bottle. If you like Avery brews, it's worth trying The Reverend, but I'm sure there are better Belgian quads available."
"Still another very good beer from Avery."
"This is another amazing beer to taste as it ages.... While the 2008 vintage is good, the older it gets, the more complexity and balance the beer achieves, with the 2002 ranking 1st out of the 3."
"Pours a relatively clear vibrant reddish copper in color with next to no head. Aroma is pleasant with some fruity esters (apples and pears as well as some darker fruits as the beer warms) and some nice phenols. There is also the occasional whiff of alcohol which gives the drinker an idea of the potent alcohol content of this brew. The flavors, like the aroma are relatively subdued. There is a fair amount of malty sweetness here as well as some of the lighter fruit phenols found in the aroma. In the sweet finish there is also some funk, its not overwhelming but does add a bit of distinctiveness to an otherwise tame beer. Mouthfeel is pretty good, despite the sweetness this beer is fairly well-attenuated with a medium-ish body and moderate carbonation. Alcohol is well masked. Drinkability is about average. This beer really didn't show me too much character and seemed a bit muddled at times."
"Drinking several bottles of this in a session would be easy. The drawback is that with 10% ABV, you won't remember doing it."
"mouthfeel is crisp, loads of flavor, sweet and hot, paired perfectly with applewood smoked cheddar.. ohhhh so good."
"I like this and its definitely a smooth, drinkable beer, but a little too sweet for me to consider drinking more than one. (A bomber is plenty.)"
"Pours a maple syrup caramel with highlights of cherry wood. Great amber resin clarity, almost gives this beer a syrupy look. Very little head or foam after the pour, and even fewer bubbles. Fruity, caramel covere appples and even a few nuts start the flavor profile. Elegantly toasted malts meld with some herbal hops that give a rosey flavor. Pretty warm alcohol gives the caramel and fruits more complexity. The palate is syrupy and warm, but not boozey. Lots of fruits and som banana nut bread qualities. A sippable night cap beer."
"d: Good quad, not too sweet, nice creamy feel. A good American-made belgian brew."
"The mouthfeel is great, smooth and not too heavy, washes through the mouth gracefully."
"Medium bodied with a confusing thickness to it. Sometimes it feels heavy but the next sip will seem watered down. Oddly inconsistent with its mouthfeel, this one seems to be a beer trying to be a Belgian. It makes a valiant effort but falls short of the mark."
"Nice, I like it and will enjoy drinking on a regular basis."
"D--For 10%, it is not a chore. But be careful about cracking a second bottle!!!"
"Its more of a slow sipper - I like their others much better (Maharaja in particular)."
"overall it was okay, average pretty much across the board, don't think that i would get this again when there are much better beers out there."
"D: Really didn't impress me as much as their other beers. Abv was fairly well hidden for its 10.0%abv but was still enough to take notice and hinder this a slow, casual sipper. Probably wouldn't consider this for future consumption."
"Overall - Split a 22 oz bomber with my gf. This is a good twist on a Belgian Style Quad. Very tasty, very potent. Almost reminds me of an English Barleywine. It isn't what I would buy if I wanted a real Belgian Style Quad but I would definitely buy this again just because it was tasty and drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful, ruby red - amber. Decent amount of frothy head that quickly dissipated. There appears to be a decent amount of carbonation mostly coming from the very center of my goblet. The smell is mostly of dark fruit, yeast and spice. Taste is pretty good. Dark fruits coming through providing some sweetness, but not as much as some other Quads. There's some spiciness as well. The alcohol is there and noticeable. It's a bit warming and adds to the spiciness. It's drinkable and enjoyable. Not my favorite Quad, but worth a try. I'd buy it again just to mix things up."
"Pours a very nice copper (at first), turning to a light brown (later), with a little garnet glint, with some very nice head and lacing. Nice deep scent, very broad, very malty, with a huge caramel scent. Deep drink in flavor as well, vaguely sweet from the malt, but a huge amount of caramel, with fig undertones, and a nice malt/hop balanced ending. It goes down nice, with just a bit of alcohol tinge to it."
"D- This one crept up on me and actually made me fall asleep. Probably because of the high but unnoticable ABV. Great stuff, next time I will share the bottle."
"This is a nice example of a Quad. It's not overly sweet, and alcoholic tasting like most other quads. At 10%, I could only really have one of these during a drinking session. It's a fine beer, and I would recommend picking up a bottle."
"D- I enjoyed this, but its very different for the style. the alcohol is well masked, so it would be easy to have another but if youre craving a quad this probably isnt for you."
"Pleasant orange-amber pour - transparent and leathal. Rich lacing holds well from the nice, colorful head.Malty sweet and sour smell. Sweet and mildly floral hints with intense, zesty finish saying ""ah"". Huge body, but mildly filling. Sucked this one down rather easily so I definitely needed an intermission after the first 12 oz.¬† It's a circus on your palate."
"This brew was somewhere between a red and amber color. I was a little disappointed with the head and head retention as there was not much of either. The smell was fantastic though, sweet and yeasty. The taste was good, although almost too sweet for me. I enjoyed the first glass from the bomber, but by the time I started the second I was looking for something a little less cloying. Overall a tasty brew, but could use a little more character to round out the intense sweetness. Definitely a sipping brew!"
"A good and pleasant Belgian style ale that I enjoy. It seems typical and maybe a bit too sweet. Though, I did not have any trouble finishing a bottle. Something I would try again."
"Poured a translucent amber-orange color with no foam to speak of and no lacing. This is probably due to the high alcohol content, but was expecting a little more. Smell is Belgian yeast, pancake syrup, and some big-time earthiness. Taste is sweet as can be. Lots of Belgian candi sugar, large doses of malt, raisins, a bit of apple cider sourness, lots of warming alcohol, and slight hop bitterness in the finish. Sweet as can be, super thick and full bodied, moderate carbonation. Not highly drinkable due to the high ABV but a relatively nice interpretation of a Belgian Quad."
"I pass by this all the time at Green's in Atlanta, and it took the pressing of a server in Oklahoma City for me to try this. Pours a deep copper color (looks like an IPA - weird) with a ivory frothy head that leaves A LOT of lacing on the glass. Smells is incredibly sweet: alcohol, malt, and brown sugar. Taste is not what I was expecting at all. Traces of molasses, caramel, brown sugar, maybe some fruit. Overall, this is a very satisfying beer. Not what I was expecting at all. I will definitely pick this up in Atlanta when I get back."
"Poured into a snifter, it's a nice deep caramel color with red and brown hues and a thick white head that quickly thinned out and hugged the glass and it has some mild lacing; there is some good active carbonation and it's crystal clear. It smells fruity, almost like dried apple and grapes mixed together. It tastes ... mildly sweet with a strong alcohol presence, just a tad bit bitter on the side of your tongue and mildly tart on the tip of your tongue. It has a bitter aftertaste with a strong alcohol flavor that really warms up your mouth. After warming up a bit it picks up a slight liquor taste like a warm whiskey and the overall flavor becomes a little sweeter; the alcohol in its aroma becomes more apparent and the thin head sticks around too. This is a good beer and tastes better at warmer temperatures in my opinion."
"This is a good beer for the money, I suggest it to anyone who wants a decent quad, at half the price of a good Trappist. I would not suggest storing this beer in hopes of making it better. Crack it open right away and enjoy!"
"Carbonated just right. A full-bodied drink cut to pretty good drinkability for such a big, strong beer."
"D - Much better than last year's version. Very similar to Allagash Curieaux."
"Whoa, 10% ABV can really creep up on you in a hurry. Definitely a sipper and bottled to share. The alcohol flavor gets in the way a little, but is not a complete turnoff. The smooth and calm aftertaste makes it easy to keep drinking despite the heavy flavor."
"D- I like this more than several dubbels that I have had and feel it is more drinkable, though I think there could be definite improvements. A great beer and I would easily recommend it to anyone."
"22oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly ruby tinged amber color. There was a very small off white head that disappeared almost immediately. There is some alcohol to the nose. Also notes of spices, caramel, and some fruits. It is very flavorful. There are many. Caramel, a hint of spices, maybe cherries. Nice."
"Not right on for style; in fact, some distance off. Still an above average beer selection."
"D - Although the alcohol is by no means hidden in this one, it is quite drinkable for such a big beer. No one flavor component sticks out as exceptional, but there is something there where everything comes together and makes the overall experience more than the sum of its parts."
"Certainly a beer to be had again."
"I have a bit of mixed feelings about it. Though it could use more balance and move towards the hallmarks of the style more clearly, it had a taste that I liked well enough to continue reaching for my chalice."
"Nice American Quad."
"Looks good, nice amber color, small head. Has a decent yeasty odor and a sugary scent. Taste is nice, not too bold, not too weak. Delicious drinkable brew, would buy again."
"It lacks the spiciness, hops, and berry flavors of some other quadrupels. But it's a sold beer. Good choice."
"Notes: Way too unbalanced. Probably won't be picking this one up again."
"Yikes, this is a big ol' quad that slaps you right in the mouth. All I can think about is ""viya con dios"" from King of the Hill when I drink this one. Pours a mighty Maraschino cherry color with a hansome head. Smells of candied fruit and a bit of banana. The alcohol kicks you with some baked apple and candied sugar flavors. Mild yeast and banana undertones. Enjoyed in my Duvel chalice."
"Pours a clear reddish color, thin head settles fairly quickly. Smells fairly bready, brown sugar sweetness. Taste is candied fruit sweet, alcohol is readily apparent. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, lingers slightly on the finish with a bit of syrup feel. A fairly drinkable Quad. Not my favorite style, but a solid brew nonetheless"
"The pour into my St. Bernardus chalice is beautiful crimson color with shades of orange showing around the edges. There is a minimal off-white head that leaves some loose, spotty, lacing. A somewhat light nose delivers pleasantly sweet and fruity smells, with a touch of spice and alcohol. Full, heavy, and oily smooth in the mouthfeel, with minimal carbonation. The taste is bittersweet of Belgian candy sugar and heavy caramel maltiness, with a modest apple fruitiness rounding out the edges and some alcohol in the finish. It's not bad, but far from great. Not overly complex and a bit rough around the edges."
"The taste was similar to smell. The strong Belgian yeasty was apparent. The taste was malty all the way thru with little sweetness in the end. It left a tingling sensation on the lips and in mouth it is peppery. Overall another solid effort from Sir Avery."
"This poured a slightly hazy, bright bronze with almost no head. It smelled like copper hops mixed with banana and wild yeast. It tasted halfway between a dubble and tripel, rather than a quadruple, with light flavors of sweet apricot and wheat. The taste wasn't exceptionally clean, and had some alcohol warming. It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation and a lasting tart aftertaste. Overall this wasn't bad, but it really wasn't deep or rich enough for me, to be a really good quad."
"Overall this brew was enjoyable, but I wish the funk and pepper was a bit milder so I could get at the fruit flavors better. A milder yeast strain and a little bit heftier malt bill could do this brew a lot of good."
"Quadrupel Ale, sounds enticing. Very minimal head, which almost immediately disappears to a thin, wispy ring. Oddly though the beer bubbles at a higher rate than any beer I've seen. Held at eye level it has a red tint (like fruit punch red.) Very clear appearance. The 10% alcohol is fairly obvious, in the beginning sips. There is a nice slightly spicy bitterness from the Styrian Goldings hops, and the aroma is exceptional to say the least. The sweetness of the candy sugar is evident, especially as the brew warms, very evident in the aftertaste. The concept of the brew is very attractive to me, but I'm not totally sure if they pulled it off. Kind of a thought provoking brew, I have mixed feelings about the numbers I gave."
"Tasted on 3/16/08."
"D: Technically, it's quite drinkable especially considering the ABV. But, honestly I would turn to another quadruple instead of going back for more."
"This quadrupal poured a orangish copper color, with a white lace of head that dissipated fairly quickly. Smell was average but not as aromatic as I would of thought it may be. Seemed to be some fruity smells with alcohol lingering in the backround. Taste was there, and pretty good, but I was still left waiting for more at the end. The alcohol was there but not overpowering. Mouthfeel was nice with the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability was also good, I'd recommend this beer, drink up."
"Dark red/brown color. I used a goblet type glass to bring out the aroma of spices, alcohol, and fruit, but it was not as aromatic as similar beers. The flavor was not as complex as I had hoped. Sweet dry flavor of fruit and alcohol. Overall, I expected more complexity and flavor from a quadrupel. It is worth trying though."
"In my limited experience, American quadrupels are either hit (Victory V-12, Allagash Four) or miss (Sly Fox Ichor, Founders Bad Habit). The Reverend is closer to being a miss than a hit. If you're looking for an Avery brew that is similar, but better in all respects, look no further than Hog Heaven Barley Wine."
"I'd try this on tap again, but probably wouldnt spring for another bottle, it's just too rich."
"D: Great beer for the price. One bomber is more than enough for a sitting."
"D: A sipper due to the high alcohol content, but that's ok. There's plenty to enjoy, but the problem (as you may have picked up already) is that it's so damn sweet."
"Boy, I'm getting wordy in my advancing age."
"This is a well made quadrupel from Avery and one worth trying."
"D- the rev packs one hell of a punch! after this bottle, i feel woozy. at 10% it ain't no candy. not a session beer though...that would make for a pretty short night."
"Pours a light gold in color with some ruby highlights. No head appears on the pour. Smell is belgian candy sugar and some delicious dark fruits in plenty. Taste is the same in sugar and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is full and creamy and easy drinking. Not a world class quad, but $4.99 a bomber makes it an occasional purchase."
"Avery is fairly new to MO, and I'm looking forward to trying more."
"A decent U.S. stab at a Quad, but a bit too fruity. Far too boozy for a session beer, I used it as a way to unwind after getting home from work past midnight on a cold winter's night. I would drink this again, but only if I can't get a St. Bernardus 12."
"The Reverend was one of the first big beers that I have ever enjoyed. I first drank it about 5 or 6 years ago, when it still had the wax cap covering. I just drank it last night, which was my first time in a long time. It has a beautiful orange color and a nice, sweet malty aroma. What I like the best about the Reverend is that it is very strong and complex, yet it is so enjoyable to drink. There is no harshness at all. I taste dates in the malt, but not overbearing. The hop profile is low, as it should be. This is a sneaky beer, in that you don't realize that you are drinking a 10% quadruple ale!"
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: Misconceptions by Mealticket."
"This comes across as just a little bit boozy in a style of beer that is competitive and complex. As a bang for the buck quad this isn't too shabby; I paid 5.99 for my bomber at the Whole Foods at Union Square... but I could do without this particular brew."
"pours a beautiful light copper color with some mild red hues. the smell is good as well, sweet malt aroma with lots of fruit and even some strong alcohol. taste is complex and full, first impression is sort of wine like, very fruity with a strong alcohol body. another really good Belgian style ale. recommended"
"Drinkability - is okay. I wasn't sure about this one at first. Took about half way through the bomber to become more enjoyable for me. Worth a try!"
"Another big, solid brew from Avery... Copped a 22oz bomber from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Pours a lucid, clear, ruby-red, mahogany hue with a frothy head that soon dissipated within about a minute... slight carbonation visible... smell was outstanding, full, fresh, and replete with fresh fruits, pears, and grapefruit... flavor matched the aroma with a strong floral, caramel, brown-sugar flavored that was sweet and flavorful without being overwhelming or cloying... One of the better Quadrupels that I've sampled... full-flavored, malty, butter taste... very rich and thick with a dominant candy taste... an enjoyable brew... slight alcohol presence, but not as noticeable as you would think for a 10% ABV... a solid offering from Avery... recommended..."
"Easy to drink despite not tasting outstanding. Overall this is a good Quad, maybe I'll try to cellar it, but I probably won't seek it out anytime soon."
"Funny story: One of my buddies at work was given two or three of Avery's big beer series bombers as a present from a friend....not knowing what they were he proceeded to down all three in the span of a couple hours! I'm sure he was three sheets to the wind after that experience! (he's now a BA 'orangemoustache' but like all of us he used to just down pisswater brewskies like any red-blooded American)."
"D. Easy to drink even though it is high in alcohol. I will surely buy another."
"the refreshing mouthfeel and light flavor made for a surprisingly drinkable strong ale. unfortunately, there was nothing really interesting about this beer. i agree with another reviewer that after a while i felt like i was just drinking whisky. albeit a watered down whisky. bottom line: this strong ale doesn't taste bad. a 22 oz bottle of this is very drinkable and will give you more than a good buzz. unfortunately, i expected something deeper and more intellectual."
"thanks to barefootbrewer for sharing this beer wiht me."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of dark honey, with a frothy off white colored head - nose of bright sour cherries, and some malts ¬ñ taste of ginger, cloves, dark fruit mango, and anis- body is medium, and with medium carbonation ¬ñ aftertaste of Dark cherries, yeast, gummy, and lingering"
"Pours clear amber and I got virtually no head off it. Very little lacing. Nose is super sweet and alcohol is heavily present. Taste is extremely thick on the mouth and you get a firm syrup flavor, which for me is a bad start. There are tones of alcohol and fruits, but overall it feels too syrupy on the mouth. Over time this is a characteristic I still can¬ít come to appreciate. This is a sipper, but not one I would run to the store to grab again. For a quad, I¬íd turn to the Rochefort 10 or most other quads over this one any day."
"Overall; amazing - yes amazing. It is working its way to the top of my list."
"Pours medium amber, with a golden shine. What little head there is fades almost immediately. Aroma is strong alcohol, perhaps some fusels, and lots of fruity esters, with a little malt. Flavor is also alcohol up front, followed immediately by sweet malt and some hints of hops. Alcohol dries out the finish quite a bit, but not offensively so. A strong beer that tastes even more so, yet in a good way. A little harsh, which I don't remember before. Wonder if it has changed. Perhaps they are fermenting it warmer to speed production?"
"With a little trepidation I pour a 8oz sample of The Reverend from it's 22oz bottle into a small tulip glass. It's orange in color, or a light amber. Aroma is rich and deep - hop spice, rich malt, caramel, orange zest, and alcohol. Flavor is very typical to the style. Quite sweet, feel and taste of alcohol, a good amount of spicy hops that balances well without being too bitter. A richness of malt and caramel upfront that fades towards the middle and thins out with a dry finish - exactly how a Belgian should be. Nice and bubbly mouthfeel. If you measure drinkability by how many you could drink in one sitting, I'd say this guy is low because of the sweetness and alcohol. If you measure drinkability by whether or not you want to spit out the third sip, then it rates well because the flavor and complexity is excellent."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer that is quite different from others in its style."
"D-This is a very good American Quad. Fairly drinkable for the % and very flavourful. Avery is the type of brewery I wish I had around me."
"D: This is one that I would have to think about before ordering again. Understand, that this is a superior, well balanced drink. However, perhaps for someone that has a more experienced and sophisticated palate that I have at this point."
"Honestly, I really need to give this one another go and maybe revise my review later."
"Drinkability - a sweeter quad, I'd probably enjoy it more at around 8%."
"Comment: I expected a more Trappist quad-like appearance and taste. It's difficult to compare this brew with the Trappists quadrupels, rather it is more in the class of the Bush quad which has a higher ABV but similar appearance a flavor. Both this and Bush are wonderful quads just not directly comparable to the special joy found in Rocheforts, Pannapots and their ilk."
"D: High alcohol so one is enough, but I did have two to test out the theory."
"One of the finest from Avery Brewing Company, The Reverend, a kind and forgiving chap, is a terrific Belgian Quadrupel, full of spice and vim. At 10% ABV, look out, it packs a wallop that you can certainly feel in the second half of the bottle. The Reverend pours a rich head atop a brownish-red body, well presented. The smell and taste exude spice all the way, yet with a sweet taste that enmeshes very well with the spices. Hints of cherry and molasses, with a slightly roasted flavor, are present. Impressive all the way, and one of the best domestic Belgian-style brews in the US. Not to be passed up, and very high on my list."
"D: The quad is a whopper, so one bomber is the perfect size for a late fall night."
"Overall it's not bad. For sure not in the top % of Quad's but well done, diff. The 10% is somewhat hidden in here, this one goes down way to quick."
"Overall, a solid quad that aged well."
"Pours a dark bronze color with a creamy white head, with a little lacing. Smell is of candied sugar, some grape/wine aroma, dried fruit, and some slight yeasty. Taste is honey, some spice, and sweet malt. Mouthfeeling is thick and smooth. Very nice quad and very smooth."
"Pours a coppery orange with a little whitish head. Little lacing. Slight chill haze. Sweet aromas of malts and a little caramel. Some fruitiness and a little alcohol detected. Taste is similar, but a little tart. Mouthfeel is a little lacking. I would expect it to be a little thicker on the palate for a quad, butdtill an alright beer. For $5 I might be drinking some more of this in the future. Its sure no St. Bernardus Abt 12, but still a decent brew."
"It's worth noting that I recommend this beer as it warms up. Drink it while it is to cold and you will miss out on a lot of the complexity of the beer"
"The alcohol definitely makes its presence known with an almost medicine-y finish. Overall it was a very interesting experience. In a good way. I look forward to more beers of this type."
"Not a bad quad, but not one of the best I've had. With the ABV I wouldn't have more than one at a time, but it is a beer that I would revisit in the future."
"Very enjoyable. While not boasting what I'd call a true 'Belgian' profile, it is a very good beer."
"Amber in color. Toffee, caramel and light fruit aroma. Tan lacey head. Sweet and smooth. Sugar filled with not much of a hint of alcohol. Very good for an American twist on this classic style of beer that the Belgian people have perfected. Avery rarely disappoints and this is another example of why they are a great brewery."
"D--Like Quads in general, you have to watch it or you will find yourself talking to goblins and stubling around. That is what happened to me during my first encounter with this beer. If you enjoy Quads and wish more American Micros made the type, this is worth a sample..."
"""Created by God. Feared by Satan. Loved by all."" Indeed."
"This is my second time ""trying out"" this beer. The evil looking Reverend on the bottle should suggest something about the beer. He looks like he's gonna kick your ass, and he certainly does! At 10% he'll lay waste to you, and you'll enjoy his ass kicking! Maybe it's not THE best Belgian, but, it's pretty damn good, and usually not that expensive either. A bomber ran me like $6 or $7 in Atlanta. Bang for the buck and great taste, mouthfeel... well worth it!"
"I ran out of my bomber fast and wanted more. That says something doesn't it?"
"I really enjoyed this beer and I recommend it to everyone"
"22 oz bomber poured into a Duvel tulip. Cream head doesnt hold long. Smells of Belgian candy sugar and Belgian Yeast phenols, candy, maple notes. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly syrupy. Taste is slightly hot and phenolic (which i personally dont mind at all) that sometimes comes with a high abv beer. This is really a solid example of an American style quad. The flavors are very pleasingly sweet and smooth but not deeply complex The hop schedule is more apparent than an authentic Belgian quad. In fact, this offering is more like a 3.5 in between a tripel and a quadrupel with its golden orange color. A very solid example of an American style Belgian Quad and a highly enjoyable beer. As far as drinkabilty goes, I personally could put down a couple of these bombers and feel all nice and warm. Good job Avery!"
"This beer had some great aspects. The slight medicinal taste hurt the drinkability, but this beer had many other redeeming qualities and the bomber went down easy."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and not excessive."
"It poured a rich amber color, with a light golden head. After the Maharaji I wondered if there was going to be a big surprise in an unexpected flavor coming through, but it was much more subtle. I detected a slight smell of banana, but not very strong. I also got this feeling in the taste, plus a richness of berries, even without a true berry taste. It had a very rich taste that I found very drinkable, somewhat like cognac. This was a keeper."
"Split a 22 oz. bomber with some good friends. Poured into a tall, rounded white wine glass. A wonderful copper-red with a bubbly white head that leaves a heavy ring of lace around the glass. Smells and flavors of sweet syrup, candy, burnt sugar, yeast, bananas, and some liqueur like brandy. Tart, even fermented apples. Hides the alcohol well. Very strong and sweet character - a bit overpowering, but still really good to drink. Small, sharp fizz on the middle of the tongue. A very pleasant Quad. Fine example of the style. Watch out for the 10% ABV, but otherwise enjoy!"
"22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass. Very pretty beer: gold, thick white head, nice lacing, well-carbonated. The aroma of a lollypop. Big taste. Fruit, candy, malt, alcohol, yeast. A well-constructed beer, fun to drink. The 10% ABV makes it a beer to savor."
"The appearance is decent, but the flavors just aren't balanced quite well enough. It's fairly smooth and drinkable, albeit spicy, but it does go decently well with a good food pairing like swiss to help round out the experience. Not a bad brew, but I've tasted a couple better from this style."
"This beer looks beautiful poured into a belgian glass. Dark amber color, beautiful bubbly carbonation, lacy two finger head, has curves and some junk in the trunk. Has a sweet, fruity, alcohol smell that makes you think if jolly rancher made alcohol, this would be it. Very big taste, overwhelming at first, sweet, malt, sugar, alcohol, all tastes lingering at the end. You have to be in the mood for this beer, if you are, enjoy it as it is a big sweet beer with alcohol to put you out. Enjoy over time."
"I am a big fan of quadrupels and like my beer a little on sweet side as well. This one fit the bill on both accounts. Nice carmel color. Mediocre head. The taste is sweet and although it sports a hefty ABV, the alcohol was not particularly noticable. I liked this beer alot. As good an American quadrupel as I've had, and better than many of the Belgian ones. I would and will be purchasing The Reverend again."
"Mouth: Taste is fruity but too sweet. The sugars cover up the a lot of the potential depth of the flavor. It's all esters and alcohol, a hint of cinnamon, with a warm, cloying finish. Too sweet to enjoy, malty and yeasty and mouthfeel is oily & slick."
"M/D-Medium bodied, strong and sweet...I find it easy to drink at 10% b/c of the sweetness. This one I pick up when in the mood for a quad"
"I suppose I have to really be in the mood for quadrupels as they are not very sessionable thanks to the high ABV (well, I could session these, but that wouldn't go over too well with my wife). Anyway, this is not to say that it isn't a good brew--it is--but at $6 for a pint bottle, I think I'd rather pay the extra buck for a genuine Trappist ale such as Chimay."
"This is one dangerously drinkable quad, look out! It taste fantastic, is highly digestible, is readily available, and fairly cheap. My new cigar beer."
"D- This was a great treat but one was quite enough for the night. The alcohol is strong and noticable in this brew. I wanted to switch to an easy session ale after having it. Something I enjoyed and I will have again. Another great offering from Avery"
"This brew pours a cloudy reddish-brown color. It is quite lighter in color than other quadrupels I have had. The head is small, but recedes slowly and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and passion fruit. There is a faint hint of spices, but it is hidden behind the caramel and fruit. The taste is of caramel, and spices with fruit in the background. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but not a decent quad. It is far to lacking in spices to really make me think. However, it is still rather tasty, and I would drink it again, just not when I am in the mood for a quad."
"d- this is a nice, big quadrupel from Avery, very solid in all categories but not quite reaching the utmost tier"
"Not the appearance that I was expecting from a quad a clear amber tone big frothy fine bubbled creamy off white head lacing is strung lightly but with regular patterns. Aromatics bring out deep ripened fruit notes brown sugar carmelized with raisins, tart apples and spicy yeast strain with alcohol flowing openly with no apologies. Flavor spicy Belgian yeast strain sweet trademark candi sugar additions thick flow of raisins and tart apples with molasses sturdy slighty burnt malt sweetness herbal hop finish peeks through but not the key player in this show. Mouthfeel has a bit of a syrupy residual sugar content going on medium bodied and sticky flows with tightly bubbled carbonation. Drinkability is mediocre a style and version of it that drains the beer senses and gets you happy or sad depending on what type of drunk you are."
"D- For the ABV, this is about right. Nothing spectacular, but the alcohol is not apparent. A unique quad worth trying."
"I like it, but I like other quads better. Still, not a poorly made brew but any stretch of the imagination."
"D- I'm not even sure if I would call this beer a quadrupel. It doesn't seem to fit the style. It was a good beer, but I probably wouldn't try it again, or at least go to great lengths to seek this out."
"I would take an Allagash 4 in a heartbeat over this when it come to U.S. quadrupels."
"I'm a fan of Avery, especially the Maharaja which is one of my all time favorites."
"D- The smooth flavor with the alcohol heat is nice but there is not much complexity or interest. The yeast doesn't add much flavor to this beer but it would really help."
"Overall, an unbelievable beer. Never-ending complexity makes each sip unique and enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"D: You know, I used to like this beer a lot more than I¬ím liking it now. It¬ís a tasty brew but lacks an overall complexity and depth that one expects from a top notch Belgian style. This beer is so sweet it tastes like something a hummingbird should drink."
"I enjoyed this bottle immensley and will have to revisit St. Berny for a refernce point because this was downright delicious."
"warming effect. A nice big beer."
"Drinkability: Very rich, high in alcohol. A pleasant beer to sip."
"Rich and complex; fruity and yeasty; creamy-smooth and thick. Pretty nice."
"poors a copper color with no hazyness to speak of. A small head goesa away pretty quickly. Banana and spices for the most part in the smell, with a hint of acohol. Rasin and spices, with some maltyness, and a bigger hit of acohol come with the taste. It cirtainly has a clean finish. Not the most drinkable, even considering the style, would be a good bomber to split with someone"
"Drinkability: Yummy. This brew hides its ABV quite well."
"Perhaps this is too extreme for me to enjoy. While I like this beer, there is no way I could have more than one at a time."
"make it hot and sweet and call it a quad. hmmm..."
"Taste is nice, but it's not exciting. After a half-pint I wanted something lively. IMO this is better out of the bottle. Just has more perk to it."
"This beer poured a hazy brown color with a thick head and smooth lacing. The aroma is hoppy and malty with a hint of sour. The taste is very malty with a touch of spice. The alcohol is noticeable, but suited to the beer. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation gives it a nice pep. This is a very enjoyable brew which I¬íd consider highly drinkable."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter glass. The beer pours a deep gold, forming no head, and light rings of lace. The aroma is delicous dark fruit! Not much else, but oh so inviting. The taste is just like you would expect from a Belgian. Sweet dark fruit flavor. The hops and malts are hard to seperate when it comes to Belgians. Probably because I havent had much experience in tasting these brews, but what I've experienced from this one is wonderful. Very smooth mouthfeel. I could drink this all night if it werent for the high abv. Overall, a great find. I will definitely add this to the regular rotation."
"D-Like many other Avery ""big beers"" this is devilishly easy to put down without a hitch. The flavors shine and the booziness fades as the beer warms to sub-room temp."
"Bottom line: This is my first bottle of The Reverend and I'd daresay, it will be my last. The flavours were just too chaotic for my palate."
"Pours a crystal-clear bronze hue, with a dense and soapy three finger head just off-white in color. Good retention with spotty lacing. Toasty malt, light phenols, orange peel, and alcohol are prodominant aromas; some faint Styrian hops and Crystal malt make up the rest. The first sip is full of dextrinous and bready toasted malt, surrounded by a fruity phenolic taste in a classic abbey-style sort of way. Candy-sugar comes out next, and with it a boisterous, boozey kick. The aftertaste is drying with little but some herbal and mild hop flavor and aroma. The alcohol also helps balance out the abundant sweetess with help from a tart phenolic presence. Mouthfeel is medium-full with a medium carbonation that seems passable but lacking given the style and amount of lingering flavors. Indeed, the finish is quite residual and sweet, and only saved by the dryness from the booze. While this was a nice stab at the style and I really like the yeast profile and overall complexity- the preception of alcohol is out of control and far to hot the attain a respectable drinkability. The burn is slow and clean like top-shelp vodka, but ultimately too prominent even for a Quad and quickly becomes distracting. Perhaps a few years in the cellar would be beneficial, but it appears filtered and so would likely only fade away some of the more interesting yeast, malt and hop nuances."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty thick and syrupy. Definitely a sipping beer. That coupled with the 10% abv renders drinkability pretty low. Overall, it's not bad. Worth a try. It won't be a regular for me, but I wouldn't be opposed to another down the road."
"It's a nice beer, but it's a bit over-the-top alcohol-wise. The taste is generally nice, but it gets old pretty fast, and it's a bit too sweet. Definitely worth trying if you like stronger or Belgian-style beers, but it's not the type of beer to have with any frequency. I'll probably have this again, but not on my own."
"Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"For me, this beer was all about the taste and the drinkability. I knew the alcohol was there, but it never got in the way. I knew the candi syrup was there, but it didn't overstay it's welcome. A peaceful beer that may lack complexity for some, but will offer a safe haven to others. Kind of like church."
"The Reverend pours a copper color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is good, mostly I pick out candy sugar. The flavor is also good, dark fruits and candy sugar. It's not as complex as some Belgian quads, but it's quite enjoyable nonetheless. It goes down easy, and packs quite a punch on the back end, I'm feeling a good buzz after sharing a bottle. Recommended."
"Poured a light amber, somewhat murky with a faint red tint. Bubbly pour, not as effervescent as other quads. Aromas were toned down as well- only a faint whiff of strong belgian yeastiness, caramel sugars are big though. Taste was that of thick bready malts, and some orchard flavors, fresh, not dried as in some quads. Alcohol is present as well as a slight bitterness, not sure its from any hop influence though. All in all a little watered down, with some astringent flavors and younger sugars which dont work so well with the rest of the brew; decent offering, but not among the best."
"The Reverend pours a very clound golden amber with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma is sweet raisiny malt, fruity esters that are almost citrusy and a big alcohol twinge. Flavor is more fruity esters, very sweet and malty with just a hint of roasted taste. There is a lot of nice yeasty complexity and a big alcohol burn, just a little too much, knocking down the drinkability slightly."
"Drinkability: A solid quad and I believe it's my favorite Avery brew Ive had yet. You can tell the alcohol is present but it's not overpowering."
"Spicy aroma with some malt sweetness. Medium to full body. Plenty of spicy flavors, lots of clove. Residual malt sweetness. Very warming. This is a fine Americanized version of a Belgian style. Surprisingly drinkable, maybe dangerously drinkable for the alcohol level."
"A good try from Avery. The flavors are really interesting, but everything about this beer is up front and in your face. This one leaves me wanting a bit more - well, other than another pour."
"Altogether, recommended."
"D - Not bad. Certainly worth a try. I would say this is toward the better end of the Avery big beers. Nothing I'm in a huge rush to have again, but I might do it sometime."
"D - Lots of flavor and easy to drink which is scary with the 10% alc. I enjoyed it quite a bit and would gladly have another sometime"
"On tap at Essex Ale House. This is my first Avery sample and I must say I was pretty pleased. Poured into a small snifter glass, the golden orange colored quad produced a nice fluffy white head that hung out for quite some time before breaking down into some nice glass coating lace. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and sweet. Resembles apricots and pears a bit. Flavor is a huge, juicy gulp of red grapefruit juice. Nice clean and balanced hop flavor balances out the sweetness. While this flavor is delicious, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't find much else in there. I was hoping for some depth and complexity for a quad. Body is full and smooth with a nice scrubbing carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. It is quite delicious but I was just hoping for a little more."
"Poured into my tulip with a very rich apple juice color. The creamy long lasting head, off white in color, really added to this beer's appearance. Smelled of yeast, with faint tart cherries in the distance. The taste was of cherries, yeast and a very subtle hops presence...slightly bready throughout the whole process though. This beer had a nice firm, heavy mouth feel, but did not seem to have quit the same velvety flow as some of it's Belgian cousins. Considering the fact that this was a 10 percent treat, it was very ""sessionable"". Paired great with semi-soft brie, port salut, and green apple wedges...Enjoy"
"Pours a crystal clear copper-orange color under a fluffy and thick off-white head. Quite odd the see a Belgian Quad style beer so translucent without the typical haziness. Head dissapates quickly to some spotty blotches of foam. No lacing noted. Aroma is of rich, luscious ripe brandy soaked black cherries, figs, dates and raisins against a background of caramel, malt and spices. Mouthfeel is nicely balanced between the heavy, chewy, thick body and the overtly spritzy carbonation which keeps the texture from becoming too oily or slick. The flavor profile of this beer improved immensely as it warmed from its initial serving temp of 50*F. Taste was very sweet and rich with notes of Belgain candy and dark brown sugar along with caramel candy apples, raisins, dates, some faint banana and cloves and warming alcohol. Finishes with just a hint of hop bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Goes down real easy for a 10%¬íer. Found these at a local upscale grocery market for $3.69/bomber so I picked up 10 of them. Makes it even that more enjoyable to get such a nice price on ¬íem."
"Overall impression: Seems light and easy on the palate but I know this is a big beer. Dangerously drinkable and full of flavor. One of Avery's best and certainly the most balanced. An enjoyable American slant on a Belgian style. Color is a bit too light for a Belgian Dark Strong but overall an immensely enjoyable beer."
"This one is a golden bronze with a thin, head that can't make up its mind if its going to be rocky or creamy. The small bubbles are microscopic, I just love that for no reason I can really identify. The smell is hops up front but the candi sugar comes on hard with a caramel smell that reminds me for all the world of Unibroue's Trois Pistoles. That's a very good thing in my book, btw. The taste has a grass-like note, which takes me by surprise, and is not nearly as sweet as the smell. This is good as it lends balance. The caramel malt is there but the sugar is really subdued. Odd, really. The carbonation level is nice and after that its all silk, not so substantial as to be chewy but definitely a smooth feel. The drinkability is good but limited by that grassy flavor. I think its the hops that are beating me over the head on this one, which is strange to say the least for a quadrupel. I think this is a quad for hop heads. Good. Definitely good but doesn't stand up to the quads I've had from Belgium, for the most part."
"On draft at KClingers: Bright red with only a thin veil to top it off. The aroma is somewhat raisin-like. Onto the drink ... this is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. Sweet syrupy but not too much, very well balanced. Why do I think there¬ís a monster lurking just below the surface of this innocent-feeling brew? (#2715, 2/18/2007)"
"I am interested in how this beer and St Bernardus abt12 are the same style as the colors are completely different, as is the sweetness."
"I bought this 22 oz bottle at Evanston First Liquors in Evanston, IL."
"22oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a 1 finger head and very good lace. Lots of caramel malts up frony mixed with brown sugar and sherry aromas. Again lots and lots of caramel malts mixed with brown sugar, sherry, dried fruits and a decent hop flavor and a bit of bitterness. Alcohol is hidden fairly well. Even at 10% it is smooth and easy drinking. Not the best Quad out there but still very nice and well worth the $6.99."
"I have this beer on tap at my work. I drink about 8 oz. every day I work. (along with a few others) This is my favorite one on tap, withj its sweet full flavor. The coloring is a darker brown not much lace on the way down. I love belgians and it seems the darker ones are more for my taste buds. It has a fair smell as opposed to another Avery belgian we have on tap."
"pours an auburn brown with a little head. definitly has a good aroma. the smell is upfront with a caramel sweetness. i can definitly taste hints of orange cream, butter and maybe ginger. almost tastes slightly like a ""winter version"" of the style i guess. definitly a good beer, and fairly true to the style. it just lacked complexity. very starightforward this is what you get kind of beer. probably not something i'd sample again."
"Nice amber-copper body, but with a thin head. Smell is sweet, a bit yeasty, with some alcohol in the background. Not all that complex, but good. Taste is a bit fruity up front, then malty sweet, then a decent Belgian aftertaste, but too sweet at the end. Mouthfeel is medium, but dead. I don't like huge carbonation in a Belgian, but this seems a bit unlively. Drinkability is again good, but far from fantastic."
"A delicious beer that I've been drinking regularly since at least 2002, and will continue drinking as often as I can get my hands on it."
"Not exactly a chip off the Trappist block, this beer is still pretty good. It's an interesting take on the quadrupel style and a bit similar to Avery's other big beers. The beer looks good even though the amber-orange is fairly light in color for the style. The smell is nice enough, with sweet fruits, but isn't terribly complex. The flavor does open up a bit with raisins, figs, and dates mixed with marmalade, and mellow citrus flavors aided by hops. I guess it's a relatively hoppy quad, but that's not a bad thing. The flavor isn't on the same level as some of the brews from Belgium, but it's oh so drinkable and smooth."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a giant tan foamy head. The head leaves good lacing and lasts a long time. The smell is strong with clove,banana,candy sugar, and fruit, pear ? This is one of the better smelling beers I've had in awhile. The taste is very sweet with candy sugar, pear,alcohol, and the typical Belgian spices. A nice tasting beer,but be warned,this is very sweet. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. A very nice surprise. I have to admit that this is better than I thought it would be. This is a Must try."
"D: Very good Belgian, would have this again for sure"
"Okay drinkability. Plenty of others better in this style."
"A complex enough beer that you can ride this one out for a good hour, taking in its many nuances. Good stuff, and despite the 10% ABV it drinks like a slightly more session-friendly ale, so beware, but most of all, enjoy."
"Pours a ruddy, orangey caramel color, with a medium-thickness head that fades to a collar. The nose is mainly phenolic, with a bit of cinnamon and caramel malts in the background. The taste is less phenolic, with allspice and some sharp date fruits, but that band-aid-ish note is still there in spades. Very little sweetness for the style. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, with carbonation that is sharp but not big. Very drinkable for the style, with no alcohol burn present (and for a 10% ABV brew, that's impressive), but that drinkability is not matched by depth of flavor. For an American Belgian brew, it's got some interesting notes (especially the phenols), but it just doesn't have the same oomph and the same depth you'd expect to find in a Belgian quadrupel."
"22 oz bomber poured into a large brandy glass, as my Chimay chalice is dirty. Nice looking ruddy red/brown beer,clear with attractive carbonation. Gorgeous large thick light tan head. Nice aroma of dark fruits,malts, some spice, cherries and demerara sugar. Quite sweet ,but with bitter undertones,,papya fruit,kiwis come to mind, alcoholi in the finish, but mostly rich malt.Spiciness is there but slight. Ok on the pallate, not great though. Overall a goodish beer but not one that I can class as great."
"The taste is somewhat bland, slight hints of caramel and fruit, with a strong alcoholic aftertaste that is not well masked. The Reverend is quite dry and has low to moderate carbonation. I would try this beer once, but look for other quadrupels before purchasing."
"Poured a nice orange copper color; a little lighter than expected, but the lack of head retention and only a small, non-lasting head is what brings this one down. Smell is of caramel and dark fruit, some cherries as well. Taste is real nice, starts out with a burnt caramel flavor, toffee, and some dark fruits. I think this may even meld better with age. Mouthfeel is chewy, definitely full bodied with carbonation on the lower side, but still present. Pretty solid, and if I remember correctly, the best United States brewed quad that I've had. Certainly worth a try, I think I'll be picking up a couple to age next time."
"Served in a large chalice glass. Pours a beautiful copper color with an large, solid head, about an inch tall, creamy and frothy and long-lasting. Quite malty nose, with grassy, citrusy hops and subtle fruitiness. Very malty (but not heavy) taste, ripe fruity character, well-placed bitterness that balances well. Finish is noticibly alcoholic, detracting slightly. Nice body, not too heavy, but plenty full."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"I'll leave you with something that a macro-drinking friend of mine said after first tasting the Reverend. True then, and still true now. ""The Reverend? ... <takes sip>.... WHOA!!! It tastes like a sin!"""
"D-Its a good belgian,very sweet though.I dont know if I will have more.I would drink this once in a while."
"Pours brown with a thin white head. Smell is mostly malty and fruit, cherries maybe, with noticable alcohal. Taste is fruit upfront with some malt characters, followed with a huge alcohol flavor. The aftertaste consists mostly of a doughy taste probably from the yeast from the quad style. The mouthfeel has good balance in flavor but seemed flat, and had a very strong dose of alcohol. It didn't seem like they tried to mask the ABV any, which I don't know if they were trying to do in the first place. These aren't the easiest to drink, have to have a taste for quads, but this is a decent one. I enjoyed this beer."
"D - A very good beer. Heavy and high in ABV but certainly worth drinking."
"Not bad, but there is room for improvement. Belgian inspired, but it stops there. Still, overall not bad, and I think you should try it for yourself if you're running out of Quads to try."
"Pours rather flat, an isolated patch of bubbles - off center - is all that sits overtop the beer. Auburn colour with fiery highlighting. Belgian character yeast - both the darker (slightly toasty) malt notes like in a dubbel as well as the sweet, high pitched spices found in a tripel. On the whole pretty highly seasoned and peppery. Offers enough to keep you sniffing. Flavour has some layering. Starts a little in high orbit - a nimble note of booze perks up. It's nicely chased away by candy sugar sweetness and amble enough malt base. I taste some lighter, crystal and pale malts that blend well behind the spices. Not sure if I can detect even any hints of cherries or currants as the bottle claims I should, but it is seeming to reveal more as it warms. For the most part though, this is far from cloying, and I'd say could use a little more texture. A nice malt touch in the finish that last. Pretty well tempered. Enough flavour to keep it from being drab, and enough composure to keep it together. All in all, very decent American rendition of the style. Thanks for the trade Harry!"
"Good-sized, light tan head. Nice retention and lots of tiny bubbles that provided a nice amount of carbonation. Fruity, estery, almost pineapple-like aroma. Sweet, malty, alcohol flavor with a warming mouthfeel. Medium bodied and pretty smooth. Strength was a little too noticeable for my tastes, but still pretty drinkable."
"If you like thick, sweet, high alcohol beer and I know those folks are out there, then this beer would probably rock your world. Everybody else, I would call this an ""in the mood for..."" beer."
"Medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a decent level of carbonation. Smooth and warming, but at the expense of taste. The alcohol taste in here is just too much. Very poor example of a quad and not even a good beer."
"This is not a trappist brew for sure, but it gets the job done."
"Brother in law turned me on to this ale, among other HAC beers. I have to say that ever since he has left, I've had a stock of this in my fridge. This ale really leaves you wanting more. If it weren't for the high alcohol content, I could easily have 4-5 a night. However, this is more of a sipping beer and usually one leaves you just right. I've recommended this to many friends who have since placed this high on their list."
"Its alright not big fan of the big fruity flavor. It is a sipper and could get through a bottle in a night but would prefer something else."
"Pours an orangish/caramel color with little to no head. Smell is malty and slighty yeasty. Taste is of brown sugar, malt and a little yeast. The brown sugar flavor comes through but is not overwhelming or cloying. Really a very tasty beer. Not as deep as other beers but very satisfying. Mouthfeel is very good. Carbonation is just right and has a real smooth finish. Drinkability is almost frightening for a 10% alcohol beer. Could definitely drink this rather quickly. I am really impressed with this beer. Avery puts out good beer but I wasnt expecting it to be this good. I would definitely recommend it."
"This is a rich, golden-amber colored liquid, poured from a 22 ounce bottle. I had this one after a dinner of a nice steak, mushrooms, and asparagus. The beer is topped with an off-white head that¬ís a little short for the style. Decent, but unexceptional, lace. The aroma is of alcohol and pale malts. Lots of malt character in the smell¬Öcan¬ít overstate that. There¬ís also a little fruit, slight yeast aroma, and a hint of herbal hops. The taste is extremely sweet¬Öno doubt a desert beer was in the mind of the brewer. It¬ís syrupy on your lips an tongue. There¬ís a nice alcohol warming, along with some mild spice. Hops provide some well-needed balance, and are more bitter than I expected for the style. A bit of resin and a touch of citrus in the finish. It¬ís a well-made and very enjoyable after-dinner beer. I¬íd have this one again."
"Drinkability: All in all, very good. This is my first quad, and I don't reckon it'll be my last. I'm going to go to this brewery on my vacation next month. Looking forward to trying this on tap!"
"Deep ambery rudy brown with deep red high lights. Nice head that dissipated a little too fast, but left nice lacing. The head lingers around they edge at minimum thickness. Smells of spice upfront, malt, yeast, some fruit esters and a tinge of earthy funk. Taste is toffee up front, with some banana, a bit of hops and Belgian yeast. Decent mouth full and after taste. Although there is something about this beer that I've had in other beers specifically unibroue that I don't mind, but I'm not crazy about. Maybe I'm spoiled my first quad was St. Bernardus 12, which fucking ruled. Still this is an enjoyable beer and from what I understand a decent quad."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for such a heavily alcoholic beer (10%). A very nice Belgian from an American brewery. The alcohol and fruit flavors can get to you before this becomes a session brew, but otherwise it goes down very smooth."
"D: I like lots of Belgian styles, but I never find myself able to have more than one bottle at a time (and not solely because of the ABV). However, this one bottle went down very nicely, and with some fanfare."
"Got some odd, but interesting flavors in this one. Pours a copper flavor with a slightly uninteresting look to the beer, no head to speak of. But it is rich and full of flavor. Peaches and melons blend through on this one. Warms nicely. No lacing on this one but a terrific tasting beer that I recommend."
"Give this one a try, seems like a good Quadrupel to start out with if you're new to the style. Cheers!"
"D:For a strong Quad this goes down insanely easy. Warms the belly nicely and the flavors are so varied its hard to put down cause you need to keep sipping in order to decipher them. Awesome beer."
"Appeared a lovely burgundy color with rust highlights. A mild, white-colored head with nice lacing left behind in my goblet. Aromas of plums, figs, dried fruit, and candy. The taste was smooth and semi-crisp with dried fruit and hard candy flavors dominating. Somewhat creamy texture with a dry and slightly sour finish. Easy to sip, but a bit too rich (sweet and alcohol is apparent in the taste)."
"A slightly bitter aftertaste lingers, along with a warming sensation in the back of the throat. There's absolutely nothing to dislike here. As far as I can tell, this American beer is a kindred spirit in color, aroma, and taste to its Belgian elders. Nice job, Avery!"
"Pours a light orange color. Clear, with little head to speak of but medium carbonation. Smell is light colored dry fruit and alcohol. Taste is syrupy sweet. More dried fruit and alcohol. Heavy body. Aftertaste is sweet and sticky. Coates the mouth. Surprisingly easy to drink for the high alcohol and heavy body. Not quite what I want from a quad, but good none the less. Don¬ít look for something overly complex here and you will be satisfied."
"I think this is a very good beer, worth looking for."
"The color is clear dark copper with a small tan head. The nose has dark fruit, candy, Belgian yeast, and lots and lots of alcohol. The flavor profile has a lot of sugary sweet malt, fruit, alcohol (it work's fairly well in this brew), yeast, pepper, and tiny hint of hop bitterness in the background. Mouthfeel is medium to thick with good carbonation. Avery is going to come out with an English mild next month. It'll be 7.3% ABV."
"The color of the beer is beautiful, dark cherry amber, but there was very little head, which promptly turned into no head at all (nor lace, nor ring). The smell was sweet, full of cherry, wheat, phenols and a lot of alcohol lurking just below the surface. I also caught a bit of a nuttly aftersmell. Taste was sweet sweet sweet, with a citrus cherry syrup dominating. It's balanced alot more on the front, while the middle and back are almost oppressively sweet (I struggle to identify any other taste sensation perhaps hidden underneath). The aftertaste has (again) a slightly nutty bit to it, along with a hint of smoke, but was still dominantly sweet and alcohol. Mouthfeel was good, nice body up front, and plenty of tickly carbonation running to the back. The lack of complexity and the hefty alcohol tag keep the drinkability down somewhat, but altogether, not too bad."
"This beer reminded me most of a barleywine, as it seemed to share a lot of the same qualities. Its pretty much the same color, maybe a slight shade lighter. Very malty sweet nose. I taste barleywine all over this beer. I'm not even sure how I'd differentiate between the two. I drank this with dinner in the hot July Maryland summer, and it was not very refreshing"
"Avery, baby. Yeah it is!."
"Taste; as with the smell, the sweetness really jumps out at first with brown and candied sugar, but once it warms it's not quite as pronounced. The fruits are there with raisins, plums and dates and finishes with a slightly subdued spiciness. Alcohol is felt more than tasted, but it's presence is there in the background. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for what I would expect for a quad, with a fairly low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good for the big ABV."
"This beer had a clear red tinted copper color with a small light tan head. The smell is strongly phenolic, getting many fruits, apple, cherry, orange, and plum; there is a bit of alcohol in the smell too. The taste is almost cloying, very sweet and fruity with a spicy hop and alcohol bite. The body is medium and it ends pretty dry. The alcohol bite makes it a slow sipping beer."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, high abv is the limiting factor here."
"Overall, it's interesting. I do like it, though i dont think it compares to the great beers that are in this style. But still good. Quite sweet. The score i gave it is lower just because of it's comparison within the style. It is a good beer though."
" Full bodied. Fairly active carbonation tingled the tongue."
"D: Very smooth and very drinkable, and with a 10% ABV watch out for it. The ease of this beer might go down smoothly but you must watch out for it because it can grab you a little harder then expected."
"Give me more."
"This one¬ís an awesome sipper. I feel stupid for having left this one on my shelf for so long. I really should have had this sooner. It¬ís very light for the stile and very tasty!"
"More of a sipper, but at 10% ABV... Why not. Overall a decent beer."
"Bottle: Poured (in a Chimay glass) a clear medium copper color ale with a small head with minimal retention. Aroma is quite hot with alcohol and very sweet cookie dough. Taste is also dominated by the sweet cookie dough and some strong alcohol traces. Definitely lacking complexity and the dry figs/prune character that I usually like to find in a quadruple. Too sweet for its own good, alcohol is way too apparent and body is too thin are all characteristics in beer that I usually don¬ít track down and that¬ís why I won¬ít be buying this again."
"UPDATE: It's come to my attention that I may be confusing ""smokiness"" with ""cloves."" I may be tasting cloves and thinking clove cigarettes. Either way, it's not a taste I enjoy, but I just don't want to mislead anyone."
"Color is a bright, clear maroon. Head is of average height and is light brown. Aroma is of dark fruity malt with added sweet belgian sugar and just an edge of spices. Initial taste is a combination of dark fruit and candi sugar. Ample spice flavor is noted throughout and towards the middle of a sip mixes with the Belgian sugar which creates a cinnimon-like impression. An edge of alcohol is noted throughout and is well-hidden at 10%. The finish is enjoyably sweet and long lasting. This is a complex beer with many layers of flavor to enjoy and is highly recommended."
"This is a tasty treat that I plan to drink this again. Alcohol is well concealed. Fruity and complex with a balanced bitterness. It's amazing how easy this is to drink while having such a high ABV."
"Overall a very drinkable 10percent beer. Tasty and dangerous."
""
"The Reverend is my new best friend. This high octane beer will hit you by surprise. Very smooth for the high alcohol content 10% ABV. Seeing the Rev only come in 22 oz. bottles you have to be careful. With hints of fruit and sweetness, the brewers at Avery sure have put together a good beer here. Maybe its all the Belgium candy sugar they use."
"Pours a translucent medium reddened orange with no head and some islands of bubbles. The carbonation is good-sized and soda-like. Smell is somewhat fruity, woody, and candyish. But nothing is bold or strong. Taste is quite smooth for such a high ABV beer. There is a thick rush of dark fruits and mellow alcohol burn. The mouthfeel only suffers from a bit too much carbonation. Pleasing aperitif that should be easy to quaff but beware the high octane."
"Overall: A very sweet and fruity drink. Although the Belgian presence is there it seems to be a little less polished as I've had. Frankly the flavor isn't as much as a few Belgian tripels I've had. Really worth the try."
"The flavor is very sweet and fruity with a slight warming hint of alcohol. The sweetness is candy sweet, but, it also turns your mouth inside out from sourness. I could not finish this one and had to pour it out. It may be remincent of the style, but, I had to pour it out."
"Copper currency. Rich, doughy malts, sweetened fruits, sugars and yeast in the aroma, giving a hint of peanut butter and bubble gum. Perhaps a hint of herbs in the aroma as well. Phenolic and fairly subtle tasting, with a light flavor overall considering its style and potency as well as several strange flavors, including plastic. Bright, spicy yeast flavors, with hints of cinnamon. The flavors are not really cloying like it is for some folks, but it isn¬ít as juicy and flavorful as the best Quads."
"Overall it is a quality beer as a winter warmer ale but not a true belgian quadruple ale. It could benefit from more structure, body, layers of flavor and a heavier mouthfeel to live up to quality belgian ale. It would be best drank warm for full effect with a traditional spiced dessert such as raisin bread or rice pudding."
"this beer is a tarty smooth and finishes dry. a bit too sweet to be terribly drinkable, but good for a glass after a meal, especially not chilled but at room temperature."
"jazzbeerde""pew"""
"Very drinkable for the abv.... a nice, solid brew, but like alot of Avery's products, missing a certain ""something"" in my opinion."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Sharp & tangy, but just a tad harsh with the alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Perhaps drinkability is on the low side with the high abv, but still a pleasant evening spent with the Rev."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is good on this offering from Avery. Its a full bodied strong abbey that'll keep you warm on a winter's night. Carbonation is high at first but gives way to the malts leaving a nice after taste in your mouth. Definately very drinkable. I would try this again."
"However, this is a very tasty beer, well suited to fireside contemplation."
"Overall a bit sloppy. Can't drink much of this brew. Wishing I had about 3 other people to share it with."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable actually. Pretty good example of the style. Not much heat and pretty flavorful. Nice one."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty good beer. It is a bit fruity for my taste, and I would like it to have a bit more contribution from the malt than from the yeast bi-products. It is a clean and well taken care of brew, and one that I will surely drink again. This one would likely benefit from some extended (year+) of cold aging to let the fruitiness mellow and the complexity increase."
"22 ounce bottle. The Reverend pours out a slightly hazy amber color with a small head. The aroma is sweet and malty, with a fruit and nuttiness in the background that reminds me of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Sweet flavor, with a strong alcohol component. The fruity flavor is nearly cloying, which is very much unlike the better of this beer's Belgian counterparts. There's a pleasant spiciness in the finish, as well as a moderate hoppiness. Drinkability is pretty good, given that this is a 10% abv brew. This is not a terrible beer overall, but there aren't many Quadrupels to compare it to, and many of those others are truly exceptional beers."
"Overall I like this brew. Very strong in both flavor and alcohol, but not upsetting."
"Clean tasting with a smooth mouthfeel. Full bodied. A very nice beer overall. I may have to repent and visit the Reverend at another date in the near future."
"Pretty drinkable, but one is enough! Reminds me of a turbo-charged double,open your eyes, give it a try"
"The appearance is a clear copper body with a medium tan head and nice lacing. The aroma is a sweet grapefruit with slight alcohol end. The creamy beginning is rich citrusy fruit ending with a heavily carbonated slight alcohol aftertaste. All in all a wonderful brew with quite a kick. The taste was smooth and fruity the only drawback is the alcohol end and after the first glass you don¬ít care."
"The Reverend is a little less than some of the best Quads out there and that merits attention because I can buy two Reverends (roughly) for the price of one Rochefort 10. If your in the mood for several Quads, the Reverend is a best buy."
"Hazed light caramel colour topped by a thin, light brown head that produced a bit of spotty lace. Plum, raisin, and caramel in the aroma, along with some breadiness. Prune and raisin, with bready yeast, form the flavour base. Mild spice and alcohol round things out. Low carbonation, medium bodied. The alcohol was nicely hidden in this brew, making it an easy drink. Thanks Mike!"
"This was crystal clear and amber with no head. Nice sweet nutty nose but nothing outstanding. Taste is malty and sweet ¬ñ kind of like an eisbock. Thick, sweet, strong, slightly herbal. Maybe this needs two years to reach its full potential and cut the sweetness. I do love the strength though. As it warms you can appreciate the sincere attempt at this Belgian style."
"Incredibly drinkable for the style, I was quite impressed with this beer. Age obviously has a lot to do with this. I would be interested to see how this beer was fresh, but with some age on it I¬íd have to concede its one of the best American-made examples I¬íve encountered."
"Pours out to a soild dark bronze color with a small off-white foam head. Medium low level of carbonation. Whisps of lace in the glass. Aromas of bready yeast and dark rotten fruit. Some sweet odors as well. Taste has some depth to it, but not enough to match up to real Belgians; full maltiness, sweet, candied alcohol, some sweet grain and yeast. Alcohol had a highly warming quality. Interesting. Mouthfeel was slightly thick and syrupy, but remained easily consumable. A good level of drinkability. For the price, this is a deal. Recommended."
"Thanks Mike!"
"This beer might make a decent session beer. The alcohol content is a little high, but the flavor is mild enough, to make up for that. I think this beer is good. I would buy this one again."
"Rusty red color..no visible yeast sediment. The aroma is brown sugar and a little butterscotch mixed with Belgian yeast smells. The sugary presence also comes through in the taste, with the brown sugar sweetness playing a pretty big part in this brew. Alcohol is very subdued and hidden behind the thick flavors. The Belgian yeast and native malts really shine through here, and it was a very tasty offering of a traditional Belgian style."
"The body is big. A bit of a syrupy texture. Sure it's a quad, but its is way to hot. Even with age, I wonder how this will blend in."
"The Reverand -- what a great name for a Belgian Quadrupel. Tried this one out at out Carolina Brewmasters meeting tonight and was definitely impressed. Hoppy yet not too bitter, easy enough to drink considering its high alcohol content. Great sparkle in the mouth."
"22oz. Bomber Pours a cloudy copper color, some carbonation, small head which leaves pretty quick, nice lacing though. Scents of malt, fruit, and sweetness. The taste is very sweet and kinda syrupy. Medium body. Very drinkable for a 10% ABV brew. This is my first Avery and first Quad. I like this brew alot very nice in deed. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. I would highly recommend this to people."
"Drinkability: This is for sharing."
"D - This is too sweet and syrupy to want to drink much."
"A Belgian Quad? I guess. Basically it was a big 10% alcohol beer without much flavor. No real Belgian yeast or phenol notes, not a whole lot of spice, just sort of alcohol. It¬ís definitely a beer I¬íd recommend drinking only at room temp as it¬ís 1000 times better, but basically a sad excuse for a Belgian quad."
"overall: a good purchase. i'd definitely buy it again"
"This beer has a heavy malt aroma with some dough, cherry, and port. Not as a full aroma has many great quda have. The head was fizzy and disappeared in 15 seconds. There was no lacing. Body was brown. Initial flavor was heavily sweet with a short finish. Hard to nail down the texture; only slightly syrupy. The carbonation was soft and a difinite, moderate alcohol finish. Certainly not one of my favorite quads. I have another that I'll let staty in the cellar for a year."
"High ABV combined with high sweetness and high price tag($6.99), makes this one a one and done."
"Drinkability: For me this has always been a very drinkable beer. The Reverend is full of first for me. This was the first American Craft beer I experienced. This was also the first BIG BEER I drank. Further more the Reverend will always remind me of my wife. She purchased the Reverend on an impulse buy."
"The flavor has the candi sugar sweetness throughout, with a slight bit of dark fruitiness, and caramel malts. It is full bodied and warming. It is a bit on the sweet side, with an alcohol warmth in the finish. This one is pretty good, just needs a bit more depth."
"Drinability is good and relatively cheap for the style, something I need to try more of."
"Mouthfeel- Heavy feeling in the pallete, alcohol coating in the mouth. Lightly carbonated."
"My first quadrupel. Pours a light amber with a decent white head. The aroma of malt so sweet you can taste it bannana, citrus. tastes of sweet caramel malt and fruit with a decent hop balace. You can taste the power of the alcohol, but not too overpowering. Peaches,bannanas. I already need another. These could be addictive."
"Body is below medium, definately not up to the standards of a good Quad. Mouthfeel is slick and wet, with softy fizzy carbonation. Needs time to mellow out. Still, a decent interpretation of the style."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma begins with dark fruits, followed by candied sugar, fruity ale esters, toasted bread, alcohol and some minerals. The flavor also begins with dark fruit (plum, fig, raisin, grape, pear) followed by candied sugar, a light spicy hops character, some esters and an alcohol ridden finish, The mouthfeel is a tad on the light side and drinkability is greatly diminished by the alcohol. A halfway descent quad (but in this style halfway doesnt cut it), but the alcohol is way too aparent and in your face, which is typical of some of Avery's brews."
"Overall a nice Belgian offering from Avery. If nothing else, the bottle is hilarious. Definitely worth picking up, especially for the price. The peachy/apricot flavors are really unique and fit in nicely."
"Strong beer, but a very pleasant sipper. Good to split with a friend."
"Drinkability: Now that I'm about halfway through the bottle, some of the sweetness and the alcohol is getting to me a bit. Then again, this is a 22 oz. quad, so maybe I should've saved it also for some others. Still, for about $5 a bottle, it's definitely worth a shot."
"Pours a reddish amber/mahogany, a little cloudy with a nice white head that succumbs to the 10% rather quickly. Smell was a little funky for me at first, heavy on the green olives and cloves, dark fruits, and alcoholic vapors. Taste continues with the somewhat harsh olive/clove, candied figs, dates, and cherries, some hops, and kick you in the teeth booze. Mouthfeel is champagne bubbly, and rich. It was a little harsh at first, but definitely mellowed out as it warmed, trading some of the olive/clove for candied fruits. An interesting quad, definitely a big beer here. Didn't blow my mind, but worth a try and a good deal at $5 for a bomber."
"a great beer, and the alcohol is very well hidden on both the nose and the palate, even at warmer temperatures."
"Drinks fine and easy enough, but its lack luster to say the least and is missing the complexity a Quad should have. My $6 could have been better spent."
"This is a decent nightcapper and a decent representation by an american brewery, but its not very complex, nor does it carry any depth. Unfortunately this one runs into a group of beers that have potential to be the greatest beers in the world. It's like in diving, only certain dives can get a perfect score, well quads have that potential and this is rather pedestrian."
"Dark brown-copeer color, head is large at first, but the high ABV quickly surpresses it to a thin white layer. Musty belgian yeast, raisins, plums, big alcohol and sweet brown sugar malt. Taste is full and sweet, the belgian yeast adds a nice musty funk, lots of fruitiness, tart and bitter on the finish. Where is the 10% abv? It is very well hidden, although you do get a nice warming sensation from it. An excellent beer, perfect for this September-seeming night in Minnesota."
"Pretty drinkable considering the ABV, but somewhat underdeveloped compared to the best beers in the category. Alcohol esters and hop bitterness a bit overwhelming."
"Good attempt at an American Belgian. Quad's often allow the alcohol to become harsh, abrupt, and over power all other flavors. This still happens with the Reverend, though lesser than most, even Belgians. This has a big candied flavor on the lips. Sweet alcohol soon rises. The spiciness is a bit overdone, but the body is nice and full. American hops decorate the body and help to create heat with the alcohol. The alcohol becomes too hot and stingy and the sweet body gives way into the finish. Reveals a bit of grainy and slickness. I'll have it again, it's a good attempt."
"Overall Impression: For an Avery beer, it¬ís quite good. Flavors are clean and fresh, the alcohol, although substantial, is well integrated. It has a nice Belgian edge and a full taste, a sermon worth sitting through!"
"Lightly translucent but bright reddish-colored brown, decent yellow head of almost 1/2 an inch in height. Laces in dripping rings. Nice aroma, fruit infused, honeyish, with generous tones of vanilla and malted milk. Mouthfeel is silky and more than medium -- carbonation is fine in texture and well-spaced. Starts very sweet, almost tooth-achingly so, candied cherries and peach jelly predominate. Thickens and shows some underlying alcohol toward the finish. Not very yeasty, a little too thick and like a syrupy cordial, actually out sweetens LaTrappe's Quad -- no mean feat. It stands out as pretty drinkable, surprisingly, if you are in the mood. There is a touch of hop bitterness late, but also something very empty in the glass."
"Belgian quad. The name says it all. This beer poured a dark amber or copper color with slight head which didn't stick around too long. Lucky for me, the flavor did. As did the alcohol. The scent was malty, yeasty and sweet. Very very sweet. The flavor followed that sweet scent. The barley malts were strong. Surprisingly, the flavor also showed some Belgian hops. They came blended nice with the malted flavor. The sugar was sweet, but refreshing and the alcohol flavor wasnt too powerful. When all was said and done I found this to be a nice change of pace, sweet, malty with some hops, oh yeah plus the pretty high ABV. All in all a great experience."
"Surprised I haven't had this one yet (or have I?). Dark copper color with a thick orange/brown head. Pretty good lacing. The aroma is mostly yeast along with some grapefruit and spice. Rich body, and despite not being as complex or flavorful as the best-of-breed in the style it is still enjoyable for the most part. The yeast flavor is at the forefront again, with spice and peppery alcohol undertones. There is a bit of sweet malt hiding in there too. The finish is dry and spicy with a slow alcohol burn. Overall this is a pretty solid brew."
"Avery the Reverend is a fine interpretation of the Belgian Quadrupel style. It's nice to see American breweries trying to reflect the flavors of some of the Trappist beers and abbey ales, though this beer should not be confused with those. I liked it, and I will definitely have to try it again at another time."
"Starts off nicely sweet, not thick and cloying. yeah, it reminds me of smooth applesauce made from some spicy yellow apples. There's a little clove and cinnamon, vanilla and alcohol - a bit on the strong side, that note. Not bad. Very much like a ""quad-style," or american version thereof."
"It rates moderaltely high on my drinkability scale. I'll definitely include this on my bevmo shopping list, mostly because of the unique flavor it offered."
"It's quite nice, but somehow lacks the roundness and fuller breadth of the Belgian examples. Still, it's very drinkable and certainly worth trying."
"A sipper. A couple years in a cool dark place might help this beer."
"Poured from a foilwrapped 22 oz bomber into a Duvel tulip. Pours a clear copper red with a big foamy off-white head that settles to a cap pretty quickly. Aroma is doughy and spicey, with some citrus and apple peels coming through too. Taste is very spicey and along with the alcohol hits you upfront. After the initial shock of the spices, a very nice rich malty flavor comes through, with pineapple, oranges, brown sugar, and clove flavors dominating. With both a big sweetness and a big spiciness, this beer does a good job of balancing the two into a drinkable beer."
"-UF"
"Bold and brash, this should benefit a bunch from aging when the alcohol is allowed to hide, and the flavors open up."
"all in all a fine brew"
"i'd like to see a little more head and perhaps a little better balance. not a bad beer, but there are definately better choices for the stlye. also, the alcohol is a little intrusive."
"Poured a deep copper color with a small creamy-like head,complex aromas at first I picked up some orange rind and a little butter and the alcohol makes it presence known in there as well.pretty straight forward flavors sweet dark fruit with a touch of spicey/yeastiness,the alcohol really warms late.First time trying this Avery big brew solid but there are better ones out there of the style,thanks to hoppedup for sharing his bottle."
"Unlike other Belgian style beers this one is not overly spicy. The malt and spice are nicely balanced in this delicious beer."
"Smooth, deep but not so complex. Very much sweetness of various malts, underlying spiciness. Orange cream, Cherry ice cream, yeastiness, clove, Full mouthfeel and drinkable, but with courses of a dinner to offset sweet attack. Orange colour. A smaller bottle would be better."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and musty scent that is rich in pale malts and dark candy sugar. It's sweet with a bit of fruitiness and a breadlike quality. The taste is decent as well. It has a sweet, malty flavor with thick, warm finish. It has a butt load of dark candy sugar. It lends some sweetness and that sticky finish along with the Belgian yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent quad. I like the flavor, better than the aroma. It's thick and rich, but it just does go down that smooth. It also lacks malt complexity, but it drinks decent despite it."
"The flavor is again toasty malt, meaty, just the right amount of bitterness to balance it out. It's mildly estery, just enough to hint at fresh cherries and candied fruits. The finish is fairly short for a brew of this density. Great with BBQ, yeah!"
"Maybe I haven't had enough of this style to appreciate it yet, but this is not a beer I will try again."
"Mouthfeel is only detracted by the alcohol on the tongue, which is prominent. Though I do like it, I wouldn't rate it high on drinkability because the bottle is difficult to finish..."
"Drinkability: This is one outstanding Quadrupel. Perhaps it lacks a little in complexity but it makes up for that in approachability"
"Dark amber body with a light tan head that fizzles away quickly leaving no traces of its existence. Aroma has a good spiciness and a light sweet fruit. Some candy sugars as well and the alcohol is more than apparent here. It really seems to drown out the other scents as this warms, disappointing. Sweet caramel and sugars are big upfront with a lighter fruitiness backing them. The alcohol is there but really starts to show itself as this warms up. Starts to be a bit to sweet and boozy towards the end of the first glass. Mouthfeel is about medium and fairly smooth going down until the alcohol kicks in. For some reason I still found it pretty drinkable. It wasn¬ít bad just a bit overly sweet and the alcohol starts to stand out too much. Not one of Avery¬ís better creations."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that goes slowly and leaves some lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is spicey alcohol. Starts with a brown sugar and oak taste, hops are hidden in the background and the high ABV is not really noticeable. 22oz bottle for $6.20 from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Medium to full bodied and coating. Cellars well."
"Tastes of the above fruits, a sweet malty flavor throughout and also a very slight sour/astringent flavor that made it a bit more complex. Alcohol is evident at the end of the taste, like all Avery brews. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but it seems to be a trademark of their beers. Gives a warm feeling in the belly after a few drinks. Carbonation is light to medium, body is on the light side of medium. Mouthfeel is pretty good. The finish is surprisingly smooth (especially after having the Czar!) and light, leaving a pleasing faintly fruity sweetness. A very well done beer by Avery."
"we have a winner."
"22 ounce bottle. Best at room temp after allowing to sit in the glass for 1/2 hour, however at those temp the alcohol begins to be more powerful in the aroma and flavor."
"Dark honey colored with a slight off-white head that sinks quickly. Inviting arroma of sweet malt, pungent cinnamon, and sweet fruits, and candy. Flavor is big and rich, sweet but not cloying, not overpoweringly yeasty like some belgian styles seem to me. Definite flavor of clove, some sweet pear and honey, and a warm alcohol tingle in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a bit on the dry side. This is an enjoyable sipper. Thanks to Brent for sharing."
"Comments - My first quadrupel ever, and I am happy with the results. This is a pretty good style of beer, but the flavor is not my favorite."
"Big froth of equal sized bubbling to start, with settling bone white corpuscles and plentiful stick. Deep amber hue verging towards garnet, with good clarity and fly stuck in honey bubble action. Rock candy sweetness, liquid sugar on nose with a core of gangly malt and lemony aspects. Chatter, chatter, gulp, grind goes the sweet malt alcohol punch through the teeth and over the tongue, ripping down the esophagus, though softening at the tail end; sweetness is almost more like a stage set in that it is just the trappings behind which exists a larger and more substantial structure of ruddy malt, zesty esters and citrus finings. In the end, not out of control and rather balanced."
"Drinkability ¬ñ strangely, its not as ¬ëwarming¬í early (but there is impact late) as other big beers or as smooth or complex as some top-level quads I have reviewed; this seems like its too early for the best consumption experience"
"The mouthfeel was quite powerfull. I wasn't quite pleased with the harshness of the alcohol, the sweetness of the malts, the bite of the ginger, and the thick yeasty body. I probably won't drink this again, but I am glad I tried it. I will most likely try other products from Avery when I can get the chance."
"As the beer really started to warm, a strong green grass flavor emerged and almost ruined the beer for me. This prompted me to bump the numbers down quite a bit."
"A very nice tribute to bretheren of the cloth. Very nice, very rich- full of flavor. A medium-dark amber (not brown) that sports a very nice head in a tulip glass. The aromas and flavors are very rich, very heavy, and ery balanced. Fruit, hops, malts, alcohol all are blended nicely. Heavy mouthfeel, too strong to have high drinkability. A nice quad!"
"On the eighth day, the Reverend shall pour a blinding, yet bright inviting amber colored hue. The Reverend shall have no head, and will be still and very quiet. She shall have Belgium spices that dominate the nostrils upon the pour, the aroma can be detected from across the room. The Reverend shall be medium based in the body; very slick and very thick. Belgium spices come to life as she warms up; yeasty and spicy, a sweetness beyond cotton candy or bubble gum; more like a hard-candy sweetness. The alcohol is somewhat contained, yet detectable. The yeast and malt flavorings are present; thanks be to all, and thanks to Avery, thou have erected a fine brew."
"Drinkability: Goes down relativly easy. Almost to easy for the 10% abv"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and very warming as you get to the end of the ""bomber"" (22 oz) that this is usually sold in. I consider the Reverend a solid brew, priced very nicely in the Chicago area ($5 for 22 oz). A tasty treat for a cold winter night!"
"Clear, shiny amber with tawny highlights intermingling with mahogany influences. Almost no head formed, only some random bubbles grouped together momentarily before dispersing completely. After a couple seconds my glass had lovely colored liquid but only a thin collar. Disappointing as a whole. I could write a short list of things I¬íd like to see improved in the appearance but first and foremost would be a foamy head and subsequent lacing. Neither happened. Thankfully the color is beautiful and it does look good in my glass. The nose suffers in potency and thus articulation. I get whiffs of fruit (berries, cherries, some apples and melons), honey, hints of caramelized sugar, candied sugar. The alcohol is noticeable, fairly well hinted for a 10% abv beer. Traces of yeastiness. Overall the bouquet is clean and boring. I was expecting something bolder from Avery. Sure I criticized them from going over the top but this beer is under-whelming. Ordinary nose. The palate is thin and hot and not much more. Very disappointing. There is a muddled mess of sweetness, alcohol, and fruit. When this beer is compared to other Quadrupels it really falls short. Where is the complexity? Where is the malt depth? The alcohol is very well hidden but so are the other flavors! Fruit consists of peaches, grapes, pears, and some berries and melons; this aspect tastes great. The maltiness is very sweet with mushy caramel and candied sugar. Hops are lacking too. This beer has heavy hands but a soft touch. There is nothing bad about this beer (i.e., The Beast) but is shockingly dull! The yeasty qualities do say Belgian and not much else does. Too sticky as well, while it is not quite cloying it is very sweet and cumbersome. This is the littlest big beer I¬íve ever had. Medium in body, kind of thin, the carbonation is low and this really bogs down the mouthfeel. More carbonation is need. I can¬ít see this beer working well with food. I also can¬ít see the need for me to drink this again. It is very easy to drink but so what, I don¬ít enjoy it. It is too simple for the style. What a big-time yawner! I bought a 22-ounce bottle in Loveland, CO. I can¬ít recommend this beer."
"This poured into a tulip glass a bright garnet/copper color. It came out with a light tan colored head that dissipated quickly, but left a sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma had a malty sweetness in addition to a yeast/bread smell. The taste has a sharp sweetness like holiday candy immediately followed by a more dramatic yeast flavor. On the finish there is a fruity tanginess that I¬íve not detected in a quadruple before. Just a touch of alcohol on the finish. This beer has a more substantial mouth feel than I originally expected after smelling it. Very drinkable. None of the characteristics overpower the beer; rather they all come together for an interesting and complex taste."
"What a beautiful crafted beer. The color when poured was a pleasant dark amber brown with a very little brown foam and no lace. The smell was very fruity and spicy withy a mild hop aroma. The taste had a nice balance of holp's and malted barley. Also, the sweet and creamy fruitiness was was just fantastic. The warmer this ale got, the more intense and complex the flavor got. This goes as on of my top 10 ales. To bad it not for sale in California. I found this treasure in Colorado while traveling cross country. Sould have bought more than half a case! Can't wait for Avery to expand there sales area to California."
"This reddish brown ale formed only a modest head and left little lace. The candied sugar and chocolate aroma was intriguing. The blend of chocolate, cherry, and sugar notes provided an interesting and pleasant balance of complexity and intensity. After the Belgian Beer fest, this brew didn't seem so extreme or earth shattering. It was good, but not mind blowing. While I wouldn't call the brew particularly thick or syrupy, I could definitely feel the unfermented sugars. I'd have another, but I wouldn't smuggle it back from Ohio to be revered."
"Clear burgundy. White 1cm foam. Typical avery nose contains the light alcohol vapors and hoppiness. Fruity malt overtones (bubblegum, pears, cherries), almond and caramelised sugars aroma. Palate is also caramelic, earthy, heating. Finish includes traces of grassy, orangey and earthy bitter and astringent hops. All the way through though, there¬ís that dull avery yeast action going on which just doesn¬ít work so well with belgians. Body is fairly full, biting."
"good stuff. big and balanced, those belgian candy sugars are really outstanding in this brew. even though the high abv, drinkability is pretty good (as they always are...). one of the few quads i have had, and makes me want to seek them out more often."
"Pours a beautiful garnet color with a white head that fizzles away fairly fast. It definately carries that smell of belgian candy sugar and I can also smell some alcohol. Obviously because its ABV is 10%. It has a rich taste that almost resembles bubble gum. Sweet and malty with a definate taste of alcohol as well. Great mouthfeel. It has a fair amount of carbonation and a medium body. I think it is a very drinkable beer but be carefull not to hurt yourself. I lot of people don't get into these type of beers. I don't want to know those people. Definately give this a try."
"An easily consumed treat of sugar-fed yeast byproducts. Maybe I can bring this one in to church, that'll spice up those sermons!"
"This beer has a raw , unrefined character. The syrupy sweetness and strong alcohol taste dominate this potentially excellent brew. I'm cellaring a couple bottles in hopes of discovering a diamond in the rough."
"Pours a medium amber color with one finger of head. The smell is full of sweet caramel malt and some plum and white grape. A little bit of alcohol too. The taste is also sweet and fruity. Plums, dates, and grapes with some sugary sweetness. Unfortunately, a big alcohol burn on the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. The drinkability lacks some due to the 10% abv. Not too bad."
"The body is a beautiful ruby-brown, but there is absolutely no head. It didn¬ít matter how hard I poured, I couldn¬ít get anything to form., but it wasn¬ít flat. It wasn¬ít heavily carbonated, but there was enough to make it feel right on the tongue. Juicy fruit, biscuits, caramel, lemon, tea and butter all swirl in a very sweet and slightly thick beer. The complexity is pleasant, but the sweetness verges on being cloying. A nice alcoholic bite helps cut the sweetness a tad."
"On tap over at the Drafting Room in Springhouse, yay! Great brandy color with good amount of carbination and light on the head. Yummy scent of sherry and dark fruit. Lacing in the glass. Great barleywine style here. This is just so freaking good!! Tastes of dark cherries, sherry, and you can taste the alcohol in it- which I do love. The taste changes so much from when you first taste it when it is chilled, to when you let it warm a bit, to the point where it comes to room temperature... well, if you can wait that long! There were some huge chunks of scrod inside the glass from it, but hey, that is the risk we all gotta take here and there! Was not allowed to take any of this away in one of their growlers, rules against it said this was the only one on tap that was a no-go at the time. Big Sigh. But if it was allowed, I think me and drinking buddy would have drained the keg. Next trip back, the handle was gone. This is one I could definately have more than a few of in a sitting, not too heavy/thick, not too sweet, just so good.... yummmm...."
"Beer is good. Happy (CO) beering."
"I am so glad that I found some Avery. This is a very good beer. It pours an unfiltered golden color with a nice white head and good long-lasting lacing. There is a heavy aroma of malt and fruit and a little spiciness. This has a good Belgian style beer with sweet malty taste but with some unexpected spiciness. This is very smooth in the mouth and not thin at all, but is a little sweet so that it didn't lead to another. Altogether though, a very good beer."
"I enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying it again. It is unlike any Belgian style beer I have ever tried and I was very happy with the result."
"A tasty and light brew for its strength. A competent attempt to create the Belgian brew in the USA."
"22 oz. bomber. An interesting take on the style. Ruby colored body with little carbonation or anything really resembling a lasting head. Very sweet aroma of candy sugar, caramel, and a subtle dose of hops. Alcohol is present in the flavor and you can feel it more as it warms. Not nearly as complex as some quads I've enjoyed, and much sweeter to boot. The sugars really outshine anything else in this beer, though there is some noticeable fruity and sweet malts in there as well. A good brew, but nothing to go crazy searching for."
"On tap at the BT NYC. Almond in color and clear. Tiny bubble head, nice lace left behing. Full bodied, Malty sweatness, alcohol noted and warming. Spicy Belgian yeast present. Another very big and bold, complex Belgian style brew. Alot of flavor and character packed into this offering. Not for the faint of heart, will be loved by some including me"
"Too sweet for my tastes."
"Gotta give props where deserved: Avery has been doing an impressive job with several of their offerings like The Beast, White Rascal and The Reverend. This is a brewer to watch."
"Pours a gorgeous ruby red - just really attractive. I smell a bit of alcohol, a little fruit, a touch of caramel, & a lot of sugary sweetness. Wow, the mouthfeel is intense, overly sweet oranges that border on overwhelming. Truly having a tough time getting past the candy & sugar to enjoy any other qualities the beer may have. Aftertaste is more of the same. Really like the brewery, but this beer is not for me."
"Finish is long and just a touch sweet with a light spice to hold the tongue for the next go."
"Pours a gold/amber color... minimal head that doesn't hang out too long... smells well, like a darn good belgian beer. Taste.. I think the brewers let the yeast and alcohol do most of the speaking here... there is very little hop bite, which I like. All around, a very solid, dangerously drinkable beer."
"Smells of sugary sweet vapors, cherries, plums, and other sweetness. Hints of alcohol stun the senses too. Fresh snap of big hop bitterness, but that quickly fades. Taste is loaded with flavors, plums and cherries again. Belgian candi sugars yeild lots of high alcohol heat, but still very smooth and mellow. Medium bodied, but alcohol thins things out toward the finish. Syrupy sweet finish but sticky to the tongue. A bit thin at the bottom, but all the flavors together. An eye raising experience. Cheers to the Belgianbum for this big beer."
"Poured a deep amber color with only a thin quarter inch of head. Fruity, candy-like phenolic aromas. At first I thought that this was an all malt Belgian style quad due to its thick mouthfeel for the style, but as it warmed it seemed to get a little thinner. A good thing for this style otherwise it would just be a barley wine. Nice cherry, bubble gum, cotton candy type flavors flooded the mouth on each sip leaving barely any room for alcohol flavors. I could drink this all night long - well, at least until I fell over. A great American made Belgian style quad."
"ng"
"Tasted in the same week as a Westveleteren and an Allagash, in comparison this is a very poor attempt at a Belgian."
"As an aside, this helped me break in my brand new New Belgium tulip glass and Chimay glass in style."
"I don't know that I would call this a beer true to the style, but it was quite good. They proudly advertise on the label the Belgian sugar aspect of the beer, and there is no question but that a malty sweetness is the achieved objective. Some orchard fruit flavors, more malty than yeast products. Adequate hops bittering to add balance, and perhaps more than one would expect to find in the style. The big alcohol punch is well hidden among the malt, and launches a stealth attack."
"You should definitely try this fantastic brew!"
"Drinks quite well for a beer of its weight, though the alcoholic notes may be a bit too omnipresent to give it higher scores. While it shares some characteristics with the classics, it's obviously not a true Belgian quad in the way Westvleteren, Rochefort and even St-Bernardus are. A nice beer on its own accord, however, and a very nice nightcap among friends."
"Not much of a head on this reddish-brown brew, and what little it has dies down to patches and an off-white ring of lace soon after the pour. Still not a bad looking beer. Aroma of dried apricots and rum-soaked raisins with a good caramel sweetness. They say candy sugar is at the heart of this brew, but it seems to me that it only appears in hints and suggestions while alcoholic cherry syrup and caramel take over. A little too much alcohol presence, even though it is a 10% brew, it could be hidden better. However, the alcohol does calm down a bit in the flavor as it warms. Very smooth mouthfeel, nice. Slight grainy malt presence after warming more, which is pleasant. The candy sugar does show up just a bit more after warming as well, but it's still an undertone. Not a bad brew, I don't think I'd rush out to have it again though."
"Drinkability - One and done on this. A good beer to sample on a cold day due to the warmth of the alcohol, but not something you can drink a few of."
"A nice Belgian-style quad. Certainly isn't ashamed of its alcohol, and on special occasions would be a real treat. Just a bit too big for regular consumption, though."
"1 pint, 6 oz bomber, as shown in the image here. Pours a clear brass colored amber with a small light tan head that fades quickly to circled lacing. Nose is of dark fruity sweet malts and alcohol, but molasses dominates. Mouthfeel is creamy, good carbonation, and pleasant to the palate. The very small head that remains is here to stay. The Belgian candy sugar, advertised on the label, is certainly present in the taste, but is balanced by the Goldings hops quite well here. The high abv, surprisingly, is well disguised by the complex ingredients. Very impressive taste, though a bit heavy. This is a very likeable ale that is very Belgian in nature."
"oz Bomber. Nice looking clear amber colored ale with a dense and creamy head that dies quickly yet leaves scattered lacing inside the glass. Has a very Belgian quality to its aroma, rich in fruit, sweet and malty with a definite presence of candy sugar and yeast. Has a lively effervescent mouthfeel and a medium body which is smooth. The alcohol gives a nice warming sensation yet is absent of it's flavor and only slightly noticable in the nose. The flavor here is quite nice with a good fruity maltiness that has a good spicy peppery flavor as well.This is an excellent example of a good Belgian style which I enjoyed very much."
"Overall the beer is mush less complex than I expected and is not very drinkable due to the overwhelming strength of alcohol flavor present."
"Pours a lightly hazy tawny copper color with a thin beige head. Even opening the bottle I smelled cognac-like alcohol. Picked up on a bit of nuttiness and biscuity aroma as well as a good dosage of floral and vinous esters. Alcoholic warmth begins the sip followed with some caramel malty flavors and finishes a touch fruity and dry. Again, esters showing through. Lovely brew. Works great as an apertif or to help you forget what area code you live in."
"This one poured a straight-forward red color, redder than any belgian I have seen before. It had a very thick, medium sized off-white head to it. The aroma was really sweet, fruity sweet. The taste was a little watery, could this really be a 10% abv beer? I didn't notice the alcohol until towards the end when the beer began warming up and when the beer went down I definitely got that belly warming sensation. As for actual taste, this beer was overly sweet and not complex enough, the yeast didn't really settle right either. But again, as it warmed it began to taste better...or maybe that was due to the fact that I was getting pretty buzzed! Anyways, at $2.99 for 1 pint 6 oz. of the stuff, I will be stocking up on it."
"Clear amber colored beer, pours with a small white & tan head. Malt prevalent in aroma followed by the yeasty, fruity Belgian aromas. Taste is malty, alocohol is there but well-hidden. Medium body in the mouth, little bit light as compared to style for me. Little bit of spiciness but overall kind of mellow. Expected more complexity in malt and yeast mix. Solid but not great beer."
"Clear amber colored beer, pours with a thin wispy head until it is swirled, the head is tannish. A malty aroma at first and then you get the yeast contributions, sharp estery, definitely Belgian. Fairly mellow beer, hides the 10% alcohol fairly well, though it is evident in the finish. Lightly sweet, it has a slightly herbal tea like finish, quite interesting. In the end it does not seem to work very well though, not to sure why. It is half way decent just not wonderful."
"22 oz bottle with red foil covering the cap and neck. Stylistic artwork of a Reverend standing in front of a stained glass window. Pours a clear reddish-amber with a light tan head. A lot of carbonation visible in the body. Aroma consists of yeast, fruit (mangos?) and the unmistakable presence of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Slight sweet candied front. Bland middle. It's hard to detect and hops or malt characteristics. Some spiciness. Finishes with hints of dark fruit, yeast and strong alcohol. Flavors do not seem complex enough, but the 10% alcohol will certainly lift your spirits."
"This is one of my favorite styles of beer, and I'm glad that Avery took a valiant stab at producing their version, but it lacks a lot in the complexity department, something a beer of this type should never suffer from. Not perfect, but not too terrible, either...though it ended up; tasted more like whiskey than beer by the end of the bottle!"
"edit: style was changed to Belgian Quadrupel, I agree with that more than ""Strong Dark Ale", its just a light Quad."
"The beer poured a dark amber color with a large head that settled quickly. The aroma was filled with notes of caramel and alcohol with some malts as well. The flavor was surprisingly smooth, given the alcohol aroma. The malts were present foremost in the taste, with the caramel being close second. Not a bad beer at all."
"The beer looks like I poured a frothy glass of Juicy Juice. Kinda cloudy and not too much head. I'm color blind so I can't give you much more than that. Almost a sickly sweet smell. And taste is sickly sweet too. Too much sugar not enough carbonation. I guess the only thing going for it is its high alcohol content. I bought it because is was a quadruple. Should have realized that I like dubbels better than tripels. The quad is just that much further away from my style preference. I won't be buying another one of these."
"Drinkability ¬ñ I thought that this one was a little unbalanced and went down rather clumsily."
"The body is medium and finishes fairly clean. The high alcohol is fairly well hidden in the flavor profile, but is noticable on the nose. Very drinkable, but a little to sweet to have 3-4 at a time."
"Overall I feel this is a well crafted ale. I wanted more of a balance. It probably goes well with a fine mild cigar. I may give that a try one day. Unfortunately this will not be a regular in my fridge. I enjoyed it but my expectations were just too high."
"This is an absolutely beautifully colored beer. The pour created a look that was quite brilliant and seemed to have an inner glow quality to it. The very deep amber to copper body was tinged with incredible red hues that seem to intensify when brought to light. Unfortunately this lovely look was crowned by a most minimal head appearance and only rudimentary lace deposits. The nose was complex but was overwhelmingly of caramel malt. The first taste of this beer provides an impressive bite that spills out against the tongue as if in assault. Quite warming yet masking its substantial alcohol base, the flavor quickly grows to a very familiar state. The finish is nicely peppery in sense and gives a good full mouthfeel."

"Glowing orange color. Medium head. Aromas are malts, fruits and brown sugar. A full-bodied Belgian Style Ale. The malts are bold, very sweet and fruity. Yeasty, with a hint of spiciness. Its very sweet, perhaps overly so. But, its also very smooth. There are hints of the 10% alcohol, some in its slightly ""oily"" texture and most noticeable it is warming effect, but it has no alcohol bite. This is a nice sipping beer, once you can get past its sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"($5.49 / 22 oz.)"
"Sweet creamy toffee dominates the nose, but there's also quite a bit of peppery spice in there with some grapes and a little bread. The front is syrupy sweet. Mostly candy, with bananas and bubblegum. The middle is very malty. Thick. Some apples make an appearance in the spicy finish. When cool, the alcohol is quite prominent in the finish, but that goes away as the beer (or maybe the beer drinker) warms. The aftertaste is nicely bready. Overall, I like this quite a bit more than Salvation. It's more deserving of the ""Belgian-style"" in the name, too, I think. For me, it's a little too sweet, but otherwise -- very good."
"Imposing bottle, whose central image is that of a very serious looking reverend who seems to gaze straight into your soul as though to ascertain your worthiness for the elixir contained within. This ain¬ít no kum-by-yah singing, let¬ís all hold hands kinda priest. This guy is straight up, old school, latin-speaking hell-and-damnation, and the beer he¬ís guarding is the pure demon-melting holy water stuff. Brimstone color with just the thinnest of thin heads. The aroma is a beguiling blend of candi sugar, sweet malt, and Belgian yeast. Soul-cleansing spiciness right from the start, a bit peppery in flavor, blends with candi sugar sweetness and yields gently into a deep fruit malt flavor. Nice hop bite at the end. Full in body, but well-carbonated enough to go down fairly smoothly. No spices listed on the label ¬ñ hard to believe there aren¬ít any added. Good stuff overall, the high alcohol content is hidden fairly well. Just watch the quantity of your consumption or you¬íll be speaking in tongues in no time."
"What a beautiful site is this transpicuous mahogany colored elixir of life setting in my glass with the modest and creamy head all cutesy and light tan in color? As it degrades the silky coating of lace is left behind to seal off the glass. Fusel alcohol, sweet caramel, malts, fresh and clean, a superb nose for sure and the start thickly malt sweet and the top full and rich in its feel to the palate. Finish has a delightful hop presence, the carbonation delicate and the aftertaste quite dry. The high ABV makes itself known as a nice ¬ìBelly Warming Feel¬î, and a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, hearty and robust and a must try for the ¬ìBad Boys and Girls¬î in the audience."
"If you can rank beer by the number of times I said ""Omigod!"" during its disappearance, then this is a ten."
"A great drinking beer for 10% ABV, and a good Belgium ¬ëStyle¬í Quadruppel."
"I wasn't that impressed with this beer. Sweet and a little spicy aroma. The taste is very sweet and rich, and then fades to a slight bitterness. The alcohol sometimes is noticeable and sometimes is not. Not a bad brew by any means, not exciting either. Try it if you'revery curious."
"This is a very good brew, well crafted with no perceptible off flavors, but it really needs some help in the carbonation department to compete with the native Belgian Quads. I'm brewing a Westy 12 with Wyeast 3787 next weekend, so it's refreshing to drink this and know that it tastes nothing like Westmalle (the source of 3787), which is think is a horrible brew."
"Pours a reddish orange hue with a white head. Smells like a combination of yeast, spice, and candied sugars. Tastes great, the smells I smelled I also tasted. As the beer warmed more flavors emerged, and those present earlier became more intense. It may not be filtered, but I am not a purist. A very tasty brew, plus at 10% abv, it is very nice for a cold winter evening."
"Pours a reddish mahogany color with a creamy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin ring of lace. Nose is sweet candied sugar, dark sweet fruit, and spice. First sip is overpowering sugar sweetness, but soon fades as some tart citrus notes express themselves. As the beer warms, flavors of molasses, currants, and dark cherries begin to come through. Can¬ít tell by the taste or smell that it¬ís 10% abv. Once you get past the initial sweetness, this is an enjoyable brew."
"for being in the belgian style i would have thought this to be slightly clouded with yeast, i was dead wrong, holding this beer up to the light it was a brilliant burnt ornage/amber color with the perfect 1/2 inch pearl, small bubble head. it was so thick it reminded me of a root beer float. the aroma at first was of raosted malt, citrus, grape and bitter hop. midway through it i went back for another smell before sip and was totally caught off guard when i smelled nuts. after a few more sips i decided to go get a small piece of cashew from downstairs, yup cashew. interesting for the ""belgian style"" . the taste was of a sweet lingering malt, alcohol and spicy hop bitterness. it had a super dry finish which i rather enjoyed. there was no sediment or yeast anywhere in the bottle, another little side weirdness for something that is in the ""belgian style"" may not be perfect to style, but i really enjoyed this interpretation. watch out though, you can taste the alcohol, slightly, but theres a bunch in there."
"Thanks to TXHops for the beer."
"Pours with a clear copper body and short-lived head. Perhaps filtered(?); first for a Belgian. I like the presence of some yeast and cloudiness. Smells sweet, with a hint of Belgian yeast. Taste is rather simple when compared to Trappists and other Abbeys, as well as Ommegang and Allegash. Assertive alcohol burn (wait, this is 10%??? Not too bad in that case). Other notes: sweet, a bit tart in the mid-taste, and some yeast flavor. All in all, not a bad interpretation. Much like my first Belgian homebrew: simple, sweet, and highly alcoholic (on the other hand, this is crystal clear, whereas my brew was quite cloudy and opaque)."
"Crystal clear bronze hue, covered by a dense, moderately thick off white head that settles slowly.  Belgian lace is left.  Floral and spicy hops hit the nose at first, then are ensued by light notes of peppery alcohol and mildly fruity red licorice sweetness.  Fermentation byproduct contributions in aroma are very understated, and consist only of slight clove phenol.  A trace, but pleasant chalky note adds a drying contrast towards the end of the aroma.   Bright, sugary sweetness upfront in flavor is quickly countered by hop bitterness above the norm for style and a floral hop flavor.  When coupled w/ the sweetness the floral hops lend a perfume like character that persists from start to finish.  Clove is slightly more assertive than than expected from the aroma and provides a token ""Belgian"" quality in flavor.  Mid palate sweetness widens and becomes dark caramel malt derived in nature.  A touch thin in body, but w/ sufficient dextrins to help lend an agreeably smooth mouthfeel.  Hop bitterness has faded appreciably by the finish, which is mostly of residual sweetness and mellow, black licorice like alcohol.  Reverend is an odd and enjoyable brew.  Although it lacks the complexity of many Dark Strongs and is too ""clean"" all around, it is a unique brew in itself.  The apparent filtration may have stripped flavor contributions from the yeast strain, but the floral hop profile and overall softness faciltate excellent drinkability. Very quaffable considering the supposed strength."
"Almost like a macro interpretation of a quad.  Drinkable but not much else."
"Supposedly an American interpretation of a Belgian quad.  Nice dark amber color and smallish tan head.  Smell and taste, though, are just average -- heavy and sweet (not too sweet) maltiness with some hoppy notes later on, but none of that yeasty, complex Belgian character.  Mouthfeel is a little better, catching the syrupy nature of a quad.  Pretty drinkable for a 10% abv brew, but it's definitely lacking in complexity for the style."
"Pours with a quick white head that falls upon brilliant brass-colored liquid. Nose is sweet malt and even sweeter Belgian candi sugar. Taste is exquisite sweet candi sugar, upstaged by a hop upsurge...very nice! Finish is slightly dry with more of the candi sugar note returning along with alcohol. Great U.S. Belgian interpretation."
"This beer poured a dark copper amber color.  Formed a white head that didn't hold for very long and left little lace.  Heavy amount of carbonation common to this style.  The aroma had malt and some spice element to it.  The taste was malt and spice with a slight hint of the alcohol.  It has a medium body and finish that just seemed to be lacking something.  Since I have tried few of this style, review may change in the future."
"Only the second quadrupel I've tried (Weyerbacher QUAD is the other one). I respect both brewers immensely for attempting the style. Anyway, The Reverend has a deep orange/copper color, with minimal head. Actually quite nice to look at. The smell is sweet, somewhat like caramelized orange, with spicy hints of pepper. Very nice! Taste is initially sweet (almost too much so), though it gives way to a citrus twang, followed by a spicy alcohol punch, finishing with a lingering bittersweet aftertaste. Very complex. Tonight, however, I was in the mood for a bit of complexity, so this was a really nice treat!"
"Nice brew!! Strong, malty, a touch sweet. Nice small spicy hop presence. It could have used a little more flavor from the yeast to amke it more Belgiany but all and all a very tasty and very drinkable."
"Not sure what to think about this one.  The amber colored liquid had a decent head that died off with sweet malty aroma. It tasted quite sweet and effervescent with a medium to strong malt body.  Some noticeable alcohol, I mean how can you avoid it at 10% but it was ok.  Not a beer for the weak.  I may have to drink another one to pick up some more stuff that I feel like I'm missing"
