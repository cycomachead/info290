"Overall – The look and feel of this beer make it one of the best. It's a flavorful quad but isn't too sweet. I'm glad I had it on draft."
""
""
""

"3/31/15 (Bottle) - Very dark brown pour, generous thick tan head. Aromas included malts, fruits, raisins and spices. Incredibly smooth to drink, light carbonation, beer went down easy despite the heavy ABV, though you did feel it later.Well balanced taste of malts, hops and flavor. Right amount of ""wrong", sweet and firm. Overall an excellent beer, one of the best I ever had."
"First of my big three, definitely worth a try. It has light notes on the nose and goes down smooth winter or summer. Not quite as full bodied as the Rochefort, but still a complex taste for the feel."
"Perfect beer to drink with the boys"
""
""
"This was my first quad ever.  Very smooth for a 10%'er.  My biggest takeaway was from the mouthfeel.  I loved the level of carbonation which is best described as a delicious ale infused alka seltzer.  Great smooth flavors with little to no aftertaste.  I'll recommend this one and will definitely quad again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"How have I never had this beer before? Just amazing !"
""
""
""
"I took a nice vacation to Belgium and got to try a bunch of beers while I was there. I went to a small pub in Bruges and the bartender recommended this. I wasn't disappointed at all.  Best beer I had the entire trip and contender for the best beer I've ever had. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  balanced very well between malts, esters and booze.  Dangerous in the fact that I can not tell this is a 10% beer.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The ale of the Gods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Understated Quad, especially given the 10% ABV.  Very mellow on the palate, which says a lot for the complexity of this beer.  Subtle raisin taste, perfect finish, not too sweet like most Quads."
""
""
""
"Everything you would want in a quad."
""
""
""
"Great Belgian.  Nice toffee color and malty/fruity taste.  Not the best I've had, but may have had my expectations too high."
"Delish. What more do you want from a beer."
""
"Pours a chestnut brown white thick white head, roughly 3 fingers length. Fruity smell typical of many Belgians. Raisan and fruit notes again with the taste. Very smooth for the alcohol content. Cannot taste the alcohol at all. Very impressed and see why this beer has its high rating. Leaves me wanting to explore other Quad style Belgians."
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
"I guess the yeast just didn't do the job well for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Amazing beer, and considering you can get this one at most bottle shops pretty easily and not all that pricey and the fact that Westy 12 is so hard to come by (I am totally happy I had the opportunity to try it and if I ever find myself in Belgium, I will be heading there for sure!) this one is a dead heat in my opinion. I will say that I did enjoy the Westy a little bit more due to the clean flavor and finish and to me that is becoming a majorly important component of a quality beer. But, this is a very well made beer and do not discount it because its more available, there is only a minor difference in quality that I can detect, but it is worthy of note."
"This is a fabulous beer. Very malty front. More sweet and a bit heavy for everyday drinking. But oh my if you have time to enjoy it you can do no wrong!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried a fresh bottle vs. a bottle aged over 1 year.  The difference was very noticeable.  The bouquet on the aged bottle was much nicer, very complex and rich and you could smell vanilla and brown sugar.  The taste of the aged bottle wasn't quite as nice as the smell or as good I would have hoped for.  Still has a bit of harshness to it but has more caramel like flavors and is more refined than the fresh bottle. The fresh bottle doesn't have the complex vanilla bouquet, but more the typical Belgian banana smell.  The taste of the fresh bottle is more tart.  Overall I wasn't nearly as impressed by this one as I thought I would be.  The aged bottle was noticeably better, but still didn't blow me away or live up to the hype of the high scores. WNBA."
""
""
""
""
"I would review this but it's the staple of the style really. It's the have to have to say you know the style. If you drink old world beer, you've had this. Nuff said."
""
""
""
"P.S.: This beer is WAY better when it warms a bit."
"Just not a fan of Quads.  Need something hoppy."
""
""
""
""
"Possibly the perfect beer. I would drink this every day if I could afford to!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and coats your mouth one of my favorites even if its pricey its well worth it best quad EVER!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am simply overwhelmed with quality of this true Belgian classic. Thick persistent foam, beautiful color and thick smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation. The flavor/nose profile - WOW! Raisins, dried fruit, banana, clove, sourdough bread, grass and even soy sauce!! The flavors are developed- clear, bold assertive. I'm going to dream about this one."

"I don't really know what to say, but the site is forcing me to write a review. I've never had any other quad to compare to, so I guess this just didn't appeal to me much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say? It's my favorite quad and it remains to seem to be that way."
"My first quad. I really liked it. Beautiful looking with a thick texture but I didn't find it mind-blowing in the way its reputation suggests."
"A great beer. Best quad I've tried. You could write lots about this beer but all I will say is: If you haven't tried it, go find it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This reminded me of how complex a beer can be. I loved how it gradually transformed as it got warmer. There's plenty of flavors that kept my interest until I finished the bottle. I'm still learning to love the style but this is fantastic stuff."

"Overall, it's earned every word of it's reputation as one of the best Quads out there. It's balanced, smooth and drinkable while still allowing for complexity and depth. I think part of it's charm is the heavier carbonation; it lightens everything up. It's, without a doubt, one of the best beers I've had."
""
"This is my favorite beer. Not sure if price makes me appreciate it more but it is a fenomenal beer.  This coming from sworn ipa guy."
"Mouthfeel is also superb. Extremely smooth, with a slight dryness. Medium-thick mouth feel that actually seems to fluctuate to the lighter side on the finish, again highlighting the excellent yeast character."
"Different but an excellent ale"
""
"My first quad, though I'm no newcomer when it comes to Belgian beers.  This brew far surpasses any I've had, and may have just leaped into first place in my book.  If you're deciding between this and a cheap bottle of wine as I was, do yourself a favor and make the Belgian choice."
""
"solid Quad,  so reminiscence to Rochfert 10 almost a clone!"
"Outstanding delicious abbey style ale. Great head dis such a strong beer. Tastes amazingly smooth."
""
"Mm mm. Good. Delicious.  As good as I remember from 1995."
"I'm mostly an IPA guy but recently my palate has started to crave other things. I've had Belgian quads in the past but few and far between. I picked this up as a change of pace and I'm very glad I did.  Easy to drink and tasty. Gets better as it sits room temperature.  I went for a high rated beer right off the bat and it didn't disappoint. As someone like myself who is not seasoned in this type beer, I'm glad i choose this one. Will surely by again anytime im in the mood!"
""
"A classic quad/strong dark. Definitely rivals Rochefort and perhaps Westvleteren. Sweeter and fruiter than both of those and perhaps just a tad thinner."
"Way too much carbonation... hoping it was just the bottle i grabbed as this is my first time having it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice color and nice head on initial pour......I'm new to the quads so to me it has a fruity but very boozy smell and taste....good tho"
""
""
""
""
"Excellent one my most favorites ever!!!"
""
""
"Great quad with all of the flavors being represented."
"Awesome quad.  Deep, dark fruit Just a hint of the Belgian yeast.  Complex and delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything about this beer reminds me of raisins, dates, and figs. Even the appearance, poured with a nice head. The 10% ABV is well hidden"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown with a long lasting creamy tan head leaving soapy lacing. The aroma is rich with dark fruit and I noted specifically cherries and plums. The taste adds some caramelized sugar and alcohol esters to round out the effect. There is also a nice weight and feel to the beer."
"Overall: Full of flavor. Everything fits together perfectly. If you like Belgian beer, you should have tried this by now!"
""
""
""
"O: I have never given a perfect rating before, but in my personal opinion I feel St. Bernardus ABT 12 deserves it. This is the definition of complexity, and every time I drink it it manages to blow my mind time and time again. The sweet, dark fruit flavors along with the caramel maltiness and the yeast profile truly make this a delight. This beer almost has a wine like quality to it, it really is something special. The only negative is that it is expensive, but then again you usually have to pay for quality. However it is well worth the price tag, and it is without a doubt one of the greatest beers in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the quintessential Belgian beers...perfect balanced feel, you get some of that nice bread weight but enough carbonation to kerp it from feeling heavy...smooth dark fruit notes, mostly fig and dark apricot to me, with a little punch from the earthy Belgian yeast to give it that earthy flavor...as good of a beer as you will find in the style"
""
""
""
""
"o: a smooth, tasty, excellent quad.  very fruity, yeasty, and malty sweet, but has a superb drying quality"
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A definite favorite. Very glad I picked this up, and I'll continue to do so."

"This is the only beer that I have ever considered to be truly perfect.  I actually got chills during my first taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"great, nice reddish color, sweet fruity aroma, pleasant fruit flavor but dry, clean"
""
"Overall: Excellent. Great taste profile, looks great, smells great. Becoming one of my favorite styles."
""
""
"V - Single corked bomber bottle. Medium value."
""
""
""
"Just wasn't what I was hoping for.  Quadrupels are few and this one is, albiet masterfully created, not even close to the best."
""
""
""
"Nice looking reddish copper color. Nose is nothing fantastic for such a highly rated beer, but I pick out lots of cherry with raisons, figs, and dark fruits. Taste is more fruit balanced nicely by toasted malt and some caramel. Alchohol presence is just right, and the smooth mouth feel makes it really enjoyable to drink."

"Incredible beer and excellent BDSA."
""
"Overall: three distinct, strong elements combine for an amazing experience - rich, sweet malt and fruit flavour, sensuous mouthfeel, and invigorating burn; have this by the fire with dessert"
""
""
""
"Overall, a sensational beer! Don't drink it cold, though!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink at about 54ish degrees or higher. If too cold, you miss out on so much flavor"
"Hard for me to rate these types of beers but a little to carbonated for my liking"

"12oz bottle pours brown with significant tan head. Probably the smoothest Quad I've ever tasted; will be buying more and excited to see how age plays a factor."
""
""
"The standard for a Quad. Begin here!"
""
""
"Had this side by side in a blind taste test with 5 other high end quads. As in any blind test scores were given before beer was revealed. I was very surprised I scored this so low, but it was the worst one I had that night. Another taste may be required."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark red-brown with two fingers thick of fluffy yet fizzy light brown head, settles slowly to a thin cap, ring of lace trailing the liquid but not much sticking. Smell: raisin, dates, toasted brown bread, cola note, caramel, lightly floral and spicy. Taste: caramel, cherry cola, fig, spicy and slightly boozy, finishing with notes of clove, pepper and toasted grain. Carbonation is a bit high, but based on the sugariness it's probably the right amount for this beer. This is delicious and available everywhere, which is impressive, but it's a rung down from the best Belgian quads (it's not Pannepot, but who is!)"
""
""
"This ale is truly amazing!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer and worthy of the hype."
"Pours a dark burnt-orange in color with a good 1-finger off white head that settles to about 2mm during the drink. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped and also there was sediment in the bottom of the bottle after the last pour also. Lots going on with the aroma as there is sweet caramel malts with a hint of dark fruits with some spices. Even more going on with the taste as it is hard to figure out what is in here. Very smooth and creamy as this is a 'sipping brew' and it took be a good hour+ to finish it. Medium+-heavy bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. This brew actually is better when left out for a while instead of ice cold for sure."
"awesome beer. The standard for Belgian Strong ales."

"A/a golden hazy brew in a chalice was placed in front of me looking very appealing.  S/A mixture of floral scents, maybe raisin, I think sugar, dough notes with a faint smell of hops. T/The first taste to hit me was the floral notes that was present in the smell followed by a bread taste with a hint of sweetness.  M/Good amount of carbonation and very light beer. O/This being my first ""true quad"" and not being very versed in this style of brew I found it very enjoying.  My only dislike was the amount of floral notes in the taste but it was not too distracting.  I found this light, crisp, beer very drinkable.  I am happy to have had this and would probably order this again in the warmer months."

"Hands down, the best beer I've ever had. It's the gold standard by which other beers should be measured...acknowledging, of course, that each beer needs to be appreciated and rated in the context of its style. St Bernardus 12 is the definitive 5.0 amongst Quads, with Rochefort 10 coming in a close second."
""
""
""
"Hard to imagine a better example of the style. Malty without being cloying, absolutely outstanding  phenols from the yeast, and just the right amount of roast in the malt. Not much more to say - just can't believe that one of the very best gustatory experiences available costs less than a mediocre bottle of wine."
""
"O 4.25: As one of the mainstays for the style I expected a lot from this beer and for the most part it delivered. This bottle has about a year and a half on it from what I can tell and I am interested to see how it will hold up after some more time, and would love to try it fresh as well though I know that this may be a pipe dream. I think the only thing that holds this beer back is the lingering burnt sugar flavor. Not that it is unpleasant but a touch of sweetness would in my opinion add another wonderful dimension."
""
""
"I've had this beer several times in the past, rated it, finally getting around to reviewing it. Popped the cork and wasn't paying close attention, next thing I knew, great smelling beer was all over my counter. Shared with my wife and son, poured into a Belgian style glass. The color was a deep mahogany, with just a bit of opacity. Kicked up a nice head that faded pretty quickly into a thin film. Very little lacing down the glass. The smell was nice, with some dark fruit smells, lots of sweet malty aromas and just a touch of sweet caramel and cherry notes. The taste is absolutely phenomenal, with huge dark fruit and candy sugar flavors up front. Lots of different flavors on the back end, with a bit of toffee, caramel, fresh baked bread, pepper and raisins. The mouthfeel is luxurious, rolling so smoothly over the tongue, no alcohol bite, and just the right amount of carbonation bite. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers of all time, when one considers the price and availability, it's gotta be pretty high on everyone's list of the greatest beers out there!"
""
"Bottle. Pours a surprisingly dark brown with a three finger head that persists. The nose is malty and fruity and the taste follows. Smooth with rich flavour.Perfectly representing the Belgian style. Refreshing beer but has so much depth it takes a while to enjoy. World class."
""
"Glass- Goblet"
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice Belgian quad that is just too subdued.  Not enough esters to really help out with the background that is incredibly dry and lacks any alcoholic heat. Some fruitiness, but less than I would have liked. Well made in that regard, but I want a bit more from a quad in terms of depth of flavour.  Maybe some age on this will do it good..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a lovely and creamy thick off white head. The head dissipates to a thin lace that retains on the sides of the glass and in patches in the middle. Aroma is mostly malty sweet, syrupy, with some fruity overtones. Heavenly taste and feel! Oh so malty sweet! Fruity; like figs and wine like grapes. Bready and nutty. A slightly dry finish. So much complexity and nuance to this taste! High alcoholic content but not boozy. I drink beer for the taste and the buzz; and this one offers both in spades! Feel is a lively carbonation, full bodied, robust, but oh so drinkable! It is refreshing and hearty at the same time. What a beer! These Trappist monks are/were geniuses!! One of the best!!!!"

"Not as good as Rochefort 10.  The alcohol is a bit cloying."
""
""
"O - As I continue to drink I notice more and more the wonderfully malty flavor and aroma. The balance of dark fruits/spiciness/light booziness/rich malt create a ton of complexity."

"Bottle review, the first time I ever had this was on tap and I loved it. Aroma is dark fruits, plums, raisins, and little booze as it warms, very malty. Pours a rich deep brown mahogany color with a beige head that faded quickly. It's highly carbonated and quite prickly on the palate with a full body. Taste was chocolate, herbal, earthy, spicy, brown sugar, plum, raisin, pomegranate and raspberry. A great beer, just not as great as I remembered."

"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into large tulip glass.  A slightly hazy dark brown with 1 inch off-white head.  Aroma of dried fruit, brown sugar, vanilla, spice.  Taste follows with dried fruit, caramel, and some sparkling white wine-type of flavors.  Nice light body for the ABV and perfectly carbonated.  An awesome quad!"

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, best before 6/1/2017. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, and reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly slick/creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Quadrupel style. All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering as expected."

"Overall (4.5): Being my first quadrupel i never really knew what to expect, but i can see why this is so highly rated. I actually found the nose more pleasing than the taste with the latter having a more pronounced tart port wine like character that i have some getting used to. The finish and aftertaste definitely has a spiced floral note with a good amount of bitterness. I dont know if its the yeast or what, but something about this beer reminds me of Samuel Smith. This beer has definitely done a good job of broadening my palate and i'm looking forward to trying more quads in the future."

"Belgian quad, spice is apparent, very malty, but balanced with subtle bitterness."
"Creamy, rich, chewy, with lots of raisins, dates, dried figs and fresh baked bread. Plums and subtle pie spices are also floating around in there. Very complex, lots of contemplate. It pontificates its way across your pallet toward your stomach.  Smooth, luscious, sublime!,"
""
""
"Pours a thick purple brown with quite a big head. Three fingers! The nose is very sweet. Hard candy, figs, raisins, apricots, and a slightly sour cherry note.   The flavor is earthy figs. Sweet malt. This is a very good beer. Hides that 10% very well."

"750 ml bottle.  Pours brown with foamy, long lasting, off-white head.  Aroma is of Belgian yeast, piney hops, dark fruit, brown sugar and some port and bread crust.  Body is full and smooth.  Plums, yeast, good amount of spicy hops, bready and caramel malt fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  Delicious, complex brew."

"Poured from a bottle. Dark tan in color with a big fluffy white head. Smell is yeast, bread, and sweet. Very very tasty. Sweet, yet not to much. Good amount of bitterness. This beer is excellent. One of the best beers I've had. Also, I poured it at around 60 degrees. Had one cold and it lost a lot of flavor and aroma from that."

"A nose of rich, dark dried fruits and chewy figs and dates.  Smooth and complex, the taste is moist dried cherries, plums, and raisins balanced against rich malts and a touch of sugar.  Yeasty and well-carbonated, with plenty of sediment that needs a gentle rolling before opening.  The ABV is completely hidden within the beer.  Dark and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong carbonation like other quads. Overall one of my favorite beers."
""
""
"With no question, one of my favorite beers.  I consider this a gold standard Belgium quadruple... one of the smoothest 10% beers I've had.  You'll have to dish out a little more cash but it's definitely worth it.  Enjoy!"

"New to reviewing, but not to consuming.  Was really looking forward to tasting this based on reviews and friend's recommendations.  Maybe it was the alcohol content; maybe the yeast, maybe the tight carbonation...but something ran roughshod over the flavor.  I don't know if a beer can be 'strident,' but drinking this reminded me of a high-pitched nag.  I'm drinking it cold, so I'll see what happens when I let it warm a bit, maybe the vaunted flavor will show through then."

"Very nice beer. The appearance is a hazy golden with a nice head. The smell is full of bananas and wheat with some herbs too. The taste was amazing. Full flavors of Belgian wheat and the hops make a very well balanced, delicious beer. The mouthfeel also has a very nice consistency and seems to linger just long enough. Loved it."
"The only thing keeping it from perfect in my rating is probably related to my ego."
"T: Lots of fruit. Raisin, fig, banana. Good Belgian yeast finish. Just the right amount of doughiness to pair well with the sweetness. This beer is like a liquid liege Belgian waffle, just like the one they serve at Brewery Ommegang. Sweet confectioners sugar brittle and caramel taste. Slightly bitter chocolate syrup on top."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; This is a beast of a Belgian. The alcohol is very strong, which somehow is not off putting but complimentary to the beer, it's not something i would drink every day, but would wait for a moment where i want a beer that will be rich and satisfying on all levels. sip slowly and enjoy."

"O: Another fine Belgian. Not quite as good as the Trappistes beers, specifically the Rochefort 10, but nonetheless an excellent beer. I enjoyed the malty body and tinges of cherry candy in the finish. Nice color, a bit more sediment than I was expecting (got a little in my glass, oops!)."

"It is a crappy version of a Westvleteren -- that is what I think. While the Westy is complex and buoyant, the St. Bernardus 12 is like a Westy you left a piece of tree bark in overnight. The St. Bernardus 12 is somehow thinner and more bitter. Acrid might be a better word than bitter. St. Bernardus 12 has an unpleasant sharpness to it (whatever the medicinal qualities of its high abv) like waking in the morning to find you have an unsheathed razor blade in your mouth. The only way to mitigate the sort of acrid unfriendliness is to chill it to at least the recommended temperature -- and probably lower. The Westy I drink and feel I am encountering something higher, greater than myself. The St. Bernardus 12 is like its failed, slightly mean-spirited brother."

"My only issue with this one is the amount of carbonation. I think it distracted from the great flavors swimming around. Pours with a large head of thick foam. A fair amount of malt and chocolatey goodness in the aroma. Taste brought on a bunch of dark stone fruit with a fair amount of booziness, great balance! Finishes with an interesting earthiness that reminds me of the Orval, it's something reminiscent of freshly foraged mushrooms."

"Less impressive than other high-level quads. Flavors of dark fruits, caramel, biscuit and apple, but mostly overwhelmed by the carbonation. The head was bubbly, and the mouthfeel was strangely effervescent. Flavors blend moderately well. I would have enjoyed this more if I could focus on the flavors over the distracting carbonation."

"330 ml bottle poured into a goblet. Initial pour yielded a massive amount of creamy beige foam, which will eventually settle into a murky yeasty light cola brown colored liquid with a rich buttery aroma of dried dark fruits (dates, figs, raisins), cocoa powder, faint red berries, toffee, and an earthy tobacco-like note that also shows up on the palate. This is another fairly legendary Belgian and certainly the taste stands up well to intense scrutiny. Rich, dark, sweet, and a little roasty, with a warming but not overpowering alcohol presence and tons of dark fruit and woody, earthy notes yet quite drinkable just the same. Dark chocolate cake and dates yield to some medicinal licorice or anise notes at the back end, along with some spicier potpourri-style cinnamon and nutmeg. Moderate body (not super thick) and a similar mid-range degree of carbonation do not surprise me, although the finish is VERY interesting ... Almost a barrel-aged coconut/sulfur note that lingers and lingers along with faint gooseberry-like hops. The candy bar sweetness becomes more pronounced as the roasted bitterness subsides and I am digging the evolving complexity after the initial blast of chocolate, yeast, and booze. Supposedly this is the same basic recipe as Westvleteren 12 and I am eager to do the comparison (soon). In the meantime, the last few drops are going down and I am feeling little pain. I might go on record and say that I prefer Rochefort 10 but that's no real insult. This manages to sustain a solid runner-up position."

""
""
""

""

"Reminds me very much of Aventinus Tap 6, or even the Eisbock, in both color and taste. Dislike the intense amounts of carbonation. Very fruity flavor profile, apples, bananas, some dark fruit. Finishes with delicious caramel. Coats the mouth with bubbles, and I feel slightly overwhelmed by the amount of carbonation."
""
"B"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a deep brown with some head retention and fine lacing. Inviting aromas of raisin, dark fruit, apple, molasses and sweet caramel. Taste is fruity with raisin, cherry and fig, lighter in body overall and a tad sweeter than Rochefort 10 and Westy 12. Slightly spicy and peppery in the finish with some clove. Has the typical perfumy alcohol and the booziness typical of quads but again is lighter than the Roch or Westy. Slightly oily mouthfeel with active, creamy carbonation. Overall, it competes with the best as far as quads are concerned. Not as bold as the others but just as good. I'd really like to taste an older bottle to see if the sherry-like flavors from oxidation improve the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though this beer is not boozy, it works its way silently. After a few sips, this beer will get you. The sweetness of this ale lingers. It is a light beer, and the carbonation is not even there. Good beer."
""
""
"A fabulous and classic representative of the Belgian Quad style. If you've yet to sample some, find some and do so. Drinking a glass of this is an education, and a lesson that a good beer advocate would take seriously. Well-prepared meat dishes of a variety of sorts work well, but probably best with a stew. Also, cheese! Please, eat soft, ripe cheese and she'll thank you more than once."

"Overall, a wonderful beer, and while I'd choose Westy if all else was equal, the simple truth is that this one is much, much easier to obtain. Given that, it's more than an acceptable substitute--the difference in difficulty obtaining Westy 12 is not inversely proportional to the difference in the experience of drinking it."

"A joy to drink. Reminds me how good it is to be alive."
"Overall - This beer is one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of reviewing. From the full and fluffy head, all the way down to the last drop, the Abt 12 is astounding. This beer has more than earned it's place on BA's Top Beers on Planet Earth list, and it has definitely earned it's place on my shelves. Very highly recommended paired with food, friends, or even just to sip on."

"Overall - Maybe the best Belgian Dub/Trip/Quad I've had, but I'm still not sold on the style. Too much sugary sweetness and alcohol undertone for my liking. Probably a can't miss for quad fans. Me, I'll try to stick to Goldens and Strong Pales when it comes to enjoying Belgian style brews."

"The pour that I'm reviewing now is from draft. It pours a muddy ruby color with a 2 1/2-finger pillow of moussy head. The nose brings clean and sweet bread malts, plum skin, cherry, wild earthy yeast, brown sugar, and caramel. It tastes rich and sweet in its malty goodness with dark fruit esters, especially plum and raisin, playing a huge role. There's also a toasted oat/nutty character to the beer, some coriander and other spices from the yeast, and big bread flavor on the finish. It has the perfect carbonation to pry open the taste buds without overdoing it, and a medium body that hides the alcohol well."

"Bernie's #12 is one of my ""desert island"" beers. Love it! Smell has hints of figs and raisins. Pours dark and rich with a thick head. Taste is amazing with an after taste that lasts all day long.

"Final Grade: 4.64, a superb A+ grade. St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a true classic - a full-flavoured, satisfying quadrupel with no serious flaws for me to gripe about. I haven't had nearly enough quads to suggest where this one might rank on a relative scale, but I can't deny that this is one of the best Belgian-style dark ales I've ever had the opportunity to try. A great deal at its ON price-point - I'm hoping that this one will become a regular listing, but just in case it doesn't I'll probably snag another bottle for the cellar. A must-try."

"I was excited for this beer. After popping the cork I smelled a rich smell of bread and malt. I could tell this was going to be a big beer. Like a meal in a bottle. I wasn't disappointed. Just like the others who reviewed this beer I was treated to a nice lacy head. I enjoyed this in a 1 liter glass beer stein so I could enjoy the opaque tea like color. The beer showed lots of suspended yeast. It was everything I expected and just made me wish I could plan a trip to Belgium."

"Overall: As you begin having this beer at a colder temperature, allow as much as you'd like to have it at the temperature it should be had at, 60-65 degrees. Once it started climbing towards the warm side, the flavors became ridiculous. It becomes soft, velvety, rich, almost milky. I wonder if it gets any better than this one."

"Poured from a bottle with a hazy brown color and a thick, foamy off-white head. Has a subtle fruit aroma, perhaps too subtle, but that’s the only fault I can find with the beer. Has a sweet dark fruit flavor and no hint of the 10.5% alcohol. Feels smooth and has a nice full body. St. Bernardus, I would say, is heavenly ."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a bubbly milk chocolate head that dissipates quickly. Very little lacing. Smells of dark fruits, tobacco, bread and malt. Plum, raisin, malt and caramel taste. Alcohol is very pronounced. Medium mouth with a fair amount of carbonation. I prefer the Rochefort 10 by a slight margin, but this is an excellent quad."

"Com certeza um dos grandes rótulos não trapistas da Bélgica. Levo em consideração duas maneiras de degustá-la. Na garrafa ela possui um sabor mais forte e marcante. Na pressão ela é mais aromática e equilibrada, não há defeitos, não sinto que tenha o que criticar ou apontar como não cumprido. Um rótulo sensacional."

"The finish is sweet and warming and by the time you finish this glass the alcohol is sweet not sharp. It has won you over with flavors that surrounded it. The fruit danced on the palate, the malt richness was cake like and light. The spice intriguing. I will have another even though I said I wouldn't at first."

"A gloomy, dark amber body, thick foam, retention great but would have expected more lacing. Aroma has pears, figs and brown sugar. Flavor is rich, candied fruit, warming plums. Carbonation is spot on and not overdone like some Belgian ales are. Glad i can get this locally."

"Super hyped up beer here. Expecting a mouth oragasim. Looks nice and dark. Smells like toffee, coffee, and vanilla. Super carbonated. I like that, but no so much in this style. I like high carbonation in a saison, but weird here. Abv well hidden. Not to complex. Kinda disappointed. Oh well, back to IPA's."

"Overall (4.75/5) AKA TL/DR: This is an incredible beer and an easy pick for my favorite Quadruple of all time. The craftsmanship on display is unparalleled. A well-balanced, decadent yet classy, Belgian ale featuring bold flavors of dark stone fruits and toffee and a mildly spicy Belgian yeast profile."

"Overall: This Quadruple is not as hot as most of the others that you have been used to. It goes more along the lines of a triple or even a dubbel. It goes down easy, but still lets you know it is there- especially when you stand up from 25 ounces of the stuff! This is the tastiest Belgian Quad and very akin to Gulden Draak 9000 Quad- as it goes down easy but it is amazingly complex and the heat is masterfully masked. It goes down SO easy despite the heaviness and complexity: watch out! This is a serious beer and one of the World's best. Since I am a Belgian lover, there is nothing better than a Quad that masks itself down a little. This will always be one of my favorite beers and is endlessly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I can see why this is one of the best quads in the world. It's within-style, perfectly balanced, and amazingly well-made. Great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium heavy body with a nice mouthfeel. Little hop presence to balance the alcohol, but balance is achieved via a nice rich malty taste and mouthfeel. The finish is slightly alcoholic, but pleasant. Overall, an outstanding beer for the high 10.0% alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the kind of beer that you don't appreciate until you're drinking a beer that's trying to be it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"ABV is no joke! as strong a 10% as I've come across ... a bomber of this is a full session."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious esters, but wish the carbonation were a touch lower to allow the flavor to sink in. It's a bit hot, but would age well. Dangerously drinkable for the abv. As it warms, the flavor just becomes increasingly luscious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Not #32 on the BA top 250 list for nothing! Very easy drinking despite its high ABV and solid mouthfeel. Tasty without being bitter. Just fruity enough to give it character. Best quad I have had."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent with a good strong cheese (I've tried it with a Herve cheese), I advice to drink this one cold and temperate because both are quite different"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I dont drink a lot of quads so I am not really appealed by the funky taste, but I do understand that this is a highly regarded beer and a true Belgian, so I would suggest to give it a try. Im sure after a few more sips and enough time for the beer to warm up, it could be more enjoyable or I will be just to buzzed to care!"
""
""
""
""
"I would drink this everyday, but,--like eating chocolate for dinner-- only refrain so as to retain its superiority by experiencing other lesser examples of the genre. I'm still looking for a better Belgian but I haven't found one yet."

""
""
""

"Really, it smells like red wine. It has a dark red/brown color like a red wine. It has a little bit of fine dark particulate matter in it like you might find in a wine bottle. I drink it and it tastes more or less like a dry red wine. No hop character and no malt character. All its flavor is yeast derived. Carbonation is not very strong. Alcohol is WAY strong. Pretty good wine overall."
""
"O- A very yummy and complex beer and one of the best if not the best Quads I've had. Not overly sweet or yeasty and doesn't sit heavy on they tongue. This is one of the best easily available Belgian beers you will find. If you been passing this one over for a time like I did, wait no longer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I would rate this second only to Corsendonk Pater Abbey Brown Ale. Otherwise, it's a superb beer with complex flavors that remind me of figs or raisins which are followed by a fruity/bitter aftertaste that quickly reduces to a subtle sweetness left behind. I enjoyed it, thoroughly. Also, you have to pose like the monk on the bottle while you drink it. Otherwise, you're not getting the full experience."

"Mouthfeel - This is one of those things that doesn't get talked about enough, and maybe for good reason....it isn't normally very interesting. But this isn't a normal beer. The body if medium, carbonation is high...finish is...unique as it's neither crisp and dry nor smooth. It just is. The beer itself is rough on the tongue, in a pleasant sort of way..kinda grainy. I could swish this around in my mouth for days."
""
""

""
""
"O- A delightful sipping quad. Well-balanced, big fruit flavor, and a strong finish. I'd love to try this fresh one next to others that have been cellared."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Complex, boozy and incredibly balanced. This brew is well deserving of its reputation. This beer is an indulgence, an excellent all night sipper or night cap, and quite possible the best beer I've had. A classic that I'll go back to again, and again!."

"So I am definitely not experienced enough to give this beer a proper review. My big brother had received this as a gift, and so we cracked it open together. I thought I was well versed in beer until I tried this one. I was blown away by the complexity of this brew. I have no idea how they make this, but it must be magic. Few beers have blown me away, and this one humbled me greatly. I know I will come back to it and try to review it in the future. I just know that at this point in my beer adventure I need more time to develop my tastes before I can make a solid opinion."

"Overall: This is the second time I've tried this beer. The first time, I was blown away. This time around, I felt like I didn't rember the carbonation being so strong, the finish being so dry, or the alcohol being so obvious. Will have to try again."
""

"Overall: Had back to back with a Westvleteren 12, so similar yet this one is a little less sweet, and the dark fruit notes are a little less overripe, and a little less sweet. Very similar but hype aside, i prefer the mythical Westvleteren 12 by a hair. I currently habe both cellaring so I will review both again in about a years time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Excellent."
"O - This beer improves significantly as it warms. I took it out of the fridge maybe 20 minutes before drinking, and it should have been longer, although I was fortunate to see how the flavors changed. The other thing is the alcohol. I had about 2/3 of a bottle and I really feel it. This is a really nice beer to split, probably after dinner. Didn't go great with our grilled salmon."

"Wow! Where do I begin! This beer is wonderful. As I just finished the bottle. Beautiful head, and color. Amber to medium dark in color. I do like the Rochefort 10 as well. I would say that they are neck and neck. Can't really choose between the two I like them so much. This a great quad. Great flavor on the tongue, and leaves hardly no after taste except a wonderful sensation on my tongue and throat. These monks can brew some mean beer! I am hooked."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this so much better than Westy 12. The fruitiness just seems to pop more witht the carbonation in this. The fact that it is so much more widely available is a big plus. This is the epitome of the Belgian style and all other Belgians should just bow down now. Just a perfectly balanced taste."

"Definitely better over time. I do really enjoy this beer. It is not something I always grab when I am out shopping, just because it is a beer I know I can get any where I want. That however does not mean it is a bad beer, in fact that is a good sign. Its dark color is not intimidating as it has some really nice fruit flavors that Belgians like to give off. I really recommend this beer to anyone but watch out how many there is a lot of booze in these puppies."

"O: If I was a condemned man and got to choose my last meal, this might well be it. There is so much going on in this beer that I think I could drink it over and over and never figure it out completely.

""
""
""
""
"Dark reddish brown pour with loose white head. Complex belgian beer fruit aromas (ripe sugarey red fruits, cherry, raspberries, blackberries), alcohol, chocolate and a bit of yeastiness. Taste is quite boozy and fruity but very well balanced. Beautiful mouthfeel no wateriness here."
""
""

"o: Fantastic. This is the first beer I've had that I truly feel is perfectly balanced. Highly recommended to anyone who likes beer. I'll definitely treat myself to this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Picking off anything other than dried fruits and alcohol at both nose and tongue feels like an incredibly ambitious task. Even after consecutive frustrated aerations, the beer is left unchanged to my perception; Which is fine. It isn't a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not the world-beater so many profess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is balanced fig, earthy, no alcohol, mellow, lighter flavors come out as it warms, clove/gum, Belgium Yeast and Candi Sugar, almost a hint of pepper, fuller taste later on, but still very drinkable. Best of the four."
""
""
""
""
""
"I got this beer for a few reasons. First, I've heard insanely good things about it. Second, I had never tasted a quad (to my knowledge) before. Third, and most college-boy esque of me, it had a pretty high ABV and I didn't think it would hurt to get a little buzz going on. Turns out, this may've been my favorite beer from the night. I don't tend to drink imported beer (local jobs, yadayadayada), but this is impressive. It's not cheap, by any means, but this is something worth treating yourself to, time-to-time. This really makes me want to try beers like Rochefort and Westvleteren now... my interest has officially been piqued."

"To be honest, this isn't my favorite Quad that I've ever had, but it was good. Very thick, with a rich character and flavor. My only complaint was that it lacked the complexity I prefer in beers. Not as many undertones of other flavors other than the essence of strong beer"

"Yes, this was strong but it never tasted it and I could have easily downed a few of these over a given night. There's a reason why beers like this are rated so high - anything balanced this well, smooth, and is strong without being overt is the hallmark of a great brew and this fit that bill. I'm always amazed at how much Belgian beers have to offer and how something like this is so highly rated by so many. Even on a muggy night like tonight, this was refreshing and anyone who reviews beers on here needs to get their hands on this and find out for his or herself why this is one of the classics. Highly recommended."

"Poured from a small 11.2 ounce capped bottle. A deep burgundy color with a thin cap thick with bubbles. The smell is in hand with the taste. Dark fruit, plums, dried cherries, figs, a hint of leather, and some deep rich bready malts. All flavors come together so nicely and balanced. A real work of art. Mouthfeel is stunning. Smooth and thick, but not overly rich. Overall an outstanding example, one that I think exemplifies the style."

"Overall a great Quad with everything I like about good Belgian beers and nothing I don't. Personally I think it better slightly colder (high 40s to low 50s) as its slightly more harsh at higher temps but a world class beer that is incredibly balanced without being overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, excellent. As mentioned, this is one of the quads I base opinion of others off of just because it is so solid. The others I hold at top notch right now would have to be La Trappe and Straffe Hendrik."

""
"In general a damn fine beer. Not completely my style but fantastic nonetheless. I think that it would be a really great beer for a cold winter night or to cellar for a while. Really tastes like ""Fall"". Nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, raisins, booze. It's a delicious beer. A lot more drinkable than I would have thought. Truly worth finding and trying."

"OVERALL: St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is truly a work of art, however from my experience, I found this quadruple to be far too sweet to handle. As discussed in my group, we could all enjoy and appreciate the deep aroma, the rich taste, and the heavenly appearance of this magnificent creation, but actually moving forward beyond five or six sips just became too much of a task. This is a thinkers beer and one that was created with much love and quality, but the sweetness is just too close to a confection and that's not really very pleasant."
""
"Overall - There is a reason this beer is so high on the Beers of Fame. It is excellence, defined. There aren't many out there I would put over it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- My favorite abbey ale hands down. If you like abbey ales and trippels and haven't tried this, you're missing out. I like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: one of the few quads that's left me itching for more. At 10%, it's not that sessionable, but I will definitely get a hold of more when I get the chance. Great quad ale."

"O- Very good beer, very complex, the different dark fruits makes it really good, little sweetness, roasted malts, very easy drinking and good balance"
"A: Head dropped quick quickly, deep rust to dark brown in color, looks a little flaccid – 3.75, S: Nose is dry and chalky with a candied pineapple aroma, some dry cherries and faint figs, subtle sweetness from some fragrant malts and minor sourdough bread – 4.25, T: Extremely dry and with medium alcohol burn, significant candied sugar which provides defined sweetness, prunes, figs and cloves, touch of carob, lots going on in this beer – 4.50, M: Medium mouthfeel with a dry effervescence, sharp tongue – 4.00, D: Very complex, extremely drinkable for a 10% beer - 4.25"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A few other thoughts: Instead of finishing with a lingering sweetness, this finishes with a little bit of the 10% ABV, and paired with a very prickly carbonation, it balances out into a pretty much perfect beer that works alone and would also pair brilliantly with food."

"Overall: An absolute treat for quadruppel aficionados or even those who are mildly interested in delving deeper into the Belgian beer scene. St. Bernardus serves as a brilliant winter warmer on those cold nights with its robust taste and glowing warmth. I would actively seek this out again, for having just one of these would be akin to the highest of sins and would probably result in me being tried in front of some Benedictine court for my gross blasphemy. Oh well - at least they'd have good beer for me there."

"O: A solid quad that is widely available, but I personally think the Rochefort 10 is better."
""
""
""
"O: This is a superior example of a quad. In the same wheelhouse as Rochefort 10, it has a great flavour and body. This just confirms to me my preference for abbey beers. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who wants an example of a quad."

"Huge head...and who does not like head! Color is rather non-descript. Lools like a root beer gone bad. But I can safely say, I've never drank a beer or not drank a beer based on appearance. Smell is more alcoholic than most beers with little other smell. Again, I've never enjoyed or not enjoyed a beer based on smell. Now time to taste it...the true test. Exactly what you would expect from a trappiste beer. Makes you think, what the heck am I tasting! Can't say I enjoy this trappiste offering as much as Westvleteran or Rochefort but has a complexity that makes you think while you drink. Is it the tastiest beer? No, not really. But is it enjoyable? Absolutely. Overpriced for what you get. Maybe with a nice piece of beef it would really shine but on its own, doesn't really stand up to the other trappiste offerings. Oh well, at least its helping me get drunk!"

"Dark ruby-brown color, caught me off guard a little mainly because I was going through the pre-drinking picture-taking motions. Caramel and figs and raisins, enjoyable aroma. Excellent flavors and an exceptionally creamy texture. Figs and raisins and cherries, nice depth and richness while also letting you know they've been sipping the 10% alcohol. Molasses, caramel and brown sugar add more interest, this time a bit sweet."

"Probably my most favorite beer if not the best beer I have ever had as of now. Didn't exactly fall in love with it the first time, but after a few times it just kinda grabbed a hold of me and never let go. Definitely one of the best Belgian's I've ever had."

"O: i love quads. this is one of the best. lots of character. sweet and comforting."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: While it does not quite match the complexity and overall drinkability of Rochefort 10, this is still a delicious and widely available example of a Belgian quad. The plus is that this beer is available in larger, more sharable quantities, whereas Rochefort is only found in 11.2 oz bottles. There is really nothing more to say other than this does the quad style damn near to perfection. Nothing more, nothing less. 18.5/20"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- There just wasn't enough flavor. It smelled a lot sweeter than it tasted and I think it could have used a bit more sweetness to balance the alcohol burn. Still a great beer, true to the style."

"This beer takes me to a small countryside castle. The appearance is dark brown, with light/medium foam which vanishes in a short time, leaving only what is to be remembered as a great belgian beer. The taste is comparable to other highly rated quads i.e. Trappistes Rochefort 10 but imo; surpasses its classmate by a wide margin. I would highly recommend this beer to the individual partial to a strong belgian delight."
""
""

"Overall- A very nice beer which is changing my opinion about Westy 12, for the better. I would give this beer an A- to A with Westy 12 moving between B+ to A+ depending on potential. This is great for the price. At 10 %, you're pretty much getting 4 beers for 12 bucks. Not bad at all. It is definitely more accessible than Westy 12."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's an Amazing beer, sweet but not cloying, light bitterness but without harshness, very smooth for a high alcohol beer, the alcohol hides very well, The flavors muddle together in a perfect balance without one over powering the other, Dark fruits take hold as the slight bitterness pushes back with maybe some lighter fruits popping through, old wood seems to be in there too. But everything layers over each other and gives it a great quality. Reminds me of an old plum tree."

"Overall Impression: World Class ale, stays true to Quad style but reaches higher than most when it comes to overall complexity of taste and inviting aroma. As soon as I cracked the top off the bottle, the complex aroma hit me. Truly a joy to sift through the many flavors and depth of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What an enjoyable beer to consume. The complexity is out of this world, I know there are notes that I'm missing and I will add them next time I drink one. For being a 10% quad, this beer is extremely drinkable."

"Abt 12 in the bottle is malty Belgian Perfection. Abt 12 on Tap is better. Yeah...That may sound implausible, but it's not. Hold it. Savor it. Understand that it's your lucky day."

"It was $11.99 for a fifth, but, like Macallan 25 (which is generally in the ~$750 for a fifth), if this was $50+ a fifth, it would still be worth it to taste, even if too expensive to drink regularly."
"One of the best Belgian beers on the market in the US. A true classic. I will always hold this beer dear in my heart due to the memories associated with drinking it."
""
""
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. It has a very inviting aroma of malts and yeast. The taste is rather amazing and easy to see why this is considered one of the best beers in the world. The texture is well carbonated as wheat, spices, and yeast tickles your taste buds. Quite filling and very well made, as if I would expect anything less from Belgium."

"O – This is one of the best beers that I have ever had and surely one of the best beers on the face of the earth. I have been told that is beer is a near duplication of the legendary Trappist Westvleteren 12 (which I have never had). Copy or no, I'm heading back to Wegman's to get another bottle of Abt 12 right now."

""
""
""
""

"O: A great beer, very complex with flavors bouncing all over the place with nothing really taking the leading role, everything works perfectly together from the big bready malt flavors to the alcohol and hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow... Wow, wow, wow. People weren't lying. The Abt 12 really is ridiculously similar to the Westy 12. When all is said and done, I don't think I could tell the difference if I was blindfolded. You could hand me an Abt 12 in a blank glass, tell me it was Westy XII, and I wouldn't be able to argue. That being said, they are both fantastic beers - pinnacles in brewing, and quintessential beers for the style they both represent. At the end of the day, I must give a slight nudge to the Abt 12 though, given it's relatively low price point and incredible availability."

""
"O: Quads are really a love/hate beer for me... long story... but this is a very well made beer. There are others in the style that I prefer more, but this is solid. I don't know if I'll ever seek this out again, but I do appreciate it for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: just a terrific brew all the way around. extremely well balanced for its big complexity. I thought this was underwhelming a couple years ago when I last had this, but man, I am really am enjoying this brew now.

"O: Overall it was enjoyable to drink, mostly because the flavors blended together nicely and it was not too strong of a beer, despite the 10% ABV. I would have liked more complexity to the flavors, but I would not sacrifice the overall experience if it meant complicating the flavor. Don't expect a lot of fruit, with the exception of banana."
"This is easily the best beer I've ever had. I would probably go in debt to stock up on this if I had the proper storage setup. I feel like I should be wearing monk's robes when drinking it."

"I feel like repeating a previous reviewer snaotheus, why haven't I reviewed this beer before, it is a close to perfect brew. The color is majestic ruby red, the smell is elegant, the taste is sublime, clean and deeply flavorful, but balanced. High ABV but totally hidden, just a slight wisp of the finest malt used to perfection to create this quad. I have spent a while trying to find something wrong with this beer, so far I come up empty, it is a super fine abbey ale."

"O: At the time I had this, this was probably the best beer I had ever tried, but I've since had a few hundred more beers, and this sits very near to my top ten. It's my favorite quad, though I've neither tried aged Rochefort 10 (something I will do come Christmas) nor Westy XII. I have had Rochefort 10 that hadn't been aged, Pannepot, La Trappe, Ommegang Three Philosophers, Ovila Quad, La Trappe batch 7 (Scotch, I think), Avery's the reverend, Gulden Draak Batch 9000, and Bourbon Barrel Monk's Brew. This is still my favorite."
""
""
"To tell you the truth I was expecting an abundance of carbonation such as in a Duvel or Gulden Draak but wasn't as much. It was still sufficient compared to american belgians. It recommends 52-56 degress which I had this chilling at in my wine fridge. Beautiful bouqet of dark fruit. Rasins, plum in addition to traditional malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review 200, 330ml bottle poured into Leffe chalice. Dark auburn colour, 90% opaque, one finger tanned head, decent retention, fair amount of lacing. Aroma was musty grape and booze. Tasted rasin, plum, fig, fudge, molasses, and brown sugar. Quite boozy compared to Rochefort 10. Finish was slightly biscuity and boozy. Well carbonated, light body, smooth but had a slightly coarse edge from the booze. Seemed to mellow as it warmed, got less boozy and the carbonation dropped off slightly. A very good beer rather than a great one, places below Rochefort 10."

"This is a true master piece. It isn't a beer I'll drive an hour and a half for again nor one that would be a regular in my rotation, but imagine any real beer drinker not enjoying this one. I really don't generally think much of the Belgian styles, but this beer has found a way to both give the full flavor of a quad without going over the top with spice or sugar."

"O - A brilliant quad. If there was only one beer I could drink for the rest of my life, this might be my pick."
""
""
""
"O-This beer was one of the beers to start me into craft some 12 years ago and it is almost as delicious as I remember it, which is a good thing. I cannot say that this is my favorite quad, but it is close and there is nothing wrong with this brew. More particularly, and less nostalgically, I can say that the taste is a nice, complex mix of sweet, fruity malts with subtle touch of earthy, Belgian character. The feel is spot-on for a quad and the whole package is well-balanced."

"O: The flavors in this integrate very well, but I'd like more complexity and sweetness, and a bit less booze. Maybe it's a bit too green. People talk about this being among the best Quads and very similar to Westy 12. I don't think this is anywhere near as complex as Westy 12, and I find it drier than the already fairly dry for the style Westy."

"overall: very tasty beer. not overly sweet, and nice and smooth. Nice after dinner dessert beer. High alcohol content..."
""
""
""
""
""
"The first thing that hits me is a distinctly sweet bready note almost completely void of the dark fruits that the aroma would indicate. However, they soon appear in full force as the aforementioned dark cherries supersede the bready malts. The finish is a perfect synthesis of the previous two bready and fruity components I mentioned, which is something I love so much about this: its perfect balance. Mouthfeel is very warm and comforting, and the high alcohol presence leaves a very faint but noticeable warming sensation near the sternum. I would love to drink this on a brisk late autumn night. Carbonation is medium to low; certainly something to sip on over a gradual period, but nothing too heavy."
""

"Overall: it was good for being available pretty much anywhere. But for the price, the quality wasn't what I was expecting."

"O: I was pretty excited about this beer, but in my opinion it didn't live up to its reputation. It's a really good Quad, but not a great one. Don't not drink this beer, but I highly recommend drinking the Rochefort 10. Better yet drink them side by side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above. For the two of us, it came down to a style preference. I like a challenging brew and she likes a well-balanced, un-assuming brew."
"A really good beer. I tried this one because it is supposedly the same as Westvleteran's older recipe and since I will have the opportunity to try that soon, I wanted to be able to compare. I really like this, but I've had a couple quads I like more. Still, I wouldn't pass this one up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Time for cuddles, I mean kudos. This is not my favorite style, and I have previously been disappointed by the offerings of St. Bernardus, yet I am impressed by this product. For my tastes, it is not for down time after work, or as a thirst quencher. This is one to crack open to accompany a wonderful meal."

"Poured from a 330ml bottle. We tasted this right around the release of Westy 12 and were very impressed. It pours a slightly cloudy orangey-brown colour with plenty of hefty head.The nose is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this quad: It's spicy and herbal with sweet notes of licorice and white pepper. On the palate it's equally complex with a big mouth-filling carbonation and notes of fruit, spice, mint and herbs. There's a nice warming booziness as well."
""
"O - One of the best quads I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great brew that is a fine representation of the Quad. I prefer the Westy 12 and the Rochefort 10, although this is certainly not a beer to dismiss. A fine blend that is widely available."
"O: this is deffiantly my favorite at bernardus between this the triple and the prior 8. Nice complexity and balance and very nice mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"I tasted this beer in its recommended chalice. It had a pleasant mouth feel with a thickness that was not off-putting. The hint of chocolate and tones of pipe tobacco with a bit of peppery sweetness was nice. I noted its alocohol content on the back of my soft palate. The bouquet was soft and a tad smokey like an autumn breeze that caries the waftings of a distant chimney."
""
""
"O. I would say that this is a lovely, strong quad. Flavorful but not exceedingly heavy. Well balanced."
""
"-Overall 4.5: Excellent beer. Surprisingly light considering that this is a Quad, and there is no hint of the 10% ABV. Somewhat flat in places, the taste in nonetheless excellent and not at all overwhelming. Would be an excellent beer to accompany food. Recommended."
""
""
"You know how it looks, dark brown, cloudy, chunks of deliciousness floating around in it. High carbonation as to be expected of this style. Heavy alcohol right up front, followed by more alcohol. On the back end, hints of raisin, melting into a nearly minty finish. This beer seems pretty straight forward to me, kinda grabs you by the collar and slaps you around a little. Certainly a no-nonsense beer. It's dark, it's strong, it's boozy, it is glorious. I like it."
"Pours dark brown with a rocky, beige head, lots of carbonation to hold the head retention forever. Chunky lacing is left all over the glass. Aromas are boozy, rum, raisin, bready, fruity, Belgian yeast, woodsy. Tastes are boozy also, but not off-putting, fruity, raisin, rum, Belgian yeast, bready malt, brown sugar, spicy, earthy, caramel, candi sugar. Tremendous complexity. Body is thin-to-medium, but the extra carbonation makes it feel fuller. Overall, just outstanding; world class quality. I love going back to this beer every once in awhile."

"Very carbonated. Also very sweet for alcohol in double digits. It hides well, coming more as a slight burn in the back of the throat than a booziness."

"O - Overall, the 6, 8, and 12 all virtually taste the same. I don't see the hype in these beers. Rochefort 10 destroys this on any given day."
""
""
""
"O: Quite good. A lot of delicious, complex notes going on. Definitely getting better and more complex as it warms up."
"O - A fine brew, goes down smooth and seems to reveal a different aspect with every sip. Would be in the running for my last beer ever if I had to choose."
""
""
"Flavors are similar, distinct plum and clove notes, earthy hop with some caramel and raisin in the middle. Finishes dry and fairly smooth and creamy despite the high abv, though its certainly warming. Not overly sweet, moderate carbonation. A benchmark of the style, allowing the trappist yeast to be showcased, not hiding behind a ton of candi sugar and booze like so many other Quads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I'm probably not saying anything that hasn't already been said. After letting this beer warm up it becomes even more amazing. The bottle describes it as a ""brown ale", kind of in the same way someone might call a Ferrari a ""red car"". There is so much going on yet it never overtaxes the palate. I would say this beer at 10% abv is dangerously drinkable. I would say that is highly complex with big clove, vanilla, spice, and leafy hops AND it is just a darn great beer to sit and enjoy and not over think! Will buy again, and again."
"A fantastic quad. Well balanced with an abundance a great flavors. I'll definately be enjoying this again in the future."

"O: This is the second-best quad I've had, and quads are my favorite style. Rochefort 10 is better than this, but not by leaps and bounds. St. Bernardus makes great beers; they are dong Trappiste beer better than most of the Trappiste brewerys right now, and this is their top-of-the-line to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- pretty damn tasty and the best quad i have ever had. Full of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel, the 10% abv is virtually nonexistent. A must try."
""
""
""
"O - A great beer that almost compares to the Westvleteren 12"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was just a hair behind the Rochfort, It was really a toss up between the two."
""
""
""
""
"O. This is a delicious balanced Quad and I cant wait to have some more."
""
""
""
"O: It might be one of the more drinkable and balanced quads I've ever had. 'Course, I've never had Westy 12, but Hell, doesn't Westy 12 have a very, VERY similar recipe to this? Ah well, that doesn't matter, because it's every bit as mindblowing as I hoped."
""

"A tremendous brew. A pleasure to savor and enjoy slowly - the temptation is there to go nuts, but some restraint is in order given that I only have one bottle. Wow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavors mirror the aroma making this one a nice decadent treat. Fig, raisin, plum, molasses, syrup, and just a touch of booze on the finish. There's a lot going on here, and I'm not sure this bottle was big enough for me to capture all of the nuances. I guess that's what the 750s are for. This was a treat, and one I would gladly have again."
""
""
"O – This is one of the best beers that I have ever had and surely one of the best beers on the face of the earth. I would highly recommend this to just about anyone from a novice beer drinker like myself to a seasoned veteran. Bravo St. Bernardus, bravo."

"Overall this is good stuff, but the balance between the sweet and more bitter flavours could be better. Still very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of those beers that I appreciate and can see what others enjoy, but I don't particularly like much myself. This is a high quality quad, but it a little bitter and too spicy compared to others in this style I enjoy."
""
""
""
"Overall. Good. Not the best quad I've ever had, definantly not bad by any means. Smell is great, but the taste lacks in my opinion. Good on a cold night like this though."

"O: Delicious. The look and palate of an English Porter but with a spicier and more complex flavor, likely due to the Belgian yeast. The great availability of this beer in my area means I will keep this one in stock in the pantry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: St. Bernardus ABT 12 is a fantastic quad, but it is not quite as good as I remember. I wonder if I will have similar feelings about Westy 12 next time I have it."

""

""
""
"O- A real deal Quad, flavor , body, and balance. So well rounded."
""
"O: Goes down somewhat easily, nice taste, not too filling, was a rather lovely beer on a steamy VA summer night."
"Beer was medium bodied with a sweet, slightly fruity smell. It had a nice creamy head, about 1-1 1/2"" thick, and for the % of alcohol, it was well balanced. Bought some in the bottle and noticed that it taste better at around 50 degrees rather at 40. I must say though that it is one of the best beers I have tasted."
""
"Overall: very good beer but you and I both have had better especially factoring in price. I would drink again, no doubt about that but slightly skeptical about another purchase. Try it yourself and you give it a shot."
""
""
""
"O: It is a stunning beer, the best I've had so far, it has such a rich and bold flavor, very sweet, balanced with bubbly and refreshing carbonation along with the higher ABV, It's a wonderful mixture, I don't know how they do it. All I can say is, I know it's expensive, but just live outside the box for one day and try this beer, It's outstanding. Your going to like what you taste, i guarantee it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. I hear a lot of people like this better than westy 12. Not this guy from this bottle, but I will have to try them side by side at some point. A great beer, despite my criticism."

"Dark brown color, big brown creamy head. Plum, alcohol, yeast and berries in aroma. Flavor is strong cream and toffee with a sting of alcohol. Also malts and yeast make their way through. Lovely product with a nice long roasted aftertaste in the throat as well as creamy toffee in the mouth."
"O: Had passed on this one and Rochefort 10 because ""they are always there"". Great quad and would rate it a close second to Rochefort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer deserves to be, and is, one of the best. It's really complex and unique. I need to try the rest of the St. Bernardus."
""
"This quad is a fantastic execution and has defined the style. This is the beer American brewery's Belgian-style quads or high gravity dubbels aim for."
""
""
"I've sampled most of the labels listed, including those not available here in the US (e.g. Westvlereten 12) and Abt 12 blows most of them out of the water. The rich, yeasty flavors that linger long after the crisp finish imparts one hell of a taste experience to this fullest bodied ale. The pour explodes into a foamy head instantly, and the initial effervescence within seconds transforms into a robust fizz that carries the bread-like base into at least 10 different flavors (you can actually discern intermediate overtones of vine fruits, assorted spices, etc.). I wonder how many of your raters have actually tried this angelic brew, 'cause if they did the scoring would be quite a bit different!"

"O: One of the better quads out there. Nice and mellow with lots of fruit and malty sweetness (but no where near overly sweet or cloying). In fact, it's on the drier side. Well balanced flavors with substantial complexity. It's a distant runner-up to Westy 12 but then again, who can really compete?"
"Pours a medium brown with decent head. Smell is of very ripe fruits of the apple & pear variety as well as figs, plums, etc. Taste follws with an extra bump of brown sugar and alcohol. It's really sweet, which I think limits its drinkability, but the flavor is good and the alcohol is very warming - so it calls for a slow sip approach anyhow. I would definitely rank this among the best abbey ales I've had. Really good, even if they are not among my favorite styles."
""

"I'm not huge on Belgian beers, but St. Bernardus knows how to do it well. Nice depth and complexity. Big without being too aggressive. Warms and ages like a champ. Truly a top example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this at least 4 times in the past, and I don't quite understand why I never gave it a full review. For me, this sets the bar for quads. It's very tasty, and it's easy to get. No, it's got as good as Westy 12, but it's really one of the best."

"O - I am a big fan of Rochefort 10, but this is an equally great version of the style."
"I tried this beer when I was in Belgium. The head was nice and foamy. The smell of malt was rich and with a chocolate. Mouth feel coated my mouth and lingered for a moment. Finished superb. With the 10% it does the job quite quickly. All in all, one damn good smooth beer."
""
""
"Served in a branded goblet. Poured a deep brown in colour. Stained foamy head, leaving no lacing. Smells sweet and malty, with a hint of alcohol too, thanks to the 10%. Tastes light on the tongue, filling and developing in the back of the mouth. Malt presence becomes really prevalent on the finish. Classic trappist."
""
""
"New years here we come. Forget the champagne, get this. Smooth from beginning to end. Trappist rules. Want to become a monk. Cant wait to have another. Can slip it slow or have many. Only draw back is 10%. To some that was not a negative. Moving to Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Not the best beer i've had. Maybe it's because i had high expectations. But i've had 3 the last few months and i've had mixed experiences. Still have 3 in my fridge, so i might change my mind."
"330mL into an Orval chalice. Pours a hazy coca-cola brown with a small tan head that settles down to a nice film. Nose is rum raisin, milk chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, along with some earthy tones. Taste is complex with some cloves, cinnamon, milk chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, and plums among other things. Fizzy and slightly creamy on the palate. Slight warming alcohol in the dry finish. The 10.5% is superbly hidden. I like the Special Edition better still. 8/1/2009 7/4/9/4/16=4.0"
""
""
"Abt 12 is pretty good; it's an enjoyable sipper. I just wish it had more depth of flavor."
"O: I've had bottles of this which I enjoyed much more, but this one just isn't wowing me. Nothing particularly bad about it, but it's not standing out for me at the moment. The flat aroma seems especially disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with some purple around the edges. Fluffy white to off-white head, two fingers of it. Smells of prunes and figs, some light yeast, a bit of spice. Taste explodes with fruit: pears, figs, prunes, plums, then some brown sugar and light spice along with spicy yeast. This is an easy drinker and hides the alcohol well, medium mouthfeel, medium to high carbonation. Leaves you wanting more. Great beer."
"Overall this beer is amazing. So close to perfection if it isn't perfect already. I pass this beer up all the time but when I do pick one up I always thoroughly enjoy it. Cheers!"

"Its a really great Quad...one of the best ive had. Truly setting the bar on what a Quad should be."

"O- 5.0! Just amazing!!! I was hesitant towards grabbing this beer, I don't know why... But this wonderful concoction of smell, taste, look and feel just blew me away! I would recommend this to many, if you see it.... BUY IT! It is just an astounding, well crafted beer that can not disappoint anyone. St. Bernardus is easily making their way into my favorite breweries. LOVE IT! <3"

"Not my first time having this one. I sipped it for over an hour tonight, and enjoyed every second."
""
""
"Solid pour from growler into new St. Bernardus chalice. Beautiful beer. Deep rich brown with a generous 2 finger beige head. Smell is of raisins, figs, bready malts and burnt wood. Taste follows the nose closely. I get a bit more of the fig and raisin on the front end with a nice hop finish. Very smooth brew for a 10% ABV quad. Difficult to set down as it is so balanced and solid. Feel is a nice thick, creamy/silk that sits well on the tongue with just enough carbonation. Overall- I have had this on draft and from the growler and both were outstanding. More fruit as it warms and it is so smooth and balanced. The best I have had in this style and I'm usually not a fan, so that is saying something. A must try"
""
""
""
"From the awesomely fun label to the dark and smooth pour, this is a high quality beer. It has a relatively high alcohol content, but it (the alcohol) doesn't overwhelm either the smell or taste. It pours easily and leaves a fair head and lattice. Relatively dark, I think it strikes a nice balance of hops, malt, and fruit (raisin?). I guess coming from an Abbey, I shouldn't be surprised by a bread-like yeasty taste, too."

"Served from tap into a chalice. Poured brown with a very light tan two finger head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, fig, bread, fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, sweet alcohol, and fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. I saw this one on tap and had to jump on it as it is the first time I've seen it on since I started reviewing. I was definitely not disappointed at all. All the right flavors and aromas for a great Quad were definitely present and made themselves known right out of the gate. This brew does this while still remained very well balanced and drinkable. Really glad I got the chance to have this one again and will be doing so again in the future. Maybe in the form of the 60th Anniversary I have sitting in my cellar..."

"O: This is definitely one of the best quads out there!"

"Belgium knows their beers. Was in Brussels just a while back and stuck mostly to drinking trappist ales, but had to try this world famous abbey ale. And what a treat. Just a stunning beer. Deep brown color and a head you could eat with a spoon. Lace sticks on the glass to the last sip. Smell is sweet and malty, thats dominant. Spices like cinnamon and clove are in there. Tastes christmasy, which is hard to describe. The spices from the smell are definitely still there. Huge sweetness. It's like caramel or some kind of malty molasses. Toasty and bread, with just the slightest bitterness toward the end. Also, I have to mention the huge alcohol taste. It's not the first thing that hits you (That's the sweetness of the malt) but it is obvious. Goes down smooth with subtle carbonation and huge creaminess. Somehow, this high alcohol beer is very drinkable, I'd have another. This is not overrated, get some."

""
"Definitely one of the best if not the best beers in it's class, highly recommended."

"Overall this is my first quadrupel/Belgian strong dark ale and I am completely blown away. As soon as I took the first sip I knew this was the best beer I have ever had. BSDA/quads may well be my new favorite style."

"Verdict: This is definitely one of the best beers that's as available as it is. Not sure it quite ranks up there with Rochefort 10 and Westy 12 but it's damn good and so easy to get."
"overall 3rd time ive had this and it will be the last. recently got more, better fruit flavor from an absolutely delicious, super fresh sixer of troegenator."
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer. Tastes good, looks great, smells like it should and it's not hard to drink. There are quite a few quads and triples made in NA, but none compare to this beast of a beer. The only knock I have on it is the price, there are some beer that just a little bit weaker than this that are nearly half the price. Maybe even cheaper."
""
"Second review on one of my favorite beers. Looks great in my quad glass with a creamy tan head and a deep golden brown color. Smell is dark fruit, malty and bright alcohol. Deep rich flavor of dark fruits and banana nut bread, but never approaches being too sweet. Boozy, but nice drinkability. Clean finish with the perfect beery aftertaste. Nice and warm on the belly. Near perfect."
""
"O - an outstanding example of a brew that is often taken as a challenge and not given its due respect, but this is the real deal, drink this beer!"
"Pours a very dark brown, large head on pour, quickly fades though, beautiful lacing and the bubbles are very fine like in their Tripel, which I previously reviewed and loved. Scent is of dark fruit like plums and dates, belgian yeast, and malts. Taste is fantastic, notes of dark fruits, belgian yeast, and a bit of soy. There is a good amount of booziness though but not too much to detract from the well balanced flavor. This is a very very thick, full beer. Mouthfeel is thick, with that booziness and just a bit of very fine carbonation. Overall a fantastic brew, though due to how big of a beer this is, Its definitely one to take slow and enjoy. For those that want something a little crisper and less heavy, their Tripel fits perfectly - and I must say I enjoyed the two about the same overall."

"Poured from the bottle, the beer was a cloudy dark brown color with tan head. In my case, the bottle became a little over-excited and tried leaving the bottle the moment the cork popped. This did not affect my drinking experience. The nose was familiar to most Belgians. A malty aroma was accompanied by hints of dark fruit. The initial taste was alomst mediciny in the variation on the dark fruits. The degree of carbonation was higher the I would have anticipated for a Quad. The carbonation brushed away some of the notes I was seeking rather quickly. Dark fruits, burned malts, and a hint of chocolate were obvious. In the aftertaste, the beer gave a pleasant warming sensation. This is an easy sipping beer. However, it was not quite as sweet as some other Quads I have had."
""
""
""
"D/O: A tasty treat. My only complaint in terms of drinkability would be that, as I worked through the glass, a bit of a ""black licorice"" taste started to shine through. I like black licorice, but I just thought it was ""odd"" and didn't quite work here. Still enjoyable, overall, though. Certainly repeatable."
""
""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark red/orange amber. Small head leaving a light ring and slight lacing. Sweet aroma of malt and dark fruit. Dark fruit, sweet malt and light Belgian spicing. Caramel and malt finish. Excellent body, mouth feel and flavor. A world class quadrupel."

"Overal: I recently had the St. B dubbel, and I think I prefer the dubbed to the quad. Don't get me wrong--this is a beer to savor. But for quads, I might be inclined to reach for the Ommegang 3 Ps before this (again, though, it's a close call)."
""
"Deep plum brown with a nicely retained beige head in a St. Bernardus goblet. Garnet hues barely shine through in the light. Nicely sweet, predominantly caramel, plum, raisins, and a light toffee hint. Perhaps even a touch of burnt sugar in the very farthest reaches of the crevices of your palate. This beer commands respect to all those savoring its greatness. Very, very light hint of hops keeps it from being cloying, yet remaining undetectable by conventional means. It's almost as if the hops are simple leaving a shadow to dance with the malts and fruity flavors. Carbonation is spot on. Sweet and almost chewy body, but still incredibly smooth."

"This is the beer that started it all for me two years ago. Had it on tap at Brasserie V (Madison), and opened a door I didn't know existed. I'd always thought I was a lager guy -- doppelbocks were as serious I got about beer at the time, that and black-and-tans. The Abt 12 broke it all wide open. Now I know I""m a malt guy. Love the Belgians. Love the barley wines and old ales. Love the imperial stouts. Sours, too, though."

"330ml bottle. Oversized glass. Enjoyed on may´12 & at least once a month. Pours brownish copper in color. Chill haze. Off-white, medium bubbled, slowly dissipated head. Nice lacing collars. Sweet toasted malts, spices, cinnamon & sugar to the nose. Esters are ripe fruit-like both in flavor & aroma. Full body with medium-high, no puckering, carbonation. Smooth warming ABV. Creamy sweet spiced mouthfeel. Harmonious malty body dances with alcohol. What can be said about a, probably, one of the best spots of the Belgian ABT/Quad style!"

"Bought a bottle of this at Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. The appearance of this quad is wild... a medium-thickness white head that, as it dissipates, reveals this strange chocolate-swirl that makes it look like a cappuccino. The brew itself is also very cloudy, looking almost alive as mist glides through the liquid. It has a wonderful apple scent that comes off the top of the brew in a noticeable but not overpowering way. The taste is spot-on, especially as the brew warms up in temperature, really making that 10% ABV present. The only downside to this brew to me was the excess gas and the sometimes harsh aftertaste that accompanies it. Overall, I love this beer, but I might choose other trappist brews over this in the future. Excellently paired with a garlicy steak."

"O - a fantastic beer with everything you could ever ask for. I want a bottle to be placed in my casket."

"Overall this beer is ridiculously good. Great smell, unique flavor, nice mouthfeel and at 10% it gets you lit quickly. I drank it cold but warm I think it would be just as good. Try it...today..."
"O - I truly enjoyed having this Trappist ale as much as the monk depicted on the bottle. Along with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12 (though I haven't yet had it), this brew easily fits in the top tier of Quads and does not disappoint at all with it's superb flavor and addictive mouthfeel. Sometimes, it's nice to just relax and sip on a complex beer to take the taste buds for an awesome ride. St. Bernardus Abt 12 is an excellent choice for such an occasion."

"This beer has forced me to re-evaluate the need to attend release parties or fight for hard-to-get special releases. Why bother when this stuff is so damn good and so easy to get? It is easily one of the most complex and best-tasting beers I have ever had. I deeply regret buying two big bottles of it. I should have bought a case."
"O: you will understand why the folks at Brouwerij St. Bernardus consider this their show piece."
""
""
"D: Easily drinkable. Nice finish and a long aftertaste."
"Taste is again comprised of the aforementioned fruit, including some raisin. The alcohol warming presence is muted and subtle, despite the high 10% ABV. Wow. This is a delightful and nuanced beer that transcends the norm. Beautiful!"

"Pours a dark caramel-colored beige with a beautiful, fluffy off-white two finger head. Gorgeous lacing. The smell of fruit perhaps, plum, black cherries and a bit of fig on the nose, sweet malt, and spice as well. Initially clove and pleasant spice dominate giving way to sweet malt, dark fruit, and yeasty esters. Finishes sweet with pleasant alcoholic warmth. Perfect smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A near perfect beer and one of the best brews I've had the privilege of drinking."

"Overall: A very good beer, but good have been better with a decent, rich head (perhaps my 12 ounce bottle was old or my glass dirty, but I'd never seen such large, glass-thin carbonation bubbles - virtually no head at the finish and no lacing or rings on the glass). Otherwise, the taste elements were pretty much spot-on for a quad."
"A little tidbit I just learned. St. Bernardus was once a contract brewer for westvleteren and the abt 12 is based heavily on the 12, is it possible that if westvleteren wasn't so hard to get it might rate right around St. Bernardus? Food for thought."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm new to this style, having only had Three Philosophers before this. Looking forward to delving into this style more; obviously this is a classic!"
""
""
"O: Hands down, one of the best, if not the best I have tried. World class."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Complex yet simple. Delicious and intense, yet soft and enjoyable. Is this one of the top Quad's out their? Most definately. Can I have another please?"

"A very decent beer; one of the best. Good for a celebration or occation. Very sophisticated feeling this beer has."

"has not changed. Just wonderful. 5"
""
""
"O - Probably my favorite Belgian Abbey beer so far. Will be back."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark brown with a finger length tan head that slowly dissipates. Toffee, raisin, date, fig, and some alcohol are present in the aroma. It's very pleasing. The flavors of bread, toffee, yeast, and dark fruits explode in the mouth on the first sip. The alcohol taste is there, but it's not overpowering. However, the alcohol taste becomes more apparent the warmer it gets. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is abundant. Overall, this is a most excellent example of a quad that is relatively easy to find. I recommend this one."
"O: One of the finest quads in existence. Easy to drink but that’s not really the point with a beer like this. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a rich deep dark brown color with a nice 3 finger white billowing head with supreme retention and lacing. Looks phenomenal. As poured the aroma fills the room with a nice variety of dark fruits, roasted malts, molasses, and bread. No hint of higher abv. The flavor builds on the pleasant nose and is a delight. very thick and creamy and rich from the get go but incredibly approachable. The sweetness of the malt is most prominent at first but mellows quickly as a light bitterness enters. The dark fruit gives way to hints of raisins, molasses, figs, and liquorice and is very nice. Finishes creamy and smooth with a lingering sweetness. Full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a treat. I can't wait to purchase more to age and enjoy later. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Definitely going on my rotation, but it's a little pricey... you get what you pay for, though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was the beer that introduced me to quadrupels. I think I have it ranked ever so slightly behind the Rochefort Trappistes 10 and comfortably behind the Westvleteren 12, but that's because those beers are phenomenal. The Trappist quads set a ridiculous standard, and Abt 12 is a brilliant beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is warm and inviting after dinner dessert drink although it would pair well with a hearty meal such as a meat stew. I think this would be best with bread, cheese, nuts and dark dried fruits. It is sweet, malty and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: an amazing quadrupel, maybe would have been even better from a bottle, but very enjoyable and smooth."
""

"O- fantastic. just great. really good flavours, great complexity. i really like this beer"
"O--An excellent brew. Lots of complexity, but smooth and enjoyable. Looking forward to trying this again."
""
""
"O- This was a great Quad. While the smell and taste didn't blow me away, the mouthfeel is what made this beer fantastic. The beer was incredibly smooth and drinkable. Definitely one of the better Belgian beers that I've had. The beer was very well balanced between the bready yeastiness and slightly lemony/floral sweetness. Slightly overhyped, but still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my go to beer that I have been drinking for years. Maybe not the most unique or creative beer, but a quality that is consistent and ever satisfying."
"What more can you want?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A wonderful beer with a very nice complexity of flavor and balance. I shouldn't be surprised as I have been impressed with every beer I have had from St. Bernardus. Another one of those beers that I continue to drink and appreciate over many years. The alcohol is well hidden considering the ABV but this is a sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For some reason people like to say this is better than Westvleteren 12, and I don't understand that at all. Still a fabulous bier."
""
""
""
"Appears a deep, dark brown with a nice finger of off-white head. Smells of caramel and malt with slight hints of fig and nuts. Tastes just like it smells with a smooth malty finish that leaves a nice coating on your mouth. Despite the high alcohol content, the bite is masked by the richness of this Quad. A great beer overall. It's pretty expensive here in the States so I'm not sure if I'll pay to drink this again, but I certainly wouldn't oblige if one were offered to me."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is an opaque, rich, blood-brown coloring with a slight filmy sparsely coating the surface. Aromas are rich and complex, with notes of licorice, molasses, and slight pepper and spicing. The flavors are rich and deep, with a blend of plum, date, and raisin on a crisp, well carbonated body. The alcohol gives a nod here and there, highlighting the palate. Biscuit and bready flavors throughout balance the other characteristics, and the overall malt profile is complex and delicious. At any given time you can get notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, old world fruits, and even some buttery tones. The aftertaste is creamy sweet and rich, almost like cake batter. The finish, remarkably, is kept light by the carbonation, and leaves the palate fairly clean. Great beer."
"Overall: Really solid Quad! I did not think that ABT 12 would stand up to the likes of Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, but it does. This beer is really close to both beers, but its just a little rough around the edges compared to the the other two beers; very minor differences I gotta say. In other words...ABT 12 is an easy to get Westy 12 without all the hype/rarity surrounding it. Just like Rochefort 10, but I like Rochefort 10 just a little bit better. If you like Quads don't pass this beer up!"
""
"O: Nice, rich, malty sweet beer, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is an excellent beer.  Great palate profile and surprising drinkability.  I do think Rochefort 10 is better, but this is great in its own right.  Plus it's widespread availability and reasonable price make it a worthy regular in my beer rotation, and definitely a must try for those who have not yet had the pleasure of drinking it."
""
"O- Takes some time to get into but, once the glass starts to empty, the complexity and deliciousness is fully realized."
""
"Aroma is not pronounced, soft and benign - hints of sweet dark fruit and fails to prepare you for your first taste. Complexity, initially hard to pin down what's going on. Its sweet, soft and warm, the alcohol is here but melded with deep malts and a tumble of fruit on the tongue; figs, cherry, lexia raisin, come licorice and spice perhaps. Its is leavened out with bitter chocolate and coffee, finished with lacing of Fruit Salad sweets. There's other elements I can't describe but it is certainly an experience and highly recommended."
"Bottom line: If your a beer snob....this is a must have!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When drinking, it should be a little warm, and is a heavy, syrupy mouthfeel that is pretty well carbonated for a quad. The taste is a strong, sweetness (almost Cherry-Coke like) with a winey, port sort of after taste. As it warms up it really mellows out into a sweet beer with a malty after taste, and is an adventure in and of itself. A well carbonated beer that has a world class taste."
""
""
"Pretty much what you smell is what you get; A lot of dark rich flavors including cherries, raisins, bready caramel notes, and that great unique Belgian yeast flavor, all blending together to make an absolutely incredible beer."
""
""
"Out of a bottle purchased at the Hop Heads bar this beer was a cloudy, dark chestnut color with a towering head of foam. The retention was impressive and the lacing in fine bands with fishnets in between. The aroma was complex and appealing. I detected bready malt, caramel malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruits, some bananas and spices. The flavors were equally complex and yet complimentary. All the same notes from the nose were apparent in the taste with a perfect core of caramel and chocolate malt. Spicy and punchy without being hot, I thought it was an excellent example of balance and finesse. Dried fruits and plums became more pronounced as it warmed up and the hops presence was just enough to counterbalance the malts. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. An excellent beer in every way and one of the finest Belgians I’ve had."
""
"O: When the Quad style is mentioned this is a prime example of what it should be. The balance of this beer is World Class. So many things going on, yet seemingly so simple. This one will one will always have a special place in my heart and my refrigerator."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- the best Belgium strong/quad I have had up until this point. I will defiantly be gravitating back to this again and again."
""
""
"O: Really nice - smooth and full, bready and malty, deep and satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A terrific beer, and I really get why this is so highly rated. So many different flavors going on that from sip to swallow, the profile changes constantly. The body and mouthfeel are superb and at no time does the beer feel heavy, nor does the 10% abv over-rule the experience. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I think this is also best shared, so that you can discuss all of the different flavor nuances with the person(s) you're enjoying this with."
"It pours a nice dark brown color with a huge 3 finger width with a off-white head then it leaves a nice ring of lacing. I get dark sweet fruits like raisins and figs then that great yeasty smell that comes with all quads, followed up with a slight presences of alcohol. The taste is great that raisin/fig taste with a some addition sweetness from caramel flavor then that discernible Belgium yeast flavor. When compared to other quads this one does have a noticeable alcohol bite that the others do not have. The mouthfeel is medium, but it is too carbonated for my taste. Overall this is a good beer but when compared to other Quads it places in the top 5 but near the bottom."
""
"O: I'm not a big fan of Belgians overall, and hadn't really had a Quad I could say I liked. This stuff has completely shaken my perspective, in a very good way. I'm surprised this stuff was sitting on an obscure shelf in my local liquor store."
""
"O: Fantastic. For me this is the right balance of bready malt and fruit sweetness. Its a monster to drink though and the ABV is noticeable, but it was hard to stop."
"Temp = 51F."
"This beer is awesome fresh or with a year on it! I don't believe this is the perfect or best beer in the world (or that there is such one), but it embodies the Quad style perfectly! It's very easy to drink, complex and balance and I don't think there is anything that could improve this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best in the world, no doubt!"
""
""
"Pours a mahogany brown with a nice tight tan head. Scent is of dark fruit and cherries with a roasted maltiness. The taste follows the scent and fills the mouth with the dark cherry, cola and hint of spice. The carbonation is excellent. This is an excellent quad and my second favorite behind Rochefort 10."
""
"O- Truly excellent. Paired with mussels and frites. Delicious and complex."
""
"who is gonna argue with this brew? it's a standard bearer of one of the world's most renowned beer styles. EXCELLENT."
"One of my favorite quads so far. This is one of the few beers that I have had more on tap, in fact this is the first time I had it out of the bottle. I will have to say it is a bit better on tap from what I remember."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"note: Tasting was paired wonderfully with 8 slices of thick cut smoked bacon."
""
""

"Very smooth and harmonious, probably the most balanced Quad I have drank thus far. Only wish I had several of these to put back. Find it and enjoy!"
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: A really enjoyable beer. Certainly one of the premier quad offerings out there."
""
""
""
""
"Note: This beer is far too good to be alone. I paired this with a roasted garlic hummus, pretzels and gouda cheese. I could theoretically see you pairing this with a braised brisket of beef."
"A quintessential quadruple. It's no Rochefort 10 or westy 12, but it holds it's own just the same. They should start selling this beer in vending machines in Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Really liked this Quad; haven't had too many...makes me want to pick up a few others."

"A great beer that is a wonderful sipper. I was right to enjoy this on a cold, January night."

"O: I admit to not being a fan of Belgian styles, particularly Quads, but I really enjoyed this. Huge aroma and flavor profile, complexity without being overly sweet, very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. I'll enjoy the bottle throughout the night."
""
"Overall: Awesome, everything I look for in a quad. Enjoyed over the course of 40 min, as it warmed fruity tartish notes became more pronounced and the head completely dissipated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good. Balance, quality, harmony. There's an unassuming humility though too. It's not trying to be huge, just to be very well done. There are richer and more more concentrated beers out there flavorwise, but I wouldn't change a thing. What a light and delightful treat when you want something different."
""
""
""
""
""
"Best of the St. Bernardus lineup and an incredible example of the style. The Rochefort 10 edges it out in my book, but that doesn't stop it from being world class."
""
"O: This was my second favorite beer of the blind tasting and a solid beer all-around. The balance of spice and dark fruit is exceptional while the ABV is pronounced, but not overbearing. Good job St. Bernardus NV!"
""
""
"O- Awesome beer. Really phenomenal. I think i still actually like Chimay Blue a tad bit more . . . or maybe not. It is really close. Anyway, this is an awesome beer. Definitely world class. Great all around."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent beer and the craft put into brewing this beer is world class, I just find the aromas and flavors to be really good, but not mind blowing. I really prefer Three Philosophers.. blasphemy?"
""
""
"O: I like this beer, don't get me wrong, but I'll take a Rochefort 10 any day. Sure the aroma on this one is better, but the Rochefort packs more of a punch in terms of flavor. The body feels maybe a little too weak on this one, which is kind of funny since the Rochefort is a bit too heavy for me. Maybe that's what makes Westvleteren is so good. Still worth seeking out though."
""
""
""
"D - I'd have it again, though I've had better quads. It hides it's abv well, but I think it's a bit reserved."
""
""
""
""
"Impressive - rich and tasty. A smooth and complex quad that deserves the acclaim heaped upon it. Swirling it around the mouth is a pleasure. Not one I'd want to imbibe every day, but a must try for any beer lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one of the best. Nothing else really needs to be said. Split a 750ml with a friend and enjoy the best life has to offer!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great quad. I haven't had a ton of Belgians, but I can tell this is a great beer."
""
""
""
"O: Not my style but it is still OK."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is so much better in the bottle that I fully intend on deleting my previous review as having it on tap does not do it justice. This is as close to a Westvleteren 12 as you can get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will definitely be drinking this much more in the future! There is a reason these breweries have existed for hundreds of years, and with a bottle of this, you can definitely see why!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what the enjoyed most about this brew was the taste. The fruity and estery inclusion helped maintain a lightness of flavoring. This also helped calm the huge malt framework of the beer. The complexity was there, and everything was expertly blended together, working in harmony. The aroma and feel also delivered as expected, in a very Belgian way. This beer is damn near perfect for a cold winter day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this on tap at a beer bar in West Palm Beach. Served in a tulip glass, the dark nectar had a beautiful tan head. Definitely fruity but somehow butterscotch and vanilla notes arrived about mid-glass. Has very smoooth and long finish. Huge sheets of belgian lace clung to the glass. Not sure how it would go with food but I'd drink several as a substitute for dessert."
""
"For a 10% Belgian Quad this beer is VERY thin. Highly attenuated, no heft on the tongue. The bordering on ridiculous level of carbonation really damages this beer. It mutes the aroma and destroys the mouthfeel. Not in the same class as Westy 12 or Rochefort 10."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Cleveland's Bier Markt- served in a 12 oz tulip with a small head. Appears to be a dark amber color (sorry dim lighting in the bar makes it difficult to determine). Has minimal head retention and no lacing. Smells mostly of yeast but has some hints of nutty malts. The taste is medium bodied with the same nuttiness and yeastiness as the smell. It is well carbonated and not syrupy at all. It tastes different on draft than in the bottle but of course still very enjoyable and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic Quad - the alcohol was masked very well through all the fruit flavors that came out. One of these beers that you could certainly drink multiples of, however with being 10%, it'd get you into some trouble."
"I have seen this beer around, and never pulled the trigger. Thank you for this, and it is going to become a part of my regular rotation. I have had a Westy 12 in the past, and as previously stated, this style is not one I have a lot of experience with. However, I would take this over the Westy I had any day. Thanks Kevin."
""
""
"M - If this doesn't get a perfect mouth feel I don't know what can. Clean, refreshing, and no noticeable ABV. I would be so happy in Belgium pounding these for around domestic price."
""
""
"O: fantastic, available, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
""
"Happy Brewing!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This really is on par with Westvleteren 12, and seemingly much more consistent (and cheaper). If you ever find yourself tempted to fork out wads for a Westy off eBay, remember these words: ""Don't do it you pooter. Buy an Abt 12."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just brilliant. I have a Westy 12 in the pantry that has a tough act to follow."
""
"I won't get into an entire formal review, but I was incredibly surprised to find this on tap at the new Yardhouse in VA Beach. Served in a goblet glass, the beer lived up to it's reputation in every regard. I sampled it along with some of my other perennial favorites including Maredsous 10, Aventinus, Delirium, and Chimay Tripel. The Bernardus 12 stood out as the the most complex well balanced, full bodied beer of them all. If you're a connoisseur you need to put plenty of this in your fridge right next to the Chimay Grand Reserve and La Fin du Monde."
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic, complex brew with great marrying of flavors. Top tier in my opinion. Highly recommend."
""
"O - Very tasty, but the best part is the feel. This couldn't be more perfectly tailored to the type of beer that it is. It is intensely easy to drink while also complex and fulfilling. I could drink this all day. Time to become a monk."
"Overall a fantastic beer, I am glad I finally stopped to have one and look forward to looking back on these thoughts in the future as I finish this 4-pack over the next few years"
""
"Nice mouthfeel, lightly creamy, medium bodied, good lively carbonation. Long lingering finish that reinforces the earlier wine aspect of this beer. Truly excellent, a bit lighter in body and overall feel and flavor than many other quads. Elegant and well constructed. I actually prefer Rochefort's 10 somewhat but hard to go wrong here as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a beer well worth having. Try it as soon as possible. You will not regret it!!"
"O: This is just an all around great beer. There arent tons of beers like this around me and I am glad that I got to try it. I still prefer Westy 12, but this is very close in quality and taste. Well done."
"O: A very nice quad. I see why its rated so high. The sourness of this one establishes it from others, I believe. Its certainly not bad, just different. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed St. Bernardus Abt 12 and it's a great example of the quad style. I don't think it quite lives up to the hype, but it's enjoyable and relatively decently priced/widely available, so I imagine it'll be a beer that I revisit multiple times in the future. A nice beer to sit back and enjoy."
""

"If you have a chance, pick up St. Bernardus's sampler that comes with a sniffer glass...well worth the money."

"Incredible taste, first beer in a long time to blow me away like it did. Classic Belgian, with more of a wheaty smell. Others have told me they've picked up a berry scent, and it came up. There's definitely a reason this beer is so highly regarded, I can't really comment on anything about this beer that hasn't already been said here. The overwhelming response should be enough."

"Overall - Phenomenal. As a quad, it arguably does not get any better than this. With so many taste notes and so many hidden subtleties, it is hard not to think so highly of this Monastic beer. Remarkably balanced with both sweet and dry flavors, it is virtually perfect in every way possible. I have enjoyed this beer countless times in the past and it always manages to leave me breathless. One of my all-time favorite brews, hands-down!"
""
"I've had this in bottle and on tap and both ways it was very good. A smooth taste that doesn't lean to far towards bitter or sweet, and keeps the malt and hops tastes in balance. I would have rated the small at 5.0 also, but I couldn't make myself rate this a ""perfect beer"" even though it's pretty damn close to that."

"This beer pours a dark brown with a huge head that left good lacing as it dissipated (the beer was allowed to warm to about 54 degrees F.) The aroma is candy sweet with a mild soapiness. There are light hints of dried fruits and a faint smell of booze. The flavor of the beer is sweet and spice through and through. Raisins, molasses, caramel, figs, and spice are all there intertwined beautifully. There is just a hint of bitter and the aftertaste is a lingering spice and warmth that seems great for cold weather. The MF is smooth, slick, and slightly watery. The carbonation seems to be a tad high and the alcohol leaves warmth in both mouth and throat. This is a damn near flawless beer in my opinion. This is a perfect blend of flavor and alcohol. The flavors are rich and decadent and all wonderfully in check. This is one of my favorites and I always enjoy it."

"Final Thoughts: I think I'm getting tired of belgian beers, and they don't see to quite be for me. Each time I have them, they come across as high class, but snooty and disconnected. I mean, the higher end ones seem to get it done right, but most of the others come across as close but no cigar and frankly almost like they are trying to cheaply imitate other beers. I know that's not the case, but that's just how I feel about them. Anyways, this is one fares better then most, so I'd say give it a shot."

"D - Still a solid quad, but at 10% ABV this beer just doesn't offer enough in the flavor department. Despite all these complaints, this beer was still very good and in fact really easy to drink. This one is certainly going down as something to re-review down the road."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a damn good quad. I enjoyed it much more than rochefort 10, and I think the taste, aroma, mouth feel follow close behind the infamous westy 12."

"O - Great beer! Glad I bought a bunch of this. Very drinkable. Looking forward to cellaring it for a while and tasting the difference."

"O - Awesome beer, drinkable, big fruits and sweet malts, smooth alcohol hides how big this is."
""
""
""
"an outstanding quad, but not perfect. poured into a goblet a nice redish amber color with one of these perfect heads only a belgian can provide. smells sugary, yeasty, fruity, and like something sticky... honey? caramel? molasses? flavor is fruity and malt driven up front, with some slight tart sensations happening in the background, a roasted sweet finish rounds this one off. unmatched in its complexity, this quad goes well with a wide array of food, i had it with a rabbit stew. mouthfeel is bright and bubbly, with a medium body. the 10% abv is well hidden. could drink this all night, but it isnt as good as the la trappe quad"

"To complement this beer, i recommend only the best. This beer is meant for a Madrid v Barcelona soccer match or Charlie Mingus Cumbia Jazz and Fusion. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic beer. Wish more tasted this way."
"O) Glad I finally got around to trying this beer. It did not disappoint. I would highly recommend. This was quite a treat."
""
""
"O: A solid ""A" rated brew here. Nothing offensive, plenty of flavor and aromas, high ABV that is completely hidden. A real winner all around and a treat to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not what I was expecting, this was a very heavy beer. I don't know if I like it or not."
""
"As I've said, this is one of the best beers in the entire world and can hold it's own easily against the best of the best. A desert island beer if there ever was one. Extremely recommended."
"Medium to full body, smooth carbonation fine carbonation that is very soft on the tongue. For a 10% beer, this is way too easy to drink at this point. Still very flavorful beer, but I may prefer a little less age on this."
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious brew; one of the best true Belgium beers that is widely available and moderately reasonable in price."

"D: not the first time i have had this gem, but the first time i have formally reviewed it. i have another 750mL that has been aging for about a year and i plan on waiting 4 more years to drink. will re-review then. as for this one, still very tasty fresh out of the bottle. great complexity on the palate. a very well-made quad."

"Pours a reddish brown, with a creamy tan head. Great head, with modest retention, and great lacing. Good clarity in the body. Nose has some soft fruits, brown sugar, alcohol soaked fruits, a touch of spice and some vinous notes. Soft fruitiness is again found in the flavour, lightly sugary, a touch of earth, caramel. Some sweetness and a bit of dryness in the finish. Soft, smooth and gentle carbonation, fills the mouth exceptionally. An awesome quad, great flavours and the mouthfeel make this exceptional."
"O - I feel like some thing went wrong here. It was very thin. I dunno. Good but not what I expected."
"Medium bodied, this is well carbonated and smooth."
"O: Good beer. I would recomend anyone looking for a tasty refreshing yet complex brew."
"Overall, this was a tasty quad, but I found myself preferring Rochefort compared to this. Alcohol was too noticeable and carbonation a notch too high."
"have tried both the larger corked and the smaller capped version. It pours a merky light brown color with an off white head that leaves a little layer of white bubbles at the top after it subsides. The smell is sweet an some what yeast. The taste is strong and boozy up front full but then evens out with a sweet dried fruit finish. Nicely balanced and an over all nice Quad."
"O: Mouthfeel and smell stand out to me as exceptional qualities. Overall, a world class experience."
"Uses the original yeast strand of Westvleteren, eh? Including many other similar regional ingredients? Makes me more willing to merely stick with this for now! This bottle I bought (in France) was not nearly as tasty as the 750ml corked bottle I drank from (in the US) or as fresh as the 33cl bottle I had in Brussels! Still, while it's not my favorite quad, this is a massive beer. One of the greatest quads, and a recipe that deserves respect and acclaim. In my opinion, one of the best beers to convert safe beer drinkers to the ""dark side"" of good quality beer."
"One of the best beers out there. Always enjoyable and tough to beat."
"o - buy it to drink now.. probably could cellar if you wanted too.."
"O- A classic and easily accessible example of a Belgian Quad. I've been drinking this one for years and don't for-see a time when I'll ever get tired of this complex beer. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O - Magnificient and without a doubt one of my favourite quads. A complex beer with terrific well balanced flavours that leaves your taste buds begging for more."
"O - Very enjoyable beer. I would definitely love to get a bottle to keep around for when I'm in the mood for it again."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, and it has been a go to when I am in the mood for a Quad for some time. Not sure why it took me so long to review it."
"Overall: An exceptional and complicated beer. I was surprised to find so much clove in the flavor and aroma, but it is pleasant and works well. An amazing beer."
"The alcohol is present and adds a great amount of warmth making this one a sipper. The flavor is solid and the subtleties are there. It's probably one of my favorite St. Bernardus brews."
"O: great beer. Perfect for desert. Couldn't do more than one a night I think. I'd love to pair it with food."
"D-This one is pretty delicious, very complex, and no hint that this one hits 10% on the ABV scale. I'm not sure why it took me this long to try this beer, but this will definitely be a beer I frequent in the future."
"o - very drinkable and tasty. i would drink this again, but it was a little pricy for a 12oz bottle. i think $4.50 or so... probably won't spend that much on it. don't get me wrong, i thoroughly enjoyed the beer, but it didn't stand out as spectacular to me"
"D- Superb drinkability. I was told this beer is the imitation and the closest thing available to the St. Sixtus Abbey's Westvlerteren 12. Excellent beer, and wishing to find more closer to home."
"O: this a complex but good tasty sipper beer, so make sure you enjoy it slowly."
"I hate the phrase complex for beer BUT, this beer is that. But a very smooth finish I love this beer. I wish to I could find this beer in a bottle. I live in central FL and other than the WOB that just opened we're very limited on great beer variety."
"O - Its just ludacris good. I mean its hard to make a better beer than this. Its so balanced and well done. God bless teh monks."
"O: Awesome. Not quite Rochefort 10, but one of the best and most flavorful beers I have encountered."
"It's easy to see why this one is regarded as being among the top few Belgian quadrupels; I would need to try it alongside Rochefort 10 to remember which I prefer. Extremely drinkable for its strength, I could happily finish this whole bottle to myself. This stuff must age incredibly well."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice. Dark brown with a thick inch of foam that seems to last forever. When I first put the glass to my nose all I could smell was green apple, wonderful. The taste is just amazing. Carmel, dark fruit some green apple. Had to describe. Mouthfeel is medium with lots of carbonation. Halfway through the glass and there's still a quarter inch of foam. This may be one of the best beers I've ever had. Simply amazing."
"Nice drink overall but I have had better."
"O- A sipper for sure. The grape soda flavor and aroma was pretty surprising for me and not quite what I expected."
"Simply put, this is a great beer. Very flavorful, and goes down easy. I may have a new top 5 favorite, this is a wonderful beer."
"O - Good ""Dubbel"" as described on the bottle with plenty of flavor, I don't think (despite the alcohol content) that this is a quad."
"On draft, served in a St. Bernardus Chalice. A dark non-transparent color, not black more of a dark brown and doesn’t have the consistency that the other quads I’ve tried have had. Much less viscous than the other quads I’ve had which really surprised me as I expected this to be very heavy and it turned out much lighter. Tastes like a dark Belgium, with smells of fruit (figs) and some dark malt. Mouthful was pleasant and warm; alcohol taste isn’t overpowering but adds a complexity. Overall a good beer, not as tasty as Rochefort 10 or the other quads I’ve had but a solid Belgian none the less."
"O- good beer. Not quite as good as I thought it would be from all the hype, but still alright."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. Nothing too exciting but I would have another if the opportunity presented itself, I would have it. Wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again though."
"O - A beautiful good beer, good every time. This beer I keep standard on stock."
"Burnt sienna with about an inch of head. Great retention as you drink. The aroma reveals malty brown sugar notes with raisins and musky fruit. The flavor is sweet and bready, with the 10% alcohol content well-hidden. Unlike many Quads - this one seems to be a drinkable 'crowd pleaser,' so bonus points. The bubbly mouthfeel is not very heavy or earthy. A staple in my fridge."
"O- A quintessential belgian quad, incredibly drinkable, i wish i could have cases and cases of this stuff, it is easily enjoyed at any time of the day and easily one of my top 10 favorite beers, it also helps that it is pretty widely available."
"The mouthfeel is highly cabonated, slightly tart, and a big Belgian flavor from the yeast. It is a tad watery, very warming, and very filling. The sweetness actually makes my mouth water as I drink it. Very good, but not great."
"(Note: This tasting was done immediately after a side-by-side between Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10; this beer had a decidedly more impressive head but was less impressive on the aroma/taste than that other two.)"
"Overall - A great strong brew. Typical smooth fruity Belgian. Favorite of the St. Bernardus as of yet."
"Overall, this is one heck of a rich beer. I understand why this is such a classic brew, and I was very happy to try this one. Quads are not typically a style I seek out, but this beer's gorgeous complexity is something to behold; I recommend every beer lover try this example of excellent craftsmanship."
"T: complex, maty sweetness, toast and chocolate, moderately dry on the finish, throat warming, medium full bodied beer"
"Taste not too different from the smell except for a caramel/coffe aftertaste. Would love to cellar this and taste the different complexities. Overall not a bad start"
"D. Pleasant and complex. As it warms the carbonation dies down a bit and complexities come out on the nose and on the tongue. Quite good."
"O > I have to say this and the Rochefort's 10 and 8 are my Kings of the Suds!!!"
"The nose is of figs, cellar dust, and molasses laden sugars. These odors continue onto the palette while adding notes of spice and clove. Mouthfeel is a full robust body with enough attenuation to keep it from being cloying. Overall this is an outstanding beer that warrants plenty of time to contemplate. Unless your liver is well trained don't open the 750 alone."
"Just had on tap the other night and it was sensational. Very enjoyable brew. It's right up there with La Trappe, Rochefort, and Achel."
"Great beer! Extremely flavorful and complex. Even better as it warms."
"Medium to full bodied with good carbonation, this beer is as sippable as it is gulpable. The body is nice and light considering the flavors, giving this beer a very refreshing quality. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and does not get in the way of the flavors at all."
"O: overall a nice brew.. as it warms the flavors open up more & make it very drinkable.."
"Overall: Really great beer. Unbelievably smooth in the smell and the taste. Not anything comes to mind that I would want to change."
"This beer is awesome! It's pretty easy to find in the States, and it has everything going for it. This is the type of beer that can be aged and brought out for special occasions, or just as a nice way to end the night. There's a reason Belgians are so well respected when it comes to beer - this beer is one of those reasons. "
"O - Really enjoyed this beer, thought it had many qualities of a great beer...and it tastes very good"
"Overall, I think this is a solid quad and not too strong as one might expect from this type."
"O: Fantastic beer!!! A very satisfying quad, that I would defiantly buy and recommend."
"O - Not bad. Not my fave for the style, but surprisingly mellow and subdued for what can be a very aggressive style."
"O: top of the bill in this style."
"O: Everything is just right in the center it's so great to drink. It's never overbearing so I recommend it to those who are thinking about starting to drink quads. The dry finish is probably what makes it so easy to drink despite the 10% abv. A greatly balanced Quad indeed."
"O- A great beer for sure, very complex with a fantastic appearance and mouthfeel, only thing that could really be improved is the addition of more dark fruit flavors. Great though!"
"O: A phenomenal brew, so complex yet so smooth and simple, lives up to the hype and so much more, truly defines the style. Incredible!"
"O: A spectacular beer. To be honest, I enjoyed it better in the wine glass than the Chalice. Satisfying, good alcohol warmth throughout, wonderful tastes and smells, and easy to drink, though, for me, it's a sipper."
"Pours the darkest mahogany hue which leaves a creamy two finger head that stays and leaves clingy lacing here and there,the smell is baked bread,fruit cake,honey and raisins,it has a creamy mouthfeel and feels just like liquid bread with tastes of baked bread,belgian yeast,raisins soaked in honey,apricot jam and finished with a candied fig sweetness and overall its definately a tasty drop and true to style would drink again."
"I absolutely love this beer and would drink it anytime, anywhere. Highly, highly recommended."
"I can see why this is a classic & at $8.99 - $1.00 (coupon) = $7.99 from Total Wine & More, I highly recommend it. Hall of Fame Beer in my opinion."
"O: I have only tried two Quads so perhaps it is too soon for me to say that Iove this style, but I love this style. Great flavors. Something I would order again without a second thought."
"in the final analysis the abt 12 is not only one of my favorite quads, it's probably a top-ten (ok, maybe 20) candidate for favorite beer. still think it falls short of the likes of rochefort 10, and probably pannepot old fisherman's."
"D: Oh, quite low. This is 10% after all."
"2009 Bottle in my hotel room in DC - Pours a hazy dk amber with a large sandy head...aroma is dark and fruity, raisin, figgy, sweet caramel and very light spice...the particles in the lacing left on my glass looks like cinnamon to the point where I almost taste it...aroma is similar, dark and doughy malt, dried fruit, yeast and vanilla, light alcohol bite...holds its own against any quad as far as I’m concerned..."
"(O) Definite different from American quads. Very good stuff."
"O - This is a great quad, right behind Rochefort 10."
"Overall anA+ from me."
"O - A FANTASTIC beer. My favorite quad to date. I guess I'll have to try Westy 12 and see if that one takes the title."
"O: This is a great quad, but I still think rochefort 10 reigns supreme in this category."
"O: This is a spectacular beer. I suggest everybody should try this one. This is a great example of a quad."
"Overall: This is in my top 3 beer list of all time and is a cant-miss. The bottles are easier to find and are well worth the $11.00 price, but if you can find this on tap, this is a brilliant beer. Cheers!!"
"Overall, just fantastic. Better than my high expectations."
"Narrative: “GOD DAMNIT IT, EVERY holiday” “Hey Steve, lower your voice” “OK, every holiday party he does this” Their eyes surveyed the Christmas party and noted several women at the beckon call of a single aged man with a clear graying cul de sac. “HOW DOES HE DO IT!” Steve exclaimed in exasperation. “Come on man, he wears a bold orange robe to parties, talks to women like he’s been drinking 12% beer all day and all night, and performs mild miracles; how do you not love him?” The two watched from their sulking position as old Abby 12 pulled a bottle of Svedka from his robe sleeve. “OK COME ON THAT ISNT EVEN GOOD VODKA!” Both guffawed in disbelief as he chastely rebuffed a woman’s advances and deftly cited passages from the book of Ruth. “RUTH! COME ON WHO KNOWS RUTH!” Steven bemoaned."
"Mouthfeel was rich, full bodied, slick, with fairly tangy carbonation for a quad and a powerful alcohol warming. Liked this one a bit better than the Rochefort 10 which are the only two quad's I've ever had. Great beer."
"Smooth, thick body with low carbonation despite the vigorous head. The only detractor is the ABV. The 10% is well hidden, but it still makes it presence known."
"Overall, this is another great example of a Quad and I will be revisiting this brew in the upcoming colder months of winter. Just not much of a summer brew here."
"Overall: A very good quad, I personally feel it is way better than Rochefort 10. I wouldn't change a thing about it."
"The appearance is better than the label...once poured into my glass the dark flavorful color entices the senses. The smell was more of an odor unfortuantely almost medicinal,wont be coughing tonight. Thankfully the taste is better than the smell,a nice vibrant tingling,as I tippled. Should have a ninja on the label....thought this beer was kinda dead..but then ""pow""..nice malty,breads..and fruits with a good balance of tangy hops and alcohol. Almost makes me want to become a monk and move to Belgium. To me this is a seasonal taste,however,better in front of a fire, and snow outside. Its 104 degrees outside right now so maybe i should have waited and reviewed this @ winter."
"O - I would really like to try this beer with some age."
"Overall, an outstanding Belgian ale. Very rich, dark, sweet flavors. The vanilla really stands out but I get hints of anise/licorice. Another example of a very strong Belgian ale that is way too easy to drink. Delicious!"
"o - a very nice example of the style, as well as a great beer in general. not a session beer by any means, but a wonderful beer to sip on and enjoy the complex flavor. i have three more bottles of this that i am planning to age for a couple of years."
"Overall: Wish I could afford this one every weekend. Truly one of the top tastes in beers. A sit down, sip and enjoy experience. This is what drinking beer is all about."
"One of the very few quads I have tried, but right now one of the best. I have a few bottles aging and I look forward to popping them open in a few years."
"O This is one of my favorite beers that I have had. It's just a delicious, smooth and complex beer and it's available all year round."
"Overall-Much better now then it was a few years ago when I tried it last, didn't really understand this beer before. The only thing I wish is for the carbonation to not be so strong."
"O- This is a BIG beer, perfect example of a Belgian Quadrupel, a sipper meant to be enjoyed at 50-55 F, incredible aromas emanate throughout"
"Pours a hazy dark tea like color (or a dirty brown red), light brown head which quickly goes away. The smell is good mostly sweet dark fruity yeast esters, and rich malt. Feel is medium thickness lots of tingly carbonation. Taste is excellent a sweet malty / fruit blend on the tongue, but plenty of dryness on the way down and it finishes with a slight alcohol burn. Overall another excellent beer, I feel lucky that I bought a 4 pack and have 3 more of these babies left!"
"O- What can I say that has not already been said, big complex world class beer, always a pleasure to drink and share with others."
"O- A great example of the style, but nothing extraordinary. I need to compare it side-by-side to rochefort 10, which I may do right now... I'd have another though :)"
"O: too fruity for my taste but seems to be on par for a quad. Had to search for the beer taste in this one. Probably won't be going back to this one."
"Overall: I tried this one next to a Trappistes Rochefort 10 to compare the two, and this one definitely lost out. I was expecting slightly different, yet excellent, interpretations of the same style, but this one let me down a bit. I'm suspecting possible issues as a result of poor storage during & after transportation, so I'll give this one another try sometime, and will report back."
"Overall - This is one of my favourite quads, never disappoints, a worthy beverage on a cold winter's night."
"O- This beer is fantastic, this is why I bought a 64oz of it!"
"Pours brown with a light tan head. Many aromas including fruits, spices and brown sugar. Many fruity flavors in the taste including plums and apples, as well as caramel and cloves. Almost creamy and silky. An excellent overall beer, one of the finest examples of the style."
"Overall - a classic Belgian and a wonderful beer, especially as it warms up a bit. St. Bernardus knows their stuff."
"Overall Drinkability - Sort of like a cross between a quad and a tripel. Body and flavor of a 12. But ABV taste of a tripel. Very good, but still underwelming considering this is compared to Westy 12 sometimes."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with light barely making its way through, there is also a nice fluffy tannish colored head that sticks around for a while. The smell is a a little bit sweeter and less yeasty spiciness than the rochefort 10 i sampled it with. the flavor is a bit sweeter and the dark fruity raisin flavor comes through a bit more, the mouthfeel is slightly fuller than the rochefort, and all around I think this beer is slightly more balanced between alcohol presence, yeast spiciness and sweetness from candied sugars."
"Overall: An excellent Belgian and one that has inspired me to seek more beers of this style. I truly look forward to drinking this one again."
"Pours--preferably into a chalice, and more preferably into a signature chalice--a deep carameled mahogany color with a firm, creamy half inch of ivory head that retains through the session, and leaves beautiful lacing. When you see a beer presented like this, it's just...this is what beer is supposed to look like. This is craftmanship. Aroma is rich with dark sugars, dark fruits, and spicy Belgian yeast. Taste of toasted bread, with lots of brown sugar up front, along with dark dried fruits--raisins, figs, plums--caramel, tobacco, almond, subtle hop spiciness, and an ubiquitous alcohol bite. Not heavy, but full-bodied, and highly drinkable."
"In my mind, this is near perfection for the style and for beer in general."
"Mouthfeel: Though medium bodied, it's very creamy and smooth. Dangerously drinkable for a beer of it's abv."
"mouthfeel - creamy and smooth, very drinkable. glad i was sharing. i see the rave now."
"Overall - Very happy with this beer, I've had other Quads that left something to be desired but this one really hits it out of the park."
"O-I've had this many times before I stopped and thought, ""wow this is a great beer!"" It's has such a good and warming complex flavor. It's a great quad that is difficult to match. I'll always come back to this."
"O - This was a good beer. I love Belgian style beer and this was my first venture into Quads. I feel like it probably does the style good justice but I still want to try the Rochefort variety and maybe someday the Westy. I don't think I''l be heading for too many more quads in the beer cooler; they're expensive(!) and I figure I'm more of a Tripel kind of guy anyways."
"O: a good beer. will recommend to friends."
"Overall: I'm not a big fan of quads but this is an exemplary example of the style. nothing in this beer attempts to steal the show but all aspects work together perfectly. This review actually doesn't do this beer justice."
"Smelled very similar to many other belgian beers I have tried. Classic dark fruit, malts and yeast. Flavor was similar with dark fruit caramel and toffee with sweet malt and yeast. Creamy and think on the palate and just a touch of bitters to it. overall a good beer. enjoyed this one."
"O: great quad, one of my favorites."
"O- Very good drink. Wish the sweetness wouldn't have been as strong along with the carbonation. However the flavors are very well done. Easy to drink for sure, wouldn't mind another glass or two!"
"Overall, this is my beer if the Rochefort 10 is not available. While I was in Belgium, one of the tour guides said this is a great alternative to the Westy. Since I haven't had it, I'll have to take his word on it."
"O- definitely will buy a few more bottles and attempt to be patient and cellar a bottle or two or ten for up to 15 years, per the bottle's suggestion. Definitely worth a try and perhaps my new favorite quad!"
"Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. A very well-brewed beer. The only reason this was not rated higher was the bitterness that I tasted when I first drank the beer. I personally enjoy more of the sweet notes in the beer as compared to any bitterness."
"overall, definitely a standard for the Quad style"
"O- This is an excellent example of how a Quad should taste like. I can see why it is ranked so high. It is definitely work the price. I would recommend this to anyone."
"11.2 oz into a snifter...first, let me say...HOLY FUCKING AWESOME...this is an incredible beer...huge lively head on top of a deep brown body. Excellent head retention. Smell is excellent Belgian malt and balancing hops with a strong yeast character. Taste should be massive with this much malt for alcohol, but instead it is rich but incredibly smooth with a different beginning and end. Mouthfeel is flawless. Absolutely as smooth as glass on your tongue, perfect. Overall, amazing."
"Overall - Did I die and go to heaven?"
"Great dessert beer. Rich and perks up the taste buds."
"D- This was a yummy beer My wife and I both loved it. For the price i would buy Trappistes Rochefort 10."
"From all aspects, Abt. 12 has become increasing popular. My local beer merchant is not a big fan of the beer due to this fact. He prides himself on helping people discover new beers, and it is difficult for him to see people get stuck on one beer, like many have with this quad. However, overall this is a great example of a dark, rich quad Belgium."
"I’m generally not a fan of belgian beers but had to give this one a try because of its rep. Had it on tap and it was very good. Smooth, malty, fruity and noticable alcohol. Tried it in the bottle a couple days later and it was a bit too carbonated for me. Great beer overall though."
"Overall: This is a very nice Quad, and one that is well suited for the price. A classic example for the style and staple in the Bernardus family. This beer has been enjoyed on many occasions, but really shines when given a detailed analysis."
"O--This is one of my favorite beers. Quads are a wonderful style, and this is an excellent example of the style."
"O - solid beer, but difficult to drink. Ranked #8 of 10. Disappointing because I generally love this beer. 4.5/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"O - wow, very unique. I would definetly have this again."
"O - Really love this quad. Will be one of my measuring sticks for the style."
"Overall - A this was probably one of the best beers i have had in while and worth the $10 for a pint"
"I am adding this to my next pickup list."
"I enjoyed it, it was very much what I hoped for and I will revisit. Big props as well for absolute ease in finding this brew basically anywhere craft beer can be found."
"O: Well, if you’re having this beer with a homemade dinner, you’d better be a killer cook – this will likely outshine any of your culinary creations. This is on a completely different level when it comes to beer; I only wish we had more breweries like in the states. This was truly a landmark in my beer journey, and when I get a cellar, this will certainly be one of my first additions for aging purposes. If you haven’t had it, spend the extra money and get it TODAY – you won’t regret it!"
"Pours a hazy dark brown color with a big 3 inch light brown head that fades to a thin cap. Broken rings of lace mark the glass on the drink down. There is some sediment floating around in the beer. Smells of dark fruits, some malty bread, and spices. Taste is very much like the smell with the dark ripe fruits, bready malts, spices (clove/cinnamon), and some yeast flavors. There is a good level of carbonation in this one with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. This makes the beer very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this is a very good quad with a very nice smell and taste. Definitely deserves its spot in the top 5 of the style."
"Overall I do like this beer a lot, but I find that compared to the other ""famous"" qauds this one is probably my least favorite, though that doesn't mean much when you figure the other ones are Rochefort 10, Westy 12, etc. Great stuff."
"Good stuff, would like another."
"Overall a wonderful brew and one that I would highly reccomend. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall this was a very very good beer."
"Brown color with a whitish head, nice fine carbonation. Aromas are bold, big roasty malt and dark fruit. Caramel and chocoalte faintly waft in and out. Flavor is intense and fullbodied. Huge malt front of syrup and waffles with a boozy caramel undertone. Very complex, roasted malt, Chocolate candies, plum, raisin, and booze. Mouthfeel is slightly hot, but the rich sweet malt matches up nicely and melds to a smooth finish that lingers for minutes. Killer brew."
"M - Not thick like an imperial stout, but not too thin either. Nicely balanced with a dry, but sticky finish. When served at the proper recommended temperature (52-56 F) the alcohol is fairly noticeable as a warmth that runs from the back of the palate all the way to the chest."
"Overall: One of the best of the Belgian Dark Strong/Quad category. Amazing stuff."
"D-Overall id like to have this again. This was my 1st quad and it was alittle strong for me. Id like to try it in a few months and see if my taste buds enjoy it more then. Overall it was a good beer but alittle too bitter for me."
"Pours a deep brown some light foam that sticks around. Nose of dark fruit, fig and raisin bread. Tastes amazing; rich dark fruit, plum, raisin, toffee, some booze. Mouthfeel is nice, both creamy and crisp. Close to the perfect beer. A must try."
"This is a lovely brew. Delicate, powerful, rich, buoyant, elegant, and approachable. Just lovely."
"O: An interesting beer. High in alcohol but very sweet and drinkable"
"Nice two finger head of light brownish red foam. Thick lace with moderate clinging power. Color is a 22 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is sweet, with fragrances of raisins, currents, plums, brown sugar, toffee, roasted coffee, and molasses. Taste is quite sweet, with flavors of brown sugar, clove, raisins, plum, apricot, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, but lacking a good deal of carbonation prickly sensation. Great beer overall, nice warming feeling from the goodly amount of alcohol. A little pricey, but worth another sample down the road."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer, and I would definitely recommend everybody who hasn't tried it to get themselves a bottle. This is an ""Abbey Ale"" which is said to be the clone of the Westvletern 12, and if it really is, then I can only imagine how good the Westy 12 taste..."
"Overall: Worth it. The only downside is how much this beer costs."
"The beer with obvious good aging potential has been sitting in my cellar for nearly a year and a half but still seems to need additional time for maturation, so a re-review is pending for this one. A gusher pours airy beige head with poor retention that quickly dissipates. The coppery brown body initially exhibits good clarity but gets hazed and flooded with yeasty floaties with the consecutive pourings. Aroma is an interplay of malty sweetness, fruity esters, alcohol and spiciness. The rich malt with caramel and bread crust qualities embeds strong fruity esters of grape, perfumy, spicy alcohol that flares out and peppery spiciness from yeast-derived phenols. The flavor is non-excessive malty sweetness counterbalanced by alcohol, then comes the bread crust, grape-like fruitiness and prominent peppery spiciness. Finish is medium-dry with light bitterness and alcohol warmth. Medium-light bodied with fine, effervescent carbonation that quickly dissipates leaving flat texture behind. Not as good as I remember it to be and far from my conception of the secular-version of Westvelteren 12. Too thin, with poorly masked alcohol and fruitiness limited to grapes, lacking heavenly orchard of all kind of ripe dark fruits and almond character that once possessed - or I'm just getting more demanding? (330 ml, BB date reads 17. December 2014, into the St. Bernardus goblet.)"
"YOU MUST TRY THIS BEER!!"
"750mL with best before date of 01.07.15 poured into a Chimay chalice. Hazy brown color with a soft tan head. The aroma has raisins and other dark fruit, molasses, yeast and spices. Huge dark fruity flavor, this is very sweet but well balanced. Really, really nice. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and well carbonated. Just a great beer all around. Thanks wordemupg for this one."
"O- This is a world class beer. Period. I think I reviewed an exceptional bottle, as I've had this beer many times before. This is a good bottle of it for sure. If you haven't had this beer, you owe it to yourself to try it. And if you don't 'get' this beer or the glowing reviews... well, that's more for me! It really doesn't get much better than this. Cheers."
"O: Killer"
"O: Great all around trappist ale, one of my favorites. Sweet, complex and highly drinkable. One of the top Belgian beers that I can get on a regular basis."
"Overall: A tasty sweet and well balanced Belgian Quad."
"O- Well this is very good. I do want more but am glad I didn't drive all the way to Quebec for it. Great beer but I still feel let down."
"O- overall my wife and I really enjoyed this one and will revisit it often, This one is great and you'd never go wrong bringing this to a dinner party or as a gift to special friends. An excellent example of the style"
"Dark brown body with a reddish edge towards the bottom of the glass. An off white head sticks around for a while and leaves some pretty lacing. Subtle aroma of plums, dark fruit, candy sugar and some booze. Great flavors with some ebb and flow: grapes, slight dark fruit, medicinal notes, slight spice, warming booze, slight caramel towards the finish with some dryness. Zapping carbonation with a medium body. A hell of a Belgian potion."
"Anyway, another nice beer these folks. Well worth a try. Highly drinkable for a 10.5% beer."
"Overall it's interesting but I was expecting a bigger nose on this. It does feel very much like a sipper that's for sure. Checking my notes and re-examining the bottle says ""dubbel"" and this feels more like one, but probably not a fav."
"Overall-this is the best Quad I've ever had-yes this includes Westvleteren 12. Excellent-if you like Quads and haven't tried this one-this is one you have to try a bottle of. This is one beer I'll be craving. Glad that it is fairly accessible."
"D - excellent drinkability and delicious beer in a smooth sophisticated way , where every sip is to be enjoyed"
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of flavors that stay really well balanced, and also don't make the beer feel too heavy. The 10.5 abv here really stays in the background and makes it almost a bit dangerous."
"O - my go to quad in terms of availability and overall, this beer is a classic. A must have!"
"o 3.5 great anticipation. modest experience."
"Value: An incredible beer worth pretty much any price."
"From the bottle....Super Belgian Quad. Nice spicy nose that includes belgian sweets, phenols, and belgian yeast. Dark brownish color, pours with highly carbonated but thin head. Spicy and fruity tones accompanied by Belgian yeast and candy sugar. Pretty sweet, even for Belgian. I really enjoyed this and will drink again."
"O - A great beer to sip and savor."
"D - No doubt, this is a sipper beer, yet the drinkability within one serving is pretty high. Enjoy in moderation, and this will be pretty easy to drink!"
"O: Really good beer, very impressed. This is my first quad and I think it will be a style that I seek out more. Really easy drinking."
"Taste is rich and complex. Toffee and bread, caramel, raisins, dates, pears, and tea. Creamy, earthy, and rich beer. Delicious."
"Pours a creamy nut brown color with a thin layer of off white head with an ok amount of retention and little lacing. The aroma is strong with ripe cherry and prune characteristics. The taste starts with a hint of malt and then bring a strong grape juice flavor. The mouthfeel tingled slightly with carbonation, but finished dry and clean. Overall a good quad... Wish I could try it from the source."
"O - Very nice easy sipper. Could hang out with a full pour for about 45 minutes. I enjoy this quad quite a bit. Many consider it to be the gold standard, and I agree. Very good representation of the style. Would like to build up a nice collection and eventually do a year to year comparison."
"Overall this is an excellent quad, with exceptionally complex taste, a very nice appearance, an aromatic nose, and a smooth mouthfeel. It is one of my all time favorites, and well worth spending an evening on."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. One of my favorite Dark Strong Ales/Quads."
"O - Great Belgian beer, another of my favorites. Glad this is so easy to come by."
"D: This beer is outstanding. I was surprised by the quality provided the volumes they kick out. Very good beer."
"This is a very flavorful beer, there much to experience. I will definitely have this again."
"CHEERS"
"D- I truly believe that this would be better off in the cellar for a while. Bring it bak out in about a year,should mellow and blend a bit better."
"Medium in body but has an champagne like quality from the carbonation, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen until you start to feel it. A sipping beer to be sure but damn drinkable"
"D - Pretty good. I like quad's, and this one is no different, but they really wear on me over the course of the glass. The combo of high price, $8 for this snifter...ouch!, and the strong booze really bring the drinkability down."
"D - Really high but lacking in flavours I would typically expect from a Quad."
"D - Really nice drinkability for a quad, too bad I'm driving 4.5"
"A great beer from a great brewer. I also thought I should mention that I really love this beer."
"DRINKABILITY: This was a memorable beer that I wouldn't hesitate to drink again, or recommend for a single brew on a special occasion. The taste in particular wowed me and I plan on buying it again."
"D- If this was all I had to drink for the rest of my life, That'd be fine."
"Until I get my paws on Westy 12, this is my gold standard quad."
"D - This has good drinkability. It tastes good and goes down easy. I think this is a really good beer, and I would definitely try this one again."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, which is kinda dangerous due to the high ABV. It only has the slightest hint of a bitter aftertaste, which may be the alcohol, but not at all unpleasant. I'd definitely have another!"
"The CPJ"
"D: Dangerously good. The more you drink the easier they get."
"Some people say this is one of the best beers in the world. I won't be buying it again, however."
" D- Strong beer, but one that lasts as a quality beer. And to a person like me, these are the type of beers that we savor and enjoy with such a high ABV. Cant drink a 6 pack but it is a great brew to sit back and relax with."
"D - At 10.5 ABV this is still real easy to drink. but something stops you because you want to savor it. Go out and buy this now."
"D- Despite some small mouthfeel issues the drinkability is still very good. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and the beer goes down smooth despite its complexity"
"Mouthfeel is truly phenomenal. The texture is perfectly creamy and whipped, the body is as full as it gets, and the combination of the cooling start and warming finish makes this an easy five. Drinkability is great, regardless of the 10.5% abv (which makes this beer that much more admirable). Goes down easy, has every flavor you could ask for without any of them in excess or shortage. I can't get over the fantastic contrast between refreshing and warming in each individual sip. This beer is a work of art. Can get a bit strong on the back end of each sip, but that's just nitpicking. This beer is special."
"Overall - I thought it was just a solid beer. I didn't find it to be spectacular, but I think it captures the essence of the style and is just a remarkably good and drinkable beer. One interesting thing, I found the first few drinks to be a lot better than the rest, it was if the palate ""adjusted"" to the overall complexities of this beer"
"Very drinkable for a 10.50% alcohol quad. This beer is definitely world class and would highly recommend it."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 was dark brown in color (hazy red brown when held to a light). It had a beige head with great retention and lots of lacing. The smell was dark fruit, dark malt, and yeast. The taste was dried fruit, yeast,some dark malt and alcohol. The finish was long, dry, a bit fruity, malty, and warming. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and high carbonation. The drinkability was good. This is a good Belgian Ale and worth a try."
"I would definitely buy this again next time i go to the store. I advise you to do the same."
"D - It's not surprising Westvleteren saw fit to give St Bernardus the brewing rights to their beer because this is an absolute treasure that I rate on just blow the West 12 itself."
"Drinkability: very good, i had 2 that i bought but i push my self not to open another"
"I've drank quite a few of these over the years, so I decided to review this Belgian beauty. Fantastic beer, a real original. The smell is light sweet sherry or similar to a well aged scotch with yeast. The taste is sweet and has almost a grape jam quality, in the best way, up front and a dried apricot or raisin finish. Lite hops. Even though the alcohol is very well hidden and is warming, this is a sipping beer."
"Pours a dense, deep oak brown, with some sediment floating around, plenty of head that dissipates readily. Aromas of grains and caramels flow from the carbonation like a thick brewing wort. Every drink assaults the taste buds with chewy caramel, molasses, and ripened fruits, while some spice becomes more evident in the swallow and finish. The carbonation dances off the tongue as it's going down, finishing you off with a warming, slightly dry finish. Exceptional flavor, with complex character that's not matched in many places outside of Belgium. Packs a pretty serious punch, probably best with some food in the stomach and enjoyed on a cold winter's eve--or you could do it like me and have it on an empty stomach when its 80 degrees out :) Still just as good."
"D: Sipper, not a chugger, simply from the alcohol. Oh yes, you'll want to chug... be warned. Very warming on a cool night. Would pair nicely with pumpernickel bread, hearty butter and a good cheese like stilton or roquefort."
"Conclusion: Again, there is a lot going on with this beer. One can tell it is the culmination of years of development. It is a rich, complex beer that needs a couple of sessions to really appreciate the nuances and complexity. I consider this to be in my all-round top 10 list and I always keep an ample supply to break out and enjoy with friends."
"Having now tried all three of the big quads, I'd rank St. Bernardus above Rochefort 10 but below Westvleteren 12."
"great all around belgian dark ale. this is one of my favorite styles and i enjoy trying many of them. this is definitely a sipper and one to sit back and enjoy the aroma and yummy goodness. nice mouthfeel and drinkability as well. appearance was a deep brown with a creamy head."
"Poured a beautiful dark reddish brown. Had a light fizzy head that reduced quickly but stuck around throughout. Lots going on in the nose, fruity and sweet, with a hint of alcohol as well. Flavor here is excellent, sweet and malty with fruit notes. Could pick out toffee and bready flavors, as well as apple and grape. Finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated, which fits well with the dry finish. Drinkability here could be trouble at over 10% abv as the alcohol is well hidden and the overall balance makes it easy to drink. Can definitely sneak up on you after a couple glasses. Great example of the style, and one I can see picking up regularly."
"High ABV mostly hidden."
"D - It's a big beer. High alcohol content, and heavy. It's a beautiful, wonderful beer. But I can't put down more than one or two. The flavor kinda hangs with you, instead of finishing clean like other styles. That's good and bad. I love the flavor, but after a while I want something else."
"T: Lots of sweet malts and spices. Bready aftertaste along with a pleasant warming sensation. Alcohol is hidden really well and I could drink this all day. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel is amazing. This is a fantastic beer."
"If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this could be the one!"
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability: This is a great, great quad, definitely one of my favorites. I usually have at least a bottle or two of these in my cellar at all times, it's one of my few staple beers I keep around. Highly recommend."
"D - It just gets better as it warms, a sipper, but an amazingly delicious and balanced brew"
"For the high ABV this is a very drinkable beer, I probably won't be drinking it again due to the price."
"D - Excellent quad with substantial ABV kick. I highly recommend it."
"Pours a medium dark brown, some amber when held up to the light, with a two-three finger light tan head which has excellent retention and lacing. Appears unfiltered. The nose is full of fruit with a light floral scent along with the belgian caramely malts. Flavors include some raisin, toffee and darker fruits. Sweet malts with brown sugar and caramel notes are dominant on the palate. Slight yeast presence along with a slight alcohol finish but not overwhelming, particularly since this is 10% ABV. Fairly high carbonation, perfect for the style, yet strangely full-bodied due to the malts, an excellent mouthfeel. In terms of drinkability, this beer is top notch for a belgian. I'm not one to down a couple belgian ales, but with this beer, I might consider it. Great complexity yet smooth, this is one of the highest quality ales I've had in a long time."
"A lovely beer. Loaded with a delicate balance of flavours. Very nice."
"Overall, it's not a bad beer by any means. Never having tried a quad before, my opinion may not be completely sound but I think this beer is quite overrated. To me, it just tastes alot like a stronger alcohol European ale with slightly more depth than a standard lager."
"This was an excellent beer to be enjoyed by anyone. I won't be making it a personal favorite any time soon, but I will always appreciate how good it is."
"All in all, exceptional is the only word to describe it."
"Update: This one is truly one of the greats. I picked up a 4-pack of this puppy for $ 19.99 because I can't overstate how much I enjoy it. Only 1 of 2 beers to get my ""Perfect 5"" rating. Truly epic stuff. I could drink this all day long if not for the ABV and the price. One of very few beers that has you smiling and saying ""ahhh!!!"" upon the very first sip. Truly under-appreciated vs some of the more well know Belgians that don't come close to this IMHO. If the First Miracle involved beer instead of wine....it likely would have tasted like this!!"
"D- I gotta get some more of this!!! Not an everyday drinker... but not a special occasion drinker either! A perfect beer with a piece of devils food cake, or pastrami on pumpernickel with swiss and mustard!!! DAMN!!!"
"Aroma of fig, souring grapes, clove, some dark fruit. Taste is phenomenally balanced and delicious, leaving loads of spice on the palate. More taste of very sweet malts, lots of honey, raisins, Belgian yeast....the rest is a mystery. Gets spicier when getting to the bottom of the bottle. This is an instant classic."
"Found on tap at the trappist in downtown oakland. Grreat beer. Smooth taste, not overly floral. Decieving how well the flavors and brewmanship covers the massive abv(10.5). If you ever come accross this top ten beeradvocate rated belgian, order it! I know I will."
"These things can age up to about 15 years, may want to grab another bottle or two and let them age some."
"NOTE:Serve a little warmer then you expect"
"Overall its way above average. One of my favorites for sure."
"What else to say? This is a great beer. I haven't yet tasted the offerings from Rochefort & Westvleteren, but thus far this is the best Quadruple I've had yet."
"Overall- Quite tasty now, should get even better and more complex with a few years on it, time to throw some in the cellar. At about 10% this is almost too easy to drink!"
"CHEERS! :)"
"D- It did not take me terribly long to polish off a 750ml bottle of this- it goes down very nicely! However, the alcohol catches up quickly."
"Amazingly after a whole bottle I still haven't reviewed this beer as thoroughly as I would like. Also amazingly, I Haven't had a quad in ages, or even a bsda. Certainly I enjoy hops to be more dominant, but these complex Belgians have a lot to be desired."
"Very good quad, but just didn't compare to Westy 12 and Rochefort 10."
"Drinkability is good, its good to drink the 750, but not something that lives up to the hype."
"A real treat, and one I was glad to grab the last couple bottles of from the local LCBO."
"Pours an opaque brown 3/4"" white head sits on top that eventually settles an coats the top of the beer until the end. Brussels lace appears right away. Nose is of sweet yeast, dark fruit, fig and almost a fresh bread presence. Taste of rich dark fruit, plum, raisin, toffee, an almost nutty taste is there, slight alcohol. Good mouthfeel not offensive in any way. Drinks like a dream, very close to perfect."
"Drink - Surely one of the better beers I have ever had. Definitely worth seeking out."
"The end."
"Clove, brown sugar, and malt abound in the taste. Really opens up as it gets into the suggested serving temperature (52-56F)."
"D - Very drinkable for the ABV."
"Pours a dark brown with ample carbonation and sea foam two finger head. The lacing is very nice as well. The nose is a little weak but detectable are belgian yeast, malt and candied sweetness. The taste is the same as the nose with the abv masked nicely. The mouthfeel is a velvety light to medium body and the drinkability is high."
"This bottle is roughly a year old and was poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a snifter. This beer poured a dark and murky, raisin brown with a three finger, beautiful beige foamy head that just sat atop the brew for about five minutes. It looks like a Root Beer float. The smell is very soft and exceptionally smooth. It is pure yeast and sooo bready with very light and subtle sweet malt. The flavor is kind of hard to describe. Let me begin by saying that it is amazing. It's kind of funky and has light spicyness to it. It's very yeasty and full of bready malt. There is a light presence of alcohol but it's every so slight. Wow. This is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. It tingles the palate initially before melting in your mouth. It's perfect as far as mouthfeel goes. It's also very, very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and all aspects of the Abt 12 are well rounded and complex. This is definitely world class. I'm glad I could try this before my Westy 12, which I'm saving. I've been told that their recipes are near identical and this one didn't let me down at all. Excellent, excellent brew."
"D- Solid line of beers, great gift package"
"The effervescent carbonation carries with it caramel, dark fruits, a bit of toasted malt, light booziness and an earthy flavour I can't place. Wonderfully complex, all of the flavours I look for in a Belgian without the cloying sweetness. As it warms, plum/raisin flavours start to come out more, and the alcohol becomes slightly more perceptible, but not overly. Rich, medium to thick body that is nicely offset by the carbonation."
"D: Pretty high drinkability here, as these beer has complex, pleasant flavors. A tad on the sweet side though."
"D: Delightful. The taste and mouthfeel continue to be pleasant at every sip."
"What a great beer - I prefer this to the Rochefert 10 i had the night before, seems more balanced and I find it more drinkable. Cant wait to try the other bottle I have in the near future!"
"Pours a deep dark brown with hide off white foamy head that recedes quickly. Nose is dark fruits, bready malts, sugar. Taste is similiar to the nose; sweet candied dark fruit and some alcohol flavour. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, good carbonation and still a half finger of head constantly sticking around. A very enjoyable sipper, one I think I would prefer in the smaller format I've obtained than the bomber I usually see. Got 3 more bottles to age, a great highpoint for the style."
"D: The drinkability is pretty scary for the ABV."
"Food is excellent but the beers are off the hook."
"D - though it's a bit too strong to be repeatable it's very drinkable, has a good balance and harmony to it, is memorable and even has a wow factor to it"
"Surprisingly drinkable for a sweet belgian with high alc."
"10.50% ABV. Poured into tulip from 750ml bottle. Deep reddy brown, creamy beige head. Marzipan is the dominant component in the aroma and perhaps some almond or walnut on top of a really sweet smell. Soft carbonation, very velvetty palate. Maybe some alcohol showing. In the mouth, there is loads of almonds rising up retronasally, but less come through in the taste. Simple roasty graininess. With yeast, there is more roastiness, and without yeast there is more fruitiness and esters, which are beautifully heady. One of my favorite traditional quads!"
"D - Absolutely great drinkability. World class beer that is very easy to drink even with the ABV. Glad I finally got to have this one."
"A quintessential example of the style. Imminently drinkable."
"This beer pours a beautiful semi clear deep walnut color with an ecru foam that stays on the surface. The smell is rather faint some sourish orange notes in the aroma, not really super pleasant. The malty slight sour, spicy notes tend to work well with the beer. The mouthfeel is really nice and smooth, there is only a bit of acidity to it. It's a pretty good drinking beer, but I don't know if I would rate it as high as many are suggesting."
"D - At 10.5% ABV you won't be having too many in an evening. This is one to sit by a fire with a friend and solve the world's problems."
"Taste: Caramel malts and dry hopping are most noticeable to me. Dark fruits are more subdued than I expected."
"Overall, a marvelous beer. This might be my favorite quad I've had to date, even if it strikes me more as a dubbel with a quad's alcohol content. I am amazed that it was this good on tap and I am surprised I even saw it on tap. It was absolutely delicious and I am going to be getting a bottle of all of St Bernardus's offerings the next chance I get. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - What a fantastic beer, i would rate this beer right up there and great for the LCBO to put this on their shelves. This is a nice full bodied beer that brings your taste buds fwd."
"I'd get this again, but it would definitely have to be for a special occasion or something. A nice after-dinner drink to celebrate a promotion or something. I like session beers, but this is a nice treat."
"This just makes me want Rochefort 10 even more. I yearn for that mind-bending flavor, for that mouth-orgy."
"Oh god, this is awesome. One of the best 8 bucks I have ever spent. Thank you Liquor Max for providing me this beer."
"D - What can i say, its very drinkable to say the least. Its fairly up there in ABV, yet i don't feel like i need to go too slow with this one. What can i say about a beer that has already been beaten to death. Its all true. This is a great beer. I'm enjoying it as a desert beer after a great dinner."
"Poured from bottle into Goose Island tulip, expiration date is 2015. Pours an extremely hazy brown with burnt orange hues and a tan one finger head that fades to a cap with good retention and lacing. Smell is dominated by Belgian yeast, fruity banana and citrus esters, some vanilla, caramel malt sweetness. Taste follows, caramel malts, slightly bready, lots of yeast and a touch of aclohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a heavy active carbonation. There is a strange off flavor/aftertaste that I am not crazy about and the body is kind of thin. There are much better readily available quads out there that I will avoid this one in the future."
"Notes: This has been one of my favorite beers for years and it never seems to disappoint. This particular bottle had been aging for the last two years which seems to have cut a bit of the carbonation - but this didn't take away much from my enjoyment of the beer. Not sure that I'd wait as long in the future before cracking my bottle open though."
"D: As other reviewers have noted, it is *very* difficult to put the glass down, but somehow you get the impression this is a beer thats meant to be savored first. The alcohol is subtle, but it's effects are definitely noticeable after a glass or two. Outstanding beer."
"This beer is one of the best quads I have ever had. I really enjoy this beer, and I can't believe I have never reviewed it before. One of my favorites"
"D: dangerously drinkable at this high abv...wondering how this is with age on it. Even better on-tap, but I didn't sit down and evaluate it those times."
"All the flavors melded together with perfect harmony. Soft but bold. A very easy drinker with the alcohol well hidden. The yeast has a subdued presence."
"Feels good in the mouth, and drinks easy for a 10% ABV, so beware!"
"D: I'm torn drinking this. It's so good I can't put the glass down but at the same time this is something that is best savored slowly. I can't think of anything better to drink with red meat or aged cheese."
"d. Good lord.. Drinkable? Just an all around fantastic combonation of taste/smell/feel/appearence. A beer to savor."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a huge white head. Great lacing on the glass...and lots of carbonation in the Belgian. It's pretty sweet, with a bit of spice. The Belgian candy sugar is evident. Other flavors are brown sugar and dark malty sweetness; with a bit of fruit taste. For a 10% beer, it's very drinkable."
"D- Not bad. I like the alcohol warmth on this one. Plays a good part in the beer. St Bernardus hasn't let me down yet. Excellent beverage here."
"What can I say.. I sampled this at Beervanafest in October '10. Outstanding. Dark amber color, full head. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Smells doughy like a top Belgian should. Taste is powerful, nuts and raisins, easy finish. One of the most memorable beers of the tasting."
"D: Very drinkable, letting it warm really let's the flavor evolve; a nice cold evening ale. Looking forward to trying the St. Bernardus Christmas Ale sometime!"
"drinkability; the alcohol lets itself be known and compromises drinkability a bit."
"D A good beer, but with the high alcohol, you won't be having too many. Good to have a few in the frig for sipping. 4.5 higher than original review (4.0)."
"pours with solid 1 inch deep ruby head with great lacing throughout. This is as complex a beer as I've had, really enjoy the multitude of aromas and tastes. Figs, raisins, malts and on and on and on. Reminiscent of fruitcake, the good kind. Alcohol is just present enough to warm you, but not overwhelm at all. Love this stuff."
"d. really drinkable and enjoyable."
"Pleasing to look at and pleasing to drink."
"overall, this was ok. i had this on tap and i am sure it was much fresher and i would say i enjoyed this far more."
"D: Extremely drinkable."
"Overall: A great example of a ""very good"" Quad! A try it beer! Cheers!"
"Despite some less-than-perfect qualities, still strangely addictive and fun to drink. I think I prefer it out of the bottle where the carbonation seems to remain fairly intact to lighten it up and hide some of the boozey notes."
"Pours a deep murky dark brown almost black color with a thick milk colored head and some small lacing. Smells of sweet malts, caramel, prunes, raisins, and possibly honey. Tastes very complex -- caramel, raisin, fig, cherry, prune, plum, and toffee all ravage the senses. Mouthfeel is perfect with just the right carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high."
"D-This beer was truly remarkable in it's ability to hide that 10.5% ABV.Way too easy drinking."
"D: A fantastic, well executed Belgian quad plain and simple. Great warming winter sipper for colder weather that hides the 10.5% abv very well. One or two might be enough over the span of an hour or two but you will find yourself enjoying and savoring every sip."
"Very good beer. A great example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The alcohol is masked very well for such a strong beer."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer, and I kind of regret not trying it sooner. Looks great, smells and tastes even better -- the ABV is definitely a little big in presence as well as in the flavor set, which lowers the drinkability by a little bit, and I have to wonder if aging a few of these for a few years would be beneficial to it (the bottle claims you can age it up to 15 years, not sure if I could try my patience that far though);"
"D - I will be picking this up in the future for sure. Everything has been said already about this beer and it is all true. Its beers like this that make me want to try as much as I can. Truly one of the best out there"
"Drinks well but a bit overpowering. A once in a while selection for me."
"Dark brownish and course looking, nearlry permanent cap over the top. Aroma is of peppered malt and spices, along with crispy toasted breads that carry over into the flavors. There is a plethora of dense spice character all over this, so good. there is a strong dark yeast note and toasted/burnt marshmallow. creamy and course at the same time the carbination levels are faint but tightly woven."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color that is almost transparent. Medium off-white head that diminishes rather slowly. Scent is a lot of sweet malts with dark fruits and somewhat of a strong alcohol smell. Very sweet-smelling. This is what is expected from a Belgian quad, and it's quite delightful. Taste is dark fruits with a slight licorice taste. Great Belgian yeast flavors and nice malt flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit more bubbly than I remembered, but feels very nice. Not syrupy at all. Drinkability is fairly high."
"A good beer for sure but the strong presence of a character that's not to my liking surely affects my ratings. Stylistically I don't see the need for this strong yeast flavor. It's hard for me to appreciate why this beer commands the respect it commands or how is it, what some people say, ""practically same"" as Westvleteren 12. I have had the top rated Quadrupels/BSDAs side by side in a tasting that included this beer and I failed to see its charm then, and I fail to see it now. In my opinion it's not close to Westvletern 12 in character and nowhere close to Westvleteren 12 or Rochefort 10 in merit."
"Overall, a really nice quad. Perhaps one of the best I have ever had. The flavors are both complex and well integrated and there is a ton of balance here. Definitely worth the money."
"as far as drinkability goes, i feel like one pint would be all i could manage to down in one sitting with out getting too full, but with 10.5%abv one bottle may be enough."
"Drinkabilty - Wondering why this was the top beer of the month on-tap, I chose it and am glad! I'm sure I could have many more but with a $7 glass of this beer, I'm going to come back another day to taste more of this top 20 favorite now!"
"Notes: I wouldnt recommend this to a belgian rookie. not really worth the price in my opinion."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a world class beer. That is a fact. This brew has a dark cloudy appearance that invites the drinker into the world of Belgian brews. This brew excels in its taste and mouthfeel. Very malty and fruity, St. Bernardus does a great job of retaining the generations old recipie. A velvety mouth feel only accents how good this brew is. At 10.5%, the alcohol is well hidden and very smooth, so be careful and enjoy responsibly! Cheers and enjoy a world class beer on me!"
"Good full feel. Nice carbonation... Easy drinking beer... Even better on tap than inthe bottle."
"[Edit 9/18] The last category was originally Drinkability - at 10+% not this beers strong suit. Now it's given as overall - as this is my favorite beer that *is* a strong suit. So a 4 for drinkability becomes a 5 for overall."
"D: If it wasn't so strong, I'd love to have a few pints"
"Extremely tasty beer, which was rich and dark and didn't have the spice or fruit bite to it; the 10% alcohol is very well hidden, but still makes it's presence felt. High drinkability and high recommendation on this classic that never disappoints."
"An excellent beer, but the 10.5% ABV and the thicker body slowed me down a bit."
"D: I could sip this brew all night. High ABV, full body, and price makes it a little difficult to do so though."
"This is a very drinkable beer and though it shows some of the ABV, it goes down incredibly easily. I gave a sip to me wife, who does not drink beer regularly, and even she thought it was something she could drink. When I told her it was over 10% she was quite surprised. This beer is definitely deserving of its world class stature."
"Drinkabilty - Alcohol is above 10%, and with this kind of flavor, this is to be enjoyed weekly, or even monthly, not daily. Would spoil you if consumed regularly. Fantastic, one of the best, doesnt dethrone rochefort 10, but is a fine drink."
"Drinkability: An excellent sipping beer and a superb example of its style. A must-have beer."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 has a dark red/amber colour and big head that lasts. The smell is of roasty, dark malt along with some fruitiness. This beer tastes great and strikes lovely balance between the roasted malt flavour and the fruitiness. The aftertaste is just a smooth continuation of the rest of the taste without any extra bitterness. It is thick and foamy in the mouth. This beer goes down fast and easy, especially given its high ABV."
"Overall: Can always count on Abt 12 to lift your spirit. One of the most enjoyable brews in my area that's easy to find. Cellaring is not necessary, but encouraged."
"Developing a taste for these beers. I'm a fan of this one, can see why it is a gateway into the belgian spectrum of beers."
"D- I could drink this all day, everyday. Amazing brew. I love belgian quadrupels almost as I love my girlfriend/Elisha Cuthbert, but this beer is special. Truly smooth from start to finish, with a barely noticeable alcohol content--up until you finish the 24oz and then start walking around. This beer should be the center of a new olympic game."
"Exceptional drinkability."
"This is quite the beer for the money and will become a staple. It doesn't amaze me, but it's an elegant yet powerful brew that is characterful and refreshing. And delicious."
"Not only does Abt 12 have all of the above going for it, but it is fantastic with food as well. On the savory side, try it with grilled sausages, Cassoulet, or Veal Parmigiana. It will go great with your favorite chocolate desserts too, or a fine cigar. On the other hand, this beer is so great on it's own that you may just want to enjoy it with something simple like fresh bread and Brie de Meaux."
"D - Drinkable beer, good taste and a nice finish."
"D- Very drinkable and delicious. Complex but a definite sipper."
"Very drinkable. Would pair well with a wide range of foods."
"I wouldn't say this is the best example of a Belgian; very original and not all that characteristic of the style in general. Glad I tried it, but I have to say not as awesome as it's cracked up to be online."
"A beer with a whole lot going for it, lots to discuss, dissect, yet I find myself just wanting to sit back and sip it, sip it, and...oh shit, there it goes."
"D: This beer has a high ABV. The booze is somewhat present. This is certainly a sipping beer for me and quite enjoyable."
"Doesn't have the majesty, complexity or mystery of Westy 12, and really - it's unfair and stupid to compare beers to other beers, unless that's what they brewer intended. But it is certainly a delicious Quad and I could have several in a night. I'm halfway through the 750 as I write this and it wasn't a chore."
"drinkability - the 10.5% abv is barely noticeable, this is a great quad that i'll definetly be drinking again"
"I have never tasted a 10% beer this drinkable. Very well balance and smooth. one of my favorite quads. This beer is dangerous considering how well the abv is hidden."
"D: I haven't yet tried Westy 12, but for now this is my favorite quad. Outstanding."
"Overall/notes - Pretty much exactly how I remember it. Really great beer. Actually, not quite the monster I remember, as for a long time, I called it my favorite. Still, I'm no going to complain at all. This beer rocks my socks and that's all that matters."
"D - Oh hell yes. Mind you this is not the beer to pour down one after another. This is a nice slow sipping beer that you can enjoy. Go get some. Now."
"This is definitely a world class beer. Rich fruits mixed with spices, slight alcohol burn and then a sharp dry finish. I love this beer! Probably the best Quad that I have had to date. I sure hope that I can get my hands on a Westy 12 one of these days to compare."
"From the 25 fl. oz. corked bottle. Sampled on November 20, 2010. It pours a decent looking dark amber color with about three inches of puffy, light foamy head. Typical of Belgian ales this does eminate a bit of wheat in the aroma at first but the overall sensation is mellow malts. The advertised spices seem to be far away. The flavor tends to be bitter up front with a strong ale feel at the end along with some hops. A pretty good beer."
"D- One of, if not, the best Quads i've had, perfect for every occasion, although definitely be careful of the 10.5% ABV as it will sneak up on you rather quickly, definitely a sipping beer."
"D: Overall this is a very tasteful beer, definitely lives up to its hype as being one of the worlds best. Although 10.5% ABV, it is very smooth and has almost no hint of alcohol in the taste."
"I loved this brew and won't ever pass it up again. We don't get this one in TN anymore but my ventures to places that do will always find me picking this up. Its a masterpiece..."
"It was smooth, medium bodied with good amount of carbonation and finished dry. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with adbundent head that last through out. Smells of a typica quad, a bit spicey and harsh. The taste is strong, smooth, but full of spices. Full flavored beers like these arent for the macro lover. Overall what else can be said, its a great beer."
"Drinkability: This is certainly my favorite Quad, and Ive had a Westvlteren 12. A terrific night cap."
"D- Love the carbonation and the sticky feel of the beer. Could drink this on all the time."
"Overall this is an absolute winner and by far one of the 5 best Belgian beers on the planet. Few, if any better in the style."
"Full-flavored, balanced, and completely easy-drinking. Very nice interplay between the fruity, malty, and spicy notes. Alcohol is almost completely masked, leaving a nothing but a pleasant warmth on the finish."
"D: If you like the flavors and the high ABV, this beer will be right up your alley."
"D - Have had this many times and does not seem as complex as I remember. Very drinkable."
"Jake"
"i'm not a huge belgian fan, but this is definitely a unique beer...its good and worth a try"
"This is a full bodied offering that is lightly carbonated. Easy drinking for how big the abv is but my guess is this particular offering is quite young considering the young yeasty quality that is quite bold in this brew. For all the praise and glory this beer gets I was not that big of a fan and prefer Rochefort 10 by a wide margin compared to this. I will re-evaluate the previous statement once I get a chance to sit down an enjoy a bottle of Abt 12 that is several years old."
"Drink: Entering the stomach, it almost reminds you of a very upscale comfort food... Rich in flavor, aroma, body, texture, and overall taste... 10% alcohol is BARELY noticed behind the richness and complexity of this AWESOME Belgian brew... Do not even WORRY about being disappointed..."
"Drink- It's a bit heavy for a session beer, but I liked it. I can see why for this Quad to be as highly rated as it was. For me it was the younger brother to a SA Utopias. It had the same qualities."
"Taste is very nice. Dark fruits (figs and plums) and spice primarily, with a warming alcohol heat that is very nice going down. Nice creamy mouthfeel, with a low to medium levelof carbonation."
"Notes: a little drier and more balanced than some of the BSDA/quads ive had. good but not my favorite"
"D - Drinkability is pretty moderate. The flavors are quite complex and enjoyable, but the hotness and tannins detract a bit. Drank over about a span of 40 minutes and it was interesting to see how the complexion changed as it warmed up. Got more of the fruits as a result but it became a bit more boozy and dry as well."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a deep murky brown with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice amount of dried fruit and dark malts. The taste is dried fruit and burnt caramel. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol. This is a great quad, even on-tap."
"D: Amazing amazing brew. I could sip this forever. I'd rather be sipping a Westy, but this comes pretty darn close. Definitely pretty much on par with Rochefort. Well worth the price. I will buy this one again."
"Overall this beer is as I said, smooth, rich and malty. It is very easy to drink and hides it's strength well. I will be drinking this again."
"I highly recommend this brew."
"I found this be quite a well crafted and enjoyable beer. This definitely leaves me looking forward to trying more quads in the future."
"D - I wish I could drink this all the time, but at 10, I'm afraid more than two would put me out."
"Want this one again with some age upon its sweet physique."
"Very drinkable -- sneaks up on you. Flavor and balance are near perfect. Great brew."
"The Alcove charged an arm and a leg for a glass of Abt. 12 on-tap, and I suppose that it was mostly worth it. Excellent Quadrupel with enough differences from the bottled version to warrant a purchase. I'm glad to have this in Tuscaloosa, that's for sure."
"drinkability: Ok, it's good. probably one of the best in it's category."
"This is one of those beers that is ""Required Reading"" for any BA. Here's a prime example of one of the world's great beers just sitting on your liquor store's shelf at an affordable-luxury price. Go pick one up today. Better yet, pick up the St. Bernies gift pack with bottles of the 6, 8, 12 and Tripel *and* this sweet balloon goblet - really a kick-ass glass. Money well spent."
"This beer is a flat out awesome. Surprisingly it is relatively easy to find where I live, and is even on tap at Cap Ale. I definitely recommend this."
"Drinkability: Amazingly complex, yet so easily consumed for a 10.5% ABV. A marvelous Quad and well worth the price."
"O: this is a very good change of pace when you love the westy 12 or the roch 10 (I can't help to compare). However, the latter 2 have my preference. Not as complex as the westy and not that caramel, dark brown sugar & port-like finish taste I love about the roch. But all in all a very enjoyable quad"
"Very drinkable, the 10.5 percent seems more like 7, very tasty. A very good quad, very very good for the style."
"Drinkability is quite good, even though you'll definitely need to sip this over time to really get the full experience. This is a full-bodied Belgian brew with a complex taste and should be savored as befitting one of the best beers on the planet. I would actually place this just below the Rochefort 10, but that is by no means a negative mark on this exceptional beer. I'll definitely have to have this again with a bit of age on it."
"This is another winner from Saint Bernardus....I can see why this beer is routinely mentioned among the best there is. Scarily drinkable."
"Drinkable but I would have only one, maybe two glasses of this, not because it's a ABV of 10.50% but because it's so present in the taste. Due to personal taste I wouldn't say I'm in love with this beer, however, I respect it because I know that anyone who loves quads is going to want to marry it."
"I'd if these were inexpensive and I could give them to my friends. They'd go down in no time."
"The body is smooth, creamy, and rich. Really quite delicious and one to enjoy. This would be great alongside braised meats or a savory steak."
"Poured a 750 ml bottle in tulip glass"
"D: Its strong but its dank, obviously not a pound it beer."
"D- Goes down very easy. I could see myself sipping on this beer all evening. In fact I may do just that."
"Drinkability: No problem. I could definitely drink this all night...sippingly."
"O - For me, this is the benchmark for the style. It was my introduction to belgian beers in general many years ago, and it has since continued to be among the one or two best beers of its type that I've ever had."
"D: Definitely drinkable, though the mouthfeel is, for me, really heavy and thick. The aroma and flavor are both great, but Definitely share a pint with a friend."
"This is a great beer. There are many flavors and they merge into almost one flavor. You have to really dig to get all of the flavors. It is slightly creamy, but most of all inviting. St. Bernardus brew some of my favorites."
"This is a very nice drinkable Belgian Quad, very smooth and surprisingly the alcohol does not dominate at 10.5%."
"D-Drinkability is awesome for a beer this big. I am beginning to appreciate Belgians. Maybe it's the authentic ones as opposed to American knockoffs that I like best."
"D: Please sir, I'd like some more!"
"Into an Orval chalice. Puffy off white head, speckly lacing all around. Dark mahogony brown with ruby highlights. Aroma is pure dryed fruits, raisins, prunes, dried cranberry, a little graphey and slightly alcoholic. Flavor is pretty intense. Fruity, juicy, complex rich maltyness, special B pops up, estery goodness. I taste dried fruits, and candy sugar, there is a slight smokyness to this beer. Truly intense. Lots going on. Clean dry finish on the back end. Not cloying at all for such a serious beer. Truly top notch."
"As widely available as this beer is, it is hard to believe it is still this dang good. A strong carbonation, smooth on the tongue, and a fun to drink. To help break someone into craft beer, this might be a good candidate."
"After having had Westy 12, Rochefort 10 and this beer, my days of buying/trading for Quads is over."
"So drinkable. Complex and tasty. Very well balanced and very well done. A top rated beer for good reason."
"The beer color is dark red or brown with reddish notes on the edges. Nice soapy head. Not a strong aroma here maybe the beer is too cold. Spices and Fruits, dark fruits. Cloves for the spices. More intense on the taste. Spices typical of belgians beers. Well balanced. Warms due to the alcohol. Complex beer which requires multiple visit to better know her."
"D: Very drinkable. One of the best belgians I've had. So easy to drink. Highly recommend!"
"Pours a deep copper to brown-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, faint dark fruit, figs and plums. In the taste, dark fruit, fig and raisin, and quite malty. A small alcohol like bite and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a small, dry alcohol and small fruitiness in the aftertaste. Light in the nose, nice flavor and hide the alcohol."
"D- pretty good, even though it could creep up on you if you're not careful"
"Not more than 25 - 33 cl. and the joy to feel in heaven."
"Extremely delicious!"
"Overall very good beer but not what I expected, will give a try again, felt a little bit flat in flavor."
"Just heavy enough that it's a context sensitive beer, but good enough that i would drink it anywhere at any time. It really is that good."
"A very tasty beer that is definitely more on the sweet side. Smooth flavors make for an easy drinking beer that makes me wonder how much aging might affect it. Certainly much to sweet for viewing ""Shutter Island", I needed something much darker."
"D: This is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped given its alcohol content. It tastes like it is strong, but the alcohol presence does not detract from the drinkability. For the most part, the alcohol is masked from the taste."
"Overall, this beer is simply world-class. It doesn't receive a lot of hype, but judging by its rank on the Top 100 (currently 10), it's no secret that this is a great beer."
"Serving: 25 oz, Corked, caged bottle."
"1 finger of light amber head and excellent lacing. The color is a dark brown, nearly identical to the color of most brown beer bottles. I really didn't get a good aroma, it seemed pretty bland and it smelled mostly of alcohol I thought. It tasted of dried fruits and a malty finish. ABV is hidden well and carbonation was high but not too much. For a 10.5, this was very easy to drink and went down smoothly."
"This is everything I look for in a beer... good color, pleasant aroma, high ABV, and damn tasty! They really got the flavor right on this one. Sweet and malty w/ slight fruity overtones just to the point of hiding the high alcohol content but not so much as to overpower the beer. They even did a good job on the labeling. I love the image of the happy drunk monk. If I were a beer-brewing monk, that's just how I'd picture myself after taking down a couple goblets of this 10% beast!"
"This continues to be one of my favorite beers and I seem to enjoy it more each time. A job well done, Belgian monks!"
"Drinking on tap. Hazey black/brown color. Nice head and lacing. Great carbonation. Not to bubbley, but masks the alcohol well. Tastes of dark stone fruits, plums, and cherries. A little rum like. A slight stickyness on the finish. I love this beer. Can't drink a ton of them, but a delicious sipping beer."
"very good drinkability. could easily down a large bottle of this stuff, even with the high alcohol content. I think it would be even better aged. this beer is readily available by me which is great. a little pricey, but definitely worth it. one of the best beers I've had, but still below Rochefort 10."
"Notes: I've been dying to try this one, and held off till my birthday to open it. What a treat! I happened to try 5 diff beers in all that day, this one came in 2nd, a close 2nd though. I tried this with a piece of birthday cake and it went perfectly with that. IMO a dessert beer for sure."
"I would recommend this to anyone."
"D- great quad, truly a stand out for the style. The fact that its so easy to find and cheap just makes me even happier. Doesn't make the beer any better but I get to drink it more often."
"A truly word class beer."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a St Bernardus chalice. Dark mahogany, not fined beer with deep chestnut tones. Monster cream head typical of the strong carbonation in Belgian offerings. Smell is of caramel malts, unrefined sugar and that all too familiar peculiarity of a belgian yeast phenols with bready overtones. The beer tastes like figs and dates and caramel and toffee, bready, sweet and again that all too hard to put your finger on delicious belgian pecularity. Incredibly complex, incredibly deep that improves as it warms. One of the top few beers of the world. Most closely resembles the Westy of any other offering. Absolutely amazing. In my eyes, as close to perfection in a beer as you can get. This is so good it hurts. Lip smacking good. One of the finest examples of the most complex tasting beer class, Belgian Quads."
"This beer is a very dark garnet with about an inch of white fluffy head which recedes to about a quarter inch. It smells amazing, with notes of spice, figs, and sweetness. It tastes amazing as well, with a taste which mirrors the nose, adding a little bit of yeast bite and some caramel. These flavors mostly, if not completely mask the high abv. The higher carbonation gives it a deceivingly light mouthfeel, but as it warms and the carbonation dissipates, it becomes thicker. Most drinkble quad i have ever had. Amazing. It seems like it would hold up well with age, and I would love to see how it changes with a year on it."
"D - Excellent. This is the best-drinking BSD/Quad around. Basically a *better* version of Westvleteren 12."
"D- im on my second pint of this its amazingly sessionable at 10 %"
"D: Did I use a straw? Cuz that was gone fast."
"The pour is a caramel/amber color with a very slight head. Perhaps using caramel as a color descriptor is a product of the smell, which is rich in caramel and dried dark fruits. The figs and raisins really show themselves in the taste along with vanilla and again a touch of caramel. It's really malty and sweet. I was hoping for a hint of banana or some bubblegum, but it was not readily apparent. Felt really nice with some decent viscosity. I'd like to get another bottle to have sit around for a year or so to tame the booziness, but this is the only one I've got for now."
"My girlfriend has got me hooked on the show Trueblood and in it 2 people get high on vampire blood and dance around, feel one with nature, themselves, and the world. This beer is vampire blood."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, sugary, and full of doughy yeast and rich malt."
"25.4 oz, caged and corked for $10.99. Poured into a koeningshoeven trappist glass. Pours a dark brow with ruby-red hues. A one inch head billows and disappears. The aroma is of currants, figs, dates, lovely yeast, and a little bit of cherry. The tast consists of more dark fruit flavors, some banana, brown sugar, and a touch of fantastic. The finish is so wonderfully clean and flavorful."
"D: Taking it slow with this one, each sip reveals something new. A slow drinker for sure, this beer represents the quad style phenomenally."
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, warming the throat. A light effervescence all over the tongue, as well. Medium-full bodied. The only downside I found was a bit of roughness in the aftertaste, kind of a bitter cherry/oak flavor. That being said, this is an absolute ""cream of the crop"" beer. Few, if any better in the style. Few better in any style, in my not so humble opinion."
"I can't wait to age some of these bad boys."
"jd"
"D- I was disappointed by this to be honest. It was incredibly well balanced and nice to drink, but it was underwhelming. The flavors were weak and I missed out on the strong smells others described. I had an amazing dubbel last night that blows this beer out of the water. I hardly detected any malts in the at all. I did enjoy drinking it though, and I want to try it again sometime soon to see if I still feel the same way about it."
"d: Just a perfect beer in every way that matters. One of may all time favorite go-to beers."
"I poured into my glass to a couple fingers of tan head. It is a dark, dark amber in color. I did manage to get some chunks of yeast in there, too. The smell is fruity with cherry and dark berries being the most prominent. I also get plenty of spices along with some caramel malt. The taste is sweet and spicy. I'm usually not a big Belgian fan but this beer is pretty put together. I get just the slightest hops taste on the finish. This beer is going down mighty easily for a high ABV!"
"I'm so thrilled to finally document my feelings about this beer. This is one of those beers that really raised my awareness and fondness of Belgians years ago. I'm so happy to have had this chance to write down how I really feel - this is my love letter to you, St. Bernardus Abt 12. Thanks for the good times and great drinks!"
"A real joy to drink, a first-rate Belgian strong ale. A high ABV means less drinkability, but I'd gladly spend an evening with a tall bottle of this. Brilliant."
"Man o man, what à beer , much. Smoother and sweeter than the bottel version , awsome , one of the best trappistabbey Beers' in THE world"
"overall: a great beer high the high ABV is masked very well and drinks very nice a sweet malty masterpeice"
"D - Super drinkable. I love me a good quad and this is a GREAT quad."
"D - At 10.5% ABV, this one will sneak up on you, keeping it from being too quaffable. However, this is one of the finest beers on the planet and a true benchmark for Quads!"
"It would be hard to imagine actually drinking a better beer. In all respects, it delivers what it promises. Especially is the taste - just beautiful. This is a clean and outstanding beer. The nose is a spicy, yeasty, malty combo with notes of dark fruits. Anyone who is looking to introduce someone to craft beer should consider this as a first beer."
"D - one or two and done since this beer is pricey but without thinking about the price i would still say its about the same since the beer is fairly rich in flavor"
"The mouthfeel is soft and silky, peppered with fine carbonation. Bitterness is present but not a focal point. Very slick with a lingering doughy coating feel in the finish. Very tasty and easy to drink at 10.5% it's a nice sipper."
"Wow! Pours a slightly cloudy, dark rum color. Huge, creamy head that never actually dissipates. Loaded with carbonation also. Beautiful...Yeasty, Belgian-y goodness in the smell. Fresh apples, maybe some coriander. Excellent...ENormous, robust flavor. Crammed with stuff...some vanilla notes, some heavy Belgian yeast notes. So much going on it's almost ridiculous. Flavors evolve as it warms up. This is one of the World's fine ales, to be sure. Finish is not too long, but carries just a hint of bitterness along with some alcohol. Also a 10% ABV brew. $9.99 for a pint + 9.4 oz bottle. Awesome and a must find for all you folks out there."
"Warmed up and poured into a Duvel tulip. Clear brownish ruby red with a quarter inch bubbly tan head which soon diminished to a ring. No lacing. Smells of deep dark malts. Some alcohol smells warn of what is to come. Taste is smooth, well balanced. Malts up front with a boozy phenolic finish. Medium body, low carbonation. The smoothness makes you want more but the alcohol puts a stop to that."
"World class beer for sure, notably for the well hidden 10.5% abv. Rich, dark, fruity, sneaky."
"Bottle. Dark slightly muddy brown pour with loose white head. Complex belgian beer fruit aromas (ripe sugarey red fruits, cherry, raspberries, blackberries), alcohol, chocolate and a bit of yeastiness. Taste is quite boozy and fruity but very well balanced. Beautiful mouthfeel no wateriness here. Quite beautiful."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a thick vanilla lace. Aroma is sweet, malty. Taste is complex with breadiness, sweetness, spiciness of cinnamon and clove. This is a beautifully rich beer, moutfeel is silky smooth and drinkability is superb--for what it is. One of these is plenty!"
"D - Very nice. It is complex and delicious, yet not overly sweet and cloying."
"D - Excellent Quadrupel brewed by one of the finest Trappist brewery's in the world. Highly recommended if you enjoy this style of beer. You will no doubt smile and grin like the jolly man on the label!"
"D - Highly recommended to anyone looking for a bold and flavourful quad. Absolutely yummy. Could probably throw back a few of these as a time, but I would recommend only doing so with caution as the alcohol sneaks up on you! Enjoy!"
"D- Tasty enough to enjoy en masse, though strong enough to merit caution, a good beer with a lot of complexities, best appreciated by the sip."
"3.5O: I prefer this beer fresh. While an interesting evolution of flavor, it's a bit sharp and sour for my taste. Won't cellar again."
"I will need to get this one again sometime I am more experienced at discerning tastes. Very complex, very good beer. I haven't had many quadrupels but this is definitely the best I have gotten around to."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and carbonation is moderate to below average. Drinkability is good, it's a great tasting beer for the style and abv. Overall an excellent beer and one worth all of it's praise."
"At the Eulogy Tavern in Philadelphia. Into a chalice, poured a mahogany/reddish color with slightly less than a finger of off-white, which collapsed quickly, but I suspect that it may have had something to do with the way the glass was washed. Smelled of plum, raisin, sour cherry, and nutmeg. The flavor was off the charts; molasses, nutmeg, plum, and raisins, which dissolved to a sour, black cherry finish, which zero hint of the high alcohol content. Nicely full-bodied, but very smooth with nearly no carbonation. Despite the fact that this is a strong beer, I'd make an attempt at sessioning it, as it was super smooth and satisfying. Needless to say I ordered another after the initial sample."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thin head. Was expecting the head to be a bit bigger. Tons of raisin and plum in the nose. Had a lot of sweetness, almost like brown sugar toffee. Flavour was impressively huge with dark bready malt, raisin, plum, brown sugar, caramel and I think I got a bit of chocolate. A very creamy mouthfeel. Awesome beer!"
"My 3rd favorite of the 4."
"Was a little disappointed with this one. Similar in style to the Westmalle. Good overall taste, but not too complex in flavor. Overall fairly sweet, but nothing to write home about. Aroma is pleasant and sweet but I don't really see what all the hubub is about."
"Pours a dark chocolate haze with some life, thin head. Has an aroma of grapefruit, with hints of caramel and banana. Has a creamy, doughy, bitter taste. A very yeasty feel. Has a medium body that thickens nicely as it warms. This is a very tasty brew."
"Had on-tap at Monk's Beer Emporium in Philly, served in a tulip glass. Didn't get to see the pour, but it came black with a dark creamy head. Flavor was dark malt, with the promised notes of chocolate and coffee, and... is that BLUEBERRY? Yes, that was distinctly a blueberry note in the finish. The complexity in this beer was really a marvel. While I can't give as detailed a description as I'd like without having taken notes, this was absolutely spectacular. Might knock Gulden Draak off its throne as my favorite Belgian."
"D- i'm convinced that this bottle has seen better days as the retialer that i purchased it from has a questionable reputation. i assumed that i couldn't go wrong with such a high abv brew but i guess i was mistaken. sadly i have to dump this one due to the yeast chunkys. i will be in pittsburgh next month and i WILL stop by the sharp edge, the best belgian beer bar i've ever heard of, and a reputable source, and try this one again hopefully on tap, and certainly re-review. sadness from watou to alliance. sincerely, james."
"D: A good Belgian quad. One of the best."
"Drinkability - one is plenty but I will absolutely be buying this again. Best quad I've ever had."
"D- I really enjoyed this and I believe I will pick up a couple bottles to see what a little time will do for it."
"Superb brew all around, one of my all time favorites."
"Drinkability - nope, not a session beer. Too much booze, too much sweet, not enough balance. I usually like St. Bernadus alot - the Prior 8 is phenomenal. They missed on this one."
"How do you add anything to a review of a legendary beer? Not much can be said that can't be. This is a brew that must be drank."
"Overall, a world class beer that's a must try if you're a true beer lover."
"It is well balanced, nothing is coming out too much as to mask the other tastes. The 10 degree of alcool is well soften by a sweet taste (but not as much as the Rochefort 10) and it's mouthfeel. The hop could have been stronger to give a little edge."
"D: pretty good quad but its a little on the swwet side. It drinks decent but starts to taste like leather as it warms up."
"Excellent beer. Another must have on hand."
"A very drinkable quad, even at 10.5% ABV. Nicely done, but I still prefer Rochefort 10."
"This is a supremely drinkable beer. Although I've been keen on trying as many brews as I can lately, I ordered a second because I could not get enough."
"Poured this into my SA glass. A dark brownish color with about two fingers of an off white head that laced my glass throughtout. Tasted to me of dark fruits,raisins/plums. Has nice carbonation with a smooth drinkability with some alcohol on the finish. Overall this is a very good beer. I must try this on draft next time I'm in Olde City...."
"I could down these for a while... at least until I passed out drunk."
"The beer pours a hazy medium brown color with a tan head. The head appears very fluffy and soft. The aroma is alcohol, dark fruit, brown sugar, yeast and candi-sugar. The beer smells great. The flavor is a lot of dark fruit (plums and raisins) with some brown sugar, candi-sugar, yeast and alcohol. Medium-thick, very creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. This is what a quadrupel is supposed to taste like."
"D: Goes down very well for the style."
"Abt 12 is a true classic that deserves mention whenever the topic turns to the best beers on the planet. Even though Tripel is the finest ale that St. Bernardus has to offer, this big brew isn't far behind. It's also better (and more widely available) than either Trappistes Rochefort 10 or Westveleteren 12."
"D-so good; dark malty deliciousness; the alcohol is really well hidden for 10.5%; such a great beer"
"D-even though the alcohol is present, you could drink it all day, excellent"
"Drinkability -- Definitely my favorite of the St. Bernardus lineup. Smooth, complex, buttery, earthy. There's something very comforting about this beer. Absolutely lived up to its reputation."
"D: well this is the beer that really showed me what Belgian beers are all about early in my craft beer drinking time. It is still just as good as I remember, however I pick up much more delicate flavors as my palate has developed. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in Belgian brews!"
"D: a sipper for sure, slightly hot on the finish but it does a pretty phenomenal job hiding the alcohol, incredible malt character"
"I recommend a slightly warmer temperature for serving ~50F really opens it up."
"Fantastic brew. I think I like it even a bit better than the Rochefort 10 (which is hard for me, I love that beer). In my top 10 all time."
"Snifter pour and I am met with a murky dark brown ale with a big fluffy head of foam with staying power. The aroma consists of raspberries, tart apple, pear and other darker fruits. Well done. Bubbly taste with a fruity flavor and some mild malt on the swallow and a slight peppery taste. A nice looong aftertaste is present with a lot going on well after the sip is down. A slight numbing effect on the gums. Foam with every sip is a nice touch. Drinkability is way high as the going down is very easy. Dealing with the after-effects? Not so much. A world class beer to be enjoyed by all."
"D: One of the best friend of beer lovers. Dangerously drinkable."
"I've had better Quads, but this one is up there towards the top. Would drink again."
"D - Tastes heavier and heavier as the bottle progresses, but is not overwhelming"
"This is a classic Belgian ale and a rival for any pretender. Its been known to win blind tastings with Westvleteren to boot."
"Thick, earthy, fruity flavor masks a surprisingly high, take-you-off-guard kind of ABV. Awesome-looking bottle, which might inspire friends to suggest that you have some kind of magic elixir in your closet. The grinning abbeyfellow is occasionally described as ""creepy"" by my less beer-snobbish friends. Not quite as creamy as I'd expected, but the thick, luxurious head makes up for it. For an instant, you are not a man, but a monk-- a purveyor of divine secrets and holy inspiration. My only gripe is the slightly prohibitive cost- this beer is absolutely worth trying, but save 'em for special occasions."
"Drinkability? Like most quality Belgians this beer is too drinkable for the alcohol level, you can easily sit and drink a bottle of this brew. Earns an easy recommendation from me!"
"Notes- More Please!"
"D-I am love'n this beer but I am not sure i would be up to drinking to much of it . The flavor is exceptional but the Alcohol might be just a bit to high to drink this all night."
" But this one is dependable, always around and solid enough."
"(D)- A solid Quad that has everything in the right place for the style. A crisp & ripe flavor. I can finally see after having 3 bad bottles why just about everyone has given this good reviews. Its not the best, but definitely a classic example of the style."
"Taste is a bit sharp and boozy but it should fall off into the background as it warms up at bit. Mouthfeel is very full and crisp. There's lots of earthy nutty notes to this, finish is really malty. Really great representation of the style."
"D - This is a heavy beer, definitely to be consumed slowly, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"drinkability - this was hard for me to get through initially as it was the first quad I'd tried. In retrospect, a really enjoyable beverage for the style, the dominant alcohol makes this the hardest to give a high drinkability rating, but would be great aged. I need to plan on an aged bottle soon."
"Wow!"
"The taste is immediately very thick and malty with intense apple and banana flavors as well as a brief alcoholic warming. Sweet hard candies and a sharp tartness are in there as well. Silky-smooth mouthfeel and intense but fine carbonation give an amazing tactile dimension to this brew. Fantastic drinkability."
"This has to be one of the most balanced quads I've ever had. There is nothing offensive about this beer. The look is coppery but not thick. The nose is small with hints of sweetness like dried fruits but doesn't play the starring role. I actually think the drinkability is the real winner on this one. Since nothing is standing out as the main influence here it's hard to pick it apart. The high alcohol would be the only catalyst here because I'd be expecting it to go down a little hot but it doesn't. I had this on tap one time at our place and it lasted 12 hours. Definitely one I will get again when it becomes available."
"On the bottle - ""Bringing Heavenly Nectar Within Reach."" Indeed. This one rates on my personal beer scale as nectar of the gods. There is something about the Belgians that really get to my heart. (Future husband, if you are out there, take note. I've just given a hint to one of the keys to my heart, and it isn't flowers)"
"Opened up a 2010 bottle that is a little over 3 years old at this point. Huge dark fruit (red grape & raisin) overtakes other flavors a little bit but still quite excellent and opens more with warmth. Mouthfeel maybe has thinned out a little too but still amply carbonated. Great beer."
"D - It should come as no surprise that this is a world class quad offering... Easy drinking... No real complaints, though the alcohol sticks a little more than I would have expected hindering drinkability ever so slightly..."
"For me this is a great nightcap and I will continue to enjoy it regularly."
"In my opinion, this is a great dinner or dessert beer. Super delicious!"
"Popped the cork and gave a gentle pour into my chalice... Wow. Tilting the glass and pouring as gently as I could the head exploded. A rich creamy off white fluffy head. Looks beautiful. I couldn't believe the amount of head on this beer for a 10 percent ABV ale. The most impressive I've seen to date. Lots of good carbonation as well. The body is a deep hazy brown. This beer is beautiful. All sorts of fruit in the aroma. The tasty is a sweet grainy sensation. The alcohol was a bit warming so it did take me a little longer to drink. Quite an amazing beer."
"A really excellent world-class quad (pretty sure we all know that going in) whose key words I would choose: spicy, earthy, and warming. Not sure I would grab more than one at a time. This beer makes me think it would enjoy some time in the cellar, could see this being mind-blowing."
"D: Highly recommended. A world class beer."
"Warming and delicious, this is for sipping, but each sip begs another. This beer is about as good as it gets. IMO"
"Abt. 12 - abbey ale brewed in the classic ""Dubbel"" style of of Belgium's best Abbey Ales. Serve this noble and wonderfully balanced brown ale at 52-56°F in a goblet glass to best enjoy its delicate bouquet."
"D - It is damn near magical that they have hidden a 10% ABV (according to my bottle, not 10.5%) in this beer. It is so flavorful and balanced, the alcohol warms and tingles but is not harsh in any way. A great beer that should be sipped or it will sneak up on you quick...and it is hard to sip!"
"This is a beer I'll drink until it is clear I shuddah stopped. Addictive."
"Lightly carbonated, this is not as a heavy of a beer as the abv made me think it would be. Very enjoyable, one of the best Belgian beers I've tried."
"Overall, a true treat and a relatively accessible precedent for the world of beer."
"Overall Impression: This is my new favorite Quad. Absolutely yumiliscious!!!"
"d - easy to sip for a 10% beer."
"Despite the big warming alcohol kick, this was very easy to drink. Probably the thin mouthfeel that did it but I could definitely go for another one!"
"Drinkability: One of the most inviting brews I've ever tasted. I approached the Abt 12 like a sipper, but it disappeared quicker than I anticipated, primarily because of a well-hidden ABV and smoothness on the palate."
"D- An amazing Quad to sip or pair with a funky cheese."
"Overall this is a great belgian that is thankfully not too hard to find"
"Pour is a deep brown with hints of cherry (reminds me of my kitchen cabinets...) with a large frothy head that is well retained. Floaters abound. Smell is of candied sugar and prunes. There is a bite on the tongue followed by a sweetness with dark fruit. Can't put y finger on it, but the finish is the least enjoyable part of the beer so far. The body is medium to full and smooth with a creamy feel to it. Drinkability is decent but not great due to the finish that is not agreable to my taste."
"Overall: An excellent beer all around. For the price of $4.49 a bottle, I'll definitely be buying more. I would highly recommend seeking this one out. This is just a great beer."
"Mouthfeel is typical of something on this level, carbonation is high, body is moderate, and it all comes together in a gourmet-style and beautifully put together beer. Yummy stuff, could probably drink all day, and then some."
"Adios, and vote libertarian."
"D: this is one that I can drink all night long but at an extremely slow pace. this is a world class beer I can tell its a bit rough and need some time to mellow out the date on the bottle is 11/18/2013 so I think this one is young depending on how the brewery date its beers. I am going to age one for some time and see what happens it is lacking a bit of balance, I don't think its as rich as rochefort 10."
"Reviewed from my notes. Abt 12 has a deep plum color. A thin grey head settled to a skim of bubbles. There is lots of bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. It has a spicy aroma with some lightly sweet malts and a little bit of musty Belgian yeast. There is a purple fruit in there as well, red grapes or plums. It has a good, crisp, complex flavor. I can pick out a graham cracker-like grain quality to it. I can also taste red and white grapes, especially in the finish. There is a small bite of alcohol and floral hops in the aftertaste. Overall, it's a hearty, big flavor. It feels very crisp with lots of carbonation. The coating feels very good; it leaves a lot of malty flavor behind. It's very drinkable. It gets better as it warms up; this is one worth drinking slowly and ordered repeatedly."
"D - This will probably end up a drainpour simply because of how much sediment is in the glass. I can't take a sip without getting a mouthful. Everything I've had in the gift pack from them has had the same problem. I wish they didn't. Perhaps I'll try another one sometime, but probably not soon."
"So many flavors, every sip is different. The beer is complex, pours dark amber brown and a head the height of the liquid. Rum-raisin-plum, citrus, malts, yeasty, tasteful alcohol, herbal, carbonated well. Rich and sugary, excellent warming of the throat."
"D - This is as good on tap as in the bottle, albeit slightly different."
"Pours a cloudy, amber color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, alcohol, tart malt, and citrus (raspberry?). Fits the style of a Quadruple. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, sweet malt, yeast, dark citrus, and slight alcohol. Overall, a good aroma, mouth feel, and body."
"D: The well hidden alcohol leaves the drinkability high. Be careful though, this one could definitely catch up to you fast."
"Exceptional brew from (at the time of this review, my opinion), an underrated brewery. If you like Belgian beer, you are in for a treat."
"A great all around beer. Very drinkable, it hides all of the alcohol really well. Plenty of balance and depth that is expected for the style."
"All in all, a really nice Abbey Ale. There are others out there that I prefer more, but not many."
"D: Like the tune from Lionel Richie, All Night Long."
"Notes: Really nice beer with lots of complex flavors. A lot of spice in this beer. Good example of the style and a good example of craft beer in general."
"Verdict: Must drink this beer. Not just try it, but like it and drink more of it. If you do not like it, seek medical help."
"This is one of my favorite quad's. Cheap, uber drinkable. An all around great deal. I can't imagine someone being dissatisfied with this beer."
"Overall - not that impressive to be honest, I expected a lot better. Somewhat weak in taste - but well brewed. Essentially I think it should not be tasted next to the Rochefort in my opinion."
"Overall I will drink this many times in the future. It's pretty high ABV to drink several in a row but it is very tasty"
"A really solid beer, lots of great layers and bold flavors working together in harmony. Best quad i've had so far, definitely a sipper and definitely for dessert."
"D-very drinkable a solid taste but with a high abv definately a beer you could have around three of but not really to enjoy all night unless total intoxication and dropping alot of change is your goal"
"The quad from St. Bernardus. Little bottles poured into a tulip glass.A sipper slowly enjoyed. Smooth,smooth beer.One of the smoothest out there. Alcohol hides very well. I enjoy this one as it gets warmer. Great beer to have with friends. I dont drink this alone.Sociable beer. High drinkability and always enjoyed with good music.Thanx St. Bernardus."
"One of my favorites."
"d - Overall I thought this was a very good Belgian quad. It smelled and tasted great, and was a very nice, smooth balance between sweeter malts and bread/yeast. Would love to have this again, the only thing aganist it might be that the 10.5% ABV will limit the amount you'd have in one night."
"Drinkability: An excellent and refreshing beer that I could have several of. My favorite from the brewery is still the six though. I do like the apple/brown sugar taste."
"Pours a very dark brown, with lighter walnut tinges along the edges. The finger-thick head half dies, leaving a lovely creamy remainder that laces very well. The aroma is sweet and tangy, with a nice, effervescent fruitiness dominating. The taste corroborates the nose, with those fruits coming back with a sweet vengeance (those lovely malts!), including a hint of molasses/maple syrup all the way in the back. The body is a heavy medium, but does not sit poorly; rather it stands at attention, saluting, declaring itself, but not overpowering."
"Yeah...this could be a benchmark for Belgian strong dark - quad beers. Absolutely lovely fresh or aged up to 7 or more years. Beautifully balanced malt body of rich dark fruit, raisins, toffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate all blended together where none stands out overwhelmingly. Big alcohol but not hot. Great with soups. meat or rich vegie dishes, deserts. I've had this in Belgium, in various states, on tap, in small, big, and very big bottles. This is a great beer to serve fresh or after years of aging. I should add that while my rating across the board indicates 5.0, I can't add my own specific point rating, say, 4.6 for mouthfeel. There's a few beers I might want to rate higher, but this is definitely in the running for a dessert island beer. Exceptional!"
"D: Can't argue with the drinkability here. It went down perfectly smooth, and I wouldn't have suspected 10.5% abv."
"This is my favorite Belgian Quadrupel and in my opinion even compares with more exotic and rare versions of the style only available in Belgium. It's even more enjoyable with age and at 10.5% ABV it can age for quite some time with no adverse effects."
"Overall: Definitely a new favorite, excellent Belgian ale in every way. The interesting esters and hints of malt combined with the ability to hide an ABV of 10% make this a deceptively drinkable brew. By all means grab a bottle and find out for yourself, a glass or two later and you'll be damn satisfied- and DRUNK!"
"D - Very high except for the higher ABV. A 750 ml bottle would be enough."
"Was able to pick this brew up in my last trip to the store. Had been looking for it for a while but just had not been carried. The brew pours to a deep murky brown color with a small to medium tan had that has a creamy consistence, good retention and has left a fair amount of lacing. The aroma of this brew is a nice mix of malts, dark fruit (Plums and cherries) , candy sugar and a yeast slurry. Really inviting aromas for this one. Has a excellent favor, malts come through here and make a great base, slight caramel flavor. Fruit seems to be there - raisons, plums and slight cherry flavors. Slight port like flavor that really goes well with everything, seems to linger a bit on the tongue - excellent. Some sweetness is there that is real nice, candy sugar, and is not over the top. Has a slight spice to it as well. This one drinks very well, goes down smooth, can't believe that it is 10+%. Overall this is a simply excellent brew, I really can not see a major flaw with anything."
"This is a beer that everybody needs to try once. I try to have at least two every year. This may be my favorite out of the St. Bernardus lineup but it's in a tight race with the Pator 8, that stuff is also excellent."
"Very drinkable but unfortunately expensive--best for special occasions."
"Bottom line: This beer is sweet, strong, and smooth with a high alcohol content that you wouldn't expect with the amazing flavor. The flavor and drinkability are top notch, and the only draw back is the appearance."
"This is a huge sweet Belgian and yes it lives up to its name. Stop reading about it and drink it."
"Drink is good for a 10.5 ABV this is easily enjoyable for any type of beer drinker."
"The beer pours a very dark amber brown and gives a very nice amount of head with amazing lacing. The smell is spiced and a bit funky with bananas coming to mind which I'm not a big fan of. The taste is much better than the smell. Exceptional flavor of spices, dark fruit and, yes a tiny bit of banana and vanilla. Mouthfeel is very normal for a Belgian, substantial with a bit of sediment. Drinkability is reasonable for a Belgian, I couldn't help feeling like my palate had just been assaulted though."
"pours a hazy dark ruby color with a creamy 1-2 finger head with a beige ring and clinging lace on the glass best by 070514..the smell was great it was plum fig clove spice and other fruits mixed with some sweet malts..the taste was very good it was plum pears and apples with cinnamon and nutmeg some raisins and bananas some bready tastes with caramel and malts..it was sweet and bready and malty with a clove/ yeast finish very well balanced with a trace of alcohol burn it is well hidden.. my 330 ml bottle went down fast"
"drinkability - was good but i wish i would have reviewed a fresh bottle"
"quite the quad! worth seeking out. pick up the 750ml bottle if you see it, because 11oz just isn't enough."
"Fig, some prune, less plum, tobacco, clove, butterscotch and caramel; this beer runs the gamut. Very easy to quaff."
"D: One of my favorites. It's a very comfortable beer to go back to again and again."
"Oh, it's just so good!"
"Pours a deep mahogony with a fair bit of sediment and a giant frothy off white head. Smells of bubblegum, bananna, and a slight sweet mustiness. Flavor is nutty, sweet, a bit astringent, finishing with a bananna clove flavor. Very alcoholic on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin and quite carbonated. A really tasty beer but I still much prefer Rochefort or even La Trappe."
"D- Goes down so smooth, and the alcohol never makes its presence known. The mere fact that it exceeds 10% ABV is the only reason it doesn't score a perfect '5' in the Drinkability department!"
"A world class Quad for sure, there is no doubt about that. The only question is, would I like this or Westy 12 better. Only time will tell. Gotta get me a bottle of that first though..."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/19/09."
"D: What a great beer. I hope to purchase this again and enjoy it outside of a bar to get the full effect. This lived up to the hype."
"This is my final beer that I bought in a St. Bernardus gift pack. I am not a huge fan of the malt bomb beers but this is not that bad. Something that I would have again as a change up from the hoppy IPA's that I usually favor."
"D - A great quad with awesome complexities. Just a question though. If the 6 and 8 had 6 and 8% ABV respectively, why is 12 named 12 despite the fact it only has 10% ABV? Anyway, its a really enjoyable quad that I could sip for a while."
"This is a VERY good quadrupel but i can't match the Westy 12 and the Rochefort 10. I have a second bottle which i will drink in a few weeks to see if my comment is still the same."
"Drinkability is thankfully not outrageously high, or I would be on the floor. That being said, you are left wanting more."
"D: This one is not meant to quaff in large amounts. Of course, the price of it alone probably won't allow it anyway, unless you're Donald Trump. Good stuff to sip and enjoy with dark chocolate or sharp cheese."
"this is a beer i can enjoy all night."
"The smell was the highlight of this brew for me. Would have liked to give it a 4.75 and the taste a 4.25, so I compromised on my scores. Taste was real good, though not quite as complex as I thought it would be. I'm sure it will be even more delightful with a few years of age in it."
"WOW WOW WOW WOW. This is always my favorite beer. Poured from tap into a proper bernardus glass. Medium brown body with off white head. THe flavors and textures are immaculate. it makes you go back in for another sip right away. I only hope one day I can go visit the monstary."
"D: The alcohol makes itself known more in terms of the subtle warmth it provides the beer but isn't aggressive by any means. The flavors are sweet but balanced and are helped out by the carbonation."
"An amazing, delicious brew that is one of my favorites. Wish I could afford to drink this regularly. Oh, and this monk packs a punch!"
"Overall - A great intro to Quadrupels"
"Overall not too much carbonation - but seemed on point for the style - a good quad and one that would recommend at that."
"D: Would definitely have another, very drinkable."
"Note: Do not believe the hype that this is the same beer as Westvleteren 12. It may be of the same recipe but is not of the same class!"
"Notes: A very nice quad/dubbel, and somewhat underrated? Mmmm, lacks a minor kick to make it a total favorite but there is not a trace of displeasure in drinking this one."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy brown/amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is raisin/caramel. Starts sweet has a raisin/caramel flavor, mellow finish; better as it warms, hints of alcohol. Part of a gift 4-pak that was $17.00 from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME. Best before date of Aug 13, 2014 - I couldn't wait!"
"Drinkability- It would take me some time to finish a few of these, but time well spent"
"carbonation with sweet dark spicey clove and slightly dry end to finish makes this one of my new favorites at the bar, thanks Matt Lonardo, co-owner for this find!"
"The feel is a but medium bodies and goes down well."
"D) St. Bernardus consistently produces a quality product. ABT 12 is in a class of its own. This is a fine beer -- but beware it's strong. A wonderful selection; a real treat."
"Fruity nose and rather complex mingling red fruit, grapes, plums and also a delicious smell of brown sugar. The entry in the mouth is a drought of toast, only then the flavors of fruit soaked in alcohol and coconut are emerging. Finish of roasted malt. The alcoholic strength is not quickly discernable, which makes this beer a compromise gentle enough for ""style quadrupel"""
"this is transcendant. delicious. I can't get enough. the world needs this beer."
"Overall one of my favorite beers of all time."
"The head, nose and lacing remains strong through out the goblet. All the sensory impact of this beer lends it to be very drinkable. Dare I say, addictive."
"I have one more 750ml bottle that I will keep for 10 years before I open, I really want to see how this ages."
"This is an awesome brew even better if you let one age a few years. Along this lines of a Westy and Chimay grand reserve..Great raisin dark fruit flavor. Slight alcohol presence but overall a Belgian classic. As this bad boy warms the flavors seem to get more interesting as well. Nice easy malt back bone with the classic Belgian yeast flavor! great brew for sure.."
"nothing spectacular about the drinkability that would make it the extra point. but really good.."
"D-this is so smooth and sweet with huge fruit flavor, an amazing mouthfeel and huge alcohol that is not present at all!"
"Taste: Nice sweetness to it but very good in the amount with a slightly toasted taste. Even though the abv is really high there is very little taste of it."
"Merry Christmas!"
"Final note: not that I need to say this (as it's written on the bottle), but this beer is *begging* to be aged. Huge complexity right off the shelf plus strong carbonation plus high ABV plus a bigger hoppiness than most Belgian strong ales equals this beer couldn't be anything but amazing with a few years of age on it."
"Dark brown with hints of mahogany showing through. Two fingers of medium tan head with staying power and dots of lacing. Medium bodied with a silky mouthfeel. Nose of malt, yeast, and dare I say banana nut bread... Initial taste of brown sugar, yeast, allspice, mid-palate alcohol with finish of hops and dark chocolate. Malt flavor throughout. Nothing about this beer is offensive. Very nicely balanced and looks great in the glass. Drinkability is def. better than average for this ABV but not for sessioning. High marks!"
"i remember this being a lil better the first time i had it, maybe i'm not remembering correctly."
"D- You sip this not because you have to but rather you do because you want to savor every last drop of this heavenly goodness. This is the beer that made the lightbulb turn on when I started trying different styles at the beginning of my craft beer journey. I still think it's the best of all the quads I've tried, but I haven't yet had a Westy 12."
"drinkability : buy 4 bottles. cellar two and share two immediately with friends. this is pretty special."
"Overall, this beer is outstanding, with out a doubt. I found myself taking smaller drinks each time to try and savor the flavor and to push myself to find new flavor notes. I'd highly suggest this beer to anyone. Cheers."
"Drinkability: Wow, no wonder this is one of the top beers. Amazing flavors, well blended, and backed by great b"
"D: Well, you almost never can't go wrong with a quad - and this beer is no exception. A really nice and complex beer."
"A half finger's worth of light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Nose was dried dark fruits (prunes, raisins, blackberries). Mouthfeel was full with some heat and a fruity sweetness. Finish was juicy, sweet, raisiny. Why did I let The Chauffeur talk me into this? Too good to be true."
"Overall - This is a great beer, and a truly unique belgian in my mind. Flavors are incredibly profound."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Huge beer here so don't get carried away but for its abv, its incredibly drinkable."
"Overall: The mouth feel is strong alcohol warming, carbonation, and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium with a full finish. This beer is on steroids the flavors just blow up in your mouth and yet it is pleasant to drink. I have only review a few quads and this is one of the better ones that I have tried. I was in fear that since the bottle erupted on me that it was going to compromise the beer's flavor, nonetheless, I feel that it has, but it still it very good."
"Wow, re-reviewing this beer makes me realize how far I have come. I can't believe I couldn't appreciate how excellent it was the first time around (I gave it a B). A real pleasure."
"It was served to me with a nice finger of head which lingered above the beer which had a dark brown almost chocolate like color. The nose was spicy (clove?) with hints of sweet fruit (raisin and plum perhaps). The taste is both biscuity, spicy, and sweet all at once. Although there is an alcohol presence, it is not over the top, but rather soothing and warming. This is a thick, strong, sweet beer that if you are not careful, could turn into a session beer and lead to questions of what went on the night before. One thing you will not have to question, however, is whether or not this beer is worth its price."
"I gave it a 4 on drinkability, just because I don't think this could be drunk over the course of a whole evening. Then again, I only really need one or two."
"I started drinking this after dinner and then went to play Wii, but found that the beer took more of a break because it needed my full attention to drink. There was no way I could gulp this down quickly."
"D- The alcohol is there slightly, this is a pretty warming beer."
"I'm not sure why it took me so long to find this. Up there with the legit Trappists."
"D. Like most quadtruples it hides the alcohol well. I could drink several of these without much trouble. The cost is high though so one at a time will have to do."
"D - Quads in general are tough for me in the drinkability category. Lots of alcohol that tends to be on the hot side...not at all subtle. This is no exception. Definitely a sipper. Has good flavor and aroma and is a really pretty beer, but one is definitely enough in a sitting. Very good, but tough to drink a lot of."
"Pours a deep muddy ruby brown, with a nice tan/off white head. Aroma of dried fruits, rasins, oranges, and cherries. Also a nice malty aroma. Taste is just what you would expect. A malty smoothness followed by dark cherries and fig sweetness. Although it has a high ABV its very well hidden and makes this a real nice multi-sipper if you take your time. Make sure to let it warm a little as this will really bring out the great flavors of this beer!!"
"The smell and taste were fruity, sweet, and full of alcohol, like cherries and orange slices soaked in booze. The feel was smooth with a touch of bitterness. The high ABV provides a nice warmth. This ale is a sweet and warming sipper."
"D - What many consider one of the quintessential beers, and quite possibly the closest thing to Westveterlan 12."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep brown with a huge off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap as it sticks itself all over my glass. Smells of dark fruits raisins prunes fig come to mind. Also has a sweet dark sugar and molasses aroma as well. Twinge of alcohol evident too. Taste is sweet with dark fruits, molasses, brown bread, melanoidin and alcohol. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is full and sticky sweet, body is thick. I liked this one, but I thought the alcohol was a little to present. Good, but maybe needs some age to mellow it out a bit. I also would have liked a bit less carbonation."
"D - Delicious - great from start to finish. A classic, and a must try."
"Conclusion: This is crazy soft, supple, fruity, and delicious. Glad I got to try it on tap!."
"Drinkability: I had high hopes going into tasting this beer and it did not disappoint. I will definitely be buying more to drink and some to age to see what other aromas and flavors come out of some age."
"Bottle pours a dark ruby brown with a decent amount of carbination. Smell and taste is of dark fruits, with a nice malt background in it too. The alc.% is so goddamn well hidden, its insane. This was very easy to drink, and I probably drank it too fast! I couldn't help myself. I really enjoyed this beer a lot. Another one on the top list I was glad to get my hands on."
"Drinkability is quite good for the abv. A good all night sipper that goes down easier than it should."
"Overall this a fantastic beer. I can see why it gets so much praise. Like liquid big boy candy."
"Poured a dark brown color with a nice head. The smell of raisins instantly hits my nose. Nice slight nutty flavor on the first taste. Can taste the alchohol in the mouthfeel but not overwhelming. Good drinkability all around. Definitely good on a cold winter night. Could drink another bottle."
"Pours cola brown with heavy turbidity and a large cream-colored head. Beautiful and very inviting. Aroma jumps right out of the glass. Huge complexity here, but I am clearly getting raisins, plum, cherry, amaretto, fresh-baked bread, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is complex as well. Sweet and fruity up front with unripe cherry, amaretto, and caramel malt. Alcohol is definitely noticeable at the beginning and in the finish, but not offensive, and gives an immediate warming feeling that is quite pleasant. I'm not a big fan of alcohol flavor, but this is quite enjoyable. Carbonation is high tickling the tongue and body is medium. Overall, a delicious beer. I would have several if not for the high ABV."
"Drinkability: a nice flavor profile combined with an out-of-this-world texture make this a deceptively drinkable beer, despite its incredible ABV. I enjoy it quite a lot."
"O: Excellent drinkability! A Belgian Quad masterpiece"
"somewhat light bodied for how big this beer is.not sure if this is what i pictured the cousin of the best beer in the world as."
"Sometimes less is more."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into chalice - velvet/suede looking rich brown with ruby hues in the light head falls quickly into patchy lacing- sweet malts dark fruits a tad vanilla and whatever else - tastes as good as always, a very special brew to indulge in, a classic quad. sweet delicious beer! Mouth has just the right amount of carbonation and alcohol is slowly warming, not too hot considering the abv. This is up there with the bests.. cheers"
"Wonderful beer."
"D - really should be a sipping beer, but I find no need to be reserved about quaffing it. I don't think it's as interesting / complex as some here, so it's not about to become an everyday thing, but definitely a solid Belgian."
"D: ABV doesn't quite scare me away, especially when taking delightful little sips. This was the first Belgian Quad I tried, so there is a soft spot for it...a spot it deserves."
"A big old beer, makes it a sipper. Exemplifies the style very well, but I can't say there's anything here to wow me about it. Granted, it's going to be pretty great, but I didn't find any je ne sais quois to push it over the top."
"D: This is one to take slow and appreciate, both due to it's interesting flavors and high ABV. It's definitely not difficult to drink, however."
"F: Finishes with a slight sweetness but seems to dry off pretty well considering all the age its had. A slight alcohol warmth and sting singes for a bit, then disappears enough to let you get more of the raisin, cinnamon, candi sugar, molasses, and delicious other flavors. Perhaps if anything, the aging has formed a little too much carbonation. I get some earthy flavors as well, on the finish mostly, I think a product of the yeast turning the Belgian candi sugar into the ginourmous alcohol."
"No where near as complex as I expected, and that alcohol needs to be tamed."
"d- good, the rich malt taste and the delicious mouthfeel really make this one worth it, overall this was a great beer and I would diffidently recommend it to anyone looking for a great beer to try,"
"Bottle- At the Alex P. Keaton in London, Ontario. Poured a dark brown body, medium beige head. HUGE sediment visible....almost syrup looking. Nice lacing, and the head seems to form rings in the middle of the body, very distinct. Perfect. Aromas are black licorice, rasins and prunes, saltiness, and some floral spiceyness. Taste is floral, spicy, rasins and prunes , sweet an salty, licorice too. Nice! Finish is alcohol, bitter sour aftertaste too. Great example of the style! Watch out Westy!"
"Overall a world class Quad. I tasted this back to back to a Rochefort 10 and I thought this beer was a much better offering as it provided a more balanced mouthfeel. Great, great beer."
"Overall - A great example of this style, and one of my personal favorite beers. Highly recommended!"
"Tastes like it smells, and it got smoother as it settled. There is a dry finish and nice balance overall. Hides the 10.5% ABV well and was very drinkable."
"Muddy chestnut amber with sediment left in the bottle. Medium white head, very nice lacing. Aroma of dates, raisins and cinnamon with a hint of vanilla. Taste has multiple dried fruits in a subtle and complex combination. Improves with age. Tasted at the brewery in Watou."
"I'll be having this again. A delicious Quad that is a great introduction to this style of beer."
" ~ This is a very good brew. It's a beauty and smells just as good as it looks. It seems very complex in the flavors and feel, but I think overall, I will certainly partake in this abby again."
"Beer is full bodied and smooth. Yeasty flavor, tons of malt, some sweetness from the malt / alcohol. This is a really good beer. It is not as good as I remember though. I feel like I've had better quads to date. I will try it again and review it again in the future, even though I'm giving it a good review now, it didn't live up to my memory."
"*Originally reviewed on October 24, 2009."
"I wanted like this beer more than I did but I have to say i was a little mixed on it. Good color and good dark fruit flavor and aroma but in general it wasn't a stand out quad that I wanted it to be. A very dark brown, decent carbonation but not as good as I wanted it to be."
"D-Excellent! True to style example. Juicy, dark fruit and a building dryness leads to deliciousness! 10%+ ABV barely noticed!"
"Poured a burnt amber color with a medium ivory head into a St Bernardus chalice. Smells of sweet dark fruit, caramel, molasses, just waiting to be savored. Tastes like it smells ""nectar of the Gods", I love Quad's but they are well beyond my ability to describe. Mouthfeel is great, smooth, carbonated,sweet, with enough bitterness to balance it all. Keeping in mind I am just beginning my foray into the world of fine beers, it's one of the nicest beers I have ever tried."
"Overall very good brew and I recommend it if you get the chance."
"The best part is that this beer gets better with age, up to 15 years.... Awesome"
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan 3 finger head. I can see a lot of sediment floating in the beer. Looks unappealing. Smells of Pears, brown sugar, cloves, and sweet malt. Taste is the same, and there is a lot of alcohol and sweetness. Full bodied, light carbonation, smooth, and creamy. Nicely drinkable, and highly recommended."
"Heavenly nectar of the Belgian beer gods! After pouring this dark brown, sticky sweet ale, a large latticework of foam appears and is a prime example of a beer with great head retention. Scents of toffee come to mind. Tastes of dark chocolates, candi sugar, and some nice warming from the alcohol. Also there is some dried fruit and possibly peaches? There is a nice light hop backbone in this chewy, medium/high carbonated ale. It is evident that this beer was produced with the powers of good as the ABV is hidden very well, and it is very nicely balanced as there are no overpowering elements. However, temptation is always nearby. This is a delightfully drinkable beer that demands proper respect. Too much of a good thing could lead to the dark depths of the underworld (or the floor)."
"This stuff is scary!! Insanely drinkable, ABV aside. I'm not an expert -- on my way -- but Bacchus on his beer day set this fine beer on the top shelf for a reason!!! I won't belabor its delectability as the custom is. Suffice it to say that there is not much better. Period."
"D - This is a true classic and while there are a great deal of varied flavor elements at work here, the yeast is the real star of the show. The malt provides a background of caramel sweetness on which the yeast displays a profound level of juicy, deep fruit character, balanced by lightly spicy notes. The hops make themselves known but only play a supporting role, though they posses a classic spicy, noble character. This beer is extraordinarily well balanced and despite a high alcohol content, it goes down smooth and shows no boozy harshness. If Rochefort is about malty complexity, then this is about yeasty fruit and sublime balance. It is a wonderful, and rare, experience to have a beer that lives up to its hype and as I sip this I realize that I had gone far too long without popping the cork on an ABT 12."
"Smells of grapes, currants, pear, alcohol, and raw cane sugar. Tastes of grapes, maraschino cherries, and is slightly meaty. Medium in sweetness with a tingly bitter character on the midpalate. Full bodied, though a bit lighter than its brethren, but a nice low-medium level of carbonation (in contrast to the massive head). This is not the most complex of the quads, but it makes up for it in drinkability, the more I drink of this beer the more I enjoy it."
"Drinkability is fantastic. Between the mouthfeel and depth of flavours, I don't want this glass to end...!"
"D - I could sip this all night, all day, and always. What a great beer. None of the flavors overpowers the rest and nothing is offensive in this one."
"This is it baby. This is how good beer can be. From the dark mahogany body topped with a head that you couldn't blow off if you tried, to the finish I'll still be tasting and enjoying tomorrow. Amazingly complex nose of figs, nutmeg, chocolate, cloves, cinnamon and forest fruits. I knew it was gonna be good on the palate but fuck me, this rocks hard. A full flavour that gives sweetness, bitterness, weight, more of the flavours that aroma hinted of and then a few more. Alcohol is obviously there (at 10.5 you'd be amazed if you couldn't spot it) but it isn't dominant. Happy as a pig in shit right now. Good times."
"D: An excellent quad that is scaringly drinkable... just a perfect beer to sip on through the night. Of course you wouldn't want to have two or three, but that's the kind of beer it is, right? Just awesome."
"Great color, golden, brown, and orange mixed into one. The appearance of this beer poured is welcoming and enticing. Nice head and great lace with a powerful dark and medium fruity nose. Very strong aroma. Smell and taste include ripe red apples, figs, dates, raisins, cherries, clove and Belgian yeast. The white wine, figs, dates and caramel malt flavors dominate the profile. I would say this is one of the most complex beers I've tasted. There is a lot to this beer and every taste brings new thoughts on what flavors you can find in this Quad. Mouthfeel was slightly dry and lacked creaminess yet was full with perfect carbonation. Not too drinkable for the style. A sipper with a noticeable boozy, warming finish."
"This brew is a sipper. Not to session, but a very nice taste for a cool night. Has a nice warming effect. A tasty brew to relax with. This would be an absolute substitute for wine for me. I could have this instead of a glass of burgundy wine any time, although the price is what stops that from happening.."
"Great beer for the style, and quite rich. More than worth a try."
"Drinkability is good."
"The taste is strongly alcoholic :). Some plum and red grape flavors stand out. This is definitely smooth!"
"D- If it wasn't for the fact that I already ate food and had a few beers prior, I would have a few of these easily. I know that some may compare this to Westy 12 and when you add in the fact of the elusiveness and rarity of Westy 12, I can see why. This beer is good good good."
"D: This one is one you want to last. So complex but with such a light body that I could sip it all night, concentrating on discover each and every ingredient."
"M&D: silky-smooth all way through, the carbonation is tuned to perfection (as far as my palate is concerned) and lifts up the whole body ever so skillfully, while the lack of any sign of alcohol also helps in this regard. The low level of saltiness works so well with the sweet side of overall flavour and the exotic yeastiness is just about moderate - sufficient to make a nice difference... For a Quadrupel, a style that I have only limited experience with, I find this ale one of the most harmoniously balanced, which by implication makes it also the most drinkable nectar for me~~"
"D- I could really enjoy sipping on this all night."
"Spiced sweet fruit entry, rich but not cloying, leading to an alcohol-induced warm finish and fade that lingers (and lingers). Lightly carbonated and subtle on the whole, making this high alcohol brew deceptively easy to drink."
"D: Excellent for sipping and enjoying at a leisurely pace."
"D: Very easy to drink, despite it's alcohol content. Abt 12 is one of the most approachable quads I have come across. This is right up there with Rochefort 10 and Westy 12."
"D - Immensely drinkable. It just goes down so easily. I think I could drink six of these in less than an hour - if I could afford it! Every sip is a pleasure."
"D: Great beer, I liked this quite a bit..not the best quad i've ever had but very tasty."
"D: This is one of this Belgians that is unbelievably balanced and tasty. Although I've had lots of beers i like better, there's something about a beer like this that makes them come out almost as perfection in a bottle - everything is at its place and I wouldn't want to change a thing."
"Very enjoyable. High quality with lots of character. Not the top of the style but close to it. A must try belgian."
"M/D: Thick and creamy. The head was really nice, but disappeared too quickly IMHO. It takes a while to drink, and it's meant to be. Pretty good."
"Just had this at a tasting with the head brewer. Really great guy. I did not realize that this beer is made with the original Westvletern yeast strain. It is an excpetional beer and the only way to get a beer made with this yeast strain, as westvleteren lost it unfortunately. It is a big beer, made for sipping."
"D: Nice autumn sipping beer and one I'm glad I finally got the chance to enjoy. After this and Rochefort 10, I'm pretty sure I'll never enjoy Quads as much as some, but I can still respect a beer with this level of quality. Not an extreme US brew by any means, but a very well rounded classic. Even if you're not a bit Quad fan like me, all beer lovers should try this brew!"
"D - Decent, but not on the same level as something like Westy 12. This becomes a bit much after awhile."
"Overall: one of the best beers out there. Nothing more, nothing less. Highly recommendable."
"The aroma is sweet with raisin and malt and some alcohol. The taste is sweet dark fruits with some alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation was moderate and appropriate. Finnish was fairly dry and clean. A great representation of the style."
"11.2oz. bottle served at 48 degrees in my new DFH chalice. 22 01 14 indicated on the back label. Poured a hazy plum color with a frothy, three inch, off-white head. Excellent retention - head eventually settles into a dense, half inch cap with thick, delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew was consumed. The nucleation point in the glass did a great job keeping things moving. Nose was dark fruit (plums, figs, raisins) and slightly vinous on a big malty backbone; maybe a hint of brown sugar, candi sugar and chocolate malt in the mix. Taste consistent with nose; however, a little boozy and some heat at the finish - vinous quality really comes out and lingers at the end. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lightly, yet evenly carbonated, with some mild astringency at the finish. Probably one of the most drinkable quads out there. Some alcohol heat, but not overpowering considering the 10.5% abv."
"D: Bring it on... Too drinkable. Great beer. It's exceptional like rochefort 10 but unique in it's own way."
"Def. happy to have had the opportunity of trying this out, and its a great way to wow someone new to the beer world, this guys got history and all the aspects to back it. All in all, I'm buying this again."
"D - alcohol is well hidden, this one goes down so easy its criminal. worth every penny!"
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Has a sweet finish, with the alcohol also warming."
"Thin, bubbly head disappears in a flash leaving behind minimal lacing. Color is cloudy iced-tea orange, and the aroma is a pleasant bready-citrusy cloud; if I could bottle it as perfume I'd make a mint at beer tastings. There's a pungent smack of alcohol that at first masks the fruity base of this beer, leaving bread and wheat at the forefront but the aftertaste reveals bananas, oranges, cherries and cloves and a sweetness that lingers for minutes after each swallow. A nicely dense body carries a super-fizzy tang that burns a bit. Drink this one slowly, and not just because of the ABV which sneaks up and hits hard: the flavors that develop long after you've swallowed develop into a wonderful bouquet. A nice treat for me and my wife at the end of our summer vacation."
"Poured into a goblet with a nice thick head, gorgeous dark brown body. Smells like dark fruits with some spice. Tastes amazing; ripe dark fruits... picking up raisin/prune mostly, sweet caramel maltiness, and the classic Belgian yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel was nice and full, although the carbonation was a little high at first. Drinkability was surprising for such a strong beer. Really enjoyed drinking this, wish it was more readily available in Ontario."
"Drinkability: This definitely a beer I would have again and of course to share with a female who is sure to enjoy it as well."
"D- What more can I say about this beer, it goes down great, super smooth and only gets better when it warms up a bit. This I could sip on all the time."
"Drinkability: I could've drank cold cat-piss yesterday and have cooled off, but this beer was everything I could've asked for and more. Smooth, tasty, complex, and delicious. I'm definitely grabbing a few bottles to age, this beer deserves to be known as one of the best. And here's to hoping the Westy 12 I've got aging is even more fantastic!"
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, this beer pours a dark brown but still pretty clear color, sediment is spread throughout like pepper flakes and a nice white sheet is on top of the beer during the whole drinking process. Head is small and creamy but still dissipates fairly quickly, minimal lacing is left on my glass. I remember my previous Abt. 12 leaving good lacing though. Smells like a good Belgian beer, raisins, yeast, bready scents and some malts, maybe a small bit of alcohol. Tastes like all of the above things mentioned with some good spice to it, probably my favorite tasting Belgian that I have had yet. Mouthfeel is good, medium with some creamyness and alcohol warming, a perfect amount of it, a raisiney aftertaste coats the entire mouth. Drinkability is good here because of the exceptional taste, however the raisin and alcohol will bring it down after a bottle or so, can't wait to age some of these."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a small fluffy head that scurries away with no lacing left behind, but leaves a tasty looking blanket swirling around on top. There is a fair amount of sediment floating around in there and a very faint but detectable flow of bubbles. The smell is yeasty with some dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs), and baked goods, with a splice of alcohol in there. Taste is all the flavors with a bit of extra spice thrown in there. Sweet flavors dominate. The mouth feel is beautiful. Covers every square inch with a silky sheet and balances it out with a good dose of carbonation. Finish is subtly dry. This one warms up your innards. Good drinkability considering the complexity and abv of this one."
"Dark russet brown with a big stiff airy tan head that leaves nice spiderweb lace on the glass as it slowly settles. Aromas of dark fruit, fresh bread dough and belgian spice make for a really good nose. Dark fruit, rum, apples, cinnamon and fresh baked bread come to mind, complexity grows with each sip, alcohol is fairly well hidden. Very high carbonation adds to the drinkability on this one. A truly world class beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - I would say relatively drinkable for a beer of this caliber and ABV, though quite honestly I feel it does not hide the alcohol as well as I thought it might be able to (in comparison to other higher ABV beers). However, this is not a problem for me because I am thoroughly enjoying it on my porch with the coolness around me. It makes me feel nice and warm inside."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for such a flavorful, intense beer."
"D-There was honestly a bit too much heat in this bottle for my taste. It warmed me more than I expect from any beer. I'll have it again some time, but I will not be rushing out to buy another bottle any time soon."
"a wonderful beer! i would love too drink one thats been in a cellar for a few years. buy it drink it any questions?"
"Pours brown with a generous head that stays there throughout the sampling. The aroma was sweet, malty and syrupy. The taste didn't match the syrupy sweetness that the aroma implied, but still sweet, nutty and bubbly. The feel was medium bodied but rolled onto the tongue on a wave of carbonated ball bearings. Drinkability: I was able to knock down a bomber with no difficulties, but a second one would have been a stretch. All in all, not my favorite quad (Rochefort 10), but a damn fine beer."
"Bottle pours a very dark brown color. Head is a tan color and retention is very long. Smells like yeast and alcohol. Tastes like alcohol with some mild fruit flavors. The dark fruits meld together to form a nice complex drink. Very smooth on the palate which makes it easy to drink."
"I find this interesting how this is not a Trappist product, but how the knock-offs can taste quite a bit better than the real thing."
"Overall, this is a great Trappist style ale, and for a quad it isn't too sweet. This is one you sit back, sip, and appreciate what the brewers have done."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, aside from some warming of the alcohol. Even with that being said, I find this beer highly drinkable. I could easily have more than one of these in a sitting. However, tonight is special since I'm cracking open my first Westy 12 after this to do a head to head comparison. Can't wait."
"For a quad, I find it pretty well done. The strength and sweetness of the beer is tempered by its complexity and tastiness. It's still a sipper, to be sure, but not like other quads where a few sips will do you."
"Really quite good but only one at a time please"
"Carbonation is perfect, allowing the soft and supple tastes to flow through to the end. Wet and grainy on the back end, but very creamy and very smooth."
"D- There is a reason that this is so highly rated. Great Belgian flavor with loads of complexity. Nice sipping brew."
"Despite everything great I have heard, I still prefer some other Quads/Strong Darks, such as Scaldis Noel and Delirium Nocturnum."
"Drinkabality- this beer is so so drinkable its dangerous never once did i ever feel as if it was a 10 percent beer, with the hype around this beer I was nervous if it would live up to it, I feel it definitely did as it is by far to me the best abbey quad i have had to date, a real treat and worth the price, complex enjoyable and something surely to be visited again, OH HEAVENLY NECTAR"
"D: Extremely drinkable. Quickly working its way to the top of my favorites list. I could enjoy a few of these without a problem...in fact, after one it makes me want to have another! The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't detract from the experience at all. Overall a great example of the style, and one of the best brews out there today."
"D - Easy to drink. For a quad, I could put away a couple of these because of how relatively light it is. Would do this one again."
"bernie is the man"
"D-- one 750 is enough. Could do 2 smaller ones. not nearly as big as others in this class but still solid. I love the Christmas Ale and like this but I prefer the Christmas just a bit more. Will note that this a review of a warmer beer as it was in a cellar. Very drinkable as the sugars are not as overpowering. Malt is almost at the right touch. the 10% lets you know it is there but nothing that just beats you down. Take your time and enjoy this puppy."
"Not clingy at all, very quaffable for a quad. Curious to try the bottle now."
"This is probably the best dark abbey I've tasted. I prefer tripels but this is nice."
"Overall: I'm going to stock up before it goes away. I'd never seen it before in the supermarket, and I don't want to not see it ever again. Excellent beer. I love strong dark beers, and this one balances bitter and sweet perfectly."
"D- Very sessionable beer. Not too terribly overwhelming, but still forceful enough to mke you consider flavors and undertones."
"Very drinkable with some smoked cheese or tender meat, maybe dark rye bread. My favorite belgian and one of the best beers out there."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable for a beer of its ABV profile. Would have multiple if that wouldnt get in the way, but like a good meal, the smaller portion works best."
"-Bye"
"Notes: Definatley a great beer for a cool summer or spring night. Or maybe even better a cold winter night. Cheers."
"Poured from a bottle. Hazy auburn color with a nice white head that lasts all the way till the end. Smells of dried fruits and alcohol (expected for a 10%). Taste is pretty complex; there is a distinct spice flavor combined with an alcoholic one. However, you could probably taste other flavors during the savoring portion, definitely a sipping beer. Lasting carbonation and a thick creamy feel overall. Overall a very good and complex beer; drink slowly."
"D - This a very delicious and easy drink, one of my favorite beers, the flavors of this beer keeps me coming back for more"
"This is alarmingly good. I drank that bottle FAST. I remember not liking this one a ton the first time I tried it because of phenolic brightness, but that isn't striking me this time. The predominant flavor is a candy tangy malt with cracked pepper. Awesome. World class. I'd like to taste one with some age."
"Rich and creamy very smooth. higher on the carbonation side. This beer really just brings out the most in its beautiful flavors."
"Overall, this is a sipper, but I do like it a lot. Not something I would buy a lot of, but every once in a while it would be a nice treat."
"The texture is as close to perfect as I've had. This base mixes the cast of flavors just right. It's a very tight, small carbonation that is complimentary. Easy to drink without toning down the beer."
"This is a winter beer, that's for sure. With the Pater 6 and Prior 8 more suited for other seasons, the Abt 12 rounds it out so that at any point in the year, there is a St. Bernardus beer that I can go to and thoroughly enjoy."
"Overall a very good, complex beer."
"Drinkability: Very good, extremely smooth & creamy. Simply put a world class beer."
"D: Not bad, but not sure if it's worth the hype. I know it's a quad, but the alcohol taste was a bit more than I was hoping for."
"D - Tncredibly smooth. The alcohol is present and I suspect would mellow out with some age. In the present state though it is incredibly drinkable and I wish I had purchased the 750ml bottled."
"This beer is consistently rated among the top 100 among beer sites and for good reason. Everything checks out, coming together excellently. Its drinkability, while 10% ABV, affords enough for two to three per session. It's that good. And, it's even better on tap (which is why I give it an A+ rating)."
"This is an AMAZING Belgian beer. Overall very smooth and tasty. If you can find it, grab one, but at 10.5% ABV, take them SLOW!"
"I'm a bit disappointed in this beer. I had big hopes for it. I like quads (Rochefort 10 is excellent), but this one is just not for me."
"Brown color with cola-like appearance. Sweet dark fruits, a bit of prune juice and molasses on the palate. World class beer for sure, possibly surpassed among quads only by Westy 12. A tad more body and a little less alcohol in the flavor would surely put it a notch higher"
"Drinkability is where this gets tricky. Would I drink this all night if I could? Hell yes. But the alcohol is really high and the price is even higher. This stuff is going to become a once-a-month treat. Crazy, crazy shit."
"On tap at Blend in Cedar Rapids. Dark brown with a huge white head. Aroma of sweet fruits and alcohol. Sweet with more fruits in the flavor, mostly green apples and pears. A nice hint of bitter thrown in with the sweetness. Finishes with a strong alcohol bite, very warming."
"Drinkability: Would be surprisingly refreshing on a hot day for such a dark beer. Yes I would definitely have another."
"Taste is rather spritzy, assertive carbonation yet doesn't interrupt the creaminess of this quad, the banana and clove shine through more in the taste, slight alcohol presence in the aftertaste."
"D: What? This was a 10.5% abv beer? I didn't notice 'til I finished the bottle and stood up. Amazingly drinkable for a 10.5% abv beer."
"The head on this beer is creamy and huge. The beer is a chocolate brown and cloudy. It smells of fruit and lightly roasted malt, the smell brings back memories of apple juice. The first thing I noticed about the taste of this beer was balance. The light alcohol flavor is perfectly balanced with sweet fruit and malt with a bitter aftertaste. I have still not acquired a taste for this style yet but I see that this is a very complex, excellent beer. A little sweet for my tastes but I did enjoy the combinations of flavors."
"It tastes a bit like chocolate and coffee. Its a heavy beer that goes down smooth with the right amount of bitterness at the end."
"Drinkability: Well, nothing makes me happier. This was actually the first Belgian that I ever tried at the suggestion of some random beer store guy about 7 years ago. It has been my favorite beer ever since and opened me up to Belgians in general (I've never had a Westy and I like it better that Rochefort). At six bucks for 11.2 oz of perfection, its a steal."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly easy to drink, and no way this seems like 10 percent alcohol. The flavors are more subtle than full flavored, so it's a good sipping beer. I enjoyed this."
"O: This is a very good got to Belgian quad. It is consistent and delicious."
"I dont think this would be my choice to sip by itself at the end of the day. But with the fullness of flavour this is possibly my favourite quad (so far) to drink with a good meal (say a spicy red pasta dish)."
"Plus, this is my first review, thats gotta be worth something..."
"A very good representation of the quad style and much more sweeter than Rochefort 10"
"This is the best Quad I've ever had. Deliciously drinkable, which makes that ABV a little dangerous."
"Poured into a La Trappe chalice. Dark brown with a foaming head that takes time to settle. Deep fruity smell and tastes as good as it smells, excellent. About the right carbonation too and the beer just slides down. Could easily drink a few and then fall over - worth any loss of skin."
"This was a glorious beer. It was served in a goblet. It was at the right temperature. The color was a nice deep brown. There was a pleasant sweetness with a hint of bitterness. This is one of the best beers I have tasted."
"Overall - This is at least one of the gold standards for big beers; the kind you relax with at the end of the day, sipping away and enjoying every flavorful nuance while sitting in an easy chair with a velvet robe, acting snooty. Or you could do what I just did and say 'This beer rocks!' before belching loudly. Heavenly nectar, indeed."
"D - Great beer, I would have a few more, but wouldn't be sitting down to throw back a bunch of these, especially not at the price they're fetching for it."
"This beer is damn near perfect... period. At the time of this writing, it is my favorite Belgian, and while I do enjoy others, they pale in comparison, at least in terms of sheer complexity and grace. Mandatory drinking. You MUST try this at least once."
"Drinkability is exceptional. Alcohol is apparent in warmth but not in the mouth, and it's never boozy by any stretch of the imagination. World Class."
"Overall, was somewhat put off by the appearance, but flavor makes up for it. Wonderful complex mix of scents and taste. Recommend."
"I finally got around to drinking this and I am happy that I did. The alcohol is not noticeable in the least...not in aroma or in flavor. Lots of dried fruit...mostly plums, raisins, and a little bit of pear. Not sweet at all. Smoothed and mellow. Very easy but yet entertaining to drink. Thirst quenching actually and very well rounded."
"Not too sweet, not to hot, not too alcoholic, a classic beer."
"Served in snifter out of bottle at the Cloverleaf in Caldwell.. Certainly lived up to its status.. I don't always get so into darker Belgian stuff, but this is certainly awesome.. pours quite dark with a very foamy off-white head. Smells of dark fruits and candy sugar, very sweet. Flavor follows the aroma, fruity, sugary and only the slightest bit of spice, something which I think some Belgian style beers over-due. Very smooth. The mouth is full-bodied with crisp carbonation. Overall its quite delicious and surprisingly smooth for its high abv.. all aroung great."
"Drinkability is quite low. Very sweet and really boozy, this beer is a big time sipper. Not surprising from a quad."
"Overall excellent but I wish I had been more patient waiting for it to warm. That's when the flavors really come out."
"Compliments good bread and a nice Danish blue cheese wonderfully."
"Well, cheers--"
"Quite an enjoyable beer and quite drinkable. But you won't get through many of these in one sitting"
"D - allround nice, easy drinking quad"
"Sweet and toasty with a lingering carbonation and alcohol induced bitterness on the finish. Yeast adds some nice complexities of figs, raisins and dark bread loaves. Chewy, toffee and nutty even...hell, nearly any beer flavor can be found in this brew besides hoppy or citrus notes. What I like about this beer is that it maintains a sweet malty profile without being syrupy or sticky. Has a mineraly/gypsum flavor in there that helps add some dryness. Very finely crafted beer that is just a treat to sip on and feel fortunate to be able to buy anytime I want."
"Overall: 4.45; A"
"What else can be said about one of the best beers in the world IMHO? Beautiful 2 finger head and luscious smells of dark fruits are present. Taste is of raisins, plums and figs and is so ridiculously drinkable. The ABV is hidden so perfectly. This is one of the great ones for sure. I have had this beer so many times and it never, ever gets old! AMAZING!!!"
"this beer just has the best smell and appearance to me. you cannot go wrong with a st b abt 12!"
"Drinkability: Definitely a very nice flavor, but a little strong, maybe even a little bit sweet to get through that many. I might have to rotate to something in to complement it."
"This beer in in my top 5 of all time."
"D: Again, these higher ABV beers take a hit here with me. Easy to drink, but, just can't do it without falling down!"
"OVERALL: A very tasty treat, but the feel kept it back a little bit. A thicker feel would get this one over the hump. As part of the Quad Showdown, this one was comparable to the the Westvleteren 12, but both were well behind the Rochefort 10. Though this is a good beer and I'd definitely have it again, I find it is overrated and, in the end, more hype than substance."
"T/M: Sweet ripe berries and raisins with a spicy backdrop. The alcohol builds up slowly and crescendos with a faint medicinal improve. Nice heavier bodied quad with a surprisingly creamy texture for all the carbonation."
"Overall impression: Awesome beer fresh. Very much looking forward to trying this aged."
"All things considered, it's not a huge and boisterous Belgian bomb, but it's tight, accurate and true to style. Very, very easy to drink for what it is. I could drink it all night, which is quite an amazing property for such a strong beer."
"This is a very fine brew and one everyone needs to try. High ABV lowers drinkability just slightly."
"Poured from a bottle in to my Chimey Goblet. Pours a very amber brown with lots of clouds spinning in the glass. Sediment floats all around in this brew, just looking at it you know it has allot of flavor to it. The head forms with out even trying and releases a great set of smells that are greatly respected. Lots of dark fruits hit the nose, figs, raisans and others. Dark Alcohol molassas smell aswell hits the nose possibly from the malt. The taste is also very refreashing one thing I noticed of the bat was the beer did not seem 10.5 alc and more of a 5. alc. The flavors in this beer mask the alcohol amount very well but are still present and help lift the flavors. Again dark fruits with molassas and a bit of spice to it. Everything is balanced in this brew exceptionaly well. The flavor is not overly complex were I need to sit, relax, and reflect but one that I can continue to do what im doing and drink. The mouthfeel is very good and the carbonation is perfectly matched. The carbonation lifts the flavors to your pallet with ease and does not dmg your taste buds in anyway. Drinkability is good due to the taste and smoothness this brew carries. The alcohol level is 10.5% and it will sneek up on you. Love this beer and will continue to stock it."
"D: This is one fine beer. I was through my little bottle in what felt like no time. I'm really happy I finally tried Abt 12."
"This is my first Belgian quad and it is a beauty. I don't have access to Westy 12, but I can get the Abt 12 easily and for a reasonable price, and this is a gem. Complex, delicious and seductively powerful. Definitely deserving of one of the best ratings on BA."
"An okay beer - guess I've come to the conclusion that quads aren't my beer."
"D - I finished the glass no problems, putting the thoughts of urinal cakes out of my mind. It's still a good beer, just give it time to grow up guys! It's a stinky child."
"Notes: I recently had this on tap and found I preferred it from the bottle. From the tap the alcohol seemed to be more assertive. This is quickly becoming my go-to beer when I am in the mood for a big Belgian."
"This is about as drinkable as it can get at 10.5%. A slight burn in the finish is the only indication I found of a high ABV, it is really masked quite nicely."
"Overall, just an amazing brew. Very complex and soothing. Hides the alcohol very well. Glad I've got some more in storage."
"Drinkability - Amazingly drinkable for 10.5%. The spice really helps from being overwhelmed by the sweetness."
"Notes: My wife's favorite beer of all times. Her question: ""how could you not love it?"" I love the monk on the bottle. He seems to be simultaneously absolving you from your sins while leading you into temptation."
"4.5 D: This is one hell of a tasty beer."
"I would love to cellar some of this to see how it changes."
"33cl bottle at De Wildeman, Amsterdam. Dark, murky brown with a big tan head that lasts a good bit. Aroma is really malty with ripe fruit, brown sugar sweetness and some alcohol. The flavor is very sweet - the sweetest of the quads that I've had. It's a nice sweetness though; not cloying. Very good as a dessert drink. I think that the sweetness does suppress other flavor qualities though. Thick with smooth carbonation and a slightly sticky finish. Very nice, but not as elegant as Rochefort, or a drinkable as Westy. Had it a just below room temp at De Wildeman, and tried it the next day on draught at Gollem, which served it much colder, and I have to say that it was much better warmer."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours orangey brown with a lot of sediment. Nice off-white head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. Smells incredibly sweet, with banana, brown sugar, spice, and a slight bit of alcohol warmth. Tastes of banana, brown sugar, and slightly toasty malt. Some bitterness and a good bit of alcohol burn. Feel is nice and velvety, without being syrupy. Slight warmth. Pretty nice overall. At least better than the oxidized Westvleteren I'm drinking it with."
"Drinkability ought to be judged within the style, and it is a solidly drinkable quad. I'd put it up against most dubbels and tripels I've tasted."
"Drinkability: This beer was great and I'll deffinately seek it out again, but one 750 mL bottle is more than enough. The alcohol kills your tastebuds towards the end, so I feel trying to drink more is just a waste."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable. Delicious, I'm happy with this one after being slightly disappointed with the Tripel"
"This one is going to be a staple for me. Not as expensive as the Westy 12 or Rochefort 10 and I think it competes with either of them."
"Drinkability - If you can't/don't enjoy a good Belgian brew every now and then there's something misfiring in your wiring. A wonderful example of a ""Quad."""
"Pours a deep brown color with an impeccable off white head that sticks around the whole brew. Smells like spices, berries, malt, bread, tree fruits, even a hint of ocean breeze. Taste is even more impressive than the smell, very sweet and spicy--always a match made in heaven. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, not a hint of the high ABV. I could easily throw back a few of these."
"Drinkability- while I have savored this beer over 2 days due to its high alcohol content, this is a beer that I would happily imbibe (22 oz) if it were not for finals. Anything more than a 750 ml bottle is not only irresponsible, but I would also not drink that much of such a delicious beer and I am also not a millionaire. If I had no respect for good beer, I was a drunk, and I had expendable income I would bathe in this stuff, first class all the way."
"D. Exceptionally drinkable beer. This is one of if not my most favorite beers. What makes this beer so great is a complexity that is perfectly balanced into one of the better beers in the world."
"Quite malty on the palate with again, quite a sour flavour coming through, also very spicy with a peppery, Shiraz kind of character. A bit of a flat palate profile though, with only one note sounding. That one note is very complex and unique though, with hints of licorice, a lot of pepper and methinks a a fair hit of alcohol which gives it quite a burning mouthfeel, like a good slug of scotch. It if full though, and very interesting. Can't say I love it, but it's interesting and quite palatable."
"D: Fairly drinkable; definitely a sipper. Not everything fits together perfectly, but a very good beer."
"I'm uncertain to call this beer worldclass, but it's certainly a very good one. Good one for Christmas time."
"Mouthfeel: More full bodied than any tripel or dubbel, with a lot of sharp carbonation."
"I could drink a good bit of this if I were to throw caution to the wind. An excellent beer and worth buying by the case. Trust the happy monk."
"At 10 percent alcohol, you can't feel it. It is such a well balanced brew. The malts are not too dominant; the bitter character is reminiscent of angustoro."
"medium to heavy mouthfeel. sour like champagne like carbonation that settles out towards the end. about as good drinkability as any 10% beer, but very enjoyable. i recommend to any belgian lover."
"D: Well, at 10.5% it's hardly a session beer, but I'd have more than one if someone else was driving."
"D- easy enough to finish, but not my favorite of the style. something ill come back to, just not for a while."
"pours up a deep mahogany color with a grand tan crown. great lacing. the nose is deep malts, wood, earth, chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, Belgian candy sugar, slight tart strawberries. Superb! the taste is nice and complex. I get basically the same characters that were in the aroma and its oh so good! dark fruits, sweet malts, caramel apple, high fizzy carbo and medium to full bodied. Always a classic!"
"D- I can't add any more to the joys that have been written about this beer. The bottle I had was around 8 months old and I would have liked to have given it a bit longer, but things do not always work out that way."
" A muddy reddish/brown color body,average sized frothy off-white head that diminished to a thin cap,lots of lacing,loads of tiny carbonation bubbles. Aroma is rich and malty,earthy,a bit of wood,baked bread,and hints of alcohol,rasins and tobacco. Flavor is very complex and everchanging, a bready yeasty malt with notes of grapes,cherries,clove,wood,some burbon like flavors at times, more dates and rasins as it warms. Full body,zesty clensing sort of mouthfeel from the carbonation, a nice little sweet warming finish.I would not call this sessionable,one seemed plenty for a sitting. A VERY good and well crafted,complex brew. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"Drinkability: This complex beer is quite nice for sipping and the aroma and flavors almost seem to become even more complex with time. But one does not tire of them as is the case with some beers. At 10% ABV this is a one a night beer, but one I'll be revisiting in the future. This is one beer that illustrates why drinking beer can be a true pleasure."
"Mmmm...gotta love the Bernardus. First come rich, chewy notes of dark fruit such as raisin, fig, and apricot. Then unfolds complex layers of caramel and chocolate malts. Lastly, a dusting of spice and earthen hops leave a peppery bitterness along the back of the palate that mingles with a nice booziness. Body is a bit too over-carbonated for my liking, but finally mellows after ~20 minutes in the glass. Still, the medium-thickness is relatively slick and smooth on the whole. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is the greatest Belgian friend you'll ever have; always there in the clutch, and the company is never disappointing."
"This is a big beer, but I'm glad I finally had the chance to try this one."
"This is my favorite beer I have had to date. The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability are perfect. Thats why we keep trying these beers."
"Poured into my Westmalle chalice, it's a deep brown with a small tan head. Good lacing. I'm getting all the fruity, sweet smells, and there's a good balance sweetness and spice in the taste. The alcohol is well-hidden, and despite the incredibly complex taste profile, it's so balanced that it's very easy to drink."
"Poured at cellar temp into Westmalle chalice finding a nice 1.5cm frothy and light head over dark brew that smelled of sweet malts, floral, almost raisen and carmel-like nose to me. The head melts throughout the session but doesn't fully dissipate which is nice. Taste is again full of raisen/currant sweetness, malt, carmel later..floral notes and alcohol at the finish that more than hints at the higher %ABV. Mouthfeel is quite good, in my opinion very drinkable though obviously one to sip and savor."
"D: Again, compelling and a great drink, but I couldn't do more than one at a time."
"Bottle Pours a beautiful deep brown-black with a generous off white head. The head last nicely. Has a great sweet aroma of fruits. I get plums, cherries, and grapes. Wow the flavor is awesome. Great carbination. A wonderful mouthfeel. Taste is not too sweet. The alcohol is hidden very well. This is blended great. Has a good robust finish. This is just an awesome beer."
"D - a thoroughly dangerous beer. ruins you for others."
"This beer is one of my favorites. I had revisited this beer last night. As soon as I open a bottle I can see the beer is very lively. The head of the beer if nice light brown and has an aroma of spices. The taste is out of this world, very crisp and clean, with a hint of brown sugar. This is my favorite beer to sip on out of my St. Bernardus tulip. This beer leaves me feeling like I can walk on water."
"Poured from a bottle into my Duvel tulip. Color is dark brown with a cream-colored head. Awesome smell of sweet fruits and molasses that beg you to drink it! Taste is great, fruity with dark chocolate and a small amount of spice with a very small hint of alcohol. I'm surprised I cannot taste more of the alcohol since it's a 10.5%er. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and has a nice clean finish. I could drink this beer over and over again but then I'd probably be asleep by 6pm every night from drinking too much of it!"
"Poured to a nice dark brown color with a small head. Nice aroma, very fruity with a hint of nuttiness. Smell reminded me of pineapple. Nice fruity taste, very smooth and clean, went down easily, no hint of alcohol. Enjoyed this beer and would drink again."
"D=Drinkable but would probably be tough to drink more than the bottle."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style, although for obvious reasons Belgian Quads are not by any means session beers. Two of these is enough."
"This stuff goes down nice not a hint of the 10.5 percent alcohol."
"D- Despite the dark color and nature of this beer, it still leaves a light and up lifting flavor. Despite the high ABV it is a smooth sip from start to end. Overall its a great beer but I can only imagine it for special occasions or rarely. Not a session beer by any means. I imagine it'll be a nice treat occasionally."
"Overall a spot on beer, will be drinking again."
"I hate to keep comparing this to the Westvleteren 12 but it's impossible not to. With that said, I feel that Berny is the superior beer."
"Well overall this definately is a cheaper version of the Westy 12. Drinkability is not high for me and I could not see myself drinking more then one. I dont think I will seek this one out as it did not WOW me."
"I wonder what some age would do to this one."
"Overall: My first time trying this beer, and I am indeed impressed. Wonderful beer. It's got awesome malty and sugary tones and the only thing I wish for is a bit less carbonation."
"D: A real treat. I savored this 4 pack over a span of about 3 months. I didn't look forward to the day it would be gone, but I know I can always pick some up at the store. Excellent availability, excellent taste, and not too heavy body allow this beer to be consumed in almost any season. It is quite drinkable for a quad. I sometimes base the drinkability on whether or not I get cravings for it... I do for this beer."
"Pours out a hazy dark brown, with some ruby highlights. The head fluffs up then fades back, leaving very little lacing, but a thin layer of bubbles sits on top for quite a while. A little light and a little less frothy than I like, but still looks good. The smell reminds me a little bit of pipe tobacco, with very earthy, woody notes and some dark fruits, whiffs of alcohol and sugar, like rum and raisins. There's also a bit of dryness mixed in with a kind of bitter chocolate smell. A lot of complexity in the smell, but I'm not sure if it smells as rich as some quads. The taste hardly matches the smell as well as I'd hope. At first there a caramel taste, like a good, clean dubbel, mixed in with a heavy earthy flavor. Then the dryness kicks in. There's also a spiciness, peppery and almost like Indian spices, with warming, almost harsh alcohol. After getting into the drink, I notice a kind of candy sweetness in the finish. It isn't bad, kind of like the cleanest of quads, but it lacks the really enjoyable depth, and the huge spicy, earth (read: tobacco) notes don't bring it to where I expect. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy, but not entirely full. The carbonation is also a bit annoying, it stings the tongue and mouth with every sip. But it is still about what I'd expect. The unobtrusiveness of the beer helps the drinkability, though the alcohol can catch you quickly."
"11.2 ounce bottle reads a best before date of 26/03/13. Beer poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. A nice 3 finger head is formed which slowly dissipates into thin coat on the beer after a few minutes and a few sips. Beer is dark chocolate brown in color with ample yeast floaties (I did pour the entire bottle into the beer as I enjoy the yeast). Nose is very complex with a mix of dark fruits, chocolate, nutmeg and some spices . . . a very rich and tantalizing aroma; really can't imagine anything better. Taste, I wish I could explain why I rated this a 5.0 but I can't other than to say it's amazingly delicious and complex. It's strong and you can taste the alcohol but it's balanced out nicely by some sweet maltness and a little bitterness in finish. One of my favorite beers out there."
"D - If this was a blind taste test, I would have never guessed these are 10.5%. Easily I could have more than one."
"This is a strong, boozy beer, so don't make the mistake I did and pour it too cold. The closer it got to room temperature, the better it tasted, finishing with a flavour that is closer to Westvleteren 12 than anything else I have tried (although better balanced, as it is considerably less sweet than the Westy). A great beer."
"Pours a hazy dark ruby red with a big, billowing tan head. Smells like rootbeer (I'm not kidding), with those dark fruits like figs and plums and a powerful sweetness riding on the ethers. If I could give its taste a ""10"" I would. It's one layer of dark fruitiness upon another, each one revealing something different as its rich body slowly expands into a fine bubbly mass that fills the mouth. If there is any better beer out there (like a Westy 12), it cannot possibly be better by much and probably is not a better value. For my money, this is the crème de la crème."
"decent, but don't know if i'd drink again given the price."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a huge 2+ fingers of dense moussy light tan head that recedes very slowly and leaves copious amounts of lacing. Aroma is quite good, lots of malt and some dark fruity esters. The malt presence has lots of Munich and is bready with some slight caramel. Moderate dark fruity esters include some raisins and figs. Alcohol aroma are low in intensity and quite soft. Flavor is quite similar to the aroma. Overall this beer is quite malty but still moderately dry. The alcohol provides a balance to the strong malt profile. Fruity esters are more prominent here than in the aroma and lean a bit more towards figs and maybe some dried cherries. Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, moderately high carbonation and some smooth alcohol warmth. Drinkability is pretty darn good, the high ABV is well masked, the flavors are complex and meld together quite well, and the beer is properly attenuated. This beer is deserving of its lofty reputation and is quite enjoyable."
"D- I am going to age a few bottles of this to see how it mellows out but its still great fresh."
"What else is there to say that so many others haven't? Outstanding example of the style, in fact, in my top 5 all time brews. Magnificent."
"D: Very high. I don't know if I'd get a bomber of this, because it would put me on my ass. But I'd love to have a few more singles, and I'll search around for them. This is undoubtedly one of the most complex and delicious brews I've ever had, and I will sing its praises. Outstanding."
"This is a great beer to sip on, very creamy and pleasant. My only complaint is that the ABV in this particular quadrupel is lower than rochefort 10, but the alcohol flavor is still more prevalent and not as well hidden. Still an excellent brew."
"Poured from draft in the proper ST Bernardus glass. A rich tan foam great pour perfect head. The smell was fantastic a sweet carmel smell nice dark color like a belgian dubble. The taste was very nice nice carbonation taste hazel nuts carmel hints of spices great mouth feel all around smooth after taste. A very good beer to enjoy. I have since had many of these but no more then 3 at a sitting with the ABV at 10.5% it can bite you. but highly recommend this wonderful beer."
"An amazing standby that I think gets overlooked a little do to mass production. at $4 a 16 oz. pour during happy hour I will be back for another glass."
"This is a flawless quad in my opinion. All the good stuff is there and its very drinkable for 10.5%."
"D: If you like dark fruits, this is absolutely the beer for you. Truth be told, though, the sweetness does become a bit cloying after a while. Not even close to a session beer, but a pretty damn good nightcap."
"Overall, St. Bernardus Abt 12 is one of the beers that got me into the position I am today with enjoying new and unique beers. The guy who first told me to buy a single 11oz of it in California (Sean from the Pizza Port Bottle Shop) probably has no clue the maelstrom he unleashed upon me when he recommended this beer, but this is the one that started it all for me. Despite all of that, it is still hands down my favorite beer in the world. I highly recommend this to anyone who has not tried it."
"Very complex brew, could see this aging for years and years. Sweetness for me is always too much. Though herb complexity, anis, winter warmer spice is lingering. Super long finish I figure is from the sweetness. Yes very complex. With years if the sugars come down I could see this being a perfect beer."
"D: delicious but not drinkable past one."
"D: There is no doubt that this beer is amazing and lives up to its place on the top 100 brews. It does have a heaviness to it and it does sit a bit heavy in the stomach though. I wouldn't go as far as saying I would stop here, but I would definitely stop at a 750 of this. The flavor, look, aroma and feel are all on point, but you still have to remember this is a big beer. With all that said, damned good and will drink again anytime I have the chance."
"Drinkability:This beer is, in my opinion, is a sipper. It is quite drinkable overall, but the alcohol in will get you."
"Pours a very nice brown with a cream-like colored head, with wonderful staying power. Large smell of malts, and a few other things I can't put my finger on. First taste on this was so good, I started wondering why I have not been drinking more quad. Just simply amazing. Soft on the mouth feel, and goes down nice and smooth. A touch of sweetness at the end makes this brew just that much better. Outstanding brew. Simply outstanding."
"I would have ranked the drinkability higher, if it didn't hide its alcohol so well."
"All and all I would say I like this better than Rochefort 10, I can't say if its better than the Westy 12 since I haven't had but I am sure it is probably right up there. What a steal at 1.99. Will buy again."
"Well, that sums it up. I love this beer but better in the bottle than on tap. My tastes. Good to the last drop. Will always be my favorite and as my tastes grow, I will be able to taste more in this."
"The taste was semi-sweet, semi-bitter, pine, sour dark fruit, caramel malt. The finish was long and distinctive, a bit tart with sour fruit and dry. The problem with evaluating a beer like this is that we're so seldom able to fidn them in these parts, it's hard to know what to compare it to. Having enjoyed the St. Bernardus 8 the other night, I have to confess that I enjoyed that much more than this. The mouthfeel here was, for lack of kinder words, somewhat lacquer-like and cleansing and that took away from a more impressive rating overall. Mind you, I'm well aware of the reputation of this brew and I'd love to try it again ... but if I said it knocked my socks off, I'd be stretching the truth quite a bit - good plus some, but not outstanding on this night, at least not for me."
"In my mind, there is no doubt this is the Armagnac of Belgium: its colour is striking, its bouquet intensely aromatic, its flavours endless and personally subjective, its disposition elegant, smooth, and refined and its story is one rooted in the geography, culture, and history of where it's made. I'm no expert on French brandies or spirits, but I know my beer, and there are few that I'd put ahead of this for meal pairings or after-dinner digestifs."
"Memorable Qualities: I prefer this in the bottle than on tap, where it seems to lose some of the intensity of the nose. I feel like I can always count on St. B to deliver the dark fruit alcoholic yeasty stew that makes me wish I lived in the Belgian countryside with monks stirring open wooden vats. I want to swim in this. Best quad/abt I've ever had. Perfect."
"Exceedingly drinkable...for the style. The 10% alcohol is there though."
"The wonderful balance of sweet, spice, and dryness combine to make this an incredibly easy-drinking beer that hides its strength well, which is sneaky and goes straight from the glass to the head, skipping the palate altogether, albeit with perhaps a slight warming on the way down. Certainly worth of world-class status."
"OUTSTANDING, AWESOME, OVERWHELMING, IRRESISTIBLE, BREATHTAKING, OUT OF THIS WORLD, MAGNIFICENT, SUPERB, GLORIUS, BRILLIANT, MARVELOUS, GRAND, SPLENDID, MOUTH-WATERING, AMAZING, REMARKABLE, WONDERFUL, ASTOUNDING, TREMENDOUS, AWE-INSPRING, ALLURING, GREAT, INCREDIBLE, FABULOUS, TERRIFIC, FANTASTIC, SENSATIONAL, SUPER, MONSTROUS, IMPRESSIVE, OUTRAGEOUS, DAZZLING, EXCEPTIONAL, BRAVURA. Did I leave any thing out maybe INCOMPARABLE? For the technical stuff see other reviews, I must recover from three bottles.By the way this is a top five beer in my book. Later."
"Overall - amazing, no comments, I could sip this one all day."
"Extremely hard to find the alcohol content anywhere in the flavor profile. Mellow on the swallow as well, don't feel the warming effect. So complex and interesting though that I enjoyed this slowly over the course of an hour. An exceptionally constructed Quadrupel that never ceases to amaze me."
"D - I wouldn't call this very drinkable, as the alcohol is very high and the chewyness somewhat gets in the way. Something I'd love to start off the night with, but not something I'd drink all night."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel: This is an amazing beer. Very light carbonation and a slick feel make this a must try for everyone."
"Creamy textures led to a dry dark fruitiness,dates,raisins,very astrigent,port-like has a sweet sticky booziness midway through the finish,not overpowering yet very present.Nice. Suprizingly drinkable leaves your mouth watering for more."
"dark brown pour with nice head. smells malty and sweet. this is a big brew, rich flavor. sorta caramelized sugar taste, this is a pretty sweet beer, but has just enough hops to save it from going overboard, definitely a cold weather drink, i could taste the alcohol a bit, but definitely didn't feel like 10%. overall I say this is for sure one of the best brew's i have tasted. and would treat this as a special occasion beer, as even if cheaper, dont think i could drink all the time."
"This might be the Belgian Quad that I use to rate others by."
"This is one smooth puppy. Poured a dark and murky brown with a tannish head that faded to thin layer. Smelled yeast, malt, and perhaps some brown sugar. Taste was very good with a predominant malt flavor but perfectly balanced. The beer had a great warming feel to it as the alcohol hit my stomach. Nice carbonation on this full bodied brew. Drinkability is high...I wish I had more than this 750 ml bottle. Excellent beer!"
"If Westy 12 is better, I'd like to see it."
"D - Entirely to drinkable. I could drink this daily if it were the only one I'd drink but it wouldn't be, so I shall not. Exceptional beer here."
"Poured the Abt 12 into a Chimay glass. It looked beautiful. It pours an opaque black-mahogany color with yeast visible at the bottom and all around the sides (and in the head). The head is large a dark tan and the lacing is great. It smells like Belgium Yeast largely. I can pick up a few fruits, mostly dark fruits with a hint of sour grapefruit. The taste is great, only held back by the alcohol coming on a bit too strong. The flavor is powerfull overall though, as a mix of dark fruits and malts with an interesting bitter & sour finish. Even while cold, this beer is still great, and it is hard for me to wait for the Abt 12 to warm. It's a nice beer to have a couple of, but the price and high ABV may prevent you from going all out on this beer. Highly Recommended."
"M/D - very easy to drink, but maybe a bit too sugary for me, but this is definitely one to try."
"D: Drinkable, but definitely a sipper. Just the mere gassiness and heaviness of this ale makes it hard to finish the bottle."
"Overall, this will always be one of my all-time favorites. It's one of the first beers from the craft world that I had, and it will be one that I will always come back to. Highly recommended!"
"D - a great quad. definitely worthy of its high Top beers on Planet Earth rating."
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall- A great beer that is easy to find and very enjoyable. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is into Belgians... and everyone else too."
"Overall: The feel was nothing out of the ordinary for the style but the drinkability was amazing for the alcohol content...It barely even came out. One of the most exceptional beers I've ever had...and I was lucky enough to get a 4-pack for only $4.99!!!"
"Drinkability- One might want to drink many of these, but one would be hard pressed to do so."
"Heavy body with mild carbonation. Such a rich beer that improves decidedly as it warms like most quads. So flavorful yet quite strong. Easy to drink but a careful sipper. One of my favorites."
"D - Awesome beer, went down easy - but I passed out in ½ hour!"
"One of the top five beers I've ever had, and every bit as good as Westy."
"To be able to pack this kind of punch in ABV and keep the drinkablility this high is a credit to the brewer's art. My hopes were high when I first poured the beer into the glass. The dark color complemented the creamy white head, and the sweet malt aroma kept me from being distracted by the alcohol. It was there, but not overwhelming. It was pleasantly thick and velvety on my tongue, and it soon had me smiling."
"This one pours a deep, chocolaty brown with a fluffy beige head. Sturdy aroma is malty and somewhat spicy - mainly cloves. Rich, malty flavor has a chocolaty undertone, as well as nutty and toffee hints. Texture is fairly smooth and jazzy, and malty finish is pleasing."
"About to drink the last sip on this sucker, hold on a sec...Wow. God damn good. Appearance is a beautiful spiced apple flavor. It looks like that crazy organic unrefined apple juice you buy at hippy stores, not that light colored Mott's crap. The taste and mouthfeel here are certainly the highlights. It tastes different depending on where you let it travel in your mouth - but definitely a deep malty, caramel/honey flavor that overwhelms everything in there. Enjoy this one like you would a good scotch."
"Another great beer from Brouwerij St.Bernardus. One of my favorite breweries."
"Pours a very lovely, hazy dark amber color with a one finger off-white head that fell slowly to a nice lasting cap and left very little lacing. Very yeasty aroma, dark fruit, raisins in particular, grainy, grassy, earthy. Taste is very complex, lots of great things going on here. Raisin flavor is predominant, followed by some grape flavor that was also present in the Prior 8, apples, light chocolate, a peppery spiciness in the middle, rum booziness, grassy hops, light bitterness, and a long dry yeasty finish. There is so much going on in this beer it's hard to determine all the flavors. Very complex to say the least. As with all the other St. Bernardus offerings, carbonation is aggressive at first but mellows considerably as it warms up a bit in the glass. As the carbonation subsides it becomes creamy and the flavors really start to develop. This is easily the best of the St Bernardus mixed 4 pack that I got for my birthday from a very awesome GM. Glad I got to try these beers. As far as the 6, 8, and 12 go, they get better as the number gets higher."
"Notes: One of the best quads I have ever had and sets the bar for readily available belgians. If you've never tried it, you're missing out big time"
"Drinkability: The price of this abbey far outweighs my ability to contiuously enjoy this beer. You would never know the ABV, very drinkable for such a high alcohol content. Proved to be a little gaseous for my liking."
"The story of this beer is the alcohol, which I find distracting. IMHO, the dilemma with Quads is that they are made extreme without placing stronger flavors in the brew (like darker malts or more hops). So, I find these to be a little too one-dimensional."
"On tap at the Yard House in Long Beach, CA. Served in a goblet glass. Aroma is faint of malt, with some sweetness and fruit. Color is a deep red amber with a big beige head that has some staying power. Flavor is full and rich. Cherry fruit dominates the malt. Full, rich and smooth. Extremely drinkable for the gravity. This is a fantastic beer. Complex, rich and decadent."
"d- this is just so dang delicious, I can't see ever not being in the mood for one. The flavors are strong and the alcohol is definitely present. Sip on this one for sure. I picked up the bottle based on the hype around it, and it was beyond what I was expecting. I'm declaring this, here and now, the best Belgian I've had to date."
"Pours dark amber, one finger of head and great lacing. Hints of raisin and berry. Wonderful sweetness and a refreshing finish. Mouthfeel is a little less full bodied than I was hoping for, but still not bad with an excellent amount of fine-bubbled carbonation."
"Deep opache brown color with a tannish head and a good deal of lacing. The aroma is very diverse of plum, raison, fig, brandy soaked oak, spice and just a hint of dough. Flavor matches the aroma with a welcome adition of fig and tart cherry. Decent carbonation, very thick and chewy mouthfeel. Long fruity finish. Had this one in the cellar for a long time and it was well worth the wait!"
"This brew is nice and complex, yet super smooth and easy to drink. Though the hops presence is not very big, there is alot of balance in this one. Just be sure to watch out for that 10%ABV, though."
"Poured a murky dark brown color with a nice off-white head that hung around a little while. Aroma is of dark fruit, and malty sweetness. Flavor is fruity and sweet with a taste of brown sugar. Alcohol is not real evident in taste, but is warming. I don't know what I was expecting, but this did not live up to the hype. I will admit that Quad's are not my favorite style. Okay but honestly I have had much better."
"I was expecting it to taste better to me, but I don't know what I wanted. This was my first quad. I want to give it a higher rating, because I wanted to love this beer to fit in, but being true to my taste buds, I'll say I wasn't blown away. I think I need to develop a taste for the style, and then I'll review it again."
"Great beer, one of the best iv had."
"Pours a dark brown with a thick brown head. No clarity with sediment seen suspended in the brew. Good head retention into a nice collar and excellent laciness. Aroma is fruity with some malt and belgain sugars. Excellent taste, very complex with fruit and spice. Balance is superb. Smooth but heavy texture. An excellent session beer, but more than a couple requires caution as this does pack a punch."
"D - This is very enjoyable and I look forward to having may more in the future."
"This is a highly drinkable beer, so long as you pace yourself."
"Drinkability - No hop-heads here. In my opinion, this is one of the best beers around for those who prefer a deep, rich malt flavored beer. A good sipper and a good reason to explore Belgians."
"A quintessential Belgian abbey ale, and a personal favorite."
"My expectations where met."
"D. Such an easy beer to drink at 10.5%. I love it!"
"I really like this Quad, it's almost up there with Westy and Rochefort, but not quite as good. If you get one St. Bernardus beer this should be it (or the tripel!)."
"D= pretty high. The thin body and high alcohol makes this one dangerous"
"Even though this beer has such a high abv, I can (and have) sessioned this beer. The only drawback is the price, but aside from that, this is an all day beer. I love it."
"The beer was very smooth and went down easily."
"Overall: Very easy to drink, probably wouldn't have more than one though. Seems like a good brew for a cold night."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a tannish persistant head. Aroma is excellent and complex- notes chocolate, caramel, apples, cinnamon with a light sweetness. Taste is rich with similar notes as in in the nose. Chocolate and caramel notes balance with fruit and spiciness. Not too sweet, extemely balanced actually, not only between sweetness and bitterness but also between all the many flavors present. There's plenty going on here but no one flavor really stands out- everything works perfectly together to make this one of the best tasting beers I've had. Mouthfeel is velvety and smooth with a slightly dry finish. Easily the most drinkable beer I've had in this abv range. Just about perfect."
"Notes: Extremely flavorful, great complexity, and a nice alcohol punch to make you notice it. This is one that every serious beer drinker should have at least once. I am very skeptical that the Westy 12 can be THAT much better than this. I can't wait to find out! Highly recommended"
"Nikki"
"D-Very drinkable and enjoyable, but not something I want more than one of at one sitting."
"Wow, is all I can say. This beer is ridiculously good, if it were a woman I would marry it. Best Quad hands down in my opinion. I have had the other celebrated trappist and trappist style quads but this is the king. The taste is complex and silky and incredibly drinkable for the high alcohol content. A magnificent quad."
"Pours a dark brown with auburn hues. It is merky with a nice white head. It smells of fruits and a hint of chocolate. I can only describe the first sip as breathtaking. It tastes much like the nose, dark fruits and a hint of milk chocolate, but also with some spice. Once you swallow your mouth is thirsting for more, but you cannot rush this, it must be savored. You feel a slight warmth of alcohol as it goes down and you can taste just a hint of it. This beer is nothing short of amazing. It is highly drinkable, but it seems so delicate and so complex that it should not be drank often. It should only be consumed in small quantaties on special occasions."
"The alocohol is pretty much non-descript and it is insanely smooth. It honestly is like drinking Rochefet 10... times 10. Just an amazing beer with everything working so well and balanced so well."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a dark chestnut brown with a three finger fluffy white head and beautiful lacing. Nose- sweet dark fruits (raisins, plums), spice, caramel. Taste- rich breads, molassed, nuts, soft spice. Wonderful body and depth witha creamy velvet smoothness to it. No alcohol heat at all and carbonation level is perfect."
"MF&D - Well balanced and delicious. Creamy and very drinkable for 10.5% ABV. A classic."
"I could not be happier with this beer. The flavor and aroma are sweet and balanced, fruity in some respects but mildly so. What gets me is the mouthfeel. Served chilled, this is like drinking a delicate champagne. An extremely well executed brew from a brewery that does not make a bad beer."
"Have had this beer a number of times, but broke out a bottle out of a St Bernardus mixed six pack I got for Christmas. Poured out of the 11 ooz bottle into a chalice. Pours a murky brownish red. Tons of sediment. Had a tough time leaving it in the bottle. Smells of sweet malts, some dark fruit. Taste is similar- some raisin, very sweet. Slick mouthfeel. Very drinkable as it hides the high abv very well. A classic beer- not as complex as a westy 12, and not as tasty as a Rochefort 10, but very good."
"Feel is exquisite, with a carbonation that matches the flavor pretty precisely. This beer is strong and sweet, yet doesn't really come across to be either. A remarkable feat."
"This is an extremely drinkable beer and a nice example of the style as some others have become overcome with strength as opposed to balance."
"Very tasty for a quad, definitely a sipper but it's been difficult to keep the glass down. I've had this beer in a 750, and on tap, but this is the first time I've had it from a regular bottle. This is also the first time I've been able to truly sit down and thoroughly enjoy this beer. Would love to compare this to Rochefort, because I usually always think the Rochefort is better, but I'm not so sure now. Both are truly world class, complex ales that should be sipped and enjoyed."
"Overall this is the beer I always recommend to people delving into Belgians for the first time, and so far I've never heard of anyone not happy with the suggestion."
"D- The high aloholic content is well balanced and covered by malt aspects and yeast flavors"
"Awesome Quad abbey ale! This is a beer that can be appreciated by both beeradvocates and newbies."
"9/5/9/5/18 (4.6/5)"
"(rated Sep 23, 2008)"
"D: An excellent beer with tons to offer including dense dark fruit, brown sugar, and spiced flavors, a nimble feel, and earthy character."
"D: Definitely smooth, could have a few but wouldn't break the bank on it... I'm glad we just got in on tap though. I think maybe one other bar in this city has it... Louisville that is..."
"Notes: It's a very good quad. Period."
"I also found this out while drinking this beer. St. Bernardus 12 is supposedly the secular knock-off of the famous Westvleteren 12."
"An Aside: 'tho I read on this page that this beer is a Quad, the bottle notes that it is ""Brewed in the style of a Belgian dubbel""."
"Poured from an older bottle that I've been saving in my fridge for a year or so. Pours a murky, prune juice brown with bits of sediment floating throughout and a brown head. The smell was of dark fruits and strong notes of brown sugar/molasses. The taste was similar, with a nice mouthfeel. I was expecting more of an alcohol presence, but it was really rounded and smooth. Drinkability was good: I finished the entire 750 mL without any hesitation."
"A beer I've saved for a while, and it was well worth it! Worth a try for anyone that even remotely likes Belgian ales! Don't drink this one cold, the flavors come out a warmer temperature."
"Drinkability - Every flavor I have encountered is pleasant, and there is only a slight hint that this is 10.5% Overall very solid, but not spectacular."
"D - Wasn't too enthused by this one when I saw it was St. Bernardus as I didn't care for their trippel. This one was fantastic. It deserves to be in the top 50."
"Pours a brownish red, like old red wine... light head that gives way to lacing. Initial taste was overcarbonated, so I let it warm a bit in the goblet. Much better when tasted at cellar temp... aroma is boozy and fruity. Flavors are dried fruits and alcohol. After the beer warmed a bit, the mouthfeel was much better, and the flavors and aromas popped out a bit more. Minimal yeasty flavors, with some earthy notes on the end. Sweetness is about spot on for a dubble/quad."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a deep mahogany with garnett high lights. The head is aboout 2 fingers, white and fluffy. On the nose it is all about dried fruit-dates and figs. There is a slight phenolic scent in there as well. The flavor of this beer is excellent. It has many layers-dried fruit is the main one. Very balanced there are also hints of alcohol and spices. The beer is full bodied and feels creamy in my mouth. The beer is a definite sipper, if you don't the 11% abv will catch you quite fast."
"It's pretty drinkable. I could have one more."
"Pours dark, deep red with a fizzy, active head. Smells like dark fruit. Tastes of plums, grapes, other dark fruits. Fizzy, malty mouthfeel with a biting alcoholic finish, below average to on my palate. Flavor gets better as it warms and it becomes easier to drink as you get used to the bite. Very complex beer."
"750 mL bottle with a dark walnut cloudy pour with a nice thick tan head. Aroma of caramel, apples and sugar. Taste of apples, Belgian yeast, spices and caramel malt and very little alcohol despite its almost 11% ABV. Nice lacing, and a great full finish."
"Drinkability: One of the best sipping quadruples around."
"Highly recommended, get a case and drink some and save some...worth every penny of the $$$$"
"Definitely highly recommended. It's a beautiful looking brew and the creaminess is simply fantastic."
"Overall a very delicious quad - certainly one of my favorites in the style."
"A very drinkable beer considering the style and abv."
"Pours a huge off-white head, with good lacing. Has a body that is brown-reddish in color. A sweet hoppy aroma, some perfume, and coffee? A light taste, hops, perfume, raisin, coffee, bitter aftertaste."
"Pours a dark brown color with a nice sized off-white foam head. Hints of chocolate, dark fruit and alcohol in the aroma. Hints of raisin, spices, dark chocolate and alcohol warmth. Surprisingly fruity for a beer this dark. Very well balanced and extremely quaffable."
"D_Pleasing but not overwhelming flavors and aromas make this beer unoffensive and easy to enjoy, but the 10,5ABV might be a bit prohibitive. I can definitely feel the alcohol's kick but the beer is nonetheless overall easy to down"
"Overall impression: This is a very nice sipping beer. I had trouble identifying the aroma and taste that seemed most prevalent, but after reading some reviews that mention cloves, I broke out a bottle of cloves from our spice cabinet and sure enough, that's what it is. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy other quads more."
"D: Very drinkable for it's strength; this is a good beer. Is it top 25 for me? No, but it's a brew I'd drink any time."
"Overall this is a beer that is quite smooth and has an interesting taste derived from the yeasts used. I'm unsure if I'd drink another."
"Eventually poured a murky brown with mahogany highlights and a substantial tan coloured head. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and dark fruits. There was also some hints of nuts and woodiness. The palate was excellently balanced and smooth, despite drinking at room temp. Chocolate and coffee notes were most prevalent. The mid palate brought some sweetness with honey, caramel and dark fruits. The finish displays some earthy hop spice and yeasty dryness. The rather high ABV never crossed my mind, impeccable balance!"
"Very nice beer, very smooth and easy-sipping quad, the best from St Bernardus, but not the 4th best beer of Belgium."
"This just keeps getting better as it warms with more character coming through leaving you craving another sip."
"This sample reminded me of how I recalled it in my fonder memories, where it is one of the world's greats. Not all samples have left me feeling that way, and this satisfied. Not sure if it is me, or the beer, that causes this dissonance. It happens with other beers as well."
"5/4/4.5/4.75/4.5"
"Poured an 11.2oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a raisin brown with a 2 inch head that leaves just minimal lacing. The aroma is dark fruit with prunes, raisins, and brown sugar. The flavor follows suits with raisin and dates in the forefront with brown sugar, barley, and just a bit of cherry. Also there is just a hint of spiciness to it, probably from the Belgian yeast strains. The 10.5% alcohol really comes through, especially as it warms. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a nice boozy sensation on the palate. The colder this beer is, the less drinkable it is. As it warms, it really shows its true colors. It becomes a very drinkable quad, but it's still a bit on the boozy side for me."
"Drinkability: This beer is unbelievable. I can't get enough."
"Drinkability: You can't even taste the alcohol here. I haven't done a parallel tasting of quads, but this might be my favorite of one of my favorite styles."
"D: This has to rank w/ WV 12 for me. I am astounded by the balance of this beer, but moreover how the balance helps me to enjoy the distinctive flavors more, as none are overwhelming. I will definitely pick this up to have around in the future."
"This is one of the classic Quads and closesly related to Westy, at least historically speaking, as St. Bernardus used to brew the Westvleteren 12 before 1992."
"HV"
"Good beer, no doubt, but I would have to disagree that it stands out as anything incredibly unique. It is the perfect example of its style and is worth drinking, but maybe not worth the hefty cost more than a few times."
"Foggy brown pour, cream head. Malt, raisin, fig, molasses aromas. A little sticky, would prefer more however. Nice that it is not overly carbonated. Tastes solid malts and molasses, similar to the nose. I would consider this rather drinkable for a strong Belgian. Good, but definetely prefer the Rochefort 10. Though I don't prefer many Belgians at all because too many end up being a ""white"" style Belgian, even when called otherwise."
"D - Smooth, the 10.5% ABV is well hidden."
"10% abv is hardly noticable. Truly a great beer of the world."
"Some prefer to have Abt 12 after a meal or with a cigar but I think with such a developed and complex flavor profile and carbonation this would also be perfect for those hearty and savory dishes we have come to love this holiday season."
"Tasted best before 2005 on 4/2/2006. This aroma was awesome. Plums and raisins with breadiness. Tastes of the same. This was by far one of the best aged, if not best, beers in a long time. Increased #s."
"This is definitely a good beer, it is a solid belgian ale. Complex yeasty, malty nose with a big mouthfeel and a geared finish...yadayada. and if it was done in America i might rate it better. Honestly though, for the style, I feel like westvleteren and rochefort do it so much better that i can't say this beer is fantastic - bottom line in my opinion, is it's worth trying and drinking but don't run out and pay 8 bucks for a bottle of it at your local beer shop if you can get rochefort or even westmalle instead."
"A good beer, but not something I would go out of my way to drink. Not worth the hype in my opinon."
"This is a very good beer, but I'm a victim of expectations because I'm a touch disappointed. It's not the absolute homerun I expected, but still a very tasty brew that I would certainly have again."
"This poured a murky dark brown with chunky sediment and tons of tan head. It smelled like lots of earthy caramel malt and sweet yeast, with grassy hops and milk chocolate malt. It tasted like earthy caramel and milk chocolate malts, with sweet yeast, citrus hops and mulled spice. It was fairly thick with some carbonation (although surprisingly little considering how much head was on the pour), and a bittersweet aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was absolutely fantastic. It had great, complex, subtle, and generally delicious flavor. It had an extremely smooth body and hid the alcohol fairly well, making this quite easy to drink and enjoy. I love this beer, and just want more, and can't wait to try some aged for a decade or so."
"D: one of these is enough for anyone, lots of booze, lots of beer. this is a balanced well crafted beer, but its not a session beer at all. this is a monster of a beer, and it is delicious, but, in small doses."
"The carbonation is something that caught me a little when it comes to feel. The flavors blend nicely but the carbonation is a little more than I'm used to. However, it is also what makes this flavor blend so well and makes the drinkability high. I will definitely drink this beer again."
"Also, I drank mine in just under twenty minutes. Maybe I'm a lightweight but I felt tipsy and had a little bit of headache after. Note to self: remember to sip the deliciousness next time."
"A definite sipper at 10% but it drinks like a 7%. One of the best examples of the style."
"D: Notwithstanding the ABV, this can easily be consumed in large quantities. An awesome quad that will cause me to re-evaluate how good I think other quads are in the future."
"It's spicy and bready and incredible. There's a lot of aroma, sweet caramel and spiced nuts. The flavors adds in raisins and smoke. There's a lot of carbonation sizzling the flavors throughout the mouth. I could drink this beer for a long period of time, like a fortnight or so."
"A pretty good quad, some say it's better than Westvleteren 12, the so called Holy Grail of beers. Complex flavors, including fruit with a little bit of spice, along with a smooth creaminess. Recommended."
"One hell of a beer. Easily ranks in my top 5 Belgians."
"D: This is a legit quad. Has everything that a beer on this level should have and you would ask for. A sipper to sit back and enjoy, on par with the best of em."
"Beer is smooth which supprised me a bit because if its high alchohol content. It started with a fruity note, which lingered and I detected subtle clove flavors giving way to a nice malty flavor. It finished with a slight alchohol warmth and sharpness in the finish."
"Deep copper amber with a nice creamy head that falls very slowly to a ring. It leaves some lacing down the glass. Great, seductive smell. Grape and bubble gum, candy sugar. Nice bready yeast, lightly toasted scents. Good spice. Taste is also great. Again, some bubble gum and still grape, not as present as the smell. Nice spicy flavors with clove seeming apparent. Mouthfeel is very nice. Creamy, silky, almost perfect aside from a little much of a tingle on the tongue at times. Only a hint of heat at times. Very drinkable beer. In the top ranks for style, with ease."
"D- Goes down smooth and easy."
"This is the best St. Bernardus offering I've had yet... phenomenal."
"D - Simply best beer I've had. Makes me want more at end of glass which is what any good beer should leave one yearning for."
"You can not go wrong with this beer !!!"
"D--> Among my top 10 ales for having with a book!....a very drinkable and delightfully-balanced beer altogether."
"D= An excellent sipper or nightcap beer. I am impressed by all of the St. Bernardus ales and find this one to be one of their best."
"Wiseman Jorge: B+ (3.85)"
"Notes: A pleasure to have and taste so much better once it warms to near room temperature.I enjoyed this very much and I look forward to having more."
"An exceptional beer. Amazingly complex and flavor-packed. One of the best I've had."
"D- Funny, as much as I appreciate what a great beer this is, I'm in no hurry to try it again."
"A wonderful Belgian Quad. A wonderful beer judged on any criteria. A must try & a classic."
"Drinkability & Notes: I'd have no problem sipping this all night long. Probably my 2nd favorite quad to Roc. 10"
"D- Delicious and easygoing. I could have several of these, but the high ABV leaves me content after one."
"The more I drink this, the better it gets. A really great beer."
"D - Good beer."
"Poured from an overcarbonated bottle with a big, thick, creamy, textured head that lasts and lasts. Very malty, estery, fragrant, and volatile nose. Mouth filling body with just the right amount of carbonation. Not too sweet with a very complex taste. Goes down satisfyingly. Finish is medium. Lots of lace on the glass. Dark brown, copper color. Not as complex as the SE, but stands as a classic on its own."
"The alcohol is well hidden although the price is a practical factor in drinkability."
"D: I am still very new to this genre of beer but to say the least I was impressed. You would hope your last MRE in late 2012 would taste this good. For now, throw on your favorite music and enjoy. This could easily become one of my favorite beers."
"Not my absolutely favorite from the genre, but it's really good. Since the style is a little loosely defined - this of this as a really strong dubbel with many of the same flavors."
"This beer looses a bit in drinkability - not because you don't want to drink six of these, but because 1) It has 10% ABV and 2)It's around 9 bucks per 11.2 ounce bottle (but oh so worth it). I think I will pick up around 20 of these next trip to Florida."
"A dangerously drinkable beer, given the high ABV. I had two of them and it was very delicious. Just make sure you space them out over the course of an evening!"
"On tap at the Yard-House in Irvine, california. Pours dark brown, deep reddish amber with small white head. Slight aroma of hops with powerful sense of spice and alcohol. Flavor of spice, pepper and sweet plums. Finishes with a slight ting of alcohol. Very enjoyable!"
"The beer poured a cloudy copper-brown with very little head into a chalice. I detected a slightly sweet/candy/bubble gum aroma - definitely a Belgian brew. The sweet component also dominated over the malt in the initial swig, with licorice, fennel, Belgian candy sugar, and, of course, big-time alcoholic esters. A very complex and hefty brew - I enjoyed it immensely."
"Poured on tap at Stardust in Orlando. Impressed by its opaque clouded brown appearance. Only light that clearly gets through is at the edges where it shines rusty red. The smell is the best part. Roasted malts, yeast, chocolate, dark fruits. The taste wore a little on me. Too burnt. The taste also included some rum-like alcohol, dark fruit, and yeast, but the burnt malts were overwhelming. Mouthfell was medium/full bodied. Nice balance of carbonation and thickness. Drinkability suffers from excessive burnt flavors. I really expected more balance from such a lauded belgian. High alcohol really hit home, too. Not sure I'll try this one again, at least not at the price they ask!"
"Na Zdravje"
"On tap at the Public House in Brookline, MA. Wow. The Bernardus 12 is the standard by which all others are judged. Pours a big dark brown, white foam, and then the aroma hits you. Caramel, roasted malt, then burnt sugar. These are all present in undercurrents of the taste, as well as some molasses, dates, and currants. With a 10.5%ABV, the Bernardus 12 provides an SUV-size vehicle to carry all the flavors. The big ABV still doesn't have any of the burn."
"330ml bottle. Pours a nice deep brown color with a large frothy, light brown head which sticks around for a good while. Aroma is roasted malt, maybe a little bit of coffee/chocolate, and some fruits (pear?). Flavor is better than the smell fruity and sweet. It packs a decent punch, the finish reminds you that it's a relatively high alcohol content."
"The main difference between this beer on-tap and out of the bottle is an even creamier mouthfeel, which gives way to enhanced drinkability. Additionally, much more lace is present and the head retains at a 1/2 inch from start to finish. Flavor is slightly more vibrant on-tap, as well."
"D - The high abv takes a way a tad from the drink, but it's still a damn tasty belgian."
"D- Easy to drink, goes down smooth. By the time I got to the bottom of the magnum, the ABV was showing its punch."
"Drinkability: Very well-hidden alcohol, but it's up there, and you can feel it after a while. Plus, the grape fanta soda thing starts to freak you out after a while. All that being said, the sheer scatterbrain-like quality of my above review should indicate that this is a really complex and tasty beer, and comes highly recommended."
"P.S. much stronger tasting out of the bottle then on tap. (if my memory serves me right)"
"Pours a brownish body, slightly hazy and full of carbonation. A huge foamy head that leaves a lot of lacing. At first the beer tastes a bit winey and tart, with an alcohol rush and some malts and dark fruits mixed in. But it really does balance out quite well to make a very good beer. For a beer with this much alcohol in it (10%) I found it to be quite smooth and easy to drink. Also, slightly sweet but doesn't over do it and the finish is clean and relaxing."
"D: Good for a beer of this ABV and style...Looking forward to the other St. Bernardus' I have left"
"It poured a beautiful dark brown with a fine tan head. The aroma was of sweet malt and berries. The taste was surprisingly moderate, but wonderfully put together. It was simply berries, malt, and a pleasant alcohol burn. The feel was light and dry. This was a great beer to experience and I look forward to finding it on tap again in the future."
"Drinkability: Paired very well with some Pinback mp3's (particularly ""Tripoli"" and ""Seville""). Full of flavor, rich complexities, and yet it's easily accessible and generally readily available from coast to coast. What's not the like? Although, I will say, I dug that 'Special Edition' a bit more. That's just me, though!"
"D.I could finish a corked bottle, but would be happy with a 12oz serving."
"poured a very deep brown huge with a decent amount of carbonation. it looks beautiful, just a magnificent looking brew. smell is very diverse, has lots of apple and grape aromas, smells very sugary, a deeper breathe reveals hints of roasted malts. on the tongue it tingles, the carbonation wakes my tongue up the taste is just amazing, a textbook quad with an exquisite taste, the alcohol warmness goes all over, while the flavors dance on the tongue. mouthfeel is wonderful and thick, just an awesome beer. another one of those great beers that i some how have yet to try until now"
"Overall: Very glad I tried it, but as an IPA lover, I probably won't stock up on this."
"The very high ABV (10.5%) doesn't interfere with a truly magnificent Quad, perhaps the best I've ever had and certainly one of the best beers in any style I've tried. Well worth the coin, and one worth cellaring. A masterpiece."
"Must admit, on the first sniff and taste it seemed very very 1 dimensional - hard yeast on the nose, alcohol on the finish. As it warmed/aired it grew and grew, filling out the palate with creamy sweetness and a very complex nose to boot."
"This is the best quadrupel i've tasted, by far."
"Drinkability: Be careful with this one! It's soothing taste and attractive appearance has been known to tempt one too many beer-geek into a quick intoxication. This is a quality beer, and should be enjoyed as such. It's a social beer, but one could easily spend an evening drinking nothing but the Abt. 12, and enjoying every last drop!"
"D- Very drinkable, but be careful, 10% is no mother's son."
"An exceptional beer that I will be enjoying again and again! Next time, it will be a side-by-side with a Westveleteren 12, Rochefort 10, and Pannepot."
"T/M/D - heavenly, very smooth, slightly sweet and somewhat heavy. The fruit taste is there but hangs out in the bacjground and lets your taste buds look for it a bit. This beer pulls together extremely well. One of my all-time favorites!"
"Overall a great brew! Taste is very similar to Westy, wonder why that is :)"
"Mouthfeel is near perfect, thick and coating but with the carbonated ""lift"" i like, vaporizing the liquid rolling down the tongue. There's something to the Belgian water. I can't think of a single American quad that nails the mouthfeel. Obviously not going to session this, but there's nothing off to the brew, very drinkable for the style. This is still definitely up there - may need to side by side it with the Pannepots."
"This one is an original color for sure, the best way I can describe it is as a dark ruby red thats really brown. It is super carbinated with a large creamy tan head that holds well and left decent lacing. While it certainly has the look of something special the nose is even better. I get a wide range of carmel/sweet malts as well as earthy yeast, plumb, slight raisin, slight alcohol and grassy/floral hops, wonderfully complex. The taste is again just out of this world just so much going on and yet at the same time its majically refreshing. Plum, raisins, sweet carmel malts, spice, candied fruit sugars, nuts and alcohol all make a home on your palet. I can't remember a beer with more carbination than this one and yet it seems to fit it well, providing a nice airyness to the overall medium feel without making it seem thin. My one serious gripe is that I only picked up one bottle of this, because I simply need to have more I wonder if the abbey is accepting new recruits. LOL. On my relatively short beer journey this has been the best stop."
"Pour a dark ruby brown in color with a nice two inches of head. Smell is belgian candy sugars, some plum and some light yeast. Taste is more of the plums and dark fruits. Incredibly creamy and big on the mouthfeel. A hint of spice in the taste at the end of each sip. Very good beer. Luxurious in the mouthfeel. Great beer, but not as complex as the Rochefort 10, which is still my fav."
"This was a beer that totally caught me by surprise. I had never heard of it, but I always try those I've never had when they are available. It poured thin, but with lots of head retention. Pour slowly unless you want a glass full of foam. Semi-dark, with a sweet, apple cider aroma. The flavor begins with the dryness of an aged cabernet, then explodes with notes of alcohol, overripe figs and balanced with a mandarian orange acidity and sweetness. This is one of the best beers of the year for me. Strong but refreshing. A definite sipper. I prefer a Hommel glass for this beer to enjoy the aroma with the flavor."
"drinkability - i can't imagine this beer ever getting old. another... please!!!"
"Congrats Michael Phelps (400 IM). You rock."
"Very easy to drink. This was one of the first Belgian beers I ever tried years ago, and is still one of my favorites today."
"D - I would have no clue this was 10% ABV. Very smooth and very drinakble."
"D: Easy to drink one, but it is rich."
"Poured into a goblet, it has a dark brown, very earthy color to it, it was very hazy and covered with an off white head that was bubbly and was about two fingers thick and quickly faded into thin layer of bubbles. It has some vey active carbonation and some good lacing; it gives off a mixture of citrus and flowers, some spices and a faint aroma of roasted malts. Its got a crisp feel and flavor up front, faint bitterness and some good spiciness to it. The alcohol is evident but not overwhelming, and is certainly present in its aftertaste, which leaves your mouth warm and is semi-dry."
"D- Easy to drink, goes down smooth."
"I haven't had a quad in a while and this didn't disappoint."
"D-Absolutely delicious. Personally would only rate just a smidge behind the Chimay blue as far as trappists go. Could defiantly see popping the cork on this every Friday night."
"Got this one on tap FINALLY...needed to check it out in some of its different formulations. Appearance is excellent, a deep dark brown color with a huge frothy head on top. Solid lacing as the beer drains. Nose is amazing: huge cookies, chocolate, dried fruit all over the place. Absolutely delicious, and incredibly inviting. Flavor is similar. A little smoother and subtler than the nose would suggest, with a strong alcohol presence in there as well. A little unexpected (although maybe it shouldn't be, given the ABV), as I don't remember this in the bottle form. Again, tons of cookies, roasted chocolate malt, and a ton of raisins, prunes, etc. floating around. Body is huge and creamy, perfect for the flavor and aromas. Overall, a delicious beer, and still one of my favorites, although I actually prefer the bottle because of the subtler alcohol presence."
"wow, 1073 reviews as of this writing. funny as it it is I had the 60th anniversary before I had this one. I decided to go for it and picked up one of these yesterday. very very tasty and I liked it without all the hops of the 60th better. A solid pick indeed!"
"Pours a dark brown with a light tan head. Big aromas of dark fruits, brown sugar, and spices like clove and cinnamon. Almost chewy heaviness in the mouthfeel. Not as dry of mouth feel as the ABV would have you believe. Good balance of sweetness and bitterness. Artisan bread in a bottle."
"Pours a brown, almost muddy red colour with a small amount of head. Plenty of lace coating the chalice. Big, bold smell. Lots of yeast, bread, malts, nuts, plums, cherries and brown sugar. Taste contains plenty of dark malts, dark fruits, raw brown sugar and some nuts. Even has a slight, coffee flavour as well. Very creamy, highly carbonated mouthfeel. A near perfect beer."
"D: This is the beer that got me started on craft beers and so I'm always going to have a couple of these on hand. One of my absolute favorites."
"D - Very drinkable."
"d: Damn, I could drink that all day every day. Lives up to its rep. An outstanding brew."
"This Belgian brew poured a very dark brown caramel color, with a nice milky head that lingers on top. My nose at time of tasting was a bit stuffy but I did distinguish some earthy tones there. My tongue was not stuffy though and wow am I glad for that. The taste was exceptional. There was caramel, fig, dark malts, with some slight alcohol in the background. Medium body, with carbonation up front with an oh so so smooth finish. Absolutely loved it. Instantly one of my favorites."
"I have had this beer fresh and with some age on it. The older the better. If you like this one.. Pick up a bunch.. and lay them down. I say at one year, they really start to shine. But now that I have over a case in the cellar.. I should be able to make it past 2 years."
"Pours a dark, cloudy brown, with a big, rocky, off-white head. Smells strongly of alcohol and super ripe bananas. Taste is strongly malt based, oak like flavors, as well as a hint of cider. Just a hint of bitterness and flavor from the hops. Highly carbonated. The yeast flavors imparted by this beer are more neutral than I would have expected for a Belgian Ale, but this does not affect authenticity. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are high due to bottle conditioning. Drinkability is great, very smooth beer, that while smells greatly of alcohol, hides its 10.5% ABV quite well. Quite an expensive beer, but is a great treat every now and then."
"Pours a medium brown cloudy color, with lots of light brown fluffy foam. Smells and tastes of figs, dried fruit, cinnamon, pear, grape, and some other fruits I can't place, but there's lots of them in there. A great blend of aroma and flavor. Nothing overpowers, and the flavors are intriguing enough that I keep drinking more. A helluva beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors make for easy consumption, alcohol may limit this beer slightly."
"D: It's a sipping brew, no doubt. Its ridiculous balancing act of flavor and texture make it unmistakably one of the best beers I've ever had."
"A small glass is appropriate for this big beer, which is sippable but fairly heavy."
"Drinkability was very top notch. For a bomber, this still will do you in quickly and in a pleasant, happy way. Definitely go grab a bomber of this, your tastebuds will be happy!"
"Highly enjoyable; an excellent treat to end the day with."
"D: Quite easy to drink beyond the ABV and gets even better with time. I shall keep this in mind for benchmark purposes."
"Poured into a goblet it has a solid tanned brown color with a tall frothy tan head that doesn't go down fast and sticks to the glass. Has a pungent smell of licorice, dark fruits such as raisins, and alcohol... the licorice and alcohol combine to have an almost menthol like effect on the nasal passages. Tastes suprisingly subtle yet just as complex when compared to the intense smell. Spice and hops back the malt, dark fruits, and licorice for a balanced flavor and mouthfeel; yet finishes with a silky vanilla taste and feel. Alcohol is not overly present by any means. This is very drinkable and restored my faith in belgian and belgian-style beers, as I was sort of being let down recently. Great beer."
"Overall: I poured out the bottle I had when it was fresh. I just found it too sharp and annoyingly alcoholic. But I find this to be a great improvement. A year of aging really helps this so I'm thinking it only gets better with age."
"A beast of a beer, strong with great depth and balance."
"D- Ok, but alcohol killed it."
"Originally set up by the monks from the fabled Westvleteren, St. Bernardus does not disappoint in the least. The Abt 12 follows the same basic recipe as the Westy 12 (with different water and yeast of course), and results in a similar complex mixture of raisins, other fruits, nuts and spices. Almost as good as Westvleteren at a fraction of the price and inconvenience, its biggest problem is that its just good enough to make you really long and wish for the good stuff. If at all possible sample it on tap, which is a head and shoulders above the bottled brew."
"D: My favorite nightcap. At 10%, it does the job perfectly. Not a session beer, by any means."
"Had this one at a tasting at my ABC store in Gainesville. This was a mighty quad with a nice complex nature. Poured a hefty cabernet color with a head from here to next Tuesday. Initial aroma was candied raisins, honey roasted nuts, spices. Taste was thick and chewy with dark fruits, dried apricot, and almost an earthiness like a good bordeaux,and yes I am comparing this beer to a fine wine because it might as well be."
"The mouthfeel is medium-heavy, really not as heavy as I was expecting. Overall, this is a complex and delicious beer that makes me love Belgian beer even more...if that's possible."
"Highly drinkable. I was craving a rich, Belgian style beer, and this hit the spot."
"D--A tasty, well-balanced, but eminently drinkable beer; while not overpowering in taste or aroma, it is remarkably good."
"date code 09 10 12, pours a deep mahogany-brown w/ a thick light-tan head which sticks around for a bit leaving a creamy lacing all the way down my snifter, con- the nasty looking chunks floating in my brew despite the careful pour ; a sour smell loaded w/ malt, kinda smells like a malt liqour meets a paisano w/ a caramel dropped in, quite pleasing actually ; can i just use yum to describe this one, a rich, fruity, malty flavor, pils malts, sweet caramels, dark figs, some hops in there as well, freekin awesome ; a dry, full mouthfeel, yet more like a creamy feeling rather than a thick, cloying one, a good amount of co2 prob. helps that ; outstanding drinkability, if you were to tell me it was a 10.5 ABV brew i'd say you were full of s#*t, wow, i think i found my new fav. quad..."
"General Impression: A strong and interesting beer"
"Ok this is way better than the Rochefort 10 in my humble opinion. An excellent Quad."
"The smiley, happy monk is a fortune teller... you will feel like him after your first sip!"
"stmd"
"Drinkability- First one was ok, didn't enjoy the second as much. Alcohol somewhat overbearing."
"Well rounded Quadrupel. Would definitely drink again. I think it's better on tap than from bottle...I remember it as less bubbly."
"Pours out a rich mahogony/ brown color with a very impressive, thick, tan head. The head leaves a lot of lace and keeps a nice layer over the brew. Right away an aroma of fruit and candied sugar fills my nose. With closer scrutiny, beautiful malty scents are easily noticeable, along with a nice biscuit quality. The taste follows the smell; fruity (strongly of cherries and bananas), malty, and earthy...very earthy. The brew has just a touch of hops towards the end. The 12 has a very full body and feels creamy and smooth in the mouth. What a nice and beautiful beer."
"D - One of the best, albeit high on the ABV scale."
"drinkability- strong alcohol flavor makes drinking a lot of these difficult. although with the strength of the malts it all balances well."
"Doured Dark Brown with a good head. Aroma of cherries and raisins. Taste similar with a great deal of complexity with notes of dark, fruit, red wine, and funk. Has an excellent mouth feel. Med-high carbonation. Very complex. Strong biitter finish. Excellent Beer"
"M/D: Highly drinkable with a good level of carbonation, not overpowering but enough so that you notice it. Medium body to it, creamy and finished well. This is one that I am going to be consistently buying."
"I am as bit disappointed with this beer. It seems a bit reserved and nothing all that special."
"Poured into a goblet glass and received a rootbeerish brown with good carbonation that led to a 1-finger head that left quickly. A rich malt (caramel, bread, chocolate and coffee all come to mind) and citric fruit smell, mainly grapfruit, apparent in the nose w/ minimal spicing. The fruit flavoring is what I noticed most - grape, cherry, sour apple, pear - and then a bready malt sweetness mixed w/ caramel and chocolate. A medium to full body that goes down smooth but not slick and only a tad syrupy, with a slight mix of pepper. The ABV is hidden well here, and this is one of my fave beers. Only the ABV and price keep me from continually downing 4-packs of this stuff."
"Recommended for sure. Now I know why the monk on the bottle is so happy."
"Overall, not something I would want more than one of at a time. Great flavors and very complex."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. The drink settled with a dark, light chocolate head that was pretty thick. Aroma-wise, it was pretty wheaty with mocha complements. Taste-wise there was a great mocha, coffee flavoring wrapped around the bready hints I sensed when I smelled it. The drink was creamy with a low-medium body. Overall, this was wicked good."
"Nice drinkability for such high ABV."
"D - This is a great beer thats pretty easy to drink I could probably drink too many of these if I didn't pay attention worth finding to try"
"D: Very drinkable. Everything you want in a quad. Could drink the whole bottle my myself with minimal effort."
"D- There's a bottle that's aging in the cellar plus I can get this any time. Will try it again and review again later, but this is like drinking malty water."
"Drinkability is very good, damn tasty, highly digestible, and smooth enough that you can easily overindulge. I love it so much, I find myself drinking it to fast that my buzz gets ahead of me, and as much as it pains my palate, having to let it sit before I come back. Luckily, it continues to get tastier as it warms! A true classic, and benchmark for the style."
"D- A really nice brew. Would drink again. I just can't see me sitting around drinking a lot of these though."
"D: this beer is great, the revues I read said that this is the closest you can come to westwelderen ABT 12, goosh I can wait to get me a bottle of Westwelderen ABT 12, anyway I am going t stock on this one for now and make sure I age them 3 years or so this is by far the best and well balanced beer I tasted, I love the warmth of alcohol a the body the creaminess, and the plum fig and all... for all of you out there this is perfection ( for my taste of course )"
"Poured into the proper goblet, very nice. Appearance was dark brown with plenty of white fluffy head. Aroma was very full with earthy notes and the dark, rich, sweet candied belgian sugars. Taste is very full with sweetness and dark fruit flavors. Mouth feel was very rich, velvety and warming alcohol presence."
"Believe the reviews, give it a try if you have the chance. A quintessential Belgian."
"Fullish-medium in body with exquisitely fine carbonation. Exceptionally smooth and very drinkable given the potent 10% abv. This is a delicious beer I like better from the 750 ml bottle than from the smaller 330 ml offering. Divine on-tap."
"D: very good, but there seemed to be something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on, I aged my bottle about 8 months, maybe more would have been appropriate"
"Overall, a nice strong-dubbel Belgian ale. Tasty and enjoyable, though I did not enjoy it as much as I expected I might with the very high ranking this beer enjoys on BA. I do think there are many better Belgians out there."
"Brown in color this poured a fine thick head that slowly dissipated. The nose was filled with sweet raisesn, ripe cherries, plum and a great spiciness. In the mouth it was medium to full-bodied with a denisity and weight that was full bet extremely well-balanced by the effervecance. In fact the effervecance keeps this very light on its feet for such a high alcohol and powerful beer. There is a tightness to the beer that makes me think aging will bring out a complexity and hedonistic quality that is hiding today. Age this one and see what happens."
"this is a strong beer that does not feel it, its a great beer, very style appropriate...must try"
"God bless those monks!"
"Overall, this was a great beer, however not one that I can drink frequently or in great quantity. I am very glad I picked this up and will definitely grab it again."
"Drinkability: Complex and amazing, and all-night sipper at its finest."
"From an aggressive pour into an oversize wine glass produced a massive +3 fingers worth of head and almost when over the top of the glass. Good amount of lacing with head receding but never completely going away leaving a sort of foam island in the center of the glass. Dark black chocolate color and smelled of doughy yeast. Tasted dark roasted malts, cinnamon, cloves, and a little amount of sweetness. Alcohol was present but never overwhelming. Very attractive looking beer when first poured."
"""Bringing heavenly nectar within reach"". This is a quote from the back of the bottle. Indeed this wonderful ale is out of this world. It pours dark brown and is very opaque. The head is thick and creamy, with a tan color that leaves good lacing. The aroma is full of cherries, earthy yeast and dried fruits, as well as intoxicating liquor smell. The warming alcohol is bold and up front with roasted malts and some bitter hops. As you continue to sip the dark fruits come out. Black cherries, prune and dried apricot mingle with a caramel like sweetness on the on the tongue. The palate is thick and velvety smooth with a long finish and lively carbonation."
"D: Tasty but this should be a rare treat that needs to be sipped and enjoyed. The alcohol is noticeable, as it should be in this style, and after the bottle I'm starting to get a light buzz."
"Abt 12 is excellent beer. As far as Quads go, it's right up there at the top. Frankly, it's every bit as good as Westvleteren 12. And that's saying a lot. Westvleteren 12 may have a very slight edge. But, it is an extremely close call. Certainly a ""must try"" for every BA."
"Smells and tastes sweet and bready and spicy. I sense cinnamon, dark fruits, cherries, caramel, and citrus. It's a balanced and complex beer. There's some alcohol warmth on the finish, but it's very silky and smooth and creamy. This is a good beer once in a while, but the ABV is too high to turn into a session beer."
"Pours a hazy deep brown color with red highlights and a thick cream colored head that has good retention and lacing into my goblet. Smells of caramel, fresh baked rolls, spices, dark fruits, lemon, and just enough alcohol to remind you it's a big beer. Tastes of sugar and caramel sweetness up front followed by yeasty bread, some clove and other spices, and a finish of figs, raisins, and other dark fruits with just enough alcohol warmth and a slight citrus twist to it. Medium-full in body, smooth with nice effervescent carbonation. Alcohol presence is noticeable, but it is 10% alcohol and it has a very warming feel to it and accompanies the other flavors nicely, completing the balance. A great, very drinkable Quad with great flavor and balance, though just a bit too high in alcohol to be something I'd want to have very often."
"If only the alcohol was lower, I would sip this one all night with good company or a good book."
"Notes: I simply love this beer. It is my default beer at the Bier Markt in Cleveland, Ohio."
"Pour this one carefully. This brew starts off with a thick head and a strong aroma. Smells salty and bitter at first but lightens up as it breathes. The color is a very murky brownish amber full of sediment. Tastes of cloves, yeast, cinnamon, raisin, and elusive fruit. The carbonation froths up as you sip making for an exceptional mouthfeel. It's a heavy slow-drinker that tastes better as it warms up."
"D - a good, warming beer to to sip and enjoy."
"M/D - Very smooth and creamy. Good carbonation and an excellent drinkability."
"T: Full side of medium bodied, very creamy and smooth with appropriate carbonation. For such a big beer, alcohol has a welcome presence, but is very well hidden, nice warming effect. Strong malty body and follows the nose with a ripe fruit taste and light spiciness. Pleasant sweetness in the finish. Overall, a very nice beer, easy (at least for me) to take this beer for granted and overlook how good it is."
"D - This is a good beer. I would not have any problems having several. Recommended and worth a try."
"In the mouth it has an initial bitterness. Then it lingers on the tongue for a while. Overall this is a once a year beer for me but enjoyable none the less."
"This Belgian treat would be hard to beat. Worth every $!"
"I paid the 5 dollars for one bottle of this beer because of the high reviews it received. After chilling it and them letting it sit out to get it to the 53-56 degrees that is recommended, I opened it up. I then had to wait another 5 minutes for the head to dissipate after pouring it. The wait was well worth it. For an alcohol content of 10.2% you barely taste it. The best part of the beer is the after taste. It finishes very smooth and delicious. It was a good beer to try but I could never afford to drink it on a consistent basis. I recommend to try it at least once so you can get a feel for what a real beer tastes like."
"D: Awesome beer. So hard to just sip it due to the wine-like dryness. The flavor is really nice but not too complex. Something good year round, simple and strong. Highly recommend."
"I have no idea."
"D: Lesson learned. Heed the bottle's advice and drink before the date printed on the bottle. (3.5)"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't talk about the style it's under - that's subject to change. But it says it's a dubbel. You'd think the Belgians, if anyone, would know their styles, wouldn't you? But then... Maybe this is one of the original big beers - they call it a dubbel so that it will completely blow any other dubbel out of the water in terms of, well, everything. Color, head, opacity, aroma, flavor. To name a few. So, that's all I've got to write, I guess. Enjoyed it. Won't seek it out again, but, really, enjoyed it for the style."
"Overall, I wouldn't get this again unless it was on sale."
"D-I wouldn't drink more than a couple of these in a sitting, but to do so would decrease my appreciation for this most excellent beer."
"Compareable to Westvleteren and Rochefort 10."
"D-A very nice specimen worth the coin."
"Massive head, starts oozing from the bottle upon removing the cork. Pours a cherry brown. Smells of yeast and raisins, vine fruits, and alcohol. Head diminishes over time to thin minute bubbles, leaves nice lacing on glass. Taste of raisins, and yeast, very nice malty, slight sweetness. Thin mouthfeel, not clinging like some other quads. Sweet somewhat dry finish. Very drinkable, high alcohol content drinker beware."
"Mouthfeel was rich but zippy. Medium to full in body."
"I was only able to get through 6oz of this before I had to stop. So intense, and so thick that I couldn't go on. It was definitely an experience and one that I am glad I had. I might have this again with some food so that I don't get so buzzed off of just a few sips!"
"D--For a 10.5?? Hell yeah. If you are looking for a challenging strong trappist ale, this isn't challenging. Just enjoyable."
"Very underwhelmed by this. Smell was decent yet somewhat faint. Smells of light chocolately roastiness, a touch of belgium yeast and metal, and mostly of raisins. The second this hits my tongue the ridiculously high carbonation basically turns the beer into foam. Feels like champagne in the mouth. Taste is a touch dark fruit, roasty, raisiny, light but standard belgium yeast character and caramel. Honestly, the mouthfeel was the worst part of it. Fizziest beer I've had in nearly 500 beers. Alcohol is hidden well, but I'd be happy to never drink this again."
"Drinkability: There's something about this beer that makes my imagine sitting by the fire on a snowy night. I suppose it's vaguely similar in look and flavor to a spiced winter cocktail. Either way, the alcohol, while fairly high, adds a faint sweet warming note, yet it doesn't overwhelm my palate."
"Its too bad that these bottles are so small because this is something I'd like to drink by the pint."
"Drinkability- Great for an occasional faux trappist treat. Good for a session? Not quite, but I would enjoy a day of Bernardus just for grins."
"D: There is an abundance of fruit and malts yet the sweetness is well balanced by the spicy yeast and alcohol. There is a nice finish and and nice alcohol that slows you down from drinking it too fast."
"From the beerguy in Waldoboro, 11.5oz bottle. Pours a hazy brown color with a very fluffy long lasting head. Smells like sweet candy. Tastes like dried candied fruit, plum, dried orange, hides the alcohol quite well. Good mouthfeel. Overall a nice sipping beer, alittle too fruity tasting, sometimes it reminds me of fruit rolls ups but overall I like it and would definetly recommend."
"Drinkability: It's about time that I finally decied to pop one open and try it. I was glad that I did. Since it's almost everywhere, I will more likely try this one again in the future. It's one Belgian beer that everyone should try for themselves!"
"Drinkability- Very good; especiallu for a Belgina!!!!"
"Pours a raspberry brownish color with yeasties floating around. A huge fluffy tan head sticks around for a while, finally leaving a nice consistent lacing all around. Smell is complex with a panoply of dark fruits, big malts, grain, nectar, and sugary sweetness. Tastes a bit tart and not as complex as the aroma, but still quite tasty. Raisins, breads and slight hops finish things off. Alcohol is well-hidden. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Another great addition to the consistently great St. Bernardus lineup."
"Pours a deep brown, hazy to the point of opaqueness. Huge, fluffy off-white head that leaves lacing plastered all over my chalice. Most excellent. Nose consists of a delicious malt background of sweet bread and caramel. Ripe dark fruits are also present. Hugely complex and potent. Taste is incredibly sweet. It almost tastes like a wholesome candy. Bread, fruit, and spices are all present in just the right amounts. This feels great - very smooth. Medium bodied. A must-have for beer lovers!"
"I would recommend this to people, like me, who do not really care for Belgian Blondes because this is quite different. A real surprise."
"D - well of course this is great! It's Abt 12! I can easily polish off a 750 mL of this provided I'm not too full when I begin. Of course I'll be drinking this again. If you haven't had it yet (and I assume your excuse would be that it's not sold in your area) get on it!"
"hazy reddish brown with a just barely off white head. retention and lace are good as well. nose is of fruit, plum, raisin, malt and faint hop. georgeous. taste is complex and well balanced mix of nose and more. great medium full body that is not nearly as prickly as most of its competitors. i've had this one on tap and in 330ml and 750ml bottles. it never ceases to amaze me. this brewery is one of my favorites, and definitely holds its own against the top dogs. i'll have another!!"
"It poured a very earthy brown with hints of red swirling throughout. A nice tan/red head that disappears in after a few sips. I have had this in a bottle as well and I feel that if you can get it on tap, especially at a place that has it at the right temp. you can smell the aromas of fruit, caramel, and clove right away as well as the alcohol. In the taste you can pick up raisins, caramel, lemon/citrus, clove, and possibly berries. It is very delicious and refreshing on the way down. When it strikes your palate you can really appreciate the flavors in this beer. It is a tremendous balance of everything. An easy beer to drink not heavy in carbonation and no very filling, just high in alcohol content."
"Very good one to sit back and sip for the night. There's a reason why this is one of the most popular Belgian Quads."
"this is an awesome beer easy drinking and high octane which can be a scary combo."
"Had via bottle, poured into an oversized wine glass. Pours a dark brown. Smells of fig, sweet molasses, and roasted malt. Taste is sweet, but not cloying. The Belgium gumball tasting yeast is present, but is accompanied by the complex darker sweetness of the roasted malt. A great beer, and a good example of the quad style."
"Pours like a loaf of hearty whole-grain or pumpernickel from a 750 into an Ommegang goblet - head has a meringue-like consistency. Nice, light/moderate carbonation. Essence of pine, nutmeg and sweeter spice flavors with moderate hop presence. This tastes like a quintessential Belgian. Deep, soulful yeast/malt presence with well-balanced sweetness, hop and alcohol presence. As time passes it provides the warming feeling of Thanksgiving dinner with even a hint of sweet potatoes and roasted carrots (I know, now I'm really full of $#!+ - maybe it's the power of suggestion). The carbonation is moderate, inoffensive and pleasant. This is all-encompassing, powerful wonderful stuff. Coats the mouth like a warm, almost-savory dessert and has the warming power of spiked hot chocolate in a ski lodge. For all its power it drinks very easily. Splendid effort."
"D: Incredible drinkability especially for its abv. Definitly a rich experience and recommend."
"Pours a dark misty brown with a big bubbly tan head that sticks around all the way till the last sip. The smell is sweet and yeasty with spices, maybe cinnamon, very complex and interesting. The taste follows suit, complex, big, and good. Starts sweet with the kick of spices followed. Finishes dry with the high ABV being very noticable, but not taking away the flavor. This one has medium body with a good deal of carbonation, but still a smooth body. This is definitely a sipping beer considering the big flavor and high ABV. A beer definitely worth checking out."
"Beautiful. Pours dark brownish with a red tinge with a large, creamy, kahki head that stays for the duration. Excellent lacing. Smell is extremely strong, good, but very complex. Aroma has heavy yeast notes, with undertones of pine, chocolate malts, and apple, cinnamon and ginger and many fruits that I cannot put my finger on. Alcohol is appereant in the aroma. Flavor is great and continues on for a long long time. The aftertaste has a hint of sweetened Marmite, which shows the yeast in this beer. Creamy body with lively carbonation and an alcoholic aftertaste, this beverage was a pleasure to drink, and I cannot wait to taste the bottle of Abt 12 SE that I was able to get a hold of!"
"D- Boozy, but good. I would drink a few if I had no where to drive in the next 12 hours."
"One of my favorite examples of a true monk ale. Pairs well with most anyhing and can be enjoyed any time of year."
"The flavor begins with a rich malt sweetness that is hiding a spicy almost fruity flavor that finishes very dry and clean. This ale is way too drinkable for the alcohol content. Overall an excellent example of the style."
"Overall, it was very nice experience. Definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability- Pretty damn good brew. For the most part the alcohol is hidden well and it's extremely well balanced. I haven't gotten to try all the Trappist brews yet but this one is on par with the ones I have had. These monks know what they're doing!"
" Over 10% abv with absolutely no hint of alcohol, mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth. The taste is nothing short of amazing. My palate is way too dumb to even grasp the complexity. For all the adjectives that I could try and conjure up to explain this brew; I know they would just fall short to describe how great this beer really is. The St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a must try period."
"This is without a doubt the finest St. Bernardus beer that I have yet sampled, and probably one of the best beers in the world, in my opinion... Copped a single, 12 oz bottle from Gary's in Madison... Absolutely incredible pour and appearance with a gigantic foamy, frothy, five-finger head that had incredible staying power and floated aloft a dark-brown, nutty hue... Smell was fresh and intense, with deep caramel and toffee notes... Smell was beyond terfiffic... rich, deep, intense, satisfying, and creamy... replete with candied brown sugars, malts, slight vanilla, and other flavors that are intricate and difficult to describe... a wonderful conglomeration of pure malty goodness that stuck to the mouth long after the first sip... one of the top Belgian beers, for sure... Great creamy and rich mouthfeel... drinkabliity only took a hit because of the hefty 10.5% ABV, which, by the way, is nearly impossible to detect - masked by a interwoven cornucopia of toffee, malts, and fig flavors that pack a punch... Outstanding beer... Definintely recommended..."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I've had this from bottle bfore and, while good, it wasn't nearly this great. Get it on tap if you can!"
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 pours a deep dark brown with a large one inch head. The smell is mild, but very pleasant of fruit like aromas. Fruit and malts are most evident in the taste, but the big wow for this beer is its exceptionally silky and airy smooth mouthfeel. This is just simply a great and fun beer to drink. Part of what makes the drinkability so enjoyable is the pleasant little chest tingle accompanied after every sip."
"Went to my distributor a few days before Christmas hoping to land a few bottles of Chimay Blue. Just so happened that someone snagged the last of them. The owner suggested this heavenly nectar. Pours a wonderful deep brown, the smell is amazing. I found myself taking a sniff before every sip. The taste just knocked me out. I had never tasted anything like this and I wanted more. Suffice to say, I have 3 packs in my fridge now. An amazing ale that needs to be tried by any Beer lover!!"
"Pours a chestnut brown color with a tight and explosive light tan head that left some nice curtain lacing when it dissipated. The smell is of clove, light banana and bubblegum. Belgian candi sugar moves in bringing some fruity esters with it. Big bold flavor, sweet. The taste hits you with clove and other spice, followed by candi sugar, light roasted malt, and some dark fruit esters. The feel is moderate to well bodied with very fizzy carbonation. Would have given the feel a 5 but the carbonation is a bit much. There is a nice balance between the sweet, spice, and roasted characteristics. Though it does lean on the sweet side. There is a bit of a belly burn due to the 10.5ABV. A very flavorful brew, perhaps a tad to fizzy and sweet. I look forward to cellaring one of these to see if the carbonation settles down."
"This is certainly a strong beer. At 10% ABV, it's meant to be savored. I can down lesser beers at a pretty rapid pace (at least the first 2-3) but I've met my match on this one. And who would want to rush it anyway. Well done St Bernardus."
"D- One of the best beers I have ever had. Period. Perfect balance, amazing complexity, impecible flavors."
"M + D: A very smooth abbey ale, with a nice, full body. With a bit of a liberal gulp from a goblet, it fills the mouth and goes down with a little added warmth. Quite excellent."
"I aged mine for like, three years or so. Murky root beer color with a fast fading creamy tan head. Aroma of donuts, gum balls, and damp packed-down dirt (my grandfather dug his own basement beneath his farmhouse). slightly sweet, store-brand generic raisin bran flavor. Medium body with a slightly tannic finish. The aroma improves as it mellows in the glass."
"Bottle conditioned. Pours a beautiful ruby brown, with a generous off-white head, which slowly diminishes to a small creamy foam of microbubbles. The aroma is a strong bouquet of fruit and sweet malts - it smells like you should eat it with a spoon. The flavour is divine, and changes as the drink warms. Raisins and dried figs feature prominently, and every now and then a hint of peach comes through. The sweet malts are present from the start, and become more dominant as time goes by, as does the fruitiness of the yeast. Exceptionally creamy on the palate, and with a warming finish, this makes me glad that this is the first bottle of a case of 24!"
"Poured into a red wine glass, its a slightly hazy brown and light tan head. Rich smell of dark fruit malts that gives way to the cherries and blackberries in the flavors that roll over your tongue with a mellow caramel. It finishes with a grassy hops note that stands up to the big malts and adds a wonderful balance. This bottle ran out too quickly."
"Pours dark and cloudy, heavy yeast content. Very prominent and foamy head. The head settles to about three inches, is very carbonated and sort of looks like root beer head. Very malty and fruity smell. Taste is basically what you would expect, heavy and good yeast/fruit flavor. This is a good Belgium trappist. Each one seems to bring something different to the table. Big fan."
"I was turned on to this beer just a couple of weeks ago at my next door neighbor's X-mas party. I am an Ale drinker but this was my first taste of a Quadruple Ale. This was absolutely hands down the best tasting beer I have experienced. I have tried 3 or 4 quadruples since and I enjoyed all of them. Today my special order arrived and I am just finishing my first bottle. This will be my reference Beer until I try something better. This has it all. I am not yet qualified to get all fancy with my descriptions but this beer poors great, smells great, is awesome on the front end and even better on the back end. This beer fired me up enough to seek it out and buy about a two month supply and join the beer advocate! I have to start somewhere don't I?"
"D- I could drink a few glasses of this. This is a very good quad!"
"This was my first high alcohol content beer on tap. Beautiful in a glass, with a thick frothy head. I found it very creamy and delightful to sip. It has more of an alcohol taste but it's very drinkable. I found it a much easier sipping beer than Delirium Tremens (my first high alcohol content beer, period). After two glasses I was glad I drank it at Mr. Dunderbak's so I could wander the mall and sober up a bit."
"Overall experience: It commands a higher price and with good reason. This was a nice treat."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink, sip and unwind to."
"Medium-full in body, smooth and creamy. Id have no problem sipping this all night long - goes down way too easily. Excellent."
"Pours a murky ruby brown. Mild nose with slight yeast tones. Touch of grapefruit scents. Flavor seems dominated by the alcohol. A bit of brown sugar sweetness. Basically I feel like this is a bucket of overdone sweetness. Feel is so-so. Carbonation seems to high and I feel it interferes with the flavor. Drinkability has to stay at 4. It just seems too much. I tried the Prior 8 right before this and found I liked it much better. I will concede that I may have gotten a weak bottle and I will plan to try it again in the future."
"Nice full dark brown with good head and excellent lacing. Strong notes of raisin and cherry. Very nice taste with strong yeast characteristics. Alcohol very present but subdued by the other flavors. I could have easily managed to drink the entire bottle over the course of the night. This is a wonderful example of a Belgian quad."
"It pours a dark cherry almost brown with a pinky finger head that cascades the glass. The aroma is of dark cherry, plum and dried apricot. The flavor has a cola sweetness to it with subtle vanilla, clove and allspice. Texture is quite creamy. A very full beer that is surprisingly easy drinking for it's high ABV."
"Overall one of the best damn beers i've ever tasted."
"d: Wonderful example of the beer...almost scary drinkable with such a high alcohol content. I'm at a loss for words at how wonderful this beer is!"
"750 ml Bottle poured murky brown off white head goes quick to lace. Strong yeasty plum, raison, cherries are some of the aromas that fill my nose. Sweet and malty along with wonderful sweet fruit flavors, that finishes with a light alcohol burn to it. Mouth feel is warm and bubbly. This truly is one of my favorite Quads"
"D: Not bad at all. I can't see having more then one of these per session, unless you were interested in getting hammered. A nice selection to enjoy on a cold night, by the fire."
"shared a 750 at a family holiday gathering"
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 is an absolutely excellent beer in every respect. It possesses a nice appearance and pleasant smell. The taste - that's why we're all here, right? - is fantastic. The alcohol is masked exceptionally well, and you never feel overwhelmed by it. It's an immensely drinkable beer. Only one very minor quibble: it leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. This, of course, is no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater. On the whole, the Belgians have outdone themselves again with this beer."
"Drink during a nice meal. The high ABV will prevent most people from drinking more than two or three per session."
"I feel that this is the saints premier brew. A great example of a quadruple. very strong, and smooth. reminds me of the scaldis slogan. pours dark brown with good head, and good nose. tastes of great dark fruits, and spice. the carbonation is a little higher than i like, but doesnt wreck the brew like it can with some. if you like this brew try urthel samaranth as well, its a little more yeasty and less carbonated."
"Im very excited to be trying this one. beautiful mahogany color, fluffy,creamy head that has long retention. instant huge aromas of dried fruits,roasted malts, caramels, figs,holiday puddings. taste-wow! what a palate overload of fruits,vanilla,caramel.ends with a cloying tart finish,alcohol burn in the throat. its so good, I just want to chug, but will force myself to sip."
"I tried this beer to see what the fuss was all about. Although it is a very good beer I don't think it lived up to my expectations. Just too sweet for my tastes. The cost is a bit prohibitive as well."
"It's kinda scary just how easy this is to drink... I'm doing my best to keep the reins tightened. Also IMO this is much better at the higher end of the suggested serving temp."
"Somewhat disappointing flavor/aroma. Some sour cherries, plums, a hint of chocolate and a ton of yeast and spices. Also, the acohol is really prevalent. Bother-ingly so. It's a complex brew, but I wouldn't say the disparate elements are in harmony. You have more fun picking out flavors than just sitting back and enjoying it."
"If you have not had the pleasure, get this one ASAP!"
"This beer is awesome."
"Poured slightly golden hazy from a 11.2 oz bottle. Nice off white head on top with good lacing. Smells are spicy dominated with clove. Tasted so smooth with the spice flavors lingering. I wonder if there is some wheat in this-reminded me of a very mild hefe or wit with a better sweet malt base. Hops are there and give a little citrus but are light. Very enjoyable-very balanced. The alcohol is well hidden-a dangerous tripel as I could sip this all night. Overall, a very subtle beer with a lot of flavors blended together. I'll buy another one and keep it on the shelf for a bit-if I can resist it."
"D = Good robust beer, a very approachable Belgian, would be good introduction to Belgian beer for beginners and nice drink for beer geeks, too."
"This is a great beer to sit, relax with and enjoy."
"overall just a great beer that makes me want to keep trying the abbey ales"
"I think often times people need a beer to WOW them to consider it very good, sometimes it just needs to be without flaws and drinkable. This is a beer worth repeat visits."
"Quite simply this has become my favorite beer. The appearance is caramel brown, the smell fruity and sweet malty, the taste is incredibly complex yet fuses together into a wonderful impression - raisins, caramel, toffee... The mouthfeel at first seems a little bit over-carbonated, but as it warms and settles, it is simply perfect."
"SKOAL!"
"I cant put my finger on what the smell or taste of this one is, but I know that both are very enjoyable. St Bernardus' line has yet to disappoint me. Give this one a try!"
"This was a good beer, I was not as impressed as I should have been. I do admit that I did read up on this one before I tried it, I was expecting more from this beer but had the same feeling when I saw the Independence Day Trailer than watched the movie. It was not that disappointing but it was kind of like that, I enjoyed it, although it was not spectacular to the palete."
"D - I'm not sure I could go through more than a few, the abv is rather high, but were I to make a night of this exquisite delight, it would certainly be a night to remember. Very highly recommended."
"Pours a deep drown, nearly opaque and with reddish hints when held up to the light. Head is thin and not quite as large as I'd expected, dissipating rather quickly and leaving some lacing. Smell is deep and complex, cloves and pepper; raisin, plum, and currants; a whiff of brandy and a touch of caramel, with yeast and bread mixed in for good measure. Taste is similar, dark fruits and spices leading the charge with rich breadiness underpinning it all. Earthiness and a bit of butter(?) as well, with the alcohol evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is a touch thin and a bit watery, though still good, and drinkability is good. A slight disappointment for me, it's very good but doesn't bowl me over the way I'd hoped it would."
"Very easy to drink this, even with the alcohol content. Smooth going down, a great beer to share with friends. Of the Belgians of this style I've tried so far, it's my favorite."
"Incredibly drinkable for somethings so complex."
"Quads aren't my favorite but this was damn good."
"Personal score- 90/100"
"I have just found pure heaven in this beer. This beer must have been brewed by the great lord himself. Becuase i have found my heaven in this bottle. It pours a very dark mahogony brown. with a very thick 3 finger cream head. The smell isn't very overpowering, mostly of light malt. But the taste, oh my the taste It is so complex to me I can't fully comprehend it. It's kind of a nutty flavor with the alcohol coming through as the beer warms up. I don't really know how to describe this beer. It was just an amazing experience drinking it. This is by far the best beer I have ever had."
"D- Man, what else to say. This definitely ranks up there with the best I have had. Unreal beer. I could have given a *5* I suppose on certain aspects, but I am still in search for the worlds best beer. This beer is so drinkable, its scary. I think I need a second job now just so I can drink more of this stuff. Loved it!"
"Drank a bottle of this during a house-warming party. Best-by date says August 26, 2010. This turned out to be an exceptional beer. Poured the color of a cherry cola, with a tall, foamy head and amazing retention. A little bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Constant effervescence. Smells and tastes are so complex. Aromas of white wine, concord grapes, apples, dark sugar. Flavors of apples, cherries, brown sugar molasses. And that's barely scratching the surface; there were so many more things that I couldn't identify. Mouthfeel is fizzy with a touch of alcohol bite, but otherwise this beer hides the alcohol quite well. Very drinkable beer - enjoyable for its complexity. I will always remember this beer as an excellent Belgian."
"It was a great beer and next time I need to buy the bigger bottle.It made my girls mom burp and fart. :) All in all its a great beer and the hype lived up to the name."
"Absolutely wonderful beer. I am a big fan of Belgian ale and this is my favorite so far."
"Worth the hype...but Impy stouts are still better than this style to me."
"D- This is a very nice quad that, despite the high ABV, I found to be very drinkable. The flavors compliment each other well in this complex brew and it was a real treat to have tried it. Something I will have again."
"[D] The complexity is almost too much.. the tongue gets tired after a few and something less alcoholic and less flavor full is needed after 2-3 or these... this is not to say that this is a most magnificent beer!"
"D - Obvioulsy not a session beer and even two in a night would probably be too much. One to slowly sip on over an hour or two."
"Mouthfeel is medium and chewy. Alcohol is ver present. This is a definate sipper and I think if I had drank the whole bottle by myself I would have caught a nice buzz. I am definately going to buy some more of these and put them down for some aging."
"In any event, this is a magnificent beer, a worthy centerpiece to St. Bernardous' line of beers. I will certainly seek it out again."
"Drinkability : Bière intéressante au caractère équilibré, mais je préfére la St Sixtus 12."
"I could drink this all day. Man. I think they have this beer in the afterlife, because I couldn't imagine a heaven that didn't have this beer."
"This is a great beer. Sure, at 10.50% ABV, it's a big one, but you should what you're getting yourself into with a quad in the first place. Belgian beer fans will really enjoy this one, and beer beginners would do well to give this a try; it's not the best intro Belgian beer for those not familiar with the styles, but it's well worth trying."
"Great mouthfeel, plenty to be excited about. You can sense the alcohol, but it's not overwhelming. Overally, I'm really impressed and will be buying this again. It's as good as some of the best trappist brews."
"d: excellent beer which i've had previously, more memorable than the 60th anniversary version, & packs a punch i'm happy to take time & again. i do love quadrupels & this one sets the mark."
"Small little bottle, lots of kick. Poured into oversized wine glass. Pours a deep brown with mahogany highlights. Slightly off white, 1 finger head with excellent retention, leaves decent lace trails. The first smell that hits me is alcohol, then some grapes (almost wine-like) and tart cherries. Overall sour, tangy smell. Tastes of malt, tart fruit (some raisin), and a hint of toasted grain that seems to be present. Warming sensations as it slides down. Moderate to low carbonation leaves a thick, full mouthfeel which wasnt the most appealing. Overall a great beer, 1 is plenty so a 4 on drinkability but well worth experiencing."
"D - I was really surprised by this beer. Certainly I was introduced to something good!"
"Pours a dark redish brown with nice beige head that sticks around. The smell is of over ripe banana. Flavor gets better with nice malt and fruit with definate alcohol. Mouthfeel has lots of body. Very good but not as drinkable as some strong Belgian beers."
"Overall- What can I say other than this beer is incredible. I wish this one was available in New Orleans."
"Notes: I almost gave it a 5 in smell, but left it at 4.5 b/c of the alcohol as it warms. . . . Glad to find this on tap, and now I'm looking forward to the 60th Anniversary Edition I've had in the cellar since January. . . ."
"Cheers!"
"I'll keep coming back to St. B especially since it's so easily available. This is a quad that stands up to and surpasses some of the finest Trappist ales."
"All in all this is a decent beer, but i am really upset that i thought it beat out westy 12."
"Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and Westy 12 in this tasting and slightly above the Chimay Blue. I aged a 750ml of this for a few years and it was incredible. It was probably all 5's or damn close if I rated it. The 750s are quite a bit better than the 12 oz bottles IMO. In other tastings, this finished ahead of the Rochefort 10, but not this time. Truely a world-class beer (as were the others). Definitely pick some up....and age a few."
"WOW This was reccomended to me by the bartender at yard hose, and i;n glad i accepted. this was a great beer. full flavor and body, but not overpowering or overlingering on the palete. this is a drinking beer, this is not mich ultra or coors ligh where downing a pitcher in under 5 mins is condsidered enjoyment, ie to get a ton of alcohol in your system. this beer though is unique with it's 10.5% alcohol, you dont need to down massive quantities to feel relaxed, this isnt a football party beer, it's a beer to grab after a long days work and let yourself unwind and relax."
"A+"
"Poured a ruby dark brown color with a lacy thick head. The aroma is filled with esters of prune and raisin with a little carmalized sugars in the backgrounds. Taste is prune, toffee, and raisins with a big malt body that is chewy but creamy. The alcohol is present but still well masked for being 10%. Perfect beer for afterdinner or with a nice cheese."
"Big foamy head, dark brown ale color, and floating unfermentables greet you to this quad. Has a sweet smell of raisins, plums,figs and cinnamon. Taste is excellent, good balance of all taste involved. Alcohol is there, but covered by the sweetness of the fruit. A nice delicacy for any night. A word of warning though, I took mine out of the fidge and let it come to temp for about 15-20 minutes. I twisted the metal wire off and took the cap of and about 10 seconds later the cork blew off without being touched. I did not get big effect of beer flying everywhere, so I know I did not shake it, but make sure this is not pointed at anything valuable. I'll still drink this again, projectiles be damned."
"I dug this out of the ""cellar"" to see how it was after a year or so. It's a fine beer, but my cellaring methods may have eliminated some of the taste complexity of this beer. It smelled great but didn't follow it up with unbelievable taste. Still a very good beer though."
"D - An fantastic quad, that is highly drinkable for the 10% that it is. Soft, smooth and light in body, never cloying. Wonderful in every sense, a true taste delight."
"D - Overall it looks good, smells good and tastes amazing. Exceptionally complex taste-wise and moderately complex smell-wise. I will drink more, and so should you."
"I was kinda disappointed with this one as I would put it high up; almost there with the Westy's not sure if mine's a bad bottle... I have one more bottle and getting one more from my dutch friend but let's take a look at this one first. It pours out with a huge bubbly head that retains pretty well; color was the typical dark brown as like many dark belgian ales. The smell was yeasty, and alcoholic fruity; somewhat vinous but not as pleasing as I would have liked it to be. I had a sip and it was alcoholic plums or raisins leaving a lot of alcoholic fruitiness on the nose. It was sweet and the yeasty taste was also clear on this one. For some reason this taste reminds me of the Gouden Carolus although I forgot to review it when I tasted it. The after taste was plums, raisins, grapes and was pretty strong and pleasant. This Quad is closed to full body and was clearly rich and almost syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high but it was still pretty smooth but drinkability would have dropped due to its high and evident alcohol content. I am pretty disappointed as I put this up close with the Westvleterens but seems like it does not even qualify in my top 10 beers list which I expected it to be in anytime. It is a good beer but unfortunately not great; I would give this review a light pass since I have potentially 2 more bottles to go; let's hope that I am not missing a good bottle here."
"Slightly ruddy brown, very murky. Extraordinary carbonation is visible as it appears to be raining upwards around the perimeter of the glass. The head is antique white, and with the delicious appearance of ice cream. Aroma is flowery, powdered sugar and tart berries. Taste starts out very subtle and enticing, slight dark chocolate and fresh fruit note take a turn to sour turn after a couple of seconds. The sourness lingers on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel follows about the same trajectory, beginning supernaturally smooth, ending a little dry and frankly somewhat acidic. This is damn good, I just expected more."
"Pours a dark brown with a ruby hue. Huge cream colored head that dies quick and laces sheets. Smells of brown sugar, dried banana chips, fig and plum. Taste is sweet malt. Plum, spice, again the banana chips, fig and a little caramel. Full in the mouth with a nice tickle on the tongue from carbonation. Sip with pleasure."
"D: At first I didnt think this beer was going to live up to its hype, but the taste and mouthfeel did it for me. I can see why it's considered a world-class beer."
"Overall, the standard in quads. Huge flavors and huge alcohol. A unique experience and highly recommended."
"This brew poured a nice cloudy brown with big fluffy white head a great lacing. Aromas were of green apple skins, slight cloves and champagne grapes. First sip- big yeastiness and alcohol on the finish with a sour bitterness underlying it all. There is an herbal spiciness which helps mask the obvious alcohol which does a lot to warm the throat. The malts are not too sweet and overpowering but there is an almost lack of true belgian flavor when compared to their other offerings- i was slightly dissapointed; a little flat on the delivery. Ill try this one again sometime soon."
"An excellent beer, lots of flavor without being heavy or out of balance. Perfect drinkability."
"A good beer to sip throughout the evening. It would go well with a nice piece of quality cheese. A good beer for the wine aficionados to cross over to the world of quality brews."
"Cannot wait to try this one on tap at the Yard House if I see it again there"
"Murky reddish brown hue. Well retained, thick, light tan head. Yeast derived nuttiness and rustic must at first in aroma, ensued by ripe peach like fruitiness, mellow banana esters and notes of molasses and butter. Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering. Abt 12 is a delicious, complex, and supremely drinkable brew. Flavorwise, it's reminescent of their 8, although much more pronounced all around. Highly recommended and worth the cost."
"Mouthfeel is medium as the carbonation dance over the tongue spreading the flavors enjoyably. Drinkable given the style as each attribute of this quadruple is in check and enjoyable. I will be purchasing this again, but it will be a rare treat as its an expensive 11.2 oz."
"D: Truly, the benchmark for the style. This beer is an absolute joy to drink! One of the few beers out there that's deserving of ""all 5's""."
"Drinkability is good. This is a potent beer, even though the flavors aren't overly strong. With that said, this is a sipper, and a wonderful one at that."
"Overall, this beer is absolutely fantastic. However, it is much better on tap than in the bottle. While still good in the bottle, there's an excess of carbonation that downgrades its drinkability and mouthfeel. Still an excellent brew after a long day."
"I need a little more time to experince these beers to their fullness."
"D- This is definitely a sipper. I can't see anyone saying it's very drinkable but the flavor makes me want to come back to it every once in a while."
"This was a great beer and I'm so glad I stepped out and ordered it, with the nudging of a great waiter at the Brick Store. This was a wonderful brew"
"Poured into a goblet deep amber color. Thick lacy off white head that stuck around for a while. Good lacing around the glass and nice retention. Smell was of alcohol mixed with nice touches of toffee and nuts. The 10% is very apparent. Easy to drink even though its high alcohol content. Not too carbonated but not chewy. Great beer, worth the $8.99 spent on a 22oz."
"The Belgians clearly have the quadrupel down pat. Westy 12, Rochy 10 and now Berny 12 (yeah I have pet names for them, so what) have really highlighted the craftsmanship of Belgian ales to me. All unique within the same style, and all basically unparalleled. This is a first rate beer."
"This one is the standard to compare the rest, in my opinion."
"Carbonation is briefly a bit high, but within a couple minutes this is smooth as silk, with a great full body and warming finish. Overall drinkability is absurd. This isn't sold in Wichita, but it is at the very top of my shopping list whenever I'm in, say, KC."
"D: The alcohol is not hidden as well as I'd like, so it's a sipper for sure. I'm disappointed considering this beer's reputation - it's not bad, but I certainly didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would. Why do I feel like I need to apologize for not loving this beer?"
"Warmed my insides and mellowed my spirit. . . Definitely one of the best beers I've had in a long time."
"D: Quite a treat - full, rich & enticing. Smooth mouthfeel witha complex sweet/spicy body. A sipper for certain, but one I'd be glad to have often."
"Smooth and velvety on the tongue. Moderate carbonation and a clean very warm finish. The booze peaks in at the end. Probably the second best quad in the world."
"What can you say about this beer except ""Terrific"". It pours medium brown with moderate head. Floral and nutty on the nose, it has aromas of fruitcake and dates. Full bodied, balanced alcohol reveal a complex-tasting beer that is well refined and drinks easy. Vinous in texture and flavor, this beer delivers excellent flavor and mouthfeel. One of my favorites."
"Big bodied and very smooth in the mouth. Probably the first quad I've tried and I'm very impressed with it. I will work on this one for a while savoring every sip."
"Overall this is the best Belgian beer I've had to date, of any style. Very drinkable even with the alcohol strength. Wouldn't want to have more than one or two, I'd be wasted. The aftertaste is reminiscent of fig newton filling. Combined with the malt sweetness, it just tastes nice."
"A bold flavored, well balanced Quadrupel. Understandably a classic, but go easy as this monk packs a punch."
"I did not give it a 5 because I want to be careful not to do that until I am certain I find the perfect beer. However, this is pretty damn close to being the one."
"Them monks sure know what their doing!!!"
"I tried this beer on July 11, 2007 at Cafe Volo in Toronto (only because they were temporarily out of Rochefort Trappistes 10). I was very nervous about trying this....high alcohol content, dark brown, yada yada yaada. Well, try it I did. It poured a dark brown into the glass with a small head that lasted throughout the entire beer. The aroma was thick with bread and hops, and some fruit. It was silky smooth on the tongue with a full-bodied feel. The taste...unlike any beer I've tasted before. There was bread, and malt...and hops. The alcohol was not noticeable on the tongue...but I felt it going down....and this is one damn fine beer!"
"Though it has many fine aspects to it (especially the aroma), I'm not that impressed with this beer overall. The taste and noticable presence of alcohol is the main issue -- I want more flavor in the taste!"
"D- I think this was a excellent beer. In my opinion it beats Westys 12 hands down."
"Pours dark amber, tan lasting head. Smells very sweet and a slight hint of alcohol. Fruity initial flavor rounded off by malt flavors. Short finish. Great drinkability, even the girlfriend enjoyed it. One of my first Belgians, which could come back to haunt me since I doubt I'll like many as much as this."
"Overall: Decided to open up a respected classic for #50. Well worth it."
"I just wish this was easier to get. Such a great beer."
"Overall, it's a very nice, very fruity Beer. Nice mouthfeel."
"Overall - Probably the best beer I've ever had, and the best I have reviewed here. This is quite impressive, considering my love of Australian ales. This has far more character than most beers I've tasted, yet nothing about it is at all offputting."
"One of the truly great beers of the world and well worth getting your hand on this. It works out at £2.50 a bottle which in my opinion is a bargain!"
"Heavy with lots of pop on the tongue. I couldn't quite grasp this beer."
"Like most Belgians I've been drinking lately, I find the carbonation rush at the start bring out the harsh alcohol tones. The true beauty of this beer reveals itself only after it has settled down. However, I still find this one pales in comparison to Rochefort 10."
"D: Shared this with some friends on a cool summer evening and was a bit hit. Would probably try some other styles from this brewer before picking this up again, but a solid offering here."
"It is a little over carbonated right out of the bottle. This is a deep dark brown beer needs a minute to settle and develop a frothy, wheat colored head. It has a smell and taste dominated by malt. The yeast is noticeable is the best way. It goes down creamy. This is wonderfully strong ale that surprised me in more ways than one."
"Overall, a wonderful beer! Delicious and a must have in your fridge."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a snifter glass from a bottle. The beer pours a very deep brown, forming a thin 1/8 inch head. Light spots of lace. The aroma, like most Belgians is very delicious. Fruit notes dominate, along with a slight alcohol presence. The taste is a complex mix of dark fruits, malts, spice, and alcohol. Again the fruit taste dominates the palate, but there are noticeable contributions from the malts and a hint of spice, followed by a slight warming by the alcohol. Smooth thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable quadrupel. Overall, my favorite quadrupel to date. Full flavor and thick taste make for a great Belgian to pass the evening with."
"Drinkability: High alcohol content makes this a dangerous one, but I'm tempted to go pour another glass almost immediately. This is a great beer and crazy drinkable for its strength..."
"drinkability is not very good. lots of alcohol that overpowers some great flavors."
"Excellent beer. Can't wait to order another glass tomorrow..."
"This is such a great beer: hugely aromatic, complexly flavorful, balanced, and so drinkable (at 10.5 ABV to boot). Paired with semi-hard aged goat cheese. One of my all time favorites."
"Looking at this lovely brew you can see it is dark amber brown in color and has plenty of head when poured from the tap but dissapates quickly almost like sea foam, but tasty sea foam. It smells of dark fruit and warm malts, raisins, brown sugar, and even figs w/ some slight hints of banana. The taste is a little piece of heaven, sweet and warm with dark fruits that you can almost chew nice mouthfeel. Overall this is one of my favorites by far."
"Mouthfeel is thick, with prickly carbonation. It is perfect as an after-dinner sipping beverage. I'd like to see how this one develops with aging."
"This is a beautiful beer. Aromas of raisin and dark bread. Taste of raisin and cherry up front with a complex and subtly changing finish full of flavors I don't have the words for yet. Alcohol is pleasantly present, but very much in balance with everything else that's going on. St. Bernardus offers a great deal of bang for your buck... and is a perfect example of why I have fallen in love with Belgian beers. I enjoyed it with a rib eye steak for Father's Day. In my perfect world, this would be my everyday beer."
"Overall, A great find at The Beer Yard. While this one certainly doesn't get drank every day, it is beers like this that makes us wish we didn't have a job so we could. Great in the bottle, but so much smoother on tap. I would love to know how old the keg was, this one drinks like a two year old bottle."
"Poors a deap amber, with a little bit of haze and a whole lot of head. Smells fruity with some rasin and alcohol undertones, and allot of other stuff i cant pick out. Taste is more complex then the smell and the only alcohol apprent is warming and appreciated. All the complexety covers up the 10.5% allowing just enough through, a truly amazing beer."
"St. Bernardus is one of my favorites, an amazing beer, and a steal at under $9. It pours a hazy deep red with a huge foamy head that gradually dissipates down to a half inch that lingers, leaving a nice lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, dark fruits and some dry yeast. The taste is rich and complex, nice fruity dark malts, with just a hint of hop flavor and bitterness. There is delicious spicy yeast character and the beer is perfectly balanced. It still amazes me that this beer is 10.5%, its so smooth and not overly sweet, it could easily pass for much less. The alcohol is barely perceptable, even as the beer warms."
"My experience with Belgians is somewhat limited, but of the few I have had this one is well above the rest. Served from a big 1pint 9oz. corked and caged bottle. I'm thankful for the reviews noting the corks readiness to eject as soon as the cage is twisted. Hazy brown color, typical Belgian head, half of the glass. Nice biscuity malt smell. Tastes are similar, very creamy, big malt sweetness, very slight alc. is apparent. This is a great beer, I'm hoping that as I explore more Belgians in the future they will measure up."
"This pours a huge frothy head. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to have much carbonation after that. Go figure. Its color is an opaque beer bottle brown. It has a lot of fruit overtones w/ a similar fruit-like smell. It does have a copper-like taste but, for some reason, that's not so bad. The mouth-feel is like velvet. It would probably be better w/ a hearty meal than just by itself. I'll try it the next time I have steak au poivre and mashed potatoes."
"What a wonderful beer. This ale is so very drinkable and refreshing which is scary with the 10% ABV. I simply love this beer. More please."
"A phenomenal beer. Seems to have benefitted from a little bit of age, the flavours have moulded together much better."
"I'm with Todd and BlackHaddock. St Bernardus on tap is just amazing, even to an old homebrewer/beer-lover who prefers to have quite a bit more hops in most of her beer. And Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia is to be commended repeatedly for its efforts to serve exceptional beer and great food."
"I was trying to introduce a friend to a nice Belgian and pulled this bottle out of the cooler. Frankly, we were all disappointed. Luckily a few strong stouts were available to save the day. Seems very over-rated with its' position on the Best of BA."
"The rumors are true, this is a very good beer."
"D: Quite possibly the best Belgian that I have sampled. Amazingly complex and full bodied. I will revisit this gem again! Recommended."
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy dark brown with a thick (~2"") head that is light tan and foamy with dark speckles from yeast at the bottom of the bottle. The head leaves an attractive continuous lace as you drink. Very active bubbling in the beer. It smells malty with nutty overtones and a hint of spice - maybe nutmeg and slightly oaky. The initial flavor is moderately sweet and malty with light bitterness and a clean, long-lasting finish with roasted nuts and alcohol. It is medium to full bodied with slightly creamy texture and a dry, alcholic finish. This is an excellent beer with great complex flavor. I have to say I am increasingly enamored by strong belgian ales."
"D- The alcohol especially, and the bready flavor, make for slightly lower drinkability... we split this bottle four ways, and we all had plenty."
"Definitely worth the experience."
"Went extremely well with my Belgian Stoemp Sauccise."
"This is my first Reviewer's Choice Award beer."
"Poured into a chalice, it looks like a darker shade of liquid caramel. Has a nice soapy head that eventually dies and morphs into a creamy head (a la nitro stout). Smell is alcoholic, chocolatey, a touch of caramel, peppery fruit juice, and syrupy. Taste is more of the same, but the spice isn't as rough. Some date flavors poke through, but just as the flavors start to get at you, the alcohol pushes it back down. It has a creamy feel that finishes dry with bready flavors, but the latter is incredibly uplifting, pleasuring you palate and brain by making it so easy to take more and more sips."
"Overall a great Quad, worthy of many repeated tries."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a best by date of July 2011 on the bottom of the bottle. Poured into my Delirium Tremens glass and it has a deep mahogany color. It was nearly opaque but could see bits of yeast floating around the edges. It had earth, malty smell with good sweetness and a good hint of the ABV underneath. The taste was really good with a sweet finish. I really like Tripels but am finding that Quads are good for a few drinks then I'm ready to move on. They have great tastes but the alcohol and sweetness get to me before I can finish the glass. I can see why this is highly regarded but, for now at least, it's not one that I want to have again for awhile. Be interesting to try again in a few years and see where my tastes go. A year ago, I could stand IPA's and now I drink several a week. Highly recommend trying but share a friends bottle unless you really like the strong quads. (3.5, RB, ML, O)"
"Pours deep mahogany with some lacing, slight creamy head. Smell is heavier in the alcohol dept than I would have expected, along with some yeasts, heavy malts, and slight sweetness. Taste is a good balance, especially given its complexities. Caramel malts up front, some yeasts, and then dark fermented fruit flavors along with the alcohols in the background (but not overwhelming). Considering the ABV and the style, it is very smooth and rather easy to drink, albeit filling."
"A most excellent beer!!!"
"D: This is definitely a sipper but it's much more drinkable than I thought it would be with the 10.5%. It's smooth with sweet and delicious complex tastes. An incredibly enjoyable drinking experience. I could have drank more, I was disappointed when my glass was empty."
"Corked and caged 750 which suprisingly was a good representation of a quality quad, but I've had better. Poured this St. Bernardus effort into my deep Duvel Tulip glass. Nice, aggressive, and quite foamy head with loads of lace webbing throughout the session. The aroma was boozy, malty and offered up an average nose of candied sugar. I'd like a heartier aroma than this, but still not bad. A certain booziness in the taste with burnt coffee and some candied sugar, otherwise, slightly understated. Mouthfeel becomes more viscous as the liquid warms. Yes, it's a drinkable brew. I'm a fan of St. Bernardus, but I don't think I got a bottle of stuff that was aged enough. A good but not excellent effort."
"What a treat this beer was. First quad I've had the opportunity to try. There was a lot going on as far as taste goes. Carmel, berries, sweet, rich, and a little bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel was smooth and top notch. Outstanding brew! I look forward to trying more of this style."
"The drinkability was very good. It would not be hard to keep drinking this. I'm guessing this beer would taste even better with age. I would bet that the lemon character would get smoother and rounder over time."
"Drinkability: The alcohol content will keep this from being a beer I can drink a ton of, but damn this is tasty. Very pleased."
"D: excellent. great quadruple, great experience."
"Drinkability - Very tastey and satisfying, but too heavy to enjoy more than one, maybe two."
"Beer poured brown with a nice long lasting off white head. Not quite as good looking as the dubbel. Nose is of bananas, dark fruits, and belgian yeast. Taste is perfect for the style, of dark fruits, candied sugar, chocolate malts, and balanced perfectly by a dry hop. Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated, and perfectly smooth! Drinkability is perfect! The alcohol is perfectly masked. This is a great abbey ale that I will definitely treat myself to in the future! I look forward to the anniversary edition i have sitting on the sidelines!"
"Slightly expensive. I think I paid about $16 for a four pack."
"D: Very complex and satisfying. This is a very good beer worthy of its high marks. Good drinkability."
"This is an outstanding abbey ale, and a beer to really take your time and savor. I paired this with a baked ziti made w/sausage, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese, and it really stood up well to it. Love this beer."
"Pours a dark reddish amber hue with orange highlights. The beer is pretty cclear and filled with an endless flow of rising bubbles like a jacuzzi, some sediment floating. The crown is soft and thick. The crown sustains a presence throughout the entire drinking and laces the side of the glass in parts. The aroma starts with a thick bready, yeast-like smell, followed by softer fruity notes banana, cherry, and grape juice, some tart citrus. Its hard for me to describe the taste. It's complex, malty with fruity notes, some cherry, grape juice, raisins, and a definite noticeable trace of alcohol. Mouthfeel is great, the beer spreads nicely over the tongue and just melts into my tastebuds. This is a delicious beer that I'd definitely try again. You really start to feel the alcohol about halfway through the beer. I'm smiling just looking at the monk on the bottle, I want another."
"Good beer, but not in my top 100, not from this tasting anyway, I have one more bottle, i'll allow it to age for a few years and re-visit in 2010, if I can store it that long."
"D- This beer is stellar. A great treat, and a great sipper. I feel like this is a brew a lot of non-beer drinkers could appreciate."
"Not a whole lot to say other than what's already been, great opportunity to have this awesome brew on tap at Max and Joe's tavern in Omaha. Russet brown, minor burgundy highlights. Aroma is all sweet malt, maybe baker's chocolate. The flavor is sweet, powerful malt, notes of cherry, dried grape, possibly currant..dark fruits ester goodness. Big mouth presence, absolutely perfect body, carbonation is just right. The drinkability rating should probably be knocked down just because the warming 10+% does catch up with you, but it's such a small part of the flavor that I can't find it in me drop it more than a half point off perfection. Pick of the litter."
"Pours a semi-opaque, dark brown with a good two or three fingers of foamy head that quickly recedes to a thin covering and leaves plenty of lacing. Apple and pear aromas almost, but not quite, mask the alcohol smell and also come through nicely on the flavour. Medium-bodied, and fairly powerful, but altogether very balanced - every nuance works well together rather than one screaming for attention like with certain big Belgian-style beers. Highly drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol - unless someone else had been taking sips from my bottle, I was very surprised when it was all gone!"
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable for something over 10%. What's interesting is that the alcohol is very present in both the nose and the mouth, yet it doesn't hinder drinkability in the least."
"On second though, no I don't. This beer is too good to waste."
"Poured into a Brandy snifter. The head was soapy and off-white and didn't have a long life. The color is a dark brown. Spotty traces of lacing are present. Very complex aroma with all sorts of stuff going on there including, hints of raisins, very sweet malts, hops, figs,and prunes. Evenly carbonated fizzy mouthfeel thats balanced with hops,bitterness, and malt. Alcohol is not well-hidden and easily noticed. Very sweet with a dry lingering bitterness. Full-bodied with a creamy texture. I'm going to let the rest warm up to room temperature see if any new flavors show themselves. As it warms I notice a strong Alcohol aroma and more Phenolic notes appear. The warmer it gets the more of the ABV is noticed and is really strong on the taste. All carbonation is gone and gives it the look of basically Brandy. Overall really good. It is worth trying again, but is not very drinkable due to the high ABV. I think one of these will be just fine for any session. Thanks Mitch for the fine offering."
"This beer is best if you have several hours to devote to it. Attractive, exquisit, with unmatched depth willing to bring you lot's of pleasure; but also high maintenance."
"poured a thin but creamy head with nice lacing. Dark brown with tan head. smell is exceptional,sweet dark ripe fruits with some alcohol. First taste was everything I love about Belgians, Full, fruity, raisins and plums, slight alcohol burn. Delicious! One of the best I've Quads I've tried."
"I have to compare later to a large, corked bottle, and with less yeasts, but this is a very, very nice beer that deserves multiple repeats, although one at a time."
"A wonderful beer that remains in my top ten and an excellent example of what those Belgian monks are capable of."
"25 .oz bomber poured into my Rapscallion snifter with Public Image LTD on the Hi-Fi . Beautiful silk screened bottle with Capt. Stubing in a monk outfit on the label . Healthy pop as I open the brew . Followed by gunsmoke leaving the bottle as i poured the fluid in a glass . 2 finger head with a bready , scone like smell . Head has large bubles and is off white in color . Body of brew is black as a hockey puck . When held up to the light there is some red hues through the bottom of the snifter . Bready , malty flavor . Worth waiting . After a few gulps nice lacing on glass . One of me favs ..."
"A revisit is pending for this one... knowing full well that this has been a favorite of mine for years."
"Slightly chunky yeast makes the chestnut body opaque. Head is fairly dense layer of fine bubbled foam atop a layer of coarser bubbles which gradually bleed through. Aroma is dominated by nice fruity esters like cherry and plums. Slightly herbal note as well that's accented by a hint of alcohol sweetness. Flavor is a bit warm with alcohol, then allows some great malt sweetness to come through. Loads of chewy fruit flavors appear, and then a solid bitterness that seems to come from alcohol as much as it does hops. Slightly astringent as well. Mouthfeel has a nice moderate body with nice, lively carbonation. Sweetness builds as I continue to enjoy this beer. Drinkability is nice for this strength of a beer."
"I had this on-tap at Landmark 1850 in Milwaukee, served in a tulip glass several degrees too cold."
"Drinks too easy. I believe this would shine with beef or Christmas pudding. At $3 for a 300ml bottle, a steal!"
"i really liked the special edition of this brew, so i was very excited to pop this corked wonder, the original version. poured a dark mahogany with a huge tan head that sinks into a big-bubbled cake of clumpiness. as soon as my nose neared the rim of the glass, i immediately picked up a stong, nutty breadiness, mixed with carmalized bananas, prunes, port, and i'd almost want to say a certain clove-like spice quality. the taste is on par with the smell, if not a bit sweeter - starts quite fruity and fades into a gigantic and complex malt profile. finish is a sort of cascade (not the hop!) from savory malts to a nice, drying bitterness from the classic belgian hops. wonderful, medium to full body coats the mouth during the sip and accentuates the swallow as the mouth is given a kind of slow-draining feel. the carbonation, quite high and small-bubbled, hightens this draining/drying character, perhaps a bit too well, slightly burning the tongue and cheeks. overall, very very nice, much more rounded than its special edition brethren, however, as i look back, i may have liked the latter more, even though my reviews speak otherwise. there was something about it... maybe because it was my first real belgian quad... who knows."
"No question that this is one of a kind and an exemplary specimen of its style. No beer geek should die before having one of these."
"Overall, Abt 12 lived up to my expectations. All that really matter is that it is good. Very good."
"d - gives off a very warming and pleasant sensation. the alcohol is evident but i am a fan of that in a lot of ways. this is a nice slow sipper, one you can enjoy over an hour or so."
"D: Definitely not a session beer. A beer to savor and enjoy once in awhile to remind you why beer is made!"
"The first pour into my 25 cL Chimay goblet raises a thin but fairly solid head, the color of heavily creamed coffee. The body color is a deep brown, tinged with garnet. The lacing is sticky enough to fall slowly in one thick curtain before leaving a line of bubbles on the glass. The aroma is quite typical for a dark, hefty Belgian ale: sweet, with dark fruits, but also hints of cocoa, and to a lesser extent, pipe tobacco. The taste is rich in maltiness and cocoa, but not as sweet as the nose might have indicated. The cocoa bits remind me of just the hints one can pick up in mole, but somewhat more intense. I love chocolate, and love finding it when I've given it up for Lent. There's a nice, strong cherry flavor that really comes through as it warms. Still, the flavor does not seem to be complex, just satisfying. It is clever for hiding its alcohol, though. The mouth is quite heavy, with just enough subtle carbonation to lift the beer partially from the palette. I'm glad I finally sat down and reviewed this after a few previous tries, since I appreciate it even more now."
"Quality stuff."
"D: This is not a session beer. This is a beer I have once in a while to appreciate its goodness. I love this beer."
"Purchased a 1pt 9.4oz cork sealed bottle. Pours into my globe glass nice cloudy brown color with a thick creamy head. Smells faintly sour, but tastes wonderful. The alchohol is not noticeable. The first beer i've had of this style, if this is any indication, it definitely wont be the last. Highly recommended."
"The drinkability is high, the beer is very good indeed. Prosit, MK"
"Slender 33 cL bottle, best by 8/26/2010 - served in a tulip. It pours a dark, sedimented rusty brown with some floaties and medium carbonation leading up to a three finger, fluffy, light tan head. Initially I smell red wine, but it quickly evolves, with notes of apples, pear, coffeecake, and spiced rum, with doughy and almost oaky notes; very nice, but it is not quite as aromatic as I'd like. It is insanely complex on the palate, with cherry, red wine, rum, chocolate, molasses?, carob, caramel, apple, pear, melon rind?, banana?, orange?, currant, blackberry, anise (and maybe other spices). In addition, there are green/leafy, almost piney hops, a mild to medium bitterness, yeast, and an alcohol kick. The medium body is quite carbonated, lightly numbing and drying, with a medium to long finish. Overall a very complex and warming ale with a bit too much yeast due to insufficient decanting, but one well worth sampling again and again"
"With just a decent pour I got an amazing half beer, half head effect. Body is deep brownish black with only hints of light around the edges. Head is a nice staying tan, leaving slight lace as it fades. Nose is a vibrant sense awakening, fruity and floral while being strong and spicey bold. Amazingly silky as it first hits the tongue. Vanilla honey like smooth up front on the tongue with developing spicey wheat notes as the palate lengthens. The finish is a little darker and less balanced then the body pre-emps to. Alchol is well hidden but does warm the belly well. Avery classic brew."
"This gives off aromas of molasses and slight floral fragrances. The taste is astounding. It has a maple and bubble gum characteristic and feels slightly acidy, but not over powering."
"Overall, one of my favorites. I'm pretty new the the whole ""beer connisuer"" thing(sorry if misspelled), but hopefully it will remain toward the top of my list."
"Taste is just as gorgeous as the nose, extremely rich and very sippable. The fruit is complimented by all that bready yeast and one can only describe this as drinking liquid dessert, but a dessert that is never too sweet. There is a definite light tartness in the finish to balance things off. Caramel, spices, raisins and other dried fruits all appear, and as this one warms the complexity just grows. This is a superb brew that demands respect in every sip, and I give it that. Thick with malt in the mouth with a carbonation that rather seizes the tongue. This one is extremely sippable, but not chuggable that's forsure. Warms your core on a cold night. Exceptional brew that would only get better if I had one more to cellar."
"Although quadrupel is not my favorite Belgian style this one is solid. It's like a really good vanilla ice-cream; it may not wow you yet you love it."
"D: Overall it didn't quite live up to the hype for me but still quite a good beer, I'm willing to give it another go. But don't be put off it is definitely very tasty I just wish there wasnt such a strong alcoholic presence."
"Overall. If you have never had a quad, this is the one to try."
"Wow. Had this beer many times in all its incarnations and always really enjoyed it. But until reviewing it, I hadn't given it much ""love"" in awhile. Man, this is a great beer. One of my absolute favs. How does it compare to Westy 12, well, I'll save that for another day"
"This beer is better than the Triple but not as good as the 8 in my opinion. The beer is a deep mahogany with a fair head. The smell is of prunes and cherries. The taste is a little sharp for me. There is a alcohol presence in the mouthfeel. The drinkanbility is fair, but not as good as the 8. I will re-try this one in the future but I think the 8 is the brewers best."
"It may be crass to compare, but I prefer Rochefort 10 and consider it more complex than this beer."
"If you're a fan of Belgian ales, as I am, you'll really dig this brew. Smooth at first, spicy on the finish, it's a winner. I'm certainly glad I have a big bottle to finish."
"Pours a dark rich amber with an off white head that lingers and clings to the side of the glass as the beer is consumed. It has hints of molasses and raisins and the smooth consistency is spiked with chunks of yeast. The aroma is a bold roasted malty sweetness that pleases without being overpowering. It is lightly carbonated giving it a crispness that dissipates after the beer settles giving the beer a smooth finish."
"Run, don't walk, to try this beer today."
"definiitely a top notch beer, the high alcohol content appears as it warms, but adds to the enjoyment of the taste"
"Drinkability: Delicious, complex and clean, Belgian, leaves you feeling like you had a complete meal. Would've been delicious with some smoked meats, lamb, brisket."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 pours a dark, opaque brown with an off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is fruity at first and bready toward the back. Brown sugar seems very noticeable at first. There is definitely some dark fruits and the alcohol gives a good kick at the end. An icon of the style and readily available, anyone wishing to learn about quads should sample this."
"I'd recommend it."
"Medium-bodied and slightly syrupy. Smooth drinking and something I'd like a lot of."
"I sip on this critter, but find my hand quickly returns for another. At $3.50 for the 33cl, not overpriced either."
"D: Great complexity and balance. The mouthfeel is near perfect, and it also speaks for the satisfying start to the smooth finish of this beer. Watch the well-masked abv, this stuff owns."
"D: Very tasty, goes down ridiculously easy which will make the ABV catch up to you in a hurry. This is a very good beer. At the time that I am writing this review, the beer is #15 on the Best of BA. Believe the hype."
"Pours a dark cherry, but with a minimal head, Smell is great, a combination of cherry, molasses and hops. Taste is not as great, but still way above average...cherreis, molasses and a wine-like quality are present. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet with a dry finish. Drinkabilty is likewise smooth, with a medium body."
"Very good feel to it, makes drinking it very easy. Perhaps a bit rich to power down two of these (bombers), but one is a treat."
"750 ml corked bottle. Pours dark, coffee brown with a lively, rocky tan head. Smell was a bit odd, maybe just this bottle b/c I got a whiff of vinegar at first. Dissipated quickly though, and the aroma was then black cherries and chocolate. Taste is chocolate, caramel, plums at first, then that sour black cherry at the back of the tongue. Finishes crisply with a toffee-like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, silky and downright wonderful. The drinkability is up in the dangerous range, as the 10% abv is hidden well. The silky mouthfeel and the crisp finish combine for a beer you could definitely drink a LOT of. This is just one fantastic beer. Hands down. Wow."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark brown with a thick creamy head. Has a big toasted, slightly yeasty clove smell. Definitely full-bodied, has a sweet, malty taste up front with mild carbonation that finishes with a long, sweet, alcoholic taste that seems to linger forever. You can really savor this beer, which is what you expect from such a great brewery and such a complex beer."
"Drinkability suffers only because of the high alcohol content."
"Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours dark brown with some tints of red and it has about an inch off-white head. Lacing is good. It smells mainly like dark fruit, with some sweet malt and a bit of spicyness. The taste is very sweet, just like it smells but with some brown sugar along with the malt and dark fruit. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is nice and full and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. It's nice and smooth, and very drinkable. The alcohol isn't as noticable as I thought it would be. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."
"There is a party in my mouth. This one has an expiration date 15 09 09, thus meaning she is a little more than 2 years old. Dark brown with a good creamy foam on top, the smell is so richfull, something toasted inside, I can't be more precise at the moment. Taste is even better, with gouda and ""salalme di milano"" as special guests at this party, where St Bernardus is the ceremony master and I am the main invitee. I don't want, I can't say nothing more at the moment, except this is one of the best beer experience I've ever been into in my whole life.."
"The Abt 12 exhibited the expected brownish-red hue and was one of the most carbonated beers I've ever encountered, even for a Belgian Quad. Appearance is perfect to style. The smell is inviting with sweet, roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste follows suit, but woa, there was a flavor explosion here I wasn't expecting. The dark fruits hinted at in the nose came to life, now accompanied by dark candi sugar. The complexity here is astounding; it's like a feast of sweet malt, fruit, and candy. Some might describe it as overly sweet. Mouthfeel is of course quite bubbly, but with a nice texture that prevents you from confusing this with a Coca-cola. As several other reviewers have pointed out, the alcohol is VERY well masked here, truly the touch of a master brewer. I could drink this all night on draft. One of the best beers in the world hands down."
"Poured into a Unibroue Chalice, a clear dark golden/amber color, nice carbonation, nice 1.5 finger creamy tan head which hangs around for quite sometime, tons of sticky lacing around with some foamy puddles. The nose is sweet malty, with nice scents of grapes, raisins, figs, and prunes. The taste is pretty carbonated, sweet/malty, slightly tart/tangy, nice dry finish. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, a nice complex brew. Very drinkable, a truly awesome beer. Glad it is more readily available, than say a Westy 12."
"Pours a murky brownish red with a rocky tan head. Smell of dark fruits - plums? Taste of exotic spice and candy sugar. I thought it was a tad on the sweet side, but it was still tasty. The alcohol is well hidden in this brew. Overall a pretty good brew but not extraordinary as I was expecting."
"I wish I could describe this beer better, I can't really identify all the different tastes and smells here, everything blends into the best beer I've had so far. Perfection of my favorite style."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Pabst goblet. Body is a hazy purplish ruby when held to the light. A thick, tanned head comes out from the pour and maintains a good 1/4"". Leaves thick and raised lacing. Smell is candy-sweet, fruity, spicy, and a bit alcoholic. Aromas are a bit too faint for a beer of this size, and the booze is too prominent. Flavor is very much like grape soda with some roasted malt. There is a slight estery and phenolic hit, but the sweetness runs this. Gets way too sweet as it warms. Mouthfeel is actually kind of thin and starts off rather prickly, but then subsides to a smoother carbonation. This is drinkable enough, but doesn't really do it for me. I think I just don't get what's so great about quadrupels."
"Drinkability, yes I could have one of these everyday."
"Poured a deep brown with a huge head and laced up the whole bottle. Smell was very complex. Malty, berry, fruity smell. A tiny bit of alcohol, very strong smell. Taste was the smae, Very very complex, every sip gave a different flavor it seemed, simply wonderful. Very drinkable too. This was my first try of this wonderful brew and I must say it completly lived up to the hype. This was really really wonderful to drink, and really seemed to get better each time I sipped!"
"this beer reminds me alot of it's big brother, westy 12, which i was fortunate enough to try recently. that bottle was about 4 years old, and this is only 1. some of the complexity of the westy is missing here, but i can see it developing with time. really great beer, and i'm wishihg i'd picked some of this up last year."
"One of the best I've ever had. In fact, I really can't think of a beer that I've enjoyed more. Just the epitome of what I think of when I rave about Belgian ales. Top of the line."
"Rich but not astoundingly complex."
"Awesome."
"A nice presentation, with a deep dark brown color and a thick tan fluffy head, which left little lacing. A nose of sweet malt, mainly fruity and alcohol notes, some hints of caramel and roasted barley. Its a sweet, malty pronounced brew with the alcohol leading in heavily when displaced onto the palate. It has a medium to light feel, with crispiness in the front. The qualities of this brew improve greatly as it warms up. I wasnt very impressed when it was cold, but is slowly became more enjoyable."
"Nicely balanced beer. Nothing extraordinary, but certainly quite drinkable."
"Nice, pleasant, warming, and good Belgian yeast characteristics: an excellent beer, and one I'll continue to drink regularly (as regularly as I can get my hands on it, that is.) But BA's highest rated quad, and the 14th overall beer on the site? I don't really see it."
"Pours with a huge off white, frothy, head. Clings the the sides. Very murky, muddy brown color. Completely opaque. Very strong alcoholic nose. Notes of oatmeal raisin cookies. Sweet. Alcohol is upfont in the flavor profile. Some sweetness, and a mash of toffee and fruit. Very easy drinking palate. Soft texture all the way through. Velvet. This particualr bottle is very young. I beleive the date is 030310. Im sure it ages very well, but as rated today, not one of my faves."
"Verdict: awesome. I noticed the alcohol a bit more than in some, but the flavors were great and right on par. A staple quadrupel to be revisited, but I don't think I will be filling my fridge up with them anytime soon."
"D - great tasting beer with lots of classic Belgian flavors."
"Final Notes: I can feel Abt 12 work its alcoholic magic on me. So rich, so thick. My stomach hurts with joy. I wonder if the anniversary brew is worth trying?"
"Cheers!"
"I used a large wine glass for this, and it displayed the beer really well. Great head retention, dark amber in color. Strong, fruity, yeasty nose. Malts are prominent in the taste; slightly sweet and fruity with a dry red wine finish. Thick and chewy in the mouth, very effervescent. Rich and filling stuff. An impressive beer."
"Having sampled it along side the Rochefort 10, and Westy 12, I actually liked the Rochefort best. To me, the Rochefort seemed to have a little more depth and richness than the Westy and St. Bernardus."
"Drinkability: This Quad is super drinkable. Exellent flavors and strength."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Color is a dark and murky mahogany brown. Very little light escapes around the edges when held to the light. Head starts about a finger's width and maintains a tight lace. A half-dollar sized cap of foam floats in the center. Smell is slightly spicy, with some toffee notes. Taste is fantastic. Warm toffee flavor that finishes with a coffee bitterness. Slight dried fruit notes. Mouthfeel is lighter than what I expected, though completely satisfying. Mild alcohol warmth. An absolutely wonderful beer. One is enough for the night."
"If, as Ben Franklin claimed, beer was proof that God loves us and wants to be happy, than this is him showing us how good beer can be. Here's to hoping for a long happy life of preaching to the monk on the label!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, excellent lingering of flavors in the mouth. A pleasant warming develops on subsequent pours into the goblet. Insanely drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good but not sure if I could have more than one bottle in a sitting - rated the beer on one bottle per session."
"Dark brown Quadrupel, no highlights, opaque--light brown matching head. Raisins and dark cherry under the considerable malty sweetnessness. Oily. Caramelt malt in nose, but not much else. Hard to smell, but the DIPA I had before this may have blew out my smeller. Big malt and spice in the taste. Very good, but I'll stick with La Trappe."
"I'm a bit dissapointed with the lack of hop character but overall very pleased. The acidity is a bit much for me and it finishes like a Merlot. I'll see what the second year of rest does."
"Fruity bready nose comes through in the flavor as well. May have been some choco bits in there. Tingly carbonation, but smooth and creamy on the mouth. Slight warmth comes through and the ETOH becomes more pronounced as it warms. Way too drinkable for a quad."
"D - A very good quad. The flavors are amazing."
"Drinkability is good, enjoyable flavors but not a sub for Westy 12 as some claim. Might have rated this one higher but hard to do after having the best. Maybe the 60th Anniv will be better."
"A very soft, complex, delicious ale. Let it warm up to get the best experience. I feel like I need another glass to fully grasp this beer, but unfortunately, I'm fresh out. Perhaps a side-by-side with the 60th anniversary soon? Very soon I think."
"Delightfully a delicious, non confrontational/friendly beer. I want another."
"Overall I think this is my secnd or third favorite quad to date, and more readily available than some of teh others that i like."
" Drinkability- Pure taste that didn't let me down. Great Brew overall."
"This is a beer, friends. Cheers."
"Don't love it, though."
"Drinkablity is good for the style."
"This can be a tough beer to be drinkable. It's very strong in liquor and sweetness. For its strength I consider it quite drinkable. There are no negative flavors, bitterness, or harshness. It should also be mentioned that the more you drink of it, the better it gets."
"Thought it was full-bodied and somewhat silky on the tongue, but the drinkability was awful. I could not finish it. I enjoyed Rochefort 10 much more than this beer."
"Pours a deep brown mahogany color with a tall pillowy tan head that dissipates in chunks leaving a rocky lace behind. A yeasty mustiness is present in the nose along with a bit of banana and clove and a hint of vanilla. Taste begins with a brown sugar sweetness and toffee-like malt along with mildly spicy clove followed by some notes of juicy dark plums and cherries. Finish is like chocolate covered rum-soaked raisins. Simply deliciousa marvelous beer."
"Drinkability: A nice warming beer, as close to wine as any beer I have had. Stands up well to the hype. I doubt that this is a beer I would have often, but if it was available to me it would be nice to have once in a while, just to truely enjoy a good beer."
"However, in the taste, the alcohol is barely noticable. Tons of sweet (but not too sweet maltmake up the start of the taste, followed by the dark fruit taste that you hope for in a good Belgian. Then the alcohol comes through as a bit of tartness at the end. Nice and complex. Some people say this is better than Westvleteren. I don't agree. It's damn good in its own right, but they're totally different beers. Mouthfeel is charged with CO2, not as creamy as some Belgians. Drinkability suffers a tad bit because of the intense carbonation, but is still well above average."
"In case you wondered ( and you probably didn't) This beer came from a St. Bernardus gift box which included four beers and a glass. Label code/date: 280710"
"Drinkability: There are more drinkable quads out there, and I probably won't have this one again. But given a choice between this and 99% of other beers in the world... I'll take this."
"D - Smooth and a great beer that is easily drank and enjoyed"
"Wow, This is an awesome beer. I tried it on recomendation of a bartender and she brought me this, it is so tasty. Reminded me a little of Newcastle in apperance and mouthfeel. It was a very heavy beer so after two I felt like I had just had a large meal. But without a doubt St. Bernardus is for sure on my top five list"
"Everyone enjoy!"
"D: This is a very quaffable Belgian. Extremely smooth for such a stong beer. Sweet all the way down. Very nice."
"Tasts just the same, very sweet with massive fruit notes and juicy mouthfeel. Definitely a sipping brew. Alcohol warms quite a bit. Wish I had a fire going and some nice cheese."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-yes"
"a damn good quad. if i were to change one thing it needs just a little more muscle, as in it might be just a touch too subtle."
"Remember that scene in ""Young Frankenstein"" where the monster is grasping for the notes of the violin? That's what I felt like as I was drinking this toward the end - Grasping for something beautiful that I could not comprehend. A lovely experience that I look forward to repeating."
"Mouthfeel is excellent and the nice finish left me clucking my tongue to get avery last bit of flavor. This really is an excellent brew, and the big alcohol warmth is a pleasant quality...like drinking brandy from a snifter. One of my all time favorites so far."
"D: One of the best quads I've had. I would definately buy this again when I see it--possibly to cellar a few. One tasty brew."
"This is an extremely high quality brew from St. Bernardus. Definitely my favorite of their year-round brews. The flavors are fantastically pronounced and work to complement eachother. This is a MUST have beer."
"Poured into my chimay goblet. A robust, musty, chocolately, dark brown color. Great pillowy off white head with good carbonation and great retention, thats already leaving lacing. Smells of malt, some fruit (cherries, apples), toffee, even wine like aromas. Taste is robust and complex. Begins with some hops and malt onto a slight bitterness, finishes with notes of apples and a welcome alcohol warmth. This is a delicious beer, I could drink these endlessly if one didn't already make me feel it's strength. This is an amazing beer I will definitely buy more. Really I can't say enough about this beer. Thank you st. Bernardus..."
"Served in a chalice from a 11.2 oz bottle (28/02/11). Says 10.0% alcohol. Dark brown ale and quite murky, large tan, tight bubbly head. Good carbonation, livelly. Very dark fruity/malty aromas, very toffeeish, hints of black cherry and candied apples. Mmm dark malty taste, raw demerara sugar, trecle and toffee,semi bitter plum/ sultanas and spiced undertones, slight hint of sherry like alcohol. Very nice and smooth on the palate with a lingering pleasant bitterness and some tummy warming alcohol to finish. Overall a very nice beer, well worth its place."
"What a nice beer! I need more of these, and others by this brewery. Nice brown color with a thick tan head that quickly dissipates. It had a yeasty aroma, with plenty of dark fruits. A complex taste. It had a strong malt presence, but the dark fruit came through, as well as a nice caramel flavor. It was pleasantly carbonated. It had a nice mouthfeel, and was quite drinkable. This is a beer to sip and savor."
"Drinkability: Definitely something to savor slowly and respect. Very drinkable; not at all chuggable. I can't say for sure, but this would probably be a very versatile beer for food pairing; I can imagine it working well with both cheesecake and beef tenderloin."
"Dark brow with ruby-red highlights body and a light tan head. Smells great - malty and somewhat earthy. Head is a few inches thick, and one has to wait for it to dissipate before filling the glass more or drinking. Tastes sweet, somewhat dark fruity. Good level of carbonation but not overly so like some Belgian style ales. Very very very well balanced. You can hardly tell that this is 10.5% alcohol. Whats more, this is one of the most drinkable abbey ales Ive ever had. Im very very impressed. By far one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D- This is a great beer, only thing that could have made it better would be to take the alcohol edge off a bit. One bottle is enough for 1 sitting, that's for sure."
"D: I could drink this again, easy on the mouth and bliss to taste...."
"Very warm and thick, and smooth as silk. 10.5% ABV, but I don't care, the bottle's already almost half-gone by the end of this review.. This thing is delicious. Two thumbs up, would recommend to anyone, etc. Try this beer."
"I was looking forward to opening this one. This beer pours a very dark mahogony with a giant foamy head. The color is so dark I had to hold it up to a light and saw alot of debris floating around,so pour carefully people. The smell is extremely pungent, as soon as the cap was off the aroma filled the room. Dark fruit, brown sugar, nuts, and alittle chocolate. The taste is much like the smell. Full of dark fruit, raisins, prunes, alcohol, a nutty chewiness, and a rich ""bisquity"" flavor. The m/f is medium with a rich creaminess that hides the alcohol and mellows the dark fruit. An absolute classic that everyone should try. Cheers."
"This beer is amazing."
"Drinkability: High! I wish I hadn't split this 750 ml bottle four-ways, and saved it all for me instead. Goes down very easy for 10% abv. Drank this while brewing - next time I'll try it when I'm not so busy and enjoy it a bit more."
"I reviewed this beer a few months back from a bomber and this one from the 12oz. bottle seems much better. Perhaps it may be aged a bit, I dont know, nor do I care. This is near perfection."
"Poured in an appropriate chalice a dark brown color. The nose is a nice coffee aroma and slight sweet floral notes. The first sip offers a mouthful of flavors. Raisons, coffee, molasses, oranges, oak soaked aging. You immediately know this is a great beer. A one finger head reduces to a thin layer of fine, white bubbles. Medium body with a fantastic creamy mouth feel. Very mellow and smooth drinking, perfectly balanced and excellent melding of all characteristics. Hints of bananas towards the end. Finishes very well and I just couldnt resist finishing a couple more!"
"The finish is long, and it's a couple of minutes before I really pick up some delicate hop flavours."
"D - yes yes yes. give me more! Everything about this one is a winner."
"Notes: A classic, no doubt about it."
"drinkability: very good"
"Eric"
"Overall, I'm very pleased with it, and quite glad that I chose to revisit it. I think it's also important to note that the example I had this evening had a bit of age on it. I have had it in the cellar for at least 6 months, and there's no telling how long the guy from whom I got it had had it, as well. Perhaps a bit of time tucked away does St. B12 some good for those who don't normally care for quads."
"Excellent for sipping slowly so that you can appreciate the changes as it comes to room temperature. Will definitely partake of this one again."
"Great beer that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though Quads aren't one of my favorite styles. Personally, I enjoyed Rochefort 10 a bit more, but this is solid in its own right."
"Rich round mouthfeel that begs to be chewed. A succulent blend of cherries, chocolate and mellow notes of alcohol combine into a rich drinking experience. Far superior to the 11.2 oz bottle, the 750 mL bottle is smooth and supple with layers of depth. This only gets better as it warms, displaying more of its fruit characteristics. Highly drinkable and worth seeking out."
"alright, after .92 years on BA, i can have an opinion on the debate of which is the top quad. the answer is, whichever one is in my chalice. seriously, it's hard to pick one over the other, that's probably why their overall scores are so close. enough about that though, about the taste of this beer, this one is a party in my mouth. tasty, complex, full-bodied, smooth, big boozy and fruity, bitter finish. it doesn't really taste like a 10% abv, but i am feeling the effects after nearly finishing the bottle. it's not the kind of beer that makes me want another right away, and as i sometimes interpret drinkability as the desire to drink more, the grade suffers a bit. i couldn't handle another one of these right now. but i will get it again some day, and i recommend it to anyone who likes belgian beers or wants to try something new and different. yum."
"color is cloudy and dark with spots of sediment, nose of sweet maple syrup raw bread, sweet initial taster, creamy and medium bodied, port wine taste ,acidic aftertaste color is cloudy and dark with spots of sediment, nose of sweet maple syrup raw bread, sweet initial taster, creamy and medium bodied, port wine taste ,acidic aftertaste"
"Definitely one of my favorites, it has never let me down. I have a 60th anniversary I am saving for a while. Can't wait to give it a try."
"I liked the tangy sweet malt taste as well as the robust character of the ale and thought it would probably go well with roast beef heros."
"Drinkability: Unbelievable, I love this type of beer and it is perfect for me. Someone that doesnt like this beer my shy away from the high alcohol but it is well masked (assumed with aging)."
"Poured into a Stone Barley wine glass, appearance is impressive with a nice brownish red color with a impressive two finger head that leaves superb heavy lacing on glass, one of the best looking drinks I have ever seen. Smell is of fresh ripe apples, with hints of sweet raisons and other fruits come to mind, the smell is really amazing, very fresh. Taste is very good like sweet candy on the palate, I can taste fruit and some slight bitterness followed by a nice tart taste that goes down really smooth, the alcohol content is really masked behind the great flavor. This is a top notch quality product very good indeed and I can't believe the flavor, it goes down really smooth which can be a bad thing since there is a high abv to it."
"Pours dark plum, leathery consisantcy with light off-white head. The head is rather foamy when looking at the glass from the side. The top, however, is deceivingly thick looking. Underneath the initial 1/18"" of dense head is a semi-large diameter bubbly-like honeycomb which supports the thick top layer. At first note smells of fig, plum, banana crème pie, and a hint of vanilla are noteded. Very complex, however the taste is within to the realm of the above smells. Again, quite complex. Belgian lace subsides quickly. Great beer - Among the best -"
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, dense off white head as you would expect which sticks around for a bit on top of thick dark brown body. The aroma shoots out of the glass and stuns your senses as your nose approaches the glass for a whiff. Lots of prunes, and sour yeast with a tad bit of alcohol to it. The taste contains lots of dark malts and fruit. A small amount of chocolate in the finish was detectable with the grape fruit and alcohol, which is slightly present."
"This is very drinkable considering the ABV. It's certainly a fine brew and I can see why it gets a lot of praise."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Drinkability is above average considering the nice alcohol burn."
"Let this warm up to almost room temp. and poured into a chalice. This beer is a deep brown with a ruby hue, nice big tan head that leaves nice lace on the glass. The aromas from the beer are outstanding, caramel, fruit, a hint of alcohol, raisins, grain, mossy earth, wow. The flavors are equally interesting with a huge caramel flavor coupled with some pleasant spice and dried fruit flavors, rock candy. The alcohol warms the belly and cheeks, but is really well hidden among the big flavors. Finishes fairly dry with a little alcohol flavor. The mouthfeel is great, really silky and smooth with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Overall an outstanding beer, with all of the flavors and aromas coming together to make a supremely drinkable quad."
"An exceptional beer that lived up to the hype."
"This is one of my first introductions to this type of beer and right off the bat it was immensely enjoyable. Definitely a very good beer and I will be drinking this one again."
"Nice muted fig color with a deep brown glow. Head is very thick and bubbly, yet without much protein. Delicate lacing up and down, head subsiding to a thick film. Smell is big on medium body savory malts, perfectly balanced fruit notes ranging from cherry and plum to apple, and a nice earthy sweetness. Yeast and phenol are definitelly in there, but it took me a good couple minutes to find them. Spices range from orange to clove. The alcohol definitely compliments the aroma, rather than overpowering it. There are so many layers in the smell alone, I spent a good five minutes just with my nose stuck in the snifter, inhaling deeply and finding something new each time. Taste is held together with a great deep malt backbone, supporting a rich brown sweetness, with a bigger emphasis on spice than on fruitiness. There are definite figgy hints, but more so are the savory spices. Peppercorn, mustard and other unidentifiable tastes glaze over a nice meaty center. The taste is not quite as layered and complex as the smell, but even falling short of that leaves it above most anything I've had. Mouthfeel is great, with an initial bite of carbonation that follows halfway back the tongue, then suddenly drops away for a smooth silky back. This is a real adventure to drink, going down smooth and easy, with so much to offer on the way. I only wish there was a category for 'smellability' because this beer would take my gold for that. [Also, looking forward to picking up a growler of this on tap for my brother's birthday (a great present that gives right back!)]"
"I will definately pick up a couple of the 750ml bottles to try at home. And as I said, I have to go back to the bar to enjoy this again. Maybe I should take my time drinking the next one."
"Mouth: Enters biscuity and yeasty, spicy and sweet, grape flavors, creamy clove and possibly chocolate, fruity esters. The mouthfeel is a bit disappointing, tingly upon entering then thick and creamy at the end, retaining a bit too much gas, making the swallow a bit hard. Hops don't add much flavor here but serve to keep the malts in order."
"Poured a deep, hazy brown similar to that of an apple cider into a wine glass. Head is a khaki tan that fades to a moderate sticky ring of lacing along with a light coating on the top. Aroma is fruity, mostly ripe, dark fruit paired with a caramel sweetness with some earthier undertones, some spice notes, warm sugary alcohols finish out the nose. Taste is sweet, candied dry fruit, caramel, malt, light alcohol notes and a similar earthiness of the nose present as well. Sweetness increases as it warms, fruitier profile emerges as well, taste some cinnamon/nutmeg like spiciness as the fruits fade off the tongue. Light sweet and dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very low carbonation, slides down the throat. Drinkability is high, given the intriguing complexity and character of this Quad, hardly hints at it's nearly 11% abv. Overall an impressive beer I'd recommend to try at least once, a rewarding experience. Will likely purchase again."
"When deciding which beer I would choose to be my first review, I finally chose this to be the one... and I am confident in my selection. Enjoying this beer begins with the aroma of apples and a hint of other fruits complimented by the dark auburn appearance with a large frothy head. The taste and finish completely mask the alcohol. A sweet, fruity taste with a very crisp and pure mouthfeel make this an exceptional treat that I highly recommend."
"This is certainly not in my Top 100 beers, but for folks who dig dubbels, I would recommend this, maybe even highly."
"A beautiful dark dubbel, that tastes like a quad. I swear if this beer was aged, it would turn into Westy12. Nice, dark look with a sweet belge glaze. Smells nutty and musty. Taste is incredible, by far my favorite dubbel. Mothfeel is lively and effervescent. Drinkability: I could session this beer at 10% in alchol all day and have no worries. It's that damn good! Can't wait for the 60th anniversary!"
"What a friendly little monk on my bottle of beer. I had no idea I was about to be in for such a treat. I popped the cork like it was a champagne bottle, not hollywood style, but slowly, so as to let out a small slow hiss. This poured true, not like some other high ABV malt monsters that run thick or syrupy. There was a nice foamy white head that brought a little hop oil to the surface for me to breathe in, as well as some yeast to look at. It is a rare beer that can whollop you with flavor without killing you with its alcohol an dpotential heavyness, but this pulled off that feat. It has tremendous layers for you to go through and enjoy from toffee through stone fruit flavors, with some vanilla rounding off the edge. Much like the pour, it drank clean. I could have a few of these in one sitting, but I don't reccomend lightweights trying that. An instant classic for me."
"There was something lacking on this one, it seemed a bit ""dead"" for lack of a better term. Perhaps the 750's are better."
"Drinkability- Probably my top ranked Quad. Was very nice to the tastebuds. What I wouldn't fo for a beer like this on cask. Or at least on tap. Have past it up at the Toronado many times because I knew I had a few bottles at home I was waiting to try. Quality beer for sure. Glad I have a few more smaller bottles to save for later on. Nice to know it can be aged for 15 years according to the script on the back of the bottle. Recommended."
"*With a little more aging the beer developes a much more nutty taste to it."
"While the taste was warm and clean and sweet and the color was beautiful, the sediment in the bottom of the glass threw me off. I can understand why it is so high on the BA list. Although I thought it was nice , I thought the Brasserie du Rocs was a better all around beer. This is a first review for me and looking at all the great reviews I appologize for not knowing all about what flavors I am tasting and smelling."
"This beer fell slightly short of my high expectations, based on the Trappiste quads. I'm going to review again with an aged beer a fresh open mind."
"This poured a deep amber color with a thick persistent head. The smell is a bit sweet with a nice touch of hops. The taste is incredibly well balanced and a great example of a Belgian beer. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a slight orange like aftertaste that comes through after swallowed. As far as drinkability goes, this should be savored as often as possible!"
"There are so many flavors in this brew it is unreal. Bananas, cardimon, cinamon, dry ripened plums, maybe some cherries. An outstanding beer. Only problem with this one is, it has a very whiskey booziness that is noticeable. I also believe this drinks more like a belgian strong dark than a quad. Other than that, an outstanding brew. Nice lacing down the tulip. Can't drink too many, may put someone into an eternal sleep. Highly recommeded."
"Notes: Not a huge fan of big Belgian beers (Belgian strong dark, dubbels, trippels, quads, etc.) but this is amazing. Will never be a nightly drink for me, but I could drink this every now and then for a special treat."
"Finish is tangy/sweet. I keep coming back to brown sugar."
"One of the greatest of the quadrupels."
""
"picked up a 750ml after a recent visit to a belgian beer bar (sharp edge beer emporium in pittsburgh) and subsequent love affair with belgian beer. nice dark appearance and deep, dark aroma. taste was outstanding. very complex and rewarding. nicely texture, not too thick, but plenty of body. only reason i wouldn't give it higher drinkability was it's weight and high ABV. one of these days i'll get my hands on a westy, but in the meantime, i'll take this again and again."
"poured a nice dark brown cloudy body with a big creamy tan head that had decent retention. Nice lacing left all around the tulip glass it was poured in. Strong scent of dark fruit and bread along with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is sugary sweet dark fruit with a good dose of warming alcohol. As it warms, more fruit taste and a slightly bitter, bready yeastiness comes through. It mixes well to smooth out the taste of the 10.5% alcohol. Rich and complex but perfectly balanced. An excellent beer that I will definitely go out of my way to drink again."
"Overall, this is a glorious beer. I cant wait to taste it again over time to see how it ages."
"Drinkability is excellent- the flavors are so intriguing that you want to keep downing these just to taste more nuances in the beer. Absolutely spectacular!"
"Easily one of the best beer experiences I've had. The complexity and clearity of the taste is rather exceptional IMHO."
"Drinkability - this is good, and goes down well. However, the high abv would limit this to one 750 ml. serving per session."
"Belgian Strong Dark Ale - Aroma 10; Appearance 3; Flavor 18; Mouthfeel 5; Overall Impression 9 (45/50)."
"This has been in the box for at least an eon if not more. It is Independence Day. It is time for this one. The pour reveals a shade of amber that leans heavily toward purple, or garnet, or red. Quite a peach to look at really. A wonderfully appetizing head rolls up and holds as a slender slab of creamy froth. Most delicious. Fluffy whips of lace cling heavily and create a rolling topography around the outskirts of this event. A few drips of yeast have peppered a tight pattern in the midground of this head. It looks like a bit of nutmeg sprinkled atop a fine dessert. The nose is complex in dark fruit subtleties. It smells like a bit of fermented black cherry. A sort of sugar crusted candy sweetness booms within the honed confines of this brew as the malt structure is notably solid. I think the yeast has contributed heavily to the delight I derive from repeated and incessant sniffing. The smell is so much different. Wild and tart with an expressive gale of alcohol. The taste is darkly fruity, alcoholic and rootish. The black fruitiness and alcoholic characters lay on the back of a creamy mouthfeel. Unique and delicious. The drinkability is super good. The only problem is it ends up gone. The last few sips are a spectacle. This song has ended on a solid note. I can tell this one is from somewhere else. It is completely unlike..."
"Full body, not oily, but definitely something that coats your mouth and your throat as it goes down. Carbonation is perfect and this is super smooth and easy-drinking. The 10.5% is un-noticable. World class, and definitely lives up to the hype."
"This beer has been reviewed so many times - I just want to say what impressed me the most - the spices and fruitiness was very creamy - some of the wonderful tastes were almost lost in the creaminess. It was a wonderful sipping beer - The alcohol warmed the body at the end - This was a great beer - similar to the trappist ales - but creamier, and with a little bite at the end. I don't know - IMO - that it was an all ""5" beer - but, very close - if 4.75's could be given - I would have given it that. It was truly a pleasure."
"If you can get these at a decent price, snap them up."
"This is an amazingly complex beer. With each sip I tasted an array of new flavors. An outstanding quad rivaled by few."
"It's a bit heavy, more of a fall/winter beer in my eyes. Would be perfect with a sweater. Overall fantastic beer will have again especially when I can find it on tap."
"I wouldn't have this on tap ever again unless I saw them tap the keg myself."
"Thank you very much babydoc for this great surprise. I am in you debt."
"Served in a Saint Bernardus chalice; pours a rich ruby brown with a lacy tan head. Aroma is terrific; bread and raisins, very appealing. Taste is world class; very little hint of alcohol, with a great blend of yeast, fruit, and malt balanced perfectly. Very smooth drinking, this beer is a fantastic example of the quadrupel. Sitting sipping an Abt 12, watching Game 7 of the Stanley Cup.... what else do you need in life..."
"Overall, I don't think this beer is worth the price it commands. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it just didn't do much for me. I'll not spend my money on it again."
"Very excited that I can have this practically any time at home for less than $10."
"Drinkability - will look to have again."
"-Oelergud"
"I could drink this all night if not for the high potency!!!"
"I'm afraid this one could definitely get the better of me...it is too easy to drink and too desirable."
"Concidering the deep complexity of this beer it is amazing how smooth it actually is. Also concidering it costs about half of a Westy or Rochefort it seems like a great deal."
"In all reality...epic is the only word that exists in the same realm as this ale; so I will leave it at that."
"Malt flavor and dark color. Beautiful aroma. The best belgian quad that I have ever had. tastes a little better in the 750ml cork bottle over the 11.2oz bottle. A nice winter warmer. I prefer Abt 12 over Rochfort 10 any day. I like to pair this brew with some strongly aged abby cheese. Can drink this at any time of year also."
"This is one of the most pleasing beers I've ever had. I'd like to face this one off against the Trappistes Rochefort 10 and see which one I truly prefer. Both are fantastic."
"The only thing that keeps this from being a 5.0 on the drinkability scale is it's deceptivly high ABV"
"Overall, a bit of a disappointment. I let this sit for about 15-20 minutes before starting, but it was still a bit harsh at the beginning. As it warmed, it became much better. You can definitely tell all of this breweries' beers are related. Decent stuff, but not all that in my book."
"This beer is made to savor, with its ABV and its price-to-quantity ratio considered, but can be drunken at a steady pace if you really wanted to. My advice is enjoy it slowly."
"D - Given the ABV this is very drinkable. An excellent beer."
"Poured out of the corked and caged 750ml bottle into a tulip. Poured a dark brown with a nice thick head. Wonderful head retention and lacing throughout the duration of the beer. The smell is more complex than my brain can process. I pick up many fruits (plum, cherries, banana and even apples) along with a nice malt and yeast aroma. The high ABV sneaks into the nose as well but is not overpowering. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is extremely complex. Some sips I will get a delicate combination of fruit while others I will get a darker malt/chocolate taste. These tastes are followed up by a large alcohol kick. This brew gets better and better as it warms up and even more of the flavors come out. Overall, this is hands down one of the finest brews in the world."
"I had this in bottle many years ago,and enjoyed it. On tap it is near perfection. My guess is that the monks don't care about being celibate after a few of these."
"This is one of the very few that livedd up to the hype. It is excellently crafted and should be tried by any kind of beer lover."
"Yuck!"
"Good head retention thats lasting the entire beer. Tight bubbles. Smell is somewhat nutty with lots of yeast. Caramel. Taste is yeastier than other 12's. Malty flavor with hints of raisins and caramel. Alcoholic aftertaste with a brown sugar finish. Nice silky mouthfeel. Nice beer"
"Fine looking brew, dark brown, auburn in color. Three quarter inch thick clumpy off white head forms. Excellent head retention, and tons of delicate sticky lacing. Mostly smells of malt, ripe fruits, like apples and pears, spices and just a touch of alcohol. Lots of rum soaked fruit flavors, semi sweet and tart, with a slight sourness. I guess a little of everything. Finishes a little dry, leaving a spice and alcohol twangyness on the tongue. I don't know if twangyness is a word, but thats how it feels. A very smooth sipping beer, very easy too drink. A suttle warm feeling fills the belly from the 10% abv. Overall a very enjoyable anad comes highly recommended."
"Pours a rich reddish brown color lightly tanned lacy head. Retention is good and seems to stick around glass till the end. The aroma is sharp with cloves and ripe fruits. Crisp yet silky body. Sugary malts and slighty ripe fruits dominate the flavor. The alcohol helps sweeting the fruit flavors a bit. Very warming at 10%. Finishes off sweet and semi dry. Awsome Abbey ale!"
"Overall: A really fantastic beer. Easily one of the best I've had."
"33 cL crowned bottle, ""Best Before End 15 09 09"" -- relatively young, I imagine. Poured into an oversized wine goblet. Densely clouded blood red with a thinning and finely attenuated light tan layer of foam. Nose is predominantly port-like, with notes of alcohol heat, maraschino cherries, and yeasted sugar candies. The highly noticeable booziness of the aroma is stunningly masked in the flavor; all I get are dark rum-soaked plums, bing cherries, and a slightly soured date sugar sweetness at the finish. Hearty yeast-flavored aftertaste. The alcohol is slightly noticeable immediately before the finish in the form of a langorous warming at the back of the throat. Mouth feel is chewy and expansive, airy and fluffy with a rapid yet subtle carbonated effect. Without a doubt, ridiculously drinkable for 10% abv. As expected, pure class in a bottle."
"Recommended for sure."
"-UF"
"Overall impression: Certainly a good beer and enjoyable enough but not sure that I would put it in the ""outstanding"" category. I enjoyed the Abt 8 much more. This seems a touch unbalanced with the alcohol taking too much presence. The bottle suggests aging and I'd be inclined to agree with them. Put this back a few years and I could see this as outstanding. Recommended."
"I can't really say that this beer lives up too the reputation. For me it is too acidic and too strong to really enjoy the beer."
"Quads have never been a style to make me cross the street...but I'd crawl naked over two miles of broken glass just to get my hands on another bottle of this."
"Overall: A fantastic quadrupel. Well representative of the style. Enthusiastically recommended, if you can find it."
"I really like the brewery and this beverage. I guess I took a chance on aging it, in some subideal conditions, and it didn't work out. I'll have to do another review with a fresh bottle and note the differences. The Pater 6 and Tripel are much better, I think, and they were aged side by side for almost the same amount of time so I don't feel the bottle should be spoiled."
"I poured this beer into a big wine glass; the color was deep amber with hints of red and a big light off white head. I get alot more phenol than esters in the smell; peppery is the dominant smell with some plum in the background. The taste starts out peppery then hint of orange and plum that give way to a malt, bready type ending. The flavors are all mixed in after each sip, the peppery taste may not be first but it is there as is the fruit and malt. It is highly carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel; the carbonation seems to help mix all the flavors around. I hope I can get more of this soon"
"Enjoy and be careful, this ale packs a wallop!"
"Wow, this is a very nice experience. It pours from the bottle a cloudy dark color. There is plenty of head. The smell is malty, fainlty of citrus, and with only hints of the alcohol content within. The taste is a nice malty slap to the palate. The after taste is nice, with just a bit of stick residue on the glossal apparatus. This is a very, very, drinkable beverage, while the high ABV content may prevent over indulgence."
"On tap at Monk's in the back bar. What a great looking beer. It pours a nice deep brown, almost black body with a thick off-white and creamy head. The aroma is a good balance of deep toasted notes and some dried fruit tones as well. The taste is a feast for the mouth. I get dried fruits, plums and berries. I also get an obvious toasted character to this bold and complex and full bodied beer. What a joy to consume."
"A strong dark Belgian, is it a Quad or just a abbey dubble with lots of power.. malty and worth the search from the bottle as sampled at Ommegang beer festival. The mouthfeel and aroma of sweet bread along put this beer over the top. Savor slowly as it does creep up on you with the potent alcohol content."
"Pours dark brown with a big, creamy off-white head, mostly lasting, nice lacing. Aroma is clove, plums, banana, and sweet malt. Flavor is caramel, toffee, plums, raisins, figs and spice. These all come together superbly. The mouthfeel of this is wonderful, very smooth, carbonation dances on the tongue. Long finish, slightly warming, but alcohol is amazingly hidden. Fantastic."
"I'm going on memory of a few months ago...A delightful pair brought me two bottles back from their monastic tour in Belgium I dont recall the date-if there was one but I imagine it was fairly fresh. The first bottle poured wonderfully toffee brown with a semi-sweet very malty backbone. Black pepper dominated the spices. The other bottle has been cellared for a while now, I beleive I'll try it tonight with dinner & report very soon with notes."
"Perhaps I caught this beer at an unfortunate point of age. As it stands now, I will never age this one again and I promise to drink it by the chalice, fresh and unwithered."
"Had this on tap a bit ago. This review, however, is a bottle. To be honest, I would much rather the tap. The bottle is nearly the same, with the exception of a bit more carbonation. The St. Bernie on tap had a softer mouthfeel. I also think that the smell suffers a bit in the bottle. However, this is still a very good beer. Dried fruits and vanilla are present in the nose and the taste. The head on the bottle version is a tad more than that on tap, but both lace the chalice tremendously, till the very end. The taste finishes on the dry side, and the acholol is present on each sip, but that doesn't shy me away from this one. As usual, the Belgian pride shows through. Absolutely worth the effort put forth in searching this one out."
"This is a beer to buy and savor again and again. Thank god Bottleworks carries this regularly. I Will kill .... err BUY again!"
"Drinkability: Well, this is only a 330cl, but I'm splitting it with a friend. I would not be able to take down more than one of these smaller bottles."
"11.2 oz. bottle with the numbers 260710 on the label. Cloudy, muddy light brown color. Thick off-white head, which disappeared quickly, leaving a thin ring around the edges of the goblet. Aroma of plums, raisins, figs, dark bread and alcohol. Quite a pleasant combination for the old sniffer! Warming with alcohol, lots of carbonation.Dark fruity, and bread-like with some spices and yeasty flavor. Heavy in aroma and flavor, but doesn't overwhelm the palate due to the carbonation. Very well done."
"A delight - warming and full of flavor. While it provides warmth, the drying carbonation prevents cloying and makes this an easy drinking high alcohol beer."
" The nose is very fruity and malty, a little dissapointing. As far as the flavor went i picked up on malts, fruits/citrus, nuts, alchol, and hot cinnamon flaovr, the beer is full bodied and leaves your mouth with a buttery lard feeling after drinking. The alchol is present to say the least and it warms your whole body up. I enjoyed this beer alot. ""Two Thumbs Way Up"""
"Pretty high ABV but an absolutely delicious experience. Reminded me of Trappistes Rochefort 10, and also Gulden Draak and Nostradamus. So it sits in exalted company, but we should expect that from the St. Bernardus brewery by now."
"This beer is great! Is it one of the best in the world? Most certainly in my book. Absolutely worth the six dollars per glass at the Saucer (both times). Not a horribly complex beer, but great overall."
"One of the best. Worthy."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"This is a wonderful sipper. The high ABV and intense flavors make one brew enough for me, but drinkability still has to be rated very high."
"Drinkability of this high ABV is great. It took about 30 minutes to finish off the bottle.This beer will become one of my cellar favorites."
"Picked up the 750mL corked bottle from ""Beers of the World"" and was excited the whole way home. Served just under room temp into a tulip glass. Upon pouring a large brown head appeared, and remained untill the glass was finished. this beer has the most beautiful color when held up to the light. A deep red that is alittle clouded by yeast. The smell is also incredible. Very floral aroma that in overwhelmingly enjoyable. The aroma of this beer definitely got you ready for the taste. The taste is amazing. Sweet, but not heavy, dry, but not too dry. This beer suprises you with every sip you take. I babied this bottle for almost an hour because I didn't want it to end. It is smooth and clean in the mouth, and I could drink this beer for the rest of my life if I could afford to. Definitely deserves to be in the top five in BA"
"Dhonestly, I tried this due to the high ranking and I agree. It is wonderful. One is plenty due to the 10% abv and bold flavors, but a great sipping beer. The perfect nightcap, imo."
"d- the alcohol in this makes it hard for me to drink more than a few of these."
"It was served to me a bit too cold, but it really opened up as it went up a few degrees."
"Side note: I definately feel this one is best when it warms. I opened it when it was still a little too cool and as it warmed in front of me it kept getting better."
"Overall, this is a brilliant brew, especially as a winter warmer, and will not disappoint."
"I will be back for more."
"I usually drink this beer whenever I go to the Publick House but this one is a 1 pint, 9.4 ounce bottle from Julios. It poured a cloudy hazy brown with a creamy head that lasts forever. The lacing is great. The aroma is of fruits, raisins, malts, and alcohol. This beer has such a complex taste. It is wonderful and delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is definitely not a chugging beer. It is great to sip and sip I will all night until the very last drop of this beauty."
"Mouthfeel: Smothe silkey but finishes crisp"
"This is a beer to sip by a fire and in the company of good friends, a beer to harmonize with a situation of rich beauty and languor."
"drinkability - unbelieveable, incredible especially considering its 10% alcohol. mouthfeel is the best ive had. tastes amazing through a range of temperatures, great alone or with food, i intend to keep some of this around whenever i can, is perfect in nice 5 oz servings, taste never falters, could sip it all day despite its abv."
"Jim"
"Pours a dark brown translucent color. Has a thick off white head that fell to a 1/4 inch cap with lacings along the side. Aroma was grainy and sweet malts. Fruity like figs or raisins, with earthy and spicy undertones. Taste was just as expected with fruity raisins and figs. Had a very refreshing fruitiness but with just the right amount of hops to smooth down the sweetness and finish with mellow cloves and spices. Has a earthy oaken undertone. Carbonation is medium with medium body. It has a lot of flavor that lasts for a while but with a refreshing mouthfeel. Alcohol is mostly hidden but still has a good warming effect. Wonderful beer that will be around for evenings to sit and chat."
"Drinkability - this does not comes across like 10%, what a great beer. I'll have to grab more at my next opportunity."
"Wish I could drink it every day."
"This brew poured a very dark brown color with a dense head that stuck to the side of the glass. The beer was so dark in fact, that I could not shine a light through it. The nose was spicy, malty and chocolatey. The taste was impressive, with notes of dark fruit, chocolate, port wine and molasses in the palate. This beer was very rich and luscious. Alcohol was noticable but hidden quite well. St. Bernardus 12 deserves it high rating on the ""Best of BA"". Excellent beer."
"this beer is hyped as being superior to Westy 12. Ummm... not sure I see why that claim holds so well. All the flavors just seem a bit more subdued than Westy 12. Malts are candy sweet with some tired Belgian sugars. Spice flavors were present but they seemed like they were out of date too. Phenols were a bit strong, especially as the beer warmed more. Little bits of cherry too. Full body and flavor. All-in-all it is a drinkable Belgian but not sure it is what everyone pumps it up to be."
"Poured out of a bottle into a tulip glass. Nice dark color with medium head that sticks to everything it touches. Nice lacing all around. Smells fantastic. Lots a malted bitter fruits with a hint of alcohol. Taste is great as well. Fruits and sweet malts dominate, like a Belgian beer should. Mouth is full bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Very good. Drinkability is hurt a little by the abv, but I would happily down these until I couldn't stand."
"D - Storng ABV makes this one a beer to cherish. Nice to sip and enjoy."
"The beers flavor was big and comlex like its aroma. With a malt presence at the beginning along with overt hints of different dark fruits. A subdued hop presence and a completely hidden abv., Although thils beer's creaminess points it towards the sipping category, it can sneak up on you while being incredibly drinkable. Plunk me down with some good music and a few good friends and an evening of discussing this beer and whatever else come our way. While other Belgian beers maybe more rare, St. Bernardus is generally readily available and well worth purchasing again because of its exceptional quality."
"Not my favourite, but I must give respect -- a great, great beer."
"@7.99/750ml - this is a steal."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, sugary, and full of doughy yeast and rich malt."
"This is one of the first Belgians I've hadd, out of many, which tempts me to have a second glass immediately after the first. Normally I have to take a break with something less complex or less alcoholic, but this is really, relaly good."
"Rich full mouthfeel, the alcohol burn keeps this from being incredible. ABV keeps drinkability from being as high as the other scores- for drinakbility, I'll take the 6 or 8, both wonderful beers in themselves."
"Drinkability: This beer feels like a ""lighter"" Belgian beer to the palate, even though it is not. It's quite drinkable but I don't think I'd want to stick with this single style all night."
"D: I tried this once before and didn't care for it much, but I bought it again hoping that I got a bad bottle. Nope. I've enjoyed every other Belgian that I've had, so I'm a little perplexed as to why this one tastes so different to me. A positive is that the alcohol is very well hidden, but for the price, I don't think that this is worth buying again."
"This is one of those beers you want to continuously sip over an evening. Lots of stuff going on here, which means it'll hold your interest. Wonderful."
"This is a tasty belgian brew. Some people might not care for the alcohol bite."
"Notes: A very good beer. I have had some Quads that have overwhelmed me with a strong alcohol presence. Not this one. This quad is well crafted and a pleasure to drink. At $13.95 for a four pack, it s hard to justify the price outside having some friends come into town, but well worth grabbing if you havent tried it before."
"Hazy brown drink with carbonation bubbles rising the entire time. Very large off-white head that stays throughout the drink. Tons of lacing. Nose of sweet ripened fruit, yeast, and clove cigarettes. Very sweet smell. More clove in the taste along with afore mentioned sweet fruit and strong alcohol taste that is present but not overpowering and that doesn't take away from the rest of the flavors. As soon as you swallow, the wave of warm strong alcohol taste and feel hit hard. It's not a bad thing at all. Mmm that feels good. Creamy feel to this beer with a smooth but strong finish. I'm not sure I could have more than one or two of these in a night simply because of the alcohol content. If I could I would though! Great beer. Go pick this one up."
"D- Certainly a sipper and one to enjoy. Alcohol makes its presence felt after a bottle, but not overpoweringly so. But hey, that's part of the fun of drinking isn't it?"
"The bottle kicks ass, the label is screenprinted on showing a happy monk dude. I Popped this one open causing a loud explosion. Lots of pressure I guess. This poured a gorgous hazy burgundian brown with a nice creamy tan head. The head looks like a root beer float, lots of craters and variation in bubble size. Kinda cool. Good lacing. The aroma is fruity w/light alcohol presence. The flavor is tangy and yeasty. This beer does kick your ass via alcohol but it lacks the flavor that I would think it would need to have to justify the stellar rankings it has gotten. The mouthfeel is pretty great though, very smooth. Moderately drinkable."
"Drinkability  Definitely a sipping beer. This one is powerful in every way but still makes you want more."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, full-bodied, near syrupy. Borderline cloying, which definitely hurts its drinkability. Is this a good Belgian ale? Yes. Is this a Westvleteren 12 clone, as popularly believed? Hardly. Is this deserving of such a high ranking here? I don't think so."
"Drinkable, but still just a half-hearted effort."
"Verdict- This isn't a beer, it's an experience."
"The alcohol is slightly high for my personal taste, but is balanced by the fantastic malt character. Like many strong Belgian ales, this beer is will hopped to balance the heavy malt."
"Perhaps THE most drinkable 10% brew I have ever tasted. While the alcohol is noticeable, it only serves to add to the experience. Unlike many imperial stouts, there is not a significant amount of thickness to the liquid to impair drinkability. All in all... a experience.... an absolutely amazing beer.... and here's the kicker... I'm not even particularly fond of Belgians."
"Simply, one of my favorite beers. I've heard a rumor that St. Bernardus brews recipes that were sold to them from Westvleteren, and not having tasted them, I could believe it. This beer is flat out phenomenal. If I could change anything about it, I wouldn't."
"Pours a creamy brown with a nice lingering head, smell is malty and sweet with some slight funkiness and a decent amount of alcohol coming through. Taste is fairly full bodied for a belgian with malty richness and suggestions of plums. Mouthfeel is very nice, not too much carbonation and enough body to make this a great sipper. Alcohol comes through in a peppery finish which makes this a beer to respect, just one bottle and I can definitely feel this one. Overall a really world class brew, definitely one that is worthy of it's reputation."
"D - A very drinkable brew. I am exceedingly partial to Belgian ales and this one is impressive."
"750ml silkcreened corked bottle. Pours a mahogony brown with a 1 finger head, OK longevity and good lace. Deep caramel and sugar aromas with dried dark fruit slight hop spicy aromas. Deep caramel and brown sugar taste but with a touch of roasted malt and drited dark fruit flavors. Decent hop flavors and bitterness but fades quickly into a alcohol presence. Carbonation is a bit high which reduces the drinkability. A decent quad that Im sure will be much better with a year in the cellar - I think I will buy another and try."
"The head is a half inch thick, it's tan looking and almost appears gray also. It dissipates pretty fast though, the color is a deep plum and there is lots of floating sediment throughout. The smell is fruity with aromas of rasins and bananas, spice and alcohol. The taste is sweet initially, then becomes a little more tart after a few seconds, with more rasiny fruit notes. The malt flavor is complex and it tastes dry. The finish is not bitter but somewhat spicy and with moderate alcohol flavor. The mouthfeel is excellent, zesty bubbles, not overly thick, incredibly smooth. A solid Quadrupel, many will love it."
"Overall, just one of the finest beers around. I could have this all day long (well, until i pass out) and not get tire of the complexities. However, i dont feel this bottle represents what i have had before (or maybe its just me tonight). Great stuff."
"Nice big body on this one and great drinkability. I think I could have about 3 of these and feel alright. Nice beer."
"Wow, this is my second time having this beer and it was just as I remembered so delicious so smooth. This quad pours a dark ruby brown and leaves a thin tan lace that sticks to the glass and stays with the brew. The aromas is fruity esters, alcohal soaked dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, very complex and literally makes you salivate. The taste is so complex, it starts dry and tangy with a slight vinos presence but more actually to rum or brandy. It then sweetens on your palate with a carmal malt feeling that then again brings you to more of a dark plum feel on the palate. Fantastic brew I would pair this beer with a fresh fruit plate to compliment the fruit in the beer."
"Good looking beer. pours like brandy almost but with some small head. looks sticky and reddish brown. Smells like alcohol at first, then kind of like corny malt liquorish. First couple of sips burn with the alcohol and you feel it diffuse into your tongue. then there was a fairly complex mishmash of flavors including prunes, malt, not-quite-ripe apples, and ethanol. I didnt actually think this lived up to its hype very well. too harsh and more than one would knock me on my ass. maybe it would be better cellared for a while but i'm not sure im going to give it that chance."
"Drinkability is okay. The buring alcohol is wearing me down as drink this but the smell is so fantastic I just want more. It looks so good in the glass, I want another sip. Yet, each sip brings the burning edge of alcohol. It's so sad and yet so wonderful."
"11.2 oz bottle best by 8/8/08 poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a deep reddish brown with a mammoth off-white head, great retention, wonderful huge curtains of lace. Nose is full of yeast, a nice doughiness, citrus fruits, and a slight peppery spiciness. Taste is a wonderful fruity malt, orange, pear, banana, mango, red apple, raisins--with hints of chocolate, caramel, and almonds, a slight grassy hoppiness--this is a superbly flavorful and complex beer. Full bodied with a medium carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. This is an exceptional beer, one of the best I've ever tasted, rivalling anything produced by any of the Trappist. Well done St. Bernardus."
"alcohol is very well-hidden in the taste; don't really notice until i start feeling it about halfway through the bottle. sugary, doughy malts, fruity esters. buttery, rich mouthfeel with heavy carbonation. incredibly drinkable, great aroma, great taste...mouthfeel is the only weakness for me; a few too many bubbles. fantastic brew from the friendly monk."
"Poured a deep brownish-red color with much floating sediment. Chunky, foamy, tannish head that left nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is enjoyable, being a nice mixture of fruitiness, yeast, and dough-like notes. Taste presents itself with a pleasant fruitiness, that caresses the tiongue in an extraordinary manner. Finish is very smooth for a 10% alcohol beer. Drinkabilty is scary, because this beer is so easy going down. A great beer!"
"Supper smooth going down. For a 10% beer it is incredible drinkable. This is damn near perfect. Slight knock on appearance for head retention time. I'm still searching for that perfect beer but this is as close as I've come."
"Aroma is quite fruity with notes of sfruit piced cake and spices. Dark brown, but very slightly reddish color. Head is two and half fingers, lasting and mostly creamy though there are some bubbles. Fore is again quite fruity with pear, apple, cherry and plum coming out. There is a very bready malt feel to it and some candy sugar sweetness. Almost tastes like a spiced apple liqour. It does lack in some areas. The flavor intensity isnt quit as strong as Id like. You can pick out quite a bit, but it doesnt dazzle the palate as much as some others."
"Appears very dark brown in colour with a stable medium sized light brown head. Aroma of sweet, chocolatey malts; brown sugar and hints of spices and fruits (oranges). Rich chocolatey nutty malt flavour. Some brown sugar, dried fruit (raisins) and spices are suggested too. Some warming alcohol in the finish but no burn. Mouthfeel is full and coarse. Tasty, satisfying and a little easier to drink than Rochefort 10, although possibly not as complex. All in all, outstanding."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 3/4"" light tan head above the clear reddish burgundy brew. Pillowy head lasts and lasts, with heavy airy lacing. Aroma is sweet dark fruit and spices coupling with the malty sweetness. Taste is really exactly as the nose indicated, with a warming alcohol close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is nice, although the sweetness and alcohol starts to limit sessions. very nice brew, for sure."
"D = Going to keep a few of these in my cellar. Definitely one of my new favourites."
"I always equate this beer with the westvleterin 12, mostly because not a lot of Belgian companies make the quadrupel style. This is a terrific beer, but it just doesnt have the same complexities that are found in the westy... a very similar candied fruit taste dominates the front and end of the beer, while an overwhelming popuri fills the middle. Definitly not a beer that can be drank fast, with a content of 10%, but I still think the ultimate is Westy."
"I could enjoy another. More than two would be a lot."
"Smoother than silk, peppy on the tongue, never cloying, never heavy, never lightbodied, and only overpowering in the same way horniness is overpowering, ya dig? A stupendous beer. Props to JulieRFoster for the great gift (came with 3 other St Bernardii, and a glass!)!"
"The winey aftertaste lingers for a few seconds then is gone. Mouthfeel is nothing special - medium bodied for the style, very carbonated, dry. Very drinkable. A bit overrated in my opinion, but a good beer nonetheless."
"The beer pours a dark amber brown with a huge head that holds fantastically and laces great. It smells of some fruit that I cannot put my finger on. It definitely does not smell of citrus as experienced with most beers. There might also be a faint liquorice smell about it. The taste is quite similar to the smell. The fruit may be cherry. The mouthfeel is thick and the carbonation is even. It feels fantastic. Overall I absolutely love this beer and would drink it again and again. I look forward to getting chance to cellar some of this."
"Drinkability - This isnt really my favorite style so I wouldnt drink more then 1 in a sitting, but its a nice change from the regular stuff."
"Overall- not a good one here! Too much alcohol ruins it. Too sweet as well!"
"This is an amazing brew."
"Overall: A very strong beer, too strong to contemplate having several in a row, could probably use a year or two in the cellar. Look forward to having a mellower version."
"An adult beer. Not for guzzlers, amateurs, hipsters, liars, slackjaws, hippies, rednecks, punks, grabasses, politicians or cry-babies. Grabs you by the shirt and demands respect. The world's finest craftsmanship. It's not often you can appreciate the sweat and the beauty of such a thing at the same time. If I find a better beer, I fear I shall be dead. This is the pinnacle, the absolute tip of the spire. Amen."
"D-Taking notes on this was tough, as all I wanted to do was sip it holding the glass with both hands, pour more, and repeat. All who tried it on Xmas day agreed it was different, complex and out and out good. Will buy another 750 or two next time I am at the store, kickass warming sensation provided by the 10%. So sad to see the bottle empty ;) Tough to put into words how much I enjoyed this, superb is the first thing that comes to mind, top flight beer."
"This is an exceptional brew that deserves its praise."
"A fine after dinner drink, to enjoy slowly, and savor all the complexities this brew has to offer. Rich and delicious."
"This is a well balanced flavorful beer. It hides the 10% alcohol very well. It's best when each sip is savored as the flavor comes alive when the beer warms in the glass."
"i can honestly say this is one of the first quadrupels that i've actually sat down and enjoyed. it looked beautiful being poured into my snifter with a monsterous 2 in. foaming light tan head. It has a light brown color to it. A slightly fruity smell with a little hint of vanilla. This is probably one of the best balanced beers that i've tasted. I was expecting a big alcohol kick with the 10% but it was just right mixed with the malts. Pretty much perfect. i can sit down and drink a few of these. I might not feel too good in the morning but i wouldn't mind drinking it"
"Pours a garnet hued dull brown with a billowing beige head. Rocky all over, diminishing and lacing my glass to death. Aroma is intoxicating, nutty almond, brown sugar, soft plum, faint mint, clove, even slight banana. Taste is immediately almond and brown sugar then there's a flood of esters and burly molasses, drying through the finish leaving my palate aching in its wake. It's the aroma magnified by 10, and my mouth waters. Spicy alcohol and yeastiness integrated throughout. A meaty body with medium carbonation, a tad abrasive and utter perfection. I need more."
"This is right on style. Aroma is light bread, with a moderately yeasty smell. There is also a hint of cherry. I think the draft verion, which I had two night ago has more cherry. There was a rocky head, but definitely not as much as on draft. Not a whole lot of head, but it doesn't fully diminish. Initial flavor is moderately sweet that lessens somewhat. More cherry and bread than the aroma indicated. The finish is long. This was lively on th etongue, more so than the draft version. There is a moderate alcohol feel. While this is one of my favorite quads, I think it's even better with a year on it. When I think of what a quad should be like, I think of ABT 12."
"from the bottle. pored brown with light tan head some real nice lacing. aroma, citrus, yeast, malts, chocolte, molasses, dark cherries, and other dark fruits and alcohol. flavor, wow the balance of chocolate, cherries, grape, and malts were right on the the way the alcohol came out was nice. and had a nice dry finish."
"Notes: If you like sweeter beers, try this, you will love it more than your wife."
"overall: like i said i didn't cream my slacks over it, but wouldn'r exactly turn one away either."
"So, it gets great marks for taste and drinkability, but the overall depth makes it miss the perfect mark, I must be a sucker for a less polished package when it comes to the filtering and flavor profile; I wouldn't possbly turn one down however..."
"Pours a dark ruby, with a thick cocoa-tinged head that eventually dissipates leaving a consistent lacing. Smells wonderful, bready yeasts, chocolaty malts, and spice --- mmmm. Taste: does it get any better than this? Rum-drenched raisins, and good, dense (European) bread, brandy and sweet cherries, strong port and dark chocolate. Fantastic! Great carbonation, making it very drinkable for the abv, though one is enough, thank you. Overall, you can't beat this one with a stick. Those crazy Trappist monks know what they're doing!"
"Notes: Honestly, this beer is worth the $13.50 for 4 12oz bottles. Would make the purchase again in a hearbeat. Feeling that the only way this beer could improve would be to enjoy it in its home country. Also, with a shelf life of years, I would absolutly love to let one of these age. Would suggest following serving instructions and serving this beer at a warmer temperature, agitation also brings out hidden complexities that may not be at first noticed."
"I was really stunned by the alcohol in this beer. It was prominent, but not at all overpowering. It added a flavor all of its own that blended in well with the rest of the flavors. This is a well done beer."
"Notes: This beer experience was unique. St. Bernardus Abt 12 has the power to relax you body and mind after only about half a beer. It is an absolute pleasure to partake of this masterpiece."
"This is a truly great beer that defines the style. Pours a dark brown with a nice head. There are smells of dark sugary fruit, bread, nuts & leather. The mouthfeel is full and coats the tongue with fine bubbles and deep malt texture. The flavors from the malts and yeast dominate bring out flavors of nuts, plums, figs, cherry and fresh baked bread. Broad yeast profile imparting flavors of spice, nutmeg & vanilla. There is almost no hint of the alcohol in this beer. I had some biting Pecorino Romano cheese that really set off the flavors of this beer and made them new with each sip. Buy and enjoy this beer"
"A big daddy, a fireside sipper."
"Drinkability is above average for this huge beer. I could sip (and I do mean sip slowly) all night long.."
"Length is rather remarkable, with the intensity of flavor continuing throughout. Mouthfeel is nice, with a relatively low carbonation letting the weight of the malt give a really rounded, velvety impression. Sweetness rounds it out nicely. Perilously drinkable for what it is, and a favorite of the style for me."
"Overall, this is a good beer, as some of buddy's took sips and enjoyed it. It might take a little while for me to get used to this style, so I'll try some more quadrupels in the future."
"I highly recommend this beer, especially from the 750mL corked and caged bottles (nice screen printing on the bottles too) and it sits firmly in my top five beers list."
"Dark brown in colour with fairly strong carbonation. Aromatic notes of red berries, caramel malt, raisin, and nutmeg. The sweet caramel elements become more eveident in the flavor, along with additional notes of very mild toasted oak, vanilla, plums, and other dark fruit. Not a great deal of alcohol presence. Complex, yet easy drinking. I was expecting to get blown away by this beer, and was a little disappointed that I wasnt, but this was still a pretty darn good."
"Drinkability: This beer is just fantastic. Although high in alcohol it does not interfere with the taste and is smooth."
"The one thing that struck me most about this splendid beer was its maximal smoothness and impressive drinkability. I did not find it to be particularly complicated or interesting and yet I didnt mind this in the slightest. St. Bernies 12 just tastes so good that I dont care if its not much more than boat loads of sweet rich malts. To me, this is just about a perfect beer. It is meant for consumption, it gives a great buzz, it is strong yet excessively drinkable. I love it and will make it a point to drink it en mass whenever I am given the opportunity."
"What can I say about this one? Thank god its on tap at the Publick House. This is my old stand by there and you really can't go wrong with it. An amazing, sweet Belgian bruin. A reminder of what good beer is all about. I will be seeing this beer again soon."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with a medium size white creamy head. The lacing is outstaning. The aroma is of spices and caramel, but is rather faint. The taste is nice and spicy with a solid malt backbone. The mouthfeel is meium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a good brew, worth havin again."
"My expectations on St Bernardus Abt 12 were high, to say the least. I overherad some guys at the bar saying it was number three on best of BA. Respect. The happy monk label on the bottle is pretty low budget but the beer itself is straight from beer-shambala. It poured with a nice dark blue-red color with brownish head that settled down to a finger. The complex flowery smell reminded me of cheap, artificially flavoured soft candy. The taste is actually a lot like traditional Swedish Christmas must but with a lot more alcohol. Some dry hops emerging in the aftertaste, biting the cheeks. Don't try to drink another brand during the same session!"
"This beer is fantastic, certainly deserving of the praise sung by other BA's. I still think Rochefort 10 is my favorite, but this one makes the short list of best in the world. I plan to come back to it shortly."
"The taste is a mix of fruit, more of the plum and some banana with a faint clove presence. Yum. This is wonderfully balanced brew that does a nice job of warming *and* doesn't let the alcohol interfere with the flavours' symphonic melody. Tis a fine example of a Belgian Quadrupel."
"This is a great beer, full of complex flavors and deceptively smooth for 10 percent. Its worth a try. world class but still no Westy 12."
"The drinkability level is beyond good, not to mention it's 10.0% ABV. Each gentle sip is more enjoyable than the next. A world class beer and clearly recommended. I have had this on tap at The Publick House in Brookline, MA a couple of times and this beer is even more phenomenal on draft. One the best beers I've had."
"Anyways..that's not important...on to the good stuff. This beer is nothing short of majestic. Always touted as one of the best beers in the world, and now I believe it. Served in a tulip-style glass. Dark brown, rich ruby color with a very large, frothy, immovable head. Yeasty sediment is suspended in the glass and the lacing forms in sheets. Aroma & taste are huge and complex..big brown sugar flavors & rich malts blend perfectly with the subtle and amazing array of spices. Full mouthfeel..little carbonation. The 10% alcohol is hardly even a thought as you're drinking it. Just an outstanding beer, and one every beer lover should enjoy."
"Notes: Glad that glass came today, because I wasn't going to drink tonight. However now I'm just going to pop a movie in and sip on this one for a while."
"Overall this is by far one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. The balance and complexity in the mouth is rave worthy. I've been looking forward to trying this well promoted Belgian for some time now, and am looking extremely forward to drinking it again. This is an excellent special occasion drink."
"The drinkability of this beer is very good. The alcohol is pretty much nonexistent is a sea of flavor. I'd love to have another, but I only have one 330 ml bottle. Oh well, makes it more of a treat."
"Pours a merkey brownish red and retains a fluffy bubbley slightly off white head. There is some yeast sediment in the bottle but not as much as I have gotten in some other bottles of abt 12. The aromas coming from my glass are heavenly. With the addition of typical belgian trappist ale aromas (plum, sweet figs, other dried fruit, I can pick up hints of apple, pear, and the aroma is rather smooth than others i have sampled with less of a present alchol character in its smell. The taste, oh! and the taste, again contains characteristics true to most quadrupels but is set apart with how incredibley smooth and well balanced the flavors flow together. Each characteristic seems to blend into each other and leave you with this aftertaste of a wonderful mix of fruits, mollasses and a ever so slight alcohol warming. The mouthfeel is silkier than expected, but each flavor sticks to your taste buds. This is a beer that needs exploring to really get and I plan to explore. This deserves its recognition."
"The beer is just smooth. A complex and full body. Very complex and a real treat. Believe the hype."
"Pours a beautiful burgundy-brown in my goblet. A thick, lingering off-white colored foam develops and seems to stay intact for hours. The beer seems somewhat viscous but not overdone. I can detect dark fruits, alcohol, bread, figs, and some plum aromas. Very interesting and unique even for this style. The taste is just incredible; playful bitterness upfront with a strong, sweet malt finish that is dry and rich. A bit of warming alcohol sensation as well. Takes more like a Dubbel than a Quadrupel in terms of being an 'acquired' taste. As the beer warms, more complex and rich flavors become apparent; some spices seem to appear and linger in the aftertaste. Some roasted characteristics seem to prevail as well as the beer warms. The most incredible thing about this beer is that it is very very drinkable; the alcohol doesn't make itself known until after a glass or two. Just an incredible brew; one of my favorites, without a doubt. Well worth the $9 I paid for this bottle."
"The scariest part about this beer is how easy it goes down. You don't realize that it's a 10% beer... until you fall off your stool."
"750 ml bottle. This beer pours out a dark brown color with a huge head. Delicious aroma of bread, chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, and spice. Sweet caramel malt flavor with cocoa, licorice, and pepper. Finishes spicy, with cloves and more pepper, and a little bitter. The flavor is big, yet somehow delicate. Very complex flavors. No sign of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy. Incredible drinkability. This beer is all-around fantastic."
"Let this one warm up a bit. Brings out more of the fruity notes and covers the alcohol. Wonderful sipping brew closer to a desert or wine than your average beer."
"A truly incredible beer (just watch out when you stand up after finishing it). Words can't even begin to describe the experience of drinking it. Now, if only I can justify the cost of a 750mL bottle next time..."
"Drinkability: A brew that's more than fine, and should be treated as such. Find it, admire it, take it in, and enjoy it. One of the best of the Quads, an essential."
"An absolutely terrific beer, my favorite. It was served in a oversized wine glass. It was a deep and rich black, with only a little light permeating. There was a rich but receding 1.5 finger head. The beer smelled of nuts, rich chocolate, and alcohol. I cannot overstate how overwhelmingly complex this beer is. Drinking it is a joy, because as I work my way through the glass, it is a struggle to try to figure out what flavors are coming through. There is certainly a good deal of chocolate, but there is also a mild fruitiness. I certainly get a good deal of prunes. This is a wonderful beer on the whole."
"Thanks Kent (Austin)!"
"This is one of my ""if you were stranded on a desert island, what beer would you take with you"" brews ... exceptional."
"10%? cant tell, very well hidden. That is until you stand up after finishing the bottle"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Perfect, this beer is a world class Quadrupel, one that should be tried and enjoyed by all."
"Strong, with many subtle flavors competing with big flavors, even so, this beer is extraordinarily drinkable."
"overall: very nice quadrupel as this is easily the best belgian i've had to date. being more of an advocate of big american styles, i'm sort of on a belgian kick right now and i have a lot to try, so this may not remain my highest rated. but at any rate, this is an excellent beer and well worthy of two thumbs. i have two more of these in the closet, so i'll be re-reviewing this over the next couple of years as well. btw, i've finished this beer way too quickly and i'm noticing a ""buzz"" after just one bottle. excellent, but drinkers beware!"
"Pours a dark, murky, reddish brown with lots of clumpy yeast sediment floating about, a finger of khaki head that looks like capuccino with cinnamon with dark yeast floating in the foam. Wasn't sure if this was right, but reading other reviews it seems standard. Smells strongly of dark fruits, sweet roasted malt, and alcoholic vapors. Taste starts off with raisins, vinuous overripe grapes, banana esters, loads of spicy, brown sugary malts, and a hearty warming alcohol flush. Mouthfeel is smooth but crisp. A nice, complex Belgian here. Reminds me more of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale than a Quad, but either way, a top notch brew worth seeking out."
" The mouthfeel is silky and carbonated. It has that feel of an aged beer. Thick and heavy, but not coating. I could drink many of these as long as I didn't eat. Like I said, liquid bread."
"D-Wow. This beer is bold and complex in flavor but nice and light in mouthfeel. The alcohol warmth is not overpowering and really balances the complexity of the malts. I will take another."
"This is a masterfully crafted ale that seduces the seneses with each and every sip. Keeping stride with the Westvleterens and Rocheforts, this beer plays no such second fiddel."
"I don't think I'm quite worthy to catalogue all the complexity of this stuff. I couldn't resist pouring another glass, even though it was a school night; that should say enough. Delicious."
"Pours into my chimay chalice a murky dark brown with a ruby tint and a thick off-white head that retains well and coats the sides of the glass. The aroma is intense and complex, notes of cherry, candied sugar, plum, fig, date, barnyard, toasted bread, light spices, grassy hops, slight vinegar sourness and some light phenols and alcohol. Flavor begins with some lightly tart fruit (real cherries, fig, date, plum and raisins), then some candied sugar sweetness, spices (clove, corriander, anise), malty toasted bread, some light phenols, vinous alcohol character and some light grassy and floral hops. The body on this beer is huge, with light carbonation and a creamy but thick texture with some moderate alcohol tones coming through. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it was fairly easy to drink despite its high abv. This beer is definately an experience in a bottle, delicious and heavy it meets my high expectations."
"This is a good beer, but not a great one in my opinion. The strong alcohol detracts from the rest of the flavours and the dryness left in the mouth really isn't satisfying and is annoying after awhile. Really left me thinking that I was drinking a dry wine instead of a beer."
"Full-bodied and very rich. The long-lasting head adds to the creamy mouthfeel. Silky smooth. Good carbonation. Nice warming effect. Slight sweetness in the finish. Great sipping night cap."
"It certainly seems to hit all the style guidelines."
"This beer would be good as a dessert beer, but not a session drink, just way too thick to drink much of. Very tasty brew, much thanks to Lrrr for hooking me up."
"I've had it on tap, and I am writing this review from a bottle. The bottle seems a bit more tame then when I tried it on tap. I was expecting a little more power, and it wasn't really delivering, could have mistaked it for a dubbel, but maybe I had an off bottle."
"I will be seeking out other Quads to get some reference points."
"D - To steal a quote from the great Michael Jackson, this beer is ""dangerously drinkable"". It's got everything a quad needs to have the drinker going ""mmm"" after each sip. Savor this one!"
"This is an awesome brew. Truely amazing beer in every aspect. Poured out to a dark cider color, but is more auburn when held to the light. Nice, cream colored head, about 1/2 an inch and consistant to the bottom of the glass. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of yeast, malt, and some sweetness. All around very rich and full. Taste is delectible... flavors of dark fruits, malt, some earthy notes. Smooth and slightly sweet and bitter towards the finish. Some alcohol is noted, but it doesn't indicate the 10%ABV this brew has. Medium body mouthfeel is smooth like velvet, and slightly creamy. Very good drinkability. I could have this morning noon and night. Highly recommended."
"D - If alcohol flavor doesn't bother you too much, than this is a drinkable beer. But it is very lacking all around. A big disappointment. Rocheforte 10 is much better, and I didn't even like that too much."
"A tasty beer."
"Overall, I think this is a lovely beer, bright and very striking flavors, but compared to Westy 12... well, W12 is more mature-tasting, harmonized, and I feel overall a better tasting brew. I'd definitely get this again though. And again..."
"World-class beer and a great quad."
"The head is dense and a little lighter and smaller than the W12. The beer shows more brown, less red and a little lighter. The nose is tangier, more fruity, with less of the toffee/caramel malt. Tangy fruit in front. Nice, deep toffee malt in the middle, but not quite as much butter. The alcohol in the finish is a little metallic. Not as smooth as the W: more woody and apple-y. This is still an outstanding beer. Side-by-side with the Westy, it seems a little raw: not as smooth and buttery/malty/bready. But delicious, no doubt."
"Opinion: So what can I say? This beer is fabulous! It is a monument of the complexity of beer and what a subtle blend can do. I only took a tad off for drinkability because you can tell that it is huge. It's not for the faint of palate...but not as bad as Arrogant Bastard! This is a beautiful beer!"
"This is a great beer and is very drinkable. I highly recommend it."
"Overall a very good beer that's worth a try. I'd love to have it on tap, actually, because I imagine that will trump my rating of the bottled version."
"Overall, I like this beer, but it's not quite the tour de force that I was expecting. It's very good, but not at the top of its class. I would gladly have one of these anytime though."
"Where do you begin with this one? Mouthfeel is slightly astringent but not too harsh. Alcohol is evident in the finish. Taste is of fresh fruit, slightly acidic on the palate. The only thing that detracts from this brew is the dominant alcohol presence which lessens the drinkability. Still this deserves to be sipped, would be great on a winter day. An excellent brew by any standard."
"This is the highest rated beer I've had the chance to taste, and it only strengthens my faith in the BA community's skill at picking out a winner."
"Tried not to let the high ratings influence mine, but this is one of the best beers I've had."
"This abbey ale is presented in 11.2 oz brown bottle that lists both ""best before"" date and suggested serving temperature. Cheers to that!"
"I don't know if I like it as much as the Westvleteren 12, but given the relative ease of getting the Abt 12 it is a major hit in my book."
"I definately will be looking for more ot this !"
"A fantastic beer, I will enjoy many more of these in years to come."
"It pours a deep murky brown color with a solid 2.5 finger head over top that falls very slowly. The nose is full on raisin and fig character, with a nice spicey character hiding in there as well. The flavor is subdued from the nose a bit. The yeast imparts a creamy character, on top of the sweet raisin and light brown sugar character. Very nice flavor. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. I'm finding it to be a sipping beer. Not something I can drink a whole lot of at a time. I like it. Definately not as good as the same beer off tap. I'll re-rate this one when I have it off tap again. Still a nice brew."
"Overall - A world class beer... not quite up there with the Westy, but not far off..."
"Big bodied; poured out dark brown, cloudy with huge head. The aroma is raisin-chocolately sweet. The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't show until the end of the chalice. The taste is a cross of fruit and choclate mixed with a ton of sweet malt and a touch of brown sugar. It is a brew for all to enjoy. The malty sweetness adds to the thick bready mouthfeel. Just a side note; I find little if any difference between this and Westy 12 IMO."
"Quite nice!"
"This one is hard to approach without high expectations. St Bernardus, the jolly monk(and why not??) holding a chalice glass of the stuff on the label seems to exude glee, and the beer seems to as well. Abt 12, or the blue cap bottle, states simply in English on the back ""Bottle fermented beer."" This bottle poured with a medium head, making it able to pour the full bottle without having to wait for the foam to settle. I was expecting a denser head however, because it did not pour very creamily: more large bubbles than small. The head is a very lightish brown colour, and seemed comfortable and stable as a thin but full topping to the beer. The beer itself is an almost impenetrable ruby-dark brown, appearing near ebony from most angles. Lacing is excellent, leaving thin sheets around the glass that dissipate into islands. The aroma is not very assertive, but when coaxed it is quite delectable. Very sublte dark malting along with black currants and prunes. The sweetness is readily evident in the form of raisins and green apple peel like St Bernardus Tripel. Red wine and red grapes; blueberry; licorice and leather; pears and green apples; and spicy, rummy pepper that tickles the nose. This could almost pass at times for merlot or cabernet wine. A distinct creaminess asserts itself through the whole drink. The aroma is delicious, but not unlike anything I have had before; certainly nothing to make it exceptional for me personally. The taste is full of big flavours: spicy alcohol, rich malts, dark fruits and wine. The front of the tongue senses the red wine taste, tannic and dry. The middle draws out some of the toasted malts, and the finish leaves a balanced nuttiness, equal parts dry and sweet. The carbonation was a little high, and the bottle started to overflow when I popped the cap; not sure why. They have been sitting in my cellar for 2 weeks upright. Far too foamy in the mouth, this bottle. The mouthfeel is still quite thick and lingering however. Drinkability, with the balanced sweetness and small amount of alcohol in the taste, is extremely hight for a gravity such as this. I paired it with brie and 3-year aged cheddar. The brie is mostly overpowered by the beer, but the sharp taste of the aged cheddar could compete and added to the enjoyment and complexity of the beer. I fear these bottles may be a tad defective somehow; not totally, but I think the beer is not at its peak quality-wise. If it IS, though, I have tasted this beer's equal and find it good but not sensational or unique."
"Very fine stuff, I shall be investing in more, but only one at a time for me in a sitting, there's enough within a lone bottle to keep me satiated for the time being. The sign of a fine ale, you know you'd like another one, but it leaves you satisfied enough that you don't need it right now."
"Drinkability: Fabulous. Really, it's that good. I thought this beer may have been over hyped but that is not at all the case. This is a truly magnificent beer. There are no offensive or weird flavors. All of the flavors work well together making this a remarkably drinkable beer. All around this is a wonderful beer."
"World class and kick ass."
"If you are settling in for the 25.4 oz., set away some time for an immense sensory experience. As quads go, this is my favorite, hands down."
"A pretty drinkable brew... just a faint twinge of alcohol in the aftertaste. What a classic."
"It is a beuatiful brown with a tan head that hangs out before becoming spotty. Smells of dark dried fruit and malt sweetness. It has a lovely taste that livens the tongue, close to an earthyness that makes the fruit all the nicer, slightly dry finish that is enhanced by the bold carbonation. A creamy dream of a treat that is worth the time to get to know."
"D&N: Wonderful beer. Really should try this one if you find it."
"This beer definitely deserves the outstanding status it has received."
"definately a fine brew, however i was a little disapointed. i think my expectations may have been built up from such a high rating. if i had 10 dollars and could find it again, i would consider giving it another chance."
"Hazy orange/brown with a decent stand of tan head. Complex aroma consisting of light maltiness, warm alcohol, grassy and citrusy hops, and white wine fruitiness. Bitterness was on the low side, but plenty of grassy hops were present in the flavour, along with a good malt character. Alcohol warmth and a peppery spiciness appeared at the dry finish. Medium body with moderately high carbonation. This beer was definitely aided by warming up a bit. Though it didn't start out poorly, it did become much more pleasant towards the end of the glass. Thanks Viggo."
"The mouthfeel could be a little thicker, I think, but that's the only thing I'd change about this one, and it's very nice as it is. Drinkability is a little low due to the high ABV, but this one is so easy to sip that it could sneak up on you. Quite a nice beer, and one that's definitely worth trying."
"The tale of the Quadrupel is one not told enough. The Bernardus Abt 12 is definitely a fine member of the family. With a dark caramel color, large bubbles and good lacing, it was certainly something to look at. The smell was faint with traces of fruits and alcohol. The taste was similar, with the alcohol maybe coming through a little strong though... covering up some of the delicious citrus. Overall, a good beer. I strongly recommend drinking at the proper temp of 50-55, because the flavor certainly improved as it warmed."
"A truly exceptional beer, world class by all means. It was hard to find any fault in this beer. Definitely worth the $4 I paid for the bottle and something I will never hesitate to pick up again. Cheers."
"Again, the Belgians are never short on balance. Everything is balanced about this beer. From the pour, to the deep, rich color, to the exciting, malty nose, and the taste....orgasmic. Top ten indeed and the cool thing about Belgian beer...it gets better as you drink it but once the glass is finished, you're pissed off because it's gone. These beers are like a woman with PMS...you run the gamut of emotions with each one."
"Pours a very cloudy orange/brown, looks kind of like iced tea, with a thick generous head and lots of lace. Smells very citrusy, a little alcohol is present, little bit of malt, a fruity white wine sort of aroma, very pleasant. The taste is grassy, some alcohol notes, sweet up front with a currant taste, and a spicy finish. This is one beer that has to be at least cellar temperature. It because very noticably better as it warmed up further. Very full creamy mouthfeel, smooth with high carbonation, world class ale."
"Taste: This is possibly the best-tasting beer I've tried to date. If I go fat and bald from drinking this beer, it's worth the price. God bless the monks from Westvleteren, who apparently created the recipe for this beer. God bless also the brewers at Watou who make this intense stuff. The beer is full-bodied, and leaves a coating in your mouth (a good thing). I'm not that good at picking out individual flavors, but I can taste sweet fruity flavors (plums, grapes, and bananas) with malt (chocolate and bread). I poured this below the temperature recommended on the bottle (52-56°F), and I think the taste becomes more intense as the liquid warms."
"Drinkability: If I had another, I'd pour it."
"Cheers!"
"Pours dark brown with an average light brown head with fair lacing and a small dollop remaining in the center as you drink. Aroma is oak nose, caramel malt and yeast mix as well creating a complex invitation to consume. Flavor is warm caramel with alcohol and creamy malt body. Full-bodied and dark palate, very drinkable and warming."
"Overall this beer was as close to perfect for a belgian as you can get. Amazing brew."
"taste was what the aroma hinted at. nice creamy feel with caramel and spice and a slight warmth from the alcohol."
"This was probably the most enjoyed beer I have experienced yet. Poured an unusual dark brown with a purple wine-like hue. Noticeable yeast floaties. The smell immediately reminded me of alter wine. The taste was wonderful. Rich dark fruits. Raisin, Plums and sweet grape. Slight alcohol warmth and breadlike yeast flavor. Very rich, smooth feel in the mouth. I drank this in 10 minutes and felt like I was taking my time with it. I just could not help but to keep sipping away almost continuously. I only had one. I will need to track more down!!"
"Had this with a marinated lamb dish a couple days before Christmas and forgot to review. Everyone at the table was a wine drinker; they were blown away."
"Dark fruits rule here - figs, dates, & plums. Fluffy brown sugar, nuts, and some earthy flavours as well. Very smooth, & enjoyable."
"Oh well, I'll hit this up again... and again!"
"This beer certainly lived up to all of my expectations, and then some. It was a perfect way for me to close out my senior year of college. I would love to try this on tap sometime, since there is a place near me that has it..."
"Okay, I reviewed this beer early on while I was developing my review skills. My score for it then came out at 4.9 and I've been interested in seeing if the beers holds true. Mind you, I just had a Pater 6, so my tastebuds should be primed. The number on the back of this bottle reads 271009. Oops, into the glass went all the sediment. Oh well, it's an abbey ale. Obtained from John's Grocery(Iowa City...and they kept it in a fridge) in May 2005 and consumed about a week later. Pours a 2 finger light brown particulated head over a dark brown particulated liquid. Smells of candi-sugar, alcohol, and chocolate. The alcohol is strong in i) a burning of the nose sense and ii) a volitility aspect that is different and that I can't quite describe. Taste is alcohol with chocolate beneath and a nice nutty finish. Whoa, buddy, this is quite a doozie. The alcohol stands of notice throughout, with a constantly changing and interesting background of malt, spice, and fruit. If the alcohol is the ever-present orchestra, the background is a stage-play of many phenomenal different scenes brought on stage. What the heck is that intriguing spice? It has a pepper and licorice quality about it, but isn't quite either. I've tasted it before, but can't put my finger on it...anise?...but I think more. The end is quite chocolatey, almost fudge-like, but the initial sugar sweet comes to a stark dry finish. Thick mouthfeel and moderately carbonated (a touch more than I would have liked). Nice lacing inside the glass. Really delightful. As the beer warmed, the chocolate became a persistent flavor that rivaled the alcohol. Chocolate carries so many flavors well that this beer was *much* better warm. I recommend drinking this beer between cellar and room temperature."
"It's 2:25 in the afternoon the day after drinking four 11.2 ounce bottles, and I still have a headache. Take it easy with this stuff."
"Drinkability: I drank that bottle down with ease and was ready for a 2nd"
"Quite drinkable for containing such a high amount of alcohol."
"330ml bottle. Thanks Sammy...finally got around to quaffing this bad boy. Pours murky in my goblet... redish- brown highlights when held to the light...lots of sediment in suspension and on the bottom of the bottle. Fat meringue like tan head, which lasts until the last gulp....excellent lacing. Light carbonation... aroma of dark fruits, rum, wine, alcohol and bready malts. Effervescent up front, followed with a complex array of flavors...dried dark fruits, nuts, red grape wine and spicey yeast.... Long finish bread dough, yeasty, almonds and rum in the after taste. As the ale warms in the goblet the malts become cookie dough sweet, spicer and more intoxicating...what a whallop...all ale should be like this."
" Popping the cap from the 11oz bottle releases a flutter of banana-y Belgian yeast aroma. Poured into my Duvel tulip, the beer has a sizeable, one-inch tan head that sticks around for a while. Body is a slightly cloudy, deep mahogany color. Nose is dominated by sweet malt and alcohol, with notes of brown sugar, yeast, and a hint of stone fruit. Palate is very nice - sweet malt is dominant, with notes of clove, allspice, and a very subtle hoppiness. The finish is dominated by warmth from the alcohol, but tempered by a lingering sweetness from the malt. Rich, creamy, warm mouthfeel is as close to perfection as you can get. This beer is an absolute pleasure to drink, even if it takes over an hour to get to the bottom of the glass."
"Malt, grapes, citrus, a wonderful finish. For me tastes and smells are everything I have come to enjoy in this style. Tasty alcohol, accented by its wonderful characteristics. A beer worthy of its rating. Get yourself some."
"The first think you notice about the taste is the warming sensation you get from the liberal amount of alcohol. This is one beer that will knock you down. Very fruity. I detect prunes and other sun-dried fruits. Citric hops in the background. Medicinal qualities abound. Very dry finish, and the carbonation keeps your tongue feeling refreshed. After every sip I would salivate and it would keep my mouth well lubed. Immensely complex and it is obvious care was taken in making this baby. Not entirely drinkable because you are forced to sip this, and one bottle should be enough for a night. Not a session brew, but not meant to be. This was a perfect compliment to my last day of classes for the year."
"Slàinte!"
"Fantasic experience with this highly-touted Belgian. Pours a monster head that lingers all night. Smell is of alcohol and grains. Taste is of cloves and chocolate. Extremely sweet, almost cola-like. I made the mistake of mixing this in the middle of session brews and woke up with one hell of a headache! Sip this baby by itself, and you're in for quite a treat, indeed..."
"Pours a raisin brown with a frothy off-white head that diminishes to form a skim coat, and some yeasty floaters. Smells of tart fruity esters, candy sweetness, apples and plums, bready, vinous alcohol notes. Tastes much the same. Initially very malty and sweet, becoming more fruity and vinous in character. Lots of bready banana yeast, sugary sweet mixed with a spicy hop bite, and a lingering vinous alcohol aftertaste. Medium thick, moderate carbonation. This is what I envision a quad to be: sweetness, estery, spicy, vinous character and noticeable alcohol. A nearly perfect brew."
"Pours a deep brown with some deep red hue with a big creamy head leaving nice sheets of lace behind,aromas of dark sweet cherries and some smoke along with a some spice very appetizing.Silky smooth mouthfeel, creamy and not to heavy goes down with ease,what can you say complex and great some spiced cherries and spice along with some raisin with a faint smokiness the alcolhol shows itself more as it warms.Just an awesome beer have sampled many times was great to aquire a bottle,worthy of its high marks awesome."
"Thin, cream head with a constant burst and replacement plan going on. Mahogany, warm brown hue but it could not be seen through. Big malt nose with peat moss and other earthy tones, bread crust. Scrumptious balance of hops and malt, though I tasted more of the latter than the former, and a serious alcohol hit of heat. Crisp and slightly tart mouth feel. Truly a great offering, this is one I would gladly have again and again."
"Full-bodied, with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Never gets cloying. A wonderful beer!"
"The taste is spicy with lots of complexity. Lots of fruit flavors hit your mouth- fig, banana, and plum flavors come out. Wonderful aftertaste, and the complexity and flavor hides the ABV although it can be noticed. This is a truly great beer that I may not be worthy of. I prefer it to any Belgian beer that I have had to date (pretty much everything but Westy at this point). I would highly recommend it to others."
"Wow what a beautiful beer! It poured perfectly into a chalice with a thick silky head that looked like a cappuccino and once the sediment poured out it looked like cinnamon on top. The head glistened and had a subtle sound believe it or not. Dark brown color and a wonderful nose make all your senses go crazy. You must let this beer warm to fully appreciate its depth and range of flavors. Chocolate malt, honey and subtle spices in a silky seductive package. I paired it with a blue cheese and this beer cleaned my palate perfectly. It is like a bolder Rochefort 10, which does not mean better  just stronger flavors. Excellent."
"Note: after trying the St. Bernardus 6, 8, tripel, and Abt 12, I am thouroughly impressed and enamored with this beer. Absolutely top notch in every respect, and impossible to pick a favorite. Thanks again Gabe for sharing."
"It makes a difference."
"A winner in my book, and perhaps my overall favorite ale."
"Cloudy hue somewhere between copper and burgundy, under a one finger beige head that settles quickly at first, then lingers as very thick film across the top of the liquid for a very long time. I see a few strands of lace, but the head is not very sticky and lacks a bit in body. The nose is just right - not overpowering and not mild. Fruit is the main impression, with yeast and barley backing that up. The mouth is very well carbonated and slightly viscous - not heavy, but there is a coating sensation on the tongue. The taste is sublime, smooth bready malt, a touch of fruity twang, a hint of hoppy bitterness. The alcohol is well concealed, but not invisible. We've got great balance here in a beer that cannot be enjoyed in quantity on a given night, but can be enjoyed on many given nights."
"Fully bodied, drinkability was only on the average side."
"The high alcohol content does not hurt this beer; you will not even realize you are drinking alcohol. This is a very drinkable beer that everyone needs to try."
"Correction on the head: the second pour produced a very nice head."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite beers. I could drink this all night long... at least until the alcohol caught up with me. An awesome beer."
"Pours a very dark magohany with a large foamy tan head that looks amazing and laces very well. Aroma or cherries, banana, dark fruits, very good. Taste was a sweet roasted malt and fruits, with some alcohol (tastefully) in the finish, also some smokiness and hops in the finish, a very complex finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, lots of carbonation and the alcohol gets a little strong as it warms. This is very drinkable, but it is gonna hit me."
"Re-Rate 3/15/05: Head was a little soap-sudsy this time, pretty sure it wasn't my glass. Body has a lot of dark red in it with hints of deep purple. Smell hit me as oaky anise with blackberries and cotton candy. Flavor is a plum-wine with a spicy, semi-dry finish reminiscent of some red wines. Perhaps last time I did not allow it to warm sufficiently, because the feel is very smooth and marshmallowy with only that little spicy bite. Very drinkable. A balance between brightness and darkness. Fruity but deep. Light feel but substantial malt and sugar presence."
"Hazy medium brown, more of a tea-color hue with some off-red highlights. A thick, well defined white bubbly head gives way to well formed cloying bubbles that stick with great dedication to the sides of the chalice. Fresh fruit, malts, raisins, traces of alcohol, and some port/wine notes on the nose; very nice. An initial on-slaught of delightful flavorings  plums, raisins, licorise and sweet malts; full bodied and borderline chewy. Further warming evolves figs, grapes and pears; even further into the flavoring reveals a slight hop-based backbone, brown sugar, grapes and even some coffee beans. The ABV at 10% is spot-on, its noticeable, but in a good way. Rich and full flavored, a thing of beauty!"
"Final thoughts: This is without a doubt an exceptional beer. As with all quadrupels I've had so far though; the serving temperature is a very delicate thing and could have a great impact on the smell, taste and mouthfeel. Not having had the Westvleteren 12 yet, I'd say this beer is only outclassed by the Rochefort 10 in its style, wich is a little more full, round and bold still. Nevertheless though, this brew is close to perfection and great in its own ways. World Class!"
"I just wanted to say that I had this beer on tap and it doesn't quite stand up to the bottle version, which is unusual. Not quite as creamy and frothy, not the same velvety mouthfeel, not as rich and sweet in flavor and I can taste the alcohol a bit more. It's still a great beer, don't get me wrong. But the bottle conditioned verision of this masterpiece is on a different level."
"peace."
"Absolutely wonderful. Dangerously drinkable. I always wait for the end of the evening to partake of one of these, since seconds might have unforseen consequences....like thirds."
"Drinkability: A wonderful sipper by the fire"
"Notes: Its like liquid love, I need to stock up on this one."
"I had this long ago when it was St. Sixtus, and I remember the St. Sixtus being better, but that doesn't seem possible. I've tried to be constructive, but this beer won me over. I feel spoiled drinking it. Hoo-wah!"
"Pours a beautiful hazy brown body, with mahogany red highlights, and a creamy head, gorgeous lacing. Aromas of cloves, spices, fruit and malt. Taste was amazing. Cloves, rich sugar, dark fruits, tremendous malt backbone, and hops to balance. Alcohol is hidden behind the sweetness and phenols. Smooth and full bodied, creamy as anything I've ever had. Great beer to sip after dinner."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown/black color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. It boasts of pale and crystal malts; very complex. The taste is good. It has a very smooth and rich malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very enjoyable brew with loads of flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"This is an awesomely constructed beer, which is all about balance and perfection, which it nearly achieves."
"33cl. bottle: I finally got around to trying one of these. It pours a cloudy, brown color. There was some off-white head to it, which died down fairly rapidly. The aroma was not quite as strong as I would have expected. Very pleasant, but a hair lighter. The aroma is rich and complicated. There are many kinds of fruits in the mix, but the complexity is making it hard for determining individual notes. The taste is superb. A complicated sweetness, with a tart underlying flavor. Fruits, caramel, heaven. Superb."
"Easily the best Belgian I have had. Tremendous! One I will certainly go back to for special occasions."
"This is a very delicious and highly drinkable beer. At $8.99 for a 750ml bottle an excellent value. I plan to stock up on this one."
"Find it, buy it, enjoy it. Treat it with respect."
"probably my 10-20th bottle lifetime of this stuff and i will not stop consuming it. never tried it (or westy 12) aged significantly, and that will be my next step in its appreciation. look forward to it."
"as i watched it fall from bottle to glass it was brown, but it sits a very dark deep brown, almost black in the glass. the greatest highlight of this beer for me was watching the head sit a good thumbs liength above the top of the glass with out any of it running down the sides, it jsut sat there happy as could be, pillowing above the glass, providing quite a sight. it has a murky brown color as it lessens in the glass and more light is allowed to pass through. i smell grass, malty sweetness, pepper, alcohol, and pears. tastespeppery, wet horsblanket taste that is oh so popular this year, wiht an aftertaste of booze and pepper. bubbly at first which seems to fade somewhat quickly perhaps i swirled it in the glass to many times. also hints of fruit (peas, current, depnding on the sip) and grassy ntoes blending together with the horse blanket taste. surprisingly light in the mouth, and very drinkable, but as i have been rereading some of my reviews lately, i think everything is drinkable, it seems that i would almost always take another. but this doesnt lend much in the way of the 10% abv, or overbearing tastes of some belgians."
"I had this ale on tap at The Map Room in Chicago recently. What I anticipated before hand was enhanced two fold after tasting this brew. It was served in the proper brewery glass and had such a nice head on it that I had to look at it for a while before finally lifting the glass for a sip. Presentation is really important to fulfilling desire and I think that this was one of the best looking beers I have had served to me ever. When I took that first sip I knew that this was something to be savored for a while. Nice rounded malt sweetness and smooth strength. Creamy sweet soft and chewy. Nice lingering aftertaste, like sucking on a piece of candy. WOW."
"no problem drinking several of these. not even a little"
"Final Thought: Belgian ales are still new to me, but through time I may appreciate them more, and review this one again. Big ups to the Prior 8 from this brewery."
"Humm alway's a good beer and my closer for tonight. Had quiet some different styles today but quadruppel is always something else. Presance is more then ok and head is overwelming staying long. Smell of ripe fruit( apricot) and flowers do you remind that this is from near westvleteren. Nice combination of everything that your tung& nose can detect in this brew. Sweetfruity, fullmalty and a subtile bitter seem to dominate so. Just to say, what a mouthfull there is in every tiny litle sip. One of the better beers you can get in Belgium, one thats in my cellar permantly however once in a while a botle gets renewed, what a pleasance!"
"This is a pretty strong Belgian Ale. The lacing on this is excellent. A very dark brown. When held up to the light, it barely passes through. Very dark. The smell has hints of green apple. Very sweet smelling. The taste contained a variety of flavors. At first a malty nutty taste. The aftertaste contained hints of bannanas. Very foamy feeling in your mouth. Quite filling. Very good try for anyone interested in trying some of the best of the best. Would highly recommend."
"Very drinkable on a cool night when something special is called for."
"Drinkability is perfect for this type of style, look out for the ten percent."
"In tradition of the holy bible, I hereby damn John's Grocery in Iowa City for tempting me with this forbidden fruit. Anything as good as a fine Belgian beer has got to be a sin."
"Had this on tap at Redbones, the fine Somerville establishment, very reasonably priced I might add. The body was a dark, caramel brown with little head, perhaps it dissipated as it was filled to the brim. The nose is figgy and/or raisin? Nice. My first thought is wow, what a taste explosion. Then I immediately notice the syrupy, full mouthfeel. This is quite obviously a world class beer. I find there are a bunch of flavors vying for number one here; brandy/raisin/fig/and a candy sweetness. The finish is fantastic, wonderfully quenching with an incredible penetrating sweetness that forever lingers. Tremendous beer, I can see what all the fuss is about."
"Wow. This beer tastes good, but I wasn't in the mood for it at all. Come to think of it, I haven't been in the mood for Malty-and-Not-Hoppy beer in a while. In time, when I drift back over to the other end of the spectrum, I'll be enjoying the heck out of some St. Bernardus ABT12"
"*Note: Also, it's *damn* drinkable for a quadrupel."
"on tap, (gotta love the Blind Tiger!) This gem poured dark brown, and murky. minimal head, but leaves well developed lacing. Multiple layers of flavor going on here, fruity, malty, yeasty. complex and intriguing, warrming but not overpowering in strength, body or flavor. the genius here is that its so drinkable. seek out savor and enjoy."
"I'm am forevever in debt to a great man, GClarkage. Thank you my friend, I owe you for this one."
"Tastes and smells are variables quickly during the tasting."
"Pours a cloudy, muddy mahogany...great nose...big cookie doughalso some sweet fruits....perhaps watermelon..also black cherries...plums..a hint of molasses as well..Body is rich and eloquent...spicy alcohol evident but it fits nicely with the rich flavors...carbonation is jacked up...that fits nicely too...flavors are sweet dark fruit maltiness acented wit ha candy sugar like sweetness...finishes creamy and smooth...as I drink this I realize this is the big dog...this is a true heavy hitter....I am in possession of a fantastic beverage...better than any of the Westy stuff I've had which is saying something and the best of the 3 I've had from this brewery...."
"This is a gobsmackingly delicious brew, quite possibly the best I've ever had. If you get the chance to try it and don't, you'll regret it."
"for a beer with the ABV of 10% this is extremely smooth. This may not be the greatest belgian I have tasted but it holds its own as a very solid beer in every single category when you go to tally up your scores. good stuff."
"Pours very nicely, and the head hangs on. It's lacey and bubbly -- not chunky or rocky. Smell and color are super and the taste is out of this world. You get the dark roasted coffee, the nutty and buttery notes, the dark chocolate ... the works. This is beer that has depth *and* complexity. Highly recommended."
"This gem of a beer pours a dark cloudy brown, so dark and thick you can't see light through it, and produces a huge foamy head which goes down slowly leaving some lacing. Its aroma contains hints of spice, cherries and a red wine character which I liken to a fine Merlot. The taste was the best part of this beer by far. At first you are introduced to a rich coffee and chocolate flavor which later yields to fruitiness. There are also hints of light spicing and roasted malt which comes towards the end. In the mouth this beer had the texture and richness of good coffee. At the same time it was creamy and smooth. The aftertaste left a nice thick coating on the mouth. The only thing I didn't like about this beer was a sense of grittiness in the front of the mouth in the aftertaste, otherwise, this offering was probably the best I've sampled so far. I'd definitely have another!"
"The color of this Belgium Trappist was, medium dark brown, with a fair amount of light tan foam and no lace. The smell of fruit and malts, with a hint of yeast filled the nose. The taste had a soft fruitiness with just a touch of a sweet/sourness to balance out this Belgium Abbey Ale. The balance of malts, hops and yeast has made this brown ale a very pleasant trappist."
"I am indebted to SpileDriver for having this gem available on-tap. Simply stellar."
"Murky brown in color with a foamy tan head. The aroma is malty and bready, with a dark fruit smell. The flavor is bready, malt, and alcoholic. It has a fruity, boozy flavor in the finish. It has a nice sweetness throughout, not overpowering, but just right. It is a bit wine-like in the flavor as well. It is full-bodied and warming. You know this one is strong from the get go. I very nice Belgian, and I am sure I will visit her over and over again. A definite must try."
"Served on draft in a St. Bernardus chalice. A lovely deep mahogany body with a rocky cream head which stayed throughout the entire (long) drink and left persistent lacing on the glass. Hypnotic dark fruit and spicy alcohol aromas which were nearly intoxicating by themselves. Fantastically complex dark fruit and spice flavors. The alcohol comes through quite clearly, but is carefully blended with the fruits and spices so that a dark, mellow, and delicious vinous quality ensues. Very rounded and creamy body (more creamy and smooth than the bottled version). Very strong, but surprisingly easy-drinking on draft, perhaps because it's smoother than the the bottled variant."
"50 cl bottle. A large alcohol presence follows in the warming contributed from this beer. It doesn't sneak up on you, it smacks you in the face and dares you to drink more..."
"This is probably the closest beer to barleywine that I would consider drinkable."
"This was just superb. I'll be meeting more of these."
"Taste: Spicy with an alcohol bite. Sour cherries cloaked in brandy. Tastes like a ripe yellow fruitcake with dried sour cherries and almonds, and almond extract, and candied citrus peels. Nice chewy semolina cake flavors, soaked in lite-brown sugar simple syrup, and a touch of brandy. I shouldn't be allowed to drink this bottle this fast."
"The flavor was all about malt, caramel and vinous though it hid the alcohol well. Though full bodied in the mouth and dangerously drinkable, nothing really special emerged until the end. As it warmed up I really liked the butterscotch tones with shades of Almond Roca that developed in the bottom. Should have kept my hands around the glass longer."
"A thick, creamy-white head sits atop a murky brown liquid. The head is stable and constantseemingly able to float on top forever. Thick rocks of lace dot the glass. If youre anywhere near the glass, the aroma of spice, yeast, fruit, and alcohol are sure to hit you. It makes me think of blackberries and cherries, soaked in alcohol. Intense alcohol warming. The taste is spice and candy. Smooth, substantial, and relaxing are words to describe this beer. The essence of a contemplative brew."
"Mouthfeel is good as well, this has a good body to it...but just a tad too much carbonation for my taste. The drinkability is excellent as each sip seems different from the last and it keeps you wanting to come back for more. A very good brew that I hope to try on tap sometime as well...seek this one out."
"Prosit!"
"A sheer monster, this is a beer you should not pass up."
"33 cl bottle. Pours a deep, hazed chestnutty brown color with a fluffy, light tan head in the St. Bernardus chalice. Earthy (bark and peat) and malty aromas, healthy yeasty nose, and some faint fruitiness (fig, prune, dates) and spices (cinnamon, ginger and anise). Luxurious in the tongue, heavy malt and fine carbonation give a creamy mouthfeel. Slightly malty sweet, but subtle fruity qualities and a fine yeastiness compact the overall impression of the taste into a fever pitch. This beer is about as close as you might get to a trappist without it being labeled as such. It's impression lasts throughout the duration of the drinking experience. ABV seems hidden well amongst it's complexity."
"I cetainly give this beer high marks for drinkablity, which is both complimentary and hypothetical, as the 10% abv demands that this beer be consumed in moderation, or suffer the consequences. Poured a murky, rootbeer brown. Creamy, rocky head and spicy aroma, both yeast and alcohol. Spicy on the tongue, with an unusual dark flavor lurking in the background - not soy sauce, but something akin to that in the manner of a dark, fermented flavor, but more tannic, like flavors leached from a wooden ageing cask. Obviously couldn't put my finger on it, but it was both interesting and pleasant. Other dark flavors from overripe orchard fruit, and a touch of prune. One of the best of the style, in my humble opinon."
"What's not to love about St. Bernardus? This is the gemstone of their line in my opinion."
"This is a great brew that lives up to its reputation."
"When poured, the beer looked a bit messed up, but it became greatly silky after letting it on its own for a few seconds. I can see me in the body, which mades me think it is opaque. The head doesn't disappear until the beer is drunk. Nice. The smell is partly reminiscent of the prior 8. Light hints of red fruits, some peanut butter, and a grassy grapefruit and chocolate aspect. The taste is a bit nutty and shows interesting notes of almost burnt caramel and chocolate with deep wooden notes.Lightly fruity, with some sweetness. Mouthfeel is amazing, an incredible smoothness and creaminess. Very full and round in the mouth. Almost as drinkable as a 10% beer can be. The real experience is the mouthfeel."
"ng"
"This beer poured dark and lovely with a tan head with wierd brown flecks. The nose is dank abbeys and dried fruit. The taste is pure heaven, as all those subtle esters that make up Belgian strong ales are blended in such a way that the whole is greater than the parts. LIke Westy 12 and Rochefort 10 this is a beer to contemplate and sip. Have a slice of strong cheese and enjoy."
"Buddy at the table who tends to try everything I get said he noticed saki tastes. I don't know that I have ever had saki, so I will just have to take his word on that one. He did enjoy it enough to grab a glass for himself though!"
"Comments: This reminded me quite a bit of the Westy 12. While its flavors are very good and extremely well blended, for me there was not as much interaction between the flavors as compared to, for example, the Malheur 12 or the Rochefort 10. Perhaps this really isnt the case for other people and its just how my taste buds respond to these different quadrupels, but I prefer the various flavors to come through over time as opposed to all at once. Therefore, as of this moment, I prefer the Malheur 12 and Rochefort 10 over the St. Bernardus Abt 12 and the Westy 12. However, it is an enjoyable beer nevertheless."
"Very nice beer here. At three and a half bucks a bottle, not something I'm gonna stock my fridge with, but probably something I'll keep around. For the flavor and feel itself, I think this one is a very drinkable beer, but not something you'd probably want to drink one after another of."
"This was a good, solid beer. Not a mind-blowing experience, but very enjoyable."
"The alcohol is warming, but a bit strong. The taste is a glorified quad, with everything you'd expect but so much better. The taste is malty and chewy with cloves, sugar cane, an (licorice?)... Very good brew."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy brown colored beer with what can only be describe as huge foamy super resistant head (do I need to mention perfect carbonation). Aroma is quite complex with some great roastiness and some strange mix of spices. Great roasty taste with a side of spiced plums. I could not detect any alcohol, which is quite a wonder at 10%. Wow, Im now glad I bought quite a few so that I can cellar some."
"Overall: A world-class, dark Belgian ale. I could drink this all the time and never tire of it. Simply a magnificent beer for Belgian lovers."
"Pineapple and lime fruit abound in fashion with the St. Bernardus tripel. Alcoholic donuts soaked in tea and carrot cake finish it all off. What?"
"Notes: This beer should be taken out of the fridge for a while before consuming. It's so much better just a few degrees below room temp. A magnificent creation and as close to the perfect beer as I've ever tasted. Drink it. Know it. Love it."
"This has been in the fridge a bit, and I thought tonite: I need to do some cleaning, so here goes. Upon the initial pour, I got some aromas I thought were a bit off,, but as the glass warms it smooths out a bit. Initial impresiion is of dark, dark toffee color topped with a latte colored head. The aroma...I am still picking up an earthy, almost cocoa powder note. There's some alcohol hanging out alongside. The taste helps out quite a bit however...cocoa powder, dark fruit, some spiceyness in the finish. Light but still medium mouthfeel. A nice treat, but not one I will go for that often. While very good, perhaps this one would benefit from some aging. Looks like the bottle is telling me that it would be good till 2005, maybe I should have saved it till then. I am looking for a bit more blend and meld in the flavor."
"As with all Abby Ales, this poured with a big thick head. There was a distinct lace after a brief period that stayed with the glass throughout the entire tasting. The color was a deep chocolate brown. The aroma is of spice and candy; quite surprising actually. The taste has a hint of the candy present in the nose with some roasted grain up front. On the back you get a subtle impression of the alcohol, and a mild lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium, not too heavy. The drinkability is good, I could have a few more of these, and will. I have 3 more in the fridge."
"then the first taste. The alcohol hit prematurely, and the beer lay flat on my tongue like a bad kisser. The bananas in the nose did not ever hit the palate. The finish was almost foul, causing me to make a bit of an onion smelling face with each sip. Some may call blasphome (sp), but I failed to finish the beer. I may blow another $4.00 on this beer, but only on sheer curiosity, because the beers reputation was not met, and perhaps I had a bad bottle. I will be more than happy to post a better review if this beer makes a better showing"
"Very nice roasted brown color. Light milk chocolate colored head, which stays with the full glass, and is creamy and thick. Alcohol jumps out at you and covers the palate. Nice blend of chocolate malt which quickly smoothes out the alcohol bite. The finish leaves a tingle on the tongue, which is a lasting reminder of a great drink. Powerful and great tasting beer."
"This poured out a dark thick opaque brown color with a good sized beige head that has great retention. This also left a wonderful coating of lace around the glass as it was consumed. Big complex aroma here with dark sweet fruit malts standing out the most with notes of alcohol, some spice and yeast. There is more going on than that but I am unable to tell exactly what the wonderful scents are, I will defiantly need to get a few more of these to enjoy and analyze. Up front with the taste is sweet fruity malt flavors mingling with a bit of spice. The taste is very smooth and it defiantly warms you up a good deal. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with excellent carbonation and a dry finish, basically perfect. Drinkability is only hindered by ones tolerance for 10% beers besides that its so smooth and delicious I could try and drink this all day. Excellent beer that is recommended to everyone."
"A candy texture and nutmeg on the palate."
"note: a very good beer at a good price... 6.49 at sams wine in chicago"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Blood red pour with a beautiful towering foamy head fed by an onrush of ultra fine bubbles that are like champagne. The head is immortal. The aroma is sweet cherries with the uniquely earthy Belgian yeast strain. The taste at first sip is an explosively spicy alcohol. After that initial attack, other flavors start to emerge. The most notable of these is a lingering hop bitterness that is much stronger than most other beers that fall under the broad umbrella of Belgian styles. The bitterness is not overpowering in any way, and allows the fruitiness of the malt to open up in the background. I imagine as this fresh beer settles down, the character would become more malty and complex, and thanks to the new Georgia law allowing this elixir to enter our fair state, I can find out how it will age without much problem. This beer packs a heck of a punch at 10% ABV. After the 330 ml bottle is downed, there is a fire in the belly that radiates out to the extremities. Very drinkable, even at this potency. I WILL be having more."
"Overall this is very damn good, I'm glad I've aged it, but I would also like to try it a little fresher than this. I'd have to say that this bottle is damn near 2 years old, date worn off of the cage, but I recall it being 02. Very impressed, can't wait to have the opportunity to have this again"
"It is amazing how smooth this beer is. I had a very difficult time distinguishing any individual flavor in this beer and not because it was crafted blandly. It is profound how complex and well balanced the flavors are in this beer. I kept guessing at each sip. When the beer was gone, I still hadn't written anything substantial as to the elements of the flavor. Its just a perfect, smooth balanced taste. I had a hard time drinking it slowly."
"The cork shot off at about 50 mph when I removed the cage, good thing I didn't have my head over the bottle! It poured a reddish brown color with a medium sizd off white head and nice lacing. Aroma of banana, clove, grapes and raisins, while the taste is very strong in the dark fruit department. Alcohol is also slightly noticeable and it had a carbonated mouthfeel. Fruitier than the Westy 12, and I enjoy that one better."
"You certainly couldn't drink many of these. I'd probably only have one. However it is an enjoying sipper for that one. Was definitely worth trying, and I'm not huge on Belgians in general."
"A lively brown pour with a medium head. The nose is semi-sweet with a touch of tartness and light spice. Medium bodied with hints of over-ripened fruit such as plum and raisin. There's a brown sugar sweetness and a dry finish accompanied by woody notes. Very nice mouthfeel, both lively and fresh and a little alcohol kick on the finish. A very, very good beer."
"Reddish brown colored, with orangey highlights and unappetizing dark chunks of ""stuff"" suspended and floating. Head rises up high and is a color of dark beige with tight bubbles that make noise as they pop and recede. A thin cap of lace is left on top with sheets of bubbly film rising up the edges of the glass. Aroma is sweet and fruity, of fig and raisin and currant. Some spice and orange peel as well, and a bit of clove. Also I detect some of the alcohol in the nose. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Flavor is rich and sweet, not cloying, but close to it. There is caramel and toffee, sweet cinnamon and plum, and a bit of alcohol in the finish. No strong yeast flavors, but a little too rich to be very drinkable for me."
"Super drinkable, at $5 a bottle it could get to be an expensive habit."
"The taste is of an apple pie or apple cider. sweet with the bitterness of apples, the sweetness of caramel. The spiciness gives it the little bite. Raisins are also a strong flavor. This is one of the most perfect dessert beers ever."
"Mouth is sweet and sticky. Really smooth for 10% ABV. This is excellent but could be aged just a bit to blend the alcohol flavors better. Lived up to the hype for me..."
"Mouth feel is what I would consider to be the lowest ranking part of the beer. It is NOT bad, but doesn't match up to the rest of the beer. Good carbonation that glides around the mouth, but the beer is just the slightest bit punishing on the tounge. The alcohol digs in quite a bit. Regardless, this beer is exceptionally delicious and makes a good night on it's own."
"Update two: I've had a number of these now, and they've ranged from amazing to flat and stale. This beer is hit or miss. If you get a good, you've got one of the best beers on Earth."
"I enjoyed this brew, but I've had better from the same style (Grimbergen immediately comes to mind). The subtle fusels and oxidized, ruddy middle hurt it's drinkability. As it warms, it becomes a much better beer."
"7.3 years later and just yeasty and sweetish."
"Drinkability?!? Man, I need to slow down and enjoy this work of brewery art. It is a fantastic Abbey ale and a must for all to try!"
"It's a great beer, there's not much question about that."
"This is a beer of great artistry and poise with a judicious balance of lush malty sweetness and muscular verve. Im beginning to think these monks are really onto something. I wonder if I might look good in a brown robe?"
"Finally got myself a bottle of this. This beer is amazing. As soon as the brew hit my crystal goblet all I said was, ""Oh damn!"" as a frothy tan head rose to the top. Excellent lacing on the glasss. What a great smell. Complex malts with fruity hints. The taste is so sweet and smooth. Very drinkable IMO. The 10%abv is very suddle. This may be one of the best beers I've ever tried."
"Thanks to Prostman for the samples!"
"Drinkability: Who cares if this is 10% ? If I could, I'd bring them one after another all evening. Really one of the most profound beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. I wish they were less expensive here in the U.S. Awesome."
"This beer is for special occasions, and worth it. Enjoy!"
"It's a keeper."
"This is an excellent and very drinkable brew! The only reason I would not drink more than one... I would rather save it for a better occasion."
"Beautiful pour, two fingered head, great lacing. Smells and tastes exquisite, smooth and complex, almost like a fine wine. The box says ""bringing heavenly nectar within reach"". Well put. This beer is heavenly. I LOVED this beer. I bought a four pack and it set me back about 15 bucks, but I could drink this all day long."
"Drinkability has to be slightly graded down in that it's 10%abv. Making this a session beer could land you in serious trouble, but God, it goes down so easy!"
"Pours a beautifully deep red color with a very nice head that tends to linger the whole way down the glass.Nice aroma-malty.Vinuous and winey.Notes of port,raisens,yeast.Wonderful flavor. A slight malt sweetness. Hints of black currants,port. Very slight trace of alchohol.Terriffic mouthfeel-full bodied and somewhat oily.Very,very smooth.A great beer it really is.One of the best Belgians I have had. Really a nice beer indeed. Well worth seeking out."
"IMHO: This is a truly great beer. A great balance of desirable characteristics -- not overwhelming. I feel unqualified to give it the great review it deserves."
"This dark ruby brown beer has an enormous rocky head and lots of flavor. Its aroma is spicy, fruity, and yeasty while, it is very complex in taste. Anise, cinnamon, prune, fig, and raisin are just some of the flavors present. It finishes with a slight dry spiciness. A great beer worth seeking out."
"Gotta love the monk on the label. After drinking this you'll have a smile on your face just like that monk does. Poured out a light muddy brown with quite a bit of carbonation in this beer. Smell was mostly matls and dark fruits with an ever so sight wiff of alochol. Taste was extremely complex. Fruit hits the palate first with some malts and finishes with a nutty aftertaste and a little dry. But goes down so easy and it's so smooth. I'm so glad my local store got this beer finally. Just an awesome beer."
"Straight into a Chimay chalice, this displays a bottle-conditioned (floating yeast particules) deep brown hue with a sticky light beige off-white head. Aroma is extremely yeasty, brown chocolate in an ocean of yeast, pure cookie dough along with caramel.. It smells sweet and brown. Taste is candi sugar, brown chocolate, hugely malty, but even more so intensively yeasty with a bit of bananas, prunes and plums and a light restrained alcohol bite. Body is medium and creamy. Wow, this is so yeasty, I wouldn't expect this from myself, but maybe too much for its own good. A very generous and potent complex beer nevertheless and I can't wait to re-rate from a 750."
"Of all the qualities that stand out in a big beer, smoothness is very often overlooked, but not in this case. Simply, it's a smooth blend of sweet and savory balance. The flavor is all I want it to be, keeping one's attention with the interplay between all the individual pieces. The high ABV is well mitigated by everything else this excellent ale has to offer, though it does raise a wisely heeded flag of caution. Anyway, I'd likely stop at one big bottle because with anything this good, you should want to be able to savor, fully and consciously, every sip you take."
"From the familiar smiling monk 33 cl bottle marked best consumed before 2005 and with notches cut out on the 1, 2, 4, 7 along the bottom of the bottle. Poured a beautiful deep brown/light brown with a deep tan head. When held up to a light the beer turns a nice amber color around the edges. The smell is amazing. This has to be one of my favorite smelling beers. A malty raisin sweetness rises from the glass. This is one enjoyable beer to drink. There are a lot of flavors present with some bold fruit tastes evident at first before gently yielding to a pleasant maltiness. It is very hard to taste any alcohol even as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy which lends to this beers incredible drinkability. This is one of my favorite beers and definitely worth a try."
"The taste is, however, its disappointing factor because the complexity of its fruityness is opaqued by its intense bitter malty feel that approach it more to a kwak like brew than a top notch dark belgian. The body is also a little weak for the style- not dense enough."
"Possibly the best beer I've ever had. I'm sure this is expensive in the U.S., although I picked up a bottle here in Paris for only 2.30. It doesn't really matter, because it's worth every cent. Incredibly complex, incredibly drinkable  the closest to a perfect beer I've ever had."
"First sip reveals a very creamy texture and mild carbonation. Flavor is fruity sweet cherry, pear plum up from and fades to a big tangy hit of yeastiness. Finish is peppery and I get some alcohol warming on the way down. Very tasty brew and complex. Even with the warming factor this beer is very easy to drink!"
"Drinkability: Pretty darn exquisite. I could see myself having a few more of these, and the price kicks ass."
"Not quite perfect, but Bloody Hell its really chuffin close to it."
"A dark ruby color with a very thick off-white head. Leaves behind a nice lacing and adds a beautiful looking brew. Smells of dark malts, strong spices, and a fruitiness. Silky smooth blend of spices (cloves come to mind), fruit flavors, and strong malts. The alcohol isn't overally noticable and will sneak up on you. Aftertaste is a lingering fruity taste with that strong feeling a smooth creamy beer. Great beer for the style. This is something I'll be looking for again."
"Red/brown with a thick tan head in my Chimay chalice. Bready, fruity aroma. Taste is sweet, yeasty and sour, with some fruit notes and a dry and slightly bitter finish, perhaps due to the high level of carbonation. Very light on the palate and extremely drinkable. Maybe a little bit of smokiness as the beer warms. Some cloves too. An excellent, complex and beautiful beer."
"Served from an 11.2 oz bottle, in a Duvel tulip. Upon pouring, a stiff rocky tan head formed, which was decorated with nutmeg colored particles. When the head receded, an intricate lacing pattern was left behind. The dark ruddy-brown beer was very cloudy and riddled with particulates. The sharp nose was malty and quite fruity, with notes of cherry, raisin, and coconut, with a wisp of alcohol sneaking through. The full-bodied and slighty fluffy beer was a delight for the taste buds. The fantastic slightly tart malt backbone faintly resembled a Flemish brown and was accompanied by notes of cherry, cinnamon, and banana, with a fairly dry finish. The collection, strength, and balance of flavors was perfection. No wonder why the fellow on the bottle is so happy!"
"This beer poured a dark hazy brown. Looked like fresh apple cider, but with a giant tan head that would not go down. I had to wait almost 5 mins before I could take a sip. But it was so worth the wait. The smell was sweet and malty. Very fruity, especially banana. But not real banana, like the banana flavor of banana gum or ice cream. The taste was also laden with the banana flavor, but mixed with sweet malt and other fruits flavors as well as spices like clove and perhaps nutmeg. I found the alcohol to be hidden well, although I guess some would disagree. The mouthfeel was creamy and thick. Carbonation was much less biting than I expected considering the huge head it produced when poured. Drinkability was also great. I wouldn't expect it to be with a high abv like this, but I can't help myself. The taste is so good that I must have another. To me beer just doesn't get much better than this. I will definatly buy this again."
"11.2 oz bottle sampled on 12/30/03, out of a St Bernardus goblet that came with the four bottle sampler pack purchased that day in Blacksburg, Virginia(Vintage Cellar had 4 or 5 left then). In addition to the smiling Monk on the label, is a ""best before date"" in Flemish, French, and a couple other languages, that tell you to drink it before the end of 2005. Okay, I'll bite. Didn't know at the time of sampling if I would last into 2004. The Belgian ale pours into the goblet a deep, dark brown, almost opaque. The head is enormous, beige, and frothy with an abudance of tiny bubbles. Lacing slowly climbs down the glass. The aroma is of a classic brown Belgian strong ale. Bigtime Bananas in the nose, followed by the spice cabinet of coriander and allspice. Medium bodied in the mouth, tart, and a lot of carbonation. Taste begins tart and spicy. The alcohol is not well disguised. Plenty of earthy Belgian yeast notes are also on the palate. The tart fruits(grapes and plums on steroids) ride a solid malt backbone to a smooth, yet powerful finish. Very good ale, and worthy of its lofty rating. Personally, I prefer the St Bernardus Pater 6. The alcohol in the 12 is just a bit too overpowering."
"My 100th beer karma point.... hmmm what should I say about this that hasn't already been said? Not much, really. I will say I was a little surprised in that this bottle didn't seem as 'ripe' as it could have been. I regret not lettng it age some before trying it. Raisins, hops, cloves, banana aroma and notes... nice balance overall. I can't wait to try Westy 12 after this..."
"An incredibly satisfying beer. The flavors all meld so well; no one flavor washes out any other. Almost indescribable in its drinkability. A masterpiece of a beer and the only one to date that I've given straight 5's."
"I must say that I was blown away after drinking this beer. It was truly a privilege to have had it. It poured a dark brown color with a small to medium controlled tan head with lots of carbonation and bubbles running to the top. The smell is really yeasty and bready sweet. The taste is amazing. It starts out lighter in body and taste and then expands to a deep thickness. I can't believe it's 10% abv because the body and taste would tell me otherwise. The initial flavor reminds me of raisinettes. Dry fruit flavor resinates. A bready flavor ensues mixed with some yeast. It's not the base but it's very solid in the body. The yeast strain is amazing and really sets this beer apart. Each taste brought me new flavors and new insights into this beer. I must get it again!"
"Yummy, I'll have to get this again!"
"This has indeed earned its place in the top 50, and indeed a place in my favorite beer list."
"In my opinion, this is better and a lot more drinkable than the Westy 12. I am very happy with my choice."
"Absolute joy to drink, one of my highest rated beers thus far."
"EDIT 12/19: Had this a couple times since this review and have to say that I'm not as impressed. I was a little drunk when I had it last, first time too at Monks...so maybe its too be expected I inflated the score. So I knocked the taste down to 4.5."
"Rich, full, round velvety smooth mouthfeel that seemed lighter due to great balance and carbonation. Wicked drinkable for a 10% beer. Outstanding!"
"I have been anticipating trying this one since my beer-loving friends rave about it. They were right. This is one of the good ones, pouring a cloudy amber to hazy brown brew with a lot of off-white head. The lacing is pronounced and long lived. The surprise was that it blew the cork out of the bottle when I removed the twist-wire. The first beer that I have seen do this. It is a peppy beer with lots of malt, hops, and grain in the aroma. There are hints of clove and malt in the taste, which is outstanding. This looks, tastes, feels like a true Abbey. It is creamy and rich in the mouth, and I could drink this for a long time. The high alcohol level isn't noticeable until the bottle is gone."
"The extremely happy smiling monk on the slightly crookedly placed label should serve as sign of things to come."
"This was a full flavored ale, as malt, caramel, and fruit flavors were strong. Smooth creaminess on the tongue when you first sip it, then the carbonation level caused a crisp finish. Medium bodied and alcohol levels were well hidden, making this extremely drinkable. One of the top Belgian ales I have tried."
"My favorites are still Rochefort 8 and 10, though."
"i had been a bit turned off to this style after sampling a bottle of trappistes rochefort 10, but found the st. bernardus 12 to be a much more refreshing and enjoyable example of it and can't wait to try a few more. this one poured with a slightly frothy off-white head and had a cloudy ruby colour to it. the smell was quite good but not overly complex, with malt, hop, butter, and caramel being the most prominent that i can recall. the taste was equally good, with a tart caramel buttery feel to it along with a sour fruity (cherry) taste. this one has enhanced fruit flavouring as well as it warms. there's a nice little carbonation bite at the finish of an otherwise smooth drink. a solid brew."
"I typically keep my beers in the fridge and let them sit out for 5-10 minutes before opening the bottle. Evidently, I was a little over eager and opened this one while it was still a bit too cold. I was quite surprised by the changes (for the better) in flavor as Abt 12 warmed."
"Overall, an incredible beer that is one notch below the Rochefort 10 but I will still drink hundreds of bottles of this beer when I am in Belgium this summer!"
"Overall Impression: Thinking this would go very well with a roast, or a beef meal. Its flavor is pronounced, but not overwhelming. The spices are reminiscent of Unibroue’s blend. Drinkability is impaired only by the alcoholic kick that has clouded my wits after the first goblet. This is truly worthy of the top 50 spot it holds, a classic brew. One to go to school on."
"Update: 24 hours later I ate the thumb-sized foamscicle that had formed at the top of the bottle. It was amazing! I am therefore upgrading the drinkability score from 4.5 to 5.0. No beer, in my experience, has produced such pleasure with so little weight for so long after it was opened. Bravo!"
"The poor mans westy. Pours a deep garnet color with a gorgeous white head. Very warming beer. The alcohol is apparent, but enjoyable. Mostly raisins in the taste, a little plum. Very fruity. Supposedly the same recipe as westy 12, but if I had a choice, I would go with the westy. But then again, I am a poor man."
"Poured a dark brownish color, an aroma that was very complex Abbey type malts and the smell of well kept but old monastery wine casks thick chewy mouthfeel and the taste ,so many things going on here, fig , cherry , chocolate, banana, all perfectly blended and the alcohol does sneak up on you. Plan on storing a couple to see if this wonderful gets even better."
"A very fine Belgian -- top notch, and deserving of its reputation as one of the best beers in the world. This is one of my ""oh my"" beers... the beers that I can't help saying ""oh, my"" after I've taken a sip."
"Very dark red, almost black with a healthy tan head. Sweet with brown sugar, raisins, cherries, clove, and a bit of bready malt. Improves as it goes, and it starts very well. Clean and well balanced with a spicy hop and alcohol finish. Very nice, well made beer. Definitly will be getting a second look."
"To date the best beer I've tasted. Pours a mammoth/iceburg of a head-perfect lace which covers at least 75% of the glass and takes a good five minutes to retreat. The color is that of dark cocoa with some ruby hues. Gobs of cocoa on the nose. Wonderful sweet raisin and prune aromas bathed in brown sugar and butter. Damn inticing! Sweet on the nose, yet with a snappy acidity to keep focus. A dream of a brew to taste!! Full bodied, rich and malty with waves of tangy bitter chocolate, cocoa powder, sauteed prune in brown butter, exotic spice-ineffable?-vanilla, cinnamon, mollases-hard to put down! Add the perfect balance and the fact that the alcohol is so well integrated and I think I've found a perfect brew. Can't ask for any more. Not a complaint-I could sip this into eternity."
"The mouthfeel is silk....Just drink this one. I will get more. This is a celebratory beer. I understand now what it would be like to have walked all day to a monastery and have slaked my thirst on a safe liquid that came from God."
"Very dark with a light tan head. Smell is not too impressive and kind of fruity. This one is all about taste to me. There's a creaminess that is appealing, to say the least. The alcohol tingles on the tongue and warms your insides on the way down. Despite this, the beer does not have an overpowering alcohol taste. It is nicely balanced and one I'd like to have on hand more often if I could afford it."
"First sip, sweet kiss of malt and happy yeast. Free range, evidently. As it warms, more orchard flavors, sweet bready yeast, and here comes that damn fruit fly again. Filling combination of flavors and sensations make me completely forget that I was going to have dinner after this. Wonderful."
"Once again, let it be noted that a label featuring a smiling monk holding a beer designates a truly fantastic brew."
"Solid, solid, Belgian. Pours ruby to brown in tglass (chalice) forms a nice 3 finger head that sticks around to the bottom. Slightly sweet, though not overly-so for it's type. Yeasty but not overpowering in that regard. Velvety-smooth in the mouth with plum, slight tang of citrus peaking around the end. Truly a great beer; although not the best in it's style, it is competing with the creme-de-la-creme of the beer world, and it definately holds it's own!"
"Drinkability: A delicious fire-side sipper! This ale certainly deserves all of the accolades heaped upon it."
"One of my new favorites."
"The aroma is of over-ripe plums, a bit of alcohol, and a really deep red wine. The color is dark, ruby brown, only a small amount of light escapes this brew. Wow, this is incredibly smooth. The alcohol smell and the 10% abv had me expecting the worse, but there's nothing to be afraid of. The taste is of dark ripe fruits, balanced by a very light nuttiness and a bit of hops to even it all out. This stuff even makes your burps taste good. I could drink this Abt. 12 daily, time to take out an extra student loan!"
"Poured into a beautiful, sort of bowl shaped, St. Bernadus glass. Half the beer in my glass was thick, white foam, but this led to a very smooth,almost thick and extremely creamy mouthfeel. The first sip of this brownish colored abbey style ale is bits of caramel and fruit. There's some green apple in the aroma, which in any other beer, could be considered a flaw. Almost smoky caramel flavors with bits of dark fruit such as figs or plums. Periously drinkable for its strength. A bit more rustic for me than the last time I had this on tap at the Map Room in Chicago."
"An aroma of plum, clove, fruitiness and some sweetness emanates from the glass. Pours with a light brown head, and it is a cloudy amber-brown color. A very thick lasting rocky head tops this beer, it is very well carbonated. Very spicy tasting, accompanied by a certain mustiness. Finishes with a bit of sweetness. The dense rocky head and the Belgian lacing on this beer is quite amazing. Alcohol in the finish, along with a certain astringency. Malty, fruity, caramel notes, and a strong finish of rich fruit (perhaps plum and/or cherry). Quite a complex brew. Very light in body but quite a mouthful that will hit you when you stand up. As it warms up it gets a bit more sweet, more fruity, and it loses a bit of the astringency in the finish. A great example, and a must try for anyone."
"i read all the hype so i figured what the hell. it pours a nice hazy brown with a goodsized head. the smell is sweet, sweet malt, clove and yeast. the taste is sweet and malty, think brown sugar, spices, maybe a little banana. finishes with a decent alcohol smack. nice creamy body, extremely smooth in the mouth. this beer is great for the style i guess. im not really too hyped on the style though. so as far as personal tastes go, its good, not great and maybe on rare occasions id hit it up."
"Good, very well crafted beer, perfect for an after dinner drink in place of a port wine."
"If I may quote Uncle Jesse from ""Full House", ""Have Mercy!"". Just unreal. I took a sip and nearly did a backflip. The taste is just phenomenal. It's like liquid cotton candy. Alcohol is brilliantly hidden. Mouthfeel is perfect with just the right amount of carbonation, and the drinkability is through the roof. I don't know how this is out of the bottle, but on draft, it was almost perfection. This is definitely one you need to try."
"Update – I had this again in 2011 and this really is one of the most complex, amazing ales ever made. I wrap into a different zone whenever I drink this beer and the consistency year over year is astounding. I would love to give this ale a perfect 5.0 but try as I may, using every method I can think of, I just can’t coax a perfect score out of the nose. Great is great though and this beer is spectacular."
"On to the flavor. Alcohol seems predominant, but leads to some mild flavors of plum and caramel. Finishes spicy and alcoholic. This is a quality strong Belgian ale, one definitely to be respected. But please, this is not a Westy 12 clone, not even close."
"To hell with hops. I could live on this stuff. Superb."
"Appearance: Pours a murky mahogany amber brown tone wih the lightest trickling bubbles of a head thin layer of bubbles on top with absolutely no lacing at all here, on top of that when I popped the cap no air released from the bottle interesting. Aroma: Ambrosia enticing spices, blends of fruit juice, alcohol infused figs, this beer is definitely out there some anise tones with a peppery finish just the most unique smell I have ever come across with all the complexity it still holds the candy like smell of wow, complex. Taste: A warming spiced up alcoholic flavor with trickles of leaves a thick dark roasted malt aftertaste on my tongue this beer is complex creamy flavor hard to describe must be experienced I guess, not sure if I love it but it's good. Mouthfeel: Is think lacking any much carbonation redefines beer I guess but overall an experience to be had, I must find some Westy 12 now but this beer is interesting. Drinkability: Challenging to the senses I am dragging just trying to figure this one out, it goes down incredibly smooth I have no idea what the abv is but I'm sure it's capable of rattling the skull."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Nice smooth malty beer. Malts are richly sweet and slightly nutty. Touch of barnyard. Herbal hops. Well balanced. VERY NICE beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"St. Bernardus does not quite match the wonderful complexity of Westy, but given the fact that it is a third of the price, its well worth picking up."
"I love seeing a smiling monk on a beer label and for good reason. Pretty brown beer, nice tan head, and lace. Smells of ripe fruit, spice, and just a hint of alcohol. Tastes slightly sweet, raisiny, and just a bit funky. Big, chunky mouthfeel and happily drinkable at 10% abv. Great beer, plain and simple."
"Poured this one appropriately into a St. Bernardus Goblet glass. I had a huge smile on my face as I studied it for a few seconds in the glass...I had been anticipating this one for a while. It appeared a dark brownish mohagany/chestnut color in the glass, with a thin, lacy head clinging nicely to my goblet. The smell was very rich and fruity, a strong overall aroma. Heavy carbonation in the mouthfeel of this one, but still it was easy on the palate. A complex taste, definately fruity with hints of raisons and grape. Drinkability? Lets just say that I wanted to refill the goblet as soon as I was finished. A fine brew!!"
"Overall - Nice! Very Nice!"
"Dayton, OH AleFest:This beer had a large sized ivory head with a cloudy uncarbonated body.The hue was brown and the nose was malty and of fruit.The flavor of this beer was bitter and malty.The mouthfeel was smooth and light bodied.This beer left good lacing on the sides of my glass."
"Aroma is full of a complex blend of hard-to place spices, a mild alcohol nose, a bready body, and some sharp acidic notes. In appearance, this beer is dark brown with a very thin, but surprisingly persistent, whitish head. The taste is malty, spicy, a bit bready with notes of fig and a slightly burnt aftertaste. Medium-full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Quite a pleasingly complex beer. Hard to get ahold of, but worth the trouble."
"Though not quite as good as Westy 12, this is also 1/3rd the price. A wonderful treat, and certainly something that I'd have again."
"Appears very similar to the Rochefort 10, deep brown yet with light behind it, a beautiful deep reddish amber. Tan head is thin but creamy and also quite like the Rochefort. Aroma is sweet, fruity and malty. Mouthfeel is crisp yet creamy and full bodied. Really smooth. Has a wonderful big fruity malty flavor. The aroma and flavor here are in my opinion brighter and bigger than the Rochefort. I could drink a few of these quite easily. This ale is quite impressive, I'm extremely pleased to be drinking it."
"This was a decent beer. I was a little disappointed though, with some of the reviews I feel it did not live up to what I expected. The apperance was awesome. It was a nice dark brownish color with a huge head. It was very pleasant to my nose. Very spicy smell. The taste was very complex but not what I expected. There wasn't as much spice as was in the smell. It had a different taste than I can descibe. I could taste the alcohol in the end. It wasn't overpowering though, amazing at %10, it was a very pleasant alcohol taste. I think I may have served this too warm. I will definitely give this beer another chance. I think it may need one for me to give it a fair reveiw."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a St. Bernardus long-stemmed snifter. It pours a deep brown, near black, with two huge fingers of light tan foam. There is lots and lots of lace left behind with each sip. The smell is fruity and pleasant, banana and raisins mixed with just a hint of alcohol. The taste brings forth plums and raisins mixed with sherry. The alcohol, along with the hops, is only slightly noticeable. The body is thick and silky smooth. Even the drinkability is nice for being 10%. This one is right up there with Westy 12!"

"The finish and the aftertaste are the shining moment of this beer, crisp and sweet, and gives your mouth a wonderful feeling, hard to describe but this is a great beer."
"Love the smiling monk on the label. Pours out a ruby-reddish brown with a lively head due to the carbonation. Malty-fruity smell with a hint of banana. Nice malty taste, raisins and the presence of banana on the palate. Extremely well balances. Finish is silky smooth and absolutely scrumptious. Another Belgian masterpiece that I will drink again and again and again...."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 pours a magnificent ruby-brown color. A creamy head sits atop the dark liquid which leaves nice rings of lace down the chalice. Smell is quite complex with notes of dates, raisins, alcohol and yeast. The taste is vastly complex, as well. Here, notes of spice, yeast, dates, raisins, figs and alcohol are all well represented. This is certainly one tasty brew. Mouthfeel is quite luxurious with mild carbonation and an overall creamy texture. With the amount of alcohol in this one, it's really hard to detect overall. This is a beautiful, tasty creation, and one that I will certainly sample again."
"Drinkability: Damn good! This is widely believed to be the same recipe as Westy 12, and it's just as good. I could go through an entire week drinking only this...slowly of course!"
"The stuff from which legends are forged."
"Served just below room temperature. It's murky dark brown in color with very large tan head with a whipped egg white consistency. Plenty of bubbles rise up in columns. It's a pure temptation to look at this brew. Malt sweetness and alcohol are in the aroma strongly, also plums. WOW, there's a lot going on here.....chocolate and coffee, yeast and banana, spices, caramel, high levels of sweetness and syrupy alcohol. The alcohol really makes a stand in the aftertaste. I really enjoy it though. I rated drinkability on whether or not I want another sip or not.....instead of another bottle or not. This is a sip and savor brew for sure. Yummy."
"Originally sampled from bottle on 18 December 2002. St. Bernardu Abt 12 is dark reddish brown w/ a tan head. It has an aroma of toffee & rum. soft textured w/ a slightly sweet finish. Another example of a fine Belgian ale. Take your time and sip this one & savor it."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a very thick beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma is pleasantly fruity, with some malt, spice and alcohol as well. Medium-bodied and sweet, with flavors of malt, licorice, cherry and raisins. Flavor became more rich and easier to drink as it warmed. Pretty good Belgian."
"Pours a dark brown, with some ruby tinges in it. Head is large, big-bubbled tan, slowly diminishes to some decent lacing. Body has lots of carbonation, and lots of yeasty bits swirling around in it. Aroma is huge, yeasty, vinous, fruity, grapes, raisin, some doughiness, and hints of honey. Flavor is equally huge and complex, lots of fruitiness and sweetness, and changes over time as the brew comes up to room temp. Very full bodied, massively complex flavors and aromas. Very similar to the Westy 12, but seemed to have more lively and lasting carbonation."
"This beer pours a murky brown like many of the other Belgian strongs. The aroma was very malty with hints of caramel - almost like brandy. The flavor was fairly smooth for the level of alcohol, but too strong in my opinion. For the abv and price for the taste, I'd go with one of the other Belgians."
"To be perfectly honest I found this beer to be a very middle of the road belgian. A well crafted work of art, but just a little too subtle and bitter in it's taste for me."
"Was this only 10%? Oh, they must be happy monks, indeed!"
"this beer is awesome. pours a dark brown with an orange tint. it starts with a huge head that was beautiful, it held down through the brew and was it's smallest at about an eigth inch and it made a really neat looking ying-yang starfish looking swirl when i roused it up. it left a lace on the glass like a wreath. my lord the aroma on this one is indeed exceptional! i liken it to liliacs, daiseys and rosewater but overall it's a very complex aroma. now on to the taste and mouthfeel and wow does this beer ever stop impressing me? no it does not. the flavors of lemons, brown sugar, ripe red delicious apple skins, carmelized friuts and a neat pumpkin back flavor. the mouthfeel was very consistant and was essential in tasting. there was a plesant alcohol flavor in the mouthfeel too. a nice burp like a little encore. this beer was great to drink and if it weren't so damn rich i could drink it all day and night, stick to one and drink it for a long time. this is special. thanks, as always, for reading my review."
"Addendum: I have tried all the heavyweights available in the US. Westy, Trappist Rocquefort. This is the 5 out of the bunch. P.S. This is the only 5 I have given any beer."
"I can't say enough good things about Abt 12. While not a true trappist Abbey ale, it does not disappoint. In fact, it is one of my favorites of the Abbey incarnation. It pours a deep burgundy hue with an excellent head and hints of rasins, figs and a fine lace upon settling. Its just one of those beers you could take a sip of and let it sit in your mouth for 30 seconds before swallowing. Excellent balance, given its heavy alcohol content. Just the right amount of malt. When tasting a Westie Abbey alongside of Abt 12, I actually found the Abt 12 to be more enjoyable. Definately give this one a look the next time you're at your favorite shop. You can't miss the smiling monk!"
"EDIT: Okay, many months later and this beer has become my favorite ""big and darker"" Belgian. Amazing value for the price."
"For $3.50 an 11.2 oz. bottle it is a steal. And as VENOM (and others) note, this is supposedly the same recipe as Westvleteran Abt 12."
"Pours out with a white head that settles over hazy reddish-brown liquid. The nose is spicy, with notes of chocolate and light hints of dark fruits & a ""horse blanket"" aroma. Mouthfeel is effervescent, with notes of nuts, chocolate, fruitiness and a healthy amount of hops. The finish drys out to a perfect balance of hoppiness and malt sweetness...the high alcohol in this beer is hardly noticeable until late finish. A remarkable beer, you find it..buy it!"
"There's a reason the monk on the label is smiling broadly; even aware of the high ABV, I'm feeling this going to my head 2/3 of the way through a single bottle. Very, very nice on a dark rainy night; this will be a regular selection on my too-infrequent trips to Premier Gourmet."
"Worthy of it's high rating and very enjoyable."
"F."
"From this brightly labeled bottle the Abt 12 poured a dark caramel with just a minimum of light showing through when I held it up to the lamp. There was a big, light tan head, and the heavy carbonation was clearly visible. I noticed immediately a tart (gingery) aroma--with raisens, cloves, and dates mixed in; very intricate. The taste was initially sharper than I expected, perhaps because of the high alcohol content, which was not at all overwhelming; but the complexity I noticed in the smell remained evident in the taste too. The mouthfeel was excellent, with a soft, syrupy consistency--a good ale to sip slowly. I could not drink too many of these puppies at one sitting, but I now understand why the monk on the label has such a broad smile on his face."
"This is a wonderful beer. Full of flavor and body. The carbonation is at a perfect level. Spices are a vital part of the flavor of this brew. Roasty malts with light flavors of coffee and caramel come out. You will also pick up yeast and breadiness. The alcohol is almost completely invisible to your taste buds. Balance is incredible. It is an absolute work of art."
"Damn fine beer no doubt. Poured a dark red with a huge, pillowy off white head with some fine looking bubbles. The smell was full of raisins, cloves and other sweet fruits, perhaps mellon and just a little hint of alcohol. The taste was syrupy, sweet with notes of cherries rolling off my tongue. The carbonations gave an flavorful sensation on the back of my tongue as the nectar flowed down my throat. Great strong ale that hides the alcohol very well."
"An Abbey ale that keeps on giving until the glass is drained (and even then the thick head sits on the bottom,not wanting to leave). This beer was a pleasant surprise from the rare beer store at realbeer.com. It poured dark brown with a thick tan head that wasn't going anywhere fast. The aromas of banana,brown sugar,rum,ripe plums and spice was nice. It started out whiskeyish with a malty sweet long finish that seemed a little thin at cellar temp but became creamy smooth as it warmed. More notes of raisin bread with an alcoholic toasty/nuttiness in the finish. A great evening sipper."
"Pours out dark dark brown with a beautiful off white head that never dies. This is one of the most complex brews I've ever tasted. There's a party in my mouth! There is a clovelike taste. Sweet and fruity flavors also override my tastebuds. The alcohol taste is also very much there. If a beer could melt in your mouth this one would. Feels really nice going down. I think this may be a bit too much of a beer for me though. Alas. The flavors are a bit overboard in my opinion. I'd like to taste a bottle of this that has been aged a few years."
"Poured a cloudy brown (""iced tea"" brown) with thick, rich, light tan foam that left good lace on the glass. The smell was malty and biscuity with the smell of roasted banana. The taste was good, but the flavor of alcohol was very apparent. Very slightly sweet taste of malt with a hint of fruit and some phenols, with a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was warming (the alcohol), creamy and smooth, but with an astringent finish. The drinkability was OK, but the alcohol flavor was too prominent."
"Okay, supposedly this is made to the same recipe at Westvleteren 12, but I'm not seeing it. Huge, meringue head is appropriate to the style. Very sticky and I saw caves forming in the head along the sides of the glass as smaller bubbles became large but were unable to move because of the viscosity of the rest of the foam. The body is a very dark brown, cloudy. The nose is earthy, similar to some of the smells of a vegetable garden towards the end of harvest. The first flavor that hit me was cotton candy but this was while I was getting nothing but foam. It also seemed a little hot then. There's a butteriness to it that blends nicely into the chocolate and toffee malts. Ripe bananas over peaches a bit past their prime meld in nicely as well. Very low bitterness and the alcohol is covered extremely well. There's also a slight vinous character to it and there's something there that reminds me of the homemade wine my church uses for Communion. The mouth feel is very slick and creamy. This beer forces you to drink it slowly whether you want to or not. Since I'm enjoying it, I want to do so."
"Small 330ml bottle, pours a thick cloudy brownish color with a huge frothy and creamy biege lasting head that leaves clingy sheets of lace in my glass, nice malty and sweet yet spicy aroma. Sweet and fruity malty flavors, nice and smooth creamy soft mouthfeel,full body with a lively carbonation, finishes with a pleasant sweet and spicy aftertaste, alcohol very well hidden, I love this one."
"The joyous monk on the label says it all. This is another great from the Belgians. It pours with an opaque, amber appearance that is accompanied by smell of fruit and malt. The Abt 12 goes down very smoothly with tastes of ripe fruit and bread. Let me not forget the alcohol which is apparent on the finish and lets itself be known on the way down. Overall, this is a tasty and complex abbey beer that is much easier to come-by (and cheaper) than Westvleteren or Rochefort."
"First of all, WOW. This stuff is excellent. Pours a deep brown hue with a thick light tan head. Strong maltiness, Caramel and biscuity taste. Complex malt profile that becomes more complex as it warms. I am really starting to love Belgian Beers. I'd recommend this one for anybody who needs a change of pace from hoppier beer."
"Thanks to D & V International for the sample. http://www.specialtybeer.com"

"Hazy, almost opaque dark brown with the characteristic off-white head of this style. The head stays at a good level. Great aroma! Dark fruits (mostly plum), yeast spiciness, caramelly sweetness, and a good amount of coconut. Alcohol is only very slightly noticeable in the aroma, impressive for a 10% brew. What a taste! This is delicious! It's like doppelbock meets Belgian strong ale. At the front, sweet and spicy with caramel and that special yeast spiciness. Noticeable after that in the middle is a slight coconut character on top of the aforementioned flavors. Dark fruits (raisin, fig, and plum) make up the rest of the full body. Alcohol is not at all detectable in the flavor, but it does eventually show up in another form, numbing your mouth a good deal and making your head spin a bit. Retro-olfaction brings out some bready maltiness. Good amount of carbonation for the mouthfeel; not too much, not too little. I'm definitely reminded of the reasons for this being my favorite beer style. Even the aftertaste leaves you wanting more. This has become one of my favorite beers, #1 or 2 even, if I were to make a list. If you run across this, don't even think of leaving the store without it. It is a bit pricey, but less than a lot of the other Belgians, and definitely worth it. I was informed that this was only recently made available to us here in Arizona. I picked it up in a gift pack. I hope after the gift pack season is over they'll still carry this beer."
"My bottle listed alcohol as 10% by volume. Alcohol definitely present in the taste. Quite creamy, large head, remained prominent throughout. Significant lace. Nice, somewhat spicy fragrance and taste. Clearly a very high quality beer. I followed this with a Rochefort 10, which was a quite different (and ultimately more enjoyable) experience! This is like a slightly thinner Westy 12. Not as rich or complex as the Westy, but not far off. Very good, gets better as it warms. Handles the 10% abv quite well. Better than Chimay blue (IMO), and I'll certainly take it over Trios Pistoles. One of the best!"
"Murky reddish brown hue. Well retained, thick, light tan head. Yeast derived nuttiness and rustic must at first in aroma, ensued by ripe peach like fruitiness, mellow banana esters and notes of molasses and butter. Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering. Abt 12 is a delicious, complex, and supremely drinkable brew. Flavorwise, it's reminescent of their 8, although much more pronounced all around. Highly recommended and worth the cost."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white sudsy head that left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. A flavor of malt, caramel and spicy fruit. A very strong flavor element and finish going on with this beer. A very impressive beer."
"Gotta give props to pbrian for this beer, the last one left from his shipment.  What a beer!  Thanks."
"St. Bernardus has been a long time favorite beer and brewery, and is one of only 8 beers from my nearly 6000 sampled life time to get a 5.0 from me. It is a beer that I have a case or two of at all times, and trust me it only improves with age. The beer emerges from the 12 ounce bottle a slightly bemused brown color with a majestic crown of tan to top off the body, the texture is semi creamy, and the lace forms a satin skirt to surround the glass. Nose is sumptuous, nutty sweet, bubble gummy, raisin like, fresh and pleasing to the senses, a most ""Sniffable"" beer. Front is ambrosial with a nice malt presence, the top is light to medium in its feel to the palate, with the finish congenially dry, magisterially hopped, notably acidic with a pleasant tummy warming sensation to top it all off, a treasure not to be missed if your into ""Belgian Ales", and or just like a great beer."
"This beer kicks Chimay's ass, but has difficulty in the ring with a Rochefort 10.  Taking a drink of this foamy maple-brown Abbey creation is like taking a bite of a caramel covered apple, with a hint of brown sugar added for flavor.  The slick salesman monk on the label conveys the beauty of this beer marvelously.  Looks and tastes like the beer has not changed or lost a bit of it's originality since it was first brewed.  Truly one of the most complex strong belgians out there.  St. Bernardus is one hell of a brewery."
"i'll have to be a real bastard here and disagree with everyone, i just thought it was too strong for its own good, the alcohol showed way to much. Quite simplitic for such a malty strong brew, i'm glad i tried it, and i'm sorry for the low rating, but thats just how i felt about it, it was a bit sickly i think."
"Nice dark brown/black color. Huge head (which seems to be a trend in the style of beer).   Malty, fruity character.  Very apparent candy/sugary taste.  A very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Lots of sediment, thicker pour, nice cloudy color, tan head. A bit spicey with hints of <cough>strawberry</cough>. It's actually quite smooth given the ABV. Hits like a horse."
"Huge head that settles down to a protective pillow over your beer.  Malt and dark fruit aromas.  Oh so smooth, creamy and full bodied.  Hits your mouth spritzy but then slides down your throat in a flash, leaving you with a warm alcohol buzz and a mouth-coating sweetness.  Flavors detected are raisons, rum, spicey yeast.  The overall profile leaves no doubt about the use of candy sugars.  When I came back to the last sip an hour later, the fusel alcohol came out my nose.  Great beer to savor, although I thought the sticky sweetness kept it from reaching the stars."
"Notes: Sheer bliss. Viewed as an abbey beer. According to Daisy (owner of 't Brugs Beertje), this beer follows the same recipe, uses the same water and its hops comes from the same hop regions as Westvleteren. ""Abt"" means the ""highest rank."" They also make a ""Prior"" at about half the strength."
