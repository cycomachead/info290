4.72,5.6,4.75,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"3/31/15 (Bottle) - Very dark brown pour, generous thick tan head. Aromas included malts, fruits, raisins and spices. Incredibly smooth to drink, light carbonation, beer went down easy despite the heavy ABV, though you did feel it later.Well balanced taste of malts, hops and flavor. Right amount of ""wrong", sweet and firm. Overall an excellent beer, one of the best I ever had.","dukeandduke","Mar 31, 2015"

I loved the level of carbonation which is best described as a delicious ale infused alka seltzer.  Great smooth flavors with little to no aftertaste.  I'll recommend this one and will definitely quad again.","RossiDaMan","Mar 30, 2015"

I will say that I did enjoy the Westy a little bit more due to the clean flavor and finish and to me that is becoming a majorly important component of a quality beer. But, this is a very well made beer and do not discount it because its more available, there is only a minor difference in quality that I can detect, but it is worthy of note.","humuloner22","Mar 10, 2015"

3.74,-16.3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Tried a fresh bottle vs. a bottle aged over 1 year.  The difference was very noticeable.  The bouquet on the aged bottle was much nicer, very complex and rich and you could smell vanilla and brown sugar.  The taste of the aged bottle wasn't quite as nice as the smell or as good I would have hoped for.  Still has a bit of harshness to it but has more caramel like flavors and is more refined than the fresh bottle. The fresh bottle doesn't have the complex vanilla bouquet, but more the typical Belgian banana smell.  The taste of the fresh bottle is more tart.  Overall I wasn't nearly as impressed by this one as I thought I would be.  The aged bottle was noticeably better, but still didn't blow me away or live up to the hype of the high scores.

This is the definition of complexity, and every time I drink it it manages to blow my mind time and time again. The sweet, dark fruit flavors along with the caramel maltiness and the yeast profile truly make this a delight. This beer almost has a wine like quality to it, it really is something special. The only negative is that it is expensive, but then again you usually have to pay for quality. However it is well worth the price tag, and it is without a doubt one of the greatest beers in the world.","TheItalianStallion","Jan 23, 2015"

Smell: raisin, dates, toasted brown bread, cola note, caramel, lightly floral and spicy. Taste: caramel, cherry cola, fig, spicy and slightly boozy, finishing with notes of clove, pepper and toasted grain. Carbonation is a bit high, but based on the sugariness it's probably the right amount for this beer.

A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped and also there was sediment in the bottom of the bottle after the last pour also. Lots going on with the aroma as there is sweet caramel malts with a hint of dark fruits with some spices. Even more going on with the taste as it is hard to figure out what is in here. Very smooth and creamy as this is a 'sipping brew' and it took be a good hour+ to finish it. Medium+-heavy bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. This brew actually is better when left out for a while instead of ice cold for sure.","BeerWithMike","Dec 22, 2014"

This bottle has about a year and a half on it from what I can tell and I am interested to see how it will hold up after some more time, and would love to try it fresh as well though I know that this may be a pipe dream. I think the only thing that holds this beer back is the lingering burnt sugar flavor. Not that it is unpleasant but a touch of sweetness would in my opinion add another wonderful dimension.","MrWilliams","Nov 23, 2014"

Popped the cork and wasn't paying close attention, next thing I knew, great smelling beer was all over my counter. Shared with my wife and son, poured into a Belgian style glass. The color was a deep mahogany, with just a bit of opacity. Kicked up a nice head that faded pretty quickly into a thin film. Very little lacing down the glass. The smell was nice, with some dark fruit smells, lots of sweet malty aromas and just a touch of sweet caramel and cherry notes. The taste is absolutely phenomenal, with huge dark fruit and candy sugar flavors up front. Lots of different flavors on the back end, with a bit of toffee, caramel, fresh baked bread, pepper and raisins. The mouthfeel is luxurious, rolling so smoothly over the tongue, no alcohol bite, and just the right amount of carbonation bite. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers of all time, when one considers the price and availability, it's gotta be pretty high on everyone's list of the greatest beers out there!","timontheroad","Nov 23, 2014"

Oh so malty sweet! Fruity; like figs and wine like grapes. Bready and nutty. A slightly dry finish. So much complexity and nuance to this taste! High alcoholic content but not boozy. I drink beer for the taste and the buzz; and this one offers both in spades! Feel is a lively carbonation, full bodied, robust, but oh so drinkable! It is refreshing and hearty at the same time.

Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, pepper, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly slick/creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Quadrupel style. All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering as expected.","superspak","Oct 16, 2014"

I actually found the nose more pleasing than the taste with the latter having a more pronounced tart port wine like character that i have some getting used to. The finish and aftertaste definitely has a spiced floral note with a good amount of bitterness. I dont know if its the yeast or what, but something about this beer reminds me of Samuel Smith. This beer has definitely done a good job of broadening my palate and i'm looking forward to trying more quads in the future.","Bone53","Oct 13, 2014"

While the Westy is complex and buoyant, the St. Bernardus 12 is like a Westy you left a piece of tree bark in overnight. The St. Bernardus 12 is somehow thinner and more bitter. Acrid might be a better word than bitter. St. Bernardus 12 has an unpleasant sharpness to it (whatever the medicinal qualities of its high abv) like waking in the morning to find you have an unsheathed razor blade in your mouth. The only way to mitigate the sort of acrid unfriendliness is to chill it to at least the recommended temperature -- and probably lower. The Westy I drink and feel I am encountering something higher, greater than myself. The St. Bernardus 12 is like its failed, slightly mean-spirited brother.","amendt","Jun 26, 2014"

4.16,-6.9,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"330 ml bottle poured into a goblet. Initial pour yielded a massive amount of creamy beige foam, which will eventually settle into a murky yeasty light cola brown colored liquid with a rich buttery aroma of dried dark fruits (dates, figs, raisins), cocoa powder, faint red berries, toffee, and an earthy tobacco-like note that also shows up on the palate. This is another fairly legendary Belgian and certainly the taste stands up well to intense scrutiny. Rich, dark, sweet, and a little roasty, with a warming but not overpowering alcohol presence and tons of dark fruit and woody, earthy notes yet quite drinkable just the same. Dark chocolate cake and dates yield to some medicinal licorice or anise notes at the back end, along with some spicier potpourri-style cinnamon and nutmeg. Moderate body (not super thick) and a similar mid-range degree of carbonation do not surprise me, although the finish is VERY interesting ... Almost a barrel-aged coconut/sulfur note that lingers and lingers along with faint gooseberry-like hops. The candy bar sweetness becomes more pronounced as the roasted bitterness subsides and I am digging the evolving complexity after the initial blast of chocolate, yeast, and booze. Supposedly this is the same basic recipe as Westvleteren 12 and I am eager to do the comparison (soon). In the meantime, the last few drops are going down and I am feeling little pain. I might go on record and say that I prefer Rochefort 10 but that's no real insult. This manages to sustain a solid runner-up position.","CalgaryFMC","May 14, 2014"

Taste is fruity with raisin, cherry and fig, lighter in body overall and a tad sweeter than Rochefort 10 and Westy 12. Slightly spicy and peppery in the finish with some clove. Has the typical perfumy alcohol and the booziness typical of quads but again is lighter than the Roch or Westy. Slightly oily mouthfeel with active, creamy carbonation. Overall, it competes with the best as far as quads are concerned. Not as bold as the others but just as good. I'd really like to taste an older bottle to see if the sherry-like flavors from oxidation improve the flavor profile.","brianmandell","May 09, 2014"

This beer has more than earned it's place on BA's Top Beers on Planet Earth list, and it has definitely earned it's place on my shelves. Very highly recommended paired with food, friends, or even just to sip on.","MattNidiffer","Apr 10, 2014"

The nose brings clean and sweet bread malts, plum skin, cherry, wild earthy yeast, brown sugar, and caramel. It tastes rich and sweet in its malty goodness with dark fruit esters, especially plum and raisin, playing a huge role. There's also a toasted oat/nutty character to the beer, some coriander and other spices from the yeast, and big bread flavor on the finish. It has the perfect carbonation to pry open the taste buds without overdoing it, and a medium body that hides the alcohol well.","itsscience","Mar 29, 2014"

I haven't had nearly enough quads to suggest where this one might rank on a relative scale, but I can't deny that this is one of the best Belgian-style dark ales I've ever had the opportunity to try. A great deal at its ON price-point - I'm hoping that this one will become a regular listing, but just in case it doesn't I'll probably snag another bottle for the cellar.

I wasn't disappointed. Just like the others who reviewed this beer I was treated to a nice lacy head. I enjoyed this in a 1 liter glass beer stein so I could enjoy the opaque tea like color. The beer showed lots of suspended yeast. It was everything I expected and just made me wish I could plan a trip to Belgium.","cutthetail","Mar 01, 2014"

Has a sweet dark fruit flavor and no hint of the 10.5% alcohol. Feels smooth and has a nice full body. St. Bernardus, I would say, is heavenly .","brutusmuktuk","Feb 24, 2014"

4.56,2,4.5,4.75,4.5,4,4.75,"Overall: This Quadruple is not as hot as most of the others that you have been used to. It goes more along the lines of a triple or even a dubbel. It goes down easy, but still lets you know it is there- especially when you stand up from 25 ounces of the stuff! This is the tastiest Belgian Quad and very akin to Gulden Draak 9000 Quad- as it goes down easy but it is amazingly complex and the heat is masterfully masked. It goes down SO easy despite the heaviness and complexity: watch out! This is a serious beer and one of the World's best. Since I am a Belgian lover, there is nothing better than a Quad that masks itself down a little. This will always be one of my favorite beers and is endlessly drinkable.","LightnerLiquorKS","Oct 21, 2013"

It has a little bit of fine dark particulate matter in it like you might find in a wine bottle. I drink it and it tastes more or less like a dry red wine. No hop character and no malt character. All its flavor is yeast derived. Carbonation is not very strong. Alcohol is WAY strong. Pretty good wine overall.","TWebb","Sep 26, 2013"

The body if medium, carbonation is high...finish is...unique as it's neither crisp and dry nor smooth. It just is. The beer itself is rough on the tongue, in a pleasant sort of way..kinda grainy.

Few beers have blown me away, and this one humbled me greatly. I know I will come back to it and try to review it in the future.

4.85,8.5,5,5,4.75,5,4.75,"Wow! Where do I begin! This beer is wonderful. As I just finished the bottle. Beautiful head, and color. Amber to medium dark in color. I do like the Rochefort 10 as well. I would say that they are neck and neck. Can't really choose between the two I like them so much. This a great quad. Great flavor on the tongue, and leaves hardly no after taste except a wonderful sensation on my tongue and throat. These monks can brew some mean beer! I am hooked.","KellyScottMad","Aug 17, 2013"

The fact that it is so much more widely available is a big plus. This is the epitome of the Belgian style and all other Belgians should just bow down now. Just a perfectly balanced taste.","bnelson997","Aug 16, 2013"

It is not something I always grab when I am out shopping, just because it is a beer I know I can get any where I want. That however does not mean it is a bad beer, in fact that is a good sign. Its dark color is not intimidating as it has some really nice fruit flavors that Belgians like to give off. I really recommend this beer to anyone but watch out how many there is a lot of booze in these puppies.","vinny21bal","Aug 10, 2013"

I'm always amazed at how much Belgian beers have to offer and how something like this is so highly rated by so many. Even on a muggy night like tonight, this was refreshing and anyone who reviews beers on here needs to get their hands on this and find out for his or herself why this is one of the classics.

Dark fruit, plums, dried cherries, figs, a hint of leather, and some deep rich bready malts. All flavors come together so nicely and balanced. A real work of art. Mouthfeel is stunning. Smooth and thick, but not overly rich. Overall an outstanding example, one that I think exemplifies the style.","taylor714914","Jun 18, 2013"

This is a thinkers beer and one that was created with much love and quality, but the sweetness is just too close to a confection and that's not really very pleasant.","RobertColianni","May 28, 2013"

Again, I've never enjoyed or not enjoyed a beer based on smell. Now time to taste it...the true test. Exactly what you would expect from a trappiste beer. Makes you think, what the heck am I tasting! Can't say I enjoy this trappiste offering as much as Westvleteran or Rochefort but has a complexity that makes you think while you drink. Is it the tastiest beer? No, not really. But is it enjoyable? Absolutely. Overpriced for what you get. Maybe with a nice piece of beef it would really shine but on its own, doesn't really stand up to the other trappiste offerings.

But everything layers over each other and gives it a great quality. Reminds me of an old plum tree.","mts198","Mar 18, 2013"

When all is said and done, I don't think I could tell the difference if I was blindfolded. You could hand me an Abt 12 in a blank glass, tell me it was Westy XII, and I wouldn't be able to argue. That being said, they are both fantastic beers - pinnacles in brewing, and quintessential beers for the style they both represent. At the end of the day, I must give a slight nudge to the Abt 12 though, given it's relatively low price point and incredible availability.","tectactoe","Feb 27, 2013"

The color is majestic ruby red, the smell is elegant, the taste is sublime, clean and deeply flavorful, but balanced. High ABV but totally hidden, just a slight wisp of the finest malt used to perfection to create this quad. I have spent a while trying to find something wrong with this beer, so far I come up empty, it is a super fine abbey ale.","JimTeal","Jan 23, 2013"

Well carbonated, light body, smooth but had a slightly coarse edge from the booze. Seemed to mellow as it warmed, got less boozy and the carbonation dropped off slightly.

The finish is a perfect synthesis of the previous two bready and fruity components I mentioned, which is something I love so much about this: its perfect balance. Mouthfeel is very warm and comforting, and the high alcohol presence leaves a very faint but noticeable warming sensation near the sternum. I would love to drink this on a brisk late autumn night. Carbonation is medium to low; certainly something to sip on over a gradual period, but nothing too heavy.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"

Heavy alcohol right up front, followed by more alcohol. On the back end, hints of raisin, melting into a nearly minty finish. This beer seems pretty straight forward to me, kinda grabs you by the collar and slaps you around a little. Certainly a no-nonsense beer. It's dark, it's strong, it's boozy, it is glorious. I like it.","--Dom--","Dec 24, 2012"
4.33,-3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours dark brown with a rocky, beige head, lots of carbonation to hold the head retention forever. Chunky lacing is left all over the glass. Aromas are boozy, rum, raisin, bready, fruity, Belgian yeast, woodsy. Tastes are boozy also, but not off-putting, fruity, raisin, rum, Belgian yeast, bready malt, brown sugar, spicy, earthy, caramel, candi sugar. Tremendous complexity. Body is thin-to-medium, but the extra carbonation makes it feel fuller. Overall, just outstanding; world class quality. I love going back to this beer every once in awhile.","barnzy78","Dec 24, 2012"

The bottle describes it as a ""brown ale", kind of in the same way someone might call a Ferrari a ""red car"". There is so much going on yet it never overtaxes the palate. I would say this beer at 10% abv is dangerously drinkable.

Will buy again, and again.","Star80","Dec 17, 2012"

The rich, yeasty flavors that linger long after the crisp finish imparts one hell of a taste experience to this fullest bodied ale. The pour explodes into a foamy head instantly, and the initial effervescence within seconds transforms into a robust fizz that carries the bread-like base into at least 10 different flavors (you can actually discern intermediate overtones of vine fruits, assorted spices, etc.). I wonder how many of your raters have actually tried this angelic brew, 'cause if they did the scoring would be quite a bit different!","Katriona","Oct 07, 2012"

It's really sweet, which I think limits its drinkability, but the flavor is good and the alcohol is very warming - so it calls for a slow sip approach anyhow.

Nose is rum raisin, milk chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, along with some earthy tones. Taste is complex with some cloves, cinnamon, milk chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, and plums among other things. Fizzy and slightly creamy on the palate. Slight warming alcohol in the dry finish. The 10.5% is superbly hidden. I like the Special Edition better still. 8/1/2009 7/4/9/4/16=4.0","tarheels86","Sep 06, 2012"

Smell is of raisins, figs, bready malts and burnt wood. Taste follows the nose closely. I get a bit more of the fig and raisin on the front end with a nice hop finish. Very smooth brew for a 10% ABV quad. Difficult to set down as it is so balanced and solid. Feel is a nice thick, creamy/silk that sits well on the tongue with just enough carbonation. Overall- I have had this on draft and from the growler and both were outstanding. More fruit as it warms and it is so smooth and balanced.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, fig, bread, fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, sweet alcohol, and fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. I saw this one on tap and had to jump on it as it is the first time I've seen it on since I started reviewing. I was definitely not disappointed at all. All the right flavors and aromas for a great Quad were definitely present and made themselves known right out of the gate. This brew does this while still remained very well balanced and drinkable.

Just a stunning beer. Deep brown color and a head you could eat with a spoon. Lace sticks on the glass to the last sip. Smell is sweet and malty, thats dominant. Spices like cinnamon and clove are in there. Tastes christmasy, which is hard to describe. The spices from the smell are definitely still there. Huge sweetness. It's like caramel or some kind of malty molasses. Toasty and bread, with just the slightest bitterness toward the end. Also, I have to mention the huge alcohol taste. It's not the first thing that hits you (That's the sweetness of the malt) but it is obvious. Goes down smooth with subtle carbonation and huge creaminess. Somehow, this high alcohol beer is very drinkable, I'd have another. This is not overrated, get some.","cambabeer","Aug 05, 2012"

Scent is of dark fruit like plums and dates, belgian yeast, and malts. Taste is fantastic, notes of dark fruits, belgian yeast, and a bit of soy. There is a good amount of booziness though but not too much to detract from the well balanced flavor. This is a very very thick, full beer. Mouthfeel is thick, with that booziness and just a bit of very fine carbonation. Overall a fantastic brew, though due to how big of a beer this is, Its definitely one to take slow and enjoy. For those that want something a little crisper and less heavy, their Tripel fits perfectly - and I must say I enjoyed the two about the same overall.","srv33","Jul 21, 2012"

In my case, the bottle became a little over-excited and tried leaving the bottle the moment the cork popped. This did not affect my drinking experience. The nose was familiar to most Belgians. A malty aroma was accompanied by hints of dark fruit. The initial taste was alomst mediciny in the variation on the dark fruits. The degree of carbonation was higher the I would have anticipated for a Quad. The carbonation brushed away some of the notes I was seeking rather quickly. Dark fruits, burned malts, and a hint of chocolate were obvious. In the aftertaste, the beer gave a pleasant warming sensation. This is an easy sipping beer. However, it was not quite as sweet as some other Quads I have had.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 04, 2012"

Nicely sweet, predominantly caramel, plum, raisins, and a light toffee hint. Perhaps even a touch of burnt sugar in the very farthest reaches of the crevices of your palate. This beer commands respect to all those savoring its greatness. Very, very light hint of hops keeps it from being cloying, yet remaining undetectable by conventional means. It's almost as if the hops are simple leaving a shadow to dance with the malts and fruity flavors. Carbonation is spot on. Sweet and almost chewy body, but still incredibly smooth.","DmanGTR","Jun 27, 2012"

4.48,0.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Bought a bottle of this at Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. The appearance of this quad is wild... a medium-thickness white head that, as it dissipates, reveals this strange chocolate-swirl that makes it look like a cappuccino. The brew itself is also very cloudy, looking almost alive as mist glides through the liquid. It has a wonderful apple scent that comes off the top of the brew in a noticeable but not overpowering way. The taste is spot-on, especially as the brew warms up in temperature, really making that 10% ABV present. The only downside to this brew to me was the excess gas and the sometimes harsh aftertaste that accompanies it. Overall, I love this beer, but I might choose other trappist brews over this in the future. Excellently paired with a garlicy steak.","shigg85","May 13, 2012"

The smell of fruit perhaps, plum, black cherries and a bit of fig on the nose, sweet malt, and spice as well. Initially clove and pleasant spice dominate giving way to sweet malt, dark fruit, and yeasty esters. Finishes sweet with pleasant alcoholic warmth. Perfect smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

It's very pleasing. The flavors of bread, toffee, yeast, and dark fruits explode in the mouth on the first sip. The alcohol taste is there, but it's not overpowering. However, the alcohol taste becomes more apparent the warmer it gets. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is abundant. Overall, this is a most excellent example of a quad that is relatively easy to find. I recommend this one.","acevenom","Mar 25, 2012"

As poured the aroma fills the room with a nice variety of dark fruits, roasted malts, molasses, and bread. No hint of higher abv. The flavor builds on the pleasant nose and is a delight. very thick and creamy and rich from the get go but incredibly approachable. The sweetness of the malt is most prominent at first but mellows quickly as a light bitterness enters. The dark fruit gives way to hints of raisins, molasses, figs, and liquorice and is very nice. Finishes creamy and smooth with a lingering sweetness. Full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a treat. I can't wait to purchase more to age and enjoy later.

4.75,6.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is an opaque, rich, blood-brown coloring with a slight filmy sparsely coating the surface. Aromas are rich and complex, with notes of licorice, molasses, and slight pepper and spicing. The flavors are rich and deep, with a blend of plum, date, and raisin on a crisp, well carbonated body. The alcohol gives a nod here and there, highlighting the palate. Biscuit and bready flavors throughout balance the other characteristics, and the overall malt profile is complex and delicious. At any given time you can get notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, old world fruits, and even some buttery tones. The aftertaste is creamy sweet and rich, almost like cake batter. The finish, remarkably, is kept light by the carbonation, and leaves the palate fairly clean. Great beer.","GarthDanielson","Feb 29, 2012"

This beer is really close to both beers, but its just a little rough around the edges compared to the the other two beers; very minor differences I gotta say. In other words...ABT 12 is an easy to get Westy 12 without all the hype/rarity surrounding it. Just like Rochefort 10, but I like Rochefort 10 just a little bit better.

Its sweet, soft and warm, the alcohol is here but melded with deep malts and a tumble of fruit on the tongue; figs, cherry, lexia raisin, come licorice and spice perhaps. Its is leavened out with bitter chocolate and coffee, finished with lacing of Fruit Salad sweets. There's other elements I can't describe but it is certainly an experience and highly recommended.","tenesmus","Feb 26, 2012"

The taste is a strong, sweetness (almost Cherry-Coke like) with a winey, port sort of after taste. As it warms up it really mellows out into a sweet beer with a malty after taste, and is an adventure in and of itself. A well carbonated beer that has a world class taste.","AMiz602","Feb 24, 2012"

4.64,3.8,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Out of a bottle purchased at the Hop Heads bar this beer was a cloudy, dark chestnut color with a towering head of foam. The retention was impressive and the lacing in fine bands with fishnets in between. The aroma was complex and appealing. I detected bready malt, caramel malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruits, some bananas and spices. The flavors were equally complex and yet complimentary. All the same notes from the nose were apparent in the taste with a perfect core of caramel and chocolate malt. Spicy and punchy without being hot, I thought it was an excellent example of balance and finesse. Dried fruits and plums became more pronounced as it warmed up and the hops presence was just enough to counterbalance the malts. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. An excellent beer in every way and one of the finest Belgians I’ve had.","thekevlarkid","Feb 20, 2012"

I get dark sweet fruits like raisins and figs then that great yeasty smell that comes with all quads, followed up with a slight presences of alcohol. The taste is great that raisin/fig taste with a some addition sweetness from caramel flavor then that discernible Belgium yeast flavor. When compared to other quads this one does have a noticeable alcohol bite that the others do not have. The mouthfeel is medium, but it is too carbonated for my taste.

Has minimal head retention and no lacing. Smells mostly of yeast but has some hints of nutty malts. The taste is medium bodied with the same nuttiness and yeastiness as the smell. It is well carbonated and not syrupy at all. It tastes different on draft than in the bottle but of course still very enjoyable and drinkable.","Hopdaemon39","Jan 09, 2012"

I sampled it along with some of my other perennial favorites including Maredsous 10, Aventinus, Delirium, and Chimay Tripel. The Bernardus 12 stood out as the the most complex well balanced, full bodied beer of them all.

The overwhelming response should be enough.","downhilldrift","Dec 20, 2011"

Remarkably balanced with both sweet and dry flavors, it is virtually perfect in every way possible. I have enjoyed this beer countless times in the past and it always manages to leave me breathless.

4.48,0.2,4.5,4,5,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark brown with a huge head that left good lacing as it dissipated (the beer was allowed to warm to about 54 degrees F.) The aroma is candy sweet with a mild soapiness. There are light hints of dried fruits and a faint smell of booze. The flavor of the beer is sweet and spice through and through. Raisins, molasses, caramel, figs, and spice are all there intertwined beautifully. There is just a hint of bitter and the aftertaste is a lingering spice and warmth that seems great for cold weather. The MF is smooth, slick, and slightly watery. The carbonation seems to be a tad high and the alcohol leaves warmth in both mouth and throat. This is a damn near flawless beer in my opinion. This is a perfect blend of flavor and alcohol. The flavors are rich and decadent and all wonderfully in check. This is one of my favorites and I always enjoy it.","jifigz","Dec 05, 2011"

Each time I have them, they come across as high class, but snooty and disconnected. I mean, the higher end ones seem to get it done right, but most of the others come across as close but no cigar and frankly almost like they are trying to cheaply imitate other beers. I know that's not the case, but that's just how I feel about them. Anyways, this is one fares better then most, so I'd say give it a shot.","TheHammer","Dec 05, 2011"

This bottle I bought (in France) was not nearly as tasty as the 750ml corked bottle I drank from (in the US) or as fresh as the 33cl bottle I had in Brussels! Still, while it's not my favorite quad, this is a massive beer. One of the greatest quads, and a recipe that deserves respect and acclaim.

A dark non-transparent color, not black more of a dark brown and doesn’t have the consistency that the other quads I’ve tried have had. Much less viscous than the other quads I’ve had which really surprised me as I expected this to be very heavy and it turned out much lighter. Tastes like a dark Belgium, with smells of fruit (figs) and some dark malt. Mouthful was pleasant and warm; alcohol taste isn’t overpowering but adds a complexity.

The flavor is sweet and bready, with the 10% alcohol content well-hidden. Unlike many Quads - this one seems to be a drinkable 'crowd pleaser,' so bonus points. The bubbly mouthfeel is not very heavy or earthy. A staple in my fridge.","Neorebel","Oct 09, 2011"

When you see a beer presented like this, it's just...this is what beer is supposed to look like. This is craftmanship. Aroma is rich with dark sugars, dark fruits, and spicy Belgian yeast. Taste of toasted bread, with lots of brown sugar up front, along with dark dried fruits--raisins, figs, plums--caramel, tobacco, almond, subtle hop spiciness, and an ubiquitous alcohol bite. Not heavy, but full-bodied, and highly drinkable.","Rifugium","Jun 23, 2011"

A gusher pours airy beige head with poor retention that quickly dissipates. The coppery brown body initially exhibits good clarity but gets hazed and flooded with yeasty floaties with the consecutive pourings. Aroma is an interplay of malty sweetness, fruity esters, alcohol and spiciness. The rich malt with caramel and bread crust qualities embeds strong fruity esters of grape, perfumy, spicy alcohol that flares out and peppery spiciness from yeast-derived phenols. The flavor is non-excessive malty sweetness counterbalanced by alcohol, then comes the bread crust, grape-like fruitiness and prominent peppery spiciness. Finish is medium-dry with light bitterness and alcohol warmth. Medium-light bodied with fine, effervescent carbonation that quickly dissipates leaving flat texture behind. Not as good as I remember it to be and far from my conception of the secular-version of Westvelteren 12. Too thin, with poorly masked alcohol and fruitiness limited to grapes, lacking heavenly orchard of all kind of ripe dark fruits and almond character that once possessed - or I'm just getting more demanding?

The smell is light sweet sherry or similar to a well aged scotch with yeast. The taste is sweet and has almost a grape jam quality, in the best way, up front and a dried apricot or raisin finish. Lite hops. Even though the alcohol is very well hidden and is warming, this is a sipping beer.","OttoPeeWee","Feb 25, 2011"
4.28,-4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dense, deep oak brown, with some sediment floating around, plenty of head that dissipates readily. Aromas of grains and caramels flow from the carbonation like a thick brewing wort. Every drink assaults the taste buds with chewy caramel, molasses, and ripened fruits, while some spice becomes more evident in the swallow and finish. The carbonation dances off the tongue as it's going down, finishing you off with a warming, slightly dry finish. Exceptional flavor, with complex character that's not matched in many places outside of Belgium. Packs a pretty serious punch, probably best with some food in the stomach and enjoyed on a cold winter's eve--or you could do it like me and have it on an empty stomach when its 80 degrees out :) Still just as good.","xodin","Feb 24, 2011"

Lots going on in the nose, fruity and sweet, with a hint of alcohol as well. Flavor here is excellent, sweet and malty with fruit notes. Could pick out toffee and bready flavors, as well as apple and grape. Finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated, which fits well with the dry finish. Drinkability here could be trouble at over 10% abv as the alcohol is well hidden and the overall balance makes it easy to drink. Can definitely sneak up on you after a couple glasses. Great example of the style, and one I can see picking up regularly.","mjhorn","Feb 21, 2011"

The nose is full of fruit with a light floral scent along with the belgian caramely malts. Flavors include some raisin, toffee and darker fruits. Sweet malts with brown sugar and caramel notes are dominant on the palate. Slight yeast presence along with a slight alcohol finish but not overwhelming, particularly since this is 10% ABV. Fairly high carbonation, perfect for the style, yet strangely full-bodied due to the malts, an excellent mouthfeel. In terms of drinkability, this beer is top notch for a belgian. I'm not one to down a couple belgian ales, but with this beer, I might consider it. Great complexity yet smooth, this is one of the highest quality ales I've had in a long time.","Prospero","Feb 10, 2011"

The smell is very soft and exceptionally smooth. It is pure yeast and sooo bready with very light and subtle sweet malt. The flavor is kind of hard to describe. Let me begin by saying that it is amazing. It's kind of funky and has light spicyness to it. It's very yeasty and full of bready malt. There is a light presence of alcohol but it's every so slight. Wow. This is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. It tingles the palate initially before melting in your mouth. It's perfect as far as mouthfeel goes. It's also very, very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and all aspects of the Abt 12 are well rounded and complex. This is definitely world class. I'm glad I could try this before my Westy 12, which I'm saving. I've been told that their recipes are near identical and this one didn't let me down at all. Excellent, excellent brew.","aasher","Jan 20, 2011"

In the mouth, there is loads of almonds rising up retronasally, but less come through in the taste. Simple roasty graininess. With yeast, there is more roastiness, and without yeast there is more fruitiness and esters, which are beautifully heady. One of my favorite traditional quads!","CuriousMonk","Jan 14, 2011"

The beer tastes like figs and dates and caramel and toffee, bready, sweet and again that all too hard to put your finger on delicious belgian pecularity. Incredibly complex, incredibly deep that improves as it warms. One of the top few beers of the world. Most closely resembles the Westy of any other offering. Absolutely amazing.

The higher carbonation gives it a deceivingly light mouthfeel, but as it warms and the carbonation dissipates, it becomes thicker. Most drinkble quad i have ever had. Amazing.

A nice looong aftertaste is present with a lot going on well after the sip is down. A slight numbing effect on the gums. Foam with every sip is a nice touch.

Since nothing is standing out as the main influence here it's hard to pick it apart.

It has a spicy aroma with some lightly sweet malts and a little bit of musty Belgian yeast. There is a purple fruit in there as well, red grapes or plums. It has a good, crisp, complex flavor. I can pick out a graham cracker-like grain quality to it. I can also taste red and white grapes, especially in the finish. There is a small bite of alcohol and floral hops in the aftertaste. Overall, it's a hearty, big flavor. It feels very crisp with lots of carbonation. The coating feels very good; it leaves a lot of malty flavor behind. It's very drinkable.

Great with soups. meat or rich vegie dishes, deserts. I've had this in Belgium, in various states, on tap, in small, big, and very big bottles. This is a great beer to serve fresh or after years of aging. I should add that while my rating across the board indicates 5.0, I can't add my own specific point rating, say, 4.6 for mouthfeel.

The brew pours to a deep murky brown color with a small to medium tan had that has a creamy consistence, good retention and has left a fair amount of lacing. The aroma of this brew is a nice mix of malts, dark fruit (Plums and cherries) , candy sugar and a yeast slurry. Really inviting aromas for this one. Has a excellent favor, malts come through here and make a great base, slight caramel flavor. Fruit seems to be there - raisons, plums and slight cherry flavors. Slight port like flavor that really goes well with everything, seems to linger a bit on the tongue - excellent. Some sweetness is there that is real nice, candy sugar, and is not over the top. Has a slight spice to it as well. This one drinks very well, goes down smooth, can't believe that it is 10+%.

Exceptional flavor of spices, dark fruit and, yes a tiny bit of banana and vanilla. Mouthfeel is very normal for a Belgian, substantial with a bit of sediment.

Although there is an alcohol presence, it is not over the top, but rather soothing and warming. This is a thick, strong, sweet beer that if you are not careful, could turn into a session beer and lead to questions of what went on the night before.

Sweet and fruity up front with unripe cherry, amaretto, and caramel malt. Alcohol is definitely noticeable at the beginning and in the finish, but not offensive, and gives an immediate warming feeling that is quite pleasant.

After pouring this dark brown, sticky sweet ale, a large latticework of foam appears and is a prime example of a beer with great head retention. Scents of toffee come to mind. Tastes of dark chocolates, candi sugar, and some nice warming from the alcohol. Also there is some dried fruit and possibly peaches? There is a nice light hop backbone in this chewy, medium/high carbonated ale. It is evident that this beer was produced with the powers of good as the ABV is hidden very well, and it is very nicely balanced as there are no overpowering elements. However, temptation is always nearby. This is a delightfully drinkable beer that demands proper respect. Too much of a good thing could lead to the dark depths of the underworld (or the floor).","TheJollyHop","Oct 18, 2009"

4.59,2.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - This is a true classic and while there are a great deal of varied flavor elements at work here, the yeast is the real star of the show. The malt provides a background of caramel sweetness on which the yeast displays a profound level of juicy, deep fruit character, balanced by lightly spicy notes. The hops make themselves known but only play a supporting role, though they posses a classic spicy, noble character. This beer is extraordinarily well balanced and despite a high alcohol content, it goes down smooth and shows no boozy harshness. If Rochefort is about malty complexity, then this is about yeasty fruit and sublime balance. It is a wonderful, and rare, experience to have a beer that lives up to its hype and as I sip this I realize that I had gone far too long without popping the cork on an ABT 12.","nickfl","Oct 15, 2009"
4.33,-3.1,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Smells of grapes, currants, pear, alcohol, and raw cane sugar. Tastes of grapes, maraschino cherries, and is slightly meaty. Medium in sweetness with a tingly bitter character on the midpalate. Full bodied, though a bit lighter than its brethren, but a nice low-medium level of carbonation (in contrast to the massive head). This is not the most complex of the quads, but it makes up for it in drinkability, the more I drink of this beer the more I enjoy it.","vacax","Oct 14, 2009"

Amazingly complex nose of figs, nutmeg, chocolate, cloves, cinnamon and forest fruits. I knew it was gonna be good on the palate but fuck me, this rocks hard. A full flavour that gives sweetness, bitterness, weight, more of the flavours that aroma hinted of and then a few more.

Nice head and great lace with a powerful dark and medium fruity nose. Very strong aroma. Smell and taste include ripe red apples, figs, dates, raisins, cherries, clove and Belgian yeast. The white wine, figs, dates and caramel malt flavors dominate the profile. I would say this is one of the most complex beers I've tasted. There is a lot to this beer and every taste brings new thoughts on what flavors you can find in this Quad. Mouthfeel was slightly dry and lacked creaminess yet was full with perfect carbonation. Not too drinkable for the style. A sipper with a noticeable boozy, warming finish.","natelocc787","Oct 07, 2009"

The low level of saltiness works so well with the sweet side of overall flavour and the exotic yeastiness is just about moderate - sufficient to make a nice difference...

Excellent retention - head eventually settles into a dense, half inch cap with thick, delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew was consumed. The nucleation point in the glass did a great job keeping things moving. Nose was dark fruit (plums, figs, raisins) and slightly vinous on a big malty backbone; maybe a hint of brown sugar, candi sugar and chocolate malt in the mix. Taste consistent with nose; however, a little boozy and some heat at the finish - vinous quality really comes out and lingers at the end. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lightly, yet evenly carbonated, with some mild astringency at the finish. Probably one of the most drinkable quads out there.

Color is cloudy iced-tea orange, and the aroma is a pleasant bready-citrusy cloud; if I could bottle it as perfume I'd make a mint at beer tastings. There's a pungent smack of alcohol that at first masks the fruity base of this beer, leaving bread and wheat at the forefront but the aftertaste reveals bananas, oranges, cherries and cloves and a sweetness that lingers for minutes after each swallow. A nicely dense body carries a super-fizzy tang that burns a bit. Drink this one slowly, and not just because of the ABV which sneaks up and hits hard: the flavors that develop long after you've swallowed develop into a wonderful bouquet. A nice treat for me and my wife at the end of our summer vacation.","gfreed","Sep 02, 2009"

Head is small and creamy but still dissipates fairly quickly, minimal lacing is left on my glass. I remember my previous Abt. 12 leaving good lacing though. Smells like a good Belgian beer, raisins, yeast, bready scents and some malts, maybe a small bit of alcohol. Tastes like all of the above things mentioned with some good spice to it, probably my favorite tasting Belgian that I have had yet. Mouthfeel is good, medium with some creamyness and alcohol warming, a perfect amount of it, a raisiney aftertaste coats the entire mouth.

The smell is yeasty with some dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs), and baked goods, with a splice of alcohol in there. Taste is all the flavors with a bit of extra spice thrown in there. Sweet flavors dominate. The mouth feel is beautiful. Covers every square inch with a silky sheet and balances it out with a good dose of carbonation. Finish is subtly dry.

Sediment floats all around in this brew, just looking at it you know it has allot of flavor to it. The head forms with out even trying and releases a great set of smells that are greatly respected. Lots of dark fruits hit the nose, figs, raisans and others. Dark Alcohol molassas smell aswell hits the nose possibly from the malt. The taste is also very refreashing one thing I noticed of the bat was the beer did not seem 10.5 alc and more of a 5. alc. The flavors in this beer mask the alcohol amount very well but are still present and help lift the flavors. Again dark fruits with molassas and a bit of spice to it. Everything is balanced in this brew exceptionaly well. The flavor is not overly complex were I need to sit, relax, and reflect but one that I can continue to do what im doing and drink. The mouthfeel is very good and the carbonation is perfectly matched. The carbonation lifts the flavors to your pallet with ease and does not dmg your taste buds in anyway. Drinkability is good due to the taste and smoothness this brew carries. The alcohol level is 10.5% and it will sneek up on you.

The flavor is very sweet - the sweetest of the quads that I've had. It's a nice sweetness though; not cloying. Very good as a dessert drink. I think that the sweetness does suppress other flavor qualities though. Thick with smooth carbonation and a slightly sticky finish. Very nice, but not as elegant as Rochefort, or a drinkable as Westy. Had it a just below room temp at De Wildeman, and tried it the next day on draught at Gollem, which served it much colder, and I have to say that it was much better warmer.","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

The head fluffs up then fades back, leaving very little lacing, but a thin layer of bubbles sits on top for quite a while. A little light and a little less frothy than I like, but still looks good. The smell reminds me a little bit of pipe tobacco, with very earthy, woody notes and some dark fruits, whiffs of alcohol and sugar, like rum and raisins. There's also a bit of dryness mixed in with a kind of bitter chocolate smell. A lot of complexity in the smell, but I'm not sure if it smells as rich as some quads. The taste hardly matches the smell as well as I'd hope. At first there a caramel taste, like a good, clean dubbel, mixed in with a heavy earthy flavor. Then the dryness kicks in. There's also a spiciness, peppery and almost like Indian spices, with warming, almost harsh alcohol. After getting into the drink, I notice a kind of candy sweetness in the finish. It isn't bad, kind of like the cleanest of quads, but it lacks the really enjoyable depth, and the huge spicy, earth (read: tobacco) notes don't bring it to where I expect. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy, but not entirely full. The carbonation is also a bit annoying, it stings the tongue and mouth with every sip. But it is still about what I'd expect. The unobtrusiveness of the beer helps the drinkability, though the alcohol can catch you quickly.","taylorhamrick","Mar 19, 2009"

Beer is dark chocolate brown in color with ample yeast floaties (I did pour the entire bottle into the beer as I enjoy the yeast). Nose is very complex with a mix of dark fruits, chocolate, nutmeg and some spices . . . a very rich and tantalizing aroma; really can't imagine anything better. Taste, I wish I could explain why I rated this a 5.0 but I can't other than to say it's amazingly delicious and complex.

It's one layer of dark fruitiness upon another, each one revealing something different as its rich body slowly expands into a fine bubbly mass that fills the mouth.

Alcohol aroma are low in intensity and quite soft. Flavor is quite similar to the aroma. Overall this beer is quite malty but still moderately dry. The alcohol provides a balance to the strong malt profile. Fruity esters are more prominent here than in the aroma and lean a bit more towards figs and maybe some dried cherries. Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, moderately high carbonation and some smooth alcohol warmth.

4.6,2.9,5,5,4.5,5,4,"Poured the Abt 12 into a Chimay glass. It looked beautiful. It pours an opaque black-mahogany color with yeast visible at the bottom and all around the sides (and in the head). The head is large a dark tan and the lacing is great. It smells like Belgium Yeast largely. I can pick up a few fruits, mostly dark fruits with a hint of sour grapefruit. The taste is great, only held back by the alcohol coming on a bit too strong. The flavor is powerfull overall though, as a mix of dark fruits and malts with an interesting bitter & sour finish. Even while cold, this beer is still great, and it is hard for me to wait for the Abt 12 to warm. It's a nice beer to have a couple of, but the price and high ABV may prevent you from going all out on this beer. Highly Recommended.","Jablonski","Feb 06, 2009"

4.57,2.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Pours a very lovely, hazy dark amber color with a one finger off-white head that fell slowly to a nice lasting cap and left very little lacing. Very yeasty aroma, dark fruit, raisins in particular, grainy, grassy, earthy. Taste is very complex, lots of great things going on here. Raisin flavor is predominant, followed by some grape flavor that was also present in the Prior 8, apples, light chocolate, a peppery spiciness in the middle, rum booziness, grassy hops, light bitterness, and a long dry yeasty finish. There is so much going on in this beer it's hard to determine all the flavors. Very complex to say the least. As with all the other St. Bernardus offerings, carbonation is aggressive at first but mellows considerably as it warms up a bit in the glass. As the carbonation subsides it becomes creamy and the flavors really start to develop. This is easily the best of the St Bernardus mixed 4 pack that I got for my birthday from a very awesome GM. Glad I got to try these beers. As far as the 6, 8, and 12 go, they get better as the number gets higher.","KeefD","Jan 22, 2009"

There's plenty going on here but no one flavor really stands out- everything works perfectly together to make this one of the best tasting beers I've had.

You feel a slight warmth of alcohol as it goes down and you can taste just a hint of it. This beer is nothing short of amazing.

There was also some hints of nuts and woodiness. The palate was excellently balanced and smooth, despite drinking at room temp. Chocolate and coffee notes were most prevalent. The mid palate brought some sweetness with honey, caramel and dark fruits. The finish displays some earthy hop spice and yeasty dryness.

The aroma is dark fruit with prunes, raisins, and brown sugar. The flavor follows suits with raisin and dates in the forefront with brown sugar, barley, and just a bit of cherry. Also there is just a hint of spiciness to it, probably from the Belgian yeast strains. The 10.5% alcohol really comes through, especially as it warms. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a nice boozy sensation on the palate. The colder this beer is, the less drinkable it is. As it warms, it really shows its true colors.

It was fairly thick with some carbonation (although surprisingly little considering how much head was on the pour), and a bittersweet aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was absolutely fantastic. It had great, complex, subtle, and generally delicious flavor.

The taste also included some rum-like alcohol, dark fruit, and yeast, but the burnt malts were overwhelming. Mouthfell was medium/full bodied. Nice balance of carbonation and thickness.

I get a wide range of carmel/sweet malts as well as earthy yeast, plumb, slight raisin, slight alcohol and grassy/floral hops, wonderfully complex. The taste is again just out of this world just so much going on and yet at the same time its majically refreshing. Plum, raisins, sweet carmel malts, spice, candied fruit sugars, nuts and alcohol all make a home on your palet. I can't remember a beer with more carbination than this one and yet it seems to fit it well, providing a nice airyness to the overall medium feel without making it seem thin.

Incredibly creamy and big on the mouthfeel. A hint of spice in the taste at the end of each sip. Very good beer. Luxurious in the mouthfeel.

4.83,8.1,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This was a beer that totally caught me by surprise. I had never heard of it, but I always try those I've never had when they are available. It poured thin, but with lots of head retention. Pour slowly unless you want a glass full of foam. Semi-dark, with a sweet, apple cider aroma. The flavor begins with the dryness of an aged cabernet, then explodes with notes of alcohol, overripe figs and balanced with a mandarian orange acidity and sweetness. This is one of the best beers of the year for me. Strong but refreshing. A definite sipper. I prefer a Hommel glass for this beer to enjoy the aroma with the flavor.","Homeroaster","Aug 10, 2008"

It has some vey active carbonation and some good lacing; it gives off a mixture of citrus and flowers, some spices and a faint aroma of roasted malts. Its got a crisp feel and flavor up front, faint bitterness and some good spiciness to it.

Solid lacing as the beer drains. Nose is amazing: huge cookies, chocolate, dried fruit all over the place. Absolutely delicious, and incredibly inviting. Flavor is similar. A little smoother and subtler than the nose would suggest, with a strong alcohol presence in there as well. A little unexpected (although maybe it shouldn't be, given the ABV), as I don't remember this in the bottle form. Again, tons of cookies, roasted chocolate malt, and a ton of raisins, prunes, etc. floating around. Body is huge and creamy, perfect for the flavor and aromas.

4.43,-0.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a dark, cloudy brown, with a big, rocky, off-white head. Smells strongly of alcohol and super ripe bananas. Taste is strongly malt based, oak like flavors, as well as a hint of cider. Just a hint of bitterness and flavor from the hops. Highly carbonated. The yeast flavors imparted by this beer are more neutral than I would have expected for a Belgian Ale, but this does not affect authenticity. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are high due to bottle conditioning. Drinkability is great, very smooth beer, that while smells greatly of alcohol, hides its 10.5% ABV quite well. Quite an expensive beer, but is a great treat every now and then.","tronester","Jul 16, 2008"

Has a pungent smell of licorice, dark fruits such as raisins, and alcohol... the licorice and alcohol combine to have an almost menthol like effect on the nasal passages. Tastes suprisingly subtle yet just as complex when compared to the intense smell. Spice and hops back the malt, dark fruits, and licorice for a balanced flavor and mouthfeel; yet finishes with a silky vanilla taste and feel. Alcohol is not overly present by any means. This is very drinkable and restored my faith in belgian and belgian-style beers, as I was sort of being let down recently. Great beer.","joshwlt","Jun 26, 2008"

The Abt 12 follows the same basic recipe as the Westy 12 (with different water and yeast of course), and results in a similar complex mixture of raisins, other fruits, nuts and spices. Almost as good as Westvleteren at a fraction of the price and inconvenience, its biggest problem is that its just good enough to make you really long and wish for the good stuff.

The fruit flavoring is what I noticed most - grape, cherry, sour apple, pear - and then a bready malt sweetness mixed w/ caramel and chocolate.

After chilling it and them letting it sit out to get it to the 53-56 degrees that is recommended, I opened it up. I then had to wait another 5 minutes for the head to dissipate after pouring it. The wait was well worth it. For an alcohol content of 10.2% you barely taste it. The best part of the beer is the after taste. It finishes very smooth and delicious. It was a good beer to try but I could never afford to drink it on a consistent basis.

Taste is a touch dark fruit, roasty, raisiny, light but standard belgium yeast character and caramel. Honestly, the mouthfeel was the worst part of it. Fizziest beer I've had in nearly 500 beers.

Essence of pine, nutmeg and sweeter spice flavors with moderate hop presence. This tastes like a quintessential Belgian. Deep, soulful yeast/malt presence with well-balanced sweetness, hop and alcohol presence. As time passes it provides the warming feeling of Thanksgiving dinner with even a hint of sweet potatoes and roasted carrots (I know, now I'm really full of $#!+ - maybe it's the power of suggestion). The carbonation is moderate, inoffensive and pleasant. This is all-encompassing, powerful wonderful stuff.

Flavor is great and continues on for a long long time. The aftertaste has a hint of sweetened Marmite, which shows the yeast in this beer.

Smell was beyond terfiffic... rich, deep, intense, satisfying, and creamy... replete with candied brown sugars, malts, slight vanilla, and other flavors that are intricate and difficult to describe... a wonderful conglomeration of pure malty goodness that stuck to the mouth long after the first sip... one of the top Belgian beers, for sure... Great creamy and rich mouthfeel... drinkabliity only took a hit because of the hefty 10.5% ABV, which, by the way, is nearly impossible to detect - masked by a interwoven cornucopia of toffee, malts, and fig flavors that pack a punch...

The smell is of clove, light banana and bubblegum. Belgian candi sugar moves in bringing some fruity esters with it. Big bold flavor, sweet. The taste hits you with clove and other spice, followed by candi sugar, light roasted malt, and some dark fruit esters. The feel is moderate to well bodied with very fizzy carbonation. Would have given the feel a 5 but the carbonation is a bit much. There is a nice balance between the sweet, spice, and roasted characteristics. Though it does lean on the sweet side. There is a bit of a belly burn due to the 10.5ABV. A very flavorful brew, perhaps a tad to fizzy and sweet.

The aroma is a strong bouquet of fruit and sweet malts - it smells like you should eat it with a spoon. The flavour is divine, and changes as the drink warms. Raisins and dried figs feature prominently, and every now and then a hint of peach comes through. The sweet malts are present from the start, and become more dominant as time goes by, as does the fruitiness of the yeast.

I have one more bottle and getting one more from my dutch friend but let's take a look at this one first. It pours out with a huge bubbly head that retains pretty well; color was the typical dark brown as like many dark belgian ales. The smell was yeasty, and alcoholic fruity; somewhat vinous but not as pleasing as I would have liked it to be. I had a sip and it was alcoholic plums or raisins leaving a lot of alcoholic fruitiness on the nose. It was sweet and the yeasty taste was also clear on this one. For some reason this taste reminds me of the Gouden Carolus although I forgot to review it when I tasted it. The after taste was plums, raisins, grapes and was pretty strong and pleasant. This Quad is closed to full body and was clearly rich and almost syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high but it was still pretty smooth but drinkability would have dropped due to its high and evident alcohol content. I am pretty disappointed as I put this up close with the Westvleterens but seems like it does not even qualify in my top 10 beers list which I expected it to be in anytime. It is a good beer but unfortunately not great; I would give this review a light pass since I have potentially 2 more bottles to go; let's hope that I am not missing a good bottle here.","basica","Sep 23, 2007"

Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering.

I was very nervous about trying this....high alcohol content, dark brown, yada yada yaada. Well, try it I did. It poured a dark brown into the glass with a small head that lasted throughout the entire beer. The aroma was thick with bread and hops, and some fruit. It was silky smooth on the tongue with a full-bodied feel. The taste...unlike any beer I've tasted before. There was bread, and malt...and hops.

Fruit notes dominate, along with a slight alcohol presence. The taste is a complex mix of dark fruits, malts, spice, and alcohol. Again the fruit taste dominates the palate, but there are noticeable contributions from the malts and a hint of spice, followed by a slight warming by the alcohol. Smooth thick mouthfeel.

Alcohol is pleasantly present, but very much in balance with everything else that's going on. St. Bernardus offers a great deal of bang for your buck... and is a perfect example of why I have fallen in love with Belgian beers. I enjoyed it with a rib eye steak for Father's Day.

It pours a hazy deep red with a huge foamy head that gradually dissipates down to a half inch that lingers, leaving a nice lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, dark fruits and some dry yeast. The taste is rich and complex, nice fruity dark malts, with just a hint of hop flavor and bitterness. There is delicious spicy yeast character and the beer is perfectly balanced. It still amazes me that this beer is 10.5%, its so smooth and not overly sweet, it could easily pass for much less. The alcohol is barely perceptable, even as the beer warms.","ericj551","Jun 12, 2007"

I'm thankful for the reviews noting the corks readiness to eject as soon as the cage is twisted. Hazy brown color, typical Belgian head, half of the glass. Nice biscuity malt smell. Tastes are similar, very creamy, big malt sweetness, very slight alc. is apparent. This is a great beer, I'm hoping that as I explore more Belgians in the future they will measure up.","jp62099","Jun 12, 2007"

It has a lot of fruit overtones w/ a similar fruit-like smell. It does have a copper-like taste but, for some reason, that's not so bad. The mouth-feel is like velvet.

The head leaves an attractive continuous lace as you drink. Very active bubbling in the beer. It smells malty with nutty overtones and a hint of spice - maybe nutmeg and slightly oaky. The initial flavor is moderately sweet and malty with light bitterness and a clean, long-lasting finish with roasted nuts and alcohol. It is medium to full bodied with slightly creamy texture and a dry, alcholic finish. This is an excellent beer with great complex flavor.

4.35,-2.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Poured into a chalice, it looks like a darker shade of liquid caramel. Has a nice soapy head that eventually dies and morphs into a creamy head (a la nitro stout). Smell is alcoholic, chocolatey, a touch of caramel, peppery fruit juice, and syrupy. Taste is more of the same, but the spice isn't as rough. Some date flavors poke through, but just as the flavors start to get at you, the alcohol pushes it back down. It has a creamy feel that finishes dry with bready flavors, but the latter is incredibly uplifting, pleasuring you palate and brain by making it so easy to take more and more sips.","DoubleJ","May 08, 2007"

It was nearly opaque but could see bits of yeast floating around the edges. It had earth, malty smell with good sweetness and a good hint of the ABV underneath. The taste was really good with a sweet finish. I really like Tripels but am finding that Quads are good for a few drinks then I'm ready to move on. They have great tastes but the alcohol and sweetness get to me before I can finish the glass. I can see why this is highly regarded but, for now at least, it's not one that I want to have again for awhile. Be interesting to try again in a few years and see where my tastes go. A year ago, I could stand IPA's and now I drink several a week. Highly recommend trying but share a friends bottle unless you really like the strong quads. (3.5, RB, ML, O)","TexIndy","May 07, 2007"

Caramel malts up front, some yeasts, and then dark fermented fruit flavors along with the alcohols in the background (but not overwhelming).

Nice, aggressive, and quite foamy head with loads of lace webbing throughout the session. The aroma was boozy, malty and offered up an average nose of candied sugar. I'd like a heartier aroma than this, but still not bad. A certain booziness in the taste with burnt coffee and some candied sugar, otherwise, slightly understated. Mouthfeel becomes more viscous as the liquid warms. Yes, it's a drinkable brew. I'm a fan of St. Bernardus, but I don't think I got a bottle of stuff that was aged enough. A good but not excellent effort.","jim102864","May 01, 2007"

The crown is soft and thick. The crown sustains a presence throughout the entire drinking and laces the side of the glass in parts. The aroma starts with a thick bready, yeast-like smell, followed by softer fruity notes banana, cherry, and grape juice, some tart citrus. Its hard for me to describe the taste. It's complex, malty with fruity notes, some cherry, grape juice, raisins, and a definite noticeable trace of alcohol. Mouthfeel is great, the beer spreads nicely over the tongue and just melts into my tastebuds. This is a delicious beer that I'd definitely try again.

The flavor is sweet, powerful malt, notes of cherry, dried grape, possibly currant..dark fruits ester goodness. Big mouth presence, absolutely perfect body, carbonation is just right. The drinkability rating should probably be knocked down just because the warming 10+% does catch up with you, but it's such a small part of the flavor that I can't find it in me drop it more than a half point off perfection.

Medium-bodied, and fairly powerful, but altogether very balanced - every nuance works well together rather than one screaming for attention like with certain big Belgian-style beers.

Very complex aroma with all sorts of stuff going on there including, hints of raisins, very sweet malts, hops, figs,and prunes. Evenly carbonated fizzy mouthfeel thats balanced with hops,bitterness, and malt. Alcohol is not well-hidden and easily noticed. Very sweet with a dry lingering bitterness. Full-bodied with a creamy texture. I'm going to let the rest warm up to room temperature see if any new flavors show themselves. As it warms I notice a strong Alcohol aroma and more Phenolic notes appear. The warmer it gets the more of the ABV is noticed and is really strong on the taste. All carbonation is gone and gives it the look of basically Brandy. Overall really good. It is worth trying again, but is not very drinkable due to the high ABV.

Flavor is a bit warm with alcohol, then allows some great malt sweetness to come through. Loads of chewy fruit flavors appear, and then a solid bitterness that seems to come from alcohol as much as it does hops. Slightly astringent as well.

4.53,1.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"i really liked the special edition of this brew, so i was very excited to pop this corked wonder, the original version. poured a dark mahogany with a huge tan head that sinks into a big-bubbled cake of clumpiness. as soon as my nose neared the rim of the glass, i immediately picked up a stong, nutty breadiness, mixed with carmalized bananas, prunes, port, and i'd almost want to say a certain clove-like spice quality. the taste is on par with the smell, if not a bit sweeter - starts quite fruity and fades into a gigantic and complex malt profile. finish is a sort of cascade (not the hop!) from savory malts to a nice, drying bitterness from the classic belgian hops. wonderful, medium to full body coats the mouth during the sip and accentuates the swallow as the mouth is given a kind of slow-draining feel. the carbonation, quite high and small-bubbled, hightens this draining/drying character, perhaps a bit too well, slightly burning the tongue and cheeks. overall, very very nice, much more rounded than its special edition brethren, however, as i look back, i may have liked the latter more, even though my reviews speak otherwise. there was something about it... maybe because it was my first real belgian quad... who knows.","isaac","Mar 03, 2007"

4.23,-5.4,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"The first pour into my 25 cL Chimay goblet raises a thin but fairly solid head, the color of heavily creamed coffee. The body color is a deep brown, tinged with garnet. The lacing is sticky enough to fall slowly in one thick curtain before leaving a line of bubbles on the glass. The aroma is quite typical for a dark, hefty Belgian ale: sweet, with dark fruits, but also hints of cocoa, and to a lesser extent, pipe tobacco. The taste is rich in maltiness and cocoa, but not as sweet as the nose might have indicated. The cocoa bits remind me of just the hints one can pick up in mole, but somewhat more intense. I love chocolate, and love finding it when I've given it up for Lent. There's a nice, strong cherry flavor that really comes through as it warms. Still, the flavor does not seem to be complex, just satisfying. It is clever for hiding its alcohol, though. The mouth is quite heavy, with just enough subtle carbonation to lift the beer partially from the palette. I'm glad I finally sat down and reviewed this after a few previous tries, since I appreciate it even more now.","mjc410","Feb 26, 2007"

It pours a dark, sedimented rusty brown with some floaties and medium carbonation leading up to a three finger, fluffy, light tan head. Initially I smell red wine, but it quickly evolves, with notes of apples, pear, coffeecake, and spiced rum, with doughy and almost oaky notes; very nice, but it is not quite as aromatic as I'd like. It is insanely complex on the palate, with cherry, red wine, rum, chocolate, molasses?, carob, caramel, apple, pear, melon rind?, banana?, orange?, currant, blackberry, anise (and maybe other spices). In addition, there are green/leafy, almost piney hops, a mild to medium bitterness, yeast, and an alcohol kick. The medium body is quite carbonated, lightly numbing and drying, with a medium to long finish.

Vanilla honey like smooth up front on the tongue with developing spicey wheat notes as the palate lengthens. The finish is a little darker and less balanced then the body pre-emps to.

This is a superb brew that demands respect in every sip, and I give it that. Thick with malt in the mouth with a carbonation that rather seizes the tongue.

The dark fruits hinted at in the nose came to life, now accompanied by dark candi sugar. The complexity here is astounding; it's like a feast of sweet malt, fruit, and candy. Some might describe it as overly sweet. Mouthfeel is of course quite bubbly, but with a nice texture that prevents you from confusing this with a Coca-cola.

4.67,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Nice muted fig color with a deep brown glow. Head is very thick and bubbly, yet without much protein. Delicate lacing up and down, head subsiding to a thick film. Smell is big on medium body savory malts, perfectly balanced fruit notes ranging from cherry and plum to apple, and a nice earthy sweetness. Yeast and phenol are definitelly in there, but it took me a good couple minutes to find them. Spices range from orange to clove. The alcohol definitely compliments the aroma, rather than overpowering it. There are so many layers in the smell alone, I spent a good five minutes just with my nose stuck in the snifter, inhaling deeply and finding something new each time. Taste is held together with a great deep malt backbone, supporting a rich brown sweetness, with a bigger emphasis on spice than on fruitiness. There are definite figgy hints, but more so are the savory spices. Peppercorn, mustard and other unidentifiable tastes glaze over a nice meaty center. The taste is not quite as layered and complex as the smell, but even falling short of that leaves it above most anything I've had. Mouthfeel is great, with an initial bite of carbonation that follows halfway back the tongue, then suddenly drops away for a smooth silky back. This is a real adventure to drink, going down smooth and easy, with so much to offer on the way. I only wish there was a category for 'smellability' because this beer would take my gold for that.

4.2,-6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a deep, hazy brown similar to that of an apple cider into a wine glass. Head is a khaki tan that fades to a moderate sticky ring of lacing along with a light coating on the top. Aroma is fruity, mostly ripe, dark fruit paired with a caramel sweetness with some earthier undertones, some spice notes, warm sugary alcohols finish out the nose. Taste is sweet, candied dry fruit, caramel, malt, light alcohol notes and a similar earthiness of the nose present as well. Sweetness increases as it warms, fruitier profile emerges as well, taste some cinnamon/nutmeg like spiciness as the fruits fade off the tongue. Light sweet and dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very low carbonation, slides down the throat. Drinkability is high, given the intriguing complexity and character of this Quad, hardly hints at it's nearly 11% abv.

This poured true, not like some other high ABV malt monsters that run thick or syrupy. There was a nice foamy white head that brought a little hop oil to the surface for me to breathe in, as well as some yeast to look at. It is a rare beer that can whollop you with flavor without killing you with its alcohol an dpotential heavyness, but this pulled off that feat. It has tremendous layers for you to go through and enjoy from toffee through stone fruit flavors, with some vanilla rounding off the edge. Much like the pour, it drank clean. I could have a few of these in one sitting, but I don't reccomend lightweights trying that. An instant classic for me.","dherling","Aug 05, 2006"

A wonderfully appetizing head rolls up and holds as a slender slab of creamy froth. Most delicious. Fluffy whips of lace cling heavily and create a rolling topography around the outskirts of this event. A few drips of yeast have peppered a tight pattern in the midground of this head. It looks like a bit of nutmeg sprinkled atop a fine dessert. The nose is complex in dark fruit subtleties. It smells like a bit of fermented black cherry. A sort of sugar crusted candy sweetness booms within the honed confines of this brew as the malt structure is notably solid. I think the yeast has contributed heavily to the delight I derive from repeated and incessant sniffing. The smell is so much different. Wild and tart with an expressive gale of alcohol. The taste is darkly fruity, alcoholic and rootish. The black fruitiness and alcoholic characters lay on the back of a creamy mouthfeel. Unique and delicious. The drinkability is super good.

The highly noticeable booziness of the aroma is stunningly masked in the flavor; all I get are dark rum-soaked plums, bing cherries, and a slightly soured date sugar sweetness at the finish. Hearty yeast-flavored aftertaste. The alcohol is slightly noticeable immediately before the finish in the form of a langorous warming at the back of the throat.

The smell is also incredible. Very floral aroma that in overwhelmingly enjoyable. The aroma of this beer definitely got you ready for the taste. The taste is amazing.

Taste is immediately almond and brown sugar then there's a flood of esters and burly molasses, drying through the finish leaving my palate aching in its wake. It's the aroma magnified by 10, and my mouth waters. Spicy alcohol and yeastiness integrated throughout. A meaty body with medium carbonation, a tad abrasive and utter perfection. I need more.","numenor1","Dec 21, 2005"

I think the draft verion, which I had two night ago has more cherry. There was a rocky head, but definitely not as much as on draft. Not a whole lot of head, but it doesn't fully diminish. Initial flavor is moderately sweet that lessens somewhat. More cherry and bread than the aroma indicated. The finish is long. This was lively on th etongue, more so than the draft version. There is a moderate alcohol feel. While this is one of my favorite quads, I think it's even better with a year on it.

The happy monk label on the bottle is pretty low budget but the beer itself is straight from beer-shambala. It poured with a nice dark blue-red color with brownish head that settled down to a finger. The complex flowery smell reminded me of cheap, artificially flavoured soft candy. The taste is actually a lot like traditional Swedish Christmas must but with a lot more alcohol.

Aroma & taste are huge and complex..big brown sugar flavors & rich malts blend perfectly with the subtle and amazing array of spices. Full mouthfeel..little carbonation.

With the addition of typical belgian trappist ale aromas (plum, sweet figs, other dried fruit, I can pick up hints of apple, pear, and the aroma is rather smooth than others i have sampled with less of a present alchol character in its smell. The taste, oh! and the taste, again contains characteristics true to most quadrupels but is set apart with how incredibley smooth and well balanced the flavors flow together. Each characteristic seems to blend into each other and leave you with this aftertaste of a wonderful mix of fruits, mollasses and a ever so slight alcohol warming. The mouthfeel is silkier than expected, but each flavor sticks to your taste buds. This is a beer that needs exploring to really get and I plan to explore.

The beer seems somewhat viscous but not overdone. I can detect dark fruits, alcohol, bread, figs, and some plum aromas. Very interesting and unique even for this style. The taste is just incredible; playful bitterness upfront with a strong, sweet malt finish that is dry and rich. A bit of warming alcohol sensation as well. Takes more like a Dubbel than a Quadrupel in terms of being an 'acquired' taste. As the beer warms, more complex and rich flavors become apparent; some spices seem to appear and linger in the aftertaste. Some roasted characteristics seem to prevail as well as the beer warms. The most incredible thing about this beer is that it is very very drinkable; the alcohol doesn't make itself known until after a glass or two.

There was a rich but receding 1.5 finger head. The beer smelled of nuts, rich chocolate, and alcohol. I cannot overstate how overwhelmingly complex this beer is. Drinking it is a joy, because as I work my way through the glass, it is a struggle to try to figure out what flavors are coming through. There is certainly a good deal of chocolate, but there is also a mild fruitiness. I certainly get a good deal of prunes. This is a wonderful beer on the whole.","bignick","Oct 26, 2005"

Wasn't sure if this was right, but reading other reviews it seems standard. Smells strongly of dark fruits, sweet roasted malt, and alcoholic vapors. Taste starts off with raisins, vinuous overripe grapes, banana esters, loads of spicy, brown sugary malts, and a hearty warming alcohol flush. Mouthfeel is smooth but crisp.

Flavor begins with some lightly tart fruit (real cherries, fig, date, plum and raisins), then some candied sugar sweetness, spices (clove, corriander, anise), malty toasted bread, some light phenols, vinous alcohol character and some light grassy and floral hops. The body on this beer is huge, with light carbonation and a creamy but thick texture with some moderate alcohol tones coming through.

The nose is full on raisin and fig character, with a nice spicey character hiding in there as well. The flavor is subdued from the nose a bit. The yeast imparts a creamy character, on top of the sweet raisin and light brown sugar character. Very nice flavor. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. I'm finding it to be a sipping beer. Not something I can drink a whole lot of at a time. I like it. Definately not as good as the same beer off tap.

4.1,-8.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This one is hard to approach without high expectations. St Bernardus, the jolly monk(and why not??) holding a chalice glass of the stuff on the label seems to exude glee, and the beer seems to as well. Abt 12, or the blue cap bottle, states simply in English on the back ""Bottle fermented beer."" This bottle poured with a medium head, making it able to pour the full bottle without having to wait for the foam to settle. I was expecting a denser head however, because it did not pour very creamily: more large bubbles than small. The head is a very lightish brown colour, and seemed comfortable and stable as a thin but full topping to the beer. The beer itself is an almost impenetrable ruby-dark brown, appearing near ebony from most angles. Lacing is excellent, leaving thin sheets around the glass that dissipate into islands. The aroma is not very assertive, but when coaxed it is quite delectable. Very sublte dark malting along with black currants and prunes. The sweetness is readily evident in the form of raisins and green apple peel like St Bernardus Tripel. Red wine and red grapes; blueberry; licorice and leather; pears and green apples; and spicy, rummy pepper that tickles the nose. This could almost pass at times for merlot or cabernet wine. A distinct creaminess asserts itself through the whole drink. The aroma is delicious, but not unlike anything I have had before; certainly nothing to make it exceptional for me personally. The taste is full of big flavours: spicy alcohol, rich malts, dark fruits and wine. The front of the tongue senses the red wine taste, tannic and dry. The middle draws out some of the toasted malts, and the finish leaves a balanced nuttiness, equal parts dry and sweet. The carbonation was a little high, and the bottle started to overflow when I popped the cap; not sure why. They have been sitting in my cellar for 2 weeks upright. Far too foamy in the mouth, this bottle. The mouthfeel is still quite thick and lingering however. Drinkability, with the balanced sweetness and small amount of alcohol in the taste, is extremely hight for a gravity such as this. I paired it with brie and 3-year aged cheddar. The brie is mostly overpowered by the beer, but the sharp taste of the aged cheddar could compete and added to the enjoyment and complexity of the beer. I fear these bottles may be a tad defective somehow; not totally, but I think the beer is not at its peak quality-wise. If it IS, though, I have tasted this beer's equal and find it good but not sensational or unique.","Cwrw","Jul 08, 2005"

The beer is full-bodied, and leaves a coating in your mouth (a good thing). I'm not that good at picking out individual flavors, but I can taste sweet fruity flavors (plums, grapes, and bananas) with malt (chocolate and bread).

4.6,2.9,4,4,5,5,4.5,"Okay, I reviewed this beer early on while I was developing my review skills. My score for it then came out at 4.9 and I've been interested in seeing if the beers holds true. Mind you, I just had a Pater 6, so my tastebuds should be primed. The number on the back of this bottle reads 271009. Oops, into the glass went all the sediment. Oh well, it's an abbey ale. Obtained from John's Grocery(Iowa City...and they kept it in a fridge) in May 2005 and consumed about a week later. Pours a 2 finger light brown particulated head over a dark brown particulated liquid. Smells of candi-sugar, alcohol, and chocolate. The alcohol is strong in i) a burning of the nose sense and ii) a volitility aspect that is different and that I can't quite describe. Taste is alcohol with chocolate beneath and a nice nutty finish. Whoa, buddy, this is quite a doozie. The alcohol stands of notice throughout, with a constantly changing and interesting background of malt, spice, and fruit. If the alcohol is the ever-present orchestra, the background is a stage-play of many phenomenal different scenes brought on stage. What the heck is that intriguing spice? It has a pepper and licorice quality about it, but isn't quite either. I've tasted it before, but can't put my finger on it...anise?...but I think more. The end is quite chocolatey, almost fudge-like, but the initial sugar sweet comes to a stark dry finish. Thick mouthfeel and moderately carbonated (a touch more than I would have liked). Nice lacing inside the glass. Really delightful. As the beer warmed, the chocolate became a persistent flavor that rivaled the alcohol. Chocolate carries so many flavors well that this beer was *much* better warm. I recommend drinking this beer between cellar and room temperature.","mentor","May 15, 2005"

Poured into my Duvel tulip, the beer has a sizeable, one-inch tan head that sticks around for a while. Body is a slightly cloudy, deep mahogany color. Nose is dominated by sweet malt and alcohol, with notes of brown sugar, yeast, and a hint of stone fruit. Palate is very nice - sweet malt is dominant, with notes of clove, allspice, and a very subtle hoppiness. The finish is dominated by warmth from the alcohol, but tempered by a lingering sweetness from the malt. Rich, creamy, warm mouthfeel is as close to perfection as you can get.

Fruit is the main impression, with yeast and barley backing that up. The mouth is very well carbonated and slightly viscous - not heavy, but there is a coating sensation on the tongue. The taste is sublime, smooth bready malt, a touch of fruity twang, a hint of hoppy bitterness. The alcohol is well concealed, but not invisible.

An initial on-slaught of delightful flavorings  plums, raisins, licorise and sweet malts; full bodied and borderline chewy. Further warming evolves figs, grapes and pears; even further into the flavoring reveals a slight hop-based backbone, brown sugar, grapes and even some coffee beans.

At first you are introduced to a rich coffee and chocolate flavor which later yields to fruitiness. There are also hints of light spicing and roasted malt which comes towards the end. In the mouth this beer had the texture and richness of good coffee. At the same time it was creamy and smooth. The aftertaste left a nice thick coating on the mouth.

The alcohol comes through quite clearly, but is carefully blended with the fruits and spices so that a dark, mellow, and delicious vinous quality ensues.

Earthy (bark and peat) and malty aromas, healthy yeasty nose, and some faint fruitiness (fig, prune, dates) and spices (cinnamon, ginger and anise). Luxurious in the tongue, heavy malt and fine carbonation give a creamy mouthfeel. Slightly malty sweet, but subtle fruity qualities and a fine yeastiness compact the overall impression of the taste into a fever pitch.

Poured a murky, rootbeer brown. Creamy, rocky head and spicy aroma, both yeast and alcohol. Spicy on the tongue, with an unusual dark flavor lurking in the background - not soy sauce, but something akin to that in the manner of a dark, fermented flavor, but more tannic, like flavors leached from a wooden ageing cask.

The aroma is sweet cherries with the uniquely earthy Belgian yeast strain. The taste at first sip is an explosively spicy alcohol. After that initial attack, other flavors start to emerge. The most notable of these is a lingering hop bitterness that is much stronger than most other beers that fall under the broad umbrella of Belgian styles. The bitterness is not overpowering in any way, and allows the fruitiness of the malt to open up in the background. I imagine as this fresh beer settles down, the character would become more malty and complex, and thanks to the new Georgia law allowing this elixir to enter our fair state, I can find out how it will age without much problem. This beer packs a heck of a punch at 10% ABV. After the 330 ml bottle is downed, there is a fire in the belly that radiates out to the extremities. Very drinkable, even at this potency. I WILL be having more.","rajendra82","Jul 01, 2004"

A thin cap of lace is left on top with sheets of bubbly film rising up the edges of the glass. Aroma is sweet and fruity, of fig and raisin and currant. Some spice and orange peel as well, and a bit of clove. Also I detect some of the alcohol in the nose. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Flavor is rich and sweet, not cloying, but close to it. There is caramel and toffee, sweet cinnamon and plum, and a bit of alcohol in the finish. No strong yeast flavors, but a little too rich to be very drinkable for me.","far333","Jun 03, 2004"

Fruit hits the palate first with some malts and finishes with a nutty aftertaste and a little dry. But goes down so easy and it's so smooth. I'm so glad my local store got this beer finally.

Taste is candi sugar, brown chocolate, hugely malty, but even more so intensively yeasty with a bit of bananas, prunes and plums and a light restrained alcohol bite. Body is medium and creamy. Wow, this is so yeasty, I wouldn't expect this from myself, but maybe too much for its own good.

The flavor is all I want it to be, keeping one's attention with the interplay between all the individual pieces. The high ABV is well mitigated by everything else this excellent ale has to offer, though it does raise a wisely heeded flag of caution.

Poured a beautiful deep brown/light brown with a deep tan head. When held up to a light the beer turns a nice amber color around the edges. The smell is amazing. This has to be one of my favorite smelling beers. A malty raisin sweetness rises from the glass. This is one enjoyable beer to drink. There are a lot of flavors present with some bold fruit tastes evident at first before gently yielding to a pleasant maltiness. It is very hard to taste any alcohol even as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy which lends to this beers incredible drinkability. This is one of my favorite beers and definitely worth a try.","soper2000","Mar 02, 2004"

Silky smooth blend of spices (cloves come to mind), fruit flavors, and strong malts. The alcohol isn't overally noticable and will sneak up on you. Aftertaste is a lingering fruity taste with that strong feeling a smooth creamy beer. Great beer for the style. This is something I'll be looking for again.","stewart124","Feb 01, 2004"

When the head receded, an intricate lacing pattern was left behind. The dark ruddy-brown beer was very cloudy and riddled with particulates. The sharp nose was malty and quite fruity, with notes of cherry, raisin, and coconut, with a wisp of alcohol sneaking through. The full-bodied and slighty fluffy beer was a delight for the taste buds. The fantastic slightly tart malt backbone faintly resembled a Flemish brown and was accompanied by notes of cherry, cinnamon, and banana, with a fairly dry finish. The collection, strength, and balance of flavors was perfection. No wonder why the fellow on the bottle is so happy!","HiroProtagonist","Jan 25, 2004"
4.82,7.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured a dark hazy brown. Looked like fresh apple cider, but with a giant tan head that would not go down. I had to wait almost 5 mins before I could take a sip. But it was so worth the wait. The smell was sweet and malty. Very fruity, especially banana. But not real banana, like the banana flavor of banana gum or ice cream. The taste was also laden with the banana flavor, but mixed with sweet malt and other fruits flavors as well as spices like clove and perhaps nutmeg. I found the alcohol to be hidden well, although I guess some would disagree. The mouthfeel was creamy and thick. Carbonation was much less biting than I expected considering the huge head it produced when poured. Drinkability was also great. I wouldn't expect it to be with a high abv like this, but I can't help myself. The taste is so good that I must have another. To me beer just doesn't get much better than this. I will definatly buy this again.","Ieatlambfries","Jan 24, 2004"
4,-10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"11.2 oz bottle sampled on 12/30/03, out of a St Bernardus goblet that came with the four bottle sampler pack purchased that day in Blacksburg, Virginia(Vintage Cellar had 4 or 5 left then). In addition to the smiling Monk on the label, is a ""best before date"" in Flemish, French, and a couple other languages, that tell you to drink it before the end of 2005. Okay, I'll bite. Didn't know at the time of sampling if I would last into 2004. The Belgian ale pours into the goblet a deep, dark brown, almost opaque. The head is enormous, beige, and frothy with an abudance of tiny bubbles. Lacing slowly climbs down the glass. The aroma is of a classic brown Belgian strong ale. Bigtime Bananas in the nose, followed by the spice cabinet of coriander and allspice. Medium bodied in the mouth, tart, and a lot of carbonation. Taste begins tart and spicy. The alcohol is not well disguised. Plenty of earthy Belgian yeast notes are also on the palate. The tart fruits(grapes and plums on steroids) ride a solid malt backbone to a smooth, yet powerful finish. Very good ale, and worthy of its lofty rating. Personally, I prefer the St Bernardus Pater 6. The alcohol in the 12 is just a bit too overpowering.","merlin48","Jan 23, 2004"

It starts out lighter in body and taste and then expands to a deep thickness. I can't believe it's 10% abv because the body and taste would tell me otherwise. The initial flavor reminds me of raisinettes. Dry fruit flavor resinates. A bready flavor ensues mixed with some yeast. It's not the base but it's very solid in the body.

The first sip of this brownish colored abbey style ale is bits of caramel and fruit. There's some green apple in the aroma, which in any other beer, could be considered a flaw. Almost smoky caramel flavors with bits of dark fruit such as figs or plums. Periously drinkable for its strength.

A very thick lasting rocky head tops this beer, it is very well carbonated. Very spicy tasting, accompanied by a certain mustiness. Finishes with a bit of sweetness. The dense rocky head and the Belgian lacing on this beer is quite amazing. Alcohol in the finish, along with a certain astringency. Malty, fruity, caramel notes, and a strong finish of rich fruit (perhaps plum and/or cherry). Quite a complex brew. Very light in body but quite a mouthful that will hit you when you stand up.

The body is a very dark brown, cloudy. The nose is earthy, similar to some of the smells of a vegetable garden towards the end of harvest. The first flavor that hit me was cotton candy but this was while I was getting nothing but foam. It also seemed a little hot then. There's a butteriness to it that blends nicely into the chocolate and toffee malts. Ripe bananas over peaches a bit past their prime meld in nicely as well. Very low bitterness and the alcohol is covered extremely well. There's also a slight vinous character to it and there's something there that reminds me of the homemade wine my church uses for Communion. The mouth feel is very slick and creamy.

Dark fruits (mostly plum), yeast spiciness, caramelly sweetness, and a good amount of coconut. Alcohol is only very slightly noticeable in the aroma, impressive for a 10% brew. What a taste! This is delicious! It's like doppelbock meets Belgian strong ale. At the front, sweet and spicy with caramel and that special yeast spiciness. Noticeable after that in the middle is a slight coconut character on top of the aforementioned flavors. Dark fruits (raisin, fig, and plum) make up the rest of the full body. Alcohol is not at all detectable in the flavor, but it does eventually show up in another form, numbing your mouth a good deal and making your head spin a bit. Retro-olfaction brings out some bready maltiness. Good amount of carbonation for the mouthfeel; not too much, not too little. I'm definitely reminded of the reasons for this being my favorite beer style. Even the aftertaste leaves you wanting more. This has become one of my favorite beers, #1 or 2 even, if I were to make a list. If you run across this, don't even think of leaving the store without it. It is a bit pricey, but less than a lot of the other Belgians, and definitely worth it. I was informed that this was only recently made available to us here in Arizona. I picked it up in a gift pack. I hope after the gift pack season is over they'll still carry this beer.","hyuga","Jan 01, 2003"
4.75,6.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"My bottle listed alcohol as 10% by volume. Alcohol definitely present in the taste. Quite creamy, large head, remained prominent throughout. Significant lace. Nice, somewhat spicy fragrance and taste. Clearly a very high quality beer. I followed this with a Rochefort 10, which was a quite different (and ultimately more enjoyable) experience! This is like a slightly thinner Westy 12. Not as rich or complex as the Westy, but not far off. Very good, gets better as it warms. Handles the 10% abv quite well. Better than Chimay blue (IMO), and I'll certainly take it over Trios Pistoles. One of the best!","JohnnyDuvel","Dec 30, 2002"
4.57,2.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Murky reddish brown hue. Well retained, thick, light tan head. Yeast derived nuttiness and rustic must at first in aroma, ensued by ripe peach like fruitiness, mellow banana esters and notes of molasses and butter. Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering. Abt 12 is a delicious, complex, and supremely drinkable brew. Flavorwise, it's reminescent of their 8, although much more pronounced all around. Highly recommended and worth the cost.","marc77","Dec 25, 2002"
4.85,8.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white sudsy head that left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. A flavor of malt, caramel and spicy fruit. A very strong flavor element and finish going on with this beer. A very impressive beer.","Wildman","Nov 28, 2002"
4.77,6.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Gotta give props to pbrian for this beer, the last one left from his shipment.  What a beer!  Thanks.","Bighuge","Nov 12, 2002"
5,11.9,5,5,5,5,5,"St. Bernardus has been a long time favorite beer and brewery, and is one of only 8 beers from my nearly 6000 sampled life time to get a 5.0 from me. It is a beer that I have a case or two of at all times, and trust me it only improves with age. The beer emerges from the 12 ounce bottle a slightly bemused brown color with a majestic crown of tan to top off the body, the texture is semi creamy, and the lace forms a satin skirt to surround the glass. Nose is sumptuous, nutty sweet, bubble gummy, raisin like, fresh and pleasing to the senses, a most ""Sniffable"" beer. Front is ambrosial with a nice malt presence, the top is light to medium in its feel to the palate, with the finish congenially dry, magisterially hopped, notably acidic with a pleasant tummy warming sensation to top it all off, a treasure not to be missed if your into ""Belgian Ales", and or just like a great beer.","Gusler","Oct 09, 2002"
4.92,10.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This beer kicks Chimay's ass, but has difficulty in the ring with a Rochefort 10.  Taking a drink of this foamy maple-brown Abbey creation is like taking a bite of a caramel covered apple, with a hint of brown sugar added for flavor.  The slick salesman monk on the label conveys the beauty of this beer marvelously.  Looks and tastes like the beer has not changed or lost a bit of it's originality since it was first brewed.  Truly one of the most complex strong belgians out there.  St. Bernardus is one hell of a brewery.","mmthompson33","Aug 30, 2002"
2.73,-38.9,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"i'll have to be a real bastard here and disagree with everyone, i just thought it was too strong for its own good, the alcohol showed way to much. Quite simplitic for such a malty strong brew, i'm glad i tried it, and i'm sorry for the low rating, but thats just how i felt about it, it was a bit sickly i think.","rastaman","Jul 22, 2002"
4.6,2.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Nice dark brown/black color. Huge head (which seems to be a trend in the style of beer).   Malty, fruity character.  Very apparent candy/sugary taste.  A very enjoyable and drinkable beer.","jreitman","May 06, 2002"
4.38,-2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lots of sediment, thicker pour, nice cloudy color, tan head. A bit spicey with hints of <cough>strawberry</cough>. It's actually quite smooth given the ABV. Hits like a horse.","packetknife","Apr 28, 2002"
4.55,1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Huge head that settles down to a protective pillow over your beer.  Malt and dark fruit aromas.  Oh so smooth, creamy and full bodied.  Hits your mouth spritzy but then slides down your throat in a flash, leaving you with a warm alcohol buzz and a mouth-coating sweetness.  Flavors detected are raisons, rum, spicey yeast.  The overall profile leaves no doubt about the use of candy sugars.  When I came back to the last sip an hour later, the fusel alcohol came out my nose.  Great beer to savor, although I thought the sticky sweetness kept it from reaching the stars.","pbrian","Apr 03, 2002"
4.55,1.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Sheer bliss. Viewed as an abbey beer. According to Daisy (owner of 't Brugs Beertje), this beer follows the same recipe, uses the same water and its hops comes from the same hop regions as Westvleteren. ""Abt"" means the ""highest rank."" They also make a ""Prior"" at about half the strength.","Todd","Oct 13, 2001"
