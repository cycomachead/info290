In all that snow globe mess were some hues that would have liked to be seen.  Thin head of off white foam that did not last but refreshed on each swirl.  Nose is a touch of booze and dark sweet bread.  Fruity, raisin, prune, a bit of sugar and molasses.  taste is darn sweet with candi sugar and brown sugar.  Lots of dark fruits in there.  Body is heavy and mouthfeel is full and chewy in places.  The carbonation was not as good as it should be so this drank thickly and flatly.  The finish was cloying and not dry but thankfully not hot either.  Brunt sugar, raisins and prune finish this one pretty syrupy.","utopiajane","Nov 27, 2014"

AROMA: toffee and peat malt dominate the nostrils; fruity yeasts--peach, pear, apple--provide a floral balance... PALATE: active, warm, full-bodied--worth sipping of 10% ABV; like a strong ale in texture, but a bit buttery too... TASTE: complex fruit--plum, black currants, and banana--with clove cigarettes and milk stout properties--a demanding,, playful experience...

It's quite sweet & malty even after 2 months of aging. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but there is not as much carbonation as one would expect.

The beer poured out as a traditional brown color with a cream colored head on top. The retention wasn't too bad here but there wasn't any lacing at all. The smell of the beer was bready and fruity, there were also some aromas of caramel in there too. The taste of the beer has a sweet start to it that gives off flavors that coinside with the nose of the beer. The finishing flavors remind me of bubblegum. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and gives the beer is a decent dry finish. Overall it's not a terrible Quad and I'm thankful for that.

A very dark beer with maroon and purple highlights when held to the light. Good Belgian quad aromas of root beer, cola, cherries and spice waft from the glass. Carbonation not absent when drinking, but certainly subdued, and at least a bit more would have elevated what is a rich, heavy style. The bright spiciness and winey cherry fruit kept the beer surprisingly drinakble, however. A wonderfully complex interplay of rich flavors. I hope to try a better sample someday.","kenito799","Beers"

I love the rich complexity. The high alcohol is well hidden by its fruity and malty sweetness, and as big as this beer is it is surprisingly easy-drinking.

4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sensational brew. Im not going to say this is on par with Westvleteren or Rochefort, but this is definately one of the better American examples Ive tried. A little confused by it low score, perhaps its a newer, more improved batch. Yum, this is a great beer. The mouthfeel could definately be a bit creamier and more heavy and I wish the finish was a little more lasting, BUT this is still a great brew, worth seeking out.","Crosling","Dec 15, 2006"
4.22,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D: I wrote this beer off after an earlier tasting but clearly that was premature. This is a strong quad, full of malty strength and a very nice product. Thank God for second chances!","akorsak","Nov 27, 2006"
4.04,4.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Caged and corked Belgian bomber. $7.50 from New Beer in NYC. No vintage/bottling info. Opened with no pop, hmm, poured with little head being generated, low carbonation noted. Darkest of brown shades, no head, no lacing. Nose is strongly of raisiny bourbon. Strong, heady brew, notes of more raisins, cola, vanilla,brandy, dark grains and ripe fruits, on the sweet side, could use some more thickness on the palate. Fine brew that could use some more complexity and depth to earn world class scores. I'd like to try this one with a year or two in the bottle. Still well worth a try. Nice cold weather night caper.","Billolick","Nov 02, 2006"

4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Drinkability/Overall: Another completely solid beer from Sly Fox. Ridiculously drinkable for a quad of 10%. Not a mind-blower, but well-made on most fronts and hart to fault in too many places.","Golden2wenty1","Sep 07, 2006"

3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Still, and slightly viscous with a sweet syrupy quality to it. Apples and tropical fruit mingle with a heady alcohol sensation that warms as it trickles down the throat.	 Definitely a sipping beer, this would make a nice aperifit, as it shares some characteristics with a botrysized wine.","cbl2","Jun 10, 2006"

3.29,-14.5,2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability & Notes  Nothing makes this one hard to drink, its relatively balanced and the alcohol is in check, but the flavor just isn't what it could be. Its a solid beer, but in a category that has so many breathtaking beers, this one is lackluster.","OldSock","May 23, 2006"
3.57,-7.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a ruby-burgundy color with minimal carbonation and only the slightest bit of head. Aromas of plums, raisins, alcohol, and maple seemed to come out nicely. The taste was sweet with fruity undertones, as might be expected for the style. Very subtle hops in the finish, but not as smooth as might be desired with the flavor profile. Overly dry and yet crisp; the beer didn't seem to flow very well from initial sip to the finish; very disjointed. The sweetness was more like that of a doppelbock with fruit flavors taking a back seat to the malt sweetness. A good beer, one worth trying, but not a great example of the style due to several flaws.","jaluria","Apr 29, 2006"

4.25,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"the thick, heavy, fruity sweetness is exactly what I'd hoped for from this quad, and even a bit more. It's blended very craftily, and even slyly, if I may, each piece meshing well with the others. The ABV is never shy, and it gives fair and due warning. Wisdon says heed it. If you're looking for crisp and refreshing, look elsewhere. But if you want a hearty, rewarding quadruppel, look no further...you've found it here.","Foxman","0"

The head holds on, the mouthfeel exceptional and the complexity and balance are truly remakrable. This stuff is not for light hearted the ABV is well over 10.

4.02,4.4,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer is really something different,whats up with the sticky bottle cap?Pours a deep chesnut brown with some ruby hues with no head to speak of.The aroma is of Xmas fruit cake and some alcohol notes.The taste starts out very sweet with some dried fruit thrown in there,its a sweet beer but not overdone.Iam sure I couldnt drink more than this bottle but still a very good,well made beer.","oberon","Apr 07, 2003"
4.55,18.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This beer poured a combination of mahogany and chestnut colors that had scarlet tones on the edges when held to the light. It produced a light beige colored head that quickly faded into a simple ring on the outside edges, and left behind no lace. The aroma was intoxicating but not over-powering, aromas of deep dark malts and sweet malts, caramel, dark fruits (black cherry, plum, raisin), soft wood tones, a slight roasted grain and the warmth of alcohol all filled my nose and mouth. The flavors were just as intoxicating, seductive and more pronounced. My tongue tasted rich malts (roasted, sweet), dark fruits (plums, raisins, black cherries), caramel, a warming alcohol, candied sugar, slight bread grains and a hint of spice. The taste that stayed on my tongue - were of the sweet candied sugar, and the warmth of the alcohol. The body of this beer can only described as thick and spoony (at the warmer temperature at which it was served). Very rich and creamy all through the taste, from the first sip to the last. A very complex beer that should be sipped, savored and respected to the very end. The bottle label was correct.","Jarod","Apr 07, 2003"
4.5,16.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is an excellent beer. Fruity, whisky, malty and delicious. It also is high on the alcohol content and you can taste it throughout. A great ale for a nightcap or with chocolate, it warms the tongue and throat. Sip this and let it warm to enjoy the full range of flavors. An excellent Belgian Quad that doesn't overpower the senses too much.","bierman2000","Mar 22, 2003"
4.07,5.7,3.5,4,4,5,4,"Flavorful, complex and very interesting. Some of this beer was spilled and in 2 minutes my fingers felt as sticky as a movie theater floor. Beautiful dark ruby red color  with a short lived small head. This is a definite sipping beer for me, unless youre insane and decide to gulp it down. The hops in this beer were pretty subdued and taken over by all heavy malt sweetness and sugars. A nice treat that I would even consider warming up on a cold rainy night, rather than drinking it chilled.","pezoids","Mar 01, 2003"

4.43,15.1,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a dark burgundy, almost a satin mahogany color. Distinct degree of carbonation is noticable with a generous foam of bubbles which forms this delicate tan head that quickly fades. As it warms and I swirl it gently, there is this hint of a sweet, fruity bouquet. As the aroma becomes more noticable, I finally need to accomplish the task at hand and give the poor palate a chance to participate in this splended sensory situation. WOW!! The old tastebuds were blessed with this banquet of dark delicious dates (filled with cream cheese), plums, and red rasberries. I poured some more of this charming concoction and tasted. This effervescence display of bubbles which are released would dance and dart within the tasting chamber providing another unexpected sensation to enjoy. There is this wonderful warming effect with this slight, but noticable, brown sugar-like finish. The finish is dry and sweet, but not overpowering. What a lovely treat on such a miserable, cold winter night.","rotsaruch","Beers"
4.38,13.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ichor means ""Blood of the Gods", and its appearance is quite appropriate! The body appears almost black at first, but reveals a deep ruby with a mahogany cast when held to the light. Carefully poured it's quite clear, leaving the yeast sediment almost completely behind (it's bottle conditioned). The creamy, one-fingered head is light-tan in color, holds quite well, and leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is rich with fruitiness (the skins of dark fruits melded with fresh berries) and a soft yeasty spiciness. The body is firmly medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's lightly zesty on the tongue before warming to display a supple creaminess. The flavor is astoundingly rich with mouth coating sweet malt & caramelized sugars wrapped in dark fruit (plum/prune, grape/raisin, fig) and spice. Intense! There's an underlying layer of leafy/floral hop flavor and balancing bitterness. The alcohol is exceptionally well-cloaked and only reveals itself slowly throughout the goblet; but mainly in the finish where it helps to dry, and accentuates the spiciness of the yeast. It's exceptionally well-balanced and the malt and spice linger just long enough to be completely satisfying but not cloying. Very well done and well worth seeking out. This is clearly a beer that will improve with age for some time; drying a bit, softening it's already subtle alcohol, and possibly increasing it's complexity. It may hold for close to a decade as any sherryish notes that arise will only add to its deep, dark, fruitiness.","NeroFiddled","0"
