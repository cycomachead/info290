"- overall one of the most exciting takes on one of my favorite beer styles"
""
""
"This seems to be a hybrid dry stout/quad.  Tasty and works well with a early afternoon of people watching and light conversation."
""
"This was a great beer.  A friend brought it over and I was skeptical.  It turned out to be a very tasty Belgium beer"
""
"Sampled at a recent bottle share I hosted. As far as quads go, I'd put this one in the bottom half. Just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the 22 oz bomber into a cervoise, this one is a clear dark ruby/chestnut color with lots of bubbly precipitation fuelling a solid off white head which is initially about 1-2 fingers slowly fading to a thick collar and spotty cap with nice lacing.  Nose of sweet dark fruits and sweet malt.  Mouth is semi-chewy and quite bubbly for style.  Flavors of big fruits up front, hints of sweet slightly smokey malt, a bit of alcohol burn on the back.  Finishes on a bitter, fairly strong hops note.  Feels very “American-quad-ish” and not nearly as subtle as Belgian quads and other similar styles. Not bad at all but nowhere near the level of the best in style.  No doubt would benefit from cellaring."
""
""
""
"Sweet improved with correct temperature.  (55 degrees F)"
"O - 4.5 - One of the better quads I've drank in a long time. It's no Trappistes Rochefort 10 or a Not The Stoic, but it's one of the best I've had in some time. Once again, I can't believe how well balanced this beer is. Definitely suggested and recommended to fans of the style!"
"O – Very dominant with the triticale. It is a good beer if you like triticale, I think they could have done much better, and this would be absolutely ridiculous if it were barrel aged."
""
"4.0 D:  Very good beer.  No real faults and the triticale brings a new flavor into the mix."
"The aroma has a pleasing note of stone fruit, some raisin and Orange peel. The flavor has a delicate raisin and candied orange with a rounded sweetness, without being too heavy or sweet. This is really good."
""
""
""
""
"So smooth. So tasty. Everything a beer is supposed to be."
"cozy winter treat"
""
""
""
"Taste follows nose. Much more wheaty than a traditional Belgian but very good!"
""
""
"Overall an OK quad but nothing extraordinary. Glad it wasn't sweeter."

"C-"
"O:  one of the best American Quads I've had.  great flavors, a killer nose and solid complexity makes me wish this beer was a rotational thing instead of a one time only release."
""
"Personal notes: reminiscent of my early attempts at home brewing belgian ales both in flavor and smell."
""
"Powerful alcohol punch. Not too tasty."
""
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 06/02/14.  Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy reddish/brown color with about a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for very long.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums, figs), brown sugar, sweet spices, cloves and some dark bread.  I think the taste pretty much follows the aroma, but there's also some apple and a weird herbal bitter (kinda like a Ricola cough drop) finish noticeable.  That bitterness bugged me at first, but luckily it didn't bother me for long.  Guess I just got used to it!  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall I liked this brew, definitely worth trying!  $8.99 a bottle."
""
"Delightful. Smooth, rich, and we'll balanced. Sweet but not too sweet."
""
"One of the best Belgium Quads I've had. Well balanced. Amazingly smooth for 9.3%"
""
""
"I think the best feature of this is the restrained sugar for such a rich brew. The flavor is just plain weird, though. Slight bitter finish. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach. Moderately priced (Stone's best feature, IMHO!) so it's worth a try if you like a strong and strange brew."
""
"Good looking and smelling beer. The taste was a little off from what I had hoped for."
""
""
"Not sure I would have two of these in a row but I would do it again. More please?!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22 oz Bomber.Very sweet with a taste of pairs maybe apples.Not really for me.Good ABV at 9.3."
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent brew, but a little off in flavor for me.  A decent quad, but not really worth the $8.99 price tag in comparison to other more renowned quads."
""
"Dark Amber color, with a quarter inch head that dissipated within a minute to a very light film. Aroma was very faint with just some light caramel notes and just a hint of dark fruit. Taste was lots of dark fruit, molasses, and some spicy flavors. Mouthfeel was pretty thin for a quad. Overall, this one was a bit disappointing - usually Stone's offerings are a little better."
""
""
"All this leads to an easier drinking quad. Aging this might make it too mellow, but I may buy a bottle to do that just to see. It's a nice quad to use for introducing someone to the style, though it is not really a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly drinkable! Really good!"

"(3.80) O: Overall smooth flavor, silky campfire minearlity, nice dark belgian."
""
""
""
"To be sure, this was strong but it went down as easily as any Quad that I've ever had. It looks and pours like one and has enough dates and fig in it to make one think that this was one. The feel was like a Barleywine, as I said before, and it's a testament to the moderate carbonation and subtle potency of this. This was greats stuff that was unlike any Quad I've had before and both fans of Belgian beers and Stone's offerings will love what they've come up with here!"
""
"overall I loved it and am looking up how to get a hold of some triticale myself to brew with some of it and some of that yeast too!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown color, big raisiny dried fruity flavors sweet fruity maltiness with a hint of alcohol and bready grain. Interesting brew, a bit of cereal graininess but a serviceable sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall.  Interesting take on a Belgian beer.  The triticale must smooth it out. The beer has a peculiar thin quality to the mouthfeel.  Also, the grain bill is smooth like a wheat characteristic.  Balanced pretty well for a big beer.  Would probably buy again."
""
""
"Rich body with lots of alcohol warmth as one would expect from a Quad.  No sweetness--just dry, dark caramel.  There's a bit of hop bitterness in the swallow and aftertaste.  This is a perfect beer to balance spicy food.  Low carbonation, truly coats the tongue and throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A Belgian quad that has the elements in place. However, I found this brew was taken over by the candied sugar. Some minor tweaks with this one would sure let the other ingredients shine and make it more true to the style."
""
"Bomber poured into a tulip, another brew from the initial wave of Stone offerings to arrive in Alberta. I enjoy reading the wordy tangential musings on these labels. This brew is on the light side color wise, a bronze amber with a small amount of frothy beige foam in top. Does leave a nice thick lacing on the glass. Aroma is rich and sweet, Christmas pudding-like with some toasted grains, dark fruits, brown sugar, and cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger all nicely melded together. Dangerously smooth and drinkable, comes across as light-medium bodied (its easy to forget that even the biggest Trappist/abbey ales are still supposed to err on the side of drinkable, to hear the monks talk). Gentle carbonation. Malts evoke honeyed breakfast cereal and a little chocolate pudding, molasses, and a puff of dark roast wheat. Getting a decent dose of orchard and tropical fruit on the nose and palate, mango (!), orange, and poached pears. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and white pepper spice round out the flavor profile. Rich sweet taste but does not become cloying, with more emphasis on malts and fruity hops than classic Belgian spicy phenols. Certainly a unique take on the style, with west coast hop flourishes and a rounded sweetness that can be less apparent in the true Belgian examples. Bold like most Stone beers yet with a pleasing subtle complexity."
""
""
""
"An interesting breakdown of what a Quadruple-style ale can and could be, beyond the more delineated BSDA guidelines - pick yer grains, and go to town, son!  Way more drinkable than I sadly prepared myself for (sorry, Stone), but still all new-world in its complexity, which is a miser's trade-off, to be sure.  Whatever, I'm enjoying making my way through this, and for that, I am one content lab rat."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer but watery thin. Didn't seem to match name (Quad)  or malt build you'd expect with listed abv.  Kind of a ""session"" quad despite high octane."

"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a very good lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sugary grain nose and flavor is grains, Belgian yeast and brown sugar. $7.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
"O - Does not strike me as a typical quad, but I found it a pleasant beer to drink.  Complex notes, it is much lighter than the typical quad I've had.  If this is what triticale delivers, however, brew more with this special grain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is great, I saw a stone quad and was stoked since I never had such a thing... no let down one bit... only negatives where a little hot on the aroma and no lacing to speak of... beyond that the taste is amazing and overall just a great brew."

"I have tried and enjoy many of Stone's beers, perhaps it's the labels, pictures of evil beasts and dark ritual symbols. Who knows?  I was looking around the beer store to see if the new Game of Thrones had arrived, since it had not I went looking for something g different. This caught my eye as I had trouble with the name, it was in the cold case so I could drink it right away and it was made by stone. Beautiful amber pour, very light head that dissappered immediately. Not a heavy beer by any means. Went well with the sushi I ate for dinner. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""

""

"The spiciness works with the quad surprisingly well, & it ain’t every day you actually find something unique out there anymore. This is a very good brew."

"Overall:  I enjoy quads and was intrigued by the triticale grain so I picked up a bottle.  It's not as big in flavor as the Trappist quads, but does give a nice drinking experience.  I couldn't really tell anything special about the grain used.  Body was a little lighter than most quads I've had."

"Overall a nice half-twist on a quad style and a pretty delicious beer."

"Beautifully done.  Another great one from Stone."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has a lot of good aspects - the smell and feel are great - but the unpleasant aspects of the taste keep it from being enjoyable."
"Overall a decent drinking brew but nothing special."
""
"O: tbh I didn't make it through this bomber.  I was really looking forward to this beer, as I do enjoy quads and I was happy to see a non-hopped up Stone offering.  While I commend Stone for experimenting, perhaps better would have been just a nicely done barrel-aged quad. Nonetheless, I knew going into it, it would be different. I would not buy this again"
""
""
"raisin and other unique flavors for a quad...not my favorite"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This reminds me of a heavy rye ale.... very dry and not the sweet maltiness of a ""normal"" quad.  I would not buy this again, should they brew this style again."

"And no, I do not know how to pronounce the nme."
"Pours a ruby brown.  Decent initial tan head.  Very malty, sweet bread, robust and chewy.  Mild hoppiness.  Lite but pleasant finish.  Very nice beer."
"This beer pours a deep red with a lingering tan head that sticks around. Good lacing. Smells like fruit punch with prominent alcohol. The taste is pretty much also like alcoholic fruit punch, with a good pit of dark candy as it warms. Decent beer but not great. And don't bother trying to pronounce the name."
""
""
""
"O: Another really good beer by Stone, but I expect nothing less."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not really a traditional quadruple, and nor should it be expected to be one, being brewed by Stone. It definitely hits some totally Belgian conventions, but it's also kind of apparent that it was conceived by a brewery which generally specializes in abundantly bitter and hoppy brews, as there are some surprising IPA traits in here. In the end, I'm damn glad I tried it, because it's not only flavorful and aromatic, but distinctly different from any other beer I've sampled. It's an interesting little bastard child of traditional Belgian ales and American ales that have been hopped to hell. This is the bastard Stone WON'T acknowledge, hahaha!"
"Pretty nice take on the style, would probably age great"

"O. Outstanding beer that I would like to revisit in several small trips over time. I filled a 10 oz tulip glass and recapped the beer for another time."
""

"22 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 6/9/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby/copper color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast/rye spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, clove, pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toast, spicy rye, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent specialty grain Quad style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. The spicy rye-like triticale grain added a very nice amount of spiciness on the finish which I really liked. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is a phenomenal belgian quad, albeit, it is a hoppier version than anything you're likely to find in Belgium. It has a beautifully balanced bitterness which makes it very drinkable. Highly recommended, and I would definitely buy it again and recommended to my belgian beer loving friends."
"D - A nice experience."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Don't know if it was worth the hype some people put behind it. Buy it and split it with a buddy, might be worth your time over a cigar. Salud!"

"It's a little bubbly and spritzy, not light-bodied but a little shallow for a Quad. Crispness needs time to calm down a bit, which it eventually does, and the feel is moderately, but not completely, clean."

"Overall not bad, going to have to pick up a few more to cellar"

"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a good and slightly unique example of the style, it had most of the aspect that I would expect from a Quad, but in typical Stone Style it seems like the flavors are bolder than they are traditionally, but they still retain nice balance. This beer had good drinkability it was smooth, the alcohol was hidden nicely, it was almost slightly cloying, rich, a little silky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, half the bottle might be the perfect amount for me, but I think I could take out a whole bottle if I really wanted to. What I like the most about this beer was that it was just a good overall beer and it didn't really have any weak points. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but I do wish that the Tritcale was a little more noticeable, I think I picked it up in the aroma, but that same aspect didn't stick out to me in the taste. I would buy this beer again, if I see another one I would for sure grab it and it throw it in the cellar to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or people who just like malty beers in general. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I haven't had the greatest luck when it comes to Stone and Belgian style beers, but this one turned out to be a pretty good beer and I have to say that I enjoyed a lot more than the past few other Stone Releases. It isn't my favorite Stone beer, but it is one of the better American made Quads I've had and I would say it's my favorite beer I've had in this series since I didn't care too much for the Grapefruit beer. Good job guys, this was one enjoyable beer, keep up the hard work."

"Overall- an excellent take on the style. It's unfair to compare this to Belgian quads- it's Stone's adventurous approach to the style. The beer is very balanced- from aroma to finish. Highly underrated. Will search for another bottle to cellar."
""
"Pours a dark copper color with a thick fringe of mocha trimmings. Not much of a nose on this cloyingly sweet 9.3% bubble-gum beast. Beneath all the sugar hides a bit of caramel... but it's hiding far too well. All in all - sacharine sweet and then some - I'm one and done with this brew... sadly, couldn't even finish it."
""
"Sorry Stone for what I'm about to write. Starts out innocent enough. Nice looking ale. Tawny brown, nice dense head, lacing as the head dissappates. And thats where it ends. Smells of too much tricale, too much rye, and nothing like a quad. Aroma has a burnt quality too it. None of the stone fruit, plum like or other typical quad aromas. Same goes for the flavor. I'm looking for the banana and molasses stone says is there, clove...no...brown sugar...no. Thick, but also spritzy. Second shot at a stochasticity beer, 2nd let down. Sorry Stone."
""
""
""
"The flavor is better and more like a quad.  Has a distinctive but very well balanced and interesting mix of flavors."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"The first beer I've tried from Stone's pet project, and I quite enjoyed it. A distinctive take on a Belgian classic that has some decent aging potential, though I'm not sure how the triticale character would fare over time."
""
""
"O: This is a delicious brew and I really wonder how this would age. Delicious but perhaps a bit sweet, but it is a quad so that's expected."
"Botlted on 04/17/14. 22oz bottle served in pint glass. Beer pours a wonderful garnet, very syrupy in viscosity, and forming nearly no head. Aroma is rather rich, suggesting plums and currants. The unique grain used here is immediately recognizable as contributing an unfamiliar flavor to this beer. There's not a lot of hops masking the peculiar grain bill in this Quad. There's not a lot of the yeasty flavor distinctive in Belgian 3s and 4s. What there is is the distinctive sweet note of Belgian Candi sugar. But I'm actually finding the flavor a little bit thin, considering there's clearly so much going on here, gravity wise, it leaves me wanting more in the middle of the palate. More that specialty barley malts, or conventional rye malts, would have provided. But this beer is actually intensely drinkable, and smooth despite it's 9.3 per cent ABVs. The carbonation is also thankfully low, which helps."

""

"Ooohh, thats pretty good, I was not expecting that. The triticale gives it a hearty sugar cookie flavor and blends well with the light (for a quad) fruitiness. Lots of breadiness and is really smooth. Mothfeel is full despite the lighter (for a quad) coloring. Everything blends together very well. I am in the midst of wondering if I should buy another bottle or two, rare for me with bombers anyway. The triticale really does add a unique dimension to the beer and (I think) gives it the deliciousness I am finding here. Recommended for sure."
""
""
""
"Big, estery beer. Big hits of apple and banana. There are other fruits-such as dried pineapple, mango? prune, and raisin flavors. Yeasty, slightly spicy as well. Vinous, sherry qualities in small amounts. Reminds me of sweet raisin bread-cinnamon, brown sugar, bready. Alcohol detected just shy of the finish. Wheat, slightly spicy, dry finish. My biggest issue with this brew is that as it warms the esters become more and more prominate-over powering at times. Split w/ a buddy if you are going to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer offers interesting contrasting complexities that you wouldn't normally expect from a quadrupel as the spicy triticale balances off the sweetness of the candi sugar and allows the dark fruits and yeast to shine through."

"O: Not Stone's best effort, but certainly not the worst quad I've ever had. It seemed not to have been pushed far enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not idea if the triticale is adding anything, since I have no idea what it tastes like. This isn't a traditional quad, but it's pretty good."
"Overall a nice brew, but not something to write home about."
""
"This beer pours fairly dark, not dark like a stout but a darker shade of caramel or a almost maple syrup like color, head disappeared quickly and was a almost yellow off white. Flavor was dominated by sweetness after reading the label I was expecting and hoping for more spicy notes in the beer but I could not pick up any. I am not as familiar with this style but the beer seemed to be extremely sweet and I was hoping for more of a Stone twist on things. I'll have to try this Triticale grain sometime on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*I've had triticale beers before, so I'm kinda thinking it's not from this grain and is more likely flavors thrown off from the yeast"

"Poured a semi-clear reddish brown with abundant ruby red highlights when held to light. No head to speak of and no lacing. An interesting look for a Belgian Strong Dark, not the best through. Scents of syrupy dark fruit, including prune, raisin and dried cherries, cherry and apricot juice notes are also present alongside smokey malt, rich, dark bread, a bit of an earthy rye spice, and a noticeable alcohol presence in the background. A very rich, boozy and malty aroma with a high amount of dark fruit. Spiciness and smokiness are the elements that arw not true to style, though the intensity of the aromas, particularly those reminiscent of cherries are greater than in the Trappists Rochefort 10 and Chimay Blue and in the abbey-style St. Bernardus Abt. 12. This creates a bigger, bolder aroma than is typical for the style, befitting Stone. Flavor begins semi-sweet with flavors of liquor-soaked dark fruit, including prune, raisin and fig alongside rich, burnt caramel-like malt, a bit of a smokiness, slight hints of burnt toast and boozy undertones. This moves into a semi-sweet flavor reminiscent of dried apricots and cherries with ample alcohol flavors and some sweet, dark bread, smoky and caramel malt flavors. Finish is semi-dry with notes of spicy rye, burnt toast, alcohol, smoked malt and dark fruit. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of burnt toast, alcohol, toasted malt and spicy rye. A very rich, complex flavor profile. In many respects it is rather true to style, though the burnt toast and rye spice are both unique twists. It is also rather boozy, even for a Belgian Strong Dark. Still quite good and very unique. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and sticky with moderate-high carbonation that is present, but not prickly and a present, though not overwhelming alcohol warmth. A very good sipping beer mouthfeel that is quite easy to drink. Overall this is a good attempt at doing something different with a quadrupel style Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The aroma and flavor are fairly true to tradition in many respects, but they add small things that change the overall character and make the beer quite unique without ruining the overall balance. The mouthfeel supports this and lends the beer quite nicely to sipping. A good twist on a classic style, well worth trying."

"Overall: a tasty quad, but not the big delicious treat I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, what I really like in quads is the big fruity esters and phenols, while this had some it wasn't a ton. The sweet candy malts were a little one dimensional like, but the grainy wheaty whole grain bread biscuit thing was really interesting and unique. After a few sips this really just becomes the same thing over and over and gets a bit tiring on the palate, too bad I have a whole 22oz beer to get through, at 9.3% it'll be along end of the night."
""
""
"A decent attempt at the style, but the ""Stone"" edge at the finish does not work too well for the style."
"I hazard to call this a quad. It's simply a poorly done beer. The triticale I understand is a hard grain to use and that shows. There's no design or expertise on display here. I don't think Stone knows how to make a quad or use triticale. The best I can say is good try on the effort. This is an undrinkable drain pour."

""
""
""
""
"I have gone back to this one SEVERAL times. It has yet to disappoint. I really wish that Stone made this as a permanent offering. It would easily be in my go-to selection based on the value (price to taste). It's not exactly a quadro but it IS a damn good beer. If it has any drawback its that you have to wait a bit for it to warm up to truly enjoy the beer."

"O: a nice take on the quad, featuring pilsener malt and flaked triticale (grain), dark candi sugar, and Ardennes yeast. Depending on your tastes, this may be hit-or-miss - I happened to like it despite not being the sort to go to a quad very often."
""
""
""
""
""
"Like every Stone special release so far, I like this enough to recommend giving it a try."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty but a fair departure from your typical quad. I was looking for more spice and more fruit, but I think the grain overwhelmed them to some degree. This read more as an English barleywine than a Quad. I'm glad a tried it, but probably would pass in the future."
""
"Overall, a pretty nice beer. I thought it was a little too sweet for me."

"This is much lighter in mouthfeel than most classic Belgian quads. For the most part the taste stays true to the style with a bitterness on the finish."

"Overall: A pretty good spin on a Belgian Quad. Good fruit esters with an interesting twist from the tritcale grain."

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-tinged, caramel coloring, with a thin, filmy, light, off-white head. Nose of old-world fruits (date, fig, and raisin), with a subtle spice blend of clove and nutmeg. Chocolate notes, too. Flavors are heavy fruit forward, with date and fig, and an herbal overtone, dark and grassy, along with solid spice profiles, and a hint of yeasty funk. Booze notes throughout, too. Solid brew. Full bodied, with a slight carbonation edge. Very balanced, with a building warmth into the richly sweet and spiced aftertaste. Smooth, slow, clean finish. Tasty beer."

"O - A summer relaxer/sipper on the heavy side. Interesting take. It has enough things going on to keep the palate interested."

"O: I'm not seeing anyone else describe an off-finish so maybe this is an off bottle but even if so I'm not planning on trying another to see"
"Glass- Stout glass (bulb snifter)"
"A rich and slightly odd beer, falls short of what you'd expect from a quad in body and presentation. Taste and aroma are on point but a bit overwhelming. It hides its alcohol well. Worth a try, especially for Stone aficionados, but not worth going out of your way for."

"This was better than I expected. Big sweetness, sugar, caramel was a huge tone in this quad. I felt this beer could age well. It was missing that extra note, or even more hops. I do get big rye and spice when the beer is colder. As the beer warms the sweetness grows with the big caramel sweetness . Banana flavor as well."

"Overall, a nice deviation from the traditional quad. It's all over the place... and I like that. Three Philosophers this is not... and I like that one, too."

"Poured a reddish brown with virtually no head or lace and had an aroma that is typical of Belgian style beers; some sweet malts, yeast, dark fruits, touch of orange-like citric notes. Sticky, thick, slow sipping, there is a touch of booze in this beer. The yeast keeps it smooth and there is a mild sugary sweetness, pretty much caramel and maybe candi sugar, with some dark fruit flavors like fig and maybe raisin, and a touch of citric notes with orange and floral, clove spiciness. The triticale has no flavor presence in this beer, at least to me, although from other reviews this could be the floral spiciness I am getting. This beer isn't bad but it just seems to be a little messy and all over the place."
""
""
"Overall: Interesting, but ultimately unsuccessful, in my view; I just don't care for the herbal bite of the triticale just doesn't work with the other elements of a quad"
"O - Taste blows away the smell. Gets better as it warms up. Damn good beer!"
""
"taste: on this one its just WOW!! A great Belgium taste of sweet malts and that fruity taste most Belgium beers have. The spiciness is what does it for me because most Belgium beers that have spice they over do it for me. Not on this brew its a great blend and works very well on this greatness."
""
"O: A decent twist on a traditional quad with plenty of the dark fruitiness and Belgian yeast character with the twang of the triticale. Pretty drinkable for being over 9% as well"

"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. Pours a dark chestnut amber with a fine, half-finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of mild caramel malt, apple family fruit, Belgian yeast, mild dark stone fruit; sweet. Flavor starts with dark dried fruit, coriander, rye sourness, brown sugar. Transitions to a slightly overspiced odd grain flavor, probably the triticale that kind of reminded me of the lightly vegetal flavor in gluten free beers, finishes with an interesting but somewhat unbalanced spiciness from the rye and Belgian spices. Medium, nearly syrupy body with light carbonation. An interesting experiment and a passable quad style ale, but not comparable to the traditional flavors. Works as an odd, spicy, dark fruit Belgian style ale. This grew on me as I drank it and started appreciating the flavors for the non-traditional element they represented. I wouldn't get this again if in the mood for a quad, but definitely wouldn't mind tasting it again. Pleasant way to find out what triticale would taste like in a beer. They need a bit of quality control on the process, I got a small tuft of tribble fur in my glass."

"Perhaps not an outright bad stab at the style but for my tastes Stone should stick to hops (and their annual imperial stout). This just can't compete with most other quads I've tried."
""
""
""
"O: Not as deep or rich as I was expecting, but the flavors were delicious none the less. It didn’t really strike me as quad either, but it does have some flavors to style. Whatever it is, it was pretty solid and worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not what I was expecting from a quad. Wanted more dark fruits, got something tart and tangy."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grain, brown sugar, and pineapple juice aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, grain, and pineapple juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting pineapple aspect I am picking up in the smell and taste."
"Missed the Varna, but not nearly as good as the Grapefruit Slam. It's unique, sure. Or, one might call it a weird quad."

"Clear reddish brown with a beige/tan cap, kind of fizzy. Malty nose, crackery and toasted, toffee and rich grain character, slightly spicy with a hint of citrus (lemon). Dried fruit and mild alcohol were apparent as it warmed up. The flavour was kind of one note -- mostly a sweet, toffee and nutty character. A bit of spice, citrus, and alcohol were present too, along with mild bitterness, but definitely in the background (at least until the finish). Decent texture, medium/full body with moderate/low carbonation. I enjoyed it and thought it was a decent beer."

"Good overall beer poured this into a pint glass. Taste of candy and belgian style beer. Not too much to say about this beer. Very unique and should be tried at least once. Nothing special but Stone does deliver on great beers so cheers to stone brewing"
"Pours a deep mahogany ruby hue with a big head fine bubbles looks to be a khaki tan head at that. Fine speckled lacing left behind as it dwindles, smoking a big cigar from Nicaragua towards the end of this beer that I will give pairing notes to as the beer review goes. Aroma deep vine ripened dark colored grapes, raisin sweetness, very much the type of beer I like with my cigars...sweet complex and earthy. With a dark wheat base it looks like from the triticale nomenclature. The flavor is perfect vine ripened fruit, dark plums, raisins, exponential malt on the spectrum of fruit profiles, limited acidity enough to balance it out big Belgian yeast notes bready slightly spiced a perfect combination this is really good and will only get better with age. Mouthfeel is full bodied even full fermented carbonation levels, with full on fruit notes bringing out each burst of flavor with alcoholic presence available with each sip. Overall, I'm in love with the whole bottle this beer is going to age explicitly right now it's drinking just fine can't wait to try more of this one!!!"

"Overall, it falls into the ""wouldn't turn it down"" category. Nice to try it, but don't think I'll be buying another."

"Overall I have no idea what effect triticale had on the end product but I would assume it was minor vs. rye/wheat etc. That said, I can't really complain. Sure, it's not a classic Quad, but it's good. That said, I'm booking a flight to Brussels as we speak...."

"One of the weakest examples of the classic Belgian style that I have tried, from anywhere. Stone is good at making simpler beers but not complex ones."

"Out of bounds all the way, color is not a double or triple Belgium type, more of a rye style that you would expect, it is a project. The taste and smell does not betray the faithful at all. If you close you eyes and drink, you would see the truth, it is classic but only a nice different, it is a triple friend plus, well covered with a rust that never sleeps, it delivers on Taste. Thank you for thinking outside the Belgium box Stone. Of course Belgium beer were born outside the box of Germany and France. I call it a Slavic Triple Belgium beer. Whatever, it works."

"o: wasn't sure what to go in expecting here. its a pretty solid quad, loaded with all the flavors that make this style great. whats so nice about this is how smooth it drinks, and the balance of sweet & alcohol. a nice end of night sipper."

"Medium body with decent carbonation, a slight syrupy texture and a pleasant spicy rye character that adds life to a somewhat bland/artificial tasting beer. Strong candy sugar sweetness with cloying syrup and faint dark fruit flavor. Some bitterness up front followed by peppery spice, rye and cinnamon. This is followed by some caramel and toffee along with Belgian candi sugar, cough syrup, fig, plum and raisin. The high ABV is very well masked making this beer surprisingly drinkable. Overall, I'm not sure what to think about triticale. The spicy rye character adds interesting complexity but there is hardly any wheat characteristics in this beer and the artificial flavor stand out, taking away from the overall flavor."

"Pear and green apple upfront in aroma, with notes of confectioners sugar adding contrast. Belgian yeast esters dominate. Flavor is more muted and adds dates and figs in the background. Fairly sweet, but the finish is almost resiny and bitter. Wish the malt were more prevalent."

"a really poor beer from stone, and i know they arent the kings of the belgians or anything, and i know triticale is a tough grain, uncommon in brewing, and an adventure to begin with, but i feel like they could have done a lot more to showcase it, this base beer is weak street. listed only flaked triticale and pilsener malt on the label, the watery brown color must surely come from the addition of the dark sugar. its got a decent tan head on it, and some rising bubbles, but the nose is odd. tons of leftover sugar, but still harshly bitter, i imagine thats the triticale coming through pungently. generic belgian ale yeast does nothing for it. the flavor is just appalling, i mean, really bad, and it takes a lot for me to say that about a beer. its course and bitter, but the candy sugar doesnt belong here, its sweet, not fully fermented out, and instead of balancing the intensity of the cool new grain, it simply distracts form it with a fake maple syrup corn sugar kind of thing. its gross really. nothing about this is belgian quad at all, and the yeast is not strong enough to clean up the sugar. the body is extremely watery too, even with good carbonation its just way too light for both the flavors and the style. harsh and long lasting bitter finish from the grain, no hops here at all, really unpleasant. i am not sold on triticale as a brewing grain, but this beer from stone was a poor attempt in my opinion. it was weighed down by all that added sugar and alcohol, and really misses the mark. i suspect a pale saison may work better with this grain, even an english type pale ale would be worth trying, but this is confounded in so many ways. definitely a drain pour."

"OVerall - A really nice , easy to enjoy, big beer. Wasn't overboard sweet, too hot, or unbalanced with all the spices and yeasts. The grain really smoothed it out and gave it a unique flavor against the yeasts and spices. Another winner from stone."
""
"As the tritical grains assert its rye-like spiciness, the dark burgundy and bronze beer is largely overcome by the beer's melanoidin-rich malt dominance and shift the balance away from its fruit and spice dialogue and onto that of malt sweetness."
""
"Notes: A very nice and interesting beer. However, nothing stands out to me...I was not blown away."
""
""
"Overall: okay, I know barrels are overdone, but I think Stone have proved themselves to be good at it, so I'd love to see this in a rye whiskey or red wine barrel. As it is, I think the sweetness is just a bit overwhelming, but has a ton of promise."
