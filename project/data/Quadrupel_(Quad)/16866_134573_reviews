"      This is a top tier Quad. Period. It drinks like something this strong has no right to. It's delicious. It's complex and satisfying. It shows that the brewer knows how to d the fundamentals. This is the Green Bay Packer Sweep. It just works and it's delicious. Get several."

"Overall not a bad beer but with my buddy and I coming off a Belgian beer fest the other night enjoying the likes of Westvletern Yellow Cap and St. ""Weekend at Bernie's"" ABT 12 this definitely is not in the same league.  But it was enjoyable nonetheless."
"While not a world class quad, this is one of the better US made ones. There is plenty of flavor, and it is true to the style. Only thing keeping it from being top rated is it could use a bit more complexity, but that is a minor point. Well worth trying if you want to see how well a US brewery can make a quad."

"Solid quad, but nothing special. Lots of dark fruit in the nose.  Would have been better if less sweet."

"Right up there with the best Belgians in the world, albeit a bit on the sweet side.  The Bruery always produces extremely expensive brews, but this one is really worth it."

"Had this on Tap at 4th Ave Beer Bar & Garden in Brooklyn, NY.  Poured into a goblet, black as night with a small head. Herbaceous, sweet aroma. The first taste allows you to consider the complexity of flavors on your tongue - some fruit, some yeast, some spice, some malt, all rolling around on a smooth parade of tastiness, with nary a hint of the strong abv (11%).  Excelsior!"

"O: Possibly bolstered by my lukewarm initial enthusiasm, this beer knocked my socks halfway off. Nothing off about it, plenty of warm semi-sweet malt, with some interval-ed spice flavors. Solid brew, hats off."
""
"This beer has some nice smooth alcohol character and the malt sweetness is there aswell.  It just doesn't have the yeast characters I would like to taste in a big quad.  I can't see age doing much for this beer, if the alcohol mellows it will be just to much sweetness with nothing to balance it."

"A great beer to sit and enjoy on a cold night. Great overall flavor with a smooth finish.  Easy to drink too much!"
""
"Yet another example that US breweries can't touch the quality of quad from a good Belgian brewery."
"Overly sweet with little dark, dried fruit character. Uninteresting yeast."

"O: This is really good stuff. Not exactly up there with the best (true) Belgian quads, but it is quite good. Supposed to be a sipper (I just started a fire on this cold winter's night), but I may have trouble drinking this one slowly."
""
""
"Smoother flavor than I was expecting from a quad, creamy finish,  easy to drink, especially since it has such a high ABV"

"Fantastic representation of the style"

"750 mL bottle from Wed., 12/31/2014 (Niciu 3rd Annual NYE Party) purchased at Cleveland Park Wine & Liquors, unknown brewing/packaging dates (2014 vintage), poured into plastic cup, drank over ~30 minutes"
"O: An enjoyable beer.  Happy New Year everyone!"
""

""
""
""
"Pretty damn near perfect Quad."
""
""
""
"D: This was a solid quad with great complex scent and taste. It had a great body too, although it was pretty hot, so it must be sipped. Clearly built to age, but still enjoyable fresh. High quality brew."

"it got better the warmer it got."

"O: Overall this beer has no real presence of hops or bitterness but yet it is not cloyingly sweet either. It is pretty easy to drink considering the strength, the alcohol is well hidden but it is definitely a sipping beer. Nice complexity in the flavors of the fruits, candi sugar, malts, and Belgian yeast."
"A nicely balanced and gently complex beer. Spicy, fruity flavors roll about with a twinge of boozy heat and leave a mildly charred sugar sweetness and very subdued bitter aftertaste lingering on the palate."
"Serving type: bottle"

""

"Fuller bodied, a little thick, the yeast keeps it smooth, the balance between sugary sweetness and dark fruits like figs and possible raisins is there and the hops add just enough to give it a crisp finish.  Booze pretty well hidden and this is a great sipper you can have anytime, not just holidays."
""
""
"This is a very sweet, but very nice American take on a quad - far more balanced and approachable than most other attempts. The yeast clearly plays an enormous role in the flavor profile here."
""
""
""
""
"Had this draft and while drinkable, was overly pedestrian."
""
"there is little doubt in my mind that this is one of, if not the single best straight up quad i have ever had made in america. the other beers in this series were starting to get out there a bit, pineapple juice, gooseberriers, and so on, so its nice to get grounded a little here. dark rum colored brew, with red and brown in the light, and a tall frothy head indicative of the style. it smells like tons of dried fruit, raisins and cherries and dates, i get the candy sugar too, molasses, and booze, and the belgian yeast is fruity but not over the top in its ester intensity. the flavor is just like the nose, with all the fruits coming through, its a touch tannic like a diluted red wine, but its flattering to the overall. the booze does show up in the finish, especially as it warms, but i still wouldnt have placed it over 10% abv. there is a nice richness and creaminess of feel that makes it a great holiday beer, but im not sure i would age this one, i cant imagine any part of the experience improving over time. world class quad, interesting and hearty, memorable for me."

"Best quad I've ever had I think. Following it up with westy 12 and rochefort 10"
""

""

"A bit hot but really nice plum, raisin, and caramelflavors. Needs about two years probably."
""
""
""
"O:  Not a bad quad, just not a stellar quad.  Just OK."
""
""
"Not getting a whole lot of good out of this. Very little smell or flavor forme on this one. I had some bigger hopes for it"
"Poured into a The Bruery tulip. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission and a half finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma rich in dark dried and fresh fruit; dates, figs, raisins and plums with sweet candi malt, mildly earthy. Flavor follows, dominated by dates, fresh and dried figs, plums and raisins. Lightly bready, sweet malt. Flavor progresses from dried fruit to brighter fresh fruit notes before leaving a lingering brown sugar and dark fruit aftertaste with a hint of tartness. Medium bodied. A very nicely made, flavorful Belgian, although I found the profile to be closer to a Belgian dark strong ale than a classic quadrupel, although the clove and Belgian spices are faint or absent.  No matter, there is a lot to taste here. Rich and satisfying. ABV is covered well. This may be one of my favorites from the series. A great choice for Christmas."

"O - The Bruery's 7 Swans-A-Swimming is a beautiful addition to their 12 Days of Christmas series and is one of the most well-done American-brewed Belgian Quads, right on for ""style"" - something they rarely seem to shoot for. Malty, complex, and loaded with classic Belgian yeast characteristics, this big beer will surely hang on for the remainder of the series, developing over time!"
"Will check it out again after it sits for a couple of years."

"Wonderful layers and complexity, solid Quad."
""
"This is a slightly unorthodox Quad but it's tasty and enjoyable."
""
""
"Carbonation was light, and the alcohol comes through slightly, but nicely."
""
""
""
"Better than 6 geese A layin"
""
""
""
"7 Swans is another fantastic beer from The Bruery. Solid Quad."
""
"Hell yeah Lions!Pours into a chalice a clear amber tinged dark brown with a thinner tannish colored head atop.Dark fruit and toffee in the nose,a little sweet alcohol lingers.Pretty sweet on the palate but not quite cloying,alcohol and dark fruit with some""cakiness"".some toffee is there as well.A good holiday sipper."

"Aroma of brown sugar, molasses and a bit of sweet chocolate/cherry.  Bit of cocoa powder after a bit of agitation tends to see the light through the sweet notes.   Taste is slick and oily initially and when cold but gathers some traction with warming and exposure, yeilding more Belgian yeast character and some more subtle complexities.  Feel is expected given the nose and taste, that being a bit sweet and viscous with moderate complexity.  Overall a bit one sided and somewhat limited in nature though will likely improve with a couple years of quiet time.  Personally prefer Quads a bit drier but this doesn't disappoint either."

"Overall- was super impressed by this beer. and for the price i was really blown away."
"A solid raisin and banana forward quad."
""
" The taste has a lovely malt and yeast cohesion with mild dark sugar flavor and slight raisin with a dried fruit character from the yeast that also has a fig-like tropical aspect with almost floral taste and light nutty malt quality with slight woody and mildly herbal accent with some alcohol warmth in the back with hints of molasses. This is an excellent strong dark belgian ale-very smooth for the strength with excellent malt flavor and such sweetness without becoming cloying I love a strong ale like this with such rich taste and complexity."

"Very nice layers with this beer. You get a great sweetness, along with a nice nutty, fruit cake taste.  Roasted pecans for sure, but very faint apricot."

""
""
"Overall: Decent, not amazing. Don't think I'm buying this again.  For a Bruery product, I'm very underwhelmed."
""
""

"t/m/o - quite good.  dark fruit...plums and grapes marinated in a big boozy sweetness.  far sweeter than the nose suggested, but still very drinkable due to a really nice nutty almost brown ale vibe.  definitely a bit hot, but probably the best one in the series aside from 2TD.  taking down this whole bottle shouldn't be a problem.  a bit fizzy in the feel and definitely lacking the creaminess i usually look for in the classic quad, but all in all a worthwhile beer to check out."
""
""
"Solid on the initial pour, but little to no residual head or lacing.  Nose is fruity and sweet.  Tastes like it smells, malty with some strong and some subtle fruit components; most notably raisin.  Thick and syrupy.  Quads are not my favorite style, no Belgians in general; but overall, this is a really good quaff, especially for the style."

"Doesn't have the yeasty kick that I like it most quads.  Still has a decent flavor, but tastes a bit watery, for lack of a better term."

"Overall a very solid quad. Fruity notes on the nose and very smooth finish. This should age quite nicely."

"Poured from a 750mL bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
""
"Refreshing yet invigorating triple.  Don't let this one get the best of you.  It's subtle but strong.  Sweet start and finish will hide the fact that this is a 11% beer that will sneak up on you."

"Ridiculously delicious Belgian Quad brimming with flavors of raisins, figs, dates, and cocoa. I'll be buying a case of this for sure"
