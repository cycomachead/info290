"Oily slick, mouthfeel, full bodied and rich but never wee sticky. I'm drinking this way too fast for the alcohol, the beer is amazingly balanced. This is crafted as well as any Belgian quad."

"Poured a dark brown in color with burgundy highlights and a half finger of head that left some good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. Plenty of dark fruit is noticeable upfront in the nose with nice belgian yeast sweetness, slight candi sugar, booze is present and hints of brown sugar. The belgian yeast character was more apparent on the palate alongside dark fruit accents, welll balanced booze that was not overwhelming, subtlt brown and candi sugar but with mild spice. The brew was medium in body with good amount of carbonation which has a sweet, yeasty, dark fruity, slightly boozy and sticky finish. Finally got to tick this beer after some years of chasing. Yeeahh!!"
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, and spices. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."

"Another tick on the Russian River –tion Quest that I started quite awhile back! Big thanks goes out to estocker for sending me this one a LONG time back! Shared this one at aasher’s wedding reception with as many people in the wedding party as I could find! Served from growler into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a ruby red-brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, and banana. The flavor was of sweet mat, fruit, banana, bread, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. As far as quadruples go, this was a fairly solid one. All the proper flavors and aromas going on in all the right intensities. There was absolutely no sign of the alcohol in this one at all. This was definitely a scary aspect as I’m sure the right person could crush a 64 oz growler without a problem. I’m just glad I had help that all seemed to enjoy it as well. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance to do so."

"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of big sweetness and warming earthy flavors. Not overly boozy."

"O-A decent quad but is missing the complexity of my Belgian favorites like St. Bernardus and the alcohol is clearly present. Yet to find a good American version of this style."

"T: Dark fruits upfront with some bready malt, toasted rye and a touch of earthy hops on the finish. Maybe the best American quad I've had to date, but it has nothing on the complexities found in some of the better Belgian quads."
""
""
"O: A top notch quad. Up near my favorite quads (Westvleteren 12 & De Struise St. Amatus 12). They should start bottling this one."
""
""
"Insert something witty here. I got nothin."
""
"O: This Quad is really good, well balance, very drinkable and complex enough for you to want to keep coming back."
""
""
"O: Strange quad, strange beer, and not my favorite from the brewery. Not what I was expecting in a quad, but not a terrible beer in and of itself."

"Pours a dark brown with a hint of red, almost a purple color with a tiny white head. Scent is heavy with dark fruits. Biscuits and caramel malt are present as well. A little bit of candied sugar and prunes. Taste is initially sweet malt flavors, immediately followed by dark fruits and Belgian yeast flavors. A little bit of bread-like flavors with just a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy-smooth. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a fantastic Quad. I love it, and if not for the high ABV, I could have a few of these in one sitting."
"A very good quad, though not as good as I remember the first batch being. Still, it's very tasty."

"O: Good Quad, glad I got to try this one. Great way to start a tasting, but no more than one in a sitting, but for me that's not unusual for a Quad, as the candy sugar flavors are a bit much after 1 glass."
"O- well rr never let's me down and I had reservation about this one from jump street. A nice quad and one that is super drinkable even fresh. I'd like to see what a bottle of this would do with some time down."
"D- Another solid take on a style by the RR crew. I don't see why this is not rated higher, it's more drinkable than most authentic Belgians in the same vain. I don't want to sound like a RR fanboy, but they can do no wrong."
"A: A deep root beer color and opacity. Thin white head. S: Rich toffee, hops, coffee and sugar. T: Toffee, raisin, some sourness and hops. It's on the sweeter side. M: Full and round, smooth. O: Pretty awesome beer on tap at Russian River. High ABV makes it hard to drink more than one."
"Can't wait until next year to repeat the cycle but now I have my own RR growler to refill."
"Beer is medium in body and really sweet on lead off. The beer unfolds to reveal almost no interesting yeast character and an overly bitter finish. Not pleasant."
"d - A pretty nice quad from Russian River. Lots of dark fruits and bready malts, and it had a great mouthfeel. Would have again."
"Pour yields a mahogany-colored beer with a good off-white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down the sides of the glass. Not quite as much as I'd normally like to see from a quad, but given the fact that this is a quad from a growler, I'll give it a break there. The nose contains a good amount of dark fruits--mostly raisins and prunes--along with some caramel notes and some toasted bread. The flavor hits along the same lines, focusing on the dark fruits and mild bread character, and then finishes with a bit of dry bitterness. Pretty good, but not the sort of complexity I expect from a quad and, especially, from Russian River. Feel is medium with lower levels of carbonation and a dry finish, which I quite enjoyed. Definitely drinkable for the style--it blew me away when I found out this was 10.5%, though I suppose I should have suspected something in that range."
"d: I want to drink this beer a lot, but one and I'm done!"
"Underwhelming. A mediocre beer from what is possibly the best brewery in the country. Not nearly in the same league with the great Belgian quads like Rochefort, Chimay, Westvleteren, St. Bernardus Abt 12, etc."
"A great solid mouthfeel that makes this drinkable at 10.5%. It has no noticeable alcohol notes in it other than a strong buzz in my head after drinking three glasses. It could do with a lighter carbonation, but criticisms about the sweetness are invalid in my mind. I thought this was a solid beer and would order anywhere available."
"On a positive note, nice mellow Belgian yeast flavor with no musty aftertaste."
"Medium body with low carbonation levels makes the beer a bit slick on the tongue, finishing sweet and boozy on the tongue. Definitely a sipper, though the one dimension flavor profile is a bit disappointing."
"A solid beer, but not one of the better efforts I've had from RR. That probably speaks more to my expectations when it comes to trying new RR beers, rather than any actual flaws in Mortification."
"Pours a very dark, yet clear, ruby-red color. Has a big light tan head with good retention. Aroma is light, but has hints of malt and some smokeyness. Nice malty flavor with hints of cherries (not sour), chocolate, and smoke. Smooth and medium-bodied. Strong ABV, but no real taste of alcohol."
"jd"
"Overall: Good quad. "
"D: This was quite different. I enjoyed it, but it's not exactly what I was anticipating. Still worth trying out, of course, and the complexity of it kept me interested."
"Another great beer from Russian River. Pours like an Amontillado in color, with a huge creamy head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some nice lacing. Impressive for a growler. Smells soft, vinous, of red fruit, and brambly; followed by the slightest hint of sour cherry. Tastes as fantastic as usual. Vinous, complex, tannic, brambly, smooth, and very well hidden alcohol. Delicious!"
"Mortification is a quadrupel and 11% abv. It poured a nice dark chocolate with some red highlights. It smelled of sour malt, toffee, cherry, dried plums and vanilla. It tasted like roasted malt, plums, cherries with a hint of sour funk. Pretty tasty."
"Draught at the brewery. Dark amber-brown with an off-white head. Rich caramel and nutty aromas. Malty flavor with caramel, nuts, an some spices that remind me of nutmeg. Starts with sweet maltiness, but actually ends dry and pretty bitter, though the hop aren't as apparent as many of their lighter ales. Medium-full body is nice and trim considering that this is eleven percent. Malty, yet with good balance and interesting flavors."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown, thick off white head forms, settles to a thin ring, lots of chunky lace sticks to the glass, looks nice. Smell is neat, a touch funky, sour fruit, cherries, wine, caramel, spice, very malty, wood, raisin, alcohol, pretty neat mix of quad fruitiness and some RR funk. Taste is similar, light chocolate and dark fruit, raisin, lightly sour, cherries, big alcohol, sherry, wood, more fruit, some candi sweetness, a touch astringent in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some heat going down. Carbonation is a bit low for the style, and alcohol is in your face, but pretty cool stuff."
"D - Glad to get another ""tion"" brew from Russian River under my belt, and a rare one to boot! While I don't have a whole lot of Quad experience, I found this one to be pretty damn good."
"Good, but a bit of a disappointment. Russian River makes a quad seems like some kind of dream beer description to me. Unfortunately, I found this beer good but disappointing as a quad and as a Russian River beer. It's still quite good, of course. Mortification pours a deep garnet with little head and a bit lacing. The aroma is fairly mild with some bananas, some plums, some spice and a whiff of sour cherries. The sour comes through a touch in the flavor, but it's almost as though the brewery saw a bit of cross-pollination from the sour barrels rather than they were really going for a lightly sour quad. It's fairly dry, especially for a quad. It actually reminds me of a dry barleywine mixed with a tripel, for some reason. The flavors don't punch as much as I would like, but then again, the dryness is a nice contrast to more normal pitfall of a cloyingly sweet quad. Another nice upside to the beer is that it hides the abv almost entirely. I'm pretty shocked to see it listed here as 11% abv. This was my second time tasting this beer and I'm still confused by it."
"A deceptively drinkable 11% beer. I was surprised by how much pineapple flavor was in this one. The citrus gives it a uniqueness to most quads that are dominated by raisins and other dark stone fruits."
"d: fairly easy to drink, didn't knock my socks off right away but i quickly grew into it comfortably; would buy if they bottled it"
"Outstanding drinkability. Pretty dang easy to quaff really. No alcohol heat is present at all, sort of just like liquid candy... At 11% that's no small feat. Nice all around Quad but a little odd..."
"I was really hoping this would make it there and I am glad it did, it was actually the only Russian River brew on draft, got quite lucky with this one, would not quite call this quad, it reminded me more of a barleywine especially with its hop profile, I would like to have this again, recommended"
"Overall, i tried it because it was there, good but not something i will quest after but that is just my personal preferance."
"Drinkability is pretty dangerous, wow is this one smooth quad. While you can taste the booze, it's not relaly hot or anything, and overall, really dangerous!!"
"Overall this isn't as complex as some of the world-class quads, but the flavors all work very well together. Certainly worth a shot."
"This is one of the more drinkable quads I've tasted as it's on the lighter side of things and with a noticeably vinous quality to things. Another terrific brew from Russian River."
"3/20 @ Russian River. Pours cloudy caramel with a small than head that quickly fades into lacing. Aroma of dark fruits, candied sugar, cocoa,and caramel. Taste is similar with a slight vineous quality. Vineous and caramel finish with some alcohol. Medium carbonation with a medium thick mothfeel."
"D: For not being a style I like alot, I liked this beer!"
"D - This was excellent. Rarely disappointed from RRs offerings."
"On Tap Toronado SD, Lots of carbination with a swirl, all the way till the end. Great aroma, woody, some sweet raisiny-ness and with a nice finish, minerals and acidity keep it from being too sweet. Winter warmer great for a cold night, nice quad / barley wine and easy to drink for the style."
"Had on draft at Tornado SD. Great coming off the tap, but it's heavy and should be enjoyed without the Mac N' Cheese plate served there. Reminded me a lot of traditional winter beers with a dark color, fruity smell and flavoring, and heavy feel to it. Definitely worth a second go the next time I'm there."
"D - Very much so, but what from Russian River isn't?"
"D: I'd like to have this again. I could definitely have a couple of pints."
"T&M: Huge maltiness but not overly sweet; Russian River brews their Belgians on the dry side, something that I really appreciate. Figgy fruit, notes of date, graham cracker and just a touch of licorice. Medium body. Finishes semi-dry, almost crisp. Deceptively drinkable, there's absolutely no trace of the high ABV."
