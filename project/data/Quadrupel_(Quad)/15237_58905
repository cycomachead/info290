The aroma is of flavorful dark bread backed by rich dark fruits with a touch of caramel and toffee as well. The taste has a lot of the same notes as the smell. Upfront I am noticing that this beer is pretty sweet so the toffee and caramel are very noticeable. The bread and biscuit come next and they are quickly followed by a bit of pepper that I guess is from the hops and alcohol that does tend to creep up as the beer warms. Greatly filling but not too heavy low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel that finishes relatively clean if not just a tiny bit dry with a touch of sweetness that suggests the fruit. Very pleased to have had the opportunity to try this one, I think I've had better quads but this one is authentic and very nice.","fank2788","May 22, 2014"

Vintage 2012 acquired at the brewery a week ago, served at cellar temp. Poured not as dark as expected, a lighter roast coffee, cloudy looking, but no sediment. Pouring vertically and directly into a tulip glass produced just a finger of milk-chocolate-colored head that settled quickly into an ivory ring. Coffee smells, woody esters, licorice, cherry, vanilla, interesting things in the nose but not in great volumes. Malt forwa--whoosh, peppery anise and some other aromatic spice rushes in grabs hold of things. There's some vegetal hop bitters, drying things out a bit further. Back in search of the malt, I find caramel, vanilla, some red fruit, enough there for complexity, but it is rinsed quickly. On the palate, it's a sticky, with a bit of alcohol warmth, but surprisingly little body.","ManforallSaisons","Beers"

3.97,-5.5,4.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"Poured into a snifter, this brew looks like a quad, ruddy chocolate brown with a weak tan head, lots of yeast in the bottle. Colder, the aromas of candied raisins and ripe grapes come on strong with some hints of roasted malt too. Yeasty with hints of alcohol. When drinking I'll start with what I think knocks this one a notch below St. Benardus and Westy's quad. It lacks the complex esters and phenols present which help mask the hefty alcohol content. Now I still think this is a solid quad and if an American brewer made one this good, I'd be all over it. The malt bill is solid and the body is nice and heavy yet finishes dry and quickly although its a bit hot. The dark fruits are prominent and delicious. Maybe even too much as some anise comes through which I'd rather not have in a quad.","deebo","Apr 11, 2013"

Enjoyed this one during rivalry Saturday while watching my Yellow Jackets play the Dawgs! Due to the slaughter taking place, I upped the ABV for this one! Served from bottle into an Orval goblet. Poured brown with a one finger very light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, toasted malt, bread, dark fruit, sweet alcohol, fruit, and very subtle sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, fruit, sweet alcohol, caramel, sugar, and subtle earth. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. All of the components of a really solid Quad were present in this one which was quite nice. A nice balance of sweetness and booziness made this one surprisingly easy to drink despite the higher ABV. The aroma was very inviting and rather pleasant as well. Definitely a must try for any Quad fan out there who has not done so already.","thagr81us","Nov 13, 2012"

The mouthfeel is slick and just a tad chewy. It makes you pay attention whether you want to or not. Like I like my women :) This is a fantastic beer. It has a lot going on and is delicious without being so challenging that you can't introduce it to newbies. This is a keeper, for sure.

Nothing in terms of head, cap, lace, nothing. Smell is about the dark fruits and less about the spices. Nice aroma of plum and the like and maybe a bit of licorice. No alcohol in the nose. Bready as well with yeast apparent. This is a nice change of pace from the Pannepot, more fruity and bready and not as much spices used IMO. Some clove makes an apperance with warming, the flavors work well together. The feel off the tap almost killed it though. This was basically dead and it needs a boost badly. Glad to have tried this though, a good beer that stands on it's own too feet. I wonder if this is the same base beer as Pannepot, with less spice.","BARFLYB","Dec 05, 2011"

It pours a dark sienna-garnet topped by a half-finger of dirty tan foam (I blame the pour for the small head, though, frankly). The nos comprises fig, light raisin, light roasted malts, very light cocoa, brown sugar, and caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some dark red grapes (very close to the flavor of some rich red wines), light tobacco, light walnut, and light mandarin orange syrup. The caramel comes in a bit more toasted, and the roast is slightly more pronounced. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation nd a smooth, sorta grainy feel.

Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon with a little bit of rum and coke and a slight metallic tinge that all gets more intense as it warms. The taste is far from subdued. Complex, with lots of dark fruits, brown sugar, vanilla, dark chocolate, oak, with hints of black cherries and a solid sweet, malty backbone. Very smooth, almost creamy with a nice, subtle alcohol warming. It's a sipper, but a very drinkable sipper.

I've had my share of quads, and this is the most drinkable interpretation of the style by far. The alcohol lends itself to the flavor profile and doesn't make a boozy appearance at all. Though the flavor profile was wonderful, it wasn't quite as bold as the nose had indicated, which put it down a notch from a perfect score. That said, I can certainly see why many have dubbed this better than the Westvleteren 12. I'm still on the fence personally, and will need a side-by-side pretty soon.

4.32,2.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer tastes quite sweet as it hits the palate, but much of this comes from the base fruitiness and the sweet accentuating spiciness that is found in this beer. The finish is dry with a spicy note as well as a touch of astringency. The fruit flavors found here remind me of bright plums, tart-sweet raisins and even some fig notes add to the complexity. Flavors of rum, or perhaps more properly characterized as brandy flavors are brought out by the sweetness, the fruit character and the alcohol. This is really quite nicely balanced between the fruit character, the alcohol, the earthy spiciness and the candi sugar flavors. This has the proper character needed of being light and quaffable for its strength; it is still most definitely a sipping beer, but it is not overly heavy or cloying. The sipping also allows one to fully experience the complexity and myriad of balanced flavors.","Gueuzedude","Oct 08, 2010"

4.47,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," D : Good carbonation, smooth and a bit creamy. Some hints of oak wood in the end. Very complex and nice balance of great flavors. The is really nice, so enjoyable to drink and packed with great flavors. Love it, well done struise","beerpirates","Sep 16, 2010"
3.95,-6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a dark brown with subtle mahogany hints. A slightly darkened white head with a decent amount of lacing. Large amount of dark fruit alongside some candied sugar and a bit of caramel. Initial sip brings a slightly-dry beer with some sweetness and dominated mostly by dark fruits. Body is medium. A good beer in its own right, but nowhere near the best of this style.","Thorpe429","Sep 16, 2010"
4.47,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I wonder how well this beer would age. Its sweet but not hot, finishes cleanly, a great great beer, truly. Its medium to light in body, the carbonation on the palate is low, mild stone fruits, mild bread, mild yeast. Very nice balance overall. The alcohol is well hidden behind a mask of great malt. I really enjoyed it.","drabmuh","Beers"
4.49,6.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer appears a dark brown shade (darker than the Pannepot) with a fleeting, light tan head. A minimal amount of lacing is left behind. The aroma is wonderful, and obviously of an authentic Belgian quad. I detect yeast, bread, subtle dark fruits, and slight alcohol. The taste is great, and surprisingly smooth, especially given that this beer is newly released, thus quite young. The finish contains a slight warming note with only a faint trace of alcohol. The 10.5% abv is hidden quite well. What a delicious beer. This is practically as smooth as the 2005 Pannepot. I am amazed that this beer drinks this well already. A true masterpiece. De Struise Brouwers proves yet again that it is one of the finest breweries around. Urbain is making some of the finest Belgian Belgian beer in the world.","Huhzubendah","0"
4.41,5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Flavor and mouthfeel is wonderful! Very drinkable for a ""heavy"" quad. Extremely smooth, high carbonation, boozy...and just delicious! Medium body. Toasted malts, lots of over-ripe fruits like raisins and figs...and I'm picking up banana?? Regardless, just a great tasting beer from De Struise! Glad I got to try it!","ShadesOfGray","Jul 30, 2010"
5,19,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a dark brown into a special Sint Amatus chalice with a little bit of foamy head. Could have dranken 3 or 4 of these easily before I would break my bank and happily stumble out of the bar. I wish I had taken notes on all the tastes but unfortunately didn't between passing the beer around with my family, whom all said it was awesome (even a non beer drinker). If I ever see in stores in the states I would happily pay whatever the cost was. All in all, an amazing beer and by far the best Quad I've had to date.","FSUGrad2k10","Jul 26, 2010"

4.17,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Quite a good beer from De Struise and I think this one would be great to enjoy on a cold evening. As it was, not exactly perfect on a 90 afternoon, but still tasty.","womencantsail","Jul 05, 2010"
4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks very much to jedwards for sharing this - I've been wanting to try this one for a while. Poured a hazy plum with an off-white skim of a head that dissipates into some bubbles around the edges. Nose reveals bubblegum, dark fruit and a little booze. Taste follows nose - not as sweet as suggested by the aromas, but the booze definitely carries over to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium in body, with a light carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Definitely a solid Quad - not overly sweet and well-balanced. Well worth your time if you get the chance to give it a try. Considering the 10.50% abv, the alcohol is pretty well hidden.","Jwale73","Jun 20, 2010"
4.6,9.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D - Another great offering from De Struise","eric5bellies","Jun 17, 2010"

4.43,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"First sip and wow, this is a tasty beer. Huge roasted malts, caramel flavors, bourbon, dried fruit. A brief sour note. The body is thick and velvety. Carbonation is light. A second sip shows more of the barrel aging, you can really taste it, some brown sugar, a molasses flavor is very present. Kind of a sweet beer but not sugary sweet. Flavor makes you lick your lips. More bourbon shows up in the finish. The aftertaste is molasses like and lingers. I imagine this to be a perfect desert beer after a big heavy meal. For 10.5 abv the alcohol is well hidden.","weissbierdrinker","Jun 04, 2010"
3.95,-6,3.5,3.5,4,5,4,"A nice tribute to trappist quads but the evident alcohol presence sets a gap between the genuine trappists and Struise's attempt of mimicking the monk's work. However, the beer is still young and the remaining bottles might significantly improve with aging.","crnipeter","Beers"
4.42,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This one drinks very nicely for the ABV. I wouldn't say that I am blown away by this, but it still is a very good quad that improves consistently with each degree that it warms. This is also very young and I hate to judge this style based on a fresh bottle, but that is all I have right now.","alcstradamus","0"
