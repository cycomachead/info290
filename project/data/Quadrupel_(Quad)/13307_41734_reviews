"Overall, a solid barrel-aged quad.  Nothing stands out from other examples.  Its just complex and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brown body with one finger head with one finger head and minimal lace.  A aroma that comes across as a little bit of dark fruit, more toffee and raisins than anything, and a hint of sugar and spice.  Smooth, medium body, yeast keeps it smooth while adding a little chewiness, the dark fruits come out as I get raisins, figs, toffee and there is even a little bit of booze in the finish.  Spicy edge gives it a little depth and adds balance and overall a pretty good brew."
""
"Overall: I like this beer, probably because I like musty, dusty quads.  I'd have it again, no problem."
""
""
"Dark brown, long lasting light brown head. Raspberries, wood, fruits, chocolate and wine. Sour at start, sweet all the way after, with bitter strong and acidic finish. Medium body and carbonation. Nicely balanced with a great barrels and fruits at mouth feel. Caramel yeast and wood prevail later. Could easily drink it instead dinner."
"A beer that promised, but compared to quadruple tradiocionals, is back. Lacks depth, complexity, flavors, beer is a little worked. A bit disappointing, while being a good beer."

"Overall: great ale with some well developed fruity notes, but not quite the depth of flavour to match the best of the style"

"o: good fruit-forward quad.  expensive, but worth trying"
""
""

"Final Grade: 4.17, an excellent A-. Monk's Brew is certainly not the best quad I've ever had, but it's still a pretty damn good one. I love the flavour profile of this one, but unfortunately it suffers from a few forgiveable flaws - namely, the relatively limp mouthfeel and (comparatively) straightforward bouquet. Like all Mikkeller beers this is not a cheap tipple, but going by the typical price point of an imported quad, it's certainly not unreasonably expensive for this market. Very good stuff, and definitely worth a try for any BSDA/Quad fans, but not world-class."

"Overall – Decent but with so many world class quads out there not much reason to have this one again.  It seems a little amateurish when you stack it up against bernardus/rochefort/chimay etc."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a satisfying dessert-like quad. Very assertive strength and yeasty spiciness, while it maintains a satisfying drinkability, I feel it lacks the finesse of some premier Belgian examples, this (at least young) has an assertive rich fruit character, with more cinnamon/nutmeg/pepper spice developing to carry through to a dry finish with sticky caramel throughout. Enjoyable, and I hope to see it develop some complexity and nuance."

"Overall, this is a good abbey style quad, much better than the usual American craft versions of the style. Definitely worth checking out."

"I wouldn't call this a conventional quad -- the roasted malty flavor and lighter, less-carbonated mouthfeel combined with the usual fruit and spice make this beer feel more like a blend of a quad and stout. It's highly drinkable and enjoyable, but I prefer a quad to be slightly less sweet and to have a fuller body. Worth trying, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up again as it's more expensive than some other truly great quads (namely St Bernardus ABT12)."
"O: In overall complex malty beer, not the ideal because of too perfumy alcohol aroma, and too little dried fruits. Worth trying."
"MF – Med-heavy body, semi-dry finish, alcohol lasts on the palate, warming. 3.75"

"O: This bad boy has been in my closet for about 2 years and I kept forgetting about it. Glad I finally pulled it out and enjoyed it. Slightly oxidized but overall a great beer. I really enjoyed the dark fruits, spices and rum mingled into the yeasty backdrop."
"Hmmmm - not terrible but certainly sub-par. It looks great, however the aroma and flavour have a lack of depth and development. The overall character is wishy-washy; sweet and fruity but not fully committed. Body is OK but not amazing. My impression is that it is under-attenuated, possibly due to not being fermented at a sufficiently high temperature. It falls short of the best that the style can offer. No need to hunt it down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is excessively sweet. Not even a caramelly sweetness or brown sugar. Just lots of unexciting sugar."

"Overall: A very solid example of a Belgian quad, delicious."
"This one stays with you for a while. Chewy mouthfeel but not overly syrupy. A lot is going on, and a lot is done very well."
"O- pretty good quad. A little heavier and darker than some of my normal faves. Seems a bit more like a BSDA. It was one I wanted to try but would be 10deep on my list of quads that I would seek out at the store."

"750 ml bottle into chalice; no bottle dating, but likely at least a few years old.. Pours hazy extremely dark brown, almost black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass; with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, molasses, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, toffee, roasted malt, dark bread, dark candi sugar, dark earthiness, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and spicy yeast esters. Taste of raisin, prune, date, cocoa, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, dark candi sugar, light clove, and dark earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, cocoa, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, dark candi sugar, light clove, and dark earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of robust dark malt flavors with fruity/spicy yeast esters; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish; but still definitely a slow sipper. Overall this is an excellent Quadrupel style. Great balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly. A very enjoyable offering; this ages very nicely."

"Really interesting and surprising beer, it smells sour but when you taste it, it is just like someone added just a few lemon drops. I hope they did not target to do a copy of Belgian Quads, which is not Mikkeller’s style, I believe they just got a base to brew something new and challenging. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
"Overall this is a really interesting Quad. In some ways it tastes a lot like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale as it lacks the sweetness I've had in other Quads, though it's certainly got the alcohol. Very tasty beer. Very highly recommended!"
""
"yet another brilliant and distinct beer from mikkeller, the king as far as i am concerned. this one pours really dark, chalky black in color, with some dark brown yeast floaters and a two inch white head with wonderful retention. the nose is alcoholic for sure, dark malts, but not bitter and toasty, sort of mineral rich, volcanic in some way. the yeast is spicy and bright, but not overbearing. its somehow delicate in such a massive brew. in the flavor i pick up something sweet but not sugary, kind of like the birch syrup beers, but to a lesser degree. really awesome malt profile, earthy and lighter despite its color. alcohol is invisible until it warms, and the yeast is classically belgian while also adding some interesting fruity elements to an otherwise black beer. feel is lovely too, great carbonation, velvety glide down the throat, and a full body that remains super drinkable. overall this is a perfect example of what a belgian strong dark ale can be, and its one i had no problem dirnking a 750ml of, despite its 10% abv. this was a special treat."
""

"I can’t remember what the cost of this one was and I guess that will determine if I buy a couple to age. Not up there with the Trappist versions but a respectable beer for sure"
""

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, dark fruit, alcohol, and some slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great aroma but the flavors just don’t match up very well."
"This is a special brew worth seeking out."
""
"O: Poor effort. Would not have again. Not recommended and not sure I want to finish the whole beer...I'm sad, but this is Mikkeller. You lose some, you win most. :)"
"Very enjoyable stuff."

"Overall- A very light, refreshing dark ale. I don't believe that's something I've thought about the style before. Simple, nothing unexpected going on, but what it does, it does with style and depth. It also goes down too easily, if anything. I'd definitely spring on the barrel-aged version if I ever see it. Highly recommended."

"O - Nothing to rave about here. Just a good mid-road quad that offers nothing new or something you can't live without."
"O/D - A really nice Quad. Maybe too sweet but tasty all the way through and had nothing to complain about."

"Overall: Its a good quad, but has the above issues. Stick to St. Bernardus or Rochefort."
"Pours a dark brown color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. Very dark, and impossible to see through. The nose is grapes, prunes, apple, caramel malt, and some spices- really well done. The taste profile is very similar, w/ warming really bringing out the richness in this brew. Feel is medium, with malt sweetness carrying the day. No evidence of the 10% abv here, and a nice lighter than expected finish. Overall, this is a fantastic beer- although it might be more of a BSDA than a Quad. I will definitely look for this one again- I enjoyed it. Cheers."

"O: This is an ok quad, nothing more, nothing less. If you're a fan of the style, you may find that this is not offensive, but also offers nothing remotely new."

"*As it warmed up, I got more out of it, some plum, coffee and chocolate I just wasn't getting before. Growing on me slightly, but still not something I will revisit."

"A rich Belgian strong ale with lots of great flavour. This is certainly a brooding Belgian rather than a brighter one."
""
""
"Overall, a really nice dessert beer."

""
""
"Final thought - try this one for sure. Love these brewers"
"Overall: I am not a fan of this Quad and to be honest it might be my least favorite of the style to date"

"O - Quads are my favourite style of beer and I'm always interested to try new ones. So often I'm disappointed, but this is superb. It is quintessentially Belgian, has all the dark fruit characteristics and hides the alcohol masterfully. A must try and drink at room temp."
"Overall, this is a decent and surprisingly drinkable quad, given the ABV. Enjoyable and at $3, can't beat it."
"This was an OK quadrupel, something I'm glad to have tried, but don't feel an amazing need to revisit again."
"It's probably hard to produce this particular fruit note from a beer but it just comes out as thinly sweet and under-fermented. Just not very enjoyable."
"Too much sugar in the wort! This smells like a fermented out sugar-drink. It's heavy, hot and unpleasant. This is not a great beer, and worse, it's a beer that gives the great examples of this style a bad name. Poor effort, Mikkeller."
"Raw, a bit alcoholic, but very interesting, and probably with a big potential in 5 - 10 years."
"The brew pours a deep mahogany hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a caramel laced two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is mainly alcohol and candy,it has a medium bodied syrupy mouthfeel which leaves your lips sticky and has tastes of boiled candy,brown sugar,medicinal hops,alcohol and finished with a barley sugar sweetness and overall its alright and definately hides a powerful punch behind its sweetness."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany with about three fingers of head fading moderately fast, with plenty of lacing. Initial whiff of aroma is reminiscent of belgian candies, figs, licorice, and peppery alcohol. The taste is similar to that expected from the aroma, along with a sweet, malty caramel flavor and a touch of banana and biscuit. Moderate body and sweet throughout the mouth, with a refreshing, bubbly swallow and a tinge of pepper and alcohol in the finish. A talented brewery producing a well developed drink with plenty of potential."
"D: In general, this is an all around good, drinkable beer."
"O. Overall I am pretty surprised at the quality of this beer. Great aroma. Good taste. Missing some of the complexity of the very best quads. This is one that I would definitely seek out again. I like that it is a touch on the sweet side."
"The beer is dark, chestnut brown with a quarter inch of beige head. The aroma brings alcohol, malt, yeast, respectively. The taste is earthy, with an understated yeast flavor, as well as a healthy amount of rich malt. Silky smooth on the palate with alcohol well hidden, the feel is delicate and impressive. A good quad, I would have it again."
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Cloudy, rusty brown. The head pours small but creamy and dense. There's a lot of brown sugar and raisin on the nose, sweet licorice, star anise. Sweet, sugary malt and dark fruit are prevalent on the palate. Alcohol is noticeable and lends a bit of harshness to the finish. There's more spiciness than the nose suggests, peppery with a bit of anise. Medium bodied, a bit roasty in the finish with lingering licorice spiciness. A decent effort, but too boozy to be really enjoyable."
"d - Quads rule. and mikkeller rules. so of course this beer rules. nuff said. get this."
"d - was really in the mood for a quad tonight. at first my nose told me this would be too sweet, then my initial first sip told me it was too bitter...then when my tastes buds dug into the beer, it really became the beer that i was hoping to enjoy tonight. the creaminess and body are like many classics and the flavor, although on the bitter side, really hit the mark. this is a solid beer...in a style where this is stiff competition."
"M/D: There is a medium amount of carbonation in this bottle, but it just seems flat and watery. Not a good representation of a quad at all. Nothing complex, it seems like there is no cohesiveness with the flavors, they don't mix well together and none of them stand very well on their own. Not a drainpour, but not a very good beer either."
"Opinion: This is a very good beer. I don't know how much it fits into the ""quad"" category versus the ""strong dark"" category. I would put it in the latter as it holds up against some of the great beers like St Bernardus Abt 12 and the likes...so this is not a beer to be taken lightly. That said, I prefer the blatant drinkability that you get with some of the other Strong Darks over this one as this has a relatively assertive dark malt character that isn't quite as ""quaffable"" as it is adding acidity and a burnt toffee note that slows down the whole drinking process. Either way, this is a very good beer and I would recommend that you pick one up and try it for yourself. It is good enough that it just may be YOUR beer."
"D - This is very drinkable and quite enjoyable to boot. It's sweet and fruity and overall really good."
"Thanks Jeff"
"d - A nice, above average quad. Would like to have again."
"D - Does a great job of hiding the 10% abv. It's smoothness and great flavor keep you coming back till it's gone."
"D: Really drinkable quad."
"Quite enjoyable!"
"D: Kind of sweet and pretty high ABV. Drinkability would depend on how you like the sweetness."
"Pours a modest brown color with a short head and a tiny amount of lacing. The smell is quite nice with a mixture of dark fruits as well as fresh grapes. A slight boozy character. The taste loses most of that fresh fruit character and instead there is simply some light sweetness and a bit of dark fruits. The mouthfeel is incredibly light, more so than any Belgian dark I've come across. Drinkability is severely affected by this and the fact that there's not all that much to the taste."
"This is a very good beer. It is very smooth and inviting. This has a very pleasant flavor that will make you want more. It is not hoppy like other Mikkellers. There is a very slight sweetness in with the slight-bitter finish."
"Note to self: re-review this beer in a state of lower inebriation, and in a more private setting..."
"Complex and tasty brew. Not quite as smooth as some of it's more established brethren, but a damn good Quad for a change of pace."
"SkÅL!"
"Not quite...its thinner on teh palate than it should be (especially being that sweet). I suppose its the high alcohol that does that. At least the beer isn't hot, it kind of tastes like melt caramel in beer form. Carbonation is low in the mouth, its way way too sweet for me. Not feeling it. There are quads infinitely better than this."
"Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this beer as it seemed heavy on the malt side and the fruit flavors weren't as well integrated as the better beers of the style. Still, it's a solid beer and it's worth a shot to see for yourself."
"Mouth feel is quite good with alcohol hidden. Drinkability is good."
"D- Not nearly as complex as most of the better quads, which happen to be one of my favorite styles. It was easy to get down for 10%, and I'd have it again just to gaze at it's appearance."
"D: This was absolutely fantastic with tons of complexity and rich flavors. It had amazing body too, and hid the alcohol like crazy, so it was infinitely easy to drink. Reminiscent of Van De Keizer (blue), which is one of my favorite dark Belgian ales ever. This could maybe improve with age, but I already love it fresh."
"One easy-drinking Quad, if a bit simplistic, if there ever was such a thing. Despite my description, this is perhaps a bit more complex than that, but the focus really seems to be more on the clean, smooth, tasty, and imperceptible strength of this offering. Good stuff, even for the price, which for the vessel in question, is indeed a veritable bargain."
"Hey, you could do a lot worse than drinking a Mikkeller, so if you've been wondering I recommend giving it a run."
"Mmmmm malty heaven. Poured with a nice off white head and lots of lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is very malty yeast dark ripe fruit. Flavor is like nose. Easy drinking. Body is good and ditto carbonation. Finish is nice and on the short side."
"Poured a hazy brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, caramel, chocolate and small alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth sticky texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy chocolate sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid complex brew."
"""Monk's Brew", eh? Well, it must be true, as those two guys on the bottle are both tonsured. That's about all it takes for me. The pour is as dark as a monk's robe and has the same coloration: dark, dusty black-brown, with that lighter splash on top (normally, this would be the monk's head, but this time it's the beer's). Though he may spend quite a bit of his time praying, the monk also toils diligently in the garden. Returning, he reeks of walnuts, dust, figs, wheat, and sawdust. When he brews, he likes to assimilate many of these scents into his beers; it's what he knows, what he loves. Thus, walnuts, wheat, sawdust, raisins, dried oak, and plenty o' brown sugar pervade his concoctions. Yeah, he's heavy (there's a Hollies-based joke in there somewhere, but I'm too lazy to tease it out), but he ain't no Tuck, that fat lunatic. (Is it me, or was Friar Tuck a symbol of a greedy church looking to stick it to a strangely newly-assertive crown? Or was it the same greedy church stricken by guilt and looking to make amends? Too literary, I know, but this brew has brought these ideas out of some demented corner of my mind.) He's also not all that bubbly, but he'll always have a welcoming ear should you come a-knocking at his cell door. Although confessions with him can be spiritually uplifting, I have trouble seeing him all that often, as he is usually a bit too booze-headed."
"Verdict: Monk's Brew is a solid, though generally unexciting dark Belgian that would benefit greatly from more intensity. Just watch out for that well-hidden punch!"
"A little surprised with the taste. Expected more sweetness. Lots of coffee, some dried fruit, but not the depth I was hoping for. Also exhibited a not entirely pleasant bitter nuance at the back palate. Decent mouthfeel."
"Overall - An excellent beer yet again from Mikkeller... recmmended.."
"Feel and Drinkability: Finish is dry, leaving alcohol on the palate, leaving the palate wanting another drink to soothe it. Medium heavy on the palate, not quite as full as I expected it to be. First of all, I mean full for a belgian is different than full for a RIS, but still, I think that this one is a bit lesser than what I'd expected. Carbonation is low, which is good, adds to a fuller body. I'll definitely enjoy the rest of this beer, and I'm glad I picked this one up. Definitely worth it, however I'll prolly not visit it again anytime soon. I think there are better out there...Rochefort 10... but still a solid offering, well more than solid, great. One bottle is enough, don't think I could drink more than one 750 in a sitting, and I'm prolly not meant to, thats why its packaged this way."
"M&D: the carbonation remains mild and just enough to render a fresh palate, while the alc. (10%?) really hides very well - overall an easy drinker for this beer style, I'd say. The down side really is the lack of complexity. Although the structure is well in place - leading from estery fruitiness and malts through hop undertone towards a mellow and aromatic finish - I cannot help feeling a bit dissatisfied with the lack of more ""colours"" on the canvas."
"Mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated and, perhaps because of this, too syrupy for a quad. The drinkability is so-so. I finished the bottle, but wouldn't want any more."
"I will enjoy again."
"Pours a translucent cola brown with less than a finger loose light tan head that fades slowly to stringy patterns of lacing. The smell is really nice but not a classic quad...more like a Belgian Strong Dark; earthy yeast strong dark fruit figs/dates, less alcohol than anticipated, sweet and malty caramel. Nicely carbonated creamy medium bodied. Full flavored, bready-cake ""Fig Newton"" taste lingers well beyond the swallow. An easy drinker...10% ABV is well hidden. Not scoring it to style so much as I would a BSDA."
"Very nice combination of belgian style with dark ale overtones. Moderate head. Appropriate carbonation. Went well with cheesecake desert. Definite cherry flavors evident with the caramel of a dark ale. What a nice combination. SMOOTH! Definitely recommended."
"The beer pours a cloudy, dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild caramel malt scent as well as a decent amount of fruity yeast esters. It's devoid of any alcohol aroma. In fact, the entire aroma is pretty easy going for a quad; caramel/roasted malt, candy sugar, and Belgian yeast. The taste is good as well. It is a damn easy drinking 10% abv beer. It goes down the hatch smooth with some caramel malt and candy sugar flavor as well as some Belgian yeast character. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This has got to be one of the easiest drinking Belgians of all time. It's so damn smooth. Hooray Beer!"
"D: Goes down easy for a big beer and the ABV is well hidden."
"Monk's Brew (U.S.)/Monk's Elixir (non-U.S.) is Mikkeller's homage to the great Trappist ales of Belgium. They deserve kudos for aiming high and for almost pulling it off. If you're a fan of this brewery and love BSDAs as much as I do, then the purchase price is well worth it. Bottom line: a few bubbles away from potential greatness."
"Pours medium to dark brown with an off-white head. Aroma is caramel malt, candi sugar, alcohol and some dark fruit. Flavor is similar with a very sweet, dark fruit flavor. Alcohol is present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not one of the best quadrupels I have tasted, but a pretty good beer overall."
"If this thing were talking religion it could probably get me to convert. Still, I'm not sure I'm ready to consider Monk's Elixir as good as all the authentic monks' brews but I'll grant it that it's a hell of a forgery! If it were cheaper (which it's definitely not!) it would certainly make a worthy substitute to those Belgian greats. And apparently you don't have to be Belgian to brew a quality Quad; the Danish must be a pious group of beer-drinkers!"
"The nose is of figs, dates and raisins but is not overly pronounced, also a rum or brandy fruit cake odour. There is a slightly sour dark fruit taste with a pomegranite sweetness competing to tickle the tastebuds. With air, some banana and clove notes, hints of coffee, and a long finish that has a bit of alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is rewarding, rich and smooth with good body. This beer demands to be sipped and savoured, it has some depth and complexity to it and might be better savoured with some ageing although can be enjoyed now as well."
"Haven't had a Danish quad, let's see what the Danes got! Very dark, almost black in color with a very light tan head that forms a dense, creamy layer and laces nicely. Interesting, looks more like a Belgian Strong Dark. Intense chocolate aroma, with plums and cherries. Dry taste throughout, pleasantly malty with a bread-dominant flavor and a nice chalky finish. Not complex at all, sort of a one-note orchestra, but they hit the note. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and a little flat. Drinkability is decent, but the strong roasted aftertaste limits it for me. An interesting derivation of the style, but very simple and a little dry. Its an interesting brew but definitely not a standard for a Quad."
"From my experience so far Mikkeller seems to be a bit hit and miss--at least regarding my own palate--but I give them/him credit for pushing the limits and experimenting. This time around was pretty close to a philospher's stone, great quad or dark ale or whatever they're trying to pass this off as, excellent dark Belgian ale that's worth going back to. Check this one out for sure and stock up on it."
"Tastes young, especially with the level of raw-tasting sweetness it has."
"Not really that good."
"this divine brew pours up a solid brown color with a thin off white head. very nice retentive lacing. in thine nose, i detect aromas of dark fruits, pears, red grapes, caramel malts, a nice quad aroma. the taste is rich malt, cocoa powder, dark fruits again, plums, dark grapes. no alcohol detected at all, masks it quite well....indubitably. very smooth, medium bodied, low carbo. a very tasty brew. eating a steak whilst enjoying this brew, really makes this beer taste like a cognac."
"Overall very solid, a nicely done version of the style for sure. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again, in fact I would very much like to seek it out. Nicely done as always from an always solid brewer."
"Fairly full and quite smooth in the mouth, with a plus in drinkability, especially given the style and the higher octane content. This brew is a pleasure to consume with a price that's not atrocious, especially for an import. Give it a try if you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is thin. The last half of the bottle is much better than the first half. I really don't see this as a Quad. It's more of a Dubbel or a Belgian Dark Ale."
"I split this with a friend. Thats the way to go with this. A little to strong for me to sip it by myself, but it is very enjoyable. One of the better Mikkeller beers I have had. Recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly cloudy deep brown color ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of sweet caramelized malt with notes of light dry fruit and some fruity ester. Taste is also dominated by sweet caramelized malt with some notes of candi sugar and cookie dough. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no signs of alcohol. Well done thought it is lacking some complexity compared to some of the best from this style."
"MF&D - the feel is excellent, despite the lacking flavours. there is that perfect balance between levity of body and carbonation, but the body is just a bit too light to be perfect. despite the overall lack of performance on the flavour front, the brew is still quite pleasurable to drink, mainly because it goes down so easily."
"Pours a deep brown color with ample tight and creamy tan head. The aroma is slightly fruity, mostly raisin, fig and plum. The taste profile consists of the same, slightly sweet and fruity. I hate to sound like a Bud Light commercial, but this beer's drinkability is through the roof. light bodied, yet full flavored beer that lets her hair down and reveals the alcohol content as she warms up."
"Overall/Drinkability: Overall the esters from this 10% ABV brew were too much for me. I love high gravity brews, but they usually don't taste like this."
"The body might be where this beer separates from traditional Belgian varieties. Medium fullness and roundness, where the authentic ones are soundly full and robust. Still, this beer finishes quite dry, medium malty, medium on bitterness and bite, and medium on alcohol. Maybe too timid? But then we've seen American versions that throw caution to the wind and instead of increasing the intrigue, we create a mess of a beer. I think this beer is on the right track, but not quite reaching its intended destination."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass, a very nice cloudy grapey color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of grapes, raisins, figs, plums, with some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with lots of dark fruits. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well for the brew. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"Moderate body with good carbonation. Overall really hard to get past the dank notes. Surprised this isn't rated lower."
"Taste is even more of the dark fruit onslaught. Really encompasses most of the beer. Tends to get a little bitter in the middle. Still pretty full and enjoyable. Decent beer. I feel it needed something to detract from the dominant fruit flavor."
"Mikkeller, you've let me down."
"D - A 10% beer that is rather lacking in the body & complexity that I'd expect from a Quad. Quite drinkable but probably my least favourite from this brewery and certainly not a great example of the style."
"Poured a medium brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of dark fruits, caramel, some yeast, a little woody, and some chocolate. Tastes of dark fruits, lighter yeast, chocolate, caramel, and a little bready. Light to medium alcohol burn that creeps up a few seconds after I drank (but overall well hidden)."
"Nice two finger, but it dissipates very quickly. Dark brown with some cherry highlights. Can't see any bubbles, but you can feel them on the tongue. Mild roasted malts and heavy tastd malts that have an undeniable sugary sweet aroma. The taste starts with Light roasted and candy syrup. The middle gets more balance with the toasted roasted malt flavors. The yeast adds more of a fruity, cake flavor. Pretty complex yeast flavors and very malty sweet. Hints of light chocolate with some earthy hints of hops."
"Enjoy!"
"D: At 10%, this is a sipping beer. I've enjoyed it over the past hour and a half and look forward to another hour."
"Overall a good interpretation of the style. Would definitely drink this again. It is slightly thin in the mouthfeel for a quad, which keeps the overall impact and taste subdued but seems to increase the drinkability. I'm torn between this being a negative factor (less complex taste) or a positive one (increased drinkability and increased refreshment). Without overanalyzing, I find myself quite enjoying this brew."
"Overall, not worth the $14.99 I paid for the bottle."
"Not one of my favorite beers from Mikkeller, but still pretty solid. Would probably not order it again, but was glad to have the opportunity to sample it."
"A strong Belgian-style beer without any traces of alcohol. But there is not much of anything else init either."
"D - Alcohol isn't obvious, and flavors are not sledgehammers. For the style, pretty drinkable."
"The aroma has alcohol, malt, caramel, fruit, and hops. The appearance is red/brown with a nice head and some haze and particles. The flavor is like the aroma with an acidic and paper finish. The palate is thin. Overall it's drinkable but nothing special."
"Carbonation is light, delicate, a bit fluffy, medium bodied."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with beautiful ruby highlights when held to light. Huge fluffy off white head persists forever. Smells of dark fruits, brown sugar, spicy yeast, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is very nice with lots of dark fruits, spices, sweet malts, maybe a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little syrupy, body is full, carbonation is crisp but not overpowering. I liked this one a lot."
"D: This one shows off barely a trace of its' 10%. Goes down far too easy!"
"I poured this from a 750ml bottle, corked and caged with silver foil on top. Huge thanks to BelgianBeerGal, who gave me this as an extra in a trade. The beer was dark murky brown with a thick tan foam, not much lace. The smell is just about perfect, this has a very similar aroma to Westvleteren 12. Dark fruits (plums, figs, etc) with delicious esters and some alcohol. The taste is nearly as good, although I taste some spice (maybe coriander) that I didn't detect in the aroma. The body is thick and coating, the flavor lasts a long time. Absolutely recommended."
"taste is very nice, not overpowering, prunes, raisins, purple grapes, touch of sweetness, some malt, and a touch of coffee, aftertaste is thick on the tongue."
"Overall, a pretty good Quad. Might be a bit much for one person though, I recommend splitting with a friend or two."
"Drinkability is ok, I always expect too much from the De Proef brewed Mikkeller's, but they never really measure up, and this one is no exception. While it's pretty tasty, it seems like all caramelized sugar and esters, which is fine, if not that sophisticated. IIRC, the price isn't helping the score either. The bottom line is it took a long while to work through, and I wasn't carving another, ever."
"Jason's bottle from Julio's. Hit the bullseye on the style. Black, lots of lace. A mouthfeel of yeast, a meal of it. A good amount of sourish brown flavour here. Sugar, toffee. Noting a feast of yeast aroma, the drinkability is very good for my favourite style."
"Deep reddish brown pour with so-so head. The aroma is very malty, which right away had me thinking this wasn't a typical quad. As it turned out, that was more in a bad way than a good way. Lots of malty flavor up front, with some cereal-like qualities. Very little in the way of ale fruitiness. Some tart brown sugary notes come in late. Really seemed more like a barleywine. The other reviews make me think I might be missing something, which is the only reason I would try this again."
"A well done interpretation of a quad. Seek out."
"Pours a dark, murky mahogany with a two-finger cream-colored head that lingers throughout the session leaving lots of lacing. The smell was very sweet with caramelized sugar and dark fruits dominating. The taste has a big sweetness of caramel malts and Belgian yeast forming a backbone on which dark fruits and chocolate. The alcohol makes itself known in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but a little lighter than most quads I've had with tons of carbonation. This is a very good example of a quad but probably a step down from the best. Still, very, very good."
"Cheers!"
"Dark ruby/burgundy color with a full head that forms interesting shapes. Aroma is pretty vibrant and shows some juicy dark fruits. Flavor has some hints of banana to accompany the dark fruit notes. It is lacking in body and texture for me. Hmmm, it's pretty good. Young right now. Somewhat disappointing in that it isn't in the same league as some of the better Belgian strongs, but it's still a tasty, well brewed Belgian style ale, certainly better than almost all American versions."
"This one gushed upon opening but it turned out to be a pretty decent brew. Possibly could've been better with aging b/c abv is evident but not bad at all."
