3.9,1.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a brownish body w/ minimal head that died quick, on top of a thick malty aroma comprised mostly of yeast, candi sugar/caramel sweet malts (touch of chocolate?), roasted malts as well as a touch of citirc hops. A rich, thick malty base of breadiness gives off a full body of balance. Getting sweetness from caramel and something like chocolate, but not as intense, as well as a dry edge from some roasted malts (IDK why I'm picking them up in this beer). A little bit of hop and peppery zip as well as a tinge of sharpness in the finish, catching me offguard due to very high ABV (which only slightly bleeds into beer). A good quad to sip on (literally) and perhaps my only knock is that is a little simplistic and the malts are the dominant force somewhat squashing the fruits, overtaking blance, and turning a potentially great quad into just really good.","clayrock81","Jan 07, 2012"

I have let this one sit a bit out of the fridge and the aroma is still a bit muted to start with then it completely opens up. There is a sweet toffee along with maybe some plums and a light citrus. Wow, a lot going on here. The strong plum, heavy wheat and dark cherry start of but then the booze and a little spice take over to finish. The 12% is noticeable for sure but it tends to settle down a bit. I really like the light dryness on the finish. Very interesting and well done Quad.

Others I was drinking with thought it was almost too sweet, but I preferred the taste over some of the other Quads that load up spices or dark fruits. This was a very nice example of a quad, albeit its high ABV and sweetness made it a little tough to take down after a while.","birchstick","Mar 12, 2010"
3.28,-14.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"D--- Pretty easy to drink, tried to share with my beer buddy, Beermantimmie, but he had to head home and take care of the baby girl daughter. Probably will improve with some cellaring, overall good quality.","DBoone","Mar 01, 2010"
4.09,6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a copper/red color with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, but not much lacing at all. Aroma is very sweet, malty and strong, it smells like dark fruit (figs, cherries, raisins), candy sugar, caramel malt, and a little bit of booze. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit, yeast, brown sugar, candy sugar, brandy, and some bready malt and spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's nice and creamy, and also has medium/high but soft carbonation. The smoothness of this brew makes it easy to drink, but the 12% ABV does have a kick to it after a while. Overall I think it's a good solid brew. It's certainly worth trying.","bluejacket74","Feb 26, 2010"
3.97,3.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"By style, it's naturally not overly drinkable, with a high abv and dense full body. Taste is very pleasant though, making it a nice sipper. A pretty good representation of a Quad, but not the best I've had.","lightindarkness","Feb 13, 2010"
3.9,1.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall, not a bad rendition at all.. I'm guessing that with a little age on it this could be really really good. I'm gonna pick up another bottle and let it sit for a while...","Tilley4","Feb 02, 2010"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Mnnnn, maybe nothing remarkable about this large bottle other than being a good reliable offering, which actually speaks volumes. Good quad, nice US take on the style, and will be happy to cross paths with it in the future although I prefer other Schlafly offerings.","Daniellobo","Jan 20, 2010"

4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"As Belgians go, this beer felt heavy on my palate, though now I see it's a whopping 12%. By comparison to Bush Noel (also at 12%), I couldn't expect the mouthfeel to be any lighter. In the context of a dark, Belgian sipper of a beer, this is pretty decent. Still, the spicy, sweet fig, honey, orange peel and chocolate cookie taste of this quad, while interesting, isn't quite complex enough to stand up to the legends in this style while give your tongue a seemingly endless array of notes.","tempest","Dec 07, 2009"
4.32,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours amber/red with a small off-white head. The aroma is caramel malt with some yeast, dark fruits and a little tartness. The flavor is more of the same with some alcohol, heavy malts, dark fruits and the same tart fruit that I got in the aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Very solid American-made quadrupel.","Mora2000","Nov 12, 2009"
4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability? I'm enjoying the unique flavours in this Quadrupel and the warming is welcome. Overall, good drinkability despite the fact that this will be only brew tonight. I heartily recommend giving this one a go.","Bitterbill","Oct 14, 2009"

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"750 bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Bottle conditioned. Opens with a big pop. Pours a clear amber tinted gold. Lots of carbonation, but only a finger of off white head. Slightly spice aroma from yeast. A bit of sugar and a little alcohol in the aroma. Full bodied and smooth. First sip seems pretty sweet, but that goes away pretty quickly, and the beer settles down. Nice and malty with some more spice in the finish. Dangerously drinkable at 12%. Alcohol is well hidden. Nothing spectacular, but a good evening's drinking.","homebrewhawk","Sep 26, 2009"

3.82,-0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Schlafly hits home runs with these special Belgian releases. The color fits with a deep brown, burgundy, plumb colored hue. Unfortunately the initial vibrant carbonation is short lived and makes short work out of the foamstand, retention, and lacing. Very fruity with plumbs, raisons, dates, figs, grapes, apples, cherries, and prunes. The power of the alcohol make the fruits taste and smell as if they have been soaked in rum. Never really fusal to taste or feel but definately heated and at times abrasive (think cough syrups). Otherwise a fruitcake breadiness leads the way and provides support for the confectionate sweetness, light tartness/vineous, and fruit flavors. Spicy throughout but not dry enough to allow the phenols to shine as they should. The beer is solid and nice but the lack of lasting carbonation leaves the beer too sweet and heavy on the surfaces of the mouth. Futhermore, the beer just lacks the depth and complexity of classic Belgian Dark Strongs.","BEERchitect","Beers"
