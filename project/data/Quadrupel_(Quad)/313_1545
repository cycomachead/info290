The taste follows the nose exactly. Sticky fruit with a sugary back round. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect taste is the backend is a little too sweet. Mouthful is medium thickness with a good amount of carbonation.

Smell is fantastic, raisins, plums a little leather maybe hint of tobacco. Taste is chewy caramel with dark fruits and a little lingering sweetness, a bit of a vinous character save for the carbonation. Delicious.

Any Belgian for that matter.  It completely lives up to the hype.  the pour is nice with a tan head.  The smell has lots of dark stone fruits, rich toasted malt, maplely.  The taste just went through a rainbow of flavors, plums, raisins, dates, with maltiness, a little toastiness to name a few, with a light dry, very light hop finish.  It is incredibly complex, and continues to grow more and more complex with every sip, just building on the last.  Drink on the warmside, 50 to 55deg Fahrenheit. This beer is so smooooooooth. Just a fantastic beer.  It's one of my Top 3 Beers of all Time.","Trapist007","Jan 21, 2015"

4.29,-6.9,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Bottle from the cellar, marked 27-03-15. Dark reddish root beer brown with five fingers of sudsy beige foam. Rich sweet nose: Milk chocolate, sultanas, rum toffee,  faint clove, banana chips, strawberry, subdued grassy hops. The aroma does live up to the hype. And the taste? I do understand the comparisons with St. Bernardus Abt 12 (allegedly these beers are the same recipe, different yeast strain). A supremely well-integrated combination of toffee/candy sugar, carob, molasses, cooked fruit (pears and mixed berries), clove-like phenols, licorice, grapes, root beer extract, ginger, plum liquor ... Heady alcohol bloom is the icing on the cake. Although the initial sips are sharply medicinal and boozy, the beer mellows in the glass and on the palate such that the great nuances shine though. Curiously dry and "drinkable" with a lighter than expected body and rather prickly mouthfeel. Some floral hops poke out in the otherwise cacao-like malty finish. Red berry and currant flavors are lingering long after my glass is empty. "Best beer in the world" is not a debate that can ever truly be resolved but this is certainly worthy of the accolades bestowed. Maybe the rarity factor used to play a role here ... With improved availability will the hype wither a bit? Not sure it matters. Worthy of its place in the Trappist pantheon.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 08, 2015"

Ridiculously drinkable at +10% waves of Dark Fruit, Brown Sugar, Cream Soda, Vanilla, Oak, Cinnamon and Caramel slap the palette. Undertones of Yeast, Grapes, Chocolate, Cherry, Clove and Nut are present. Butterscotch, Banana, Licorice, Fig and Tobacco can be picked up in the after taste. The aroma is much like Christmas spice with Plums, Brandy, and Wine being picked up. The feel is medium and bubbly. I really can't pick out a flaw, may be a bit 'too much' (complexity and ABV) for a novice, other wise I don't have a single bad thing to say. Overall this brew is amazing and well worth the hunt~","BrewUSA","Nov 08, 2014"

4.71,2.2,4.5,4.75,4.75,5,4.5,"2010 vintage. Pours dark brown, very little white head. Smell: dark fruit, plum, sweet Carmel, cream brûlée , some vanilla .Taste:  wow, amazing. A lot like the nose, caramel, plum, some dark cherry,vanilla, perfect sweetness.  Mouth feel: scary drinkable, slight creaminess, not a lot of carb, not as thick as I expected.  Overall: I did this side by side with abt 10 and roch 12, and this was a clear winner. I will admit that this is the only aged bottle but wow does this live up. Doing it side by side to fresh bottles show how amazingly the beer ages.  usually after 4 years a beer's flavors have blended TOO well, but this is magic. So happy to finally have opened this. The beauty of this beer lies in its world-class balance.","brewtus","Nov 03, 2014"

The fruity, complex taste is complemented by the atmosphere of enjoying this in the hop fields of western Belgium. I highly recommend taking the trip to Westvleteren in order to enjoy one of the best beers that I have ever had the privilege of tasting. It is truly a pilgrimage that should be taken by every serious beer lover.","Footballtennishockeygolf","Nov 01, 2014"

Fitting carbonation helps the body from becoming too heavy - adds refreshment. Full-bodied, complex beer, pleasantly sweet with a unique character, turning into an earthy direction with hints of chocolate in it. Very smooth mouthfeel, a little oily. Warm, slightly bitter, coffeeish finish.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"

5,8.5,,,,,,"O:Complex still very light, high abv but not so invasive. The chocolate predominance is a good surprise, making this beer unique in it style. More delicate than Rochefort 10, but with all complexity makes a perfect balanced quad, a wonderful style, but too extreme for some. I really like Quadrupel style in all its complexity and Westvleteren XII is a perfect Quadrupel.","RaphaelSC","Sep 15, 2014"

Google led me to the only bar in Brussels that served it, a gorgeous place built in the 1400's I think (and last painted in the 1600's I would wager). Perhaps it was the road weary barmaid or the loco dude siting to my right who was deep into a political debate with someone sitting between us that only he could see, but I hate to say that I was not that impressed. The beer is very complex with deep malty flavors, alcohol forward, caramel and nuts, nice bitterness, but it tasted like every other quad I've ever had. And it was served at what I would call spit-warm cellar temp, which seemed wrong. If I ever find myself in Belgium again, I'm going to the brewery. No more f'ing around, because I believe in second chances.","smallberries","Aug 22, 2014"

Notes of vanilla, leather, dates, grapes, and candied fruit all come through with a hint of brown sugar in the background. Taste starts out with malty sweetness which comes off as being quite smooth. The sweetness is reminiscent of candied grapes with notes of caramel and a nice cinnamon raisin bread. Flavors are balanced beautifully, which I'm sure is in part due to the age of this beer. Mouthfeel is mellow and smooth. Overall, this beer was quite the treat, now I just need to give it a try fresh.","homebrew311","Aug 06, 2014"

3.88,-15.8,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Final Word: For the price, I found this beer to be surprisingly straightforward and simple. The flavors were good (though the buttery characteristic could be a sign that my bottle wasn’t in peak shape), but they didn’t seem to mesh very well or stick around very long. I count myself lucky to have even gotten the chance to try a bottle, but find that I am completely unwilling to pay the steep price for another bottle. I’ve had plenty of beers with big price tags that were absolutely worth the price of entry, but I wouldn’t count this one among them. It simply lacked that euphoric “Wow!” that I’ve gotten from other top tier beers that I’ve tasted. When you pay $20+ for an 11.2oz. bottle, the reaction should never be indifference or disappointment. Again, I’ve found that very few reviewers of this beer include the butter/butterscotch flavor that I experienced in their profiles, which could point to my bottle being sub par due to shipping, temperature, or time, but at the same time I tasted what I tasted, and it was unfortunately disappointing given the price tag. This beer is far from bad, but it did not live up to its reputation as the best beer in the world, as the flavors weren’t full enough, and seemed to stand apart from each other instead of existing in harmony. If you get the chance to pick one up, it might be worth it just to say you’ve had it, but honestly I worry that this reasoning is what drives many people to buy it. Rarity doesn’t necessarily equal quality, and while this beer was still tasty, I found that Rochefort 10 not only gave it a run for its money, but was actually preferred by me. Check for freshness before you buy.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

Formed a thin off-white head over the dark plum colored beer. SO many aromas from this beer... dried fruit, malt, molasses, etc. The flavors are surprisingly smooth with almost no off taste from the high ABV. This was a sweet, sweet brew that I could not believe was so high gravity.

The aroma is full of dark fruits, brown sugar, malt, and warm spices. On the palate there's the dark fruit, but unlike the aroma, these are reminiscent of holiday fruit-cake dark fruits - sweet, but not cloyingly so. Nice bready malt with hints of clove. The 10% ABV adds a nice warming feeling but doesn't overwhelm. Velvety, medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a very complex and well crafted quad. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but hunting this down is hardly worth the effort with so many other readily available outstanding quads, especially Rochefort and St. Bernardus.","JohnG190","Apr 12, 2014"

4.5,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle from GBBF 2013. Well done to the international bar for sourcing these. Drunk on Bank Holiday Monday August 26th 2013. First sniff from the bottle and this is surprisingly beery and malt grainy. Not the overpowering hit of alcoholic complexity I was expecting. Pours dark reddish brown, with some nice reddish clarity in the glass. Thin off white bubbly head. First full on aroma is very malty. Caramel, ripe fruit, particularly a banana estery aroma, dark rye bread. Lots of banana and caramel, ripe plums. Taste is tangy and estery, but surprisingly quaffable and drinkable. It’s caramel, banana estery, some light dark fruit, plums and a bit of brandy or cognac alcoholic kick on the finish, with some of that black rye bread. Texture is medium, not heavy really, and it’s quite sticky and sweet. It’s less complex and heavy than Rochefort 10, but way more drinkable IMHO. I really like it. Could knock one of these back every day. 17.01.14 - comparison with St. Bernardus Abt 12. The Westy is definitely maltier and dryer compared to the fruit of the St. B. and the Westy 12 has a beautiful malty banana nose, which out-rates the St B. The Westy 12 although more subtle does have a bigger alcoholic kick than the St B though.","EdKing","Apr 10, 2014"

You go into it expecting this insane, flavor-bomb of power that will forever change your views and opinions of beers. You don’t really get that. The real magic of this beer is in just how simple and clean the execution of it is. The balance is unsullied, with the booze and the malt bill meeting for a beautiful dance in the center of the room. They just take their recipe and should you how it’s done, without the need for any bells, whistles, or unnecessary flair or novelty. This beer is all about harmony, and doing the right thing at the right time. The nose and the flavoring both embody this mantra naturally and intrinsically, so it comes as an even bigger surprise when the mouthfeel comes crashing in unfettered. It is so thick and creamy, creeping along like molten lava, acting like the perfect delivery vessel for the bold cleanliness of flavoring. This is an exercise is technique, and although some may be disappointed by the flavoring alone not taking them into the clouds, one must sit back and appreciate the art of the craft and what it means to strive for brewing perfection. Hard to track down, but well worth it if you want to taste what a fantastic beer is made from.","TheBrewo","Mar 26, 2014"

I haven't had a st bernardus in a while, and maybe it's time to try one (maybe side by side with the west12?) but from memory, this is a smoother, more stable, taste and I really think this is better in my opinion.","pkalix","Mar 02, 2014"

Rochefort is more of a caramel scent. The taste of the Westy will initially throw you, striking you as overly bitter at first. As other reviewers have pointed out, you may not like this one on the first taste but it will quickly win you over. It has an extremely complex flavor. I would not say this is a "fruity" beer but there are fruit notes, along with wood and maybe even a little smoke. The finish is warm but not boozy. Perfect beer. If you are lucky enough to get some, do it justice: serve it around 60F in a perfectly clean glass, pour it carefully to avoid the sediment, have a clean palate, etc. I must say I cannot disagree that this is possibly the best beer in the world.","EmpiricalBill","Nov 10, 2013"

Very light mouthfeel for such a big, flavorful beer. Delicious!","Maltenbach","Nov 02, 2013"

There is so much going on. A lot of malt and Dark fruits, mainly plum, fig and raisin. A lot of pear, sparkling grape and orange zest. Caramel, spice, nutmeg, cloves and a unique sparkling wine/brandy combo. The alcohol is present but subtle. Than there is the mouth. Much of the same going on here. A huge malt backbone with a lot of dark fruits up front that fade immediately into a sweet caramel, almost creamy butterscotch like flavor. Nutmeg and cloves blended in perfectly again with that alcohol/wine mix followed with some licorice. Very smooth finish. Best beer in the world? Yes. Definitely!","Tortman","Oct 07, 2013"

I have now sampled beer from every Trappist brewery and I don't know if it is for better or worse that most will try this one last because it makes you realize what the other breweries are aiming at. It has that semi-sweet (never dry, never cloying, but teasing you with moments of both), lightly tangy quality that must surely come from the sugar usage. Like all great strong beers, it is dangerously drinkable and unlike so many US big beers or "extreme" beers, it is not intense in any regard really. The alcohol comes on a bit strong at times, and so it is possible that aging this beer might be wise, but I'd hate to lose the wonderfully fresh malt and ester qualities that really make it sparkle. Belgian and Trappist beer fans would do well to seek this out, but those looking to get their minds blown by an intense beer would do better to spend their time and money pursuing something state-side.","JudgeRoughneck","Sep 24, 2013"

More carob, golden syrup, blossom honey, toffee, medicinal phenols, anise, ginger, booze-soaked golden raisins, raw candi sugar and a watery, slightly fruity currant character.

Also, I definitely taste the similarities between this and St. Bernardus Abt 12 (although this one is a little spicier). Anything else? Oh, yeah.

Honestly I had the mindset that there really couldn't be a much better quad than a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus ABT 12, but all hype aside, this is the better beer. I would love to do a blind test just to make sure... This one is so much lighter in feel but without sacrificing flavor or anything for that matter. It seems to emphasize the bready, biscuity characteristics instead of being dark fruit dominant like other quads. And I guess you can attribute it to the stellar brewing craftsmanship of the monks, but the alcohol in this is even less apparent, you could almost think you were drinking a trippel. Throughly impressed, waiting to try my 3rd one, and hopefully the other's once I make it out to Belgium again.","Roman5150","Aug 17, 2013"

I just can't justify not marking a beer off for wanting 3 years of cellaring to drink. That said this is complex as hell, the flavors are well balanced and well put together. With that said it's not for me. The flavors will mellow and blend more but the end result will still be a beer that's too sugary and has spices that I can pass on.","bobhits","Jul 28, 2013"

4.6,-0.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"O - some of these authentic Trappist ales make me think to myself that if I didn't have 2 beautiful little boys at home I'd move to Belgium and take up a life of prayer, a life of work, and a life in a community while wearing wool robes. Just as long as I got to drink stuff like this everyday. But hey I wouldn't trade my family for anything so I quickly come back to reality. Anyway, this is the God Father of all the Trappist brews and the King of fine Belgian ales in general. It has a rep that's nearly unmatched and often great Trappist brews are overlooked due to the mystery and the need to know that comes with the Westy 12. It's definitely one of the best crafted brews on the planet, but aren't all Trappist ales? It's the world's best quad, but is it that much better than the Rochefort 10? Yes to me it is, but its not on a whole different level. Both are in that top tier of best quads. What the Westy 12 does offer are flavors no other quad provide and an experience every craft beer lover deserves to have. In fact an experience everyone deserves to have over and over again. It's a shame this thing isn't easier to get ahold of. Bc its easily not only one of the best I've ever had, but would be one of my favorites to pick up throughout every year. Ill definitely be paying close attention for my next experience of this Belgian gem.","BradtheGreat7","Jun 17, 2013"

I thought it was all hype and came in with a jaundiced eye, but this one really blew me away, which was an incredibly nice surprise. It's not that the specific flavours in this beer were especially great compared to other quads that I've had, but it all came together incredibly well. I think that's the difference between this beer and all the others. (4.75)","Stevedore","Jun 16, 2013"

5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall Impression: This is the Quad to end all Quads. An immediate dark fruit punch in the mouth with slowly developing dark malt and yeast character that somehow manages to stay medium bodied and a slightly dry finish. Although it is very similar in taste to most well made quads, its nimble body and drying finish take the Westy XII to another level. This is a malt bomb that is amazingly drinkable.","dwren89","Jun 12, 2013"

4.86,5.4,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,5,"Picked up a bottle in a swap for some BT last year. Split it with the wife, pouring into a pair of tulips. It fizzed up quite a bit, like a soda, and then quickly dissipated into a thin head with a rich, deep caramel color base. The nose was perfectly sweet, with strong notes of candied figs and dates. For a quad, I was surprised at how mellow and sweet it was, rather than dark and powerful. I thought it was really drinkable for a 10%, and could easily put down more than one bottle if afforded the opportunity. The alcohol was warm, but not overpowering. It had a bold feel, but not chokingly strong. Again, mellow was the word I kept thinking of, with a bit of a sticky finality that I think was more in my head from the fruit smell/taste than actually having me smacking my lips. Overall, I was afraid after all the hype I would be slightly disappointed, but it was actually the opposite. I was even more impressed with this than I hoped I could be. Absolutely worth going out of your way to enjoy.","yankeepride","Jun 06, 2013"

This beer goes beyond complex. Each and every sip I took I got a different experience of flavors. The owner of the place I got it from took out a bottle, poured it into a westy12 glass and the head just kept on going thru the tip of the glass, and staying there. Took a frew big, deep breaths into my nose and trying to get a hint of anything going on off the top of the glass.

I am maybe most impressed by how well the alcohol is hidden. one would never know this beer is so strong. one of those rare moments when you feel a connection with people you have never and may never meet. this beer is like a brotherhood of sorts, and I am humbled and honored to be a part of it now.","StonedTrippin","Apr 28, 2013"

Notes from tasting fresh at the brewery in Dec 2010, bottle cap reads 04.08.13. Poured the bottle into the Westvleteren chalice this beer has a thick tight tan head that has some staying power and laces the glass. Dark brown to black on top, lighter brown color noted towards the thin bottom. Aromas are toasted barley malt, with a chocolate characteristic. Great mouthfeel. Complex, very smooth with the alcohol hidden amongst all the other flavors. Super drinkable for such a high ABV beverage. The complexity of this beer is quite great, this is definitely the best of the 3 beers. Compared to the other great quads of Belgium I'd put this one in the world class category but a notch below St. Benardus Abt. 12 given slightly less estery goodness and the price and availability issue. Well now that I'm here I better have another...I might never get another.","deebo","Apr 16, 2013"

Great subtle smell with lots of dried fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very nice--slightly dank with more fruits and a touch of sweetness. The real strength of this beer is the mouthfeel, in my opinion--super-soft and almost creamy. Well-balanced, overall.

I must say that those who rushed into drinking one right away missed out. I know it must have been very difficult to wait however, to let this beer ripen for a few years one would find a more earthy, well balanced flavor, without the alcohol burn at the end. I love this beer, just opened a bottle dated 14/12/14 which I bought at the Abby in 2011 and based it against one bought last month. The favors of the fruits are more pronounced/distinctive throughout. If you have any left, store it properly and let it sit for a few years, then review it again.","Mpollard","Mar 19, 2013"

If you've never tried it, I would recommend seeking out a bottle, and maybe a couple extras to save for special occasions. With that being said, is it worth the extra money and effort it would take to obtain this on any type of semi regular basis? In my opinion, no (and I don't know that there's any beer out there that would be).","Jonada","Mar 11, 2013"

This is terrific - the aroma has been bumped up slightly, as the bottles that are exclusive to Belgium display a funky, yeasty characteristic - like a freshly cut green apple or pear. The beauty really IS in the yeast with this beer, and undeniably puts it far apart from the other Trappist beers as the dark horse of the bunch.","magictacosinus","Mar 06, 2013"

Also, I am now reading online that I may be trying this beer “too new.” It has 14.11.15 stamped on the cap which would be November 14, 2015. A poster on Beer Advocate suggested that the bottling is three years previous to this date which would make the bottle that I'm drinking only 2 and a half months old. The ideal suggested age is 3 years. And I thought I was being impatient.","artoolemomo","Feb 03, 2013"

This beer is a work of seamless balance and grand complexity. It just feels more focused and more refined than any other beer within the style, and it may well be the most drinkable beer of its size. There are those within the style that draw very close comparisons, and some may even have a slight edge in terms of complexity and depth of flavor. However, it's the balance and sheer drinkability that set Westvleteren 12 apart and make it worthy of its place among the world's elite beers.","ryan1788a5","Jan 22, 2013"

Having this as I brew my first beer ever. Hoping that I will get some good vibes in my wort! Pours deep murky brown with fluffy light kahki head. A bit of reddish hue on the edges. Smells of figs, plums, pears, raisin, light alcohol, bit of bready nuttiness. Flavor is slight bitter up front that explodes into chocolatey fig and white grape. Some nutty bite going on as it mellows into a fruity sweetness. More carbonation than I expected, but still chewey mouthfeel. Lasting bouquet of fruit.

Bit khaki head that slowly falls and leaves plenty of lacing behind. The smell is a nice blend of caramel, vanilla, figs, raisins, malt, molasses, and dried black cherries. The taste is just as complex and leaves nothing to be desired. A nice sweetness in the finish and it leaves you wanting, craving, more. World class beer.","IggsRay","Jan 08, 2013"

After hearing for years that a Rochefort 10 is equally on par with this if not better, I have to say that I do not agree. Maybe it is the age that made this one so special and tasty but I remember being really unimpressed with the Rochefort 10 I had around a year ago. This reminds me agreat deal of the St Bernardus 60th Anniversary beer which I previously thought was the best Belgian beer I have ever had. I would have liked to sample this next to that one to really see who is tops and I will revisit a Rochefort 10 I have been aging as well in a year to see if my memory/opinions will change but I cannot say enough about this beer right now, it was quite special indeed.","claspada","Jan 02, 2013"

A bit of carbonation on the rear of the tongue. Nutty up front, caramel apple appears shortly after. Alcohol warmth shows up late and lingers in the throat. Some alcohol bitterness appears as well.

Most of that had to do with the unavailability of this beer in North America but there's no doubt that I don't regret a minute of the wait or cost of this beer. It's not #1 in my book but with so many offerings available these days, this easily beats out 99% of what's on the shelf or on tap at the local brewery or brewpub. This was fabulous from start to finish and I don't care what the extra bottles I have would fetch via a trade - they're either going into my stomach or to people that I deeply care about.

4.97,7.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"O: I think people are disappointed or underwhelmed with hyped beers like this, and let's say a brew like Pliny the Elder, because they aren't in your face, extreme beers. They certainly are a bit over-hyped and played out to be, but at the end of the day, it comes down to how simple and balanced they are. This is just a perfectly balanced Trappist Quad that delivers. Sweet but not overly so, and just the right amount of dryness. It is complex as hell. This is a beer that's also amazing paired with food. I'd put the other Trappist Quads, like Rochefort and other Belgian versions of the brew style, St. Bernardus Abt. 12 for example, right up there with it but it does stand out. These monks are not fucking around over there and I do respect their choice not to expand and distribute this work of art widely. Thanks for the gift sets and good luck with modifications to your monastery. I really wish I had access to more though, guess I'll have to wait for my pilgrimage.

The taste is incredibly complex, so much going on with the belgian candy sugar, molasses, the roasted notes from the malts and the dark fruit just all meshes so beautifully together with what is an amazing yeast strain. To get to 10% with almost no presence of alcohol lingering is quite amazing while keeping enough residual sugar that it lingers on your lips, it's by far the best quad / belgian strong dark ale I've ever had.

From start to finish just incredible in almost every aspect.  Is it the best beer in the world?  Impossible to tell, as with all the different styles, and personal presences, it's an almost arbitrary distinction.  That being said, I would have to say its probably the best beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, and if not number 1, certainly in the top 2-3.  World class.  ","zac16125","May 04, 2012"

4.43,-3.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a 2007 vintage bottle (33cl) at Akkurat; murky brown with a concerted cloudy core, a tan light foam rests at the surface consisting of tiny bubbles. Perceptible sediments in the glass. Polite medium intensity nose with multiple layered odor of massive licorice aroma, refreshing cola syrup, chocolate pudding, butterscotch and a hint of fruit, raisins mostly. Along with superb complexity this beer brings synergy to my nose each time I sense it. The beer is full bodied, mouth filling and silky. The high alcohol is not quite evident and malty taste above and beyond the perfect equilibrium of bitterness and sweetness brings this beer into sum balance. Caramelized tones, licorice, butterscotch, dried fruit, cacao, cola syrup and some tiny hints, symptomatic of bubblegum summer berries. This beer is outstanding, and yet I feel there's something missing. The concentration is outstanding, but not extravagant. This is surely a masterpiece, but I'm not blown away. Perhaps my expectations were excessively high for this legend of a beer, lacking a bit of feel and extraordinary touch. http://quaffable.org/?p=32","dln646","Apr 16, 2012"

The alcohol is warming in the back of the throat after each sip and a slight amount of bitterness as well. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly drying mouthfeel.

Was expecting a slap in the face from the taste, but was greeted with a smooth, blended combination of the notes from the scent. Bready, fruity, sweet, savory in all the right quantities.

Perhaps this is down in part to the relative rarity and therefore premium price point. Unsurprisingly, reminiscent of St Bernadus Abt 12, which whilst being good isn't my favourite of the quads. I'd go as far as to say Rochefort and De Struise offer slightly better beers, as well as being readily available to me and a much more cost effective option. I'll be cellaring a handful to explore how the booze and carbonation mellow and the flavours integrate, as in my estimation a few years will make it outstanding. Despite this, the overall score speaks for itself. Clearly the work of expert hands...","haz77","Feb 06, 2012"

Each of the two aforementioned beers are great without a doubt, but if money was no object I am drinking the Westy over the other two. Will definitely age out the remaining four I have left to see how it matures year by year. Yes, this beer is expensive and hard to get but I have to say I now know what the hype was about. It's a freaking fantastic beer that has made it's way into the top 3 best beer I've ever sampled. Best beer in the world as people say? Cant say, because I havent tried them all!

I drank about half of my stock (about 10 cases total) and have saved and began to age the other half. I break one out and drink it about once a month or so. I am fortunate enough to have tried a variety of Westvleteren 12s, some being as old as 30 years (acquired these from a Belgian teenager who found a couple cases of Westy's in his Grandmas basement!) I have found that the "sweet spot" for these beers is about 5 years old (+/- a year). The beers that fall into this range are perfect. There is not much more to be said, they are the perfect beer. Store these beers right and they will reward you with the best that any beer has to offer. Liquid caramel. Smell, taste, everything is spot on. This beer is rightfully the number one beer in the world.

The nose is wood, ginger, raisin, fig, date, orange-zest, leather and dark chocolate. The taste unbelievably complex: wood, caramel, toffee, plum, cherry, date, prune, fig, stewed pear, red grape, banana, vanilla, leather, smoke, charcoal, milk and dark chocolate, rich-roast coffee, liquorice, nice alcohol warmth....the list could go on. The underlying sweetness balances the more savoury flavours. It has fine carbonation, a full body, layers of complexity, surprising smoothness and one of the longest finishes around. Awesome.","Sc0pey","Jan 31, 2012"

This is the best beer I have ever had and I can only hope that I can get my hands on another one before I die. We poured it out of the traditional unmarked bottle into the most ghetto of clear plastic cup, it pains me to even admit that, but good beer will always be good no matter what. It appearance was a dark murk brown and it had a large yellow/brown head. It had a heavy unami aroma that was very pleasant. Up front it has a simple sweet/malty taste with even a hint of raisin while the back-end of it provided a little spice and heat perhaps due to it being aged for two years. I was told to swish it around in my mouth and there was an explosion of flavor as it turned to a cream like consistency. I would also say it had a little bitter and roasty notes throughout the tasting. Would definitely recommend it and I may have to make a trip to Belgium.","pcents","Jan 29, 2012"

4.92,6.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"O. Having had Rochefort 10 and St. B in the last week in preparation to try the Westy 12, I am basing a lot of my review on how Westy 12 compares to those excellent beers. In all honesty I think Westy 12 is an amazing beer. For me there is quite a few similarities to St. B Abt 12. I think the Westy 12 is just a bit better overall. Very complex aroma and taste. Nice carbonated full bodied mouthfeel. Is this the best beer in the world? That is hard to say, as one of the best beers in my favorite style, I would have to say it is certainly in contention.","siradmiralnelson","Dec 11, 2011"

5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Unfortunately this beer came at the beginning of my beer drinking career and I'm convinced has forever tainted my taste by setting the bar so damn high. It is perfect, subtle yet bold with a fruity taste that is neither to sweet nor to tart. Light with an amber/brown color, it goes down smooth and has a taste reminiscent of times only monks could capture in a beverage. A+ and R.I.P probably the only bottle i will only drink, if you see this, get it.","sespourteille","Dec 09, 2011"

The smell is very faint I pick up the Belgium yeast, a boozy smell and very faint caramel sweetness. The first sip is amazing, where I was let down by the smell the taste blew me out of the water. Great caramel/molasses flavor, nice dark fruit like raisins or figs, and that great Belgium yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is prefect great balance between the carbonation and the body. Overall this was one of my favorite beers I had, the 10% alc was extremely well hidden in the taste. This is a dangerous beer if I could get my hands on it more often I would drink this all the time.","phisigben","Dec 06, 2011"

The smell is of yeasty fresh bread and a slight booziness too. The taste is bitter on the front end but that leaves quick and your mouth is filled with a fruity sweetness that coats your whole mouth. The sweetness stays but you still get that bitterness. It is well balanced and not boozy at all like the smell leads. I can see why this one is rated so high. while I do agree with it having a high rating I have to admit I'd take a russian imp stout over this any day.

The nose was a bit strong on the alcohol but for this alcohol by volume, I feel that is forgivable. I've never been overly impressed with this one like everyone else is, but it certainly is a great beer.

Definite suggestions of sugar, raisins and a very light spice profile. Light alcohol burn. Rich, but not heavy and a light, but effervescent body.

I'm happy that I had the opportunity to try it, and I recommend that if you can try it...keep an open mind. Maybe it will be the best thing you ever had, but I really feel a lot of the strong ratings come from the rarity/hype around this gem.

As i walked into In Dre verde my whole body was shaking with anticipation and i must say the 12 didn't let down. It was poured into the Westvleteren glass and it looked so elegant. It had a perfect one and half inch head right up to the lip. And from the first sip i could tell what an amazing beer it was. Just like the other Westys it has a full and I mean FULL body and right away you can taste 4 or 5 different flavors coming through. What most impressed me was the smoothness. From start to finish it was incredibly consistent. After all of my hyping my father and friend were also very impressed and could see why we made the trip. Can't wait to try another bottle of this when i get home","tenaciousp65","Oct 23, 2011"

Pours a super syrupy brown with nearly zero head on a careful pour. Smells very bready along with nuts and dark fruit. The taste is delicate brown sugar malt with several layers of sweetness. I pickup lots of belgian dark sugar and it reminds me a bit of a well aged barleywine, but not as thick or heavy. The mouthfeel is slick and a tad syrupy with a nice medium carbonation. Mild alchohol finish on it, but I loved it.","hombrepalo","Oct 18, 2011"

I may have liked it better at 3 years or even fresh but it has held up well. For those who like Rochefort 10 or any other quads this is a beer that you must try. It may not live up to the hype, for some, but it's worth the try. Even my cat loved the drop I put on the table for her.

I didn’t figure out what kind of farts it produces, or count each tiny bubble of the head. Nope, I just drank it in good company. It is thick, sweet, complex, and delicious.

Frankly, both the missus and I were expecting this one to disappoint a bit, given its chargin’ hype train, and the fact that a Belgian quadrupel is not really a go-to style for me. This one, however, has won us over completely with its subtle complexity. There are other beers that have blown my mind more personally, but I can’t think of any that have matched this one in its refinement. Subtle, but super-assertive.

5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Reviewed from Notes: I had this amazing brew on a trip to Europe that was as equally amazing. Sampled at In De Vrede in the shadow of the abbey of Saint Sixtus, it really doesn't get any better than that. This nectar of the Gods pours a lovely dark brown color, aroma is of fruit, plumbs and sugar canes. As soon as you take a sip you realize that this beer lives up to the hype..Does it get any better than this? NO. This beer coats the tongue in sweet fruit flavors and the alcohol is so well hidden that you are not aware of the effects. That is until you walk down the path at Westvleteren to the shrine and realize that you are extremely drunk. This is OK you remind yourself, as you are in Europe at the Mecca for all beer drinkers. If you ever have the chance to visit PLEASE do..you will not be disappointed. We purchased some at De Bier Temple in Brussels. The lady there has plenty to go around, so if you miss the "Beer line" or all orders are full, fear not she has you covered. Do yourself a favor and grab a Westy, it is what the Gods Drink!

Dark caramelized brown in color, hazy, moderately carbonated, with a beautifully crafted light tan head that settled right around the "Trappist" logo of the glass, retained throughout the session, and exhibited some fine lacing. Robust aroma, dark fruits, dark sugars. Extremely full of flavor, smooth, candi sugars, toffee, dark cherries, raisins, alcohol is noticeable but not at all detrimental.

4.47,-3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Big thanks to Jason for sharing this rare gem with me at the bottle share! Pours a murky brown color with a small tan head that sticks around for a little. Scent is delicious candied dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste is initially sweet caramel, followed by figs and prunes. Lots of dark fruits with hints of green apple, molasses, and brown sugar. There is also some alcohol taste to it, but not overwhelming at all. The complexity of this beer is ridiculous. Mouthfeel is extremely dry and full-bodied. Well-balanced. Drinkability is VERY HIGH for the ABV. Overall, this beer is outstanding and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it.

A peppery spiciness was there along with the candied dark fruits, a little bit of a vanilla and warming alcohol. This is an extremely well rounded and balanced quad flavor. The feel was equally as pleasant - full bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation. The finish was fantastic and imparted no harsh alcohol component. Overall this was a real treat to try - I don't know if after one bottle I'm ready to place it above some of my other quad favorites (St. B, Rochefort 10) but it is definitely a member of the exclusive group of top tier beers of this style.","surlytheduff","May 28, 2011"

The nose comprises dark greens, black pepper, clove, very bready yeast, nutmeg, figs, and light cocoa. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, nutmeg, mild milk chocolate, Belgian yeast, light citrus peel, light cardamom, dark greens, candi sugar, and grass. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light-ish moderate carbonation and an almost astringently chewily dry finish.

The pliny is a very good beer, I must admit, and it is a completely different beast, but I don't think it inhabits the same universe as Westvleteren. Westvleteren is a perfect beer. It is not THE perfect beer. But it is, IMHO, absolutely great. It is just so perfectly balanced. It really is a 5 out of 5 sort of a beer.

5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"My dear Lord. This beer poured with a perfect, beautiful head that left a lace that was almost better that a woman's. Dark amber brown, with a clarity if poured with the retraction move utilized on most Belgians with internal fermentation. It almost kills me to wait and look, because I know what's next. The flavor is outstanding, dare I say epic. The fact that it pegs the meter in all aspects of beer flavors, while at the same time maintaining a perfect balancing act, is nothing short of awesome. The yeasty flavor coupled with the hard water provide the backbone for the dry and floral flavors that dance with the light malt and hops. It finishes dry and satisfying, and begs you to open another with its tempting warm alcohol in the back of the throat. Please don't hate me for having cases of this beer in my basement when I lived in Belgium. My friend's Belgian wife was very adept at acquiring copious amounts of this platinum liquid. This is my favorite beer in the universe, and has been for over ten years.","Wegomlegging","Mar 12, 2011"
5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Luxurious, brilliant and inviting to the palette. What's cool is that the taste differs slightly between a sip and a gulp. On the sip I get a refined succulent smooth silky grape and fig personality. On the gulp it's velvety but punchy surrounded by black cherry malts, dark candi sugar and toffee with a cream soda back end then a tremendously dry frothy finish. What's peculiar is that not a single profile overpowers the other. I think what makes this work and what keeps coming to mind is its incredible balance. Its complexity shines.A couple of sips toward the end it turned a peppery anise and even floral at one point. I really wish this bottle wasn't so expensive because I'd like to re-explore this beer and give it another whirl but alas, my hasty dive has unfortunately found the bottom of my glass and to be honest with you, am a little disheartened that I can't enjoy more of this magnificent brew. Westy 12 tastes incredible fresh, I bet it's even better aged.

Currently, ranked the world's best beer gave off an opaque brown/copper appearance. As you drink it, you see many different layers of color - multi-layered complex. Smell hints of Belgium candy sugar. Mouthability and drinkability gave off a smooth and perfect balance. I could taste caramel, raisins, licorice, figs, maybe hint of orange peels, and candied sugar. Additional notes: A beer beyond measure and perfection. Now we can fully measure taste of all beers going forward now that we've had a Westy 12. By drinking the Westy 12, I wouldn't mind joining the St. Sixtus monastery. Humbling experience. Me: I feel buzzed already, Friend: No, its probably the euphoria of drinking this beer.

Taste is subdued, sweet but not in your face; I get some cola, toffee, white wine, hop bitterness on the very back that is barely there, some clove spice, mellow flavor for sure. I like the mellowness of this compared to similar brews with in-your-face spice that makes me wish I was drinking something else. Carbonation is high and mouthfeel isn't thick at all; very drinkable as the sugars aren't cloying, the pepper-clove character seems to cleans that 'sugar overload' from the palate. Drinkability was marked down to the exclusivity of this, if I could find it down the street I would sit through a sixer of it and crawl on my lips to my bed.

There is some toasted malt and noticeable alcohol. The malts are sweet but never too much so. They impart a hint of strawberries that is most enjoyable. After each swallow the warmth of the alcohol lingers on and keeps you company until you bring the glass back to your lips. It has a medium body and plenty of carbonation. Swishing it about my mouth, the beer foams up quite a bit. I could easily drink a lot of this, at least until the alcohol caught up with me. It doesn't feel or taste like a 10% ABV beer at all.

The flavor is rich and malty with sherry oxidation and a touch of cardboard, just a touch. Notes of ripe cherries accompany dates, prunes, and a strong caramel profile.

The aroma is comprised of fruit, bread, alcohol, and malt. The flavor is of malt, bananas, alcohol, biscuits, citrus, and bread. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation.

The taste is more complex then the smell but also subtle. Raisins the slightest citrus note cloves and a warm tasty booze dominates for me. The mouthfeel is not heavy at all but you know its there and the drinkability is through the roof. Not that anyone would want to but you could put a few of these down in a hurry if you had to.

A moderately aggressive pour yielded a huge three-finger white head. It settled to 1/2' which lasted throughout. I sipped this beer and there was that fluffy head at the very last sip. The nose was coffee, caramel, plums, lemon, clove, and chocolate. The taste? My goodness...dark, sweet fruit (plums, grapes) with some chocolate at the start and some spices. Belgian (bready) yeasts were evident. The finish moved to dry and even a little bitter, providing a wonderful, complex and balanced evolution. Mouthfeel was thick without being syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high, but seemed to fit. It's hard not to gush but this is just an amazing beer. I wanted to find fault with it but could not.

Better than Chimay's Blue and Rochefort's 10 w/out question (though those are both delicious beers; I haven't tried Achel's Extra yet, so I can't comment on it).

For as hyped as this beer is, I found it to be boozier than I was expecting (contrary to what many others have commented). This booziness would be more understandable if the flavors were more potent, but then again it seems that this beer is meant to tantalize the taste buds rather than punish them. I can only imagine that if I had been more patient and given the alcohol heat some more time in the "cellar" to calm, allowing the subtlety of the flavors to truly shine, I would have seen this beer as the world-class stuff it is known to be. As it stands, however, it is still a unique, complex, enjoyable beer that suffers a bit from its potency.","devilben02","Jul 08, 2010"

Served in one of the nicest beer glasses of the trappist beers, the dark brown beer looks almost like coke. An average amount of head colored light brown sat on top of the beer but dwindled after a few sips. I do not know how long the beer at the cafe has been aged (or if at all). It has a most enjoyable complex taste. Fruity and sweeter initially fading to lightly sweet, deep caramel malt flavor bordering on a malt liquor type taste.

As I finished pouring it in, I also see that the head is little but awake. So, at this point, I usually let it get 10 minutes of warming up at room temp, but i cheated and took a drink right away! How refreshing can a beer get, you ask? Lets just say that i could drink this year round..everyday!! The aroma was mild but every sense of flowery, parfume and almost like a cologne of a sense.

Really just dark, unfiltered, unpasteurized, spiced apple cider. Along for the ride, some pumpernickel bread, caramelized brown sugar, barely a hint of oxidation, but it is very well integrated. Raisins, pears and some brandy. One of the things that is so impressive about this beer, is that it's 10.2%... it's not 'light' tasting, but still just feels so pleasant on the palate. It's not as 'dark' as previous times that I have had it (or as I remember)... a little less of a dark fruit presence than some other bottles I have been a part of. Low-medium but well-executed carbonation perfectly accentuates the delicate and more subtle flavors of this beer. It's just a masterfully concocted beverage and one that I hope to be able to enjoy for years to come.

The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol. Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%. It's hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isn't the most beautiful shade of mahogany.

This is to say, it must be good at the moment you have it, but also good in the scheme of beers as a whole such that as new styles and techniques evolve it remains well regarded and enjoyable. The fact that this one has acquired a nickname (Westy) is a testament to this. Out of a bottle provided by BA members (THANK YOU!) this legend was a deep, copper color with burgundy highlights. It was visibly viscous, leaving good streaks of lacing off the well-retained head. The aroma was complex and demanding; a sensual blend of ripe plums, dates and dark fruits galore. Behind that was alcohol (esp. dark rum), chocolate, spices and the pungent twist of Belgian yeast. The flavors were just as big and layered. Chocolate, more dark fruits, coffee hints, raisins, wood, cinnamon, figs etc. etc. The doughy notes were hard to discern under the other heavier elements but the impact was like an alcohol soaked fruitcake. Despite the depth of the beer it was indeed a brew with finesse and a good finish. Easy to drink? No. It's rich and intense. Pleasant to drink? Yes, especially if you love beer. A casual drinker could be run over by this thing. The mouthfeel was good and creamy but not amazing, the body full without being heavy and the carbonation right on. Relatively drinkable for all that is has to offer and a genuine joy for the advanced palate.

Once I'd finished my glass, I went back and poured the last inch or so through a paper kitchen towel, hoping to filter out the sediment and get another few sips. I failed and ended up with a very hazy last inch. It didn't taste the same: drinkable, but the complexity was gone. Other beers (St. Austell Clouded Yellow, for example) seem quite tolerant to this, but not the Westy.

A little too thin and airy, a thicker more robust palate would bring it over the hump and set it apart from the masses for sure. Unlike their dubbel, which is world-class to say the least, and despite the superb taste profile, this one doesn't quite live up to the hype.

Other quadrupels or sweetened lambics leave beer geeks complaining over the sugar content, but still they are not as sweet as this beer. It is all quite perplexing.

The aroma is vinous with ripe grapes, grape juice, grain, beer bread and some candy sweetness underneath it all. As it warms the complexity grows, with notes of vinegar and phenols eventually opening up. Tastes bready, malty and fruity up front. The alcohol heat goes straight to the stomach and curls up into a warm fuzzy little ball. Subsequent drinks reveal some sweet chocolates and caramel as well as spice and grain.

Smell is sweet, malty, dark fruit, stone fruit, grapes, yeast, and bread. Tastes similar, but add brown sugar to the mix. I don't find this as complex and layered as the Westy 8. Maybe that means my palate isn't as complex, but it is what it is. Body is medium with medium to high carbonation. Highly drinkable. Could drink 3 no problem. But I disagree with the characterization of this beer as best in the world. It's great but easily eclipsed by several brews.

The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant.

Drinking the St. Berndardus and Westvleteren head to head has really helped define the differences in these beers. In terms of appearance, the St. Bernardus looks much more attractive to me.

As it warmed it was slightly easier to taste the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel was really good, with a high degree of carbonation to keep all corners of the pallette involved in the pleasure.

I personally don't have the want to drink this more than once a year at most.","pepsican","Jul 16, 2009"

The taste is more of the same, just about everything you look for in a beer all melded perfectly into one. The beer is medium bodied with decent alcohol presence, but with a taste that good, you barely notice.

The alcohol comes through slightly in the smell, but not to strong. The taste is filled with tons of spices and dark fruits. The alcohol has largely mellowed into the taste, though there is a warming sensation to the beer. The bitterness blends nicely into the taste, though there is a slight dry aftertaste.

This superior belgian ale poured an opaque, cloudy dark amber hue from the bottle. The perfection in this brew lies in both the flavor and the balance. The flavor is complex, yet sweet on the tongue at first with hints of banana, raisins, plums, strawberries, and dates. The finish is of smokey dark fruit with a pleasant warmth of alcohol down the throat. This ale truly has every important aspect you could hope for in a beer. The flavors work in perfect harmony together, with neither over powering one another. The carbonation is subdued, yet present enough to remind you that this is a truly special belgian ale. I am truly amazed at the subtle, yet complex collection of flavors present in this ale. For those that are considering trying this ale for the first time, please take my advice and enjoy all of the wonderful flavors at room temperature. This brew achieves true perfection, and I am honored to have experienced the world's greatest ale on my birthday. Thank you Tyler.","Dopplebock","Apr 17, 2009"

Color was a nice cloudy dark brown and looked very yummy. Smell was not overwhelmingly intense but was there and was a big hint to the complex taste that was about to happen. Sweet malts was a dominate taste with very next up dark fruits like raisins and figs etc. The taste it's self had everyone take a step back and honestly look at each others expressions. Dark fruits raisins and figs powered threw with sweet malts. More flavors were present but could not pick each one out as the beer was so complex. A bite of Alcohol was present and was a pleasant addition. The bit of Alcohol would probably hamper the continuous bottle after another bottle.

I can't work out how dry and bitter it could smoothly transform into in the rounded finish given the oily malty foretaste, while consistently there's neither any trace of big alc. nor sticky sugary mouthfeel. This might have been the smoothest and harmonious Quadruple that I've had the luck to try - if it could be obtained at a much lower price (I was charged US$18 by the "Belgian Shop"!), I wish to sip one bottle of this ale a month, just to remind myself how blissful and tranquil the beer world can be, without much pretence and loudness.","wl0307","Mar 07, 2009"

My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isn't enough.

Pours a hazy deep brown color, with huge (2 finger), thick head that quickly evaporates into my goblet. Little darker than I expect from a quad. The smell was striking to me, and in a good way. It was nice mix of the sweetness of raisins and honey and an almost red wine alcohol smell. A very unique, and very enticing smell. The complex aroma is definitely a forebearer of the taste. A blend of a malty, sweet backbone, with spices, and that red wine character (I am not a huge wine advocate, so I cannot describe it any more specifically, and have never used a wine reference in a beer review, it just fits here).

Poured a mahogany/cola color - some light penetration with ruby red highlight around the edges and tiny particles visible in solution. Incredible head retention unlike any brew I've ever had, with thick sheets of sticky lacing evident throughout the tasting. Nose was wine-like with some woody characteristics, spices and cherry-flavored cough medicine. Taste follows nose with a dry, oaky and spicy finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a tingly effervescence from beginning to end. Hands down the best Quad I've ever had. So smooth and easy drinking with an abv that's undetectable.

Pleasantly sweet aroma of cherries, prunes, brown sugar, licorice, bread dough, oak, and yeast. Unbeleivably light mouthfeel. Its like the beer hovers on your tongue. Amazing taste. It mimics the aroma quite well, with an intriguing combination of tastes. I had the same problem as others: it was very, very difficult to pin down specific flavors. It was almost as if the beer was blending and mixing while in your mouth. Sweet, sour, spice, and fruit were in constant motion and made up a beer that is almost undescribably good.

Still a good touch of candy(i) sugar and light yeast. Leather. Some caramel is evident also. Taste is just as amazing. Good fruit flavors again, not too thick from caramel and the like. Candy sugar and a lightly toasted bready yeast. Also some subtle bubble gum flavor. A delicate touch of spice and candy sugar. Mouthfeel isn't as velvety as possible but very nice. More on the medium bodied side with a bit of spice. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in this brew. It's a pleasure to sip on, if possible. So full of flavor and complexity that it's tough to beat.

Amazing retention with beautiful lacing that is both thick and sticky and also slides down the glass to reconnect with its brethren. Smells of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, honey, sweet bread, dark fruits, cinnamon, clove, rose petals, coriander, candy, light yeast, and slight alcohol. Tastes of candy, fruits like apple and pear, spices, a touch of citrus juice, caramel, sweet bready malts, cocoa powder, figs, plums, cherries, earthy notes, peppercorns, a touch of yeast, and a slight dash of alcohol. An amazing balance of flavors, each pronounced at first along the journey and then gently fading away, leaving only a hint of lingering taste behind. Smooth and velvety with a nice dry finish and great carbonation. Simply a fantastic beer, not my favorite beer of all-time, but definitely the best Quadrupel I've experienced and among the best beers out there.

The nose came out with dates, caramel, leafs, and strong yeast. The texture was some what like champagne. Tasted way lighter then it looked. I almost could not taste the alcohol at all. When it started to warm up I started getting a heavy tobacco taste, would have even been good with a cigar or what ever it is you put in your pipe. Also some strong licorice flavors.

I raise the glass to my nose and scents of warm red grapes, cranberry and cherry come flooding into my awareness. The sweet smell of fruit, caramel and toffee candy wraps itself so nicely around the significantly boozy brew. It pours over my lips and onto my tongue. Sudden sweetness hits me with flavours of red wine, plums, and wild berries. The sweetness is quickly followed by a refreshing dryness brought on by the high alcohol content. Both the sweet and the bitter mingle and dance on the palette in perfect unison, and linger into a long dry aftertaste that leaves me begging for more. The low carbonation takes the edge off of what might have otherwise been a sharp and bitter dryness, and makes it so very easy to drink. And then I had a second sip.","Quej","Aug 27, 2008"

4.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Westvleteren 12...the rosetta stone for many beer drinkers. This one was tasted alongside St. Bernardus 12, and Rochefort 10. Poured in to an Ommegang chalice a lovely dark rosewood color, with lighter rosy hues at the bottom of the glass, and a fluffy tannish/white heading that clings the the glass, and has great retention. Nose can only be described as extremely deep, with layers of prune, candy, licorice, caramel, more sweet dark fruit...the list goes on and on. Taste is quite breathtaking, and complex. Begins very rich and sweet, with dark fruit such as plum, prune and date. Chocolate can also be detected lingering in the background somewhere. Alcohol also lends itself perfectly to the flavors, giving it the perfect amount of richness and depth of character without overdoing it. The end of the beer is interesting, in that although there is little bitterness in initial flavor, there is some int he finish, that one might describe as spicy, and perhaps a bit earthy. Mouthfeel is the most exceptional aspect of Westy 12 in that it is just so damn smooth on the palate. It was a sort of cask conditioned beer character to it, yet it is bottled. Sometimes I think cask conditioning beer takes a bit away complexity and flavor wise, but with this one there is not much left to be desired. Drinkability is very very high, despite the high ABV, although I don't think I could bring myself to drinking more than one of these in a sitting....that might just be too decadent for me. As far as the other two beers, I am sad to say that they did not even come close. The Rochefort was a bit more robust and boozy, whereas the St. Bernardus was lighter, more carbonated, and quite a bit spicier. Ok, so final verdict: This is my second time tasting this brew, and the first time I was less than impressed. This tasting, on the other hand blew me away. I now have no problem proclaiming that this is the best Belgian Quad, and one of the best beers in the world. I suspect that this will be a permanent member of my want list for a while.

4.45,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,5,"At Gollem, Amsterdam, 12-2-07. Dark brown, beige head, lace. Looks perfect in its own chalice, very elegant. My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy. Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate. the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts I've had. No alcohol flavor. The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect. Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while. I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros. It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors. As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced. I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be too rich and alcoholic. St Bernardus is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor. Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus? No way, and I know I'll be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique.","bulletrain76","May 14, 2008"

4.75,3,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle, cap stamped with 30.08.09. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a dark murky brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel, bananas, pepper, cloves and yeast. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, with the addition of licorice, nuts, chocolate and some booziness too. It seems a different flavor comes out with each sip. Very tasty! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and slick, and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol warming does kick in after a while, but that's not a bad thing. I think this is an excellent beer. I don't think it's worth the price to buy it all the time, but it's definitely worth it to get a couple bottles just to try it because it's not easy to get.

Served at room temperature, it could have used to been cooled slightly (the bottle indicated 54-58 degrees F). Heavy mouthfeel, meant for sipping.

Poured a rich chestnut-brown w/ruby-amber edges where light permeated through. Head thin and light beige. The aroma was complex, but dominated by chocolate character and various toasted malts, with lighter scents of a bouquet of spices and light herbs, light esters, and warming alcohol. The taste was exceptional--chocolate malt, molasses and candy sugar, an exotic blend of rich spices, and a strong finish of cocoa and alcohol rounded out by bitter hops. There was also an inexplicable bite at the back of the midpalate that was actually quite pleasant, but I don't know what it was. Very light carbonation, rich body that consistently delivers throughout the palate, and harmonious balance between a very dry texture and the sweet and spice flavors forge a powerful result.","BoitSansSoif","Mar 23, 2008"

4.68,1.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Not too long ago, in my haul from CrackedKettle's online beer sales, I have a Westvleteren 12 from 1998 and the date on the cap is for the year 2001. (I am not sure if it shld be 1997 instead) So I had a contemporary Westy 12 2 days ago and I clearly recall the taste as well as the full experience and gratification level; let's see how this one does. It is interesting to note that in 1998 (when I was in middle school), Westvleteren 12 is 11 ABV as opposed to the 10.2 ABV that it is today; it was also 10.6 ABV at a certain point in time. Man this baby is crowned tight; it took some effort to get it off and immediately a vinous grassy aroma can be can be detected at the opening of the bottle; some dark fruits but not really impressive here. I poured it out into my old Abdij St Sixtus oversized wine glass and a one finger thick head developed over a dark amber brown liquid below. What surprised me was the way this head grew to a 2 finger thick head which persisted for a while. the head was creamy and bubbly but more bubbly and I prefered the creamier head on the contemporary Westvleteren. The smell was not very strong but the vinous part of it was clear; there was this light yeasty bready smell with a little bit of fruits underneath and I think I sense a dash of malts but in general the smell was not fantastic. Moving on to the taste, the nutty/almondy goodness from the contemporary Westy was still present though the intensity probably halved. Other than the nutty entry, there was a well pronounced vinous taste of aged beers that was well within expectation along with the a nice maltiness which followed behind. Sweetness was clear but it was not a "thick" sweetness like in the contemporary Westvleteren; it became a more mellow sweetness. The fruitiness was also more subtle and mellow on this one; I can raisins, grapes and some plums which were kind of buried under the malts but stil detectable along with the sweetness. The finish was a pleasant nutty/almondy dryness with nice vinous aromas, maltiness and plums on the nose. The maltiness and the fruitiness towards the finish was a very pleasant part of the taste that somewhat reminds me of the greatly aged 1985-1988 La Trappe Dubbel that I had which was so called one of the best aged beer I ever had thus far; up there with the Special 6. On the whole I still prefer the taste of the contemporary Westvleteren though I prefer this one's finish. It was clearly a very much mellowed down taste which had it's unique strengths. The after taste was flooded with malts, brown sugar sweetness and dark fruits starting with plums and moving on to raisins and grapes after a while. The mouthfeel on this was about medium bodied; clearly the aging compromises on the thickness and the creaminess as well. It was still slightly creamy to drink and the carbonation was clearly going low but still pretty sufficient. 11 ABV seems deceivingly smooth and light and I almost thought this was a 7 or 8 ABV if I did not know from the start that it is 11 ABV. Again I prefer the mouthfeel of the contemporary Westvleteren 12. Let's now break things down further, the smell was largey vinous aromas which was obviously different from the contemporary's intensely fruity and sweet smell. Taste was a classic mellowed down version which was generally not as good except for the slightly pre-finish and finish which was in a greatness realm of it's own.Mouthfeel lost thickness, richness and creaminess as well as some carbonation over time but surprisingly, the nuttiness was still there. Very nice and I can really appreciate it but I still prefer the contemporary Westy to this particular bottle of 1998 Vintage; I mean aging really produces different results... We all know that.

I've had other quadrupels before and I liked them. I'm partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that I've had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. It's because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as "easily" available as other examples of the style, I'd buy it by the case.","Bitterbill","Oct 12, 2007"

4.87,5.6,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"11.10.09 stamped on the cap. I've had these for a year or so as part of a wonderful gift from a 12 pack given to me. Poured at ~55F into my Westvleteren chalice. Strong tan head, decent retention, solid lacing. Nose has notes of rasin, figs and dates, perhaps plum. Mouthfeel is silky and spicy. Taste is similar to the nose, just more apparent in the depths of a profound flavor. This is sure making my Tuesday night something special. Truly one of the world's best offerings for a "commercial" beer, although I'm not sure this is the epitiome of a commercial offering. As far as drinkability goes, should we even discuss this? This beer is closest to the St Bernardus Abt 12, but is much cleaner, deeper and pure. Truly the best quadrupel offering by a long shot. I'd offer a longer diatribe about the complexities and beauty of this beer, but if you dont get it already, there is nothing my words can do.","lifeboyq","Oct 03, 2007"

Lacing is spotty all over the sides of the glass. Smell is so complex. Combination of yeasty goodness, dark fruits (fig, cherry, raisin, dates, plum), sweet caramel malt, sugary vanilla, thick honey, and fresh flowers. I can't think of a single beer that even compares to this one in terms of smell. Taste starts off with a bready yeast which is then bitch slapped by a whole lot of sweet goodness. Almost tastes like a caramel apple to me as lame as that sounds, but think about it when you take a sip next time. Aftertaste is a bit spicey, but perfect in the sense. Mouthfeel is full, complex, and warming with the perfect amount of carbonation. A bit of burning alcohol in the throat as it slides down, but the alcohol has to be somewhere with a 10.2% abv. beer.

Fig, caramel, raison, plumb, jam, malt, honey, tea, spices and mild alcohol. Flavors are abundant as well. It tastes of all that the smell indicates and it is an unreal flavor experience. The warming from the alcohol is the only indication that it exists. A spicy semi dry finish. The drinkability is unreal for any beer, especially for this type and abv.

4.27,-7.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Got as a gift from my best friend who ordered from BelgianShop.com. Poured from a 33cl bottle with a best by date of Oct '09 into my NBB snifter. The color was an reddish brown and had a ton of yeast bits. It had a very small beige head that quickly dissipated. No film, collar or lacing. I thought I had let it warm enough but was just getting to temp when I opened it so the initial aroma was good but not great. After it got to temp (yes I used a cooking thermometer as my wife chuckled at me - screw it, good beer deserves to be treated with respect), the aroma really developed and was exceptional. Was strong on raisins and plum with a sweetness surrounding it all. Could smell the alcohol but it wasn't overpowering so no problem. The taste was really good but didn't live up to the aroma or the hype. It was exceptionally smooth for a quad but just didn't blow me away. I enjoyed it but I've had better quads taste-wise. The mouthfeel was also really good - creamy and smooth. While not the best taste for a quad it was definitely extremely drinkable for a quad - very smooth. I'm going to have to get some more and make sure this sample was up to snuff ;-) Overall, a great beer that you definitely need to try....but it's overhyped in my opinion due to the rareness of it.

A brown body with red rimmed highlights and a decent white head of small bubbles. The smell is close to unappealing to me my friend really likes it but to me the alcohol pops out and there is a cooked raisin smell that sends this sideways. The taste is decent it has depth of flavor and the yeast adds some nice edges of phenol with lots of dried fruit and some caramel with even a touch of more mellow dark malt and then the alcohol comes through warming all it touches. Good mouthfeel full but not too dense. Something to have once in a while when you can find it but not my favorite, shrug, once again this is mostly hype.","Higravity","Jun 14, 2007"

Starts off with spiced apple juice, some sweet brown sugar flavors, dark dried fruit flavors, a little more spice and hints of lemon at the end of every few sips. More alcohol warmth than I would have liked. It overpowered some of the flavors and stood out more as the beer warmed. A very full flavored beer but not as good as I was expecting. In fact I favor several quads and trippels over this brew. It was worth the money to say you have had one, but I would never pay the high price to have this beer again.

Fruits up front, mellowing into an incredibly smooth malt, followed by nice tannins and then a sharp but mellow aftertaste. It has a nice warming alcohol finish but nothing harsh anywhere in this beer. The mouthfeel is oily and chewy, dense and spectacular. The drinkability is only limited by the availability. We bought a case of this in Belgium and went through it like shit through my dog after he's gotten into the trash. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon but this really does live up to its reputation.

The aroma is quite nice, vinous and sweet, with ripe grapes and raspberries, figs, apples, pine?, cookie batter?, and doughy yeast. It tastes of sweet and toasted, lightly smoky malts, green hops, a medium bitterness, melon, green apple, raspberry, strawberry?, a flash of banana, a light herbal quality, Belgian yeast, and very light oxidation in the form of paper. It has light, smooth carbonation on the palate, with a medium, drying body that becomes more full and leaves a medium to long finish. It is both immensely drinkable and a very nice ale, but my bottle was a bit past its prime. I would love to taste a fresh one purchased directly from the abbey - I imagine that is a divine experience. Best beer in the world? Perhaps not, but it's a beautifully crafted Trappist that is worth at least half of the hype that surrounds it.","mmmbeer","Feb 12, 2007"

It is very good, well crafted, and delicate in its approach, but it is not deserving of the incredible hype it gets. In this country, we are blessed to have a wide selection of great belgian style beers. St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Rochefort 10, Kasteel, and Gouden Carolus Grand Cru are all also excellent beers that are similar to the famous "westy", but they don't have the huge hype associated with them. This is every bit as good as those other beers, but I can't say for sure if it's "better". I'd say that it is worth all the praise for being as good as it is, but it's not worth the hype and longing for it. I can now see why the brothers decided to stop selling it here. If you can get it, try it.... but it's not worth trading your first born for. Be happy with what we have here.","phisig137","Feb 11, 2007"

No oxidative notes, or any hint of staleness/ skunkiness etc. so I am sure this beer was well kept. I just don't get what the big deal is. this is my second try from a different batch a couple years after I had my first one, and the impression it has on me is consistent. Of course I did like the mouthfeel and finish that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but these were not very enchanting or beguiling - just vaguely pleasant. I suspect people just hype it up in their minds because it is so rare, and expensive. Highly coveted due to to its scarcity.

Its a trappist that you could easily call a session beer IF you could get over the rareness and your liver can hack the alcohol % since it is hidden well from the senses after a year of aging. The young Westy 12 will make you sip it. Its invasive and still tastes great but the aged one was not asking me to use caution.

Very nice taste, more like a wine than a beer, lots of heavy fruity grape notes. Tight carbonation and dense mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the end. I could drink this all night long but, seriously, it's not that much better than Trappistes Rochefort 10. If I can get another one I'll do a blind side by side with the 10.

There are a lot of dark malty fruits (plums and raisins), Belgian yeast and bread. The taste is slightly spicy malt, fresh dark bread and a lingering warming from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with medium-low carbonation. No doubt that this is certainly a world class beer that is extremely well crafted.

Raisin, plums, and figs, a caramel breadiness as well. Taste is a mix of chocolate and more of the ripe fruity maltiness mix with belgian sugars and sugar cane flavors. There is a crisp peppery hoppiness that begins mid taste and blends with a warming alcohol and some smokiness in the finish. Medium to heavy in body. Besides the warmth in the finish, alcohol is very well balanced, peppery bitterness helps to cut the richness from the malts.

A lot of suspended yeast flecks visible as well. Heavy lacing in the oversized goblet into which this fine ale is poured. The nose is outstanding - sweet fruits, Belgian yeast, and a slight spiciness. Very inviting. The palate doesn't disappoint in the least ... sweet roasted malts, exotic fruits, and the finest Belgian yeast flavors. Starts out quite sweet, then yields to more complex fruity and spicy notes. Moutfeel is medium, with a very pleasing alcohol warmth. Finish is dry, despite the sweet beginnings. Mildly acidic, yet zero bitterness. Wow, what can I say ... it's Westy 12. You really just don't get any better than this. At the very top of my list, edged out ...maybe ... by St. Bernardus Abt 12. Maybe. Over all, though, one of the top beers in the world.

Taste was much of the same, didn't really detect any sourness that I found in the nose, also I couldn't detect the alcohol. Even with my expectations of this beer being very complex, it still caught me a bit offguard, it was very nice, nearly perfect. Medium bodied, with a light to medium amount of carbonation; it was smooth with a slightly dry finish to it. Drinkability was incredible, alcohol was not to be found and it seemed to go down just as easy as a 3.2% cask ale, I had to hold myself back from drinking this too fast. The best beer in the world?

4.14,-10.2,3,4,4,4,5,"HUGE THANKS TO DAVE AT THE PUBLIK HOUSE BROOKLINE for pulling this out of the basement and hooking me up with a huge surprise. Especially since it has been aged for 2 years. Once my heart restarted I poured this bad boy into a Westvleteren glass (also provided by Dave) and noticed that all the carbonation was gone. This was a bit of a disappointment because I remember in a fresher version I had the carbonation caused the yeast to swirl and swim around when the glass is sitting still. It was visually stunning and added to this beers mystique. The aged beer still had a fresh and balanced smell, a bit more molasses / maple syrup then I remember. The taste follows a trend I have noticed with aged Belgian darks, the flavors seem to meld and result in an overall flavor timeline similar to raisin bran. The front is sweet like a dried raisin, the middle is where the molasses and maple syrup are present, then when the hops appear they transform the flavor to a hearty, malty, grainy flavor (the bran part). Meanwhile the alcohol is hidden well, it's there if you look for it, and overall the beer is very well balanced. I have noticed that with age the flavors have toned down and blended much better (as expected). Especially the alcohol, in my previous review I mentioned that the alcohol flavor was too strong that it overpowered the rest of the beer. I rated the 8 over the 12 because of the alcohol flavor balance. So it was a pleasant surprise to see that age has solved this issue. Mouthfeel has also changed due to the lack of carbonation. I recall the fresh version evaporated on the tongue, it was epervescent, and lively. The aged version is more syrup like and smooth, which allows you to roll the beer around the tongue and really study the flavors before it evaporates. That being said, I like the fresh version better. It's more of a party in your mouth. And the drinkability I have to give a high mark because it was very smooth and balanced. The real test was that I was with a newbie to "good beer" and she probably drank more of it than I did.","danadeny","Nov 11, 2005"
4.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5," I think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America. And I seem to remember reading in one of the forums that Westvleteran 12 is bottled three years before the date on the cap. As good as this was, I would like to try a slightly fresher sample.

Decent compact light tan head which recedes fairly quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is complex and amazing dark fruit, toffee, oak (almost wine barrel), subtle spice from the alcohol. Taste is full on - all of the components identified in the aroma, but so intense. Very sweet start is balanced we superbly by the bitterness of finish and the peppery spice from the otherwise well hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is full and velvety smooth, just about perfect. I can't imagine having too many of these in a session - it would have to be the night cap, however it is almost sad to get to the bottom of the glass, so I have rated it high on that basis. Damn, only one left now :-(.","hefevice","Oct 28, 2005"

Interesting enough... but not shocking. Taste is that of rum mixed with ripe fruits, and then it dries out and leaves your palate clean. Almost too dry though to me. Mouthfeel is good, outside of the dry chalky taste that this leaves.

Blank bottle (no label), brought back directly from Belgium. Yellow cap is dated 05/04/08. Poured out to a dark brown color that became bright auburn red when held to the light. Lower carbonation, with some notes of lace in the glass. Nice 1/4 inch head was consistant through the entire glass. Aromas of fruits, buttery malts. Very sweet smelling overall. The taste, hands down, is a 5. I find this beer to be everything it is touted to be; flavors of sweet bread, smooth malts, ripe fruits and roasted elements all perfectly balanced made this brew exceptionally enjoyable. A thick, silky mouthfeel was ever present, reminding me that this brew really is quite heavenly (that's probably what the monks had in mind). Finished crisp, with some bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. The nearly 11%ABV was well concealed, a point that is well noted, as this could be very powerful in doses of more than one bottle (but really, who could honestly afford or even want to drink more than one bottle a sitting). A world class brew, and even better now that it is becoming a rarity. Highly recommended.

I'm not getting a whole lot from the smell at first, but this bottle was served a bit too cold at the Hop Leaf in Chicago. As it warms, the smell opens up, but is not as powerful as I would like. It smells very spicy and a little alcoholic - in a mellow, rum-like way. There are also some fruity tones, which take the form of apple and cherries mainly. The taste is like no other beer I have tasted. The best way I can describe it is to tell you to imagine the monks mashed up some apple pie and some pumpkin pie into a liquid and added some Captain Morgan spiced rum. That's all I need to say about that. The mouthfeel is very luxurious and silky, and this beer is thick! This really complements the dessert like flavor well. Overall, I'm very impressed, and I like this one better than the 8. I definitely couldn't drink this every day because of the sheer sinfulness of it all (sorry monks), but I couldn't get enough of it when I had it so I would rate the drinkability extremely high.","PatYoda","Sep 05, 2005"
4.88,5.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Sampled from a bottle that's been aged ~2 years. Murky reddish brown with a moderate head of very fine bubbles. Extraordinary delicate lacing in the chalice (it actually looks just like lace) that didn't budge even when the beer was agitated. Superb retention as well -- I don't think the head dissipated at all from beginning to end. Nice aroma, lots of fruity wine/vinous character along with a bit of more acidic fruit, possibly cranberry. Soft maltiness with a bit of light roast and faint hops. Mild fruit flavour throughout, malt sweetness fills out the middle and end, but stays fairly subdued. Some chocolate and roasted malt creeps in, but this is very mild. Caramel and toffee appear at the mid-point briefly. Moderate bitterness with a bit of grassiness. Complex flavour that stays balanced and round all the the way through, but keeps changing. Soft carbonation with an airy texture. Off-dry finish, a full body, and slight alcohol warmth.

4.85,5.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"01-07-06. This beer looked and smelled great as was expected making waiting to warm and drink it very difficult. It poured with some life leaving a small but fragrant head and a dark brown root beer color. This is the best beer I have ever had. It is so good that it acts like several beers. First you have the high alcohol, sweet honey, maple like a trappist or abbey ale, then you have the lasting alcohol burn of a barley wine, then you have the crisp clean thirst quenching finish that makes it thoroughly satisfying and wanting more. Silky, rich with a panoply of flavors that linger on your palate. Even with a piece of pungent English stilton, westy 10 compliments it well and cuts right through it. Get it at Jackson Wine and Spirits.","lou91","Apr 15, 2005"

4.88,5.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"A densely creamy tan head rests lazily atop a hazy, dark russett body (carefully poured from a longstanding bottle it's a clear ruby with orange highlights - but add the yeast later on!). Eventually the head receeds, but it's somehow able to hold a thin but completely solid cap throughout the entire beer. And initially, it leaves solid walls of thin lace that fade to become sheets of tiny spots towards the end of the chalice. And that's no easy feat given its 10.2% abv! The nose offers honeyish, nutty, cocoaish (Ovaltine...?), bready, and caramel drenched malt as well as a bit of hard candy and some chewy fruit (raisins, berries). It's velvety smooth across the palate with a full, dextrinous body and exceptionally fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is even more exquisite than the nose implies, and includes notes of soft anise, lemon rind, a touch of leather, some delicate bubblegum, and a mild floral character that really helps to round it out. They yeast is incredibly important as well, as it gives it depth and rounds it out; and it should be poured even with an aged bottle. Finally, one of the things that makes the Westy 12 such a stunning beer is that it's so soft and supple considering it's such a behemoth. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and when it does appear in the flavor it only helps by lending a "spicy" character. And despite the amount of character it has, it's actually not as malty as a doppelbock. It's lighter, and it finishes semi-dry with more spiciness and yeastiness than sweet malt that might build on the palate... giving it a really great drinkability. Impressive, to say the least, this is a brilliant beer because it's big enough to deliver a great richness and lots of complexity, but also incredibly well-balanced enough that it really leaves you wanting more!","NeroFiddled","Apr 10, 2005"

The nose was very fruity, with lots of sweet fig tones, and an almost appley, crisp aroma. There is a nice spiceyness as it warms as well. The flavor is awesome. Very mellow, wtih a spiceyness and an alcohol burst that play very well together. The flavor moves into the fig, and slightly bready notes, but also with a touch bitter on the finish.

This poured out a murky brown with a tall light tan head that filled the goblet. There were some floaties that could be seen occasionally and the beer coated the glass in rings of lace. The head managed to stay afloat till the end, which was impressive. Aroma is very fruity with raisins and other dark fruit. It was quite sweet and spicy as well with a touch of yeast. The taste starts of with a strong fruity sweetness before a good bit of spice comes through to even things out a bit. Earthiness is also in full swing here adding a touch of bitterness before the spicy sweet after taste. Wow there is just so much going on here I feel like I am still missing out on plenty.

I didn't care for the yeast flavor, which was quite prominent, or the muddy drone of the malt, but that could have something to do with a couple years on the brew. Maybe the brew would present itself differently when fresh. I'd hope for something a bit more toned and alert feeling. A fine belgian ale, but nothing I'd consider world class material. I'm actually surprised at how well regarded this is. Possibly something to do with it's scarcity? I don't expect I'll be paying $9 for a second bottle, nor going through the trouble to get it.

I sip it over and over and it remains a complex mystery to me. I must have more and more. It makes me hungry though I just finished lunch. I have some special Chinese duck that has been cooked with soy sauce and spices (five spice?) and they go together perfectly. Finally at the end my head is spinning with the alcohol. This would've kicked ass in the middle of my lunch. I can see why BAs love this beer. I'm glad I bought an extra bottle!","oggg","Mar 28, 2004"

Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so. By the way, this was a nice fit with the great quebeccer cheese Victor et Berthold, recommended by Simon_Patrice and provided by MartinT.

The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass.

The sour nose gives way to a very sweet taste (Belgian candi sugar), but balanced with some bready undertones. This beer could certainly get me through a fast. I'm not sure how the monks maintain their vow of silence after drinking this - all I want to do is talk about it. The body is quite light, actually, but it holds up to the ABV well and makes for a very drinkable beer. I can see how this would get better with age, as some of the residual sugars get munched on by the yeast. I think I'll have to pick up another bottle.

My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly can't get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle.

Beer in botle was mpale to dark brown with a two finger head. Flavor is of grapes, roasted caramel. A sip reveals fruitiness, followed by bitterness, alcohol taste, then fizz. Enjoying very late, 2AM, listening to some techno music. I'm enjoying this more than the Rochefort 10. A slight bit of hops bitterness in the beer which is nice along with the fruity taste.

The drinkability is a little low due to the 11%, but this really is a world-class brew!","SheepNutz","May 21, 2003"

4.73,2.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"After much contemplation on whether this beer was worth trying based on its cost alone, I decided to splurge. Abt 12 pours a deep mahogany color with a creamy, off-white head. The head retains exceptionally well. Flecks of yeast sediment abound in the dark liquid. The smell is a bit port-like, with some sweet candy present in the aroma, as well. The taste is quite strong, with notes of candy sugar, dates, dark fruit, etc. all making equal impressions. A very well-balanced brew. Almost every sip is like a unique experience. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, albeit a little less carbonated than it could be. For a beer of 10.2% abv, this one drinks dangerously easy. Although maybe not worth the price for a single bottle, this is nonetheless an excellent creation from the Westvleteren Trappist brothers. Nectar, indeed.","Jon","May 17, 2003"

4.97,7.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"The beer gods have smiled down upon this brewery. Absolutely the most satisfying beer that I have ever tasted. It pours a dark and murky brown with hints of red and an impressively large head that dies down quickly. The aroma reminded me of a barley wine with a lot of fruity scents and a hint of alcohol (I'm not a fan of Barley Wines, so I was hesitant). As I poured, the aroma strangely filled the air in the room making me aware of the aroma from about three feet away - first time for such a strong aroma. The flavor was incredibly complex. The flavor is so incredibly smooth that I was in shock (considering the strong aroma) I think I notice a hint of chocolate in the taste as well as some different fruits and a couple spices. The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely smooth and satisfying. I could drink this beer all night long - although I'd probably not last more than three because of the alcohol. Again, this is THE best beer I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of the $8+ per bottle price.","clvand0","Apr 21, 2003"

4.3,-6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I paid $11.39 for 11.2 oz of this stuff, and I have to question whether the expectation this price creates might be affecting ratings of the beer. Don't get me wrong, it's quite good. The pour is dark ruby with a thin, light tan head. Lots of sediment though, even when I tried to pour carefully. Aroma is slightly sweet, with hints of plum and a nutty character. Beer has a smooth body with a light, fruity malt flavor and what struck me as a very noticeable alcohol character. Malt takes on a slightly toasty character mid-palate, with hints of toffee, and the beer finishes with an earthy/herbal, and very well-blended hop flavor. Finish is slightly sugary, and very lightly dry. Good stuff, and well worth trying, but other examples of the style (Abbaye des Rocs comes to mind) provide a much better bang for the buck.","mzwolinski","Feb 23, 2003"

There is some major complexity in there while staying somewhat mellow all around. It's a warm kind of mellow, a fruity mellow. The alcohol is a little bit noticeable, pretty much warm really. Body is medium and there is a moderate carbonation feel. This is definitely the best Belgian ale I have had to date. I can't say it's the best beer overall, because I have so many yet to try. Anyone who is a broke college student like myself.....well you should still come up with $8 for a bottle of this. You won't regret it.","AudioGilz","Feb 18, 2003"

This ale pours with a silky, creamy beige head sitting on top of beautifil toffee brown body. Belgian lace in the glass as you drink this offering is evidence of the excellent head reteniton. The nose is very malty with hints of prunes and toffee. The taste...ahhh...the taste! The taste is robustly malty with hints of raisin, caramel, toffee and chocolate. Take your time enjoying Yellow Cap because these flavors develop as the beer warms in your hand. Overall, the taste is sweetly malty with an excellent background of clove spiciness. The warming alcohol sensation only adds to the character of this ale. The finish is dry with a pleasant caramel aftertaste. a well balanced and well crafted ale. A must add to any true beer lover's collection!","maltydog","Feb 12, 2003"
5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"This was my "Holy Grail" that I have been looking for and praise be to God that I did! When you taste something like this, you gotta feel bad for the Southern Baptist down here, becuase they either A) Can't drink alcohol or B) Can drink it, but can't tell anyone. This is proof that it is great to be a Catholic. At least something good has come from it lately. Anyways, the beer is a cloudy brown color and had a light brown head for a little bit. It's smell is that of various fruits and nuts. You can taste a hint of alcohol, but it smooths out quickly. The aftertaste is very smooth and also tastes quite fruity. I could drink this all day and night, but it's kinda on the high side for price. I guess that's the only drawback for it though. Aside from the price, all the combinations that are put into this beer, truely make this beer a heavenly experience. Praise be to God in the Highest!","JISurfer","Feb 03, 2003"

This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that disappeared quickly leaving some circular lace. An aroma of alcohol, raisins and yeast/grains. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisin with some elements of spices. The finish is creamy and a touch sweet with elements of the alcohol. A very great belgian beer, but will need to try some others to see if this is really the best out there.","Wildman","Jan 25, 2003"

Yes, it's quite pricey, but costs the same as just a fairly good bottle of wine (and it's one of the top 5 beers in the world!). Probably the best body-mouthfeel of any beer I've had. CREAMY! Smooth, deep, and complex. Fruity, perfect balance. Nothing negative to say. If I could get this close to home, I'd have it (at least) once a week. As good as it gets, beer fans!","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 21, 2003"
5,8.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Murky brown pour, lots of sediment swirling about in the glass. Thick, medium lasting tan head, huge clingy bubbles initially formed on the side of the glass, then burped their way to the top, never to be seen again. Aroma filled the room with strong apple scents, with some yeast and doughy aroma coming with a more intimate sniff. Taste is strongly doughy and apple, with hints of banana, grape, plum and strong malty sweetness in there. The banana seems to come through more as it gets warmer. Slight alcohol comes through towards the end. Mouthfeel is huge, pummeling the palate with all the different luxurious flavors, feelings, and hints of alcohol.","goz","Jan 15, 2003"

The taste reveals a very creamy medium bodied mouthfeel that consists of raisons, fruit, spices, light yeast, and alcohol. It finishes with a lightly sweet aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.

4.18,-9.3,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"This bottle gushed upon opening, and was furiously overcarbonated. Upon pouring, the brew forms an off white head that slowly settles into a tight, well retained thin layer. Muddy, murky dark brown hue, w/ flowing aggregrates of yeast liberated from the gushing. Musty yeast, and dry, bittersweet dark chocolate upfront in aroma. As the beer breathes fruity esters of both banana and raisins emerge simultaneously with deeply caramelized sugar and mellow chocolate. Hints of cardboard from oxidation unfortunately dulls the aroma a bit. Chewy, molasses - like, heavily caramelized dark candi sugar sweetness hits the tongue at first. Sweetness then becomes dark fruit like in nature and when coupled with the mellow chocolate undertone, I am left with an impression of chocolate covered dates. Banana esters then surface along with yeast must, lending a perhaps overripe banana flavor mid palate. Hop bitterness is virtually absent, leaving an overall richly sweet profile to this brew. A true dessert in a beer! Full in body, w/ a sugary, slightly syrupy viscous mouthfeel that is appropriate considering the high strength and richness. Finishes caramelly sweet, offset by dull notes of oxidation. Alcohol warmth emerges dangerously late. Although it is clear that my bottle didn't travel well, 12 is complex and robust enough to prevent the oxidation from affecting the overall aroma and rich flavor profile significantly. Delicious! I will search out another bottle for another taste.","marc77","Nov 24, 2002"

It was perfect pour into a Westvleteren goblet with the head rising to the top of the glass when I had poured all but the last ounce leaving the yeast behind. The head dissapated to about a quarter inch and lasted to the end. Its heavenly dark malty body is offset perfectly by the tannish head. Smell is somewhat weathish with a slight tinge of bananas and chocolate. Went down smooth and creamy with chocolate, caramel, and fruity flavors of bananas and dates. First few sips were somewhat crisp and dry but as you drank more, it became sweeter but not overly sweet and the fine alcohol flavors became more pronounced. Had a nice floral hop flavor and there wasn't much bitterness, just enough dryness from the hops and alcohol to balance the sweet malt. As close as you can get to perfection in the style.","Longstaff","Oct 10, 2002"
4.65,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"I didn't know what to expect with this brew after receiving it (thanks to a trade from a gentleman in NYC!) and reading many reviews of it. I think it was a little too cold when I tried it, as the taste got noticeably better as I moved through the glass. Now about the taste, I honestly don't think my palate is refined enough to describe accurately what is going on here. This will be one I have to try again around beer #250 I think. There is a trail mix aroma, and the flavor is hard to pin down. If they captured this flavor in a cereal I would get up earlier every day, hints of berries, grain, nuts, chocolate. Like Willy Wonka invented it, I tasted something different with every sip. I think this would be a perfect drink with some Godiva chocolate covered strawberries. Superb!","Dogbrick","Sep 10, 2002"

Caramel, spicy yeast and wood come out first. As it warms, more coffeeish flavor and some lactic characteristics. The beer manages to be slightly creamy and bright on the palate at the same time.
