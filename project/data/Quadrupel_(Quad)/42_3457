I did it very slowly, but there was still significant head to it. I let it sit for a bit, and once it settled, the head was a beautiful brownish-white layer of fluff. It retained itself throughout the drink, and provided the ale a nice creamy element. Lacing was superb. The ale is smooth, with the cherries providing a very nice touch. This is overall a tremendous beer, and I think absolutely a top-ten quad.","BuccoFan","Mar 21, 2015"

4.14,-0.2,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,3.5,"Pours a hazy, dark amber body with a big creamy head. Smells of dark fruits like cherries, dates, and raisins, and at almost 10% alcohol it makes an appearance aswell. Taste is essentially the same as the smell would imply, very sweet, fruity and the alcohol packs a punch but is still enjoyable. Has a very thick mouth feel, it kinda leaves a film coating your mouth, and it has fairly low carbonation. Overall pretty good beer, but is a bit on the pricy side.","Joe_Howard","Mar 01, 2015"

I really like the way this one looks and smells. The aroma gives you no illusions - it says ""I am a yeasty, fruity, boozy beast of a beer"". There is plenty of raisin and black cherry in both the nose and the taste. The finish is somewhat tart, which is a bit unexpected.

I suppose it'd get a full 5 out of me if its finish was just a tad smoother, because I really can't come up with anything else legitimate as a complaint.","bmeehan","Dec 15, 2014"

The quad style is a monster of a beer style built on the legendary brewing traditions of the trappists. generally, though not as much so in the wake of the later phase of this our american craft beer revolution, very few brewers even attempt to brew quadrupels and even fewer do so with true success. the great ones generally come from the trappists of belgium. three philosophers then, may very well be an adequate or to be more descriptive not a bad beer but once again that's the largest part of the problem, Making a 'passable' quad, either in the sense that it's just not bad for beer or even in the sense that it's just not bad for a quad and even tastes like one, is a lot like duplicating a famous painting, sure you have the skill, but if it is not better than the original or at least equally good yet different, who gives a shit. the equally good yet different here was supposed to be the kriek, and if it truly worked in this beer, I'd be inclined to give it high praise indeed all of the praise it deserves. So while points are most assuredly deserved here for craft and a willingness to experiment, what we are left with is a briny, adequate beer with all of the worst characteristics of the beer it blends in, with none of the things that render those bad characteristics complementary.","JackRWatkins","Nov 04, 2014"

Slight cooked caramel notes along with some hints of light toasted notes. Boozy notes present off the grape flavor. Soft earthy, hoppy bitterness balances the malt sweetness nicely. Second time I've had this brew in 10 days, it just keeps getting better. A nice end of summer, start of fall beer. I am glad this is s year around brew.","mac31","Oct 12, 2014"

A bit on the pricey side, as I shelled out $9.50 for the bottle, and the bar I know of with this bad boy on tap charges $6.50 for an eight ounce glass, it's worth springing for when I'm looking for an excellent brew.","higherbrow","Sep 21, 2014"

The flavor is much more tart than I anticipated and the kriek blend really is present here.  More dark fruit, plums, grapes and moderately sweet molasses.  This is a great blend, enjoying the sour element to it.  The only negative for me is the over carbonation.  Great beer, just less fizz.","nmann08","Sep 09, 2014"

Right now the brew stands out like a high alcohol Dubbel or BSDA. For a Quad it falls short. This bottle lacks complexity and depth. The flavors seem to be muddled together so nothing really stands out and says excellence. Like I said before its a fresher review but it still feels like I’m drinking a higher gravity version of their Abbey Dubbel. Still this is worth a shot.","Shroud0fdoom","Aug 19, 2014"

The taste adds another dimension to the nose, with some Belgian spice, brown sugar and more dried fruit. Full bodied, smooth, fairly low carbonation, but easy drinking with a definite alcohol presence. Overall, a solid quad.","FFreak","Aug 11, 2014"

Some fig/pear fruits, but caramel malts and Belgian yeast spices are more pronounced. This also has a green hop flavor that I find a bit unusual for the style. It provides a little sharpness, and I think this could be smoother. Overall, very solid but it didn't meet my fairly high expectations.","HuskyHawk","Aug 09, 2014"

The taste was really nice with a lot of great sweet flavors off the front with the cherries as well as banana and clove, but with a sweet burn from the alcohol at the end.

The added cherry dimension from the addition of the Liefmans Kriek really makes this beer interesting. The cherry element brings it all together, without being too overpowering. I'm not a big cherry person, but the amount of cherry flavor is PERFECT. I'm probably crazy, but this beer kinda reminds me of red licorice. Extremely drinkable, with alcohol that is masked insanely well. I could drink this all day!","TheItalianStallion","Aug 02, 2014"

Reminds me of amaretto, while my friends said it was like so co. Nice to drink of the bat, but gets heavy later on. I could see myself drinking this with a dessert, which I rarely do.","avwrite","Jul 28, 2014"

Aggressive pour yielded a thick, foamy head that dissipated slowly. Fruity, spicy aroma with a very dark, reddish color. Taste is very complex that leaves a tingly mouthfeel. Good carbonation without a serious bite. These guys specialize in Belgian ales and it shows. Who knew Americans from New York could pull it off so well? According to the label they're part of the Duvel family of beers... Ah, it makes sense now. If you like the abbey ale style as I do, you'll love the Ommegang offerings.

4.51,8.7,4,4.25,4.75,4,4.75,"Pours out to a thick buff head and deep amber color. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is sour cherries with a bit of aged hops, sugar, spice and bubblegum. Flavor is complex and deceptively easy to drink. There is a good dose of sweet and sour, berries, bubble gum and other fruity-spicy esters. Mouthfeel is medium and sugary. Overall, an exceptionally tasty and enjoyable beverage.","EagleTalon","Feb 04, 2014"

There are remarkable aspects of taste and other levels of enjoyment in this beer that would not be found in the individual beers of which it consists. I would recommend it, but with a warning: its high ABV will knock you on your nates. Great and unique Belgian Quad.","BeerDocT","Jan 01, 2014"

Looks like murky, hazy root beer with a little cream mixed into it, with ample brown foam. Aroma a sweet and heady mixture of rich toffee, floral tobacco, vanilla bourbon, and brown spices. Very sweet smell but there's a little bitter grain to provide balance. Palate is all rich sweet malts, dark fruits, and spice, minimal toast or roast. Milk chocolate, dates, nutmeg and clove, vanilla cream, a little banana, and licorice toffee with a semi-chewy, buttery mouthfeel. A small amount of ale brewed with Belgian kriek cherries imparts a subtle red fruit acidity from start to finish. Low to moderate carbonation. A very nice quad with a lot of complexity and character. I found the aroma to be sweeter than the palate.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 08, 2013"

Scents of bubblegum, Belgian yeast spiciness, candi sugar sweetness, cherry, caramel, sweet spices, raisins, dark fruit, prunes and a hint of alcohol. A very rich, complex aroma, fitting a Belgian Quad. Flavor begins with Belgian yeast spiciness, tart cherry and candi sugar, sustaining spice and tart cherry throughout the sip. The middle moves into raisin, plum, sweet spices, peppery spiciness in the background, some apricot pit-like bitterness, dark fruit and dark chocolate. There is faint alcohol towards the finish, which also has a yeasty, spicy and dark fruit quality. Very rich, sweet, spicy and complex. A well done mix of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with low carbonation and semi-drying finish. Very good for sipping, though almost smooth enough to gulp. Excellent feel. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Quad. The usual flavors are there and the addition of cherries during fermentation add a nice tartness in the back of the aroma and flavor that is quite pleasant. Its a very good beer that is rich, warming and complex. This is one to go out for.","Auraan","Dec 02, 2013"

4.02,-3.1,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a Quad, even though it's a blend of a Quad and a Kriek I thought this beer was much more Quad like with Kriek aspects showing up in the background and blending well with the Quad Like flavors. I would be able to tell there was at least some cherries in this beer by the aroma, but I don't think I could tell that this was blended with a Kriek by the flavors alone. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was slightly warming, but I thought it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't rule out drinking a couple of these if I was in the mood for this kind of beer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, I'm not sure how this beer would be if the Kriek was the dominant aspect, but I don't think I would enjoy as much since I liked the Quad flavors taking the lead with the Kriek aspects showing up in the background. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but I do think that cherries could have shown up just a little more in the taste. I would buy this beer again, it was a little expensive, but I could see myself buying a bottle or two once in a while and I would recommend this to anyone who likes Quads. All in all I was happy with this beer, I enjoyed it just the way it was and I now see why this beer is as popular as it is, I don't know what took me so long to try it, but I'm glad I did. Good job guys, this is a nice take on a Quard and I think blending is something that is very under utilized by American Brewery's. Keep up the good work guys, so far this is my Favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang and even through this was a blend I still think it's one of better Quads I have tried.","StoutHunter","Sep 07, 2013"

It's the mouthfeel that really makes that happen for me--as a contrast to the syrupy cordial character that can make these beers intriguing, but tiring to try to consume. I'd drink this one too long for my health, especially on a chilly evening.","1sophrosyne1","Aug 28, 2013"
4.14,-0.2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"O: Overall a very nice creation. For the ethanol content- as well as the true richness of its flavor components, this is an incredibly drinkable beer, and surprisingly somewhat refreshing as well. Not insanely filling, as many beers with similar flavor profiles can be - and also does not scream winter warming seasonal brew. This can shine on its own, but wonderfully also accompany food as well. Definitely worth a try!! I will absolutely have this again.","Birdmarg741","Aug 28, 2013"

The cherry from the Kriek is exquisitely stated. Little bit of a dry finish to remind you that the hops are in there. This beer is truly ""cordial.""

Smell is Belgian yeast, smooth maltiness, some chocolate, and a hint of fruits, mostly dark, although there's some cherry. Taste is just as complex as the nose; sweet malt up front, with the standard Belgian yeast flavor hiding in the wings; it fades into sweet chocolate and a bit of sweet dark fruit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is the first Belgian beer I've been able to stomach, let alone enjoy, and I love this stuff.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 02, 2013"

It was a steak meal. It's amazing how complex and satisfying this beer is. The 2% cherry blends so well that it gives you the best of a red wine and a strong beer. This is now my favorite beer for a red meat meal.

This mellows into a very smooth bready malt taste that gradually caresses the tongue until finishing with a subdued Belgian yeast note with some of the downplayed banana mentioned earlier. Carbonation is medium to low, though the high point of the mouthfeel is the gradual way in which the brew continually reveals itself, as opposed to the typically discrete tripartite view of ""front, middle, finish"". Overall, a very nice quad and a great go-to beer if you want something a little sweeter than St. Bernardus Abt 12 for a readily accessible quad.","Tomhet","Feb 06, 2013"

It's a testament to this beer that the teeth behind it didn't come out from the onset. Even though it's crafted here in the U.S.A., you wouldn't know it unless the bottle was in front of you. This was solid from start to finish and worth getting your hands on if you have two hours on your hands to enjoy all that this has to offer.","JerzDevl2000","Jan 31, 2013"

Very dense and creamy in appearance, a swirl produces some nice lacing and retention as well as some alcohol legs. Aroma of cherries initially, then comes a wave of rich malts, caramel, dark candied fruits, toffee, brown sugar and spicy yeast. A touch of warming alcohol on the finish. Smooth and rich. Taste is ripe cherries, caramelized dark fruits, oak, brown sugar, and a yeasty finish. Incredibly delicious and smooth with all the right Quad notes. The finish has a light lactic twang, almost in the form of oxidation, but its very pleasant and complimentary. Mouth feel is creamy and medium bodied with the alcohol very well hidden. Overall this is hands down the best American made quad I have personally tired. It really does compete with the big Belgian quads.","SeamusDoyle","Jan 14, 2013"

This one is on the sweeter side due to the cherry blend. But don't mistake this for a cherry beer because it is merely an ingredient and not the focus. The cherry flavor accentuates the natural dried fruit flavors of the quad. The result is an extraordinarily well balanced strongly flavored beer that is not overly hoppy or malty beer and no hint of an aftertaste. Just beautiful.","Kevin73","Dec 09, 2012"

Three Philosophers is unbelievably unique with its complexity yet remaining wise with its tasty character. It's a true work of class from a brewery who doesn't pretend to give you Belgian style ales for the fact that they do give you Belgian ales and quality. I'm definitely putting one of these in the cellar as I know for certain it will sit nicely as time passes on. However I will buy a few more to enjoy now. 3 philosophers is one of the greatest quads ever brewed and luckily the majority of us can grab a bottle of this.","BradtheGreat7","Dec 01, 2012"

The first scents of both banana and with a nutty subaroma make this one intriguing. Upon further review as I enjoy this beer, it does hang in to a nice flavor, well worth giving a try. I have developed a big soft spot for quads anyway, so anytime I try one this accomplished and up front I just relax, enjoy and don't overanalyze. The Liefmans Kreik is right there and adds a bit of mystery to the overall finish, Enjoy this one with a friend, it's special, different and I'll comment later on it's aging properties.","JimTeal","Nov 29, 2012"

Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, chocolate, biscuit, cherry, molasses, earth, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, pepper, earth, toast, molasses, cherry, toffee, chocolate, herbal, and yeast spices. Lightly tart earthiness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, toast, cherry, pepper, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; with a nice balance of maltiness/yeast spiciness. No cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Quad! Great flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable.","superspak","Oct 07, 2012"

3.94,-5.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.25,4,"A good beer, but could use a little more complexity. Pours a deep red color with a fluffy white head. Not much detectable aroma, but some slight cherry on the nose. Heavy cherry flavor, but not overly sweet, which is well done. Nothing really stands out here but the cherry and it is somewhat one-dimensional. No spice or yeast as I would expect from the style. Excellent dark red color and perfect mouthfeel. Slight alcohol warmth. Good, but won't go out of my way for it. Doesn't fit the build of a quad that I expect, but a very good beer. Dial down the cherry, please.","BMMillsy","Oct 02, 2012"

The nose speaks of a huge beer with a strong malty backbone with bits of dark fruit and slight burning of alcohol. The flavor follows suit with a very strong malty-alcohol flavor with a backdrop of cherry sweetness and tartness that finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a minimal yet creamy carbonation and as previously stated has a very dry finish. Overall another great beer by Ommegang, I will intentionally go out of my way for anything they brew.","gmfessen","Sep 29, 2012"

I was skeptical to buy it at first because of the blend, but the Kriek seems to be only a slight addition of it, and it truly does balance the beer out; it mellows out the booziness of the beer that can sometimes mask the complexity that quads should (and mostly do) have. If you see this beer, pick it up. Even if you don't usually like the style, this one might surprise you.","Mgm54","Sep 16, 2012"

I pick up the smell of alcohol, cherry, and sweet malts. Breadiness is a bit more prominent in the mouth that it was in the nose. The cherries also come through in the flavor pretty well and I do taste the alcohol. The beer is also a bit tart, which is expected since this is a blend of kriek and a Belgian quadruple. The body is full with strong carbonation. The alcohol has a nice warming feeling in the back of the mouth. It's a very pleasant sipper. This is an excellent beer.

Looks great with a big tan head with medium lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance is the most impressive of this beer. The nose is cherry syrup and it just eats up everything else. The yeast in the background, the malt, all are eaten alive by the cherry on this nose. I just couldn’t get past it. The cherry eases up on the first taste. There is lots of fruit ester, phenols, and of course, cherry. It’s very fizzy, and very big on the palate and finishes quite dry. Maybe some time in the cellar would improve this beer by mellowing out that cherry, but as it was, it just wasn't for me.","estlinska","Jun 18, 2012"

Good retention and lacing. A lot of yeast particles though, even after proper handling and aging in the cellar. The nose is fruity sweet with cherry as well as hints of toffee, caramel malts, and plum character. The flavor follows the nose with caramel malty sweetness that doesn't display the cherry flavor as indicated with the nose. More fig. Alcohol warmth is noticeable. Hints of banana from the yeast. Full bodied and well carbonated but unremarkable. Overall, this is very average in my opinion. Nothing really remarkable to review and at $10 I can find better Quads.","hopfacebrew","May 21, 2012"

It's not a bad beer, but it's too sugary for me to really enjoy it. It doesn't help that I've recently had some great Quads.","angrybabboon","May 14, 2012"

The flavor is fairly sweet, with prominent cherry juice. Yeast takes a backseat to the sweet cherry flavor. Booze emerges more as I progress through the bottle. Overall, a good beer and one I would have again. That said, this is best only occasionally and in small doses. Cherry flavor becomes a bit cloying midway through. Interesting and worth a try.","Huhzubendah","Feb 27, 2012"

Lots of floaties, opaque deep reddish brown, an ugly beer. Nice bready aroma. I also detect bubblegum, raisin, clove and brown sugar. Reminds be alot of a dubbel I just brewed. The cherry comes through nicely in the flavor but doesn't steel the show. Malty, brown sugar, and cooked fruity sweetness. Lots of yeast charecter in the taste.

Flavor has some sweetness, sugar and dark fruits, cut very nicely with a little tartness from the cherries, not sour though. Very lively mouth feel from the carbonation, medium bodied. I wasn't sure what I would think of this, as quad's can often be a little too sweet for me, but the presence of the cherries is a great addition and really cuts into the sweetness so it never becomes too overbearing for me.

Estery smell with some dark fruit aromas. Taste is medium bodied and super complex. It takes a couple of sips and some real patience to even dissect them all. Prunes, grapes, chocolate, coffee, cherry.. all blended together in a hearty tasty brew. Finishes super smooth a tinge of alcohol. A great sipping and night cap beer, will definitely try it again in the future, worthy getting for sure.","oriolesfan4","Jan 09, 2012"

I have tried my hardest to describe them, since they are so different than the typical American Style beer; although, this is brewed in America, this has a genuine Belgian taste.","9InchNails","Dec 29, 2011"

The feel is medium with tons of carbonation which give it a tingling creamy feeling.

This actually has a better head and lacing than the previous mentioned beers, the coloring is closer, maybe a little bit more ale-ish, clearer than the those two.

A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit and sweet cherry in the aftertaste. Very easy to get lost in this one, sweet cherry makes it not as abrasive as some quads.","OWSLEY069","Oct 18, 2011"
4.12,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This pours a hazy copper color with a very small quick fading head and plenty of carbonation left in the aged bottle. Smells of plums, malts, raisins, and sugared molasses. Strong smelling beer. Taste is very nice up front with a somewhat alcoholic finish. Lots of dark berries and plums on the palate with a nice malt backbone. Slow drinking beer but very good tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is a great quad. Aged very nicely but think it could go a few more years to mellow out further.","abrand","Oct 18, 2011"
4.17,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A strong example of an American-brewed Belgian-Style quad-in fact, this does a decent job of standing up to its Belgian counterparts, and I can't think of another American brewer that does it better, at least not as part of their standard line-up.

3.86,-7,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a pint glass (sorry, didn't have a clean chalice). The pour was dark amber, almost red with a creamy, tan-colored two-finger head. Lacing was thick and clingy. The nose was leaning heavily to the malt side with some phenol notes detectable. The taste included some subdued clove with a touch of cherry. Not malty at all as I would have anticipated from the smell. I didn't detect any alcohol in the taste, either. It was medium bodied with higher than average carbonation. Overall, not as much punch as I had expected from a quad, but not bad.","maleman","Oct 05, 2011"

It looks like a hearty reddish brown, with noticeable yeast and large bubbles of carbonation. The nose is complex, and changes as the beer the warms. It is sweet and spicy, figs and nutmeg, with the slightest bit of caramel. The alcohol and bitterness is up front followed by a balanced spiciness. Definitely some ying and yang, going on here. Good beer, will drink a few this winter.","aquaderek","Oct 04, 2011"

It does not overwhelm your senses, and pack quite a punch. If you are not careful (or if you like it that much...) it can get you pretty tipsy by itself.

4.03,-2.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: A very enjoyable and unique version of the style with the addition of the kriek.

4.77,14.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The taste is excellent, this bottle progressed very well. The sweet fruit flavors, especially cherry, are still dominant, but lacking their sharp edge. The dark fruits and chocolate get their chance to shine on the finish. There's a nice backing provided by the yeast. The alcohol sometimes present in fresher bottles has now completely mellowed, this is now a super-easy drinker. The mouthfeel is solid, it's lightly carbonated and goes down very smoothly. The drinkability? Off-the-charts. This brew just goes down so easily, any hint of alcohol this beer presented is completely gone, making this one very dangerous.

Taste leads with the banana and bubblegum, but not as strong as the nose would dictate, quite malty sweet with notes of brown sugar and carmel and fresh yeasty bread, light peppery spice, watery fruits such as plum, moderately bitter finnish underneath the sweetness.

I've been trying my share of quadrupels from Belgian while over here and it's nice to see that we have some superior Belgian style to look forward to when I return home in 2013. Pours a dark brownish red into my Affligem chalice. Mild head, certainly nothing too crazy and some mild lacing. Didn't check the glass for wetness so maybe I detracted from the head others write about or maybe the cork got beat up on its journey?! Smell is what I like about belgian quads - brown sugar figs apricot and plums I suppose. The alcohol is prevalent in both smell and taste. Tastes great- some of the belgian yeast, alcohol is prevalent, dark fruits, and a tad sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and warming (alcohol). Overall, I would try again and recommend to friends. Recommended for promotion and retention.","jhtipton","Apr 01, 2011"

Head is dense light brown foam, with moderate clinging lace. Color is a 27 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is crisp, and has aromas of chocolate, honey, fudge, roasted coffee, apricot, and pepper. Taste is intense, with flavors of caramel, molasses, green tea, licorice, pepper, and chives. The flavor is remarkable and wonderful blend of melon, green tea, clover, watermelon rind, licorice, coco, rye, and overcooked lamb. Mouthfeel is a great experience of creamy and prickly flow over tongue and soft palate.

The flavor is complex: cherry, biscuit, apricot, raisin and ripe fruit in the backend, a hint of of toffee? The finish is bold and lingers for a bit, and maybe there was just a hint of strawberry?

Taste is comprised of the dark fruit from the smell, with some raisin. The cherries make a subtle appearance, and they complement the taste very well.

When held to the light it is deeply red and lacing is minimal. Cherries and currants are apparent in the nose with the aroma of yeast on the back end. First sip begins tart but drops to a sweetness. Overall the taste finishes dry with some heat on the back end probably due to the 9.5% alcohol. Yeast makes the texture that much better and the tart dryness blends well with the malt.

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured from 750ml bottle into heavy chalice glass. Pours a deep brown with garnet tints and a super tight beige head. Aroma is loaded with fruity esters that fill the room before the first sniffs even transpire. Plum, prune, dates, raisin, caramel, toasty sweet malt, molasses, brown sugar and light fruity notes that seem to proliferate with the accompanying of some mild alcoholic warming notes. Fruity esters that showed up in the aroma make a similar impression in terms of the light fruit flavor profile. Dark fruits, however, take the day with nearly every facet making its respective way in the swirling dark sugar torrent that is so prevalent. Dark syrup like sugars are complemented nicely by a wholly evident alcohol note that warms the nasals but doesn't detract from the experience. Palate is effervescent with lots of bubbly prickling amongst a high viscosity torrent. Mouthfeel is thick and quite rich- even chewy with warming booze and an ever so slight roasty dryness. This is only very subtle, though, for the overall theme of the finish strays away from attenuation and presents itself with a sticky smacking fullness.

I usually prefer the taste of bottle-conditioned beers being served from the bottle, but this seemed quite a bit more appealing to me on tap. I'll give the bottle a re-review some day. The draft serving lacked the carbonation and alcohol burn that turned me off from the bottled serving and seemed maltier which I enjoyed. It seemed also to have lost the slight cherry taste it had from the bottle, but this could be due to the bar serving it too cold. I tried to let it warm up but had a hard time resisting.

The off white head is monstrous, filling top half of the glass. Retention is great, and so is lacing, even for a style where I expect a bit of each. I took 3 Philosophers out of the fridge and served immediately, and cold the kriek comes through very strongly, cherry and earthy notes. It takes a long time to open up and let the caramel, plum, and fig notes really shine through as well. The taste rounded into shape much sooner, and Ommegang really did nail the blend of quad and kriek. Sour cherry is a slight, but very welcome addition to the standard quad flavors. The only thing holding it back is some alcohol on the close that passes from a pleasant warming to a bit of harsh heat. The mouthfeel is superb, a rich and full body that stops short of stout like viscosity. The carbonation seems muted at first, but by the time it hits the back of my tongue it's exploded, refreshing my palate and highlighting some of the otherwise more background notes (specifically some of the spicy yeast phenols). The aforementioned slight booziness hurts the drinkability some, but other than that it's a great beer, and the cherry kriek blend helps distinguish it from most of the rest of the quads.","axeman9182","Dec 23, 2010"

This is a truly well-balanced beer. The alcohol is there (and it packs a punch), but the drink managed to stay smooth and not too sweet. The cherry lambic does add a bit to the sweetness, but when later revisited discovered the tartness it brings to the table. This beer will warm you up.

The taste begins with the wheat, burnt this time, then moves into a solid helping of slightly medicinal cherry. If it weren't for that bit o' cough medicine, this would have been great.

The taste is really nice. There is the bready, banana yeast flavors that would be expected in a Belgian style. The mouthfeel is pretty darn smooth no harshness or bitterness from the alcohol like you would expect. It's pretty drinkable and an overall solid brew.

I've not tried a fresh bottle yet, but that will definitely be something I pick up on my next trip to total wines. Mf is pleasant.

The flavor and aroma are sophisticated and complex and lead into a delicate finish.

3.55,-14.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Three Philosophers is artfully crafted blending rich malt with flavorful accents such as chocolate and cherries. For me it tasted like a chocolate covered cherry with liquor infused into it, which I do not find very appetizing but I can appreciate the complexity and subtleties of this Belgium style brew. I feel that it had great length from start to finish and the taste lingered long after my last sip. The color is a deep red with a nice rich head. With a slightly aggressive pour, the nose opens up and the aromas are exactly as they taste. The texture is very smooth, slightly thick and easy to drink, perhaps comparable to Guinness from tap but much larger in complexity and body. I believe that it would pair nicely with fruit or chocolate as an after dinner drink.","BarleyBoz","May 29, 2010"

The flavor is more of the same with notes of dried cherries, Belgian yeast, and grapes. The flavor is not overly sweet with the big cherry presence, though, and it has a bit of tartness to contrast the sweetness.

Flavors of sweet caramel and even a light chocolate note show through and interweave with the raisin/cherry fruitiness.

A deep carmel aroma with cherries and light alcohol. Taste is a bigger version of the nose. Big caramel malt backbone supports a unique take on a quad. Kriek lambic notes fuse with the hops and create a one of a kind finish and balance. Multifaceted layers of flavor including some belgian spice notes. Some alcohol in the finish gives a wine like quality that is gently pushed away by the cherries and lambic tartness. An earthy, clean dryness in the finish as well. Malt lingers with light Begian spiciness. Fell is full and velvety a creamy carbonation is the ""Cherry on Top"".

4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I was lucky enough to find a bottle of the cave aged version of this beer from 2006 at a local store where nobody seems to buy craft beer. Color is a dark ruby, and comes with a quick to fade white head. Nose is wonderfully fruity, with the cherries really shining. At the same time the booze comes in with some chocolate, caramel, and brandy notes, and really makes for a great smelling brew. Taste is really full of fruit and dark malt goodness. You can tell that the age on this beer has mellowed some of the flavors in a good way. Body is full, and although you can taste the alcohol, it is really tame, and in the end adds depth to the whole experience. This beer reminds me a little bit of Brandy Angel's Share from Lost Abbey. I could sip this beer all day every day. I have to admit that I rarely go for this beer; instead usually opting for Hennepin or Ommegang. I really wish they would release the cave aged beers more, as I think I can tell a difference. All in all this is a sensational brew that has multiple layers of complexity.

I can't say I've ever had a quad with so many lambic elements, but it's a good uniqueness, and the fruit is prominent in the brew, without being saccharine, or overtaking all the other elements.

Better than most US attempts at the style I´ve tried but still not reaching the source of original inspiration. On the other hand the type of quality offered by Ommegang at the range of prices compared to the imports is tremendous so they have a totally deserved spot in cellars across the US, and in that context I am sure I´ll be revisiting sometimes in the future.","Daniellobo","Oct 13, 2009"

Closer inspection reveals some diacetyls, faint hops and a note of distant caramel. Taste isn't quite as complex, but big and bold just the same with a graininess up front followed by ripened dark fruit (cherries and plums) some sour fruit, a welcomed hop hit, some sweet malts and spice.

The taste is a strong malt backbone with black cherries overriding the malt at the tail end. There is also an alcohol taste from middle to end, there is a good deal of bitterness that starts at the beginning and is present throughout. The mouthfeel is a little slick and oily, with a low to moderate carbonation, not as high as i would have thought.

No hop bitterness at all (but why would you expect any?). Mouth is full-bodied and pleasant. Crisp carbonation. Not too heavy really..

At home I drink this beer in my favorite snifter since that glass opens the smell nicely bringing out the fruit tones and earthiness of the beer. The color is a dark caramel with a white head that pours nicely from the bottle. The head does tend to fade quickly with no lacing which leads the drinker to think there will be no body but the mouth feel is big and full while not being over powering.

There is a red wine like after taste that doesn't linger. The flavors are clean and to the point with a bigh show of cherry. The 9.8 ABV is definately there but blends well. Though the lacing is faint it sticks with the brew down to the final sip. there is a good amount of carbonation in this beer, you tell at a glance but the bubbly look doesn't convey exactly in the mouthfeel.

Nice in that while it has a strong malt presence, it isn't overbearingly sweet. Smooth if not overly deep, or creamy, or alluring. I just find the depth and flavor a little shallow. A rush of dark fruit at the end provides a slightly harsh (or a little bittersweet) ending. I much prefer this to other similar belgian cherry-inspired beers, like Mad Elf.

Full-bodied if not outright heavy, plops onto the tongue with all its weight. The sweetness of the cherry, raspberry, plum fruit not to be denied here either, even slightly cloaks the ginger, clove spice, licorice, brown sugar and honey. Syrupy texture has it clinging hard to the mouth pores, lack of lift makes it hard to get a clear impression of the malts, never mind the hops. Average carbonation.

Enjoyably so. A well balanced, continually interesting flavor that opens up more and more as time goes on. The body is pleasingly full, smooth and and well-rounded.

It tastes just like it smells, sweet and malty, not as sweet as St. B's or Rochefort, which, to this reviewer, is a positive (StB and Roche are fine). Upon tasting, it starts off with a maltly flavor and full bodied mouthfeel, immediately becomes delicately sweet, very cider-like--fruity, apples come to mind, then finishes subtley with a twangy sweetness on the palate. The bottle does contain sediment, so the last pour is cloudy, but the flavor and body are not affected. I drank it out of a crystal goblet and, later, a pint glass, preferred drinking it from the pint. What I write next is probably a heresy, but I made a batch of beer using that ""cheesy"" beer making kit--""senor cerveza"" Recipe: 1 can r*d ale and m*llow a*ber, 1 pk of b**ster, 2 cups honey and 4 wks fermenting and 2 wks conditioning in bottles, 7.8 abv--and it had a similar smell, taste, appearance, and mouthfeel as 3P's Quad.

Complexity gets a little higher, flavors become less muddled, when the beer gets a chance to warm up and breathe. Maltier, warm alcoholic heat keeps the back of the throat feeling like its wrapped in blankets.

(Time delay edit) I just remembered that I had a Specialty's Direct thick rich semi-sweet chocolate chip cookie. It pairs quite well with the chocolate. It brings out more of the fruitiness of the yeast rather than the cherry. I imagine the beer would go well with good rich food, maybe a braised pork tenderloin or something.

This was the first Belgian Quad that I've tried and could not really distinguish it from many of the Strong Belgian Dark Ales that I enjoy. Cherry is apparent in the taste, but not as strong as in the aroma, and this is a good thing.

The mouthfeel and drinkability derive from the beer's fruit component, though allows for a bitterness rarely matched with fruity beers.

Other dark, sweet and sour fruits hit my nose as well, along with a definite funk and outdoors-like character. The taste is also remarkable, but I was expecting a little more sour kick. There is definite sour cherry upfront while the beer is in the mouth. Dark fruits come through midway and wood and earth-like flavors appear at the end.

The first taste is a mix of alchohol and cherries, followed by a mixed bag of fruit. This is a full bodied beer that needs to be sipped, not quaffed.

A nice rich complex flavor consisting of malts, brown sugar with a sweet and sour alcoholic rush. Subtle hints of cherry. Bottle states that this is ""98% Ale with 2% Ale with cherries added"" so I was concerned about a dominant cherry flavor. That was not the case as it blended in quite well. The beer is more enjoyable the more you get through the bottle. A sour presence constantly lingers. Even at 3/4 through the beer there is still a thin frothy lacing present on top.

The aromas are chock full of malty sweetness, cherries and raisins can be detected along with caramel and other sweet malts. The aroma alone is enough to satisfy.

Taste is very nice, Raisins, plumbs and pears make an appearance with the roasted malt flavor and some back end spice. The cherry flavor is there as well. Mouth feel is thick but well carbinated.

Throughout the rest, you get fruit teasings (not necessarily the 2% added cherries though?) This finishes strong; and as usual, you get more alcohol towards the end. The best part about this brew is how well the mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. The aftertaste keeps you wanting more-even more than the taste itself!

Yeasty nose... nice malt, dark fruits... sweet. Taste is quite complex... malty.. (Ommegang beers all share a similar malt backbone... kinda a brewery signature I suppose). Cherries stand out more and more the deeper you get into the glass. The alcohol warms you up, and the fruits really start to show their face. 9.8% abv is noticeable, but adds character.

Quite a bit of lace formed each time the glass was tilted. The smell was floral sweet with a ton of dark fruit character showing through as well. The taste wavered between sweet and dry and finished spicy. The blended nature of the beer was apparent in a mellow smoothness that muted some of the edgier and earthier tones found typically in Quadrupels. The alcohol was more of a factor in the taste than I initially expected it to be, and the warmth was quite noticeable after each sip. This was a well built Quadrupel with a lot of good facets.

Taste is really rather dry, muddy and bland actually with alcohol definitely noticeable but i've had stronger alcohol tastes in less alcoholic beers. Cherry isn't really noticeable, but maybe comes through it the tartness rather than big cherry flavor. Reminds me of a cross between beer and wine. Like a carbonated wine almost. This isn't awful, but I don't see it being anybody's dream beer as its story and creation indicates.

I love quadrupels and I really like lambics. This....is just not for me. The mouthfeel is silky and carbonated, right on the money.

Good lacing adherence during the sampling. Color was a deep garnet red/brown color. Very subtle smell of dark fruit similar to a red wine bouquet. Complex flavor that was difficult to describe but pleasant to imbibe; flavors of dark fruit (plums, cherries, grapes). Nice tart mouthfeel with a pleasant bite to the tongue. Finished with a subtle feeling of alcohol astringency and mild carbonation. Very pleasant and not as strong as I anticipated from a 9+% abv.","Jwale73","Oct 31, 2007"
3.68,-11.3,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured out a nice copper color with a godo head and a bit of lacing. Has a vaguely sweet smell with a hint of alcohol, which goes for the malty and alcholol taste, as well. Goes down fairly smoothly, with just a bit of roughness at the end. This would have been a great beer if the abv wasn't quite so noticable. While it's interesting to have a 9+% beer, if I wanted that much of the taste, I'd have scotch. Still worth a try, though, it's still quite good.","JamesS","Oct 30, 2007"

Flavor is ripe with raisins, sour cherries, something floral, coffee, chocolate, and musty yeast. This brew has a good balance of spicy, sweet and sour. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying, carbonation is light and prickly. Finish is dry, weak and short with a bit of alcohol showing.

4.18,0.7,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured slowly into a kwak glass (the kind that you need some wooden holder). The carbonation is so very powerful I let it sit for a few minutes...also so that the yeast in the remaining beer can settle as well since the first pour was stopped early from such a big head. The retention in the head is very very good. The color ranges from dark ruby brown to light brown at the neck of the glass. The smell is Belgian candy sugar and spices. There is also some clove in the smell. The taste is lighter than expected. The sweetness is not as much as you'd think, the clove stands out in the aftertaste with spices in the background. The taste is nice, but the aftertaste is bitter with sweetness still on your mind. Overall I would have another one, just not very soon.","Erdinger2003","Oct 06, 2007"

It is soda-ish, and I appreciated its effervescent qualities, as the alcohol content is so high. A quad would be a beer I can't handle well, so I had about two shot glasses worth.

Very complex and difficult to pick out individual scents. Dark fruits, cherries, fresh cut wood, yeast and caramel meld nicely. The taste was surprising and almost offensive at first. But it finishes cleanly and I find myself quickly going back for more. There's so much going on with this beer that I'm having a hard time dissecting it. The alcohol is hiding backstage waiting for the final act to reveal itself. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, yet there is plenty of prickly carbonation. This is a good beer that I will surely revisit. I'll likely grab another bottle or two and forget about them for a few years to see what happens.","jakon","Sep 25, 2007"

Nose os crazy strong toffee malt, lots of spiciness too, and light dried fruit. Taste is similar, lots of toffee malt, some alcohol presence (although it's fairly well covered for a near-10% ABV). Cotton candy, dried fruit, and a touch of licorice. A light hit of hops at the back end. Body is full and creamy with fairly low carbonation, although it works here nicely. I liked this one a lot, although it's not quite in the same league as some of the really mind-blowing quads out there.

The alcohol is a little distracting for me in that it is so strong that it has a tendency to muddle all of the flavors a bit. I have had the beer fresh, and I seem to recall that it was easier to drink. I am assuming that was from the oxidation, and is not a vintage thing.

3.28,-21,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Palate is a rather ordinary sour lambic, perhaps sour brown like New Belgium's la folie, but with a modest amount of the cherry kriek in the mix. Honestly I can't figure out why this beer exists, and why it is reviewed so highly. It tastes neither like a traditional quad, nor like a good fruit lambic. It's almost as if it was a mediocre quad so they had to add the cherry lambic to offset the poor results. Nothing extraordinary here other than the cool name and bottle.","yemenmocha","Aug 30, 2007"

Poured a slightly cloudy reddish brown with little head (there was more of a head when I poured more after the bottle had warmed a little). Smells absolutely incredible, hard to describe other than distinctly Belgian with a hint of cherries. Taste reminds me of Chimay Blue plus the sour taste of the cherry lambic. Very good beer, but found myself wishing I had someone to share the bottle with. Aside from the drinkability, a top notch beer!","srroos","Aug 29, 2007"

3.8,-8.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a very fine quadrupel. Mine was from a smaller bottle with no cork, so I'm wondering if the company may have downsized the quantity from the 750 ml. It pours a very dark brown, hazy color with a reasonable head, decent retention and some lacing. You can almost see the candied sugars in the glass. This is a medium to full bodied beer and has the carbonation to go along with it. This is a Belgian style for sure. The smell is sweet malts, some raisin, some caramel, maybe other fruits as it warms a bit. The color seems to mellow as it warms as well. The taste is strong malts, warming alcohol tones, some raisin, cherries, and some caramels. There were some pepperish snaps, but these seem to fade as the beer mellows. The down side is that the alcohol is too prevalent. The after taste is mild, and the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It is just the overly strong alcohol tastes that compromise this beer for me.

The aroma was pretty floral, maybe lillies, mild with a hint of cherries. The initial flavor was of brown sugar and malt with a little sour yeast that grades quickly into a long-lived complex aftertaste that picks up the cherry lambic. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with creamy texture and very active carbonation. Overall, this is a solid beer and is not overly sweet despite the lambic addition. This makes a great dessert beer that stands up well on its own. We tried it with dark chocolate truffles toward the end of the glass, and it seemed a little overpowered. Maybe try something a little more delicate like vanilla creme brulee. You could also try with roast pork for a main course beer.","walshclimb","Aug 14, 2007"

My friend turned me on to this company and wow is this beer amazing. No, its not the every day drinking beer but rather something you can sit down and enjoy a bottle of with a friend, it also goes great with a cigar as the potent aroma and taste still make their way through the smoke to your taste buds.

The taste has a big cherry hit due to the added lambic, the sweetness is offset with a nice roasted malt backbone, has hints of tobacco. Maybe just a hair too sweet. This is a very flavorful brew.

Interesting how the cherries are light in the scent, but strong and dark in the taste. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy, chewy enough to bite down into.

Mild hops come through in the finish, along with a yeasty sourness that evens out the sweetness.

Taste was absolutely wonderful. The vibrant cherry flavor was accented with a complex malt flavor and very subtle hops that were almost unnoticeable, but they did their job.

Overall smells like a delicious apple crumble or apple pie. Tastes of the apple, with tangy cherry in the center and aftertaste. I really enjoy the addition of the cherry lambic to the quadrupel - it complements the apple and sugar flavors without overpowering them. Good thickness to the mouthfeel - like a thick cider.

The aroma is very rich and complex, earthy and vinous and mainly sour cherries. The taste is sweet, rich malt, caramel, prunes and yeast, reminiscent of Gulden Drak, but with a very pleasant tartness from the Cherry lambic and brett. that really takes it to the next level, before fading to a boozy and slightly dry finish. The 3 Philosophers had a moderate mouthfeel and a great flavor profile that takes a while to unlock, but is a bit rich to drink more then a bottle or too of...that said, it is choice for enjoying with a robust cigar, such as a Romeo y Julieta Reserva Real # 2 Belicoso, which is suburb.","ccrida","Feb 02, 2007"

3.97,-4.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"In October 2005 I purchased a couple mixed cases of 750 ml bottles of each of Ommegang's four ""main"" beers when I camped overnight at the Waffles and Puppets event. Most of those beers have since been drunk or given as gifts, but of those that remain there are three specimens of the 2005 bottling of Three Philosophers ""Belgian Style Blend."" This bottle has sat quietly with its Ommegang brethren since then, and now seems like a good time for a review. The bottle was opened at cellar temperature. A careful pour into a Three Philosophers bulb yields a slightly murky burnt-orange glowing brew with a steady, densely-bubbled light brown head. Slightly boozy, almost medicinal aromas of prunes and cherry juice, along with brown sugar and faint canned-pineapple notes. Very noticeable cherry flavor rings the edges of the first sip, surrounding a caramel-drizzled spiced poundcake center. Spicy alcohol prickliness subsides toward the finish. Clean, fruity (plums, cherries) flavors in the aftertaste. Slightly tart, almost vinous, but mostly a caramel-fruit melange. Vaguely funky ""farmhouse"" yeasty esters in the burps. Moderate alcohol slickness, medium body. The year and change this has spent sitting tight in the cellar has brought the Lindemans Kriek out from the shadows -- or maybe I've just had a difficult time discerning it in the past. As of now, this is drinking fine, but I've got two left to try for the next couple of years, and it should be interesting to see what additional time will do to this beer.","orfeu","Dec 19, 2006"

Poured it into my chimay chalice, careful not to disturb the sediment. Nice off white tan head with good retention. The body is a dark coffee brown with deep reddish highlights. It smells of Belgian yeast, sweet and charred malt, mild hints of coffee and caramel with a little subtle, but pleasing natural funk of lambic. The taste is crisp and malty, some definite sweetness coupled with a mild yet well balance hint of hoppy bitterness and the cherry lambic funk is definitely there yet not over pouring in the least. If one dislikes lambics they need not worry this is not a 100 funk its more just the right amount for a great all round flavor. This beer is a really fun modified quad. Honestly the flavor of cherry lambic and charred malt, with caramel, coffee and chocolate notes makes for a great beer.

It's actual taste is not as fruity as I expected, especially since I still cringe at the thought of sickly-sweet lambic style, and I figured it would be a moderated version of that. Really, it's more of a sour, compromised version of a fairly good belgian ale. It's pretty good and definitely worth trying and enjoying, but it wouldn't be a priority for my personal future purchasing schedule.

The taste too improved as the beer (and I) warmed. That malty-cherry-spicy blend faded nicely into a slightly warm and nicely lingering finish. The mouthfeel is intriguingly soft and full with a lasting crispness. While I will stick with some of Ommegang's other offerings, this one is worth another go.

The taste is sweet, with huge malts, prune, cassis, tobacco and a late sting of fruit. The finish is long, warming and sweet.

Aromas of alcohol, grapes, and leather are apparent, but the alcohol definitely dominates. The taste is a bit more 'porter' or 'imperial stout' like than is typical for this style. An interesting combination of fruit, candy sugar, and drying bitterness. In my mouth, this beer feels like liquid leather in that it is overly viscous and sticky. It felt like I was drinking something I shouldn't be; motor oil, discharged broth from a fermentation tank, etc. But that is the beauty of this beer, it combines two styles so well that is absolutely unique. I enjoyed the taste of this beer very much and was interested in more even with the high ABV.","jaluria","Dec 08, 2005"

Color of slightly less than opaque cola with visible carbonation and generous sediment suspended throughout the glass. This I have no issue with. Agitation aerates the surface resulting in good creamy foam on top and coats the glass nicely. The Nose offers some chocolate, Belgian yeast and cardamom. The spicy notes are held in slight abatement giving this brew a classy character rather than being totally off the wall flamboyant. The flavor is rich and buttery, malty and reminiscent of lightly roasted hazelnut. The flavors linger for a minute + with essence of sticky molasses, ground cherry, (aka Physalis pruinosa) and lightly roasted nuts and a pleasant saltiness on the lips. Creamy and expansive in the mouth, this is another fine product from Ommegang. Finishes just short of dry with drinkability being surprisingly great. Very well done!!","barknee","Dec 02, 2005"

Burnt chocolate malt and dark fruit aromas, followed by a light floral hops in the back. A toasty malt-driven palate; baker's chocolate upfront, with phenolic date and raisin tartness pulling through that balances the noble hop bitterness. Rich flavor cloaks the high alcohol, and mild german hops in the aftertaste dry the mouthfeel leaving a semi-residual finish. tasted very-well attentuated and rich with complexity. Fine, medium carbonation and a thick, chewy body enhance the mouthfeel. This pairs exceptionally well with chocolate-covered cherries, especially when aged for a few years.

Taste begins with sweet plumy fruit and candied sugar (with just a hint of vanilla) followed by bready yeasts and a bit of liquorish. Some herbal notes follow as well as warming alcohol with a touch of rum-soaked raisins. Quite smooth despite the level of alcohol.

Smells a lot like cherry cough syrup, more alcohol and a little more natural kind of cherry, but still similar. Some other sweet notes of candi sugar, prunes, and figs, and a hint of spices. Taste is more of the same sweetness, with all the fruitiness coming in again, especially the cherry, over a sort of caramelly malt base. Some cinammon spiciness comes into play towards the end. Alcohol is noticeable from the first sip, but it blends in pretty well with the flavors, and doesn't ever get to the point where it takes away from the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a smooth somewhat slick coating feel. Overall this is another good beer from Ommegang, a good example of the style, but a little too strong and in your face to drink more than 1 or 2.","cubedbee","Sep 19, 2005"

This is my 2nd try, and better than I remembered it to be. I really don't know if I'll be buying more anytime soon, but it's worth a try none the less...especially if you like cherry flavor.

Aromas of cherry, roasted elements, and some brown sugar was noted. Taste was heavy and filling, with complex flavors abound. Flavors of cherry, dark chocolate, some weak malt, and a hint of sour tartness on the finish. The higher alcohol level is well masked, but still present. Very heavy mouthfeel, like having cherry extract moshing around in your mouth. I'm not sure if I would have this again, it was like having fermented cherry juice. Not many of the a-typical quadrupel characteristics were here. I really don't know if i'm going to finish this...","Frozensoul327","Sep 11, 2005"

Standard Belgian dark fruits - plums, dates, figs, a funky/sour cherry kick along with some vinuous notes, strong malts, strong alcohol, and some faint chocolate/toffee. This is some heady stuff. Almost too complex. So many flavors and so much alcohol make this a seriously big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and bubbly. I enjoyed this quite a bit, but still had a hard time finishing the 750.

On one hand, I like the idea of a flavored quad, and cherry provides a good foil to the otherwise bruising power of such a malty monster. I don't really like the idea that this is essentially a quadruple and cherry flavoring black-and-tan. I'd rather see a direct product, with the fruit right in the fermenter. I also think the sweetness of the cherry lambic used (Lindemans?) detracts from the flavor. If anything, this quad needed a sour cherry. In any case, the deep brown body with ruby edges is appealing. Low carbonation. Smells of sweet figs, dates, and chocolate covered cherries. Main flavors are the same, with an unexpected viscosity (somewhat thin) and some transparent alcohol slickness. I think this could be tinkered with and improved upon. As it stands, I think it's just an average offering. Bottled versions may have more promise.","99bottles","Sep 04, 2005"

The aroma was quite complex. the sour kriek lambic was in the forfront, but the bunt-ish brown sugar was quite evident. They all played well together in the flavor of the beer also. In the palate, you get the soft and smooth sensaton of a Belgian ale, with the sour astrinency of the lambic. This was the 2005 vintage. I hope I can come across a few more bottles of this down the line.","tjthresh","Aug 31, 2005"

A nearly overwhelming variety of scents greets the nose, with a malty sweetness above all others. Has wine-like aromas at times. It is extremely smooth going down, no bitterness or bite to speak of and the alcoholic nature of this beer is masked by its complicated taste. I wasn't able to find many cherry lambic flavors in the blend, the quadrupel flavor seemed to overpower most of it, but occasionally I found a hint of oak or cherry in the background.

In the begining I sort of felt attacked by the alcohol, the warmth actually hit me right there at the begining but as you experience it you are enveloped in amazingness. The cherry flavor seemed to fade into an excellent balance with the other flavors. The mouthfeel is moderate with a light carbonation that results in a really smooth ride. This is so damn tasty and complex (yet at the same time so drinkable and smooth) that my review does not do it justice, read the others.

Also noticed a slight medicinal smell, but did not think it was very overpowering or consuming. Taste was a bit rough, and would probably be better with a year of aging. Cherry taste was very noticeable and was quite interesting since it did not have the lambic-like tartness. I would purchase this one and probably let it age a year or two to smooth out some of the rough edges and let some of the malt characters come though.

About three quarters of the way through this and I can't decide whether it tastes more like cherries or grapes. Either way it is incredibly fruity and almost wine-like. Oh yeah... did I mention there is some alcohol in this. The mouthfeel is very good, lots of body but still light, kinda like eating fruity marshmallows.

The brew had a nice sized tan head that had smaller bubbles and stuck around for the entire brew leaving a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aromas form this brew are of dark fruit, mostly cherries but can also plums and raisins I think. Also pick up a caramel like malt aromas along with a nice alcohol scent that seems to compliment the brew very well. This is a very smooth brew with a creamy like body. I can taste a lot of malt that lends it to having a sweet taste that does along with the slight cherry flavors. Also seems to have a nut like taste to it along with a slight hop that accent this brew really well. Has a alcohol flavor that gets more pronounced as the brew warms.

Although I really like little fruity notes that I get in the finer dark ales and quads, etc... So call me a hypocrite. But I really really liked this beer and found it to be not too overly cherryish as I thought it would be. First of all, really nice red amber color with a big poofy tan head, leaving some intricate lacing. Smell and taste are both a world of complexity. The main event really is the dark cherry flavor but there's plenty of other fruity spicy notes in there. Nutmeg, dates, figs, the list goes on and on. Really smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very warming at almost 10%. I had this beer immediately following an Allagash Four and I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would compared to Allagash, one of my favorite breweries. But this beer is definately unique and can hold it's own. I'll probably go back to this one and I encourage anyone who is skeptical about fruit to check it out because it's really not overdone.

Taste is rich, malty, slightly sweet up front with a slightly sour finish with some definite warming from the alcohol present. Ripe fruits and sugars are present. This is one of the best US produced Belgian style beers I've had, and I'd put it up there with other Belgian quads and strong ales out there. Pretty drinkable, even though it has a high ABV and the alcohol is definitely apparent. Also, don't be shy about cellaring this one...

The strong cherry aroma hit me even as I poured, overwhelming my ability to detect much else. Strong taste of cocoa, cherries, and raisins. I agree with the reviewers who mention plumbs, too. There's a complicated dance of bitter and sweet. I expected the lambic would lighten it, but no, it's a full bodied heavy weight. Creamy, has a really nice feel.

This brew was harsh alcohol, very little fruit, some slight cherry notes like cough syrup. Rather than the best of a Belgian dark and cherry lambic, this tastes as if I'm getting the nearly 10% abv with some cherry flavoring. It is certainly sippable, but it didn't meet my expectations.

Pours a little lighter than I would've expected. A milk chocolate brown sits underneath a 1 finger creamy head with a slightly tanned twinge. Aroma is very rich with plum and roasty malt sweetness and a subtle earthy hint. Taste is very different from other quads that I've enjoyed. The usual dark fruit/malty goodness is there, but man does that kriek jump out at the finish. That cherry bite really balances out the earthy character of the brew. There's a slight acidity that comes along with the cherry that really shocks me and makes this beer so much more refreshing than a normal quad (Very dangerous at almost 10%). I don't remember Lindemans having this kind of slightly acidic punch. A slight bit of wood is present in the aftertaste. Unique beer which i can see being polarizing. Really really really well done.

I know it wasnt hops though) hit my senses as soon as I started to take a sip. Followed by a slight ever-so taste of caramel, and then cedar. I dont really know how to describe it other than cedar.

Smooth with some pleasant sweetness and good fruity flavors (cherries, plums and others which I can't pin down). The cherry which was so overpowering in the aroma is much more subdued in making itself known in flavor. As the beer warms, a bit of alcohol taste comes forward, although not excessive to the point of detracting from the broader, nicely complex flavor.

Smellwise...I'm picking up dark cherries, oak, leather, alcohol, and yeast. Not overly aromatic, but nice and vinous. Dark, rummy fruits kick off the palate. Cherries, raisins, maybe plums in there. Slightly sweet, but slightly tart. Alcohol hits mid-palate, along with some leather, and a little oak. Bitterness backs its way in, but its a very herbal, tangy, and almost medicinal bitterness. Yeast is notieceable throughout. The finish has a tart apple taste to it. Warming. Full-bodied, but with a rather fluffy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little on the ""too much"" side.

Came in a large 750 ml brown bottle, caged and corked, 2004 edition. Safety comes first with Ommegang, as on the back label they recommend pointing the cork away from any friends while opening. Poured into my Leffe chalice, it's a deep murky/cloudy mahogany body, capped with a massive fluffy beige head with intense retention. Serious lacing as well. The nose is heavenly, sweet toffee malt, rum raisins and figs, dark grape and cherry, bubblegum and cotton candy. Underlying vinuous alcohol throughout on the flavour, it starts out with purple grapes and cherry skins, along with alcohol soaked dark dried fruits like raisin, dates, figs and currents, a sweeter rummy toffee towards the middle with notes of earth and wood, a dry twig-like roasted espresso finish, with light sour cherry tones. I'm practically chewing on this flavour on the aftertaste, so much to register. The mouthfeel is creamy, velvety and somewhat effervescent, not as thick and chewy as the flavour would have one expect at first. My first foray into the quadrupel style, an interesting and successful blend, I shall willingly grab more when the opportunity arises (damn suitcase space and customs duty!).

Alcohol was not obtrusive and overall this blend of lambic and ale made for a warming and unique drinking experience. Mouthfeel was smooth and medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation.

There are also trace amounts of alcohol and spice in the nose as well. The taste starts of with the sweet caramelized malts with fruits such as apples and cherries coming through.

Almond butter, nutmeg, jerky, sticky, moist, brown and black breads and pepper assert their presence as aromas too. On the palate it burns slightly, but ultimately in service to a leathery circus of flavors including soot, toffee-stewed, overripe apricots, plums and cherries. There is a distinct, severely burned sugar component to this beer, reminiscent of authentic creme brulee or black-topped croissant crusts.

In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a very dark brownish ruby red color, and was topped by a thick and fine light brown head. The nose was rich and enveloping, letting loose a barage of cherry-caramel-plantain maltiness with amazing underlying subtleties: tingly tartness, musty chocolate, and luscious esters. The taste presented a dark and bitter cherry-laced buttery maltiness with a warming alcoholic kick and accents of musty banana and freshly turned earth. This finished with a dark cherry skin-chocolate bitterness with lingering earthy cherry notes. The flavors of this beer reached their highest complexity and intensity near room temperature. The body was appropriately full for the flavors and character of the beer. The evident alcohol decreased the drinkability considerably, but then again this was meant as a sipper I would guess.

Also a nice healthy dose of yeast coating the bottom of the bottle. The smell was exceptional. The usual banana like Belgian yeast fragrance but accompanied by the cherry scents of the lambic. The smell reminded me almost of the cherry soaked cigars that my uncles and cousins used to make when I was a kid. Also some solvent odors that hint of the 9.8 abv. The taste was excellent as well. Sweet, banana like, and earthy hints of cherry. Very complex. I did not experience the medicinal taste that others have spoken of. In fact the warmer it got the less solvent like it became. As it warmed the cherry flavors became more apparent almost like cherry soaked cedar wood. The mouthfeel was rich and thick. Very filling.

Flavor was earthy, with a prominent bitter cherry flavor, like cherry pits. I don't think I've ever said this about a beer before, but this could have benefited from just a touch of sweetness to better develop the cherry flavor.

I used a nice glass, like the one on the bottle and filled it half with beer, dark cherry and opaque in color. The other half was full of thick tan frothy head. The head did die down rather quickly. I have this around for about an hour now, and it really hasn't improved that much. The smell is of sweet cherry cough syrup or drops (remember Ludens?). What strikes me with the taste is that the cherry syrup is on one side of the room, and the ale is on the other. I am actually shocked that the flavors are not that well blended. It's almost as if someone took one beer and poured it into another. The flavors do seem to blend more the longer it warms, but the aftertaste is bitter, and not bitter in a pleasant hoppy way (medicine theme comes to mind again). I still have one bottle of this, anyone want it?","PatandDavid","Mar 27, 2004"

It pours a glowing red with a foamy head that lingers, leaving little mounds of bubbles all over the top of the beer. The cherry smell is very subtle at the start but becomes more pronounced after sitting a while. It tastes nice but never seems to go quite where it seems it should. The cherry is just hiding in the background and never makes a full appearance. It's tantalizing in its tartness but just remains tantalizing. All in all, it's an interesting and enjoyable beer; it's just a bit disappointing after the wait.","mickeymac","Mar 21, 2004"

This Quad poured a cloudy reddish brown with a head that settled down to a thin tan layer just like others in the style.Underneath the bready malt aroma lies subtle notes of cherries giving this a fantastic malty fruitiness that is a delight to the nose. One of the best aromas I can remember at the moment. The body is soft and full with a crisp carbonation that dances on the tongue. The flavor has everything you'd expect in the style. Fruit, malt, yeast and an asortment of spices that all add up to a complex and completely satisfying ale. Overall I found this ale an exceptional example of fine craft brewing that I highly recommend giving a try.","BierReise","Mar 08, 2004"

Now I know this is made with cherry lambic and I can find the cherry aspect to it, but I'm not confident I would've without searching it. On the other hand, there's a definite peachy profile into this, together with bready yeast and maple. The body is outstanding, better than any ABT from belgium I've had, decadent creaminess and perfectly mouth-filling. Finish is chocolatey and malty. A fine-tuned desert beer, a most excellent rendition by Ommegang, who would have thought a New York State brewer could make a beer to match the monks' legendary big guns. 2 thumbs up Martin!","Rastacouere","Mar 07, 2004"

Mouthfeel is very good for this style with alcohol and carbonation standing out. It's a very good beer when you are in a sipping mood or with a meal.

After an initial snap of ethanol, the aroma settles into a balanced, subtle combination of cocoa dusted prune, underripe cherry and banana esters. Becomes more herbaceous as it breathes, with oily hints of myrrh and trace coriander surfacing. In flavor, toffeeish dark candi sugar notes upfront yields to a melange of raisin, semi sweet chocolate and buttery oak hints. Suspended yeast makes its presence known in a complementary, gentle, underbaked bread and must undertone. Ethanol character is subdued, and is discernible by a subtle black pepper and licorice presence. Once sufficient CO2 is released from solution, the mouthfeel is revealed to be firmly dextrinous and agreeably creamy. A slight nutty, brittle like note emerges late concomitantly with a soft, pleasant, dilute bourbon like alcohol presence. Finishes protracted and complex with lingering notes of buttery, cocoa tinged toffee coupled with a prune like acidity. A highly enjoyable, continously morphing brew. After all is said and done, it's reminescent of a English barleywine / Dark Strong hybrid. Surprisingly shy in outright yeast ester presence. I am quite curious as to how this compares to a ""fresh"" 2003 version. I noticed very little kriek character in flavor.","marc77","Feb 14, 2004"

Dark red, slightly purple in color with a thick, dark tan head. Bubbles race to the top. Explosive in appearance. Smell is mellow and very vinous. I can't get much more than that. Taste is intensely complex. Obviously cherries are present and are the first thing that comes to my mind while drinking this beer. Many more vinous, dark fruits are there such as plums, grapes, figs, red apples, and maybe even pears. The malt backbone though is caramel, a sweet caramel taste and that holds everything together. Hop taste is a little on the weak side but it is very floral when it comes out. Yeast is strong and a little overbearing at times. Very dry finish. Alcohol flavor is also very noticeable and sometimes too much. Super thick in body. Maximum effervescence. This beer is definitely is sipper and finishing 750ml will take awhile. However the flavors are amazingly complex and they fit together very well. A unique and intriging brew.","granger10","Feb 08, 2004"

Perhaps a bit of acidity & a bit of Brettanomyces character would be wonderful (I know this is a ridiculous request as these things are not too controllable, but De Dolle gets some of this right, at least sometimes).

Aroma is intriguing, with a spicy background of clove and coriander, and various fruits up front. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, not much carbonation. Taste is smooth, with a caramel flavored background that reminds me of chocolate covered cherries. Although this is blended with Lindemann's Kriek, I taste a lot more fruits than cherries. Plums, apricots, raisins, and prunes, stand out more than cherries. I really can't taste the Kriek at all, but this one has an abundance of fruitiness. Not a lot of hops here, but I love the flavors.

As it warms up I notice some malt flavors and the bitter finish is more pronounced. I notice the alcohol towards the finish. This beer is not as full bodied as I had expected, nor as complex. I was hoping for more complexity and perhaps that sugary, caramel charcter I've found in a St. Bernadus Abt 12, which also could be considered a quadrupel.

Sweet caramel malt, jarred cherries, orange zest and brandied raisins are all quite strong tasting. Peppery spices, cloves, lemon, rum and a bit of astringent camphor enter the mix. The hops are present but almost completely nondescript due to the overwhelmingly power of the Lambic, sweet malt and alcohol.

Pleasantly bitter without the sometimes cloying malt sweetness sometimes associated with this style of ale.

The bubbles stream up from the side of the glass, reminiscent of champagne, and the minute specks of sediment float in stasis. The smell is very fruity, with cherry, apple, and fig immediately evident. The fruity smell is underscored by the smell of alcohol which is a bit overbearing. The flavor of fruit is mirrored from the smell, but it is more mellow, beneath layers of toasted malt, hops and the everpresent alcohol.

When cold, it's a bit thin and bitter, but when it warmed up, it became much more complex. Nicely spicy/yeasty and a really full cherry nose. Tartness from the kriek lambic it was mixed with was mild and only came through when warmed to the point where it should have been served. Easily drinkable and quite tasty.","aracauna","Dec 22, 2003"
4.7,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Backwash: A more fair comparison will have to come when the WL has more age, but for now I’ll have to go with the “original.” A very impressive beer that vaults to the top of my list, and a great value as well. I hope the WL improves to this level, because I'd love to have it regularly. I also tried an “old” 3P after trying a Terrible, and this blew it away. Although similar in style, 3P was much more complex (even the WL), with much better integration of alcohol. Perhaps the Terrible will improve with age, but for now, it pales in comparison.","Dantes","Dec 21, 2003"
4.55,9.6,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow - if you're sitting here reading reviews, you're not out buying Three Philosophers, which is what anyone who appreciates good beer should be doing. It most strongly reminds me of port with its rich, mellowing, dark flavor. The addition of Lindemans' Kriek adds another level of complexity to an already tasty quadrupel - yielding dark cherry and green apple flavors among others. As the bottle indicates, it should be served slightly chilled. The alcohol is well hidden in the mix, and as a drink at winter time there's little that can beat it.","stingo","Dec 20, 2003"
4.5,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Complex and deep, but nonetheless and pleasure to drink. The alcohol presence is most difficult to detect, while its fruity and vinous characteristics at this point in its life keep in all in check. One of Ommegang's finest creations, this should continue to mature and develop as both time and production of this beer increases. Great stuff.","Jon","Dec 18, 2003"
4.42,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I think you probably have to drink an entire 750 to truly appreciate this beer. The foremost quality of Three Philosophers can best be described as tart and dry. I never realized that this beer included a few shots of cherry lambic, but thank goodness it does, for this is definitely what I'd consider a quadrupel golden boy. The label says that it ""inspires your mind"" and it really does... quite the vehicle for a fantastic voyage.","86MonteSS","Dec 16, 2003"
4.8,15.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Now cherry aromas are nice and amber color is good, but what gets me about this beer is the taste. I have loved this medium body beer since the first time I've tried it. It's one of the few beers my wife, who is not a beer lover, said that she would be able to drink a whole glass of. I love the way the malt flavor mingles with chocolate and licorace overtones. It is such a beautiful, well crafted beer, I figured that it should be the first beer I rate.","Brewfan","Dec 16, 2003"

4.15,0,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Sampled during the Three Philosophers release party at the Blue Tusk. Small, solid, tan head left a small amount of lacing. Dark burgundy colored liquid lets just enough light through to glow. The aroma is rich with hints of dark ripe plums and cherries along with some acohol, and a banana mellowness. Smooth malty taste with a pinch of dark frout and spices. Mouthfeel is bullay and alcoholic. The dry aftertaste leaves you with a warm stomach. Overall impression is of a young and alcoholic beer. Supposedly some will be sent to the Howe Caverns for aging in the next few months.","HappyHourHero","Dec 09, 2003"
4.35,4.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours a deep cherry red in color. A thick, tight slightly off white (with a red tint) head sits on top my glass. Aromas are of cherry, oak, and yeast. Hints of the Lambic are present through this brew. Flavor is a rush of different things. Malt sweetness then an aged wood/oak tones, musty yeast with a tart cherry finish in the end. At no time could you notice the 9.8 that this brew has. It has a smooth creamy mouthfeel and is enjoyable to drink on a cold winter's night. Another outstanding brew from Ommegang.","Stubbie1","Dec 07, 2003"

4.89,17.8,4,5,5,4.5,5,"This beer poured a dark ruby/mahogany color that was cloudy in appearance. The head that was produced was minimal and short lived, just a thin covering that was tan/beige colored. No lace. The aromas were intense and bold! Smells of bourbon, port wine, wooden aging barrels, big dark fruits (raisins, plums, black cherries), sweet dark caramel malts, and alcohol. After I took my first of many whiffs I hoped that the flavors would and had to be as good as the nose. And they absolutely were. Tastes of rich dark sweet malts, dark fruits, fruits macerated in alcohol, port wine and the barrels that they were aged in, caramel, spice (hints), alcohol and a wisp of granny smith apple tartness at the end. Aftertaste was filled with port wine and fruit. Heavy bodied, and thick. Big complex flavors that are rich and heavenly and the warmth from the alcohol were truly inviting. Wow what a beer truly amazing how all the flavors compliment each other so well. Glad I had the chance to experience it, several times in one day.","Jarod","Sep 09, 2003"

The sweet smell of mixed fruit but predominantly raisons and light alcohol notes make up the aroma of this brew. A repeat in the taste of what made up the aroma along with a chocolate covered raison being the dominant flavor along with a light bitter and again alcohol notes. This light bodied brew is just a tad under hopped IMO, but it does go down surprisingly easy. Another solid beer from this brewery. Thanks once again for the chance to experience this McCall!

4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"After having visited the brewery and actually reading the essay that was the inspiration for this beer I was ready to get the taste poetry in motion as it were. The philosopher poured a deep, foggy mahogony with a tan/yellow head which dissapeared quicker than most Belgians I have tried. The lace was real clingy and looked good on the cup. Several strong sweet aromas came out almost immediatly. There were cherry, raisen and maple which abounded in the nose. The taste was distinct with some notes of bannana mixed with honey, figs, pears and cloves. They tour guide at the brewery said Ommegang uses none of the spices that it adds to its other beers. I sm still a tad sceptical, but if it is true then this is truly a triumph of a beer.","GreatPondBrewer","May 01, 2003"

Sweet strong sour plum taste with banana chips and a citrus bite in the finish. Fuller mouth. A very complex beer with lots of stuff going on in there. The plum and banana chip taste really swirls in there. It's bold sweetness and tastes make this a sippin' brew that should improve with maturity.","frank4sail","Apr 16, 2003"
4.19,1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I bought this a year ago. It's been aging in the cellar, and I thought it was time to give the beer a try. Very dark brown color with moderate carbonation. The head is a tan color, but is very short-lived. I love the aroma: very strong fruit overtones....raisins, plums, apple. Intensely fruity and sweet smell, with a lot of alcohol as well. Taste is very malty with a jagged graininess. Peppery and fruity. Alcohol warming is predominant. Medium body, and very drinkable. I admit that I had higher hopes, but this is still a very nice beer.","Suds","Mar 29, 2003"
4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark amber and mostly cloudy. Head dissipated fairly quickly; this beer has very little carbonation by design. Smelled and tasted of all the fruits mentioned on the label, particularly raisins and apricots. The sweetness is much more prominent than the alcohol, which you can definitely feel coursing through your veins after a full glass. This is a very good strong beer thats surprisingly drinkable.","Marty","Mar 27, 2003"
4.27,2.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750ml bottle, corked and caged. A carefull pour renders a clear, reddish-brown body with crimson and orange highlights. An off-white, creamy but short-lived head leaves only very minor lace (possibly due to the high level of alcohol, or maybe the need for some more conditioning). The nose displays dark fruit (raisins, fig) and some alcohol. The medium body is lightened by a moderate, but still gently effervescent (very fine bubbled), carbonation. True to the description on the label, the flavor is rich with raisins and pears; as well as some apricot and slightly tart apple. It's mildly sweet maltiness also lends a nutty quality (hazelnut?) that becomes more obvious in the finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but far from intrusive. It finishes dry with some residual sweet fruity malt. Quite enjoyable. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Mar 20, 2003"

3.8,-8.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I waited for the right moment to share this 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. bottle of Ommegang ""Three Philosophers"" with my wife and son on another cold night this winter. We drank the ale at slightly under room temperature (maybe 60 degrees). The ale poured in an initially deep, almost blood, red, but the later pours were significantly cloudier due to much evident sediment. The foam was a light caramel color, which sustained a good body for much of the drink. This ale clearly signifies its high alcohol content (9.8%) on first smell--almost like wine. Anyhow, there is also a sweet aroma, but that sweetness is not at all evident by taste--the alcohol definitely overpowers most everything else--not something I am fond of, frankly. If you want to warm up quickly, this is the brew, but the taste is not quite up with the best of them.","longpondbeerman","Mar 10, 2003"
