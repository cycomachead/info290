4.32,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/29/2013. Pours clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a spotty cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, date, red grape, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Outstanding aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, red grape, date, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, clove, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, red grape, date, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, clove, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming lingering after the finish; but not boozy at all. Overall this is an outstanding quadrupel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

Attractive, viscous cling. There's an undeniable blast of alcohol at the first sip, but it recedes into a mellow medley of dark fruits and roasted grains, long on raIsins and dates.

I don't have answers for any of those questions, all I can say is that they did it, and it's wonderful.

In the taste, ripe grape, raisen, and plum but mostly grape. Alcohol is well in check and stays in the background. Pleasing dark fruits, some malt body lending caramel and brown sugar notes.

3.93,-3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer is rich, sweet, viscous, a touch effervescent and has lots of fruitiness to it in the middle / finish. The fruitiness has notes of raisin and dates most prominently to it. The finish has a spiciness to it from some warm alcohol as well as an earthy spiciness and some black pepper character to it. A really rich, caramelized malt character makes me think of rum, dark candi syrup, brown sugar and even some notes of molasses. This actually does do a good job of simulating an aged malt character; it is almost nutty and even has a sort of sherry like note to it. The texture is nice and rich, with works quite well with the faux aged character and rich malt character; this is most certainly a beer to be savored and sipped slowly. This beer is quite nice, it is more enjoyable than I expected. Definitely drink this one slowly and allow it to warm up as it becomes much more expressive and interesting as it warms.","Gueuzedude","Dec 15, 2010"

4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Drinkability: An expertly crafted brew. A fantastic drinking beer that had no hint of alcohol at all - I was shocked to read that this one was 11% ... between the mild tartness and maltiness, its completely buried. If you like malty Belgian's, this is one for you - worth seeking out, even at the (somewhat) steep price.","CrellMoset","Nov 28, 2010"

3.91,-3.5,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"D: This had great delicate complexity leading to delicious taste. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol amazingly well, so it was super easy to drink. But it was also good enough to sip and savor. However, there was a very unpleasant sulfur element to the scent (dominant) and taste (subtle). I'm not sure what's causing that, or if age would help that or make it worse. That's the only thing keeping this from being a top BSDA.","Pencible","Nov 03, 2010"
4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall I was a fan of this beer however it wasn't quite as complex as I would have liked given the big ABV. Still, a nice sipper that's worth a shot in the colder months.","glid02","Nov 01, 2010"
4.35,7.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"T: Quite similar to the aroma, and rather sweet, but it's a very positive experience. It manages to have a robust flavour which finishes remarkably dry, which makes for a very nice drinking experience. Finishes with just a little bit of bitterness that doesn't linger. Carbonation is beautiful... crisp, sparkling, and then it gives way to the dryness to finish. Alcohol is there, with a touch of pleasant warmth through the throat, and just enough to make each sip quite enjoyable. Very nicely done, and well worth every penny.","Proteus93","Oct 26, 2010"
4.28,5.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D: This brew has aged gracefully (or has forced-aged gracefully according to an earlier reviewer). The Kasteel Cuvée Du Chateau is very much a sipper and could have just as easily been labeled a quadruple rather than a BSDA. Perfect as a digestif.","FeDUBBELFIST","Oct 24, 2010"

3.93,-3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Brown in color with a tanned head that leaves a spotty lacing. Murky towards the bottom of the bottle. Nose is hard to wrap around, somewhat light. Notes of sweet, buttery molasses and candi sugar malt. The taste is still quite sweet, but tempered somewhat by a full carbonation. Candi sugar mixes with some strong dark fruits like raisin and figs. With the sweetness and high carbonation, comes off as almost like a craft root beer, with apparent herbs and spices mixed in. Super fruity as it warms. Alcohol also emerges as room temperature approaches; while not overly thick or sweet, this one does get a bit bogged down. Shy of the finest mouthfeels for the style, but still pretty damn good.","BretSikkink","Beers"

4.35,7.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"OVERALL: What the hell? This was a brewing experiment gone right. I would absolutely love to find an actual 10 year old bottle to compare to the magic con-artist that is the Cuvee du Chateau. I quite enjoy their regular bruin, but this freak of a brewing fast-one really got the best of me. I've had a few aged Belgian brews, and this one tastes and feels exactly like what I would expect from an aged Kasteel Bruin. Liked it so much I went back a grabbed a few more. Wonder if other breweries would be willing to try this with some of their age-friendly beers? A unique and enjoyable drinking experience. One to check out if you get the chance.","Jeffo","Aug 02, 2010"

3.53,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had on tap at Track 84 on 5.4.2010. Served in a tulip. Poured an opaque mahogany with burgundy highlights when backlit. A half inch, creamy, off-white head quickly receded into a thin consistent skim - no lacing present during the tasting. Nose was very subdued - some malt and a slightly vinous quality. Taste follows nose - dark fruit dominates, but not particularly malty, sweet or complex. Flavor profile is lacking the big malty, sugary quality I've come to associate with the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a subtle carbonation - somewhat thin for the style, with a slightly dry finish. I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Not really style consistent; closer to a Belgian Strong Dark in my opinion. Alcohol was well-hidden, but I was a bit disappointed by this beer.","Jwale73","Mar 16, 2010"
