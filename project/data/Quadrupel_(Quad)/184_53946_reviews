"3/26/15 (Bottle) - Dark brown/red appearance, non carbonated / no foam. Strong brandy aroma and other sweet aromas. Nice brandy taste with wine, sherry and wine prevalent. Very smooth beer with a very heavy kick. Excellent offering!"
"O:  With an appearance that is borderline rustic and a taste that would nicely complement medium-dark caramel chocolate, this ""trap"" might lure you into paying a high price for another bottle."

"Incredibly smooth quad. Tastes wonderful. Batch 16."

"4.27/5: Great base beer, wondrous barrel aging, what's not to love here?"
"Not much in the way of the bourbon oak cask.  I was rooting you bourbon.  Cheap rubber/plastic cork provided (which I could barely pull out) for such a highly esteemed brewery.  Surprised at how flat this is.  A pleasant quaff nonetheless.  Very easy drinking.  But has this quad fully succeeded the intention.  I was expecting more for the money spent but oh well.  Overall a ho hum quad and a basic meh!"

"Overall:  It's a great beer.  I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it.  I will say that the $17.99 I paid for the beer is not something I would be willing to put down again.  But I don't regret it.  Definitely going to be towards the top of my list of Belgian Quads.  4.5"
""
"O: clearly a carb issues (presumably batch maybe even bottle specific) hurts overall rating but still delicious 4"
"Batch # 7 is very smokey and peaty which overpowers the beer. When I have a chance to try another batch I will update my review."

"Enjoyed Batch 10 & 16 to date.  Batch 10 was fantastic.  Lots of oak mellowed the alcohol burn and reminded me of a very well aged Westy 12.  Batch 16 still had a significant burn from the higher ABV.  Have a few more batches I'm really looking forward to enjoying in the coming months.  Worth the higher precise tab."
""
""
""
"I realize my rating may be considered a bit stingy but I am drinking this without any consideration given to the La Trappe label or the high price of this beer. It is afterall still a drink, and unfortunately this one just isn't very good."
""

"Sip and enjoy."

"O - This wonderful tweak to a classic presents a beautiful bouquet of lush dark fruit complexities so common to the quad style while bringing complimentary subtle vanilla notes from the toasted oak barrels and bourbon whiskey-like spice that equally compliments the Belgian yeast undertones. A bit thinner than it's counterpart, this version smells and tastes like it's heavier on the alcohol while remaining the same. Complex though much of the nuance to the beer is lost to the age, it's a fantastic beer nonetheless!"

"Overall - The cage broke when I tried to open the bottle. I had to use channel lock pliers to get the cork out. Aisde from this, I really enjoyed this beer."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Tiny chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, candied fruit, tawny port, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with toffee, candied fruit, tawny port, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with fantastic smells and tasty but slightly oxidized flavors."
"D - A bit boozy but I like it. The cognac adds a nice touch."

"Great beer"

"Hazed ruby-brown colour, no head or lace at all. Smell is of red wine, oak, dark fruit, raisin and plums, vinious, rich malt and a bit of dark sugars, really nice nose on this. Taste is a bit of a let down compared to the nose but still quite nice, dark fruits, red wine and oak, yeast, plum and raisin with some dark bread, mild sweetness and some slight oxidization. Very light carbonation, medium-full body. This was quite tasty and the nose on this is incredible, would have liked more carbonation though, less carbonated than most of the style."
"Batch 11. Pour a murky mahogany with just an off-white skim of a head. Nose expresses figs, plums, a sugary character and booze. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of some toasted notes and a hint of tart cherries. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, slightly still, with a light oiliness to the consistency; perhaps a bit thin for the style. Overall, another great La Trappe beer. Just wish it had a little more body."

"Overall : a nice beer in the style Quadrupel."

"O: Overall I'd say it's a very nice beer, just not an exceptional quad. It excels in simplicity and delicateness. The most prominent flavor is alcohol. Personally I would have liked a more complex and flavorful beer. For a beer with ""oak"" in the title, I would have liked some oak influence in the flavor and aroma. It's not something I would probably buy again, because it just wasn't memorable enough."

"of depth, but made up in other departments."
""
""
""
"Batch 14. Pours no head (their regular quad pours a 5+ finger). Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium body. Oak and dark fruit nose and flavor is same, sweet malty dark fruit and oak. Why is the good stuff sooo expensive - $20.00 for a caged and corked 375ml bottle from Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
"We are very lucky to acquire batch #3 of this project. Over 50 percent of the barrel-aged blend comes from port barrels, and the rest is aged on other variations of toasted oak. Being that we are fond of the traditional Quad, this is a real treat all around. With results like this, we hope this project does not see delay."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a nice choice to aged in oak. Adds a nice smoothness and seems to balance the flavors a little bit. Complex and tasty but I think I enjoyed the non-aged version just a little more."

"O: Certainly a good beer. It could probably use 6-12 months to let the alcohol heat fade a bit. The quad and whiskey flavors already complement each other fairly well. Overall, a good beer. Pricey, but interesting if you're looking for a twist on the traditional quad."

"O - Wow! The aromas are amazing an it is a great quad that can be sipped slowly with delight. Love it and highly recommend. Enjoy!"

""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an awesome beer. The quad/bourbon combination is interesting and works quite well here. I am very interested to try some of the other barrel blends as they sound very interesting. While this beer is a bit on the pricey side, it is well worth the occassional splurge."

"O: Really liked this one. I'm a fan of quads anyway but the aging and the (port?) oak make this a subtle and complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Other than the light amount of warming in the finish, the alcohol is relatively well hidden in this big beer. The mouthfeel lacks the stickiness and the flavors are not nearly as sweet as some of the others in the Quad style, making this one a little easier to drink. Much different (and better) with the whiskey barrel oak-aging."

"Batch 11 from 375 cl bottle. I paid $14. Generally I like or love Belgian Ales. This one was a big disappointment for me. The ""cork"" was made of some plastic that was very difficult to remove- I had to use a 16"" set of Knipex pliers. Once I got past this issue I was excited about the pour. But disappointed that there was not even a millimeter of foam. This was seriously deficient in carbonation for me. I almost wanted to throw it out and drink something else. I did get through it and the taste was not so bad as it had complexity and flavor going for it. It didn't look pretty to me in a tulip glass-- Too thick, no bubbles, looked like flat cola to me. I haven't seen any Batch 11 reviews here so I thought this might add to the many reviews. Could be Batch 11 is particularly bad."
"This beer is phenomenal! It may be a bit pricey for its size (I paid $17 for330ml), but what it lacks in frugality it makes up for in taste. If you want to go the safe route, this PAIRS very well with smoked meats, BBQ-anything, along with grilled vegetables and smoked fish; this is an incredible beer"

"375 ml bottle into chalice; Batch 6, April 2011 bottling. Pours hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a small dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toast, oak, clove, molasses, light red wine, candi sugar, brown bread, vanilla, light chocolate, light peat, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and balance of malt and fruity esters with moderate oak barrel presence. Taste of big raisin, prune, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, clove, brown bread, oak, light wine, candi sugar, light peat, light chocolate, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, toffee, toast, caramel, molasses, brown bread, oak, clove, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big malt flavors with moderate fruity/spicy esters; with moderate oak presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible oak aged Quad! Tons of complexity and well balanced flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. Insanely enjoyable stuff; definitely worth enjoying again in the future, even for the high price of the bottle."
"O - nice beer. I was expecting a touch more oak influence but there is enough to satisfy."
"O: Fully developed palettes accustomed to fine wines and good food pairings will find even more to like here than I did. It's very flavorful and avoids the syrupiness of which some quads are accused (only Westy beats it in this regard). If you prefer bitterness or even just slight bitterness, I'd avoid it."

"Overall this beer is a great beer , not one of my favorites , I would rather have St Bernardus and would purchase it over this beer 9 times out of 10 , not saying this one is bad , just doesn't ad up to the ABT"
"Note: Batch #8. I saved this beer to celebrate today's crowning of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands."
"Batch 9, into a tulip. Pours a deep mahogany, with a pop of fizz that completely dissipates in about a minute or less. Burying your nose in the tulip gives a really nice, inviting aroma that hides the alcohol of a 10.0% beer. You get the typical date, fig sweetness of a quad. Quaffing it yields an unbelievably mellow flavor, and since this is not one of the older variations, the oak aging seems to have done a trick. I didn't get any alcohol burn until it got all the way to my stomach, likely as a result of not having eaten in a while. Otherwise, this is super silky smooth. I didn't know that this was made with Malbec wine casks until I went to look up some details due to catching a tannic taste from my red wine drinking days. My suspicions were confirmed online. It has a pretty light body, and was not as thick as I thought (or wanted) it to be. However, the overall flavor was excellent, and I'm glad I popped the cork on this before the weather got too warm."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer and I feel that it is worth the price given the experience given by the addition of oak and wine. The most impressive aspect is the nose but I felt the mouth was just a little more flat than what I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
"O- For an oak aged beer the oak could have been more present. The cost was too expansive to warrant a purchase. Maybe if a fresh batch came out it would be worth another try."
""
""
""
""
"The beer looks like blood, and has a mild feel of sand: how fitting then, to say, as in the Sam Raimi Spartacus series, ""Blood and Sand"". Or as Mat Cauthon from the Wheel of Time would say, even more apropos, ""Blood and bloody ashes"" (as a curse), as this beer tastes like ashes."

"3.25 D: It's an easy drink, but it doesn't have enough quality in the taste or mouthfeel to justify paying $15 for it. Give it a try if you must."

"I'd suggest this could age well for at least three more years. Good with desserts and cigars!"

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. (Batch 5 white wine barrels) Surprising murky dark brown color. An aggressive pour yielded almost no head or lacing. Big woody nose with tons of butterscotch and oak along with hints of bubblegum, vanilla, dark fruits, and just a touch of vinous notes. The oak is dominant in the taste as well, but with much more of the white wine character emerging from the barrels. Also getting hints of caramel, vanilla, booze, butterscotch, brown sugar, and just a faint touch of chocolate on the finish. The mouthfeel has very low carbonation, almost to the point where it seems flat, but not in a bad way. Slightly syrupy with a subtle warming alcohol burn on the finish. Overall, a fantastic beer, but I prefer the Isid’or Oak Aged."
""
""
""
""
"O- I really like this, even though I wish there was some kind of carbonation for some body backing or cleaning up the palate.. bit as this is the flavors are huge and the barrel has differently turn this base quad into a very complex leveled beer.... I wanna try another just to make sure I'm not crazy"
" And this just in: after opening and writing review, I noted that this was not just the quad, this is the Oak Aged Trappist Ale quad from La Trappe."
""
""

"Batch #3 here. Random find on the shelves of Gator Beverage in Gainesville. Obvious age on the bottle, with the label worn a bit. Poured on 11-24-12, so been in the bottle for over 2 years. Pours very dark red with a bit of sediment. Larger head than I expected. Smells of lots of dark fruits: figs and plums galore. Candy brown sugar as well. Some oak and definite wine presence from the port. Flavor is outstanding, and very much like Rochefort 10 with some extra booze. Complex black cherry, plums, grape, fig, yeast, candy sugar, port, with the perfect alcohol warmth. Sip and savor this one. Now I’ll have to track down the other versions!"
""
"O - I enjoyed this brew very much and I can only imagine it would get better with a few years on it. The price is a little steep though. Almost a cross between Pannepeut and Pannepot"
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with a nice large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light dry fruits and residual sugar with some wood notes. Taste is also dominated by some wood notes with light residual sugar notes and dry raisins. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting experiment but I believe the regular version is probably better then this barrel-aged version and the white wine notes where quite hard to distinguish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I was excited for this, but it's too sweet and not fruity enough. The oak doesn't mask the missing flavors. In fact, the oak makes it seem sweeter. Perhaps I'm being too critical. I still enjoy drinking it, but I was expecting more. Probably because I had a Rochefort 10 the night before. Nothing compares..."
""
"O: thisnisna very tasty brew, the red wine barrells really complimen the quad base excellently, very nicley done."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent complexity and balance of flavors. Very fruity. Smooth and easy drinking, especially for a 10% quad. Barrel treatment pushes everything up a notch from the base beer, making it a slight improvement everywhere."
"Overall, an astonishing beer with an incredibly complex flavor. Definitely commands your attention from the moment it enters the glass until the moment you take the last sip. Lovers of quads should seek this out, but try to find it at a reasonable price and check the batch number on the Konigshoeven website to see what kinds of barrels were used. Make sure it won't have any flavors that you yourself find objectionable."
"La Trappe Quadrupel Barrique is a remarkably complex beer that was all too easy to drink. While the oakiness was subtle, it, combined with the two years of aging, lent a good deal of flavor complexity. (From what I remember, this beer had a much more interesting flavor profile than the non-oak aged version I tried a few years back.) While this is, ounce for ounce, one of the priciest Trappist ale available, it is definitely worth trying."
"O - Wow this is good! Easy to drink for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O-this is an odd quad. Never had the regular version but I am anticipating it, I think it'll be a lot better. The smoke flavor to this beer isn't well received on my part. It's definitely a lot more drinkable though than a lot of other quads. It's very smooth. Wish it were a smaller bottle though."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark hazelnut with a few ruby highlights, with a nice lasting off-white creamy head. Nose is molasses, prunes, dates, candi sugars, a little port, some alcohol. Taste is an initial light sweetness transitioning to quite a heavy sweetness in the middle and finish. Palate is medium to full, verging on the syrupy, yet with lively carbonation which makes it a joy to sip. More warming alcohol, stewed fruits, biscuity malt and cinnamon sugars in the long finish."
"I like this beer a lot. I find it to be very tasty. It's too bad it is so expensive, as it is one of the more enjoyable quads I've had lately. I'd love to buy a bunch of bottles, but I don't think it's in the budget. That's ok though. This will remain a treat to look forward to. This beer is recommended to any fan of Trappist beers or other Belgian ales."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. I have had this before fresh and I am glad I aged a couple of bottles. If you like a Belgian style quad with a different take find one of these batches. I am glad I got the 13 as a red wine fan."
"Overall: Really unique Quad. The barrel notes are really prominent in this beer; not quite to style as far as a Quad is concerned. Not as fruity as I would like to see this beer. I did like it though. I would say it going to get better with some age; those barrel notes need to mellow out a little bit."
""
"I would definitely recommend this beer to others, especially fans of belgians. One of the more interesting beers I've tried recently."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good. I think that the regular La Trappe Quad is a good beer, but overly sweet. This solves that problem. A really nice use of the barrel. Tasty."
"overall a decided winner - fantastic beer. my one real criticism (aside from the wallet hit) would probably be that the whiskey is almost *too* dialed it; i would prefer it scaled back just a bit. but the whiskey component is a unique, tasty twist on the style. not to be missed, especially for quad fans."
""
""
""
"O: So different than most quads but I wouldn't change anything"
"O: A very deep, rich, and complex beer. The barrel presence on this is nice, but the whiskey character could stand to mellow a bit. I think this will get better with time/age but fun to enjoy now as well."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Excellent beautiful beer! I was not expecting that much..."
""
""

""
""
""

"O - I really enjoyed this offering. I felt that the barrels added a nice layer of complexity to an otherwise standard quad. Not that the barrel integration was perfectly done, but more of an enhancement that stood out above the base beer."
"""BATCH 7 is blended in June 2011 and is the first batch (of two) that has matured in old whiskey barrels. These barrels come from different whiskey distilleries such as Bowmore, Tamdhu, Strathspey and Laphroaig (Johnstons). The aroma's of the whiskeys have an obvious impact on the final flavor. This flavor is remarkable and clearly different from those of previous batches. Peat and burnt are more present, while wood and wood tannins are less obvious to spot. But the warming effect of the full, robust flavor the whiskey barrels passed on to our already beautiful Quadrupel, makes this batch maybe even the most tasty brewed to date."""

""

"Batch #9 and batch #1 should be the best until now."

"Nice beer. Pretty complex and some interesting changes as it warms. I can’t believe the wonderful mouth feel here."
""
""
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark orange amber with tons of floating particles. Half finger head and lacing. Pungent fruit and phenolic aroma. Sweet fruit, sweet malt, raisins, grapes, banana, vanilla, phenolic flavors. Tastes great, but I don't really detect a strong oak flavor and it may be a bit on the cloying sweet side. An enjoyable quad, but at the price, I would buy one of the others out there."
""
"Very interesting and flavorful. Flavor is pleasant and unified. I would be happy to pick this up again."
""
"This is a VERY unique tasting quad, never had anything like it, this is from wine barrels? Wow shocking. Fabulous beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this was a little too boozy for me. Not my favorite of the Quads, but I can understand the appeal of this for others. I did'nt know anything about this beer before I opened it. Probably should have let it cellar for a year or so."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation, it is big and enjoyable with a pleasant balance of character. The oak was not overly done, in fact it was pleasantly subtle and really worked as a background nuance that made for a top shelf experience. This is a solid example that is worth checking out. This ranks right up there will all the other quads that get a lot more fame and attention in the category,"
"one hell of a beer! cork and cage rig, mine says batch 7. poured hazy copper woody color into a goblet with a small off white head. smells very oaky and smokey. notes of sweeter malts, english toffee, and thick unrefined honey all dance in the nose. flavor is wood aged right up front and bold. very laid back flavors of bourbon, honey, and straw. really nice complexity and mellow alchohol given the 10% abv. mouthfeel is nice too, carbonated just enough and a heavier medium body. this one feels rather delicate despite what it is. overall one of the best belgians in the world as far as i am concerned. i could drink this nectar every day and be a very happy man. 20 bucks a bottle is a little steep, but its a lovely drink!"
""
""
"O: I have another one of these boys sitting in my cellar. I really can't wait to crack this one again at the 3 year mark. If you see it buy it and treat your taste buds."
"Batch 3, aged 1 year then poured from a bottle into a orval snifter."

"This is a good batch. The oak flavor is very strong. The dark fruits are plentiful in the aroma, but very faint in the taste. 4"

"12.7 ounce/375 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch #3. I've had this bottle for a while now, so I might as well drink it! Served in a Dogfish Head Signature glass, the beer pours a murky amber/brown color with about an inch light tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is malty and sweet, it smells like brown sugar, oak, caramel malt, dark fruit, Belgian yeast, and port. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some banana and dark fruit flavors noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Overall I think it's a good but not great beer. At $14.99 a bottle I probably wouldn't buy it again, but even then I still think it's worth trying."
""
""
"One of the mildest uses of oak aging I've come across. If you were expecting some big vanilla or wine notes, you won't find them here. Maybe the barrel was going neutral by the time it was filled with beer. This bottle is over a year old, but in my experience, barrel flavors don't really mellow over time. The yeast character and sweet malt are the primary flavors. I don't know that it delivers the goods for the price (~$15 per 375), but it is a good beer. I feel a bit let down, but I've never been the biggest La Trappe fan anyway."
""
""
""
"Pretty awesome."
""
""
"O - Like I said; a beautiful attempt to make something good even better."
""
""
""
"I really like this beer, but I must say that it is nowhere near its price tag. $17 for 12.7 oz.? I'd rather go with a full 750 of regular La Trappe Quad for $6 cheaper. This is still a great beer, but it's hard to notice the oak aging and it's cost is not really worth it. I will enjoy the hell out of the rest of it though."
""
"Very smooth mouthfeel with light to medium carbonation, slightly bitter up front but leads way to a very mellow sweetness of the aforementioned fruits and some other malt sweetness."
"Batch 6 is good as well, white wine is kind of an interesting choice, but the sweetness gets balanced by the smokiness in 7 and the dryness/vinuous tart character from the white wine in 6. Decent lacing, too. The dryness and sweetness kinda clash and its a bit rough feeling (like sandpaper tongue) but not bad."
"Overall this is a great beer, well worth the money. The blending and the oak presence is well balanced as is the taste. I would gladly buy another bottle of this one!"
"Cheers..."
"Overall: I drank this beer immediately after having a La Trappe Quad and as I said above it is truly its own animal. Honestly I prefer their standard Quad as there is more diversity in flavor. This one was dominated by the Port."
"cant believe my little liquor store carried this. at 20.00 this is super pricey but well worth it. the best trappist beer or for that matter Belgian style (made in holland) beer ive had. its a shame the Bros havent tried this yet."
"This one would be a real cellar stocker if not for the high price tag."
"D - This is a very unusual beer, especially coming from a Trappist brewery. I have been happy to see La Trappe branching out recently and doing some new and unusual beers, this one is probably the best of their experimental beers that I have tried so far. The barrel aging adds some really interesting flavors and the port character in particular works very nicely with the base beer."
"got my hands on a bottle while @ the Ginger Man in Midtown, NYC. Dark pour with forward aromas. Head retains itself well after pour. the Oak is not overpowering, a good complement to the dark sugars in the beer. The alcohol doesn't bite to hard at the tongue as in other higher alcohol beers do. overall a great drink that i would recommend to someone into oak-aged brews."
"Pours a moderately-dark brown with a bit of a mahogany hue to it. Large foamy head with good retention and nice lacing. The nose brings forward plenty of dark fruit and a bit of booze. Faint dark sugar and molasses plus a bit of oak. Good fruit and sweetness character in the flavor to balance the oak. Medium to full body with a nice barrel presence. Tasty brew."
"O - good but my least favorite for it's style."
"I can only spare myself the aggravation by never buying another one till a different stopper is used - the effort to remove the cork crosses into stupidity"
"My taste changed a lot, or this beer actually lost from aging."
"overall, I think this was a nice play on a traditional quad. the oak gave it a nice finish but wasnt overpowering. a very complex beer that is up there on my list of favorites. a bit on the pricey side though, as I can get 2 rochefort 10's for about what I paid for this one."
"Overall- This is a fresh batch and is drinking extremely well right now. I will probably try to grab a few more bottles to throw in the cellar and bust out on special occasions, like the next Chicago sports championship (minus the Cubs obviously), or something like that. Even at $20 I would not pass this up if you have the chance to try it. A no doubt top 20 beer for me."
"A tremendous oak-aged version of a fantastic quad. I would love to try this one again...and again...and again..."
"O: A little spendy, but definitely worth it now and then. I haven't had many quads recently, and beers like this really make me wonder why I've ignored many of these. Will definitely snag more of these if I see them."
"Overall an excellent beer and one I may seek out again."
"Pours an exquisite and hazy deep amber. Not much head, but a good amount of lacing. Smells of grapes, oak, and caramel. Then, there's the taste. Sweet malt, a nudge of bitter hops, then a familiar unctuous feel and flavor that reveals the oak aging. Full, creamy, round mouthfeel without being heavy. The 10% ABV warms on the way down, but doesn't overpower any of the magnificent flavors. Unsurprisingly, it becomes more complex and the flavors bolder as it warms."
"O - One of my favorite beers I have had. Wonderful complexity to this beer!!!"
"o - overall, the oak adds a lot of complexity to the beer. the smells and flavors certainly have been altered from the barrel aging, but these barrels and this beer are not a match made in heaven and i really wonder if any barrel aging can improve this classic quad which is one of the few that defines the style for me. the original is not boozy at all in my opinion and the barrel aging really brings out the booze (perhaps with time this would be a gem?). definitely a solid beer and worth checking out if you are a fan of barrel aged brews and/or quads. i'd be interested to try some of the batches that use ""toastier"" woods."
"An enjoyable Quad. A bit more barrel character and this would be excellent. This is very good anyway. Something I like and would recommend."
"Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer. It is primarily hindered by the booziness of the drink. Components are solid with a bit too much bite to drink a lot of."
"This is a very impressive Belgian Dark. I can put it right up with my top 3 favorites in the style. If you run across it, get it!"
"O-Pretty goddamn good. Will cellar a few of these. In the echelon of Westvleteren."
"Suck on that, hairy armpit ladies."
"Almost gave this beer straight 5’s, had to sit back and think about it, so easy to get carried away when a beer is this good!"
"Overall, an exceptional beer. The oak aging creates a smoothness and a bit of sweet flavor. Hard to find this beer but worth the effort. Go get some."
"O- Very good beer, but i felt it was a TAD bit of a let down. None the less a good beer, but not great."
"O - A pretty interesting take on some oak aging. A solid beer, but just not in the same league as the others in the list. Finished #9 of 10."
"Batch 3 was lost on the potluck of ageing. Very boozy, not greatly drinkable."
"O: so smooth, not too sweet or too alcohol-y. The nose was amazing, easily the best part, apart from the taste. A pretty perfect beer all around, there's not much that I would change about this."
"O/D - Nice Quad. I couldn't tell if I liked it better than the original but it was enjoyable. Complex, tasty, and no noticable alcohol."
"Overall: The tamest most non memorable Trappist that I have had, if there was a style to tie it to I would call it a session Trappist, But this beer under-delivers for being a $15 bottle, disappointed, yes."
"This was a very expensive beer, I paid 14 euro for a single bottle but it was a real treat."
"Well, good, but a bit disappointing. The sweetness just dominates with a whip & a heel, & everything else slinks around trying to avoid notice. Good brew, but I was hoping for a bit more distinction in the oaking."
"OVERALL: I enjoyed this brew for sure. While the nose was a little less interesting and the palate a little flatter, the taste profile was quite intriguing. As a quad fan, this oak aged version blended the barrel with the base quad quite well, but consequently muted the base quad slightly in order to make room for the barrel. La Trappe quad is a very bold and flavorful brew, so it’s not surprising that the barrel had to make room for itself somewhere. Regardless, this is the first barrel aged trappist to my knowledge, and based on how enjoyable this one was, I hope we see some BA Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12 soon enough. Well done La Trappe! Cheers!"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer very much. I had high expectations going in and they were exceeded. If you love this brewery like do or Belgian quads in general, I highly recommend seeking out this beer. Excellent!"
"I had some severe high hopes that this was going to be better than the regular version but I beleive that the orginal is still better. This beer pours out very similar to the regular Quad, it's basically the same brown color. This one might be a little easier to see through and the head is much thinner here. The aroma is a little bit let fruity and more wooden which makes sense but I was hoping that some of those fruit aromas would have been preserved in here. There a slightly sweet and sour aroma coming off it as well. I don't really get vanilla though. The taste has a little bit of vanilla but it's not nearly as lively as the original version. This beer has a similar mouthfeel but less bubbly. Overall both are wonderful brews but I feel that you can save a crap load of money and just stick to the original version."
"Notes: This beer is super sweet and getting into the cloying territory. I would have like more wood tannin or some extra hops to bring balance back to this beer. I do appreciate the uniqueness of the style and dig that it came from a Trappist brewery."
"Thanks to schmittymack for bringing this one over a week ago. Poured from the cool little 375 into an Odell glass. Pours a lightly hazy amber color with a good white head. Aromas of light oak, dark fruits (plums, figs, dates) and caramel. Medium bodied, with dried fruits, raisins and toffee."
"(D)- An awesome Quad. A beer that is usually fairly rich to begin with, the oak aging really puts this on a whole other level of richness and strength for the style."
"This is a damn tasty beer. Tastes like it smells but with burnt sugar, hints of maple, walnut, black truffel and black tea. Really datey and pruney. The oak is nice, adds a soft round mouthfeel to the beer as well as some tannin from the wood. A good bit of vanilla on the finish really helps the drinkability and keeps the 10% at bay. Delicious beer."
"O: A unique take on a quad with the barrel treatment. Takes it away from quad territory and almost into the old ale realm."
"Well, that was a bit of a disappointment. The barrel-aging adds a bit of interest, but the underlying brew just doesn't have the complexity of other top-tier quads. It was, at least, interesting with some parmesan."
"Snagged this bottle up at Julios tonight on my way home. Poured in to a snifter, the color is a nice rose, with a ring of lace, and tiny chunks of yeast floating here and there. The smell is of peach nectar, honey, alcohol, and stone fruit. Taste is pretty damn close to the nose, with a nice lively carbonation. The oak barrel aging is apparent, but not too over the top. Same with the alcohol, definitely noticeable, but not overkill. Interesting to see a Trappist brewery use barrel aging. La Trappe Quad is one of my favorites from the monks anyway...wish I had a bottle of regular Quad to compare. Either way, damn tasty."
"This one is decentlyhot, like a typical La Trappe Quad, but a bit more rounded from the barrels and the length of the aging though."
"Served: January 29, 2011"
"Pours a murky reddish brown, small head that diminished down to a lingering ring. Smell actually reminds me of a sweet red wine. Very fruity, some oaky wine notes, pretty interesting and quite nice. Taste of this one is very smooth. The oak is pretty subtle, and the year in the barrel has no doubt mellowed this one out quite a bit. Definitely some tannic wine qualities, along with some fruity, estery flavors. It finishes with a slight bitterness and a lingering wine taste. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would hope, but the lower carbonation level works pretty well. I would say the drinkability is pretty high, but with a quality brew like this I am taking my time. Overall this beer is definitely an interesting take on the original. I would love to try all the different batches. A little pricey, but a unique and tasty brew."
"The beer feels a little raw but the oak adds another layer of flavor and works well with the style. The oak is strong in this one."
"Overall it's a pretty good beer, though the huge banana character was unexpected and not very quad-like."
"This is pretty good but I can't recommend for the price, way to expensive, especially when you don't really taste a barrel aged quad."
"D: Can I buy more please? I have one more to cellar, but I will clearly need more of this greatness. Cheers."
"Could drink this all night."
"For the first time (when discussing a Koningshoeven beer) can I begin to talk about some of the finer intangibles that separate Trappist Ales from most Abbey Ales. Notice that any mention of oak-aging is slight, as this character does a great job of smoothening the beer and adding subtle complexity without over-stating it. Although the alcohol could exercise some restraint in mouthfeel, the beer has the magical sweetness in taste that translate to succulent dryness late; and while offering many complexities that are difficult to describe... it is Trappist quality through and through. Definately the pick of the litter when considering the Koningshoeven portfolio. ...reminds me of a green Rochefort 6."
"This is a Batch 1 bottle corked 07/10, serial KO3F10, procured from Tanakaya Beer Store in Meijiro, Tokyo at 2070 yen; a treasure unearthed and a clear purchase decision. This is taken shortly after my 2009 La Trappe Quadrupel and quick comparisons reveal a mellowed sweetness and phenolic nature as mentioned and the introduction of vinous, oak flavors. The fruity nature was also less succulent and felt more ""matured"" generally. Very interesting and will definitely revisit this batch and the other 3 batches in the 2010 vintage."
"A light oak smell and taste. Good drinkable with a very good aftertaste. I am very surprised by this one because in my opinion this abbey brews not the best abbey beers. This one however is a hit!"
"D : light alcohol taste from the barrels ( little whisky touch ) very drinkable"
"D - This is very good, although it smells and looks more like a tripel in some ways. I'm curious to try Batch 2 or 3, as I get a sense that they are all quite different. It's a bit too boozy for mass quantities, but I'd love to work through a bottle over a few hours."
"Glad I was able to lay hands on probably the rarest of all extant trappist ales, brewed in small quantities and at the time of review available only at the store of monastic brewery. 375 ml bottle, Batch 2, K28610, into 180 ml Chimay chalice. Beige, almost instantly dissipating head atop of clear amber body that gets hazier with additional pours. Honeyish aroma with oak, apple, and well restrained alcohol apart from apple brandy notes. Flavor is prevalent fruity tartness of apple accompanied by some alcohol warmth and slight astringency from oaky notes. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall, a very decent, well mellowed quad with bridled alcohol that I often find quite disturbing in La Trappe brews."
"Looks rich in color, bronze cant see thru it. Smells like caramel apple pie. Taste is complex....has a bitter bite sorta like sour apple and coffee with honey and a tangy aftertaste. I would definitely drink another...its one of my favorites. A great addition to any cellar."
"edit: just gave a higher score... I'm drinking my next one right now, after one month in 50° fridge... the taste is already perfect. Unbelievable! What a balance, no alcohol in there what so ever!"
"Overall: A very nice la Trappe beer, better than the regular la Trappe quad. As mentioned before, the sweetness in the taste was a bit too much, making this beer a bit simple. Compared to the bottled version, the tap version is very smooth and easy to drink. The bottled version is still a bit too sharp and needs at least another year before it can be fully appreciated.An interesting experiment for sure, can wait to try it again in a few years, then this beer should be magnificent!"
"Had this beer while in the Netherlands. Surprisingly good! (I thought I was ordering the Westmalle) Subtle sweet flavorings of caramel, and some spices, but hard to describe. Not much to say for the smell, though. Honestly though, this one should be up there with the Rocheforts."
"D: Just great! I like the Quad, but this version brings something extra and in this way has a unique character. Now bottle it PLEASE!!!"
