4.48,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Brew pours a pretty hazy amber in color with a good 3+-finger foamy off-white head. A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. Lots going on with the aroma as there is burnt brown sugar, spices (cloves and pepper?) with some dark fruit overtones. More going on with the taste as the cloves and spices are right up front along with the brunt brown sugar sweetness with a hint of caramel and yeast in the mix along with some plums/raisins and really not as sweet as you might think. Actually finishes pretty smooth without tasting the alcohol, though you know it is in there. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, you won't get to 'the sixth glass' as you would be pretty well blitzed by then I would think. Overall a tasty brew.","BeerWithMike","Mar 23, 2015"

Lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass; ruby tones and crystal clear after pouring first half of bottle, the butt of the bottle introduced healthy sized clumps of sediment.  Mostly dark fruit on the nose, prunes, cherries, a heavy biscuit flavor, toffee.  Best by 8/22/2015 and still getting some heat from the booze, fruity yeast, toffee, full bodied and extremely carbonated.

There are hints of bubblegum phenols found in strong dark ales, but it is very well controlled compared to many American versions I've tried. Big, rich, dark fruit, dark sugar, and dark malt flavors. Hops serve to dry up the mouthfeel enough to keep the experience from being a cloying one. This sample came from a twelve ounce bottle with a bottle cap; not sure if a corked version would change the character or not. I am happily willing to investigate this matter. I would very much like to drink this next to other examples of the style. I expect it would do very well.","ommegangpbr","Feb 01, 2015"

Smell: dates and clove most prominent with caramel apple and a little spicy hopping; mild bready back. Taste: pear, caramel candy, date bread and plum notes...fruity but too quickly into big earthiness and a note of clove. For a quad the body is surprisingly light upfront then goes limp and heavy midsip and just as quickly vanishes, fleeting on the palate.

Definitely on the lighter side of the quad flavor spectrum - more fruity and dry than chocolatey and sweet. Still, the booze is always present and comes off a little 'hot' and off-putting at times. This bottle is fresh and could probably benefit from some age.","Mongrel","Dec 26, 2014"

Boulevard should be commended for crafting this as I was nearly fooled into thinking this came from overseas and anyone who loves Belgian beers or something that elevates the American art of craft brewing owes it to him or herself to give this a go.

The only thing I will say is that I wish there were a little more depth of flavor to this one. One of the things I like about the style is that it continues to evolve and develop throughout the enjoyment of the glass. This one was pretty similar from start to finish. As such, I feel the need to dock the overall score, because the sum of it's parts were just not quite as good as the individual components.","LambicPentameter","May 23, 2014"

Head doesn't stay put for long though compared to other abbey ales kind of reducing aromas. Or maybe I should stop typing and finish this brew right. Cheers!","BradleysBrew","Apr 11, 2014"

So sweet with a huge spice profile, and a fragrant alcoholic character. The flavored and mouthfeel were extraordinarily well-balanced. Not a beer to be consumed cold, started at 55 or so, and it got better as it warmed.

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, grape, toast, brown sugar, clove, herbal, pepper, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of caramel, raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, candi sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent quadrupel style! All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

Upon smelling this brew, it's hard to believe that it is 10.5% ABV and even though it's more relevant a taste upon drinking it, the presence of dark fruits and spices are much easier to identify.

Definitely a distinct offering in a field populated by several world classics that are among the greatest of all beers. I've had a few quads and this one stands out as one of the spiciest ones. I probably wouldn't buy it again for just that reason, but those who enjoy this style and don't have a sweet-tooth like mine will probably love this.

Fruity aroma and bit medicinal, likely due to the high alcohol content, but not unpleasant at all. The taste was surprising; the fruitiness comes through up front followed by dryness with some bitterness that I wasn't expecting based on my experience with other quads. A very pleasant surprise though! After a few sips to get the full effect I settled back and savored every mouthful. An excellent quad and definitely worth a return engagement!","Steamer","Jan 17, 2013"

I'm getting slight sweetness with some dark fruit. There is also a slight banana note. This has some age and it has smoothes things out. There is a slight cherry note to the beer. In the finish, I'm getting the dark fruit and cherry in the finish. I liked this more than the BBQ.","oline73","Jan 17, 2013"
3.99,-4.1,4,3.75,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a dark maple syrup and candy brown with a creamy yellow head that sits at a half finger’s width with lots of small tightly packed bubbles. Carbonation bubbles can be clearly seen racing to replenish the head, but the beer’s body is murky and hazed, letting very little light pass through, even though the beer is clearly not black. Lacing is sparse, thin, and patchy on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells like spicy cinnamon raisin bread with a touch of cloying alcohol. Dark fruit malts give a firm body to the smell, highly suggesting raisins, but also verging on dates and perhaps a touch of plums, though the malt also suggest rich dark caramel. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly raisin-like with good sweet plum notes and alcohol spice backing, and a touch of bready yeast at the close. The beer begins with light spicy alcohol before opening into sweet raisin and then slowly moving towards sweet plum. The close brings the yeast to the forefront, suggesting breadier Belgian yeast characteristics in-between the sweet dark fruit notes. The malt is mostly dark fruit but does suggest the lightest bit of caramel and brown sugar. From the beginning, spicy alcohol bubbles under the tongue and the flavor, placing the sweetness of the beer just below cloying. On the mouth the beer feels thick and creamy with a touch of sticky heaviness on the tongue. The carbonation is light and fluffy and the mouth is left slightly dry and slightly cloyed with sweet sugar and a tingle of alcohol. Overall, the beer is a success within the style, and a lovely beer overall. The beer has great rich and complex flavors masking the heavy alcohol nicely, while still letting you know that this beer is for sipping. A success from Boulevard!","Maxwell","Jan 17, 2013"

The light colored head dissipates very quickly leaving only a rim around the edge. The aroma is sweet and fruity with hints of apple, pear, and dates. The first sip delivers a well balanced beer. There is a caramel sweetness followed by just the right amount of bitter. There is a lingering alcohol warmth after swallowing. Subsequent sips provide a depth of sweetness. the caramel fades a bit and the fruity notes come forward. Sixth Glass has a rich mouthfeel with a mild foamy effervescence. It's not too syrupy, but delivers a richness that a Quad should. Overall, this is a great beer. It keeps one wanting more, sip after sip.","Levich","Dec 30, 2012"

This is almost like a Belgian Barley Wine or a Belgian Strong Amber Ale (I know that doesn't exist as a style but it's not dark and it's not golden).

4.3,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The shape of the bottle, the quirky label artwork, and the Boulevard Brewing Co. name engraved on the neck gave off a very European vibe. The body looked a little paler than a typical Quad, with the color of mahogany. The head was fizzy and short lived, settling down to a lacy collar. The smell had fragrances of apricot, hazelnut, and pear. The flavor was delicately sweet and a bit spicy. I could taste raisin, pears, saffron, toffee, and chili pepper. The aftertaste was sweet like hard candy, until abruptly being cut off by yeasty dryness. Quite sticky in the mouth, and not quite as velvety smooth like the true Belgian varieties. The beer would have benefited from some darker malts to further enhance the date and fig flavors mentioned on the label, and add complexity.","rajendra82","Aug 22, 2012"

The head was enormous for such a high-alcohol beer. I'm not sure how it was possible. I had trouble pouring it gently enough to get a decent amount of liquid in my glass without it foaming over. I'm fast becoming a fan of quads. Perfect for someone who likes the high alcohol and intense flavour of trippels, but dislikes coriander. This one is pretty good, but it is not as good as the last one I had, The Reverend. Sorry to get so personal in my reviews, but I like to give as useful a review as possible by giving my background in the style. This one is just a bit too bitter and dry for a quad. It tastes like it's been dry-hopped. From what I've read, I don't feel like this is the idea of a quad. The last quad I had was much better balanced. This one is quite good as well, but not at the same level. A really good quad doesn't need as much spicing as this one has, in my opinion, but then again my opinion is truly a humble one. I'm a total noob to the style. So, take that with a grain of salt.","ElCommodoro","Jun 23, 2012"

Light, needlepoint beading. Nose is stuffed with delicious Belgian yeast. Soft citrus and pungent floral sweet bread. Refreshingly light and approachable for a quad. All the highlights of the nose carry through to the taste buds with the addition of a subtle licorice presence and clove. Really enjoy this beer, it’s far less invasive than most true Belgian quads but still complex and intriguing. The feel is appropriate.

Will buy and drink this one again for sure!","ChopperSmith","Sep 16, 2011"

On the other hand, how often do you find a quad that is this good for the price? I think I paid $2.85 for the bottle, and that's in Alabama.

The taste holds notes of caramel, rye bread, black pepper, fig, light plum, light strawberry, red grapes, and a light sprinkling of chocolate powder. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice quad, one that deftly balances the bready, sweet, and fruity characters very well.","TMoney2591","Aug 24, 2011"

3.59,-13.7,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sixth Glass pours something in between maroon and more of a brown color, but it fades to a clear ruby when held to light. The cream colored head is almost out of control, more than four fingers tall and threatening to spill out the glass. Head retention is solid, but the complete lack of lacing is a major letdown. The nose is a bit higher on peppery phenols as compared to dark fruits than usual, but there's also a nice background note of overripe banana that I don't always find in quads. The flavor just can't hang with the best of the style. The most important thing for me in a beer like this is to have a solid sweet fruity base to hold the rest of the beer together. While there are certainly notes of plum and figs, they aren't nearly potent enough to keep the pepper and clove yeast notes from, together with a generous warming sensation from the alcohol, running roughshod over the brew. The body ends up on the light side for 10.5%ABV, and the carbonation is middle of the road, and just a little bit dull. In the end, the beer captures neither the creamy texture (despite a dry finish) nor the expressive carbonation of a world class quad. I had high expectations for Sixth Glass, having really enjoyed my previous Boulevard offerings (including BBQ), but this goes to show just how hard brewing a top notch quad is.","axeman9182","Jul 03, 2011"

Has a light tan head, that was 1.5 fingers high. Left a light lacing on the glass throughout sipping it. Really like the smell on this one. Some dark brown sugar, dark fruits like plum and a great smell of sourdough bread. Taste follows suit. Balance is great in this beer. The sweetness is not overwhelming at all. Plenty of fruit and spice, and bready yeast are there. Carbonation is well tuned to keep this 10.5% beer fairly light.

Eventually the head fades into a light collar with a few spots of lacing on the side of the glas. The nose has some faint dark fruits plus a bit of lightly-sweet malt. Perhaps a hint of caramel. Nothing too complex. A bit of booze there as well. The flavor has dark fruits, cherries, light alcohol, and a bit of sweet malt. Everything melds together quite well.

The mouthfeel is medium, very carbonated, a little bit of that creaminess you expect from belgians but certainly not as much as a Trappist. The higher alcohol creates a perception of bitterness and does give off some warmth that flirts with being hot. The flavor is suitably complex with a rounded malt character, figs, maybe a hint of orange, some peppery character. With the high alcohol you sometimes get the flavor of some type of liquer.

Aromas of fruit at first, bananas and apple pie, sweet spices, sort of fluffy. Wow, surprised by the palate here which is nothing like I was expecting from the nose. Everything leading up to the first sip was pointing towards a lighter profile for a quad but this is pretty beefy. Very sweet up front, brown sugar and maple candy, caramel. Some bready malt undercurrents but really nothing too out of the ordinary beyond the sweetness. Slick slightly chewy mouthfeel. I gotta say this is the first Blvd beer that I haven't been totally blown away with - still a decent take, maybe just not up my alley.","twelvsies","Mar 12, 2011"

Aroma is full of phenol, peppery, and spices. Faint roastyness and raisin, but why less than usual. Flavor is spicy and peppery. There is some chewy malt and deep flavor, but I am missing the deep dried fruit flavors I'm acustomed to. Plainly put feels more like a saison, dry, attenuated but well carbed. Yeah its quafable, but I'm not so sure a quad should be. I think its a tasty beer but suffers from poor yeast selection.","pmlondrigan","Jan 26, 2011"

Smell is sweet, fruity, and somewhat similar to a fruit wine other than the hint of malt. Taste is initially all deep fruit and sugar sweet, giving way to a nice malt and warm alcohol finish that cleans up the sweetness fairly well.

Lacing was lasting but thinner. Nose was dark fruit, some alcohol and yeast, grapefruit and spices. Taste was complex and very tasty - starting with dark fruit, moving to sweet cinnamon, grapes and dates with notes of chocolate and a wonderful interplay with sweet and bitter and alcohol warming at the end. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy, almost chewy and well carbonated. Alcohol is whew - there, in feel and in effect. Definitely a sipper.

It poured a pale amber with an absolutely massive and very long-lasting head. The aroma was very unusual, with some sour elements that I did not expect, besides the usual malt and dark fruit notes common to Belgian Strong Dark Ales (or quadruples). On the palate the beer was delicious, with wonderful mouthfeel, some heat from the 10.5% alcohol, and maybe a hint of sourness? Or perhaps it was wood from cask aging? Hard to be absolutely sure, in spite of working my way through the entire bottle, trying to decide. The beer that I think it reminded me of the most was Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo, which is pretty high praise. I regret that this was the only beer from The Smokestack Series that I've been able to try, and I wish I could have brought a bottle or two back to Alaska to share.","Reswald","Aug 06, 2010"

A bit lighter in color than I was expecting, as it was a lighter shade of chestnut than other quads I have tried. Decent sized head forms with the pour. Smell was very boozy, and full of ripe plum notes. Taste was very good and true to the quad style. Lots of raisin notes, with some black licorice, and a sugary aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick but smooth enough to enjoy. Drinkability was above average as it's a flavorful beer, but it's very hot with alcohol.

The taste is also rather sweet, more so than I would have thought but it is to style. All malt, bitterness only to balance slightly and a definite alcohol finish and linger. Mouthfeel is very full but due to the carbonation it seems lighter and bubbly, this could almost do the job of champagne. As drinkable as any beer this big can be, one that probably should be sipped and drinking 6 smaller glasses as opposed to chugging the bottle would probably be a good idea.","gmfessen","Apr 24, 2010"

4.12,-1,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours an over ripe, bruised orange with a big, off cream head that leaves very, very little lacing. Of all the Smokestack beers, this one definitely has the worst head retention. The aroma is dark fruits muddled with dark malts. Fig, date, bruised apples, and over ripe cherries all come out in the nose. Mix that with toast, yeasty biscuits and a heavy dose of caramel. Also just a hint of alcohol comes through in the nose. The flavor is pretty typical Quad. Big raisins, dates, figs, bruised bananas and just a hint of bruised cherries. Also overly toasted bread mixed with overly caramelized sugar. The alcohol is there but well hidden. My biggest problem with this beer is its mouthfeel. It's just a bit thin for how big this beer is. Overall, this is my favorite standard Smokestack as long as Tank 7 doesn't go into regular production. Thanks Boulevard.","hwwty4","Jan 14, 2010"

The smell is nice. Almost licorice, but definitely an overwhelming sweetness. As I poured the beer I got a great waft of scent. Tasty, tasty tasty! Rich chocolate, caramel, toasted almond flavor. Does have a fairly present alcohol flavor, but the acidity does not overwhelm the sweetness. The aftertaste does continue the sweetness but has a bit of a bitter alcohol feel too. No quadrupel is considered very drinkable to me. I can drink a bomber and that's about it. I could drink more, but I wouldn't enjoy it as I did the first bottle.

3.87,-7,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours an initially hazy amber color. Not quite brown. A giant head forms on top, falls back and leaves very sticky lacing. It then clears up pretty well, staying a nice clear amber color throughout. A nice looking beer, a little lighter in color than I would expect, but nice looking. The smell is incredibly nutty and raisiny, sticky like syrup, and a tiny bit toasty. It almost gets rich and buttery in the smell a bit. There's even hints of some different grains, maybe some regular sugars (un-starch converted kind). The taste kind of sticks out as a spicy, caramel syrup flavor. I notice some cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, maybe some other floral aspects. There's also a slightly bready, toasty aspect to the flavor, with a bit of earthy nuts. Pretty good, I like the somewhat clean profile in some respects. It's pretty full a bit medium, but not quite syrupy and sweet. The carbonation just sort of rushes in pleasantly, without a bite. The alcohol is a bit powerful, though quite normal for the style. Enjoyable, fits within the style, nothing wrong with it, but nothing outstanding.

All in all, this is an excellent Quadrupel that lives up to the Smokestack name. Not only that, but I'd guarantee that this beer ages well.

4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Now for a taste. This tastes similar to what Ommegang Three Philosophers would taste like if there was no lambic added and it had a bit more body. Thick and creamy on the tongue, and the alcohol heat comes out a bit to thin and dry it out. Caramelized apples, burnt walnuts, raisins, and sherry. Spice in the alcohol, but not too much heat. Looks like the fermentation temperature was kept well under control with this one, which is vital for a smooth Belgian that you don't want to have to soak in a sugary cover-up flavor. I'd say that the hops, alcohol, and malt is very well balanced to make this a big, complex, interesting quad. This would be great for after a big dinner in the winter. I would even pair it with apple or pumpkin pie. The residual sweetness lingers as it warms up keeping it very drinkable.","Rudgers73","Feb 02, 2009"

Not as much residual sugar sweetness as some other American quads I have had recently. Some raisin-like fruitiness, but not as much as I expected. It does have an actual hop presence not found in many examples of the style. Pretty good, but quads are far from my favorite style.","twiggamortis420","Jan 31, 2009"

Head retention is average, not much lacing. The aroma is excellent, it smells like brown sugar, raisins, figs, cherries, Belgian yeast, rum, ginger and some pepper. The taste is slightly different than the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit, pepper, ginger, yeast, booze, cloves, and a slight tart taste I can't identify. There's also a bit of a bitter finish, which I didn't expect since the aroma was so sweet and malty. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and slick but seems a bit thin (but not watery) for the style. Carbonation is high.

At first it smelled of spiced rum, but as it warmed sweet dates and black cherries came out with a tinge of cinnamon and ginger. Clove phenols grow, but never overpower as the beer approaches room temperature. Very drinkable and rich in flavor. Something a bit different from your normal caramel-malt driven quad.

Enters the mouth with a pillow like soft creamy feel that rides a zesty carpet of even spicyness. Vanilla is big and sweet up front on the palate. Spice feel is a bit peppery but really very smooth.

It's cloudy copper brown with an active light tan head that starts very frothy & then settles into a thin creamy layer. The smell is cinnamon, raisins, sugar, with an appealing peachy flowery smell. It has a nice underlying chalky note. Taste is wonderful. It is peppery at first, with a nice biscuity malt, and then melts to a rich caramel. Maybe a touch one-dimensional on the finish but that one dimension is delicious. Maybe a bit too sweet in the aftertaste, but that's a nit to pick another day. The mouthfeel is chewy & a touch sticky, with nice carbonation throughout. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol just a pleasant warmth down the gullet. I'd definitely buy it again & its a welcome good example of the style from a US brewer. Evidence that not EVERY beer brewed in the US is brewed for hopheads.

Taste is fairly sweet in the front, flavor of cherry cordials, burnt sugar, some fruitiness, maybe some orange flavors that creep up and then disappear, some caramel, slightest hints of chocolate, some green hop character in the background, slightly spicy and peppery. Very complex, and that's definitely a good thing. Nice, creamy mouthfeel, but enough carbonation zip on the tongue that makes this one bright and extremely drinkable for the high ABV. Alcohol warming can be felt, but its fairly well hidden for the amount. A fantastic Belgian Style Quad.

4.4,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Wow, a surprisingly solid and well mannered Quad that looked, smelled, felt, and tasted like something right out of the Belgian realm from which it is to emulate. Great job by Boulevard on this one!","tavernjef","Jul 18, 2008"

3.44,-17.3,4,2.5,4,4,3,"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 2"" beige head above the cloudy orangey amber brew. Thick head lasts and lasts, with spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet, but overpowered by strong rubbing alcohol-ish character. Taste is also sweet to start, edging towards alcohol by the close, and plenty of warming action. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. The rubbing alcohol nose does last, however, and puts a damper on things.","ppoitras","Jul 10, 2008"

4.06,-2.4,5,4,4,4,4,"Perfect appearence. Deep ruby color with a full, long lasting head of a light tan. Fairly nice nose, with a lot of Belgian character. Plentiful dark fruits (cherries, dates, plums,) and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is loaded with tons of depth. Deep caramel and honey glaze, with dark fruits. It's a really nice beer and very Belgian. I think this series from Boulevard shows their brewing skill.","Crosling","Jul 07, 2008"

Strong carbonation with noticable alcohol to wipe most of the sweet of the palate. Leaves a dry residual chocolate in the aftertaste. Good drinkability now, I'll bet this one ages to become fantastic.","mentor","Jul 06, 2008"

4.13,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark amber brown with a huge tan head. Smells of alcohol and oak and a strong presence of sour cherries. Tastes of cinnamon, brown sugar, and a slight amount of earthyness. Not as dry as other Quad's but quite good. Mouthfeel is rich, with massive carbonation. Drinkability is quite good, especially for over 10 percent alcohol. An excellent American Quadrupel.","tronester","Jun 27, 2008"

3.88,-6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I find quad's to be a widely varying style but one I am drawn back to quite often. So, that said how's the boulevard offering? I found it ""quad subdued"". What the heck does that mean? It's got sweet caramel candied fruit malt aspects, a solid belgian yeast aspect, the right color and a sticky lacing head. It's also boozy and the flavors while blended well are more subdued than I would prefer in my quad. Worth a try.","barleywinebrewer","Jun 25, 2008"
4.47,7.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"This is the last of the Smokestack Series for me, and I can't imagine I would be any less impressed with this one than the previous three, but I better make sure. Pours a dark copper with some almost indiscernible streaks of red into a snifter. Has a huge foamy tan head that recedes in a dilatory fashion leaving little lacing behind. Has a robust and complex smell of raisins, figs and other dark fruits with some alcohol right behind mixed in with some big malts, caramel and toffee. Tastes is just as complex as the smell with some big malty creaminess, light chocolates, caramel, sweet bread, some grains, dark fruits, hops and some big alcohol heat bringing up the rear. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and smooth, but the big alcohol heat might be a turn off for some, although is welcomed to me. There is plenty of brisk carbonation to keep things exciting. All I can say is hell yeah!","stephens101","Jun 13, 2008"
3.78,-9.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Dark burgady ruby red blend. Big airy beige head is erected with the pour. It fizzles out fairly quickly, but a nice little frothy head has some staying power at the end. Decent nose, but overall, too sweet smelling. Blackberry Brandy comes to mind as does cherry juice and sweet rock candy. I think this is appropriate to an extent, but my nose tells me it's a little overdone. Let's proceed. First impressions on the palate are spicy, sweet, yeasty and alcoholic. This is not a bad take here on an extraordinary style. Brandy soaked figs with some plum and raisin. A little of that ""spiked punch"" feel to it. The alcohol is all over this, but never really off putting. Rum soaked fruits make their presence, like apple and melon. Light-medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. My only recommendation here is maybe a little less heat and a little less sweet. Overall though, this is a good beer.","Bighuge","Jun 04, 2008"

3.56,-14.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky brown color with some reddish hues. Big cream colored head with great retention and lots of lacing left behind. Aroma is alcohol, dark fruits, and spice. Taste is a bit boozy. Some funky yeast. Pretty spicy. A bit fruity with some pears and raisins. Mouthfeel is very thin in my opinion for a quad and it doesnt lend to the drinkability because of the high and noticeable alcohol. Not bad but certainly doesnt stack up to the trappists i've had.","hckyfn9999","May 20, 2008"

3.92,-5.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours dark red and orange with a strong 1/4 inch head. Average lacing. Nicely carbonated with a super sweet Belgium hoppy flowery citrus smell. The light hops balance well with the malts and Belgium yeast. It finishes with a lovely sweetness with just a hint bitterness. This is not a disappointment. Recommended!","ATLbeerDog","May 03, 2008"
4.08,-1.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"750ml bottle: Batch 68018: This one opened with a loud ""pop"". It poured with a large tan head on it, and was quite fizzy. The color was a hazy mahogany. The head dropped off rather quickly. The nose is good, but not as strong as I would have expected. Mainly bready and spicy, with traces of caramel and fruits. A bit of effervescence on the tongue. Not quite full bodied. It took a couple of sips to appreciate the taste. Subtle hints of different tastes, but they all blend well together. Nice.","Boto","May 02, 2008"
4.07,-2.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep ruby red/brown color. Smells of rich malty sweetness(apricots, prunes) some yeast and bread, subtle hop kick. Coarse head is intimidating but settles to a decent layer quickly and fed by very good carbonation. Tastes is somewhat complex. Lots of carbonation in there and in the finish. Tingles the tongue in the beginning. Transitions to a subdued malty sweetness. Finishes strong with a meddly of hops, carbonation, and alcohol that seems to go on forever. Nice body to it but seems to soften as it opens/warms up.","timbro81","May 01, 2008"
4.28,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This quadrupel is not overwhelming in its flavor. For people looking for a big, brash quadrupel, this might disappoint. Yet for those looking for a good, well-crafted, well-flavored, smooth Quad, this should satisfy. At $8 for the 22 oz. bottle it's a little pricey, but certainly enjoyable enough--and a bit boozy enough--to ultimately overlook (or plainly forget) the price in favor of the flavor. Definitely recommended.","Gehrig","Apr 15, 2008"
