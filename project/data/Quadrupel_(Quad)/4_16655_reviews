"Quadruple delicious. Love this beer."
"Very smooth quad.  This is a great easy drinking sipper of a quad."
""
""
"Been meaning to try this for close to 4 years now (no pun intended).  This is a really spectacular beer.  Dark fruits abound.  A great yeasty quality that doesn't appear often in american versions of the style.  Beautiful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very tasty quad. Worth seeking out. Allagash is so good at these Belgian styles."

"Perfect brew to open up for Juno.  750ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash chalice.  2014 vintage.  Pours somewhere between cider and mahogany in color with a slight haze to the clarity and a rocky, two inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Nose is somewhat subdued - figs and yeast. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a faint medicinal quality and a trace of something metallic towards the back.  Mouthfeel is medium-light with an easy, even carbonation.  Overall, a decent Quad but the pricepoint ($18.49) and overall character isn't on par with the exemplars of the style (e.g. St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 10, etc.)."

"Pours dark Amber with a strong smell. Strong beer but very tasty and malty. Drinkable ... Perhaps too drinkable for the 9oz pour! Great beer from Allagash"
""
""
""
"Overall: Well-balanced, yet complex, refreshing, yet rich. Practically perfect, and yet there is just a tad bit lacking. This beer is light and bright for a quad, and would benefit from a bit more heft."

"Fantastic balance and great, bubbly mouthfeel. Superb beer."

"O: Allagash Four is a very complex beer, but overly so, and the shotgun approach to flavors hurt the overall package as the flavors are all over the place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great interplay between four malts, four hops (albeit not as noticeable) and four yeasts. The complexity is high and the numerous flavors just seem balance out into a great final package. Way to drinkable for a 10% BSDA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL : I'll up the score on this because it's frankly a very good beer - it's just not at all what a Quad should be in my books. I'd have another one of these anyday."

"O: A nice American quad with quite a bit of complexity and depth. It makes for a nice sipper in the colder months. Definitely on the drier and less sweet side of the spectrum, but that only allows for more complexity. Would definitely benefit with some age, but it's also fine fresh. Give it a go"

"I should have sat on this one for a while but that being said its still drinking well today, something I'd look for in the future and I could see it aging gracefully"

"Dare I say, I perfer this over Three Philsophers. This surely packs more complexity and has that wonderful nose. It also is really quite easy drinking, which is dangerous for a 10% ABV quad. One of the few American examples of a quad that I both find interesting, but amazing."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a deep, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a short stacked, frothy, filmy, off-white head that settles into a sparse, filmy coating. Aromas of subtle spicing and a rich, bready backbone of old world fruit and toasted bread. Boozy highlights throughout the nose, also. This one smells rich and solid. Flavors are rich and roasted, with a nutty backbone supporting fig and black cherry sweetness. Tart and rich throughout, with a fruit sugar base that is enduring from start to finish. Spicing comes out as the beer warms. Pepper, basil, oregano, nutmeg, and clove, amongst other spices. You could sit all day and pick apart the intricacies of this one. Amazing. The body is smooth throughout, but avoids overpowering. The aftertaste is boozy, with highlights of roasted notes and old world fruit sweetness. Smooth, clean finish with only a hint of sweet linger. Just enough to entice you back for another sip. Solid, big, bold beer. Very tasty."

"O: This beer aged really well, it picked up some definite hints as if it had been barrel aged over the years and I think the sweetness has increased and it has mellowed overall. Very enjoyable, can't believe I let this one cellar so long before reviewing it."

"Overall - It's really a good beer, but it has its faults."
"O: The flavors here are decent, but I could use more dark fruits and a bit more complexity. The esters are a bit harsh and do not mix that well with the maltiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Allagash has a rare miss on its hands with this. The $16 price adds to the disappointment."
""
""
""
""
"This is a plush, fruity, estery, juicy beer. There are some spices that lend balance and offer depth. The ABV is really well hidden making this a dangerously drinkable beer. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"O: add this to my list of Allagash awesomeness - my review numbers may be a little misleading if you're thinking typical quad - this is an atypical quad (IMO) - my impression of the beer was that it tasted as much like an English old ale or strong ale as much as a ""traditional"" quad (such a St. Bernardus or a Pannepot). I loved the flavor and feel, very complex and elegant. Very classy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a lingering aftertaste"
""
"O-I had hopes that this would be my first excellent quad as Allagash has proven they can knock out a Belgian style (see Allagash White and Tripel) but like other US Brewers miss the complexity deliciousness exemplified by St. Bernardus Abt 12 and Westy XII. This beer needs work. Average compared to US versions I've tried, below average compared to Belgians."

"Overall, disappointing. I am an Allagash fan and a Quad fan, but this one doesn't really do it for me."
"O-Very disappointing to have just an average brew from a great brewery and a great style. I will choose either dubbel, curieux or white over this in a heartbeat, but it was nice to try."
"Poured from tap at alewife, baltimore into tulip. Pours a deep amber haze with a bit of head. Nice belgian malt aromas, banana and clove dominate. Taste is very similar; belgian banana, clove, booze, maybe a sweet sugary honey or molasses and dried fruit. Super easy drinker here...I could chug this 10%abv all day. Its got a great flavour but really is basic in a way. Nonetheless...great brew, and I'd have again. Wonder how it would age???"

"O - Overall, this beer was a bit too one note for my liking, which is a shame as I held onto this for so long."
""
""
"Sweet malts appear at first in the taste with a higher than expected bitterness that gives off a boozy character which kicks in more prominently, tears into my sinuses, and opens the passageway. Yet it mellows almost as quickly as it explodes leaving a dryer, lingering finale in its wake."
""
""
"Overall a solid quad but nothing mind-blowing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice malts and sweet flavors, belgian flavors, but not as great as I remember, bit boozy too."
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer really, but I think Allagash does some better beers. For the price point, Allagash Couriex is a better choice in my opinion. Just a lot of flavors that I seem to be missing judging by the label, and the body doesn't quite have enough mmmph to back it all up."

"Low B-"
"originally reviewed on: 10-24-2010"
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours amber-brown with a moderate white head and light lacing that lasts well throughout. Nose is a little earthy/herby for the style, but with plenty of brown sugar, maple syrup, belgian yeast, and some alcohol heat. Flavor is more typical of quads with rich, sweet breadiness, and yeast on the front, fading to fruit and alcohol in the backfinish. Sticky mouthfeel. A very nice quad!"
"A nice enough beer, but can't really call it a standout in the Allagash portfolio."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent beer which I will drink again in the near future."

"Amazing overall taste! Adding this to one of my favorites."

"Certainly a delicious spin on a quad. Two thumbs up. 4.5"

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark red-orange amber. Gushed out of the bottle. Very thick light tan head that persisted and left heavy lacing. Nice presentation. Aroma is sweet with heavy stone fruit, light malt and Belgian spicing; slightly sour. Flavor of sweet and caramel malt and light fruit. Moderately dry in the middle. Finishes with Belgian spices, a bit of hops and sweet fruit. Nice medium to heavy body. Not as intense or complex as the best Belgian quads, but pleasant and very nice to drink. Another top notch Allagash ale."
"750 ml bottle purchased at the Charleston Beer Exchange. The appearance of this beer is outstanding. Poured into a tulip glass the beer has a thick creamy persistent head. The color of the beer is a gorgeous reddish orange. The nose is cherries, apples, and a hint of clove. The taste is predominantly a pleasantly sour fruit mostly cherry and apple. The hops are subtle. These are definitely not west coast hops! The 10% ABV is very well hidden, almost no burn. This is a very smooth and mild quad. It is much lighter and not as vinous as a Westvleteren. This beer really tastes like a saison ale to me. The only negative is a slightly thin body and mouthfeel. However, at 750 ml, you better share this one! I highly recommend this complex beer. I will drink it again."

"750 ml bottle into tulip, batch 18(2008 bottling I think). Pours very hazy dark red color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, banana, caramel, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Nice aromas with big fruitiness. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toasted malt, molasses, candi sugar, biscuit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, toffee, dark fruit, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 10%, with hardly any warming after the finish present. Very smooth and drinkable, but it is still a sipper. Overall this is an outstanding Belgian Quad with tons of great flavor and balance. I would definitely have this again."
"This one is a must have. My local bottle shop has it regularly and I get a bottle probably once every two or three months. One of my favorite beers."
"The beer is a beautiful color of dark amber. It has a lightly colored thin somewhat flimsy head and a nice stream of carbonation climbing the sides of the glass. It has a delicious aroma. Fruity esters strike the nose first, followed by a small amount of bitter hops...all pleasant. The beer has a nice full mouthfeel, that warms the stomach nicely. It has a nice and original flavor from the darkened hops. Makes me think of nicely toasted grains that mix nicely with the esters that seem to dominate the later taste characteristics. Very good. Been holding onto this bottle far too long."

"Enjoyed this one on tap at Delaney's. Amber-red color with a tan head; almost looked like a sour based on the color I'm used to. Spicy aroma, a little bitter. Malty taste, a little bit sweet, but certainly not as cloying and raisin-like as I've tasted in some other quad's I've tried. Drank quite easily; not as heavy as many in the style. Very enjoyable offering."
"O: A nice quad, though very sweet. Definitely one you'd want to sip, not gulp. That said, Allagash has some better offerings. It's pricey, too, so it's a once-in-a-while for when you want something a bit different."
"Overall: A solid beer. Not overly impressive but seems to carry several of the distinct attributes of belgian-style beers. A little more bitter than I would have hoped."
"Pours a dark amber color, with a nice two finger cocoa head. Good carbonation and lacing on my snifter. The head is very pillow-like in appearance, and sticks around for a long time. Nose is yeast, malt, hops, caramel, dark fruit, and spices. Really nice nose on this brew- it could easily pass for a Belgian Quad on the smell. Taste is good, but not quite up to the smell. This is definitely one of the smoothest, malty, drinkable Quads I've ever had. The hops are hidden, but you get some of them in the taste. The 10% ABV is there w/ a little bit of alcohol burn on the aftertaste- it's pretty mellow though. Feel is silky smooth and sweet, with the hop bitterness barely there. Overall, this is a very enjoyable Quad. Definitely in the top 3 or 4 American Quads I've had (off the top of my head). Definitely worth picking up. Cheers."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Churchkey. Reddish brown pour without much head. Malty smell, not boozy and not a lot of dark fruits on this one, light and malty. The dark fruits and booze come thru more on the taste. Which is pretty dry. Light body with sort of a weird aftertaste. Carbonated well. A bit off-putting overall. Not a great quad. Too malty, too strange tasting."
"Pours a hazy honey-gold color with a 1/2 inch beige head that settles to a film. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruits, spices, and yeast aromas. Taste is pretty much the same with a spicy flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crip but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid quad with lots of nice aromas and flavors."
"(D)- Not what I was expecting. Seems either past its prime or just disjointed and heavy. Became very sweet the longer it sat in the glass too."
"D: A perfect balanced Quad, I enjoyed this one very much!"
"(O) This was odd. I wasn't too thrilled with it. I think they could have just used 1 type of yeast and one decent fermentation. The novelty aspect of the beer is great but the execution and final product was less than satisfying."
"Overall, disappointed."
"Doesn't quite compare to some of the great Abbey and Trappist Quads, but the Allagash holds it own. Probably the best American-made Quad I've had. Some more bready, toffeish malt flavors, and this stuff would be fantastic."
"FOUR THE WIN"
"MF/O: Thick body, velvety, creamy feel, finishes a little sweet with hints of candied dark fruit"
"Overall drinkability is good. Alcohol was warming as i am assuming this is a young batch. Very tasty, nice job by Allagash!"
"I like this one, but probably not enough to pony up the $$ this one usually goes for."
"Medium body on this one with slightly prickly carboantion. Overall a pretty well made quad. Lots of ingredients seems to make for an interesting beer on here."
"This beer seems to do better with age. Maybe I should wait a full FOUR years for consistency, but this is about as good a domestic version of this difficult style as you could hope for."
"Poured out in a wineglass this beer is deep ambercoloured. To say this is a quad...i am not sure if it deserves this type. For the rest this is a very good and very drinkable beer with a nice foamy head"
"O - Not bad, but not at all memorable. Definitely an example of bigger not being better!"
"This brew poured out as a brownish orange color with a tan foamy head. The smell of the beer had a mix of sweet and sour aromas. The taste was pretty much just like the nose but was mostly on the sour side. The mouthfeel was decent. I thought this beer sounded pretty awesome but after having it I wasn't all that impressed with it. I was pretty bummed out actually I thought would have been better."
"O: A far cry from the quality I've come to expect from Allagash. The beer is poorly balanced and overly alcoholic. With a mouthfeel inconsistent with the style's big dogs, this beer nearly disappoints. Last time I will buy this one."
"O: Good stuff but too expensive and frankly too sweet for my palate. Also I find it to be over carbonated to the point of hurting its score."
"Lighter mid body with a soft carbonation. Dangerously easy drinking. Cost prevents me from drinking much Allagash, but this is good stuff."
"It's impressive, no doubt about that, but it's definitely a sipping beer. Food pairings (brie? possibly steak?) are possible, but this is a powerful standalone."
"Narrative: His polished leather heels clicked lightly on the linoleum floor, waiting, with knowing expectations of his own ability. ""The same magazines every time, far below my interests, yet beyond my ability to resist-"" he reached forward and thumbed lazily through a copy of ""OUTDOOR MONTHLY"" noting esoteric information about tent liners. This wasnt his first job interview, but his resume made it clear that he was overqualified, so why was he here, filling a middle management role? It was not for want of ambition, for after all, he prepared 4 times as long as most other candidates. Nor was it for want of character, his euphemisms and passing comments regailed even the most dourfaced water cooler circles. ""Glade plug ins, figures, quite the way to garnish the first foyer that expectant clients will encounter."" No, it was his robust complexity that was his own undoing, the sheer force of his resume that created expectations that he could not fill and pretentions that filled the void. There was a condescending upshot to the end of his sentences that connoted that all parties present should have known what he said beforehand. ""HoW long did THEY HAPPEN t0... SAY?"" He requested of the overqualified intern, equally nonplussed with the generic waiting room. It was his content that wowed, but his overall presentation, the custom tailored suit, the wry witticisims that ultimately cost him that job. It did not matter, in his mind he knew that he was four times as qualified as the other candidates. It was that personal victory that carried the day."
"I enjoyed the four, but it wasn't what I expected. If it were a little heavier I think I would have gotten more of the ""4X"" approach and would have been able to taste more of the yeasts and hops they emphasize so much."
"This beer pours a copper color with a nice off white head. the smell is spicey slightly sweet and malty with a small alcohol tinge to it. the flavor follows the smell with the spice and malt in the front with a little alcohol in the finish. the mouthfeel is medium body with good carbonation. overal this beer is good would drink again but its a littel pricey."
"Overall: A very nice beer that was a hit with the family. The ABV is very well hidden. A top notch brew."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but doesn't finish quite as dry as expected. Overall, a different take on the Quad but certainly one worth trying."
"Pours a seethru red-tinged copper with bubbly head that died quick and left no lace. The first I notice in the aroma is the yeast...it definitely comes out. There's also that candy, sugary aroma (though mild) as well as that faint citric hop aroma. Thicker and fuller-bodied, chewey even, the beer is greatly balanced. Also prickly with great carbonation, the sticky heaviness of the beer is countered and not murkey. I pick up sweet malts like candy sugar and some bready malts as well. Also picking up some tartness like cherry and a hint of citric hop flavoring. Fines nice and smooth and plush, ABV minimized, so it feels like I'm drinking a great fruit and sweet ale that is heavy and crisp and real easy to drink. A real treat."
"D: A great quad, but if youre looking for a more ""in-your-face," or heavy quad, look elsewhere. Well done, Allagash."
"Note: Batch #23"
"D - this might be slightly past its peak, but still held together quite well. scents and flavors are well meshed but get lost a bit. alcohol is completely gone, making this quite dangerous. a bit different for the style but still a well made brew."
"A definite beast of a beer and still it does a much better job at masking the alcohol content than a lot of 10's out there, I compare this one to a Trappistes Rochefort 10, only smoother and without the phenolic bite. Dangerously drinkable! I've finished 25cl so far and as I wrap up this review, I'm already too impaired to go grab another bottle. I guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to get more. An awesome quad that stands up in its class to the likes of St. Bernardus 12 and the rest of the 1st class Belgian Quads! If you're into Belgian Stong Darks/Quads and the spicy complexity that comes along with 'em, this is a must try brew! I give it an A+"
"Excellent camouflage of the ABV. Well-balanced and somewhat flavorful, but not really a shining example of a quad. Still, the beer went down quickly and easily, so points for that."
"D: This was good, but to justify $14.99, it ought to be amazing."
"Pours a dark amber, with a nice 1 inch white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is malty with hints of dried fruits and Belgian yeast. Flavor continues, with some rasins, malts and nice begian funk. There is also a nice little hop bite in there that makes this a unique take on this style. I found this a very easy drinker with good complex flavors thruout. I just wish the pricetag was a little smaller."
"D: This is an exquisite take on the Quad from stateside. I have another batch 16 in the cellar which I look forward to opening in another year or two."
"jd"
"Wow - Allagash has some world class brews. This may be the best quad I have had. It is different than any other quad I have had, and this is what makes it stand out. Tremendous stuff."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being above average. Drinkability is decent, it had a lot of flavor to it for sure. It showed a lot of spice to it, but a little of the malty sweetness came through. Pretty good beer overall."
"D - Goes down well for a 10% er....almost too easy....worthy of another purchase forsher."
"Loved it."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a murky dark orange with a thin khaki head that slowly diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of sweet dried fruits with a hint of leather and very mild spice. The taste is loads of smooth dried fruit with a nice touch of caramel malts and Belgian spice. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with smooth carbonation. This is a great draft Belgian style beer, one I would certainly have on-tap again if I get the opportunity."
"I had this on tap at the high street grill, poured into a small goblet. The pour is amber/ orange with a slight white head. The aroma is sweet with dark fruit, hint of alcohol. The flavor is sweet with dates, maybe some citrus and it finishes with a very light alcohol. Four is full in body, and well carbonated for the style. A very enjoyable quad."
"D- The spicy yeast flavors overshadowed everything in this one for me from the getgo, so I didn't particularly enjoy it. Flavorwise this reminds me of a Belgian strong pale. Some hops are present upfront, but the maltiness is lacking here. The different flavors just never jived for me enough to really enjoy this. Unfortunately not worth the high price tag."
"This is very drinkable for a Quad. I split the bottle, but could have sacrificed the evening and drank the whole thing!!!"
"Overall, this is an OK brew. I really like the other brews I've had from this brewery and this is among my favorite styles, so maybe my expectations were too high. Certainly worth trying, but not in the same class as Chimay Blue or Ommegang 3 Philosophers."
"The flavor is slightly sweet along with some mild dark fruits and a bit of light caramel taste. A slight amount of bread crust. Mouthfeel is a bit light with low-ish levels of carbonation. Interesting and nothing wrong, but doesn't quite hit the mark."
"Poured a hazy brown with reddish highlights that had a finger of head and left quite a bit of frothy lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was nice consisting of the signature belgian yeast that comes with the quad style plus citrus character, light fruit notes and some vinous notes that make me think it could have some tartness on the palate. The taste did have some tart flavor but I'm not sure if they were from grapes alogside the belgian yeast, light spice, malts, and very mild hop presence. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slight spice, malty, and tart finish. It drank really good and was enjoyed by some non beer geek heads."
"A really nice Belgian Quad. I can't decifer the various yeasts/malts/hops that make up this treat, but it all works in my opinion. Definitely a ""lighter"" tasting Quad as far as dark grains/mouthfeel goes but this is a really nice sipper. It may not be tremendously assertive early on but holds its own very enticingly as it progresses."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for 10% abv, overall really enjoyable but a little pricey for what it is."
"A nice beer - definitely not really a quad. The flavor, particularly with the yeast, can be a bit strong. Not my favorite, style-wise, but it is nicely done for sure."
"medium-plus bodied, creamy mouthfeel. probably not one you'd want to suck down all night, but drinkable enough."
"This is a must try beer, not as a quad or a tripel or any style in particular but just as a unique and well crafted brew."
"Drinkability: Pretty high, despite the high ABV (and I say this as someone who is not a particular fan of the style)."
"Had on tap at gingerman. Out of the gate beauty. Builds in the glass like a guiness. Deep amber that fades in shades from darker to light top to bottom. Hardly any detectable nose at all. Subtle fruit in the cherry grape vein. The flavor is different for a quad. Much softer. Much thinner buts leaves a nice refreshing tingle in my mouth. Taste is very fruitpunch with spices. Unique and the alchohol is pretty nicely blended but there for sure. Happy with this offering from allagash, not what i typically look for in a quad but very tasty none-the-less"
"Drinkability: Incredible for a 10% quad"
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into Gouden Carolus chalice. The bottle is marked Batch #21 and was purchased earlier today. The beer has a large foamy head colored off white. The liquid appears to be a few shades of brown mixed together; I'm tempted to call it tan, or deep copper, or burnt orange, but really it is none of these. There is a lot of carbonation rising within my glass. Lacing appears to be fairly even. The beer has a very interesting, robust aroma. The malts really get to me. There's a touch of sweet, a touch of spice and a touch of alcohol. It reminds me a lot of this beer's Belgian inspirations, but I also picture a pine cone as I inhale. It truly is a Maine Quad. The beer tastes a big spicier than I expected. The finish is especially peppery. The light and dark candi sugars add a subtle sweetness that is very good. The pepper and alcohol linger a bit and leave a warm coating. It is full bodied and feels thick. The carbonation can be readily felt. A mildly sweet and equally sticky film is left upon my lips. I'm enjoying this beverage, but will do so at a slow pace. Perhaps it is best suited split with three of your friends, but I'll be able to consume it all myself over the next couple of hours. It is a beer I would drink again, but there are other Allagashes and Quads that I prefer."
"Good drinkability and very enjoyable.  I had this one down in the cellar and just forgot about it.  I was digging around looking for some treats to enjoy the week before GABF and found this little treasure.  Ages well and is a great interpretation on the style. "
"For a quad I will say that it was tasty enough to grab a second glass. The flavor was more than enough to accompany a fine cigar for desert. I often grab this brew when I am in the mood for a fine American Quad. I believe this one is the finest brewed on this side of the pond"
"D: Well this beer is very enjoyable...but at 10% is not something that can be downed quickly. Overall the 750 bottle took me about 45 minutes to work through...but I enjoyed every sip"
"d - A nice quad. Very malty but enjoyable. Would try again."
"D: Not bad, will have to cellar a bottle for a while and see if the heat subsides."
"D - This beer is hard to judge, it is not as dark in malt character as some other examples of the style and seems to lose some of its potential complexity as a result, but it is very well balanced and there is a smoothness to the flavor and to the yeast character in particular that speaks of careful bottle conditioning. The malt character is mostly layers of caramel with a hint of brown sugar and molasses and the yeast is mostly spicy notes rather than the dark fruit I expected. This works fairly well and does not become medicinally phenolic the way spicy yeast character often does in dark Belgian beer styles. In a way, it seems more like a very strong dubbel than a quad/dark strong. It is not the most interesting Quad that I have ever had, but it has a balance and poise that I would normally only expect from a beer made by a Belgian brewery and have almost never seen in an American brewed example of the style."
"Served on: July 18, 2010"
"It seems I always have bad luck with big beers that develop depth in the bottle when I have them on tap. What I had today at the bar was awful, which particularly disappointed me because I've had Allagash Four before, and it's good in the bottle."
" Complexity is high and if you like a big malty quad this will be to our likking, but it's off balance and rather strange to me. Sip, slow share with friends and maybe your closest enemy."
"D: sippable, only because of the alcohol is noticeable"
"Drinkability: This one is dangerously drinkable in that it is quite enjoyable and that the 10% ABV shows up mostly in its warming effects. It is also worth repeating because it is a very complex beer with lots of things going on that make it hard to pin down all the aromas and flavors as they come and go from sip to sip and as the beer warms. I'll definitely be revisiting this beer--a nice treat."
"Drinkability is pretty nice. Interesting quad all around."
"Full bodied, highly drinkable. A solid brew."
"D: An excellent Belgian Strong Dark... doesn't taste muddled at all, which is surprising coming from such a complicated malt, hop, and yeast bill."
"""I've got a Nikkon camera; I love to take photographs..."" That's right, I'm jammin' to some Paul Simon as I'm enjoyin' this quad. Though this brew may not have the greens of summer, it has an indescribable amount of shades of brown and red, earth tones galore; Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away, 'cause I wanna take a pic o' this lovely collection o' hues. Above the colors floats a scent mostly composed of sweetness: straight granulated sugars, some brown sugar, maybe even some candy sugar. A bit o' yeastiness makes itself known as well. All's I know is that this smell is as sweet as the punch (like the Association's narrator's empty cup...look it up...). It's not all sweet, though, as along comes Mary...in the form of miscellaneous grains (there was a hint in there for the prior reference...too subtle?). My tongue also finds some sweetness, but it is toned down a great degree compared to the nose. The grains lead you along now, not unlike Crispian St. Peters (you can always tell when my iTunes is on shuffle whilst I review). Only this pipe leads to a varied taste sensation that hides hints of banana, clove (ah, Belgium...), vanilla, and some o' that sugar that was so omnipresent in the nose. Though ""four"" was the theme during brewing, more than four flavors play together, riding down the highway that is life (damn you, Tom Cochrane, for making me force that reference!). Admittedly, I expected a more syrupy brew when I sniffed the surface. What I get instead is a nice, fairly effervescent, medium-bodied Belgian stew. And I mean that in as good a way as possible. I want more of this, but I'm sure this bomber will be more than enough after I've driven it all night long (once again, I ahake my fist at the aforementioned Mr. Chochrane...)."
"Taste: Sweet caramel malts with intense fresh pear and some lemon acidity meet up with slightly bitter plum skin. Melds into honey whose sweetness is slightly offset by carbonated bitterness and some spice reminiscent of black pepper and nutmeg. Spices are well integrated into the foundation of the beer - not distinct but very complex. Some yeastiness as it warms, too - but there is an odd bubble gum note that comes up too which was slightly unpleasant. Finish is fairly crisp, bready malts, a hint of alcohol and general fruitiness. Definitely not one of those super sweet quads and no sign of the ABV."
"Tried this beer last night with dinner. I don't think I paired it very well, would have been better on its own. At any rate, it poured a nice caramel color with a head that quickly disappeared. The smell was sweet.. of sugar, honey, grapefruit, peach, and maybe cinnamon. Taste was much like Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde.. almost an exact match! It was highly drinkable.. taste was of honey/sugar, caramel, raisin, clove, and had some ""Belgain"" spice to it. It changed somewhat as it warmed. It was good, I'd have it again."
"Rich, smooth, complex, and balanced. A deluxe, exquisite treat."
"Notes: Maybe not a favorite from the Allagash big bottles but it is still very good quality. Early on it has a bit of a shy presence but lingers with a rich personality and great drinkability."
"A deep brown amber color well populated with little floaters and a decent white cover and good lacing. The aroma is a very pleasant spicey malt and brown sugar mash. The taste is a tart malt concoction of apple cider and a touch of clove. Very fine carbonation, medium-light bodied, smooth but lively and plenty drinkable. It has a luscious feel, velvetty and clean. There's a hint of citrus bite on the edges with a touch of bubblegum sweetness. It's another quality brew. This should be worthy of a try for any beer lover. Not a typical Belgian type in my mind, a bit different. Definitely enjoyable."
"D- This brew will knock you on your ass so you better sip it. You feel like you could down it in 10 minutes but slow it down."
"D: Very nice sipping beer if you can look past the predominant alcohol flavors. Might even consider aging this beer longer."
"Overall, not impressed here. First of all, this may be made like a quad, but its no quad. Even if I can get past the improrper making of a great style, its just not a great tasting beer anyway."
"D - goes down nicely"
"Pours a semi-translucent honey golden with a thick, fine-bubbled, pale yellow-cream head. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and slightly sweet. Richly fruity flavor has hints of yeast, malt and honey - quite tasty. Lively, tingly, fizzy, sassy texture leaves a nice honey-sweet but not cloying finish."
"Overall I thought this beer was a bit better with more active carbonation, except in regards to the mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Overall, a good attempt at an American interpretation for the style. Still, this beer could be improved greatly. Probably will pass on this one if I'm looking for a quad."
"This is a very delicious and enjoyable ale, but at $18.50 for 750 ml I won't be knocking one down every night."
"One of my favorite styles and this is one of the premier examples. Excellent cap to my night."
"Overall, a nice creative quad. My only criticism is that the hops and rum notes clash a little in the overall flavor profile. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability? Not too shabby for how strong this is. I think the fact that it *is* so tasty helps a lot. A very nice brew indeed."
"Thanks Casey!"
"D= I love this brewery and had huge expectations for this beer so I am struggling to not let that color my review. This was a well made beer for sure and quite drinkable for the ABV but it lacked the WOW factor I was expecting after reading the ingredients list."
"I had no idea that this was a quad. The appearance is very deceiving. I would have expected it to be much darker like Unibroue La Terrible or Koningshoeven La Trappe Quad. Overall this was a beautiful bier. I believe it ages very well."
"Cheers!"
"I'm starting to give up on Church Key's cask offerings - they never seem carbonated right (I know it's supposed to be ""natural," but something seems to get lost in the translation) or served at the right temperature. Possibly I'm just not used to it, but this is another supposedly excellent beer that I've found quite mediocre in this medium. Either way, this poured a deep amber color with no head and nothing in the way of film, lacing, or anything. Nose is nice: citrus, caramel, candy, yeast. Flavor is likewise, with a little more alcohol and chocolate and some more of that quad spice that you expect. Feel is mediocre - too thin, too low on the carbonation to be really good. Overall, just didn't do it for me. I might try it out of the bottle if I can find it at the right price."
"D - nice quad in every respect - while no session beer it's easy & enjoyable to quaff"
"D: A wonderful brew, especially on cask."
"Overall this is a very good beer I would not mind drinking another one of these."
"Notes: Allagash has captured the right balance of the yeast, malt and minimal hops in a classic Quad taste that any brewer within Belgium would and should be proud of. I consider this and Three Philosophers to be good examples of American brewers ability to produce excellent Belgian Ales."
"drinkability: not a good belgian at all, it's hard to mess them up too."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Batch 16. Aroma is of raisins, figs, dates and sweet malts. Taste follows pretty closely the aromas and is also moderately sweet, warming and slightly sour on the back of the tongue. Tremendously smooth to drink at 10%, the alcohol is very well hidden by the lovely flavors and sweetness of the malts and the belgian yeast. A stellar beer and a very special treat. A great ""transitional beer"" for people that don't normally drink good beer, also."
"As large as the head was, the beer is not that carbonated which I really appreciate. The beer is not that thick in the mouthfeel, making it easy to drink. At 10 percent, this is very drinkable and could be dangerous since you can't taste any of the alcohol. A great beer."
"Had on tap at Great Lost Bear. Its actually fairly hazy in the glass, a big turn on for me. This beer actually blew my mind. It is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the privilege of drinking. Fairly sweet, but with a cutting edge that managed to quickly dispel any and all other flavors. Smooth, yet not overpowering, the alcohol is really well masked here. Definitely a beer worth buying again."
"D - This is a really great quad. Great flavors and aromas."
"D- easy to get to the bottom of this bottle but its a little strong to consider another. glad i tried this. allagash never lets me down."
"750ml corked and caged, batch #19 and a heck of a way to start the weekend. Poured into a chalice glass, dark caramel and an active light tan head. Steady stream of bubbles up the center to reinforce the troop losses up top. Settles down to a creamy texture. Smells of orange sherbet, raisins, and cinnamon. Tastes like heaven. With boobs. Slightly burnt caramel up front, then tastes like those orange creme candies your grandmother always had in a cut-glass dish. Finishes with a sharp, woody note that makes me thirsty for more. Wow! Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, assertively bubbly up front and then a touch oily and almost sticky. Its got a body to stand up to the carbonation. Very drinkable. It has an alcohol warmth but it only hints at the 10% the label promises. Very sippable and sip I shall. I'm going to do less typing and more drinking now."
"Overall: A good quad, but not amazing. Good but not as good as the real thing from those delightful trappists IMO."
"D- One sweet and complex American quad here. Congrats to Allagash.. they've pulled off a great example of a quad and it only took having to 4x everything."
"Opened a bottle of FOUR with my wife on our fourth wedding anniversary (get it?). Poured into Ommegang Three Philosopher chalices. Dark, cloudy orange color, almost cider-like appearance. Not a whole lot of carbonation. Slight white head formed. Spicy and floral smell. Taste was a bit different for a quad. It had that sugary characteristic and a dried plum flavor to it, but it also had a faint hop bite to it. This I did not expect, but I ended up liking this twist. Even though this bottle has been aged for about a year, there was still a bit of a hot alcohol note present. Very smooth beer to drink though. Paired well with a chocolate torte. This is a worthwhile beer to try, merely because it is a very unique American expression of a classic Belgian style."
"Glad I had the chance to try this, not sure I'll seek it out again.."
"Body a bit thin for the style. Good stuff, perhaps closer to a BSDA."
"This is a really good beer. It pretty much follows what a Quad should be. Like most beers of this style though, a bit to dry for my tastes. Still something I would recommend, and definitely worth a try."
"D: One to share a bottle of or sip on after dinner. WOuld probably go well with a plate of gouda cheese and rye crackers. I had one oyster with it and it didn't compliment as well as I'd hoped. Oh well, still fine crating and a good version of the style. Dare I say better than Ommegang?"
"A spectacular beer. Truly wonderful to this palate. The balance is spot-on and it's full of flavor. The best description I can put to word is that when you take a sip, and the full sensory experience manifests as a tangible feeling on my tongue and subsequently registers electronically in my brain, it is euphoric; this is felt at first sip and last sip, and each sip in between (the 10% tends to help the euphoria near the end)."
"This beer pours a cloudy red color. There is no head to speak of. The aroma is dates, star anise, cardamom, and a soft sweet maltiness. It is a very delicate aroma for such a large beer, but it works. The taste is more powerful than the aroma, but just as complex. There is an abundance of spices, and malt. Nothing really stands out, and that is was stands out in this beer. If I think about tasting a certain aspect of taste, then take a sip, I taste that aspect. If I think about another, the same thing happens. This really is a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is of the smoothest silk imaginable. The carbonation is light and fine. Overall, this is a very nice beer. I'm not sure if I'd call it the best Quad I've yet tasted, but it is up there."
"Just finished another bottle 9/1/10. I agree with my previous rating. Excellent beer. Plan to buy another for the cellar."
"This strikes me as a very American quadrupel, taking the subtle fruity complexity of a Belgian quad and ratcheting it up to the next extreme level. It is a little much for me."
"D: I could enjoyably sip this beer, especially paired with the Gouda. I definitely needed help finishing the big bottle though."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is creamy, soft carbonated and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is light. This is a very tasty quad, although I can distinguish the different malts and hops. The beer is well rounded and made well, what else do you expect from Allagash."
"This is a very good beer. You can almost taste all four fermentation periods with each sip, no just kidding. Pours a very dark brown, with almost no head but then again who really needs to fight through a good one to get to the beer. Am I right or what? I wonder if anyone will respond. Ok, sorry tangent and back to the beer. Does leave a nice layer of film on the glass. The nose is very good and complex. Scents of plums and sugars. Very sweet in taste as well. The malts really out play the hops in this one. The bottle says the score is 4 malts to 4 hops, but it tastes more like 8 to 1 in favor of the malts. Taste has some diactyl in it, but for the most part its sweet like sugar with a little fruitiness. Tastes more like grapes even though there is plums in the nose. Feels very good going down. Surprisingly a medium body with not a lot of resistance by the throat. Enjoy this one!"
"For a 10%er, suprisingly easy to handle. Hides the % very well."
"750 bottle- pours an opaque caramel colour with a one finger off white head and fair lacing. Nose- toffee, fruit- very sweet smelling. Taste- raisins, brown sugar spice and other dark fruits. Very creamy texture and moderate carbonation. One of the more drinkable quads I've had. I think this bottle has a few years on it, so didn't notice the booze heat that others have remarked on. Quite smooth. Not the most complex quad out there, but still a solid drink."
"Pours a medium brown colored body, with a white head, diminishing. Clear. Strong fruity aroma, grape but not wine-y. Sweet craemy mouthfeel. Grape taste. Honey sweet taste. Carbonated, soft mouthfeel. Some hops, but very hidden."
"Overall very, very solid and definitley a fine example of the style. I would have no issues at all with having this one every day. And to be honest it looks as though the age has mellowed it quite nicely."
"D: This is a good quad, but it reminds me of Three Philosophers, which is half the cost and pretty much twice the value. I really don't see myself paying $17 to grab this again."
"D: Very, very tasty and impressively complex. Lots and lots going on here. Drinkability is nice as well. It manages a fairly hoppy balance for the style, considering all of the different sugary flavors that are at work. I found this for $6 for a 750mL bottle - well worth the price."
"This is a fun bear to be appreciated,the complexity of the flavor outshines any alcohol, meaning if you come across this on tap, sit and stay a while."
"An outstanding beer that is extremely drinkable."
"Overall a very good American quad."
"M/D: this is a surprising easy drinker and won't show its brash high abv side a very good beer all in all"
"Drinkability: A sipper not a session beer. Allagash has done it again - another great addition to a stellar collection."
"D: Not too bad. The sediment is a big barrier to some, but the balanced texture and the relatively well-hidden 10% ABV help. Sour flavor hurts a bit, but as it warmed, the sweetness came out more."
"Drinks easy for a 10% Quad. Don't see myself having more than a couple glasses in a sitting. Good to share with friends over desert."
"D- This one is definitely a sipper due to the high ABV and the high level of sweetness, but I'm loving the complexity of this beer. Overall, this is another outstanding beer from Allagash that is definitely recommended!"
"A very tasty Quad."
"Pours cloudy brown/orange color with thin off-white head. Smell - yeasty, fruity (plums, aples, some pears perhaps). Very nice aroma, alcohol is not noticeable. Taste - starts off yeasty and slightly boozy, then fruity - raisins mostly (weird, i couldn't really smell them, may be it's just me), aplles, finishes pretty sweet. Interesting beer - it is boozy, but it's still pretty good sipper. Carbonated, smooth, chewy. Moderate drinkability for ABV. It's good stuff, I do like it."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with lots of carbonation and a rocky, off-white head. Minimal lacing. Cherries, dried dark fruits, a boatload of brown sugar and yeast, and a clove/nutmeg/cookie dough mixture. Thicker, velvety mouthfeel. Somewhat sticky, which enhanced the sweeter side of the brew. The tangier, earrthy side of the beer dominated. Apples, grapes, and cherry for the most part. A fair amount of toffee and even some chocolate flavors popped up. Lots of sticky caramel and yeasty esters. The alcohol is not well masked, giving the a boozy finish. A very good beer that is easy to have you fill of."
"Had this on cask at Rustico's Glassware Giveaway (served after they ran out of Black). I've really been enjoying Belgians lately, and this was certainly no exception. It was a hazy dark amber with some light tan head. It smelled a bit faint, but like creamy Belgian yeast and mulling spices and toffee. Delicious. It tasted similar to the smell, but bolder and with a lot of nuances and complexities that I'm sure I missed (split this pint with a friend, and had already had a couple pints before). My main thought was how surprisingly similar this tasted to St. Bernardus, which is one of my all-time favorites. However, the key difference was the body and feel. Despite Four being on cask, St. Bernardus from a bottle somehow manages to be much smoother and silkier. Four was a little thin and flat. I'd probably normally give the mouthfeel a 4, but considering it was on cask, I had to dock it a half point for not living up to my hopes/expectations. Otherwise, this was a very enjoyable beer. Great to sip and contemplate, but all to easy to gulp."
"For this price level, I certainly I am not impressed. Allagash has many great brews and I would not consider this to be one of them."
"Drinkability is high. This is the second time I had this brew and I bought it this time just to review it because I knew I liked it. Kind of expensive though."
"D: A commendable quad. Definitely a sipper, nice but not awe-inspiring."
"Somewhat of a clean flavor for a Quad. I'm wondering if the fourth fermentation took out so much sugar that the beer is left a little thinner. Still, it's very enjoyable and smooth."
"This quadrupel should not be missed. Sampled on draft this past weekend at Milltown. Pours amber-honey with about 1"" of head. Initial aromas give off clove, grapes, and nutmeg. Upon sampling this tasty beer, the aromas give way to a light sweetness, and you can't taste the alcohol. It's got a medium mouthfeel, not very heavy, but sweet so it stays with you. Flavor profile expands with each taste and as the beer warms, grapes give way to tart apple. At 10% for my 12 fl oz pour, I was tempted to order another one, as I got through one rather quickly. Yummy."
"It would have been nice to get a little information blurb on the bottle about the quadruple fermentation but it's a nice bottle regardless."
"Toasted malts lead off with tangy and sweet tropical fruits following. Sugary grapes and candy malt mid-palate. Caramel cookie dough and woody tannins into the finish. Slightly warming, with lingering fruits and yeastiness. Full-bodied with lively carbonation. One of the lighter-hued Quads I have tried, and a good one at that."
"D: This is a very nice big beer. It has a wide range of complex flavors."
"This could almost be considered a dubbel; it's easier to handle and relatively drier than most quads I've had, certainly too dark for a tripel, but lacks the raisin and sourness most dubbels tend to have. Well-crafted, warming, gets you drunk. A joy!"
"Pours a murky reddish/mahogany color, smallish tan head fades into a fine film atop the beer, no lacing to speak of. Lots of raisin, sugary sweetness, and dark fruit on the nose. Taste follows the nose, loads of sugary malty flavors, a bit of alcohol heat. Full-bodied, lots of lingering spice and some nice belly-warming alcohol. This is good stuff."
"D: This is a good American version of a quadrupel. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"D - Pretty solid and enjoyable"
"750ml bottle, 2008, batch 15. Poured this into a Chimay goblet. Dark brown color. Minimal head that settles quickly into a thin ring. Smells sweet and malty, almost chocolately. Mild hoppiness to the aroma too. No alcohol aroma to speak of. The taste is sweet. Noticable sugary taste, kind of tastes like caramel. The malt in this overpowers the hops, though the hops are still there. You'd expect more of a malt taste with a quad, so this delivers. The alcohol comes through after swallowing. Not a whole lot of bitterness to this. It's got a heavy mouthfeel to it. Definitely a sipping beer. Quite an enjoyable drinking experience."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and heavy."
"drinkability is great. well balanced, hiding its alcohol pretty well. a nice example of the style."
"D: This beer's excellent characteristics justify it's steep price. I'll definitely be celibrating special events with this in the future."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Four is a crowd pleaser, diverse flavor, great to sip on, and announces its presence by bottle's end."
"taste is creamy, caramel, dark fruits, some woodiness to it, malt, and roasted nuts, has a slightly bitter ending."
" I know this was brewed with a lot of ""fours"" -and this should result in a crisp and clean beer. This is certainly crisp but but everything doesn't quite work well together here. This will certainly warm you up, relax you, and leave a nice sweetness behind after each sip, but I'd prefer an abbey or a dubbel over this. Certainly one of the boldest Belgian-style beers I've had in quite some time..."
"D- very good, but the high abv would be tough to have several of these"
"M/D: Medium carbonation and texture. Alcohol is a bit too evident in the flavor for you to have a couple of these. All said and done though, the flavor and texture of this beer one that you could enjoy for one or two."
"Pours a dark brown with amber edges and beige head. Aroma of spice, roasted malt, hops, dark fruit and candi sugar. Flavor is similar to aroma with dark fruits, malts and sugar cane. High ABV is very well masked."
"Drinkability: A solid quadrupel, lighter and fruitier than most, but still distinctly quadrupel like in its profile. A very interesting and pleasant beer - attractive, aromatic, and tasty. Though the abv% is a little high and only marginally well-hidden, this one's definitely recommended - very easy-going."
"Very good brew."
"Notes from 9/22/08"
"Drinkability: Drinks very easily for a beer carrying 10%. Glad to have tasted, but by no means would I consider it my favorite Belgian."
"For something that's light-heavyweight such as this it drinks very easily. Alcohol is present but nicely hidden and keeps the weight off."
"No head on an aggressive pour. Awesome Belgian nose on this guy. Yeasty fruit aromas, excellent nose. Minimal lacing on the glass. Taste is mildly complex, lots going on. Mild carbonation, good balance. Very tasty beer. Pissed that I shared it with a friend. :) Picked it up in El Segundo California. Worth the enjoyment."
"The aroma benefits from all the malts and hops. It's complex and enhanced by strong yeasts. There is toffee, caramel, butter, toasted malt, wood, and herbal hops. The appearance is brown/amber with a smaller sized head. The flavor is just like the aroma with a bourbon element. The palate is nice and chewy. This is a good beer but the finish is just to acidic for me."
"Grab a bottle. If you can afford it, get a few and age them. This seems like a beer that would develop excellently when aged."
"Allagash Four, lets dive right in. Color sort of reminds me of raspberry in its pinkish dark complexion, minimal heading. Smell is fruity and syrupy, strawberries, cherries, dates and figs come to mind. Very vinous in the flavor, with definite stone fruit aspects, and bits of candied sugar. Feel is light for the style, probably medium in general. Carbonation is pleasant and not overwhelming. Good drinking here, I had no problem drinking two full glasses despite a mild boozyness. Pretty good beer from the brewers at Allagash. An approachable, yet still complex Quad. Cheers, and keep up the good work."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer is getting better each moment... I'll absolutely suggest letting it come to cellar temperature before pouring, as practically all previous numbers have risen at least a half-point in that time. The texture in the mouth is creamy yet subtle and effervescent... and each remaining sip comes with enjoyment and appreciation. A delicious, rewarding beer that was worth waiting for."
"Pours a ruddy dark brown color with a gorgeous head that goes nowhere. As soon as the cork was popped, the aroma was very evident. Especially as I poured the beer into my Duvel glass. Strong aromas of dark fruits, candied apples, pears, grapes, candy sugar, belgian yeast..quite complex and very luxurious bouquet. Taste is of more fruitiness, pears, green and red apples, figs, candied malts, hops, phenols, you name it, its here...good job masking the alcohol bite. Warming going down. Mouthfeel is heavy, carbonated, on the dry side. Tremendous beer and the 750ml didn't last very long at all. Although it is a sipper, you keep wanting to take sip after sip after sip because it is so great. I love this beer. It's just as good as I remember it to be."
"It is a good beer but I don't think I would purchase it again."
"Incredible."
"Overall: don't believe I'll have any trouble finishing the 750. Where's the 850?"
"Drinkability- At 10% and a bit high in cost prohibit drinkability."
"Four is excellent, another terrific offering from Allagash. This is a quad not to be missed. Very well done."
"Drinkability is here, but at 10% abv, it is most certainly a beer to savor and sip."
"Very good quad, that is easily accessible. Fresh has better aroma and slightly better taste, aged is more creamy and less noticeable alcohol."
"A: The color of a murky iced tea, lots of sediment, creamy head - 4.25, S: Yeasty aroma of the Belgian style (surprise - it's Allagash), some dry sour dough bread, tinge of citrus which I can only assume is the hops - 4.50, T: Almost puckering, lots of alcohol, a little on the side of sour cherry, heavy on the malt, dry - 4.00, M: 4.00, D: A solid beer, quadrupels are often not up my alley but this one is an example of the style that I can appreciate - 4.00"
"D: This is one that'll leave a massive hangover given the sugar and abv. So, I guess that's a compliment because I'd probably drink way too much of this if given the chance."
"I'm a fan of the style & this one left me heartily underwhelmed. Disappointing."
"Drinkability: At 10% abv, probably not that drinkable in large quantities, but I don't care. This is a delicious brew."
"An excellent quadrupel in the same mold as the great Westvleteren. Appears reddish-brown with a thin cream-colored head. Strong candi sugar which lends a strong sweetness to both the aroma and the taste. Strong dark fruits on the taste and the typical Belgian yeast. Slightly metallic on the finish, but also very warming and smooth."
"Drinkability - Haven't been to impressed with many of Allagash's offerings but this one does have some charm. Not a quad i'd grab again, though it was a pleasant experience. Let it warm a bit so it will blossom."
"D: For a 10% ABV this one is amazingly drinkable. I could see myself drinking this way too fast if I didn't know it was so powerful."
"Besides just the aforementioned bottling/corking issues, this one seems to be a bit rough around the edges. It's good, and pretty tasty, but not a great beer."
"D: One of the best beers I've had in a while, just explodes with great flavours when it enters your mouth, really good stuff, one of the most drinkable 10+% beers out there."
"D- This is a very nice Quad. Very complex and somewhat mild...there are flavors here that are much more complex than my palate. This is what I imagine a great Quad to be. The alcohol is there...but it is much milder than in other examples of this style I have tried. Probably my favorite from Allagash so far...I will pick this up again."
"This beer reminds me of St. Bernardus 12, but not Westvleteren. The carbonation, like many quads, is quite high and the beer needs some time to mellow out before you can actually taste it. Once settled, there's a relatively good (but not great) mixture of caramel malts with dark fruits. This one drinks oh-so smoothly, and against stiff competition in the style holds it's own but doesn't stand out. Overall: well-made and an excellent example of the style."
"D - I'm struggling to get by the 10% ABV, but confess this is one of the best ales I've had to date. World class drinkable stuff that I suppose could age beautifully, but I haven't the patience. Enjoy this one on its own in the best glass you own. Wow."
"Overall, not the typical quad, but I think a little age would do wonders."
"D: Really nice. Had this after a Dogfish 120 so anything is easy drinking after that. One of the better Quads I have had not made in Belgium. Glad I got to try this but I can never bring myself to plop down the 18 bucks to buy a bottle as there is too much good stuff out there for less."
"D: Drinkability was ok, with the hot and spicy alcohol fusels on the finish this is best reserved as a slow sipper where one bottle (1 pt. 9 oz) should be more then plenty for one person and probably best suited shared with a friend."
"Drinkability: I should probably buy another bottle for aging. I think this ale needs to be properly aged before it becomes more drinkable. The alcohol warmth is almost too much for me, requiring it to be enjoyed in sips."
"750ml corked & caged brown bottle with no freshness date, although I think I bought it about a year ago. pours a cloudy amber with a one finger head, great longevity and excellent lace. Initial malt aromas mixed with sour apple, followed by a faint bready yeasty smell. Flavor of fruity malts, sour apple, sherry. alcohol does not come through until well after it is swallowed. Great initial smoothmess that gets a bit harsh once the alcohol kicks in. Nice malty aftertase though. This one could have used another year or two of aging, but it is still very nice."
" ** Cellaring note - (12 month temp range : 57 - 66 deg F) : If you have an Allagash 4 from 2004 - 2005 - try it NOW is my advice - especiallay if you have more than one. Some sour notes were noted on the fringes so 3-5 years may be peak or close to it. I remember 1 year didnt change it much."
"This is a fine example of an American quadrupel. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a representative example of the style."
"I wasn't overly impressed with this beer but it was still worth getting again. Good flavors and fairly easy to drink for the alcohol content."
"A very nice beer! Unfortunately I opened up a Rochefort 8 right after I tasted this one and it kind of left the it in the dust. None the less.... some good stuff!"
"d: This is a great example of an American quad, well worth seeking out."
"Cheers Beer Enthusiasts!"
"Rasins and dark dried fruits are mingled with a mega dose of earthy malt, spicy yeast, and rich warm alcohol. This one intensifies as it warms up. Lingering aftertaste is a bit odd however, can't put my finger on it. After my relatively small glass of it, i already was feeling the 10%. It's hidden fairly well. If I guessed the abv, i'd have put it around 8%."
"D- It's good."
"D - Somebody get me a light cigar. Excellent, yet different from many of the quads I've had, which tend to have a much richer character, yet this one was more enjoyable."
"D - High carbonation on a beer that isn't really refreshing is just a strange combination that doesn't entice me to drink more. The noticable alcohol makes for a slightly rough finish as well."
"D: A good, but not great quadrupel. However, I feel this may have over-aged, so I will have to come back to this one again. Hints of complexity, but falls a little flat and short of expectations. A very interesting brew and one I would recommend at least trying."
"Drinks well enough, but it is a bit sweet and high in alcohol to drink too much of this on its own. Paired pretty well with a grilled steak and some sauteed veggies."
"Thick, creamy mouthfeel, low to medium carbonation. Coats my entire mouth with fruit sweetness, but not cloying. Very drinkable brew for the abv."
"FOUR is interesting, and even considering the exceptional/excessive sweetness and 10% ABV, drinking this one bomber's no struggle, but I wouldn't really want a second."
"I appreciate the complexity of flavors and the smoothness of the Four, in the same realm as a good strong dark Belgian ale like the Chimay, but I wouldn't choose this to have everyday. Too sweet, mainly."
"Notes: Decent stuff, but clearly not the best quad around."
"this is a fantastic beer regardless of the final rating."
"Overall very drinkable, but beware the high ABV."
"Pours deep amber red with a frothy head that disappears quickly. Aroma of candies sugar, yeast, and raisins. Sweet malts present right up front (fairly complex with notes of candied sugar, dark fruits, and citrus), followed by alcohol finishing slightly bitter. I like to see my quadrupels hide their alcohol a little more effectively, but an interesting concept, and a quite enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, yeasty, semi-sweet, and finishing with doughy raisins, along with black plums lingering."
"Body could be a little richer, carbonation is high. Does not compare favorably to authentic examples of the style. Still, this beer is pretty easy to drink despite the high abv."
"Overall, not a bad stab at the style, especially coming from an American brewery, although Allagash has certainly produced better beers..."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with white head after vigorous pour. nose is very appley and smells of good dark fruits. Taste follows the nose. Lots of dark fruit flavors very belgian in quality. Good creamy spices and awesome dark fruits! Caramel applishness (sort of). Sugar remains on lips. Mouthfeel is a wee bit thin, but drinkability is fantastic. ABV is MIA. Certainly my favorite american made Quad so far. Props to allagash, and thanks to LittleBreeze."
"Pours cloudy brown with a large cream head that settles quickly. Smells of caramel, tart cherries, candy sugar, peppery yeast, and alcohol. Aroma is a little thin until the beer has had a chance to breathe and warm a bit. The flavor is a little cloying initially. Sweet caramel and sugar with alcohol and cherry overtones. A peppery center leads to a surprisingly dry and hop-filled finish. In the mouth, the beer is relatively light with moderately strong carbonation. Ends up feeling a bit astringent. An interesting American interpretation of the quad style, though not the strongest in beer in the Allagash line-up."
"Poured into a snifter. Four pours a rich amber/mahogany, with a solid white head with good retention. Very nice lacing as well. Aromas are of fall fruits, apples, pears, figs, and some golden raisins, as well as winter spices. Tastes match these aromas perfectly, very fruity mixed with clove and nutmeg, sweet and wonderful. Mouthfeel is smooth, not too heavy for a quad, and just outstanding. I could drink this forever, almost like I did when I toured the brewery and they had the FOUR w/ strawberries...try drinking that at 9:30 am..it was great."
"A pretty decent quad, which, ironically earns all 4's for this Four."
"Had on-tap at Brickstore Pub in Decatur, GA. Pours a dark brown with a slight amber tint. Quite a head on this beer. Aroma is VERY sweet. I got alot of candy and sugar in the taste. I'm sure part of it was the alcohol. Beer was very effervescent but not to a point that would make it unenjoyable. Overall, a great beer."
"Overall, very nice for the style. At first, I thought the taste was too one-dimensional, but as it warmed, I warmed up to it. Good job."
"Pours dark copper to amber, quite hazy, almost no head, just a faint covering of cream bubbles. Aroma is a nice sweet appleyness, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Dehydrated sweet apples and a hint of pruniness as well. Taste is a nice apple flavor, mixing with some dry oakiness, not quite tart but not sweet. There are hints of raisiny sweetness up front and in the finish. Mouthfeel is on light to medium, very low carbonation keeps it thinner which is quite nice. Drying in the finish with a little spicy dance of hops and alcohol. Overall, a great beer for me, the alcohol was very well masked and shoed itself in the right amounts. Mouthfeel was dead on and I loved the hints of pruney, raisiny maltiness that would pop up every now and again."
"Poured a light crimson red that was blended in with some orange coloring. It had a tall head of white foam that had really good retention that left behind a small white film and few spots of white lace. It had a great lightly sour aroma of ripe juicy fruits (way too many to list), yeast, and a small spatter of bitter hops in the background. Toward the bottom of the glass, the aroma will get very oaky and sour. These fruits in the aroma were so good, I couldn't stop smelling this beer! The taste was very fruity with toasted malts, a pinch of yeast, and a slight touch of oak and citrus hops at the end. The oak was a nice touch. The mouthfeel was slick as hell! I had no idea from the mouthfeel that this beer had a high ABV%. I had to find out from the bartender that this beer had a high ABV%. Besides that, this beer had an aftertaste of juicy fruits, yeast, and a pinch of citrus hops. This was one to nice beer to try on-tap! It is expensive to try on-tap, but it's worth it. Just a reminder, this beer will sneak up on you like it did me."
"Good beer,complex and hard to read."
"Very sweet sugar cane and molasses in the aroma. Tons o' dark fruit mix in with the quaff, along with a pop of medicinal cherry. Belgium yeast supplement the taste, and this one finishes with a hoppy kick, almost raspy. The alcohol is there, but remains in the background and does not distract from an overall tasty brew."
"750ML corked and caged. Pours a mud puddle brown color with a disappointing light tan head that quickly faded into a light ring around the glass. The smell is of raisin, some red wine, and brown sugar/molasses. Starts off very sweet. A big dark fruit blast centering around the flavors of raisin and red wine grapes. There are hints of carob and perhaps fig. The feel is light but not watery with fizzy carbonation; finishes sweet. Definitely a brew with some big bold aromas and flavors. There seems to be something missing from this quad. Perhaps more of a malt presence. The beer looks and feels thin. A good quad but nothing too distinguishing."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with ruby brown highlights. Decent initial head that fades quickly to a very thin ring that leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of macerated fruit, bubblegum, lightly of bananas, and there is a whiff of oak at the end. Tastes even better with the same fruity start of bright fruity esters, banana, a slight touch of clove, some oak, and a tannice bitterness at the finish and more clove as well. Mouthfeel is substantial, creamy and a bit tannic at the end. The alcohol is hidden very well and it is delicious. I've had the barrel aged version of this and that was sublime. This is merely very good."
"I've been sitting on this one for a year. Poured into a tulip a cloudy dark amber/mahongy color, some carbonation, little fizzy tannish head, which leaves some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slight yeast, dark fruits galore, slight oakyness, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty/yeasty, figs, plums, raisins, slight licorice, and caramel. A true delight to drink. The alcohol is hidden very well. Full body, a complex brew. Very drinkable, this is another gem from Allagash, highly recommended."
"Pours a beautiful ruby red color wit hardly any head whatsoever, the smell is very fruity and yeasty, i can smell the alcohol aswell. taste is full of flavor, lots of fruity flavors, from apples to citrus to yeast. the alcohol is present but not overpowering. it has hardly any carbonation. another good quad."
"Overall, quite a tasty beer, but definitely not what I think of when I think of a Belgian quad. I'd definitely buy it, and it is well worth trying, but don't expect the deep dark fruits and layers of caramelization found in other quads. If the alcohol was a bit more hidden, and the darker side of the beer was bumped up, I probably would have rated it higher. Either way, give it a shot, it's a solid beer from a great brewery. Thanks again Ken."
"Warmed to proper temperature, a 2006 poured into a Duvel glass, pours a dark crimson, beautiful color through a light, a slightly fizzy inch thick off-white head settles to a thin film after a few minutes, nice beading lacing, some sticking, a swirl brings back the head. Very nice. The aroma has a very complex yeasty quality, but actually a bit timid, no... refined, we'll call it, with faint spices, a dry, sweet malty and fruity nose. The taste full of fruits, complex sugars and spicy yeasts. Much similar to the nose, but also some darker stuff, brown sugar is present here, some rich caramels, plums and figs and raisins figure in, the alcohol becoming more and more apparent as it warms. The body is above medium, but should be a bit bigger, is fairly smooth and warm, not the best part but not subtracting from it. Overall, the idea (four malts, sugars, yeasts, and hops, fermented four times) is very cool, and works well here. As with any good beer, it got better as it warmed. In all, I""m happy with it."
"Ohmygodd...despite a 10% ABV, this is an extremely drinkable beer, enjoyable to the last drop, not too light or heavy, ridiculously flavorful, looks and feels amazing. Would be great at a beer bar with friends, as accompaniment to a cookout, or just by yourself in a contemplative, restful mood. Can't remember what I paid for it, and I don't care...I'll pay whatever they're asking to get more. Fantastic."
"D: At 10%, this is not a quaffing beer. I had one glass and savored every sip, but doubt that I could handle a second."
"The taste was a bit acrid for a quad...almost as if it had been oaked in one of its four fermentations. Cherry, apple, toffee, and vanilla abounded, as well as a domineering alcohol note. Mouthfeel was thick bodied and overly carbonated. The aftertaste brought little to the table: it was bitter, but not overly so. Drinkability was limited, despite the complexity, as this beer packed a whopping price tag to match its enormous ABV."
"It reminded me of a standard quad...a good one at first...then as it warmed up a bit more in the glass...it got even better...I don't know why it was fermented so many times...I though it was good....but not great compared to other quads that I have tried...I would drink this beer again anyday...but...it was not worth the 13 dollars I spent on it..."
"D- This beer is sweet with a fruity quality to the malt which is nice and the alcohol helps to support the malt nicely. This makes a nice desert beer, but I can’t say I could pick out the 4 malts, and 4 yeast qualities. It didn’t have that much depth for all the 4s."
"D - Extremely good. A pleasant beer from first drop to last."
"Comments  I am a fan of the excellent brewery that spawned this fine beer. I gladly pay a premium so I can enjoy the consistent quality that each beer from Maine exhibits. The Four was no exception. Ill continue to reach for it whenever it presents itself this far way from home."
"Recommended."
"D: Rather relaxed flavors, but all showing through, making for an easy drinkability and fairly unique composition."
"Pours a clear dark orange amber with a smallish tan foamy head. The smell is strong with alcohol,sweet malt,oak wood,dark fruit,and vanila. A very good and complex aroma. The taste is like the smell, full of dark fruit,oak wood,bourban,honey,and citrus hops. An exceptionally tasting beer that should not be missed. The m/f is heavy with all the complex flavors mixing very well. An outstanding beer from one of the great brewerys in America."
"Four may not be the stunningly beautiful beer that most of Allagash's lineup is, but it's damn close. It's also a wonderful version of a style that I love more each time I drink it. Even though these Allagash 750s can be expensive, I won't hesitate to grab another bottle the next time I see it. Highly recommended."
"Well I have had better and I seriously doubt that I will bother trying to sample this again."
"Well, of course as a quad, no matter how good it is, you've got to sip it slow or your on the floor. The fact is this is a fantastic quad, exceptionally smooth and very drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber color, not unlike a good cider. No head or lacing. The smell is all about the alcohol. Past that primarily a yeasty dark fruity aroma. Full bodied, the mouth feel is immediately conditioned by the alcohol. Slightly under-carbonated, flavor is sweet with brown sugar apples and pears. The 10% ABV is fully showcased in the smell, mouth feel and can be felt every inch of the way down."
"Beautiful looking brew. Deep amber with a few inches of off-white head that subsides quickly. The aroma is of belgian yeast, fruits and malts. You really gotta put your nose in the glass to pick up much though. I'm more impressed with the taste. Many times I've been disappointed by highly regarded brews of this style. I really like this one though. The flavors are bright and alive. Very active carbonation on the tongue. It's got a satisfying bite as you swallow. The alcohol melds well with its surrounding influences. While malt driven, you can still pick out some of the hop characteristics such as citrus fruit and a touch of bitterness. I'm not yet proficient at picking out individual flavors in belgian style beers in particular, but I do know what I like. This is very good, and I will be picking up a few more bottles so I can see what happens over the course of a few years."
"Wow it's a pricey treat, I wasn't disappointed. Fantastic complexity, the sweetness wasn't overpowering, and the high alcohol content was well hidden. An incredibly drinkable beer for its potency. Every sip and sniff had a different flavor or nuance to follow."
"Overall a great bear from a brewery that never ceases to surprise."
"From a 750mL bottle, beer poured a clear brownish red, with little head. Aroma was a light grape, fruity smell. Taste was a grapes over a malt background with some spice. Not too heavy for a beer like this. Somewhat slick but light for the style overall. I didn't enjoy this that much. It was a lighter bodied malty/alcoholy brew, but not that interesting. Wasn't as deep and rich as other Quadrupels I've tried."
"Definetely a smooth and full mouthfeel, with a boatload of pleasant, warming alcohol...there is nothing bad about this beer, it's all good...good indeed!"
"Pleasantly thick mouthfeel as it first touches the palate. Not thick as in heavy, but thick as coating. Sugary sweetness is almost too annoying at first. Maltyness is bigger then I would have expected and lingers well into the aftertaste. Belgian yeast flavors are coupled with the malt notes adding to the overall body of the beer. Dark fruit notes are present, but play a supporting role to the caramel malt and slight belgian notes. Smooth and quite drinkable. A nice one to get a hold of if you can."
"Drinkability: At any rate, it's another pleasant, likeable release from Allagash that should be drank accordingly."
"M&D - light bodied and dry feeling, bubbly as a wine on the tongue, but easily drinkable, to high of an ABV to do more than a glass at a time, definitely a sharing bottle. but worth it, a decent brew"
"D- I think it is a great Quad. I think St. Bernys 12 is better though and especially for the price difference. Good beer but you can get better for a lot cheaper."
"It's a nice deep brown copper color, with a super dense head that casually fades, leaving exceptional lacing. The nose is sugary sweet malts with some yeast and roasty goodness. Taste is nice deep sweetness with hints of dark fruit, raisins, yeast, touches of honey, and the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel is dense, smooth, and creamy, much better than some other quads. Drinkability is dangerous for a 10%. Great overall."
"Had a bottle at Naja's in Redondo Beach. I'm not sure how old the beer was, probably >2 yrs old... There was hardly any head at all no matter how hard I poured. Seems like it lost some of it's carbonation along the way. The color was murky and hazy orange, with floating yeastie particles. The aroma and taste were mostly fruity esters and alcohol. probably more alcohol in the flavor than I expected. Overall it was an OK quad, not my favorite but possibly not aged very well."
"D: This might be a good go-to beer during the summer for me. This beer is actually quite refreshing and would work nicely on a summer afternoon if you prefer darker beers (as I do)."
"750 ml. bottle- color of mahogany , with a healthy tan head - nose of dark red fruit , molasses , ginger snaps the cookie , slight coffee grindings , and alcohol  taste of dark red fruit , candied quality , chocolate , sharp , and something else - body is sharp at first then creamy the sharp again , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of brown sugar , pumpkin? , and sharp  good but I am not sure if it is worth the price"
"Overall: I enjoyed this American interpretation of a quad and will not hesitate to buy it again. It is a bit coarse and unrefined when compared to some of its Belgian counterparts, but it is a very nice beer that I look forward to enjoying whenever I can. It is hard to find in Ohio; I got mine during a visit to Chicago. A better head and a little more complexity in the flavor profile would make this a world class beer."
"Cheers!"
"This one was a disappointment for me. Maybe this one was infected or something, as the green apple character just didn't sit well. Too caramelish for style, esp. as there are three other malts in the mix...It might need to age more, also, as the alcohol was just a bit too masking."
"22 oz bottle poured in my pint glass with "" Heroes "" - David Bowie on the Hi-Fi . The guitar of Robert Fripp on this track is magnificent . Hopefully this brew from Allagash with be the same . Bottle is capped caged and corked with luminous lettering on the bottle . When poured it has a beautiful frothy cream colored head . Burnt amber color and beaming aroma abound . First taste is scrumptious and flavorful . The aroma of honey & fig . Honey is also what I taste with a tad bit of booze burn which is wonderful . half-way through my pint there is plenty of lacing and a thin head . This is another great brew by Allagash in my book . Splendid ."
"A little thin on the mouth, but still overall a very nice brew."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a hazy, coppery co;or. There was a small off-white head that doesnt last too long. The aroma is quite nice: a myriad of different scents. Bready, caramel, coriander, pears, apples, and possibly a few others. The taste is quite good, although it a tad lighter in body than I would have expected. Light carbonation on the tongue. Tastes of caramel (but not very sweet at all), spices, fruits. It is complex to say the least. Very nicely done."
"d: excellent - one of the best quadrupels interpretations, particularly made in us, i've had. would be very happy to pick up a few of these despite the high price i paid out on the west coast for a bomber."
"Caramel and malt with essence of honey and fruit pits are apparent on the nose and the palate. There is a resinous quality to the mouthfeel but it is quite pleasant. Very warming feel from the high abv but also to be expected. I'm glad I tried this. It is one of my preferred Allagash offerings."
"D: Quite good."
"The cork popped off the 750 ml bottle with a rather unsatisfying thump. I was expecting the loud pop that usually accompanies corked Belgian style ales. The beer had a murky brown appearance with almost no head and very little carbonation. Aroma was good. Candyish malts, spices( clove and pepper) and yeasty bread aromas in the nose. Taste was equally good. Ripe fruit, spices and a hint of hops along with warming alcohol. Mouhfeel was a little thin however due to the beer being almost flat. Not sure what happened here, but I'm disappointed that I spent 11 bucks on this beer. I probably got a bad bottle, so maybe I need to purchase one at another store in order to give this brew a fair shake."
"A fairly spicy and bitter quad that is definitely an outlier from its quad brethren and, I might add, in keeping with Belgian nose-thumbing at conformity to rigid style categories. There is great complexity here, and an almost Pale ale feelalthough the high ABV and substantial bitterness quickly shatter that illusion and bring you back home to quadville."
"There's no hiding that this is a quad, nor that it's a domestic. However, as a simple expression of strong, dark ales, this brew suceeds admirably. A little meatier than it's Belgian cousins, this malt-bomb is pleasing for the soul, if nothing else."
" The body is substantial and a bit creamy, but lacks the carbonation that truly wonderful Belgian quads possess. On the whole, though, an excellent offering from Allagash, one that I could see myself drinking a lot of."
"This one has been sittin' in my beer fridge for way too long. But, what a beer to wait for. This brew is much better than many other Quads I have tried. Heavy sweet malts, blended well and matured into a fruitcake-sweet brew with hints of nuts and rum. A mild plastic aroma that shows early disipated quickly into a unique Belgian fermented note. Tastes confirm all the fruits and yeast, while adding a confectionate sugar sweetness along with Belgian spiciness. The beer continues with a warming and numbing effect, but never getting fusal or harsh. Lots of sweet alcohols nearly hurt the teeth (kinda Samichlaus-like). Finishes with a continuing warmth, mild grain / sugar bite, and lingering sweetness. A sip here will go a long way. Nice brew."
"D: Chewy & creamy body. Alcohol is not too big and it doesn't dry up too much. Carbonation is balanced very nicely as well. Taste is raisiny and slightly bitter on the finish"
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a wonderful body and plenty of carbonation. This beer is quite a treat and works well on Thanksgiving. Even at 10% I could see myself working down a bottle of this to myself no problem, however in the spirit of good brew I'm sharing this one with family today. Overall, another fine brew from Allagash that has aged quite nicely!"
"A good late-night beer, just before bed (as I'm having right now)."
"Drinkability/Overall: Liquid, boozy caramel apple. Tons of apple skin tannins. Not awful, but could use some malty balance as this comes of quite dry and alcoholic."
"Poured into Chimay chalice, a nice musty reddish amber. The head dissipates at medium speed and lingers on surface, its sustained by tiny bubbles and leaves little lacing, At first sniff smells almost like that strawberry Nesquick, predominately sweet malts, with minimal, yet supportive hop character. There are hints of strawberry, vanilla, light fruity esters and maybe even minor touches of berry and apple. If the smell doesnt get you the flavor will. The flavor is excellent, enticing and welcoming, the sweet malts are balanced masterfully, with just the right amount of hoppy bitterness. The spectacular malts are definitely the showcase of this beer, along with their excellent fruity esters. I could drink this stuff like crazy, if it wasnt 10 ABV, which is hidden ridiculously well. How ever to most this beer does not have the marks of what you'd look for in a killer quad, lacking body, head and what have you, but I still find it to be a fun version of a one. Some of the sents and flavors might at moments seem synthetic, which I acknowledge, but for me they turn out in a tasty way that works well. I mean this beer even has great quenching capability, but to quench your thirst with this is to feel its strength. Every thing about this beer screams drink me and then buy another bottle so you can show your friends, but drink me. This is a fabulous beer, and a great concept, there is no question I will buy this again."
"750ml bottle obtained at Whole Foods in Portland, Maine. Pours a translucent dark copper body with a half inch of light tan head. Smells like raisin, date, brown sugar, pith, and peppery phenols. Tastes fruity, with plum, grape, date, citrus, pith, with peppery notes. Chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar also play prominent roles. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV and complexity. A solid quad, unique, interesting, drinkable for the style, and overall a very well-crafted beer. Awesome."
"Drinkability: A little too thin of a body, but the flavor is definitely interesting. Not the ebst from the style, but above average."
"Cheers2Beers"
"the mouth feel is perfect for style as it is a sweet beer"
"The presentation of this beer, as well as the lead-up on the bottle really put the stakes high, and unfortunately they prove to be too high. Pours with a dark red-golden color with no head. Smell is tremendous, with lots of sugars and dense malts. With the taste I was expecting the kind of beer thats almost hard to drink because of the complexity, but the amount of flavor doesnt seem to be as big as the sum of its parts. The most discernable taste that really sums up the beer is of candied fruits, most likely coming from the grains. A great beer, but I dont think it lives up to the high reputation of what you'd expect from such a special beer from Allagash."
"Very complex and flavorful, the higher ABV limits the drinkability for me. Still a well done quad."
"Poured a semi-translucent, bubble-laiden medium brown color with burgundy highlights. A frothy white head develops and quickly dissipates leaving behind plenty of lacing. Aromas of plums, figs, earth, grains, and dried fruits seemed to come out. The taste was filled with earthy flavors like ripe dark fruits and grains. The dominating sweetness was offset by a subtle and yet sufficient bitterness. Layers of flavors seemed to jump out of this beer. Somewhat creamy and slick in my mouth. Very easy to sip and enjoy. I could hardly taste the high ABV in this beer. Very complex and an excellent beer I hope to have again soon."
"Nice dark red color with a white head leaving some lacing. I've seen plenty of others out perform this one, but it still looks nice. Yeast, candi sugar, and dark fruits, with a bit of an alcohol sting in the nose. Yeast is the first thing you taste, but followed quickly by the fruits and then an alcohol warmth. Alcohol is not hidden, but not overpowering. Taste seems to become a bit cloyingly sweet after a while. Lower carbonation, medium bodied. Pretty good, on occasion."
"It's great, if I have extra money next time I will pick this up, but it's notihng more special than that."
"Drinkablity - this is a decent, but not great beer. Also high abv of 10 % limits this to one 750 in any given session."
"A brownish copper colored beer with a slight haze. Has a nice small bubbled foamy head and a little bit of lace.At first the aroma has an appley tartness.Followed by a hint of dried fruit and a smooth caramel malt note. The flavor starts out with a sharp tart note which changes quickly to a light sweet dried fruit character. The middle is just a smooth luxurious maltiness. The finish has the hops adding as much to the overall flavor as to the nice little snap at the back of the throat."
"The body is a little less than I was anticipating, but it has a very nice and smooth carbonation. Drinkability is good, but could be better."
"Another great beer from Allagash."
"Jen: This is a very smooth beer. It has a nice dried fruit taste to it (typical of a Belgian Ale), but it isn't sicky sweet. I also get a nice mild maltness to it that is accompanied by a nice yeasty taste. Nothing too overwhelming and easy on your palette, with a very mild alcohol twinge at the end."
"Very bold with the fruit and spices. Maltiness is interesting. This is a complex and enjoyable brew."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty efervescant. Granted you can.t see a lot of carbonation, but you can feel a lot of it on the middle sides of the tongue."
"Overall: Alcohol has mellowed out. I can definitely feel it, but not really taste it. There is a lot going on in this beer. Its no Westvleteren or Rochefort, but its not bad. The thing that hurt this beer was the balance, and it definitely has this slight sour/tartness in the overall taste. I wonder if the cork went bad or something. Its also really spicy. It could be from the alcohol, but not sure. The aroma is outstanding though."
"D - I would have given this a 5 if it wasnt so spendy per bottle, but overall the best Quadruple I have tried to date. Amazingly complex. Well worth what I paid. Now to finish this bottle and tomorrow try and track down another!"
"Dark cloudy orange/brown with a medium head that falls to a continent and a high ring. No lace. Nose spicy, not a lot of depth, but nothing unpleasant. Some...what is it? melon notes? Smooth caramel, spice and alcohol flavors kick in. Creamy mouthfeel, but falls apart before the finish. There is nothing overpowering here. A fine beer and a great drinker."
"(25.4 oz / 750 ml tall straight brown lithographed wine-like bottle, corked and caged)"
"D - Well, the name says it all and coincides with my ratings across the board. This is without a doubt easy to drink, and although it is solid across the board, it falls just short of true greatness."
"After a long day of work I wanted to open up one of my big beers, so here wwe go. Pours a nice orange copper color. Smells a bit like figs and prunes. Taste is sweet, prunes, cherry, a bit winey, very sweet winey flavor. Nice mouthfeel for this beer. Overall it's pretty good. Maybe my palate is wanting real hoppy beers for the time being. But I can't say that this is bad, far from it. If you want a good belgian style folks, this is it. (Best of all, it's from Maine)"
"I've thoroughly enjoyed every beer I've had from Allagash, and this is no exception. It was a pretty red color with a medium white head. It had a nice roasted grain odor, with some sweetness. The taste was sweet, caramel, mildly hoppy. The sweetness/fruitiness lingered. Very smooth and drinkable, not heavy. The alcohol is well-disguised."
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a huge beige foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of sweet malt, cookie dough with some alcohol hint is pretty interesting but I could have done without the alcohol hint. Taste is a bit sweeter then expected with lots of cookie dough and some dry raisins. I would have loved for this beer to have more attenuated sugars and a fruitier aroma à la Rocherfort 10 (I cant really have an ABT without comparing it to the best). Body is above average but could have been more full and alcohol could be more hidden. Very interesting beer from Allagash but cannot honestly say that it compared to the world bests."
"Opinion: This is one rich muthuh! If the Belgians had a Barley Wine, this would be it. It reminds me of a slightly less hoppy version of Hair Of The Dog's - Fred. I didn't think that I would ever try anything like that beer until now. The alcohol is a bit distracting for me, and is not hidden at all...you know damn well that this is a strong beer from the first sniff. In fact, I would think that it was higher in the 12%ABV mark."
"Brown creamy color, nice medium head poured in a frosty mug. Great citrus flavor that tantalized our nariz like no other. Smooth citrus flavor, nice hop blend, and a little sweet finish. The finish might be the best part, as I cashed the brew and sat contemplating the sweet, citrus, hoppy aftertaste. Fantastic! Give it a try if you have the thumb strength to pop the top!"
"I'd definitely recommend it! I am a big beer guy, and this one will make my belly warm and enjoy the cold evening. However, it'd even make a nice sharing brew in the summer if chilled. Interesting brew."
"This is a nice medium bodied quadrupple. Wonderful flavor. Caramel, candi sugar, citrus, banana, oak, vanilla. The taste swirls around the mouth and makes you want to come back for more. This beer is lightly sweet, not cloying or syrupy in any way. My next trip up to Portland ME will conclude with a case or two of this coming home with me for the beer cellar to enjoy for quite some time! Highly recommended"
"Deep, rusty brown. TONS of fine yeast sediment..sits at the bottom like sand. Aroma is Belgian yeast and fruity overtones..with an alcoholic punch. The taste is quite fruity (citrusy orange peel & lemon), with the spices coming on more thick and the alcohol creating a strong warming effect..the Belgian malts and yeast really add to the flavor, but the hops are fairly subtle despite the supposed four varieties. The mouthfeel is somewhat grainy, but the rich flavors keep you yearning for more. Not a bad interpretation of the rare style, but it's hard to truly appreciate this when I'm lucky enough to have one of the best (St. Bernardus 12) on-tap a few blocks down the street. However, this one is worth a try for sure."
"Taste is raisiny and slightly bitter on the finish. Sweet scotch or rum up front."
"Thanks, BeerBeing"
"The verdict: Why not just buy a Korbinian? Cheaper, same basic flavour profile, but better. Not a bad beer by any means, but, it comes so close to true greatness that it invites comparison, but far enough away to lose that particular competition. I remain curious about Quads, but so far would rather grab a dopplebock."
"i dig this. even at 10% it's easy to drink. for some reason i was expecting mediocrity here, but that expectation proved unreliable 'cause that's a good beer"
"Another outstanding beer from Allagash. Rapidly becoming one of my fav brewers. I've been holding onto a bunch of these for months. I just couldn't bring my self to open open (if I drink one I'll only have 5 left). Finally broke down and drank one for Thanksgiving Eve; had to rationalize it). Anyway, aroma was great. Even though there are four malts in this, I really didn't notice it or the hops. What I really noticed was the cherry and ruby port. Head was creamy, light-brown, excellent lacing, that mostly diminished. Color was dark amber. Heavy sweet initial flavor that lessens. Definitely can taste the malt now. Finish was very long. The body was not as full as some quads. Texture was syrupy and flat with incredibly little if any alcohol finish. One of my favorite quads. It was very smooth without too much cherry, like Three Phils. Very interested to see how this matures. Now only if Allagash would distribute to Georgia."
"The body was a little delicate for the style, but the sticky mouthfeel was enough to allow the flavors to shine through. The maturity of the flavors concealed the sugar derived alcohols quite well. Made a perfect nightcap, especially when paired with a wedge of semi-soft Brie cheese. The only slight downside to the whole experience was the fact that the taste did not change very much during the consumption of the entire 750 ml. bomber. Despite that, a very pleasing beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: Yet another quality Allagash product. I feel like this brewery just doesn't miss. It's balance and complexity keep me sippin and enjoying. A very very nice American Quad."
"Allagash Four pours a thick, opaque caramel color--you could dip apples in this shit. Actually, it smells sort of like apples. Good autumn beer, then. You can smell the 10% alcohol a bit. Tastes very malty upfront, crisply of apples, with some spicy alcohol and hops in the finish. Has an unpleasant, rotten apple aftertaste. I'm a fan of Allagash's other beers, but Four--actually the Quadrupel style in general--is just too malty and sweet for me to really get into. What I especially missed in this beer was the trademark Allagash spices that made their Grand Cru such a treat for me."
"Overall this was a terrific beer and a real pleasent sipper and something to be shared or horded depending on company."
"D - An excellent beer to relax and sip, as I will tonight as I get ready for and watch the season finale of Rescue Me."
"I sure hope Allagash makes this again."
"Thanks for babysitting this for me, Huge."
"Pours a very hazy orange/amber, nice big creamy head, lots of lace. Smell is pear, grassy hops, citrus, hops at the end, apples. Taste is fruity apples, pear, sweet malt. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium carbonation, full mouth, nice and mellow. Tasty."
"mouthfeel is a bit spritzy for something 4 fermented...note that I only list the negatives because I rank this beer as outstanding just a few flaws in my opinion...."
"Props to mdavis31481 and Warrior soul, you both sent me bottles, I don't know who'se I'm reviewing!"
"*EDIT* i just realized my review equalled 4. that's some funny sh*t."
"Drinkability- Overall a very nice brew to be shared for an after dinner drink. Not meant to have the whole bomber in one sitting. If there was a bit more sweetness there, it would have tied the whole experience of the beer together. That bit of sweetness missing cost the beer at least a 1/2 a point overall in rating. Still a nice beer, but nothing absolutely incredible like I was hoping for."
" Mouthfeel: carbonation lively but not over the top - well balanced and soothing. medium body but still has soft quality of texture."
"Deep, burnt orange colour, hazy, with a generous off-white head that showed good retention and lacing. Aromas of malt and fruit dominated, mostly pear but with a bit of apple as well. There's also a light alcohol smell that increases as it warms, but the maltiness balances it out nicely. Spiciness melds well with the other aromas and carries into the flavour. The fruitiness is more subdued in the flavour with malt coming more to the forefront. The balance leans toward sweetness, but there is still noticeable bitterness. Alcohol contributes a warming sensation with little flavour. The finish is on the dry side, with some hop bitterness and peppery spice. Lowish carbonation and a moderately full body. Overall, nicely balanced and quite enjoyable. And a little surprising how easy it was to drink, even with the big flavours and high abv. Thanks Viggo."
"Drinkability: Wonderful and well balanced all around. This is a well made beer and a nice limited edition. This is yet another beer that the folks at Allagash can be very proud of."
"Mostly clear garnet in color, with a thin, wispy tan head. Rich, malty aroma with a character of nuts and dark fruit. Alcohol emerges as the beer warms. More nutty maltiness in the flavor, with a pleasantly alcoholic taste of cherry in the mid-palate. Finish is tingly and bitter, spicy and warming."
"Nice brew!"
"Nice, frothy initial head subsides to a nice lace and a fair amount of stick, though thin and bone white. Lots of carbonation present throughout the mahogany/red hue, with a slight haze. Initial rock candy sweetness on nose with a springy clover aspect as well. Warming malt on the tongue, along with some raisiny aspects, maybe golden, and a cooling alcohol aftertaste. Somewhat soapy mouthfeel, but a quality offering all the same."
"Pours a medium brown with some reddish tint with a nice two finger slightly off white head that leaves a generous amount of lace as it settles.Aromas of cherry and brown sugar are dominant and fresh with a light iron character to it as well.Taste is spicey and clovey with some cherry and more brown sugar and maybe a little allspice?Wow a nice rich ale spicey and complex a real joy to down a bomber after work."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Drinkability: Alcohol is nowhere to be seen. This is nicely put together and quite drinkable."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a murky brownish red color with four fingers of head (coincidence with this beer?). There is a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is very rich and sweet. Lots of brown sugar and dark fruit aromas present. Nice and complex. The taste is fairly sweet. Super malty with lots of plums and dates. It finishes slightly dry though, with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is decently thick and strong, and the drinkability is surprising for 10%. A decent take at a quad."
"Another killer from Allagash. Really high end stuff from the guys up in Maine. Nice light brown color with ruby highlights and a pretty decent foamy head that lasts. Smell and taste are very complex. I like complex. Really fruity, really sweet. This is one of those beers where if you try to smell it, you will smell it. And taste it too. Basically choose your own adventure. What I mean by that is that if you're thinking of cherries you'll taste it in the beer. If you're thinking about pears you'll taste it in the beer. Etc... The schnozzberries taste like schnozzberries for christ's sake!! Super smooth mouthfeel and despite the 10% this is a really drinkble quad. Bueno."
"A hazy, crimson-accented chestnut robe is capped by a creamy, dark ivory head that holds well (given its strength) before dropping to a wide collar, and leaves rings of craggy lace about the goblet. The nose is typically Belgian in nature with it's yeasty phenols, fruit and spice dominating over its lightly sugar-ish, delicately caramelish, and somewhat nutty maltiness. Alcohol can also be found, but it's not obtrusive. The body is medium-light; and it's zesty on the palate initially with a very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation. However, it becomes a bit more airy as it warms (as is common). In the flavor, the alcohol is a little bit more apparent; there's a touch of bubblegum to the phenols; and the maltiness has more of a brown sugar character to it - but it's basically what the nose suggests it should be. The yeastiness is very much like Chimay, and to be honest, this is very much like a more attenuated version of their Grande Reserve. It finishes dry with a slap of spicy alcohol and yeasty phenols, but not much more. A bit more residual malt might be nice; but I understand that's a hard beast to control when it comes to bottle-conditioned beers! Try it and see what you think!"
"This is a potent brew with tremendous amount of flavor and complexity. There are elements of dryness and sweetness, richness and carbonation--a very interesting beer."
"Worth a try, but dont kill yourself seeking it."
"Served room temp. Poured a pretty amber with a nice thick head. Held the still mostly full bottle up to a candle. Pretty shadows were cast against the wall. Stubborn lace clung to the glass. The aroma is of brown sugar and nutmegs. The flavor kind of wraps around the tongue. Malty and sweet, but with a nice alcohol kick. 4 hops were used? I can see that, but none particularly jump out. Also tones of citrus, nutmeg, vanilla and coriander come through. The mouthfeel was a little heavy, I wonder if it would change if it was cold. There is only a slight taste of alcohol, but nothing that takes away from the drinkability. I like this beer, I like this beer a lot."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The 10%abv is extremely well hidden in this ale so be careful. A good ale; nothing more, nothing less. A nice treat, but there are better versions of the style out there."
"Smell is fruit and nuts. Taste is sweet and spice. Mouthfeel is prickly and smooth. I will search out more tomorrow. I hope I find more."
"Large bottle, that I put away in my beer celler (a brown paper bag in the back of a closet) for about 6-8 months ago. Corked and caged. Opened with a burst of carbonation. pours a rich, murky, cloudy shade of dark amber. hoists a light tan head, which slowly recedes to a tiny bubble film. This fine elixir leaves stringy soft lacing behind. Nose is full of spice and alcohol notes. Tangy, spicy, fruity Belgian yeast notes. lots of fresh fruit, doughy malt offerings and some chaotic chemistry and wonder going on in this complex dandy. Finishes with notes of rum soaked apricots. Very drinkable and a hefty 10%! This one really benefitted with the extra time in the bottle. I imagine it would continue to improve for quite some time. Seek out, stow away, wait and enjoy!"
"My drinking buddy liked this a lot more than I did. Smooth but not very tasty nor complex. A good beer, but not the best quad I have had."
"Pours a bright hazy reddish-orange color with a nice off-white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Sweet fruity aromas, flavors of plums, cherries and spicy pepper. Full bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, alcohol well hidden, finishes a bit sweet."
"What can I say..I don't use the words ""perfect", ""expert", ""heavenly", or ""intoxicating"" too often in my reviews, but this one has it all. What a fucking awesome creation. Props to Rob Tod and the crew for such a divine creation. Give those boys a Gold Star. I will now have to reshuffle my Top-Ten list, damnit."
"Doesnt have the head normally associated with Belgian style beers...it forms a decent one with the pour, but it quickly fades. Once poured, its an opaque brownish-orange; can not see through it. Seems to me to be very reminiscent of a dubbel. Not as hearty as I would have expected from a quad. The alcohol is masked completely though, even as it warms. Even as its not as hardy as I would expect, I still think it tastes very good...I find it hard to distinguish the flavors as they blend very nicely. The mouthfeel is where this beers fails though. The carbonation is prickly (that term has never been more appropriate), and the beer is lighter then expected. The carbonation issue I find the most troubling. I had no trouble finishing this off in one sitting, but I dont think I'd revisit it. I have a Victory 12 yet to be drank, and I'd like to try some true belgian quads for comparison, but as it stands, I find this good, but underwhelming. Certainly better then their grand cru, which is the only other Allagash I've had at this point, however."
"Pours a deep translucent amber - almost brown - color, with a very small head, even with a very agressive pour into my tulip glass. Smell is complex, with both fruityness and yeast. Taste is wonderfully complex. Honey. Warm sourdough bread. Mango. Pear. A bit of hops to balance. No hint of the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is dry and sweet/spicy, with less carbonation than I'd like - (again, I think my bottle lost a bit of it's carbonation.) Pretty drinkable for a quad. A decent ale, but not worth the price IMHO."
"Cheers"
"The beer pours an amber/brown color with a thin offwhite lace head. The aroma is awesome. It has a warm, yet extremely fruity scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a Belgian yeast aroma. It smells like strawberries, but I think that is from the use of many malts and hops. It is very balanced. The taste is good. It has a wonderful warm malty flavor that goes down smooth and finishes a bit tart and citrousy. I love the complexity of this beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It has great aroma and flavor; by far the best beer Allagash has come out with."
"Pours with a dark amber body, and a thin, frothy white head with heavy lace. Very fruity smells, almost tropical. Taste is a bit milder than the smell, with light fruitiness, a bit of banana and lemon, and slight yeast and hops notes. Not much alchohol flavor for such a high ABV. Very soda-ish mouthfeel, with a lot of carbonation. A fairly pleasant beer."
"Full bodied, incredibly drinkable for the ABV."
"I'm in love."
"Cheers to bennybrew for providing!"
"I poured this into a small glass that I usually reserve for good Scotch. A dark amber beer that has a nice, off-white head. The beautiful hop aroma gives way to a magnificent taste that has hops and dark fruits dancing with a true Belgium character. The taste just lingers in your mouth and throat all night. This is a beer that truely needs to be experienced to understand. I think I could drink this and nothing else for the rest of my life. Thank you Allagash."
"Dark amber-brown body, small white head. The smell is fruit punch like. The flavor is of light fruit, a medium alcohol flavor in the middle and a very little hop finish. The mouth feel has a light carbonation bite. This is a good winter beer, the alcohol will creep up on you and make you forget about the temperature."
"This came in a 750ml bottle corked and caged. This poured out a mahogany color body with about a fourth inch off white head. No lacing was left as this was consumed. Aroma is full of a malty sweetness with a strong dark fruit presence. Taste is sweet and spicy with a strong fruitiness. There are traces of the alcohol present as well and a spicy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is almost full with a creamy texture. Drinkability is good as well, I would definitely have this again. Give this one try if you come across it."
"Nice 22oz bottle. Pours a hazy orange color with a nice head that leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity and spicy, very nice. The flavor is a little yeasty and sweet with a malty feel and the spices are also apparent. Very smooth. Very drinkable if you like the style - smooth and enjoyable. I'll have this again assuming I can find it."
"This beer pours a nice dark tea color with a finger of head that falls to cover the beer. The nose is not as malty as I would expect from a quad. The malts are dominant, but still not strong and fig-like. I would call this one a belgian strong dark. The flavor is also not as what I expect from the style. This is a good beer, but for a quad, not so much. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it fits the rest of the beer well. Drinkability is better than the parts would lead me to. This is very smooth for a high ABV beer. I like it, but its just not right for style."
"75 cl corked and caged bottle. Cork popped with some force behind it. Pours hazy copper with a big, fluffy tan head, lacing is minimal. Subtle caramel, candi sugar and malt, faint caramel apple and fusel alcohols, suggesting a complete fermentation, and lightly herbal hops all round out a pretty subdued nose. Some scorchy malt flavors show up in the taste, spiciness and warming alcohol heats the esophagus. Hops are indiscernable, other than a slight twang undercurrented in the whole flavor. Grape, fig and pear-like fruit esters blend together with a very smooth malt profile than has a touch of wheat and has a higher carbonation level. Overall, a strong quad that hides its alcohol well by utilizing the process of multiple fermentations. Not bad, but I'll betcha it'll be better in another year when I try it again."
"This beer poured a deep copper to brown color. It had a medium haze, a nice thick rich tan head and a gentle lace on the glass. I smell sweet candy, sugar from the malt. No hop presence on the nose. The malt is up front on the 1st taste too. Then I detect a bite from the alcohol, and finally a bit of a nip from the malt. Its not overly sweet which is pleasantly surprising. With the extra fermentation I was expecting it to be thicker. It has a fairly heavy mouth feel, and for me I could have 1 or 2, but this is definitely not a session beer. This should be taken seriously as a fine example for this Belgian style."
"Bottle at blind tiger. Deep brown, cloudy, no head at all. Nose is hit up by bready malt and yeast flavors. Rather sweet aroma: fruity (grapes, dates) with mild vanilla-like alcohol vapors. On the tongue, the big allagash malt hits you up. Caramelic, chocolatey, marzipan-like, very sweet. Easy to pick up alcohol, but its an ABT and you dont mind that. Decent flavor balance, but just not as appealing fruitiness or yeastiness than top examples who are probably just as sweet, but manage to stuck your mind out of this thought. Full body, high carbonation a la allagash, smooth anyway. I found their tripel vastly superior, but allagash knows their brewing, no doubts about it and this will be highly enjoyable in a few years."
"Drinkability: Special occasions only, but one of the most drinkable in it's class."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head above a copper brew. Dense head took its sweet time in disperseing (which is fine), and laced incredibly. Aroma is sweet fruits and yeastiness, with a tinge of alcohol peeking through. Taste is spicy malts with tinges of fruitiness and a more assertive alcohol component than the nose. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, especially for the style."
"A winner."
"This is an excellent stab at the Belgian quadruple style. This brew was a dark, hazy orange/red colour that was golden crimson when held up to the light. The aromas were very fruity and a bit alcoholic. I smelled dark/dried fruits, alcohol, various spices (with the coriander and orange peel in the forefront) and more! The taste had a rum-like quality to it, with the spices and sweet fruit flavors blending together perfectly. The only negative thing about this brew, is that it is SO spicy, and SO fruity, it is almost like a fruit and spice overload! Perhaps if this is aged for a year or two it will become more blended, and less intense! The mouthfeel was medium-thick and the drinkability was very good for a 10% abv beer! A good one from Allagash.."
"Sweet slightly cooked caramel nose. Burnt orange murky hazy look in the goblet. Fluffy thick darker beige lasting 1/2 inch head. Rich malty initially candi sugar sweetness. The brew then spices with warm hints of nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and pine. A very thick rich full mouth with lively bubbles on the tongue. Quite rich and smooth. Very drinkable for the ABV... Solid brew."
"Another great beer from a great brewery. The distinctive Allagash flavor remains, but this one is full and spicy, as you would expect for a quadruple. Sweet, but in a good way. My wife shared it with me and enjoyed it very much also. If you're into Belgians, definitely seek this one out."
"Thick, gooey looking pour reveals a tightly carbonated Sugar Daddy-colored caramel body and a frothy cream head. Surprisingly dry aroma -- some spices (tiny bits of cinnamon, nutmeg) but mostly just the impression of some sort of unsweetened candy. Lingering, calm, mellow combinations of caramel and cinnamon flavors lay on the tongue. Tiniest hints of oak. Simple, mellow finish with just the tiniest hint of alcohol-derived bitterness."
"Has a bit of a chewy quality to it as well, due to slight viscosity which is rather pleasing. I searched high and low for this beer, finally tracking it down at the Finger Lakes Beverage Center in Ithaca. Not sure if it's worth $9.49"
"As a liqueur this is very nice. As a beer, I think there is a deadened quality that keeps it from acheiving the heights I have come to expect from this brewery."
"Pored a nice chestnut brown color with loads of head.Had to let it settle to get more in the glass-huge carbonation level-head lingered the whole way down.Enormous aroma of malt-very bready and yeasty as well.Nicely spiced.Malt and spices dominate-theres a great sweetness going on.Spices-notes of orange,coriander and licorice.Huge full bodied mouthfeel-10% abv-WHERE?Very smooth with the same residual sweetness.A very,very drinkable beer.Improved greatly as it warmed.This really needs to lay a while to improve even more.A great Belgian style beer from the US."
"Curious: I rated it high numerically by mentally comparing it to the style, and yet I wouldn't return to it again and again. I would like to try a year old and two year old bottle down the line though..."
"I was able to pick up more hops this time around (maybe its fresher) but this is still a malt-oriented beer as the style requires. It is very spicy indeed and really demands your full attention. What a great effort from Allagash!"
"I have to raise my dark blue lion encrusted English Cricket Cloth Cap and doff it in the general direction of that finest of Boston BAs. A present for Taxi privileges to both Stone and Alesmith whilst she was in town, it was certainly my pleasure. A Huge Thanks to Carmen for this one!!"
"."
"The taste mirrors the nose. Rather 2 dimensional. Hopefully this will mature into something impressive, because right now its just average. Medium/full bodied with robust, but soft carbonation."
"The mouthfeel was thick, but a mild crispness was noticed at the start as the carbonation levels were higher. The finish was slightly dry with malt sweetness lingering on the tongue for a while. Nicely drinkable as the alcohol levels were not overt."
"Pours a lightly hazy red-orange color, and is topped by a tan head. There is a spicy, yeasty, and bready aroma that is complimented by notes of caramel and toasted biscuits. Upon first taste, I think that this is a nice full flavored beer. It is sweet up front with an off dry finish. It tastes of cinnamon and has a bit of astringency in the finish. Up front this tastes of caramel, fresh bread, a bit of orange, and honey. This is so smooth, and oh so drinkable (it is a dangerous combination). I definitely like this, though it could perhaps use a bit more of the bottle-advertised hops."
"Pours with a two-finger head that fades slowly leaving thick lace. Slightly cloudy amber color. Very good carbonation - pour slowly. Nose has a hint of musty flowers and some raisin. Sweet, heavy bodied and just hints of the high ABV, should be savored. $10.25 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Allagash has made a believer out of me. This Quadrupel matches most of the top Belgians I've had, and exceeds many others. I plan a pilgrimage to Maine, next month to tour this brewery, and attempt to learn how they can craft such a fine Belgian style Quad. Exceptional!"
"There is only one thing better than a quaddual quads! Enjoy!"
"The beer disembogues from the corked 750ml brown bottle a nebulous mahogany color, the head is spumescent and behemothic in size, the color a winsome tan, as it ever so slowly fades, the lace forms a glutinous sheet to obscure the glass. The nose has a nice aroma of yeast, backed by some fusel alcohol, hints of fruit, over ripe plums comes to mind, with the start sweet and nicely malted, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has is stern in its acidity, somewhat tart, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, and the aftertaste maintains the dry tartness to the very end, a nice bit of warming in the tummy also noticed from the 10 percent ABV."
"Glowing, ruby hued, mahogany colored beer. Small oatmeal colored head fades rather quickly to a film leaving a scattered coat of lace. Mellow fruit, alcohol, and doughy aroma. Mild fruit esters and a bit of malt end in a slightly bitter finish and a warm stomach. Light, almost fizzy feeling beer. The carbonatioon keeps the subdued flavors from saturating the tongue. IMHO it could use a little more aroma and flavor, served cool so that wasn't the problem, maybe it just needs time."
"But nine bucks could also buy you a St. Bernardus...."
"This is a nice looking beer. It's a very hazy brownisah orange with a stiff bubbly head that seems to sit still. This brew looks like a meal. Aroma is full of a bready maltiness, peppery spices and fruity esters. Not an overwhelming strong scent, but good. Rich, full taste here. Toffee, grapes, butterscotch and a hefty dose of malt make this one tasty brew, and chewy to boot. Fairly clean aftertaste, with just some caramel notes lingering. Mouthfeel is smooth & slick, even while having a good amount of peppery fiz common in belgian strong ales. Nice warm feeling in the gut from this one. Dangerously drinkable. I always thought Allagash brews were missing a fullness in the taste & mouthfeel - this beer has that fullness."
"Each part of this beer is damned good, but man oh man, that alcohol does its level best to blur that goodness. The dense malt sweetness and earthiness are well mitigated by the spicy hops and bitterness, and those are big positives, but at times the alcohol masks much of the subtlety that exists. And yes, that ABV works a bit against drinking more, because it hits real hard, not only warming, but clouding things up as well. But overall, in spite of that, it's a tasty blended balance that delivers a saucy flavor, and that's a pretty fair bottom line."
"Note: the reason that drinkability is not a 5 is the abv. I have a hard time downing a lot of a 10% abv brew. One bottle is fine, more than that would be pushing it. Although, if it weren't for the alcohol content, I could easily drink this one all night."
"Sedimented dark ginger brown appearance with dull orange highlights. Fast rising ochre head and very attractive thick ropey laces. Flesh fruit aromas, pear, raisin, and cinnamon. Thick texture, catches in the throat. An alcohol build-up helps counter the viscosity and the heavy fruit flavors and there's an interesting hot mace and cinnamon complexity that shines through at the end. Well-brewed and high octane, I loved it though it may not be as likeable as tamer Quads like La Trappe. Just shy of really drinkable."
"750ml bottle with a gold painted label - cork came off with an audible pop. Pours a deep red color with a thick, creamy white head. Aroma is spicey, with some cloves, coriander, and a little malt maybe even some citrus hops - a lot going on there. This beer tastes like a meal. Full of spices with a heavy body and a great warming feeling from the alcohol down the throat. Slightly tart, bitter finish with coriander that lingers on the palatte. An amazing brew, but at 10% I would advise sharing the bottle."
"Drinkability? Well, it's smooth. Not sure it would gain a whole lot from cellaring. It's not as if it has huge sugars to break down or a lot of hop to burn off. It may actually lose something over time. Age can't put in what wasn't there to begin with. A solid belgian clone, but not any kind of american grail, IMHO."
"Thanks to Avylover for sharing his bottle."
"750ml Corked Batch #1 I believe Pours a beautiful amber which is cloudy and with a fiery orange hue and a thick dense and frothy head. Head settles down a bit but retains well. Fantastic aroma, sugary, malty with notes of cherries, yeast and spices like pepper and clove. Wonderful. The mouthfeel is creamy, full and smooth with a delicate feel and a lively carbonation. The flavor is also one to desire. A sugary, malty spicy treat that has a faint and enjoyable hop presence which lends a slight grassy note. Not as complex or deep a flavor as some Belgian Quads we all are familiar with but I wasn't expecting that either. This is an American brew. Maybe with time it will mature a bit but it's wonderful right now in my opinion. An incredibly enjoyable flavor. This one's a winner folks. The best Allagash has brewed in my humble opinion. Way to go guys!"

"This is worthy of some extended aging. Nice Brownish orange color. Head is not huge, like you would expect from a belgian, but then again, it may still be fermenting in the bottle. Aroma is a menage of hops, bubble gum (which I would attribute to being young), and candi. Flavor is bold. Sticky sweetness blended with lots of hop flavor, and a tad bit of bitterness. Finishes long and sweet. Will be buying a couple more."
"Had this at Anam Cara during the launch, actually I started with this beer, and also made it my last beer of the evening. Allagash have themselves and very enjoyable and highly drinkable new beer. Pour was a cloudy cherry color. The aroma promised (me at least) raspberries. Served in an Allagash glass, the head above the beer is at least two inches of dense foam, which adds to the eye appeal. I was able to talk to the brewer, so I told him I thought the taste was reminiscent of the grand cru, but much more muted and blended (in a good way!). It had the spicey taste of the cru, but as he explained to me, there are no spices used in this one, the 'spiceness' in the taste comes from the brewing art/process itself. It was very smooth and drinkable (I did have two that evening), that I have to give it a 5 in that category, as the 10% is not apparent. Good stuff!"
"Poured at Anam Cara into an Alagash glass, this golden brown beer had and ample head. The aroma was of a mix of spices, primarily cloves, and a little sweet. The flavors were subtle, with a lot of clove spiciness, sugar notes. The fruit flavors, reminiscent of banana and pear, were rather understated. The brew was light, but well bodied. It was enjoyable, and I look forward to comparing the draft to the bottled Four."
