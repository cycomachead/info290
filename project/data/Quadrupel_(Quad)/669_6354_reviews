"This Quad from Landtsheer was decent.....at 12%abv was very smooth and easy to drink.  The beer poured a rich amber...maybe dark amber (was tough to tell with the darker room I was in) there was a sudsy head that dissipated and did not leave a lace.  The scent was typical of most Quads...not overpowering.  The taste was slightly tart with good Belgian sugar to balance it out.  The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall it was decent...and I am not a quad guy."

"Huge caramel and toffee flavors with banana accents. Like liquefied Bananas Foster. 12% ABV is undetectable."
"               My favorite only behind Westy 12. [4.5]"
"Medium carbonation. Smooth taste and finish. Alcohol taste is hidden and is a very drinkable quad. Not bitter at all with a good flavor."

"Not a bad beer per se but comes across rather weak, watery and generally chaotic as far as depth and balance go. The initial pour produced mostly all foam despite using a proper pour technique although it eventually settled into decent balance of body with head. The smell was really low-key although it had a nice variety of scents. The flavor and mouthfeel both seemed rather weak all-around, especially with the overly fizzy carbonation feel. Subsequent sips reminded me more of a bitter cola than a deep, balanced, and complex beer. Fair but certainly meet my expectations for a quad."

"3.48/5: Not really a Rochefort 10 killer, but enjoyable enough for me to kill the entire 750 with no trouble"

"Ruby with tinges of brown with a persistent finger of bubbly foam. The smell is fragrant with licorice and molasses present and some dark fruits. The taste is rich and sweet dark fruits with a bit of alcohol in the back. All in all a nice quad.  Thanks to Byronic for bringing this back from Belgium for me."

"Bottled in 2008. Murky dark rusty brown pour with a huge three finger head with decent retention and lacing. Sweet, malty, boozey nose with lots of brown bread and dark fruit along with hints of toffee, nuts, and subtle chocolate. The taste follows suit with rich dark fruit and sweet caramel malt along with hints of prunes, licorice, brown bread, tea, leather, subtle chocolate, and booze. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy with a surprising amount of fizzy carbonation still present for such an old beer. The boozey finish I remembered from fresher bottles has become much smoother with age. Overall, this has held up nicely in the cellar with only a slight criticism of a bit too much sweetness."

"Excellent beer, good sipper for a cold day such as today. I haven’t had this in over a year. In my opinion it is underrated, you got to drink it quite close to expiration date."

"Poured a super dark chestnut, pretty dark for a quad. A bit cloudy as well, light doesn't travel well through this. Not a bad thing necessarily, but interesting to note. Rum soaked raisins, hint of toffee, caramel, lots of Belgian candi sugar. I get a touch of roasted grains in the finish too, perhaps a touch of roasted barley or chocolate malt in here? Pretty nice quad. Doesn't really compare with the big guys like Rochefort 10 or Chimay Blue but will do in a pinch."
"Pretty good - seriously boozy but a pleasant sipper. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are very sweet and fruity. Plenty of dried fruit, sugar and yeast in evidence. Body is alright but could be a tad more unctuous for the strength. Goes down nicely enough; a tasty brew to finish with. Worth sampling if you have the chance."

"Overall this is a fine quad. it has that Belgian flavor you'd expect, with the fruits, the phenols, the yeast esters, and ties it all together rather than leaving it a muddled mess. It isn't shy at all about announcing its ABV, but why should it be? Not every beer has to disguise its strength. I'm impressed with this, and would definitely drink it again."

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, toffee, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with dark fruit and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but fairly boozy and strong."

"At 12% alcohol this is definitely a sipping beer, and a good one at that."

"330 ml. bottle. Pours an opaque brown almost black colour, with a head that fades quickly leaving a strong lace. Smells of dried fruits, figs, raisins, chocolate. Spicy and fruity. Sticky sweet palate, not much carbonation (and no needed). Taste of dried fruits, pepper, spices, chocolate. It warms your throat like brandy and leaves you asking for more, even with its 12º. Great."

"PAIRS very well with orange chicken for some reason"

"There is so much flavor playing in perfect harmony. Deep fruits almost like dried plums and raisins blend with a bright carbonated mouthfeel that ignites the booziness that is incredibly hidden for 12%. I'm not veteran enough to understand the flavors at play, but understand that it is supremely delicious and the best Quad I've had. Age these with care and you'll have a beer worthy of high regard."
"Overall this beer is a beast. Strong, complex, flavorful, and well balanced."

"O: Not a bad Quad, it has a nicely complex aroma and a decent flavor, it just doesn't stand up with some the heavy hitters of the style."
""
""
""
"It has an interesting flavor. I pick up some more malty sweetness, caramel, fig and date puree, and a light rum note. Still retains its carbonation. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a keeper for sure. People told me about Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus Abt 12, which seem to be very popular and highly rated and aren't bad, but this beer beats those by a mile. It's full of big flavors and aroma's with many layers and a much original flavor signature and balance to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yet to have a quad that blows my mind, this one was no exception. Regardless, I consider this a great beer and enjoyed the whole bottle from start to finish. For the price and given the availability, the likelihood of purchasing this beer again for me is high."
""
"O. Good aroma. Excellent sweet Belgian delciousness for flavor. Good full mouthfeel. Its not the epitome of the worlds best quads, but this is some really good beer."
""
"On tap at Dog Street Pub in Williamsburg. Perhaps it was that drinking this was an alternative to shopping with my girlfriend. But most likely, it was the quality that gives this such a good review. Such a classic quad: well balanced, rich and complex, barely a hint of its strong abv, and absolutely delicious going down. I think I'll have to buy one of DoG's awesome growlers and fill it with this. Worth the trip."
""
"O-A really nice beer. Fermented out this beer finishes dry with a nice estery Belgian yeast character and sweet toasted malt flavor. The strength is well hidden. Lacks the complexity in taste of a St. Bernardus or Westy quad but still an excellent beer."

""
"Easy to drink, covers the high ABV well."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before DL039/111(no idea). Pours very hazy extremely dark brown color with a 1 finger foamy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, apple, pear, prune, caramel, molasses, chocolate, toast, pepper, clove, earth, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity. Taste of raisin, prune, caramel, toast, molasses, chocolate, toffee, clove, earth, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, chocolate, toffee, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of flavors with good depth; no cloying flavors after the finish at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale! Very nice depth and complexity; and quite smooth to sip on. No idea on the age of this bottle; but I would have to say it probably is fairly old and it definitely holds up well. This is a very enjoyable sipper."

"O: Overall a good beer, but might get a bit better with age."
"This is essentially what you expect from a quad. Raisins, brown sugar, toffee, a little bit of chocolate. Lots of flavor in this, and all in a good way. A light carbonation in the beer with nice fine bubbles. Overall a very enjoyable drink, particularly when paired with a good meal."

"Overall this is a big beer. Lots of malt, dark fruit, and alcohol in this beer. Pretty good."
""
"Taste is full and quite alcoholic. The beer is malty and has strong caramalt character. It reminds of dark fruit candi sugar. The beer has 12% alcohol which is nicely hidden behind it's big body. The beer is too sweet for me. All together the beer has not enough to fascinate me."

"O - I found this beer enjoyable. While the alcohol is apparent in the nose I did not find it overwhelming in the flavor. The finish was the highlight of this beer for me because it leaves your palate with only a lingering flavor. This made me want more."
""
""
""
"On tap at Sessions in Greensboro.Poured into a tulip glass a deep amber color with a fluffy tightly formed one finger off white head that lasted for quite awhile.Raisin and plum notes in the nose along with lighter yeasty spice and brown sugar.Dark fruit dominates the palate with some medicinal notes,the alcohol is heavy and pretty sweet.It's a nice sipper but the yeast and alcohol can be a bit much....for me."
"O: Not easily drinkable, also a good beer."
""
""
""
"In draft at the source. Poured into Malhuer chalice/tulip. Creamy off-white head, high retention. Dark, dark ruby, almost black. Aroma, dates, light roast, almost chocolate sweetness. Taste creamy, coffee, chocolate malty sweet, creamy goodness. Excellent. Totally delicious. "

"overall - a very solid Quad. Just not quite as good as the top class, like St. Bernardus 12 or Rochefort 10. not as smooth and easy drinkin as those."
""
""
""
"O: A good beer, that I'd like to try again some place else. At this juncture, I can't recommend it."
""
""
"Smell is somewhat caramellic sweetness. Taset is good, a very drinkable quad but the alcohol is not really hidden."
"O - I've had superior quads to this. The ample sweetness and lack of notable flavors were negatives for me. I don't think this is undrinkable by any means. I just think there are better options. Seek out if you are a big fan of quads."

"almost a little too syrupy but the taste work well."
""
"Mmmmm, dangerous beer. Poured right out of the fridge, so too cold, but with a smallish tan head that slowly settles and no lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is lots of dark, ripe fruits, candies, malt, toffee, caramel. fruit, loam. Flavor’s a lot like nose, but with big sweetness tempered by good carbonic tang. Very well balanced as they say. Very little alcohol in the finish which is like flavor and of average length. Great, easy drinking, powerful brew."
"This pours a nice dark slightly hazy brown to dark red color with a large size off white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of grapes and dark fruit with a little alcohol. The feel is medium with lots of carbonation. The taste is pretty sweet, the dark fruit, some brown sugar and the alcohol burn on the way down, but still well masked for 12%."
"One I would definitely recommend."
"M: Thick and smooth, the way a beer that tastes like this should feel."
"Overall: Good beer. I liked it but thought it lacked the complexity of my favorite Quad, Trappiste Rochefort 10. Priced very well. i would purchase this one again."
"WS"
"O - This is a absolutely a good beer. Like I said; strong and tasteful. A delight for after dinner."
"O - This is a fantastic beer and is quite reasonably priced in my area (and in Chicago as well, where I first found a 750 mL bottle for roughly $10). As far as quadrupels go, I believe this is one of the best."
"Overall, I think I'll pass on this one next time. It was just too thick for me causing a sticky sweet residue in the mouth."
"Overall a really nice quadrupel. A little on the sweet end for my taste, though."
"Dr: Fair price, pretty drinkable, and low quality for the style."
"Nice aroma, with a bit of caramel and sour dough. The taste is a little on the alcoholy side with a sharp aftertaste. Not the best in the world, but a solid, above average quad. Bubbly in the mouth, which lingers for quite a bit. Overall a nice beer"
"Picked this one up as part of a mixed six pack at Liquormart in Boulder. Poured a hazy dark brown color with a creamy brown head. Aromas of yeast, spice and chocolate. On the palate, this one was medium bodied with flavors of dark raisins, spice, yeast and booze."
"Loosely translated from their website, the description says, “Take quiet time for you: the nice round and full taste will easily drinkable.” Assuming the broken grammar is due to structural discrepancies and that line wasn’t actually written by a southeast Asian immigrant, it’s more or less the case. If you want something strong that goes down pretty easy, this is a good choice. I just don’t recommend it after you’ve already had nine."
"So if it's like the first bottle i had, A+. Otherwise F. I rated the first bottle clearly."
"Does a good job of hiding the strength until the bottom of the glass, which felt a little overpowered by the alcohol."
"The mouthfeel was full with a constantly blooming carbonation."
"O- Merely an average quad. Decent but the metallic aftertaste and weak mouthfeel were subpar."
"O - Not what I expected here but this is beer was tasty. This beer SORT OF reminds me of a darker version of Stille Nacht. To me, nice spiced apple and warming alcohol brews."
"Mouth feel would also exceptional, but I found it almost numbing. Alcohol was at first hot but became more subdued as I drank it. This is a nice one to try. Very worthy of the style."
"Overall, impressive and pretty drinkable despite the richness and 12% ABV. Yum."
"Verdict: Imagine the most beautiful and exotic woman you can possibly imagine, then imagine that image as a beer and you have this. Must try for any beer aficionado..."
"750mL bottle served in my trusty chalice"
"D - Nice quad, really sweet, most definitely a sipper though."
"Good feel. Sweet and strong but complex and inviting and with a well placed level of carbonation. A very good Quad. that has no flaws in my view, lacking a bit in complexity only when compared with the best in the game."
"Rich flavor, as the dark fruit contingent carries through from the aroma to lace the palate with browned apple flesh, plum, and currants. The alcohol makes itself felt on the back of the palate with a hint of boozy sweetness & heat, but at no point is it overbearing. Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit thinner than I would have expected for the style and ABV, but I assume the uppity carbonation level probably has something to do with that. Overall, Malhuer 12° proved to be a tasty Belgian quad that hit the spot on a chilly Austin night. A worthy candidate for the cellar."
"Had a bottle at BXL on 43rd in Midtown for $11. Served in a stemmed Malheur glass, it appeared a hazy red with a short tan head. While this beer was a bit of a sipper, I was impressed by how smooth it was for the strength and that it was relatively drinkable compared to other 12% beers. The flavor was dominated by sweet vanilla and plum, with berry fruits and typical subtle Belgian spicing in the background. The hops were there mostly for balance and contributed little to the taste. Heck of a quad, one of the best I've had."
"D: Surprisingly easy to drink and very little booze apparent on the palate."
"For the price I think it'd be tough to find a better quad."
"Notes: Nice quad, not a flaw other than somehow it feels a notch or two behind grandeur and some of the biggies for the style, either the classics or some experimental ones. Still quite a remarkable and recommendable brew."
"D: The beer is actually quite drinkable considering its strength because most of the alcohol is masked from the taste. It's definitely one that needs to be sipped given the high alcohol content."
"The nose presents dark fruit overlaid by a faint graphite quality. The dark fruits open up on the palate, with the well-hidden alcohol incorporating into a mildly dry but flavor-packed whole. Mouthfeel is delicately fuzzy, but perhaps a bit on the flatter side. Lovely beer."
"Price = $3.99 at Whole Foods"
"D - super easy to drink for a quad. You only notice the ABV if you're looking for it; the strong aromas never clash; the carbonation is fun without becoming burdensome (as lagers and sodas are, at least for my gullet). If the slightly harsh sweet/bitter contrast evened out -- as I suspect more age might -- it would get 5.0 here too."
"drinkability - this is a nice QUad, no hint of booze despite the relatively high ABV, one that I will revisit"
"D - The booze element needs work or somoothing out. It seems like there would be more potential in this beer after some aging but this bottle wasn't great. That said, I wouldn't mind sitting down to really work at this one given the reviews I've read."
"This is a wonderful, rich and complex Belgian Quad...the best I've had in a long time. I would easily buy this again for a special occasion. I have to say that after having recently drank St. Bernardus, Rochefort, the Reverand, Urthel Samaranth, and Rigor Mortis, this one is clearly my favorite. The mouthfeel, character, cleanliness, complexity and nuance make this a winner. Highly recommended!"
"D: Maybe this should be aged for 5 years before drinking. It is super smooth and there is really no immediate hint of the ABV other than the taste of lingering sugar. The carbonation really killed this beer for me. Once it settles down it was fine. It just really lacked the complexity I am looking for in the style."
"The beer gains flavor and mouthfeel as it warms. Don't drink it too cold. The smell is predominantly figs, raisins, and sour cherries. It has a faint vinous overtone. The taste is a mild and malty toasted brown sugar. I had a Westvleteren a year ago and if my memory serves me correctly this beer is not as sweet and fruity. The mouthfeel is a pleasant lubrication that cries out for a medium bodied dry cheese like a pecorino or Parmesan. Share this beer, otherwise it may be one and done."
"A little rough around the edges, yet still very controlled for a Quad--a treat to drink. The road most taken would be blue-veined cheese with some fig spread ... a bit more daring would be a pork loin with mole sauce."
"D) Truly enjoyed this one -- an excellent Quad. Beware: packs a punch with 12% ABV"
"Notes: i think its impossible to make a BAD quad/bsd. this one is pretty textbook"
"A lingering flavor of sweet cherries makes it quite plesant. I should have bought another for cellering."
"D- It is fairly easy drinker for the 12%abv which is too well hidden, i enjoyed this, albiet a bit to quick, a 750ml was no problem finish by myself. This is one of my favorite fall time beers, but it usually is a one and done."
"Drinkability: I would have this beer again, although I would limit this to one per night. It's a heavy hitting beer, but a very tasty one."
"D: Definitely something to sip slowly. I should definitely be splitting this bottle with a friend, but I'm not, so I'm sure I'll be falling out of my chair pretty soon. Very good beer. Picked it up on a whim and am not disappointed!"
"Drinkability: Very, very, good a unique flavor profile for a Belgian quad. Frankly a flavor I want more of, this beer will always be found in my cellar."
"Drinkability: Though not in the top echelon with respect to complexity, this is certainly a fine and well-balanced quad"
"jd"
"at the end of the day, a very nice while not quite a masterful quad. i will definitely have it again, though, possibly as part of a blind quad tasting... would love to throw it up against rochefort 10, the koningshoeven quad, st bernardus abt 12, southampton's take on the style, urthel samaranth possibly, and maybe a local, say pretty things baby tree. and, in a perfect world, westvleteren 12. :)"
"Great after dinner beer, with its light sweetness and great mouthfeel. You do start to feel the high ABV after a few sips though."
"Drinkability if fantastic. This is one of my favorite quads, no one of my favorite beers. I like it even better with a few years of cellaring, it becomes an amazing beer. Buy two, drink one, save one for a few years. Better yet, buy a case and try one every 4 to 6 months. Seek out this beer."
"Carbonation is suitably high. Alcoholic heat is quite noticeable."
"Note: Drink like a wine, not a bud-lite! :)"
"Pours a dark black/brown color with barely any film. Dark malt aroma with some sugary spices. Malty taste, with the addition of dark fruits like fig, date, and plum. Mild carbonation, and medium-bodied. This is an ok beer, but it doesn't particularly impress me in the flavor department... seems to be missing a bit of the spices in the taste."
"Delicious and sweet/spicy, this beer is a delight for all Belgian beer fans, particularly those of Chimay Blue, but with a sweetness that trends toward Kasteel Bruin."
"D: exceptionally easy to drink for a 12%, but not quite as good in this department as its nitro brother. Overall, this is an excellent and unique quad now in heavy rotation among my regulars."
"Washes down pretty well, and not overly carbonated. A bit heavy to be drinking much of it. Then again this was towards the end of the night and I was a little saturated."
"A tasty Quad with plenty going on. An interesting yeast profile supports the malt."
"D - I would expect a quad to have more complexity, It reminds me of the Trois Pistols. If that is the case then this is a very solid brew."
"This is a little less yeasty than the bottle version but the strength is still very present. A good beer bur for later at night."
"D: really enjoyable beer all around. Nice robust brew and will only have one due to the alcohol presence."
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer but it was more of a BSDA than a quad - it just didn't have the thickness and heavier malt profile of the latter. Still, a decent beer that's worth a shot."
"The pour is a dark brown color with a very small off white head. The flavor is amazingly complex. Starts off with sweet molasses flavors and goes all over the place. Chocolate, dark fruit sweet flavors everywhere. Finished with a nice floral hop finish and just the right amount of bitterness. Fairly thin for its complexity and alc. content. Goes down amazingly easy for 12 percent. Loved it. Will be seeking it in the near future."
"D: I wouldn't call this a by the numbers quadrupel, it's certainly well made, and a nice complexity as I expect. Just missing something to make me go crazy, the flavours are quite good."
"Pours a rich, opaque dark-chocolate brown with a nice fine-bubbled light tan head. Aroma is malty and has an overtone of hard cider. Malty flavor has a strong fruity and brandy-like tone, as well as a hint of chocolate and just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth and quite fizzy."
"D - A tasty quad w/ lots of complexity which I am glad I tasted as it opens up slightly warmer - I also was happy to taste in a more relaxed setting than previous since it has subtlety to pick up. It doesn't taste anything like 12%, it displayed most of the flavor near cellar temp I prefer something like this as a nightcap beer"
"D: A bit cloying and big ABV (though disguised well) hurt drinkability. I'll keep the other 4 around for an ocassion."
"F: Still very sweet lingering but it gets a slight dryness. Some creamy taste lingering, not really boozy anymore. More lingering raisin and a touch of smoke. Despite having a boozy taste and warmth there was no alcohol burn or real feel otherwise. And way too sweet."
"An excellent, well crafted Belgian quad."
"Overall, not the best Quad I've had, but very unique and enjoyable."
"Cheers!"
"* = ideas from fellow tasters"
"Not a session beer, but good with friends."
"All in all, it's a good brew, but a bit overloaded on the sweetness."
"Pours a brownish body with good head and a lace ring on top of a yeasty, spicy dark fruit and orangeish smell. Caramel and other sugary sweetness emerge. Very smooth and creamy, I never would've guess that this is classified as a quad. A little chewey for a medium-bodied beer, there are a plethora of dark fruit flavors like cherrt and orange surrounded by sugary sweet malts like caramel and hints of toffee. A little sticky its so sweet, but finishes sweet and a little dry like a biscuit for some reason. ABV is well-hidden and this is just a great quad."
"drinkability: a very complex and well balanced brew.a tad expensive, but worth it once in a while."
"D: This beer drinks much lighter than its high ABV should allow. I was finished with my glass in what felt like minutes. It was a sub-zero night when I drank this, and it was a perfect way to keep warm in the cold."
"Foam spicy or salty. Nose slightly chocolaty and fruity with aromas of sweet wine more marked. The taste of alcohol and toasted malt are certainly present but they are not powerful. By cons, it is much more pungent than the others ""style quad"" It also feels slightly fruity (rum). The end of mouth is dry, bitter and most persistent feature of beers Malheur."
"This is a nice quad, but not much more. Tasty and satisfying, but not nearly the most impressive quad on the market."
"complex and loving it, really good stuff here"
"D: We both loved this; I think this deserves more attention. This was never on my radar in the States; you can be sure I'll pick up more to enjoy."
"This is fairly well made, but not on the same level as my favorites.... I will however, certainly buy it again anytime I want a decent priced well made BSDA."
"D - Irrespective of the very high ABV, this is more than drinkable for the style and I recommend it as an end to an evening in a brandy snifter or Duvel tulip. NOT FOR FOOD."
"Drinkability: I dont want another now for sure. I did enjoy this quite a bit, but a whole 750 is too much for one person. This thing drinks like port, and a small serving would be better."
"Taste: Fierce, bright alcohol upfront that gives way to the most delicious, yummy sweetness! Dramatic 180 here. The finish does have a spicy peppery-ness to it."
"Dark chocolate malt flavor with some nice spicy notes, especially pepper, cinnamon and brown sugar. There are also some nice dark fruit notes; plum, raisin, fig, etc. as well as some brown sugar, candi sugar, subtle hops and some sweet alcohol warmth in the finish."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again but on another day, worth the try if you like a strong intense fruit and malt profile."
"Brouwerij De Landtsheer has the uncanny ability to blow me away. The evidence includes Bier Brut (Brut Reserve), Brut Noir (Black Chocolate), Malheur 10... and now Malheur 12. This is an outstanding quadrupel that put me in the happy zone by the bottom of the first glass and is having no trouble keeping me there."
"D- Not bad, but not excellent either. Pretty average when compared to other beers within the style. There is alcohol is way too hot in this one, it could definitely benefit from some aging."
"I'm saying that in my book, this one is quite drinkable, flavorwise. But, being 12%ABV, you wouldn't need to have more than a couple."
"D. For the price, I wouldn't. I would like to try this again though, as I really don't think the bottle is 'sposed to blow up like it did. Maybe this was stored poorly or somesuch. In any event, this bottle of Malheur 12 is curious and has merit, but is ultimately flawed. Ahh well, you can't win 'em all."
"This is a very drinkable and tasty brew, very quenching-one knock though: The sediment. It disturbs easy and while not nearly attaining a drainpour, I don't find sedimented brews very drinkable unless they are fantastic and well...this one is."
"Wonderful initial flavors that tend to get a bit ""too sweet"" as you drink. Big flavors of prunes and figs. A quality and heavy brew with great mouthfeel and flavors. Might even be great with dessert or as an after dinner drink. Nice and well made; likely couldn't drink too much."
"Dark muddy brown with tons of sediment and a light tan head. Plums, cola and sweet fruity aroma. Flavor is caramel, plum, cola, toffee, spicy, floral, dark fruits. Smooth, thick feel. Sweet but complex Belgian Quad. I enjoyed this, but it did not wow me like some of the other Quads currently on the market."
"Drinkability is extremely good for this beer. Considering the alcohol level it is not overwhelming at all. This beer is a great ager as well!"
"OVERALL: This quad has a lot of roasted and smoky qualities, reminding me very much of an imperial stout or porter. Since these are some of my favourite styles, I found this brew very enjoyable. The softness of palate was quite a treat, and the 12% ABV was only noticeable in its effects, not in the taste or feel. A very enjoyable an dangerously drinkable beer, this is one I look forward to having again."
"This poured a nearly opaque mahogany with considerable sediment and fluffy tan head. It smelled very malty, like roasted barley and caramel and nuts, with a bit of raisin and alcohol. Perhaps a hint of grassy hops? It tasted very sweet too, with sugary caramel and creamy yeast dominating, followed by nutty and wheat malts and prune, and a bit of cinnamon and alcohol. It was slightly thick and silky with moderate carbonation at first that subsided over time, and a sweet & sour aftertaste. Overall this was delicious, complex, and delicious. It had fantastic depth to the flavor that I'm sure I missed part of. It had a nice, smooth body too. The alcohol wasn't very strong considering the 12%, so this was quite easy to drink. This was my favorite Belgian ale while still cold, since I usually need to let them warm up and mellow out before I can fully enjoy them. But this was immediately great, and only improved as it warmed. An all-around solid brew fresh, and I could imagine this further improving with age."
"D: Very drinkable, given the balance, texture, flavor, etc. The 12% ABV is fairly well hidden, although there is some hotness. I'd love to try this with a couple more years on it."
"Flavors are mellow and balanced, lots of alcohol coming through the fruity components, but it is not out of control. It is crisp and refreshing as well as giving off a subtle richness that is very satisfying. Very enjoyable beer, perhaps a little too hot for everyday sipping but this would be great on a cold and rainy Sunday."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, some dark fruits. The taste is very nice malty/yeasty, some nice figs/raisins/plums notes, slight spice. Medium body, nice warming effect, the ABV is hidden very well with this one. Very drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"Overall a very solid quad from Malheur. I am glad i picked up a couple of these to put some age on. Defenitely one of the better quads I've had. Westy 12 is still my baby, but this one is defenitely a good alternative. Would like to see some smaller bottles around, but man, this is good stuff."
"This beer was paired with a pork tenderloined brined with the beer, cheddar scallion potato cake and a parsnip, mushroom, bacon mix (that part didn't quite fit the menu's description so I won't give the fancy menu wording) at The Monk's Kettle New Year's Eve Malheur Beer Dinner. It went well with the pork and potato, but not so well with the semi-bitter parsnip sautee."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown color body. Small off-white head head, quickly diminishing. Funky smell, sour. Dark fruits.. Creamy mouthfeel, some fizziness. Dark fruit taste Some dark chocolate/coffee taste. Some alcohol warmness."
"It is very well-balanced. Creamy and complex. Alcohol shows only slightly, making it very approachable for abv. Very drinkable for a ""big"" beer. Very enjoyable!"
"Pours a hazy copper with a frothy off-white head. Spice, bubble gum, caramel, plums, figs, and yeast in the nose. Rich, velvety mouthfeel. Vinuous taste along with molasses and the darker fruits. Heavy malt, but more like a sweeter cognac than caramel. Warm alcohol finish. A very nice beer."
"The dark fruit, caramel maltiness, and subtleties in lacing make the Malheur 12 exceptionally soft in the mouth, but the beer does not round out enough in the end to make it really drinkable in the long run. Fantastic beer for a glass, but reluctant to drink continuously."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian quadrupel."
"Had this at The Metropolitan in Baltimore. The appearance is typical quad; chocolate brown with an airy off white head. The smell is of chocolate and alcohol, and some rich roasted malt. The flavor I find to be similar if not better than st. bernadus abt12. I think Malheur 12 has a richer chocolate flavor to blend with the alcohol where the sbt12 lets the alcohol to do more of the talking. The rich chocolate also helps the balance because less sharp astringent alcohol you test the easier it is to balance with a little hops. Mouth feel is bubbly and quick to evaporate. drinkability is good for a quad do to it's balance which is do to it's rich chocolate malt flavors."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Overall thin and watery if you ask me. Anything coming from Belgium should be much heartier. This is one that I'll not ever buy again, I'm glad I didn't waste money on a four-pack of this, I'm glad that I received this as a free sample. Just not anywhere near to par in my book. It just doesn't cut it as any type of beer, too much cough syrup going on in here."
"This is a good desert beer i think i'd like to enjoy this one if i was relaxing on the back porch after a big meal watching the sun go down. I'll keep this one on the list until the next time that happens.."
"I would weakly recommend this beer. I had this bottle at Paters Vaetje (""Monk's Casket"") in Antwerp."
"Not a bad beer but one in a style that has quite a few top beers in the world in it. Not a bad beer but Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or is cheaper in the same place I bought this and a superior beer. Not bad but there are better."
"A very good beer, a good pair for some robust flavors, but for sure behind the holy graals of Quads (Westwleteren, Rochefort and St. Bernardus)."
"D: It's an wonderful after dinner or late evening sipper. Would pair up nicely with a cigar."
"a drinkable beer for sure."
"I think this brew could be a real contender to the Roc line... Unfortunately the alcohol was way to evident and knocked this brew down for me. Maybe this brew needs to mellow a few years in a cellar to bring out more flavors to mask the alcohol. Drinkability is poor due to the evident and burning alcohol."
"Poured ( I drank this around 70° f due to unusual circumstances) out a dark amber color, it was almost black and was topped with a slightly tan head about three fingers thick and very fluffy, but it quickly thinned out into a thin ring around the glass. Thee was quit a bit a yeast on the bottom of the snifter. The bottle also kept on foaming and the head just kept pouring out of the bottle (something new for me, I had never seen this before). There is some very active carbonation; it has a very floral aroma that's sweet and fruity, there is a strong alcohol aroma as well. Its warm on the tongue and very smooth, there is a very faint bitterness to it on the sides of my mouth, it is spicy has a fairly thick body. It leaves a dry aftertaste in your mouth and the alcohol is really evident, but it is not too overwhelming. I will be trying this beer again, and even drinking it at a higher temperature than normal its pretty good."
"An tasty beer, while it does not do a good job of hiding its substantial strength, it never gets hot or harsh and the alcohol seems to integrate with the other notes. The light body on this brew was also quite nice, never cloying or sticky, yet still rich, satisfying and a sipping brew."
"Really pretty drinkable for what it is. My expectations were low after tasting the ridiculously sweet Malheur 10, but I was pleasantly surprised when the sugars were only slightly overpowering in this."
"Dark brown/burgundy pour. Full, creamy foam. Nose could be better but it has some dark fruit, hops and yeast. Flavor is awfully complex, nicely malty with lots of Belgian character. Brown sugar, caramel, toffee along with hints of dark fruits. Well balanced . It's a really nice ale."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and a little too carbonated for my taste. It's not awful or excessive but it could stand to be fuller. Luckily despite this, the mighty 12% alcohol is not detectable in the flavor. It does however warm the insides. Fairly drinkable for a monstrous beer."
"D - You can't really judge this against a low abv session beer, knowing this is 12% abv. Full of flavor on every sip, its a beer to spend a whole night with."
"Not as thick and smooth as a Quad should be, and a bit too boozy. Smells great, though."
"This variety is definitely worth a try, though I'm not sure I'll be tempted to have another."
"Chocolate brown colour, little head, expirey 9/09. Thanks Boutip. Malt and some spicey yeast, with the emphasis on the spice. I taste ginger, balck pepper, star anise. Alcohol fairly masked. Above avrage mouthfeel, tasty treat that is expertly spiced malt. Very good Belgium.Dangerously drinkable."
"Pretty good. It lacks the beautiful balance of Malheur 10. I was stoked when I saw this one on the shelf, but for the price of a decent wine, I have no desire to ever try it again. Again, the balance was not right on even though the flavor was little more than a trinity of fruit, malt, and alcohol. That said, I do love the experience of drinking a .75L bottle. Initial expectations & initial tastings vs. final thoughts & final feelings are always swayed by alcohol and the possible disappointment of spending too much on a bottle of 'beer'. Sometimes it is totally worth it, sometimes it is 'why'd I buy that?'. I'll stick to Malheur 10 from now on... why fix what's perfect?"
"Body was medium and carbonation was suprisingly low considering how explosive the opening and pouring were. Of 1100 beers sampled now this has to be one of the biggest let downs ever. That is not to say that this isn't a good beer, because it is, but I really do not believe that this deserves the avg rating that it has."
"Recommended..."
"My first from this brewery... you can rest assured I will be trying more."
"A well rounded great tasting beer.I have tasted most of the quality Belgians and this rates right up there with the best. Highly recommended."
"I highly recommend this one, a great Belgian!"
"Drinkability - A highly sippable ale that leads from glass to glass in almost no time."
"Full and creamy with good use of carbonation. Very rich and still well balanced. Good brew, but more similar to a BSDA than my idea of a quad."
"Drinkability: A good beer with plenty of flavor and complexity. For the most part, I'm enjoying the Malheur brews."
"Final verdict? While this doesn't blow my mind, it's obviously an extremely well-crafted beer. With the second pour, I swirled and dumped the yeast in for the hell of it. It doesn't seem to alter the taste much, but now I'm getting an interesting perfume-y smell coming from my chalice. Also, there's a distinct almond nuttiness in the aftertaste I'm noticing now that I didn't notice before. Glad I have a couple more bottles, as I think this one deserves further investigation. I have a feeling this is one of those beers you can't fully know in one tasting....need to relax and let the subtleties reveal themselves."
"Pours dark brown, with a big white head. Darker than expected. Aroma is apples, figs and some spice, along with dark malts. Flavor is dark candi sugar up front, followed by more apple and figs, along with some spicy notes and fruit. Aftertaste is pleasant and warming."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice slightly off-white foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt contains some dry fruits characteristics which are quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by some dry fruits characteristics with some nice candi sugar notes. I didnt notice that much of a hoppy presence as I was expecting but nonetheless I very much enjoyed the experience. Full body with some great carbonation and no alcohol was detectable."
"One of the best Belgians I have had the pleasure to drink."
"250 ml bottle, bought in Frederikshavn, Denmark. Hazy dark brown colour, large tan head. Pleasant aroma of dark malts, hops, chocolate, oak and bakery. Flavour is heavy dark malts, sweet, oaky and spicy. Hoppy finish. Warming mouthfeel as expected from a 12% ABV beer, theres a certain ""raw"" and alcoholic edge (not entirely pleasant) that probably would benefit from a few years in a cellar. Powerful stuff, with a potential for improvement!"
"I could barely finish 1 glass, so drinkability is low for me."
"BB 23-03-08. Nice, ultrathick, big bubbeld yellowish head and very darkbrown beercollor. Nose is ultra malty, straw and caramel, litle roast, raisins, oak and explosive alcohol amounts. Good but IMO bombastic. Taste is also very strong malted, sweet but not overdone in this one, in composite of the alcohol that burns like whiskey together with the partly roasty genuiatly dosed bitterness. Carramellic coffee is what I would discripe this one and not high but still too high dosed carbonisation is strange in this extra stout like quadruppel. Recomendable IMO but take your time for it."
"dark brown -- aromas of maple, oak, molasses, raisin, cherry cough drops, vanilla and sweet brown spices. Robust flavors of brandied, dried fruits, mashed nuts and old vintage port. The fizz is minor. The effect is dessert-like. I'll save this for later this evening."
"the color is the deepest, darkest brown wood that you can imagine. light tan head thayed throughout the whole beer. Aroma is chocolatey, alcohol, spicy, yeasty. This smells like an adult chocolate milk shake. Taste is malty, bittersweet chocolate, dry. Lots of carbonation for a 12% beer. Tough pour with a lot of yeast in the glass."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Heavy alcohol taste detracts a bit but not too much."
"It is a dark ruby-brown color with a big tan head. The aroms is spicy and yeasty. It is very malty with some fruity esters and a slight bitter choclate taste. It finishes with flowery hops, though the bitterness is restrained. There is also a peppery spice that helps balance out the malts. A delicious beer."
"Turbid deep bister hue. Thick, dogged, uniform beige head leaves attractive lace. Deep, dark chocolate and minty ethanol waft to the nose at first. Ensuing is a combination of mild banana esters, black licorice and clove. Cocoa presence becomes more pronounced as the brew breathes. Relatively clean, but quite seductive aromawise. Dominant in flavor is a rich, semisweet chocolate and alcohol derived black pepper presence. Actual alcohol harshness is virtually absent. Esters are subdued, but multifaceted, with seemingly equal proportions of ripe plum, banana and bubblegum complementing chocolate character. Clove seemlessly emerges after a deliberation, adding an herbal twang. Dextrinous in body, with a mouthfeel one notch shy of viscous and creamy. Toffeeish dark candi sugar hints arise late, adding additional depth to residual sweetness. Finishes simply sweet with chocolate cookie hints melding with ethanol warmth. A delicious Dark Strong with pronounced, but well controlled chocolate character and just enough yeast derived nuances to pull it all together. Ranks amongst the very most drinkable high gravity brews I've encountered thus far. Highly recommended. Props to AKSmokedPorter for the delivery."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for including me in this shipment."
"Medium-high body."
"(11.2 oz bottle)"
"Pours a clear but deep dark garnet with a nice cream-colored head. The smell of raisons, yeast, and light spices and alcohol bellow from the frothy foam. It has a sweetness that is obvious from the beginning and slides into the raison, fruit, spices, and light hops. What is simply amazing is that at 12%abv, it is not as apparent as you would think although there is a warming feeling that comes over you. It is light bodied and finishes quite sweet. Somewhat bold and tasty! Op uw gezonheid!"
"Bottom line: loved this beer, it's exactly why I've fallen in love with Belgians after living in the Netherlands for a year. Buy it if you can find it!"
"Deep garnet tinged murly brown color. Fluffy, creamy dense tan head, bubbles up and fades fast. Tiniest bit of lacing around the edge of the glass. Nice sweet carmel smell matched with hints of maple syrup and vanilla. Taste is a supersmooth combination of the above with stronger vanilla notes to compliment. Sweetness is very present, almost hints of maple syrup. Streak of flowery hops whispers by, and leaves you wondering. Then a carmel and sticky to finish. Alcohol is only noticable at the very very end, with just a hint of alcohol burn. Medium bodied, slick slightly syrupy but so smooth. 12 % Abv sneeks up on you, watch out, but give it a try !"
"Quite a change from their other beers that are all golden to orange in color, this ones dark and brooding with a monstrous head, frothy in texture, beige in color and as it degrades, leaves a nice sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is malt sweet, plummish, hints of yeast and even some caramel, well thats the way this old honker smells it. Start sweet, loads of malt, top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is mildly acidic, hops are delectable in their spicy presence, the aftertaste alcohol bitter, dry and long lasting, quite a Belly Warmer to boot, not meant for the Light Weights, its a BA Beer."
"Comments: Very enjoyable. She is definitely sweet. Will definitely remember this one. Highly recommended. Thanks to the MJ Beer Club International for this one."
"I don't like the label, it looks rotted, but it really doesn't matter in reality. It pours deep reddish-brown with a foamy white head. The head bubbled down into a denser layer that held. It has an orange liquor smell on the nose. It has a strong bitterness across the tongue but leaves a slightly sweet aftertaste. It was thick in the mouth and I found it drinkable although you'll certainly feel it after a while. Curious to have it off of tap. I'll definatly revisit."
