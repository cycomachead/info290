Spices become visible in a slightly peppery and licorice fashion, while also compliementing to the sweetness. The balance remains, because of earthy malts, along with hazelnuts and a Coca-Cola note. Finishes with a gentle coffee note, which isn't bitter at all, due to the more present cane sugar and nougat, accompanied by a tingly spiciness.","aleigator","Dec 26, 2014"

4.2,-3.2,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18E). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 5528260913- AROMA: nice dried fruits aromas, reminiscent of raisins and dried figs, with a sweet and caramel/vanilla malt background. no roasted aromas, nor hops and diacetyl. alcohol aromas are spicy and pleasant and not solventy, with an old Port like quality. APPEARANCE: dark brown color with a slight ruby tint. nice moussy brown head with good retention. TASTE: well balanced flavours similar to the aromas (raisins and dried figs) with a sweet and caramelly/vanilla Port like background. moderate bitterness that balances the sweetness. finishes medium-dry. no roasted flavours. gente alcohol warmth and not solventy. PALATE: smooth medium body with medium carbonation with a smooth alcohol warmth noticeable. OVERALL: a very nice, complex dark belgian ale with a plethora of aromas to dive in. And very dangerous...","titvs","Sep 05, 2014"

4.51,3.9,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"The mouthfeel maintains the balance that seems impossible almost perfectly. it has to even out the dryness, biting acidity, and tartness, along with the wood and fusel notes contributed, with what would otherwise be a cloying and sticky sweetness such that the extreme of each side is avoided without confusing the tongue to exasperation. The body has lots of texture and, while full, edges back toward medium to keep from being too heavy. Crispness is firm from beginning to end, while a creamy smoothness takes nothing away from it.","Brenden","Jul 28, 2014"

Aroma of sweet stone fruits, brown sugar malts and bubblegum yeast. The taste follows the nose with bubblegum and vinous and tart stone fruit. Nice brown sugar finish. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Very light with a nice texture. Overall a very sweet and tart Quad with a wonderful mouthfeel. Drinks way too easy for 10%.

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little dry, slightly chewy, a little sticky, a little filling, and the taste did a really nice job at holding my attention, I'll have no problem drinking a full bottle and I wouldn't rule out on sipping on a couple of these throughout the night. I think this would be a nice beer to enjoy in the fall and winter. What I liked the most about this beer was that it was very true to style and it had a nice amount of complexity, to me those were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but it kind of sucks that it isn't available where I live. I would for sure buy this beer if I saw it, I would love to try a fresh one and keep some around in the cellar. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone and I think it's a must try if you like Quads. All in all I was very happy with this beer and a little impressed, It lived up to all the good things I have heard about it. So far I think this is one of the better Quads I've had, I think Rocherfort 10 is still my favorite, but this would be number two. This made for a great first impression for De Struise and I will for sure be on the look out for more beers from this brewery. Great job guys, this was one outstanding beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Apr 25, 2014"

Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, molasses, dark fruit, spice, and slight cardboard aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, toffee, molasses, fruit, and roast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness and a slight alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an interesting mix of aromas and flavors all around.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 07, 2014"

This is not a ""classic"" rendition of a quad - and by that, I really mean that this isn't the version popularized with the Trappists offerings that broke ground commercially in the last century. Given the experimental nature of Belgian brewing and its history of making other beverages (most notably wine), this is a hardcore rustic quad at its basis, with new influences (DSB is highly inspired by American craft brewing). In a way, it's the best of both worlds - malty and rich (old world), yet hoppy and spicy as well (new world). I have a bunch of Pannepots aging right now. I simply cannot wait to crack them over for the next few years.","magictacosinus","Feb 09, 2014"

I get raisins all day in the long finish. one thing impressive here is the lack of alcohol presence for a beer so strong. very well disguised, this drinks like a 6% brew. some allspice and faint Belgian yeast in the finish, but I am so distracted by the fruity apple juice type flavors that I don't love the whole picture. for a beer with such acclaim I expected more, not to say I didn't like it, but I was just underwhelmed. the same was true with the reserva version, so maybe its something about this beer that's just disagreeable, maybe its my messed up notion of what a quad should be, I don't know. full body and lively carbonation is very nice, especially with the absence of booze, even at room temperature. a fine brew, but not really my speed.","StonedTrippin","Beers"

Pours very cloudy nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big plum, raisin, fig, pear, apple, banana, caramel, toast, candi sugar, molasses, clove, pepper, coriander, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of malt, spice, yeast esters with a great malt/ester balance; and great strength. Taste of big plum, raisin, fig, pear, apple, banana, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, clove, pepper, candi sugar, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, candi sugar, clove, pepper, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark malt flavors with big robustness; great malt/yeast flavor balance, and zero cloying sweetness on the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Belgian strong dark ale! All around fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of yeast, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Oct 31, 2013"
4.27,-1.6,4.25,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The body was way more thin than I look for in the style, not watery by any means, just not as full as I've come to expect. Drinkability was, of course, excellent. The only tick against it was the solid alcohol presence, it made the beer a bit too ""sippy"" for me. Overall, since this is one of the prototypes for the style, obviously this was a top notch brew. A must try on any beer lovers list. I'll grab a few bottles for the cellar, and probably put it into semi-regular rotation.","beertunes","Oct 31, 2013"

The smell is sweet with a strong dark fruit and caramel presence. I'm also getting some Belgian spice in the nose. The taste is quite smooth, I'm guess this has smoothed with the aging. I'm getting sweet dark fruit, Belgian spice, and a bubble gum like note. The finish has some chocolate in it as well, but the sweetness doesn't really linger. The carbonation is very fine, honestly it could use a bit more. The finish is quite dry. I'm really enjoying this beer and I'd gladly have another.","oline73","Aug 17, 2013"

It has the typical raisin/plum taste and smell, but this one is so much more. There's a hint of a stout as well - coffee and dark roasted malt. Also, there's a nice oaken flavor to it. I would call this one very complex - so many different things to taste in this beer and the aroma is very complex as well. I very much like this beer.","BrianJohnson","May 16, 2013"

Dark brown, syrupy like pour with little tan head that dies quick on top of a very yeasty, citrusy and candi-sugar like aroma. Definite sweetness packed with that typical Belgian orange-like yeast strain as well as some pepper and sharp spices and touches of dark fruit (my wife detected sour fruit but can't say I picked it up). Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, a little thick and sticky, not that much though, and the taste is similiar to the nose although I do detect a sticky, syrupy licorice type sweetness. Good amount of fruits like touches of citric fruits and dark fruits (figs being number one, maybe raisins) along with great balance from sturdy malt backbone and the ABV gives off a complentary edge to the finish and helps mellow out, but not kill, the beer as it warms. Great sipper and a definite must try.","clayrock81","Apr 04, 2013"

As the head gracefully settled to a thin sheet, I peered into the glass and saw my own reflection. As I looked to my own reflection I finally realized where I went wrong in my life. I'm sorry Suzanna. As I tasted this ale I heard the rose breasted finch's mating call in early autumn. Fig that has been recently been in a snowstorm, cherry with a rough childhood, bark off of an old wise maple tree, chestnuts from the wrong side of town, chocolate that has been melted twice frozen once melted again and then half frozen aged at room temperature ad then slivered .. to finally be melted, and then lastly frozen, are all tastes that come to my mind while I drink this old fishermans ale.","Amandipius","Feb 13, 2013"

Great spice complexity - coriander, clove, and cardamom flavors stand out over the malt. Fig and cherry fruit flavors meld well with the spiciness. Caramel, molasses, a dusting of bakers chocolate, and short bread. Full and slightly sweet finish, but it's not problematic since its so well balanced against the big, complex flavors and a hint of ethanol. Some hoppy woodiness rounds it out. Obviously, a beer that should be enjoyed over time, but I find the glass emptying quickly.","bump8628","Jan 31, 2013"

Taste is rich, loaded with dark fruits, black cherries, red licorice, nice rum raisin booziness that is light and refined. Finishes with chocolate and cocoa. Enormous rich, full-bodied, complex.

A lovely chewy mouth-feel with flavours of rich plums, dried fruits and toffee, caramel and fruit and nut chocolate again. Mild carbonation and CO2 prickle. A little dry to finish with a peppery linger and a warming alcohol hum. Mild bitterness and subtle sourness are superbly balanced overall. Just great!","AdmiralNelson","Apr 04, 2012"

A taste rich and dark that encouraged me to let it ramble across all the taste buds in my mouth before swallowing. Swallow was smooth and rich. Initial taste was rich caramel apple with a hint of fig. A rich molasses finish with a bit of bitterness that was initially a bit difficult to overcome, As if the caramel had come within a whiff of being singed. Yet, I found myself sighing and shaking my head in appreciation after each swallow. I don't agree with the boozy comment of another reviewer. This beer keeps its ABV under wraps. The glass grew on me as I continued. This beer is a sipper. I am not sure that I will seek another out, but I will be grateful if one presents itself.","BeerIsPoetry","Mar 13, 2012"

4.35,0.2,4,4,5,3.5,4,"Looks like a quad but perhaps the nearly 6 years in the bottle has really reduced the carbonation. It does not look like most Belgian beers based on carbonation. Its very dark and very little light gets through the very deep brown reddish tone. The smell however, does have that spiced quad smell without any doubt. It has that figgy smell mixed with spices. Very nice and no booze in the scent what so ever. However it is not outstanding in anyway but definitely above average. Now this beer's taste is basically why it is so well known and sought out. There is no sign of alcohol what so ever and the 10% has to be a lie. It has all of the flavors you would expect in a Belgian dark beer such as this. There are the dark fruity flavors and spices mixed together very well. One of the best tasting Quads I have had in a very long time and I am really not into quads. But perhaps the aging of this beer has been the key. The mouthfeel however is slightly above average and what I expected. Its got a very low level of carbonation and has a medium mouthfeel. I was expecting a more dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is solid. I gave it a 4 because its great, but not making me go and purchase the last one I saw at the store. Its easy to drink, if you like Belgian beers, however there are others out there that are better. But nonetheless, this is a very good beer and I would grab it if I was you to try and see for yourself.","Vancoubeer","Beers"
4.55,4.8,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Wow. Where to start. Pannepot has fruity and jammy notes without the underlying cinnamon which I find to be ubiquitous among Belgian “quad” styles, or ones that are double “dubbels.” As I began to drink and finish this beer I noticed it went beyond the style and I ended up appreciating it much more as a stout. It’s so complex, rich, and exactly what I love about beer; the ability to surprise and then win your heart. This beer was so utterly refreshing to try something that went beyond the style to produce a robust, strong, and unique beer.","slammgrass","0"

Have heard that this needs a bit of age, but Poured into my De Struise glass. Has a large billowy head which recedes to a quarter centimeter film on the top of the beer. Aroma is very strong. Very heavy with dark fruits and currants, with a little bit of light perhaps cidery aroma. Theres a ton going on on the palate. Dark dried cherry, currants, and prune come to mind with a bit of dry coco. Alcohol is a bit more overbearing than I would have hoped. Could definitely afford to mellow for a few years. Have an 08 that I can't wait to open after this. Mouthfeel is medium with lively carb. Smooth mouthfeel. I really like this beer and would love to get more and age it for a while and see where it goes.","Agold","Nov 14, 2011"

Taste has more dark fruits, light chocolate notes, dark and rich malt flavours, caramel and a hint of roastiness. Unbelievably smooth mouthfeel, great creaminess to this.

It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but quite honestly, if I wanted a Russian Imperial Stout, there are much better options that are far more reasonably priced. My local distributor had this priced significantly higher than Rochefort 10 (which is what I consider to be the archetype for quads). If you are searching for a decent quad, I would recommend steering clear of this. If you're open to trying a high-priced Russian Imperial Stout, this may suit your fancy.","mikedotnet","Oct 29, 2011"

Nice mouthfeel, not thick at all like most quads, but not thin. Perfect. The taste is amazingly complex but not overwhelming. Roasty, caramel, butterscotch, coffee maybe, and spices. Raisins, and dark fruit. White chocolate and maybe light banana? Vanilla and oak. The light hop comes in just in time to prevent cloyness and dry out to make it refreshing. This beer is better than I could have imagined. Truly world class and elegant. I feel like I never have to try another quad because nothing can be this amazing. I feel like it's kind of stoutish as well. Worth every penny. They could charge $15 for this and I would pay it.","redleaves","Oct 20, 2011"

It also would benefit from some tincture of time, and the next time I buy one, I’ll look for an aged vintage one.

The flavor is made up of freshly baked raisin bread, dark fruits, light cocoa, moderate doughy yeast, and alcohol. It drinks very heavy and is certainly full bodied.

His obsession of crashing High School Reunions started simple enough, play the role of the muted Magic the Gathering player, the forgotten 4th chair trombone, lay low. It worked like clockwork, the open bar started flowing, old enemies regailing each other with carrer conquest exploits, soon Jacob, soon. His latent abilities went far beyond the scope of the pedestrian masses that he regailed. At the strike of each gala, 3 hours in, he would emerge as the forgotten socialite besting the former nerds in volairean wit, intimidating the portly former jocks with a panache and bravado that oozed confidence. It was this latent power that fed him at night, the knowledge that his unknown ability was his greatest asset.

It pours with about a thumb of head that slowly reduces to a light layer of foam at the top. Smells of yeast, clove, chocolate malt, and sweet spice. The nose itself is rather fragrant and lends to the taste. Taste is sweet with chocolate malt, candied sugar, hint of orange peel. Actually thought it was rather sweet on the whole, more than I expected. Near the end of the drink the orange peel flavor becomes a bit stronger and a hint of lemon appears. Mouthfeel has light carbonation and becomes rather creamy after a few seconds in the mouth. Overall a nice beer but rather sweet for my taste and that sweetness makes it a bit less drinkable than it would otherwise be.","jeonseh","May 04, 2011"

Taste: At first very sweet then moves to a little tart with tastes of plum, cherry, grapes. Spices follow and a hint of chocolate.

The taste holds notes of yeasty breadiness, brown sugar, cranberries, ginger, spruce, light pine, and a dash of bourbon. Damn, this is some tasty shit!

Believe it or not, I smell Red Bull, liquorice, plum, honey roast, and Coca Cola syrup. Whoa, is there some carbonation in there! The taste is very remiscent of the nose. More of the dark fruit comes through. Plum, nectarine, great hop bite on the mid-palate, some raison bread, and a melange of dried dark fruit. Not boozy at all. I love this finish. It lingers on without being cloyingly sweet and sticky. I really would like some yeasty artisinal bread, fruit marmalades, and some mild cheese to pair with this beer.

Tastes of red grapes, toasty malts, spicy on the midpalate. Sweet toasty bready malt finish with a drying vinous character. Full bodied, nicely thick, moderately high carbonation levels. It seems like it should be thicker and maltier, maybe a bit less carbonation would be preferred. This is a pretty tasty beer, though not as tasty as some of the more readily available brews.

4.77,9.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Reviewed from my tasting notes. Served in a snifter at the Lion's Pride. The beer is colored a very dark shade of brown; it is too dark too see anything through it except for a faint glow caused by a bright light. There was a small head of tiny tan bubbles It quickly settled to skim of foam. There was a little bit of lacing left by the settling, but a great amount of lacing occurred as I began to drink the beer. The Old Fisherman's Ale smells nothing like an old fisherman. It is mainly sweet, with plenty of spices. I think I can detect aromas of clove and date, but identifying smells is one of my weak points, so I can't do this aroma justice. I find it be very pleasant and a perfect compliment to the amazing flavor this beer possesses. I taste plums and dates. It is a bit sweet, but not as sweet as other Quads and high alcohol brews. In fact, there is just a hint of alcohol, mostly in the finish. You can feel and taste it evaporating after you swallow. For a spiced beer, this is taste perfection. The body is of medium consistency, while the level of carbonation is on the lighter side. There is some mouth coating, but it is very slight. It is not syrupy or sticky; as I described above, it feels like it is just a thin layer of alcohol the pleasantly disappears. This is especially impressive, considering the strength and style of this beer. This quality mouthfeel lends itself to making Pannepot incredibly drinkable. The spices never get overwhelming. If you order a glass of this, or pop open a bottle, you could sip it slowly for a long time, or just as easily, you could order round after round. The alcohol never impedes the drinkablity (the Old Fisherman's Ale is dangerous that way). I would drink this beer all the time, if it wasn't so rare (and expensive). It's an exceptional product that I can easily call my favorite Quad.","ToasterChef","Beers"

The pour results in dark dense garnet reddish-brown fluid topped by abundant tan mousse head which slowly subsides transforming itself into solid lacy cloth. Each swirl weaves a fabric of attractive lacy coatings on the walls. Nose is pampered by aromas of red wine, over ripened dark sweet cherries, prunes, rum soaked raisins, cocoa and soft spicy alcohol. Flavor profile is leaned towards the sweet side: chocolaty sweet malty body embraces fruity flavors of over ripened dark sweet cherries and prunes, even grapes, sparingly powdered with pepper. The fruity tartness is followed by gentle bread-crust like bitterness to balance the malt. The beer is somewhat vinous but never really such. Although the margins are perfectly smoothened individual components act as a symphonic orchestra of harmonious flavors. Excellent, milk chocolate coated dark fruits in a bottle. The thick and full bodied beer leaving sweet sticky coatings on the lips is on the edge of being syrupy but never crosses the line. Initially prickly with transition to velvety smoothness the beer rests pillowy soft on the palate. Apart from somewhat overdone sweetness nothing prevails and nothing is subdued. A puzzling beer: Although commonly classified as BSDA or Quad, it is verging on imperial stout. Great stuff.","crnipeter","Jan 31, 2010"

Taste is an amazing blend of the above mentioned ingredients. Starts out with a touch of sweetness before it dives head first into dark fruit and toffee. Finnishes with a wonderfull fresh, crusty bread taste and no lingering sticky or sweet flavors.

It poured with a dark syrupy richness, and reminded me of the glorious Rochefort 10 in appearance. I was really looking forward to tasting it,especially since it was a two year old (2007) vintage, but found the experience completely dissapointing. There was nothing enjoyable about it to me, with just a sweet taste followed by a disgusting bitter aftertaste ( I suppose this is the 'Thyme' some people have detected in the brew). It is meant to be a fishermans ale, but if I was a fisherman, and this was the only beer in the tavern, I would probably stay out at sea all year and drink rainwater.

This beer only reinforced my already high regard for De Struise Brouwers. It pours a deep dark brown, essentially opaque with a rocky two finger head. The nose on this is quite a treat in itself. On the sweeter side, raisin bread, hints of spice, fruity yeast characters, hints of coco and Belgian candy sugar, and most interestingly a bit of a funky cheese rind aroma, quite clearly. Badass. Not to be mistaken as sour, but it definitely has that bit of earthy funk to it. Flavors are lush and full on this one. Rich maltyness and big almost over the top quad characteristics of spiced plums, rum, spicy notes and light musty hops, and an almost a stout-like chocolaty flavor to it. This might be labeled as an ""extreme"" quad by some. Definitely pushes the boundaries, yet this is still a very traditional Belgian quad at heart. Rich and velvety on the palate, remains extremely drinkable despite the robust sweet flavors and high ABV. Worth noting that I had several from '07 and a couple from '06. Both great. I think I prefer the fresher, dryer, and slightly more carbonated '07 to the richer, more lush and boozy '06, yet there were some amazing deep flavors developing there. Definitely drink one relatively fresh, and I'm sure this could age for quite some time. Highly supple and enjoyable.","twelvsies","May 20, 2009"

The mouthfeel is assertive carbonation against a velvet soft background. This just keeps getting better. Drinkability is fantastic.

Cookie and mild chocolate sweetness balanced by an almost funky tartness and some alcohol. Almost dry and woody in the back end. Medium to full body with an almost over-carbonated airiness. Once you let it sit a bit and get some of the bubbles out, its quite smooth, but packs some pressure for sure. This one caught me a bit off guard. I wasn""t expecting the acidity, but it gave an elegant balance that actually worked really well, though I think it overshadowed the spicy subtleties that many others seem to get out of this, which was fine for the most part because I could drink a few more of these with this balance.","bulletrain76","May 04, 2009"

After settling in the glass, the beer is a deep opal with an utterly tenacious, sticky head of espresso-like foam. The aroma is a Belgian yeast-attack, with spice: cloves and phenols, some coriander(?), another warm spicy note I can't quite name, and a big-time yeast presence. On the palate things really come together. First off there's a nice chocolate malt undertone, laid under big, dark fruits. The sweetness continues with some sharp spicy notes and then a brisk twang from both carbonation and bittering hops. Holding it all together is a powerful-but-subtle sweetness and a mouthfeel that's smoother than glycerin on glass. Wow. This is what a quad ought to taste like. Mouthfeel is superb -- the aforementioned smoothness and carbonation play perfectly together. Pannepot pulls off the Belgian trick of being sweet then finishing dry. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. The only thing that clunks for me -- and this is purely in relative terms -- is the aroma, which is good but not great, while the rest is awesome. Find this.

The taste is a very nice melange of all of the above. The spices are in the allspice or cinnamon family. The heavy fruits I would peg as in the plum family. There is lots of yeasty bits floating about and if this beer were lighter colored, it would be very cloudy from the residuals.

Taste is a mixture of phenolic cherry, allspice, raisins with malty carmel overtones rounded out by slight chocolate taste. The alcohol is very well hidden for 10% but you still get a little warmth in the stomach. Mouthfeel is medium body with a nice semi syrup texture and a velvet like carbonation level.

At first I thought it smelled like old, concentrated cotton candy. Then my friend pointed out that she thought it had a fragrance like banana Laffy Taffy (which it certainly does). There is just a load of things going on with this nose. Flavor is spice forward. Very sugary sweet like brown sugar and a slight biting alcohol presence. After a swallow and it settles on my tongue I get a heavy coffee aftertaste. The feel has a coffee flair to it as well. Like old coffee that was brewed with five times too many grinds.

We left it in the sun all day yesterday, put it in a brown paper bag this morning, pried the cap off with a cigarette lighter and passed the bottle back and forth while riding BART down to San Leandro.. Just kidding. Cracked @ 55F on the morning of 12/25/2007. No glass recommendation on the label, so I used a small wine glass. Opaque pour with small, thin head. You have to pour this one aggressively if you want big head retention, but that's not really necessary. A fountain of complexity. First few sips give dried fruit, raisins, prunes, and especially plum. Next few sips chocolate starts to appear in the finish. Get even deeper in and you can start tasting the noble hops in the middle of your palate (Hallertau MF/Mt. Hood?). Big body but not too dry, not too sweet. Very smooth finish, the alcohol is not hot or harsh in any way, it contributes significantly to the mouthfeel. This beer is awesome. Many compare this to Westvletern 12, someday I will do a side by side to decide for myself. Try some and I don't think you'll be disappointed.","nahthan","Dec 20, 2007"

It's incredibly well balanced between malts, spices, sugary sweetness, and hops. One may taste bits of caramel and raisons, light-roasted coffee, anise, and, perhaps, black pepper.

But this goes away as the beer warms and other flavors become more prominent. Get a nice cherry chocolate feeling in this beer. Overall this is a sweet beer. The spicing is nice, with hints of nutmeg and ginger. Black licorice in the background. Almond and pistachio accents are light. Really like the complexity of this beer. Silky smooth feel to it.

I still have one more bottle of the 2006 vintage and I am going to get myself the Reserva version of this as well as a 2004 vintage and let's see how they fare; for now, Westvleteren still rules.

4.69,8.1,3.5,4.5,5,4,5,"11.2 oz bottle. This one pops with a massive hiss. Upon pouring, my glass is filled with a tower of light and airy dark tan head that sits a good 3 fingers over a sparse it of matte black liquid. The billowing head falls quickly to a finger over top of the brew. There is a strong carbonation boiling out of the brew, so I am expecting this one to lack that bubble when I take a drink. I would like the head to have been a little less prominent. The aroma is awesome. There is a massive molasses sweetness with some spicy licorice spice that gives me the impression of star anise. The combination of these two aromas makes me think of molasses cookies. I'm still waiting for the head to fall back down after my second pour brought the foam back up to 2 fingers over the brew. My first sip delivers a massive flavor. Tons of very deep dark fleshy fig marianted in molasses with anise. There is a prevalent dark candied-sugar sweetness that finds the sides of my tongue as I swallow the brew, and it clings well there into the finish, rounding the spicyness of the licorice and molasses flavors. Everything here blends so well together, the boldness of the flavor does not come across as cloying or over-spiced at all. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick with a light carbination remaining even after the explosive head on the pour. This one is sublime. It deliveers over all aspects of the brew. The only hint of the ABV is found on a light warming in my stomach and a good relaxation that is settling in. This one should be a sipper, but the flavors keep taunting me to come back and drink it more quickly.","kmpitz2","Oct 02, 2007"

The flavor is similar to the aroma with big dark fruit character upfront (fig, plum, grape), along with some spiciness and tobacco like earthiness, as well as dark chocolate and a molasses sweetness that balances the spices.

Like figs and raisins. Bread and spices, and a bunch of other things dancing around in there that I can't identify. Maybe some caramel or something. It's sweet, but very well balanced. I'm not great at identifying individual tastes, especially in some of these Belgians, but there is something in here that reminds me of the Adam from Hair of the Dog. Maybe smoke? A particular spice? Well crafted beer. The alcohol comes through strongly, yet very smooth. Its presence is needed, so as to keep some of the other characters from going overboard, but it doesn't get in the way at all.

4.72,8.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"2006. Gushing. But it pushes forth a phenomenal aroma of incredible unique character. Theres a flow of steady north african spices, exotic asian fruits and nips of candied pipe tobacco smoke. A totally unique aroma, like nothing Ive breathed before. Musky, yeasty, spicy rich and bold, with creamy black tea notes, faint black cardamom and rich swirls of smoked malt breadiness. Phenomenal. The perfect intensity, allowing all nuances of the aroma to expressive individually, before melding into a one perfumy bliss. Heat nor yeast nor hops dominate aroma. Pours an intimidating deep dark near black mahogany, with a sticky head of tea and milk foam. In the corner a cut of garnet, glowing strongly. On the tongue, a whole new array of flavors and complexity. This is ridiculous. First I grab a real bright passionfruit bubblegum yeast soap, which is actually this beers weakest point, but then it yields to a growing warmth in calvados and pear brandies. The residual sweetness slides into a terrific wallop of deep caramels and emaciated raisins, with a toothy bread climbing out of a pot of honey. Intense chewiness with a real backbone. Beer slides off the tongue gracefully, kissing the roof of the mouth with a refined hazlenut and almond bite. A wisp of danish pipe tobacco curls up through the humors. Spices provide a nice base and accentuate the yeast and malt characters. Hopping appears briefly as a sweet lemon rind note in the smack. There are some fantastic sweet fresh maple syrup notes and freshly cut tobacco wood touches that briefly alight out the backdoor. Somehow a little harsh to my nostils and tongue, and the sticky malt notes grow slightly cloying. But to experience such astounding new flavors and nuances, this beer is fantastic. I love the airy quality of quaffablity that comes from the yeast attenuation. Expertly crafted and above all others. The best part is that I keep finding new things in the beers as my palate adapts, now a growing sense of ground fresh ginger root and gentle alder smoke. One of the most intricate beers.","CharlesDarwin","Mar 08, 2007"
4.31,-0.7,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"11.2 oz. bottle, 10% ABV, 2006 edition, Lot C7AA. Deep dark brown in color, almost black. There was a great deal of carbonation, as the cap practically exploded off the top. Huge thick tan creamy head. Very nice looking indeed. Head retention was great, and nice rings of lace were left on the glass. Earthy, spicy and yeasty notes, along with rum, chocolate, figs, dark fruits, and dark bread. Wow! What a nose. Very complex. Very sweet up front, like candy sugar. Chocolate flavor, black licorice, some lingering chocolate covered fruit flavors. Earthy bitterness balances the sweetness just right. Soft carbonation, seems almost frothy. A bit of warming from alcohol. Wow, there is a lot going on here. Very complex, and tasty. Great beer.","Bierguy5","Feb 28, 2007"
4.97,14.5,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, yet the alcohol cleans things up. Amazingly well done. Carbonation is mild and a contributing factor to the whole experience. I feel so insufficient. This beer was way more than the words in my vocabulary can describe. If you see if, buy it.","mentor","Feb 26, 2007"

4.88,12.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Bottle (vintage 2005): Poured opaque dark brown ale with a super huge foamy dirty brown head with perfect retention. Aroma of liquorice and sweet malt is incredibly well balance. Taste is an almost perfect balance between strong sweet malt with caramel and liquorice with some candi sugar (I would say a bit too much though) with a slightly funky ending from the yeast. Body is full and alcohol is very well masked. This beer is almost like a sweeter version of Rochefort 10 and there is not much more praise I can give to this beer.","Phyl21ca","Feb 17, 2007"

4.33,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Smooth mouthfeel, carbonation keeps a good head for the duration of the glass. Sweetness doesn't linger on the palate much, but it could hinder the drinkability if you don't like a slightly sweet dark Belgian. A sl-o-o-w sipper.","emerge077","Jan 12, 2007"
4.65,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"D: Unmatched drinkability! The alcohol is very well hidden even though your cheeks and ears will feel scorched by the time you finish this.

4.33,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a great head that holds retention well with a beautiful dark amber color and a good lacing. The smell is very nice with the famous Belgian dry quality that has a great freshness. Straight from Denmark so it's great. The taste is very good, it has a slight sweetness to it that's coupled with some very complex flavors. The mouthfeel was very smooth and nice on the palate. Overall this was a great Belgian, probably because it was someone's trade.","Erdinger2003","Beers"
4.72,8.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Very expensive; but well worth trying, at least once. Incredible stuff! This is bottle-conditioned and would be a real treat to Cellar for a year or two. One to challenge the Brothers efforts up the road in Woesten-Vleteren for sure.","TheLongBeachBum","0"
