4.25,4.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured a dark brown in color with burgundy highlights and a half finger of head that left some good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. Plenty of dark fruit is noticeable upfront in the nose with nice belgian yeast sweetness, slight candi sugar, booze is present and hints of brown sugar. The belgian yeast character was more apparent on the palate alongside dark fruit accents, welll balanced booze that was not overwhelming, subtlt brown and candi sugar but with mild spice. The brew was medium in body with good amount of carbonation which has a sweet, yeasty, dark fruity, slightly boozy and sticky finish. Finally got to tick this beer after some years of chasing.

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, and spices. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Shared this one at aasher’s wedding reception with as many people in the wedding party as I could find! Served from growler into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a ruby red-brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, and banana. The flavor was of sweet mat, fruit, banana, bread, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. As far as quadruples go, this was a fairly solid one. All the proper flavors and aromas going on in all the right intensities. There was absolutely no sign of the alcohol in this one at all. This was definitely a scary aspect as I’m sure the right person could crush a 64 oz growler without a problem. I’m just glad I had help that all seemed to enjoy it as well. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance to do so.","thagr81us","Jun 15, 2012"

Not quite as much as I'd normally like to see from a quad, but given the fact that this is a quad from a growler, I'll give it a break there. The nose contains a good amount of dark fruits--mostly raisins and prunes--along with some caramel notes and some toasted bread. The flavor hits along the same lines, focusing on the dark fruits and mild bread character, and then finishes with a bit of dry bitterness. Pretty good, but not the sort of complexity I expect from a quad and, especially, from Russian River. Feel is medium with lower levels of carbonation and a dry finish, which I quite enjoyed. Definitely drinkable for the style--it blew me away when I found out this was 10.5%, though I suppose I should have suspected something in that range.","Thorpe429","Mar 07, 2011"

4.45,9.9,4,4,5,4.5,4,"A great solid mouthfeel that makes this drinkable at 10.5%. It has no noticeable alcohol notes in it other than a strong buzz in my head after drinking three glasses.

3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Draught at the brewery. Dark amber-brown with an off-white head. Rich caramel and nutty aromas. Malty flavor with caramel, nuts, an some spices that remind me of nutmeg. Starts with sweet maltiness, but actually ends dry and pretty bitter, though the hop aren't as apparent as many of their lighter ales. Medium-full body is nice and trim considering that this is eleven percent. Malty, yet with good balance and interesting flavors.","bulletrain76","Aug 23, 2009"

Taste is similar, light chocolate and dark fruit, raisin, lightly sour, cherries, big alcohol, sherry, wood, more fruit, some candi sweetness, a touch astringent in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some heat going down. Carbonation is a bit low for the style, and alcohol is in your face, but pretty cool stuff.","Viggo","Aug 17, 2009"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Good, but a bit of a disappointment. Russian River makes a quad seems like some kind of dream beer description to me. Unfortunately, I found this beer good but disappointing as a quad and as a Russian River beer. It's still quite good, of course. Mortification pours a deep garnet with little head and a bit lacing. The aroma is fairly mild with some bananas, some plums, some spice and a whiff of sour cherries. The sour comes through a touch in the flavor, but it's almost as though the brewery saw a bit of cross-pollination from the sour barrels rather than they were really going for a lightly sour quad. It's fairly dry, especially for a quad. It actually reminds me of a dry barleywine mixed with a tripel, for some reason. The flavors don't punch as much as I would like, but then again, the dryness is a nice contrast to more normal pitfall of a cloyingly sweet quad. Another nice upside to the beer is that it hides the abv almost entirely. I'm pretty shocked to see it listed here as 11% abv. This was my second time tasting this beer and I'm still confused by it.","popery","Apr 21, 2009"
