"This poured  a dark brown with plenty of sediment or yeast to obscure what would have been a much better color. In all that snow globe mess were some hues that would have liked to be seen.  Thin head of off white foam that did not last but refreshed on each swirl.  Nose is a touch of booze and dark sweet bread.  Fruity, raisin, prune, a bit of sugar and molasses.  taste is darn sweet with candi sugar and brown sugar.  Lots of dark fruits in there.  Body is heavy and mouthfeel is full and chewy in places.  The carbonation was not as good as it should be so this drank thickly and flatly.  The finish was cloying and not dry but thankfully not hot either.  Brunt sugar, raisins and prune finish this one pretty syrupy."

"O - Very rich and full quad, paired nicely with a shoulder roast braised in black IPA. I think this bottle would have been better if given a few more months, but I couldn't wait, it paired too well with the dinner at hand."
"DATE REVIEWED: June 17, 2014... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... OCCASION: year in public education #15--done!...APPEARANCE: intimidating dark black body that sports a thin white head that settles quickly--a white on black spectacle... AROMA: toffee and peat malt dominate the nostrils; fruity yeasts--peach, pear, apple--provide a floral balance... PALATE: active, warm, full-bodied--worth sipping of 10% ABV; like a strong ale in texture, but a bit buttery too... TASTE: complex fruit--plum, black currants, and banana--with clove cigarettes and milk stout properties--a demanding,, playful experience... OVERALLL: the kitchen sink seems thrown in here, with a serious backbone that rewards the drinker with hear and flavor--a big beer that could be brought out for big occasions...."

"Overall - An excellent Quad and one of the best i've had... recommended..."

"O: overall I thought about rating this beer lower but after contemplating on the style, it's not bad, a well-aged quad"
"O: This one was fairly cheap, at only $8.99. If you're looking for some cheap social lubricant, go ahead. However, I'll pass on this in the future."

"o: Too sweet and pretty far off-style."

"Pours from the 25.4oz bottle a cola-ish brown with a 2 finger head. I cant see much in the way of carbonation in the darkness. Aroma is surprisingly faint ( or is it my allergies?) but I catch a hint of bread & dark fruit. 1st sip is of dark cherries, plums, and a hint of caramel. It's quite sweet & malty even after 2 months of aging. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but there is not as much carbonation as one would expect. Overall, this is a pretty solid quadrupel, a quite suitable offering on National Beer Day!"

"It came down to this or Incubus, Chose Ichor strictly based on the style of the beer. I enjoy Quad's quite a bit so I wanted to give this one a shot. The beer poured out as a traditional brown color with a cream colored head on top. The retention wasn't too bad here but there wasn't any lacing at all. The smell of the beer was bready and fruity, there were also some aromas of caramel in there too. The taste of the beer has a sweet start to it that gives off flavors that coinside with the nose of the beer. The finishing flavors remind me of bubblegum. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and gives the beer is a decent dry finish. Overall it's not a terrible Quad and I'm thankful for that. It is probably one of the better Slyfox beers on the market."

"This was an average Quad, the syrupy texture was too unpleasant to make this enjoyable."
""
""
"O: A good after dinner beer that is like sugar glazed cherries, prunes and raisins. It borders on being cloying, which I not my favorite but it's a solid beer with nice belgian character."
" Overall a very nice beer I dig it and would by it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"TASTE: Ohh, the taste is pungent! Tangy! A surge of sugar. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Decadent and almost too sweet. The faintest/briefest alcohol hit towards the end, but otherwise finishes well. I think I enjoyed the aroma more than the flavor."
"D: OK drinkability. An interesting take on a quad, but the result is not stellar."
""
""
"This beer has a raw sweetness that is seems to cry for more shelf time. It seems to lack the melding or layering of flavors of a complex Quad. I will save my other bottle for December because this beer just reminds me of Christmas time."
"O) I don't work quads into my beer rotation nearly as frequently as several other styles, but I do know which quads I've enjoyed immensely. This does not fall into that category. That said, it is pretty good, and is worth a try."
""
"Overall a good beer, lacks a few characteristics for the style, definitely worth trying."
"Overall – The beer has some really nice attributes, such as nice strong fruit and malt flavors and aromas, but the weaker body and the stronger alcohol presence keep it from being really good. Not bad, but not really great either."
""
"Drinkability: This is definitely a slow sipper, but it’s reasonably drinkable for the style."

"I don't associate Slyfox with Belgian styles....but this was good!"

"O - Nice beer to slowly sip. Opens up more as you let it warm up."
"Overall, I was quite pleased with the overall flavor and thought that it really developed quite well."
"O: Not a great quad, but you can't beat the price!"
"Poured a clear, dark cola brown, with patches of white bubbles for a head. Aroma of caramel and alcohol, with a whiff of dark dried fruits. Tastes, well, like a quad, but not quite as complex as some made by the more experienced brewers. Still good though. Caramel and toffee in the taste, alcohol, candi sugar, raisins and figs, and a touch of banana. Finishes a little stale with dry alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, but one serving is enough I thought."
"Fuller bodied than expected with some bready yeast, zesty spice and sweet dark fruit. Very sweet with faint licorice and booze. Hints of pepper, plum, raisin, fig, grapes and dark cherry. A bit too sweet but the ABV is excellently masked. Absolutely no heat making this beer pretty drinkable. Good but a bit one dimensional."
"Pours a very dark brown, some dark burgundy shades in there. Not truly opaque, but comes close enough. Bright white head. Nose has some heavy, dark vinous notes, a general dryness about it too. Vinous and candied. Taste has some alcohol right off the bat, dark fruits, sweet and warming with some brown sugar and candied notes again. Full bodied but quite sweet, almost cloyingly so. Nice overall, but the sweetness could be toned down a bit."
"D - Nice beer. High ABV and sweet nature not so sessionable."
"750 from Wegmans, Williamsport, PA"
"This is a very enjoyable brew. It is different in the flavor department then most of the other quad's I have had. Very sweet and smooth. Very good but not as big and well flavored as I would want, could be too sweet for some. But you could session this brew, which says alot for a quad. Very good stuff."
"RESPECT"
"Not for nothing, but the cork in this bottle was incredibly hard to remove, even with a wine opener!"
"D - my wife and I killed the bottle in 20 minutes and still felt like we savored every drop. we had one when the case was first purchase and busted this one out of the cellar to celebrate pizza night. so much better after sitting around!!"
"It is very drinkable for such a massive beer. I've had it on tap as well and that presents an even more aromatic and deeper experience. Top of the line of USA Belgian Quad styles - up there with St. Bernardus and a slightly less complex Westvleteren."
"Summary: This is good stuff, love it."
"Overall, the common theme I noticed is that the basic flavors and aromas are there, but just not complex enough to put this beer on the next level. The sweetness in this beer is unchecked and too one dimensional...not too mention the ridiculously thin mouthfeel. With some changes this beer has potential."
"D - This was my first Quad and I must say it was pretty tasty...you usually can't go wrong with Sly Fox"
"D: I couldn't drink more than one bottle of it, but still a decent sipping beer. Not my cup of tea, due to heavy sweetness and the assault of flavors after the swallow, but still good."
"Big bodied, yet smooth and definitely easy to sip on. No doubt that it is a big beer but the alcohol is subdued in its presence. A great sipper on a cold Sunday afternoon."
"Overall, this was a solid Quad. I prefer my quads to be more on the dry side, and this was way beyond sweet. But good nonetheless."
"Very good Quad, nice representation of the style. Sly Fox, I'd like to know you better."
"D: Good drinkability and worth checking out but falls short when compared to Belgian quads."
"Very big beer that just keeps giving back. This beer is moderately exciting. Drink it with a friend."
"Drank it today and I must say I enjoyed every drop I was quite impressed by this brew. Dead on Style wise for a Quad, I would have thought it was a Belgian. Great job Sly Fox keep it up. I would by it again for sure"
"HV"
"D: Pure bliss with every quaff of this gem. There may be bourbon accents or just that the high abv level really takes off half way through as it warms and the scents grow."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a very fruity yeast aroma along with a solid crystal and roasted malt scent. The alcohol does sneak through as well. The taste is good. It has a very drinkable crystal malt flavor as well as a fruity yeast finish. It's warming in the swallow, but it's not too powerful. This is a tastey beer. The yeast really brings the flavor together. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a silky smooth drinker. It's a slow drink, but an enjoyable one."
"Overall, it's a decent stab at the style - certainly has characteristics showing that it is (trying to be) a quad. It doesn't miss the mark completely, and has enough to it to keep on with the sipping, but it seems to lose some character as it warms/progresses. Sippable, despite heat, nevertheless."
"This beer had a brown pour with a one finger tan head. It smelled of caramel, nuts, fruits, and roasted malts. The taste was was great. I could really pull out all the flavors that I mentioned above. The mouthfeel was thin and it left a fresh after feel in my mouth. Not bad for a strong beer."
"Tastes of sweet malts (toffee), nice mixture of fruits (wine like) and booze."
"The caveat with this richly complex brew is that the keg seems to have gone flat, so the beer might not show nearly as well as possible. I liked it enough that I will certainly give it another try if I come across it on tap or in the bottle, when I get the chance. The sample I had was delivered to me with no head at all. A very dark beer with maroon and purple highlights when held to the light. Good Belgian quad aromas of root beer, cola, cherries and spice waft from the glass. Carbonation not absent when drinking, but certainly subdued, and at least a bit more would have elevated what is a rich, heavy style. The bright spiciness and winey cherry fruit kept the beer surprisingly drinakble, however. A wonderfully complex interplay of rich flavors. I hope to try a better sample someday."
"I reviewed a bottle of this earlier and was quite disappointed, but after enjoying a hand-pulled pint of this at Zeno's in State College, PA, I'm thinking I got a mishandled bottle. This beer has all the characteristics I listed before for the nose, but appearance, taste, mouthfeel and just the overall drinking experience were far superior to my last encounter. I love the rich complexity. The high alcohol is well hidden by its fruity and malty sweetness, and as big as this beer is it is surprisingly easy-drinking. If I hadn't known better I'd have had a couple of these and not been able to drive home safely. A wonderful beer and I really enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mellow, laid back carbonation. It could be a little more carbonated but I can't really complain. An easy drinking American brewed Quad that's well worth seeking out. A yummy treat from Sly Fox."
"Pours a deep amber to almost black color with a small white head. In the aroma, reminds me of asiago cheese, hints of caramel and a touch of alcohol. In the taste, plum-ish and really quite like a LaTrappe Quad. A smooth big bodied mouthfeel and a dry, Belgiany sugary palum in the aftertaste. Great representaion of style, very La Trappe like. Sweet and dry in all the right places."
"Really didn't like this in the least. So little carbonation I thought it was a bad cork, until I read some other reviews. Looked great in terms of color, but no nose to speak of. Weyerbacher's Quad is superior across the board to my mind, including price in my neck of the woods. Thinking back on the Odyssey, perhaps the brewery's philosophy is different than mine."
"Quads are my favorite, from my experience this isnt a good representation of the Style. The carbonation factor really killed the score for me. It does taste good, and the smell is definitely the best quality of this beer."
"German Pils and Roast malts and Belgian Candi Sugar, German Tradition hops. The alcohol was present. Very much like an American take on the quad, still very good."
"D - A bruiser it packs a wallop w/ concealed intensity. Half of the 750ml is a meal in itself. I love it, but a glass is filling a full of flavor, Prost!"
"Drinkability: Like drinking liquid caramel; where's the quality control?"
"I had this side by side with a fresh growler from 2007 and a bottled version from last year. I rated this version almost identically to the fresh version. Next to each other they looked the same. Nose wise and flavor wise, this has matured a bit and would be appealing to those who appreciate a more dense aroma and flavor as opposed to the fresh, more estery version."
"Cheers!"
"I must have gotten a bad bottle of this; it was way off and not up to par with other Sly Fox beers. I will review it with hopes to try it again. The body was deep ruby with no head and very little carbonation. I got a strong whiff of wet cardboard with muted alcohol and pepper. There was a cherry flavor with a little pepper, the taste was way off. The wet cardboard smell really did this beer in; I couldn't taste much because of the smell. The low carbonation gave a really syrupy body. I am assuming I got a bad bottle."
"Sensational brew. Im not going to say this is on par with Westvleteren or Rochefort, but this is definately one of the better American examples Ive tried. A little confused by it low score, perhaps its a newer, more improved batch. Yum, this is a great beer. The mouthfeel could definately be a bit creamier and more heavy and I wish the finish was a little more lasting, BUT this is still a great brew, worth seeking out."
"D: I wrote this beer off after an earlier tasting but clearly that was premature. This is a strong quad, full of malty strength and a very nice product. Thank God for second chances!"
"Caged and corked Belgian bomber. $7.50 from New Beer in NYC. No vintage/bottling info. Opened with no pop, hmm, poured with little head being generated, low carbonation noted. Darkest of brown shades, no head, no lacing. Nose is strongly of raisiny bourbon. Strong, heady brew, notes of more raisins, cola, vanilla,brandy, dark grains and ripe fruits, on the sweet side, could use some more thickness on the palate. Fine brew that could use some more complexity and depth to earn world class scores. I'd like to try this one with a year or two in the bottle. Still well worth a try. Nice cold weather night caper."
"I think that if there was some head to this, it would be an amazing beer, but I'd reccommend it regardless."
"Drinkability/Overall: Another completely solid beer from Sly Fox. Ridiculously drinkable for a quad of 10%. Not a mind-blower, but well-made on most fronts and hart to fault in too many places."
"Wish I could say I liked this one but not really. Nothing off about the bottle it just tastes too much like grape soda for my tastes."
"Very impressed with this bottle conditioned beauty from the folks at Sly Fox."
"750 ml bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Still, and slightly viscous with a sweet syrupy quality to it. Apples and tropical fruit mingle with a heady alcohol sensation that warms as it trickles down the throat.	 Definitely a sipping beer, this would make a nice aperifit, as it shares some characteristics with a botrysized wine."
"Drinkability: very tasty beer, but the alcohol tends to overwhelm after a while. One glass is enough in a session."
"Drinkability & Notes  Nothing makes this one hard to drink, its relatively balanced and the alcohol is in check, but the flavor just isn't what it could be. Its a solid beer, but in a category that has so many breathtaking beers, this one is lackluster."
"Poured a ruby-burgundy color with minimal carbonation and only the slightest bit of head. Aromas of plums, raisins, alcohol, and maple seemed to come out nicely. The taste was sweet with fruity undertones, as might be expected for the style. Very subtle hops in the finish, but not as smooth as might be desired with the flavor profile. Overly dry and yet crisp; the beer didn't seem to flow very well from initial sip to the finish; very disjointed. The sweetness was more like that of a doppelbock with fruit flavors taking a back seat to the malt sweetness. A good beer, one worth trying, but not a great example of the style due to several flaws."
"Drinkability: Smooth, rich, fruity, and a joy to sip. Something so strong is so smooth is amazing."
"-Oelergud"
"the thick, heavy, fruity sweetness is exactly what I'd hoped for from this quad, and even a bit more. It's blended very craftily, and even slyly, if I may, each piece meshing well with the others. The ABV is never shy, and it gives fair and due warning. Wisdon says heed it. If you're looking for crisp and refreshing, look elsewhere. But if you want a hearty, rewarding quadruppel, look no further...you've found it here."
"I have another one, so I can revisit this one after some more 'bottle conditioning' and review it again."
"Brian's quad. Awesome. Deep, dark, malty, carmel, every big beer lovers dream. The head holds on, the mouthfeel exceptional and the complexity and balance are truly remakrable. This stuff is not for light hearted the ABV is well over 10. As it warms the characteristics become more refined and this is a truly remarkable and memorable brew."
"Smooth and delightful in the mouth...as it warms there the flavors come out. Plums, spices and a rich malt character make this one a winner."
"This beer is really something different,whats up with the sticky bottle cap?Pours a deep chesnut brown with some ruby hues with no head to speak of.The aroma is of Xmas fruit cake and some alcohol notes.The taste starts out very sweet with some dried fruit thrown in there,its a sweet beer but not overdone.Iam sure I couldnt drink more than this bottle but still a very good,well made beer."
"This beer poured a combination of mahogany and chestnut colors that had scarlet tones on the edges when held to the light. It produced a light beige colored head that quickly faded into a simple ring on the outside edges, and left behind no lace. The aroma was intoxicating but not over-powering, aromas of deep dark malts and sweet malts, caramel, dark fruits (black cherry, plum, raisin), soft wood tones, a slight roasted grain and the warmth of alcohol all filled my nose and mouth. The flavors were just as intoxicating, seductive and more pronounced. My tongue tasted rich malts (roasted, sweet), dark fruits (plums, raisins, black cherries), caramel, a warming alcohol, candied sugar, slight bread grains and a hint of spice. The taste that stayed on my tongue - were of the sweet candied sugar, and the warmth of the alcohol. The body of this beer can only described as thick and spoony (at the warmer temperature at which it was served). Very rich and creamy all through the taste, from the first sip to the last. A very complex beer that should be sipped, savored and respected to the very end. The bottle label was correct."
"This is an excellent beer. Fruity, whisky, malty and delicious. It also is high on the alcohol content and you can taste it throughout. A great ale for a nightcap or with chocolate, it warms the tongue and throat. Sip this and let it warm to enjoy the full range of flavors. An excellent Belgian Quad that doesn't overpower the senses too much."
"Flavorful, complex and very interesting. Some of this beer was spilled and in 2 minutes my fingers felt as sticky as a movie theater floor. Beautiful dark ruby red color  with a short lived small head. This is a definite sipping beer for me, unless youre insane and decide to gulp it down. The hops in this beer were pretty subdued and taken over by all heavy malt sweetness and sugars. A nice treat that I would even consider warming up on a cold rainy night, rather than drinking it chilled."
"A big ""Thank You"" to rotsaruch for the bottle!"
"Pours a dark burgundy, almost a satin mahogany color. Distinct degree of carbonation is noticable with a generous foam of bubbles which forms this delicate tan head that quickly fades. As it warms and I swirl it gently, there is this hint of a sweet, fruity bouquet. As the aroma becomes more noticable, I finally need to accomplish the task at hand and give the poor palate a chance to participate in this splended sensory situation. WOW!! The old tastebuds were blessed with this banquet of dark delicious dates (filled with cream cheese), plums, and red rasberries. I poured some more of this charming concoction and tasted. This effervescence display of bubbles which are released would dance and dart within the tasting chamber providing another unexpected sensation to enjoy. There is this wonderful warming effect with this slight, but noticable, brown sugar-like finish. The finish is dry and sweet, but not overpowering. What a lovely treat on such a miserable, cold winter night."
"Ichor means ""Blood of the Gods", and its appearance is quite appropriate! The body appears almost black at first, but reveals a deep ruby with a mahogany cast when held to the light. Carefully poured it's quite clear, leaving the yeast sediment almost completely behind (it's bottle conditioned). The creamy, one-fingered head is light-tan in color, holds quite well, and leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is rich with fruitiness (the skins of dark fruits melded with fresh berries) and a soft yeasty spiciness. The body is firmly medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that's lightly zesty on the tongue before warming to display a supple creaminess. The flavor is astoundingly rich with mouth coating sweet malt & caramelized sugars wrapped in dark fruit (plum/prune, grape/raisin, fig) and spice. Intense! There's an underlying layer of leafy/floral hop flavor and balancing bitterness. The alcohol is exceptionally well-cloaked and only reveals itself slowly throughout the goblet; but mainly in the finish where it helps to dry, and accentuates the spiciness of the yeast. It's exceptionally well-balanced and the malt and spice linger just long enough to be completely satisfying but not cloying. Very well done and well worth seeking out. This is clearly a beer that will improve with age for some time; drying a bit, softening it's already subtle alcohol, and possibly increasing it's complexity. It may hold for close to a decade as any sherryish notes that arise will only add to its deep, dark, fruitiness."
