"Good, solid beer with a very strong aromatic scent. Great complex layers to flavor"
""
""
""
"It's my favorite drink. The hue of it hummed. The body is not too sweet, chewy but subtly dry. Wonderful phenols from the yeast... I miss this drink"
""

"Great beer overall.  Maybe SLIGHTLY past it's prime, I slightly wish I had it this summer because it has a lot of refreshing qualities, but it's a good quad.  I like it a lot.  Thanks Geoff for the recommendation and trade, a solid brew that I'm really glad to say if've tried."

"O:  This beer is one smooth sipper with great flavors that blend and play well together.  It stood up well even though this one has a best before date instead of a best after date."
""

"Overall (4.0), an interesting take on a quad. At this point in time, I don't really get a lot of the quintessential dark fruits that you expect from a Belgian quad, but this one steps a little outside the box with the use of pomegranate molasses and being partially aged in wine and rye barrels. It's hard to compare with Not The Stoic, given the time lapse, but this one has held up quite nicely, especially for being over two years past the enjoy by date."
""
""
"O: A bit of a disappointment, but it's still a pretty good beer. I would recommend this, but it doesn't really taste like you would think it would, based on the description (barrel aged quad)."

"Amazing. Belgian yeast (actually a pretty light touch) along with some strong sweetness from the malt. Sweet like a good barleywine would be, a sweetness that seems totally natural in this context. Most beers that are in the style don't choose to go so sweet, but for this beer it really, really works. Absolutely my new favorite."

"Lost review in browser, oh well. Cellared upon release, this was my first one. Not a quad by my book at all, but as BSPA, I really thought it was good. I liked the play of the fruit with the robust yet clean alcohol character. The barrel play was modest, but suited the malt bill. Not what I was expected, but solid Belgian style ale. I'm curious how my other bottle will age, but I probably won't want it to loose all the fruit, and therefore don't have high expectations for longer term. I'll check back in within 2-3 years."

"The beer pours a hazy/speckled dark amber with a creamy off-white head that laces. The nose has huge notes of plumb, tart cherries, cherry blossoms, and malt. The taste presents the same bold stone fruits upfront with a blast of warm, booze soaked grains in the finish. The body is a bit lighter than other quads comparatively, but well carbonated, fruity, bready, and has masked booze in the finish. The aftertaste is bitter/rindy and a bit off putting, but certainly doesn't ruin the beer. Considering the price/availability and all additional components of this review, I'd say this quad is worthy of a try, but not more impressive than a 3 philosophers (for instance)."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, copper/golden color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, hint of grape, slight raspberry, alcohol, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Quadrupel. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, yeast, grapes, hint of citrus, sweet malt, and a hint of spice. Overall, alcohol is not over-powering, which I enjoy. The body at first, reminded me of a blend of Lindeman's Framboise and Kwak. Weak appearance and complexity, but good aroma, body, and blend."

"O - Interesting take on the Belgian quad, but ultimately disappointing for what I was expecting. Good, but not great. For such a hard-to-find beer, you'd expect it to be a little more representative of the style."

"D - It won't satisfy your craving if you're looking for a typical quad, but it's one hell of a beer. Insanely drinkable at 11%. I'll be having it again."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely odd for a Quad. Nothing really remarkable about it, except the odd flavors. Definitely disappointing for one of Deschutes's reserve beers."
""

"Outside impressions of this beer had me worried, a year after acquiring this one it's time to crack it open. This is a quad with almost no Belgian flair to it, if uncategorized it's a complex beer mixing lightly toasted and sweet malt, oak and lightly sour fruit aspects. Rather than Stoic and rigid, this beer dances over the confines of the definition ""quad"" and delivers a delightful sensory experience."
"Overall: A very nice ""quad"". Definitely has plenty of Belgian quad qualities, but it is significantly different from any quad I have had. The pomegranate definitely adds some interesting qualities and gives it some interesting funk. A lovely beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think I would have enjoyed it slightly better in it's prime, but a very good Belgian. One of the best I've had from a large American brewery. Easy to tell that it was done with a vast amount of precision and care. I hope this isn't just a one time release so I can see what they do with it again. The nose matches and compliments the taste very well, and it overall has a nice amount of complexity to it that doesn't stray too far in any direction."
""

"This poured out as a light brown color with a nice looking white head on top. The retention is pretty good as well as the lacing. The smell of the beer gives off some quad like aromas, there is some fruity and bready aromas. The barrel aging aromas are prominent. The taste of the beer has a slight tartness to it. The flavors of dark fruits come out with some oak elements in there also. The mouthfeel had a solid amount to carbonation, the body is a little on the thin side. Overall it's a decent quad. The color is a little on the light side and is need a little more body."
""
""
"Deep orange colour, ring of white head, some lace as well. Smell is quite oaky, fruity and vinous, quite a bit of funk and a bit of musty brett presumably from the wine barrels, some candy apple present as well. Taste is yeasty and fruity, apple followed by oak and some funk, brett, more fruit toward the finish and maybe a hint of whisky however it does get buried by tons of fruit and funky oak here. Light-medium carbonation, medium feel. This was quite a nice and certainly interesting brew, not a quad in my books but certainly a pleasure to have had."
""
"good beer, but not your father’s quad. Rather mid yellow with big lasting head, lace. Sweet, and some tartness from the pomegranate. Overall I get more berry than pomegranate.Complex, sweet dominates but it is not cloying. Smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability. Thanks Presario."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an odd Quad. The wine barrels are still noticeable. But I can't find any whiskey except for what is questionably a whisky burn way beyond the after taste of my palette."
"O - I'm loving this quad. Much more than the belgians I've had."
"Pours a hazy golden with a little bit of an orange tint. A white head that quickly recedes. Aroma offers some belgian yeast giving off some fruity esters.,big banana,some apple and then there's the pomegranate giving off some nice tartness, the barrels, and some alcohol. Flavor is really quite interesting. You get the typcial belgian quad flavors with the yeast and its fruity esters (largely banana) but you also get the pomegranate which cuts the sweetness and offers some tartness to this thing, and then some discrete woodiness. Some alcohol in the finish but not too bad, given the earlier reviews here time must have tamed it some. A fuller mouthfeel, some creaminess not much activity. Overall, I liked this one a lot more upon my first few sips than I did on my last few sips. I shared this bottle with someone else and glad I did because I couldn't have drank more than the 12 oz's I got. I guess I'd consider an alright brew in small portions, but the fact that it got a little cloying for me the more of it I drank was definitely a let down. Interesting beer, yes, good beer? Not as much so."
"An interesting Quad, definitely more fruity than most so if fruit in a beer is a turnoff to you, you might want to avoid this one."
""
"O: A great beer and an exceptional quad. Highly recommend to (and drinkable by) all. Will have again."
"I don't really think this is a quad, but I don't know what kind of label it deserves. It's boozy and fruity, but in a good way. I'm not sure how to rate this, but I guess I will be nice. At the very least, this is very interesting."
"I can't view this as a quad. It's a loose use of the term and as such I treated the beer as some imagined Belgian-American strong ale."

"Pours a medium amber color with a huge bubbly white ehad that slowly dissipates leaving much lace. Smells of tart fruit, spicy oak tannins, orange peel, yeasty funk and a bit of grape skins. It doesn't look or smell like what I expected. The flavor is moderately sweet with some light sugar, a bit of apples, some non descript tart fruit, a hint of caramel, some wine like tannins, grape skins, and a fair shot of ethanol. There's a hint of vanilla and oak in the flavor but they are very subtle. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is an OK beer, but I didn't love it that's for sure. I think the pomegranate adds a fruity tartness that makes it feel a bit like a sour bottle; the wine barrel adds to this as well. I was expecting a dark caramel and raisin beer with maybe some hints of barrel and tart fruit. What I tasted was a tart fruity Belgian with hints of caramel and pomme fruits."
""
""
""
"Unbelievable. I'm not sure if this beer it that remarkable or if its my love of quads coming through after not having had one in awhile. The look, the smell, the flavors, the texture, it has it all. I have to say it is a 5.0."
"This looks...unusual for a quad. Smells nice though. The beer in its entirety is...uninspiring. It was nice to drink, but not interesting enough to distract me to go write down some notes about it as I worked on other things. Slightly boozy with a bit of a burn. The pomegranate provides an interesting touch, but only a one dimensional one. If this is a quad, okay, I can roll with that...I guess. Overall though, it's not very interesting. A brewery like Deschutes has earned my respect by producing a lot of interesting beers that I really enjoy. However. This is not one of them. A miss, in my book."
"Really didn't like this one as much as the folks at the bar had me anticipating. It's really, really strong. The complex flavor helps hide it a little, but between the tartness and the banana & yeasty in-your-face flavor, I couldn't even put the whole thing down. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I know I've had better. Maybe I expect Deschutes to knock it out of the park every time and I feel slightly disappointed."
""
""
""
"Notes: Nice brew, no flaws really, but the barrel felt short of the delicate notes it promised, and similarly the same went for the addition of fruit."
""
"Overall - I would certainly recommend trying this beer, although I think I expected too much out of it. Given the price tag and the past brewery performance, I was expecting something phenomenal, but it was just a decent quad. Certainly not Three Philosophers, I'll tell you that. Worth a try though."
"The flavor is complex, the pomegranate has a nice platform as the fruity note with nice Belgian yeast and a healthy brown sugar and toffee like sweetness. A nice dryness and also a healthy depth of flavor at the same time. Vanilla. It's complex but at the same time it doesn't seem to have the direction and sofistication of the big Belgian quads, but it's still nice, but a touch muddled."
""
"Taste has mellowed since it was released a bit and the flavors have come together a little bit better. I like the bready aspect the malt gives off despite the light color. The flavors are still a bit odd together though and I think the ABV is unnecessarily high at 11%. The pomegranate seems to clash a bit with the soft yeast and propagates an alcoholic feel. If you want something different, this is your beer. I am not a huge fan it though, especially for a Deschutes specialty brew."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of flavors and the barrel aging adds to the beer nicely. Not really a Quad, but still very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer that I think just has too much going on if you're seeking a run-of-the-mill Belgian style quad. If you know what to expect, though, you'll keep coming back for more."
""
""
"Overall I didn't like it. It really isn't very representative of the style in my opinion, and where it diverges from the norm it does so in ways that I personally find unpleasant. I seriously considered tossing it out after the first sip, which is something I never do. To be fair, it did grow on me a bit over the course of the bottle, which may have something to do with the high alcohol content; it doesn't taste nearly as strong as it actually is. To each his own I suppose, but I won't be buying it again."
""
""
""
"Drink it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A super solid quad with a barrel aged twist. I would buy this again & age it just to see how that rolls"
""
""
""
""
"M: it's not full, more medium."
"Overall the beer is rather enjoyable. It just does not mesh with what my idea of a quad is very well. It is pale, there are no toffee, caramel, dark fruit, or other typical quad flavors present. The beer states on the label that it was made with pomegranates, they do not come through at all. However, this is still a great beer and I would highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very unique and very tasty quad. The additions made by Deschutes by aging the beer in barrels and adding pomegranate really stand out and make this a beer unlike any other I have had. There is only a hint of alcohol in this 11% beer. I will look forward to this each year."
"A major failure from a consistantly solid brewery. Do everything in your power to stay far, far away from this train wreck in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a unique beer. Not a quad in my book. No clue as to what this really is, style-wise. But, I kind of like it. Somewhat drinkable."
"O: Enjoyed this more when stirring up the yeast sediment for the second pour; it added a good funk/slight sour and more spiciness. Glad I let this sit outside of the fridge a while as it gets better as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a decent and interesting beer, but not one that really stands out. The sweet, sugary, fruitiness and spice dominated a little too much and seemed to overshadow some of the flavors I was looking forward to unfortunately."
"O - Complex and flavourful, incredibly (and dangerously) drinkable at 11%, and all around world class. Certainly a fruitier take on the style, so if you're not into the sweetness you might not find it as enjoyable. I on the other hand wish all quad's had this sweetness to them. Delicious!"
"the stoic is one heck of an interesting beer. pours murky light amber color with a slight pink tint and an effervescent white head. looks much lighter than most quads ive had, coming in almost honey colored rather than that deep caramel color im accustomed to in these. it smells tart and sour, yeasty, and lots of fresh fruit. the flavor is much more tempered by the wood aging, and the rye flavors come through very nicely and compliment the tartness of the pomegranates. never really tasted anything quite like this, its oaky, almost sour, and even flowery in the yeast. feel is very excited carbonation and a lighter to medium body. alcohol flavor and feel is entirely absent. amazing. this would be quite drinkable except for the abv strength. overall another exceptional beer from deschutes. theyve got to be one of the finest operations in the country."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Similar to a lightly spiced holiday dessert wine, The Stoic exudes significant complexity. Within it's extensive production process, this classic style undergoes a wonderful transformation into an elegant sipping beer with a broad depth of unique flavors to satisfy even the most discerning palate."
"I have had this beer before but it still surprised me how light it pours, gold, with just a touch of orange and a very small white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is very sweet, lots of complex fruity belgian yeast esters, lots of berries, overripe strawberries, blueberries, slightly acidic smelling but not in a sour way. Some definite light caramel maltiness in the background and a touch of oaky tannins. The taste is nice, similar to the aroma but slightly more muted, not as bright. Very light bitterness, just enough to balance the high notes of the flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, very smooth, especially for 11%. Overall a friend shared a bottle of this a while back and I decided to pick up a bottle for myself, not quite as good as the top level Belgian quads but a very decent American attempt at the style."
""
""
""

"Sweet and boozy... Vinous and raw... More bourbon burn than I was expecting and not as much flavor as I was hoping... A rare miss from this brewery for me... I like Deschutes a lot and everything I've ever had from them has been amazing but this doesn't do it for me. I finished but... it was work."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a goblet, best by 8/04/12. This pours a slightly hazy golden color with a short lived white head. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, banana, brown sugar, other malts. The feel is medium a little tingly. The taste is disappointing, a little yeast, some sugar, some bitterness."
"UPDATE- Read some other reviews and something is off. Seems that some people got the cloudy with and without the yeast - mine was clear with nothing remaining in the bottle at all???"
"Overall, this is a decent Belgian Golden Strong but definitely not a quad to my palate. There is a lot that went into this beer but the sum is less than the parts. Too estery and phenolic with not enough pomegranate or rye barrel; probably could have used more time in the barrel and/or more fruit additions. I will have trouble finishing the second glass because this is just not flavorful/enjoyable for my tastes."
"4.2"
"Very nice beer and I drank it all in about 15 minutes. I was celebrating :)"
"O: For 14 dollars I much would have rather bought a St. Bernardus 12, but its hard to compare to that. This is a very good beer from a great brewery. This isnt your typical quad and I respect Deschutes for stepping out of line with that."
"This warmed up quite a bit as I drank the bottle and it was as good at room temperature as chilled."
"O. Overall this beer definitely misses the mark as a Quad. All in all though it is still a pretty tasty Belgian beer. Has a lot of the flavor components of a BSPA."
"O - a very unique quad in terms of flavour mixing, the addition of fruits and different barrel aging is a nice touch, a must try"
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden copper with a white head that attenuates quickly. This is not my style, but I was pleasantly surprised. The bouquet is characterized by raisin, green banana, and Fruity Pebbles. Flavors of sweet green banana and raisin that finishes with tart grape. This beer drinks like a Belgian without that usual undesirable yeast finish."
""
"There is a pleasant warmth that kicks in after a while, and that's very welcome indeed."
"O - By no means is this a traditional Quadrupel, but it still a tasty beer and worth a try."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber with a fine two finger white head with great retention. Aromatic aroma of Belgian spices, a bit of light fruit and light malt. Taste is light fruit, a hint of banana and cherry, pomegranite. Light bodied. A suggestion of the wine barrel aging, not very much oak presence. This seems less like a quadrupel and more like a Belgian strong pale ale. Nice looking and pleasant to drink, but maybe not quite for the premium series price. I am going to age one of these to see how time treats it. I has good potential."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really unique spicy quad, quite enjoyable. Spicy and fruity."
""
""
""
""
"Other comments: I'm going to have to stoically say, ""Meh."""
""
""
"O: Really reminds me of a Tripel or a Belgian Strong Pale. Decent, but nothing more."
"O: A Quad for those with their training wheels on. Light and fruity, it’s a strong offering from Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
"I actually think that a more palate coating maltiness would really help this beer immensely, there are a few too many sharp edges to this beer right now. I am sure some age will also smooth this out a bit too, so if you only have one bottle, definitely hold on to it for at least a year or two."
""
"B+ to A-"
""
"Deschutes did a collaboration with my fav brewery, Boulevard, and they are just now moving into Missouri. Welcome! I am glad you are here."
"Overall: While not a superior quad, I find it very pleasant to drink. I had no trouble with one bottle but that would suffice for a while. As with many Deschuttes products, this too, is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very easy-drinking Quad considering the 11%."
""
"I wasn't terribly impressed with this from the bottle, but on tap, I absolutely loved it."
""
"This beer has a great subtle flavor with nothing overpowering. There is a gentle warming that accents the flavor creating a pleasant drinking experience. The mouthfeel is quite well done as well as it is full-bodied with out the syrupy heaviness. This is a good beer to experience with others, particularly wine lovers."
""
""
"Innocuous and easy enough to put away, but not very successful as a quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Enjoyable, I liked the ""red wine"" aftertaste. Maybe the 16.5 percent aged in oak wine barrels made a difference. I would like to age one of these to see how the flavors ""smooth"" out."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 8/4/12. Had a really nice light straw appearance. Lots of carbonation. I had a bit of sediment in my glass. I didn't see to much on the polls about that so I don't know if it was this batch or what. Smell is huge of fruit and yeast. Light lager smell mixed with tons of fruit; apricot, apples, grapes. Taste tickles bc of the carbonation. Easy drinker for the huge abv. Much lighter than what I thought it would be, much dif than most of the quads that I've had. But in general this is not my favorite style. Overall this is a huge fruit bomb with tons of drink ability. Nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, this ain't yo mamma's quad. i understand the negative reviews since this is so different and in a way, almost comes across as a barrel wood chip aged fruit/vegetable beer. in a blind taste test, i would guess that this was from short's (no knock on short's, but they tend to make unclassifiable brews in my opinion...and they get beaten up for it a bit). the flavoring and smell are quite complex and enjoyable...but if you are expecting a quad, this is not your beer. i have to admit that i am a bit bummed that this came from one of my all-time favorite breweries as their first real attempt at a quad. i am pleased that i have another one of these to open at a later time though since i did find this interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good quadruple, one of the few in the style that I've actually enjoyed"
"Overall: this beer does not really pique my interest. I suppose I can see what the brewers were going for, but in my mind this is not a terribly successful beer. It's interesting enough, and not bad to drink, but I feel like they went the wrong way with the funky flavor profile."
""
""
"Overall - Very smooth and very drinkable given the ABV. What this beer doesn't have however is any sort of 'wow factor'. For the price I'd pick up something else next time."
""
""
"22oz. wax dipped bottle served in a tulip. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a finger of off white head. Belgian yeast spice in the aroma along with some fruit (the pomegranate) and sugar. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. More spice in the flavor, some alcohol heat in the finish. Not getting much barrel. Plenty of malt, but not overly sweet. Big beer, seemed like there was more going on in the aroma than the flavor."
"O- a very unique beer, I've never been a big quad guy but I like this one a little more than usual. More fruit flavor than just plum like flavor."
"O: Overall, I really enjoy this beer. Unique characteristics with a refreshing taste. Would buy it again. Actually, I did. I already had it but didn't review it. So yes, I would buy iti again."
"This is a nice fruit beer quad fusion, I would say its more on the fruity side than the Belgian quad though."
"O- Not my favorite style, but seriously awesome parts to this beer. Deschutes treats me right yet again."
""
""
""
"It's an interesting take on 'quad', if by definition of fermentation rather than adherence to dominant style, and I like it. Quite a bit. Not my new favorite Belgian-style, but it's hitting the mark this evening."
"O: one of the best Belgian styles I've had. Most of the complexity is in the nose. It's not so big that people wouldn't like it though (V12 and Allagash Curieux seem much stronger at similar abv). Definitely try this beer."
""
"Tasty beer, but I was really looking forward to more barrel aging character, especially from the wine barrels. Other than that the beer is thinner in body and color than most other quads, as well as lacking the serious carbonation properly due for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a decent quad, though a bit thick and sweet like most American quads. Still, far from bad."
""
"Opinion: I don't really know what to make of this beer to be honest. It isn't a bad beer by any means as it has a lot of complexity in the fruit department and the 11%ABV is very well hidden as it doesn't add heat or much spice for that matter. I really like malty beers, and sometimes the sweet ones are nice, but this one is a bit much even for me. I will gladly finish this bottle, but I am not sure that I would be prepared to drink this beer again. Since it is so big and well balanced, perhaps it would be a good one to let age for 3-4 years and try it again. I imagine that it would be quite different on the palate by then."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall; quite balanced, abv is certainly hidden, the notes are interesting and unique...it's just not a quad."
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer but definitely not like the Belgian Quads previously experienced."
""
""
"Overall: not even close to a Quad. Gotta have rich malt body, spice from the belgian yeast, and dark fruits to be a quad. This beer has none of these flavors. It was okay, but reminded be more of a complex white wine."
"On tap at 1702 Speedway. Pours a bright clean golden amber with one finger of yellow. Nose is rich and heavy with Belgian esters. Lots of raw fruit and peach with spice and volatile alcoholic heat. Some plum with a light vinous character. Rich flavor with notes of prune and overripe fruit. Very estery with a light whiskey character. Medium body with a soft carbonation and warming finish. Overall a decent beer."
""
"Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, with a nice fizzy off-white head, which leaves some nice oil slicks and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some pepper/licorice notes, slightly fruity. The taste is slightly sweet, a nice yeast note, some pepper/licorice notes, and some fruitiness. Medium Body, ABV hidden very well. This is a different kind of Quad to me, more of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but still pretty tasty, worth a try."
""
""
"Overall: Not really a quad; to my palate, it is more like a BSPA; a lot went into this beer but the sum is less than the parts"

"Overall- Good beer. I am not the biggest Belgian beer fan, but this is good. I would have to agree with those that have said it is not a true Quad. I tend to like quads. Not enough dark fruit flavors for that. 3.5/5"
"I think this is one of the better Quads I've had. A nice alcohol burn with the great woody nose and long spicy flavors. ""Best by"" date is 08/04/12. Expensive, is the only problem."
""
"The Stoic was a rather pleasant beer. It is not the quad we are all use to, I for one can appreciate the change of pace. Enjoyable beer, easy to drink. Worth a look."
""
"O- This isnt a bad beer but is certainly not wowing. I will finish this beer but I will not seek more of this beer out."
"Thanks to Jerz for this"
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is certainly smooth, drinkable, and hides its strength well. But the flavor is a bit one-dimensional with a large emphasis on the bubble gum."
"M - Medium to full body with a hearty chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burnt gold color with a white head of solid-looking foam that quickly disperses into floating islands of foam. The nose is big and complex, with very strong alcohol and yeast that does not quite overpower the subtleties of grapes, coriander, lavender and pepper. This beer is delicious! Maybe I should drink more belgians, but this one was quite good. Simple and extremely flavorful. Sweet and light, like a medium white wine. Lemon and coriander are subtle tones that bow down before an entrance of oak and earthiness. The finish could have been a little more crisp, but that is my only main complaint."
"O: While so many things are mentioned on the label, I can taste just hints of each. Pomegrenate? Sure, guess I can taste it a bit... Oak rye barrels? This I thought I would taste for sure, but the flavors are so diminished they are barely even there. The strongest flavors that I pick up from the label were the wine barrel treatment. For the most part though I get that white grape concentrate flavor that a few other beers have been using, namely 10.10.10 from Stone and the Pinot Lambicus from the Bruery; neither of which I liked. Mediocre beer for the price"

"O - I'll do the overall assuming I wasn't told this was a quad, because they should have never put that on the bottle. I think this is a Belgian Strong Ale. If you look at it that way, it's got some spice, some warmth from the barrel, and some sweetness from the wine and fruit. Could have used some more flavor as they seemed to throw alot into here and didn't get the full flavor out of any of them really. Not the best, but not the worst."
""
"Not nearly as revered as The Abyss, but The Stoic is still something to crave."
""
"It warmed up beautifully, and the pomegranate flavor is more prominent than I would have expected. The alcohol is well-disguised, but it's mostly disguised by the sweetness, which is a bit cloying if you let it linger. All told, I really like this beer a lot and would look forward to getting another bottle. Hopefully I can dig one."

"I haven't had too many quads, with Pannepot being my favorite experience of this style, and although this is unlike that brew I rather enjoyed it's unique style and quirky characteristics. Also, very big."
""
"D: it was definitely a supper and was pretty rich in flavor as well. I thinks it's a great dessert beer."
"Final thought - every reserve deschutes makes is worth a try. 11% and $12 a pop. Get this one and crack her open!"

"O- its tasty first off..not a quad IMO..it has tastes of a golden,a triple and a saison, i liked it for that but this is not a quad"
"Overall: Good beer, but does not fit the profile of a traditional quadrupel. I knew what it was prior to my review, having had it on tap, but people who are expecting a traditional quad will be put off by this. My scores are a compromise, I like this beer and will pick it up again, but label it as a Belgian Strong Pale ale or something more fitting and my scores would be higher. Still I like this one."
"I shared a bottle with my cousin, the pour was caramel in color with a small white head, light lacing. The pomegranite really comes through on the aroma. The pomegranite and general sweet fruit notes are the primary flavors, some dark fruit notes. The beer is full bodied, average carbonation, the alcohol is well hidden. Not a typical quad, maybe more of a high octane fruit beer. I was disapointed that I could not pick up the other BA aspects of the brew, but everyone in the room who tried the beer enjoyed it."
"Overall: Got to respect the Stoic! The alcohol is just a bit too hot in this young one. A year or two of aging would settle this one out, just right and make it a bit better."
"Another instance of group-think? I believe so. Quad? Who gives a flying bird? It's light, tasty, breezy, well-integrated, & so-easy to drink. A beautiful fall sipper. I will go get another. Or two. Excellent beer."
"Full bodied with no lack of carbonation. Has a very sweet aftertaste. A decent beer, but I don't plan to seek this out again."
"Overall-Usually whatever the beer gets for the taste will generally be for the most part my overall grade. However, it's tastes very good, and I could drink alot of this. Only thing is it's the same beer style as alot of heavy hitters I've had, ABT12, Roch10, exc.. Yea I know it's not exactly a ""quad"" but nonetheless, whatever style you want to call it, it's a tasty beer. At 14 bucks a pop though would I buy it again? maybe so...but I'd probably not."
"Interesting, and certainly enjoyable. I think Deschutes has done much better, but nothing wrong with this. Worth a try."
"Overall not bad, just didn't deserve to be a limited release."
"First off, for a Belgian style quad this looks nothing like what I’d expect it to be. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. But it’s so… light! Not the burgundy amber I’d expect, but not the clear straw-golden color of, say, a triple. Somewhere inbetween. Apparently aged in wine barrels, and that definitely comes through on the dry finish. An experiment, hybrid, curious beer that’s no where near the monstrosity I was led to believe it would be."
"O-Am I disappointed? A little when compared to the other Deschutes Reserve beers. This one was unique. I have another bottle to age and we'll see what happens in a year. Although I'm not sure how much room there is for an increase."
"O: Complex flavours in a package with too much of an alcohol taste."
"O: Like I said, there is too much going on here. I appreciate the effort and ingenuity put into this beer, but it doesn't quite come off. I won't pay 12 dollars for it again, but I wouldn't turn it down from a friend."
"o - Overall an interesting, enjoyable beer. Not what I normall think of in a Quad as it was fruiter and had a lot of berries to it, but I liked it. Would give it another shot."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The overall feel of this brew comes up a little short/thin. Very spicy with a huge presence of Belgian yeast that gets exaggerated by a harshness of something that smells/tastes like raw oak. The pomegranate had enough to be noticed which was an interesting change of pace. However, for a quad this one fell short. I think something as simple as calling this a Belgian strong pale ale instead of a quad would have increased my scores across the board. As a quad, this was a bit of a dissapointment but as-is it is worth a try. This would have been much better received on my end if the raw oak character was replaced with more of a used barrel presence."
"Overall: a very slow sipping but big flavored beer. The flavors really grow as this one warms. Very enjoyable on tap."
"Overall this really is an excellent beer, easily in my top 10."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with quite a bit of fine, abundant carbonation. Pretty smooth going down. Overall, I didn't mind this beer so much. If Deschutes had called it a barrel aged saison, or BSPA, the score would have gone up exponentially. A rare miss for this brewery."
"overall, pretty disappointed.when i heard deschutes, a very well respected brewery in my eyes, was making a barrel aged quad with pomegrante, i was thinking delicious. but i was disappointed. the untrained eye could fool this for a really strong basic saison. i would avoid this."
"D: Love the idea, the label, and the name...other than that not so good. Doesn't do the style justice."
"O: Really disappointed in this. I don't really understand where they went wrong, but it should be back to the drawing board for this one."
"Not to familiar with quads but it is decent, just not my favorite style of beer."
"Overall, It's good but I feel like something is missing, It's lacing something I cant quite put my finger on, I like it but I dont know why but I dont really want it..."
"O: In a display of how disappointing this was, I didn't even commit my usual Dexter-like ritual of slicing the wax open and stealing it as a souvenir. A swing and a miss for Deschutes."
"Poured clear and light brown with an off white 2 finger head head into a 40cl goblet. Good lacing throughout to the end but poor head retention. Bottle indacated that it would be good for 15 months from purchase but date so this would have been a good beer to age. Aroma is very sweet with hints of dark fruit and sugar. Mouthfeel was a little thin for a quad but very pleasant with just a hint of hops and tons of full belgian malts. Good balance between sweet and malt with a dose of hops. Not as full bodied as many other quads but definitely worth the money. I will go back and get some to age."
"Palate: Sweet, vinous, fruity. Cloying but also slightly tart. Dark fruit and red wine, clove, bready malt. Becomes more tannic and dry in the finish. Pretty mediocre and not particularly drinkable, I dumped my glass after a few ounces. Deschutes isn't doing so well with these reserve series beers this year."
"Drink- This again was a bit scary for me. Although besides the small head and lack of deep color of normal quad colors and some small aromatics. Everthing worked well for me. Big, layered and a tad sweet from the quad flavors."
"Overall, it's pretty good, definitely not a flop from deschates at all."
"A decent beer, but doesn't completely fit the style. The barrel aging is hardly noticeable and the price is not warranted for this beer. It is enjoyable, but doesn't live up to the hype."
"not a stellar beer, but glad i tried. could be interesting to lay down for a year or two."
"A decent take on the style. Didn't blow me away, but enjoyable all the same."
"Overall, I felt this kind of missed the mark for a Quad, and would better be represent by the Tripel style. The percentage that was aged in bourbon barrels did not give off the faintest scent or taste of bourbon. A rare miss for Deschutes."
"O: Glad to try it, but I'm not going to pop the money for this again. Might be good with some age."
"O: A real miss from Deschutes. A rare one as well. Very disappointing."
"O: There's almost too much going on in this beer. Nothing wrong. May be interesting to cellar for a bit and see what happens."
"Overall: A solid beer, but 4 ounces was sufficient."
"Pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch puffy white head that settles to a thin cap. Thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, banana, caramel, and malt. Taste is of dark fruits and banana, malt, some caramel, yeast, alcohol, and a tart flavor. I am not really getting any pomegranate or barrel aged flavors in the smell or taste. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. There is an alcohol burn in the back of the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good beer from Deschutes but not as good as I was expecting based on their other barrel aged offerings."
"Overall this beer was a nice Belgium style quad with true wild yeast characters."
"D - Fantastic. Deschutes does it again. This brewery always delivers. It's hard to drink too much of it, but it is great. 12 oz bottles of this would be amazing."
"Overall this was really good. Not at all anything like what I would normally think of as a quad, but really, really solid."
"A unique beer from Deschutes. This is the first Belgian-style I've had from them, and I like their approach to blending. In the no-points category: Beautiful label!"
"Not a completely successful beer. Has some really good things going on but failed to excite me overall. Maybe Deschutes should take some pointers from their buddies at Boulevard on how to barrel-age Belgian styles."
"D - Despite the ABV, would not tire quickly."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy, but not sticky or oppressive. Overall, nice beer. Not a chugger. It's a sipper."
" Don't know what to call this beast except tasty, it will be interesting to update this one after a year or so in the cellar."
"Note: Deschutes should not have put a ""Best By"" date on the beer that is one year out. Really limits multiple bottle purchases and makes it seem as if the beer has no chance at developing further with age."
"kinda perturbed about the taste. doesnt really taste or feel like a quad in my mouth. more like a tripel. adequate taste just not what i would expect from a quad. maybe the wax-coated cap got my hopes up too high"
"I'm not quite sure why this is billed as a quad. Certainly that style isn't particularly well-defined (at least not historically), but this seems more like a Tripel in all respects. The sweetness, though, absolutely dominates the flavor over the yeast and other elements. Let's just say that I'm glad the price tag fell off this one, so that's one thing I don't remember."
"Pours an orange/peach color with minimal head (soft pour also). The aroma is crazy. Spice, bitter berry, yeast and some sweet fruit at the end. It is a bit stronger than I expected but was very good. There seems to be 2 sides to this one. The first sip was a bit spicy as far as it started with very little sweetness and the quad style really came thru with that strong belgian yeast. Then a quick second sip became oh so sweet. It was like the smoothest blended fruit juice then some light wood characteristics then a creamy bubblegum finish. The carbonation level is about perfect on this one, just enough to wake it up some each sip but not to where it over powers it. There is just a very small hint at the 11% but overall this is very drinkable. A bit sweet on the finish for me but glad I go to try this one."
"Pours an orangish, golden amber color with a large cream colored head that hangs around for a long time. Scent is a bit on the funky side...wasn't expecting that. I get a lot of white grape aroma with typical Belgian beer spices and Belgian yeast. Very fruity and spicy with nice funk. Flavor is initially spicy with hints of barnyard funk. Then you get a ton of white grape flavor with Belgian yeast. Then the rye and oak kick in, with definite vanilla and butterscotch flavors from the barrel. Quite a bit of booziness and burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a creamy feel. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I think this is a very nice and tasty beer. I was very skeptical due to the high amount of poor reviews and trash talk on this beer. I will admit, that this should in no way shape or form be labeled as a Quad. Not sure what I would call it, but I really enjoy it."
"I'm glad I read reviews of this beer before cracking it. It's definitely a BSGA and not a Quad. In fact, it's quite a good BSGA. Great apple and spice notes. Very drinkable and complex. Most everything you could want from a BSGA, in fact. Definitely comparable to La Fin Du Monde, if not better. However, since the beer notes a presence of pomegranate, wine barrels and rye barrels, you'd think those elements would have a larger presence. I kept wishing there would be more of a note from any of those. Some large sips gave off a vanilla hint that brought forth the rye. The final sips of the bottle gave me some interesting pomegranate notes. However, it just never came together. This beer was too subtle for my tastes and I wish I would have beaten me over the head a bit more with each of the added elements. Then it could have been a great beer instead of a merely very good beer. That disappointment makes me give it a lower score than it probably deserves."
"O: Quad? Maybe not. But what do I know. I liked this beer. It has a great flavor and I am definitely going to buy another bottle to cellar. Screw semantics, I enjoyed this whole bottle."
"I think I like this one very much. at $12/bottle not one I'd buy all the time, but for a special evening... just the thing."
"Overall - very drinkable with no complaints here. Not the best quad but not the worst."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tannish head. The aroma is full of nuts and toffee. I seem to remember the Hazelnut Brown Nectar from Rogue tasting similar to this beer, but it has been a long time since I have had it. The flavor is full of caramel and toffee malt with some cocoa and nuttyness. There is a cream flavor to the beer as well. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nice, but not worth the price."
"Really good beer. Great dessert beer after a good meal or with a good cigar. Lots of layers and very well balanced."
"Well, like many of the other reviewers, I wouldn't call this a ""quad", based on my experience with quads. It's not like Allagash Four, Westy 12, Rochefort 10, Pannepot, Abt 12, Koninghoeven and so on. But I'm not going to ding this exotic brew due to being mislabeled as a style that is a very contrived and hard to define style in the first place. This beer is very complex, nuanced, smooth, balanced, and tastes great. Hard to knock it, even though this is not at all what I had in mind when I responded to the Deschutes ""Advisory Board"" email asking what we thought they should make (I suggested a Quad, as wells as some others, such as a BDSA). I even said something like ""just go ahead and try and clone Koningshoeven."" Not quite, but really good. I like it. I wonder how you all would have reviewed this had it been called a Tripel?"
"Overall, A good to very good beer that, I don't know, doesn't fit the style *too* well but I've come across other ""Quads"" that resemble that remark. I'm curious about the best by label; I would think this would ""gain"" from some cellaring."
"This beer was kind of a mess for the style. For all the different barrel aging they did, plus the addition of pomegranate, you would have expected some more complexity. Instead you have a very average strong beer that is not worth the price tag. I wish now I would have bought just one bottle instead of two. I should have spent the money on a couple Rochefort 10s, a much better investment."
"The score at hand was rated to style."
"Pours a semi-hazed peach color with a bit of a white head and light lacing on the way down. The nose brings light honey and faint fruit. None of the barrel character really coming through. Medium body and light dryness in the finish with some sweetness. As it warms, the sweetness becomes more prominent. Not terribly complex, and not really getting much of the ""weird"" stuff they did to this one. This is just an average Belgian strong that didn't live up to what it was billed as. Oh well."
"O - decent brew but i feel like the effort put in doesn't justify the means...intersting but the characteristics are very subtle, i wish it had a stronger barrel influence. im sorry but is this a lightly barrel aged carbonated complex apple juice with invisible alcohol? yeah we already know to not expect a ""quad"" ....cold weather would be optimal for this one but optimal choices deviate away from this in general."
"O= A worthy beer. This doesn't resemble a quad very much so my rating may be a little low but this is a quality beer for sure. Nice flavor and profile just a little far from my idea of a quad."
"O - As far as beer goes this is really good. Not so much a Quad but a really interesting experimental brew that deserves more credit."
"Well, it’s not a quad, but overlooking the epic mislabel on Deschutes' part, this really isn’t a bad beer. On the contrary, it's an incredibly complex, tasty Belgian strong pale."
"O: I'm very disappointed with the beer as a whole. The yeast is too dominant to allow for the other flavors to shine appropriately. It, as is well known, does not flow with the typical Quad format, and is more like a tripel for me honestly. The yeast gives that chemical, clove on coriander tone. I will not be purchasing another bottle of this unless a trader of mine wants some."
"I'm really digging this beer. I noticed the subtleties over the course of the bomber and as it warmed up. This is a complex beer, but it isn't too complex. It's a beer that lets you know it's got some depth but doesn't flaunt it in your face, and I like that. I could go for another 22 ouncer, but the 11% ABV says I shouldn't. I had to remind myself of the ABV since it hides it so well with the noticeable but not over the top candy sugar. Excuse me while I go to my local liquor store to stock up."
"Overall i thought it was good and very unique. Sweetness and high abv limit the drinkability but otherwise it was very good. Can't wait to see what it tastes like with some aging."
"To end on a positive, I think it's very easy drinking for such a strong beer. Bring this to Thanksgiving and serve next to wine. I bet the family would find it an interesting counterpoint."
"O: I don't know what everyone is getting so flustered about. So what if this isn't a ""traditional"" Belgian Quad, it still tastes fantastic! I would classify it more as a Belgian Strong Pale, but that's just my thought on the matter. Forget the bad hype -- pick one up, it's delicious!"
"Definitely not a quad, and still a fairly uninspiring beer otherwise as well. Nothing what I would expect from Deschutes' Reserve Series."
"O: While this isn't very quad like it does smell a lot like the barrels it was in which is what most barrel aged beers turn out to be. That being said the flavor was a bit too sweet and the beer going flat halfway through the glass is a bit concerning."
"I like this beer a lot. There are a lot of great fruit flavors that I've found in other American Belgian Style beers, and the barrel aging adds a certain dryness that just makes me want to try another sip. There were a few bottles of this at the Whole foods near my work, I may have to snag a couple more after the good experience with this one."
"Overall, it's a bit of a mess. Way too cloying and alcoholic. I'll take a St Bernardus anytime over this."
"O - I hope to re-review this brew in a year or so and give it a better rating. Kind of a disappointment, but super glad I FINALLY got to try it after many months of anticipation."
"Malt makes a good match for the high alcohol. No hops, low bitterness, but fine, funky fruit flavor, and beautiful oak additions. I'm loving this. Stirring Depth and Complexity, indeed. I've made fast friends with this Stoic."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Overall, I like this, but it probably has to do with my love of pomegranates. I wouldn't really recommend this, because I feel like Deschutes is just trying to do too much."
"This seems to be a beer that is confused about what it wants to be. Doesn't taste bad but doesn't really taste like a Quad either. Reminds me of one of those weird beers DFH makes based on archeology. Worth a try I guess."
"Bottle. Poured into a NB tulip glass a medium copper color with a white head that quickly settles to collar around the glass. Closing my eyes the aroma is decenlty strong belgian yeast aromatics; clove, banana, fruity, etc, I wouldn’t say that pomegranate sticks out here. Malty, some biscuit, a light tartness, spice, herbal, all come out in the flavor. Again, not overly a pom taste. Bubblegum and some green apple. Rye whickey barrel? Really? What was the point as it doesn’t come out to me really. I’m not hating this for what it is but for what went into it, it’s not the best, it’s decent but that about it. Medium mouthfeel."
"A very good beer by most standards, but I expect more from Deschutes, especially for one of their reserve series. I have enjoyed several seasonal dubbel, trippel, and quadrupel offerings that were not in their reserve line which expressed a truer Belgian heart than this beer. I think it has potential, but I will not be purchasing this anytime soon. I'll spend my dollars on Jubel 2010, Abyss, and Black Butte XXIII."
"Let's move on."
"I told the dude that I didn't drink quads too often (just rarely in the mood) and he told me it wasn't a traditional quad (it isn't) so I grabbed one. I love Deschutes and am very glad to have been able to try their take on the style."
"I guess if I had to describe this, I would call this an easy drinking quad (at least at present)- but overall just a really good beer. While this isn't as complex as the other beers in their reserve series, I find myself still really enjoying this brew. I will definitely pick up a few bottles to age and see how it gets more complex."
"A nice enough beer, but probably not something I would seek out or want to have on too many occasions."
"O-Drinkability is awesome for a beer this big. I like what Deschutes has done with this. In fact, I liked it before the barrel aging. I do hope Deschutes will continue its innovative forays into the craft brew world after Larry Sidor's departure. Best wishes to Larry in his new endeavors. I believe there is room for more breweries to accompany craft brew icons like Deschutes, which Sidor helped make."
"o- this beer is very different in its self. i can see the argument on it not being a true belgian quad. but maybe thats why i like it so much? great complexity, very balance. blends a lot of different qualities of beer into one. very unique, i enjoy this beer a lot."
"Flavor: Definitely a quad, but not necessarily Belgian. It's like they traced a Belgian with tracing paper, but couldn't duplicate it free-hand. Still delicious, just not reflective of the true Belgian craft--respectable attempt though. Like a quad it evolves and volleys its play on flavors, each taking turns showing off for me. Reminds me of a barely wine in some ways, very fruity, grassy, with a hint of wine, but oak is the predominant flavor. The pomegranate was quiet, but as expected, the warmth gently coaxed her out of hiding. Overall, I enjoyed this immensely and would want this one again."
"overall: Not great - glad I didnt drop $14 on a bomber to confirm this"
"jd"
"O: Not sure what else to say. I think I could probably tell this wasn't brewed in Belgium, but it's definitely got a lot of Belgian characteristics. It is NOT what I expected it to be, but for what it is; a belgian style BEER, it's great. I just have trouble putting this in the category the brewer did. 4.0"
"- It's a great brew. But it does in fact fall short for me, compared to their other 'Reserve' series beers. It is also off the beaten path for them as a brewer as well. I am more impressed with rare brews like their sour saison compared to this. It's not one to cellar for over a year, and it is also not a beer to rave about, and include into the hype machine. But overall I sense the solid quad backing, and like the steps taken to create such a complex, and unique brew. I would love to try it again in another 8 months or so."
"O: This is a beer that exemplifies the need to age certain special releases this is a big beer that will be fully realized in a year and a half to two years, hopefully then the rye will begin to shine and the fruit will mingle with that to make a stellar beer. I hope more people take into account that this and other beers needs some growth before they are truly realized."
"O-In many ways, this reminds me of the North Coast Grand Cru. Too light for the style, syrupy, boozy, unfocused, not enough barrel character for a beer claiming barrel aging as an attribute. This one has the added detriment of being unpleasantly over spiced. Not a fan of this one."
"O: Not to bad but sometimes to much fancy pants blending is overdone. Keeping ti simple is always a good thing too."
"Full-flavored and not overly sweet. Doesn't conceal the higher ABV, but remains pretty darn easy-drinking nonetheless."
"O: This is not a typical quad but i love it...very complex and tasty. I'd get this one again for sure."
"O: this is a great beer. different than most quads, but still very good."
"O – Although I am no expert in Belgian beers this doesn’t seem to be a quadruple from appearance, I am confused here. Doesn’t have that typical Belgian cloudiness either. I don’t know where to put this beer, it is in a class of its own. I think it has suffered low ratings because it had the misfortune of being labeled a ""quad""."
"O- This is a good beer. I want to drink more and have purchased several bottles without disappointment. But, I don't get the same sense of pleasure I've had from other Reserve Series beers. I think the brewer could do better. If I don't consider the style as ""quad"" I find this to be a very enjoyable beer. Rating this as a quad, I find it lacking, but still worth seeking out and drinking."
"I have been on this beer for months waiting for it to come out! I had no reason to drink tonight other then to try a beer from one of my 3 favorite breweries. It pours a clear amber color??? I like my quads dark, never had one i could read through. The smells: Belgian yeast is huge, i get the Pomegrante, maybe some red wine. The smell is off the charts! When i bring this beer to my lips i get a revalation of great tastes: Both the oak wine and the rye whiskey both shine through nice, the fruits are there too. This isn't your papas quad but it is a damn good beer!"
"O: This isn't at all bad, and certainly not nearly as bad as some reviews have suggested. VERY drinkable for the abv, and the taste is moderate and enjoyable. The downfall, as I mentioned before, is the lack of depth and complexity. Though, my opinion is not very authoritative on the style, not my kind of beer, but I enjoy it nonetheless."
"Overall I am incredibly disappointed with this beer. I had very high hopes considering its my favorite style and my favorite brewery. That being said its not a bad beer and if I saw it on tap I might consider ordering it."
"O - Enjoyed this thoroughly! Too drinkable, yet very complex, great Belgian esters and phenols, depth of character, tons of layers. Can't tell it's 11% ABV at all."
"22 oz Bottle, fresh from the distributor. Pours effervescent clear golden-amber body, minimal head, with minimal lacing. Loud carbonation crackles in the glass. Smell is spice, sweet wheat, heavy clove and banana, some juicy fruit. Initial flavors are pomegranite-like acid juice, clove, banana, caramel, alcohol bite. Fairly well balanced. Some oak and vanilla come through, spice is medium. Mouthfeel is medium, the high and fine carbonation scrub away most of the body- I think this beer could of done with less co2. Overall I say this is pretty good, but not something I will put large amounts of in the cellar. It will be interesting to see where this is at in a few years."
"Overall: This is pretty one dimensional to be honest. The drying quality is nice and the mouthfeel is too. The sweet fruits go well with the triple like base beer. Good but not what you'd expect from Deschutes Reserve series."
"Overall as other reviews/comments have suggested, if you're looking for Rochefort 10 this ain't it. But it is an interesting beer to be sure. The taste is a little more one-dimensional than I'd hoped, but this is still a tasty beer that I enjoyed sipping. I think I enjoyed looking at it at least as much though."
"O: Deschutes never fails to impress me. This isn't you typical Quad if it is even a Quad. But the label says ""Belgian-Styled Quad"" so given that, I think it is a great beer. A deviance from the style that definitely works."
"O - Mmph. Ok, a bit let down."
"If you can get past the labeling, you're in for a tasty, light, yet high abv beer that is well suited for hotter days on your porch."
"Overall: I am surprised that they say this took 5 years to create on the label. The color was the first indication that it would not be like the Trappist quads I have come to love. The Pomegranate is too much on top of the already sweet beer. The yeast doesn't give me the spicy or fruity character I want. I am very disappointed with this beer, but maybe my expectations are wrong."
"O: Sometimes, I'm a little more lenient on rating a beer if I enjoy it regardless of the style placed on it by the beer drinking public. Deschutes pigeon-holed themselves though by calling this a Quad in the first place. Admittedly I'm not very experienced in the Quad style. I can think of at least one other beer lover who is more versed and would ""know best"". I have however tried some of the higher rated Quads available in America. They all typically share similar characteristics; deep layers of complexity, big fruits, heavy sugars, and an unabashed booziness. This literally shares none of those attributes. From top to bottom, I can't think of a better definition for ""not impressed"". It's not offensive, but it's definitely not up to my expectations for the style. Easily the most forgettable and weakest of the Deschutes Reserve Series so far. 2/5"
"Interesting nose of baby aspirin and soft raspberry comforts with caution. Clear yellow filtration victim of a beer screams anything but quad. Is this a triple? Misnomer city. First sip reveals corn syrup and chardonnay. The finish on this beer is dry and boozy, evoking a flavor profile more suited to a gin than a beer. The finish is rife with cotton candy and biscuity notes. The Stoic escapes the fearful possibility of oversweetness, yet falls victim to many other pitfalls of American-made Belgian-style ales. The burps are nice though, filtering out much of the nonsense and leaving me with a pils-y flavor soaked in belgian air. Perhaps that's how this beer was meant to be enjoyed."
"Drinkability/Overall: I haven't had a beer this interesting in a while. Lots of flavor components, great character and evolution as the beer warmed, and tasty right to the finish. I almost had another one afterward, but instead decided to pick up a few bottles for down the line. Who knows? Maybe like the actual drinking of the beer, perhaps it will get better the longer it lingers."
