"Overall: A solid version of a quad. A nice one to sip on a cold and thoughtful winter's night, as we wait for Spring."
""
"Poured a thick looking light caramel color with almost no head or lacing.  Not much to offer in aroma.  The dark fruit and some caramel are in their but not strong.  The flavor is pretty good, good bit of sweet malt, some fig and caramel.  A little syrupy, especially at the end but the lip smacking malt is great.  Not a bad job of hiding the 11.8% alcohol.  Decent but not spectacular quad."
""
"This is a very good Belgium Ale. I will buy this again."
"Super smooth for such a high alcohol content. A must for belgian beer drinkers."
"I wouldn't buy a 6 pack of this"
"I purchased this bottle because of the high alcohol content, typically not many beers at this store with this high of abv.  This beer was surprisingly smooth with a lot of flavor. Would highly recommend, especially if you are just looking to have a couple."
""
"On tap at the airport in ABE. Wow, this is big. Very big. Huge banana taste. Lots of sweet candied sugar flavors with hints of yeast and bread. Seems like more of an american version of the style over the better Belgian versions. It’s good, just hard to finish."
"   Since I am not familiar with the style, maybe this is right on. I will finish the rest of the 4 pack, but one at a time."
""
"This by far the most underrated beer I have ever drank. I think it was excellent on all phases I could not recommend enough"
"Nose features lots of sweet malt, candied dark fruits, rum, and a touch of sour that fades into more sweetness. Taste is much the same.  Lots of malty sweetness, candied dark fruits (dates and cherry), subtle clove like spice and rum booze. Low on the hop and bitter as expected with the style.  Sweet, malty, and a nicely masked boozey brew given the ABV."
""

"Reddish brown color -- almost pink grapefruit when held to light -- with very little head.  Candied apples stand out in the aroma.  Smooth, layered taste with flashes of caramel; light brown sugar; spiced rum spices (vanilla, orange, cinnamon, clove, anise); cherry cordial; plum; and a little banana bread.  Thin syrupy mouthfeel with average carbonation.  Alcohol is very well hidden.  Not Earth-shattering, but a decent attempt.  Glad I bought a four-pack."
""
""
"Packs a wallop!  Good winter beer."
""
""
"Very nice Belgian.  Hides the alcohol well and is an easy drinker."
""
""
""
"O: A good quad but not my favorite. Improves as it nears room temp. Would buy again but there are others I would buy first."
""
"Nice color; head dissipates quickly. Lots of flavors from malt to fruit. Good alcohol warmth and very smooth. A definite favorite I'll add to my list of ""must have again""."
"Overall:  This is a very good American version of a Belgian quad.  Very true to the style and delicious.  I’m certainly getting this again."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle dated 11/18/14. Pours brown and murky with a small head that fizzles away. Aroma has that typical Belgian yeast spiciness with some burnt sugar. Flavor initially follows suit, but then plunges into a phenolic nastiness. Took two swigs, once while cold and once after the beer had warmed up a considerably. Sadly I had to drain pour this beer. I hate band-aidey phenolics so couldn't even choke this down."
""
""
"Fills a goblet with a murky brown, thick liquid with almost no head despite an aggressive pour.  Smell is lights with brown sugar, raisan and alchohol present.  The taste is sweet on the front end, with brown sugar, dried fruits and then a moderate alchohol burn on the back end.  This had the creaminess of a good stout.  I've had better Quads, but overall this was enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Easy to drink, which is very dangerous considering the ABV. Smooth taste, with a little bit of a strong alcohol taste. If you just want to chill out with 1 or 2 beers, I highly recommend this. Enjoy"
""
""
"Nice solid take on this style"

"O: a tasty Amer. quad with fairly good complexity and balance, and a higher ABV than the flavor suggests."
"Deep garnet orange in color with a thick, viscous appearance. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to a foamy ring. Ripe apple, sweet fig, and banana aromas with an unmistakable booziness at the back end. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a smooth oily feel in the middle surrounded by light but tangy carbonation. Ripe banana and dark fruits flavors with a sticky sweet malt backbone. Tangy hop bitterness through the middle to the end. Unmistakable booziness throughout. Finished semi-dryly with lingering fruity sweetness and earthy yeasty aftertaste. "
""
"Not for everyone. Strong alcohol aftertaste but somewhat fruity apon sip. I found it to taste better extremely cold. It really does remind me of a barely wine style ale. But if u wanna get hammered with a six pack this is your beer. If u can handle the price"

"O: Surprised by the banana presence, great carbonation. Very enjoyable."
""
"Overall a solid beer but it is missing that punch that I expect from a quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"This may be a far cry from my favorite quad but it's pretty good. At it's pricepoint I probably should have bought another 4 pack for the cellar because I think this will do nicely with some age to calm the booze."
""
"O- This brew is leaning towards being a bit watery in both feel and taste. Nothing off-putting, but there are certainly better quads out there. That said, Weyerbacher makes consistently GOOD brews."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, honey, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour caramel, fruit, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better smell in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Good but a little unrefined. You'd never confuse this one with some of the high quality belgian quads. It actually has some barleywine type flavours, which works for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Big beer that doesn't hit you until about midway through. Very good interpretation of the style. For being a mass produced American quad, this is great."
""
""
"O: I do enjoy how pronounced the esters are and that the alcohols, though bold and apparent, are kept in expert control, lending to fantastic balance... pretty well done quad, according to my tastes in quads"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent quad, but I think that quads in general sacrifice the subtlety of a tripel for higher alcohol content. I would pair this with some cheesecake maybe, or beef stroganoff. It could definitely clean up something fatty for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This beer being my first ""Quad", I enjoyed it enough where I would drink this again if the chance arose and I would seek out other ""Quads"" to compare this too. Not my go-to type of beer but definitely a nice change of pace beer."
"Overall I'd definitely include this in a Belgian taste off, and I'd share with friends as a great conversation beer, also very appropriate to small servings in wine glass or as part of a flight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - Some interesting flavors in this Quad, but the taste profile was too dark for my personal preference, as if some of the sugars were clearly burnt. The nose was the best part of the glass. The individual aspects of the taste profile also seemed out-of-synch with each other, like slightly mismatched colors in a palette. It's worth a taste, especially if you're a fan of Quads, but not one I'll be looking for in the future."
""
"O - It is a decent quad. I don't think I will rush out to buy it again, but Weyerbacher is rarely a first choice on anything."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent quad. Not sure that I would go out of my way for this one, but nothing wrong with it. I would prefer to have the anniversary beers that they make. (16 was soooo good)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, when I drink quads I try to only drink good quads. This wasn't good, but was certainly drinkable, and I'm glad to have tried it, from my home state after all. Cheers. Oh Yeah!"

"overall nothing world class but an enjoyable quad. recommended."
""
""
""
"O: A solid stab at the style and something I'd drink again, but I wouldn't kill for it again, either. Seems like the bottle variation is all over the place."

"An interesting quad with lots of flavor, but not exactly all working together in harmony. There are many better out there. Drinkable, but not recommendable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Outside of the cough syrup like fruit flavor, there is a strong taste of alcohol. I just don't get why that would be appealing to anybody, but cheers if you like it. I wouldn't drink it if I were you though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Booze filled. That's all I can think of. I've had stronger beers that conceal more than this. The flavors and aromas I picked up were nice, but I think the alcohol overshadows this beer too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A sweet and tasty Belgian quad. Very much worth a try if you get the chance."
""
""
""
"This is a simple though solid quad. It's intensely malty with caramel and sugar adding character. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. The ABV adds warmth and body. This may not be the most impressive quad, but it certainly has all the makings of something delicious. If you enjoy a strong, malty Belgian beer then you should check this beer out."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice quad done from this side of the pond. Happy to have scored this beer when I was traveling through Easton, PA at the brewery."
""
"O: The alcohol is a little rough, but that's expected from an 11.8% brew that was bottled 2 months ago and is intended to be aged. Still a solid American take on the style, although it could definitely use more complexity to stand up to the European counterparts. Worth a try"
""
""
""
"O-Nice bold beer with great flavors, better out there but still very enjoyable"
""
"O- not Westy, Rochefort, or St B but damn good!"
"O: a nice representation of the style - fairly true-to-form, but delivered well, showing craftsmanship; some alcohol slips through, but I don't mind; may be a little thinner and less hearty than other quads, but I found it enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good quadruple. Doesn't compare to the top Belgian versions, but then it's a fraction of their price."
"They got all the basics right with this, but the beauty of a good quad is in having a big, sweet, and rich beer that's also refined and somewhat balanced. Weyerbacher Quad is notably lacking in refinement and balance. If they can smooth out the rough edges, this could be a solid quad, but the bottle I had is well short of the mark."

"O - Not a big fan of belgians, not a huge fan of this either. For the style I think its probably pretty decent, not especially enjoyable to drink. Take this review with a grain of salt"
"O - It's a good beer but I prefer many other Quads before this. It a competitive price to many of those others though. I feel if the hops went into the boil a little longer it would have gone a long way, or maybe I shouldn't open beers so fresh (no beer cellar or place to have one). Wish I could try this beer aged 2-3 years to see the difference, but not one I would rush to buy again to have."
""
""
"I suspect this would be a fantastic quad with a few years on it, but fresh it's a little overpowered by the alcohol heat. I'll probably throw one in the cellar, just to see how it turns out."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange tinted ruby with fast fading head and no lacing. Given the abv, not unexpected. Smell: dark brown sugar, overripe banana, dates, somewhat vinous. Taste: sugary... caramelized sugar with potential pancake syrup underneath a lot of grape skin and a little tart cherry and pepper. Spicy booze hit towards the end of the sip lingers through the finish, keeping it from becoming cloying even as it leaves a sugary coating behind. Feel starts almost syrupy then into creamy full bodied-ness that thins out gradually. It was an enjoyable sipper, but I wouldn't seek it out again (at least not this fresh). Bottled 11/16/12, best within 5 years."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"O - This was an enjoyable Quad, something I haven't found by many US breweries. Admittedly, this is not one of my favorite styles. The fruit flavors are complex and pull up just short of cloying. The alcohol is well hidden for a beer this big. Weyerbacher is a personal favorite brewery of mine, so perhaps I am biased, but I thought this was a very well done quad."
"NOTE: This is a review from my notes, as most are. Notes predate this review by about six weeks."
""
""
"O- really enjoyed this quad. I need to get more of these. Well done weyerbacher"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A touch on the sweet boozy side but solid otherwise."
""
"Toasted dough nose. Flavor is very interesting. Complex to a degree with honey, but it almost seems like honeycomb, fully present. Sweet tone dominates things, but it isn't overpowering in my opinion. Kind of smooth, yet boisterous. Nice feel. Pretty good, for a quad. Especially since it's an American production."
""
""
""
""
""
"Now, for the remainder. Some of the sludge was embedded on the punt/kick. Cloudy, slightly watery, but not a marked change in taste. Bottom line: It will hold up very well over a long period."
""
""
""
""
"M thin in the mouth, incredibly sticky afterward (about 30 seconds after a sip, I realized my lips were stuck together with sugar-adhesive!) Nice warming in the tummy."
""
"This was a pretty good quad, nice flavor although the alcohol taste can become a bit too much."
""
""
"O: This tastes more like a cross of a Barleywine and a tripel. I do not like it very much and do not recommend this beer. It's not terrible, but certainly not even average."
""
""
"originally reviewed: 12-28-2010"
"This is a good slow sipper and certainly representative of the style. Some of the top beers in the world are Quads and this one is not world class, but it is still good!!!"
"Overall: this is an imperfect but pretty good quad. It's nice not to have to go to Belgium for flavors like this."
""
""
"O - Very nice, great beer for the price, I would recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really am trying to find some positive comments but I just can't find anything with this beer. A very poor and failed attempt at a complex to craft Belgian style beer, but Weyerbacher got it all wrong. Only other quads I had was a Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Apt 12, but I loved in all aspects. I had about 5-6 sips of this quad and had to unfortunately drainpour as it was gagging me worse with each attempt to sip. An undrinkable mess of a beer. Sorry for the harsh review."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a decent Quad ale that is only held back by the strong alcohol taste. Aside from that, it tastes decent and it feels great on the palate. It's at least worth checking out but I think there are better quads out there than this."
""
""
""
""
"A very affordable take on the style (paid less than $55 for the case. It was enjoyable and very drinkable, but it left a little something to be desired. What it was, I still haven't quite put my finger on. I've had aged bottles before and they had a much different character so this should be a nice addition to a cellar, but I'll have to find that out in a year or so."
"I dig the yeast that Weyerbacher uses in their Belgian varieties. A lot of nice esters in this beer. Nice Quad from an American brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O - This brew is a very solid interpretation of the quad style that doesn't excel in any one area, but also doesn't disappoint either. I would agree with others in that it's not in the same tier as the Trappist offerings, but it's still a beer that I enjoyed while relaxing and watching some basketball on Selection Sunday. I could go for this beer again in the future, though I'd really like to try it with much more age than the young bottle I just had."
"D: This one has some nice flavors going for it, but I found it cloyingly sweet. That said, it's good for the price in terms of both quality and alcohol content. Worth picking up if you're in the mood for a quad."
""

"Review from notes. Pours a rich dark amber with a bubbly head that dissipates quickly into Duvel tulip. Smells of alcohol, yeast, dark fruits such as plum, raisin and fig. A bit of clove and banana presence as well. Mouthfeel is a quick effervescent combo of malt, alcohol, yeast and the aforementioned fruits that is velvety on the palate and then finishes clean.Very well done, the alcohol is present and makes this a wonderful sipper that has a warming effect but is not overpowering and blends nicely with the malt, fruit and yeast flavors. Another solid entry from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
""
"O-Toning down the spice level would improve the beer drastically. This one little tweak makes it almost a 4 or maybe even higher than a 4."
""
"O- I have not had a lot of Quads but this is my favorite of the ones I have had. Nice juicy fruit flavors and big belgian yeast flavors. Many of the Quads I have had have been too boozy and one dimensional for my tastes, but this was a very drinkable Quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's ok but really not bringing anything impressive."
""
"Clear ruby-red color with very thin wisps of head that dissipate quickly. Sweet malty aroma with notes of raisin, cherry, and apple; a touch of alcohol rounds out the edges. A strong, malty flavor; lots of dark fruit notes, and a bit of spicy Belgian yeast. Definitely a bit rough around the edges with lots of alcohol, but it does warm the belly up nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good but not great quad, I've had many better. It is good though and worth trying, but not quite fantastic."
""
"overall- not as good as most Belgian Quads, but still good. but hopefully some age with smooth things out."
"Extremely impressed with this beer. For the style, I would take this over many of the Belgian examples I've had. Very well done. I will be finding room in my cellar for more of this."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Weyerbacher snifter, a crystal clear mahogany liquid with a delicate, wispy head that dissipated almost completely after a few minutes. Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, raisins, alcohol warning. Taste was strong with booze, and it was felt too (empty stomach syndrome, I admit), lots of raisins, woody, with hints of nuts and light spice, mildly hopped. Medium body, maybe a bit thin for the style. Nice and easily drinkable overall, the lighter body compensating for the higher alcohol content."
"Minimal activity visible noted in this full-bodied, mouth-coating lip-licker. Sweet is the conclusion. Good is the beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: overall a good quad, but certainly not one of the greats. there is a certain level of aroma/flavor complexity that is missing as well as my complaints with the mouthfeel. in my opinion, there are many other better brews from weyerbacher."
""
""
""
"Overall, a fine quad. A little hefty for mass consumption at 11.8%, but definitely a go-to for when the mood strikes."
""
""
"Overall this is a good to great beer, doesn't quite fit the quad pattern to my taste. Highly recommend nonetheless."
"O: This is a solid Quad, though I prefer Ommegang's Quad over this one. The nose was a bit of a let down on this ale, but other than that, it is solid."
""
"O - looks good smells good, the rst leaves a bit to be desired"
""
"Very tasty beer Dave!"
"O-actually, i enjoyed this a lot more than most of the belgian quads that i've had. it definitely has an american sweetness that sets it apart from something brewed by a monk, but that fact didn't distract me at all from being to enjoy this whole beer. alcohol is well hidden too."
""
""
"Overall this is a very respectable attempt by a non Belgian brewery at a difficult Trappist/Belgian style. Kudos Weyerbacher! If you haven't had it, find one NOW!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This one actually does remind me a lot of St Bernardus Abt 12 but less carbonated, i was pleasantly surprised. Its always a good sign when your first taste you say out loud ""wow"". Great beer!"
"The feel is medium with appropriate carbonation. I like my quads to be a little more fortifying. This is a little too straightforward, but it's definitely not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- The drinkability is quite high for a beer of such strength. For almost 12% ABV, this is definitely a winner. Packs a hell of a punch without skimping on flavor or depth."
""
""
"It's good, but booziness is an issue here. It's an 11 percenter and it's not shy about it. Quite good, but not super complex. Aging will probably do something neat to it, but its tasty now as well."
"Chimay blue with an easy win."
"Creamy and a bit bitter in the mouthfeel, W-Quad is a fine Quad. It isn't overly complex. It isn't overwhelming in flavor, but it does confront the palate with nice and sometimes bold flavors, with a spicy twist, that makes it an enjoyable beer experience. Good, accessible Quad that is certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but it does fall short of the usual Belgian quads. Glad I tried it but probably not one I would look for again. I think I'll let the remaining bottles age for another year and revisit then to see whether age helps."
""
""
""
""
"[82/100]"
""
""
""
""
""
"However this beer does need some recognition for it's drinkability at such a high abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The aroma and taste are both a little too boozy for how I like my Quads. Not a bad beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is cherry and belgian yeast. Not too intense with the alcohol, but very well balanced and tastey. I was looking forward to this and it didn't disapoint."
"O: This is the first Quad-stlye that I have had, and I'm pretty impressed with it! You definitely need to appreciate fruit/sweet flavors to enjoy it. The mouthfeel is amazing. For the alcohol content, it goes down pretty well, but I don't think I could drink any more than 2 in one sitting. I also really enjoyed the look of the beer in the glass with all of the sediment floating around."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a light purple body with not alot of head, that doesn't hang around. The smell is fruity, mostly grape. The taste is tart at first, a raisin taste, then it goes sweeter, almost grape with some berry taste. Nice mouthfeel and overall this is my first quad, and i think it is really good beer."
"O: This is one of the better quads I've had. For me, Rochefort 10 is still supreme, but this is a nice one and it's definitely worth a 4 pack."
"O: Not my favorite quad. However it's only been in bottle 10 months; maybe it will benefit from a little aging."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is an easily drinkable beer but one that I found just a touch too sweet for my tastes. Without a glass of water nearby finishing this one might have been a challenge. When I compare this review with my notes on other beers in the style I think that this one lacks some of the complexity and subtleness found in the Trappist BSDAs. As with most Weyerbacher beers I think this one is pretty well made and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to it with another years or two of bottle age. I’ll revisit this review if I find my scores would change."
"If this beer could be faulted for anything, it's that it might be too potent and sugary. I can see how the massiveness of this ale could drive some away; this is just about the farthest thing from a Budweiser you could get, and still be drinking a beer. I, however, think it's magnificent. Five stars."
"I think this brew has a great drinkability. Its crisp and delicious. I love Weyerbacher brews and this isn't any different. This brew does back a big boozy hit, that might turn some people away, but for the true brew drinker is a gem."
"Definitely a sipper, but this is a nice glass of beer."
"Overall it's pretty good but not spectacular."
"I tried a new bottle from 2011 and had a similiar view but with more of the alcohol flavor present and more belgian yeast flavor present."
"D-Dangerously drinkable but more of a sipper than anything. This is definitely one of my most impressive beers I have drank in months!!!! WORD"
"Cheers..."
"Overall - It's really delicious to start and then the finish is disappointing. Nothing to steer me away from it, though. Definitely will get more of this."
"O. Easy drinking Quad that hides it ABV very well."
"I got myself a sample of this at the brewery once and it was a nice shade of brownish red with a tan colored head on it. The aroma had some strong alcohol coming off of it. The other aromas were yeast and malts, and some aged fruit. The taste was pretty good. I found this to been enjoyable but I wouldn't buy a case of it. The mouthfeel was a little thicker than I expected it to be so that was nice. Overall it's pretty good but not my top choice for this style."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip. Pours slightly cloudy red-orange color with a 1.5 finger foamy off white head with decent retention. Very minimal glass lacing. Aromas of cherries, banana, dried fruits, candi sugar, and vanilla; with a bit of spices and alcohol. Taste of banana, dark fruits, candi sugar, and some caramel; with light spices and a bit of bourbon. Very sweet flavor with no bitterness noticed at all. The finish is fairly dry, with only a small bit of lingering sweetness. Incredibly smooth finish with no alcohol noticed except for a slight warming with a light alcohol bite after the finish. I was extremely surprised at the smoothness for it's alcohol content. Medium carbonation and creamy full body. Overall, this quad was quite impressive, though not very complex, it has a very nice flavor balance with a very smooth drinkability for its alcohol level."
"O- While I do like the yeast forward and drinkability even with the 11.8% abv, this is a very simple example of a belgian quad. Lacking the usual darker color or taste complexitites I'd expect. Would/will drink this again, but prefer other Quad's as better examples. Some age might do wonders in bringing more flavors out, which I intend to do."
"D: this beer is a solid example of the style, I love weyerbacher they seem to put out many fine beers that taste better than most but are rated lower, they are under the radar."
"Pours a medium copper color w/ almost no head. I'm actually surprised this Quad isn't darker in color. Most of the quads I've had have been super dark. Oh well... The smell is very sweet- a sweet fruity smell- very raw smelling. Again, very surprised at the smell. Not bad, just different than any quad I've had. The taste is nice, probably the best part of this beer. The amazing thing is that at 11.8% ABV, I hardly taste any alcohol at all. Tart fruit and alcohol are the main things I taste w/ this beer. The mouthfeel is very tart and crisp. It's almost like a slap across the face. There's also a slight alcohol burn 5 seconds after you take a sip. Not bad at all. Drinkability is good, but this is a sipper for sure. Not a great quad, and definitely different than any I've had before. Aging this one for a couple years would probably improve it quite a bit. Maybe I'll get around to that someday. Glad I got to check this beer out."
"Pours a dark copper color with a bit of a reddish hue. Off-white head forms but then falls fairly quickly. Some spotty lacing remains on the sides of the glass and there's a thick collar. Some bubbles on top. Nose brings forward some light clove character along with bread crust. A bit of sweetness and dark fruits there as well. Taste is quite nice with some sweetness coming through along with a bit of booze. Some light spice as well as dark fruits. Some figs and dates there. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Drinks quite well. Really tasty."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits and spices. Taste is good, fruits, some alcohol, a bit of hops, very flavorfull. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality brew."
"Overall a well crafted quad. Not as complex as the belgians but still a great value."
"D- this wasnt my favorite weyerbacher beer. not by a long shot. maybe some time in the cellar would have done this beast some good. too strong to drink a second one of, and with the surprisingly mild taste im not sure id want to."
"drinks well. not quite as complex as I'd like, but tasty and a tremendous value for the style."
"D: Nothing's too drinkable at 11.% ABV, but the alcohol on this isn't harsh at all. A very drinkable Quad."
"D - definitely drinkable for 11.8%, but the alcohol could be a little much for some. A very enjoyable beer that I'm throwing down for a few years to see how it matures"
"D - The alcohol presence never becomes cloying and the balance and flavor makes for a very drinkable quad. A great offering from Weyerbacher. Definitely something I'd pick up again and again."
"Weyerbacher does their thing with their Quad. It definitely holds its' own with a style that's hard to perfect. Another winner from Weyerbacher.. recommended."
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, strong 'burn' from the sourness in the back of the throat, nice complexity makes it appealing to drink but strength makes it a bit hard to drink"
"D- I actually think this is better served cold from the bottle. On tap this is a different beast altogether, and IMO would fall into the A- range. Bottle conditioned its still decent though. Booze is a little intense, but the standard Quad flavors are there. A sipper for sure that should be respected, but not cherished as such others in this style."
"D: Pretty sweet and boozy which I don't dislike, but it hurts the drinkability."
"Weyerbacher Quad has a light brown colour and a head that fades very fast and doesn't leave that much lacing. The smell is malty and maybe a little chocolaty. The taste is malty with hints of cinnimon and maybe cloves. The alcohol isn't particularly noticable given the ABV.This beer is foamy and deliciously spicy, a very intertersting brew"
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bananas, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, bananas, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a pretty good brew. I didn't check the ABV on it before drinking it, but I could tell it was quite high from the flavor (I was right). Had a good sweet flavor from the malt and fruit present with the alcohol shining through on the followthrough. Definitely warmed my throat up upon swallowing. A must try for anyone who hasn't."
"I plan to get another four pack to lay down in the cellar for a year or two."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel, medium-plus carbonation. easily one of the best american-born quads i've every had."
"D: very good. Hides the alcohol very well and isn't too sweet. Only have one, but I could see drinking two in one sitting if I was in the mood and had a few hours and didn't need to stay sober."
"Overall impression: I'm not convinced there's much potential for aging, but it's a pretty solid as is."
"Pours a not-too-foamy or large headish copper brown but leaves a touch of lace. Hearty smell, not real boozy, but yeasty with some tropical fruit/orange notes that are typical of a Belgian and there are some sweet sugary notes. Touch of spice like pepper but can't really go into detail. A sticky, thicker, heavier body hits my tongue. Raisins, figs, dark fruits like grapes and possibly black cherry and a touch of sweet fruit are all in there, as well as a little zip of clove or pepper (coriander?) along w/ citric notes like orange and banana for that hint of sharpness. A tad vinous to me b/c of high ABV, the malts are noticeable w/ a touch of sweetness for balance as there is some caramel, candied-sugar and a touch of toasted malt is barely in there. A slow sipper as not only is the thickness and heartiness of the beer alot to take in, but quite frankly the ABV warms the mouth (like a quasi-shot of whiskey) and I can actually feel my lips and tongue slightly warmed and a twang of burn in the chest (not like a horrible hot streak when you take a shot of Wild Turkey 101). I enjoyed this quad but it just didn't have the exceptional taste or diversity of beers from Belgian; still, a very good representation of this style and quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Well, the ABV is hot, as you've probably noticed from the rest of the review, but it's a damn fine beer. Great flavors, and I love the nose on this one. I think I may pick up a 4 pack and put it away for a couple of years to let the heat fade. A great beer from a great brewery."
"Drinkable beer. Not very memorable. Nothing to really stand out, other than thin mouthfeel. Not what I expected from a quad."
"D- This is another dangerous beer. Great flavors and a nice smooth feel combined with a well hidden high ABV, makes these easy to put down. Like they say, enjoy in moderation."
"I really liked this one. Will add it to the list of quads that I enjoy over the winter months."
"Awesome tasting Quad and very drinkable for such a high ABV."
"For the style, this is too boozy and does not have enough of the fruity esters that would be expected. The carbonation is excellent. Weyerbacher should bottle it in a 28oz bomber with cork and cage (if they do not already do so) All in all it is a very solid brew and I am enjoying it quite a bit."
"M- Dry, medium carbonation and fairly full body."
"D/M: WAY too drinkable for how strong it is. Its nice at first but then you realize how strong it is. Very sweet but does not stick to the palate."
"D: The beer is easy to drink for the style because the alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and taste."
"Quad pours out a dark burnt copper/orange color that kinda glows and is not all that clear looking, some haze within. Looks lighter than alot of quads without the dark browns. A bit of foam on top, nothing huge. Smells is dark fruit, apple, plum, maybe some apricot, some candi sugar, grapes, alcohol, earthy hops maybe. Taste is different than in the past, or maybe thats the tap. There is a nice interplay between the fruit and the yeast, with less of a showing from the deep candi sugar, it's there, but not up there as it's Belgian counterparts. Some alcohol towards the end. Feel is above medium, fullfilling, sharp, lightly carbed and not really hot, but there is a warming quality. Not as sweet and ligering as the Belgians, this had a nice American twist. I'll keep my eyes out for some vintage versions to see how this evolves."
"M/D - definitely leaves behind an alcohol tingle. cooling. much thinner than the quads i typically love. i'd go for this one again though, it was a nice quad."
"D - Strong alcohol content, would not want to have more than 2 with this bad boy."
"Overall: My first experience with quad was not a good one. It was a fairly young bottle and my first quad at the time. I had mixed feelings about. Now that my pallet has expanded coupled with a two year old bottle. This time it went alot better. This is a good attempt at a quad from an American brewery. Definitely good to keep a few around for when the urge strikes to have a big alc. Brew."
"D - This is delicious, complex, and accessible."
"D - Scary easy for the ABV. This is one I'll have again for sure. Haven't had it fresh but I was told it is best after aged for about a year, so I will be aging a couple from this four pack and do a comparison with how it tastes fresh here in a couple months."
"Sweet alcohol finish."
"Pours a hazy orange/copper color with a short tan head that fades to leave a nice ring and decent lacing. Smells of sweet figs, raisins, plums, spice and vanilla with a boozy tinge. Tastes like the aforementioned fruits plus banana, orange peel, spice, vanilla, brown sugar and caramel. Surprisingly, not that boozy considering the ABV and that most people complain about this being too hot when fresh. Low carbonation gives a great mouthfeel that is smooth and rich. Tastes great and has a nice texture, easy to drink but it does sneak up on you. I am curious to see how it would age, I might have to go find more."
"I need to go out and get some more of these for drinking in 2012."
"This quad poured a darker than expected color which was good but I was expecting more carbonation. The carbonation was not to low but was lower than I have experienced with other strong belgiums. The beer smells very spicy with hints of dark fruits and a little hint of booze. I was happy with the taste but not blown away. I tasted raisins, spicy crisp semi sweet malts, and some pleasant alcohol and yeast notes. While not earth shattering this quad is very good. I bought a few 12 oz bottles which are great for after work!!"
"D: This beer has bold flavors, and is very complex. The alcohol is there, but it is dangerously well hidden."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to reddish color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, sweet, dark fruit, especially plum and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, sweet, dark fruit, again, quite plummish, and a small, dry alcohol burn. Smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry fig and alcohol aftertaste. A bit sweet and boozy for the style, but not bad, average like."
"MD-Very creamy. The high alcohol is very apparent and make this beer a little hard to drink, but as a slow sipper this is a good beer."
"This is a good, after-dinner, sitting on the beach Quad if that makes sense. Definitely on the ligher side (malt depth and color wise, if that makes sense) Solid overall!"
"D-not sure about this one, too sweet and boozey for me."
"Bottle. Pours a reddish brown clear color. No sediment or yeast floating around. Tan head. Aroma of sweet raisins and dark fruit. The taste is sweet with an alcohol bite along with a slight bitter end. No lacing at all. Very sweet but not bad overall. Medium mouthfeel. Not a style I routinely drink but not a bad sipper."
"Prost!!!"
"D: It really doesn't seem like an 11.8% beer. Not until you finish the pint and stand up, anyway. It is sold in 4 packs for a reason. It's a smooth drinker and is sure to cut your trips to the fridge down for subsequent beverages."
"D: This beer just doesn't taste good. Had three our four sips but I'm going to toss the rest."
"The carbonation is practically non existent, and may as well be called what it is, which is flat. I love a good Quadrupel, but this beer is simply not very good. It may be a bad bottle? I may give this another chance in the future."
"*= ideas from other taster"
"Maybe it was the full stomach, maybe it was all the alcohol/sweetness in it, I don't know. I just didn't love it. Too unbalanced; it was very in your face with the alcohol and sweetness."
"M Still. Not flat, just not bubbly feeling."
"Notes: Quite a remarkable offering from Weyerbacher, maybe not the best I have had from them but it sure is up there. Ultimately it is quite nicely rounded for such a hefty brew, and may lack a few nuances to take it to a next level but it is not far from it."
"Drinkability: Seems like a too sweet English Barleywine or Old Ale with just a hint of Belgian yeast. Disappointing Quad, but it does smell good."
"This beer pours a cloudy ruby color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of bubblegum, star anise, and a hint of plums. The aroma is nice, but would be better if the bubblegum aspect where not so dominant. The taste is more balanced than the aroma. There is still significant bubblegum, but there is a lot more spice. There is also some heat in the finish that is really well integrated into the beer. I really enjoy this beer's flavor. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good quad...not great but good. I would happily drink this again though."
"D: Without looking at the label, one would never know the Quad is creeping up on 12% ABV. It drinks much lower. The drinkability rating increases along with this brew's complexity as it comes to room temperature."
"Quad is actually one of Weyerbacher's better high-gravity beers, as I enjoyed it much more than the barleywine or imperial stout. But in the realm of the Quadrupel, which is a pretty tough place, this is simply a decent beer."
"This bottle has been sitting in my fridge for far too long. It must be taken down immediately! It pours a hazy tawny amber topped by less than a half-finger of glowing ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuits, yeast, nutmeg, walnuts, and caramel. This may be a malty brew... The taste holds notes of everything just listed, along with cinnamon (nearing the hot kind found in chewing gum), rye, and a teensy bit o' whiskey. A nice oaky nuttiness pervades the lingering aftertaste. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice quad; not the best around, but emblematic of the quality I've come to expect from Weyerbacher."
"drinkable, because of lack of overwhelming flavoring, but the lack of carbonation detracts."
"Overall, a decent quad for the price. However, it did lack some big flavors and a body. But it was alright and good to see it in the MN market. Slow drinking imo."
"(D)- A good quad with everything you would expect for the style. A little too sweet for my liking though; almost to the point of being sugary. I would rather see more of those dark fruits throw their weight around, but its the sweetness doing just that. Still enjoyable."
"Overall, Weyerbacher Quad definitely gets my recommendation. I got this 4 pack for a very good price here in PA. Definitely worth a try!"
"Drinkability is hurt by the heat, good to try but not something I would seek out again,"
"Tried a 4 pack of this new-to-MN beer, it was pretty good. An interesting mix of flavors but not exactly what I was hoping for. Still, worth a try."
"Now this is a big boy beer! Not for those who only dabble in the craft beer world. Well, not if you want to enjoy it. There is a big alcohol flavor, and a big alcohol scent. However, that isn't a negative, because the Belgian flavors blend well with it, and make this much more delactible. I would not drink on an empty stomache however, or the room may start spinning much earlier than you want. Try it with a steak or pork loin! Good stuff!"
"D - Na I don't think I will have this again. I would pick up the Hersey again if anything Weyerbacher."
"A nice enough beer, but not something I can see myself coming back to very often."
"D - At almost 12% this would be a tough one to drink to many. But it is a great sipping beer."
"D-overall a decent quad good tasting but really no stand out of the style"
"Not a beer that I'd sit down and drink one right after the other."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. Its fairly complex and not too difficult to drink. This is my first quad, and I quite thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Pours a dark, hazy orange color, with a big fluffy off-white head which disappears almost as quickly as it forms. Smells like Belgian yeast, spices, ripe fruit and Granny Smith apples, but no alcohol. On the palate, I get Belgian candi sugar, apple cider, vanilla and a bit of juicy fruit flavors. A big beer, easy to drink and not all that complex. Finishes somewhat dry, with the nearly 12% alcohol finally making itself known."
"not as heavy as you would expect for a 11.8%. almost a watery like mouthfeel. slightly acidic, almost sour. about medium to slightly heavy body. slight carbonation. slightly astringent as well, but i had no problem finishing the bottle, but i wouldnt want another. i wouldnt seek it out again either."
"d - A decent quad. Had some nice banana and spices in the smell and taste, but would have liked a little less alcohol in the taste. Would try again."
"1/2 finger white head, quick dissipation thin layer of head retained on top of orange amber clear body, decent carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose and taste are cardamon, orange peel, some spices with a prevalent belgian yeast smell and taste, dry and firm, but a bit sweet for style, not too heavy. I thought the color was a bit light for style, but the booze was not real noticeable in nose but threw some heat at end of taste. At this ABV as shared bottle makes sense, not real drinkable even for this style."
"D: could drink a few but probably should sip on it slow."
"D - Not my favorite Weyerbacher offering... I can't quite put my finger on it, but many aspects seem muddled/confused and the whole doesn't equal the sum of its parts... However, I didn't have any trouble finishing and while I wouldn't necessarily seek one out in the future, I wouldn't turn it down either... The 11.8% ABV packs quite the punch..."
"Drinkability- the only reason at all I did not give this beer a 5 on drinkability is cuz it packs such a freaking wallop, this is a one you certainly should sip but one if you didnt want to you certainly dont have to and that makes this beer a homerun, is it best quad in the world maybe not I have to be honest and say i have not had enough to make me an expert but maybe its a style I have to look even deep into because I really enjoyed this, This is a great night cap or one to just sip savor the complexity and unwind and ponder ones place in the universe, a nice value considering price for certain and one I would easily recommend to others,"
"Pours a dark amber. Nice and clear with 1/2 finger head. Let it warm up a bit and I'm pulling out dark fruit w/ hints of cherry on the nose. Brown sugar and molasses as well. Taste is a bit hot with alcohol. Subtle notes of fig,plum, and raison with some bread flavors. The yeast profile is lacking w/ what I'd expect from a top-level quad and the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it is nonetheless a enjoyable beer to relax with. I'd like the feel to be a little more full overall bit it was easy to drink, abv withstanding. Enjoyable beer, but there are better offerings available in your local belgian section."
"Pour is a dark copper/amber/ruby and fairly clear...a little light for a quad. Not much head to speak of. The smell is phenomenal with a mixture of grapes, prunes, banana, and bubblegum. I notice the dark fruits first...a mixture of grapes and tart cherries. Then comes bubblegum and a hint of banana. There's some spiciness in there as well. You can feel the alcohol tingling your lips and warming your stomach, but the taste really isn't boozy for me. A bit of stickiness in the feel. I like."
"drinkability: I was really excied to finally find this beer and it was a huge let down."
"Overall Weyerbacher makes some solid beers and this is certainly one of them. Good flavor and excellent mouthfeel. Recommended."
"This is an amazing beer! and probably one of my favorites from the Weyerbacher line up. This beer is nothing short of a challenge to drink a few of especially with the high ABV. If you are looking for the perfect end cap to the evening or sitting by the fire with a loved one or a few friends this would be perfect. I recommend this beer to any drinker that is ready to explore the complexity of Belgian beers and flavor versus balance of alcohol."
"D: Would definitly drink this one and all from the folks at Weyerbacher over and over again and again."
"12oz. bottle served in my Chimay Chalice. No dating indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of unpasteurized cider with a murky clarity. Head was half inch, off-white and creamy/loose. Head eventually dissipates into a skim clustered on one side of the glass and a thin band around the perimeter of the bowl. Some solid sheets of lacing, but weak legs. Nose is dark fruit (plums, raisins and figs), candi sugar and Belgian yeast. Taste consistent with nose; perhaps the addition of some cherries and a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is light-medium and lively, a little oily and finishes semi-dry. Not a lot of complexity to this one, but a very tasty and pleasant sipper that should be allowed to warm to experience some slight changes in character."
"Pours a nice reddish amber with modest foam and a touch of lacing. Only slightly hazy. Nose is lot of sweet fruity Belgian esters with banana, clove, and bubblegum. Fairly coating and heavybodied, many of the same elements from the aroma come through in the taste, but more bubblegum wrapped in plenty of very chewy malts. The chewiness is balanced nicely with a brisk effervescence. Alcohol definitely coems through but is a great compliment to the rest of the experience. Finish is quite sweet and lasting. In general, this one is very enjoyable!"
"O - Definitely a sipper, definitely worth checking out."
"All in all, this is a fairly run of the mill quad. It's not bad, it's just not great. If someone else bought this, I'd happily drink it - but I don't see myself buying it again. There's just too many better alternatives."
"Thick syrupy mouthfeel that's partly cleaned off the tongue by fine and acrid carbonation. A bit too sweet and not quite enough cleansing alcohol. Complex flavor profile, but not particularly representative of the style."
"Drinkability: Not good, I might pour this. The weird thing is I've had this before and thought it was OK-- at least drinkable. This one is not."
"D-the alcohol is present but not to show how big it truely is, the taste is sweet but a ton of yeast and clove, it does have a nice mouthfeel to it, though I wouldn't drink another."
"OVERALL Compared to most other Quads I've tried, this one is lacking in complexity, balance, and subtlety. It is a far cry from La Trappe or Samaranth, for example. But I am glad I tried it and thank BuckeyeNation for making this experience possible."
"I almost hate to post this review, because I am a weyerbacher fan. I'm also a fans of Quads, its really the only Belgian style I actually do like. This beer is fairly brown and really red in the light, it reminds me of a quad in the look. The smell is what throws me, its all big belgian yeast aroma with little more to offer than alcohol. Taste is similar but adds a note of sweetness. Maybe because I've recently had Rochforte 10 and St Bernardus but this beer just really doesnt compare. I guess the quad is best left to the monks. I could see some people liking it but to me it was just yeasty and hot."
"D: This is not your typical quad as the malt seems upped. Enjoyable mild citrus sweetness and yeast presence, but for some reason the alcohol was a negative factor in this one. I am one to advocate a little hotness and discernible alcohol sometimes too. All being said I thought it was an above average beer, but short of good."
"Taste is kind of surprising. There's an initial flavor coupled mostly with carbonation, which fades quickly to a sharper fruity bitey ""tang"". A very decent small brewery attempt at a Belgian style quad. BTW, the alcohol at 11.8% is deceiving...similar to Mad Elf actually."
"Anyways, mouth feel is heavy and smooth if not a little thick and the alcohol burn on the end of this isn't overwhelming or even unpleasant but these could probably use some aging. Overall a good intro to the style and surprisingly tasty."
"D: Overall, I could drink a few of these, and be good to go...to sleep that is. Not a staple for repeat attempts, but once in a while if I want to become three sheets to the wind quickly."
"D: This is more like an English barleywine than a quad. In fact, it's a better barleywine than Blithering Idiot. In any event, a fine sipper."
"The drinkability is decent, I enjoyed this beer over the course of about an hour, not bad at all, but not otherworldly."
"J"
"D: Flavorful, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is the experience I've had with an aged Quadrupel but it seems like time has done this beer some good. Overall, however, I think this beer is good but not one of the better ones I've had in the style."
"Overall, not bad, but there are too many better examples of this style to spend too much time with this one."
"Drinkability: This was a very drinkable beer, all of the flavors, though maybe a little muted, worked very well overall for the this beer. It will be very hard for me to save a couple bottles to age."
"Carbonation is moderate. Quad structure is prevalent throughout in its complexity and although the carbonation plays a role, the beer is quite soft on the back end. Really remarkable finish."
"Pours a cloudy, copper color with suspended sediment. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of citrus (banana), sweet malt, yeast, and alcohol. Fits the style of a Quadrupel. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, citrus (banana), yeast, sweet malt, and slight tart malt. Overall, the alcohol is definitely not hidden, but good body and mouth feel."
"Poured a surprising amber/orange, with a finger of head, and decent lacing. The smell was an interesting mix of tart cherry, raisins, mango, apricot, woodiness, honey, molasses, and orange peel. The taste started out tangy fruity, then earthy/bready/honey/sweet, and then warm bittersweet at the finish. Alcohol surprisingly well-hidden. Felt syrupy on the palate, but the complex flavor mix and warmth at the end made it oh so nice. Very unique and well done example of a Quad."
"D- Moderate. I'll buy more of this, save it for a rainy day. Not an everyday or once-a-week sipper, I'd be happy with once a month on this one. Still, pretty tasty, and by all means a solid effort. Nothing on the Belgian quads, but a solid stateside effort."
"Wow, I'm really impressed by this stuff, I expected a run of the mill quad, but this is so much different from what im used to. Poured a nice orange color instead of the usual dark brown that i see so much in the style. Smelled mainly of plums brown sugar and apricots. It tastes basically like a plum and honey sandwich on some oat bread. However it leaves too much of a bready aftertaste for my liking. Mouthfeel is very nice, slightly syrupy yet creamy pleasantly warming at the end. Highly drinkable, I might be able to do the entire 4 pack but i wouldnt want to its too nice to do that."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: To be honest...not great. The alcohol burn gets old after a few drinks as I feel like I am inhaling Vicks vapo-rub in the finish. Maybe a fresh one would be different."
"Overall this smelled a bit boozier than I was expecting until I saw the 11.8% ABV. The flavor masks the alcohol very well but the beer as a whole is missing a certain heft to push it into the next tier. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Im tasting this with an R10 so maybe its skewing the results, but not good in general."
"A great beer for the price and I'd drink this on a regular basis if it was distributed in my area to save my pocketbook from the trials of Rochefort 8 and Abt. 12 which seem to be in quite a heavy rotation in my fridge."
"be careful! this one will put you down for the count if your careless."
"Big whiff of alcohol out of this, along with some apple. Very cloudy with weak head. Lots of booze and a light apple backing with tropical fruit flavour. Very warming and strong. Finish is surprisingly mild, ending in a lightly bitter anise flavour. Up front, big, complex booze, tropical fruitiness and apple/pear. I think the alcohol in this is taking the forefront a bit too much. Moderate body with some heft and lowish carbonation. Definitely a sipper a touch too boozy for my taste."
"I enjoyed it but I think ill stick to tripels or dubbels."
"D-This is a big beer with a big ABV so I would have to stop at two."
"Weyerbacher is a seriously underrated brewery...I will say that this brew is a little sweet and one dimensional, however it is still delicious."
"Pours a seemingly thin, translucent light amber. Thin head with quick dissipation. Looks kind of dead to me, but fortunately doesn't stay that way. Nose is full of booze (like a booze blast, not just alcoholic) backed with some darkish malt. Seems like a sweet boozey bomb. Taste is just that. Very boozey in a good way, warming as it goes down like a scotch. It's kind of a two trick pony, warming alcohol and sweet fruity malt. No hops to speak of. For me, those two tricks work very well. Kind of thin in the mouth for a big supposedly complex quad, not very coating, and it can be a tough drink because it is so boozey. It works for me, but may not for everyone."
"D- This goes down pretty nicely for the ABV, albeit it is quite a sipper. I could see this aging for another year or two before it hits its peak. What a beast."
"Drinkability: I'd had a few of these in the past, but never knew I didn't review it. This one's aged and mellowed extremely nicely. The alcohol is soft and hardly noticeable, and has taken on some port wine characteristics and toned down sweetness. I think this could even last a few more years, but it's become something pretty special at this point. Another winner from a favorite brewery of mine."
"This is better than I had anticipated. Not a big fan of the style to begin with, but this is solid outing overall. Worth a shot, but Weyerbacher does other styles much better."
"D-Dangerously drinkable but more of a sipper than anything. This is definitely one of my most impressive picks as of late and seems to do well in an, often, misunderstood category."
"D - What started out as a rather medicore drinking experience turned out to be above average, especially after the brew breathed and warmed a bit. Unfortunately for Weyerbacher, I've come to expect ill-hidden alcohol in their bigger brews and unfortunately for me, QUAD is no exception. Had they concealed the alcohol better, the beer would've jumped in both taste and mouthfeel. There's a lot of great stuff going on with this brew, it just isn't quite presented the right way. Though I prefer the barrel aged version, Blasphemy, I would definitely like to do a side by side and see who came out on top."
"I could drink one of these only- I would be in la la land otherwise from the almost 12% abv."
"This beer pours very thin with not much of a head, although most quads don't. The smell is of alcohol and citrus. The taste of this one was not very complex, mostly just alcohol and some very subtle citrus. This beer gets blown out of the water by 3 Philosophers. Overall a very boring beer for this style."
"Munster seems to be doing better than an aged cheddar."
"I bought this baby as a last hurrah since the Spring is warming us and the Barley Wine days are almost gone. It was OK, but a Horn Dog would have been a better send off."
"Al in all, I think I should have opened this a year ago. However, it has become more like a good sipping beer in its old age. perhaps it deserves this level of appreciation given its advanced years."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured a nice glowing light amber with little head. The nose is intensely scented with bubblegum. I've found that many of their Belgian styles are exaggerated versions. This is no exception. That doesn't mean they are necesarily extreme or super complex, rather they take one note notable in a style and run with it. In this case it's the bubblegum notes in the Belgian yeast that are (over?)emphasised. The taste mirrors this as well, and adds a light graininess. The mouthfeel is smooth and mellow, perhaps a bit too much so. A one note interpretation, but not bad."
"Overall- not bad, just feels like a beer with a ""bite bigger than its bark"". Big but not too complex."
"Overall, nice, big, tropical and balanced. Kick your ass if you aren't careful."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. Though it's not quite as graceful or as elegant as one of its Belgian brethren, it still remains a satisfying ale."
"D-This is good but I was expecting a bit more...not earth shattering or legendary but certainly solid...kind of one dimensional...thought it would be a little more complex..."
"D: Super drinkable. Much better with some time on it. Rounds out what can be an angular beer when it is fresh."
"its got a punchy sour alchoholy smell. kinda disturbing. not welcoming. its thick and you can see it when you look through the glass. parallel lines, wood grain-like lines forming... not sure what that means, i know its thick, but im sure its a signal for something im not totally familiar with. that its sticky and viscous? yes, it is. taste is a little banana and double bubble gum. its thick. the smell is there to remind again, too thick. carbonation is not overpowering, but its not working one way or another. its not adding to, its not detracting from, its just there. maybe its helping to pull the taste away from my tongue. i dunno, there is just too much alcohol in the smell and taste, and not enough flavor to offset that. one of the few that provokes a review..."
"D-A good, strong(although the alcohol is fairly well hidden behind all of the sweetness) tasty beer. I would say though that this is a one and done for me. The flavours build to much and become a bit off putting and over the long haul it is just to sweet for me."
"Glad I kept this one around."
"""Should I tell you that this smells like Aquanet hairspray?"""
"Feels a little flat, although that is partially (not completely) offset by a coarseness I attribute to the alcohol. Full bodied, with what carbonation there is being creamy."
"Smooth drinker, but not very creamy. Slicker feel than expected. Medium body. Pretty disappointing. One of these is more than enough."
"Drinkability: There is no real signs of 12% here, goes down pretty smooth. But unfortunately, when I grab a quad I expect a bit more depth."
"Drinkable, but I've had much better quads."
"D: I had no trouble finishing my bottle, and I had to use self-restraint not to dig into a second."
"Overall a nice Quad I'll stick in the cellar."
"Also, a very good winter brew, because it tastes like a tropical summer day, in a glass."
"Out of a standard brown bottle this Quadrupel was a murky amber color with a thin beige head. The retention was not much to speak of and the lacing was minimal. The aroma was potent and sweet, lots of fruity esters, notably the smells of pineapples, peaches, mangos along with candy sugar, alcohol and something a touch dull like paraffin or beeswax. The flavors were really, really sweet. I love this company, but I have to say, this one was cloyingly sweet. At first I tasted the pineapple and a little piney hops but this was soon followed by aggressive candy sugars like a tropical Jolly Rancher candy. Behind the sugars lurked caramel malt, alcohol and some floral hops but they were nearly quashed. The mouthfeel was smooth and a little slick, the body medium/full and the carbonation good. I can see why so much sugar was used to hide the 12%+ but it really killed the drinkability of this one for me along with the likelihood I would try it again."
"Light amber bubbly drink with fleeting white one-finger head. Sweet aroma of toffee, hint of raspberry, maple syrup, and some candied fruit. A very strong taste slaps the tongue like a speed-bag; burnt biscuits and brown sugar concede to alcoholic booze accompanied with candied fruit as the welcoming gift. Medium to heavy in body with a slightly higher than average drinkability. Definitely a nightcap warmer to be sipped slowly."
"D-Good sipping beer on a nice chilly night. The alcohol is slightly off-putting, but a good beer."
"Notes: Another great offering from Weyerbacher which continues to show their diversity of styles with excellent skill."
"Weyerbacher Quad pours a reddish orange color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I smell fruit in the aroma, raisin being what comes to mind first. I think there is some alcohol in the aroma too. There is definitely fruit in the flavor as well, but it's more subdued. I'm kind of underwhelmed with the flavor, it's not bad mind you, but it's not much of a quadrupel either. Alcohol is noticeable in taste and in warming. Kind of mediocre."
"Drink this slow, but drink it often. Very nice on one of the 8 cold days we have in Florida..."
"D: Not one you would pound but a nice sipper. This one would probably improve if it were to be laid down for a year or so."
"D. It is what it is. A big olde Quad to smite thou sobriety? More like a night cap sipper to experience new and then down the road."
"Mouthfeel: Rich and full. very full bodied."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a clear amber with a thin white head. The head does not sty long and leaves no lacing. The aroma is fruit soaked booze, heavy on the booze. The flavor is rum, vanilla and dates. The finish has heavy alcohol notes to it. A medium bodied beer that feels heavier, due to light carbonation and high ABV. The beer is an enjoyable sipper."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and found that I definitely prefer it over their oak-aged version, which I found to be too harsh."
"Pours a hazy brown with a fine creamy head. Aromas of caramel sweetness, (cherries,) and malt. The initial flavor is malt and caramel which decays into a rich, warm sweetness. The warm sweetness lingers at the throats top. Very complex and rewarding when enjoyed slowly."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and pretty smooth. I didn't find it at all cloying even though it's quite sweet. This is definitely a sipper, but a tasty sipper, and overall one of the better beers I've had from Weyerbacher."
"	I love this Quad and finally had a chance to sit down and review it. I picked up a bottle down at The Headkeeper along with a few other brews I'll be taking over to the folk's house tomorrow for a beer tasting. I poured the Quad into my tasting snifter with enough tilt to create a nice white head. The foam dissolved, but there was a great ring around the inside of the glass. The color was crystal orange, very clear, no haze. The aroma reminded me of a few of my favorite barley wines, a fair amount of alcohol, dark fruits and sweet grass. The flavor was great, sweet and somewhat dark, like a really sugary molasses, almost like Blithering Idiot only not quite as heavy. I would definitely recommend this beer, and would like to try cellaring it for future enjoyment."
"Pours a nice golden orange. Amber, I guess.. with a white head which largely settles almost completely. The aroma is fruity like bananas and cherry. Very abbey-ish like any Tripel or Quad, etc.. Taste is fruity as well. A bit spicey the way the style often is.. basically its good but its not different or outstanding really.. its sort of typical, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It is very drinkable, the body is on the lighter side of moderate, which was surprising, considering the ABV."
"Pours a slightly opaque amber with more orange than red. Nice offwhite head with a good retention rate and moderate lacing. Big banana and clove aromas, very sweet aroma. Big strong and swwet banana and clove flavors. Big alcohol esters. Solid quad notes. Big alcohol burn on the mouthfeel. A little harsh at first, but it mellows somewhat. Maybe some aging would make this a little more drinkable."
"Date consumed: 7 July 2008"
"D: A winter sipper by the fireplace on a cold night. Alcohol is quit big at first but gets easier to manage deeper into the drink which makes this much more enjoyable as the night progresses."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a fancy beer glass. Doing so lead to some confusion as this is by far the lightest colored quad I've seen, so light in fact that I wasn't convinced this was a quadruple; until I tasted it. Fantastic. It slowly covers the palet with a sweet and smooth taste. All the traditional quad/belgian tastes are there as well. This one comes recomended by me."
"6/4/6/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with mild carbonation. There is a lightly-sticky, vinous syrupiness that lingers in my mouth, but I suspect that to be my own personal drooling over another succulent, savory sip of this delectable brew. As it is so very evil-big on the ABV, by convention QUAD shouldn't be so drinkable. But, hey... Fuck convention!"
"D: This is a pretty good imitation of a Belgian quadrupel. A solid piece of brewing."
"A good sample of the style but probably wouldn't have more than one or two, if nothing else but the price. Good representation of the style but by no means the best quad I'v ever had. I would definately reccomend to a friend and as for me, I love this addition to the Weyerbacher family."
"Overall - A decent example of the style although nowhere near as complex as I expected. The flavors kind of muddled together much like the aroma. I probably won't get this again especially because of the $3 price tag. For a little more I would rather get Avery's The Reverend or a KoningsHoeven Quadruppel. It had nothing really special going for it except the drinkability, which is surprisingly good for such a big beer."
"Bought the four pack of this Weyerbacher brand. Great look of clear, medium dark amber with a thin head and patchy lacing. Really shiny. Strong alcohol, mixed with some fruity aspects were excellently permeating from this drink. A somewhat sweet, alcohol flavor was the dominant taste I could sense, along with a woody, flowery hint mixed in. Very silky and smooth, excellent for the heavy alcohol flavor. Overall, excellent."
"Now you could probably drink 2-4 of these, but i wouldnt recommend it it"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with a half inch off white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. It smells like plums, bananas, raisins, cloves, candy sugar and rum. It's a fruity and boozy aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma. It tastes like plums, bananas, grapes, rum, raisins, and cloves. Not quite what I was expecting from this beer, but it's not bad. Maybe this needs aged longer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and has decent carbonation. Drinkability is good, but it's definitely a sipping beer. As far as quads go, this isn't my favorite. But overall it's not a bad beer at all. I'll have to revisit this once my other bottled have aged some."
"Pours a dark brownish-ruby red color with a thin off-white foam head that quickly fades. Pleasant aroma of dark fruit, candi sugar and alcohol. Surprisingly quaffable considering the very high ABV with a nice dark fruit presence and maltiness balancing out the sweet, strong alcohol presence."
" I'm used to beers on the session level, so the 12.2% ABV is just a wee bit too much for me. Nevertheless, this is wondefully complex and worth slipping slowly. Any faster than that, and the name will hold true to form, as it will make you realize that your quad's are no longer able to support ya and sitting down becomes the only option. I'm almost thinking of this as a ""dubble squared"" in more ways than one!"
"Picked this up at Green's on Ponce. Since Weyerbacher is still relatively new to Georgia, I am pretty unfamiliar with their offerings. Color is a copper, orangeish color. Not what I was expecting for a Quad. Smell is... cloves, and bananas? Weird. Tastes like banana and cloves. Alcohol is well-masked. Not what I was expecting. Moderate carbonation - no lacing. Tough to drink because of the taste. Way too much banana and cloves. I was expecting more of a Belgian yeast, brown sugar-type taste and was greeted with bananas. Not my cup of tea."
"This is quite a boozy beer. It reminds me of banana liquer. I feel like I should be dinking this beer slightly chilled or maybe even warm to get the full grap of how tropical it really is. I could see myself drinking this with a sweet bread like... I don't know... banana bread! Usually I'd rather not drink something this one dimensional, but I REALLY like this beer. Keep me to just one a night though. I'd rather not wake up in the streets naked with my banana schnapps and banana bread."
"Weyerbacher Quad came in bottles with some nicely decorated labels with the the letters Q-U-A-D in a square pattern. Of course these bottles were packaged in a four pack. The beer was poured into a St. Bernardus goblet, and it looked a lot paler and bit too clear, when compared to that standard bearer that once occupied the serving glass. The head atop was small and faded to a small rim around the edges, but somehow the lacing was still pretty solid. The smell was authentic for the style with boozy, spicy, and heavily fruity overtones. The taste was banana, raisin, and fig like in its sweetness and had added flavor due to a lot of spiciness evident with each sip. The alcohol was obvious, but not obnoxious. The mouthfeel was not as caressing as I would have liked, but it was quite full, sticky, and satisfying. The aftertaste was spicy white pepper and orange peel flavors lingering on. A nice take on the style, and I'd obviously like to take up the makers on their word that this ages well."
"This is one of Weyerbacher's better 12 oz. bottles. Not the best Quad on the market, but it's still a decent one. If you love the taste of alcohol and sweet yeast, then you should really pick up this Quad."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Good beer with what I thought was a lot more cherry-presence than most high-end Belgian quads. Very strong but masked fairly well. A lot of fruity tastes including the predominant aforementioned cherry. Worth having,, but nowhere near as good as some of the others in the style."
"Overall, this one is kind of ruined by all the booziness, so I will stick to some other Quads for now."
"Notes - It's too bad, because I really like quads, and this isn't one. When I think of Westy 12, St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 10, they have certain characteristics and similarities that are 180° from where this ""Quad"" is. And unfortunately I don't really like Tripels. This beer is more like a ""double Tripel"" - larger in alcohol and OG/FG, but in the same vein as a tripel - light in color, intense belgian yeast flavor, not malt complexity dominated."
"Pours a golden raisin color with a slight creamy khaki head. Apropos of the appearance, the scent has a fair bit of raisin, a bit of molasses, fig and bourbon. The initial taste is fairly boozy, followed by full on fruit - with cherries and raisins in the foreground. Prune plum and caramel in there as well. Finishes with a notable bitterness to the hops and alcohol, fuseal in flavor but not burning - this tastes between a quad and barleywine. The low carbonation and relatively thick body backs up the impression of this as a hybrid beer - has none of the prickle I look for from quads. I'm beginning to wonder if I didn't pick up an older bottle, as oxidation may be contributing. An interesting sipper, but not what I'd expected at all. Not off, per se, but seems an odd style melange."
"As usual for Weyerbacher, I find this slightly odd, a little out of character for the style, & f-ing good to drink. If I could get Surly & Tyranena there, I think I might move to Pennsylvania."
"bottle poured into a trappist glass has an orange amber color and a thin off white head that fell quickly and had virtually no lace. aroma has spices, banana yeast, candy sugar, dark dried fruit, and alcohol. mouth feel is medium with some thickness and low carbonation. flavor has thick malt with sweetness, dark dried fruit, light orange peel, plenty of spices, and mellow banana yeast that gets lost. alcohol is definitely noticeable and at times becomes boozy. finish has some bitterness and an odd flavor at the sides of the tongue. spices are a tad high for me and the booze just crushes the taste buds."
"An average quadruple. Don't go out of your way to get some, but try it if you see it."
"The feel is bubbly with a burn on the way down. Warms the belly. Thick like apple juice. This one's a choker; thick and bursting with alcohol. One and done."
"Drinkability: Unreal malty warmth finish. Minute plus linger. Not a Belgian classic, but all right for the guys from the land of the Crayola Factory. I'm enjoying this more and more as the glass is emptying."
"Served in a Saint Bernardus chalice, with a nice brown color and a thick tan head. Nice fruity aroma, a little bit like raisins. Taste was very pleasant. A little sweeter than I expected for a Quadrupel, but a nicely crafted mix of malt, figs, and Belgian style yeast. Highly drinkable; I had no idea about the ABV until I actually started to write the review! One to add to my must have list."
"Certainly not bad, but it is quite simplistic in character despite having some nice aged sherry / port notes thrown in. I would only guess that this was more bland when fresh (looking through my rating of Blasphemy, I predicted much the same thing about the base beer) and the sweetness was more than likely sticky and cloying then (which it thankfully is not here). It really could use some spicy fermentation derived character."
"This is one of those cases in which (because of the way the attributes are weighted) the final score will not be indicative of how I really feel about this big ale... and how much I enjoyed it. Flavor is king and Weyerbacher Quad is good beer."
"Poured a deep copper color with a hint of amber. Smallish off white head dissolves quickly down to absolutely nothing, and no head to speak of with even a vigorous swirl. I'll give it a slight break because noticed some washer spots on the glass after, which might have affected the appearance. Nose is crazy sweet malt and spices. Maybe a touch of wheat in there. Delicious, strong, but not super complex. Candy sweetness. Flavor is deep. Starts spicy and biting on the tongue. Moves into a deep, spicy caramel sweetness. A subtle sourness in the finish. Very mild hop characteristic, although a slight bitterness in the aftertaste and left on the tongue. Hints of alcohol throughout. Mostly tastes like candy. Body is highly carbonated (which goes nicely with the spiciness) and medium in terms of feel. Not a bad brew, by any means, but nothing really distinguishing it - if you're gonna get a quad, you may as well go all out and get something good, better than this one."
"There is way too much alcohol presence in this beer and nothing to offset the cloying sweetness either. This is not one i would pick up again."
"A simple but tasty beer. Unfortunately, quads shouldn't really be this simple. The aroma is of sweet fruity hard candy with a slight, but understand alcohol note. The flavor has the same sort of candy apple esters with subtle heavy toasted bread note and touch of phenolic spice. Still the drinkability here is impressive and it's not overly sweet. Worth a try if you're in the area."
"D-I enjoyed this very much and will drink again."
"D: Not too drinkable beer. Alcohol is a little too evident in the beer, which takes away from the overall experience during the session."
"Low carbonation, thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very apparent in this one, definitley a slow sipper and mo more than one at a time."
"A Belgian-style quadruple ale, this poured a muddy brown with no head. It smelled of prunes and molasses with some orange, and tasted much the same. It had descent bitterness and some alcohol warming in the aftertaste, making this definitely more of a sipping beer. The texture was thick with just a bit of carbonation. This was an interesting beer, much like a barleywine, but not one of my favorites overall."
"I wish this hadn't been one of the first Weyerbachers I've reviewed, because I love this brewery, but this is not one of their better efforts. Deep burgundy pour with a weak head. Intense brown sugar aromas, followed by lots of harsh, sweet/tart brown sugar notes in the flavor. I like it when alcohol makes its presense known, but this is not the gentle wafting sensation i want from alcohol, it's an assault. (And I'm a fan of beers with even higher ABV's.) There's some crabapple, berry, and a little caramel in the background, but if these were just brought forward to mitigate the harshness, this would be a better beer. I'm bringing three other Weyerbachers (all previously tried, and loved) back to the Midwest with me, and I'm sure I'll give them better reviews."
"Weyerbacher are the kings of over the top beers- and i like it."
"This is only the 2nd time I've had this brew.. I only know that because I have a 22 label in my collection. Despite the above negatives, this brew should always be on my wants.. if for no other reason, now I need a few to sit in the cellar and enjoy every year or two... I just think I may have had this brew too soon."
"Drinkability - Definitely a sipper that will warm you up. Not as good as a Trappist Quad, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to enjoy this one. Worth a try."
"12 oz single bottle copped from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... Some time ago, sampled Weyerbacher's Heresy, which is their Quad aged in oak barrels... Amber and copper appearance with a gigantic foamy and frothy head with some visible carbonation... Smell was replete with sweet, honey sugars and vanilla... taste was very alcoholic, and the hefty 12.2% ABV really flexes its muscle and makes itself known... taste dominated by esters, phenols, caramel, honey, candied sugars, and slight vanilla... Mouthfeel was about average, but drinkability wasn't good at all, due to the very noticeable alcohol essence, which burned the throat and nose... Even though there was a very nice appearance, there are much better Quadrupels out there... this one was a bit over the top - wouldn't recommend this..."
"The taste is where you really get kicked in the ass. Lots of alcohol (in a warming sense), fruits, spices, caramel and yeast. This ones a sipper."
"Seems to have more Barleywine characteristics as opposed to a Belgian Quad. Tasty nevertheless."
"Taste is a bit more spicy than I had anticipated, but was a welcome treat. The malt melds pretty well with the spice and the fruitiness. There is some alcohol warming sensations in the mouth and the belly, this one packs a good punch."
"Extremely warming alcohol but not overtly boozy. Warming from my ears to the bottom of my guts. Sort of thin on the mouthfeel. I dont know how I am going to finish this 22oz bottle. It may take me two hours or so. Borders on cloying. I think there are much better Quads out there."
"D- This beer has a thin taste with not a lot of complexity or interest. The fusel alcohol and plastic note are a bit in the way and increase as the beer warms. I thought the banana qualities reminded me of Hefeweizens more that quads."
"Overall this was not bad, not my favorite quad by any strech but still decent and better then most. It was a little overpowering until the alcohol mellowed a little, then it started to improve, but overall not bad and something I would try again."
"A great beer to drink on a snowy afternoon in WV."
"Medium bodied, carbonation is OK. I will not be seeking this beer out again."
"Meant to be a sipper, it drinks quite easy. A solid quad overall, and much better than some ""authentic"" samples from Belgium. This beer ages quite well, but is still approachable when fresh."
"Drinkability- Overall a good quad. I've had better, but I would go back to this one again."
"d: This is a very good example of an American quad, but the Belgians still do it far better."
"Poured into a chalice a slight hazy dark amber color, nice carbonation, little fizzy tan head, basically only a few oil slicks in the center. The nose is malty, bananas, spices, and some caramel. The taste is malty, nice sweetness, spicey, and a touch of caramel. The alcohol is present, but not that bad. Definitely a warmer at 12% ABV. Full body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, a little hot, but still nice, recommended."
"What I was moste impressed with was (a) the mouthfeel. Incredible creamy and rich, and (b) It completely masks the alcohol. I didn't know that I was drink a beer with 12.20% abv."
"A good beer for Weyerbacher, which puts out fine brews, but I would probably stay away from this one unless its being shared (22 oz. too much for one sitting) or enjoyed with some strong foods."
"This beer is not as bad as my score might make it seem. It is good, just not very good at being a quadrupel. It is off on almost every detail--too much yeast fruitiness, not enough malt, not enough body, too much carbonation, no head retention or lacing. The mistakes are small but many ad though it is enjoyable, it definitely doesnt stack up to the better examples of the style."
"Drinkability is great for a beer this strong. I actually want another but at 11% that may not be the best way to enjoy this brew. The aroma on this was so intriguing and alluring that I really don't think that it could live up to my expectations after that point. The flavors of this beer really evolve as it warms. Just because I really liked this beer doesn't mean you will but I'd recommend at least giving it a try."
"Poured a hazy ruby amber with a decent but diminishing head. The aroma was a strong blend of fruits and alcohol. The taste is a complex blend of sweet fruits, molasses and caramel, with ever-present alcohol. The beer is heavy bodied and a sipper for sure. This is an enjoyable one, but not quite as good as Blasphemy"
"Drank well for the ABV. This just need some more malt guts to round this out. Great value for $ at $5 22oz bomber!"
"Overall- Surprisingly smooth, yet sweet. A nice night cap beer. This 1 packs a punch."
"This one misses the mark - It's an attempt that just doesn't cut it for me. Too much, but not enough in the right direction. Put this against a classic Belgian Quad and it will disappoint."
"M/D - Good mouthfeel, easy to drink, especially at this ABV. Very Niice."
"D - decent brew, better if you like sweeter quads, less so if you prefer the classic belgian examples."
"Drinkability comes down slightly from the other scores because it's obviously a fairly demanding beer in several departments. Otherwise it's top-notch. Don't know why it took me so long to try it, since Weyerbacher is a favorite, and I love quads/Belgians. Will stock up next time I see it."
"I wonder if this beer would get any better in the cellar.Weyerbacher should have cellared it a bit longer if they wanted to compete with the american quad genre.Its just too strong.Not one of my favorite beers from Weyerbacher.Im starting to buzz off of one goblet full.It may just be that I havnt drank for a month.My 2nd glass of this stuff taste better then the first,not as astringent but still strong none the less."
"D: The abv is wicked high, I'll be lucky to get through this glass. The flavors are strong though and may change your perception of a quad."
"D - Sure, I could drink four or five of these in an evening ;-) That is, if I was an NFL linebacker with a metabolism like a blast furnace. Even at 12%+ ABV, this Quad is easy to drink, but two a/night max for me! I've got to work tomorrow."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and nearly thick. Definitely syrupy. It's too strong to session, but pretty drinkable for a beer this big. Overall, it's an pretty decent beer. Probably won't be a regular for me, but I'd drink it again."
"D  Good quad that falls a little short of some of the others Ive had. It still has big flavors and for the price, Ill drink it again."
"D- Though the taste wasn't bad the lingering alcohol made it hard to drink. Not a bad brew and definately worth a try."
"I really wanted to like this beer but I just couldn't make it work. Very little head, nice amber color, but not the kind of depth that you see in a Rochefort or Pennepot Fisherman's Ale. Very little head. Not too much aroma other than alcohol, perhaps a little caramel and dark fruit. Alchohol is way too prominent in the taste. A little malt and caramel kicks in, but then it goes back to the alcohol. Harsh flavor. It was a chore to finish this and I won't get it again."
"Maybe a year or so of cellaring would improve this one. It's ok now, but a bit edgy."
"I likely won't be having another."
"The taste is an improvement from the smell. The spice carries through and provides some complexity. Noticeable warmth from the alcohol. Full body with slightly low carbonation. Tastes of orange zest and corriander."
"Great brew this is."
"Weyerbacher Quad pours a crystal clear amber with a thick sticky head. Aroma is dry chalky yeast and some light fruitiness with a decent dose of alcohol. The taste is lots of ripe fruit, sweet and malty. There is an almost sour twinge to it but the overall sweetness of the beer balances it out. The beer is a little boozy, but at over 12% this is understandable. Overall a solid beer, and a steal at under $5 for the bomber."
"Well time to review this brew with Elvis Costello "" Shipbuilding "" on the Hi-Fi . This song I have not heard in a while . It is one of my favs from Mr. MacManus . As for this beer , lets say I will not be going to my "" beer monger "" to pull this out of the archives . When poured in my Rapscallion snifter there is no head on the muddy , caramel , brown fluid . The smell of sweetness , raisins and currants . The taste of this is not very good . Sweet and too boozy . There is no burn but there is just too much going on when it is in my mouth . When I taste the Rochefort 10 , I was in awe of the flavor and drinkability . It is fantastic . As for Quad , it is like too much sugar in my mouth . like Robitussin . Awful . Maybe if I tried this again with another BA journeyman - who knows his stuff and for what I should look for - this might be better . Even with it warming up , it was a bomb . Nearly my 2nd drain pour out to pleasant Dorchester Bay for the tuna that roam there ."
"Pours perfectly clear, with a jewel-like amber color with gold highlights and no head -- which is to be expected given the ABV. Aromas of banana esters, marshmallows and burnt sugar, along with some solvent alcohol. On the palate, very sweet initially, with loads of sugary fruits (something along the lines of dried, sugared pinapples) and alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is full of dextrins and raw alcohol, with pretty minimal carbonation. Overall, this is OK, but nothing special. There are much better quads out there, both American and Belgian."
"A 22oz bottle from Tully's poured into a tulip glass. Very pretty beer. Amber color with a small head that produced some lacing. It had a fruity, banana aroma. Taste a little more complex. Banana, but a fair amount of tartness came through. A little yeast also. Fairly assertive. I thought this was quite drinkable, even at the ABV of 12%. However, I made the mistake of trying this first, followed by Blasphemy. Don't do that."
"Drinkability - it's a lovely beverage and I would be tempted to have more of it, but not much more, given its strength."
"D- Not drinkable. I don't know... something must be wrong with this. I'll have to try it again sometime, I can't imagine this is what they normally taste like."
"220z bottle from Florian's. Amber-red hazy but translucent body with almost no head Smells like banana, nut, spice with a hint of alcohol. Tastes nutty, banana, and spice, with no alcohol flavor but a bit of alcohol warming. sticky thick mouthfeel that also lets on how much alcohol is in thie brew. Not quite like other examples of the style I've had, but really tasty an dpleasant, and more drinkable than expected."
"M&D - syrupy as i mentioned, so thick is implied, smooth as well, and rather easy down for such a thick and high abv beer. really tasty, one of the better quads i have ever had, well done, again, weyerbacher"
"A hefty, flavorful, and complex Belgian-style Quadrupel. Echoing other reviews: this one should be shared or enjoyed very slowly. A quality ale from Weyerbacher that is well worth a try."
"Drinkability: Not exactly the sort of thing you'd grab a sixer of and head into the garage. She's a sipper for sure, and the complexity of it leaves my palate tired after the glass."
"Notes: My first foray into the wonderful world of quads. I believe this has been in my cellar for at least a year. I've got another single sitting in the cellar, and I'm curious how it will age and how my expanding experience with quads will affect my opinion on this. I should note again for the record: the alcohol on this one really packs a punch. I need a nap now. G'night."
"Drinkability: This is a big beer and definitely deserved to sipped and appreciated."
"This quad looked great on the pour- a light cloudy amber with nice carbonation, but surprisingly little lace. Aromas dominated by estery fruits, nice and clean orchard flavors, bananas and definite boost from the belgian yeasts. Candi sugars dominate the taste, somewhat raw but not overly sweet. Alcohol and spice finish the brew- both come on very strong. The unmasked alcohol is this brews only detriment and the only way i was be able to tell that it wasnt Belgian in pedigree. Sticky, heavy finish that wasn't too dry and left me wanting more."
"D - Certainly a sipping beer due to the richness and the high alcohol content. But, be careful this one is deceiving in the booze dept. and can sneak up on you."
"Drink: Yeah, really nice for the size and good on the budget too so I'd definitely have a few of these and look for a few more later."
"Deep copper body topped by a moderate off-white head. Aroma is dominated by sweet caramel and fruit, but it's still ""clean"" with no funk detectable. Flavor is sweet, but not much else. A slight bitterness, but it's really kind of thin and one dimensional for such a huge beer. A bit of a saccharin-like sweetness hangs on my lips. The beer seems to get sweeter and warmer (heat) as I drink more. Goes down really easy though. I think this will be my sleep aid. I could drink a couple glasses pretty easily, and at 12.2% ABV, I don't think I'll be awake much longer after that. Impressive by it's drinkability and smoothness, if lacking in flavor."
"Good but not as complex as I would expect in a Quadrupel, or from other Belgians/Belgian-Style Ales I have had. Got this and a few others about a year ago from the brewery itself. I'll let the others age to see if more flavor develops."
"-Oelergud"
"From the 12 oz bottle: Poured a rust-colored brew, with a let-down of a watery body (at least visually), and an ultra thin head. Pretty tight little sugary aroma, almost reminiscent of grape juice. Wow ... despite its innocent allure, this packs a powerful little punch. Heady in its alcohol-laced sweetness, this warms your gullet like a little bit of lighter fluid on its way down. Grape, sourdough bread, and a bit of unripe pear. Very good. (#2670, 1/28/07)"
"Overall very drinkable flavor wise, not alcohol wise though since its over 11%. Would easily make it a favorite to replace wine anyway."
"Clear burnt orange with an off-white head. The foam was a little rocky, settled quickly, and left behind a bit of lace. Smells sweet with a little booze, light yeasty spices, a little banana. Sweet flavour up front, some fruitiness, then caramel and booze, some bready/biscuity malt. Dry finish with burnt malt notes. Medium/low carbonation, full bodied with alcohol warmth. I'm not sure what they're aiming for with this beer, but it didn't impress."
"Pours a clear copper, thin off white head forms, some lace spots, disappears quick. Smell is very boozy, fruity, toffee, some yeast, maybe a little banana, not too harsh. Taste is not bad, lots of fruit, estery, toffee, some yeast, nothing complex but not the liquor bomb I usually expect in Weyerbacher. This may be an old bottled. Mouthfeel is pretty slick, full bodied, nice carbonation, heat in the finish, lingering flavour, not too bad."
"This is my first Quad. To be fair, I will try others. It may just not be my style, I'm not sure. I just know that this was not enjoyable."
"D: Please. Somebody tell me - why do I waste my time with Weyerbacher? Always a disapointment. This one is surely drinkable but hardly worth the price tag."
"D - It's alright. Honestly, this is one of my favorite quads to date. It isn't as over-the-top offensive as most of the ones I've dealt with. It is very strong, but it is is a pleseant and surprisingly quaffable. Not really a session sort of beer, but it goes well by itself or with some choice foods. A nice beer. Due to the price, I doubt I will have this again soon, but I would like to."
"Poured into a chalice, it looks murky, orange brown with a very thin off-white head. The nose is mostly alcohol, with some raisin, prune, malt, sherry and rotten apple. The taste is dark fruit and sweet malt, with some stone fruit and sherry. Has an inky mouthfeel, thick but not viscous. A nice take on a big quad."
"notes weyerbacher the first micro to interpret this style not too bad for an american interpretation but i think ill let the belgians do the belgians"
"Overall, this one is still quite solid and a nice stab at the style and worth a shot."
"D - This is a good quality Quad, but it suffers from being a bit boring in the look and young in the taste. Definitely a candidate for further aging."
"The mouthfeel is chewy and sticky. Definitely a one at a time sipping beer."
"Body is big, almost too big for the powerfull and refined grace of a Quad. A slippery, chewy mouthfeel is improved by the gentle, big bubbles and chalky, fruity, semi-dry finish. There is but a whisper of the (wow) 12.20% abv. It takes skill to conceal all that alcohol with flavor. A job well done Dan and Co."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a non-existent head. Smell is not as complex as other Quads, but it still impressive. It has the sweetness of a Tripel, with the addition of the candied fruits that you would associate with a beer of this type. Almost like a quadruple for beginners. Should be a stop along the way to the big ones such as Bernardus and Westy, but really should not be considered a true tripel. I will give credit to this company for trying to make a quad, but it really doesnt hold a candle to the true Belgian ones."
"Drinkability: Taken slowly, a very drinkable beer. Fine flavor that is replete with complexity. Inhibiting, pleasing, and satisfying."
"Final Thought: Weyerbacher knows what they are doing, and this quad is remarkable!"
"Pours a darkish amber with a small tan head. The smell is alittle light with cloves, apple, yeast, and banana. The taste, like the smell, is full of fruit and is very strong with an alcohol flavor. The m/f is heavy with the flavors mixing OK, but not perfectly. Not a bad beer,but I would like to try one after I stored it for a year or so."
"it's big and bad, but actually not that complex (er...as quads go), although i must add that the 12.2% is nowhere to be found"
"D: Wow, this beer will mess you up x 4, seriously strong, but very tasty beer."
"D - Has some nice complexities there, but is quite off balance making it hard to enjoy. They need some more of the complex fruits to subdue the alcohol a bit."
"Good brew all in all, worth a try, but doesn't hold the tops in my Quad book."
"Very nice medium bodied, coating mouthfeel. 12.2% is definitely present but you know it really never stands out as being a burden, instead it's yet another characteristic to add to the complexity. Nice carbonation, quality stuff here."
"Pours dark reddish copper to murky brown, basically zero head just some effervescence. Smell is slightly tart green apples, lemon meringue pie, sweet malt, spiced breads, and alcohol at the end. Taste follows the smell with some nice tart fruit up front quickly followed by sweet biscuity-ness and malts with a clove, cinnamon and a little pepper spice, and finishes with a very nice warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some peppery tingle and a slightly dry alcohol finish. Very good beer overall, very complex aromas and flavors that all blended very well together, alcohol is also very well balaned for its strength. Highly drinkable."
"D: Too sweet for my tastes. Not balanced as well as traditional quads."
"Drinkability: Ridiculously drinkable beer that could easily fool with its balanced flavor. Enjoy one or six of these. Probably should be acknowledged that this isn't necessarily a quad in the style of Belgian Abt beers, but is nonetheless a remarkably well-crafted brown ale."
"Cheers to BeerBeing!"
"Hazy dark gold with some red. Little head despite strong pour. Aromas were malt, cotton candy, some citrus poking through. Taste was primarily malt, hints of coffee and grape?, some metallic note and pepper/heat from the alcohol. Mouthfeel was slick, carbonation felt minimal. Overall, felt a little rough, might benefit from some aging."
"All in all, an excellent brew. A great dessert offering with cheese and fruit."
"The high alcohol seems to only really affect the nose, not much in the mouth, yet because it is 12% hardly a session beer."
"This ones a new take on the style for me, but stunningly complex, intriguing and rather tasty. The mouth feel that reminds me of raw silk is a new one for me as well. As far as drinkability goes, this ones alcohol content comes through a little obviously. The next bottles going straight to the cellar."
"same notes and complexity in the flavor. medium-high carbonation with a heavy, thick mouthfeel; smell suggests it might be cloying but it's not at all. alcohol is very well-hidden. nicely complex and enjoyable."
"While not great, its certainly respectable and I give props to Weyerbacher for taking a stab at the style."
"I dearly love a good quadruple and this is a good one. I bought a six pack and drank several over a period of months before writing this review. Pours a clear amber with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is sweet malt, at this point no alcohol in the aroma though i remember some when it was fresh. Candy sugar and dried fruit as well. Taste is sharp like a dry white wine??? Sweetness is there but fades to a lingering dry-hop finish. Some candy sugar, some dried fruit? Despite the gravity this is a medium bodied brew. A drinkable if somewhat potent brew."
"Definately a bargain for the style at $12 for a 6 pack. A twelve ounce bottle could serve one for quite some time."
"Taste is potent as well. Slightly alcoholic, not too overwhelming though. Lots of dark fruits. Definitely more candiedness. A good sort of bitter, barely there hoppyness and breadyness balance out the sweetness, making this more than a dessert beer or nightcap. Mouthfeel is slick and this beer goes down easy. Very sneaky... alcohol is warming, but you still forget it's so high. A very drinkable brew, tasty and deceptive."
"Although the flavor was off, it was drinkable even considering the ABV."
"Weyerbacher's website recommends allowing to age, and I'm fairly tempted to buy a 6-pack and store it in my basement cellar. Highly recommended."
"All in all, not my favorite. I'm a fan of many Weyerbacher brews, so this one was a dissapointment. For Quads I'll stick with St. Bernardus Abt. 12 or Rochefort 10 as the benchmarks of how one should taste."
"Cheers!"
"A study of balance. Great complexity and interesting layers of flavor and aroma. Some may find the malt to be a bit on the heavy-handed side, but I find the ale to be well-balanced overall. Then again, I do love malt. The mouthfeel is extraordinary: soft and full, but not overbearing. This ale fills the mouth and mind."
"Copper orange colored body, hazy, visible carbonation. Head is big, but fades fast into a thin film of tan foam. Taste is rather one dimmensional, really. Mellow toffee sweetness and raisins kind of dominate this beer, with a little pineapple and apple in the aftertaste. I can't call this beer bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it lacks the finish and complexity of a top notch example of the style."
"Not the delight I was expecting and this beer seems out of balance to my tastes. I'm a fan of many barleywines and Belgians, but I'm not sure where this one is going."
"This is my second time having the Quad by Wyerbacher. The first time it was a year old and at the beginning of my beer tasting career. Now with alittle more experience im trying it again. I really enjoyed the first one i had. I can't really say i enjoyed this one though, but i can say that it has lots of potential. Starts with a pour into a snifter, with a decent head, and a minimal amount of lacing. The color is tha of a hazy copper with some light redish golden highlights. The smell had some raison, plum, and alot of young alcohol. The taste was more of the same and still there is too much going on in there. I expected the bere to be alittle more full bodied, but it was very light on the tongue. It had a lot of coating due to the alcohol which seamed to seep the pores of my mouth with a slight twang of tart at the very end. I dont think i could handle more than one of these at a time right now. There is too much alcohol presence in ther to make this beer enjoyable. Im rating this a 4.0 on taste for its potential. I say buy a 6'er, let it age, then try it."
"Undated bottle 12 oz, labeled Vintage '04 from Shawan liquors, poured into a Duvel tulip. Pours a dull red tinged copper with a huge cream colored head, very nice retention, small amount of scattered lacing. Nose is rather fruity--pear, plum, berries, red apple--some candied sugar sweetness and a definite walnut nuttiness, along with an alcoholic edge. Taste is very good, the sweetness in the nose comes through light and delicately rather than cloying, nice complex alcohol-laced fruitiness, a slightly woody/nutty malt, a flavorfully spicey finish, everything comes together nicely. The alcohol is definitely evident, but it melds with the flavors excellently, tasting like rum-soaked fruit, and for it's abv this is extremely drinkable."
"Poured a slightly cloudy orange-copper color with a mild level of carbonation and a soft, white colored head that left behind some lacing. Aromas of Belgian candy, alcohol, ripe grapes, dried plums, and burnt honey. The taste essentially followed the scents with a strong fruity finish. It was the intensity of the fruit flavors at the tale end of each sip that caused me to deduct points for taste; it seemed a bit out of proportion in relation to the various other flavors. The candy and honey flavors really added a nice sweet touch to this Quadrupel and made it unique in that is created a flush of sweetness all over my tongue in the first few sips without blowing out my taste buds. The drinkability is high with this beer because it is so flavorful and enjoyable and the alcohol just doesn't explode like you might expect considering it's over 12% ABV"
"Incredibly drinkable for it's abv."
"12 oz., bottle-conditioned with no freshness date. It pours an unfiltered ruby/brown with decent amount of carbonation beads and a half inch of tan head that leaves some lacing. It smells fruity (banana, pear?), with some sweetness and maybe some bubblegum. It tastes of peppery/spicy phenols, fruits (apple?, melon?), sweetness, and powdery yeast. The body is thick and full with medium carbonation and the alcohol is almost undetectable. It's not terribly complex, but it's pretty good and I would like to see what aging would to do it."
"Drinkability: Reasonably interesting; not the best Quad, but the best Weyerbacher I have tasted (Note: This was reviewed before Weyerbacher stepped up its game - I would no longer make this comment though it was applicable at the time)"
"a big thanks goes to kramer17801 for this. from the bottle. poured a a dark amber to brown with a med sized off white head that did leave any lacing. aoma the alcohol comes right out there as I was pouring this into the glass, dark fruits, raisins, malt, caramel, a nice sweetness. flavor, the dark fruits came out before I got the alcohol burn, than malts, sweet. a very good beer"
"-Cheers2Beers-"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep amber/copper color ale with a medium dark foamy head with pretty good retention. Aroma of rich sweet malt with gigs and dry raisins. Taste is a bit sweeter then expected with lots of figs and raisins with a nice shot of brown sugar. Body is quite thick with low carbonation. Very interesting (and different) take on the style."
" The taste is sweet at first, with some fruitiness. Then the rum like alcohol rears its head. This is a sweet, malty beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, and lightly carbonated. I have enjoyed this one more than the first time I had this. But I will not drink my other samples for several months. The sweetness reveals the youth of this beer."
"Pours amber in color with a pinkish tint to it. Thin head that fades to a lacy film quickly. The film sticks around for the entire beer. Strong alcohol smell with a rumlike quality to it. Taste is very sweet and rich. Alcohol has a strong presence in the taste too. Mouthfeel is very full but astringent due to the high alcohol. This is a real sipper that grows on you. It warms your belly as it goes down and goes straight to your head. I need to try a true belgium quad to have something to compare it to."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a little too ""up front"" for me. It's a pleasant sipper though. Nicely layered and complex. Good for a fall afternoon. Recommended for sure."
"Style-wise, this ale isn't as hefty as one may anticipate. It is good nonetheless. Especially on a cold autumn eve."
"Not sure what the price is (mucho gracias to blitheringidiot) but definitely a good domestic replacement."
"This beer does not stand well on its own. Too much of everything at once with nothing to hold it together. If they can tone it down, it would be much more enjoyable."
"Weyerbacher surprised me again. This tasted like a medicinal old ale. On the yucky side,,,"
"Notes: not the best of the style, but pretty good one"
"The beer looks a little flat and lifeless, but looks are deceiving in this case. The alcohol is distinct and forward in Quad, which is what you expect for a 12%+ beer, yet this one's reasonably drinkable. The alcohol is nicely balanced with the beer's flavors. The taste is malty, with hints of raspberrys and cherries, and surprisingly sweet. Very nice."
"This Quad poured a nice brown with tones of red. An off white head on top fades to a thin lace. Not much carbonation. Plums, prunes, and figs come to the nose. Notes of alcohol are present in the background, a bit of sweet aroma as well. Taste? Well there is a bunch of things going on. Plum and figs, malt, mild spice flavors then the final taste of the alcohol at the end. Not overpowering but noticeable. Smooth and creamy in the mouth and sticky on the lips and at 12% it will sneak up on you before you know it. An impressive beer"
"Drunkability  I checked, and this is technically the highest ABV of any Quad that Ive reviewed to date. The alcohol hides like an elephant behind a bamboo tree, but I personally enjoy the rough road less trodden and sucked this down like Courtney Love at a straw-testing center."
"The strength is there on this one.... but it doesn't deceive, you know it from the start. Yet it somehow works along with the fruit and dusty malt. It's a sipper for sure, but in that context it's quite nice. Enjoy this one by itself during some quiet time when you can fully appreciate it, whether it be with a good book (Dostoevsky or Shaw come to mind for me) or enjoying a long sunset of some late evening stargazing. Well done!"
"Pours a three-finger light tan head that slowly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet malty nose. Starts with a nice mix of malt and hops, some plum flavor and the ABV is in the background, finish is watery/metallic but not totally unpleasant. Bought over one year ago . . . $2.65 for a 12oz bottle from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, VA."
"taste was a nice spice hit up front that finishes with bread and sweet caramel like malts. its medium to full bodied, slightly sticky yet smooth. The alcohol warms the throat but all in all is hidden quite well. this one will definitely sneak up on you"
"As soon as you pop the cap, the alcohol grabs you right away. This is a serious quad and has some Belgian characteristics, like color, but I think these guys wanted to push the envelope on the ABV. Scaling that back, might increase drinkability scores. Go ahead and drink a couple of these and you're done for the night. Nose is ok and I can pick up some plum and fig in the taste...but damn...the alcohol!!! Whew!!!"
"As I was drinking this beer, I was like,, like, like, well you know know, this is some strong shit. Great beer."
"Aftertaste: Mildly alcoholic, tacky mouthfeel, remains sweet and malty. Accompanys a slightly tart dryness. Not an overyly complex beer, but still a lot going on. It's a good bang for its buck."
"This beer pours a murky brown color with very little head that disappears quickly and doesn't leave any lacing. The aroma has some slight fruitiness (raisins), but also has a very strong alcohol smell. The flavor is sweet with a lot of raisin-flavors, but the alcohol is very upfront. The carbonation is minimal and this doesn't help the thin mouthfeel. I had a hard time finishing this one. Not enjoyable."
"From a 12 ounce bottle, this brew pours a very clear, brownish-amber color. The aroma is a mix of fruit and alcohol, with a yeast-like background. Theres a little doughy-breadiness mixed in there as well. The fruit smells are predominantly banana and plum. The taste is fairly harshthis one doesnt hide its alcohol at all. I appreciate and enjoy strong beers, but this one doesnt frame its alcohol well at all. The ethanol just sort of sits out there on its own. The taste also has a bit of malt in the front, a little spice and vanilla, and a continuation of the fruit in the aroma. Finish is prolonged, peppery, and very warming. This brew is okay. I dont think Id say its much better than that."
"Drinkability: While I wouldnt say this is the best Weyerbacher product out there, it is certainly worth trying once or twice. Overall, I find it to be an enjoyable American attempt at a Quadrupel. The price is not terrible, although it can be difficult to find. Give it a shot if you feel like experimenting."
"Thanks to Higravity for the sample!"
"Poured into a snifter. Ruddy brown or more brownish red. No head, little carbonation looks like watered down rum and coke or a dark bourbon. Nose is isopropyl and cherries, like a fruit cup in a hospital. Taste is overtly alcohol with some malts trying desperately to be tasted. I bet this ages wonderfully. Mouthfeel had a surprising amount of carbonation, but was still a little thin. This beer isn't unpleasant. At 12.2% it is still drinkable. It is also incredibly inexpensive for a big beer. I paid a $1.79 for my 12 oz single. I might store a few and see."
"Thanks Chris. Ths beer pours a slightly oranged brown color with a finger of head that falls to next to nothing over the beer. The nose is fruity...raisins and pressed apples with a caramel sweetness dancing behind it all. Not relaly what I was expecting. I want more dark fruits...figs and the such. The flavor is a little closer to the mark, but still a bit off. It starts with a caramel covered raison with a very slight roasted character and finished metallic and cidery. Hmmm. Ehh. Not all that great. The feel is moderate to thick..more on the thick side, with a moderate carbonation. Too much carbonation for me. This is not my favorite brew. The alcohol is not really present, keeping it drinkable. That cidery apple character really does not jive with the style in my book. Just an average brew."
"Poured a nice amber color with hints of ruby floating throughout and a slightly off white head that fell to a ring around my new tulip glass. The smell is sweet with malts, dark fruits, and alcohol. The taste is of plums, dry cherries, and the alcohol once again. The mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth for the high alcohol content, and nicely carbonated. Overall, I would say this is a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability and Overall: Average. Kinda dissapointing. You just can't beat the Belgians. Beer is what they do best."
"This is, well Im not sure. The best way I found to describe this beer was that it tasted like someone who only brews barleywines tried to make a trappist clone. It just big and caramel malty with hints of phenols and candy sugar, but in a bad way. This beer improves ten fold as it warms, but the odd intermix of flavors gets a thumbs down from me."
"Pouring from a bottle into a tulip glass, it pours a lovely amber color with some extra ruby highlights throught. A bit of head lays on top, but quickly fizzles to a slight edge layer and some slight edge lacing on the glass. Slight hops are backed by some sour plums and hints of vanilla. Lots of alcohol on the nose as well, and this kills some of the aromas I believe, but I always enjoy the alcohol smell that makes my nose tingle just a bit. Taking a sip, some spice comes out (cinnamon) along with some plum flavors. Some vanilla sweetness comes out, but lots of alcohol burn through the flavors. It even has some dryness to it on the finish that reminds me of oak barrels a little. The feel is big time alcohol...all 12% are represented in the feel of this one. Big time body on it and it leaves some nice warming. The carbonation is well balanced, but the alcohol does most of the stinging! Overall, I love this brew, and I could TRY to drink another or two, but something tells me I should use better judgement before cracking another."
"This brew is a deep amber color with a medium off-white head. Thick sheets of lacing at the top of the glass that diminish gradually. The aroma is interesting: Spice, sweet malt and burnt wood. Medium-bodied with a rich fruity flavor. Earthy malts, spices and alcohol become more pronounced as it warms. Mouthfeel is excellent. The finish is spicy with hints of dark fruit and hops. Doesnt hold a candle to Westy or Rochefort but a very good Belgian in its own right."
"It gave a good head that left quickly a red brown color. It had a candy nose laced with dried fruit and malty sweetness. These smells transfered through in the taste but it had a small bite that was something I couldn't figure. I think in another 5-6 months this will round out and I will revisit it then."
"A great surprise! To be honest, I have a hard time believing that this is 12.2%. If it truly is, it hides it AMAZINGLY well. This one is a beauty. Drink at room temperature of course."
"Its much more drinkable as its aged than when its ""new"" because it mellowed. If it wasn't for the alcohol content, I think I could easily drink 3 or 4 of them in a sitting without a problem."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability  the dry end lends to running for another sip; sturdy body; somewhat syrupy; smooth but this one needs to sit for a year or two to get its sea legs"
"tasting brought my opinion of weyerbacher back up after the tragic merry monks. has enough density and malt to be a quad, but has the back end bite and complex sweetness of an am. barleywine. these probably should spend 6 months in the cellar, but still dangerously drinkable and the sixer will be gone soon."
"Comments: Though I want to like them, I just don't think I'll ever enjoy Weyerbacher's Belgian styles. Saying nothing about the matter of balance, something about the yeast strain simply doesn't agree with me. Like Merry Monks, this is what I imagine prison hooch tastes like; rotten bananas and alcohol gone wild."
"My favorite style - so I tried it. Ridiculously high alcohol, but it didn't taste that high. Very sweet and creamy but taste felt weak. Fizzy carbonation also contributed to Dry acidic aftertaste Medium mouthfeel. Below average for that I have tried in this style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the viscous, light copper brew. Head lasts well, and lacing is good for the style. Aroma is spicy malts, with a tinge of alcohol, as expected. Taste is similar to the nose, with somewhat spicy Belgianish malts giving way to a warming, not harsh, alcohol presence. The Beast, this is not. Mouthfeel and drinkability both good for the style. Give it a try."
"In spite of that, and in spite of the high ABV, this one is VERY deceptive. I could down three of these and be blotto without trying hard."
"This poured out an opaque brown color with a slightly red hue. A tall head of beige foam formed a top the body and rose from the glass. As the head drops down to a bubbly cap sticky rings of lace are left to decorate the glass. Smells of sweet dark ripe fruit rose from the glass with a bit of spicy caramel covered malt mixing in as. A slight smell of alcohol creeps in as this warms but it only adds to the experience. Fruit hits the palette first with a light spicy sweetness that is met with a caramel flavor. There was a good bit of spice in this as well that also was present in the bitter lingering after taste. Very complex flavor with only the slightest hint of the huge alcohol on the aftertaste. The body felt a little thinner than most quads but was creamy and pleasing. Drinkability is good with no negative alcohol presence and a very complex flavor. I will be picking up a few more of these next time I see them and recommend you try this if you havent."
"My thanks go out to blitheringidiot for the trade and the chance to try this tasty beer."
"Pours a medium chestnut brown with a small light beige head that diddipates quickly. Strong fruity esters, marshmallow, fusel alcohols, and very sweet caramel-like malt in the nose. Carbonation seems rather high, it's hard to pick up any flavors other than alcohol because of the spritzy carbonation. I'm going to let it stand and warm for a while and come back to it... Candied fruits, big malt, caramel and toffee, nut-skin like astringency in the finish as well as warming alcohol. Sticky and cloying at times, the flipside of the coin is that the high ABV is pretty well hidden under multiple layers of flavors. It's certainly better in the warmer stages. I shouldn't have left it in the refrigerator so long. There's a lot of flavors going on in this beer, and one flavor doesn't particularly stand out amongst the others, except maybe some caramelized sugar."
"12 ounce bottle."
"A balanced and solid quadrupel, if you could delineate the characteristics of such a style. Very nice to quaff. Simple but effective."
"This beer pairs up nicely with port wine cheese."
"The finish is fruity, dry and grainy. Overall, the quad is pretty easy to drink and quite tasty, even if it's not as hugely complex as I'd like."
"Overall: Simply exceptional. This year is excellent for this beer."
"Has a somewhat medicinal quality to it, but tastes leaps and bounds better than it smells. Flavors consist of anise, cherry (strong), and alcohol."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately, I could not have many more of these as the alcohol only grows stronger as the beer warms. Not bad to try, and it's commendable for a US brewery to try a quadruple, but nowhere close to being in the same league as the Belgians."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an intense malty aroma which smells really powerful. It has a nice crystal malt arrangement along with a fruity Belgian style finish. The taste is good. It has a rich malty flavor that warms on the finish, but goes down extremely smooth. The Belgian yeast only enhances the taste by mellowing the strong flavor with a nice fruity finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine quadrupel. It has great flavor and a smooth finish; a fine sessions brew."
"Murky, tawny-crimson in hue, brown influences too with a noticeable highlight of sunset gold, this does have a very attractive color. However the beige head struggled to reach a finger in height, then it quickly faded to a soapy collar. The subsequent lacing was minimal. The potency of the nose is massive; it is very bold with strong, warm alcohol notes upfront. Okay, who am I fooling? The alcohol is found throughout every sniff along with notes of plums, candied-sugar covered raisins, hints of chocolate and bubblegum, and bananas soaked in dark rum. I really like the bouquet, it is forceful and very blunt with the alcohol but the other aromas almost round out the bouquet; still I like it for some reason. Inviting. The palate starts off full-throttle burning alcohol heat. It is unrelenting. It took a few sips before it tired to a point where other flavors could emerge. This is very malty, very rich with notes of plums, raisins, figs, some rum spice, apples, bananas, and distant chocolate. Some of these flavors never play more than a distant supporting role; the plums and raisins do dominate the fruitiness department. A brown sugary sweetness grows with warmth. Oddly the warmer it became the thinner it seem, not only in mouthfeel but taste. The finish is alcohol heat, some pepper, sugar, and green apples. All in all, Quad is a decent beer, it seems a little heavy-handed at times but it is still quite flavorful but probably not as complex as many great Belgian Ales. Medium in body, low carbonation, especially for a beer of this ilk, I must say the low carbonation produces a soft creaminess on the tongue; I like that. This plenty drinkable, I rather liked it; I bet it would be even better after it matured for a few years. Nevertheless I would quaff this on occasion if I had the opportunity. I must say thanks to BIG746 for the BIF 3 delivery! I think this is worth trying at least once."
"The appearance was good, but not what I would expect in a Belgian style beer. Too clear in my opinion, where's the yeast? Personally I like my Belgian style quads and strong darks to be a murky brown. Also a serious lack of head and lace. I poured this almost strait into my goblet, and barely a bubble was raised. The smell was good, slight hint of banana mixed with solvent. Also hints of other fruits like dried raisons and figs. The taste was just slightly better than average. Sweet malts and dried fruits. Just as the smell, figs, raisons and some tropical fruitiness. Also a hint of earthy wooden flavors. I thought the alcohol was masked very well which at 12% is surprising. In fact, that may be the only thing this beer does in an exceptional manor. The mouthfeel compared to other beers of this style, was not quite as rich and pleasing. Not thin, but just not as creamy. Drinkability I rated higher though, being that the high abv is pretty well hidden. This beer is not bad, just not true enough to it's Belgian cousins. It lacks the over all character that the Belgians have. Too homogenized for my taste."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and flat, and the sweet malt lasted long on the tongue. Heavier bodied and almost no carbonation. This one is a little to sweet to rank any higher on the drinkability scale."
"Poured and amber color, with a strong white head. Good lacing for a quad. Very malty aroma with a a hint of fruitiness (grapes maybe?). Also some clove hints, like the Chimay Grande others have mentioned. This taste knock me away..and over with 12.2% abv. An excellent sipper beer from a great local brewery. I would recommend this to all fans of Belgian style ales. This one will not disappoint."
"Thanks to beerluvr for the sample."
"Cellared for a couple years. Turbid bister hue. Head recedes into a thin, dense cream white foam ring due to the alcohol content. Pungent wafts of candied walnut, bourbon soaked prune and banana esters upfront in aroma. Mellow hints of buttery toffee and minty ethanol. Well rounded and welcoming aromawise. Incipient in flavor is a coating, dark, singed caramel sweetness. Complexities arise promptly, with buttered pine nuts and grainy, sweet biscuit arising mid palate. Trace clove. Understated bubblegum ester undertone complements caramel tones. Paltry hop bitterness leaves ample residual sweetness. Ethanol presence augments as the beer breathes, lending a stately, maple sweetened hot toddy presence. Full bodied, with a dextrinous, viscous, but agreeably soft mouthfeel. Well calculated carbonation. Finishes quite clean, with lingering hints of sugary brittle. A tasty ""Quadrupel"" that's surprisingly understated in yeast derived character. Akin to a Belgian dubbel / English barleywine hybrid on steroids. Well hidden ethanol character. Excellent, at least when aged."
"This beer poured a medium red color and formed a small off white bubbyl head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and candy like bubblegum. A hint of the alcohol present is also in the background. A flavor of malt, with a sweetness of candy yet a hint of pine pointing to the heavy alcohol of this beer. The finish is sweet yet astrigent due to this as well. Not a bad beer, and tough to gauge since I have not tried many quads."
"That said, I would like to know when this was brewed, but Weyerbacher has no dating on the bottle. This seems young to me. I think in a year or two this will really kick ass."
"Beer is gud. Happpyy Beerrngi."
"And so, for all that's in it, for the positives it possesses, the whole just isn't as good as the sum of the parts. The components blend, but haltingly. It's pricey and potent, and the ABV puts the brakes on continued indulgence, because the flavor falls just short of inspiring in spite of the alcohol. So if you give me one, I'll drink it, but if I have to buy it myself, well, I'll likely spend my money elsewhere."
"This massive rendition is initially copper, clear with no trace of yeast and not much head, barely a ring. Aroma is extremely vinous full of brown sugar, candi sugar, brown rhum, sweet and alcoholic without having the complexities I expect in a beer of this magnitude. Can you say M-A-L-T-Y? Once again in mouth, the alcohol taste is quite strong with sweet raisins and white grapes. It really makes me think of a red wine without the dryness. Body is big and thick, but a little flat, I'd prefer a bit more carbonation personally. Good effort and I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more american brewers trying their hand at ABTs (way to go Allagash). But for sure, if I ever drink a weyerbacher quad again, I'll make sure it's a 3+ year old sample. Cheers to my good friend Hopsrus."
"This beer is very complex and I am sure I am missing stuff. FOr being 12.2% it is pretty easy to drink and I look forward to drinking the 2nd bottle in my fridge."
"Appearance: Dark chestnut amber brown hue with a nice sized fine bubbled creamy tan head, leaves behind even layers of thick patched lace. Aroma: Biscuit dough tones but very sweet candi sugar, dark candi sugar at that with a very fruity undertone of apples, raisins, and molasses needs some cellaring but does the trick. Taste: Flavor has some bready yeast, mild chocolate, layers of fruit but nothing comes together well alot of complexity no cohesion. Mouthfeel: A bit lighter bodied than expected rather light on carbonation but still very silky overall texture. Drinkability: A mediocre stab in the dark at an awesome tradition of brewing, but I am glad an American brewer stepped to the occasion of trying to emulate a quad."
"than again, perhaps Weyerbacher will be good in 10 years..."
"If my above notes are correct, then the bottle I sampled today (9-10-05) has been lovingly cellered for over 2 1/2 years! It has continued to mellow and get more soft and complex. It is now soft, smooth , mellow, lots of butter and port notes. Rum raisins and loads of other flavorful, sweet stuff. This beer has gone from the brash/harsh/alcohol burn stuff I recall it being when young to a soft and complex, world class after dinner sipper. Oh what 2 1/2 years in the closet/basement will do."
"Hazy brown/orange in color. Low carbonation, with little in the way of head. Though this might be an off-bottle, given the other reviews. Aroma is mostly malty, with hints of prune/raisin and a wee bit o' nuttiness. Nice rich, sweet really lovely flavor. More malt and dark fruit notes with a gently floral, lightly spiced hop finish. Aftertaste lingers with a ever-so-slightly burnt malt flavor. The bitterness of this beer comes out more as you move down the glass, but it's a very fruity bitterness -- almost mead-like, really. Aside from the lack of carbonation giving this a rather flat appearance and mouthfeel, it's really quite a nice beer."
"EXCELLENT! Pours an orangish brown hue with a lacey white head. Smells yeasty and spicy. Tastes very nice and smooth. Yeasty, malty, plumy, coariandery, very intense and very reminescent of St. Bernardus Abt 12. A very fine quality beer that most would enjoy."
"Tasty, but the flavor is mostly dominated by sugary caramel candi sweetness, and not much else. The alcohol provides some balance, and prevents it from stepping over the edge into cloying. I doubt i could drink more than 12 ounces of this stuff, because of the sweetness rather than the alcohol. Very intense."
"The beer is smooth, but I think they could do better to allow the beer to carbonate naturally, as it is quite bubbly for a higher gravity beer. It is one of the easiest to drink beers with alcohol greater than 10% ABV that I have ever tried. It doesn't hit you at all while you're sitting sipping it, but you will realize it once you get up and walk around."
"Update: As I continue to drink this, it will kick you in the ear. Fair Warning. Also looks like they are now distributing in Mass."
"Notes: Good beer. Weyerbacher's second best after the Raspberry Imperial Stout."
" I spent over an hour with this one trying to find some qualities I find attractive, other than its fine nose. I suppose it is a fine winter warmer, with the high abv, but the port wine aftertaste doesn't endear me very much."
"The aroma is yeast ripe ruit and alcohol. The taste is peppery from spice or alcohol or both. It's also got plums and cinnamon and and a whole lot of other stuff too. It's complex but really unsubtle and kind of boring. The mouthfeel is nice and sllick and numbs your tongue due to the alcohol. Drinkability is pretty good for such a monster and the alcohol is well hidden. Try it."
"Muddy auburn brown with no head. Has a strong sweet malt aroma with noticable alcohol and a slight fruit overtone. Extremely smooth body with an alcohol warming effect in the finish. Has a nice fruity malt flavor and again a very smooth brew. Not as good as the Belgians I've had, but overall a decent ale."
"Clear burgundy with a thin ring of head and active carbonation present. Spicy, dark fruit, green apples, faint alcohol and a distinctive yeast character comprise the nose. Initially, this beer tastes quite sweet with evident notes of apples, caramel malt, currants and pepper. The flavor profile expands as the beer opens up, garnering notes of cocoa and apricot with a subtle, warming alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately carbonated, though a touch thin and watery compared to the classics in this style category. Serve at room temperature to discover the variety of flavors this beer possesses. Lacks a true distinguishing character, but nonetheless a commendable domestic production of a quadrupel/abt."
"The body is pretty rich, but definitely not at the level I would expect from such a heavy beer. Alcohol is very noticable, but not in a bad way. Spiciness really comes out in the flavor especially in the finish. The sweet malts and fruits are there as well in tall order at the start of a swallow. Decent, but not up to par with a few others in the same ballpark. Definitely worth a shot."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sippin' beer. Get yourself a big ol' glass and a good chunk of time to enjoy this. I personally like malty, strong beers, so I'll probably be snagging a few bottles of this for the cellar, esp. at $2 a bottle."
"Man, weyerbacher really impressed me with its super high gravity offerings. The Quad poured a deep ruby hue with a barely off white head and without too much lace. The aroma had huge bananna, cloves and pear notes a little bit of fig and massive amounts of esters floating about. The taste was heavy raisin, syrup, sweet sticky malts, currants, molassas and plenty of alcohol. There was never too much carbonation and stuck with the creamy mouthfeel through and through. Drinkability, who knows. I couldn't recomend drinking two of these in a sitting as they are super strength, but by itself its a tasty way to enjoy a evening."
"Iechyd da"
"Overall: The alcohol is partially hidden, and its a sipper for sure. Oh, and it will kick you Arse, sorry Ass, for sure. Thanks to NeroFiddled for this Monster!"
"Bought a case of this without tasting it - on the description alone. This pours a dark brown-almost red with very little head. The alcohol is very prominent in both the aroma and the taste. As it warms in the goblet the taste deepens and the malt flavor complements the alcohol and it's warming effects. This beer is an overall enjoyable experience and seems to work well as an after dinner digestif or paired with food (worked great with aged provolone and sicilian olives)."
"This is not a bad ""replica"" of a Belgian dark ale. I have become more and more fond of Belgian and am starting to venture into that area of beer. I think I like the Belgians, because I am a real big fan of Scotch Ales, Imperials, and similar type brews. This is the first Belgian style that I have had, that was not from the ""motherland", but I was very suprised that a simple American brewery can make this stuff. I am also starting to open up to more and more microbrews from the US. I would say that this is like most other regular Belgians, but a little more carbonated and not as ""heavy"" tasteing. It's really not bad though and I will be back for more! Go USA!"
"thanks go out to Pintof Ale for providing the sample!"
"Thick malty yet hoppy Barleywine... smells and taste of cough medicine almost with as much kick.. the hops overpower all else as their is some fruit to it raisin, cherry, hard to tell with all the alcohol in this beer. Good to sip bad news at a festival which has been known to arrive especially in August. Better on tap than in the bottle and may need to age to mellow a bit."
"An enjoyable beer to sip and savor. Complicated and interesting. Not the sort of beer you'd want more than one of, though."
"If Merry Monks is a triple that should be a double, than Quad is a four bagger, and with a man or two on."
"I found this beer very raw and upfront. Lots of sweetness and quite yeasty (some cheesyness), some very raw peppery alcohol, quite sugary. Not very elegant or rounded or anything. A bit too sweet and raw for my tastes, with too much alcohol in the finish. Not a fan."
"Pours with just a hint of light tan head topping a lightly yeast-hazed garnet liquid. Nose is heavy on the dark fruits, malt hugeness and a good dash of Belgian candi sugar too. Taste is very alcoholic first and foremost, full and mouthcoating followed by sugary maltiness, then the hops, to dry things out some. The main player here is the massive alcohol presence. Finshes long, malty, with plummy/pruney notes on the palate, with more alcohol and hop sting to close things up. Not as balanced as this style should be, due to the huge amount of alcohol contained within. Don't smoke near this one! Still one Brute of a beer all the same though...beware it's mighty power!"
"This beer poured into the glass a mahogony wood/gold/ruby color that was somewhat cloudy in the first pour to opaque in the last pour. The head was creamy and beige in color and texture. It was a head that when first poured was there, but quickly deminished into nothing just a rim on the edges of the glass. There was lace noticable, some parts were sparce and hardly there, but other parts seemed to leave a sticky residue/lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were big - caramel, sweet malts, fruits (2 kinds - dark and fresh), wood and of course alcohol. The tastes were just as good and big - sweet malts, fruit soaked in alcohol (plums and raisins), floral hops, alcohol, roasted malts, and apples. A smooth and creamy beer that sneaks up on you. It starts off sweet then hits you with complex flavors and heats you up with the flame from the alcohol. It leaves a slight dry hop aftertaste but is shared with a sweetness to leave you with a well balanced feeling on your tongue. Again a nice and complex beer that surprised me. I have had good beers from this brewery and I can say atleast 1 great one....so far."
"This Belgian ""Quadrupel"" (?) poured a cloudy, dark amber brown color with thin white foam. The smell was fruity: pears, apples, bananas, and cloves. The taste was rich and sweet (candy sugar) and fruity (apples and pears) and malty. The mouthfeel was full bodied and smooth and creamy. This was a very nice strong ale, and it was wonderfully drinkable, though potent."
"Thanks for the Moonshine Davo."
"Well, I did let a few of these spend a year untouched. What a great thing to do. Dusty cherries emerged in the nose and a lot of the sweetness went away to reveal white pepper during the finish. The mouthfeel became creamier. Good stuff."
"A fine American version of the strong, dark Belgian stylenot cloying and not overpoweringly alcoholic."
"Another of those magnificent beers, not meant for the Light Beer crowd, and thankfully so. The 12.1 percent ABV is noticeable in the bitter dry aftertaste. Ah yes sports fans another of those Over the top bad boys that most people frown at, but I love! This one supplied to me by Venom, about a year ago, so this Behemoth has grown baby! WHEW what a kick in the Arse."
"Deep copper, almost ruby in appearance, with a tan head that fades to nothing. Smell is port-like, with plum, caramel, and unmistakable alcohol. Whoa! Taste is also port-like. Very strong alcohol, almost out of whack. Very sweet. Alcohol lingers long in the finish. I respect this brew, but I'll have to drink a few more before I decide whether I like it."
"Another wonderful one, VENOM!  Cheers!"
"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, amber/dark brown color, and has a small foamy, cardboard colored head. Slow carbonation, mouthfeel is fairly smooth. On the nose the aroma of raisins, plums, rum and alcohol. On the palate the flavors consisted of dark fruits, burnt sugers, raisins, plums, and alcohol This tastes much better when it is aged."
"The mouthfeel is incredible!!  The alcohol nose is almost too much - this beer is almost chewy and a keeper."
