Nose of Belgian candy sugars, strong alcohol, and some dark fruits.  Flavors are warming sweet candy sugars up front, rather hot really for the alcohol content, dark sweet cherries to the back, and a sweet aftertaste and coating finish.  A very nice quad from an American brewer.","Brutaltruth","Nov 20, 2014"

3.48,-11,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a dark brown fruity color with some nice ambering that reminds me of raisins. The head is very compact with nice little white cream head and some excellent carbonation running up the sides. Lacing is a dribbling sheet of white on the edges of the glass, leaving behind slight tendrils to suggest its passing. The beer smells sweet with dark candy sugars and dark fruit notes like raisin. The malt profile in the nose is sweet and the yeast is slightly souring and pear-like but nicely Belgian and definitely influenced by the trappist beers. There is a great syrupy sweet tinge to the nose which suggests a big sweet Belgian body. There is also a sweet alcohol smell lingering beneath everything else in the smell and suggesting the beerâ€™s 9%. The beer tastes wonderfully complex with an interesting splash of pear-like esters in the initial sip rounded with dark fruits and the sweet malt blanket that gives the beer a creamy feel. The pear flavor actually continues into the aftertaste after a slight lull and gives the mouth a slight pucker when mixed with the hops bitters at the end of the sip. The beer is a little cloying on the mouth with the sweets. The hops are surprisingly there in the flavor with a nice dry bittering in the mouth and some slight earthy spice in the middle of the taste. The mouth is left slightly wet on the sides with saliva after the beer has passed but the roof and tongue of the mouth are quite dry. Overall this is an interesting take on the quad style, but Iâ€™m not sure I like the bittering that they did to the style. I see what they were going for in and American interpretation of the quad, but I wasnâ€™t really blown away by the interpretation. Pretty Things is an awesome brewery, I love what they do but this one just didnâ€™t do it for me. The beer is an average quad overall.","Maxwell","Aug 29, 2012"

Pours a very dark ruddy brown amber with some dark floating particulates. One finger light tan head fades to a ring around the glass, leaving lacing. Dark Belgian aroma, dark and dried fruit, Belgian yeast, little bit of grape and brown sugar. Flavor follows with sweet dark fruit; plums and cherries, dried fruit; raisins and dates. Belgian yeast. Finishes somewhat dry, which is nice to offset the sweet start. A very pleasant take on a quadrupel, perhaps closer to a Berlgian dark, but tasty either way. A bit light in body and flavor for a quad with a medium body with light creaminess. I've yet to not fully enjoy a Pretty Things Ale. This was great.","LiquidAmber","Aug 07, 2012"

The liquid is a dusky brown base, shifts into orange and yellow hues nearer the glass sides, actually notable for the lack of chunks floating about and general cleanliness, not many bubbles visible but when you swirl the glass it foams up again rapidly. The nose is dry and lean but not lacking, grass, yeast and packed dirt appear first, yielding to honey, brown sugar, maple syrup and orange peel, even as apricot, fig, date fruit appears never seems sweet, not getting a lot of spice scents, stays properly mannered and focused. Medium-bodied, very creamy and gently carbonated mouth texture which helps in distracting from the dryness, mouth almost gets parched as the glass gets drained. Again, not for any lack of chocolate, molasses, maple syrup, toffee or licorice flavors, even some coffee hard candy notes in there. Touch of ginger, the citrus element diminished. Fig, golden raisin, yellow apple, apricot fruit stays measured. Minimal traces of clove or banana, some yeastiness.

The name quadruple to me is a bit bold, this is a beer which hides its alcohol well and comes off as a tripel or double. The beer is full bodied with a very delicate mouthfeel which blends amazingly with the dried plum flavor. Baby Tree won't blow you away with intense hoppy or yeasty flavors but to me is a well balanced and enjoyable fruity belgian that I could recommend to anyone.","BenHesk12","Apr 03, 2012"

However, the spices here are pretty excellent, tempering the sweetness in a good way, with clove and pepper being very nice. A little bit of dry, leafy hop bitterness is present on the finish. While medium in body, this beer has enough grainy bitterness and spices to cut the sweetness. Carbonation is moderate, and there isn't much I can complain about with this beer.

3.32,-15.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"The dried plums lend a pleasant fruity punch to the lightly spicy nose without overwhelming it. The plum flavor is pretty strong, but not overly sweet. The malt profile itself seems to be rather restrained in the sweetness department, too. Tasty, though, with a good balance of spicy, sweet and bitter qualities. Good 'beginner quad', perhaps. Goes down a lot easier than your average 9% brew. A hint of funk now and then has me wondering if there's brett in this stuff. Not terribly complex, but certainly worth a try.","PDXHops","Aug 24, 2011"

Mouthfeel is a bit on the light (watered down) side for a quad. Highly drinkable though.

I'd also say yes. However, it is a bit less drinkable because of it. The bitterness of the hops and the bitterness of the dark fruit skins combine, and then stick in the mouth. It almost finishes with a bit of a licorice note. But then again, I have to ask, is that such a bad thing? Style not taken into account, maybe not.

Drinkability on this offering from Pretty Things is better than I had expected, considering the style. Although it has a 9 % ABV and some big flavors to it, it can go down easily. Sip & enjoy.","mltobin","Sep 30, 2010"
3.3,-15.6,4,4,3,3,3,"Overall, a disappointment for me. Too bitter and hoppy for a quad and nowhere near the assertive sweetness I look for. Not a bad beer, but not a good example of the style.","Gosox8787","Sep 18, 2010"
3.05,-22,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Batch 4. Poured from bottle into Oerbier tulip. Pours a cloudy dark opaque brown, quarter inch head fades to sides with nice lacing. Not a lot in the smell. Some fruit, a decent amount of hops given the age, iron, and belgian yeast. Taste is also bitter, much more hoppy then i would guess for the style or age. Yeast flavor follows, some candy sugar and a bit of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and clean, but I would like a quad to be a bit heavier. None of the flavors really mesh up in this beer, every taste is fighting to be in front. I find myself begrudgingly going back to this, so based on flavor alone this has a low drinkability.","nkersten","Sep 08, 2010"

Surprisingly mild malt front with a spicy hop finish. Mild bitterness. No surprises though, and the plum flavor is hard to detect. Maybe some caramel in the middle. What makes this quad different is its overall lightness and delicate flavors. This is not a heavy quad; you could say this is a refreshing quad. Very easy going and not flashy, but satisfying.

I definitely smell the dried plumbs and other dark fruits. Other than that I can only smell a trace of alcohol and aromas that can only be explained as earthy. Sweet malts and the dried prunes take the forefront on the taste of this one. Warming spices such as cloves coat my pallet on this nice dry finish. Hints of vanilla.

Taste brings the dried fruit and sugar flavors to the front mellowing out to a nice herbal and spiced concoction. The breadyness hits right when the finnish becomes slightly alcoholic.

The aroma is quite faint; some barely noticable dark fruit notes and yeasty phenols but that is it. The taste is big on fruity sweetness with some cherry and grape juice flavors which transitions into a raspberry tartness. It has a light earthy characteristic but it is short lived in the fruity flavors. Seems to have more of a fresh fruit juice flavor over your typical boozy dark fruit flavors of most Quads/BSDAs. The feel is light and extremely fizzy, kind of burns the tongue; sweet on the finish. A decent Quad, seems to be lighter and more refreshing than others in the style.

3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark amber with ruby highlights, small white head, nice lacing and lasting cap. Aroma is full of dark fruits and malts, light chocolate, apple, and light plum. Taste is right on with the nose. The plum isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be but it's certainly tasty. Body is a tad lighter than I like in a quad, but again it's very tasty and definitely drinkable for the high ABV.","KeefD","Dec 09, 2009"

4,2.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a reddish brown color with a large tan head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Appetizing aroma of dark fruit, cloves, candied sugar, and malt. The flavor does not quite live up to the aroma. Has a dry, almost caustic component that brings the score down. Otherwise has nice Belgian qualities of a fruity and spicy Quad and slightly vinous. Not as sweet as most. Has a good body with nice carbonation that gives it a soft texture. One of the better American interpretations of the Quadrupel style. Worth a look if you see it in the store.","morimech","Nov 11, 2009"
3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"M/D - Medium bodied, a little on the thin side for what I expect from a Quad. Very spicy in the finish and it lingers in your mouth. Very easy drinking here. A good quad, not great, but certainly good.","ckeegan04","Nov 10, 2009"

The aroma is of plums, cloves, lots of spice, hints of bubblegum, and Belgian malt. This beer smells really good. The taste is much like the aroma. There is lots of spice, lots of malt, and enough fruit to balance things out. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really good quad that I will surely drink again.","KarlHungus","Nov 08, 2009"

The aroma profile is undeniably pretty sweet, with brown sugar and chocolate, coupled with some underlying prunes and cherry. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose pretty closely, but I was impressed by the amount of flavor and richness in this beer. I would describe the mouthfeel as no more then medium bodied, with a fairly long finish. Drinkability is OK, though you can tell the alcohol is up there a bit in this one, which coupled with the sweetness, makes drinking this beer rather slow going. Nevertheless, I thought this a very nice effort from this ""new to me"" brewery.","John_M","Sep 28, 2009"

3.37,-13.8,3.5,4,3,4,3,"Bomber from the first batch in April '09. Pours a very dark, cloudy brown with a small light beige head that doesn't really last. Smells of bready, fruity, and even tangy yeast; pretty reminiscent of Chimay PremiÃ¨re, actually. A wee bit of chocolate/roastiness. Sweet overall. The taste has all of the same characteristics; a doughy but fruity yeast presence, along with a good amount of sweet, dark malt. Brown sugar. Very sweet finish that leaves a rather cloying aftertaste; kind of like Cracker Jacks. Warming. Full body. Too sweet, though I guess that keeps with the style.","philipquarles","Sep 19, 2009"

Great beer; Pretty Things is definitely headed in the right direction.","wagenvolks","Aug 31, 2009"
4.33,10.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bomber bottle, tape over the cap says ""Bottled July 2009,Batch two"". Pours a moderatly dark shade of brown, murky and welcoming. The Frothy head is dark khaki, long lasting and leaving a rich collar, then well developed and quite beyond respectable sheeting/lacing. Nice looking beer. The sniff is soaked in ripe dark fruit, raisins and figs. Full flavor and quite tasty brew. Dark Belgian beer lovers rejoice. Loaded with notes of rum soaked raisins, ripe and goey figs and plums. Pleasing mouthfeel and smooth finish. Alcohol present but well folded into all the other good stuff going on here. Classy sipper, night capper, dessert beer. Well done, PT crew...","Billolick","Aug 29, 2009"
4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Opened up a bottle from the first batch (according to the cap label) and it poured a hazy brown with a short off-white head. Overall, this beer reminded me a bit of Ommegang's Three Philosophers, but less-so of traditional Belgian quads like St. Bernardus 12. While the beer is smooth drinking, it's also considerably more bitter and has a roasted toffee flavor that stands out. Of course, there's also cherry, caramel, fig, and plum flavors rolling around in this almost too-drinkable beer. Definitely worth a try for an interesting and tasty take on the style.","tempest","Beers"
4.68,19.7,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into a Chimay chalice, formed a 3/4"" brown head over the cloudy dark red brew. Frothy head receds very gradually, with a thick coating of lace. Aroma is yeasty, spicy, and dark fruits. Taste is moderately sweet upfront, fruit in the middle, and the close finds the spice and alcohol coming together. I'm having trouble separating the flavors, they all merge so well. Mouthfeel is way smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Liking this.","ppoitras","0"

It has a solid pale and crystal malt scent along with a nice fruity yeast aroma. It's dry with a bit of warmth and plum aroma. It's not overly fruity; just complimentary. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that's rich in crystal malts and Belgian ale yeast. The dried plums add some complexity, but the yeast is the dominant flavor here. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a tastey brew. I tried it at the ACBF and couldn't wait to buy a bottle for home. Nice work!","WesWes","Jul 24, 2009"
4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"M&D- The mouth is nice on this, sweet and a bit syrupy, I would say baby tree as an above medium body with light carb, especially when it warms. A smooth sipper with just a bit of heat when going down. The ABV is not as high as other quads which is a nice change of pace, The lighter ABV does not take away from the taste which is superb. I would have no problem drinking a whole bomber of this & I would not be stumbling around afterwards. This might benefit from some short term aging, but it is great where it's at now.","BARFLYB","Jul 23, 2009"

That boozey smell may be plums, since I get it on the taste too. It doesn't taste boozey, but something with that slightly bracing bitterness, that eventually smooths out. I think it is the plums. Sweet, plum, velvety. Nice and smooth. It takes a bit to get used to, but it becomes very drinkable when you do. Probably my least favorite Pretty Thing so far, but by no means a poor showing.","damienblack","Jun 20, 2009"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"For the Summer, it is a pretty cold, dismal day out that reminds me more of Fall. For this reason, I decided to pick up something with a little alcohol girth to it. Before I go any further, the artwork on this beer, and all Pretty Things beers (which I believe are drawn by Dann) are some of the coolest out there. On to the beer...Dark in color, sort of burgundy, a quick forming head that quickly becomes white lacing with multiple levels. Dark stone fruits meld very well with the Quad character. Sometimes this style gives off smells and flavors of dark fruit not unlike the ones found here. In this case however, the addition of dried plums does raise the bar a bit without becoming too sweet or artificial seeming. Besides the fruit, other accompanying complexities include some brown bread, molasses, bubblegum, powdered sugar and delicate alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied, yet very manageable. When this brew first hit the shelves in April, some friends of mine felt that it was a bit too hot. If that sentiment was true, it is drinking superbly right now. Still, I am sure a year or more of cellar time would do wonderful things to this brew. My final thoughts are that this fits in perfectly with the rest of Pretty Things exceptional line of beers. BAs not within the distribution area of this brewery should be setting their sights on Baby Tree and the rest on the lineup.","jamie2dope","Jun 20, 2009"

Brewed last month, we happily started the dinner with this lovely 1p9.6oz big bottle of lovely Belgian Quad-style plum ale...mmm, plum. The pour was a nice cloudy brown with reddish hue and minimal head & lace, but an immediate banana aroma that disappeared and did not linger in the slightest. The dark plum-skin - currant wheat aroma prevailed thereafter, but not in any overwhelming manner. The flavor was likewise with some wheaty-malt & lemon peel, leaving a bit of mustiness in the nose.
