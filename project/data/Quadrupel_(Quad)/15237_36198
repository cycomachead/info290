Pours very hazy/cloudy dark brown color with a small dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, clove, pepper, cinnamon, spice, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, brown bread, chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, cinnamon, spice, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin. prune, fig, cherry, toffee, molasses, chocolate, toast, clove, brown bread, cinnamon, spice, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of yeast, malt, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 02, 2014"

The heavy roast component and lower levels of sweetness are not necessarily what I expect or want out of a quad style beer. That being said, this beer is unique and makes for an interesting drink. The strong flavors and higher alcohol heat mean this beer is not for the faint of heart. I'll re-visit this winter....","spoony","Jul 28, 2014"

Aroma has dark fruit raisin, plum, and other over ripened fruits seeping through your nares as you inhale each sip. I'm currently smoking a Viaje Roman Candle with this quad, and it goes great together...that's not surprising at all deep smoke, spicy black pepper, and other dark leather notes form so well with the Nicaraguan tobacco utilized in this huge spice bomb of a cigar. It's a nice combo of sweet and salty even umami at times on the palate, huge dark malt base with Belgian yeast spice providing the fermentation on this beer. Andre' Farkas from Viaje has done so well with this cigar line, but enough about the smoke let's talk more beer. Perfect level of acidity like a red grape ripened to the point that it's ready to bulge and transmorph into a plump raisin. Mouthfeel is magnificent perfect driven naturally carbonated mouthfeel leaves the palate with some effervescence to carry on the complex body and flavor. Overall, quite frankly I'm in love with this beer yet it needs more age to truly express itself the English on the front of the label says 2012 and it calls itself Old Monk's Ale...I can see why!","WVbeergeek","May 20, 2014"

But good legs, no sediment, enticing to look at. Not a big bloom of aroma but still enticing, with clove, cherry, cinnamon, root beer, a bit of basement workshop, meaning sawdust and a tad of funk. Whoa, caramel malt, very brown sugar, a lick of tart cherry or raspberry, a whiff of tobacco, and just a bit of some herbacious hops drying the edges of the tongue. Rich but less complex than, say, it's -pot brother. That drying helps define the mouthfeel, too, by cleaning up a bit of chewiness and oiliness in the body.","ManforallSaisons","Nov 19, 2013"

The nose is somewhat faint, yielding some brown sugar, toffee, light biscuit, and light red grapes when some effort is applied via my 'strils. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, fig, red apple skin, red grape, dark fruit, light clove, light cinnamon, a touch of banana peel, and a vague hint of honeydew in the very back. Now there's some complexity, folks! The body is a fairly hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel.

Complete absence of lacing does not add positively to visual aspects of the beer. The reviewed beer belongs to PannepØt, the cane sugar based variant hence the poor head retention is not surprising, as cane sugar is supposedly inferior to candi sugar that adds to a beer's head retention. Aromas are of chocolate coated dark fruit (dried cherries, prunes), sugar and spicy alcohol. Flavor dept consists of chocolate covered dry cherries & prunes, sugar and bread crust bitter finish counteracting the sweetened fruity tartness.

While each of the Pannepot variants is clearly different side-by-side, they all share fairly similar flavor profiles - I think my preference is the original beer, but I could go for any of them depending on my mood. 4.0","MasterSki","Jan 04, 2011"

Dances on the tongue type of carbonation, maybe a little too much for my liking, almost champagne like. I pick up the booze taste pretty easily. Fruity type tastes as well. I can appreciate the style but this beer just had too light of a mouthfeel for me.","kbutler1","Jan 01, 2011"

Fairly simple, there's a lot of brown sugar and honey with alcohol being a lot more noticeable. Rummy and fruity, this finishes medium-dry with a touch of alcohol and spices. Medium-light in body, this is sweeter than I care for. Fruity and tasty on the finish, I can't help but notice that the higher carbonation in this version results in this not being as creamy as the regular version.

4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours murky brown, good amount of sediment, with a very small light tan head that quickly fades to a ring. Aroma is a nice sweet caramel maltiness with spice, a rich and meaty red wine aroma as well. Also berries and apple in the aroma as well as evidence of the alcohol strength. Taste is outstanding blend of sugary and caramel malts with a nice ginger and spice flavor. A nice tangy apple flavor balances the sweet and spices very nicely. Hints of root beer flavor, a drying finish welcomes in a brief punch of alcohol warmth. Medium in body, low carbonation, slightly slick feeling at the back of the throat. Very good beer, great taste, everything comes together very well. I'd also say this one is a great candidate for some ageing. Very interesting to compare to the belgian version.","hoppymeal","Sep 08, 2007"
4.27,2.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a murky brown with a head that quickly disappears. Very little lacing. Sherry like nose, with dry vinous and slightly oaklike aromas. Some sweet malt on the finish as well as raisins. The taste is somewhat similar, but there is a much richer fruitiness with prunes, chocolate, and dark cherries added into the flavor profile. Sherry like finish is still there, but with a hint of sweetness at the very end. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is smooth, substantial, and creamy. The alcohol is clearly there, but not in an overpowering way. Not quite as rich as some quads, or as sweet. More like an amontillado to the others oloroso, but still quite enjoyable for its own style.","Georgiabeer","Beers"
4.2,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a murky deep brown color with a very bubbly tan head over top that falls to a full coat. Clarity is fairly good on this one and there are tons of tiny bubbles cascading up and helping keep the head around. The nose on this one is nice and raisiny, with a blast of spicy yeast that reminds me of cinnamon, followed by a deep and sweet candied sugar sweetness. Taking a very deep inhale over top brings me a solid yeasty breadyness at the end. This one is very aromatic, with the sweet malty and sugary notes playing the staring role. My first sip brings a more subdued flavor than I would have expected. I find a mild raisin fruit with a very mild caramel and sugar sweetness behind it. There is a mild banana fruityness playing in the background along with a niticable yeasty character that imparts a breadyness. Mouthfeel is thick with a very mild carbonation. This one has no slickness as I would expect from the strong sugary aroma. It is very smooth. The only hint of the ABV I find in this one is the slight drying quality on the finish. I enjoy the strong aromatic component and very solid flavor (but more subdued from the original version). I enjoy this one quite a bit.","kmpitz2","0"
4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"I am not sure of the difference between Pannepot and Pannepøt, but they are certainly different. This beer seems to be a touch sweeter, and not nearly as aromatically fruity as Pannepot. I'll definitely have to do a side by side of these two to explore them a bit more in depth. As the beer warms up it loses a touch of sweetness, yet strangely notes of brown sugar and even molasses become evident. Still that woody, almost peat like, spiciness is quite noticeable and it starts to mix in with a touch of warming alcohol towards the finish. Definitely another really tasty offering from the Struis Brouwers. I can't wait to crack my bottle of Aardmonnik!","Gueuzedude","Aug 15, 2007"

The aroma was of malt, chocolate and while molasses and the other aromas where there like the last one, not as pronounced. A flavor of malt, chocolate and molasses.
