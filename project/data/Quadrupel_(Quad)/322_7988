3.78,-4.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,"quad done with valerian root and lemon balm, a nice herbal touch to a peciuiarly light base quad. cloudy medium amber color without much thickness, i am surprised how light this is, with effervescent carbonation it hardly looks like a quad at all. the yeast is forward in the nose, with esters of pears and figs and raisins, as well as a green tea bitterness likely from the lemon balm. the flavor is the same as the nose, not super complex or evolving, but extremely different from what we generally expect in a quad. absent is the dense dark sweet grains, and instead there is an herbal springtime lightness to it that aids in drinkability. i would never in a million years guess 12% abv for this beer, it drinks so much lighter than that. a beer that probably deserves a little more attention on our shores here, especially considering how affordable it is. i wish for more body out of a quad, and thats the part that really threw me off, but i loved the bright bubbles and the dryness on the finish. cool use of these botanicals in a very unique beer.","StonedTrippin","Mar 04, 2014"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sugar, citrus, lemon rine, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, alcohol, sugar, citrus, lemon rine, wheat, and bread. It had a medium feel on the palate with very high carbonation. Ovearll this was a decent brew. Based on the aroma I really wasn't expecting much from this brew. However, the flavor was quite complex and pretty good. Not sure how the citrus aspect was supposed to tie into this brew, but it didn't kill it in any way; just didn't enhance it. Worth trying for any fan of the style.","thagr81us","Jun 10, 2011"

It has quad tendicies you can smell and taste all the inverted sugar here, but not any notes of caramel or dark fruits. overall, it wasn't what I was expecting, aside from that an average beer on its own merits.","jrallen34","Mar 08, 2010"

Sheets of pastel off orange Belgian lacing. Earthy nose that hints that this one is going to be on the thin side. Raisin, figs and plum, a little booze; all quite nice but slightly understated. The flavor matches up quite nicely with the nose. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel as understated as the nose. REALLY can't believe that this one is 12% ABV. Drinkability??your call.

4.36,10.4,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Reviewed from my notes of a rare cask pour at the Lion's Pride's Belgian Beer Festival. This cask was just tapped moments before I was served a glass; it had been stored in a cooler, so it was at a lower temperature than most cask beers are poured. It has a beautiful creamy copper/brown color. There are two fingers worth of white foam. The head settled slowly to an even skim of white. Perfect lace was left behind. This is exactly how a cask beer should look. It has a subtle aroma; a little cidery, spicy and sweet. It's a good balance of the strong smells you get from a quad and the faint smells from casked beer. The flavor has sweet malts up front, with some crystal sugar and a slight cider taste. There is alcohol and pepper in the finish. It's very unique and tasty. It has a lighter medium body; surprising for a quad, but right in line with a lot of the cask beers I've tried. There isn't much carbonation, but more than other casks, perhaps keeping the cask chilled helped with this. The beer leaves a great sweet coating on my tongue. There are plenty of alcohol vapors as well. It is slightly stickier than I like; I would rate it a 4.25 if I could. This is supremely drinkable, considering the strength, alcohol and spice. It's such a unique beer, I can't really say if it exceeds or conforms to the expectations of any style. It's just great. If you ever see the BBB on cask, get it!","ToasterChef","Jan 08, 2010"

3.68,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Had a bottle for $10 at The Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Poured murky brown with a short tan head. 12% is a lot for a Belgian and it shows. This beer is more barleywine than anything, though the Belgian influence is there. The big fig and cocoa malt flavor are certainly rich, but the body is thin and dry enough (like a good quad) to make this drinkable and avoid a syrup-y feeling. Still the flavor isn't terribly complex. I'd call this more of a strong dark as it doesn't resemble your average quad.","tempest","Jun 24, 2009"

4.15,5.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a dark plum color with a slight cream colored head. Aroma of sweet berries balanced out by a nice sour scent.

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy chestnut with a decent head that mostly fades , but sticks around as a thin, swirly cap. Fruity and slightly funky with persimmon and apricot. No hint of the bandaid aroma that you sometimes get with this brewery. The taste is quite a bit more sour, but with more sweet persimmon to balance the the flavors. A touch of lemon and sweet red apple rounds it out. Quite tame and smooth for the style, and the alcohol is unbelieavably well hidden. Nice, if a bit on the soft side.","Georgiabeer","Aug 16, 2008"

Worked perfect. Poured with a tan head. No lace. Hazy brown color. Odd mix of aromas: dark, ripe fruits, dark malts, a hint of wet cardboard, fudge, nuts, and and cocoa. Flavor was a little lighter. More of the dark, ripe fruits, some yeast, and honey. Soft body with a bit of tang from carbonation. Not much apparent alcohol surprisingly. Not the heavy hitter I would've expected either.

4.17,5.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a nice malty Belgian whose mouthfeel feels like its going to start out as a Flemish red, but quickly develops into heavy malt instead of sweetness or tartness. The color is a cloudy amber with a large, foamy head that dissipates into lingering lace. The smell makes it hard to pin down the style, but some booziness is detectable after a strong whiff. I think this would be best with some sturdy, aromatic type of food, like blue cheese, to go with it, more so than drinking it by itself.","StoutHearted","Jul 04, 2008"

The taste was very malty and fruity, and fairly sweet as well. The mouthfeel was slightly syupy with slight carbonatoin, and the alcohol presence was masked extremely well. Drinkability was low, only because this is a sweet, thick beer with lots of booze in it.","zjungleist","Beers"

Smell is raisins. Sweet, alcoholic, raisins. Taste is a bit less intense- still lots of alcoholic raisins, but not as overwhelming. Sweet, a bit bready. Mouthfeel is chewy, sudsy, more bubbly than I'd expect for such a high alcohol brew. Overall quite drinkable, and pretty tasty. Good bang for your buck. And alcohol is waaaay sneaky.","scooter231","May 15, 2006"

Hot, fusel alcohol and rum soaked fruit. Maraschino cherry. The flavor opens with huge syrupy sweetness. Gooey caramel malt suprersaturated with candi sugar. Hot and boozy right from the start. Incredibly sweet, with that lingering saccharine bite in the end. I'd say it's cloying. Super fruity and packed with alcohol, like cherry syrup cut with grain alcohol. Peppery phenols into the finish, mostly overwhelmed by the hot, hot booze. Very little carbonation, enhancing the massive sweetness and slick mouthfeel. Crazy, and hard to drink. I feel like I could breathe fire.","UnionMade","Mar 10, 2006"

3.7,-6.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer was well behaved on the pour with a little head and a malty honey alcohol nose. It is a dark brown opaque ale with small bubbles that just looked creamy. It is creamy with an instant alcohol warmth. The taste is surprisingly light and dry with alcohol dominating the palate. Nice sweetness with a citrus dryness making for a clean finish. The label read ale with spices but I cant taste spices other than coriander is a minor way. As it warms, the flavors come together better but this may need a year or three to mellow. It also is a bit thin.","lou91","Jan 25, 2005"
2.9,-26.6,4,4,2.5,3,2,"Pours a slight murky/cloudy/dirty apricot with a thick, guazey white head. I seem to really like the look of a dirty beer! Smells of caramel/toffee malts, cardamom, licorice, and big, spicy medicinal hops. Almost smells like an English Barleywine (with spices). Big malty sweetness with stewed fruit cocktail up front. Big, spicy (fennel), medicinal warming hops and alcohol come on strong and remain so into the finish. Too cough syrupy, and with the fennely spices, not the greatest combination. Cloying and syrupy big mouthfeel. Nice looking and smelling, but...taste...could barely finish.","alexgash","Dec 19, 2004"

4.22,6.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a very murky deep amber color. Reminds me of apple cider. There was a small amout of sediment or crust around the mouth of the bottle-this might have made it cloudier then it should be. Nice aroma-hints of vanilla,caramel,brown sugar. Good oakey notes-earthy and yeasty. All the different smells are nicely balanced. Big sweet flavor up front-raisen like. Slightly sweet. 12%???!!!! Not from where Im sitting-high abv is very well hidden. Somewhat spicy. Very full body-a damn fine beer. I need to buy more then one next time or see if it comes in a liter size. Well worth buying.","lackenhauser","Dec 01, 2004"
3.85,-2.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a dark mirky amber color. The smell is of alcohol and the ever so familiar sweet smell that comes from the belgian candy sugar that I assume was used in this brew. It resembles raisins or dates, something along that line. The taste is sweet, honey-like. It also has hints of dark fruit like dates, raisins, and alcohol is there as well. The mouthfeel is smooth. It has the perfect amount of carbonation for the amount of flavor in the beer. It is a very drinkable beer but how many of these can one actually handle. Drink one and then consider switching down to something less dangerous. I would definately recommend it.","Brian700","Nov 27, 2004"

3.09,-21.8,3,4,3,1.5,3,"I had to check the ratings before I rated this one. Its incredibly low carbonation. I was worried with the very weak pfssht on cracking the cap, but looking at the ratings here, its either an incredibly common problem for this beer, or a flaw in every bottle. Anyway, it pours a cloudy brown. The aroma has a nice brown sugar and honeydew melon fruitiness. The flavor adds toast and a touch of caramel to the mix. This would probably be a great beer if they pumped up the carbonation. The fact I could drink it as flat as it was says something about it.","aracauna","Nov 14, 2004"

The alcohol and hops are evident and leave a nice warming feeling in my belly (great winter brew I think). The swallow is nice, and a pretty decent aftertaste as well.

4.17,5.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinking a bottle of this brew at room temp in a snifter. The beer pours a clear mahogany with some garnet tints, the bottom of the bottle releases some yeast dredges into the glass. I get a soft fluffy off-white head of about .5 cm to foam up. Aroma is dark fruit, ripe plums, raisins and cherries dominate, but I also detect lemon and banana as well. Actually I hint of nutmeg perhaps too. First sip reveals a thinner body than expected with very smooth, gentle and almost non-existent carbonation. Flavor is generally sweet, with ripe fruit coming through again, plums and prunes mix with caramel and again the lemon shows up. I get a bit of bitter earthy hop presence on the finish as well. A quite tasty and easy to drink beer. Very smooth for 12%.","sulldaddy","Beers"
3.09,-21.8,3,4,3,1.5,3,"Pours a still muddy burgundy with tons of powdery sediments. No head. No pop on opening. Very fruity nose: perfumey pears, plums, oranges, apples. Sweet caramel. woody spiciness, cinammon. Moderately yeasty. Remarkably hidden alcohol, but the flat body is very annoying and removes a big part of the excitement which is sad because there is a nice range of malt flavors and no yeasty acidity to speak of. Still, I dont know that I would enjoy this all that much as sweet as it is and with nothing to counter it. It feels like a fruity sweet full bodied red wine.","Rastacouere","0"

4.32,9.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazed copper with a big tan colored head. A careful pour from a snub-nosed bottle left lots of particles and protein coagulation left in suspension. Good lacing. Sweet, caramelly, toffee-like aromas as well as some faint old ale smells, like straight graininess, some hops and fusel alcohols and a light fruitiness. Good carbonation, which helps cut the high alcohol. Richly sweet, subtly grassy and botanical, and lightly tropical in it's starfruit-like fruitiness. Mild spicing evident, certainly not overwhelming, but hard to decipher any specifics. This beer certainly hides it's boasty 12% ABV pretty well with an array of sensations on the palate, but note it is an asskicker.","crookedhalo","Jun 06, 2004"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer after its escape from the 11.2 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a smazy brown, with a colossal head that is spumous in texture and the color a toothsome tan, the resultant lace forms a glutinous blanket to obscure the glass. Nose is that of very ripe plums, hints of yeast and a bit of fusel alcohol, start is sweet and thick with malt, top id moderate to full in its feel upon the palate. Finish has a staunch acidity, the hops pounce on your palate along with the 12 percent ABV to make it spicy, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a quite decent beer.","Gusler","May 12, 2004"
