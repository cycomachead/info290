The flavor is pretty good, good bit of sweet malt, some fig and caramel.  A little syrupy, especially at the end but the lip smacking malt is great.  Not a bad job of hiding the 11.8% alcohol.  Decent but not spectacular quad.","JamieDuncan","Feb 28, 2015"

There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

Taste: sugary... caramelized sugar with potential pancake syrup underneath a lot of grape skin and a little tart cherry and pepper. Spicy booze hit towards the end of the sip lingers through the finish, keeping it from becoming cloying even as it leaves a sugary coating behind. Feel starts almost syrupy then into creamy full bodied-ness that thins out gradually. It was an enjoyable sipper, but I wouldn't seek it out again (at least not this fresh).

The fruit flavors are complex and pull up just short of cloying. The alcohol is well hidden for a beer this big.

Only other quads I had was a Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Apt 12, but I loved in all aspects. I had about 5-6 sips of this quad and had to unfortunately drainpour as it was gagging me worse with each attempt to sip. An undrinkable mess of a beer.

A bit of clove and banana presence as well. Mouthfeel is a quick effervescent combo of malt, alcohol, yeast and the aforementioned fruits that is velvety on the palate and then finishes clean.Very well done, the alcohol is present and makes this a wonderful sipper that has a warming effect but is not overpowering and blends nicely with the malt, fruit and yeast flavors.

Without a glass of water nearby finishing this one might have been a challenge. When I compare this review with my notes on other beers in the style I think that this one lacks some of the complexity and subtleness found in the Trappist BSDAs. As with most Weyerbacher beers I think this one is pretty well made and I’m looking forward to seeing what happens to it with another years or two of bottle age.

Taste of banana, dark fruits, candi sugar, and some caramel; with light spices and a bit of bourbon. Very sweet flavor with no bitterness noticed at all. The finish is fairly dry, with only a small bit of lingering sweetness. Incredibly smooth finish with no alcohol noticed except for a slight warming with a light alcohol bite after the finish. I was extremely surprised at the smoothness for it's alcohol content. Medium carbonation and creamy full body.

The smell is very sweet- a sweet fruity smell- very raw smelling. Again, very surprised at the smell. Not bad, just different than any quad I've had. The taste is nice, probably the best part of this beer. The amazing thing is that at 11.8% ABV, I hardly taste any alcohol at all. Tart fruit and alcohol are the main things I taste w/ this beer. The mouthfeel is very tart and crisp. It's almost like a slap across the face. There's also a slight alcohol burn 5 seconds after you take a sip. Not bad at all. Drinkability is good, but this is a sipper for sure. Not a great quad, and definitely different than any I've had before. Aging this one for a couple years would probably improve it quite a bit.

A bit of sweetness and dark fruits there as well. Taste is quite nice with some sweetness coming through along with a bit of booze. Some light spice as well as dark fruits. Some figs and dates there.

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a pretty good brew. I didn't check the ABV on it before drinking it, but I could tell it was quite high from the flavor (I was right).

Hearty smell, not real boozy, but yeasty with some tropical fruit/orange notes that are typical of a Belgian and there are some sweet sugary notes. Touch of spice like pepper but can't really go into detail. A sticky, thicker, heavier body hits my tongue. Raisins, figs, dark fruits like grapes and possibly black cherry and a touch of sweet fruit are all in there, as well as a little zip of clove or pepper (coriander?) along w/ citric notes like orange and banana for that hint of sharpness. A tad vinous to me b/c of high ABV, the malts are noticeable w/ a touch of sweetness for balance as there is some caramel, candied-sugar and a touch of toasted malt is barely in there. A slow sipper as not only is the thickness and heartiness of the beer alot to take in, but quite frankly the ABV warms the mouth (like a quasi-shot of whiskey) and I can actually feel my lips and tongue slightly warmed and a twang of burn in the chest (not like a horrible hot streak when you take a shot of Wild Turkey 101). I enjoyed this quad but it just didn't have the exceptional taste or diversity of beers from Belgian; still, a very good representation of this style and quite enjoyable.","clayrock81","Dec 13, 2010"

A bit of foam on top, nothing huge. Smells is dark fruit, apple, plum, maybe some apricot, some candi sugar, grapes, alcohol, earthy hops maybe. Taste is different than in the past, or maybe thats the tap. There is a nice interplay between the fruit and the yeast, with less of a showing from the deep candi sugar, it's there, but not up there as it's Belgian counterparts. Some alcohol towards the end. Feel is above medium, fullfilling, sharp, lightly carbed and not really hot, but there is a warming quality. Not as sweet and ligering as the Belgians, this had a nice American twist.

Surprisingly, not that boozy considering the ABV and that most people complain about this being too hot when fresh. Low carbonation gives a great mouthfeel that is smooth and rich.

Head was half inch, off-white and creamy/loose. Head eventually dissipates into a skim clustered on one side of the glass and a thin band around the perimeter of the bowl. Some solid sheets of lacing, but weak legs. Nose is dark fruit (plums, raisins and figs), candi sugar and Belgian yeast. Taste consistent with nose; perhaps the addition of some cherries and a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is light-medium and lively, a little oily and finishes semi-dry. Not a lot of complexity to this one, but a very tasty and pleasant sipper that should be allowed to warm to experience some slight changes in character.","Jwale73","Beers"

Taste is similar but adds a note of sweetness. Maybe because I've recently had Rochforte 10 and St Bernardus but this beer just really doesnt compare. I guess the quad is best left to the monks.

I've found that many of their Belgian styles are exaggerated versions. This is no exception. That doesn't mean they are necesarily extreme or super complex, rather they take one note notable in a style and run with it. In this case it's the bubblegum notes in the Belgian yeast that are (over?)emphasised. The taste mirrors this as well, and adds a light graininess.

The flavors were really, really sweet. I love this company, but I have to say, this one was cloyingly sweet. At first I tasted the pineapple and a little piney hops but this was soon followed by aggressive candy sugars like a tropical Jolly Rancher candy. Behind the sugars lurked caramel malt, alcohol and some floral hops but they were nearly quashed. The mouthfeel was smooth and a little slick, the body medium/full and the carbonation good.

The color was crystal orange, very clear, no haze. The aroma reminded me of a few of my favorite barley wines, a fair amount of alcohol, dark fruits and sweet grass.

The head atop was small and faded to a small rim around the edges, but somehow the lacing was still pretty solid. The smell was authentic for the style with boozy, spicy, and heavily fruity overtones. The taste was banana, raisin, and fig like in its sweetness and had added flavor due to a lot of spiciness evident with each sip. The alcohol was obvious, but not obnoxious. The mouthfeel was not as caressing as I would have liked, but it was quite full, sticky, and satisfying. The aftertaste was spicy white pepper and orange peel flavors lingering on.

The initial taste is fairly boozy, followed by full on fruit - with cherries and raisins in the foreground. Prune plum and caramel in there as well. Finishes with a notable bitterness to the hops and alcohol, fuseal in flavor but not burning - this tastes between a quad and barleywine. The low carbonation and relatively thick body backs up the impression of this as a hybrid beer - has none of the prickle I look for from quads.

Starts with a pour into a snifter, with a decent head, and a minimal amount of lacing. The color is tha of a hazy copper with some light redish golden highlights. The smell had some raison, plum, and alot of young alcohol. The taste was more of the same and still there is too much going on in there. I expected the bere to be alittle more full bodied, but it was very light on the tongue. It had a lot of coating due to the alcohol which seamed to seep the pores of my mouth with a slight twang of tart at the very end. I dont think i could handle more than one of these at a time right now. There is too much alcohol presence in ther to make this beer enjoyable. Im rating this a 4.0 on taste for its potential.

Taste is very good, the sweetness in the nose comes through light and delicately rather than cloying, nice complex alcohol-laced fruitiness, a slightly woody/nutty malt, a flavorfully spicey finish, everything comes together nicely.

It was the intensity of the fruit flavors at the tale end of each sip that caused me to deduct points for taste; it seemed a bit out of proportion in relation to the various other flavors. The candy and honey flavors really added a nice sweet touch to this Quadrupel and made it unique in that is created a flush of sweetness all over my tongue in the first few sips without blowing out my taste buds.

Taking a sip, some spice comes out (cinnamon) along with some plum flavors. Some vanilla sweetness comes out, but lots of alcohol burn through the flavors. It even has some dryness to it on the finish that reminds me of oak barrels a little. The feel is big time alcohol...all 12% are represented in the feel of this one.

A slight smell of alcohol creeps in as this warms but it only adds to the experience. Fruit hits the palette first with a light spicy sweetness that is met with a caramel flavor. There was a good bit of spice in this as well that also was present in the bitter lingering after taste. Very complex flavor with only the slightest hint of the huge alcohol on the aftertaste.

Candied fruits, big malt, caramel and toffee, nut-skin like astringency in the finish as well as warming alcohol.

However the beige head struggled to reach a finger in height, then it quickly faded to a soapy collar. The subsequent lacing was minimal. The potency of the nose is massive; it is very bold with strong, warm alcohol notes upfront. Okay, who am I fooling? The alcohol is found throughout every sniff along with notes of plums, candied-sugar covered raisins, hints of chocolate and bubblegum, and bananas soaked in dark rum. I really like the bouquet, it is forceful and very blunt with the alcohol but the other aromas almost round out the bouquet; still I like it for some reason. Inviting. The palate starts off full-throttle burning alcohol heat. It is unrelenting. It took a few sips before it tired to a point where other flavors could emerge. This is very malty, very rich with notes of plums, raisins, figs, some rum spice, apples, bananas, and distant chocolate. Some of these flavors never play more than a distant supporting role; the plums and raisins do dominate the fruitiness department. A brown sugary sweetness grows with warmth. Oddly the warmer it became the thinner it seem, not only in mouthfeel but taste. The finish is alcohol heat, some pepper, sugar, and green apples. All in all, Quad is a decent beer, it seems a little heavy-handed at times but it is still quite flavorful but probably not as complex as many great Belgian Ales. Medium in body, low carbonation, especially for a beer of this ilk, I must say the low carbonation produces a soft creaminess on the tongue; I like that. This plenty drinkable, I rather liked it; I bet it would be even better after it matured for a few years. Nevertheless I would quaff this on occasion if I had the opportunity. I must say thanks to BIG746 for the BIF 3 delivery! I think this is worth trying at least once.","bditty187","Apr 23, 2004"
3.64,-5.5,3,4,3.5,3,4,"The appearance was good, but not what I would expect in a Belgian style beer. Too clear in my opinion, where's the yeast? Personally I like my Belgian style quads and strong darks to be a murky brown. Also a serious lack of head and lace. I poured this almost strait into my goblet, and barely a bubble was raised. The smell was good, slight hint of banana mixed with solvent. Also hints of other fruits like dried raisons and figs. The taste was just slightly better than average. Sweet malts and dried fruits. Just as the smell, figs, raisons and some tropical fruitiness. Also a hint of earthy wooden flavors. I thought the alcohol was masked very well which at 12% is surprising. In fact, that may be the only thing this beer does in an exceptional manor. The mouthfeel compared to other beers of this style, was not quite as rich and pleasing. Not thin, but just not as creamy. Drinkability I rated higher though, being that the high abv is pretty well hidden. This beer is not bad, just not true enough to it's Belgian cousins. It lacks the over all character that the Belgians have. Too homogenized for my taste.","Ieatlambfries","Apr 11, 2004"

4.05,5.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Cellared for a couple years. Turbid bister hue. Head recedes into a thin, dense cream white foam ring due to the alcohol content. Pungent wafts of candied walnut, bourbon soaked prune and banana esters upfront in aroma. Mellow hints of buttery toffee and minty ethanol. Well rounded and welcoming aromawise. Incipient in flavor is a coating, dark, singed caramel sweetness. Complexities arise promptly, with buttered pine nuts and grainy, sweet biscuit arising mid palate. Trace clove. Understated bubblegum ester undertone complements caramel tones. Paltry hop bitterness leaves ample residual sweetness. Ethanol presence augments as the beer breathes, lending a stately, maple sweetened hot toddy presence. Full bodied, with a dextrinous, viscous, but agreeably soft mouthfeel. Well calculated carbonation. Finishes quite clean, with lingering hints of sugary brittle. A tasty ""Quadrupel"" that's surprisingly understated in yeast derived character. Akin to a Belgian dubbel / English barleywine hybrid on steroids. Well hidden ethanol character. Excellent, at least when aged.","marc77","0"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a medium red color and formed a small off white bubbyl head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and candy like bubblegum. A hint of the alcohol present is also in the background. A flavor of malt, with a sweetness of candy yet a hint of pine pointing to the heavy alcohol of this beer. The finish is sweet yet astrigent due to this as well. Not a bad beer, and tough to gauge since I have not tried many quads.","Wildman","Mar 23, 2004"

It's pricey and potent, and the ABV puts the brakes on continued indulgence, because the flavor falls just short of inspiring in spite of the alcohol.

Once again in mouth, the alcohol taste is quite strong with sweet raisins and white grapes. It really makes me think of a red wine without the dryness. Body is big and thick, but a little flat, I'd prefer a bit more carbonation personally. Good effort and I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more american brewers trying their hand at ABTs (way to go Allagash).

Taste: Flavor has some bready yeast, mild chocolate, layers of fruit but nothing comes together well alot of complexity no cohesion. Mouthfeel: A bit lighter bodied than expected rather light on carbonation but still very silky overall texture.

Aroma is mostly malty, with hints of prune/raisin and a wee bit o' nuttiness. Nice rich, sweet really lovely flavor. More malt and dark fruit notes with a gently floral, lightly spiced hop finish. Aftertaste lingers with a ever-so-slightly burnt malt flavor. The bitterness of this beer comes out more as you move down the glass, but it's a very fruity bitterness -- almost mead-like, really. Aside from the lack of carbonation giving this a rather flat appearance and mouthfeel, it's really quite a nice beer.","mzwolinski","Jan 29, 2004"

The flavor profile expands as the beer opens up, garnering notes of cocoa and apricot with a subtle, warming alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately carbonated, though a touch thin and watery compared to the classics in this style category.

This is the first Belgian style that I have had, that was not from the ""motherland", but I was very suprised that a simple American brewery can make this stuff. I am also starting to open up to more and more microbrews from the US. I would say that this is like most other regular Belgians, but a little more carbonated and not as ""heavy"" tasteing.

Finshes long, malty, with plummy/pruney notes on the palate, with more alcohol and hop sting to close things up. Not as balanced as this style should be, due to the huge amount of alcohol contained within. Don't smoke near this one!

There was lace noticable, some parts were sparce and hardly there, but other parts seemed to leave a sticky residue/lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were big - caramel, sweet malts, fruits (2 kinds - dark and fresh), wood and of course alcohol. The tastes were just as good and big - sweet malts, fruit soaked in alcohol (plums and raisins), floral hops, alcohol, roasted malts, and apples. A smooth and creamy beer that sneaks up on you. It starts off sweet then hits you with complex flavors and heats you up with the flame from the alcohol. It leaves a slight dry hop aftertaste but is shared with a sweetness to leave you with a well balanced feeling on your tongue. Again a nice and complex beer that surprised me.
