3.8,-7.5,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall: Kasteel Donker forms an integral part of one of my favourite beers, Kasteel Rouge, so it was interesting to get the opportunity to try it on its own. I think I'll stick to the cherrified version - Donker on its own is just too damned heavy and sweet for my personal tastes. As an 'every now and again' thing, this makes a nice change (and hell, you can't beat a good quadrupel) but it's hard going for 'regular' drinking.","interzen","Feb 28, 2015"

4.24,3.2,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/16/2007. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing fairly quickly. No glass lacing and some slight streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian Quadrupel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"
5,21.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a dark brown heading to maroon with little or no head, promising a boozy Belgian quad. Smelled like raisins, currants, and dark, sticky fruit in general. Tasted like a tawny port -- rich, sweet and booze on the front fading to fruit on the finish. Had a silky smooth feel perfect for the sweet alcohol. Overall one of the best, most balanced, beers I've tried even if one of the sweetest.","pigpen892","Feb 20, 2015"

4.88,18.7,4,4.75,5,5,5,"Pours a dark brown with a hint of read in there.  Nice head but it dissipated quickly and there was no lacing on the glass.  The smell jumps out as you pour, the dark fruits are the first thing you notice, mostly raisin, there seems to be a little cherry and definitely the candy.  You pick up a hint of the alcohol in the smell.  Then the taste, wow, unbelievable.  Taste is similar to smell but bigger and even more complex.  It is very sweet up front, you get the candy and the raisin is what I would call thick, but not out of whack.  I still am getting the cherry, kinda like wine which I almost never drink so could not quantify, and something along the caramel/toffee that I can't make out.  Although maybe just the candy that comes across creamy.  The alcohol is there but you do not notice it until you think about it.  Extremely tasty, complex, but oddly it all works.  It is sticky in you mouth, almost syrupy but it really works.  You are licking the sweetness of your lips, outstanding.  Overall this was an extremely interesting and quality quad that I am shocked is not getting more pub.  Good day and it was a victory beer, victory is good.","JamieDuncan","Jan 24, 2015"

It's ok, but I get the feeling Quad's are the malt version of IPA, meaning too much of one aspect of the beer dominating the others.","TheHammer","Sep 23, 2014"
3.9,-5.1,,,,,,"Overall â  A really good beer although in my opinion not as good as Golden Draak. At 11% it is not to be trifled with. You had better treat this one like a Trappist beer and leave it to one bottle a day. It hits you first at the back of the tongue and it is definitely quite sweet. I find it quite similar to toffee but beyond that there is not much to say. If you like them sweet then this is a good beer for you.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 23, 2014"

It dissipates quickly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma reminds me of prune, but the sweetness is very evident in the nose. The taste follows the aroma. Prunes, plum and raisins with lots of caramel sweetness. Medium mouth, but the way it slides off the tongue gives it a light feel. It's certainly different from the other quads I've tried, but it is so very good. I wish I could find this one closer to home.","MartzMimic","Aug 02, 2014"

Wow! Tastes of grapes, fig, sweet caramel, and a little alcohol bite; sweet and fruity after taste. Mouthfeel - Like a high gravity, squeezed fruit drink, very full bodied. Overall - This is about as good as it gets for a quad.

Not all quads are created equal and the spice and heavy mouthfeel weren't present here.

For a beer with 11% ABV, aside from its high level of sweetness (almost too sweet for my personal taste), it is very easy to drink. A little added carbonation may help balance out the sweetness, but that is just a small note to make in comparison to the many qualities this beer contains.","The_1084","Aug 03, 2012"

Not much head but it was light brown head and did lace slightly. Deep brown almost ruby color. Lots of fig cherry sweet dark fruit taste. Definitely a sipper and some warming from the alcohol. Very heavy beer and coats the mouth and throat.

I was expecting more of a subdued earthy scent, but this smelled almost like cherry cough syrup. The first sip yielded more of the cough syrup taste, but as I let it roll around in my mouth a bit, I tasted more of a molasses/brown sugar hint.

It tasted sweet, rich and malty with hints of brown sugar at the start but matured into a nice sweet-sour yeasty flavor with notes of dried fruit at the end that left the flavor lasting an average duration on the taste buds.

The aroma is of grapes, definitely no scent of hops, malt or barley.

Candied sugar, mild sweet malt and grain, some bread yeast, a touch of clove and spices. Not bad, but way too sugary for me. Mouthfeel was sticky sweet, almost like a lollipop.

As it warms, tons of dark fruits and raisins come across with some spices, citrus, alcohol and plenty of caramel malt. The mouthfeel is on the high end of moderate and the drinkability is great.

The opening taste is way too sweet (what? no sugar in here? Ha!), almost like maple syrup.

Some earthy undertones as well. Upon first sip I think to myself how a couple of years ago this was like mother's milk to me, and I reflect upon the fact that palates and people's taste preferences change over time and how much this beer could rot your teeth if you pass out before brushing them. Holy shit is it sweet, with just enough vinous fruitiness and moderate hoppiness to cut it before it becomes too cloying. I still love this beer, though. I'm just a bit more critical about beers than a couple of years ago. I'm just trying to reminisce why I loved this beer so much a couple years ago. I think it's the creamy mouthfeel paired with a deep, malty alcoholic punch that is very clean finishing, yet coating the mouth with stickiness. Dangerously drinkable, especially for it's lofty 11% ABV; but, overall, a little too sweet to give it a 4 in the drinkability rating.","crookedhalo","Feb 22, 2005"

A pronounced, yet balanced, sweetness that was consistent to the last milliliter. Had an exquisite creaminess which is surprising when one considers the 11% abv.

Fruity sweetness starts of the flavor before giving way to doughy malt with spice that keeps the sweetness in check. Alcohol was barely noticeable and the after taste left a sweet spiciness on your tongue. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a nice creaminess and it was a bit warming as well.

The aroma is of plums, sweet cherries, jammy yeast and a waft of airy alcohol. The taste is very malty with lots of ripe dark fruit, port, and christmas bread flavors. The alcohol is zesty and very warming, though its in check considering the high ABV. In fact its the warming effect of the alcohol that makes this such a great winter brew.

Having only tried one other Quadrupel, Rochefort 10, this is quite different but shares the complexities that make up this style.

The flavor is way malty, with caramel and dark fruits toward the finish. Oh, and coming in at 11%, there is the alcohol in the finish. It is full-bodied, with a creamy texture. The alcohol is definitly there, but not as boozing as one might expect from a high-octane brew such as this. It is a very nice brew.

I could not get beyond the overpowering sweetness of this beer and if there is any redeeming quality to this thing, it is lost in the syrup like taste. The taste was so bad that I had to cut it with another beer. Interestingly, I mentioned this to another Belgian beer friend of mine and he said he had to do the same thing. Overpriced and overrated is my opinion. The Triple was also unimpressive. There are many far better Belgians out there for less money.","scottstrades","Jan 13, 2004"
4.47,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Color varies from a black in the center to a deep orangish brown on the edges of the glass, body is completely opaque. Head is not overwhelming large and has an offwhite, slightly beige brown color to it. Aroma is extremely bready, covers up the alcohol smell, and has numerous candy-like sugar notes. A fig scent is somewhere in there--all in all its fairly complex. Taste is extremely sweet and centered on figgy, buttery, and slightly sour notes. Some prune-like qualities are in there. I know I havent used the most appetising words and comparisons to describe taste but dont worry, its actually pretty damn good. The beer finishes with a semi sweet aftertaste. Drinkability is there though I caution against taking up on it. This is no baby beer, packing 11% it will make the biggest man sway if he gets careless. Other than that the taste is extremely entertaining and unique which makes for quite a drinkable brew.","allboutbierge","Nov 21, 2003"
4.22,2.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a darker shade of borwn with a real nice sticky head thats seems to dissapte quickly,great aroma of raisins and light chocolate with some definent alcohol notes.The raisin seems to be the dominant flavor I get with some syrupy flavors as well.A touch of nuttiness and alcohol makes this a nice warmer,I have alot of bottle to drink yet wish me luck.","oberon","Nov 14, 2003"
4.63,12.7,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"This is a great expression of the style. The pour from the 750ml bottom produced a great foamy head that was quite peresistent and left a classic Belgian lace. Very dark with ruby hints, the aroma was there but not as strong as I might have imagined, mostly sweet and raisiny. Mostly a sweetish malt flavor with some raisin taste with a drying burlap finish. Shae a bottle for desert and you will make a friend, drink it alone and you will be asleep early.","DarrellK","Nov 14, 2003"
4.59,11.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: This was probably my favorite beer of the tasting and a pleasant surprise. This is the beer Chimay Bleu wants to be. Pours a brownish-amber color with a medium thick beige head. Lots going on in the aroma - fruit, malt, port wine and caramel. Nicely rich body with a complex blend of malt, grain, chocolate, raisins and spicy alcohol. The finish is sweet toffee and malt. Outstanding.","Dogbrick","Oct 14, 2003"
4.67,13.6,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Carefully poured from the lees, its clear mahogany body rests gently beneath a short, creamy head of light tan foam as very tiny bubbles steadily rise up to support it. The head drops shortly to a wide collar and lacy surface covering, but also leaves some wide rings of sticky lace about the glass. The nose welcomes you with a delicious combination of chocolate covered raisins and caramel splashed with sweet red wine and backed by some earthy and leafy hops. As it warms some candyish - and also peppery - yeast character comes into play adding greatly to its complexity. The body is medium/light, and combines with its very fine, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning to leave it just lightly zesty on the tongue before fading smoothly away. The vinous character of the nose is immediately recognized in the flavor along with assorted dark fruits (plum/prune, dates), a soft note of chocolate, and a sweet light caramel that morphs into a harsher note of molasses that's less refined and a bit edgy at the finish (due in part to alcohol, and in part bitterness). It lingers with some alcohol that fades to reveal the true hop bitterness; then some candy sweetness (bubblegum); and finally a last note of caramel that's charged with delicate clove-like spiciness. Quite complex, rich and flavorful! And although the alcohol could be slightly more restrained, its sweetness is impeccably balanced and never interferes or build on the palate. An impressive brew that's well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Sep 23, 2003"
3.93,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer was served to me in an interesting goblet with the beer logo on the side. A dark, dark brown beer with an initial (though not long lasting) tan creamy head. The beer is quite sweet with lots of caramel notes. A bit of toffee as well, and a finish that is lightly bitter. The bitter seems to be as much from the high alcohol as from the hops. It has quite a thick body that gently caresses and coats the mouth in it soothing embrace. This is quite a good beer, A dark contemplative brew that is great as a rainy Belgian afternoon snack.","Gueuzedude","Sep 03, 2003"
4.37,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I enjoyed the tripel so much I had to try the dark offering from this fine brewery. The deepest crimson-brown with little trace of light through the glass. Smells are abundant, mostly sweet malts, rum raisin, maple syrup, figs, slight phenol from the alcohol. Tastes are sweet with a variety of flavors on the palette that reflect the nose--Raisins, figs, maple syrup (nice thick mouthfeel), maybe some currant to round out the sweetness. This beer is all sweet and it hides the 11% alcohol well in the taste, although you quickly feel the effects. Overall, not the best dark belgian I've had, but certainly worth a try, and I could drink a 750ml by myself anytime.","TripelJ","Aug 23, 2003"

3.15,-23.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Very dark brown. Actually black from many angles. The biege head is fizzy and weak. The aroma is faint - sweet, slightly citric. Flavor is surprisingly light considering color. Sweet but not cloying. A bit of wood. Don't let it get too warm however as the sweetness grows and becomes sticky. Works well with sweet foods, however. Far from dry in any sense of the term. Far from bad but is a bit wimpy, which lets the sweetness run wild.","aracauna","May 27, 2003"

4.5,9.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It comes in a 750 ml green bottle with a nice looking label. It's caged and corked. The cork says 10-2002, and the back of the bottle says 09-07, apparently the ""serve by"" date. It pours a beautiful dark brownish-red, sort of a deep cherry. The head comes out strong and fades a bit but leaves a decent trace of lace on the glass. The smell is a very complex combination of ripe fruit and that musty Belgian smell that's so welcoming. The taste is plum and raisin and most certainly on the sweet side, yet without being cloying. The mouthfeel is on the creamy side and makes the experience even more enjoyable. The beer is certainly strong, but the 11% abv does not overwhelm the beer and it's quite drinkable. This is a very nice beer.","mickeymac","May 18, 2003"
3.85,-6.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I had the Kasteel triple recently, and loved it. One of the best beers I've ever had. This one, unfortunately, is just too sweet for me. Of all of the Belgian beers I've had, this is the sweetest. Pours a beautiful, dark brown with a prominent foamy head. Nice, foamy lace, some head remains throughout. Hard to describe the taste, being that the sweetness is so prevalent. I feel great while drinking this beer. It leaves me (predictably) with a wonderful, warm feeling. But, with all of the great alternatives, I am not likely to buy this one again. (On the positive side, my wife (who doesn't drink beer), tried it and kind of liked it. Now I can get her to sample some other beers!)","JohnnyDuvel","Feb 13, 2003"
4.75,15.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Above review from a tap sampling at Bryant Lake Bowl. Just had a 750ml bottled I'd been saving, this one labeled as ""Donker-Foncee", and I echo my previous statements: this is one incredible brew. Just wish I could find more bottles around here!","feloniousmonk","Feb 01, 2003"
4.56,10.9,4.5,3.5,5,4.5,5,"Crystal clear deep garnet hue, w/ a head that quickly dissipates into a tight tan ring due to the high apparent alcohol content.  Spotty isolated bubble inlands are left.  The aroma is dominated by vinous, alcohol soaked dark fruit w/ a contrasting dark caramel and chocolate malt.  Hint of dry, coffeeish roasted barley is present as well.  Earthy Styrian Goldings hop nose. When combined with the light clove phenol, bubblegum esters and pleasantly peppery alcohol the nose knows this is a potent Belgian.  Unfortunately, there's a slight hint of lightstruck derived mercaptans (curse of the green bottle) that prevents the aroma from acheiving greatness.  Assertive, molasses like, dark candi sugar sweetness is perceived initially in flavor, then is ceded by a melange of dark, dried fruit including raisin and sugary dates.  The dark fruitiness then melds with dark caramel malt, light chocolate and pseudosweet alcohol to lend an overall impression of bourbon soaked chocolate cake.  Yeast derived flavors emerge late and mirror their presence in aroma, consisting of clove and mild bubblegum.  Ethanol flavors are well controlled, w/ only slight peppery notes percpetible.  Hop bitterness is paltry and leaves malt sweetness virtually unhindered, yet sweetness doesn't become cloying, due to this brew's inherent complexity.  Moderately bodied, w/ a sugary and dextrinous mouthfeel.  Finishes both sweet and lightly roasty, with enveloping alcohol warmth surfacing concomitantly.  Kasteel Donker is a tremendously flavorful brew.  Although sweet all around in character, the sweetness is multi faceted and contrasted by both yeast esters and mellow dark grain.  Considering its strength, the drinkability is supreme.  Donker is an oxy moron of a brew-- ballsy and refined.  Bottled 8/2001.","marc77","Oct 16, 2002"

This is the port wine of beer. Rich complex, malty without being sweet. I have one left in my cellar and the distributor has been out for the last 6 months. Dear god I hope they get more in time! I would put this head to head against any trappist for malt complexity, enjoyability, and price.","mattmaples","Oct 16, 2001"
