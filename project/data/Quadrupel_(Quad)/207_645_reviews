" Absolutely top!"

""

"Dark dried fruits all around. Served straight out the fridge and the carbonation took away from the taste. Opened up as it warmed. Lots of raisin, fig, prune in this one"
"I never understood the Reinheitsgebot until I drank this beer, now it makes perfect sense; This isn't beer!! don't waste your money"

"O: Very impressed, very complex, changes as it warms, very drinkable. I avoided imports especially Belgian beers because I think there are great beers made in America, but, there is something special about Belgian beers, and in my humility, I must admit that this is a world class beer, a must try if you want to taste something outside your comfort zone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel I may have had a bad one...need to try again, flavor was off not quad like, old maybe?"
""
""
""
""
"There is so much flavor in this beer it is ridiculous! This is easily one of the best tasting beers I have ever had!"
""
""
""
""
""
"this is my favorite quad so far..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Take it with a grain of salt but it's too sweet, boozy with a touch of licorice.  Not a fan of many quads and I relaize this is at the top of its class so me not liking the style isn't a knock on an outstanding beer."
""
""
"Color is dark brown, with a beige head. The aromas of caramel and malt are dominant. Dark chocolate, plums and raisins can be distinguished in the taste, combined with a tender vinous touch. Although the beer has an ABV of 11,3%, it is very smooth to drink. Top class beer. Best beer I ever drank."
""
""
"Good good god god good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An absolute wild rush of flavor."
""
"My favorite beer on Earth for over 15 years and counting. Will leave a proper review some time, but for now just understand this may be the most complex and delicious beer you may ever get a chance to drink, and the only beer I have ever had that earns a perfect 5/5 BA score."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, a little sharp on the finish. Good flavors and palate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"ABV is 11.30% and is extremely well hidden."
""
""
"Overall: Very well made beer, extremely accessible and one I would go to over and over for the style. One of the best made quads on the planet and worthy of the high ratings. Very complex but has enough clean finish to make it worthy of looking out for. Definitely check this on out. It does not drink the abv that it is labeled as. The Belgians really do know what they are doing!"
"Amazing - best beer experience I've ever had."
""
""
""
"clove and dark fruit permeate both the aroma and the palette, but the brew is frothy yet goes down very smooth & easy.  Has a very warm, embracing spice profile to complement the fig and plum bread flavor."

"-amazing beer love the taste and the complexity, minus a little over carbonated everything about this is top quality and what i imagine a Quad to taste like"
""
""
"It does go down Heavy though."
""
"One of the best worth the $8 a bottle for 11.2oz. This would defently be part of my last meals if i was on death row. The after taste that sticks around your mouth and you can inhale into you're lungs is amazing. Love this beer!!!"
""
""
""
""
"2/22 Bottle - Incredible beer! Very nice dark brown pour, nice head, very thick texture. Nice fruit and caramel smell. Excellent tasting beer, very nice strong kick going down. Quadrupels are among my favorite beers, and this one was one of the best I have ever had. Highly recommended!!!"
""
"Phenomenal.  An astounding, big, carbonated, full bodied, pungent, delicious Quad."
""

"Pours hazy brown with a finger of dense, creamy head. Yeasty esters, bread, and lightly caramelized sugar take the nose.Tastes of bread, almost no alcohol (truly remarkable at over 11+%), and a slight sweetness make this the finest example of the style. This is the best brew in what’s also my favourite style, and thus is the best beer I’ve ever experienced."
"From bottle to disposable hotel coffee cup. Beautiful ruby color. Virtually no head. Smells of raisins and malt. Light carbonation. Delicious."

"O: One to sip slowly, it certainly wants to warm up a little coming out of the fridge. Quite strong, but presents itself beautifully as every sip evolves in the mouth and leaves you wanting more. Not cheap, but worth every penny."
"Every sip seems to bring new flavors.  This beer keeps you coming back for more while drinking it so I could definitely see drinking several more of these in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect balance and great looks. Needs a slow pour to leave the sediment behind and not in your glass. Wonderful beer will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Take your time with it and enjoy it."
"Pours a deep brown murky like a swamp with a short lasting tan head. The aroma is big dark fruits, toffee and alcohol esters. The flavor just takes that to another level. The body is surprisingly light, with a nice mouthfeel and spa smooth finish. Everything you want from a quad."
"Similar in profile to the Rochefort 8, dark muddy brown in color. Flavor is similar but definitely can taste the EtOH in this one. Slightly more bitter/dry flavor than the 8 with more complexity. Same dry fruits but with less esters? A great dark belgian ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff."
"Best beer I've had so far.  Poured into a Belgian Goblet, about 3in of head from pour, 2in staying after first sip.  Smells caramelly sweet, tastes a strong burning alcohol, with a sweetness of dates upfront, and a caramelly finish.  Sooo strong and complex yet soooo smooth and tasty.  Just absolutely everything you could want."
"It was ok. Don't see what is so special though."
"The best Quad I've had.  Deceptively powerful with complex dark fruit & spicy flavors.  After buying one, I bought my local package shops entire stock left to cellar and enjoy throughout the year."
""
"Overall: really outstanding example of a good Belgian ale, one of my personal favourite styles, with amazing aroma and flavours that encourage far too rapid consumption; pair this with an equally intricate dessert - I'm imagining a cheesecake with a chocolate cookie crust topped with berries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of floaties going on but a great beer. My gf and her friend also took to it and want to drink it lol But at $8 a bottle, i'll keep this one to myself. Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Awesome quad that is a must to try. With out a doubt one of my favourites"
""
""
""
"Not a huge Trappist fan but this is a very good Quad"
""
"I had no idea what to expect when popping this bottle aside from a recommendation from a reliable friend of mine to try trappist beers. Pouring it out, the khaki head was thick, but eventually went down quite a bit (though never completely dissipating). Looking in the glass, it was fast apparent that this is the opposite of a well-filtered beer, with little bits dancing about in the carbonation. Color is very pretty; depending on the angle of the light hitting it, it can display mahogany or rosewood tones. The flavor has a sweetness to it that stays in my mouth, the kind of complex sweetness that a dried fruit like a date or a raisin has. No hops to speak of, but maybe a little bit of alcohol on the back end. The flavor is rich and complex, without being overpowering, and that is part of what makes this beer such a pleasure. That combined with the beautiful appearance and the aroma (with notes of dried date and rich caramel) show the obvious master craftsmanship that went into the making of this brew."
"I guess this beer is not my style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Warning. Maybe you could end KO in the floor after this shot."
"Wood, dried dark fruit, alcohol, brown sugar, cherry, almond, herbs. While I am partial to and most passionate about American craft beer, I can't imagine a domestic attempt packing as much complexity and drinkability into such a beer as this. Playful carbonation. A must try and well worth the price."
""
""
""
""
"All other quads pale in comparison...this is the Standard"
"Excellent, smooth taste. Good for relaxing times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark honey color with sediment all up in the glass.  Boozey caramel nose. And a Boozey caramel flavor. Sweet.  Tasty.  Bubbly creamy mouthfeel. Those Belgians kill it!"
""
""
"Amazing brew, and widely available. No reason not to seek this one out."
""
""
"V - Low value, almost 13 dollars for a single 11.3oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth the money, enjoy a few"
""
"Great head right out of the bottle. Was from the fridge so I hope I don't break the rules on a Belgian Ale. Creamy and sweet. Light carbonation. Greenish on the backside with a warming flavor from the high AV. Brown bananas, carmel, tasting a different hoppy flavor like the Christmas release from an English ale. They use fuggle and golding hops I think, but a similar flavor."
"O: You wanna be a beer snob or not? Lacking the Belgique funk of Orval. Less in your nose and face than Trois Pistoles. Beautiful. Share with a non-beerliever and hype it for the magnificent ale she be!!"
""
"One of the best beers I've had"

""
""
""
""
""

"Just a fantastic beer. Old Stock Ale from North Coast was my favorite but this is now number one."
""
"Very balanced. Cola, dark fruits. Long aftertaste"
""
""
"I like everything about it but might wish for ""more", in other words."
"The king of Belgian beers. A must have and fairly easy to find."
"I'm new(ish) to these sort of style of beers, be that any Belgian type. However,  since reading the reviews from the BROS and having somewhat of an understanding of what this is supposed to taste like, I THINK it's pretty spot on. Given that I haven't much experience with this type of beer, it very enjoyable. I gave some to my mother to try as well (which is someone who doesn't know the first thing about different beer styles at ALL) :) and she loved it. This is a beer that you have to try in order to give a review. I suppose it will taste different to everyone given the tremendous complexity of it, but just my two cents, it's worth trying a few or more in order to fully appreciate this wonderfully well rounded Beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of the best beers I have ever tried, maybe the best one, and the best beer from trappistes rochefort brewery! Strongly recommend this amazing quadrupel beer"
""
"A lot of hype surrounding this beer but I wasn't that impressed with the taste.  Maybe I need to try this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Everything you would want in a beer. A perfect composition! A Mozart of beers!"
""
""
"Overall: in my head I had this one pegged as a perfect 5. I've had Rochefort 8 and 6 before and I had to try the 10 when I saw it on the shelf. I was disappointed with the appearance of this one. It is just a dull brown beer that has little to no head while you drink it. This is in part because of the high alcohol content but it would be nice to see more of a head on this one. Not the best beer I've had this year but a classic example of a Trappist Ale."
"Note: Everything about this beer improves the closer it gets to room temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent taste for a monk beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While a very good beer, I expected more. I anticipated the two years of age to bring out more flavors and contribute to its complexity. The flavors were just too subdued and left my palate too quickly. Perhaps two years is not the ideal aging time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"too much wine character for me"
"This beer is definitely a work of art.  The flavor profile is so dense.  It's the pinnacle of the Trappist beers I've tried.  My only small gripe: The taste of alcohol was a bit much for me.  It overpowered the beer, IMO.  It's possible I was using an unsuitable glass that concentrated the alcohol vapor. (Spiegelau Witbier glass) I would definitely like to revisit this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this a lot -- quite a bit more than Rochefort 8."
""
""
""
"O: It's a tasty quad (and still one of my favorite Belgians overall).  Readily available and consistently delicious.  I feel like this is the easiest gateway between whisk(e)y drinkin' and craft beer drinkin'.  Would love to see how this ages but can tell the brewers put enough care into this to wait until this was ready for our tasting."
"Final Thoughts: While it didn't quite impress as much as their #8 did, this is another solid offering. I sincerely hope #6 makes it to the LCBO at some point, because this was excellent. I wonder if these monks considering trying their hand at a Tripel. Thumbs up."

"The color is pitch black. The scent is huge with lots of raisins and plums. The taste is extremely rich. All the flavors forms what is almost an orgasm in your mouth. I absolutely love this beer."
""

""
""

""
"The legend is true. This is THE BEST BEER I've ever had. I was expecting to be underwhelmed. It took effort to find. It was all worth it. Can Westvleteren possibly be even as good as this?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great example of what a quad can be when everything comes together."
""
"If you could only have one beer in your lifetime, this would be a good choice."
""
"This was my first quad, and I was a bit worried that due to my inexperience, I wouldn't be able to appreciate it. How wrong I was. This is the best beer I've ever had. No weak points here, and has some superior drinkability for any beer, made even crazier by its ABV. Truly sensational."
""
"Classic deliciousness from Rochefort. Caramel, toffee, butterscotch creaminess that makes your whole body happy."

"A beautiful looking, smelling, and tasting beer. The only problem is it stings the mouth a bit, not from the alcohol, but from the aggressive carbonation. It isn't a bad thing for everyone, but it's a bit too aggressive for me. It's still an absolutely stunning beer that everybody should enjoy at least once."

"Mega complex and tasteful Belgian beer. Has flavor for days. Had a Boston bean taste, with dark fruit and banana on the back end.  I could probably pull flavors out for days, overall this Belgian beer is high volume and complex beyond imagination. Worth a pick up, even at steep price~"

"Shame I've only found it in these little 0.33L bottles.  I would hoard magnums of this baby if they sold them.  This is Bond Villain quality beer, if you serve this to someone who is a true beer lover, you will gain major beer cred."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This beer also brewed from malted barley and non-malted cereals, is sweeter in its smell and taste than the no 8. The first sip has serious nip of alcohol though still not over powering and there is a much sweeter taste to it than the no 8 so that this one is closer in flavour to a Leffe. Unlike a Leffe however the taste lingers for a while. Again proceed with caution this is a strong drink and should not be taken lightly. It also has a lot of bubbles so this one also tingles on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appears to be a dark red/copper with a fleeting light brown froth which forms an even ring around the inside of the glass. Smells of intense licorice/anise with hints of warm spice and a wet earthiness. Tastes of warm brown sugar coated raisins. On the finish there is a light, dark, herbal taste with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is noteworthy in that it is lighter than expected with noticeable carbonation."
""
"Ok, not the style that I prefer, but I will give my honest opinion of the style and taste. Pours a decent creamy head at approx. 50 degrees F. Color is very deep and very little light is able to penetrate. Sediment is definately present and beer needs to settle after pouring because of the bottle conditioning. Aroma is of dark fruits and malt sweetness. Taste is full of raisins and malt sweetness. Balance is way better than I expected. Alcohol taste is definately present due to the 11.30% ABV. Overall, a great sipping beer, One is enough, but I will have to say, this is a world class beer"

"One of my favorite beers! Dark color with minimal head. Taste of dark fruits. Really good!"
"Out of the three Rochfort efforts I’m going to have to say 8 is my favorite followed by 10 then 6.  I felt like 8 had a great balance of aroma / flavor and strength to carry this type of beer. The beer itself isn’t exactly my style, but when on a pilgrimage to some of the world’s most legendary breweries, you going to find some of them are more legend than anything else."

""
""
"maybe i just had a bad/old bottle, but this was entirely too boozy to be very enjoyable. tasted like rum. i certainly want to revisit, as it had been a while since i had one, and this is not how i remembered it tasting. so take this review with a grain of salt."
""
""
""
"O:  4.00"
""
""
""
"Overall it is an exceptionally well balanced beer, and truly surprising that it has such a high ABV. The particular fruit notes do not fit my personal taste, but it is undeniable the it is an artfully crafted beverage."

"I guess I just don't love the style. I've had it a few times and I still don't get how this is so highly rated. It's a really well made beer that's obvious, but I swear I taste mold every time I drink it. I'm glad I've tried it but no more for me."

"Beervana. Have been looking for this for several months when I finally found it and snatched it up. Chilled it to about 60°, then poured into a tulip glass. Appearance dark brown with a bit of reddish hue, half inch of fine small bubbled head, and good lacing. Some yeast sediment which aided in dispersing carbonation. Smell is amazing. Great Belgian yeast Aroma, brown bread, dark cherries, and a hint of brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Complex, with dark fruits, cola, toasted brown bread, and grape nuts giving way to a tart cherry and dried plum, with a bit of alcohol heat, but not what you'd expect, considering the ABV. Finished sweet and rich, with a lingering raisin toast flavor that faded towards coffee and burnt sugar, in a good way. I believe that this is the best beer I have ever had, and I've had quite a few trippels and quads, but this is simply outstanding. Wish it was more readily available."

"ever since reading about Trappist beers, I've always wanted to get my hands on one. being that I come from a long line of priests and a bishop, it made the style even more intriguing. I figured I would never find one, at least in my area. well, I took a trip to ocean city, MD and made a stop at Anthony's with the intent on finding a bottle of something new. sitting on the top self was a bottle of the Trappist beer 2nd on my list, don't think I will ever see a westvletern XII. I couldn't wait to get home and try it! I poured it into a silver goblet used by my grandfather (who was a bishop). all I can say about this beer is it is truly amazing....everything about it! definitely at the top of my list. there's beers out there on my favorites that are based a lot off of my personal drinking experience. For instance, erdinger because of the one I had in a small bar in Munich that opened my mind to German beers and even rolling rock (yeah, its a favorite) because it reminds me of my grandfather. however, this beer is my number one solely on taste, can't imagine there's a better beer out there."

"The taste is wonderful. It is a little boozy but it is 11.3% ABV. The flavor is mysterious. I saw another reviewer give a taste profile of ""rum"" and I'm totally getting that. There's a rum taste, dark fruit (raisin, cherry, prune), and malt. I love these sort of beers. The totally opposite of hoppy beer (YUCK!). No hop presence, just sweet maltiness. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer did live up to expectations. I am not a fan of beers that are best when served warm so I was glad to note that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 retained most of its delectable nuances at cold temperatures. It's thick, heavy, with a super strong ABV but not overpowering in any of the above categories. It is a drinkable beer (more than expected from a Belgian at 11.3% ABV) that has a nice sweet flavor that would pair with heavy foods such as steak or a good pasta dish. Not to be taken lightly or consumed before a hearty meal or followed by a lesser beer. This is a dessert beer, one to finish with, perhaps with a cigar or during captivating conversation with close friends. I would dare say this would be a better pairing with a fine steak than even the best cab. I look forward to reviewing more Belgians, especially those from Trappistes Rochefort."

"Much like the Chimay line of beers, and other Trappist brews, the blasé appearance of the bottle belies the complex flavor that lies within. It smells heavily like sugar, probably brown, and anise seed. It tastes heavily fruity, like a carbonated brandy, and is very yeasty. Goes pretty well with some Machego cheese and some hard salami. It's also got a pretty high alcohol content, around 11%, but the kick's somewhat delayed as it's just so darn tasty and toasty you don't really notice the wallop it packs 'til later."

"O: I don't buy 11.3% ABV for a second. Rarely have I found anything (liquor included) that I would call ""too boozy," but this beer is too boozy. It overwhelms the other flavors, and together they overwhelm the palette. Maybe it's just this batch, but I expected far better."

"Pours dark, opaque brown with thick tan head. Nose is mostly dominated by fruit. Smells of cherry, plum, and some yeast. Really has my mouth watering. Taste is intense. Not getting any of the stone fruits until right towards the end. Starts with a hint of malt sweetness, proceeds very, very quickly to a facepunch of alcohol. The 11.3% ABV is no secret here. Mouthfeel is as full as you would expect from a quad. Overall, the alcohol was maybe a bit too assertive for me, but it mellowed as the beer got closer to room temp. Not an every day drinker for me, but next to a nice meal, this would be quite nice."

"O: 4.25 A great quad. One of the best examples of the style. The flavors (and especially the aroma) are a bit too mild for me, so I think I prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O: An extremely complex beer. That being said I prefer the 8 because i find it has everything I love in this beer but minus the killer ABV and it has a bit more of a nutty flavor. Great beer though and a true classic, would be even better no doubt with some age."
""
""
"Overall - An epic brew; easily one of the tastiest beers I've had so far. So full bodied and rich...so complex. At a seemingly non-existent 11.3% ABV, this bad boy is straight up dangerous. If it wasn't $5 for that 12 oz bottle I'd buy a whole lot more regularly. What's up with the chunky mud look though? Makes me wonder if I had an old bottle or something: I'll just have to buy more and see. If It was an old bottle - I can say this brew ages beautifully."

"Great quad, I think I had this one a little too warm, but will try again."

"The taste is subtle and smooth, taste like heaven in a glass with a rich texture and a lovely mouthfeel. The taste lingers for a while allowing you to mellow in it as you slowing consume the goblet, never wanting this to end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a goblet glass with much more head than expected (probably 3 finger head), but it dissipated down to a light bubble covering rather quickly. Aromas of dark fruits, plum, and slight chocolate. Taste also includes the dark fruits and complex malt character along with a decent amount of alcohol. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thick with ample carbonation. Very pleasant, but not outstanding, especially for the price."
""
""
""

"O - Great Quad as you would have guessed from the rating. Hopefully more breweries start making Quads. If so, Rochefort 10 is the beer that they should be trying to live up to. Prost!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark purple brown with a nice head. Smells great. Lot's of brown sediment at the end and tons of white particles and bits throughout the beer. The first thing I notice is the 10% abv. Wow this thing has a kick. Has great mouthfeel and the beer really coats your entire mouth. Goes down smooth with a very strong alcohol burn. Lot's of substance. A great magnificent beer."

""
""
""
"Pours a thin beige head, deep brown almost black color, average carbonation. Nose of plums, raisins, figs and caramel. Taste is sweet and soft with the mentioned sweet fruits and caramel but comes with some licorice, mocha and alcohol. A little too sweet for my liking."

"Overall:4.0- In spite of all its less than perfect notes, this is a truly outstanding beer and better taken as a whole than as the sum of its parts. Refreshing, somewhat dry and without a hint of the 11% ABV it packs, this an excellent Belgian beer and while not the best example of the style, it is still worth a try if you have never sampled it before."
""
""
"O: Fun drink; would recommend this to anyone as a nice sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown pour with a solid beige head and lots of floating yeast sediment. Aroma is light but pleasant, hinting at the flavors to come. Taste is full of dark fruits; notes of raisin, plum, prune, currants, and a hint of chocolate. Texture is rich, moderately heavy and very smooth. Overall, this didn't blow me away quite to the degree I expected, but still a fantastic beer. Beautiful and complex balance of flavors, and so rich and smooth."

"Bottle 33cl 2 the years drunk in its glass chalice. The beer is brown with small white head, a lot of deposit in bottom of bottle. It is aqueous. It inhales the yeast. In mouth it is real one pleasure to savour it . Well balanced with a taste of candy sugar and of Madeira a bit of cherry. This exceptional beer is on another planet."

"O - This beer does pretty much everything right. You can tell this recipe has been carefully crafted by the monks over the centuries. It does not disappoint. The beer hides the high alcohol incredibly well. A bottle of this would be divine with a slice of Belgian chocolate cake..."
""
"Dark brown in color; opaque. Decent rich head when poured, though dies down relatively fast. Sweet, malty smell - though faint. Delicious, full malty sweet taste. Sweet finish. Easy to drink. Medium to heavy body. Nice light carbonation. Wanted another when I finished! Great Belgium beer!"

"O: This would be a great after dinner drink, but it could fit anywhere, really. Delicious and satisfying, and very drinkable for the ABV. I'd reccomend this to anybody who loved beer. I'll definitely be buying more. A+"
""
""
"This is such a great trappist brew that whenever I drink it I feel like a merry monk. Yes the ABV % is high but the flavor of this brew is full variety of flavors. It has a very smooth texture for me. The sediment is also interesting, it has a nice coloration and once it hits you towards the end of the drink it adds a subtle complex flavor that can only be expected from a trappist. Some trappist style brews do not have as nearly the great flavor as this one does, so this one for me is a favorite among trappist style brews."
""
""
""
"O: Although there isn't any aspect of this beer that I would say is the best for any beer that I have ever had, it is so well balanced and continuously brings hints of new and intriguing flavors that all work so well together, for that reason this is one of the best beers I had had in recent memory."

Tastes of plums, light cocoa, a nice light bitter balance, apricot, vanilla bean. Medium bodied, a wee bit over carbonated but not undrinkable. Very solid quad"

Aroma has lots of brown sugar, caramel, and some vanilla mixed with fruit, some sort of dried candied fruit - plum perhaps. Taste is quite pleasant. Lots of sweetness but not overdone and is certainly well balanced - follows the nose very well. Delicious!"

"330ml bottle. Chimay Chalice glass. Deep brown, foggy appearance. Tan foam, lasting crown & sticky lacing rings. Belgian yeast, sugary alcohol -rum like-, toasted malt & coffee aromas to the nose, rounded by prunes & raisins, hints of vanilla & spices. Rich upfront shows toasted malts & raisins. Full body. Soft carbonation. Dense & silky texture. Dried fruit notes, candies & bitter cocoa in the middle - Winter cake like-. Kind alcoholic heat but no acidic sensation. Long sweet/bitter finish. Smooth & flavorful. Great company for a paused drink !!"

"Overall I thought This was very good beer and a very good example of a quad it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but I still found it to be pretty unique for the style and it kind of has it's own thing going on that i haven't seen in other quads. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little rich, a little creamy, a little filling and the tasting did a great job at holding my attention, I would be pretty happy sipping on a couple of these especially on a cold winter night. What I like the most about this beer was how it wasn't like a lot of quads that I've had but it still stayed very true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it is a little expensive, but that's to expected with most of these good Belgian beers. I would for sure buy this beer again, I would like to keep a couple in the cellar, but the price would prevent me from buying a lot of it. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, I think every craft beer drinker should try this beer. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I have no clue why it took me so damn long to try this beer, but I'm glad i finally did and I won't be sleeping on the one anymore. So far this just might be my favorite Quad and it's for sure one of the best ones I've have had. The only one from them I have left to try is the 8 so I will have to pick one of those up soon. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer, keep up the great work."

"The beer pours a light tan head that dissipates fairly slowly. The beer itself is an obscure dark purplish brown with bits of yeast gobules in it. The beer has a fairly complex smell to it. A hoppy smell dominates the nose but with notes of dark fruits. The dark fruits appear to be prunes but are very faint. In addition to hops and dark fruits, the smell has a fairly peppery and salty smell as well as hints of sugar to it. The taste resembles the smell fairly strongly. The taste has a stronger pepper taste with hints of hops but with faint traces of dark fruits. The taste is fairly complex with subtle notes that can easily escape a person's palate if they're not too careful. The mouthfeel is fairly surprising. The beer itself is heavy bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation but feels light compared to other Quads. Overall ,a very good beer and worth getting and enjoying."

"This is about perfect. Not even a hint of soapiness that other high scoring belgians can deliver. The 11.3% ABV is hardly noticeable. Very subtly complex. For fans of Gulden Draak Quad 9000 or St. Bernardus ABT 12. This may oust both of those for me."
""
""
""
"This was my favorite Belgium beer until I tried I tried Westy 12. This has a great aroma and taste. It has a powerful kick to it but a nice and smooth aftertaste. I like this beer cold but not ice cold. The 10 is by far the best of the rochefort beers."

"This beer has complex aroma of malty fruity smell. My initial impression was that I was drinking a grape soda. The fruitiness of this beer is in the front. But it's gets more complex set of flavors after the head sets in which it went fast . I think it's a tad sweet for my liking. I would recommend you let it sit for a few minutes before drinking. Cheers"

"o- I ordered this at an early family dinner not realizing the alcohol content until a few sips in. I started to feel the magic of this wonderful brew after only a few sips. besides a slight warming effect, you really don't taste the alcohol. my only complaint is the aroma could be a little stronger. other than that, the taste and mouthfeel are just what I expected from a trappist beer. will definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I had this for the first time a few months ago out of a chilled bottle poured into proper glassware and it captured my imagination completely. Upon a repeat purchase (well actually 1 of 6 bottles since Rochefort 10 is seasonal around these parts), It lived up to the expectations I maintained for every bottle of this world-glass beer as constructed in my head based on that first experience last summer. A true treat (for my birthday this time) worthy of all the praise it gets and a beer that you shouldn't miss the opportunity to try if you get the chance."

"Our group of 4 Beer Advocate members did a recent small bottle tasting of high alcohol brews. Among the 12 brews tasted was; Trappistes Rochefort 10 Belgium Ale. We did a direct comparison tasting of the Rochefort 10 against the Westvleteren XII. The Rochefort 10 was chosen the better 3 to 1, and tied for 4th highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.25. Smoothness being the deciding factor between the the Rochefort 10 and the Westvleteren XII. The Westvleteren XII came in 9th of the 12 brews tasted with an average score of at 3.81."

"Pours a dirty brown, mahogany color with some copper and ruby hues where the light strikes it. A thin veil of off-white head develops, lingers briefly, and then dissipates to a patchy collection of bubbles across the surface of the glass. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of candied brown sugar, plum, date, raisin, some toffee, more ubiquitous dark fruits, and caramel. A distinct belgian yeast aroma is also present alongside subtle clove. The taste begins with a bit of the brown sugar before a rush of fruit comes through - dark, raisin, plum, date, and even some grape. A nice yeasty funk and some straw finishes it off. Mouthfeel is full bodied but not too viscous, thanks to adequate carbonation. It is lively, and finishes dry with some of the fruity flavors lingering on the palate. Overall, this is a phenomenal belgian quadruple that is absolutely worthy of praise and attention. Well balanced, full of flavor, and simply an excellent brew."

"Fantastic! One of the better beers you'll ever have. A great nutty finish, balanced and smooth. 5 years ago i didn't understand what good beer was. A bottle of this changed my life. A beautiful Belgian ale, at 11.3 % alc, Trappistes Rochefort 10 has got it it going on!"

"This is incredible. I had forgotten how excellent it really is. The look is so fresh, and it's very neat to see a best-used-by date of January 2018. Often, at least in my opinion, beers that cross the 10% ABV line lose a lot of the beer quality for sheer alcoholic punch; basically, an unusual wine taste. This is one of the exceptions. The smell and taste have a sweet and spicy theme. The first smell is grape, and then followed by pepper and spice. I believe the taste does the same, but the pepper is the dominant note. This brew is hard to beat. OF course I will get this again."

"The biggest and darkest of the Rochefort clan, poured into a goblet from the iconic bottle. Color is dark brown, with a decent amount of tan foam but less aggressive carbonation than the 6 and 8, not to mention other Trappist beers. Body is thicker than other Trappists but still falls short of imperial stout or barleywine values. Aroma is rather impressive, milk chocolate, rum, raisins, brown spices, and a blast of alcohol. Smells like a chocolate brownie drizzled with rum sauce. Tastes strong and boozy but quite sweet as well. Brown rye bread and cacao powder, dried dark fruit like dates or figs, caramelized bananas, burnt dark sugar and molasses, ample clove and ginseng spice, culinary herbs ... Wickedly complex and infused with aromatic alcohols. One of the more boozy beers I've had but this works with the other elements. Finishes earthy, woody, and a little tannic like overly steeped tea. Surprisingly complex but I'd say the spicy, earthy elements trump the sweet components in the overall impression. My favorite Trappist ale and widely regarded as one of the world's best beers. The fact that it is easy to find, to the point where some fools derogate it as a ""shelf turd", just means that there is no excuse not to try it."

"330 ml bottle. Pours hazy dark amber with beige head. Aroma is of Belgian yeast, dark fruit, sherry, dark chocolate and herbal hops. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of vinous fruit, caramel, sherry, brown sugar, herbal hops and warming alcohol. Finish is long and semi-dry. Wonderful, complex brew, perfect for cold weather."
""

"Had bottled in a goblet glass. It pours as a very dark color with a tan head that dissipates slowly. The nose is very strong with aromas, with hints of sweetness, alcohol, yeast and some dried fruit. The taste is dried fruits, prunes, figs, plums and a sweet alcohol taste. It is a little lighter then I was hoping. I love this beer. I have to say this is a definite go to now. If you are looking to try something new that is strong, flavorful, aromatic and an overall great beer. Then this is the beer to try"
"A dark mahogany colored liquid with slightly rosy edges and a major stack of light tan colored foam on top. Chunky lacing follows. The nose enjoys spiced yeast that hints at delicate cinnamon allspice and spruce vinegar. Smooth and so tasteful. The flavor ushers in a remarkably smooth creation that is such a beautiful blend that it's really difficult to identify any individual flavors. There's a light molasses/brown sugar and spruce/ juniper idea with a bit of Chardonnay and a touch of nutty maple whiskey. This probably isn't doing this fine world class beer any justice at all but it's a unique and wonderful blend. Carbonation in this solidly medium bodied brew is quite mild yet so proliferated as to convey a fairly lively, yet generally velvety feel. Quite a treat and definitely more refined than the ""8" which I had last week. Ultimately these aren't my favorite flavors, but if they were, it could be a ""5"!"

"O: I am very pleased by this beer. It reminds me of drinking a fine, sweet red wine with all the appeal of a beer. It is a great winter drink as there is a noticeable (but very smooth) alcohol presence and it warms after each swallow a bit like brandy. This was recommended to me by the shop owner, and I am very glad to have tried it. I'm not yet familiar with quads, but look forward to trying more after this. I'd love to know what a fresher one is like, but would still suggest it gladly."

"After finally trying Westvleteren's beers, I would say I may be in the minority in that I prefer Rochefort's beers (in fact, I would say Rochefort is my favorite of all the Trappist breweries as of right now). If I were forced to choose five beers to drink for the rest of my life (assuming quality stayed the same), this would make the list."

"Good beer. Not really my style but understand why people enjoy it. I think the smell is nice with that Belgian barnyard. Again I think this is a beer that should be consumed after sitting on it a couple of years. It is a waste of a beer if you open it fresh. Almost like a wine it is to young and tight fresh. I would by this beer if it was a everyday beer you can get at the store but I do not see my self ever trying to find it."
""
""

"I can see why this is rated so highly, very refined; counter that with not ranging the spectrum of tastes (pretty much stays on the sweeter side), but not lacking a certain complexity within the side of the spectrum it is on."

"Overall: As many times as I've seen this on the shelf, big regret not picking it up any sooner...it is almost the total package but honestly for the eight bucks or so the bottle goes for it is worth every f'n penny. Salud!"

"Overall great! Pretty much a staple for Belgian quad style beer, and at the top of the top of beers in the world altogether, especially ones that I can regularly get. Perhaps the only real flaw is the over carbonation, that's probably due to extra fermenting in the bottle which added a bit of booze and phenols, but softened the beer a lot, plus the yeast chunkies. All around and amazing beer with great characters and great blending of all characters, smooth, rich, delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"I will have to try this one again, after a year in my cellar."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a nice head. It's sweet to the nose with hints of chocolate and cream. The taste is a bit boozy at first (which would be expected with such a high BAC). But wow. The aftertaste saves it. The boozy flavor doesn't last long before it gets replaced by a sweet creamy flavor that crawls up from the back of your throat. The flavor is full bodied and it's a realitively slow drinker. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm not sure that I'd give it a 100, but it's definitely a beer that any craft beer enthusiast should try in their lifetime. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""

"This one certainly lives up to the hype. Beautiful appearance, inviting aroma, subtle yet, delicious flavors and silky smooth mouthfeel. Unfortunately, economics will prevent regular consumption on my part. Truly impressive and certainly a world class brew."

This is a big beer, one you need to savor slowly. Definitely one of the best quads I have had, I can see why this beer is rated as world class."
""
"O - This is one of the best beers I've had to date. It's just so complex and well balanced. It's big in every way without losing its refinement. Rochefort 10 even manages to carry its 11.3% abv with incredible deftness and grace."

"The first thing that hit me was a toasty coffee flavor. Then the smooth, soothing, and subtle lusciousness of chocolate and fig slowly and lovingly caressed my palate. I hope I made it sound as seductive as I felt when I tasted it, because this is a beer worth every penny and I thank my lucky stars that there is another bottle chilling right now. Be selfish with this one, my friends and enjoy one of the best beers that has ever crossed my lips."

""
""
"Overall ... I enjoyed this beer - no shock there. At first I thought the booze was a little strong, but I came to like it as the beer warmed up as I was drinking it. I had it in a bottle, pouring into a chalice. The label says 260116 - which would make me believe it should be enjoyed no later than January 26, 2016. If my understanding is correct, then this beer was bottled in 2011."

"O: A wonderful quad, one of the best. Destroys St. Bernardus Abt 12 out of the water and gives Westy 12 a run for its money. Super sweet and fruity, one of the fruitiest (in a good way) quads I've ever had. Ages well too apparently, flavors meld nicely and it goes down so easily. Great beer."

Taste wise, each was better than the last. I'd say the 8 was most drinkable, and the 10 best overall. This Quad is certainly one to indulge in, or at least try."
""
""
"O: This is for sure the best beer I've ever had until today. I've had some Trappists before this one but this Trappistes Rochefort 10 sets the higher standard."
"O: Had to close my eyes a few times while drinking this one. It practically set off fireworks in my brain. The very sweet malts balanced well with the incredible Belgian yeast. The booze helped me feel like I was enjoying the same brew that some Trappists were drinking a few centuries ago. 10/10 will drink again."

"O: Truly the best Belgian beer I have ever tried, and in my top ten favorite beers of all time. Yes, I've had a Westvleteren 12, but this is better. Whereas the Westy was too carbonated and short-lived like a darker Duvel, the Rochefort is thick, almost Doppelbock-like. A must have."
"O- Well done, but honestly, just too darn sweet. I would much prefer more dark fruits be present in the taste. Lets be honest though, I'm nitpicking a bit."
""
""
"Wow, this was an amazing beer. My first endover into a Tripel. It was had notes of honey, banana, cloves, wheat, and some kind of liquor base, but not 100% sure. I have now had 3 six packs at ruffly $50 a piece. The only reason I don't have this at a 5.0 is because there was a batch that was off. I took it back to the LQ after drinking 3 and had them swap it out with the distributor because it was so bad. I know this brewed small batch style by Monks, so I guess I get it but at $8 a beer I really do expect perfection and often times I get it with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't my style of Quad, I like more dark fruit... That said, it's the best sweeter style quad I've tried."

"O - I've searched long and hard for the Westvleteren 12 and rightfully so as each time I've had the Westy 12 is was out of this world, but each time I go on these searches I think to myself that I have an old friend sitting in every beer store in my area. That old friend has never let me down and constantly reminds me that it deserves the same sort of respect Westy 12 and any other great beer in the world gets. The class this has is unmatched and arguably the best quad in the universe. It's flavors can go 1 on 1 with any in the style and come out on top more than just once. This is as fine as Belgian Trappist ales get and we all know Authentic monk ales have class, but the Rochefort 10 takes class to another level and has remained there a long time now. A true Belgian jewel and a true world class quad that deserves more than what it's handed. Ill drink this til the day I'm no longer here. It's that good."

"O: This is my favorite beer. Drink it any and every chance you get. Incredible in every aspect."

"O - Stunning example of a strong dark Belgian ale. I had it once before and I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed this time around, I was anything but. Really a rich and complex beer. One that must be tried."

""
""
"Overall Impression: tremendous Trappist ale, further evidence that these beers deserve their own special classification. With strong notes of dark fruits and slight spiciness from hops to balance out heavy dark malt bill, this beer packs a punch that will knock you on your ass on the first sip. The heaviness will leave you satisfied but the complexity will leave you intrigued down to the last sip"

"Overall: This is my favorite Quadruple belgian strong ale. It is blended well for the amount ABV it contains. It goes down very smooth for having high gravity of alcohol. This is a special occasion beer, and it is definitely meant to be sipped on."
""
""
""
"This beer lives up to the hype, although the price could have been better... for $6.50 a bottle, this is what I would call a special occasion beer. It pours a nice deep brown, with about a inch to inch an a half beige colored head. First blast of flavor is from the alcohol, and at over 11%, it gives you that almost hot sensation no matter how cold the beer is. Also ,as a side note, I would not suggest serving this beer ice cold. To really get it's nuances, serve it a little warmer around 40-45 degrees. After that there is a taste of caramel and pure heaven. The mouthfeel is very light. I will surely be enjoying this gem again."

"O: This is maybe my third sampling of a quad ever so I wouldn't say that I'm an expert on the style ' but this is easily my favorite of the others. I had this bottle in two sessions. The first time it was slightly over carbonated for my liking, too much like champagne. So I corked it and drank the rest the next day. I also paired it with some smoked Gouda and muenster . Wow what a difference. This quad has so much going on here . Yes it's cliche' but it is indeed very complex in all aspects. Believe the hype, It's that good. You know when you see a picture of a trappist monk and he's always smiling with a red nose and rosy cheeks? Now I know the source of his joy."

It's a perfect beer if you just feel like relaxing, and of course, slowly sipping, on a great beer. Thanks to St. Benedict for setting up monasteries that can brew this great stuff!"
"Honestly the best quad I have ever had. Westy XII is out there somewhere for me to try, but until then this is the bench mark I hold for all top tier quads. Damn this is good stuff. The nose is out of this world with figs, blackberries, raisins, prunes smelling liked they were soaked in a spiced rum and let age in a toasted oak barrel for a few months. Some goes for the flavor, except there is a little more noticeable alcohol on the palate. Either way, I am buying another one of these before the store runs out and letting sit for a few months."

""
"Accolades"
"O - Don't get me wrong, this is a high quality beer. I had extremely high expectations. Reading how highly ranked it was on the website forced me to expect an extreme wow factor, but I think it came up just short. It's definitely worth a try and I would love to have another, but I'm not so sure that it met my lofty expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hard to tell that this is an 11.3% ABV beer (until you've had a few and find standing up to be a bit of a challenge!), pleasure to drink - there seems to be a hint of cherry or some other rich fruit tucked away in the after taste too."
"This is a paradigm Quadrupel that needs no hype because it speaks volumes on its own merit, not to mention that it was made in Belgium. Definitely my new favorite of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've been keeping two of these in the back of the fridge since Christmas. Glad that I finally tried one of the greatest, and well balanced, beers I've tried to date. Certainly worth the hype; and I love the fact that it is readily available in my area."

"Beautiful beer. Dark brown color. Big fluffy head with light brown color. About 2 fingers. Very aromatic. Huge. Smells like plums, raisons, candy, and deep red berries. Flavor is very sweet and rich. It's like cutting in to a slice of cake. It's so tasty! Again, I get flavors of plum, raisons, chocolate, and a little roasted malt. Absolutely fantastic. Very little alcohol flavor and heat. The mouthfeel is heavy, thick, and well carbonated. Not too syrupy, but there is a bit of maple flavor. Overall, this is my favorite trappist/abbey quad. It's just awesome. One of those beers that makes me want to keep coming back for more!"

"O: Well balanced with wonderful dark sweetness and a well hidden ABV. An essential ale on the path to understanding and appreciating Trappist ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This has moved into my current top 5, truly a beer to cherish. At 7.99 a bottle, not something I will drink everyday, but will be buying this over and over again whenever I need a great quad to just sit down and enjoy. If you're familiar with other non-trappist Belgian Ales, such as Duvel, Delirium, or La Chouffe, you'll immediately recognize the signature Belgian yeast tastes, but as a trappist quad, you really are getting an amazingly complex tasting beer used with the finest ingredients. Yea these beers have a lot of hype that i'm sure factors into a lot of reviews, and frankly, all the hype is warranted and well deserved. Looking forward to trying Westvleteren 12 next year when I get to go back to Belgium. My hat is off to these monks that still continue to make and supervise the production of this beer."

"This brown consistant beer is definitely one of the best belgian beer I have ever tasted. Strong alcohol percentage and taste that litteraly leaves you breathless, this beer can be drunk at room temperature, or, naturally, at 5 to 6°C. Both will present totally different tastes. I would harshly recommand to have more than two today, because you're going to hate yourself tomorrow. Also, this should be one of the last beers that you taste today, because it will hide any other smooth beer's taste afterwards - they all might taste like water."

"Overall: One of the greats for sure. It's a tough to write tasting notes for because there's just so much going on. Somehow it doesn't feel overcrowded though. Everything somehow works together and produces a very complex finished product."
""
""
""
"O- A fantastic representation of the style. I enjoy it more than I do the St Bernardus, which is also excellent. You can't go wrong with this...unless you keep drinking it and don't realize how strong it is. Considering it's ABV, it's worth the close to $7 a bottle."
""
"Rather subtle aroma of molasses, chocolate and soy sauce, with a hint of mild acidity. Highly carbonated. The taste is unexpectedly harsh, with the prevailing notes of molasses, dried prune, dark sugar and rye bread, followed by pronounced bitterness and alcohol. Overall, rather disappointing."
"surprisingly much different than expected. Close to flat with a medium body that breaks up nicely across the tongue. Only the faintest touch of detectable alcohol for such a big abv brew. Flavors are sweet, deep, hidden, well blended and pretty balanced. Sweet malts up front followed by a dark fruitiness with a tart belgian candy spike. Woodyness with a big plum and raspberry flavor, a dry yeasty character, faint cherry like medicinals. Alcohol balances the sweetness pretty well but sweetness lingers a bit. Overall a beer that is truly something else, Worth the high price tag. Super complex, incredibly subtle, and super drinkable all at the same time."

"Overall: In my opinion, this is an excellent beer. So many different experiences for the nose, the mouth - just an absolute joy to drink. This is definitely one you want to drink slowly and savor. It seems readily available and though it can be expensive ($6.99 for 11.2 oz, in this area), in my mind it's worth every penny. A perfect beer to break out on a special occasion. This is an absolute favorite of mine and I'd highly recommend trying it to anybody."

"Although I have not tried very many beers I really like this one, and will have it again (I re-review it too), once I have expanded my palate with other beers.

"Deep, dark brown color with a small head that swiftly dwindles to a creamy covering. Aromas of buttery raisin bread, deep malts, apple, fig, plum, tobacco, and vanilla. Dark fruit and malt flavor. Creaminess, brown sugar, moderate sweetness, light chocolate, nuts, black cherry, and vanilla. A hint of woodiness. Moderately carbonated, smooth, fluffy, and warming, finishing dry. Very little booze for its strength. Delightful..."

"Poured into chimay chalice. Pored dark brown with a lingering two finger head. Smell is earthy, dark fruit, some licorice, not super apparent due to glassware. Taste is also earthy, dark fruit, sweet , Belgian yeast. Texture is amazing, silky and smooth, I have o idea how this is 11.3%. This is my first swing at this beer and I am so impressed, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Live life... drink beer!!!:-)"
"Flavors of cola, Tootsie Rolls, strawberries, raisins, brown bread and Nesquick. Body is full, but not quite as much as SB and Westy. I find the cola and licorice flavors to be a bit much and I know I am in the minority on this one, but I find Rochefort 10 to be a bit less delicious than both St. Bernardus 12 or Westvleteren 12. The alcohol pokes out a tad more and the sugars seem more...well...sugary than the deep bready malt/yeast combo the other two offer. That said, this is still a delicious beer that integrates the ABV so well that there will never be a 'cringe' involved…so smooth for an 11+ %’er."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: It's rich, but not as heavy-bodied as you'd expect. A lot of that is from the ample carbonation, but there's a light, almost splashy feel to the beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Really a world-class quad. Perhaps a little too sweet for some people, but so easy to drink, hides the alcohol so well, it's really a treat. $7/12oz means that I won't enjoy this every day, but on special occasion, it's the best quad sold in America, and I'm lucky to have it readily available."

"What a wonderful suprise this beer was. Pours dark brown with plenty of delicious sediment with not much of a head. Carbonation is plentiful. At first smell i get plums or even raisins with some spice to it. The taste confirms it. Wow it was amazing. A light feel was surprising to me but welcomed. One the best beers Ive ever had. Well worth the price."
"O: this is a fantastic example of a Trappist quad. I've had several of the type, including Westy 12, and I have to say this is my favorite. It is just a complete beer...pure and joyful. I just wish it was a little easier to get where I am."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and airy. Overall, this definitely beats out St Bernardus ABT 12, which I love. I think the primary factor is that this isn't as sweet, which lets other flavors come out more."

""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one brawny quad. It's definitely on the sweet side for the style, and it has more body behind it than many of the other Belgian quads I've had. It seems like a sort of brawn rather than brains trade-off. It isn't as nuanced and complex as some of the best quads, yet it's more drinkable despite its size. The alcohol is masked so well that it never occurred to me that this beer is 11.3% abv. That is until I stood up and had to catch my balance. Rochefort 10 is always in the discussion when the 'World's Best Quad' title is debated. It is very good, but now that I've had the time to sit down and cast a more critical eye over it, I don't quite think it's there. It falls just a hair short of its competitors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a good beer, and certainly an experience given it is one of the Beers of Fame, from Belgium, and expensive, but honestly, I think there are plenty of better Quads. Don't get me wrong, it is excellent and highly recommended, but I'd take Three Philosophers over it anyday, especially for the price. But check it out when you get a chance."
"Great beer, classic quad along with St. Bernardus abt 12"

"Beautiful deep plum color with a full beige head that dissipates to thin film. Very nice lacing. Smells of raisin, apricots, and a generally sweet fruity aroma. The taste is amazing, plums, grapes, complex but so smooth, just a little alcohol burn on the end, just right. Medium carbonation and body is perfect for this style, a sticky finish. Among the elite this style. Great."
"Overall: I have had 1 or 2 quads and my life and this brew exemplifies what a quad is. The alcohol is pretty well hidden for a brew with 11% ABV. The complex flavors are fantastic and you can tell that these Belgians put a lot of time into their brews. This makes me want to try a Westy and see how they compare. I'm not sure if I'd buy another one of these at 7-8 bucks a bottle, but I will say that it's definitely worth it. Great job Brasserie de Rochefort in Rochefort, Belgium!"
""
""
"o: For being 11.3% alcohol, this beer is pretty drinkable. It tastes rich without being thick. A good beer, but for me, not in the same league as Westvleteren."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark ruby brown. Decent head with average retention and lacing. Rich aromas, fig, leather. Similar flavors, fig, raisin, walnut, slightly cloying, but not overly sweet. Cloying is usually an unpleasant sensation, but it's not here. I may not be using the correct descriptor for this, but that's the closest I can come up with. Smooth mouthfeel. Pleasant aftertaste."

"Best you'll taste. No skunky smell, no bitter taste, full bodied, no bad aftertaste, nearly sweet hopsy swish. Any change to this recipe would be a decrement."
""
"Overall 5 - The most expensive, the most interesting and also probably the best beer I’ve ever had... in a way. I wouldn't drink this every day and surely more than one at a time is sort of a waste. I would call it a dessert beer for special occasions."

"Paired this with a lamb burger, and I'm pleased I did. This is a ""Telling Stories By a Brick Fireplace in the Dead of Winter with a Hearty Meat Dish"" sorta beer.

"Pours a dark root beer color with a rich, sudsy tan colored head. Tacky foam clings stubbornly to the edges like glue.Competing tartness and sweetness on the nose. The tartness has a cider quality while the sweetness is quite chocolatey. I note some caramel apple in the aroma as well. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that gradually dries just before finish. I pick up a lot of alcohol warmth. Apple, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of brown sugar in the flavor. Just a little overly tart around the edges of the tongue, which throws it out of balance just by that much. The alcohol flavor bitters the finish in an unappealing way. Pretty good, but no Westvleteren."

"O – This is an extraordinary beer. This is one of my first experiences with quads, but I’d like to see what Westy has on this one. It has all the elements I was hoping for in a strong dark Belgian beer and has a fantastic mouthfeel to go along with it. It’s unbelievable how 11.3% ABV is almost nowhere to be found. This finally rounds out my Rochefort journey. I need to get my hands on the other Trappist beers. Beers from the newest brewery of this kind are up next."

"Its about 20 degrees(F) out and I couldn't think of a better beer after a rich winter stew."
""
""
"Overall- wow I could see myself enjoying this with a cigar or towards the end of a heavy meal I think it would pair well with lamb or prime rib any sort of rich savory dish. I don't know if i could handle multiple pours of this one but it does taste pretty darn good. This style can come on pretty strong and can sometimes be too sweet but I am really enjoying it."
""
"Overall: Well at $6 per 11.2oz this is not a bargain but well worth splurging every once in a while. A very nice treat and an excellent example of the style"

"I was impressed with this brew and I do have to say that it lived up to the hype, minus the appearance (the flakes were my fault, but really took away from the whole experience. Next time I'll pour it easier). It was super complex and enjoyable to drink."

"Pours a bronzy dark brown with a thin bubbly foam atop the ale. Aromas are boozy & rich with caramel, candi sugar, earth, spice, ripe dark fruit. Tastes are boozy & sweet with spiciness, fruit, yeast, raisin, rum, brown sugar, molasses, earth, pepper, buttery. Mouth-feel is rich & smooth with plenty of carbonation. Overall, one of the best beers in the world and spot-on for what's expected from the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one tasted a bit too boozy/rum-like for my taste, I prefer a softer, fruitier Belgian dark ale. By no means would I score this a 3, as it's far from an average brew, but in the same vein I can't score it a 5."

""
""

"O: Quite impressive. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this."
""
""
"Overall - Easily the best Quad I've had. I enjoyed this at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia and prior to this tasting, had only been able to try the 8, so finally getting to meet the 10 was a memorable experience. The Rochefort 10 carries an abundance of taste and fills the palate with a variety of dark fruit flavors. Very refreshing feel to it for the style of beer. If you're looking for a world-class quad, this is it."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Colour was very dark copper, almost opaque with auburn edges. One finger tanned head, very good retention. There top of the head had a small scar on it from the pour. Aroma was very pronounced, could be smelled from much further away than usual. I detected musty grape. Tasted caramel, figs, brown sugar, molasses and malt. Booze was so well hidden I wondered if they put the decimal point too far to the right! If it hadn't been for a slight burn at the finish I couldn't have detected any. Texture was moussy, silky smooth and light. Overall amazing. Look, aroma and texture achieved perfection."
""
"O: Sweeter than other quads. Very Very impressive. 11.2% abv but more like a 6-7% beer."
"M: It's a big medium. It's not quite full. Big bottle carbonation."

""
""
"I regret drinking this at a lower temperature and will keep it closer to 60F next time. Very nicely constructed Ale with great range a nice complexities."

"This pours a solid brown color with a foamy beige head. The scent is bold with a mixture of tart fruits and yeast. The taste is smooth, mellow, and light to the taste buds. There is a mixture of sweet malts combined with spices, yeast, and toasted fruits. A very well craft brew that drinks seamlessly without a single flaw. Leaves behind some good lacing and a great aftertaste. If it wasn’t for the cost I’d say more please!"

"World class and deservedly so. Glad to have had the opportunity to drink one!"

"Delicious Belgian Quad worthy of a 5 rating in my opinion. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and the taste is very complex. Has kind of a sweet and tart taste. The fact that it's available year round is a huge bonus. One of the best Belgian ales out there."

"O: this is just as great as the 6 and the 8, it's hard to pick a favorite they are all so delicious in there own way while all sharing some strong similarities."
"O- this just beat Trappistes Rochefort 8. I can't believe this beer is 11.3%, it's to tamed, and the alcohol is almost nonexistant. This thing has all the awesome candy flavors and i want to slap myself for passing on it so many times. I know now that if i'm ever in the mood for a great belgian, i can pick up a 10, and be in bliss."
"Overall, beautiful brew. The complexity is overshadowed by the simplicity fashion when it hits the palate. Highly recommend it if you like dark beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an exceptional beer, one of the best Quads out there. Maybe a little expensive, afterall I could get a 750ml bottle of Chimay Grand Reserve for a dollar more where I live, but it is well-deserved of its praise."

"O- I think this is a real solid quad, not the best I've ever had but can't complain about too much, flavor is there, nothing offending in appearance or consistency, I'd buy again"

"wOW, Wow. Get it, age it, enjoy it. Bottled April 15th 2010, it's fabulous right now! The candi sugar on the nose is not harsh, it's soft brown sugar on the tongue. There's certainly a vinous note in the nose, deep leather, sharp lilac. You can spend some time getting to know this one! Duval Tulip. soft over the tongue, brown sugar, grapes, caramel. I missed something again; figs, candi sugar, grapes of wrath. Well worth seeking out!"
""
"Only a rank amateur would find this world class beer less than spectacular. Not trying to shame anyone who disagrees with me, but this is one fine beer. I recently enjoyed a Wesvletaren 12 while in Bruge, this brew is damn close. I won't say better, but damn close is a feat. As others have commented, the pour, the smell, the taste and overall are 98, and if you find this one buy and enjoy, you won't be sorry."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An amazing beer, although I am more excited to see how this ages after a couple years. The alcohol is a little too upfront in my opinion so after it ages this should really bring out the intensity of the flavors."
""
"I'm starting to think Belgian Quad is simply not my genre. I recognize the greatness of Unibrou, Delirium Nocturnum, Chimay Blue, and this. The complexity is hard to beat, for sure. The spiciness, the dark fruits, the warming booze. Certainly a pleasurable sipper. And my wife likes it a lot. No dislikes from me. I'm just not enjoying it as much as I do my favorite Russian Imperial Stouts or English barley wines."
""
""
"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. This is an amazing example of a distinctive style. Dark brown, with almost purple haze, and a light khaki head. Murky and thick. The smell is very complex, aromas of dark fruit, sweet bread and wild yeast. The taste is a complete amalgum of several sweet and sour notes, with plenty of dark fruit, sweet cherry, bready, buttery malt and banana like touches on the back. Extremely layered and refreshing, thick and smooth, but somehow drinkable. It's an amazing beer that has nothing but depth and complexity to offer."
"O – Overall, this beer is simply top-notch. It's right up my alley, too. I loved the Rochefort 8, just loved it, but this is just transcendental--a kirby especial. High ABV, super smell, taste, and mouthfeel--one of my favorite beers on the planet. Godspeed gentlefolk, and I suggest you enjoy either of these Rochefort on momentous occasions; as their caliber is such that it would be ideal for any sort of commemoration. Truly divine beers, with the 10 being just slightly preferential."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good, but left me wanting a little more. I remember this being slightly better the first time I had it with much less of an alcohol presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazingly smooth for a big beer. Alcohol shows up in the background but some really complex flavors are profiled front and center. Aromas and tastes you wouldn't think could come from just grain, water, yeast and hops (and some sugar) are all over this brew. Perhaps a curve ball for the wine enthusiast who thinks beer is too low brow. Or better yet keep it for yourself and let your wine sniffing buddy miss out."

"Final Thoughts: After drinking Trappistes Rochefort 10 it's no wonder why this beer is so highly acclaimed. The robust palate and drinkability speak for themselves. At $7.99 for an 11.2oz bottle it's not exactly a steal, but it's worth the price for those who seek the best things life has to offer. Would I drink it again? Yes, when I'm in the mood for a robust palate punching experience."
"O: The aroma on this beer is amazing - near perfect. So complex, so intense, i was impressed. The flavor is nice, but a bit muddled and a bit sharp. The finish is a bit harsh."

"O: The alcohol peeks through a bit more than I would like, but overall it's a great beer. It's also easily accessible, so bonus points for that."

"Rochefort 10 pours a very dark mahogany, no real highlights to speak of. Just over two fingers of bone colored foam rise up and crown the beer, and manage to stick around for a good long while. Little in the way of lacing though. The nose is fairly fruity, though more figs than some of the dark fruits that are more typical in a quad. There's just a bit of brown sugar sweetening up the ester profile, and a subtle clove aroma completes the picture. The fruit flavors, while still fig centric, lean just a little bit more towards plum and raisin than the nose (though I find myself wishing they did even more so). I find myself really enjoying the faint suggestion of brown sugar present, it's a nice, unique touch for this kind of brew. The spicy clove phenols are again relegated to a supporting role (which is how I like them). The body is fairly light and agile mouthfeel wise, but the carbonation could benefit by being just a bit brighter and more lively. I don't know if Rochefort 10 is my favorite quad, but it's surely a classic."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love the complexities of this beer. I feel like i'll probably edit this review after i have it again to add more flavors as i notice them."
"Muddy turbid appearance. I get raisins and figs in the aroma. The taste has a sweet backbone which helps give this beer its sturdiness. I like this beer although I'm not a huge fan of quadruples. I can taste that this is a well crafted beer. It has a real purity of flavors that is unusual. The water they use is really clean and good. It gives the flavors of the beer a sort of transparency that allows one to easily identify the different elements within the beer. Nothing is muddled together. There's no background noise. Glad I finally got around to trying this."
""
""
""
""
"All that being said, definately a top 5 quad, a vintage would undoubtedly be even more exceptional."
"Got it in Great Barrington, MA store. It's really cool that the monks draw the water for this beer from their well that is located inside the brewery. It's pretty murky with almost no foam. Small bubbles champagne like. Taste like caramelized barley, caramelized so heavily so it's so sweet like a slightly burned sugar. It was $7.00 for 11.2oz in the store. I expected a bit more razzal-dazzle for the price. Overall it's a good Belgian Trappist Ale, but not exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A little disappointed in this beer to be honest. Though very complex, it lacked some dimension in that it starved off all sweetness, I expected all these flavors and a little more. I thought it would hold a tight head longer. Still a good beer but maybe I was just overhyped for it."
"Coming across this beer in the south of Italy -- it's like encountering an old friend you never met."

"the best of the three by far in my opinion. pours mostly clear copper orange color with a very vibrant just off white head with pretty solid retention. kind of looks like oatmeal on top, thick and starchy. the nose is mildly spicy from the yeast, notes of dried fruit and molasses as well. the taste gives more hints about the fruit, apricots, cherries, and raisins come to mind for me. the yeast is less spicy than the nose indicates, but its still got some exciting peppery wild funk to it. the mouthfeel is quintessentialy belgian. a little sugary, super carbonated, and exciting on the tongue. the caramel malt notes last well through the finish, and my only regret is that i didnt buy a couple of these. the alcohol is totally invisible, impressive! a beer that only gets more eventful as it warms up. a really world class exemplary product."
""
""
"Amazing beer. Though this one might be just a little bit to sweet for me. I'm normally not that big on beers with a lot of alcohol volume, but with this beer everything is well balanced and the alcohol doens't overpower at all. This would probably be better after it's aged a while longer though, this bottle is not as complex as the 8 I've had recently."
""
""
""
"At almost $7 for a 11.2-ounce bottle, this is a rare treat. It lives up to its world-class reputation. A must-have."

"O: Reaches a really nice balance between dryness and sweetness."
""
"Overall - delicious beer. Lives up to the hype. Amazing drinkability for a ABV north of 11%."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good. Almost feels fuller and more substandcial than the westy and La trappe. Very well refined. After a while the sugar makes it a little decadent. Better than the Westy in the initial flavor but a I could drink more westy than the Rochefort 10."
"Color is like muddy coffee with solid head , reddish - brownish . Aroma is refreshing, bubblegum, cherries, fermented fruits, molasses, melon, extremely rich aroma. Taste is like melon, grape juice, warming alcohol. Palate is well balanced and smooth, no bitterness. Well deserved 100 out of 100."
""
""
""
""
"It's easy to see why this beer is so popular. A great quad with a huge aroma and flavor complexity, nice alcohol warmth but masked well for 11.2%, making it very easy to drink. Truly a great brew here."

"Overall: This is an absolutely outstanding beer that everyone should try at some point. I'm looking forward to future bottles and am happy to have a few in storage now."
""
""
""
"Pours opaque brown with a thick cream colored head that dissipates to about a single finger. Nose of cinnamon, figs, dry spice, clove, prunes and a slight peppery hint. Taste is dark fruits, prunes, cloves, cinnamon, a bit of banana and alcohol. The body is medium and its smooth. There's some bubbly carbonation but its much smoother than the 8 (although the alcohol birn kind of negates that). This is supposed to be one of the best beers available (all the trappist ales are). And its damn good. These monks know what they're doing. Rochefort 8 is next (higher rated everywhere than the 10)."
""
""
""
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? Great balance and taste, hides the alcohol well, wonderfully complex and yet easy to drink, and perhaps most importantly (besides ease of access), as consistently great tasting as any beer you can find. The Monks rule!"
""
"O - This is a must try. So smooth with such a complex flavor profile. And 11%?! Get a bottle. Or two."
"O - Quads aren't really my thing, but this is probably a top 5 Quad for me (in my limited experience). Smooth in feel and flavor. Coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. With two years of age, it is mellow and complex. An easy to get, good quad that I highly recommend if you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is a rare treat to drink. It pours up a deep mahogany with a substantial head, leaving little to no lacing. The nose is barley, fruit, and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is perfect. Taste is hard to describe. It has a fruitiness up front with some brandy like qualities and finishes very smooth for a beer with such a high ABV. There is a hint of alcohol at the finish, but not nearly as much as I expected. Certainly a world class offering that should be taken advantage of when it comes your way."

"O - I have had this beer periodically over the past few years and I can say that it gets better each time. Initially I thought this was just too much for me, furthering I found it excellent and now I find this to be one of the best Quad's available. The ABV presence warms the beer, rather than making it unbearable. Shockingly, this is drinkable. Had I no knowledge of the craft beer trade, I could easily put a few of these down in an evening, granted the next day may not be the best... Short of a Westy 12, this beer is bottled perfection."
"O: Its up there with the best, not really a fan of beers with higher ABV but certainly should not be a reason to disregard this beer, its rare, its imported, defiantly should jump on the opportunity if it becomes available."
""
"It is no exaggeration to say this is one of the best beers in the world."
"O- This beer is truly a benchmark quad, and one I will have again. Definitely lives up to the hype."
""

"Almost perfect beer, if only it were ever so slightly weaker in the alcohol department it could be classed as unbeatable. It had it all, a great mix of flavours and with plenty going on and a huge alcohol content that was hidden a lot better than I would have imagined."

"Pours a deep brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is fruity sweet with currant and caramel. Flavor is very fruity and roasty to a lesser extent. Alcohol is noticeable, particularly going down but not nearly as much as the abv would suggest. Medium to heavy bodied, chewy texture."

"Tasty stuff - complex and well-crafted. A rich fruity character with a spicy, boozy finish. Quite sweet but balanced. The only thing that takes it down a notch is the subtle hint of oxidation in the aroma/flavour - this detracts from the overall quality of the beer. I wasn't sure how I'd compare it to other quads that I've had, but at this tasting I reckon it doesn't stand up to Westvleteren 12. I'll probably go over it again in the future, perhaps with a less aged bottle. In any case, this is still a world-class beer that everyone should try. Recommended - grab one if you can."

Dark berries, grapes, dark chocolate aroma. Very nice sipper, the alcohol does not overwhelm, just a hint of burn going down, but the dark chocolate bitterness adds a nice touch at the end. A really great beer!"

"330 mL into trappist glass. Pours a dark hazy brown with yeast floaties and a thick, brown head that sticks around. Loads of carbonation. Aroma is all around with some cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, black cherries, plums, raisins, slight coffee, yeast, and alcohol. Taste is bubbly up front but then becomes super creamy with all the flavors mentioned above cascading at once ending finally with a dark earthy, oaken finish. 11+% is dangerously well hidden with not too much warming. 2/9/2009 8/5/9/4/17=4.3"
""

"O: A very good beer. Incredibly well-balanced and drinkable, even at the staggering 11% abv. My only gripe is the spiciness, which came on a bit too strongly for my liking (interestingly, the spiciness became increasingly subdued as the beer warmed). However, that's just me, and this is still a beer that everyone NEEDS to try."

"This is a very solid beer, and it must be one of the most balanced beers in terms of taste that I have had. The pour is smooth with an average head and lattice. The color is an amber red, a bit darker than I had expected, actually. The smell was like the taste, balanced with nothing dominating over anything else. It has a high alcohol content (11%), so there is a trace of a kick in its taste. But like the sour fruit and caramel tastes, it is balanced in well. A solid beer that I would easily drink again and again."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark red amber with massive head and lacing. Dark fruit aroma. Absolutely delicious. Tastes of dark fruit, caramel slightly floral with Belgian yeast and malt. Complex, creamy, rich and flavorful. Almost impossibly, smoother and more integrated than the 8. Perfect"

"good. so astonishingly available that i slap myself everytime i have this for not having a case to develop."
"Poured from bottle into Founders snifter. Serious fizzy two-fingered light tan head. Dissipates to thin layer, retention is minimal but does climb and recede every sip. Blend of dark fruit coloring, I'd say raisin, raspberry, strawberry and cherry, and grape. Smell is light and of dark fruit aromas. I generally do not like dark fruit-based beers, like ommegang's three philosophers, but this is much different. Smell is crisp and sharp. Taste is otherworldly -- nectar, grape juice, unreal. Nutty presence, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, aftertaste is a bit bubbly, like a champagne, but much less biting. This beer is awesome, prob #2 on my list of Trappispte beers."

"Love this beer just wish it was not so darn expensive at $7.50 per 12 oz bottle."

"A good way to describe this would be to drink a Highland Park 18 year scotch alongside a similar type of scotch with 15 years.. The 18 year will rock your world due to its drinkability and smoothness and the Westvleteren 12 did the same thing against the Rochefort 10. That being said, I would still age my Rochefort 10s because of its availability in the US."

"O- Liked Rochefort 8 a bit more. Rochefort 10 may have a slightly bolder feel in terms of flavours, but the 8 still presents the same amazing complexity and subtlety, while providing even more balance and drinkabilty. Not that i mean to say that this one is not nicely drinkable or balanced, just that the 8 is even better than this one awesome beer"
"Overall this beer was good but a bit too heavy on the booze side. Strong, malt forward flavors make this a complex beer, but I think it needs to age acouple more years before its at its prime drinking state."
"O - This is the best beer in the world. It easily outclasses every barrel-aged stout, Double/Triple IPA, Belgian quad, and other beer I've tried, and I've tried just about all of the best. Nothing really even comes close to delivering the experience from pour, to 5 minutes after the last sip like Rochefort 10. Westy 12 is pretty close, but I think Rochefort 10 suffers in its rankings from being widely available in the States if you're willing to pay for it, because it's better than even Westy 12 in my opinion. This beer is an experience like no other - fresh, aged, it doesn't matter, you won't find a better beer anywhere. Find it, buy it, horde it, and drink one whenever you feel like drinking the best beer ever made."

"O: Overall, I enjoyed the beer a lot. Very rich, complex beer that has a lot to offer. Only thing that I found off-putting was the slight notes of booziness in the first few drinks but then again, it is a Belgian Quad and I was no longer picking up on them halfway through enjoying the beer."
"O - I have had this several times with varying levels of success. This bottle offered more etoh and less dark fruits than the last but still a very nice beer. I'd drink this on most cold days."

"The smell is amazing, with caramel and raspberries blending in with the more subtle raisin smell. Tastes like raspberries, raisins, with a malty sweetness and a hint of spiciness from the alcohol along with a very pleasant and subtle belgian yiest sourness. Of medium body and carbonation, this is a very easy to drink beer, the only trap being the alcohol concentration."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a deep, dark brown with a thin tan head and no lace. The aroma is of dark fruit, anise, Baker's chocolate and a hint of smoke. The flavor leads off with plums, dark cherries, and dark chocolate notes with wood and a noticeable alcohol warmth as it warms. It's mouthfeel is full and leaves a mild alcohol burn in the throat. Trappistes Rocheforrt 10 is a complex, good beer. Recommended!"

"O- I wish I knew how to describe this beer better. Wonderful."
"Amazing four-year Rochefort quad. Rich, stewed grape, winey flavors with dark bready malts, transformed candi sugar, plum, prune, raisin, red grape, and a mild phenolic note. Mildly tannic with the only bitterness that's left behind. Aged gracefully well. Superb. Out of this world. So rich and full. The body is a soupy dream. Mega full with that sparse carbonated chew diffused within. 4.75, 4.75, 4.75"
"O - 4.25 - Very good. I was actually hoping for something with a bigger, thicker presence, but like with the St. Bernardus was surprised to find it fairly light. I almost want it boiled down a bit so the same flavors are there in richer form. What I like about it is the subtlety of the flavors. I like when fine cuisine does this - it gives you a flavor at about 95% of the level you'd need to recognize it, which forces you to chase it and keep wondering quite what it is. For a beer some call the best in the world, I'd like to see something more. I've been saving my 5's all this time for something like this! Now what do I do? Go back and recalibrate everything? Only Westvleteren 12 remains amongst the big Belgians to claim that prize."
"Overall a phenomenal beer that everyone needs to try. I've had some amazing beers and cannot do this beer justice in a simple review."
""
""
"Yes, I'm spoiled. I drank a Westy 12 relatively recently. And for my palate, this is not as good. Granted, this is probably not a fair comparison. Rochefort 10 is great quad, however. A little boozy, but a fantastic supper... I mean sipper."
"Overall: Very well rounded with a great depth. It might need a little time to mellow out, but it's got all the right flavor in all the right places. A little less complex than Westy 12, but it's in that rarified air for the style."

"Poured a beautiful reddish-brown, with a finger of gorgeous off-white head. Spectacular. Scents of dark fruit, raisin, some dried apple and slight alcohol when cold. Fruity scents and brown sugar take over the aroma as the beer warms. The apple is also still present. There is also some slight spice aromas, almost cinnamon-like. An excellent, complex nose that evolves as the beer warms. Flavors of raisin, brown sugar, dark fruit, apples, chocolate, and slight alcohol when cold. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced on the finish and the other flavors also become more intense. The fruity flavors in particular become stronger and more assertive. A slight red wine character also begins to emerge. A sublime, complex flavor profile. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with a slight alcohol burn. Quite good, nice to sip. This is an excellent beer, deep, complex and rich. Well worth drinking, well worth savoring. It is simply sublime."
""
"O: a real good quad, and for my tastes, I'd say it is about on par with Gulden Draak's 9000 and Smuttynose's Gravitation quads, but I have an admitted predilection for the Pannepot line, so I'm a little off the norm here."

"O: Plain and simple, a triumph of brewing finesse. Faint niggles here and there can't even come close to ruining this beer's immense glory. Magnificent."
"Appearance is dark brown with a slight reddish tint; a dense tan head is huge but fades pretty quickly with no lacing. Scents are of dark fruit, licorice, and freshly baked bread. Wish it was stronger though. Taste is mainly dark fruits - plum, raisin - along with a hint of cocoa. Alcohol taste is noticeable but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is outstanding. I enjoyed Rochefort 8 a little more than 10, but 10 is still a wonderful experience."
"Pours a very dark, purple, brownish color with a hazy like almost soapy texture to it. The head is off white, very pronounced with at least a 4 finger fluffy head that dissipates to a film barely holding on with each replenishing carbonation bubble streaming from the bottom. Huge aromas of raisins, brown sugar, almost a caramelized walnut aroma. Deep cedar notes followed by a nutty sweetness . There is also a vinous character to this that reminds me of inky red wines like shiraz and barolo. Deep dark stone fruits come just after the sweetness and lend itself to a nice warming alcohol note that lets you know this is a big beer. Taste is very complex starting with a big raisin and tobacco note that leave both sweet and earth flavors on the palate. Dry finish but before the finish there is a big kick of prune sweetness and just a touch of cocoa that leaves a bitter note that is quite nice. Dryness overwhelmed the palate on the finish, suggesting another sip. The body is actually medium to heavy bodied, even with the alcohol presence. Warming alcohol burn in a nice way gives this beer a distinct vinous quality as mentioned before. Overall, probably the best quad i have had so far. I never knew what ""extremely complex"" meant but after having this and seeing the flavors develop each second after the sip, i now know what that means. I have 2 bottles of west 12 to try still so maybe that will be better than this. Definitely more complex that Chimay Blue, but equally as drinkable. Very easy to access, and often passed by but you should really try this with a beef roast or a stew. Perfect night beer."

"O. I've heard it said that this is as close to Westy 12 as it comes and I have to agree. I'm not sure I could tell the difference between the two if you put them both down in front of me, and I'm not sure I'd Westy 12 would be the winner. This is a fantastic quad: it doesn't break new ground, but it is absolute aces as far as the style goes. Complex and savory, Rochefort 10 sets the standard for Belgian Quads and is absolutely a must try. Cheers."

"tried this beer out of a bottle a couple of weeks back after reading very good things about it. It is a very dark brown color and has about a finger and a half of head after pouring into a glass. very rich aroma but unfortunately it ended up having a very sweet flavor wich i am not a big fan of in my beer i prefer the more bitter flavor and finish."

"First tried at Eagle Ridge resort in Galena, Il. 2011. This is the beer that got me into craft beer. Still one of my favorite beers. Appearance - Pours dark, just a bit of lacing that sticks to the glass. Smell - Figs, fruit, chocolate. Amazing. Taste - Like smell but stronger..the high abv is barely noticeable. Figs, chocolate, raisins, bread. Absolutely delicious. It is a bit much, strong flavors and alchohol, although the alchohol is well masked, it does still tend to have a kick, unlike the 8. Mouthfeel - Chewy, heavy...not too carbonated though. Almost winelike at the same time. Overall - My second favorite beer (next to the 8). Expensive, but an experience that any beer lover should try."

"After trying several different quads over the last couple of weeks I have come to the conclusion that this might be the best of the bunch. It's a bit unfair to compare the other quads because I just had a 2006 bottle from Kulminator. Aging this beer only makes it better. The little bit of heat felt with a fresh bottle changes and all the sweet malt, toffee, caramel notes come out much more prominently. Wish I had it in me to drink another in one session but might be a bit too indulgent. Can't wait to drink another bottle soon."
""
""
""
"Verdict: One of the classic quads, I like the Westvleteren 12 a bit better, but for a beer I can walk to the store any day of the week and grab for a great price, this can't be beaten. The flavors are wonderfully complex, each sip yields something new and the smoothness is just delightful, if you haven't had it yet, you are missing out!"

"O: My first encounter with this one. I love Belgian ales and all of the Trappist brews I have had, but watch out St. Bernardus 12, this has taken over. I think this is the best one I've had yet. Just wonderful. Too bad it's damn expensive."
"Not blown away by this beer in terms of intensity but it is certainly very smooth for how strong it is. Very alcoholic bite and has a high complexity of flavors that change rapidly and need repeated evaluation to appropriately identify"
""
"O - This is a stunning quadrupel; definitely one of the best out there. I wouldn't want to drink this very often and would probably opt for other quads/Belgian Strong Dark ales (Rochefort 8, St.Bernardus Abt 12, Chimay Blue) with less ABV, but this is an amazing beer nonetheless. A true sipper. Highly recommended!"

Has a very nice dry finish, sort of like a woody red wine. This beer is very drinkable too, goes pretty quick. I like this a lot, but I think I'd like to try one that's ore like a year or so on it. May edit this review upon further investigation."

"This beer deserves every bit of the 99 rating that it has and more. One of my favorite beers of all time. This beer is great to age and by my opinion is best between 3 to 5 years. I have had the pleasure of enjoying many bottles of Roch 10, some as old as 10 years. Roch puts the date on the front of the bottle, five years ahead of the date it was bottled."

"Overall: My new favourite beer, 100%. It lives up to its reputation for me, and then some. The smell and the taste are so beautifully complex that I can't wait to buy another one or two just to enjoy without reviewing. The mouthfeel too is something that's very important to me in a beer and this one is stellar. It carries the weight of the flavours and smells so well, and goes down much easier than an 11.3% ought to. I could big this one up for hours. Go try it, I strongly recommend it."

"This is a huge beer. The differential in strength of flavor between 10 and 8 is even greater than that between 8 and 6. The carbonation level is quite high on all these beers, but 10 has the flavor to support it. Although I rated Rochefort 10 the highest of the three, I have to admit I sort of prefer the relative domesticity of the 8 to the sheer power of the 10. Rochefort 8 has a lot of the flavor, and is easier to drink."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 7/27/2016. Pours very murky dark brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big plum, raisin, caramel, banana, molasses, clove, pepper, biscuit, roasted malt, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Awesome aromas with great complexity. Taste of big molasses, caramel, plum, raisin, prune, pepper, clove, banana, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of sweetness and spiciness; with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Incredibly lush and smooth mouthfeel as well. This drinks way too smoothly for 11.3%, but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is practically invisible, with pretty much no warming noticed. Overall this is a beautiful Quadrupel. Big complexity, smoothness, and flavor balance. Amazing."
"One of the first quads I have ever had and a great one to start with."

"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is alcohol up front, dark fruits, some spices are present. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall I suppose my expectations for this beer may have been to high, is it does not meet the hype imo."
""
"Rochefort 10 poured a nice dark amber color, that was nearly a deep purple, with a nice lacing head. There was a nice sweet, grape like, smell, almost like a wine. The taste had a nice sweetness, and grapes, and belgin candy flavors. Nothing was overpowering, everyting bledended soo well, would easily have another. Overall this is a very good Quad, it has a very nice blended flavor, and drinks very smoothly."

"O - Damn those Belgians. So tasty and good."

"Served from bottle into goblet at somewhat higher than refrigerator temperature. Pours dark-brown with a thin head which dissipates quickly into a pretty lacing. Aroma is of fruit, must, and chocolate. Flavor is quite similar- fleeting malt and a bready chocolate. Light carbonation and very little hop presence (it is, rather, very well incorporated). There is far too much complexity to describe. Just go ahead and have one."
""
"O-flavor and complexity are excellent in this and the alcohol is well hidden for 11+% would make it easy to drink too much of this if you had more than a couple on hand"

"Poured out into a snifter, it was covered with a thick light tan head that stuck around for quite a while and produces a nice thick lacing. The body itself is a nice dark amber-brownish color and has some medium (mild) carbonation. You can detect some dark fruits and spices in this beer. Some mild phenol aromas are present too. It’s nice crisp when it first hits your tongue, and really envelopes your mouth with a thick warm feeling. I can pick up some fig and raisin flavors along with some mild citrus fruits like grapefruit. It has a very good aftertaste with some strong alcohol flavors. Over all this is a very good beer and I look forward to drinking it again."

"Pours dark brownish purple with lots sediment. Smells of dark fruit, raisins, alcohol, and some slight chocolate. Taste is as complex as they get. The flavor begins with a chocolate splash, followed by beautiful spice as it heads toward big sweet fruits: plums, raisins, pears. Ends again with some additional chocolate. This one is highly rated for a reason. I even gave my mother a sip--who turns her nose up at anything but Coors Light--and she was wowed by it. You don’t have to be a beer snob to enjoy this one. It’s just plain good. The mouthfeel is a bit chewey, but plenty of carbonation to keep it from being syrup like. Amazing brew."

"O: Wow – phenomenal beer! This was so smooth and tasty. This is a really strong beer but the malts blend it in so well you can’t tell. It went down way to easy for such a strong beer. I like the name 10 for it’s original starting gravity of 1.100"

"Really great big beer. Booze isn't noticeable. It's super smooth and easy. A lot more head than I would have imagined at this ABV. Best Quad I've had by far. This one definitely improves as it warm's up so don't chill it too much. I noticed that the colder this beer is the less complex it seems to the senses. Don't dumb this down!"

"I make time to enjoy this beer. I recommend others do to; give it a proper pour and be careful of the suspended yeast; it's not like a hefe - you don't really want it - as it will cloud and sour your experience."
"The Trappist Rochefort 10 is a beautifully dark, rich beer. It is very alcoholic for a beer at about 11.5% which is why it is called Rochefort 10. This beer retains its head for quite a while considering its ABV which, for me, is one of the determining factors of a quality beer. Deep, complex flavors that gradually change even as your pallet adapts to the flavor like all truly great beers should, in my opinion. Flavors change from hints of dark caramel-raisiny to light floral notes at the finish which are likely brought out from the high ABV. Because this beer is a quadrupel, the alcohol is very prominent and perhaps maybe too prominent for those who are new to the wonderful world of Belgian style beers, however, to those who are accustomed to strong flavored beers this one is great! It does sound like I am going on and on about how much alcohol is detectable in this beer, but don't misinterpret this as a fault, this beer is balanced near perfectly. In summary, this beer is very complex, has a beautiful dark brown (nearly black) color, strong slightly sweet/rich smell, and a complex taste. The Trappist Rocheforts are on my all time favorites list. Absolutely Delicious!"

"dark amber capped by a small silky head that only reduces slightly. Nose is malt, sugar, and yeast. Taste is burnt sugar upfront, slight biscuit, hint of dark fruit. Alchohol rears its head as this critter warms. Silky creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied."
"O: I thought it was a little overrated [I was a little generous giving it a 4.5 for taste (it probably deserved somewhere in between a 4 and a 4.50]3. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll buy it again, at least for the price of 6.10 a bottle. But don't get me wrong if someone was offering... I'd be all over it. Even though I haven't review this style before, I kinda see what they are aiming for and I don't think its really my kind of beer. This beer would pair perfectly with steak."

Other than the 11.3% Vol. on the bottle, the smell was the only other thing that gave away the alcohol content. The smooth malts eased you into a sweet coma. My favorite this month."

"Pours dark amber brown murky with a nice 1.5 finger off-white fluffy head that leaves great lacing. The nose has some sweet dark fruits like raisins, cherries or figs then some tartness like apple and finally followed by a Belgium yeast aroma. Right up front on the taste is that sweet dark fruit taste like raisins or figs a touch of alcohol then that great bready Belgium yeast flavor that I love with quads. Smooth, it coats my mouth very well but to me its a little too carbonated. Over all this is a great beer, it isn't as good as Westy12 or Pannepot but for availability this is a very good beer."

""
""
""

"This beer was medium bodied and well carbonated, as it tingles when held on the tongue. It doesn't get bogged down, doesn't get sticky or leave you overly dry. For the style it's... perfect."
"O: A heavy, interesting beer. Very malty and complex. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden."
""
"Overall: I have noticed that there are a fair amount of beers on this site that have been hyped to be better than they are, but this one is up there with ZD in my top 5. I may try aging a couple of these to see how the flavor changes with time."
""
""
""
""
"o: meh, dont think i will purchase another one. if the alochol were hidden better i would enjoy it more."
"When poured into an Orval chalice the beer is a beautiful dark wood color with a short lived medium tan head. Not the most beautiful beer in a glass but certainly adequate. The smell is dark fruit (plum, prune, figs and a hint of vanilla). The taste follows the scent but so well integrated that it takes a bit of sipping to fully identify all that is going on in this very complex brew. This beer has wonderful carbonation and at times I thought I picked up a cola taste and the mouth feel when held on the tongue for a bit was similar to a mouthful of Coke with the fizzy tingly feeling. This is a monumental beer. I can't recall enjoying a beer more. If Westvleteren 12 is better than this then I don't want to know about it. Simple outstanding!"
""
"Overall a great beer."
""
""
"Tastes amazing! Strong flavors of fruit and hop. The high alcohol content is subtle. This beer is dangerous! Sweet nectar of the gods!"
""
""
"The taste was absolutely amazing. Initial taste was great. Aftertaste was great. The warmer the beer got, the better it tasted. The beer was worth every penny....especially since I spent nearly $7 for the bottle."

"Purchased from the Seibu department store in Ikebukuro, poured into a 378ml glass goblet. I was so excited to try this brew, and it met every expectation and went beyond. The color is a beautiful dark hue that is 99% opaque except for a brilliant burgundy rim that appears if you hold it up to a light source. The scent was deep and nose-warming, and when I took it into my mouth, immediate sensations of dark berries and cherries took over. The swallow was accompanied by a flash of heat in my cheeks and throat, evidence of the 11.3% alcohol level. However, nothing painful about it... just concocted bliss. Half way done with the bottle, I enjoyed the changing flavors as it casually warmed in the room. I might have started it off too cold, or maybe the alcohol was affecting me, but I noticed as I drank and as it got warmer, the taste improved even more. I didn't serve it very cold, just maybe 20 minutes in the fridge after I returned home. Anyway, enough of this whole sexual experience I had with this brew. If I had three thumbs, they would all be up for this wonderful drink."

"overall, looks great but lacks in flavor. i searched up and down for flavors and came up empty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great quad. I am happy that I found a bottle of this. It has a very nice complex flavor and is very drinkable."
""
"Overall: I love this beer. I love it when it's new. I love it more when it's aged. I'm so glad that I aged this, but sad I don't have another one aging for longer to see how it changes."
""
""
""
"Although this wasn't the most appealing beer up front, this was wonderful to enjoy once the strength of it receded a bit. Beers don't get much more classic than this but that doesn't mean that this is for everyone. I'm not a huge fan of Quadrupels but I can see why this is so popular on here. What this lacked in flash, it more than made up for with the array of dark fruits and perfect body I enjoyed here. Give it time to warm up and most likely, you'll warm up to this as well."
"O- Exceptional beer. Really, really phenomenal. There isn't much I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said, so suffice it to say that I agree with most of the good stuff."
""
""
"O: This is one to just sip slowly and ponder while you do so. Very enjoyable and very well made."
""
""

"O: I do not have enough good things to say about this beer, easily my favorite quad and one of my top beers."

"Do yourself a favor, if you see this beer anywhere, buy it!!! and make sure to consume it at cellar, not fridge temperatures."

"O: A really wonderful beer. Quintessential Belgian beer and at $5 per bottle and always available at my shop, this is one to admire."
"O: great beer, can't believe I haven't had it yet. Got it for $6 for an 11.2 ounce bottle - well worth it. One of the best if not the best quads out there."
""
"Poured from bottle to a tulip glass. The beer pours a rich murky brown color with a thick 2 finger cream head. Good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is that of toasted malt together with fruit and malty sweetness. The yeast is light and adds a hint of fruity flavor. A hint of heat. The flavor is quite complex: roasted malty sweetness, fruit, hints of chocolate. The alcohol is hidden quite well but reveals some heat on the tail end. The beer finishes with syrup mouthfeel and hints of cereal grains with a lingering fruit fig-like flavor. Good. Overall, this is a good beer. I enjoyed it very much and would drink again, recommended."

"I've had this aged for 7 years before and it was superb. The booziness in the fresher bottle holds it back alot"
""
""
"Overall I'll definitely be drinking this often for special occasions, a great relax and enjoy brew."
""
"O - not quite Westy XII, but still great. Definately better with some age on it, but the low carbonation made this bottle a tad too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was my least favorite of the five being poured, but I think the bottle may have been off. We had a lengthy discussion about this, but I don't really remember what the conclusion was. I'll come back to it again at some point in the future and probably re-review it just for kicks."
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: well balanced, extremely drinkable for over 10% ABV. What hasn't been said about this beer? The most complex beer I've ever drank, yet it it's still smooth as silk. Any further criticism would not only make me look a fool, but discredit everyone who was involved in producing this masterpiece. I wish I had more. So much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Amazing to say the least. I thought 8 dollars was a bit steep but now I realize I was wrong. This beer is delicious and is worth every penny I payed for it. If you like dark fruit and alcohol warmth with subtle complexities then I highly recommend this. Its a sipper."
""
""
""
"O - a remarkable beer. Very big yet elegantly balanced."
""
""
"O. A great beer, very full flavored and filling! This is a wonderful beer that hides it's 10% very well. Sweet and bready makes for a nice fair and even flavor. It's great to have such a nice Belgian that is so readily available around the country. If you see this on the shelf, stop ignoring it and give it a try. Well worth the $6.00!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's really well made and pretty good, but I think I actually prefer the 8. Thought it would be smoother. It is a slow sipper with big alcohol warmness in the finish. Would like to try this with some age on it, I'm sure it gets a lot better."

"A fine beer but I find that I still prefer St Bernardus Abt 12.  I'll probably have to try one of these with more age on it, though.  If I do I'll update the review."

"O - This has awesome drinkability. It has great flavor and a super smooth mouthfeel. Overall, I think is a great beer, and it definitely lived up to the hype. I really can't wait to pick some of these up for aging, because I really think a year on this would make it even more incredible. I recommend picking this one up for sure. I will be buying more."

"Poured a ark brown, with a good size tan head. Smells malty, nutty, some caramel, a bit of alcohol. Tastes rich, sweet malty flavor at first, soon followed by some alcohol. Mouthfeel is eavy and rich, yet remains smooth. Overall I really enjoy this beer. The best of the Trappistes Rocheforts in my opinion. A must have. I need to get one soon!"

"O: When I first went to Belgium in 2007, I didn't really like dark beers. This one, however, always remained the exception. If it wasn't for the heat, I'd say it couldn't be beat. My vote for the classic example of a quad."
""
""

"O: After being very underwhelmed with 6 and 8, this redeems the Rochefort name for me. This is a very thick, very sweet, downright intimidating beer. You need to take your time with this to fully enjoy it, from the intense scent to the intense flavor and mouthfeel, this is a beer you'll find yourself liking more and more each sip and wishing you had more when it's gone. I would love to try this with some cheese."

"This is one of the finest ales I have had in my life. If you at all cherish the art of beer and brewing or at least want to feel important look for this beer. It is full of complexity and character and will not disappoint. Don't be discouraged by the $8.00 price tag. Check your stomach at the door and sip an savor this Trappist gem."
""
"Poured a dark brown to almost black color with a nice creamy tan head. Aroma was bold with notes of dark fruits, sugars, rum and spices. Higly complex flavors with loads of spices and herbal notes, peppery. Very chocolatey throughout, and a bitter chocolate finish. Not overly sweet, and no hint of the high alcohol content. Creamy and full bodied. Two thumbs up."

"Overall - nice beer."

"Overall - Wonderfully complex. Rich and sweet, yet remaining dry and bready. A dizzying experience! A monstrous Quad that demands your attention and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up on each sip (a good thing in my books!). Beautifully balanced. Somehow seems to master many startling, in depth flavors within each bottle. Definitely enjoy one of these after being somewhat warmed (not directly out of the fridge). I suggest serving this anywhere between 12-14°C to fully take in the breadth of this Quad. Simply amazing. Enjoy!!"

" Well, I've now had all three Trappistes. I must say I am underwhelmed and disappointed. While not bad, none of the three captured my imagination. The Trappiste ales are dark and sweet but lack the raisin/ plum/ date/ fig flavors that would make them special. I'm glad I tried them but I can't see myself buying these again."
"Overall: Cognac-like. Not a beer for gulping down after a workout or something. A beer for sitting around a fire, for sipping while reading a favorite book. It usually takes me around 2 hours to finish a 12 oz bottle of this beer. Time well spent."
""
"O--A bit pricey ($5.75 for a 330mL bottle), but totally worth the splurge. Those Trappist monks certainly know what they're doing--it's always a cool experience to consume a product made from a centuries-old recipe."

"Medium-thick texture along with some prickly carbonation. This is definitely one of the best quads out there, if not THE best. I will have to drink a bottle of Pannepot to decide which is tops..."

""
""
""
""
"Rochefort 10 is an amazing quad. Pours a deep brown with a creamy head and lacing. Smells of raisins, figs, caramel; sure enough, those tastes blend harmoniously with malt and pleasant spiciness. This is rich stuff. Mouthfeel gets a 5 - can't improve on this. If you don't have fancy beer glasses at home, use a nice wine glass. This is tops."
""
""
"O: This is an excellent, delicious beer and one that I'm glad is available locally. The alcohol is pretty understaded so this is very drinkable and could get you in trouble if not careful. I'll buy this again, no doubt about it. Thanks Tyler..you're a real doll."

"The quadrupel exits the small bottle with little fanfare. No popping cork or towering head here. As the beer settles into the snifter-inspired vessel, a dark smooth liquid emerges with a decent cap of foam. The color of the beer is dark chestnut brown. After allowing the brew to catch its breath the aroma is unmistakable. The alcohol is certainly noticeable, but it is mitigated by so many other things: burnt sugar, prunes, cloves, pear, chocolate. The complexity is demonstrated in the waves of the aroma. These characteristics come alive on the palate. The beer is much nimbler than expect and even manages some prickly carbonation. A bitterness pervades the entire experience providing balance to this Behemoth. The wonderfully melded components provide a deep rich flavor that is distinct and complex."

"I poured the 330ml bottle into my DFH snifter glass to find a nice heavy & hazy dark brown body with an off white one inch head. I really liked the way this one looked. The aroma was nice with a lot dried fruits dominated by plums and figs. The taste is just exceptional, a little more sweet than the aroma would lead you to believe and the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is great, a bit on the heavy side but goes down smooth and very sticky. Overall a fantastic beer I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. Defiantly going to be picking this one for special occasions in the future."
""
""
"One of the best beers I've quaffed to date. No trappist glass on hand so poured into old reliable, aka my Delirium tulip glass, so it really poofed out the head. It's all there - sugar, rummy raisin - but no sticky mouth, nothing lingering that shouldn't linger. It's a boozy beer but one that makes you feel like you can drink a few in one sitting. (You probably shouldn't.) An adult beer. I nursed this on its own while playing Super Mario Bros with my niece and nephew but could easily pair this with beef stew. An all-time fave."
""
""

"From the bottle, the dark color revealed immediately the standard of a quad. Giving an easy aroma of licorice, it was sweet candy to the senses. The initial taste was a sweet candy flavor that was well balanced with a warming tartness. The flavor combinations made the beer not too sweet or too tart. The warming nature makes this an ideal beer for a warming a cold winter day. On the other hand, sipping the bottle with a friend or friends could also be ideal. With a thick texture, there were hints of prunes, grapes, and other sours fruit that touch the palate as the aftertaste fades. The flavors are certain able to keep the tongue entertained as the thick texture stays in the mouth. This is a beer that can be tasted well after swallowing."
"This bottle cost roughly the same as eight bottles of Schlitz, and it was worth every penny."
""
""
""
"O - An great, complex beer. It's a sipper but very enjoyable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis but great to have once in a while. I haven't had too many Quads recently so this was an excellent choice to get reacquainted with the style. The price tag wasn't horrible either. I paid around $6-$7 for the 11.2 oz bottle."

"This beer deserves respect. I suggest you drink it while watching an excellent French or Belgium (Jupiler League) soccer match. Quality fast moving soccer that involves athleticism, deep forward passes, and goals. Pairs well with the music of Milo Fine ""Ananke."""
""
"Overall, this is one of the very best Belgians I have had. The smell is just a bit light, but the taste is second to none."
""
"This is one of my first Quads in a long time and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could never drink these on the regular, but I'll be back when the mood strikes. I plan on picking up another to sit on for a few years."
""
""
"O- When I first decided to pursue trying different craft beers, this was the first one I tried. It was delicious then and it's delicious now. A six-pack of this would be perfect, and maybe one every six months would be interesting to see how this develops. If you get multiple of these try your best to sit on them, it will be worth it."

""
""
"This is and always has been one of my favorite beers. The aromas of dark fruit (figs and plums) are noticable up front with a hint of spice behind. The taste follows the nose, but with a slightly sweet edge thanks to the alcohol. The beer has a great weight in the mouth and a nice long finish. One my wife and I always turn to when we want a pick me up or to celebrate."
""
"This beer has risen to the top ten favorite beers I’ve ever drank. This is so delicious and easy to drink that I could see myself going out of my way to find bottles of it. I wouldn’t recommend more than one or two in a night. If you have a chance to get your hands on one, do yourself a favor and buy it. I can easily see myself sitting back on a chilly Fall, Winter or Spring night enjoying one by a fire with friends."

"Pours a very dark brownish-purple black. Small head. Looks good. The nose is big dark fruit, plum and almost grape. Melds very nicely. Yum. The taste is sublime - dark fruits, plum and suggestions of grape again mirror the nose. Minimal booze and finishes a bit dry. There is just a slight bit of a mildly unpleasant finish, but that is being picky. Having had several, my guess is that it goes away after being cellared. The mouthfeel is velvety, low carbonation, good body. Overall, this beer is really good and shows that not everything that is good has to be hard to get."

"O - Awesome beer. Feels like I'm drinking life. Alcohol set perfectly behind big taste. Love the dark dried fruit flavors mixed with molasses sweetness. Great Belgian ale sure to put a smile to your face. Will definitely be drinking again."
""
""
"O: One of the best Belgians I have had. Hoping to pick a few of these up to cellar."
"Pours a deep red/burgundy, with a fairly white head. Light retention, with a tight collar and thin film. Good clarity in the body. Nose has some alcohol, brown sugar, prunes/figs, a rich malt character and a light herbal/vinous note. Taste has a beautiful profile, dark fruits, sugars, fantastic malt notes. Some wood, a light sweetness (maybe vanilla-y) and some spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is lovely, extremely velvety and smooth - excellent all around. Flavour and mouthfeel on this put this up there, an excellent beer really."
"It has some nice qualities, but the ABV is not well integrated and by the end of the glass is incredibly dominant, I just wasn't impressed overall."
"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a goblet. This pours a dark brown with a large tan head which dissipates down to a thin layer. The smell is a little lighter than expected, it has some dark fruit, dates, plums, brown sugar, very wintery. The feel is medium with high tinglely carbonation. The taste is pretty good, a little sweet with the fruit and sugar, on the way down there is a little alcohol burn and a little dryness, overall tasty."
"Bottle @ home. Dark brown appearance with a tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Dark chocolate, candy sugar, dark caramel, dark fruits, plum, raisin, Belgian yeasty aroma. Creamy, slightly thick mouth feel. Dark caramel-chocolate, dark candy sugar, raisin, dark plum flavor. Dark candy sugar, chocolate aftertaste. Booze is hidden super well. My absolute favorite beer of all time."
"Overall, this is as of right now my preferred quad. A very complex sipping dessert beer and a pleasure to partake of."
"Got a few bottles of this and I break them out whenever I’m in the mood for a great Quad. I opend the less then 12oz bottle and poured into a glass a murky brown color, the darkest of the big trappist beer. I smelI is slightly boozy and sweet yeast. The taste is strong upfront but super sweet and fruity on the end. This one is my favorite of the trappist collection. super well balanced and a great over all brew that I’m glad I can get it easy."
"O - Superb quad with ABV held in check by flavors. I highly recommend it."
"Poured into my Duvel glass after letting it rest out of the fridge for 20 minutes and has a very deep burgundy, brown color with a light tan lacing on top. The aroma is huge on this one of sweet figs, fresh plum maybe, sugar and almost a light port aroma. The taste on this starts with just a bit of carbonation then takes off. I like that the sweetness powers its way to the front then quickly fades to an alcohol heat and last a bit of a malt finish. This is so incredibly smooth, I can not over state this. The finish is almost velvet like even at close to room temp. A very good quad that very closely lives up to the hype."
"Wonderful beer. Full of dark and fruity flavors. Nice thick head that settled quickley, leading to the aroma of a berry farm. I love the crisp bite, almost like champagne. Overall, I would drink this beer often if I could afford it. As it is, I believe I will be cellaring a few."
"Mouthfeel Heavy body, thick liquid, loads of carbonation. The liquid’s smooth but the lingering is a nibble to the tongue that stings a tad."
"Overall-A perfect Belgian, if I may say so, not as sweet as the 8, better bodied and more pronounce carbonation and raisin taste than the 8. I definitely love these beers."
"All I can say is... damn this is a really good beer."
"Overall, a very bold beer that is executed as well as possible."
"Great fruity raisin and fig character with some spice, toffee and chocolate, booze to compliment. A great, available authentic quad. Definitely world class in some regards, but could use a head. But who cares how the beer looks in the end?"
"O - Really glad I got to try this one, probably one of the best quads I've had."
"O: this is a delicious quad, the alcohol is well hidden, the flavors balance each other nicely, tons of depth, this is a brew I pass over in the bottle shops far too often."
"D: Hah, it drinks easily, but if someone pounds this they should be slapped."
"Overall-Completely on par with Rocheforst 8, maybe better. Just a beautiful perfectly balanced beer that could be consumed any time of the year or day. Damn, i'm glad this is in Texas now."
"O: This lived up to it's reputation and I'm glad it's back in Texas. I plan to enjoy this on occasion because at $7 a bottle and the ABV it's not an every day drinker."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet.pours a dark brown with a nice tan head with slight lacing, not much retention. Smells of some dark fruits maybe a bit of plum or raisin and a bit of yeast. Taste is great, a lot going on its sweet, a bit yeasty. It has changed flaor while it has warmed up a bit. Overall this is a great beer, my first but not my last. Im picking up a case this weekend for sure."
"This is my favorite quad. I have tried many of them, including Westvleteren 12. I love the complexity of this beer...I will continue to keep it as a staple for years to come."
"O - This is a great brew! Can't wait to have it again. Colder weather approaching only means I won't be waiting long."
"Poured into a goblet a hazy and brownish/red. Deep color. Thin layer of creamy head that remained in place for the entire glass. Aroma is brown sugar and earthy raisins. Fruity yeast esters and lightly burnt caramel. Flavor is warm and rich with a lot of what was present in the nose. Candied raisins and some subtle chocolate. Fruity yeast character. Sweetness blends to an earthy fig and raisin finish. Drank this over the course of an hour and a half. Tasty and smooth with a full body the alcohol became noticeable towards the end."
"I really enjoyed the complexity of the beer. Would consider it one of the better beers I have every had. Certainly one of the better of the trappist beers."
"O: A really good quad, easily one of my favorites thus far. Certainly a beer I would consider picking up a few of for cellaring."
"If you are more of a California style stout drinker this one will be very complex, interesting and almost studious, however it is different and might not be what some people think when they imagine a stout."
"O: It's incredibly rich with big flavors. I wish it wasn't quite as boozy. But still great. Bet it would be great aged."
"Overall, an extremely expensive beer that warrants the price. If you like stouts, I think this beer would be pretty assessable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm not going to lie....I haven't had many Quads. All I know is that this is one tasty Belgian, and the alcohol is really well hidden. I paid a hefty price for this bottle ($9.99), but I might have to do it again sometime."
"Overall Impression- Enjoyed every last drop of this one! You could pour this over some Vanilla ice cream and make a Trappistes Float it was that good! Very nice brew and am ready to try the other two from Brasserie de Rochefort. I would go for this one if your looking to get into more Belgian style beers."
"My Fave!!! Pours deep brown with a thin head and good lace. Smells like malty dark fruit. Taste is a mind blower. Dark fruit, rum raisin, banana, booze, brown sugar, apple butter, yet not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A bit oily and chewy. Not too carbonated. It is hard to describe how this brew EXPLODES on the palate with such complexity, so much going on. So many sweet nuances, yet not cloying. Finishes surprisingly clean and dry for such complex flavor. This is by FAR the best of it's style I've tasted. Stunningly good."
"This is a truly complex beer. I've noticed some things since writing down my observations on beer, and most of them have to do with yeast. When I compare this beer to Unibroque's offerings, I understand why so many flock to Belgian creations: the yeast. It has to do with so much of the flavor, nose, and feel of the beer. Yeast touches all of the aspects of a beer, and Rochefort has a dynamite strain. When I added a little yeast to the beer after a swirl of the bottle I got more of a fruity flavor. Amazing! Very impressed with this beer, in that the complexities come with ease. I have a feeling I'll update this review at a later date when I am able to observe more aspects of this interesting creation."
"The Rest: I recently had Rochefort 8, and I liked the 8 better. While still very good, 10 is just starting to cross the line into being too boozy."
"Overall I think this beer is phenomenal. I have avoided Belgians in the past, but either my palate has changed significantly, or I have finally found one that I really enjoy. Tough to find this near home in MD, so I'm glad I could sample while I'm here in NJ."
"Overall: A truly spectacular beer. Waves of complex flavors and aromas hit you over and over. Virtually indescribable - must try."
"Overall: I am not a fan of this genre but I will grade it based on how it is within its genre and not personal taste. I appreciate the fruitiness which is not overwhelming though the booz is a little strong."
"Bought this brew from my local beer shop and poured into a glass. this has a great compact head with a nice light color and a hue of ruby red. Smells of raisins and fig and you can get a tinge of alcohol in there as well. The taste is one of dark fruits and honey. The slight taste of alcohol blends nicely into the mix and is not overpowering at all. Very pleasant taste in general. Very thick mouthfeel but one that suits the style very well. It's velvety and smooth. Carbonation is moderate and fits in well with what i was expecting. I think i'm in love with this beer and will be buying at again for sure. For 5.99 its well worth it."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and an extremely smooth and pillowy mouthfeel. Very good. Overall, I preferred this to Westy 12. Less sweetness and more dark fruit presence and complexity. And it's exponentially easier to find to boot."
"What an incredible beer. It is truly an experience to drink this beer, and gladly it is always around. Incredibly complex and easy to put down at 11.3% ABV relatively speaking."
"O - A beautifully complex beer with great taste and still very drinkable. The alcohol is present but never in a bad way."
"(Note: This was a side-by-side with Westvleteren 12 and I found this beer to hold its own, just ever so slightly less impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel.)"
"Negatives --- It's got a little sour aftertaste and price ($7/bottle at BevMo)."
"This is better than Westvleteren 12 but due to Rochefort's wide distribution and ease of purchase, I think westy continues to receive higher marks because of its legend and extremely limited availability. Do a blind taste test and judge for yourself."
"It's everything a quad should be. It represents a great beer times four and drinks like a combination of as many styles."
"Overall: Outstanding!. A very very good beer. Perfectly balanced. Would highly seek/drink this beer again... and again!"
"O= Overall very impressed by this quad one of my favorite quads really interesting and I couldn't beat the price I picked like six of these up for like $3 a piece IMO a great deal."
"O - overall, a big, flavorful beer that I very much enjoyed. This is the first quad that I've tried, and I will definitely give it another shot in the future."
"O - What a great quad! This is not a session but one you want to practice patience with."
"Notes: This is outrageously good. But it is also extremely heavy. Very much a sipper. I shared the 12 oz bottle with my brother, and to be honest, 6 oz seemed to be enough for a serving. We had the beer solo, but when I have this again, it will be much better with a cheese. If you have it with a meal, you'll be more likely to want the whole 12 oz bottle. High ABV at 11.3%."
"Overall one of the best Quads I have ever had as well as one of the best beers I have ever had. A must try."
"O - A tasty Quad and well worth picking up. I'm definitely a fan of the flavours, reminiscent of a barrel aged ale. Pricey but a great treat."
"Overall: Superb beer! I will be having this again and again and again!"
"Overall a very good beer... maybe in my top 5.... maybe... still want to try a westy to see if it stacks up like people say it does..."
"O - Like I said, one of the tastiest beers I've had in a while. I've had it before, and it's better than I remember. This one was sitting in the cellar for a good 6 months and the alcohol seemed to tone down quite a bit. A phenomenal beer overall, and one that I would recommend to any craft drinker, newbie or veteran. A pretty standard 100th review beer, but I'm glad this is the one I chose."
"Poured a 2"" mocha colored head. Body is dark like a glass of cola. Smell is thick with fig, dried fruits, malt. Taste is a complex delicous combo of fig, dried fruits, cola, toffee, caramel, and things I can't really name. It's rich. There's a long finish with a little alcohol burn to it from the 11.3% alcohol but yet it still doesn't seem too hot. It all works together like one of the bourbon barrel aged beers, but without the bourbon of course. A classic."
"I've had the other Rocheforts and this was my least favorite. I should also mention it is about a year old from bottling."
"O: Doesn't get too much better than this. Everything about the beer is outstanding. The flavors will change as you drink the beer and they are all great."
"Overall - This tastes like some age would make it unbelievably good. Toning down the alcohol would put this at world class in every category. Of all the beers readily available year round at the stores near me, this is the best."
"Have to say never having had the opportunity to try Westy that this one sticks out as my all time favorite Belgian/Trappist beer. Although I may have to revisit some others for a quick reminder...St. Bernadus Abt. 12 is a contender too."
"O: Delicious. I really enjoyed every aspect of this beer and the dark fruits played off the sweetness nicely. Will revisit many times in the future."
"It's strong though. I'm kinda drunk now."
"Overall: World-class and easy to locate.. fine with it!"
"Overall: Also really good. Reminds me more of a barleywine than most quads I have tried, but I really loved it. Definitely will have this again."
"A true masterpiece. A perfectly balanced beer that stands out with its own truly unique taste."
"O: A little strong on the alcohol, but an overall solid beer to enjoy slowly."
"O-Excellent, quickly becoming my favorite style of beer. I was excited when I found this at my local liquor store, glad to be able to share with friends."
"D/O: This is a great brew, with a strong flavor profile and an incredible mouthfeel. Overall, however, it's just a touch too sweet for my liking, and I'll have that reflect with a drinkability/overall score of 4.0. I will definitely have this again, many times, but I don't think I'd opt to have 3 all in one evening."
"Overall: Magnificent. Very well balanced brew that can be enjoyed over the course of an hour or two that grows in flavor as it warms. I wish I had some cheese to go with this fine specimen."
"Overall - this might be my favorite Belgian. I have many Westy's around the house as a result of a long project in Brussels/Leuven, which allowed me to collect a few bottles. As much as I want to enjoy the Westys, I think I prefer the Rochefort 10 I acquired here. I had Rochefort beers in Belgium, but they were really hot. Buying it here, after at least a month floating on the Atlantic and trucked around from who-knows-where have smoothed it out considerably."
"Overall: Fantastic brew for the price, its always available, and never disappoints."
"Re-reviewed 8/31/11"
"CHEERS!!"
"O - Good over all. Just need to swirl it around a bit to release a little air."
"(O) Does NOT drink like an 11% beer at all. It's a well balanced, obviously-not-American beer that sits well as a Quad. It's not a Westy 12, but it's quite up there being of the style. This one could easily sneak up on you though. This goes down rather easy for being such a big brew. The sweetness is enough to keep you from reaching for too many."
"D - sweet flavors, felt the alcohol, this is a good desert beer"
"O: This beer lives up to its' reputation. Rich and flavorful, with a solid alcohol punch."
"O - Maybe my expectations for this beer were too high. Maybe it is hyped up too much. The taste was fantastic, but all around I thought this beer was lacking. Don't get me wrong, this is a fabulous brew, but St. bernardus Abt. 12 is still ranked as the #1 Quad for me. At $6.50 per bottle, I don't think I would buy this beer again."
"This is my favorite quad thus far. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Plus the girl finished the 11.3% beer, and she was the one who needed it anyway."
"O: My friend and I reviewing this might be fanboys of this. But it is as fantastic as it's hype suggests."
"O - Very good quad, my favorite so far. This makes me really want to get my hands on a Westy 12."
"Overall, I cannot deny that this is a world class beer. That said, I think it would benefit from more aging than I allowed on this bottle - I'll have to find another."
"Overall: Excellent. One of the best doubles I've had. Will be buying again when I can find it!."
"O: A nice quad, quite drinkable at this stage (I think it's right around a year and a half old). The floaties usually bug me but here they didn't detract from the taste and feel too much. Recommended."
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Though experience doesn't necessarily make a beer good, in this situation, I trust the monks on this one and they did a heckuva job."
"Update (2/10/2014): The latest batch I've had to date is not doing too well - thinned, buttery (possible diacetyl), and with too much booze that overpowers its malt profile. No clue what's happened, but during a quad tasting with jdhowe and others, it unanimously decided that it was the worst tasting one."
"D- Heart sank again post pour. Not sure if i have maybe stored these Rochefort beers poorly or if they are too old. Poor appearance and flavour/aroma profile. Had this a few years ago in Cafe Gollem in Amsterdam and was blown away. This is definitely not the same beer."
"I just had it with a slice of Tillomock smoked cheddard....Really good"
"O-This is more not a beer,this is something more then that!"
"This is an excellent beer to compliment good company and great conversation. Drinks like a fine wine. Well worth the money spent, cannot wait to have another!"
"Overall an exceptional beer that is worth seeking out."
"Note: I drank half the bottle almost 30mins later, all flavors, nose, even mouthfeel were enchanced."
"Overall, this is a first-rate ale with hardly a fault to be found, and well-worth the price."
"Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy's 2004-2005 Trappistes Rochefort 10 11.2oz from my cellar, into Delirium Tremens etched snifter. In low light, pours a very dark shade with a small 1/4th"" head that disappears quickly not leaving any lacing. The oh so famous etched elephant in the base of the glass provides a nucleation point for carbonation to release, thus forming a incredible cap of foam about 5 mins after pour. The beer is so dark in the dim light that I cant see through, leaning toward a dark brown. Larger size chunks of yeast and protein float around near the bottom despite a soft delicate pour. Smell is very soft. Smells of grapes, plums, alcohol soaked dates, and a bit of brandy for me. The taste matches the nose, soft and delicate. White grapes are up front with assorted dried fruits, mainly raisins. The mouthfeel is strait up velvet. It is so smooth and so soft. Its weird how such immense taste can be paired with such a delicate presentation, but these bastards make it work. The alcohol is almost undetectable, which also means it is deadly. I have honestly had better quads, some of which are domestic, but this beer shines with its own astounding quality's. If I find it again for $4 a bottle, I'll be grabbing a few to cellar. Cheers!"
"O - Great beer, my favorite belgian by far."
"O- Overall this is an OK beer, but I found the alcohol taste to be a bit much. As one of the more expensive bottles at my local store ($6.50 for the small bottle), I can think of a few other quad options that I like more at a better price point. Worthy of another purchase; will try again in the future."
"2010 bottle, served in an Orval chalice. The beer poured a cider-brown with a thin film off head that faded quickly into a light ring of bubbles around the outside surface of the beer. The nose was a sweet mixture of molasses, raisin/date/fig, light alcohol, yeast and a little malt. The taste was a wonderful melding of complex flavors. Spicy yeast, brown sugar, malt, the gamut of dark fruits, molasses and a bit of chocolate. The alcohol is there, but it's very well masked amongst the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium to full bodied with a good amount of prickly carbonation. This beer is a real treat which I need to remind myself of when I balk at the pricetag - well worth the premium price."
"The beer is brown with a nice, tan head. Decent lacing and retention. The aroma is inviting, with yeast, malt, caramel. It definitely smells like an amazing Belgian quad. Wow, what a flavor! The 11.3% abv is so well hidden, and this bottle is fairly new. Simply terrific. Balanced to perfection. It's been several months since I had last enjoyed a Rochefort 10, and I am suddenly remembering my fondness for this spectacular beer. Certainly one of the finest quads on the planet."
"Overall - This is one of my ""everyday beers""."
"D: An exceptional quad style. Always willing to pick this up at stores, for the right price. A must try for those that haven't."
"O - I wasn't super impressed by the aroma and smell. However, the mouthfeel and body of this beer is perhaps the best I have ever experienced. This is a really well crafted beer, a real classic."
"Narrative: Coming this fall to UPN: “THAT’S MY TRAPPIST!” Inner city youth Reggie Jenkins never though life could get THIS DOPE until a real life monastic servant showed up at his doorstep with a vow of servitude: SUPER SICK! Now Reggie and Rochefort will OF COURSE have a series of misadventures wherein Reggie must integrate his Jesuit friend into the HOOD and Reggie might just learn a thing or two about himself along the SERIES OF 8 EPISODES. WAIT, I know you are thinking, can this get any more OUTRAGEOUS? Rochefort brought his robot dog VERITAS, who is SUPER SICK and sure to be fun times FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, coming fall 2013."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and has a perfect level of carbonation. Very creamy, yet has a carbonation bite at the end of each sip as well. An amazing feel. Overall, this is an amazing brew, one of the best I've had. Held off on buying it for a while, but honestly wish I'd had it earlier. Very impressed here."
"O: Amazing beer. What else can I say? Complex. Sweet. Although you know and taste that it's 11.3% you just can't stop sipping it. Really starts to creep up on you."
"O - A quality quad that qualifies for quenching the belgian palatte. The alcohol is slightly muted by the overall strength of the flavors that come through on this offering."
"I love this beer. It's why I love beer."
"This was my very first quad. Poured into a DFH snifter. Let it warm for about 20 minutes. Smelled for a while while it warmed. Smell of figs and raisins. Very delicious smelling. The hype around this beer is warranted. Tastes as good as it smells. Small hint of booze but nothing major. Being a hophead this was a much different animal but something I will buy again and probably cellar a few and review again at a different time."
"O: I think the 10 may have more smell of ripe fruits than the 8 but personally I prefer the 8. The 10 seems to have a little to much booze which takes away from the flavour of the beer. And the 8 is no slouch at 9.2%"
"o: very good brew with a wonderful dark fruit taste and sweetness while being perfectly balanced with some of my favorite malty flavors. would get this again, and will definitely be interested to compare this with my westy 12."
"O - im not a big fan of belgian darks, especially dubbels but top notch quads have a place in my heart, this beer is absouletly amazing, not for the simple minded. a capturing complexity and intelligently crafted ancient recipe. drink it belgium."
"Pours deep brown with a thin head and good lace. Smells like malty dark fruit. Taste is a mind blower. Dark fruit, rum raisin, banana, booze, brown sugar, apple butter, yet not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A bit oily and chewy. Not too carbonated. It is hard to describe how this brew EXPLODES on the palate with such complexity, so much going on. So many sweet nuances, yet not cloying. Finishes surprisingly clean and dry for such complex flavor. This is by FAR the best of it's style I've tasted. Stunningly good."
"This beer kicks ass-a perfect nightcap/sipper, and overflowing with character and charisma. Love it, can't say enough good things."
"This beer poured out as a deep mahogany color with some red highlights in it. The head rises and falls rather quickly. The lacing a minimal but does have just a little that sticks to the glass. The smell is great in this beer, aromas of sweet dark fruits and some Belgian yeast. The taste is mostly the same but brings along a touch of spice in the finish. The mouthfeel is really nice, smooth, rich and creamy. Overall this beer is a gem. I'm looking very forward to having my next bottle."
"Poured into a chalice, a deep, dark brown with a delicate whitish head that dissipates a bit, but not quite completely, and not before leaving some bubbly lace on the glass. Dark sugars and dark, dried fruits in the nose, sweet and malty, with hints of vanilla, and some noticeable alcohol. Rich tastes of caramel and toffee, raisins, figs, pears, brown sugar, and a touch of tobacco; warming alcohol bite. Smooth and full of flavor, finishes dry and slightly bitter. Full body and most drinkable."
"Final thoughts - wow. This is a complex beer that goes down so well. I would compare it to a fine wine. With it's fruity notes and deep, rich flavors, the comparison is obvious. Nearly perfect. Its knock is the alcohol presence. Just a tad too much for me. Other than that, Perfect in my opinion."
"Superb."
"Overall: Excellent, flavorful, complex, malty quad. A bit too sweet to drink multiples of, but a delicious beer that would be highly suitable with a sweet, carmelly dessert."
"It made a nice thick golden head when poured into a wide, stem-less wine glass. It has so much fragrance, very malty and rich. The consistency was fairly thick, and a small sip fills your mouth with so much flavor. A really great example of Belgian brown ale and a must try."
"Overall: Quite a delicious beer, tastes much better than it smells, this is a dangerous beer I could definitely have a few to many of these."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have tried and definitely the best Quad I have had. I will be having this beer in the future. If only the price wasn't $6.49 a bottle at my beverage store, I would have this a few times a week."
"Pours a dark brown with a very nice tan head. Strong aroma of fruit and hops. Very strong and complex taste of dried fruit and spices, yet perfectly balanced. Great aftertaste that lingers long after the beer is gone. One of the finest beers in the world, in my opinion."
"PP (Price Point) - $6.99 for a 12oz bottle, at a very low priced craft store. Hard to bite off and chew, but I can justify it by saying its $3.50 for a 12oz 5.6% beer, which we pay all the time for crap beer. DO IT, at least once, def seek it out and try!"
"The beer is good… and it doesn’t taste like it smells. There is hardly any, if any at all, alcohol flavor on the palate. But that’s okay. Of course, that is also dangerous since you could pound these beers if you wanted. But again, coming in at 11.3% ABV you should only drink one or two of these before slowing down. I fear starting at the 10 I wouldn’t enjoy the 8 or the 6 as much… but you know what I always say…"
"Overall this is a world class beer from the best, readily available and decently priced brewery from Belgium. Rochefort just can't do no wrong. Grab this beer if you can and sip it by the fire, just like i'm doing right now. It sure beats the shit out of any wine."
"O: I have been trying to get a hold of this beer for quite some time, as it always seems to be sold out at the places around me that carry it. I now see why. Fantastic brew, and well worth the wait. Far and away the best quad I have had, and certainly one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to drink. World class."
"Overall, a very complex, rich, nourishing beer that is entertaining and rewarding to drink and contemplate."
"Overall, a fantastically complex beer that somehow doesn't come off too heavy, despite the alcohol."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with some light getting through and a huge tan colored fluffy head. the head recedes slowly. The smell is that great spicy belgian yeast up front with a hint of caramel sweetness and dark fruit undertones. the taste follows suit with the belgian spiciness up front but is followed by a less sweet flavor and a bit of booziness from the 11.3% abv, the dark fruit raisin flavor is present in the finish. the moughtfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. overall this is an awesome quad."
"A bit pungent on the pallet but quite and extraordinary beer."
"There's some alcohol warmth building up by the end which is to be expected at 11.3%, but I can confidently state that this one appears no stronger than 8% or so, and even then, well masked. Its smoothness and hidden strength let me imagine this as the ninja assassin of quads, of Belgians, of beer in general."
"O: Very tasty and smooth Quad."
"O: Well, could I say that it's the best beer in the world ? At least one of the greatest I've ever tried. Such a good beer that I have never been able to make a single bottle last enough to age..."
"Very nice that this beer is increasing its availability while decreasing its price."
"A truly great beer. The alcohol is prevalent, but it's never unwelcome. The sweetness borders on cloying, but never gets too overwhelming. Amazing balance throughout."
"Sweet plum up front melding with dark sugary flavors, raisin, and prune, that has a prickly carbonation mid palate, then more tobacco and wood in the somewhat dry finish."
"Mouthfeel is quite sweet with brown sugar and Belgian yeasts. Allowing the beer to warm up brings out the flavors twice as much. Be sure to drink those delicious yeasts at the end of the bottle. World class brew."
"O – Belgian quad perfection! Definitely lives up to its high ranking. Perhaps the most accessible of the “great” beers in the world – a true gem!"
"O- A sipper. Hands down one of the very best beers that I have tried. Please sir...may I have another!"
"The mouthfeel of this is damn near perfection. LIvely,rich, sweet, spicy and warm all in one. This brew exibits the best of what beer complexity can be, and would easily hold it's own in a beer vs wine pairing against any Pinto Noir or Bordeaux."
"This is my second Trappist Ale to taste, the first being Chimay. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky brown color, poured slowly so little head, but the craziest thing Ive ever seen at the top of the beer with the head: the carbonation bubbles are swirling around in circles in the middle of the glass. Nuts! Smell- sweet fruits, cherry, breadyness, brown sugar, alcohol, maybe a faint scent of chocolate. WOW there is a lot going on here. Could probably think about it and smell it over and over and get something different. Taste- prunes, richest carbonation I have ever experienced in a beer, cherries, raisins, almost no alcohol present. Amazing for 11.3% beer. Mouthfeel- the rich carbonation off sets the richness of this beer and gives it a needed dry quality. I've never had a beer this big that was this smooth. I can't even imagine what this will do with time. Drinkability- this is among one of the best beers I have ever had. I'm cellaring a few more, we will see what happens!"
"Great dark color with thick off white head. Smell of figs and molasses. Just a gorgeous beer. Thicker than most and Very tasty inevery way and tasted great to the last sip. So glad I could try it worth paying extra once in awhile."
"O-Solid beer. A little on the boozy side for me but this should be being a quad."
"Overall a lovely beer and one I'd highly recommend. I wish it were not 8 dollars for the bottle. Not worth it to buy again, but I'm glad I tried it once."
"O- Love it! I think I'll do a side by side with Abt. 12 soon."
"O: This is one of my favorites! I would rank this as my number 3 beer. Top 2 are Westy 12 and St Bernardus. Stellar!"
"O- This beer has been very well crafted. This is a perfect example of how this style should taste like. I've seen this numerous times but I have been hesitant to try it. Now I'm wondering if my palate prefers Belgian over Impy Stouts...Dayam!!!"
"It is not heavy and the flavor doesn't linger or becoming annoying to drink. They beer is very well done and I will promise never to pronounce it like the ""stinky cheese."""
"O- Complex and delicious beer to say the least. I wish I would have put two of these away at the same time in order to see if the alcohol presence would have mellowed just a little bit more in another year as well as the development of the other components. Not that I need to tell anyone, but a great example of the style."
"O (D) - A great beer, but surprisingly hot. Will have to get more and lay it down a bit longer. Cheers."
"O: This is a fantastic Quad. For a beer with 11% alcohol, it is pretty well hidden and only comes through on the back end. It is not overly hot though. This is a must try beer indeed!"
"Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. I prefer the sweetness of the Rochefort 8 over this beer's slight coffee taste (as it transitions to the back of the mouth). Overall a good beer that I would try again (if there weren't any Rochefort 8's available)."
"Overall: i knew this was a really good Quad according to the beer lists on this site. Only had a few beers this style and was really not to interested in drinking Quads. Now that i have had this beer, I will be on the lookout for Quads of this caliber. Fantastic!"
"I can see why this beer is scored so highly, very impressive on all accounts."
"Not a bad quad at all, not the best I ever had, but still...quite good."
"The taste is superb and full of dark-roasted caramel malts that make the beer sweet and flavorful. Chocolate notes are there too, but I mostly notice caramel more than in any other beer I've had. It's sweet and almost dessert-like. The booziness is noticeable in a big, enveloping way immediately after the sweetness of the caramel. As it warms up, the alcohol becomes more and more pronounced, almost to the point of taking away from the amazing sweetness and flavor of the caramel, and this is the only reason I take off any points for this one. With such a high ABV this is somewhat expected however, and the overall flavor was still fantastic. Also the alcohol was warming, so it wasn't much of a detriment to the flavor. The mouthfeel is just spot on with a creamy smoothness that brings the whole beer together into a nice package. It's clean in the finish, with lingering boozy twinges in the mouth. Overall, fantastic beer and one I'm glad I had the chance to taste."
"O- One of the best beers ever made, its complexity is staggering and its flavors work perfectly together, a real pleasure to drink."
"O- A wonderful Quad (one of the best) and a must have for the style."
"Pours dark brown. The brown color looks like the color of milk chocolate. I don't really get as much sediment as I did with 6 and 8. #10 seems more fruit forward with aromas of sweet plums jumping at your tastebuds as you take a sip. The 11.3% ABV is pretty well hidden as the fruit aromas cover it up and leave none to very little alcohol burn and stepping aside for the smoothness of the sip. This is goes down easy. This is brewery is one of the reasons why I want to visit Belgium. Hopefully I get to do that one day soon."
"D: This is without question, a world class beer. The flavor is very complex and excellent, it is very smooth and creamy and it is a well balanced beer. I've enjoyed all 3 Rocheforts thoroughly, but this is the best."
"A very good trappist, but maybe the 8 version is a bit more balanced, the alcohol and sweetness is dominating here."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing forms on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, fermented raisins, spices, and yeast. There is a bit of a funky smell coming out of the glass too. Taste is very spicy and surprisingly funky. Lots of fermented dark fruits and super dark brown sugar. However, there is a definitely an off flavor here as I am tasting dirty gym socks. It's to degree where it's not very dominant but it's enough to be noticeable. The beer is pretty flat and combined with the taste it's a chore to even sip on this one. Overall, I need to get another bottle of this to rereview sometime because I think there is something wrong with this one."
"Overall, this beer is a must try. It was everything I was hoping I would get out of it and maybe a little bit more. The darkest quad I'ver ever had for sure, and one of the best."
"This review is based off a 2007 bottle. And, all I can say is ""wow."" This is how quads should taste. This is how fine beer should taste."
"Ah, she pours a dark muddy, ugly, sewer water looking dark brown. Lots of hints of orange yellow and red flow in it, with a tight bubbely 1 finger head that sticks around for quite a bit. Very dungeony looking beer. The smell, well, where to begin? This shit is something else thats for true. High octane raisins and figs hit the nose accompanied by huge alcohol clouds and ends with subtle grape juice like finish. Dark chocolates, strawberries, cherries, vanilla, cherry oak, rich malts, and of course that famous Belgian yeast strands are also very detectable. Dark fruits, sweet brown sugars, dark chocolates, smoked apples and cherries. Sweet grapes and mellow fruits add to the finish. Medium to heavy on the feel, almost like syrup, so so sweet yet a mild finish. This kind of melts in your mouth like cotton candy, it feels very heavy then melts away, amazing. What more is there to say? This is great."
"I've had many a Belgian ale and nothing comes close to this product except the Westvleteren. This beer is heaven in a glass. The smell, taste, head, lacing; they're all top notch.Bravo to the Rochefort monks. They're putting out an incredible product.If you get a chance to pick one of these up, do it. I just wish my budget allowed for more."
"A magnificent example of the style and a favorite of mine in the Quad group. I've had many of these over the course of time but never reviewed it, shame on me."
"O - Overall a decent beer, but I am definitely looking forward to revisiting my review with an aged bottle to compare the two!"
"Murky dark brown body- with a huge off-white head- good retention and decent lace. Lots of swamp water looking sediment. This quad smells of Belgian yeast, sweet candy sugar, and a slight fruitiness. A few sips and I know this is a well made ale. Dark fruit notes dominate with touches of apple and candy sugar. There is faint booze but not in a bad way. Medium body and a nice spritzy medium carbonation. Very good beer and my first from Rochefort."
"Fantastic and easy to drink for something so rich. $8 f0r 12 oz is worth it."
"O - WOW. What a brew! How has this been in front of me for so long and this is the first time I'm trying it. A must try for all Belgian lovers!"
"O: Simple... One awesome beer. 'Nuff said!"
"O - Excellent! This is a complex, high quality quad with a myriad of flavors and one that won't overpower the palate with heavy stickiness. Very impressed."
"O-Definitely my favorite quad/BSDA if not my favorite beer. If I had only this to drink for the rest of my life, I would be a happy man. Although I think I would stick to 1 a night."
"Overall / Drinkability: I think I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think the famous Rochefort chalice is the wrong glass for this beer. I think I would capture more of the smells and tastes if this was in a tulip and next time that's what I'll use. Overall a very malt forward beer, but not cloying, and a very interesting to sip and savor. Despite the higher alcohol I did not notice it until the end of the glass, but by then the alcohol was warming and even then I was pleasantly sated - no need for a second glass. Really a great beer and worth getting again, but for special occasions. This is not a beer for every night."
"This is the fullest-bodied, darkest and richest of the Rochefort family. Another solid offering from a solid lineup."
"Served in a wine glass at 50F. Aroma of...grape? An extremely rich, but at the same time sharp, quickly-curtailed injection of rich plum/fig/raisin/prune dark fruits. Some aggressively sugary Chimay-like Belgian esters follow, and perhaps a hint of hops. Might go really well with some brie. I think among aggressively fruity dark ales, I may almost prefer Bell's Batch 9000."
"O: Weighing in at 11.3% this beer is absolutely phenomenal! Alcohol goes undetected. A+++"
"This was a world class beer that just took the words right out of my mouth, I will seek its splendor the rest of my days."
"But enough of this Belgian BS, I'm switching to Coronas! Hahaaa happy Cinco de Mayo!"
"O- The alcohol is a kick in the mouth, but the flavors, aroma, and appearance of the beer are magnificent and if that doesn't make it a good beer I don't know what does."
"O: This is an amazing beer: delicious and very drinkable. 5"
"Overall: Just as good as westy in my opinion...much more accessible of course!...cheers ( I need a case I think)"
"not as much head as compared to the other two."
"O: I was initially a little thrown off by the sweetness of it, but unlike other similar beers, once I got used to the flavor a bit, I had to stop myself from gulping it down. It may just be that I'm slowly learning to appreciate the style a little more after having the chance to try a few other trappist beers. In any case, the sheer complexity of the flavor is astounding. Highly reccomended!"
"Overall, one of the best. It must be good for me to like a beer made in one of my least favorite styles. Its complexity and balanced sweetness make it a very delicious brew."
"T: Very sweet and a bit hot on the finish. I'm getting some raisin and dark fruit and a lot of malty sweetness along with the thinnest hint of coffee on the finish. It leaves a drying and warming feeling on your tongue that tells you the alcohol is there. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and not too syrupy, even as it warms."
"Not as polished a Quad as the Westy 12, but then again I've only had the Westy when cellared for twice as long as this one."
"O - A great beer. Definitely would recommend that you let it warm up before trying it. The layers of flavours were more distinct once it warmed about 50 F. Next time I'll probably just drink it a room temperature. Great beer!"
"A world-class quad."
"This beer enjoyed at the Abner pub in Norman, OK in a chalice glass. The beer pours a dark reddish brown with a finger of off white foamy head that laces and retains very well. The aroma is strong with figs and caramel sweetness. The taste has some hints of grapes, figs, caramel and spices and finishes clean. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety with a good balance of carbonation. Overall a great Belgian ale."
"I was over eager when I opened the 330 ml bottle. I poured and sipped immediately right from the fridge (about 39 degrees F), After realizing that was not the thing to do I let it warm to about 49 to 50 F. WOW!!! Poured a dark brownish red with a very nice head that left quickly but left a nice lace on the top. Smelled wonderfully of dried fruits and toasted malts, yum. The the warmer taste was everything the aroma promised and MORE!slight hints of alcohol well covered and balanced with the fruits and carmel notes. Felt med. thick and creamy leving the taste of this ale in the mouth until it was rinsed out with water. WoW can't say enough good things about this except try it."
"O: I dont know what to say, it was good with flavors of dark fruit and strong malt. Incredibly smooth especially for the booze. Not sure I can fully appreciate this beer so I will have to work on my palate."
"A very, very good beer. I'm interested to see what a few more years in the cellar will do to this one. As it stands relatively fresh, it's a thick, rich, and delicious quad, though not quite as complex and interesting as some others."
"Wow just abosolutley wow. This beer needs its own category. The smell is full and smells of caramel. The taste is something that lingers but not in a bad way. Each sip is better than the last. This beer actually made me contemplate joining a monestary. Find one and cherrish every sip for if it was your last you can die a happy man."
"O - To be honest, I was a bit disappointed after all I had heard about this brew. It's a great example of a well-done Quad, but I don't think I'd be very keen on drinking it alone. As a dinner beer, perfect."
"I ordered this at Le Cirio in Brussels. Ruby-brown with a dense off-white head. Aromas of figs, cocoa, and herbal tea. Very full-bodied and creamy mouthfeel with an almost honey-like texture. Flavour is dark caramel-sweet with peppery spice upfront, followed by more figs, molasses, and a deep bready undercurrent. Complex and port-like but not overpowering. Westvletern 12 is reputed to be the best beer in the world in this style, but I think that reputation is likely enhanced by its rarity; I prefer Rochefort 10."
"D: A wonderful quad. I had this before but didn't remember just how great of a beer it was. I understand why people hold this on par with Westy 12"
"Overall: I would highly recommend this beer. It's a world class example of the style and I'm sad that I will not be able to find them in Texas anymore. Worth seeking out if you can."
"Extremely drinkable despite high alcohol content 11.3%. I find it to be a complex, but very balanced beer. But it also pleasantly rich in taste, even in comparison to other quads such as St. Bernardus 12. Pairs with food, similar to a good red wine."
"Full bodied with high carbonation, this beer is a sipper and a half. Great drinkability, but the carbonation fizzes on the tongue a little excessively."
"O: Solid quad all around very thick and flavorful. I could stretch one glass of this out for a very long time."
"Ending notes: This beer is a must try for any beer enthusiast. I could spend an hour discovering all of the characteristics, as there as so many present. What a phenomenal take on the quadrupel style. Outstanding."
"Mouthfeel is subtle, yet extremely satisfying. In terms of trappist ales, this takes the cake as the best I've tried. It really is something to behold."
"This beer is packed with flavor and many different levels. This is a great beer just to give as a birthday gift. Cheers"
"D: Good beer. Don't see how this is in the top ten on BA right now. It's not in my top ten. I do love quad's, but this one is not the cream of the crop."
"-Cheers"
"D- This beer is one of the best for the style that I've tried, everything in balance, makes you want to go back for more."
"O: What more can I say? It really is a legendary beer and for good reason. One of the best I ever had. And maybe has the award for the most drinkable beer with an above 10 ABV."
"Overall: Initially I enjoyed all aspects of this beer, but after consuming the enitre bottle, I enjoy them all the more."
"Overall, this brew continues to be in my top 3 no matter how many IPAs, Stouts, or other great brews I have the luxury of trying. My biggest gripe with Rochefort 10 is that sometimes I get a bottle that is noticeably better than every other. Can't wait to see how the 7 I have left age out over the years."
"To quote my friend @joshkennedy: Bravo, Monks."
"O- Wow. this beer has a reputation that precedes it, and naturally that made me somewhat apprehensive. But this lives up to its name, and really delivers something special. i would never have more than one in an evening, but its one i would sit on for a long time. undoubtedly one of the worlds best beers"
"O- Wow, truly a great Trappist beer, haven't had it since I was in Belgium almost 4 months ago, I feel like I forgot how good this was. It truly is a complex delicious brew. Need to try it alongside Westy 12 in the future."
"O--This is probably the best quad I have ever tried. It has an amazing smell and taste. Just be wary of the alcohol. It's hidden very well."
"O: This is a fantastic beer!!! It's weird, as high as I rate this beer, I don't feel I gave it a description that would reflect that. I think that's what impresses me so much. Its great in the right simple ways...ways that require the experience of monks that have been brewing since 1595. I had this beer once before and I remember it being better so I'll have to give it a third try sometime."
"o : the combination of all the different elements has been crafted to be greater than just a mere sum of its parts , totally awesome and definitely one of my best beers to date"
"Big and profound but very very classy."
"Bravo, monks."
"Drinkability is pretty good. The above average sweetness may be an obstacle to some, but the high ABV is hidden beautifully, so that's a wash."
"Overall: I think this is a great beer. I will definitely crack another one of these real soon."
"Best by date 160713, so I must have received this about 2008 (thanks Linda)."
"Overall Drinkability - Highly drinkable. Very smooth, especially considering the ABV."
"D-well this is definitely a sipper. i wasn't too impressed with this one compared to other dark belgians. it just doesn't go down easily. it was actually sorta difficult to finish. It is unique though and complex. Though its not my favorite. It's something I'll be coming back to every once in awhile."
"M: i would say a medium-light body as i mentioned perfect balanced, the 11.30% is not feel on your mouth"
"great sipper to let warm and bring out the flavors. good nightcap."
"O - Pretty good. I have had a few of these now and I think I prefer it aged. When it is fresh the booze is a bit overpowering but after a few years it really seems to die down. I am glad I stashed this one in my cellar. One of the best for sure."
"Very good, but not as good as all the hype. For the money I would take an Ommegang Three Philosophers or St. Bernie 12 over this every time."
" but a satisfying treat to the taste buds."
"M/D: A treat. Im looking forward to cellaring the rest and seeing the complexities change in the next couple years. Very robust character to this brew. Surprisingly drinkable for an 11.3%...even dangerous ;)."
"Very much a beer to drink SLOWLY. Not for the weak hearted as this is a very strong beer. Recommended as a later drink in your beer course to end it all with. (I started with Chimay Red - Orval - Rochefort 10)"
"Overall this is an amazing beer and one of my favorites, not a session beer by any means but it is worth spending an evening sipping on."
"This is one of the few beers I've had that really tastes like a work of art. Obviously it's not sessionable by anyone's definition; I would probably never want more than two or three in one sitting. Still, it's supremely drinkable for what it is. I'm not generally a big fan of quadrupels but this is an amazing brew."
"O: A good beer; maybe my appreciation of quadrupels isn't up to par yet, as I didn't find it exceptional. Worth a try when you're feeling like spending a decent penny on a beer that, judging from the rest of the reviews here, could be one of your favorites."
"O: Very glad I tried this. Gotta love the monks."
"I actually came to know of this one's existence through a guy on one of the forums I'm on, and he's always raving about a ""Rocheforte 10"" that he's drinking...and after looking into it, I got myself a bottle and here we are. Excellent brew."
"D- I cannot get enough of this one. It is ranked as one of the most popular beer on this site for a reason. By far the best beer i have ever had."
"D: Very drinkable for such a big beer. I've had it before and don't remember the buttery aspect to it. Maybe this is just a much fresher bottle than my others. Overall, still a great beer."
"I still haven't had Westy 12 yet."
"Murky brown with yeast and trub. Light off-tan head. Possibly one of the best looking beers I've ever had. Aroma is quite layered mix - cabernet, sherry, plum, raisin, and almost a sweet/sour finish. Flavor is smooth in every way - sweet raisin, plum, brown sugar, merlot. Explodes on the palate. No alcohol flavor even in the slightest. Flavor lasts forever. Not my style of beer and probably will never have again, but very worthwhile to experience."
"This is strongest and most memorable of the Belgian strong dark ales I've had. Pours dark, smells strong. The first two or three sips you really notice the alcohol, but also the amazing flavor. As you go through the glass, the alcohol fades to the background, and you are left with a fantastic, complex taste. By the end of one bottle, all I thought of was having another. Two are doable, but hard to imagine a 3rd. This is a truly special beer."
"It's easy to tell why this is one of the highest rated beers out there... super tasty and complex...the boozy finish is the only thing that holds is down a little."
"D- This beer is one of the best for the style that I've tried, everything in balance, makes you want to go back for more."
"p.s. Yes, the head is still present. What is this made of?"
"I made the right choice on this one. Well worth the price."
"Man, this beer smells good. Wait, I'm going out of order. It is very dark, almost black when poured into my glass. Back to the smell. Malty, caramel with some fruitiness. The taste is so damn good! Carbonated, but can't really taste the strong alcohol. Very smooth, malty, carmel taste. Getting slight fruity hints. Drinkability isn't really an issue, since this is a small bottle, and at $5 plus dollars I'm only having one. Awesome beer. God bless those Belgians!"
"Overall a wonderful beer and I feel very underated because it is so easy to get a hold of. Call me crazy but I think it is the next closest beer to the Westy 12 for this style; still a step below though"
"superb quality in this. can see why it is so highly regarded and so expensive to boot."
"A divine brew."
"A great beer. I could sip on this thing all night. Unfortunately that would probably be a bad idea considering the ABV."
"This is a treat to say the least. Looks like 6 and 8 need to be re-reviewed, hell I might give Chimay Blue a shot....though I found it unimpressive fairly recently."
"Poured a muddy dark brown with little bits of yeast floating with a large frothy tan head that was quickly dissipating and had fair lacing. The aroma was of a roasted bread malts, light herbal hops and a doughy yeast with notes of molasses, plums, figs and raisons. It tasted wonderfully malty-sweet at first with a hint of molasses with a the finish being bitter-sweet with notes of dried fruit and had a mild alcohol twinge. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and quite creamy in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall an outstanding strong ale, defintely worth trying!!"
"the CPJ"
"D- 4 This is a very good beer and I can see why it is touted so highly. It isn't too heavy and I could see myself having a couple of these in a sitting. Because of its strong flavors and ABV, though, it's probably not one that you'd drink all night. It should be enjoyed for what it is and appreciated one at a time. I'd like to have this one again to try and pick up on more of its subtleties."
"M/D - Coats the mouth with a strong sugary sweetness. A complex beer that evolves with each sip."
"D: The 11.3% doesn't show...at first; of course this is a slow sipping, monster beer but it is so smooth and warms the soul so nicely; one of the best beers in the world, period."
"Cheers..."
"Conclusion: One can tell this beer is the culmination of years of development. It is a rich, complex beer that needs a couple of sessions to really appreciate the nuances and complexity. I consider this to be in my all-round top 10 list, right below St. Bernardus Abt 12 and I will always keep an ample supply to break out and enjoy with friends."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are interesting but honestly, I am not sure how this compares to Westvleteren 12. I haven't had them side by side so it's hard to be objective, but I found this to be more sweet and alcoholic, and the buttery notes I've gotten in both the Rochefort 8 and 10 are just not doing it for me. It's still a tasty brew, but currently I'd have to give the big three Quads a ranking of... 1. Westvleteren 12, 2. St. Bernardus 12, 3. Rochefort 10. Depending on when I want to crack another Westvleteren, I should definitely do a side by side of all prominent Quads."
"Cheers."
"Pours a deep brown, mahogany tinges, one finger of off white head, good lace on the glass. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, raisin, plum, toffee, slight alcohol and yeast. Taste is of dark fruit, caramel, grape tannins, slight alcohol, raisin, dried fruit, biscuity, licorice and faint medicinal notes are all present. Creamy, full mouthfeel, good body, perfect amount of carbonation and very well structured. Drinks like a dream, nice slow sipper, if I could have one every day I would, very delicate and complex, world class brew for sure."
"D: The beer had a good overall flavor, and the alcohol, while strong, was blended well with the other flavors. However, since the alcohol had such a prominent position, I think Rochefort 8 was a little easier to drink than Rochefort 10. I enjoyed all of the Rochefort beers and would rank this one second compared to their other two brews (8 would be first and 6 would be third)."
"I don't know if I'd go with ""best beer ever", but it's quite good and undeniably unique. A must try."
"Drink - The alcohol was extremely well hidden and you'd never know it was a 11% beer. The Drinkability is amazing and it makes the perfect winter warmer/sipper beer."
"Very tasty, but too rich (and correspondingly expensive and high ABV) to keep drinking all night."
"It's got some serious warming from the alcohol, I think I've mentioned that a couple of times already. The first thing that I taste right after the sting is licorice immediately followed by a peppery spice then a sugary truffle well and hints of figs and nutmeg. Hops are invisible; it's definitely got a malty spine and that dark fruitiness that you expect in a world class Quad. For the complexity, taste and overall experience, I score this one high but it fails on drinkability for me so I can't give it an A, it's a B+ IMHO. However, if this is any indication of how the Trappist Westvleteren 12 is going to be, I can't wait to get my hands on a bottle. If any of you know where I can get ahold of the Unicorn they call the Westy 12, by all means, send one my way!"
"Its mouthfeel is smooth and silky but still a little abrasive."
"I now understand the difference between a secular & Trappist ale; only with a Trappist can you say, ""Holy Sh*t, I'm getting drunk!"" and literally mean it. Whether or not you are a Believer, you can definitely appreciate this as the work of ""god""."
"Pure sex in my mouth... That is the only way I can really bring to life the emotion that I have every time I our this... A few days ago I enjoyed it by myself and this evening I shared a bottle with my wife's dad (Russian who doesn't care what it is as long as it has alcohol) and he was speachless after the first sip..."
"D: Quite drinkable at 11.3% ABV, a more pronounced herbaceousness than I was expecting, especially compared to the 3 year old Westy 12 I tried it next to. I think it's arguably more complex than the Westy, a beer I think it's deservedly compared to, and while I'd put it in my top 5 quads I've had, I think the Westy still wins out."
"This is quite simply a fantastic, delicious, decadent beer. Very complex, with a great malt backbone. The alcohol is nearly invisible, except for a touch in the nose. I could drink it all night, if I didn't start feeling tipsy halfway through my glass."
"Very drinkable and world class."
"The smell is of burnt sugar which I love and a little bit of light fruit. The taste is of dark fruit and more sugar and light spices like nutmeg. It ends with a creamy finish. While this may not seem like a 5 description, they are done so perfectly and blended so amazing, I can almost not even explain it. The mouthfeel is very good with more of a creamy nutty finish. This beer tastes no where near 11.3%. I could of drank this extremely fast and could of drank another just as fast afterwards if I wanted to. By far the most drinkable beer I have ever had and if I could give it a 10 for drinkability I would. It deserves the hype."
"D-Best Belgian quad. Drank this side by side with a 3 year Westy 12 and ROchefort came out on top."
"Legendary. In the same vein as St. Bernardus Abt 12. Dark brown look probably less head than St. B 12, but is perhaps a bit more drinkable because of a softer carbonation for such a high abv beer. This is a bit different than St. B 12 in that it smells a tad bit more like fruit than fine sherry (St. B). The taste is less fruity, but as I mentioned more drinkable and dare I say I prefer this beer a bit more because of it. You have to drink this slow. The alcohol is nearly non-apparent, barely even warming. Save this one for the pope, because ""beer is living proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy!"" - B.F."
"This is one amazing beer. The care and craftsmanship that must have gone into this recipe over time boggles my mind. There are so many subtleties that complement one another in a symbiotic manner. All that said, yes, I want this again, but it is not something that I could or would want to drink regularly. I think my brain would explode if I did. Lovely beer."
"D - Quads are my favourite style of beer and this beer demonstrates why I love Belgian beers above all others."
"D:This is one for the savoring, while being almost light on the palate for the abv and the style."
"O: Outstanding. I fully understand why so many rate this beer as highly as they do. Definitely an epic drink. In my top 2 Quads and certainly in my top 5-10 beers across all styles...Period!!!"
"Drinkability is hard to say. It tastes and feels wonderful, so in a sense it is incredibly drinkable. However, it is a very strong beer, and is certainly a sipper. You wouldn't want it to go quickly anyway."
"Still, a quite excellent beer that will only get better with time. I look forward to trying cellared bottles a year and two years from now."
"Not too bad. Needs.... to be less expensive. That would make this brew a bit more drinkable. One or two is worth the price, though. It's also a tad too sweet."
"A slow sipper, but more because I want to drink it slowly than because I have to. Probably my favorite beer at the moment."
"Very good beer that went down much easier than expected. Had wonderful rich flavor that disappeared quick. I am a huge fan of Rochefort, I personally enjoy the 8 and 6 much more however. I feel they are the best trappist ale I have had to date. A++++"
"D: What an awesome beer. Why have I not been buying this every time I see it at the store?"
"D: Very high. You can hardly tell the ABV is more than 10%, the flavor is phenomenal, and the smell is wonderful. Really blown away by this one."
"D: Very nice and really should be enjoyed with breads, cheeses or a hearty meal."
"This is fruity and full. Highly, highly recommended."
"What is there to say but this is an exceptional beer. Aroma isn't what I would consider complex but it is so good it only whet's your appetite for what's to come. It is very sweet (I like that), like a liquid candy bar (in a good way) but it's somehow balanced or tempered by the yeast and alcohol. The alcohol accentuates the taste rather than just creating a pleasant warming or boozy quality. It certainly has similarities to malt liquor but it seems every sip brings something new. My only complaint is the bottle isn't big enough!"
"D- Very easy to slug back, but the ABV started hitting me quickly. The booziness becomes pretty evident after it warms a bit. One of the best belgians you can buy in the US in my opinion."
"D: very nice and drinkable"
"This one easily waltzed itself into my personal list of favourites and once again it's only confirmed by thousands of other beer enthusiasts around the world."
"Reddish-brown with a bit of head. Smells delicious with fruits, figs and spices noticeable. Tastes just as good and the alcohol is definitely present. The fruits and spices are in abundance, yum! Very enjoyable and drinkable but as is with any 11.3% - proceed with caution."
"Very happy with this tasting!!"
"D: Very solid drinkability for it's high alcohol. definitly a sipper and not a session beer by any means, but very good."
"This was a very tasty beer, there is so much flavor it is difficult to experience it all in just one beer. I will definitely look for this again."
"Someone told me that this is the type of beer you need to sip slowly to enjoy, but you will want to gulp it down. Boy was he right. It poured a very very dark brown with a light 1 finger head. The smell as a bit fruitier than I was expecting. When you sip it, you notice immediately that it coats your entire mouth, but it is not heavy at all. I know others have commented on the alcohol bite, but I did not notice it at all -- something quite exceptional for a beer with this ABV. The taste is complex but not overbearing. I do get some dark fruit notes, but everything is balanced exceptionally well. It has a short finish but it is satisfying. I was surprised at complex this was without hitting you in the face. In a word: subtle. It scores a perfect 100 when it comes to drinkability. I can't imagine anything this wouldn't compliment and I couldn't imagine a time of day (or night) when I wouldn't enjoy one of these. Top notch."
"D- This is a fine sipper and truly a world class beverage."
"Crap this is good beer. One finger head of medium brown hue. Thick lace, with little cling. Color is a 33 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of melon, raisins, plum, peach, molasses, grapes. Flavor is one of the best I have sampled. Figs, plum, peach, pear, melon, molasses, caramel, chocolate. The more I taste the more flavors I find. Rich and creamy in my mouth. I would like to drink this all day, but with the price and the ABV or almost 12 percent, I don't think this will happen. This is a really good beer."
"D- This beer is a fantastic example of the style. The ABV doesn't really seem to be there in aroma and taste. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants a good trappist beer without paying an arm and a leg for another one that you can't get in the states ;)"
"Pours a black w/ a perfect off white 2 finger head. It looks perfect in my Chimay glass, thus the rare 5 on appearance. The smell is fantastic- dates, walnuts, malt, spice, very complex smell. I wish I didn't have a cold right now, because I'm having a hard time picking up all the smells- still great though. The taste: One word comes to mind when I take my first sip- ""WOW!"" I don't know where to begin. Caramel, dates, raisin, malt, and alcohol hit the taste buds. Each mouthfeel is like eating a loaf of bread- but still smooth. Slight burn w/ the alcohol aftertaste. What a great beer. At 11.3%, it's a sipper, and you wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. World class all the way. This is definitely one of my favorite quads, and one of my favorite beers period."
"Pours black with a large beautiful off-white head. Special care must be taken to stand this one up for awhile before enjoying, and when it's poured unless you want to chew it you need to keep a close eye on the neck of the bottle and pull back when you see that healthy sediment start to slide down. Unique and wonderful smell of malt and banana. Flavor is fantastic, a malty plum-like flavor that is dry and yeasty. Soft mouthfeel despite the healthy carbonation. Goes down nice, with flavor to the end. Finishes dry and complete. An outstanding beer that I personally enjoy with some nice aged gouda."
"D-Pretty easy drinking for high of an ABV this one is. I couldn't see having more than a small bottle of it due to the richness of it though."
"Drinkability was only OK for me. I know quad Belgians are not my favorite but I was expecting a bit more from this beer. It was OK but I will not go out of my way to have it again. Nothing really stood out to me as exceptional."
"Overall: An incredible beer. So much complexity and depth. This is truly a world class brew. Recommended!"
"Overall: I'm honestly disappointed. For a top 10 beer, I expected more, especially a top ranked Belgian. I was most surprised by the strong alcohol smell and taste, most good beers of this abv hide that. Now, my only other quad experience is Ommegang Three Philosophers, so I'm not a quad expert. I might get another bottle to age and see if that improves it. My guess from the date stamped on the label is that this was bottled 4/14/10, so it would be 10 months old, so it might need more time on top of that. I'm also curious about how other reviews either highlight the alcohol presence, or talk about this wonderful, complex, amazing beer. Will update if I get another one."
"One of the best beers I've tasted a classic Quadrupel."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: very smooth. Alcohol is present and strong, but is dulled by the sweet fruit presence."
"D- I really enjoy this beer. It has amazing flavors and aromas. It feels a bit lacking, and for something this alcoholic it drinks incredibly easy. I'd love to do this one again. Very good example of the style."
"D: Good thing this is a pretty chunk per bottle, or else the 11.3% would sneak up on me, you can taste it... but you don't really care about it."
"Mouthfeel of a world-class beer. The flavors don't all present immediately but don't linger, and inspire you to hold a mouthful as long as you continue to find new subtleties within the taste."
"Overall this is a damned good beer, right there with St. Bernardus Abt 12, though I did enjoy Pannepot Reserva '08 a bit more."
"D- I wouldn't have more than one, at very least not in a row. But at 11,2 percent, you wouldn't need much more to satisfy a pensive beer geek such as myself."
"OMG, the head is amazing! Has the look of luxury. Tastes a tad sweeter than Trappistes Rochefort(8), but maintains all the other great qualities of that beer. I actually like this beer better. Primary flavors for me are banana and raisin, but they are not overwhelming. Delicious!"
"D - My favourite beer I have ever had, it is 11.3% abv and it drinks well, but shows its strength just like I would hope it would!"
"O: Phenomenal. Wow! Best quad yet. Sweetness is just perfect."
"D: Good, not great. Pretty much your standard Trappist ale, nothing offensive per se, but nothing exciting either."
"Drinkability - It was like a fine cognac. You felt the alcohol bite but it was not off putting."
"Overall this beer is incredibly rich, strong and complex, it deserves to be sipped at about 55 degrees after a square meal. I can't say I'll be drinking this often but when I do it will be memorable."
"This beer poured the darkest of browns with a two finger light khaki head. The aromas are of plum, yeast bread, and ALOT of alcohol. It also has this slightly off, sour tinge to it. Meh. It's very bready and gives off a lot of dark fruits. Of course, a little too much alcohol. This makes me crave a St. Bernardus 12 Abt. It drinks ok, and that's about it. It's still crisp and goes down smoothly but isn't very drinkable. This beer features far too much alcohol. This was infinitely better the first time I had it. This bottle let me down. Rochefort is 0-2 on the evening."
"The mouthfeel is nice and full and has just the right kick with the high abv and overall this is the perfect beer nice smooth and very drinkable."
"In the tasting, i tied both Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, but i am putting Rochefort 10 ahead in this review for one huge reason. I can purchase Rochefort 10 at any point during the year about 3 miles away from where i currently live. Just makes this beer even better knowing i don't have to trade/spend ridiculous amounts of money in shipping to get ahold of it. In the top three beers i have ever had."
"D: Amazing drinkability & it keeps getting better as it warms a bit. The smoothness of the beer is still baffling considering its ABV. It may be a slow sipper but I'll definitely drink more of this one - a good beer to pair up with some deserving food."
"Cheers"
"Great beer with lots of complexity."
"Drinkability: Very! This is an outstanding beer with so many levels in it. The flavors are robust and subtle at the sme time. And as the beer sat and warmed it became better and better. It should be sipped, savored, and enjoyed."
"Holy crap....I have seen this beer on the top 100 and have been wanting to try it, I tried the 8 an was not super impressed, but this beer blew me AWAY. On top of all this I can barely taste the extremely high amount of alcohol that this beer possesses."
"D: Outstanding beer and one of my favourites. Complex, rich and memorable but I could never imagine drinking more than one at one sitting."
"It is truly a lovely beer, and I especially like the high ABV as I sit in my house on another 10 degree (Fahrenheit) day."
"NB. Goes great with blue cheese"
"Overall an amazing brew. This is a true craft beer and I'm thankful to the generations of monks who have put their heart and soul into this."
"Chimay is better, as is St Bernardus."
"I've had a couple quads and have had mixed feelings about them, still getting to know the style I guess."
"Fucking World Class Brew! Everything about this Quadrupel is amazing. Pours a rusty brown booming with heavy tones of yeast, dark sugars, raisins, berry fruits, and alcohol. Taste follows with malts, pepper spice, and caramel. At 11.3% abv, this has a difinite kick. D Train's gonna sip and enjoy and let the alcohol keep me warm along the tracks..."
"Best by 5/15, so bottled in 5/10."
"D: Savor, share, explore, and enjoy. Fantastic beer. One of the best in my opinion."
"Critique: Greater complexity and a longer finish. Classic, nonetheless."
"D: I love this. Go get one."
"Very enjoyable beer to drink. At 11.3% ABV you're only going to have one but it's takes a while to sip it anyway. Different flavors in each sip, even more as it warms in the glass. Definitely one to enjoyed over an extended period."
"D -This is one to sip. But each sip packs such a punch that it makes this a brew to be reckoned with. I'm not always a big fan of high ABV brews, nor all that Belgium has to offer, but this one's a keeper. YUM!"
"This beer is very drinkable and gets better as it warms... Even with it's high ABV, this beer goes down well. 10 cheers for Rochefort."
"D - goes down smooth and pleasantly; leaves me satisfied and content after just one, but still wanting more; in fact, I may have to grab a few the next time a go out, to cellar a couple"
"I haven't had this in about a year, and that was fresh. Although I like the 10 alot, I prefer some of the other similar beers a bit more."
"I tried this one fairly early in my craft beer drinking career. This was probably my fifth, and oldest (although certainly could handle a couple of years without problem), and on par with previous bottles. It probably is one of my top 3 favorite beers and really exemplifies why this style is currently my favorite. It will be interesting to try it next to my recently acquired Westy 12. If it wasn't $6 a bottle I could drink it weekly."
"This is the type of beer that I would like to drink with a nice steak, the flavor is very powerful so it can be enjoyed next to other strong flavors."
"D: Well, all things being said, this beer s at the top of my list. I could drink maybe two of them, but that would be a heavenly two drinks. After that I would want to move on to something a little less good as to not adulterate the quad with drunken haziness."
"Drinkability: Where i was nervous at first, looking at the ""11%," i found this to be a wonderful beer, and extremely drinkable. For the mere history behind this beer, it's worth checking out, but upon the first taste, you find an incredible beer which was artfully crafted and meant to be slowly enjoyed. I'll be putting more of these in the beer fridge for future consumption..."
"Drinkability is great. This is a good on to drink either really cold or room temp."
"11.30% ABV. .33L bottle poured into a dimple glass. Pours a clouded brown color with a quickly dissapating tan head. Sweet, fruity, bready aroma, with a hint of alcohol. Great body, well carbonated, chocolate, caramel, creamy almond smoothness. No alcohol on the palate, easy drinking quad. I prefer the Rochefort 8 over this one here."
"Drinkability: Sipped from a chalice, this beer is beyond pleasing. Warm, inviting, and intoxicating. Over 11%, but the rich sweetness is ever so luring. Best enjoyed on a couch or similar area, far from motor vehicles and heavy machinery!"
"It's been a few years since I've tried the 10 and to be honest I wasn't blown away the first time...felt it was a bit on the watery side but this bottle certainly isn't. Very rich, complex and delicious. Definitely holds up well to some age."
"drinkability; not so much crisp and refreshing like most highly drinkable beers but so damn tasty and the high alcohol content is well hidden...quite a classy drink!"
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Be sure to leave this beer out of the refrigerator for at least ten to fifteen minutes before pouring it. The ideal serving temperature is around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the flavor profile won't fully develop unless you let it reach that level of warmth. Don't cheat yourself."
"d- This is a beer you pour after a hard or even good day. It just rewards you for buying it! While the price is steep I plan on getting some to put in the cellar. Excellent!"
"Noted: i will buy more of these and this beer is the reason I started my cellar... This is a good beer for beer... All reviews are done on the iPhone because i make notes on it... Spelling won't be great :)"
"d- This might be the highest I have ever rated a beer. I cannot believe that there is a quad or even a beer that is considered to be better than this one. BRAVO"
"None the less its a good tasting beer that shows different nuiances as it warms."
"D-Too rich to have more than one, especially with the strength of the alcohol. However as I said, I haven't had anything like this before, so it could just be that I'm not used to the style."
"Drinkability - I had one in about 2 minutes and I'm about to fall asleep this is definitely a sipping beer but hell why would you want to throw this back its pure heaven. A great beer from a world class brewery well worth a try. Got to thank the guys at Hops City for this one."
"A-"
"This is a brownish beer with tinges of purple that bubbled up with a small brown head and then left a sticky film on the sides of the glass. It smells a lot like prunes and raisins and brown sugar. It tastes very much the same, with some alcohol adding a rough edge and cutting through the sweetness. Very thick, with natural feeling carbonation. I like this a lot but it got me buzzed really quickly so I couldn't drink ton of it."
"Bought this one shortly after hearing about the fire at the abbey. Poured nicely into a snifter, good but not obnoxious head, wonderful aroma. Drinks like liquid caramel without the stickiness or sweetness, just amazingly smooth mouthfeel. 11% ABV? Couldn't tell until I was done with it, barely a hint of booze. Absolutely outstanding beer!"
"You could probably drink this 20 times and pick out something new and different everytime. This beer gets a lot of hype but truly lives up to it. Extremely complex. Superb."
"The look of this beer is a very very dark and murky brown that doesn't let light pass through there is a beige foam that continues to sit on the surface and look very appealing. The smell is a wonderful tapestry of caramelized banana mixed with figs and raisins and amber candied sugar. The taste is like all of those notes concentrated down. I would have thought that to be really impressive (and while it still tastes good) there is a tad bit of sour to the flavor that I must honestly say I didn't expect to taste. The mouthfeel is rather light on the palate and goes down really smooth, a hint of bitterness in the background is it's only fault. This is a good beer to drink overall, though I don't know if it was worth the amount paid for it per oz."
"Cheers!"
"D. Extremely drinkable. This is the epitome of beer and a great example of why Quads are my favorite style. Whether or not St. B or Rochefort 10 is better is very marginal in my book. Still waiting to try Westvleteren 12, but Rochefort 10 is a world class beer."
"Overall this beer is wonderful and complex, while relatively young it ages well and shows no sign of degradation. I thought this beer was older when I was drinking it, because I was not entirely familiar with Rochefort's labeling, but it is about a year younger than I thought at 19 months since bottling. The Belgian yeast flair of the beer seems somewhat subdued, ie a touch less spicy with more malt and alcohol tones coming into the forefront, but the phenolic yeast notes are still present and accounted for in a very effervescent and rich layered brew."
"D: I find this beer to be a great dessert to many of my beer sessions...fantastic"
"D Similar to the Abt, a good beer to have in the frig. 4.5"
"D: Great example of a Quad, and highly drinkable for 11.3%"
"What can I say; this is the beer that got me to truly love beer. Before this, I looked forward to a frosty Franziscaner Dunkel or Guiness with excitement, but now anything less than a Rochefort 10 doesn't get me to that place. Sadly, I live in Austin, TX, now, and Rochefort doesn't ship to TX due to tax reasons, so I leverage every trip out of the state as an opportunity to buy/drink as many 10's as possible. It has a body, flavor, smell, drinkability (especially for 11.3% ABV), and overall enjoyment that is unmatched from my experience. Still haven't had Westy 12, and think I'm going to save that for an actual visit to the monastery in Belgium. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is a decent substitute to get me by, but it and Chimay blue will never match the superior experience that a Rochefort 10 provides. Ignore the price tag and grab as many bottles as you can, then enjoy the pleasure it brings."
"I love how this comes in single 11.2 oz. bottles, that way I can afford to buy it on a regular basis without breaking the budget. It's definitely a sipper and something to be savored. A fantastic Quad."
"Not my favourite representation of this style, but a wonderful example nevertheless!"
"D - not so much drinkable at all, but outstanding on 11,3%"
"Very dark initial appearance and a smell that does not dictate the taste. Very well received among my group. An extreme amount of sediment on the last pour but again, very well reeceived. Noted a rather high alcohol taste, but a great aftertaste. Tried all three today, and this was the favorite among 6,8 --and 10"
"If the earth were to ooze any elixir better for the body, other than pure water, this ought to be it !! With a dark Amber color and an alluring complexity, Trappistes Rocherfort 10 rolls off the palate with a sage-butter after taste that is perfect for those nights you want to be alone and reflect with minimalist beats en queue. Or be like a few friends of mine, throw on some Gregorian Chant and load up the PS3 and start climbing levels. Excellent craft. Be smart, get some."
"What a blessing to be able to taste this masterfully crafted brew from Belgium here in the Southwestern United States. This baby pours a very dark and satisfying brown with a healthy head of off white. The smell is complex, and yet coherent. Taste is very composed and comforting. Mouthfeel is great, I almost didn't want to swallow. Drinkability is good."
"Bought this at Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a snifter, it poured a very dark brown with two fingers of tan head, which both retained and laced very well. Little visible carbonation. The nose revealed plum, blackberry, raisin, date, tart cherry, cocoa, slight coffee, and the presence of alcohol. The taste revealed black cherry, chocolate, and molasses initially, then a dry tartness midpalate, and finally a smooth brown sugar finish, with some lingering tartness afterward as well. The alcohol was much more hidden in the taste versus the smell. Deeply complex, yet oh so balanced. Thick feel, yet velvety smooth, with no carbonation, and a dry bitter tartness afterward. What a great beer; I could only imagine what this would taste like aged some more."
"D - for 11.3% it is very drinkable, the flavours are complex but the alcohol is a little overshadowing, enjoyable but I prefer the 8"
"D: This is a very nice brew but it does not come close to St. Bernardus Abt 12."
"D- The 11% does not hide itself, one or two max."
"D - The right beer in this evening spent at home watching snow outside the window!!"
"Drinkability is highly desired."
"The Rochefort 10 is very nice in deep brown color with tiny hints of burgundy. The foam full but thin and dispersing alittle over time. The smell is malty with slight raisin overtones, and the taste is really good with a full malt flavor and and mild fruit flavor. There is a hint of alcohol, especially the longer the beer is tasted. There is some carbonation, and the beer has very nice taste and super mouthfeel. I would really enjoy this beer as it has great flavor and it is strong. As always, be responsible when enjoying beer, etc."
"Drink: This one is going on the Xmas List for both gifts and please Santa, can I get a few in my stocking! But this is a beer to enjoy, not slam down. I would say second best behind the #6, but still an outstanding brew."
"D - at 11.3% this beer is incredibly easy to drink."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer!! I will most defiately be purchasing a few bottles of this to cellar and drink in the future. It's spendy at ~$5/11.2oz bottle but totally worth it IMO.... I have never had something so complex yet well rounded and TASTY!!!!"
"Overall, it's a sipper, and a great one at that. It's very complex, but not so rich or dense as to put you off it."
"Overall: This is as good, if not better than Westy 12! I've never been a huge Quad guy, but this has cracked my top ten of favorite beers all-time. This will be a constant in my cellar for years to come! A must try! Cheers!"
"Good punch of alcohol and carbonation"
"D: Complex and overall fantastic Belgian beer. The Trappistes know how ot do it. This is one of the best."
"This beer only improves as you let it warm. Give it time (and if you don't want to end up under the table, you will), and you will be very satisfied. A lovely beer to have on a cold evening, but not one I'd reach for impulsively, though this is the best quad I've ever had."
"drinkability - this one is quite the sipper, with an 11%+ abv and major complexity going on, it's a beer for taking your time and savoring, one of the best to do it with i might add!"
"An amazing beer!"
"Good taste and a perfect feel make this a very drinkable beer, but with the high alcohol content, you're going to want to take it slow with this one."
"Overall, not as impressed as the hype led me to believe to be honest."
"This is a very good beer, well made and complex, but the dark fruit flavors don't really do it for me. Nevertheless, this is definitely a top notch beer."
"Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above. For the two of us, it came down to a style preference. I like a challenging brew and she likes a well-balanced, un-assuming brew."
"Phenomenal beer! If you want simple then sip and swallow. If you want complex then let it sit for a while and notice the fruit notes of pear, Jicama, plum and star fruit (yes! star fruit) try it! Slight subtleties of nutmeg as well. Well balanced AMAZINGLY drinkable. This beer is at the top of the list for a reason. I look forward to going to this brewery and trying it on draft!"
" Very glad I finally tried this, would revisit anytime."
"D) An outstanding quad -- perhaps the zenith of quads. If this is the style you prefer, look no further."
"D: Excellent sipping beer. I'd stick to two because of the full body. It fills you up. The price tag is forbidding in terms of drinking it all night as well, so I don't mind."
"Overall, this is my first trappist quad and I really liked it. I wasn't sure if I should age it or if I should just drink it fresh and ultimately decided to drink it fresh. Next, I'll try and find an aged one or age one myself and compare. This is clearly worth its reputation. Cheers!"
"The drinkability is very good, but I'm not knocking people over to get more of it. I guess I expected more from the beer given its reputation, but now that I've had it, I think I'll just stay with my St. Bernardus that I can acquire much easier down in Texas."
"The tastes are not quire as dark and not how I expected given the nose. The malt and yeast do a lot of the talking here. taking over. The fruits are a little more acidic, and much juicier, not as dried, on the palate. The plum flavor really comes through. The body is full with light, but somewhat stinging carbonation and a long fruity and burning finish. I really do not enjoy how hot this drinks right now. Will have to reinvest and lay this down for a couple years."
"A classically fantastic Belgian quad that stands above almost any other I've tasted."
"With great subtle fruit notes and high alcohol presence, Rochefort 10 would serve well as a special occasion beer, a winter warmer, or a holiday beer. Better than most marketed specifically for those purposes."
"I dont know about this one. I know it is supposed to be some world class beer, but I dont really care for it. Its good, but not ""best in the world"" good. Perhaps I am missing the boat on this one, but I dont care for it."
"Wow. Just wow. I have had this before a few times, but after a six month hiatus and expanding my pallet I can really appreciate this more. A truly outstanding brew, gotta tip my hat to those monks!"
"The mouth is creamy with subtle carbonation play on the tongue. The flavors remind me of an old ale. Dark fruits like plum, some licorice, molasses. The booze isn't noted in the flavor but I can feel it a bit. Very smooth mellow Quad. I will definitely get this one again. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it."
"Pours a dark ruby brown colour with a decent amount of head in the chimay glass. Tastes of caramel brown sugar mixed with a nice hint of dark fruits, almost cherry like. Fucking amazingly smooth for the 11.3%. Are you kidding me? 11.3%? That is a joke. No way this beer could be that high. No hint of the alc % at all. Drinks down so smooth. Very tasty beer. Glad I have one more bottle."
"D - It's a big beer. The flavors are great, but their size and complexity makes one enough for me."
"d - well, good thing I buy in cases...top notch beer, my favorite quad. if it weren't for the abv, I would have a few with my meal and for dessert."
"D: Rich and easily drinkable. Where/How is the 11% hidden? Look forward to getting it again."
"overall, it was a nice belgian..would i have again? maybe...belgian isn't my favorite style but it def is worth a try"
"Thick creamy head, almost faded by end of drink, but good lacing. Dark brown color with ruby red highlights. Sweet raisiny aroma, presence of malt and other dark fruits. High alcohol well hidden in aromas. Heavy sweetness continued in flavor. Sweetness, flavored with raisins, prunes and other darker fruits. Alcohol is slightly present at times, but overall well hidden, usually just lending itself to the sweetness and complex flavors of the beer. Unexpectedly drinkable for such a heavy beer. Delicious and savory, great warming beer."
"A definite brew to savor and explore. Many flavors to explore. A lot of character in this one! 11% abv is well hidden!"
"Definitely in top 5 beers that I have tried -- similar to Chimay Blue. Even though it's $5.99/bottle at Jungle Jim's it's worth it!"
"overall: a great beer what a beer this is! one of the best Quads on the planet!"
"Drinkability - The richness and sweetness of this beer, along with the slight burn of alcohol, make this a beer that does not lend itself well to sessioning. However, these qualities also make that first glass, and perhaps the second, a quick and thrilling journey. Moderately drinkable."
"Poured a rich, dark, opaque brown color, with a thin, light brown head, that quickly dissipates. Aromas of freshly baked bread, molasses, dried fruits and chocolate. On the palate, this on is medium bodied and nicely balanced, with prunes, brown bread, raisins, chocolate and sweet sugars, and a little alcoholic punch. A very good beer."
" Just kidding on the children thing."
"For the high ABV, the alcohol seems even more masked in the taste than in the aroma. Very enjoyable to sip and the flavors seem to come out more as it warms up. I expected a world class beer and this did not disappoint."
"D- Very drinkable. Light and easy (especially for 11.3%). Great example of style."
"D- Very strong yet smooth. Definitely a sipping beer. Liquid dessert. Rich and dark. Savor each sip. Long finish of delicious chocolate and dark cherry."
"A nice brown beer with a tan head and a little smooth lacing. The nose has subtle raisins and dark fruit with some malts and touch of alcohol. Very complex taste, full of subtleties ranging from raisins, dark fruits, sweet flat cola, dark sugars, very little anise but it's there mixed with the rest of the flavors and some alcohol. A very nice carbonation which is on the minimal to medium side, the bubbles are tiny. A very complex and interesting quad that everyone should try."
"This is a beer that I have come to love over time. Every time I have it I taste something different than the last. What is it about the monks that make them brew such magical offerings such as this? You can really tell the difference between the water used in this beer vs. other quads/belgians. I think thats what does it, well, that and the years of this yeast being developed. I have read reviews where they say the alcohol is sharp. I don't think so. It is well hidden, for 11.2%. The appearance is what I would expect, dark with lots of sediment. A nice sticky head that sticks with it. Mmmm, the sediment is an added treat IMO. Smell is wonderful, I get raisins, bread, dark currents, and something else I can never quite put my finger on. Taste is fantastic! I like to pour it cold and let it sit for awhile before I taste it. Then I sip on it as it warms, letting my palette really warm up with it. If you tried this cold, then tried another one warm, it is completely different. I prefer it somewhere in the middle. The mouthfeel is good as well, kind of chewy but not too thick. Drinkability is also good, but I would never dream of slamming it. This is one to be savored. Probably in my top 5 favorite beers."
"This beer might make me revisit Chimay Blue and Trois Pistoles, that I rated lower, but I can clearly see how they were similar in character, if not at par in merit."
"D - This is a fantastic beer and the only think would keep me from drinking it too often is the 11.3%."
"This is definitely the best of the Rochefort series, and a fantastic example of a Belgian Quad. This beer is so deep and rich! The beer was a little pricey, so I think this will be an every now and then type beer, but I'm sure glad that I had the opportunity to drink this one."
"D - You could actually have more than one, but sharing a bottle was plenty. This is probably the best Quad ever. And surprisingly the price is not outrageous. I'm keeping another to see if some age makes this even better."
"After having some New Glarus Abt, I wanted to get a Trappist Quad to compare it against. Rochefort knocked this out of the park. Absolutely delicious stuff that is easy to drink despite being a strong beer. Awesome!"
"Absolutely great mouthfeel just what i want from a quad. Carbonation helps the drinkability a lot and for a beer of it's strength it's highly drinkable to the point where I can see myself getting in trouble if I had a few of these in a night."
"Verdict: Powerful and wonderful beer - a must try and worth every ludicrous penny."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night, but at 11% that would be rather silly."
"Pours dark brown with a very light head. Aroma has hints of coffee and chocolate along with the roasted malts. Flavor has much of the same with lots of other flavors I can't recognise. You can taste the strength but not in a bad way. Simply awesome."
"Good drinkability, alcohol is noticeable when swallowing but not too harsh. Pretty easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Tasty, for sure, but every time I drink it, I am satisfied exactly where it finished. I wouldn't crave much more. I've never had this beer on tap, but I'd love the chance, as I've found Abt 12 to be consistently better on tap. This beer may be no exception. Definitely a very tasty Quad, and while the Westy reigns supreme, this is definitely not a huge step down in quality."
"This is an excellent beer. Quite strong, but very tasty. I've only had it via bottle, but have to say that for some reason I thought it tasted beer when I had it in Brussels than when I had it in NYC. Dark color, deep and fruit-filled taste. I'd highly recommend this one."
"For 11.2%, this thing is dang drinkable. You definitely get a nice warming effect from the beer and it is well worth tracking down one."
"D- Very smooth and enjoyable. One bottle was enough for now. Very interested to see what some time will do to this bad boy!"
"DB- A classic of the beer world, I think almost anyone would agree. I prefer 2006 Pannepot over this for Quads but this is still a very good beer."
"D - Overall this is a great beer. The alcohol is disguised quite well which makes it very easy to drink. This is without a doubt my favorite Belgian beer and absolutely my favorite Quad. Those monks sure do know what they're doing!"
"Overall- Glad I finally got around to trying this one. It did not disapoint. I am really starting to appreciate Quads."
"Overall: I kinda figured this would be an amazing beer and it didn't disappoint. Doesn't crack my top 10 but this is definitely great beer!"
"Pours a very dark reddish brown color with a white head that quickly fades to a film on top. Very strong sweet caramel notes coming from the smell, belgian yeasts. The caramel is there, but not nearly as strong in the taste. slight burn from the alcohol is there as well, but nothing terribly overpowering. Very nice malt taste as well. There is a lot going on here. The mouthfeel is great. It feels thicker but light at the same time, slips down the throat with some zip on the tongue. feels like a party in my mouth. This is a very drinkable beer especially given the ABV. I like this beer. I'm glad I tried it and will rate it highly because it is crafted with as much artisanal skill as any beer I've ever had. That said, it's not going to be a go to beer for me, but rather a once in a while treat and not one I would have more than one or two (if I had a 750) of in one night."
"D-somewhat coarse tasting compared to others in this style but still a very good beer to sip. I would drink this beer again."
"I now see why this beer is in the top 10."
"I want another."
"Overall Impression: What a great beer! The flavor just BLOOMS in your senses. Also has a wonderful cognac-like essence. Rochefort is truly one of the best Trappist breweries. World class!"
"Serving type: 330 ml bottle dated 030215"
"This pales in comparison to St. Bernardus 12, but is still an excellent brew."
"I'm drinking my first Westy 12 in 2 days... I hope it can rival..."
"For as strong as the beer is, 11.3% ABV, it's very drinkable. Having said that, the alcohol is present, but hides in the background while you're swimming in all the flavors. It's noticeable, but only slightly. The only thing preventing me from having another is I know the alcohol is too much, and the cost. Everyone must try this at least once."
"D: Just a bit too much alcohol and mouthfeel."
"Notes - This beer is absolutely amazing."
"I'll come back to this one soon as either there was something wrong with me that night or the beer. Hopefully."
"Drinkability: As far as Quads go, this one is really really good. Lots of big flavor, but with a high ABV and strong boozy characteristic I doubt I could enjoy more than one or two of these in an entire evening. That being said, I'm certainly going to enjoy the one I've got, and I'd definitely recommend this brew to anybody."
"T - high alcohol content is fairly well-hidden but remains readily noticeable."
"Seeking older samples and putting 4 of these in the cellar for later."
"More, please. Thank you."
"Bottle. Has a date on the label of 030215 which I am guessing is the best on date 5 years from now. Pours an opaque, murky brown with red highlight color. Fluffy tight tiny bubbled 1 finger head that coasters. Sweet smelling with aromas of fruit, especially dark cherry and plum. The taste is very good, sweet, but good. Nice medium creamy mouthfeel. The taste is a very nice blend of subtle spice, plum, raisins, and dark fruit. I get a lingering caramel flavor as well. Very solid overall, nice and clean. Subtle hint of alcohol is present throughout."
"Drinkability- what can i say about this beer that already hasnt been said, its definitely one of the best beers i have ever tasted before, its right up there to me with saint bernardus abt. 12 as my favorite beer to this point in any style, i couldnt tell you right off hand which is better with out direct side by side comparison but im having this one now so it tastes the best lol, this is a treat and one everyone should try, its rich complex and a long lingering treat to slowly sip and savor, while i know i can get more im gonna probably go stock up for the holidays, hard for beers to get much better then this, just perfection in the world of beer"
"I would absolutely have this again. An over all winner in my book."
"Pours a dark brown, similar to a cola color while it produced a tall 3 finger light tan head, which took a while to dissipate. Has fantastic lacing. Smells of of grapes and raisin, reminded me of a red wine in some ways. Very malty and fruity, tasting raisin, fig and grapes - very sweet. Alcohol level was warming and just perfect. Feels nothing like 11.3% and is extremely smooth. I intended to drink this slowly and pair with a sharp cheddar but after the first sip, I chose to drink it alone. I liked this so much, I drank it more quickly than intended, leaving me wanting more but not having another bottle readily available. This beer is perfect to me and deserving of my first perfect score."
"Tasted from bottle purchased at Famous Lombard. Pours a muddy amber brown with a fizzy but thick white head that recedes to lace on the outside of the glass. Nose is sweet dried fruites (raisin, fig, prune) with caramelized malt and light citrus. The alcohol is definitely present on the nose. The flavors are not quite as dark, with the malt and yeast taking over. The fruits are a little more acidic, and much juicier, not as dried, on the palate. The plum flavor really comes through. The body is full with light, but somewhat stinging carbonation and a long fruity and burning finish. It is easy to understand why this beer is as highly rated as it is."
"D - This beer is like soufle or crème brulee, way too much for an everyday affair but if you don't have one every now and again you'll probably die. Take this beer seriously or it will end you!"
"Taste is sweet-spicey, a lot of spicey-sweet fruit, rich brown bread with hint of cinnamon rolls, dark raisin and port, with iron and mineral joining in the finish and after taste, faint hints of oreo cookies and wood. It has an excellent, full, rich feel with some faintly medicinal-tingly character and feel. It's excellent, has a rich, strong character with some complexity, but it is a little too thick, heavy-duty and sweet and fails to achieve the incredible balance and complexity of character that the #8 does. Then again, I suppose that that is part of the nature of this beer, so much higher in alcohol, and for the alcohol, the character and drinkability are really very high."
"I prefer malt-based beers. I love sours and picked up a Supplication with my Trappistes Rochefort 10. I really like Supplication but I'm fighting the urge to exchange the Supplication and get two more of these. A fine example of what exemplary brewing techniques can produce without a bunch of wild ingredients."
"This is a beer that is high on the ABV% with 11.3, and quite strong with it's personality. But it's also friendly, fruity, spice-filled and pretty thin. It's a totally drinkable beer to unwind to, appreciate and share with other beer lovers. A beautiful beer to have with meals that will keep the laughs and love flowing."
"D: Less bubbly than 8, and all in all more agreeable to my palate."
"Drinkability -- For the style, this is about as drinkable as it gets. Very satisfying. This is the kind of beer I want to kick back with after an awful day at work. A very nice quad. Can't speak for Westvleteren 12, but I think I may like St. Bernardus a hair more."
"D: Quite drinkable but not a chugger. Share a bottle."
"A great Overall Belgian Beer!!!"
"Overall - I'm going to have to have some St.Bernardus Abt 12 and Chimay Blue again to decide which my favorite Belgian ale is again, but this is one of the top picks for sure. Then again, one thing I love about Quads and BSDA's is the wide range of flavors and interpretations out there. You can try two different examples of the style, and they may both taste pretty different. But enough rambling! If you're a big quad fan, and have some extra dinero laying around, this is a must-seek."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, although, I generally keep it at one per session ... it packs a punch."
"The quad's are perhaps my favorite style of beer and this ranks up with the best of them. Would recommend this to anyone and it's becoming extremely easy to find. Usually in the $5 to $7.50 per bottle range in most of southern Illinois and Paducah, KY."
"D- I love this beer. Way different than what I was expecting so that was nice. Everything about this beer seems to compliment it. The sweet and bitter, the colour, smell. Everything is in balance with the beer. As it warms the feeling changes to going from the sweet to the bitter and warming more and more. One of the best beer experiences I've had as of yet."
"D-Drinkability is awesome for a beer this big. I was prejudiced because of the hype. But, my only regret is there only remain a couple more sips in my glass and no more bottles in the fridge. Rated slightly lower due to cost."
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy brown color that is reminiscent of cola (lots of ruby highlighting.) However, it's got some haziness and some bigger yeast chunks floating around. Creamy tan head fades rather quickly other than around the edges where it lasts quite some time. The smell is pretty sweet dominated by dark fruits. There's raisins, dates, brown sugar, chocolate, pears, banana, and spice. Lots of sweetness once it hits your mouth along with a warming alcohol. There's some sweet breadiness as well as a molasses component. The raisins and dates also make a reappearance in the taste. Mouthfeel was slightly different than expected. Although it was creamy, there was a bit thinner feel at first. The creaminess then wiped this out. I'd enjoy a little less carbonation. Only my personal taste, but there are other quads out there I've like better."
"D: LOVE LOVE LOVE this beer. Will definitely be drinking this again!"
"To summarize: Meh."
"Drinkability: Exceptionally deceptive in it's delivery of 11% ABV. Very very good."
"At 11.3% ABV and a small serving size, you've really got to pace yourself when drinking this. It's damn tasty and easily quaffable. The booziness becomes a bit more pronounced as you let it warm, so it's definitely a sipper. Another beer that absolutely deserves all the accolades it gets."
"Very smooth yet very tasty with a taste of fruit dark and thick. Alcohol content on the higher side yet blends nicely with the fruit and content"
"Not difficult to drink, but at 11.3 abv, this is not a beer you would want to be pouring back in any great quantity."
"Really big mouthfeel, rich, thick, perfect carb. Wow, for such a big beer the alcohol is well hidden, but it is a little cloying so I'm gonna dock it half a point."
"Pours with a large, ultra creamy, beige head covering a murky brown body. Thick lacing and good retention; this is what a beer should look like. Aroma is floral with rich fruits, currants and sweetness, but the aroma isn't very strong/pungent. Alcohol is noticeable in the taste, aftertaste is salty and yeasty. Dark fruits abound. A solid beer."
"The initial taste I get is of sweet dark fruit...raisins....even some grapes. This is followed by a very thick brown sugar/molasses taste that goes through the body and into the finish. The high ABV is certainly noticeable on the finish, but could certainly be worse considering what the ABV is. It does cause a bit of astringency on the swallow, though. Some sweetness hangs around after the swallow, but all in all seems pretty dry."
"D: 11.2 fl. oz. was plenty. Because the stuff has an ABV of 11.3, I'm feeling pretty good!"
"D- very drinkable one of the most deceptive beers ive drank"
"Extremely sweet smelling and sugary, but this does not represent the much more balanced taste. Thick mouthfeel and deep taste, just pure delight. And you can not mess with it for the huge 11.3 abv, while you could never detect that. A powerhouse."
"This one had intimidated me for a while, but now that I've had it, I intend to get this again. Very sippable, like a desert rather than something to be consumed."
"D- this seems great for dessert"
"Drinkability: It's alcohol and size make splitting a small bottle appropriate, but this is a beer I want to sip over a long time. It's as drinkable as it should be."
"Recommended!"
"definitely an amazing beer. a little high in the % of alcohol so one is about all one could savor before getting some numb taste buds."
"O: IMO, this is a perfect Quad. The one that all quads should be compared to. Yes, that means beating out westy 12. I think that westy finishes light in body, where as rochefort 10 has the body and viscosity representing the style, but of course, open to beer geek interpretation."
"D - A very tightly flavored trappist quad that provides a very rich and complex flavor profile which is dangerously drinkable. Fantastic beer overall!"
"Cheers..."
"D: Anytime. Very good beer overall. Very drinkable. Very dangerous."
"D- its a classic for a reason I haven't found an trappist ale I didn't like but this one comes close to the top. Richly flavored and complex, yet easy like an everyday drinker. Right up my alley."
"Well, there is a reason this beer is in the Top 10 on this site. Complex, bold, and Amazing. These monks are onto something here."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot and really enjoyed sipping on it. An extremely flavorful quad. Definitely worth to pick up and sip on and the flavors really did grow on me throughout the glass."
"Dark, turbid brown with a pretty looking creamy tan head that melts slowly leaving spiderweb lace on the glass. The aroma is outstanding, mascerated dark fruit, brown sugar, dark rum and a peaty smokiness. Concentrated dark fruity flavors, raisin and fig with toasted oak and vanilla notes. A beautifully complex and well balanced Quad that absolutely stands up to any other I've had.. including Westvleteren 12. Full bodied and smooth with bright carbonation that adds to the drinkability. A fantastic beer that refuses to be boozy even at over 11% abv. World class."
"Drinkability - Very simple, many spices mix with warm alcohol and sweet aftertaste to create one of thee best beer flavors on the planet. You dont need a cute review, this is a top 5 beer ive ever tasted in my life. I will be a old, old man and still will enjoy this beer. Buy it or die!"
"D- easy enough to finish this tiny bottle. i dont think i like this one as much as i like the 8. still havnt tried the 6...i should get on that."
"Quads aren't my specialty but I can tell this one's pretty good. I don't love the style however this one will please most everyone."
"This is my favorite beer. Sadly I doubt anything I could say would do it justice. An amazing dark beer with an alcohol flavor that is easily drinkable. Great sipping and social beer that I wouldn't recommend chugging down like water. Last time I tried chugging these down I woke up with a hangover in the bathroom floor with remorse for spending $9 a beer. Pours nearly black with a nice creamy head most of the time. I smell raisins and alcohol in it most times. Sometimes I get a fig smell. 9 times out of 10 I end up with yeast in my glass when I pour it but I enjoy the yeast. I keep at least two of these around at all times."
"Drinkability: With everyday availability, this is a steal at what I can pick it up for. World class and a true treat. Will be stocking up on this."
"Pours a very dark and murky brown that is almost black. When held up to my desk lamp, rich ruby can be seen around the edges, but the center might as well be an abyss. The head is light tan in color, extremely creamy and has wonderful retention and lacing. On closer inspection, the lacing appears to shimmer. What's with that? The aroma is an incredible mix of raisin, fruit leather, molasses, tart cherries, chocolate, and clove. There is so much going on that every time I take a sniff it is like I pick out something different. One smell that that I do find myself searching for is alcohol. It seems to be almost completely hidden in the aroma. I take a sip and the complex flavors cascade over my tongue. Once again, dark dried fruits seem to be center stage, but are quickly followed by burnt and flavorful dark sugar. Spice notes of clove and star anise also enter the mix. There is also a wonderful leathery earthiness in the flavor that gives this brew a real old world sort of charm. The alcohol is more present in the flavor, but seriously, this thing hides its ABV very well. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium and has a nice smoothness and a long, but delicate finish. I am not a huge fan of quads, as they tend to be a little bit hot, but this is like a steel fist in a velvet glove. It's a sipper, but goes down easily for style and is quite enjoyable. This is a must try beer. Period."
"I would not take another of these if you gave it to me. Biggest waste of $7 ever. I sure hope the other two work out better..."
"If I was stranded on a desert island and could only bring one beer, I would choose this one."
"Overall a true legend of a beer. All praise is warranted for sure."
"This is every bit as good to me now as it was 4 years ago, a true classic."
"A beer that you can really sit down and enjoy slowly."
"D: It is completely drinkable. This is a high ABV beer that doesn't have any extreme flavors that might be off-putting to any one particular fan of a beer style. It is a beer that a person could drink more than once, simply to pick out new found flavors."
"A pleasure to drink,"
"An easy drinker. A very interesting and complex brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a light carbonation. Drinkable? yep"
"I poured into my glass to a couple inches of tan head. It is a murky brown color. The aroma is sweet with raisins and brown sugar. There is also some alcohol in there. The smell kind of reminds me of cinnamon raisin bread. The taste is sweet and laced with alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium. I goes down pretty well for the ABV. I'm not a big Belgian fan but the recent quads I've had may bring me around."
"D-This is a truly exceptional beer and easily the most drinkable quad I've ever come across."
"The only thing that keeps this from being an A+ beer is the alcohol burn. St. Bernardus, Westy, and other Trappist beers manage to hide the alcohol a little better than Rochefort does. However, I am sure this beer ages like a champ....now I just need to be patient enough to let it age!"
"I would have again (but in fall or winter, it was a little bit hot yersterday, lol)"
"Drinkability- If I had the option, and the wallet, to drink this beer all night I, without a doubt, would. It's smooth feel and sweet, but not to sweet, taste makes me able to drink many more of these. The only problem, the relatively high alcohol content is the only reason I can think of not to order another,"
"jd"
"Overall, Rochefort 10 is a gorgeous Trappist ale that compares to the best of them, including Westy 12. It's packed with complex flavours and literally glides across the tongue while drinking. Don't let the wider distribution fool you: this is a world class beer that's well worth the money. An exemplary quadrupel."
"Poured into a Rochefort chalice a beautiful dark brown color with a tight white head and little bits of brown flakes floating in it. The smell is very complex: raisins, leather,. brown sugar, caramel, a fruit that I can't quite put my finger on, maybe cherry...I could go on and on. The taste is the same, each sip reveals a different layer of complexity, always fairly sweet and malty with a touch of alcohol. A perfectly brewed beer."
"Drinkability: Awesome. I want more. One of the best beers in the world"
"D - if I was stuck on a deserted island and could only have one thing for the rest of my life..."
"Drinkability: It's exceptional. Here's the thing, being at 11.3% abv it's obviously a sipping beer. It's complexity is worth taking it super slow, anyway. It's absolutely delicious so it's hard not to indulge yourself a little."
"Pours an Extremely dark brownish-red color with a nice creme-vanilla color head. The scent is dark fruits, alcohol, and a whole lotta dark grapes. The taste is just crazy complex. I initially pick up candy sugars and caramel, followed by some tasty dark fruits (figs, grapes, plums, dates), then it's followed by some tasty yeast flavors. The Belgian yeast strands make the bread flavor really come through. And the alcohol warmness really comes through as the beer warms up a bit. The mouthfeel is very nice, but it tends to be a little watery...I thought this beer would be a little more full-bodied. It's hard to explain...because the taste of this beer is not watery at all, but the mouthfeel could be a bit more FULL (i guess). Drinkability is so scary...I cannot tell this is such a high ABV beer."
"D: Very drinkable, and alcohol is right on."
"D: Considering the consistency of this beer, compared to most heavy bodied quads, this is extraordinary. Carbonation is on point, good crispness for a quad again. God bless the Trappist breweries."
"Mouthfeel is mediuml with a slightly fizzy amount of carbonation."
"O - Incredibly drinkable and a fantastic accessible version of the style. Finished tied for 3rd with Westy 12 for me. 4/4.5/4/4.5/4.5"
"D- I would rate this as very drinkable if you plan on sipping. Watch out for the ABV."
"Notes - This one is a quality beer. It has it all, looks, flavor, complexity, body."
"D: Why did I wait so long to try this? Actually, I should have waited even long so that my palate could appreciate it more. Not a beer I could drink every day, but definitely one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Buy this now."
"D: It's delicious and I could sip on it all day if it weren't for the prohibitively high price and ABV. I'm going to be sure to pick up a few more bottles to cellar and compare to this fresher experience."
"[After the hour passed: the taste intensified many times over as the quad warmed up. The alcohol taste was dominant by the end - quite powerful. One is more than enough! I look forward to another soon.]"
"This is quite possibly the best beer I have ever had in my life. If not for the steep price of this beer, I would probably not buy any other beers but this. This is a trappist beer, but is very different from most of the other trappist beers out there because it is exceptionally dark, and does not have the ""wheaty"" aftertaste associated with most belgiums. The beer pours very dark, and does contain sedement, with a cloudy dark appearance. The smell is a bit smoky, with intense caramel and chocolately tones. The taste is very, very smoothe for such a dark beer, with a very sweet finish, with a little touch of smokiness and bittering, but both working in accord with the heavy chocolate/caramel flavors. I have never drank more than 2 at one sitting due to the price point of this beer, but 2 will definitely put you in a stupor. Perfect beer to accompany a steak, chop, or shank. Would be the perfect beer if not for the price point!"
"Bottle, from blankboy. Dark murky brown pour. Aroma is just awesome. Blueberries, black currants, sugar cane and a slight wild aroma, kind of earthy/wet hay. Taste is fruity and sweet with a slight herbal bitterness towards the very end. Palate is hot and full of alcohol and it lingers and lingers to no end bringing back all the enjoyable flavors."
"I realized this is my 200th review. I thinked I inadvertantly picked a good beer to do it with. It poured an extremely dark brown with dark'ish head. Tons of lacing and head retention. The smell has lots of dried fruit - cherry and plum mostly - and a hint of sweet chocolate. Some brown sugar too. Flavour is just out of this world. Very nice carbonation level. If the Westy 12 really is better than this one, I can't wait to try it someday (I hope)."
"D - I could sip on this all night! I didn't know what to expect from this one, despite being on the Top 100 list. This is an incredible beer, I will definitely be picking up more of these. Can't wait to pair this with a dessert of some kind, just screams digestif to me."
"I'd had it before a few times, but when I took the time to savor and examine it, I made a conclusion: I need to keep this on hand at all times, for it is perhaps one of the best beers in the world."
"Highly carbonated, this beer is thick enough to handle it. My wife says it's like drinking chocolate mousse. The sweetness supports that comment--there are elements of chocolate. Lots of malted sugars. The swallow is more of the same but the alcohol is strangely muted."
"D - Nothing about this beer is hard to drink. Such an accessible, warming, and wonderfully complex, flavorful beer. Definitely a sipper, but I could sip it all day."
"This boldness in both the flavor and aroma is impressive and enjoyable, but it comes at a bit of a cost, as the flavor starts getting quite sweet as the beer warms. In addition, in contrast to some other Belgian (and Belgian-style) beers, the texture is largely unremarkable and does not provide any relief from the sweet fruitiness of the flavor. Overall, this beer can serve as a benchmark against which the flavor of other quads and Belgian strong dark ales are compared, but the potency of flavors is just a bit too much, and this beer breaks down just short of excellence."
"D: For a quad, very good. But the alcohol aftertaste knocks it down for me a bit from the high standard set by its companion, westy."
"5O: Is there even any debate that this beer merits a perfect overall score? One of my all-time favourites, if infrequently consumed. Ageing improved the hell out of what was already a nigh perfect beverage. I must get more to lay down. Supremely recommended. World-class. Must have."
"Pours a fizzy dark brown with about a finger of tan-colored head that disappears quickly. Smells of caramel & fruit. Taste is malty with signs of hoppy bitterness throughout. This is a full-bodied beer with higher-than-average carbonation and an oily feel. Mild alcoholic warmth at the end -- this is one smooth quad!"
"I was hoping that this readily-available quad would beat out the much harder to acquire Westy 12. Unfortunately, this could not compete. By comparison, the Rochefort 10 seemed almost like an extreme beer. It definitely had a better, stronger aroma. But unfortunately the taste was a bit too strong with an excessive alcohol presence. Despite being aged for 9 more months, this did not mellow out enough to be a close enough in comparison to the much softer Westveltern 12. It is a decent beer, but not something I will seek out very often."
"Very strong, warming beer with incredible complexities. Just an amazing beer, and it is very easy to see why this is considered one of the best in the world."
"This beer requires something strong to stand up to it food-wise; perhaps ribs done well, or a really well-prepared steak. Tasty!"
"Drinkability: Not a session beer by any stretch, but certainly drinkable as an even sit down brew, I don't think I'd have this with a meal."
"carbonation provides the illusion of body. pretty drinkable other than the high abv. more or less a prototypical quad."
"The drinkability is amazing for a beer of this strength. I could easily and comfortably get through this in 5 minutes, though I certainly wont."
"D- insanely drinkable. The alcohol doesn't smack you upside the head at all, though I wouldn't want to pound these back for the hell of it. Just tastes so amazing. Perfect beer to celebrate my 24th birthday and 100th review with."
"Overall, the Rochefort 10 is a decent quad, but does not even come close to the St. Bernardus 12 or the Westvleteren 12. I've had the 10 before and each time it just seems like a bit of an alcohol bomb without much going on. The 8 in my opinion is a much better beer from Rochefort. However, I've still got two more 10's in the cellar, so I think I'll put another 5-10 years on those before I touch them."
"I get a lot alot of alcohol warm immediately with dark fruit flavors that have a bit of sweetness. But this is my no means a sweet beer, there is enough bitterness in the back end to keep it balanced. This is my first Quad so I don't have much to compare it to. Carbonation is on the high side, giving it bit of a champagne-like quality. Definitely a dry beer that doesn't leave much after it's hit the tongue."
"Very delicious beer. Roasty, floral aroma. Great thick chocolate like appearance, with a thick foam. Malty flavor with hints of caramel, roast, malt, sublte coffee notes. More of a flat feel on the palate, but still full, with a long malty finish. A unique beer that warms you."
"D: really good quad that I've had a couple times now and is always tasty. It definitely deserves to be in the top 100. I also enjoyed how robust the beer was."
"pours a opaque brown color that is heavily particulate. extra large tan fluffy head sticks around for a while. excellent lacing remains as beer recedes. strong caramel raisin nutty smell, taste is the same with molasses, and toasty burnt hints. long flavor duration that finishes heavily bitter. alcohol very apparent but not overwhelming. creamy sticky texture. all around very good brew. alcohol will creep on this one."
"Get your hands on some delicious meat and cheese and take your time with this beautiful brew."
"IMO, in the final analysis this is simply a world class beer. when i first began drinking quads i started on this guy, and then worked my way around a fair bit (westvleteren 12 still to go), sampling some great beer, but in the end nothing has come close. every time i return to rochefort 10 i'm reminded why it stands alone - hype or no, this is probably my favorite beer of all time. well done, monks of the brasserie de rochefort. well done."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Pours a nice dark brown with a nice three-finger head that lingers througout with a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Lacing is excellent throughout. The aroma is comprised of fruit and alcohol. The flavor is full of fruit, malt, nuts, and big alcohol notes. It was medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall I am glad I got to try this and am happy it is readily available to myself. The aroma and flavor of this brew is nothing short of awesome. Definitely try this given the opportunity if you have not yet."
"I feel very fortunate that this quad is widely available in the Boston area along with St. B Abt 12. Are these 2 quads on par with the 'legend' Westy 12?? I don't know but they're pretty darn good. I haven't had a lot of quads but I've had a lot of beer and this Rochefort 10 is great!"
"I need to try the Rochefort 8 side-by-side with the 10. But I loved the 8 and rated it an A+, 4.7 I think. I have to give this a slight bit less solely because this was off the cask at Muggs in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It has a beautiful sour vegetable taste. Crisp and nice hops. Wonderful brew."
"The flavor is delicious, but I could see how this brew could benefit from some aging. The alcohol was very noticeable, at times making it hard for the fruit in the flavor to shine like it really should. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was delicious. My only quip is that the fruit tasted great with the small bit of caramel present, and at time the alcohol made it less noticeable. I'm sure if it were aged for a bit this issue would not be present, and this beer would be truly spectacular."
"mouthfeel is quite exceptional. warming and creamy, and the carbonation is on the money."
"D: I couldn't drink these all day since they are heavy, but all beers of this type are heavy. There's nothing particular about this one that makes it more appealing than others of its type."
"This is a very heavy rich beer, that has some alcohol heat. In my opinion it's a little harsher than other quads and not as well balanced, but that makes it a perfect aging candidate. There are some harsh medicinal notes that I think would mellow out and blend well with the beer over time. No doubt a good beer though."
"Well balanced and simply deliciously drinkable; a heavenly brew."
"Drinkability: Wow, an 11% abv beer that is very easy to drink. Just fantastic."
"Overall- Enjoy it slowly. A top-class beer that's a real treat. Would hate to have this too often, as I would not want to get too used to the quality of this kind of beer."
"Between this and Orval, I'd have a hard time picking my favorite beer."
"Overall: Overall the beer did not disappoint. This is a fancy beer, and tastes very good. The only thing that is throwing me are these brown chunks that are floating in the beer. I'm not sure if it's from the specific bottle or something else. If anyone knows, please send me a BA beer mail. Thanks."
"Not really my favorite style (I prefer Belgian tripels) from the abbeys, and not my favorite in the style either. That said, it's a pretty tasty brew, and I'm having fun drinking it. My wallet isn't as happy, though..."
"D: I could drink this all day long. Perfect balance."
"D- so, me and my buddies put the other 3 bottles into the beer bong and... joking. put the torches and pitchforks away. for such a sippin' brew this one cannot be put down. literally and figuratively. it is all around perfection. trappist brewers are geniuses of their trade and this may be the finest i've had thus far. in this case i saved the best for first and quadfest 2010 has kicked off to a glorious start."
"drinkability: Goes down like a very good session beer. Unbelievable."
"Drinkability: I do want this again. My favorite still remains the 6, but I was blown away by the complexity of this beer. I like the toffee and fruit taste. A sipper that I want more of."
"D - I would drink this beer until I fell out of my chair, though the 11% ABV and the $7-8/beer cost makes me think twice about it. Nevertheless, I covet every drop in the glass."
"Just a great Belgian Quad from a master brewery."
"D- Very good and easy to drink. I really could not see myself drinking more than one in a night, but a great sipper to enjoy."
"Comments: A topnotch example of the Quad style. It shares many of the qualities of a fine brandy."
"Drinkability is also very good. High ABV, but I could very easily reach for another. I would guess it is at 60 degrees or so as I write this and it is only getting better. Two of these stretched out over a few hours would make for an enjoyable evening. Wish I had purchased two."
"One to sip and savor, for sure! Not overly sweet or boozy, this is a wonderful and complex Belgian, though I prefer the flavor profile of the Rochefort 8 just a bit more."
"Overall impression- absolutely worth drinking."
"Not a beer to guzzle or gulp, but to quaff and enjoy. It's 11.3% APV makes it impossible to pound these down with some bros, but I can see having another. This beer could just as easily be served with a steak as it could being used as an after dinner digestive."
"Overall: A beer of the ages this is... with true craftsmanship and art infused into its flavor and feel. A must have at some point in your life if you are a lover of fine ale. My highest regards to the monks who craft this ale..."
"D: Alcohol flavor is some what hidden making the beer very drinkable. I could put a few back without any problem, which is what I did."
"Drinkability: Awesomeness. Alcohol is hidden, so watch out."
"Overall: This is a fantastic brew, nearly perfect in my opinion. Will definitely be on my shopping list again."
"A good bit more complex than the St. Bernardus Abt 12, but I'm not sure it's better, or maybe I don't like it more. It's not a cheap beer by any means, but worth it."
"This is what makes drinking beer a great experience. A great pour of dark ruby red. Which leads to the great aroma of plums, raisins, and a sweet brandy smell. Taste is superb! A warming touch of sweet raisins, spices, and a pleasant sweet boozy/brandy port thing. This is the beer to end the evening with. An outstanding example of what a Quad is and should be. Very easy to drink and a super experience for the tastebuds."
"I concur with the overall BA review and that of the Bros, and then some. Avail yourself of it if possible."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy smoothness and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's an excellent tasting beer. Overall it's an excellent tasting and drinking beer that I really enjoyed."
"D Have one every so often, if you do not, you will be missing out on a high quality beer."
"M/D: I know this is a great beer, very complex. I would have to drink this more then I have to understand it all. Mouth feel is awesome, smooth and rich, as far as drink ability this one can be sipped for quite some time."
"D: Not one I would tangle with more than once in a sitting. High abv and complex flavors makes this a one hitter quitter for me. Very delicious non the less. I can see where the hype comes from."
"Drinkability: If this beer was cheaper I might be an alky. Very easy to drink. Much better as it warms."
"A masterpiece of a beer. A absolute treat, one of the true greats,has the perfect blend of malt and bitterness.Tastes of fruit and spice. Alcohol not that noticable in taste, but definitely in effect!Overall, this is a unique and incredible beer! This one poured a very large, foamy head which took a while to settle. Sweet and complex, a wonderful brew.Smooth, creamy, and as close to perfect as a beer can be."
"that I revisit one of the most highly regarded ales in the world. I can easily say that it was a worthwhile effort. I'm not sure that in 2006, my first years in the beer world, I was able to truly appreciate the complex-yet-delicate nature of this outstanding ale. I stand with the masses and recommend this as one of the best brews available in the states."
"Overall, an amazing beer. There's really nothing like it around. Good enough to prompt me to write my first review in 2 1/2 years."
" I loved this beer. Seriously. Can't wait to have another"
"Now for the most important part. Taste. Yum. A hearty malt body with a residual sweetness that is perfectly balanced leaving you wondering where the 11+% alcohol is hidden away. Raisin dominates with other fruity notes and a wonderfully soft finish that I can't describe. A creamy mouthfeel with a light and lovely carbonation. A great and easily drinkable beer, save for it coming back to pound you with its hidden booze."
"Drinkability: Truly remarkable. I was expecting a great brew and it exceeded my expectations. Its complex, unique, fits the style, sessionable (if you consider how hard it is to session a Quad) and very elegant. Will surely have again if possible."
"D: For such a strong beer, it is relatively easy to drink, especially as it warms up."
"33cl bottle: This one pours a dark caramel brown color. There was quite a bit of a tan head on it that lingers awhile. A bit of alcohol in the nose, but many other aromas present, all very subtle and blending together into something wonderful. Definitely some dark fruits, with a hint of raisin on top. An absolute taste explosion on the tongue. Some sweetness, with caramel and toffee in there. Maybe some vanilla and a host of fruits blending together. A great treat! Pricey, but I don't mind buying this one once in a while. Definitely one of the best."
"Trappistes Rochefort 10 is a world-class beer. You'd be hard-pressed to find a beer that better exemplifies the term ""craft beer."" This is stupendously crafted. A beer like this can only be the product of a wealth of knowledge executed over hundreds of years. I'd advise you to take advantage of its existence."
"D- This goes down smoothly so it's probably one that sneaks up on you quick if you have too many."
"This is a solid beer, not exactly in love with it like some of the higher rated beers I've had, but I think it is just the style. I will try to review it again after i have had some more like it."
"D- This one is obviously a sipper with the high ABV but it goes down smoothly. A solid brew all around but I was expecting a little something more from this one."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown, pretty hazy, big head forms and goes but leaves a metric ass tonne of lacing. Smell is amazingly complex; almost weissbier like banana/clove esters and phenols abound, grapefruit, oaky vanilla, lots of malt, slight hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy, banana and clove once again, alcohol, earthy, oaky vanilla again, tastes oak aged, honey, a little bitterness from the hops but those take a back seat. Almost an armagnac vinousity (word?) to it, amazing. Very full mouth, warms all the way down, thick and chewy, perfect carbonation."
"My hats off to the monks who brew this stuff for making this strong of a beer this drinkable."
"That remains in my top5. Each time I drink it, it is just superb. It's a heavy beer, yes. The glass itself, well, not that remarkable. But the taste is so good. Sweet, but not siroup-sweet. Alcohol taste, but not too much (although :). Dark, very dark, but not too. Vive the trappists."
"Excellent beer. Most Excellent."
"Admittedly, this can be a bit of a powerhouse ABV wise, but it is still a rewarding experience. I think I respect it more than enjoy it and I'm under the impression that this will grow on me after the 9th, 10th and 11th tries."
"D: This and St. Bernardus are easily my favorite quads. The pricetag, however, are not. Easy drinkin, but I allow myself only one every so often with the price and alcohol to factor. Would love to have a fridge full of these."
"D - My only regret is that I only bought one bottle of this (price made me a little nervous). I will be going back and purchasing more the next chance I get. One of the most drinkable and best tasting beers that I have ever had the pleasure of trying."
"Poured a transparent ruby brown into a chalice after letting it warm up for about an hour from fridge temperature. The caramel head rapidly dissipated. Strong carbonation. Prominent fruity sweet smells. Alcohol is definitely there but still very smooth. Very drinkable, only the high alcohol keeps it out of session territory."
"if you forget about the alcohol(or not) how could you not want to drink this all night. truly world class. i cant wait to see how it ages. a must have for ANY beer drinker."
"The body contributes a creaminess to the mouthfeel that is juxtaposed by an effervescence from the very lightly fizzy carbonation. Spicy and tingly in the finish. Feels a little sugary on your tongue after it goes down."
"D: a great let it warm up over an hour or so and sip it slow."
"Cheers Lads"
"4.8/5.0"
"Drinkability - A huge sipper. I had this over the course of a couple hours. A definite one and done type of drink. I have been putting off having this one for quite some time but am thankful I have another in the cellar."
"This beer is epic, in every sense of the word. I have tried this many times before, and I always cower at the thought of even attempting to review it. I simply don't think I can do it justice. There is so much complexity, power, and finesse that it seems that a novel could be written it its regard. Surely I am waxing poetic, but this is one of only a handful (like three or four beers) that deserve this type of enamoring verbiage. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, it's consuming in its alcohol level. And yes, it nearly defies accurate description, like trying to decipher ancient script. But none of that matters, because although this beer is seemingly scary, it is almost universally well received among (even among the non beer nerd crowd), something that most beers above 11% ABV simply cannot say."
"This beer is a pleasure to drink; everything is balanced and in place. The alcohol and calories will limit how many Ill enjoy."
"D: Amazing brew here. If this was aged for a bit I would enjoy it more, but that would only increase my liking for it. I'd buy it again if I could find it."
"This was fantstic! The beeer pours a dark chocolate brown with a foamy tan head with those fine bubbles Belgium beers are known for. On the nose I picked up a bit alcohol, but then agian it is 11%, followed by notes of caramle, apples, raisin, and molasses. The palate was medium bodied and suprisingly smooth considering the high ABV with notes of coffecake and raspberries and a earthy finish"
"D- Right now I think it's just tooo fresh. This needs a while in the cellar. The beer is just very hot."
"This beer is very complex and it improves as it warms. I wish I would have waited longer with it out of the fridge. Interesting beer this is."
"D: Awesome; I wouldn't even know it was 11.3% ABV."
"Glad I finally got to try this, and it did not disappoint. I am sure I'll be buying more of these, as it is a steal at $5.29/bottle. An excellent value, highly recommended."
"overall a very good quad."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Fine carbonation. Coats the tongue with sweet flavor."
"This is an amazing beer. After having a Westy 12 last week this is another great follow up."
"pours a murky, muddy chocolate brown with a khaki two finger head that slowly dissipated. the smell is dominated by a nutty, candied sweetness, complimented with backrounds of chocolate and grain. i can't stop smelling, it's so great. the taste is phenomenal. alcohol warmth upfront, dark fruits, and tons of toffee malts that are just so nice. cherries and complexity. different flavors in every wonderful sip. nutmeg and chocolate and raisins. the mouthfeel is absolutely charming, and the drinkability....um, for $5.39 a bottle? yes please. this is the best quad i've had to date. truly inspiring."
"Easily in the top 3 of my favorite beers, Deep complex flavor, dark fruit,malt, nut...slight alcohol warmth,thin foamy head, that sticks to the mustashe, mmm good! I will save a few of these to try every 6 months or so. . Every sip is a feast for the whole mouth. It's freakin perfect. Never mind the 11 % ABV, it tastes like a 6.0%! Thank you, Belgian Monks!"
"At 11.3 % it would be dubious at best to recommend drinking too many of these. And yet, the alcohol is subtly sublimated beneath the transfixingly deep, sweet flavors that pervade the liquid. I want another, need another, and yet know I should not have another."
"An excellent beer, lots of different layers and a great creamy body. A great dessert beer, fantastic!"
"Overall: A top quality beer all around. There is a reason this beer is rated so highly. If you see it, buy it."
"D - Definately a world class offering... Sophisticated... Stellar all the way around... Insanely drinkable considering the 11.3% ABV..."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability would be better if this was aged a little. Again, I think I had a pretty fresh bottle, I would really like to see what this one is like with about 6 months to a year on it. But overall, a very nice example of the style. Skal."
"exceptional! The best quad I have tried to this day. The color is off from normal quads with brownish chunky purple but with a beautiful diminishing head. The nose is a truck load of perfectly ripe fruit fresh from the picking with yeast and a light sour tartness on the nose. The palate love this beer. Incredibly smooth and balanced with dark cherry sweetness up front followed by a tart yeast finish. There is very little alcohol present which is amazing since it is 11.3%. Amazing beer. I will cellar my other bottle for a great deal of time. God bless the belgians."
"Suggestion to beeradvocate.com: disallowing non-english reviews will create a bias to your aggregated results. I suggest that you work to develop a way to allow non-english speakers to review on your site. This will lend further authenticity to your rankings and reviews. Thanks!"
"This is a long time sipping beer, not because its too hot, or not easy to drink, but because it's the only way to properly do it justice. After finishing one of these, almost anything else you could grab would not seem appealing....unless it was a second Rochefort. Well done Monks."
"Pours a murky dark brown with visible sediment settling down. It has slight orange highlights with a thin and lacy off white head. The aroma is sweet with a nose of grains, dark fruits, and a smooth candied background. The drink is smooth and has a big malty sweet and vinous flavor. There are also flavors of caramel, dark fruits, and nutty grains which blend together in a great complex mix. The body is moderately light with moderate carbonation which allows the complexity to dance around the palate. The finish is sweet and warming as it slowly fades to gentle end."
"Overall an amazing beer that deserves an awesome score. Non hyped, just tasty goodness in a glass"
"Earthy with big caramel and grapes notes. Dark beer with yeast suspension. Rochefort is one of the best trappist beer on earth. You got too drink it slownly, like a heavy wine. Perfect in wintertime it will warm your entire body. More than a beer, an experience you're not ready to forget."
"Decided to splurge today at Armsby Abbey and get one of the beers on the cellar list, which is a 2006 bottle of this beer. I have had this before but not aged. Poured into the Rochefort goblet, very proper. Poured dark brown with plenty of expected sediment, nice off-white head sticks around pretty well. Smell is huge on this one, excellent and strong. A really great raisin/booze scent. Tastes include raisin, figs, rich chocolate truffle, brown sugar, spice, booze, plum. Maybe the most noticeable thing about the aged bottle compared to a new one is the mouthfeel, much creamier and less harsh on the alcohol. The alcohol taste that is there is very warm and comforting on the stomach. A truly great beer to sip and savor but it's hard to because it tastes so great. The last few sips are full of yeast. At the bar I paired it with some excellent yogurt with cranberries, granola and nuts and while enjoying them they played ""Black Out"" by Pavement and I was pretty much in heaven."
"My new favorite beer! That says it all. The only downside to this beer is that I don't know how to pronounce it. It pours very dark and is more carbonated than the beers that I usually like (DIPA). It smells and tastes of chocolate and warms you right up inside. The beer only gets better as you drink it and as it warms. I found myself disappointed that I had only bought one bottle. Anyone who is getting their ""good beer"" career started should definitely pick this one up, it does not disappoint. If you've never had a quad, I would probably recommend not starting with this, because I'm not sure it gets much better. Cheers!"
"Pours a nearly opaque dark walnut with almost a finger of ecru head that leaves a minimal amount of lacing behind. The smell is delightfully sweet, with notes of figs, chocolate, plums, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and wheat coming through and blending nicely. The taste follows, with the molasses, figs, vanilla, and brown sugar coming through strongest. At the surprisingly (but not overly) dry finish a final sugary sweetness pries its way forward, a fitting end. The body is medium, bordering on heavy, moves fizzily smoothly over the tongue, and does not sloggingly cover the mouth, allowing this brew to be highly sippable and enjoyable."
"D - Tastes so good it's easy to drink, and the carbonation helps, but the warmness in my stomach from the alcohol lets me know this isn't one I'm going to be knocking back all night. I will however, drink it enough to the point where I""m nicely drunk, just not sessionable."
"I live in the U.S.A. and cut my teeth on mass produced beer. I didn't and maybe still don't get all the craft beer hype. But, I just finished one of your 10's and went on line to read some reviews others have posted. Maybe I'm thick but I can't see how they get so much wordage out of a beer, Christ knows it's beer you like or you don't. I liked this one a lot, in fact it's the first one of the 6 or 8 craft beers I have ever tried that I didn't think afterwords why'd I pay a much higher price for that. I know what I like without over thinking it and your beer was very good no Great! You should all be proud that your created a taste of what I envision heaven is here on earth."
"This is perhaps the most drinkable Belgian I've had, I really would love to punish several bottles of this in a sitting, but there are two problems. The high ABV, and the fact that I only have one bottle. Still, this is now my favorite Belgian and one of the best beers I think I've ever had; I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to try a beer of this one's merit so early along in my beer-drinking career."
"Notes: Incredible beer that I must make sure I don't blow all my money on. Will seek out, and must set a spending limit with this one."
"d - Overall I thought this was a great Quad. Considering it is 11.3% ABV, you really can't tell. I really enjoyed the sweet fruit/malt smell and taste and though it was much better than the Rochefort 8. Will definitely be trying again."
"Pours a very dark ruby that's mostly black until held to the light. A light layer of bubbles caps the glass. Nose is vanilla, rum, date, grape, and a hint of licorice. Tasting begins with bubbly dates finishing with vanilla, clove, anise, and a bit of licorice."
"A pleasure to drink. I wish I could afford to buy a case for aging."
"Edit: Drinkability changed to Overall"
"Drinkablility this is a wonderfull beer. it is very high ACL around 11.3%. i feel like i could have a bunch of these in a row."
"Mouthfeel - Creamy, dry, medium/full body with lots of carbonation."
"Notes: I really enjoy this beer, well balanced and pretty complex. Really wonderful to sip on during a winter night."
"Pours a hazy brown with a decent sized tan head, very viscous.... Aroma is dominated by cherries and dark fruits, subtly sweet, with a booziness to the aroma... Flavors are quite complex, subtly hoppy, with notes of dark fruits and sweet malts coming through differently each sip... Very carbonated, with a dry finish, medium bodied...I'm becoming more of fan of this style and would definitely try it again."
"D - this is an excellent brew. Very rich and complex throughout. The high abv makes it hard to have more than one."
"-Bye"
"Full body and medium sweetness, but it's not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thick or creamy side. An overall smooth and tasty beer, especially considering the high ABV on this one."
"(FWIW - I did a side-by side with St. Bernardus Abt 12 for fun when I had this beer. In my opinion, they're rather close, and it's hard to pick a fav. I'll go with Rochefort by a clean margin, with the caveat that one who likes more fruit in their beer will lean towards the St. Bernardus. As a wine drinker [mainly] I'm very attracted to the subtle and warm approach to the Rochefort. To each their own, though.)"
"Mouthfeel is luxiurous and smooth with very light belgian carbonation."
"I cant say enough about this beer, and what I do have to say has been covered in previous reviews. I have long sought this beer and have always found the shelf space for it empty when I find a spot that carries it. I finally got a bottle...it totally lives up to the hype."
"I decided this year, as my new years resolution, to stop drinking a lot of lousy beer and to try as many different beers as I could possibly find. In 41 Days I have had the chance to try 161 different beers. My favorite up until today was Aventinus wheat dopplebock, however, This Beer gives it a run for it's money. This is the beer you would drink if you just won the Nobel Peace Prize. My crystal snifter barely did it justice. I would love to be able to describe the flavors in detail but you really need to just drink this one yourself. It is outstanding."
"M/D: Smooth and creamy - like the perfect milkshake, or...beer. Very strong, and one will certainly be enough - and this was perfectly paired with a good cheese plate."
"D: A supreme beer. Just as good if not better than the Westy 8. Truly an epic beer. My personal favorite as of right now..."
"This beer was a wonderful experience and if you never had it, you should put it on your to do list."
"Drinkability: while quadrupels are tasty, I typically would not call them eminently drinkable because of their strong flavors and high ABVs. Rochefort 10, however, gets exceedingly high marks because it provides a great flavor profile without being over-taxing on the palate. Cheers!"
"really enjoyed this beer. not sure I did it justice in my description due to its complexity. one of the best!"
"D-definately a sipper but one that is very rewarding it has an amazingly complex taste that os very enjoyable definately not a session beer due to its availability and high abv but an awesome beer none the less"
"Rochefort 12 bought back in 1992. The Monks at Abbaye Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy have created a tawny complex ale that rivals any beer. The port-like body bulges with flavor as I took my first sip. As I finished the bottle, the chocolate and fig notes began to coat my palate."
"Overall - amazing beer - best out of the 3 quads I just tasted."
"Cheers."
"I am always torn whether I prefer the Dubbel or the Quad. Drinking this will make me prefer the Quad all the time. This is an exceptional beer. There is a reason why you will never find a better Belgian outside of Belgium."
"D: A wonderful sipper. Paired with some dark chocolate, a perfect dessert :-)"
"The drink is silky-smooth and a bit too lightly carbonated, but sports a rich medium-fullish body that coats the palate with lingering slippery efficiency. This tasty treat is quite an excellent sipper for a cool winter evening."
"D- A wonderful beer to sip!"
"I really enjoyed everything about this ale, the aromas, flavors, the creamy mouthfeel, and the warming alcohol finish."
"D - Very nicely balanced quad...extremely drinkable and delicious."
"D- A great beer for sure. A perfect example of a quad, although once it warmed up i did not enjoy it as much because the alcohol was that much more noticeable. As a side note, I used some of this bottle to replace the cognac in a steak au poivre sauce as well... a great pairing for sure."
"D- This is an excellant beer to be sure. Paired really well with the lamb too. While I couldn't drink too many of these...it is a real treat."
"A most enjoyable brew."
"D: I'll definitely have another. Not tonight though - a perfect nightcap. Now I'm going to smoke my pipe. Life is grand."
"Poured into standard pint glass. This beer is very carbonated! Got about a full inch of head with a normal pour. The smell is spices, dark fruit, and some sugary sweetness. Very inviting. The taste is amazing! very complex and smooth. Hard to describe all the tastes going on here, but I get many of the flavors in the smell, and others I can't identify. I am somehow reminded of cotton candy while drinking this, which is strange for a beer and doesn't sound good, but trust me it is. Mouthfeel is good, lots of carbonation, you will notice a bit of solid residue on your tongue once in a while. Drinkability is fine, definitely some alcohol taste going on though."
"Completely lives up to the hype, much better than ABT 12 and deserves all accolades. What a beer!"
"D: Easily the most drinkable beer over 10% I've ever had. This beer is no sipper and can be drank with relative ease."
"Overall/notes: Monks rule. I don't even know if I have anything else to say. Anyone who can brew a beer like this deserves a hug... or at least a high-five. That's only if the hug isn't desired, though. I've seen the top of the beer, and it is Trappistes Rochefort 10, you beautiful brew, you."
"Pours a darker brown with a touch of haze, perfect head, great retention and lacing. Smell is a wonderful, perfumey blend of belgian yeasts, banana, clove, plum, wine grapes, slightly earthy. Taste melds all the components of scent into a dangerously silky smooth and complex concoction with well hidden ABVs. A great beer. I was expecting a big, bold and boozy bomb, but all i got was complexity, smoothness and pure joy."
"Side Notes: This is one of my all time favorite beers, its always a pleasure to drink one of these."
"Classic for a reason. They've had years to develop their recipe/technique and it shows. Mouthfeel/carbonation is delightful, allowing the richer qualities not to overwhelm the palate. The spice notes from the yeast do their part in balancing. even in this two year old bottle of beer."
"Perfect beer. One of my favorites."
"I think this and even the pannepot to be the best in this style, that to rank 1 above the other is just silly imho."
"drinkability: overall, very solid"
"D - for me, sipping brew, good for colder days and nights. One is just right."
"What can I say? I probably shouldn't review the 8 and 10 back to back but I believe that the 10 is even better than the 8, despite a slight deviation in style. It's even more deceptively drinkable and proof that the monks know what they're doing. Pick it up!"
"Overall a great beer. So many flavors for the pallet to discover. A rich and enjoyable dessert beer."
"Pours medium brown with a beige head. Aroma is some alcohol with dark fruit. Also get some brown sugar. Flavor is alcohol, dark fruit and some brown sugar. An outstanding quadrupel and one that I will seek out again."
"The color is almost black, foam the beer tasted chocolate. The nose, the flavor is recalled, and berries. In the mouth, body, heady, sweet as strongly for the Rochefort 8, but it feels even more the presence of fruit soaked in alcohol and at times one begins to think of a port. Some notes accompanying fruity flavor. The finish is long but a slight lack of balance in relation to the Rochefort 8 is noteworthy. Beer complex."
"D – Too expensive to justify the cost / benefit ratio. But it drinks well."
"D: Drinkability and smoothness are off the charts for a beer with such a high ABV that is so young. The malt complexities in the aroma and flavor are staggering, and it is a complete brew in that yeast, hops, and malt all get their day."
"I truly believe that while this is a fantastic beer, there is just a line crossed of too much alcohol presence and not enough hiding. And to drink this is a task. Not a chore, but a task."
"I think I may have hurt myself, this one is really making me think. Unlike the Rochefort 8 that just had me saying, ""wow," this one is great, but in a different way. I think the extra abv may mask some of the flavors you'd find in the 8 or in other BSDA's. The alcohol is a bit more present in this brew, but it's still a deceptively easy beer to drink. It's velvety smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. It's a bread like, malty beer. A bit medicinal due to the high abv, but that imparts a slight, very very slight smokiness. Some fruity esters, produces a bit of a grape flavor."
"Aroma is crisp, strong, fruity and malty with just a whisper of sweetness. It pours a hazy, barely translucent, dark coppery brown with a very thick and pale tan head. Flavor is malty and fruity with a hint of caramel and a fierce but not overwhelming alcohol bite. Texture is very smooth, yet quite fizzy and tingly, leaving a satisfying and lip-smacking finish with fruity and caramel hints as well as a touch of sweetness."
"D-at 11.3% it's a strong beer and it's expensive; for me it's a once-in-awhile type beer usually saved for special occasions and with its alcohol content, one in a night is enough for me"
"Had this one and the 8..The main difference is the taste of the alcohol content. The 10 being a little stronger than the 8.Still a very drinkable high quality Trappist brew I highly recommend picking these up if you can find them sweet,malts,spice,creaminess it's all here a true pleasure for sure!"
"Flavors are dominated by milk chocolate with roasted almonds sweetened with caramelized sugar. Fully ripened dates adding more sweetness are the solitary representatives of the heavenly orchard.Faint bread crust bitterness and moderate alcohol warmth balance the chocolaty-sweet aspects of the beer completing the circle. Besides all the sweetness and warmth a ponderous Earth element reigns: Something rotten, woody, musty and old as Earth is lurking beneath to grab the lonely wanderer. This beer holds a dark secret. Rochefort 10 is a complex brew yet so obviously based on simple recipe - not surprisingly as the best things in our lifes are the simplest ones.Richer and musty as Rochefort 6, similar to but stronger (and less carbonated) in every aspect than R8, which, although good, is like R10 diluted with water. It's not nearly as fruity as St. Bernardus Abt.12 and lacks the aristocratic silkiness of Westwleteren which hides the alcohol better and is more refined. Thick malty body is lightly crispy and even so velvety smooth and creamy as it goes down. Apart from mostly unobtrusive alcohol presence the beer is highly enjoyable and very drinkable for such a sheer ale. The monster is still young and somewhat unhewn in terms of mouthfeel and drinkability but who knows what might evolve to taking some nap in the cellar."
"Poured form bottle to chalice the color of roasted chestnut with a two finger head, that stayed around as a nice lacing on my glass. with a shimmer form the carbonation. The aroma was of fig, spices and other earthy tones. the tastes was of dark fruit and earth lots of booze a sipper not a session beer. the carbonation was prickly, Rochefort uses and incredible yeast strain, that make all there beers world class. This might be the best beer I have ever had in my life."
"All in all, this is a nice brew. Glad I picked one up. This is a good brew if you're looking for something not as heavy as a stout, but not as light as a standard ale or sweet like a barleywine. This is a thinking beer, if you're looking for a good one to savor and figure out as you sip it."
"Beer is big bodied, no aftertaste at all. There are no hops to detect and bitterness overall is really mild. There is a tinge of alcohol and solvency in the front of the beer and that really disappoints me. Beer gets better and solvency is lessened as the beer warms slightly. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkabiliy is good. I can see how people like this beer but it has not been my favorite Quad."
"This is a complex beer that gets better and better as it warms!"
"Poured a deep amberish, brown muddy color with excellent carbonation and a dirty white head, a big one. Nose is booze, spice, dates, figs, raisins and other fruits. Taste is grapes, alcohol, raisins, figs, spice, slight belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is warming, grape, dried fruits, spice. Drinkability is very good. Not a beer you can drink alot of but I would if I could. For the style, yes, one of my top picks to drink."
"33cl bottle $7.19, I have been meaning to try this for a while. Turbid brown despite my attempt to keep the yeast out, almost black, flimsy head. It smells like vinegar and pickles at first but as it warms up it becomes sweet candied spices. the flavor has a quad-like sweetness but it also has a strong black licorice quality to it. The alcohol is not blatant but I know it is there because I can feel it. Overall I liked Rochefort 8 more."
"Just a fantastic beer experience."
"Notes-Wow, I adore this beer; it's everything I liked about the #6 and the #8 but combined!, this is my first true Belgian quad and I could not reccomend it more!, and now that's I've tried the Rochefort #10 I can't wait to get my hands on St. Bernardus Abt #12 and Westvleteren #12"
"Overall, this beer really does deserve all the hype it gets. It probably is actually a little underrated since it is so widely available."
"Daniel"
"if you can age this beer do it - a have a few more at this age and hope to hold on to one for atleast 10 years"
"One of the better darker trappists that can be found in Iowa."
"O: Excellent drinkability. The definition of perfect beer for me"
"D: A top-notch quad. It's massively flavorful and complex. Definitely a contemplative brew one should savor. Despite all that, it's still relatively easy to drink for a quad, as the carbonation level is ideal and the alcohol doesn't interfere with the flavor."
"D- Definate sipper, you want to enjoy this beer as it warms/opens up. As it opens you notice that the flavors and smells become much more intense. The high carbonation hinders this beer but after cellaring I'm positive this will be an awesome beer."
"D - The smell is constantly a bit off-putting through the beer and in regards to the flavor, I will say, ""complexity does not a good beer make"". With that said, I also think it's very well brewed but the flavors seem to clash just a bit to me. In the beginning they didn't fit at all but they grew on me throughout the rest of the beer. Still though, I've had more enjoyable quads but this one certainly is a beer to behold. Very, very good overall."
"(D)- A fantastic quad that defines the style. For me, it is the finest belgian I have ever had to date. Gorgeous fruits, body, feel, and balance. Definitely one of the most complex beers as well. The only thing holding me back from giving this perfect 5's is that after one of these kinda makes you feel full, not to mention the alcohol sneaks up on you too. Simply delicious stuff though."
"This is as drinkable as I would imagine an 11%+ beer to get. I could get in trouble quick with this one if my wallet would allow it. A beautiful beer that sets the tone for all Quads to measure up to."
"D-Pretty hot. If you had a year or two to sit this thing down it would have gotten a higher scorebut overall, great beer."
"Medium bodied and only lightly carbonated. The only low point for me was that the taste seemed just a little underwhelming, but that was only because the aroma was simply amazing...I obviously raised my expectations a little too high after that so I can't really complain. A great sipper for sure and I'll be interested to try this one with a little age on it."
"Overall, honestly I am disappointed. I read a thread recently that talked about how great this beer was. I then checked its spot on the top 100 and it was in the low 20s I believe. I would say it belongs at about that spot. To me this beer lacks complexity and depth compared to St. Bernardus Abt 12. However, this is a must try for all lovers of the style."
"One of my favorite beers of all time."
"D: There are no overpowering flavors, which lets this beer drink pretty easily. It should, however, be savored, both to experience the flavors and due to the ABV."
"O: Great beer that gets better as it approaches room temperature. I would have given it a better score if the -OH was more hidden. The 11.3% abv. makes this completely understandable."
"D- This is a great sipper. Its really warming and full."
"D-very tasty, makes me want to sip and i do, slowly (normally i'm a fast drinker). thick full bodied beer with a nice warming effect and great flavor"
"D - A really great experience that makes you want to drink more and more of it."
"Notes: A seriously tasty quad. Didn't expect the cherry flavors, but they are appreciated (yes, I know there's none added)."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter, this beer has a nice big, creamy head. It is a murky brown and when held to the light the edges reveal some particles, but of what I'm not sure. There is a lasting ring around the glass and some nice lacing. The smell is great- rich and chocolately with some dark fruit; kind of like a deeper, richer doppelbock. This is one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. The taste is also chocolate with a slight bit of alcohol in the background. Although it doesn't burn for the amount of alcohol in the beer, I can feel it warming my stomach. Nice. As it warms I get a hint of skunk flavor. I'm not sure how long this has been on the shelf but it could be a bit light-struck. Mouthfeel is smooth on the tongue but carbonation is a little harsh as it goes down my throat. Drinkability would be pretty good on this except for the price and amount of alcohol. I would look forward to having this again."
"D: WWWAAAAYYYY to easy to drink. This beer is delicious. There is no taste of alcohol. No heat from alcohol. If I didnt know better I could easily get myself into trouble with this beer, it goes down very easy."
"D- This crowning jewel of the Trappist beers is surprisingly drinkable, despite the high ABV. Just lovely!"
"Overall, this is a complex and intriguing brew with rich aromas and flavors. Alot smoother than expected with the high ABV."
"D: I could probably drink a six pack of these on a cold winter night out on the deck with the dogs, or by the fire, and be the happiest person in the world. A very well made beer."
"Dark candi sugar slides into a robust, warming caramel and chocolate cake finish. Subtle boozy kiss. Less fruity and more dessert like than many quads of my fancy."
"Much less dark fruit and body than both the Cuvee Van De Kaiser and St. Bernardus 12. Interesting vanilla notes."
"D. For how strong it is and how blatantly the alcohol presents itself, it is very drinkable. I finished one in about ten minutes and could easily have had a couple more. Excellent beer. Maybe the best quad that I have tried, which isn't very many."
"D - Not high. Have only one and sip it. allow it to warm."
"the finish for this dreamboat is that of a full heavy bodied belgian ale with a boozy sweetness that holds onto the tongue after the beer is gone. this is an absolutely amazing example of what great trappist beer can and should be and i will be drinking these periodicaly for years to come."
"D - This is one of the best Quads that I've had so far I think this will be my new baseline beer for Quads either way this is a must try beer this is a good reason to get into trading"
"Man, what a beer! I can see why this one is so highly regarded. Very tasty. The strength makes it hard to drink a lot but the pleasure makes it easy to want to try your luck."
"Overall a really good beer that may be a bit more complex than the ABT 12, however the larger alcohol presence and the sweeter finish makes it less enjoyable for me. I have another one that I will age to see if that helps the alcohol a bit, but still this is a great quad that is classic."
"Dark brown color with medium tan head. Aroma of malt, nuts and some berries. Full. smooth, flavor with enormous complexity. Grows even more complex and full-flavored with 3-5 years of consistent storage. Approaches Westvleteren 12 in terms of flavor and complexity. A true classic."
"Overall, this is a very, very tasty and complex brew. Hella-well-balanced and the tastes and smells are masterfully blended together. Call me crazy, though, but I think I prefer the 8. Regardless, I wouldn't complain if I had to choose, this is a great beer."
"Drinkability: This went down very smooth, especially for a quad. I did not notice the alcohol in the aroma nor taste. I did notice it in my head a little later."
"Pours a deep, dark murky brown with lots of yeasty floaties and a nice beige head. aroma of alcohol, raisins, plums, pears, prunes, and the list goes on. tastes mostly like the smell minus the alcohol is well hidden until the somewhat burn of a swallow. notes of vanilla, flavored malts, and figs also. wonderfully balanced and super smooth. lives up to the hype for sure!!"
"I have to be honest when i say that this one is (almost or even?)better than the Westvleteren 12. It's darker, gives more foam in the glass and for a longer time. The 'aftertaste'is superb. Like i have already said before; i like the blond beers better but this one is really really really super and it's very easy to get in Holland and Belgium. If you seek for the best beer? This is the one amongst others."
"Drinkability - Think of it as a foretaste of heaven. Complex - and all the flavors are wonderfully blended together. The words ""delicious, awesome and stunning "" seem to fall short of how to describe this brew - Heavenly!"
"This brew rebounds in flavor yet is a bit nondescript. Lots of cherry and chocolate are evident on the tongue, yet the complexities are thin. This beer looks good but doesn't excite. A bit too sweet in the end, I think there is a coverup of sorts going on. I'll stick to St. Bernardus 12 in the future. Nonetheless, sickly drinkable for its strength and a revisit with another batch shows much more complexity in the aroma and a nice feel. Updated fresh in Brussels. All bets are off as this may be the best Quad out there."
"D : With 11% ABV so well hidden, keep the third out of reach"
"D Definitely a one at a time beer for me. I am almost done with the glass as I review this and I feel the effects of the 11.30%. (This is my first review but not my first Rochefort 10)"
"Taste improved as it warms up too. I usually start mine fridge temp...pour, wait about a minute or 2...and slowly enjoy it! Definately a need to try."
"I'm loving this beer, so much going on here I feel humbled by this one, I just don't think I'm getting the whole picture here. I can only wonder what this would be like after a decade in a cellar, as hard as I would try I just don't think I could avoid drinking it for that long"
"Drinkability is good, but not great due to the ABV. Overall a great beer."
"As far as quadrupels go, this is undoubtedly top notch, taking first place in my little tasting. If they only sold this at the monastery it would be #1 on every beer website. The very solid A it has, however, is very fair indeed."
"All in all, very drinkable if you can handle the complexity and alcohol."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"A nice dark brown with some sediment and about a finger of khaki head. Smells of dark fruits, some brown sugar, and alcohol. Taste is warming and malty. Some plums. A good sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Smooth, full body. Nice and drinkable for the amount of alcohol. My first trappist beer, and all in all, I wasn't terribly impressed. It was good, don't get me wrong, but not as good as I thought it was going to be."
"Drinkability: The ABV keeps pretty much anyone from having more than 3 without getting wasted. Its like a bong hit in a bottle."
"Overall, a very good beer that everyone should try and try repeated times. A smooth easy drinking example of the style."
"D: So smooth and goes down really easy. I cannot believe how well the alcohol is covered. I love the warm feeling it leaves in my chest. This has the characteristics of a sipper, but I could definitely drink more than one (and pay for it in the morning!)."
"Else DRINKABLE!!!!"
"This is my favourite beer of all time. Bottle aged to at least 7 months preferably. I just love the fruity esters and earthy qualities of this beer. Dangerously drinkable! I make it my aim to have some in stock all year round, along with the equally delicious Rochefort 8."
"Overall, this Rochefort 10, the crown of the Rochefort line, represents the essence of Trappist brewing. But then all 7 Trappist breweries really hit the nail on the head. Rochefort has been doing it right for over 400 years The Rochefort brewery opened in 1595 and is the oldest Trappist brewery by 250 years). Apparently practice makes perfect."
"d-I am really enjoying this brew. I've had this a few times but this is the oldest bottle at one year. could definitely have more than one"
"D- Considering the heartiness and strength of this beer, it is very easy to drink in small quanities. I love cool weather, it makes beers like this really shine."
"Superbly drinkable for a brew this size. Very complex and engaging, makes for a nice combination in most any situation. Top notch."
"M&D - decent Carbonation that tickles the throat, smooth but lighter bodied than I expected. Even with it's strength I could easily drink more than one and feel great about it."
"Rich, warm, complex. Sublime."
"- This is a top-notch ale that is to be reckoned with! Very smooth, hardly strong, and very fine. Something to be had with a fine red meat, and lots of veggies. I am impressed, and have never had anything like it ever in the U.S. Worth the buy over and over!"
"D. Delicious and dangerous, but so big and complex I dont think I could drink a bunch"
"D: Enjoyable. Not my favorite style but the balance is very appreciated."
"Procured at Beverages & More, Valencia, CA"
"Mouth feel is full-bodied and coats the tongue. It is balanced with a very mild prickliness that gives the beer a great feel and drinkability, especially for 11.3% abv. Overall, another quality trappist ale. I am a fan."
"Though the styles are basically the same, the 10 is superior to the 8 in my opinion. Tons of sweet spice and a combination of green and ripe fruits are abundant. There is so much going on here. Only a slightly hot alcohol bite keeps me from rating this one higher. I've never had St. Berny 12 or Westy 12, but I am a big Chimay Blue fan and I think this one trumps it."
"D: When I want a quad, I will reach for this. Or at least I would if it were available in Texas...dammit."
"Pairing: asiago cheese, all wheat bread,roasted bell pepper. dry cured meats..."
"Bottle. Poured rather fizzy with a lot of carbonation and a lot of head. Dark brown in color with lots of sediment and flakes floating around. Smell was bold fruitiness with a noticeable alcohol presence. Taste was dark fruits, plums, malts, and a little bit of butterscotch taste as it warmed up. A little hard to drink at first due to all the carbonation, wasn't very pleasant at first until it settled down. Noticeable alcohol heat when drinking. Overall pretty good though."
"D-Not bad at all, but to be honest, I prefer the 8 over the 10. I can't see myself having more than one of these."
"D-Pretty decent brew. I could see the beer's drinkability decreasing as the alcohol became more apparent, likely the result of the beer warming, to the point it became harsh, no longer smooth. I think this detracted from this brew overall."
"D- 11.3%? I won't have 2, c'mon. But it is delicious, and I will be looking forward to buying more."
"This is a drinkable beer that should be drunk slowly given the high ABV that is covered up so well. Nice balance in the flavor."
"Cheers!"
"While great on its own, this ale really comes alive when served with a good cheese (anything from aged Mimolette, to an oozing Taleggio) or roast poultry (e.g. game hen). A revelation the first time I tried it, this ale catalyzed my search for ever-more intense flavors and craftsmanship in the beer universe. While I no longer find it to be mind-blowing, there is nothing disappointing about this ale - it remains one of the most mature (if not sacred) examples of the style and of the potential of beer in general."
"Overall- A definite nuance beer. I could (and would love to) spend many many nights trying to unravel it."
"Pours a deep hazy brown with a thick, frothy off-white head. Heavy smells of fruit, banana, and brown sugar, and molasses. Light scent of hops. Moderately yeasty. Creamy and softly carbonated mouth feel. A bit oily at first. Deliciously sweet flavors of fruit, molasses, malts with a nice balance of hops. Warming and earthy, hides it's high alcohol quite well. Coats the mouth in a nice flavor that lasts. Definitely lives up to it's reputation."
"Overall, a world-class beer and one that I would put head-to-head with any wine in the world as a complex, sophisticated drink, to pair with a fine cheese or meal."
"Pours dark brown with an inch of white head. Smells and tastes like spicy fruitcake, apples, grapes, and candi sugar. Body is medium with finely granulated carbonation. Highly drinkable beer that conceals its high ABV quite well. This is my first time drinking a Rochefort 10 Didn't realize I had such a tasty Belgian brew so easily accessible."
"D - Pretty high, although it gets to be a bit much relative to Westy 12, which I can down like water."
"This beer takes a long time to drink because it just isn't good. It's no good and I don't recommend it....and I NEVER thought I'd say that about a trappist beer! But there you go. And I deeply and sincerely mean it. Go buy the 8 instead if you like trappists, it's MUCH better!"
"Superb."
"D: This one is just not for me, and I have a hard time imagining other people drinking it. I think I need to go on a Belgian vacation for a while."
"Drinkability: I really love this stuff. However, the alcohol is quite present in a way that is (almost) off putting. There are other readily available Belgian quads (St B) that hide the alcohol for less than or equal to the price of this. In this style category, I demand perfection, and while I think this is excellent, its not perfect."
"Been waiting for a day of significance to drink the last remaining in my stock, but I guess the end of the summer vacation shall suffice. Pours very dark, the darkest of browns that can still fall into the category. The head is light tan with swirls of brown in it. Some sediment finds its way to the top after a while and forms a gang. Lacing is modest but available. Smell is complex, maybe too complex for my preception at this point, but I'm getting a lot of dried fruit, rum-like quality, pepper, and the booze is lined up in there. The taste is excellent and develops as the temperature climbs. Plums, raisins, and figs with an alcoholic kick in the ass soon after swallowing. The mouth is very creamy yet still retains more of a medium body. The carbonation was a bit much right after pouring, but subsided and is now actually a bit lacking as I have whittled it down to a few sips left. This is nearly irrelevant as the creaminess and sustain of the feel are wonderful. It be exciting to see how this beer turns out if you wait the recommended five years or so they suggest. All in all this is a complex, hearty beer that drinks quite well considering the high ABV. I'll be returning to this one in the future with more perspective and knowledge on the style."
"Glad I finally got around to trying this."
"D: A fantastic sipping beer... the alcohol content luckily keeps it from being TOO drinkable, but it's an excellent beer to sit back with and let the flavors come out even more as it warms."
"D: Excellent. So smooth that I could drink several. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Notes: Tremendous beer. This is one of those show-offs that can withstand all the reputation of a style. One may need to be into beers of this complexity, sweetness, and alcoholic content, meaning that it may be tough to offer it out of the blue to untested palates. But I'd be glad to try it, share it, and keep on enjoying it."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer for this novice. I highly recommend it. It's a very complex beer that'll have you wondering how they can pack so many different flavors into one beer, yet balance it so well. Heaven in a bottle!"
"Absolute sipper. Pretty big ABV and it's tasted. Does it live up to the hype? I would say probably yes. I need to have it again to say that. Right now I can think of another quad I would have over this. Outstanding beer none the less."
"Im sure if you are someone who enjoy quad beers than this would be good but just not for me."
"330ml brown bottle obtained at Whole Foods in Portland, ME. pours a murky dark brown color with a quarter inch of light tan head. scents of fruity, citrusy tinge, and the slightest hint of chocolate graces the nose. tastes of peaches, chocolate, citrus (orange maybe?). moderately carbonated. one of the best quads out there."
"Im glad I got two, of them even if they were 6$ each. I will definitely be getting this again whenever I can find it. It was worth the wait and the 45 minute drive to get one."
"Bottle pours a very dark brown with very little light passing through. Has a thin tan head. Aroma is a complex array of dark fruits. Mostly prune and plum. Mouthfeel is thin bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Flavor is very complex. Has dark fruit flavors, alchohol, dark chocolate caramel, spiciness, cola like features, and is very fruity on the finish. Overall this is a great beer. The only way to balance it more would be to have less alcohol strength or a little more balance between the dark fruit flavors and dark malt sweetness. Still a solid beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy deep amber-brown. A two finger of nice frothy heads sits on top with excellent head retention. Thick sheets, sometimes streaky, of lacing coat the side of the glass the entire way down. A bit of sediment is noticeable in the head. Nose is of dark fruits - some raising and plums, spices, sugar and a touch boozy. Taste is of dark fruits up front, like they were soaked in alcohol. Raisins, plums, and cherries dominate. Caramel and toffee malts with a touch of sugar. Finish is a bit nutty with some spice to it. Alcohol is present, warms you, but doesn't overpower. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, nice thick and smooth, alcohol warms but the beer is so tasty you have to watch out. This is a great beer!"
"For my first quad, this is quite nice and enjoyable. A definite benchmark for other quadrupels."
"D - There is little wonder why this beer is held in such high esteem. It is one of those beers that has to be experienced. Openly powerful in the alcohol but brilliantly balanced with strong rich flavours. I have three more of these that I am cellaring, and i'm finding it very hard not to drink them!"
"D: Good for one glass wich is probably what the brewers intended. Couoldn't imagine drinking a few in one night."
"What an amazing brew. The first I chose to review here on BA as well as on my own little review show I put together. Pours a great, dark creamy color with little lacing. Not very high on carbonation, which makes sense with the high abv, 11.3%. Lots of yeast floating around which is a beautiful thing. The taste is so nice yet, for a beer this strong, surprisingly mellow. Lots of dark sugars and sweetness, yet all of which is mellow. The smell was nice as well, but it did not have quite as much of a smell as you would think. Overall, a great brew, A+."
"Intensely dark with only a slight red tinge on the edges. Creamy off wite head. Dark chocolate, liqorice, molasses and some fig aromas. Hop aromas are kind of muted. A touch more restrained than I expected but still insanely good. Comes together in perfect balance on the palate. Alcohol is warming, some medicinal flavours there too. Chocolate and fig vibes in harmony with the serious bitterness. Low carbonation helps the divine creaminess of this beer. Truly awesome. One to savour."
"This been is amazing. I haven't had a Westy 12 in about 3 years, but i hardly see how it could be better than this."
"A dark muddy brown color body with two fingers of fluffy light tan lasting head , loads of sheeting and lacing , lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. Aroma of dark fruit ,grapes and berries , earthy hops,toffee and caramel ,and wood. Flavor is sweet ,and spicy , lots of earthy roasted malt hops and bread dough ,rasins ,plums and apples . very complex and well rounded . Full body with a creamy yet lite mouthfeel , mildly bitter and dry at the finish . Very drinkable and good is all areas . Nice"
"Overall, possibly better than the TW12, which is saying a lot."
"I tried to drink this a bit too cold when I started and I realized pretty quickly I had to let it warm a bit to bring out the full flavor (be warned)."
"Pours a deep brown with burgandy hints, a huge amount of initial head, some nice lacing, and a glop of sediment into the middle of the foam. Great scent, a huge hit of fig with an earthy brown ale scent; thick and rich with a huge maltiness. Excellent taste, as well; very barleywinish, with its deep and thick malt flavor, but with a nice slight sweetness and nice hints of fruit, especially fig. Goes down great, thick and great, without a hint of its high ABV. Great beer!"
"I would say this were much more drinkable if it weren't for the sharp alcohol bite. I enjoyed every aspect of it, just couldn't handle a ton."
"-need friends to drink this beer, but it is very good"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured deep brown with a 1 inch tan head. Carbonation is very noticeable right away. Smells of dark fruit, caramel, and spices. Tastes of heavy malt, dark fruit and spice, with a well perceived alcohol. Hops come through on the backend to balance out the brew. Mouthfeel is good and chewy. I thought drinkability was good, but not great. I prefer the St. Bernardus ABT 12 in that regard. The alcohol flavor is more pronounced in the Rochefort, which detracts from its otherwise wonderful flavors. It is definitely a sipping brew, and I would definitely have another given a chance. Goes great with a nice heavy meal."
"Poured into a goblet for a small tan head resting on top of a dark brown body. Caramelized malt and sugar on top of yeast and orange/dark fruits all hit my nose. Great smooth and creaminess tucked into a medium body. There is a sweetness to this beer from caramel and sugary candy flavors as well as a smoothness derived from something like oak/wood which is noticeable on back end. Balanced w/ fruit flavors like orange and some figs, there is a light herbal and spicy hop presence in the back which leads to a balanced beer with a little bit of a dry kick. The ABV complements the backend as well but by no means overpowers the beer whatsoever. This is a great beer to sip on, especially after a meal."
"The heavy carbonation pairs well with the thick malty body and equally high alcohol. I have one aging in the cellar can't wait to see what a couple of years do to this bad boy."
"D: though it's a sipper, I'd drink it before the alcohol rears its head. I'd love to try this with 2 years on it!"
"Notes: I much prefer this brew to the Westvleteren 12, and perhaps the best beer I have sampled to date. People say that the US makes the best beer, but try to touch the Belgian's ability to create this velvet mouthfeel and play with the yeasts like this. That alone is proof that the Belgian's still have some things on lock."
"Jordan."
"A booming Quad, fantastic, complex, deep and enjoyable. Highly recommended. Would love to drink this on a cool fall day, one after another."
"Drinkabilty & Notes: As good as I can imagine and better than I expected. I have yet to try Westy but this was the best I have ever had. 10 times better than Rochefort 8. Get all you can if you find it!!!"
"Late not: Apparently there were 2 sips left, this really a slow drinking beer."
"Personally: This is one of my personal cherished beers. I like to have a bottle every year to age for the next holiday season. Rochefort 10 is a testament to the excellence and taste supremacy of Belgian beers."
"It is often stated that this beer is equal or superior to Westy 12 but I don't agree with that one bit. In fact, I would go so far as to say it shouldn't be even be mentioned in the same sentence as St. Bernardus 12 or Pannepot. I'm not trying to trash it because it surely is a high quality beer, but it is not world class according to my palate."
"I will be honest as I have sat on these notes for 3 weeks now. I feel guilty for even writing this. So many good reviews and I just flat out was unhappy with this beer. ABV was too high for me I think. I will try the 8 and try this again. It may not be a beer that just suits me and that I get. I got too much alcohol and it was a total turn off to me."
"D: Wonderful beer. I'm not normally a big fan of Quads, but I am doing my best to try all of the Trappist ales, and this is one that has definitely lived up to the billing."
"Overall a great beer, I wish the trappistes rocheforts went up to 11, that would be cool."
"full-bodied and smooth on the palate with truly wonderful drinkability."
"A very enjoyable beer, the amount of alcohol and the complexity make it good for sipping."
"D: Very, but I am going to put a couple of bottles in the celler. They should probably develop even more complexity."
"Overall -- wow, this is one helluva good beer. If it wasn't so expensive and it wasn't quite so hard to find, I'd be drinking this a lot more often."
"A very malty, under-carbonated beer for the belgian style. I do like the alcohol taste in a quad which was apparent. The euro barley was also there along with the european hop addition. I did like the yeast sediment like a homebrew and which that more beers should show their background every once in a while. It just tasted like a double wiezenbock. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be."
"Mouthfeel is nicely full, definitely slightly burning towards the back but I just like it, and it leaves very cleanly with a nice, lightly bitter finish. Overall it's not overwhelmingly drinkable because of that alcomohol but enjoyable as a good scotch and nicely Belgian in complexity."
"A very, very pleasant and very, very drinkable beer, especially considering its ABV. Very slick, very complex, and amazingly enjoyable. Thankyou laituegonflable for slapping me in the face with this one!"
"Drinkability: After drinking this beer, I could tell that they sunk more money into the beer then the label artwork. It's clearly not a cheap beer, but if you ever want to try well hidden high ABV% beer, then you should try a Rochefort 10. For me, I would like to give this beer another try."
"Very bready, big thick mouthfeel. Really solid. An awesome big beer, the 11.3% is really well covered with all the malt and different flavors. One of the best quads I've ever had, the best of all 3 Rochefort beers."
"All in all, a lot more than the Rochefort 8. And I love the 8. This one steps everything I liked about the 8 up in a big way, while not overloading the tongue. What's amazing about this beer is how bold it is in mouthfeel, aroma, and character while providing a subduded sweetness. A true artisan beer and one I won't think twice about buying a boatload of."
"D: At 11% ABV, one is tough to finish. Certianlly a sipper. I am just getting into the Belgian's ( other than Wits) lately, and trying to learn about this style. So far, so good! I don't ever read reviews before reviewing, can't wait until I do to see what others have seen."
"Overall, one of the best quads out there! It is important though to let the beer warm up a bit, so all the flavours are fully released!"
"D - This was my first Trappist beer, and I must say I am very pleased. I highly recommend this to anyone who passes by it in the store, or sees it at the local pub. I could easily have 2-3 of these in one sitting."
"D - Too wonderful to guzzle, and it hits like a rock. But it's sooo easy to drink."
"10 pours a medium brown with a generous head that doesn't last long. I smell pears and alcohol. The flavor is of dark, ripe fruit and molasses; nice and sweet with no bitterness at all. There is a fair amount of carbonation, it is not a heavy feel beer. I could drink a few of these if I could afford it. This was my third trial of Rochefort 10 and while a liked it, I wanted to wait to make sure I wasn't missing something. I actually liked Bernardus 12 better, although I have a feeling, if I had the willpower to cellar this, it could be very special."
"Overall, a deliciious brew. Perfect digestive. Wonderful example of the style."
"Bottom line: the Rochefort 10 is a killer Quad, one I would love to enjoy again, one that is particularly appropriate for the most special of occasions."
"In all this sturm und drang, one is left to wonder - where went the heat? Like its little brother, the 8, you have to reflect somewhat in order to detect the alcohol beyond a slight general warming. Perceived drinkability will not equal actual end-game drinkability with this one, of that I am certain. Still, drink this, just because you damned well can."
"Pours a deep brown color with a thick tan head. Aroma of fruit, sweet candy, and alcohol. Flavor is raisiny, with alcohol, figs, plums, grapes, and other dark fruits. Yeast and more alcohol round this one out. Champagnish fizzyness, finishes dry but with a tart sweetness at the end of the finish. Good."
"D: A fantastic beer, a fantastic Trappist-beer. Of all the Trappist-beers I had I guess the only ones that can compete with this one is Westmalle Dubbel and Tripel. If you find this one in the store or pub - BUY IT!"
"4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"This is the best beer in the world."
"Pours a very dark brown with a medium whitish-tan head. Aroma is caramel and toffee with notes of apples and plums. Earthy. Taste has a dark sweetness- burnt, or perhaps very very dark, sugar/caramel. Background sweetness. Notes of raisins and prunes. Bitterness from the middle through the finish. Earthy and deep flavor throughout. Noticeable alcohol warmth and a dry finish. Long lasting pleasant aftertaste. Very very good. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Delicious, balanced, and complex. This is a quad and it's obviously a sipper but it's pretty drinkable- I could drink this all night. Excellent."
"This is very good beer. My first impression is ""very, very, good"" but the 8 was ""incredible"". I immediately followed the 10 by pouring another 8 and it confirmed my judgment. The 8 is a world class beer and the 10 is an excellent beer. Frankly, I wanted the 10 to be better than the 8, but it isn't. A very good beer truly, but the ABV gets in the way in the 10 that it does not in the 8. I have 5 more bottles that I will let age in my cellar and report on changes over time. In the near term I will try another 10 (the sixth in the cellar)that I will let warm a little first. Finally, a store in the area has the 8 for $3.29 a bottle I am going there and buying every last bottle they have. I will put the ""warmed"" 10 head-to-head with the St. Bernardus Abt 12 shortly (and include the 8 in the session) I'll revise my review if necessary."
"This si a very complex and thought provoking brew, nice to sip on and relax with a fine peaceful evening."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. I definately can't drink more than 1 of these without feeling the buzz. Another good beer I'll have to try again."
"I was really, really hoping for more from this beer as it rates so high from other consumers. I was fairly disappointed by the taste when the smell was so pleasing. I would get again but at almost $8 a pop, my money would go elsewhere first."
"Mouthfeel: Prickley carbonation and warming alcohol."
"I am so glad that I finally drank what can only be descibed as a ""nectar of the gods"". When I die and if there is a heaven and for some reason St. Peter opens the pearly gates for me, I can only hope that this beer is available. But if I have to head in the opposite direction for eternity, maybe the ruler of the underworld will have a few cellered that he would be willing to part with."
"Drinkability, considering style, is spectacular. I have finished the 11.2 ounces in the time it has taken to form this review."
"This beer pours dark brown in color with a three finger head and nice lacing. The smell is sweet with plums and raisins. Tastes of dark fruits and finishes with a spicy and hoppy flavor, similar to the taste that gingerbread leaves in your mouth.. I can taste many similarities to red wine. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth and is perfectly carbinated. Drinkability is limited only by the high abv. I wish I would of not started drinking this quite so cold this just keeps getting better. A must try."
"The guys at Rochefort really should let this one age for awhile before shipping it out, they are really shooting themselves in the foot by shipping it out so young. I read that this one goes from grain to bottle in 3 weeks! All the elements of a great beer are there but they are just so disseperate that it's a little like trying to piece together a puzzle."
"I have had this beer fairly frequently over the past 10 years but have never sat down to review it till now. I received a bottle as a gift and poured into my trappistes rochefort chalice. The color is a dark amber with about a half inch head, I pour the whole bottle so there is noticeable sediment. The smell is like Christmas morning, a sweet blend of clove, anise, dried fruit, and alcohol. The taste evolves with every sip, with a masterful blend of raisin, plum, clove, anise, among other spices, and a warming alcohol finish. It's truly one of the few beers that seem to evolve with each sip. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, a little on the chewy side. The high alcohol content is expertly masked by all the sweetness and complex flavors. There is just so much to say about this beer and yet words really fail to do it the proper justice it deserves. To me, the Rochefort 10 is the gold standard by which all beers are measured, yet none can live up to. Drink in good health, friends. Prost!"
"O: This beer has to be the best widely available Trappist Quad out there. It is simply amazing every time I come back to it."
"I have to admit, this is probably the most wine-like beer I have ever had. The alcohol astringency in the finish is probably the biggest deterrent for me. Other than that, this is probably one of the most complex beers around and is worth trying at least once. I personally found the Rochefort 8 a little more drinker friendly. Check em both out if you can. Recommended."
"If this is not the perfect beer, it is quite close. Typical quad brown, lighter around the edges, with light lacing head. Nose is dominated by roasted caramel, chocolate, and loads of yeasty fruitiness. Sweet taste with milky chocolate and slight nuttiness over that glorious caramel. Warming alcohol is evident but adds to balance. If not for the inherent weight of the beer, I could drink this thing all night. My favorite beer? A good possibility."
"If you can find it, buy it and set it aside for a special occasion."
"Clean and sharp carbonation, with a medium body."
"D- is good but there is a boozy presence that takes away from it"
"The drink is as easy as any brew of this magnitude. Very nice. Well played sirs."
"One of my all-time favorites."
"D: I could drink a few of these. The alcohol is hidden so very well. A real pleasure to taste. However, I prefer the St. Bernardus Abt 12 to this one. It just seems a bit more chewy with more of a dark fruit and spice that I prefer. Overall this is still a world class Quad."
"D - Easy to drink but probably just once in a while for me. I prefer the Westy 12 to this one, although this is a good Quad."
"D: This one is a sipper for sure. The ABV and huge flavor punch make sure that it is a brew that goes down slowly."
"Incredibly drinkable, the dark fruit really smooths out the 11.3%. Great drinker."
"Overall this beer is great. I would drink it any day."
"edit/ just tried this again in better circumstances, and sipping it slowly I find it amazing how smooth it goes down and how well the booze is hidden. Definitely the most drinkable quad I've come across so far."
"Drinkability - Drinkability is great, but you don't want to session drink this due to the high alcohol."
"I finally got around to tasting this Quad masterpiece. Poured into my Duvel Tulip with a 3 finger head that lingers awhile. Smell is great with Dark fruits and sweet malts dominating. Taste is so very complex and wonderous. Raisins, plums, figs and spices are everywhere in a good way! Mouthfeel is similair to Abt 12 in this category. Drinkability is much better than expected from such a high ABV beer. You could definitely have more than one of these in a session!!!"
"All in all, this was a damn good Quadrupel and I'm thrilled to have tried this."
"this is the real deal. what a beer!"
"All in all, this is a delicious beer--a spectacular belgian quad that I'll continue to purchase for years to come. If you haven't tried it: do."
"M/D: Full body, but not very heavy. Carbonation is too high for my taste, too prickly and contributes to a bit of falling apart on the tongue. Drinkability is a little low for me, it's just such a big beer. Despite the huge booze presence, I can still appreciate this beer. The sample I had while in Belgium was much less bold then this sample."
"OVERALL: This one definitely lives up to the hype, and then some. It puts its little brothers, the Roch 6 and Roch 8, to shame. As part of the Quad Showdown, this was my favourite of the three by far. A thing of beauty in the glass and a real tasty treat, the Rochefort 10 is a real pleasure. Probably the most drinkable quad as well. Though one at a time is enough, this one will become a staple in the beer cellar."
"Overall a great beer. Tough to go wrong with a Trappist though."
"I've had this many times in the past and enjoyed it much more than today. I will have to re-evaluate this world class beer in the future and see if I rate it higher."
"wow! this stuff is good - huge head on every pour, having to wait for it to die down before i can sip - laces the glass thickly and fully -murky brown color - taste is very creamy smooth well balanced tasty malt - smooth mouthfeel as well - i could easily drink too many of these - exceptional brew."
"this is by far a favourite, more so than the famed St. Bernie 12 that is so beloved to my heart and to so many others as well. A polite bow to the devoted Monks at Abbaye St. Remy."
"Drinkability is amazing. This brew makes you want to come back for more, but will knock you flat if you drink too many too fast."
"Overall a world class beer. Been a long time since I've had sister beer Westvleteren 12 but from memory this stacks up quite well against it. I have a few bottles of Westy in the fridge and will review soon. I'm curious to compare the reviews."
"D=average drinkability though i would rank it higher for the style"
"This beer has a lot of good aspects of both strong ales and stouts. It's certainly one you have to drink every once in a while, 1 or 2 bottles is enough for sure."
"One great trappist quad howver only slight bettered by the Rochefort 8 which I consider to be slightly more rewarding, however only just and this is just my opinion"
"Still not 100% sure which I like better--the 8 or the 10--I think the mouthfeel here puts the 10 over the top, although I think I like the style of the 8 better."
"D- Very sessionable, if expensive, brew. My favorite Trappist ale yet."
"D: Considering this Belgian ale is 11.3% ABV, I would probably not venture into having a second, then again, I respect this beer too much to have more than one per sitting. It is a great Trappist brew and would recommend it to any beer connossieur."
"33cl bottle from Systembolaget, old school Lund status. Ok, here we go then. Very dark brown with a small tan head that leaves lacing til the end. the aroma itself is intoxicating: sweetness, vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, some butterscotch, and a little alcohol. The flavor is very sweet and alcoholic; a bit straight-forward in this respect, a lot of caramelized sugar flavor and ripe fruitiness. The body is very thick and full, but the alcohol keeps it from being too sticky in your tongue, and the coarbonation is ample but very soft at the same time. This is quite a beer, but I still like Rochefort 8 more, simply because its levels of alcohol and thickness make it a more pleasant experience. 10 is simply a massive beer, you've got to be ready for it for sure or it'll kick your ass."
"D:"
"Drinkability: This one kind of kicked my butt, but it was well worth and if I had a second bottle of it, it would have likely been drank in the same sitting. ABV is pretty big, so it's probably better in moderation, but this is easily one of the best balanced and tasty beers I've come across yet."
"Another classic from Rochefort. A very complex beer that mandates sipping slowly."
"I like this far more than either the 6 or 8. Very complex, rich and tasty. The bold spiciness surprised me, but the rich malts and dark fruits balanced it out nicely. Great stuff."
"Overall a great belgium quad, one i'll deffinatly be getting more of."
"330 ml pour into chalice. Moderate, yeasty off-white head. Very deep, dark brown pour. Definite aroma of dark caramel, ripe banana peel. Malt, caramel and alcohol on the nose. Wow! the alcohol hits you at the very end of the sip. Smooth beer, very flavorful. Drinking this around 60 degrees. I think I'm having a religious experience here. The flavor of this heavenly brew is simply - OUTSTANDING. All I know is I have come a very long way from the macro brews I consumed 6-8 months ago - CHEERS and God Bless the Trappist Monks!"
"D: It warms you as you drink in a marvelous way, a bit like good Scotch. Rochefort really makes a fine quad."
"My first Quad!"
"D: It's a sipper, but well worth the time it takes to knock one back. Take your time and try to figure out all that is going on in this."
"D - Smooth - hard to take in all this beer has to offer with a single tasting. Will definitely have to pick up another one of these."
"Overall - Paired it with some dry wild boar sausage; turning out to be a very good combination.I did enjoy this one, but I must try the other quads out there before I decide on what's my favorite. Give it a try if you've never had it."
"Drinkability: Very in your face up front but mellows out as it goes along. Not a session beer because of the high alcohol, but would definitely drink again."
"4.0 D: This is probably a little over-rated, but good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I really wish I had purchased more than one bottle because I could really go for some more right now. Next time, I'm drinking it warm - the flavor profile really picked up right at the end."
"D-Second only to Westy 12, and not by much, in my book. A quality and very complex brew that begs to be discovered. The flavours duck and hide and then peek out to offer themselves up for the imbiber. A most impressive offering from the Abbaye St-Remy monks!"
"Very good, but not mind-blowing like I had hoped it would be."
"I really liked this beer. More than I thought I would. It's sweet but not sickenlingly sweet and the alcohol is present but not overpowering. I'd be happy to drink this anytime... But not so happy to pay for it."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, very good representation of style, I can appreciate the beer's complexity & craftsmanship and while it's a really good strong Belgian beer to drink for a whole night, I've had other Quads that I would pick first."
"EDIT: Adding to my review, I had another of these last night on 5/4/09. I let the Rochefort 10 rest tonight at room temp for about 20 minutes before digging into it. The carbonation seemed less today and not in a good way, its mouthfeel was also a little thicker than I'd like. It seemed to be sweet without carbonation and spices to back it up, and had a really unique taste. Not adjusting my numerical scores today, but St. Bernardus Abt 12 is still king for me compared to this one."
"I would probably drink this all the time if I had the money to buy it. It's definitely a sipper, something to be enjoyed on a cold night after a long days work. Really good."
"Notes: This is one very dark, rich, complex, and strong ale. I didn't pair my sample with anything because I didn't want to distract my palate with anything other than the taste of this highly-touted beer, but next time I might drink this alongside a nice cut of beer or a strong cheese. Hopefully I'll get to do this sooner, rather than later, but at $7.50 a bottle it might be a while before I pick up another one of these beers, no matter how delicious it is. Regardless, if this is a beer that you have not tried yet, do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle next time you're at the store; you won't regret it."
"Smooth mouth feel -- a little boozy, but considering the ABV, its very well hidden. No problem drinking one, but putting two back would be a bit of a struggle. Definitely recommend it, but if you know you don't like cloves, you may want to think twice about forking over the cash."
"This beer is a nice dark maroon color with a great head not sure the inches b/c the smell kept my nose in it for awhile. It was served at a perfect 50 degrees. As fair as smell there is no Trappiste ale ive had (have had most all of this type) with such a great smell cant even describe it just such a wonderful smell. Taste even better than the smell or just as good. To me Trappiste ales are hard to describe taste/smell wise all i can say is ""most"" are very smooth with a high abv. you can even taste (especially this one). Mouthfeel not think at all very smooth overall. Way too easy to drink considering the abv. in this beer."
"this is one of the best beers i will ever have in my life"
"Drinkability: A definite beer. One that should be tried."
"In short, this lives up to the hype. Best trappist I've ever had, period."
"My experience with Beeradvocate.com is literally shaping who I am as a human being. I can't wait for the next 100, and I can't think of a better beer to celebrate my centennial. #10 is one of those that I have always wondered about, and now will always think of longingly. What an excellent beer. Thank God for the Catholic church, and for putting men in monasteries for so long that they literally had no choice but to create some of the finest beers on the planet to pass the time."
"This is a beautiful beer that should be savored. Nicely comparable to the Pannepot Grand Reserva but with a richer history and nicer aftertaste."
"Must say I am impressed. While Westvleteren really is the creme de la creme in the Quad class. One can see why this is the runner up."
"Drinkablility: this brew give a fantastic performance. it just grabs your palate and tells you who is in controll it linger on stage to long prehaps by it knows what it`s doing."
"Notes: Beautiful, truely amazing. I'm a huge Belgian fan and this one just ousted St Bernardous out of my number one. I saved this for a special occasion and it did not let me down at all!"
"D- This is a sit by the fire and contemplate life while you sip slowly away type beer. Very interesting and subtle in its presentation."
"overall: go NOW and have one!"
"A truly great beer. I was lucky enough to be gifted with two cases of this beer, which I have been slowly drinking over the last year. When this supply runs out I may actually cry into my last beer (and then proceed to go out and buy another stash)."
"M: Pretty good. Not thin, not ultra thick."
"It is drinkable. I like it a lot."
"D: Spot on for a huge quad."
"This is certainly one of the best beers of it's style. I really liked how it wasn't too over the top with the dark fruit taste or alcohol. Everything meshed together very well to create a wonderful beer to sip and admire."
"D- Nice brew that should be sipped and savored."
"By the time you finish it you have drunk the equivalent of half a bottle (750ml) of a Retsina wine. Would you have another one? Thankfully, the Rochefort 10 is much more accessible than its cousin the Westvleteren so you can have another one, albeit the price."
"Note: I'll be trying this beer again in a few weeks and will try to improve on this description."
"This is a fine beer, but lacks the depth to be the top of it's class. I love the availability, always a pleasure to drink."
"Overall: It's so nice to have such a great beer available all the time. If you haven't tried this one yet, do so."
"I didn't fully appreciate Belgian Quads when I first encountered them. (Granted, I thought I could, even despite not really liking the way they tasted). But over the years I've come to recognize their subtleties, acknowledge their distinctiveness, be cognizant of their disposition and have developed a better understanding of just how they not only symbolize, but quite literally are, the result of generation upon generation of skilled and devoted monks. Wow."
"Another good Trappist quad everyone should try."
"Drinkability is good, but not great. The level of carbonation and alcohol in the finish might turn a few people off."
"D: Starts out moderately drinkable, but ends as one of the more drinkable beers on the market."
"D:great beer, no doubt. I use this beer as a treat to myself!"
"This is a great great beer. I only wish I could get a Westy 12 now to pair it against that monster. No doubt in my mind this is one of the best beers I have ever had."
"D - Surprising drinkable for a quad of such high alcohol. Although a beer your want to drink slowly and savor, it would not be a chore to have more than one."
"Overall: Good quad but I don't feel it lived up to the hype. The mouthfeel is great it's nice and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good considering the style and alcohol content. As I said very good quad, but I feel that for the price I'd go with St. Bernardus 12 over this."
"D: Absolutely awe-inspiring. In fact, it's kind of humbling to know that the art of brewing can be taken to such heights. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, ""when a man is tired of Rochefort, he is tired of life."" Of course, if you possess enough wealth and leisure time to drink Rochefort to the point of tedium, I'll hardly be shedding any tears on your behalf."
"By far the smoothest beer I have ever had. Creamy and full bodied. The sweetness would make it difficult to have more than one bottle, but at 11.3% you don't need much more."
"Poured into a chalice. Dark purplish brown with a large fizzy tan head. Very sweet smell of plums, grapes, licorice, and pepper. Similar flavors in the taste... definitely some sugar, grapes, dates, and pepper. A strong dry and bitter alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and carbonated. Very smooth and drinkable. While this is still amazing, I had it before while in Belgium and remember it being even better."
"D: Quite good. Even with the additional alcohol feel, I think this is more drinkable than the Rochefort 8."
"D: A sipper for sure, but a remarkably balanced beer that's easy to drink."
"D- Very drinkable while not being overly sweet like some in the style. This is well balanced with a warming quality on the way down. 11.3% is quite high but what the hell i would drink a few, you only live once right! A great quad at a fair price with good availability, what more can you ask for."
"The first thing to hit the tongue is the strong carbonation. The flavors and complexity are so simple yet so brilliant. I taste earthy and dusty flavors up front like mold or mushrooms then later; wood, vanilla-oak, and toasty, smokey, raisins, burnt malt flavors. It finishes dry and crisp with a butterscotch sweetness in between. Great drinkability- alcohol is almost unnoticeable and the rich carbonation makes it a pure pleasure and a light drinker for such a strong well defined quad."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for such a strong beer, though one bottle was plenty."
"D: It's a fantastic beer, no doubt. I use this beer as a treat to myself!"
"very drinkable beer, I don't find the alcohol too overwhelming by any means. kind of expensive for 11.2 ounces, but that is expected i guess for a beer of this prestige."
"Overall, this being number 12 overall, I was a little disappointed. It is an amazing beer, but I have had better. I really enjoyed the smell. The alcohol was a little overwhelmng. I do recommend though!"
"D - this beer is definitely a sipper, but I could sip this all day long if it wasn't for the price."
"One of the best beers in the world. Period."
"This is a huge, delectable beer, and I could make a habit out of drinking this, except the price and the alcohol limits my consumption. But if your goal were to be driven insane and poor by beer consumption, I'd choose this as the way to go. A Rochefort 8 would also do, but the 10 will get you there quicker."
"Overall- This is a complex and magnificent beer, great aroma and flavor. If you are into Quads this is a beer you must try."
"D- If I paced myself I could drink this all night. The combination of subtle fruits and no ego makes this one a must have on hand"
"D: I'm really glad I finally had this beer. It was a very nice experience that I hope to have again."
"Poured into a Rochefort glass, dark brown in color with a nice tan head. Smells of molasses and Dr. Pepper. This sipper is heaven on earth. Could drink these all night if it weren't for the high ABV. The carbonation is perfect. This is a must try and one of my all time favorites."
"Memorable Quality: This beer is all over the place depending on age. Bottles aged a year or so have been some of the most dynamic quads I have ever had, younger bottles produce an everlasting white head that is like nothing else I've seen. Regardless, the sticky depth of dark fruits and other worldly yeast make this an all time great beer."
"I have one more bottle in the cellar and I think that will sit for ten years plus just to mellow out the alcohol and give the sugars a chance to degrade a bit. My goodness it's like eating pure sugar cane!"
"D: Very good tasting beer, still have the 6/8 sitting in the basement, but chose the goliath of these trappist beers. High ABV would keep me from drinking too many. Great sippin Belgian, way to go monks."
"I'm getting lots of wood, vanilla, bourbon. Lots of warmth in the aftertaste. This is a sipper. This is something that can be used to keep warm in these cold Minnesota winters."
"This is one awesome beer, and well worth the $6 price tag. I want more. Every bit as good as the uber-hyped Westvleteren, but very different."
"Overall, I am very impressed by this beer. I am not a huge belgian ale fan, but this is very good. I will definitely have this again and likely turn a few of my friends onto it. A very interesting beer."
"This beer hides it's alcohol level masterfully and is something that my friends and I are able to continue drinking and relaxing with on a long night."
"Drink: The high ABV and sharp carbonation makes this a very slow drink. One 12oz bottle is quite enough."
"D: A very good flavor, but the alcohol smell and taste are an absolute deal-breaker. There are similarly complex brews that do a better job of masking the burn. I will try the Rochefort 8, but I have no intention of purchasing the 10 again. A very undrinkable brew."
"drinkablity- very high you don't need to drink a lot of these to know what I mean,"
"Almost no hint of the alcohol in this one. Even at 11%, I'd have no problem drinking several bottles of this. Masterful."
"Notes: Trappistes Rochefort 10 is a great beer. It's a sweet and spicy, rich and complex, well-made Quad that delivers quite the headslap to those who imbibe. Excellent! Highly recommended"
"D- This is an excellent beer that is extremely well balanced. It bursts with fruity flavor and washes down with it's strong ABV. If it were any stronger it would be overwhelming, but it is just about perfect in my opinion. Does not dissapoint."
"Revisited 06/16/09."
"Drinkability is nice for a sipper."
"D: For sipping purposes only."
"This Quad hits the marks. Not quite as good as Westy 12, but this one is glorified in it's own unique flavor. A bit more dark fruit endowed, and a bit more smooth. This is one very, very fine beer."
"Drinkability - Easy to get lost in considering its 11%. Still not perfect, but its very smooth and palatable."
"D: If you wanted a reminder that beer is, indeed, and alcoholic beverage, this brew will call that to mind. Albeit, it does so with plenty of complex and crafted flavors. However, if you're drinking a quad, you know what you're getting into, should expect, and enjoy it. So, it's expected and enjoyably drinkable, slow sippin'."
"D - An excellent sipper here. A fine dark grape sweetness makes it an easy drinker, but be careful a well hidden 11.3% lies underneath."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a deep caramel with a pretty white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is laced with sweet fruit an alcohol. The flavor hints at dates, and alcohol with a finish that lingers. It is a full bodied with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel that you sip over the course of an hour."
"MF&D - exceptionally smooth, and easy to drink. the feel is perfect. not too thick or thin, just right and allows all the nuances of flavours to come out. the bluntness of the alcohol is the only thing that impedes the drinking process."
"This beer is fantastic. I will happily splurge on this beer many more times, although I do prefer the Trappistes Rochefort 8."
"This beer pours an incredibly dark and cloudy brown with a 1 fingered light tan head and some lacing. The smell is of raisins and molasses. The flavor is big, there is no shortage of malt in this beer, and certainly alot of dark malts, certainly the darkest quad I have ever tried. There are big hints of raisins and plums int he flavor backed with an enormous malt base... also this beer is quite sweet. The mouthfeel is decent with a rather low carbonation level and for an 11.3% abv beer this beer is HIGHLY drinkable :)"
"Poured to a dark brown cloudy color with a perfect sized (fit the glass perfectly) medium tan head that has good legs, leaving sheets of lace down the side of the chalice. This is a very good looking brew. The aroma has a warming alcohol smell, rum or brandy? Dark sugar, could be adding to why I feel it has rum like characteristics? Different fruit, apple and/or pear and cherries. What a fantastic and inviting mixture of aromas. The taste is simply fantastic, again going with the rum aspect, I pick up rum cake. Has a wood like flavor that seems to linger for a bit then disappears. The fruit does come out, but not as the apple/pear I noticed when I was first taking a whiff, with fig / date / prune flavors. Medium spice flavors that mix, oh so well. I know that a lot of folks say that they get banana when they drink this one, not for me as I can't pick up that flavor one bit. The feel of this one does not come close to the 11.3% alcohol level as it is very smooth and well hidden behind all of the interlaced flavors, though as this brew warms the alcohol esters do seem to come out a little more but in a way that is a complete complement to this brew. Very easy brew to drink even though it should be a sipper, but it is damn good and goes down quickly. Give this brew a try as it is simply a delight."
"D - A great sipping beer, for a special occasion."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark brown with faint ruby highlights and a smallish off white head that dissipates to a cap. Smells of dark fruit, burnt sugar, a bit of alcohol. Taste is fruity with a smokey funky taste. Some phenolic and bubblegum in there as well. The carbonation is a bit high. Body is thick, mouthfeel is bubbly/creamy. I loved the smell and taste of this one, but I thought the high carbonation did unfavorable things to the mouthfeel."
"D - This is very tasty and smooth. Be careful! The 11.3% ABV will sneak up on you."
"Enjoyed in Brugge at my favorite pub there. Pours a murky light black with a nice relatively full creamy head. The complexity of the dried fruit and bready flavors are very nice, but what makes this so special is how perfectly balanced and how nice the mouthfeel is. Probably the most drinkable beer I have ever encountered. A true masterpiece, and certainly among the elite trappist products."
"D - highly drinkable, one of my favorite quads (save Urthel)"
"Overall: Not my favorite style of Belgian beer. I think I'll have to keep trying with this style. There's too much going on for my likings. But that being said, the taste gets better the longer it's open and while it's warming up. But, on the final few swigs, the alcohol became too overwhelming and felt dry."
"an ok beer. im not huge on belgian quads so that might be my issue with this. it might be that im uninspired. but either way not really a huge fan of this."
"I need to go to Belgium....now."
"D- Woah. Drink a few other belgians for a while before having this Holy Grail. Otherwise, enjoy cause this one's heavenly!"
"Drinkability - like I said before love this beer and I find that two in a single sitting is all you need. It seems only to get better with age. Can't wait to see what another year does."
"This is a standout brew to drink and very good for style."
"medium creamy tan head, deep bromnish/reddish colour, there is precipitation in the liquid, guess that it is due to the fermentation? Aroma of dark fruit, alcohol and spices. Aroma is less sweet than many other beers in the same category even though it is clearly present in this one too. Taste is really nice, dark fruit, alcohol, spices and orange? Mouthfeel is lively, but not as lively as the rochefort 8, this is good, cause I think rochefort 8 isn't very good. This is by far the best belgian beer I've tried!"
"Pours a dark brown/black color. Strong aroma of citrus, plum, dark fruit, very sugary. Very complex aroma, slight alcohol. Smallish head, light tan, very fine bubbles. Flavor of dark fruit, flowery, rich complex flavor, citrus, grapes, some alcohol."
" Upon pouring this brew has a dark mahogany color with a wonderful thick, off-white head. The aroma is at first hard to detect through the head, but eventually hints of rasin, spice, and candied sugar show. The hop aroma is slight, yet still present. All I could say upon tasting was HOLY S**T! This brew has everything a world-class beer is expected to have. Sweet and malty at first, with, fig, rasin, brown sugar, dried fruit, and much more. It finishes sweet as well, but with a very nice, zesty hop touch. This beer is one of, if not, the best I have ever tasted. Even for it's high ABV, it is very smooth and delicate. It's velvety mouthfeel is to die for. It's one of the most quaffable brews I have ever tasted. Rochefort 10 is definitely one to stock up on."
"Buy as many of these as you can and drink them fresh or age them for a few years."
"Drinkability: Sip and savor this amazing brew"
"D - As with just about all the belgian beers I have had, the sweetness builds substantially and is the only hindering factor."
"an exceptional quad (duh!) this was a new bottle, i have enjoyed aged versions even more in the past. My one want from this beer would be a slightly bolder malt flavor, but who am i to complain."
"Notes - Yum."
"D: Overall a full bodied, robust beer with a sweet malty character and roasted notes that drinks like a dream."
"Upon tasting, I was correct. This beer is amazing. Perfect balance between the main components, malty up front with just the right amount of hop kick to keep it in check to follow. Sweetness is typical Belgian, but far from overpowering, I think the carbonation gives it a sizzle that acts as counterpoint. Hint of a grassy flavor, but nothing like a barnyard. Buried deeper in the flavor profile are dark fruits (plum? raisin? date?) and what to me tastes like licorice, or something similar. Mouthfeel is just thick and coating, but in a completely awesome way because of the high carbonation, keeps things moving. It's like drinking velvet, the consistency is just so easygoing. That makes for an amazing oral sensation as well as drinkability. There's a little boozy presence on the finish but it settles right in, not too hot or anything. I could drink this forever. I want to give 5's all around, I really do. I'm severely tempted, but i think it's just a little too much of a sipper to earn perfect marks for drinkability and mouthfeel. Not quite perfection, but this is pretty damn close to it. While I'm still pretty early in my beer drinking life, this may be the best I've had so far. Now I want to cellar one, and see how much closer to 5s across I can get!"
"Update 12/26/08. Aroma of dark fruits (apple, pear) and raisins. Flavor of sweet fruits especially apple. Quite boozy in the finish. I do enjoy this beer but I think I rated it especially high because it was the first good beer I really loved. Always a pleasure though. I think the 8 is better however, this beer can certainly vary from bottle to bottle. Unfortunately, I have to lower this rating. 9/5/9/4/18 (4.5/5)"
"You can see why this is a sought after Belgian. Glad I purchased several bottles. I'm interested to see what happens with some age on this."
"a wonderful treat to have in china."
"Of the big 3; Westy, St. Bernardus and Rochefort, this is my favorite. The flavors are hugely complex but don't beat me over the head. It can be an easy enjoyable sipper or a beer to be dissected and contemplated. Whichever you prefer this is the quad to buy."
"It poured out with a giant head. It might have been because I had some difficulty in opening the bottle, which made it bubble up so I had to pour a bit quicker than I would have. But its a dark brown with a few ruby red hues. The head is offwhite, and it lasted the entire time. I could even see bits of bubbles and sediment waiting around in the beer. The smell is yeast, and a bit of alcoholic sweetness. The taste is nearly perfect. I love the way all of the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the darkness, and even the good sweetness from the darker, roasted malts is extracted. If the alcohol content was just a little bit more subdued, namely if the bit of burnt alchohol taste was not present, I could've found a perfect 5 in this, but I really love it. The mouthfeel has adequate carbonation, a good amount of complexity from the darkeness and sweetness. And it drinks very well for the style. I could drink these until it caught up with me and knocked me on my ass. I will probably buy another at some point in the future."
"Yep, this is an exceptional brew. Very rich in color and body with a true-to-style florality and sweetness. Smells of carmel, yeast and floral. The taste is sweet, bready, sweet maltiness, and prevelant alcohol. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy with outstanding carbonation. A wonderful Quad."
"(rated Apr 26, 2007)"
"Overall this is a very tasty beer, but I think I give the edge to the 8. The 10 is very bold and the flavors all work together very well, but I think the 8 has just a tad more balance and is more drinkable. That being said, both of these should be tried by everyone."
"Are my expectations raised after reading how BA Mag rated this the ""best beer of all time""? Yes. The fact that this is made by monks in a tradition that is centuries old does not improve the appearance, smell, taste, or mouthfeel, but it does improve the drinkability from a historical perspective."
"Nicely drinkable this beer goes down smooth although it has a higher alcohol content which would make it a poor session beer this is much more of a nightcap."
"D - Not a highly drinkable beer at 11.30% but pretty decent for a quad."
"This one never lets me down, even after all these years (first had this in 2003)."
"Pours a deep brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is fruity sweet with currant and caramel. Flavor is very fruity and roasty to a lesser extent. Alcohol is noticeable, particularly going down but not nearly as much as the abv would suggest. Medium to heavy bodied, chewy texture. This is real beer, the way it is supposed to be made."
"Strong pruney raisin smell. Smells very vinous. Taste is strong -- lots of dry raisin and dark grape. Darker taste. Similar to St Bernardus Abt 12, but overall I didn't find nearly as much complexity in this brew. This is one of the most overrated beers on both this site and ratebeer. Still very enjoyable, however, especially if you like the Belgian Abbott/Quadrupels. I'm also not that big of a fan of the style, so that may sway my view as well. If you like quadrupels, you'll love this beer either way."
"A very nice and drinkable quad. Low on the phenols and high on the licorice. Probably one of my favorite quads to date."
"Q: Recommended? A: YOU BET!"
"D: Dangerously drinkable! The high ABV is hidden perfectly...can't tell it's there until the warmth washes over you half way through the bottle."
"Thick brown pour, fluffy creamy head. Malty, raisin aromas, dark alcohol. Lost of different sweet tastes, malt, caramel. Some dark fruit at first. This definetely improved as it warmed. Mellowed and became a little more sweet malty like an old ale. Pretty warming, I don't find the alcohol that offensive or even that present. Some lacing throughout. The best quad I've had for sure."
"D- Sipper but not because it's too heavy but something I want to savor. high alcohol gives it some knocks however There may be the only complaint although its not really a complaint"
"Dark brown beer, with a little cloudiness from the yeast. The head was thick and heavy, and barely diminished while I drank the beer. It smelled of figs or raisins with some maltiness. Tasted the same with a little sweetness. I detected a little hop bitterness. The beer felt like cream in my mouth. I did notice a little alcohol bite to it."
"A deep oily brown color, cloudy some sediment. The earthy aroma is wrapped with leather and sweet yeasty bread. There are hints of spices . There is a thin tan head . The taste is earthy and figs on the front, leather and oak on the end. This is a very thick chewy beer. The finish is sweet yeasty bread. This complex beer is very balanced."
"Scott"
"Oxidation a little more present in the taste - maybe a bit of a rusty metallic note, but not dominating. A lot of the same flavors, but a bit more fruitiness. Rich malts and stewed dark fruits. Brown sugar. Nicely carbonation as the appearance indicated, creating a very satisfying medium-bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable for its abv and the level of complexity is very high. A definite winner, fresh or aged - I really wouldn't see a need to push it more than 5 years though."
"Pours darker brown (than the 8) with some sediment. The head is just as big, but thinner and dissipates quickly. Nose is heavier in the malt, with toffee and alcohol prominent. Lighter mouthfeel than the 8. Malts, dates, and currants dominate the taste. Kind of a light cognac finish that comes out as the beer warms, unfortunately so does the alcohol. Both are great, but I like the 8 better."
"I first tried it years ago while I was in the military in Europe. I recently bought 12 bottles directly from Belgium. Shipping was a killer but still worth it. Everything about this beer is near perfect. Very strong but alcohol is hidden very well. Deep dark color with a nice tan head. Smells like heaven. The trademark Belgian spiced malts and rich fermented fruits is just fantastic. This one really warms ya up."
"D: The tastes in this beer are quite complex as is typical with Belgian's....this is classicly Belgian with an ABV that will kick you right in the crotch in a heartbeat. I find the alcohol isn't quite as blended in with this one, it's lurking it's biting head. One glass is about the extent of any indulging of this one. Tastes wonderful, just too strong in the alcohol department."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a frothy tan head. Aroma of dark fruits and malty caramel. Extremely smooth tating beer whcih is surprising given the high abv. Hints of dark fruit, caramel and chocolate with a slightly dry finish. This is my favorite beer."
"D- A little alchohol burn toward the end this is still a fresh bottle so I'm sure it will mellow with age but I couldnt wait to drink this gem."
"An excellent beer all around, but this could perhaps benefit from some age."
"pour a murky mahogany with nice beligan light chocolate foam. nose has been boozy at times. when good smells like nothing but pilsner hop at first. beligan sugar yet smooth... preserve like. plum, fig, pumpkin seed, leather, apricot, and brown sugar. excellent volume. no alcohol detected in a good bottle. palate is everything the nose is and gradually. smooth with a like hop wit h a nice leather malt finish. has a lamb meat quality. astringent hop. peppery and clove like. would recommend obviously with lamb. fantastic for game period."
"Overall - Frankly it's just not my thing. The complexity of the beer and the prowess of the brewery is undeniable, but for me it's near-undrinkable."
"Drinkability- I'm kinda wishing I would have tried one last year. I think the aging has affected it for the worse. I've had a few fresh and they were a bit better than this. Still an excellent beer, but prefer them fresher."
"Overall impression: This was not what i was expecting to be honest. I have not loved many Belgians. This one, however, I like quite a bit. It is definitely a sipping beer and at the prices they go for here, probably one I'll sip infrequently. Though, when i do, I'll enjoy it!"
"I still like St Bernadus abt 12 better as a Quad."
"This is an extremely complex beer, and one that all Belgian lovers should endeavour to try. I did enjoy it a lot, but did not find it to be a stellar leap over other classics, and in fact I though the Rochefort 8 was superior in terms of appearance and mouthfeel. In terms of quads, this kicks almost all of them into touch, and from the ones I have had, only St. Bernardus would beat it in my eyes."
"D: This drink plain scares me. I have had beers at a third of the ABV that were harder to drink. This is such a decadent beer. It makes you feel special. It makes you remember that beer is not a drink to pound down or at least not always. Amazing. Quite an experience. You have to try it."
"Outstanding. One of the best I've ever had."
"D- At 11. 3% ABV drinkability is subjective. But for this level of alcohol it's as drinkable as it gets."
"Everyone should enjoy this beer at some time before they die."
"Surely a great beer, but I'd probably get a Koeningshoven or a Quadrium before this one. In deference to the beer and brewer, who knows how this beer has changed since in left Belgium for Alaska. I think I like Pannepot better, but this is a world class brew."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with about a finger of light tan head that exhibits fairly good retention. Smells pretty good, some nice malty sweetness, some dark fruit esters and a complex alcohol aroma. The aroma here is very vinous with lots dark fruits such as plums, figs, and dark cherries. Alcohol aroma is both spicy and a bit like perfume. Taste is much like the aroma. Initially its fairly malty but sweetness quickly builds. The dark fruit esters are a constant and lurk just beneath the sweetness. As this brew warms a bit the flavors actually seem to come together a bit more; they mellow a bit and this becomes much more balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium-light+ in body with high carbonation. There is a very prominent alcohol presence here but its not overwhelming or harsh as the alcohol takes on perfume like characteristics. Drinkability is pretty good. I had expected a bit more out of this beer but it was enjoyable none-the-less."
"Drinkabiltiy: With the high alcohol - this guy is a sipper, and the alcohol makes it a bit tough to knock down. That said, paired with some nice artisanal cheeses and candied fruits - and you have yourself an enjoyable experience."
"Future outlook: I'm sure that this beer will meet again with my mouth somewhere down the road...."
"D: A very flavorful and complicated beer, if you concentrate you can pick out its various characteristics. would love to be pairing this with a desert as it seems lonely to consume all on its own."
"D= great but the abv is so high you would get sloppy very quickly"
"Probably the best Quad that I have had to date. Still got a Westy 12 to drink soon though so we shall see if that stands."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is on par with Westvleteren 12, and seeing as I have immediate availability to this beer, I prefer this one."
"Notes: awesome example of the style."
"Maybe it's not the greatest beer in the world but it's absolutely one of my 'always in stock' beers and the one I grab in a pub if there's nothing else really interesting. Especially at the end of a great evening. It's a pity that it's less spicy than it used to be and has become sweeter as well according to the general trend. But still. A well balanced, very flavourful, great looking and easy going beer for such high ABV."
"D- This is a really solid brew, easy to drink and very dangerous. Highly recommended on this one."
"D= A world class sipper and still one of my top 5 favorite Belgian ales. Worthy of all the hype. Despite the ABV, I could happily drink a few of these in an evening."
"The body is big as expected. Very smooth overall with a silky texture. Great complexity. Carbonation is light for style but does allow all the flavors to come out. Some heat from the alcohol is a bit of a deterrent. Overall a great quad with some minor malt notes that IMO are off. Great yeast representation with a bit of heat but still very nice."
"This is a full bodied brew, a very rich and the awesome taste lingers in your mouth, begging for another sip. This is by no means a sessionable beer, however the drinkability on this is astounding."
"D: A very enjoyable beer to sip on. The high alchol will limit the amount consumed at any one time."
"A very good beer!"
"D - Very good"
"4.5/4/4.5/4/4 = 4.3"
"THIS is the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I knew this as I smelled it - I hadn't even had a sip yet. It pours a beautiful dark ruby with a nice creamy head. This beer has so much flavor that its almost hard to handle. Strong fruits and malt - alcohol is strong and you definitely know its there but its blended well. I'm going to buy a few more of these so I can drink the last one in the fridge and same some for different special occasions. If you see this beer available near you, BUY IT."
"Deep and somewhat murky ruby brown. A gorgeous tight and frothy head rises up with tiny little bubble and amazing retention. Leaves spots of sticky lacing down the glass and doesn't fade below a nice cap for the entire session. Smell is very lovely and something I couldn't quite get used to. A nice fruit scent along with rich malts. Figs and plum with lightly toasted caramel and toffee, also chocolate. It also has a distinct leathery aroma that I find appealing. Great taste as well. Nice spice and yeast that compliment the other flavors of this brew. Some brown sugar is added to the mix. Caramel is still there and the chocolate is also present. A superb mouthfeel that is so soft and creamy on the tongue. Silky smooth with a slight peppery spice to compliment the feel toward the end. Just the slightest warm dryness in the finish but a welcome one indeed, reminding one that this is a sipper to savor. I really like this one. Had it once before but didn't appreciate the experience so much. This is one to remember and definitely one I'll come back to with colder months ahead."
"D- This isn't sessionable but you shouldn't expect it to be. It's a quad for god-sakes. For what it is, a quad, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. I only got warming which is nice, so I can safely say this is drinkable."
"Excellent. Almost up to the St-Bernardus 12."
"D- very drinkable; this is a great winter warmer or dessert beer."
"This is a great beer and I feel like it has been a pleasure letting the alcohol sneak up on me."
"An amazingly complex beer, one of my favorite it not favorite quads, i wish they bottled this in a 750ml bottle because 11.2oz is not enough"
"Drinkability: If you like Trappist beer or Belgians for the most part, then prepare to make room at the top of your list for this one."
"Would love to try it on tap."
"Great perfume, some sweetness, dark rich balanced, great finish. It really has it all and you can enjoy a 12oz bottle yourself. Very complex malt, smoke, wood, roasted quality and great texture. Dark christmas spice with carmel. Really enjoyable and glad it is somewhat available all the time. Hail to the Trappistes!"
"D--Upon taste, wouldn't have guessed 11.3 ABV. But this is serious stuff. A warming sipper."
"Alcohol let you know that it is there, but over all, very drinkable."
"Notes: I certainly respect this beer. It has an uncommon complexity that is rare. It has that great begginning and just before the punch of alcohol there is a wonderful sweet, malty taste but then that tremendous body slam of alcohol followed by a long aftertaste of complex malt and hops."
"Drinking the ale was a delight, and I found it smoother than the Rochefort 8 yet with the same chocolate and cocoa flavours. Being so dark and full, the 10 is a very rich beer, and definitely not a beer that you would want to be drinking as though it was a run of the mill lager. Despite the smoothness of the beer, there is also a slight touch of bitterness adding a nice counterpoint to the sweetness, like burnt caramel. In the final taste though there was a distinct alcohol taste."
"This is a very complex and well crafted beer. I enjoy it, but my heart lies with Rockefort 8."
"D: Delicious and beyond drinkable. Tough to even do this one justice."
"Overall: very good"
"Despite being a sipper and 11.3 abv i could easily session this if i wasn't on a college student budget."
"D -- Can't drink this all night (but that is not the point is it). Maybe two and call it good."
"Edit: A year later to the day (completely by accident) I am revisiting this beer and enjoying it as much or more than the first time. Dated for the last day of 2013, this is still reasonably fresh. Mouthfeel is better than I remembered being much softer on the palate. Still one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: I love this quad, it's not an everyday beer obviously but one very drinkable quad."
"This beer pours a hazy dark brown/reddish hue with a small creamy off-white head. The nose is a combination of dark fruits like raisins and figs, candy sugar, slight banana, fruity esters, and you can smell the alcohol in this beer as well. The taste is quite complex with the main players being banana, dark fruit, caramel sweetness, vanilla, and some peppery spices. A really nice combination of flavors and they work really well together in this Quad. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite smooth with moderate carbonation, and I certainly get the warming alcohol on the mouthfeel as well. The drinkability is really quite nice for a beer that is 11.3% ABV, but it is a sipper and not your everyday type beer."
"Drinkability.... you can have just one and be very happy, or still want for more. This is a serious beer, I prefer have one and meditate on how great it is."
"Overall this is a very good beer. The Trappist's really know how to make a good one."
"Pours a dark, thick brown with no light seeping through. A lot of chunks and has a thick off-white head. Aroma is off honey and fruit, slight maltiness. Taste is complex, some ripe fruits and malts, but on the sweet side. Texture is excellent, on the chewy side and is thick and heavy. A very good session beer, but with the high ABV and since it is on the sweet side no more than a couple at a sitting. Very enjoyable beer, one of my favorites."
"Mouthfeel was zesty with tingly carbonation. Medium to full density. Somewhat hot in the throat."
"For a quad of 11% very drinkable. I enjoyed this excellent beverage with some sharp cheese, a masterpiece."
"D: Definitely a beer to sip though no trouble finding my way to the bottom of the glass."
"For my money & from these Monks, I think I'll stick with the Rocherfort 8."
"Poured out of a 330 ml bottle. Served in a small chalice. Dark brown appearance with a good head and lacing. Had a raisiny, peppery nose. I thought the taste was excellent. Grapes, malt...alcohol comes through but I was not overwhelmed by it. I love this beer"
"This is definitely a beauty. Full bodied and complex with almost a sherry like warming. Not for the faint of heart but if you like abbey traps, you'll probably love this one."
"Overall a definite top 10 beer. The flavors are so complex in this beer it makes it a treat. It is really quite sophisticated. For most, it wouldn't be considered a beer due to its complexity. For the beer geek it is bliss."
"Amazing beer!"
""
"M,D: The lively carbonation did this one well and the drinkability is very high. The huge ABV is hidden very nicely."
"A dark brown pour is topped with a hearty two finger rolling, dark tan head. Head retention is average and leaves behind an uneven lacing all around the glass. Sediment chunks float throughout and there's a dark swirly spot of something or the other in the middle of the head. Smells sweet with some licorice, chocolate and malts being most evident. A biscuity base is also evident. A panoply of chocolate, caramel and licorice candies light up the taste buds in the front with some grapes and apples in the middle all followed by some invigorating spice and hops. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied and well carbonated while the alcohol is almost nondescript. This brew exudes quality, but there's a little something missing that keep it's from attaining godliness."
"An aged bottle is preferred for my tastes, and i'll rate one again in the future..."
"Poured into the proper glassware, the 10 is a dark, very opaque brown with an off-white head. Not much foam and it doesn't really last. Lacing is not extraordinary. Smells of malt, caramelized sugar, alcohol, hops, and spices, along with a somewhat unappetizing fruit character that borders on rotten. Tastes quite malty up front, with plum-like esters, chocolate/toffee, spices, and some medicinal phenols. This is a fresh bottle, and the alcohol is quite brazen. Full bodied, but carbonation is a bit high. An interesting sipper, but certainly not very drinkable by nature, and easily the worst of the Rochefort beers."
"D-Would drink 100, but would be on the floor after 6 or so."
"Perhaps the best beer I have put to my lips. Its really as simple as that. Smooth, balanced, tasteful. Definitely sweet tasting. I knock it down on the smell category simply because there wasn't much to smell; with clear sinuses I picked up almost nothing. But beyond a doubt, what it lacks in aroma is more than made up in taste, this is a special beer, and has even brought the entire style--Belgian ale--up to one of my favorites. Absolutely worth it. The cost is high, but you won't regret the splurge."
"D-A wonderful Belgian quad - certainly deserving of it's ranking. Although it carries a high ABV, I wouldn't count that against it's drinkability. While not ""sessionable"" in the typical sense, this is definitely a quad that a person could have a couple of beers and really enjoy the experience of drinks one of the world's best beers."
"medium body fantastic drinkability. it's definitely a sipper though. there is a damn good reason this beer is in the top ten."
"Pours a dark brown color with maybe some hints of crimson on the side, a decent tan colored head and good lacing. Cap sticks around. Wonderful aroma of chocolate, grass, caramel, dark fruits, and deliciously sweet. No hops. Taste is much better than I remember. Not as much weird earthy funkiness, but there's notes of apple skin, chocolate, plums, light raisin, and molasses. Yumm, this is much much better. This finish long with a yeast and minty herbal like quality on the back of the tongue. I can't even believe my old review. Mouthfeel is full but carbonation is a little high at first, but slowly mellows with some swirls. This bottle is about 2 years old, so it's holding up quite well. A very good beer and satisfied my recent desire for a quad."
"D- I'll have one any day, but not 2 with the 11.3 ABV."
"Its hard for me to review this beer cause im not sure i have the experiance yet to fully give it the review it deserves, All i can really say is that the complexities and balance on it are the best i have ever had. Very rich and smooth everything comes through with every drink you take. Perfect carbonation level and a very warming brew, i'll be setting 2 of these back for later and haopefully i'll be able to do a better review next time i have it"
"An outstanding brew, deserving of the rep and the hype."
"D- Very drinkable in spite of the alcohol content...although with a beer this delicious and complex, who'd want to rush?"
"D-High ABV make for a one in a setting brew."
"It is definitely a good beer, but I doubt I'd have more than one in a sitting."
"D - Oh my, this is one VERY good beer. The ABV is well hidden."
"Drinkability: Well what's not to love about this one. A dangerously tasty and well-crafted beer, and well worth the ~$7.50 I paid for it. Alcohol is high but never harsh or chemically, and the sheer complexity of the beer makes every percentage point worth it. Highly recommended ... but I didn't need to tell anyone that, now did I?"
"Pours a dark, dark brown that looks a bit tea-like when held up to light. The head is big and rocky and dissipates fairly quickly leaving little lacing. The smell is hugely complex and dominated by dark fruits and spices - plums, grapes, cinnamon, pepper. The taste is much like the aroma but has a much bigger Belgian yeast flavor that then gives way to huge dark fruit flavors along with a bit of brown sugar and caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with big carbonation that dance over the tongue. This is one helluva well-crafted beer and extremely drinkable despite the ABV. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a deep mahogany color, beautiful, dense (looks like you could float a quarter on this thing!) sand-colored head rises, fades slowly, and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is spicy, dark fruit, rich malty textures...one of the better examples of a beer where the smells become much more pronounced as it warms. Taste delivers on the dark fruit, I'm getting some fig, spicy alcohol, some molasses, somewhat nutty. Really creamy mouthfeel, great warming alcohol, lots of lingering spiciness. This is excellent."
"Pours a cloudy medium brown color with fluffy tan head. Smells mildly of raisins, figs and tastes mildly of raisins, figs, plums, some cinnamon, but the whole thing was spoiled by a hint of vinegar. The flavors just aren't very strong, and the vinegar flavor ruined it for me. Doesn't compare with St B at all, nor with Westy."
"Poured smooth from the bottle. I had this after the Rochefort 8 and immediately noticed the heavier malts and fruity esters. There is plum and raisin along with a nice malt. Head left fine lacings down the glass. I liked this beer very much, but I couldn't see having more than one in a sitting. I recommend giving it a try."
"D: For the alcohol content, I could drink this stuff all night. I keep trying to cellar this beer but I'm unable to stop drinking up my stock."
"Pours a dark murky brown with a thin head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma was an abundance of burnt caramel, dried fruits and molasses. Taste is an absolute plethora of all good things you could imagine in a beer; caramel, toffee, maple, dried fruits, slight bitter chocolate, coffee, the could go on and on! The beer is full bodied, but not overpowering at all, actually very smooth. This is certainly one of those truly special beers that is worthy of the BA top ten, I'll definitely have this one again."
"D- great sipper, solid very enjoyed"
"Pours dark brown, root beer color - very cloudy. It has a 1/16 inch, off white head. Smells of toasted malts, nuts, and herbal hops. First sip is creamy, smooooth, complex - almost chewy. This beer blows my mind. It tastes strong as the 11.3% ABV is not hidden - it is in your face, yet it tastes kind of light and somehow this brew is so damn creamy."
"D - a shame it's not a bit colder outside as the ABV is certainly a bit warming. Is this beer drinkable? It's Rochefort, so yes! A truly worldclass beer. Drinking brings back many fond memories of my introduction to good beer through Belgians when I was younger. A true joy that every BA should experience."
"Poured bottle into a affligem goblet. Pours a murky dark brown with a thin off white head. The head dies quickly and beer seems to have little carbonation. Smells are amazing. Lots of sugary malts, burnt sugars and some alcohol. Some dark fruit in there too. Taste is complex. Lots of different flavors but everything works flawlessly. Some raisins and dark fruit. Some alcohol, yet finishes crisply and dryly. Still finishes sweetly too. I cannot believe how easy this 11% is to drink. I finished the beer and was completely upset that it was gone. Can't wait to have another!"
"d: still a great beer; not better or worse than fresh - just mellow and different"
"Had been looking forward to trying this beer for a while now. Boy was I disappointed. I honestly cannot think of one redeeming quality about this beer. It started off well. The appearance was a very nice copper color. The smell was awful. It smelled like rotten fruit and upon drinking it did not get any better. Very bitter and sour tasting. Not pleasant at all. By far the most disappointing beer I have ever had. I am hoping that I just had a bad bottle but after talking with others it seems that this is the norm now for Rochefort."
"This bottle of goodness travelled all the way from southern Belgium, where it is brewed by one of the only Trappist Breweries in the world. Rochefort makes three Ales -- the 6, the 8, and the 10. I recently purchased a 10 at New Beer in Manhattan and aside from having sampled a large number of high powered Trappist ales in Antwerp over the summer, this is the most intense and amazing beer I've ever had, period. This is one of the few brews that I have had which are deserving of the ""Life is Beautiful"" tag. Whenever there's a beer that there's not much more to say about other than ""if you haven't had this, you haven't had beer," I'll just tag it like that to keep it simple. Rochefort 10 is full of amazing flavor like dried fruits and other dark and mysterious things. There's a ton of alcohol at almost 11.5% ABV, and you can taste it. But it doesn't matter, because you're literally swimming in a full bodied, complex, ocean of a beer that is the very blueprint for hundreds of imitators. Seek Rochefort now and seek it often. Reviews of the 6 and 8 are forthcoming."
"M/D - Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that is well carbonated bringing it to life in your mouth. The alcohol is very high, but it is so darn smooth and easy drinking."
"D - Very drinkable but given its ABV one would be quite limited. This isn't the type of ale to have out on the deck in summer heat, but it would be splendid pretty much any time, anywhere."
"Pours a very dark brown with a stone colored khaki head. Aroma is malty and has hints of cherry brandy, dark fruit, chocolate and a slight almond nuttiness to it. The mouthfeel is full-bodied. Pleasant maltiness upfront. Chocolate and dark fruit arrive midway. Finish is warming, almost like a brandy. Very complex beer. One that's perfect to sit with, enjoy and contemplate."
"Creamy and sweet in the mouth, but with more carbonation than I expected. Still feels like a treat though. The ABV prevents me from downing several bottles, but boy, with that taste, I'd like to."
"This is a fantastic beer, plain and simple. There is a reason this is rated so highly on this site. I may not be experienced enough in the tasting of fine ales to be able to appreciate all of this beer's many facets, but I know quality when I encounter it. This beer is of the highest quality. Perhaps not the best beer I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. If you have access to this and have not yet tried it, I suggest you do so immediately, if not sooner. Highly recommended."
"Bottle purchased locally. Poured a cloudy purplish-brown color with a medium light-brown head. Aroma is malty with a hint of brown sugar and sweet spices. Mouthfeel is kinda fizzy. Flavor is heavy in alcohol, with some fruit and it. However, this isn't that good. I think I got a bad bottle, because it tastes kinda rough and yeasty (and I poured it correctly). I will give this another shot, because this one wasn't anywhere close to the other trappist beers I've had."
"D - 1 bottle is about right for me, has a warming effect, I'll drink on special occasions."
"Wonderful fruity aroma, raisins, sugar, syrup, and some malt notes. Appearance is a deep dark almost black shade of red with a huge off-white head. Flavor is great, but I had one about a year ago, and it was layers upon layers of complex flavor. Ever second, a new taste would push itself to the forefront and overwhelm your taste buds for a second, then another delectable taste would push its way through. This bottle is different. It's more straight forward and not that complex menagerie of flavors, but it still is a wonderful tasting beer. I was looking for the beer that I tasted so long ago, so I guess it disappointed me a little. Great Quad."
"Taste is rich, light alcoholic tang. Sweet malt is dominant but not overpowering. Dark, ripe fruity character. Silky smooth on the way down."
"Taste is far too carbonated at first, like a cola, so I decided to let it sit for a while and warm up at the same time. Taste is dominated by the malt with loads of spice kicking in, slight alcohol warming sensation but overall it's quite well hidden, decent dark fruit presence, carbonation is still a bit high but more manageable with waiting."
"Absolutely outstanding. Now that I've tried it there is no way I will be able to see this beer without snatching it up and immediately drinking it. Cannot believe I waited as long as I did to try this."
"D: This is some dangerous stuff. I could definitely put down a few of these with no problem - very enjoyable and very drinkable, especially for its style."
"A complex beer that is worthy of the praise it receives. The high ABV, cost, and availability lowers the drinkability."
"All in all this is an amazing beer, and probably my favorite quadrupel, maybe even more favorite beer period! HIGHLY recommended!"
"D: very nice trappist beer and belgian quadruple. Absolutely worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is very silky and a little heavy. Drinkability is somewhat hindered by the sweetness and high alcohol content, but this really is a delicious beer.."
"My first Trappistes Rochfort 10. Trappist glass. Pours a dark brown with a one finger head. Aroma of caramel, plums, raisins, and yeast. Incredibly complex taste. Detect all sorts of dark fruits, caramel, floral finishes. Definitely some vinegary wine notes. Impressive, impressive beer. Gets better with each sip."
"Drinkability- Prob take down 2 before moving onto to a something with more yeast to balance it out"
"The color and smell led me to believe that this would be an entirely different beer than it was. Instead of a very malty, coffe-ish drink, it's incredibly smooth and creamy with lots of subtle flavor."
"As with all fine Belgians and especially the Trappists, mouthfeel is crucial. #10 is no slouch--amply carbonated, never letting down, robust. Were it not for the head slap that the 11.3% provides, this would be a 5 on the drinkability scale hands-down. On flavor and desirability, however, #10 takes the cake, an extremely delicious beer that, like its counterparts #6 and #8, brings complexity and originality. #10 is no letdown, reminding me why Trappistes Rochefort remains my favorite Belgian purveyor of fine beer. Tremendous."
"D- This is one that I'm not going to buy again. Perhaps I just got a crappy one, or it went bad. Drank right after purchase. I'm not one to pour a beer down the drain, but it is tempting. Then again I'm not one to waste beer, good or bad. I did prefer the Rochefort 8 more. This beer seems very one dimensional. I know I'm rating this beer pretty low, but I've had lots better quads then this."
"Pours a reddish brow with a thick two finger tan head. The head lasted for about 4 minutes untill it shrunk down to about an eight of an inch. Smell is great. Full of spices and alcohol and sweet dark fruit. Taste was equally as good. Has a sweet fruity start with some black licorice mixed in. Then it moves to a carmel malt and alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was exceptional on this beer. The head and carbonation have a lively feeling in the mouth."
"LOTS of sediment in my glass, not sure if that's part of the deal with this beer or not. Decently flavored but not all that complex (at least my pour). A good beer overall, but personally, and it might just be this tasting, but didn't really scream at me ""I am an awesome quad, hear me roar!""."
"I guess I expected more from this beer. Decent aroma, fruity, with some unexpected bubblegum, better than most, but I like the Gouden Carolus Xmas more. Same comments for the taste. Very nice, easy to drink, but not very complex, I want more nose for the price of this one. Easily drinkable, hard to know it 11% abv, amazing for that! Just needs more complexness."
"Medium to full bodied, it is a little on the sweetish side, fruity and malty, along with some spiciness and a moderate alcohol warmth. Very good, but just not at the top of my preferred belgians. Have to age this at least a year, it will probably improve."
"I've been saving this one for a while. Pours a deep ruby color with tints of brown. Very effervescent with a thick white head the remains constant throughout. Lacing is present all the way down the glass. Aroma is very complex with raisin, fig, brown sugar, and cooked fruit. The taste is reflective or aroma, the alcohol is present but not overwhelming it balances the sweet fruit flavors. The flavors linger on my tongue for minutes. A very intense and beautiful beer. The experience is amazing but it is most certainly a sipping beer."
"I tried this Rochefort 10 for a couple of reasons; firstly I'm trying to branch out style wise, and I was also fortunate enough to find a bottle. I don't really have any experience with Trappist ales, aside from large amounts of Chimay blue label I was drinking last Christmas. A very fulfilling brew that I look forward to having in the future."
"Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. This one is dangerous at 11.3% because it is so easy to get down. This is one of the best Belgian Quadrupels I've ever had. I will buy this every time I see it in the store. Try it or I will find you!!!!"
"As I said, it is a monstorous beer. I wouldn't say it's an effort to drink through, but there has to be a right mood. Amazing flavours, full carbonation, and heavy alcohol. It is still well rounded, and one of the best the world has to offer!"
"Pours a rich brown, with a medium tan head. The head is very smooth and the carbonation bubbles very small. Smell is of raisins, brown sugar, with a hint of alcohol. Taste is rather dry, though this is a malt oriented beer. It is also slightly spicy, with a bit of heat from the alcohol. There is a bit of oak like character to the beer, along with a slight amount of earthyness. The hop profile is very mild. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are quite smooth. For its alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer, though for maximum enjoyment (and at $5.50 for a 11.2oz bottle) it is best enjoyed once per drinking session IMO. A fantastic trappist ale that I plan to buy again."
"Excellnt"
"D- A sipper for sure. ABV is certainly there. I found this one to be highly enjoyable as an after dinner treat."
"D: While not my favorite example of a quadrupel (that would be St. Bernardus Abt 12), it is still a very tasty beer."
"One of my favorite Belgian beers thus far. Highly recommended."
"D = Great drinkability, a fine beer when in the mood for a nice strong complex beer to relax with."
"Poured a gorgeous deep brown with virtually no head. It appears to be slightly hazy. The aroma is sweet, of dark ripe fruits and spicy with a slight medicinal alcohol smell. This reminds me of drinking whiskey. Very warming to the throat and mouth. The flavor isn't as deep and complex as i thought it was going to be. It mostly just tastes like dark ripe fruit and alcohol. It does taste better as it warms though but still mostly one dimensional. Similar to cough syrup. Slightly drying. The feel is tingly from the carbonation and fairly light."
"Served in my Maudite snifter. Poured a deep opaque brown with a thick, three-fingered off-white head; excellent retention and lots of tiny ringlets. Nose was bold out of the bottle, but more subdued in the glass. Scents of dark fruit (fruit and plum), as well as candi sugar and some mild spiciness in the background. Flavors similar to nose; however somewhat of a medicinal quality detected. Not really alcohol-laden, but more herbal in nature. Lively mouthfeel without too much burn; just a consistent tingle across the tongue and palate. Alcohol was very well-hidden. Glad I finally had the opportunity to try this one out."
"finally got one of these ; pours a deep garnet-brown w/ a stiff tan head which sticks around for a while leaving a nice bridgework lacing all the way down ; a moderate smell, sour burgundy and dark fruits, hot alcohol and some hops faint in the mix ; a crisp, tart, brandy-like flavor, strong pils malt and darker malt in front, with a fruity, almost ""perfumey"" undertone, dark fruit, munich & some hops in the finish ; a dry, med-full body, drinks lighter than it tastes with a good amount of co2 ; an excellent beer, but i believe this one to be too fresh (10/12 BBD) and not for the faint-hearted..."
"Dark brown to black in color with a 1/4"" tan head. The nose was complex and filled with raisin, plum, malt, cherry, currant, orange and yeast. In the mouth the beer is medium-bodied with lots of carbonation and a long lingering finish. The flavors follow that of the nose. While quite nice and easily drinkable, for me, it needs more concentration and weight to catch my attention."
"Pours an opaque brown, with a 1"" cream-colored head. Main aromas are figs, raisins, Belgian yeast, and a hint of molasses. Taste is rich, warming creaminess; more dark fruits and yeast, with drying tobacco notes and slight hop bitterness. Exquisitely balanced; for a beer of such heft, it maintains drinkability with the drier flavors in the finish. I wish I could find a way to date these bottles, because I bet it ages fantastically."
"perfect score for a perfectly crafted trappist. You really have to respect the quality and complexity of this beer. This is the fine wine of beers. the taste is very complex. Warming with lots of alcohol. you get the taste of dark dried fruits and some nuts in there too to complement it all Very dry and carbonated. Ive had the 6,8 and the 10 and i really think this is the best one it seems to be more mature than the others. I had 2 bottles and i let one age for a bout 5 months after the first and the only thing i remember being different between the 2 was the sediment on the bottle. I need to try it again before i can explain it better so you just have to try this for yourself and be aware of the background of this beer and i think you will respect it more"
"With 900+ reviews, what else can I say about this beer? This has to be one of the best balanced 11% beers I've ever had the pleasure of having the pleasure of. It poured a dark cloudy ruby brown into my gullet and tasted carmelly sweet with a hint of fruit on the way down. Nice warming alcohol effect afterwards. Absolutely tremendous beer. Rochefort has to be one of my favorite of the Trappist offerings, possibly only behind Westvleteren which I have yet to try but have in the cellar."
"Overall: I really love this beer, i wish i could get it cheaper or on tap, but what can ya do?"
"I was quite impressed. Obviously drinkability as far as quantity is hampered by abv, but I will be craving this 'til I have it again. Definitely recommended."
"Emptied bottle into an oversized wine glass creating over a fingers worth of light brown head. Through the glass it looked a dark chocolate brown color. First whiff I got had mellow alcohol and sweet scents to it. Decent taste, slightly sweet with lots of subtle flavors that were hard to pick out but vanilla and black licorice were two of the ones that I could detect. Very easy to drink feels very smooth on the tongue. The only thing I didn't like was halfway thru the flavors turned into medicine like cough syrup. Tasty drink but I was expecting something more from such a high rated beer and was a little disappointed."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied with very solid carbonation. At 11.3%, this one is damn smooth and easy to drink. I'd happily take down 2 or 3 if I had them available. This is an excellent beer. No doubt about it. Certainly a ""can't miss"" for Beer Advocates."
"The carbonation is too strong for my tastes especially at the start of my glass, but later resolves to a more satisfying level. Overall there is a very full bodied feel on the tongue. The carbonation is somewhat off in my tastes and serves the beer satisfactorily, but fails to compel it to greater heights that I've enjoyed in other Belgians. I'd love to have cases of this on hand, but the price would be difficult to swallow. Altogether an amazing beer that must be tried at least once and preferably several times!"
"Pours a dark brown amber, very dark and hazy, with a thick white head. The aroma is of dark smoky malts, dried fruits, and alcohol. The flavor is heavy and robust. Woody, smoky, burnt malt, leather and earthy flavors stand out. These flavors cover up some date, fig and prune notes. The alcohol is warming and lets you know its there and that this is a strong beer, with strong flavor and 11.3% abv. The palate is full, with a dry earthy finish."
"R- Classic. It gets better everytime."
"Notes: At first, I was skeptical with all the hype built up around this, however, it is well justified. This is a beer that was crafted with the finest of care and it shows. I thought the Trappistes Rochefort 8 was pretty good, but this one wins between the two, hands down."
"D: Definitely a sipper and one to drink at the end of the night."
"Pours a cloudy deep dark brown with over an inch of thick cream colored head. Long lasting retention with great silky lacing. Smells of dark fruits like raisins and cherry, molasses, bread, and alcohol. Reminds me of Rum Raisin. Taste is interesting and constantly changing, picking up spiced fruits like apples and bananas, a molasses/toffee backbone, some cocoa, dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and cherries, and the warmth of alcohol. Smooth and creamy with a nice carbonation that really only pops up in the finish along with the 11.3% alcohol it's packing. Definitely a sipping beer. Took me a few sips to grow accustomed to it, but I'll definitely pick more of this up for special occasions. Very flavorful with lots of different things coming out with every sip."
"It definitely holds up with St Bernardus and Westy12, but has more alcohol in the mouthfeel with frothy carbonation. I think this beer will be outstanding when stored properly for at least a year or longer."
"While in Belgium during a trip last year I discovered Rochefort and decided to bring back a bottle of the 10 (among a few others). I got some good news today so I decided to pop the bottle in celebration. This one has aged for about a year and poured into my chimay chalice a nice deep brown with a touch of ruby around the edges. The head rose to about 2 1/2 inches then slowly dropped to a solid layer of tight foam that covers the top. The smell is rich boozy raisins and other fruits giving great promise. The taste is rich with chocolaty notes along with sweet dark fruits. There is a very familiar flavor here that I cannot put my finger on but it is fantastic all around. Alcohol is present only in the background and as a slight warming at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and lush, precisely what I would want in a beer that is extraordinarily complex and delicious. When I was in Belgium I drank a lot of the 8's and several 10's and I have to say that Rochefort is my favorite beer. There is something new to discover in every sip."
"This is a very interesting beer with great depth and drinkability."
"This poured a very dark, opaque brown with some tan head. It smelled of cherry and molasses, with a bit of alcohol. It had a well balanced flavor of cherry and hops and malt, creating an overall dark and complex flavor that lasted for a while. It was nicely thick and smooth with slight carbonation and slight alcohol warming. This is what I was hoping for from the Trappist monks. Overall it was powerful and delicious."
"d - I think I need to find out how to store beers for long periods of time properly. This one aged almost a year, but I am not too impressed. I was expecting this to be much more then it was. I will have to give this another shot."
"Pours almost black and completely opaque with one finger of light tan head sitting on top. Aroma is fruity, dark ripe fruits and sweet malty tones. Taste is delicious. Dark fruits, caramel, toffee, spices, and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with excellent carbonation. Drinkability is moderate. Easy to consume due to great flavors, but higher alcohol limits consumption."
"A world classic."
"Not for the faint of heart."
"D - I like plenty of boozy beers, but the aftertaste on this is dragging it down for me. Just a bit too hot. Overall not bad, but there's nothing wowing me in the flavor profile to make me want to lay a few down to quell the heat. It's been a bit since I've had it but I think i prefer the St. Bernardus 12"
"D - For it's potency, this is an amazingly easy brew to consume. Simply outstanding, stop reading these reviews and go try one!"
"D: as others have said, very much like the ""8", but stronger and deeper, almost more of an earthy quality, the Rocheforts are still the best Belgians I have had in my opinion"
"An all-time favourite, it never fails to satisfy and amaze me. Incredibly drinkable for such a big beer, I don't have to take my time with this one quite like I do with say a Samichlaus or Expedition Stout. Delicious."
"Prosit, MK"
"Similar to the Rochefort 8, but a bit more subtle (and stronger). One of my favorites; highly recommended!"
"This was the beer that got me into drinking Belgian beers. It you want a great Belgian beer and you do not have access to a Westvleteren 12 you should drink this beer because it is a great beer and you will not be missing much. I may be out of line but I think this beer is as good as a Westie."
"D: One of my favorite Belgian beers of any style. It's been quite a while since I've tried this one, and at $6-7/bottle it's not cheap (oh, how I lament seeing those 4-packs in Belgium for under 4); but it's remarkably good and certainly 'easy to drink'. At any cost, it's a world-class beer worth seeking out."
"A classic. Enjoy."
"D:The hotness of this brew is slightly off putting but disapears once you let it warm up a bit. Once that happens it is a very good beer. The caramel sweetness makes it a nice balanced beer"
"Very nice brown colour. Flavour with burned carame and well balanced between sweet and bitter (is maybe to the sweet side). Lovely alcoholic bite. Sweet, alcohol and slightly bitter finish. Full bodied. My favourite trappist beer also compared to Westvleteren 12."
"It's below freezing outside, and this beer really hits the spot! A very well balanced and amazingly tasty beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. The beer is complex and plays the part of the sipping beer very well."
"Beer is the great think humans has discovered!!!"
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic quad and it's uniquely roasty for the style without deviating too far from the style guidelines. Quaffability suffers as the alcohol becomes very noticeable at the finish as the beer warms, but it does contributed positive characteristics to the taste. Fantastic beer overall. Well worth a try."
"D-Amazingly smooth, and delicious. I'd like to try aging a few bottles to see the result."
"The alcohol burn is a bit much right now. The bottle is only about 4 months old. Toned down this would be much more drinkable. As it stands now, it's a very good beer. I'll have to grab a few more and hang onto them for a few years to see what happens."
"D - This is a wonderful treat. I remember once seeing a table a Hopleaf where three guys were ordering round after round of this beer. At $10 a bottle I was shocked, and after drinking it I still can't say I would do it, but I do have to say it would be hard for too many other beers to compete with this balanced and complex offering."
"The nose is musty and earthy. Not particularly pleasant. It mellows as it warms with a whiff of gouda cheese. Taste is anice from black licorice and slightly peppery. Alcohol becomes evident in the finish. One of the highest ranked beers in BA, yet I question why. Not sure why the disconnect, but the brew is too uninspired for my taste."
"D: With all that flavor it's a sipper with or without the 11.3% abv. It's a damn fine sipper - but the alcohol is a bit much for me, which, I suppose, is why I prefer the 8 (which is one of my favorites)."
"Been holding onto this bottle for a little while and finally decided to pop it tonight, tasted a lot like a Westvleteren 12 and definitely much cheaper for us in the states, plan on aging other bottles for a significant amount of time, one of the best quadrupels I have ever tasted, plan on drinking the 6 and 8 soon to compare them to the other trappist beers, but this one measured up nicely, definitely deserves to be in the top twenty beers on this site, recommended"
"Pours black with with a deep red tint to it. The head is a 2 finger+ that lingers for a very long time and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It is frothy and beautiful. The aroma is of sweet cherries, dark fruits, alcohol, and malt. I smell no hops. The taste is very well balanced and very complex. The initial taste has a lot of sweet malt and lots of alcohol. The alcohol continues to play on my tongue while the a slight hop bitterness balances the sweetness nicely. The grape/cherry flavor is in the finish and is very sweet. The mouthfeel is excellent and the beer is very well carbonated. The beer is pretty damn drinkable for the high abv."
"Drinkability: It's the fullest-bodied Trappist I've had thus far. And it's absolutely delicious. It's worth every bit of the $8/bottle, so sip slowly and savor. I love Belgium."
"A great warming beer for a cold winter day. Very nice."
"I will pick this up whenever I have a chance."
"Beer poured a deep, dense brown color with a half inch thick tan head into my Orval glass. The head receeded to a nice ring on the edge by the time I sat down to admire my beer. The beer had an aroma of toasted malt and caramel. The taste is malty sweet but hoppy and well balanced. The body is full of carbonation and the taste is slightly hot with alcohol but this is a very well balanced and full bodied beer that lives up to its billing."
"This is wonderful, easy-drinking stuff that's not too heavy for the style. Incredible quadrupel!"
"After a long absence in this market I finally saw some more of this stuff, with a best before date of 10/14/12 which i assume means it was bottled in October of 2007. Pours a nearly opaque mahogany with a thick cola head. The aroma has some intense dark fruit notes upfront, along with some candied sugar sweetness, bread like yeastiness, some spices (corriander, cardamom, anise), and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with a big dark fruit (plum, grape, fig, blackberry) presence upfront, along with a burnt bread flavor, some spiciness (corriander and anise), a slight hint of floral hops, and a nice alcohol presence that isnt overwhelming. The mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation and drinkability is excellent for the style. Overall an excellent quad, drinkable and complex...hopefully this one isnt as scarce around here in the future."
"Excellent beer."
"Medium bodsy, with what I would call frothy carbonation. Very nice and warming."
"After 1 year: pours with lots of vigour and carbonation, looks about the same. The aroma hits you with the vanilla more pronounced than before, and the dusty cocoa bitterness coming out more as well. The licorice is REALLY coming out in the flavour, deep and herbal. More brilliant than even half a year ago."
"I love it and want some more... Now."
"This is an absolute treat for quad lovers. Not one I would want all the time, just because it is so massive. I think it is something you should treat yourself to at least once a year."
"Drinkability is hampered by the high alcohol content and the need to sip very slowly. Still drinkable, just requires some patience."
"This beer transports you straight to the old world. I got out the strongest cheese I could find in the fridge, some gorgonzola, paired the two together and just sat back and enjoyed it. Need to get working on planning that Belgian brewery tour."
"Trappistes Rochefort 10 is outstanding beer that is pretty close to as deep and as complex as they come. I didn't get that undefinable *magic* quality that I look for in the best of the best, but it's an amazingly libation all the same. It's also every bit the equal of Trappist Westvleteren 12."
"Truly exceptional."
"My third and final installment from Brasserie de Rochefort, and out of all three of their well-known beers, I must declare that my favorite was the # 8... Their 10 pours a wonderful deep, dark, brown, mahogany appearance with an immense foamy and frothy head... chestnut-hue was very attractive with a faint aroma of figs and prunes... the smell wasn't as strong as I was anticipating... the taste was very good for a Quadrupel, but in my opinion, somewhat bland compared to the 8... their was an apparent thickness and richness in the flavor, which manifested itself with a nutty, butter, caramel, dehydrated fruit taste... good creamy, rich, and thick mouthfeel led to a good drinkability... although the alcohol wasn't detectable, the 11.3% ABV does eventually become noticeable with a warming feeling that slowly sinks in... Overall, a very good beer, a good depiction of the style... Definitely recommended..."
"Decanted into a Rochefort goblet, the beer appears as a slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with deep crimson hues. A voluminous head emerges of a light sandy tan color that nearly spills over the rim of the goblet. An absolutely gorgeous beer in every way. The nose is an explosion of sweet tropical fruits (pear, banana, mango), some candy-like characteristics reminiscent of bubble gum and hard Christmas candy. Underpinning these notes, a solid caramelized malt base is evident. This is one of the most enjoyable beers to sniff you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying, without a doubt. The palate is a myriad of complex flavors that wholly embody the essence of what a Belgian strong dark ale ought to be. Roasted coconut, spicy banana and pear, subtle floral hops, and a wonderfully rich, warm alcohol presence. Some rich chocolate-like flavors add to the incredible complexity of this beer. The mouth feel is no more than medium and not cloying in the least, even with the aggressive sweet candi and fruit elements. This beer contains a good amount of carbonation, leaving the finish clean and rather dry with some residual alcohol warmth lingering long. This is, without a single doubt, one of the finest beers I've ever sampled regardless of style or origin. This beer is the pinnacle of the Trappist brewer's art, in my opinion. Nearly perfect, the much sought-after Westvleteren 12 really has nothing on this beer. If you want to taste Trappist brewing perfection, you really can't do any better than the best of the Rochefort beers, and one of the best in the world, Rochefort 10."
"Drinkability is in question, as this is a lovable and highly palatable beer, but the buzz, oh the buzz from the 11.3%abv."
"D: Excellent to sip at. I started the bottle with a clean palate, for the sake of review. Being hungry, though, after half a bottle I paired it with baguette spread with a Brunet goat cheese. This was absolutely excellent, bring out some of the tangy sweetness in the ale. A wonderful abbey-ale, and something special to keep away for a special occasion or when the Westy is unavailable (like here!)"
"This thing is very good. The carbonation has died down a bit, and now there is some dark cherry notes coming through as well. This is a world class brew. I'm going to have to stock up and age a few of these."
"Overall a very drinkable Quad, a good introduction into really good Belgians."
"This beer is phenomenal I am still totally in awe of it....wish I could have another right now."
"Geez...I'm still in awe of this beer...from now on when I purchase the Rocheforts, it will be the 10 an nothing else..this beer is godly."
"This is a fantastic beer, lives up to its reputation. Fan-friggin-tastic. The best of the Trappists that i've had and its hard to imagine that the Westy 12 could be better than this."
"The bottom line: If you like Belgians, the Rochefort beers are must tries. I greatly enjoy both the 8 and the 10 and 10 is the biggest beer in their impressive arsenal. It loses a bit as it warms, which is unusual for the style though, as the alcohol becomes more noticeable."
"Thinner-bodied, as is typical of most belgian brews. Easy to drink one too fast, because at 11+%, this deserves respectful sipping."
"That alcohol hits me about half way through. The carbonation is very lively on the tongue. I must say this beer just made my day, I'd choose this over many other dark Belgians, except for Rochefort 8."
"Overall, well worth the money, and well worth the hype."
"D: A delicious night cap sipper. I'm glad this is readily available in my area but $6 a pop is a bit steep for more than an occasional treat."
"Near perfect example of style. Complexities grow as it warms. Ages well for many years."
"World class!"
"D= an absolute requirement for ultimate sainthood, but then again in reverently-savored smaller quantity."
"A wonderful experience and one I'll be sure to repeat."
"Drinkability: A sipping beer, a reminiscence beer. This beer always leaves a wonderful warm feeling in my tummy. The best beer I have tasted."
"Yep, this is my favorite Belgian so far. By a long way. The alcohol is very prevalent so this is a sipper but this is actually one Belgian that I will get again and enjoy again."
"Overall- While it is complex, I feel that it is not AS complex as I imagined. I am going to age the other one I have for a while and revisit this brew. Nice brew though; it is obvious why it is rated so highly. Sticks to the style and represents it very well."
"d: Thanks to my buddy Scott for splitting this with me. They aren't cheap but I just might have to get some more of these."
"Good sipping drinkability. Excellent example of a Quad. Glad I found this."
"This beer is a an opaque brown with a beautiful creamy head that subsides to a laceing. The beer smells of toasty roasty chocolate and crystal malt and tastes very similar. The taste is smooth with creamy roasted malt finish. A caramel flavor with Belgium yeastyness is noticeable. The mouthfeel is soft with a smooth maltyness, light medium body and delicate carbonation. Wonderful taste but alcohol is present, although an important part of the complex balance of flavors, making it less drinkable. Damn good beer."
"At $7/bottle, you expect the moon and receive the galaxy. This is eons better than the 8 which is one of my favorites."
"Overall: You can't go wrong with this one. Lots of flavours blended in & as it warms, it's even better. My only complaint is that i didn't have more! A must for Belgian lovers."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with quite a bit of head that recedes fairly quickly. Smell is of a thick sweet malt. Taste is extremely sweet. The flavor drops off a bit quickly...but not drastically so. It stays on your tongue for a while and you get a alcohol taste that disappears before all the flavor does as well. Mouthfeel is not as thick as I would expect. Drinkability is high. Though you will feel this one fast."
" Taste wasrich with caramel and some berries. The smell was sweeter than than the taste. Again, this beer was very hot(fusels). I think I actually detected some hop bite in the mouth which would lose it points with BJCP folks, but again this is a product of its age, not the true potential of this magnificent beer. Not that this is incredibly surprising to any one, but buy this and try after a year or more, otherwise you are in for an adoloescent beer experience. Beer brewed in 07'. Cheers."
"Very drinkable, as I found myself wishing I had more at the end. The 11.3% ABV was very well hidden (I would have guessed 8%), though I could feel it at the end. The best beer I've had in a long time, and certainly in the top 5 or so all-time."
"A classic."
"Drinkability  This one is defiantly a sipper. I sat on this bottle for awhile until I finally broke down. Well worth the wait though. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on one or several of these. Words cannot begin to explain this beer, so you will just have to see for yourself."
"Review 100! Poured into chalice, pours the darkest shade of brown you can imagine, all but pure black. Thick, really thick, off-white and creamy head with great retention and lacing. The overall look in the cup is amazing. Smell is good but a little too much alcohol in it, but I guess thats to be expected with such a high ABV. Also some chocoalte, roasted grain, raisin, and touch of rum in the smell. Taste is wonderfully complex. Tingles at first and then lead to a nice caramel and chocolate taste on the tounge and leaves a raisin like warming sensation as it goes down. The first sip was amazing I must say. As it warms I started noticing more alcohol and some sweet sugar. I would say mouthfeel is medium with a nice aftertaste and somewhat thick presence left behind. Drinkability I can only give a 3.5 due to the cost and high ABV. Overall a tremendous beer, while not my highest rated beer of the first 100, its probably in the top 10, just as it is in the Top 100 list. Enjoy this beer slowly."
"Overall, a very fine beer with lots of complexity and nice balance."
"First off, Take your bottle and roll it on your table gently so the yeast that settled on the bottom of the bottle lifts off the bottom and intrudes the rest of the bottle. Pours a nice brownish/red with a massive amount of yeast. (awesome) Smell is fruity like cherries and other dark fruits. Taste is definately almost a wine. Class is close to a barleywine in my opinion. Very sweet though with little to no noticeable hops to finish off the palate. A very different type than I'm used to, but I very much appreciate the craftsmanship put into this superb brew. Very pleasant and light. A very drinkable but sipper of a brew. Elegance at it's best."
"I let this one age in the bottle for about a month. I read somewhere that the monastery that produces this fine beverage puts it in the bottle right after fermentation, so I didn't want to review it being so ""green"". The beer poured into my Chimay goblet had a dense, dark brown color. The head that sat atop the brew was a soft, pillowy white. The aroma had a lot of fruity esters resembling raisins. There was a slight hint of sour in the aroma as well. The scent of toasted grains comes through nicely. The alcohol was definitely present in the aroma, but it had a sweet, belgian candi sugar quality that made it pleasant. There was no hop aroma. The flavor was a very intense maltiness. The flavor of dark, dried fruits was barely present. There was a great alcohol warmth with every sip, coupled with the carbonation, giving the beer a great mouthfeel. There were really no hop flavors that I could detect. The beer finished very dry, leaving a bread-like feel in your mouth. This was a very, very good beer. As to be expected from the Trappists. My only suggestion would be to age this beer longer, two or more years perhaps."
"D - Too strong to have many of, but very enjoyable by the bottle (or even two)."
"this beer is a gem. It pours dark brown with lots of yeast. The nose is very spicy, almost vinous and with dark fruits. The taste is of dark dried fruit with an intense abbey taste. great sugary residue on the finish. refreshing and smooth this is a belgian classic! I would love it if it were just a bit cheaper, the 8 is also fantastic, maybe better. Man I love these monks and their eat off the floor clean brewery."
"Medium-full in body, incredibly smooth and so creamy. Very luscious mouthfeel. Way to drinkable for a sip and savor beer. This will knock you down before you know it. Excellent."
"Overall: Very complex and well balanced one. It is too alcoholic for my taste."
"I am going to be honest here.... I really tried to find all the little nuances in the Rochefort 10.. and I feel like I did a good job.. but I can't with a good conscience rate it that high. There is something in the back of my mind that is telling me it needed a gentle touch more maltiness/sweetness to tie everything together... don't get me wrong, to this point, this is my most highly rated beer, but I still think it needs more. Every time I've had this brew, I've put it up against another quad (or 4)... but every time, I've found things I ""really"" appreciate about the other quads that the ""10"" just does not have... but still, Tonight.... I am reviewing my highest rated beer to date."
"11.3% will get you stupid, but other than that this beer sits perfectly on your stomach. Sip and savor."
"This is one of those rare beer experiences that really lives up to expectations. This one completely blew me away, what a great beer. Cant wait to get some more and try at different ages. Really a well made drink in every form."
"A great beer. One of the best most complex and interesting beers I have had. Buy this beer just to smell it and the taste isn't bad either."
"Amazingly full body, real thick in the glass and in the mouth. One of the closest things to perfect that I have had."
"This is a beers beer!"
"Pours an opaque dark tea color with a huge stiff off tan head that resists fading in rocky patterns and leaves 3D lacing in its wake. The smell is nice; earthy Belgian yeast and dark fruits. Nicely carbonated the tiny bubbles of effervescence lend a creamy texture to the mouth feel. Full bodied, with a tingle of alcohol that adds nicely to the complexity, the 11.3% is well integrated. The earthy malt, raison and yeast flavors are more subtle than you would expect from a beverage with such a high ABV. Highly recommended."
"D- I really enjoy this brew but with 11.2% alcohol if I drank this all night it would be a short night. Nice complexity of flavor."
"I have not yet tasted a better balance augmented by such complex aromas and will have to revise my review of Chimay (Blue, which I really like a lot). This is better."
"Wow is probably the best word to describe this. Poured this from a brown bottle into my tulip glass. Looks a lot like cola, though has a thin head that dissipates, but leaves marks on top that look like cirrus clouds. Quite beautiful to watch, actually. Smells dreamy of sugars, fruits, spices. Absolutely wonderful. However, the smell was just a warm up for the taste that followed. Delicious Mediterranean fruits, such as plums, figs, and raisins make appearances. Not a trace of bitterness. Was absolutely perfect paired with bleu cheese. One of the most rewarding experiences I've had in beer drinking. There's no way I won't have this again."
"Poured a 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark brown with a 2 inch head, left very little lacing. Aroma is of figs, vanilla and other dark fruits. Taste is figs and candied fruits. Sweetness is a bit sugary at the tail of the taste. Also there is a bit of an alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. With such a high ABV it can definitely catch up with you pretty quickly."
"Bottom line: I've spent some time in Belgium and this is my least favorite Quad. I greatly respect the brewers, but I disagree with the high marks of this one. I might be the only one... Pours like coca-cola into a glass. Has about 1/8 inch of head that quickly dissipates. The smell is average for Quads: vanilla, hint of coca-cola (yep, I'm crazy), and figs. The taste is heavy for a quad. Definitely not on the sweet side: vanilla, some nuts, and then a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is great. Feels like heavy cream. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a murky cola brown, cloudy, a good size light tan head recedes slowly. Aroma is large dose of caramel malt sweetness, some, raisins, apples, and alcohol soaked sponge cake. Hints of chocolate and ginger are evident in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a nice chocolate, vanilla, and caramel, nutty dessert bread flavor, nice and yeasty, some apple flavor before a biting alcohol warms and drys the throat in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a peppery effervescence of carbonation tingles on the tongue and builds to a foam in the mouth. Definitely one of the best quads I've tasted, perhaps not my personal top but right up there. Alcohol comes on strong at first but gradually the bite dulls, nice and dry, very enjoyable."
"Poured from 33cl brown bottle into A Westmalle chalice. Poured a murky blood brown with little particles of yeast that escaped the bottle. Smell of dried fruit mixed with a sweet malty aroma thats carmel bread. Taste of raisins, cherries, some candi sugar, and a alcohol finish that was almost ethereal. While the flavors are bold and refined they still cannot make 11.3% abv not get you hammered pretty quickly."
"This beer is excellent as a ""stand-alone"" experience, and I am sure that it will ""stand-up"" to just about any flavor you decide to pair with it."
"Overall this is a very good quad. Tasted side by side with a westy and definately liked the westy better. That said this is a great beer and easier to get."
"Overall: This is a quality product. The taste profile is very complex and I am certain that I would pick up some different flavors if I tried it again. Trying it again is a must for me."
"D: Drinkability is fantastic for a beer of such power and complexity. Even at 11.3% alcohol, it carries great finesse, and I can't wait to take another sip. A very expensive beer and kind of hard to find here in late 2007, but a great buy for an occasional treat. It would make a great nightcap as well due to its warming power. All and all, a fantastic beer."
"D  Tasting the 6, 8 and 10 back to back the 10 is my favorite and does not taste as boozy as the 8 for the bigger abv."
"D: If this wasn't 8.99 for a 11.2 oz bottle I could drink this with freakish regularity. My GF said she actually preferred the 8 but I disagree. The 10 is the apex. The booze is there but hidden very carefully. There is a reason this beer is ranked so high."
"One of the best out there!"
"Cheers!"
"I am often amazed at the huge head produced by Belgium brews and this is no defferent. Foamy and thick at 3 tan fingers tall. Body is a perfect dark murky brown. Nose is huge with tones of sweet malt, over ripe bananas, dark zesty fruit and spicey pie crust. At first sip the amazing complexity of this beer just explodes on the tongue with a wonderful malty zest. Dark fruit and rich nuttiness balances well together. Spicey feel carries this beer and gels well with the even consistant sweetness. Alchol is completly well hidden. A Belgium classic that is way to easy to drink. Mouthfeel keeps with the zesty, spicey sweet feel."
"Pours a murky fig like brown with a big creamy head that takes forever to receed to a thin layer. Huge lacing throughout Smells of pears, dried fruit, fig, berries and a hint of banana. The multiple flavors in the scent present themselves in layers throughout the sip. Creamy in the mouth with a little medicinal finish as it warms. The nature of this brew is a sweet sipper but the ABV is very well hidden. Another classic Monkbrew."
"Drinkability : a must (noble and elegant) beer, in the style Trappist ."
"This is really that damn good. The monks got it right."
"Overall I found this beer was enjoyable but not thrilling. It was of good quality and fun to try, but I wont be going out of my way to seek it out again. CHEERS!"
"I had mine on the toilet, it was wonderful.."
"Pours a deep burgundy color with white head and some sediment. Smell is full of malt and sweetness. The taste has hints of fruit, malt, candy with a hint of alcohol although it is well hidden. Mouth feel is a bit creamy. Truly one of the easiest drinking high alcohol beers. A true great."
"D- Big and wonderful. Could take several in a night."
"Pours a dark muddy brown carmel is the single most potent part of the nose (it prepares you for what's next), fantastic carmel flavor accented with a wee bit of chocolate and malty hoppiness, a little heavy but fits well, the finish is just great without over-powering a good cheese. My single most desired beer to date."
"bottle poured dark murky brown in my trappist glass it gave a nice tan head reduced to small amount of lace. Aroma's wonderfull fruit, malts and alcohol. Great full bodied thick mouthfeel .Well balanced flavors of fruits and spice. this ale hides it alcohol well . I will have to dink this one again"
"drinkability is great for a quadrupel. these brews are usually very high on alcoholic bite, but this one provides a presence of alcohol, while keeping it mild and subtle. very well crafted brew. cheers!"
"The taste, mouthfeel and drinkability ate superb. Notes of plums and other fruits, mild spicing and a warming alcohol that hides it self well. I am glad to say I have one more ( but for how long)."
"**I've had a chance to sample a few more bottles of this since my initial review. Really enjoy this brew. Wish it was just a bit cheaper."
"Drinkability is pretty low, not to knock the beer, but it's incredibly rich, strong, and generally expensive and hard to find. Your just not going to want to sit down and drink more then one or two of these in a sitting. In fact, I find myself really slowing down with this last 1/3, with the booze and astringency leaving a lingering harshness on the tongue and all the way down the throat, particularly tickling my uvula. Damn, I need to get back to Amsterdam!"
"Overall. This finished ahead of the rest, slightly above the Westy12, Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. The aroma and flavors were a little stronger in this one. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). I've had this with just the Abt 12 before and the Abt was better, but in this case this bottle was better. You'll have to see for you self, you won't be disappointed."
"D- This is overall a decent beer. Great complexity and mouthfeel but it isn't amazing like I thought it would be. I do like it but it is not one of my favorite brews and I was slightly disappointed by this. The big alcohol presence makes the drinkability average. This is borderline barleywine. I would have this one again but I am not in love with it."
"Drinkability- This is also a fantastic brew (like the 8) that can be enjoyed at anytime. Its so super drinkable it almost sucks that its over 11%. I think between the 8 and the 10 I like the 8 slightly more. It seems to have a bit more balance and is goes down a tad easier (which is saying a lot). They are both great beers and must be tried. I can see why this bad boy is currently #7 on the best of BA."
"D: This beer is strong. I'm half way through an eleven ounce bottle and my face is warm and I have a bit of buzz. But this is a really good beer and as it warms a few more flavors arrive. A good beer to sip on."
"D: This beer is fairly easy to come across for a trappist beer and is a wonderful substitute for Westvleteren 12, so I'd snatch up as many of these as you can. Very drinkable with most sit down meals."
"I don't know how successful I will be in ageing these."
"I think I prefer St. Bernardus 12 though."
"Wow what a pour. This beer doesn't look like it wants to be in my glass the huge billowing head rises four fingers above the cloudy mahogany colored liquid and that head isn't going anywhere any time soon. The smell is wonderfully complex, dominated by dark fruit from plums to raisins followed by more light fruit and pulled together by some phenols and alcohol spice. The taste is upfront prickly alcohol and peppery spice maybe a bit of hops but it seems to be mainly the alcohol. Incredibly warming but not ""hot"". Hidden beneath the alcohol is an incredibly full maltiness which suggests of dark bread. The fruit stays in there but it isn't as noticeable as it is in the nose overall the flavor is amazingly vinous, on taste I would take this over that $100 bottle of wine any day. The warming tingly yet deliciously smooth mouthfeel is pretty wild, not too light not too heavy just dead on. OK it's not a session beer but damn this is a treat worth every cent. Let me admit that I was a bit skeptical about this beers very high rating and wondered how much of it was hype. Let me tell you that after drinking one myself, I've become a true believer. Rochefort 10 is the real deal give it a try and you wont be disappointed."
"Enjoyed out of my Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass. Pours a deep chestnut brown, slightly hazy with a rocky 2 finger head. Head is a creamy tan brown, short lasting and fizzy, with lots of lacing. Aroma is strong roasted malts with a definite alcohol presence. Lots of raisins. Tastes very malty with hints of caramel and vanilla. Lots of roasted malts with a nice balance of hoppy bitterness. Hops are not overpowering at all; very subdued. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a pleasant carbonated bite. Not heavy on the tongue. Overall, an excellent beer. I can easily enjoy 2 of these brews, but due to the high alcohol (and high price) I can't take much more than that."
"M: Creamy, rich, full, perfect."
"Pours a deep, dark burnt sienna with a light brown highlights and a solid three fingers of tan head with some brown spots on the fairly bit bubbles. Head ends up with a finger of thick froth. Lots of chunks floating around in there. Looks excellent. Nose of strong dried fruit, spices, molasses. Lots of cookies. Very light hoppy grapefruit. Incredible flavor. First cookies and chocolate, like the nose. Spicy alcohol in the middle. Almost no hop character. Strong raisins, cranberries, and other dried fruit in the middle. Alcohol comes back through the nose after a little bit. Fulll, creamy body; amazing, only topped by the 8. This one's amazing, with the only slight problem being the light alcohol presence throughout the beer (kind of tough to hide a full 11% ABV, so I won't fault them much). Delicious."
"Pours a deep dark cola brown color. Very light tan head, medium head retention. Mild aroma. Slightly oakey and sweet. A hint of non citrus fruityness. Flavor is somewhat oakey, with a belgian sour. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy , light to medium body. Very lightly drying. Drinkability is high. Good flavor, decent mouthfeel. Certainly wouldn't mind another one after this, if i had had the foresight to pick up a 2nd bottle! Argh!"
"Overall - Sad as it may sound, this beer is pretty similar to St. Bernardus Abt 12, but the sugar in Abt 12 gives it a great caramel character that the Rochefort is lacking. This is the only reason why I prefer Abt 12. However, this is still a must-try beer, and I certainly do not regret dishing out $10 Australian for the one bottle."
"Notes: FWIW, I paid $5.99 for the bottle. I refrigerated it a couple months ago to hoist in celebration of a new job I began in July. Finally got a chance to enjoy it last night, so I hoisted this top-notch Belgian in celebration of my new job as well as in the memory of Michael Jackson. A beer certainly worthy of toasting with. . . ."
"I was real excited to try this one. I was a bit disappointed. This just was too alcoholic for me. It was good. But was it $7 good? I'm not so sure."
"Dark chestnut brown color and a fizzy beige soda pop like head that reduces quickly but does keep a thick ring and surface layer. The nose displays wonderful aromas of dark fruits of raison and berries, firm malty, carob base, and banana. The first sip reveals some roasted malts and earthiness up front and ending with a hoppy bitterness and citric balance. Burnt brown sugar sweetness, anise, nutty malts, and aspartame shows up as it warms. The finish is long with notes of chary, hazelnut, nutty malt, and faint espresso. The alcohol burn is moderate for a 11.3, but this would make it a gem after some aging. Good crisp carbonation with a thin mouthfeel that is really good but was hoping for something a little chewier."
"Pours a dark opaque brown with a tan head. Aromas of a malty sweetness, alcohol and a coffee/ molasses presence. In the taste, a malty alcohol flavor and molasses charicteristic. Also, a dry end. A sweet alcoholic mouthfeel and a sweet molasses aftertaste. Even though, alcohol is there it hides it well, and great flavors overall."
"drinkability is good. slightly warm, but very nice. mostly balanced. good stuff."
"D - This beer is one to savor and share. The overall impression is of a heavy, flavorfull, cigar like beer. I was surprised that it retained so much carbonation after 2.5 years. It was starting to get a bit autolyzed, so I don't think I would age it any longer than this."
"Drinkability  This defines creamy Belgian Ale. Its just beautiful to hold in the mouth and the flavors will keep you busy all night long. What a treat."
"Overall a stunning force of brewing nature this one is. Like a deep and wide river; quiet and still on the surface, yet powerful and tumultuous underneath. This beer is holy."
"D: One of the worlds best, with good reason. Wow!"
"The drinkability is quite nice. The 11.3% abv is melded nicely with the taste."
"If there exists on Earth a finer beer, I'm not sure my heart could handle it. By my best reckoning this is absolutely perfect."
"Still... Wow!"
"Poured slowly into a tulip glass and it almost overflowed with head from the 11.2 oz. bottle. Very dark brown with active carbonation and thick bubbly off-white head that leaves nearly continuous lace up the glass as the head slowly dissipated. Smells of roasted malts and straw with a slightly alcoholic nose. Sweet grainy malt IF with long-lived slightly sweet aftertaste that picks up some bitterness with time. Full bodied with slightly dry texture, a little fizzy and clearly alcoholic finish. This is a tasty beer that is not as amazing as I was expecting considering the high cost of a small bottle. The flavor is not terribly complex compared to some others that I have tried in this style. The alcohol really comes through in the smell, flavor, and finish to the point of being a little too dominant."
"Drinkability: This is simply a amazing drink that one could surely enjoy but the high alcohol amount makes it hard to have to many in a night. But damn if you wouldn't try"
"This is the best quad (and one of the best beers) I have had the pleasure of drinking thus far. This is worth seeking out, even if you have to cross state lines in order to find it. An incredible brew."
"Overall, it's a good sipping Beer. I prefer the Rochefort 8 though."
"Having had and loved both this and the Rochefort 8. I am left wondering just how good the Rochefort 6 must be."
"D- Excellent brew and fairly drinkable. The 11.3% alcohol by volume certainly makes it much less drinkable than session brews but for higher alcohol beer it is pretty easy to drink other than the fact that the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked very well."
"Eric"
"Overall, awesome beer. Next to a Westy this is my favorite beer (in terms of cost per unit of enjoyment it out ranks even a Westy!). I keep it stocked for nights when I want to transport back to a cool spring evening in Belgium or overcome the pits and pratfalls of living in a country that cant produce beer anywhere near as well as a gaggle of Trappist monks in a land far away."
"Overall, one amazing brew! If this isn't my favorite, it is in my top three without a doubt. Highly recommended!"
"This is the best beer that I've ever had. I just wish I had a bigger bottle."
"poured a dark brown with hints of ruby in the light. huge head turns into a nice foam with a little lace. not as musty or strong a smell as i was expecting, but gorgeous nontheless. sweet bread, chocolate, cherries, booze, dried fruit. to me, it tastes like an ice cream sundae made with booze and a cherry on top. silky mouthfeel. nice carbonation. pleasure drink."
"D--Heavy freaking duty but so good. I get the impression that more than one of these could really put a hurting on you but I think I would be willing to try. This is probably the best beer I have ever had. I am totally impressed."
"Tasted with Bernardus ABT 12. It pours medium- dark brown with moderate head. Not as full-bodied as the Bernardus, it has darker, roasted nut aromas and a more crisp finish. The flavors are more intense with walnut and raisin flavors. The finish is long, with and elegance that makes it imminently drinkable."
"D: Wasn't sure what to expect, as I've tried the 6 and 8, but didn't want to hold the 10 to any unwarranted hype or scrutiny. Overall, a very tasty Belgian Quad, and a good choice when in the mood for a sweet and malty option that has a kick of complexity."
"Overall, tasty and enjoyable."
"I have had the pleasure to enjoy bottles I purchased in the US and Belgium. While it is common to cellar this big Belgian brew I must say that the fresher Belgium bought counterpart is superior as it lacks the oxidation that I feel detracts from the rich flavors of the quadruple. Wherever you buy it from it pours a dark mahogany with a hint of ruby on the edges. The head is not exactly consistent with some I have dissipating quickly while others lingering for a whileeither way, it is a slightly dark tan. This is one of those rare brews that show the best of beer can hold its own against the complexities of fine wine. You will certainly notice the strong molasses sugar notes from the candy sugars used in brewing. Plums, black cherry, leather, raisins and hints of roasted malts play on the tongue. The alcohol will not miss the senses as its flavor blends into the overall character and leaves the mouth and throat warm without burning in a pleasant balance that lets you know you are drinking something substantial and brewed with the alcohol balance only mastery of brewing accomplishes."
"Off white fluffy head and one finger worth of it.Deep red body.I smell nuts and some dark fruits.The first taste is very nutty and sorda fruity and the carbonation is very attacking.Points come off for that.Almost like soda carbonation.Creamy head that falls to a huge patch in the center of my goblet.Nice lacing left on the sides of my glass.This beer taste amazing.The booze is starting to take over...Im glad I dont get a chance to try an amazing beer like this all the time cause it would ruin the fun of drinking this kind of special beer.You can taste the booze in this,being 11+ abv I would think it would be evident.I wanna drink all of this quick but im pacing myself,its amazing.Could the nut taste be the yeast? If not,it really adds character to this beer.Did I mention this beer is amazing? haha I reccomend everyone to try this beer.Thank you Monks for this awesome Monk juice!"
"Overall: This was the most memorable beer I drank on my trip to Europe. Definately the most flavourful out of the Trappists I got to try(5/6 breweries ain't bad...Dangit Westveletren!!)."
"Drinkability - I'm not real big on Beliums, so I won't dog this, but it ain't for me. If your into Belgians, definately try it."
"No doubting this is an excellent Quadrupel, but I did not enjoy this as much as I have before, perhaps because I drank it a little to quickly and should have paid more respect. It was far more enjoyable once I got out some blue vein cheese to go with it. Probably the best beer I have yet to sample, would have scored higher were it not so alcoholic."
"This beer's red-brown color was rather appealing and was accompanied by a light sour and dried black cherry aroma. This beer was a fairly ideal blend of grapey character and dark dry roastiness. This beer finishes dry and clean in the mouth, although it is a bit boozy. Very good."
"Pours from a bottle a murky dark brown and leaves a few yeast particles floating around with a thick tan head that clings to the glass. The aroma is dark pitted fruit, rum raisin, candied fruit, brown sugar, spicy, bready aroma. The taste starts spicy, herbal in nature, a bit sour, dry, fruity, with a warming alcohal finish. Overall a good beer but not worth the price tag of $7/12oz bottle."
"Bread and dark fruit dominate the aroma. Raisins and plums mostly and the taste presents caramel and those fruit tones and fresh bread again. Man, trappist monks have got it down! Rochefort 10 is very smooth and thick, almost silky as I sip it. And it's smoothness grows as it warms to room temperature. I would love to sit and go through a bunch of these, but this is one of those that demands more respect than that. One of the best for sure, but not to be over-consumed. Awesome, awesome beer!!!!"
"I tried this beer on July 12, 2007 at 'The Beer Bistro' in Toronto. Unfortunately I can't rate it as high as the St. Bernardus Abt 12 I had last night. Maybe had I tried them in the reverse order things may have been different. Anyway, this poured a dark reddish-brown with a small head (the first contrast with SS). The head disappeared rather quickly. The aroma was very similar with robust bread and malt tones as well as plums. It felt great on the tongue with a full-bodied feel. As for the taste, I'm not sure where it failed when compared to the SB, but it just failed to measure up. Possibly the higher alcohol content which I noticed more in this brew."
"It feel great on the mouth, not a hard taste, this is a beer to be enjoy , when you open the bottle you will hope it will never end,will be great with salty food,cheese."
"A damn solid beer all the way around. It is strong in alcohol prescence, but not overbearing, and the silky mouthfeel I have come accustomed to in Belgian ales was definitely there. I had a bottle last night (7/5/07) and it was just as good as the first time I tried it. I used to only be able to get this beer when I went home to the Bay Area, but with the opening of the BevMo in San Luis Obispo, I have plenty of access to this beer, and I can't wait to get more. Definitel recommended."
"Second time dipping into this brew, remember it fondly the first time, so I hope it stacks up to memory. Pours a deep, dark brown, near black with a creamy head that laces the glass. Brown sugar is the most dominant aroma, with hints of some dark fruits like raisins and a bit of molasses as well. Taste is semi-sweet with pear, plums and port dominating the palate, also a little black cherry. It's a complex beer that goes down smooth with a bit of alcohol to warm you, but not as much as you would expect. All in all, a fantastic brew, a sipper, but a definite treat. I wouldn't get this every day, but it's a one-in-a-while brew."
"I want to give this a perfect rating so badly, but I don't think I will ever do that. All I can do at this point is to thank God for creating Trappist monks, and for allowing them to share with us a taste of heaven here on earth."
"D- this beer is amazing! i could drink this beer all the time if it were a bit cheaper. definitley try this beer if you havent yet."
"The difference between these three beers is marginal at best. Once again god bless the monks, and enjoy the beer! If you are lucky enough to consume any on the list above you have been anointed."
"A very good Trappist. Fruity, sweet (but not too sweet) with a hint of sourness on the back end - but not so much that it's a bad thing. Definitely drinkable. If I see this one sitting on a shelf, I'll probably pick it up again although I wouldn't drive across town to get it."
"From my notes 6/2/2007 pours a two-finger light tan head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Black color. Caramel nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is caramel and some alcohol, warming, clean finish. Poured from 330ml bottle at 'T Toreke restaurant Antwerp, Belgium. 2.80 ($3.84) best by Sep 27, 2011."
"Rocheforts would be a thicker body and maybe a tad bit of sweetness more."
"This beer is exceptional in all aspects except one - drinkability. Because of the 11.3% ABV, you can really only have one. Aside from that, this beer is fantastic."
"An excellent example of a strong trappist ale. In my area its so expensive at around $8 per 11.2oz bottle that its only a rare treat, but one that everyone should have at least once."
"Final Thoughts: First off I would like to thank God and the monks for making this available to me anytime I want one. This is a truly fantastic beer that has monster signature flavors and aromas that are sure to please."
"Drinkability: One of the best beers I've had in a while and fantastic pairing with a nice peppery steak would pick up again"
"D: Overall a good beer but it is not all that I thought it would be. Worth a try."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel that is some how light and airy at the same time. Carbonation is perfect for the style. Complex, flavorful, and extremly digestable, this is a top notch beer that every beer enthusiast should try at least once. One of my all time favorites."
"Wonderfully complex, both in the aroma and in the taste, it seems to change a little bit every degree it warms. If this wasn't so costly in the states, I'd buy it by the case. The high ABV is so cleverly hidden, it sneaks up on you, so sip this one and savor each one."
"Feels creamy on the mouth and not as heavy as you would expect. Such a delightful beer, definitely not one you would want to drink all night though due to the high ABV."
"The appearance was a typical Trappist quad, muddy brown with a red tint. The aroma held hints of citrus and was almost milky and cola-like. The flavor was very mellow, almost like a sweet old ale. It feels creamier than the Bernardus, though I unfortunately can't compare it to the Westlveteren yet. There's a little banana with the subtle fruit malt flavors. Like the other quads, this isn't the boldest beer. But despite the alcohol, it's oh-so drinkable if you can afford it."
"To the monks of Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy: Bravo!"
"D- It is pretty darn good. I would say (flavor wise) it is in between a Westys 12 and a St. Berny's 12. However for carbonation it leans a lot more towards Westy 12. Very good beer just a tad bit pricey IMO."
"I like this the more I get into it. At first I was slightly disappointed but now I'm loving the beer. I'd buy this again. I'd like to age it a few years to see how things pan out."
"D- Even though it's so complex, it's so good that it's highly enjoyable, and very drinkable."
"If there is anyplace this beer is lacking it is in appearance- It looked a nice brown with a cream 1 finger head that hung around--it had a good deal of what looked like pulp in it-- but I guess those are yeast flakes..never really noticed them in any beer before-anyway those made me not want to give it a higher rating for appearance... Then the perfection started - the smell on this top notch smells fruity - definitely grapes - tastes extremely complex there must be 10 different fruits but it took me a long time with many sips to place the main taste- I think it is figs- this has to be one of the best flavor blends I have ever tasted it is not to sweet, not to bitter, not to strong, not to light...this beer is hoppy and has a good amount of carbonation and gives a almost tongue numbing effect along with the alcohol heat--- the real story of this to me was how the alcohol on this one goes right to your head---even the tiniest 1st sip and you can feel it warm up your head like a shot of whiskey would- never felt that from a beer before not even a imp stout or barley wines with higher abv--at the same time the 11.3 abv doesn't effect the drinkability in the least--it just adds heat I felt no ""bite"" at all like some other reviewers said-maybe its just a different batch-- drinks more like a 5 or 6% I would say super drinkable- expense is the only reason I sipped it- These monks know their stuff- the beer even seemed to have have a bit of jolly blended into it to me.. best one Ive tried for sure. wish it was sold by the case instead of the bottle.."
"Trappistes Rochefort 10 pours a deep brown with a thick, creamy head that lingers for quite a while. Aroma is ripe fruit, chalky yeast and sweet malt. There is a sweet, almost flowery characteristic as well, not the typical floral hop aroma. Taste is amazing, dark fruit, esters, and sweet malts. The finish is sharp, with a hop bite. Alcohol is present, quite spicy and very warming. There is a strong yeast character in the aftertaste. This beer is so complex its hard to pull out all the individual flavors."
"A bit expensive, but well worth the experience."
"D - Overall this is truly the defination of a huge beer. This was really a big sipper and I struggled my way through it. It was very good, and massivly complex, however just too strong, and hot with the alcohol to truly be enjoyed right now."
"goes down a little rough, very hoppy but an overall smoothness to it that is not supassed by anything else. Mouth feel is strong and so is the after taste. definitely not a start out beer but one that deserves to be treated with respect and honor!"
"Overall my expectations were definitely met with this one...goes down as a great Belgian...."
"Drinkability is always subjective when it comes to such strong, and complex beers like Quadrupels. So, just take your time, and enjoy every little detail of this beer."
"M?D: not great, i like strong beers but not a fan of this beer to be honest. obviously im in the minority so give it a try to see what you think, maybe belgians just arent for me."
"Quite a decent beer but you have to be ready for the quite strong alcohol taste. This is the only thing that would put me off drinking this on a semi-regular basis."
"Pours to a nice strong ""chocolate milkshake"" head, that slowly shrinks, but never disappears. The color is very dark amber with a bit of haze. Aromas of banana, alcohol, and caramel come through with a light undertone of brettomyces culture. The taste comes through to me as dark whole grain toast with some sweet, but very dark rum/molasses notes. I get a very strong yeasty flavor that I associate with homebrew. This beer is very dry, and very well carbonated. It will linger after each sip and reveal new sensations. For what it is, it is very well crafted, but I find it a bit too much for my tastes."
"I usually try to keep two of these in my cellar at all times."
"Highly recommended. A classic."
"Would like to try again."
"This one came to me from nathan15 in the BIF race. Thanks!"
"This is a big beer. It's well balanced, and when poured into a snifter, it presents a huge head with wonderful lacing. Dark, dark redish brown colour, full of mollases flavour, a bit of spice and fruit notes, with a delicate hop-tone to it. Perfect balance of carbonation which extends to the pleasant mouthfeel of this beer. Five stars for sure, highly recommended. Chris"
"Possibly my favorite Belgian beer. If you haven't had it yet, what are you waiting for?"
"The monks know their stuff. There's no doubt about that. I'm incredibly thankful that I was able to drink this tonight - especially since hearing that it's becoming harder and harder to find."
"Pours a thick syrupy dark dark dark brown, almost black. The head gets up to 1/4 inch with some good hard pouring towards the end. The head mostly goes away, but the lacing stays around and it's a good strong lacing. The smell is very sweet smelling and lots of dark fruit smell. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and the alcohol presence is noticeable, but not off putting. Flavors of candy sugar and sweet sweet plum greet you with a medium-full body. The mouthfeel is still smooth. Overall, this is a favorite friend of mine that I will have always."
"pulled out some aged Danish blue; none of them came close to overwhelming this quadrupel. Very impressive brew all the way around, must-try for a wide demographic of beer drinkers."
"The mouthfeel is full and smooth with a nice bite and an earthy pulp like quality than makes for a very enjoyable texture. It's hard to describe just how good this beer is: phenomenal. A must try."
"A very good quad, I could be able to drink a few, though the alcohol will get me. Nice and interesting balance."
"I was quite happy to come across this one. Poors a deep cloudy mahogany, with very little light passing through and a big almost soda like head. A sweet smell with spicy and banana tones. A very complex taste that I cant even pretend to understand with a pleasant bite of alcohol. This was worth the $6 I paid for it, and certainly one of the best I have ever had."
"The easiest of the trappist beers to find here, so why not drink one that's been cellared for a year? Pours a deep mahogany color with solid cream lacing, more brown with the end yeast sediment poured in the glass. Lots of plums, fruit, caramel, a bit hot (could cellar even longer to mellow out with no problem). Great smell as it warms. Worth the five bucks, no doubt."
"The beer pours a rich, thick, luxurious dark brown color, with excellent head retention and fabulous lacing. On the nose.... oh my, where to begin. Chocalate fudge, caramel, cherries and port all combine with Belgium spice to make one exotic, incredible aroma. On the palate... mmm... so rich, so smooth... satin and silk with a heavenly mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet, but is not the least bit cloying IMO. The flavors replicate the nose, with lots of cherries, caramel and chocolate. This beer is very rich and very long, with a very long, lingering finish. This beer is a real sipper, which only makes sense given the abv. (which is well disguised.... you would never guess the abv. is that high) However it's so rich and viscuous, there's no way to just gulp this down. An absolute taste treat.... easily one of the 5 best beers I've ever tried. Delicious."
"I'm afraid a lot of BA's are like me: They search thier beer stores for the newest and latest beers, and leave this one on the shelves. IMO this was a mistake. My favorite Trappist beer so far."
"Ya can't go wrong with this beer and if you enjoy triples/quadrupel, consider yourself fortunate any time you find it for sale."
"This is world-class for sure. I don't seem to remember the alcohol being this apparent the other time I tried it. Perhaps this could use some more time to sit."
"Pours a dark, fudgy brown color with a khaki head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass, and maintains itself in a thin cover over the liquid. Smells very rich -- chocolate, that familiar Rochefort yeast, and raw alcohol. Some faint fruit notes in the vein of figs or dates. On the palate, rich, malty mocha notes overlaid with figgy fruits, phenols and spice. The flavors are huge, refined, and are lent a boozy intensity by the raw alcohol that comes out in the mid-palate and burns through the finish. Mouthfeel is very full with alcohol, carbonation and smooth malts that are a huge step up in thickness from the Rochefort 6 and 8. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. All the different elements are in balance, and all those elements are compelling in and of themselves. Even aspects of the beer that are normally detractions, like the raw alcohol note, contribute here positively to the overall experience. Wow. What a beer."
"The drinkability is excellent. This beer is so smooth and easy to drink. It would be easy to drink tons of this."
"The appearance is a nice brown red color. Not much in the way of head. Sweet in the nose with some spice and maybe some fig/fruit. Lots of plum with an alcohol burn at the finish. I like the beer but I think it can be better. I will try it again but put some more age on it."
"Don't share this one. And don't drink it fast."
"Overall: Certainly a good beer and one of the better quadrupels i have had. Very smooth and easy to drink for the 11.3% a/c. That said, im not overly impress with this brew. I think the ridiculously high rating is a bit much and there are a lot more beers i would put ahead of it. Perhaps i just havent tasted enough beers."
"Served in a chalice, this beer pours a well carbonated head, with a pretty mahogany color topped by a latte colored foam. Aroma is fairly fruity. Taste is very interesting; fruity, raisins, but drier and slightly hoppier than expected. The strong alcohol creeps through, warming the palate. A good example of the style."
"Drinkability: It certainly has a story to tell as far as the flavor profile is concerned. I could sip this thing all night and discover nuance after nuance. Of course, after two of these, I'd also be discovering quite a loose tongue."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle that I shipped back from Denver since they left the Texas market. Label had a best by date in 2011. It was a cloudy dark brown with reddish tunes. The head was small but a constant carb stream kept a foam in the center throughout. The smell was heavy on plums and raisins. I saw someone describe it as port-like and would tend to agree. Was very sweet smelling and you could get hints of the ABV. The taste was also very sweet from start to finish with a little bitter at the end to tone down the sweet. The alcohol definitely comes thru in the taste but isn't too overpowering. Overall, it has a good taste and a 33cl bottle is more than enough. Anything more than that and I know the sweetness and high ABV would get to more. Pretty warm feeling as it is. Highly recommend you try it. I can see this as an annual treat for me. (4, RB, T, Y)"
"Purchased this brew in Indianapolis a year ago and forgot I put it in my cellar. Boy, am I glad I found this gem. Poured muddy brown with a tan head. The head was foamy and floating with yeast sediment. Great retention and sticky lacing left on glass. Taste as it smells, starts sweet, bold and rich in malt, dried fruit such as plums, prunes and raisins. Molasses and a strange hint of tobacco (copenhagen) in the medium. Finishing off with a bitter coffee scent and strong alcohol bite. Nice medium body with a creamy feel and lively carbonated that make easy to consume. Overall, I enjoyed this brew alot despite the tobacco scent and taste. Enjoy"
"Taste is of sweet malty notes and fruit with a touch of banana bread. The feel is smooth and subtle; you wouldn't know this thing has an 11.3% ABV without looking. An alcoholic note does pull through on the aftertaste as it warms, however, and it complements the taste. I could drink this all day if my wallet was thick enough. Hands down: a fantastic beer."
"The alcohol warms the tongue and otherwise this is a creamy and easy to sip beer; not too heavily-bodied, but definitely not too light either. All around, a wonderful beverage and one I can't wait to try again."
"Served at cellar temperature in a snifter. Poured a deep brownish color, with a little bit of floaties. About two inches of thick, frothy, off-white head formed. Excellent retention and generous amounts of lace left on the glass. Smelled strongly of alcohol, dried dark fruits ( raisin, plum) , mollasses. This had a hell of a nose on it. Tasted again of alcohol, more dried fruits, and maybe a hint of oxidation. Was smooth up front, with a somewhat bitter, warming alcohol finish. Very tasty. Plenty of carbonation and the alcohol really shines through despite the sweetness. Very well balanced without one overpowering flavor. Pretty drinkable solid brew. A must try in my opinion."
"There's good reason this beer is highly rated in it's style, it's a great beer."
"Earthy liquorous aroma, with coffee, some chocolate, and the usual suspects: plums, raisins...Mouth is delicious and very alcoholic, warm, chocolate, the usual suspects again, brandy... Vinous and velvety, both in aroma and in mouth, but without losing that kind of roughness or unrefined quality usual in many trappist beers. Did I tell it feels vey alcoholic?"
"Great tasting beer but the alcohol strength means one and out for me. The time spent on one is definitely quality time."
"Drinkability: Delicious without question, and well-rounded to be sure. Admirably lives up to its reputation. Among the world's finest."
"Bought a 6 pack in Belgium. Pours a dark brown with a nice head. The sweet aroma was awesome. Had a malty, fruity flavor. This is one of my favorite beers of all. I enjoyed this just as much as the Westy 12 and it's much cheaper. I need to stock up!!!"
"D - I would have this brew again in a heartbeat but at the price it might be a while"
"Drinkability: High, high, high."
"This is the third best quad Ive ever tried."
"-Oelergud"
"A thoroughly top-notch brew that's more than drinkable...sip it, enjoy it and respect it...Cheers!"
"The pour revealed a dissapointing head that was short lived, and wasn't the head I've come to expect with many Belgian Ale's. I did pour real slow and gentle because of past experiences with almost exploding Belgian Heads.The color is a brownish-red with yeast floating around. Complex aroma of sweet malts with fruity notes. Absolutely exceptional creamy mouthfeel for a beer this strong. Alcohol is well-hidden and has perfect carbonation with a great finish. This could be dangerous because of how easy it goes down. Finish has a dry moderate bitterness with a full body. Hops are tasted more and more with each sip thorughout half the beer. This is very drinkable and a beer not for amatuers. About 3/4 through and I'm feeling the effects of the 11.30 ABV already. This was bought at Town & Country Liquors in West Springfield,Mass. for $6.99/bottle. Overall excellent and lived up to it's reputation."
"Head-to-head with the 8 I'd give the nod to the weaker beer in appearance (subject to re-review), and to the stronger beer in mouthfeel. Hard to declare a winner in the nose and taste categories, and both are extremely drinkable."
"I poured this into a nice chalice and the dark ruby beer perfectly filled it with the thick foamy head just barely pushing up over the edge of the glass. The aroma was primarily a malty sweetness, with hints of prunes and other dark fruits. The mouthfeel on this is great though. It's very rich and creamy and just slides down my throat. Most of the taste is malt and a residual sweetness as you might expect. There are also some spicy phenolic notes and the slight bite of alcohol. Overall I like this beer a lot, but I might actually be more partial to the Rochefort 8 because there isn't as much of a bite to it."
"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured into a clean glass about 30 minutes later. Poured the color of root beer. Appears to be a little cloudy with some find brown sediment that settled out quickly. Nice creamy tan head that stuck around for a few minutes and left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet smelling with hints of cherries, oranges and vanilla. No real hop aroma. Medium carbonation and medium/full body. A little hint of alcohol in the taste and warming alcohol going down. Fairly well balanced with a little more malt than hops. Very nice taste. Tasted a little like a dry red wine."
"Fantastic despite the price."
"Drinkability: Not going to have more than one of these in a sitting. A beer for a cold night that needs a bit of warming. Sip on this bad boy and enjoy the flavors as the beer warms a bit. Tasty."
"Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown color with a mountainous fluffy beige head that coats the walls of the glass with webs of sticky lace as it slowly recedes. The nose is quite fruity with notes of apricot, pear, banana, apple, and star fruit. A bit of brown sugar, cinnamon, cake, and brandy round out the complex aroma. Taste begins sweet with dark malt and a bit of candied sugar followed by notes of fruitcake and cherry liqueur and a hint of cocoa. The texture is almost a perfect creamy smoothness. An immensely complex drink and one of the true gems of the beer world."
"I love this beer! Don't get to enjoy one as often as I should. Imagine if this was what we all knew as the standard for all beers to be based from. Matter of fact I might have to go buy one right now for me to enjoy later on. All of the characteristics of this beer put a smile on my face..."
"D: Great complex ale. I will enjoy many more of these in the future, but no more than one a session."
"Date of 05-04-11, 10:14, classic bottle. Into a St Bernardus tulip glass, pours a dark dark russet brown, a lovely foamy inch thick head, settling down to a nice foam, good lacing that dosnt' stick to the glass, very nice. Aroma is the strength here, just perfect. Dark fruits, sweet sugars, plum, spices, brandy, maybe a bit of bourbon, very deep, very complex, very enticing. Taste... it could use a year, but nearly perfect, with flavors mirroring the nose, a classic. The mouth is very nice, a subtle alcohol warming, man I really could have another, but drinking multiple bottles of Rochefort is simply dangerous, so I'll cellar my others. A classic, worth every penny."
"I've never had Westvleteren 12, but it must truly be great to be considered a peer (or a superior) to this beer."
"Drinkability isn't bad either. The alcohol is well hidden, so tolerance would seem to be the limiting factor here."
"Overall, I have many more of these in my cellar, and if this hasn't already peaked, or is past it's prime, I don't think I could comprehend this brew at it's zenith. Very well done, age has made this one a thing to worship."
"Served in a snifter, it pours brown with some ruby red tints and it has some sediment floating around the glass, along with a small tan head. This is a very good smelling beer, I can smell bananas, plums, molasses, brown sugar, toffee and chocolate. It tastes like dark fruit, bananas, molasses and a bit nutty. It starts off sweet, and then has a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good too, it's very easy to drink although the high ABV starts to catch up to me after a little while, but the alcohol isn't as noticable as you'd think it would be. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy it again."
"There have been plenty of Trappistes Rochefort 10 reviews here and they're all worth reading. All I can add is that when you experience this beer you immediately know that you've poured something special. It's world-class, perfect, and worthy of this rating. You will not be disappointed."
"Pours into a snifter with the appearance of unfiltered, dark, clover honey. The lingering substantial head was light brown, almost burnt orange in some lights. Said to be one of the strongest beers in Belgium, I could easily smell this beer for a hour...and enjoy every second of the strong banana bread nose with hints of malt and strawberry. An incredible combo of ripened banana and sweet malt warms you as it finishes remarkably with mild black pepper notes (Normally I might not be thrilled with a black pepper description, but the softness and complexity of the taste is fantastic). The mouth feel was heavy, as you might expect of a quad, but the smoothness throughout this huge beer is what solidifies it's ""5" status for me. Indicative of the style, flavorful cheeses thrive when paired with this beer. I enjoyed it with a plate of gorgonzola ravioli, using a fairly neutral butter herb sauce so the cheese shines through....of course one could pair it only with a little Port Salut cheese, and be in for a terrific night...Enjoy"
"Another high-quality Belgian brew, quite honestly the best I've ever had, but unfortunately at AUD $14 a stubby, I will have to reserve this one for very special occasions."
"Drinkability: Delicious as expected, more alcoholic than other Quadrupels I've tried, but tasty. This one just lets you know you can't drink too many of them."
"Absolutely outstanding strong Belgian ale."
"33cl brown bottle. Dark brown body with murky ruby-red highlights and about a half an inch of off-white head. Smells fruity (ripe banana), nutty, and chocolatey. Tastes like nut, banana, and chocolate in equal parts. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden. I'd never have guessed that this one was over 11%abv. Medium in body. Really pleasing in flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma. One sip invites another, making this one one of the most drinkabile, and quite possibly the best Quadrupel I have ever had."
"found this gem at a local place, i have heard rumors and tales of its existence the smell is amazing different fruits are very abundant as well as alcohol, it looks a dark amber hue with pieces of sediments floating around , much like my homebrew. but this makes my homebrew taste like root beer, incredible mouthfeel and taste, different tastes with each sip, its a shame it isn't cheaper and more available, i paid about 8 dollars for one 11..2 oz serving, but its worth it. this might take my number 1 beer away from ayinger celebrator, I'm going to enjoy this divine treat"
"D: This beer is one you nurse for a while. I would not be able to drink this one fast at all due to the fact that there are so many things for my taste buds to register. To drink fast would be a waste to me. Great beer. I am glad I have a few cases sitting around."
"Flavor is outstanding. This one has some nice warming as well. The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 on taste is a slight rubbing alcohol taste on the finish. Other than that, this one is brilliant, and I will look forward to having this again."
"This beer threw me off a little on the nose. It smelled of red licorice or cherry to me. It poured a clear, dark brown with a good head that lasted the test of time. The taste was very sweet and too much alcohol on the finish for me. It had a very nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall I was not too impressed by this beer. Good, but I wouldn't search it out."
"Full bodied and silky smooth with an aggressive carbonation, a very strong and complex beer, but not something that I would be able to take two or three of."
"The smell is mouth-watering. I'm in anticipation. The flavor does not disappoint. Feels big and wonderful. Easily one of my favorite beers. The alcohol is hardly present for a beer this strong although it finishes with a little bite. Near perfect, a must try."
"A truly exceptional beer, one of my favorites. Pours a murky brown with abeauriful head and exceptional lacing. Smells are winey, malty, a little sour, and with notes of dark spices. Taste starts out with prunes, cinammon, stewed fruit, and progresses to a delicious yeasty taste, brown sugar and a late hit of spicy hops. Absolutely wonderful. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy and smooth, with no discernable alcohol, especially considering the whopping 11.3% abv. Tremendously drinkable. Smooth, flavorful, creamy,subtle, and new flavors with every mouthful. My favorite Trappist barring the untried near mythical Wesvleteren."
"The beer is a dark brown color and there is a nice creamy head. When the beer is rolled around inside my Chimay glass it leaves the glass entirley coated with lacing which enevntually slides back into the brew. The smell is of plums and raisins and there is also alcohol presence. The taste is Again, fruit like and somewhat nutty. The mouthfeel is bittersweet and the alcohol shows up here as well. I could have this beer again on occasion. A nice beer to sip will certainly warm you up."
"I poured this beer too cold, but as it warmed, my oh my, did the taste explode. I didn't want to finish it, it was that good. It poured very, very dark (even held up to light it was difficult to see the yeast particles dancing). It fizzed quite loudly and suddenly into the glass, but on the first taste, as I braced for carbonation overhaul, surprisingly found the carbonation no more than a beautiful dancing upon the tongue. Magic, friends, pure magic. And the tastewell, as it warmed the taste grew in complexities that I cannot dare to describe. Sweet dates and figs dance upon the palate, but the sweet taste did not overwhelmneither did the bitter kick. I am quite partial to that bitter kick, but did not miss it here in favor of the amazing taste of this ale. Highly drinkable, only be careful friends, as the unnoticeable alcohol creeps up and by the end of only one glass I was surprised by the pleasant buzz."
"Wow."
"Pours a dark brown with a very thick off-white head. Has a sweet, floral nose with hints of straw and a slight tanginess. Has a carbonated feel on the tongue with a smooth flow across the cheeks. Sweet, slightly syrupy with some alcohol flavor. A very well-balanced flavor, with a little bit of bitterness and the taste of malts. Heavy lacing on the sides of the glass."
"Really delicious!"
"Standard bottle decanted into a large port glass since I'm sans snifters just now. Color is deep ruby brown, impenetrable except at the edges where a touch of light shows through. The sticky ecru head is durable but a bit thin, perhaps owing to an overly gentle pour. Slightly leathery, prune-raisin dried fruit aroma, mild hints of chocolate and whisky-like phenols. The first sips start fizzy and sweet, evolving into a phenolic bite and prominent alcohol warmth, turning into almost a sting in the aftertaste. As I let it warm and breathe a bit, the carbonation mellows and some port, sherry, oaky flavors come through. Still, the bitey aspect at the end of the sip sticks around, and I wonder if it's actually something to do with the grain (like a lot of Biscuit malt). Great aroma and front of the sip, but that bite at the end dings the drinkability a bit."
"Definately."
"Im glad I tried it, its good  but you can get this, or better tasting brews at a much better price, here in the good ol USA."
"Excellent, excellent beer, and worth the price."
"Wish this was cheaper than $5.5us/12oz. My absolute favorite. Matter of fact, I think this is in a different league of any beer Ive ever had."
"This beer was every bit as great. It was exactly what I was looking for tonight, the very definition of the style. It's a hand-crafted work of art with the finest attention to detail. Now I have 3 more quads waiting on deck, can't wait to crack into them! I highly recommend this beer to all. Cheers!"
"Good drinkablility for the 12% abv, reminds me of a brandy. Very complex beer, but probably needs a few more years to completely round out. Enjoyed it, just a little too boozy for me"
"Pours to a dark murky brown with a tan finger thick head. Smells of a spiced plum that has had a few too many drinks, fruity with a hint of spice and alcohol. The taste is unbelievable the 11% ABV was not as noticeable as I thought it would be. This one has complex flavor sweet malts, fruits, hops and a hint of alcohol burn, very delicious! Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The drinkability is dangerous on this one with the ABV but I found myself wanting another one! Best Rochefort of the bunch!"
"The 10, Rochefort's biggest and best beer is a remarkable quadrupel. It pours a dark cola color with a thick, picky finger head. The heads laces all over the glass. The aroma is sweet: plum and brown sugar. A nice crisp yeast scent balances the sweetness. The flavor is extremely complex. Initially the sweetness hits, similar to the nose. It continues with the slightest sour notes - green apple and dark cherry. Just a tiny bit of bitterness finishes. There's a lot going on here and it all comes together wonderfully. Incredibly delicious, the 11.3% ABV is hardly noticeable. I enjoyed this as an after dinner beer but it certainly would do well with many cuisine options."
"D: This is a very drinkable Belgian. You can definitely taste and feel the alcohol but for such a high ABV the quaffability is superb. I could easily down a bomber of this beer on my own over a meal. Its so light and sweet. Really a pleasure. A little pricey, but probably worth having again for a special occasion."
"Cellard about a year, or maybe a few months less. The beer is marked as best by 06-07-10 (Euro style, day first), so I guess it's about one or two years old now."
"Drinkability: I wish I had more than 11.2 ounces of this stuff! I know the alcohol level is high, but this is definitely one I would want to have a few more of. A great beer that lives up to the hype."
"Notes: One of the better Quads. Not quite as good as St. Bernardus, but definitly on it's level."
"Trappistes Rochefort 10 was a hazy red-brown color with a light tan head. The head was thick and had decent retention, eventually becoming a thin ring. The aroma was fruity (raisins and prunes), malty, and alcoholic. The taste was port-like with dried fruit and dark malt flavors. The finish is long, dry, and throat warming. It is medium to full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. Overall this is an excellent beer with lots of great flavors and very smooth considering the high alcohol. This beer definitely needs to served at the proper temperature."
"My favorite of the Trappist dark strongs. I'd love to cellar some."
"Chocolate brown color with a minimal cappucino head. Deep roasted nose, chocolate, hickory, orange, port, cherry, it just keeps going. Starts sweet and slightly smokey, goes to some orange, port, cherry, molasses, maple syrup, malt. Hides the alcohol so well, and as big, and sweet as this is, it finishes dry and refreshing. Nice slight tingingly mouthfeel. What an amazing beer."
"Overall: Poured into a pint glass. Very neat beer, I think overall it is a very good beer, I don't think it is something I can drink a lot of at once. But something I can drink once again for special occasions."
"I'm not familiar with the Belgian beers, this is different from most things I'll drink. But it's definately got me leaning towards searching out some more Belgians!"
"Overall. An incredible beer! Flavor is much more delicate than i remember and lighter. So creamy and flavorful though. I hear the Rochefort vs. St. Bernardus debate; my side is that Rochefort is slightly more complex on flavor, but Bernardus has a better flavor. I still choose the Bernardus."
"Body/Drinkability: Medium light bodied beer that is vey drinkable."
"11.2oz brown bottle with number on the front of 06 07 10 - perhaps a drink before date? Pours a chestnut brown with a fluffy 2 finger head, nice longevity and lace. Lots of sugary malt smells with a hint of roasted malts. Brown sugar and dried dark fruit smells as well. Alcohol is present but not as mush as I got in the 8. upon drinking, I got an abundance of sweet malts up front mixed with brown sugar and dried fruits, a bit of roasted malts too. A decent hop bitternedd in the aftertaste and a roasted coffee like taste in the finish. Alcohol is present but it seems to blend better in the 10 than the 8. Creamy and smooth. A damn fine beer."
"Notes: probably my favorite beer besides Old Ruffian. definately the best trappist out there in my opinion."
"This beer is a work of art. It is not my style but it is an incredibly well crafted beer. The drinkability is amazingly high for such a strong beer."
"Drinkability: I will probably have this again, and it's one of the most drinkable quads I've experienced. I can only imagine it improving if the alcohol that adds to the taste and mouthfeel, subsides a little bit."
"I could sip this one till I pass out. The carbonation is so mild it just slides down so easily. I'm in love."
"Rochefort 10, while incredibly tasty, isnt the sort of thing Id reach for on a regular basis. The alcohol is a bit overwhelming, and I wouldnt dream of having more than a single glass of this in a blue moon  never mind the $6 price per 11.2oz bottle! This is something to savor, and is special precisely because its so complex. Give me one every few months and Id be quite satisfied. Do yourself a favor and crack one on your birthday like I did!"
"I don't know about anyone else, but I love trappist beers. However this one is quite unique, from what I have found this is a true trappist beer that puts all others to shame. I drank this beer this past summer, a friend gave it to me to try. The beer was dark in color and had an awsome sweet smell to it. The beer was very drinkable, especially for being a strong beer. If you like to drink Trappist beers then this is a great beer to try..."
"A very good trappist ale. Not my favorite of the trappists, but probably one of my favorite Belgian brews in general. Highly recommended."
"Poured aggressively into Chimay chalice, immediately a huge whiff of chocolate brownies. This one has a nice thick off white head with thick luxerious lacing. Its a deep musty brown color with some floaty yeast hanging out around the bottom. I assume this could be avoided with some foresight, but I dont mind. Smells like a punch in the face nessled between lushes medieval breasts. It smells of toffee, chocolate, banana (not in the way a tripel smells of banana, but as in a real banana) hints of raison, vanilla, Belgian yeast, maybe a tinge of hops if you really search for it, and sort of a sherry sent. The taste is milky, slinky, some mild bitterness, a complex richness that coats the mouth, with sweetness and a finish of young bananas. This is a monster of a beer, one must be careful or it will kick your ass. This is a great food beer; maybe some pot roast or stew, but take it slow, this is not a beer you want to close a session with. I will definitly buy this again.. Thanks Rochefort for making my night."
"What a great beer. Really fine. Gotta have some more."
"D- not something to drink too much of, something to be appreciate with friends"
"flawless beer."
"Pour is nearly black with thin head covering the surface. Nose flirts with scents of black cherry, syrupy brown sugar and caramel. Taste is much the same but with lots of dark fruitiness ... like sucking the skin from dark plums black cherries. If someone challenged me to come up with one word for the mouthfeel I'd use elegant. The body is thick and the carbonation strikes when it counts. I like this quad a lot. I'd probably reach for St Bernardus first but this wouldn't be far behind. Delectable."
"You just dont want the experience to stop, a great treat or present for any beer lover. A great beer."
"What a treat this was ! For whatever reason , the price has dropped a buck a bottle to $6.00...I will probably be drinking more of these....still very pricey, but worth the money for when you just have to have something unearthly."
"Appearance is dark brown with some red light passing through when held up. Smell is sweet and malty. Dark fruits come through a bit. Taste is of dark fruit, malts and a touch of sweetness. Sweetness gives way to a slight bitterness that makes taking another sip a must. Carbonation has an almost champagne feel. Small bubbles that are pleasantly active. The alcohol is very well hidden on this beer. Would have guessed it to be a 8% beer or so. Could definitely drink more than one of these if not careful. Definitely a thinking beer. This is not a smack you in the face beer (even with the alcohol). Drink this beer closer to room temperature because the flavors shine at that point. It was a little cold when I first opened and it was slightly muted. This is a quality beer and I will definitely enjoy these again soon. Would like age some and track the maturation."
"To quote Todd A. ""Beer like this gives us a reason to live."""
"Truly a masterful expression of the brewer's art. One of the finest beers there is."
"This beer pours a rust brown with a frothy off white head. The smell is of plums raisins and red wine. Most of these flavors probably come from the use of candied sugar. The taste is also from the candied sugar. It gives a particular fruity flavor that reminds me of dark fruits such as plums and raisins. The mouthfeel is full bodied and naturally cabonated. Overall, highly dirnkable, a great Quad."
"I'd have to say I enjoy this one more than St. Berny's. This is a fantastic sweet quad which has really made me smile. Many thanks to BA Mschae1017 for sharing this one with me."
"Pours dark brown with creamy off white head which it retains really well for the ABV. Smell is alcohol, malty sweetness and carmel, maybe even a little coffee. Flavor reminds me of brown sugar, some roasted malts evident along with plenty of sweetness. The alcohol is present as well. This is medium full body, carbonation isn't prominant but the alcohol burn is. This is very drinkable for the ABV, but the price is prohibitive on this being a session beer. This is a good one, I'll definatly pick this one up again sometime."
"appearance- other than that, one of the most perfect beers Ive ever had."
"Pours a cloudy, molassesy brown with a beige head. Aromas show a highly expressive maltiness, fruit and floral qualities as well as a port wine boquet. The flavors? Where to begin? Such complexity! Rich with excellent fruitiness, floral/spicy flavors with a distinct bit of chocolate at the finish. It boasts a long, deeply satisfying finish. I finish this and almost weep because I have to move onto a different beer. Extraordinary!"
"This was almost all I expected from this beer. My only complaint is that the 11.3% alcohol made itself too evident in the aroma throughout, masking the hints of fruit I detected. Poured to a brownish color with thick tan head that lingered, then left very good lacing. Taste was very good dark fruit, and the finish was as smooth as almost any beer Ive had. This was my first quad to rate, but it definitely will not be my last."
"Wow...it has been a long time since I have had a beer of this magnitude. Phenomenal pour uncovers a dark brown, almost maroon color thin head rises with some crackling carbonation and falls with some smallish bubbles ringing the glass. The bouqet is full and absoulutely amazing....full of rich carmels, candy apple, brown sugar, maplewood...and some faint dry alchoholic notes in the background....very full, very nice. The taste is great as well figs and dates, dark fruits, burnt carmel and again the mapel...the alchohol also shows its face in the finish with some warm notes all the way down...oooh to have a few of these on a cool night. The mouthfeel is creamy full and great but gives way to an ultra dry middle and then full again in the finish....more complex than any other beer I have been privy to at this juncture. 11.3% ABV says you aren't quaffing this one...but sit down an enjoy and you will definately want another, and another....and then you will want a nap. Try this one if you can!"
"This beer sets the standard by which all Belgians should be judged."
"Cloudy, dark brown with reddish hues and a tan head that clings to the glass. The aroma is candy-sweet, syrupy, with some spiciness like honey and cinnamon and toffee/caramel. The flavor is malty sweet, at first with a good strong dose of bitterness, almost medicinal but not quite. There are also hints of cherry, raisins, and a slight smokiness. This was quite well done although sometimes the flavors seemed to clash a bit. (I hate it when people say that but its really the best I can do...)"
"Overall: This beer is good. I think there are better Quadrupel's out there. I would drink it again though."
"Smooth, but thin mouthfeel with muted fruit tones and subtle nuances of caramel followed by hot alcohol. I'm really surprised that this is such a highly rated beer. While this is good, it certainly isn't one of the best beers I've ever sampled. Nothing about it is exceptional, except perhaps the price."
"Poured a very dark brown color with amber and ever so slight ruby hues. Head was enormous, frothy, rocky that went nowhere. Looked like a root beer float. Just perfectly gorgeous. Lacing galore after each and every sip left behind, decorating the glass. Smells of yeast, bananas, ripe dark fruits like figs and raisins, nutty, vanilla, and more. Huge complex aroma. Tastes of yeast, bready, ripe dark fruits, nutty, caramel, hints of chocolate, even cherries, a tad of spiciness like clove. Taste is everywhere. Deliciously complex. Every sip brings about a new hint of some other flavor, like anise for example, that I just picked up in my current sip. Ends with a noticeable alcohol warming, which from experience fades away to absolute smoothness with a bit of aging. Mouthfeel is slippery, creamy, pretty carbonated. I could have one of these everyday, but that would be it. Even though it is one of the best beers I have ever had in my life, it is still 11.3% ABV which takes away from the drinkability factor. Near-perfect brew. Cheers."
"Lots of reviews for this beer; very popular. $6.99 for a 330ml bottle. Expensive, but not the hhighest I've paid per ml of beer. It was a dark cloudy brown with a thick off-white head. Aroma was sweet (molasses) and dark fruit (raisins). Very tasty, smooth, raisins, a little spicy. Alcohol was non-detectable. A wonderful beer, very drinkable as a beer to savor, not to guzzle."
"And after a period, the hops come through as a late reminder, along with some lingering fruitcake."
"Very dark color with a creamy head that really hangs around nicely. The smell is on the sweet side. The flavor is very full with lots of dark dried fruit flavors with malt sweetness. The alcohol is a bit too noticeable for my taste. The mouthfeel is thick but not sticky. Just for the sake of comparison St. B's Abt 12 is better for my taste. The alcohol in this one is a little too prevelent. I will try this again if I have the chance but would probably save it for a cold winter night to enjoy the warming feel from the alcohol."
"A very solid beer. I wouldnt put it ahead of the St. Berny's 12 but I would never turn one down and I will probably purchase this again."
"Poured a light tan color head that sat a top a murky brown body. The head left decent lacing and had all the signatures of use of Belgian yeast, such as the Platue that forms with the head and the thick stick lacing. The smell and taste both had a sweet nutty malts aroma that was followed by a raisiny smell and taste. Both smell and taste had in it a fusal alcohol presence, which is to be expected for the ABV. It has a thick beer that was nicely sipped leaving a dry finish with a warming alcohol note. A beer that was well worth the $5.00 for a 12oz."
"Excellent flavor and body make this a very drinkable quadrupel, though I would be hard pressed to choose between this one and St. Bernardus (I haven't been lucky enough to try the Westveterlan 12)."
"Overall a very nice beer. I normally don't like beer with the strength of this much alcohol in the flavor, but it is a fantastic example of the style. I would enjoy this as a compliment to pepper jack cheese with crackers as a perfect appetizer brew. A very enjoyable brew."
"D: VERY smooth and highly drinkable, especially for such a high ABV. Superb. This beer is a classic. One of the best beers I have ever tasted. I would love to buy several of these to cellar and taste over the years."
"Wonderful brew."
"D - A great Belgian beer. It was my first quadrupel and it was outstanding. I need to have this one around for other momentous occasions."
"This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had. It never fails to disappoint me and my friends. This is one of those beers that has the ability to satisfy any beverage afficionado with its intricacy and can be enjoyed over a long session as it warms in the glass. Outstanding."
"D- Just a sipper, nice beer but would like about half a bottle per sitting but really worth having and more so if you want to split between some friends"
"drinkability - this is the strongest beer ive had at 11.3% but i cant even taste any alcohol! masked extremely well. but it hits you like a damn hammer after one bottle. but the taste and mouthfeel are incredible, cant get enough."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, not as robust as the Rochefort 8. The flavours are strong yet subtle, akin to the Chimay Grand Reserve."
"Drinkability is good but nothing too special. Given the high ABV, it does go down easy. The spiciness and overall nature of this beer does take concentration to enjoy. If you're in the mood for a great beer this is certainly one. With that said, it demands respect and attention."
"Basically the only reason I'm not giving straight 5's is because I haven't tried Westy 12 yet. Amazing stuff that just gets better the closer to room temp."
"Drinkability - Despite the higher alcohol content, the beer finishes rather nicely."
"Notes: An outstanding beer. Great aroma and flavor, but the alcohol shows its presence a bit much compared to other quadrupels. But still, a wonderful beer that I will return to regularly. It paired excellently with a triple creme Brie."
"Drinkability: I'd probably enjoy sitting on one of these every now and then as a good, warming sipper, but I can't help feeling that this doesn't have the subtle balance of other trappist beers. Impressive, though the booze is a challenge."
"The mouthfeel was interesting. After I was about a quarter of the into this one, the top of my tongue started tingling for a while. I originally thought it was from a bit extra sparkling carbonation from the bottle conditioning, but as the spicy-ness showed up later in the beer, I thought that might have had something to do with it as well. The alcohol in this beer was awesome. About 20-30 seconds after a sip, a nice warming feeling would come from the belly. At no point was the alcohol off putting in this one, it was barely detectable besides the warming, which in turn makes this the definition of a dangerously drinkable beer at 11.3%. This beer exceeded my expectations which were high."
"d - this is a very pleasant brew. i drank this during a hot alabama august and probably should have waited until the winter. i'll be sure to stock up on this for then."
"D - ....do I really need to say anything about this beer? It should be categorized as one of the best."
"Drinkability/Overall: frankly, the 8 gets better marks for depth of flavor and drinkability. The great complexity I know this beer has is overshadowed by the booze. A few years would do this beer well. Just might have to pick up another bottle for cellaring."
"It is hard to register this as what I used to call ""beer"" before my enlightenment. It has flavors far beyond my palate, a smoothness/richness that is so far unmatched to me. Drinkability at its abv is phenomenal, but you know what you're getting. Dark fruits, sweet malts, with a slightly bittersweet and long lasting finish that goes on and on. As it warms from my fridge the complexity deepens. This, so far, is my island beer."
"It's intriguingly complex, splendidly blended, and is obviously a stylistic statesman. It's a joy to behold on every level, and it gives up its bounty willingly, but mostly to an able palate. The ABV is right out front, but it's a warming product of its nature. It keeps your attention, and rewards your attention lavishly. That is a great way for a beer to be."
"Pours from the 330ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Body is a deep dark brown with ruby red highlights, topped by a half inch of creamy light brown head that leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Beautiful aroma is almost too complex to describe - notes of apricot, raisin, chestnut, sweet dark malt, lactose, and more than a little alcohol. Palate is simply wonderful - a huge smile came across my face with the first sip. Rich, sweet malt, dark fruit, a touch of spiciness, all mixing in perfect harmony. Beautifully creamy mouthfeel is just absolutely perfect - velvety smooth, without the thick, syrupy body that can overwhelm some of the stronger beers, along with a lightly dry finish. If not for the strength and the price, I might never drink anything else again."
"Finish is peaceful and gradual in flavor dissipation. I notice a caramelly and light cinnamony peppery sweetness that fades into a pleasant malt extract-like cloying sweetness. Nice."
"This Belgian gem may perhaps be the world's finest. My only regret is that I do not have another in my cellar to enjoy."
"Comments: I enjoyed this Belgian Abbey tremendously. Delicious! Even though it has a strong brandy flavor, and I don't enjoy hard liquor, I truly enjoyed this beer. Excellently crafted! Truly world class as I was expecting..."
"Drinking Rochefort 10 was a memorable beer experience. It's elegant, refined, and demands respect. I love this line from their website: ""To conclude still this: make no abuse of this gift of God."""
"This poured a dark deep brownish color with a nice thick persistent head. It has a delightful malty smell. The taste is a deep delicious molasses/carmel type taste. Mouthfeel is full and chewy. As for as drinkability  Im trying to figure out how to get this flowing through the pipes in my house!"
"11.3 % ABV. Keeps this limited to only a few in one sitting but doesn't stop you from craving another...deceptive in it's ways."
"This is a beguiling brew and an absolute pleasure to drink."
"It was smooth and tasty - quite sweet. The alcohol and sugar lingered. A real ""sipping"" treat."
"Rochefort 10 certainly lived up to the hype for me. This was my first experience with a quadrupel and I'm glad I started with this one. I'm glad this is relatively widely available because I'll be enjoying this regularly."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a deep amber hued light brown with garnet edges close to light. A thin white half-finger head slowly gave way to a white ring of sticky lace. Aroma is sweet and earthen, dark fruits, malt, alcohol and warm bread. Taste is complex, sweet and malty, alcohol brings some warming with it's presence, fruitier than the nose inclines. Mouthfeel is rough due to the moderate levels of alcohol and carbonation, medium weighted body finishes off the palate with a crisp dryness. Drinkability is exceptional given the high abv, although far from bashful in it's appearance. Overall, a well balanced and well executed beer."
"But I'm glad it's back on shelves in Chicago, mostly because I like seeing it."
"Overal an excellent and well balanced beer. I put this one up against the St. Bernardus Abt 12 tonight and in my opinion this one is just as good if not a ittle better."
"D: Couple more years on this beer would have done some amazing things. This is a whiskey drinkers beer....full of intense flavors and alcoholic vapors. Phenomenal."
"The drinkability is good. There is really no element here that overpowers or causes the drinkability to be low. Overall, this brew is a touch disappointing. I may have brought this on myself. Just because this beer is what it is, I had high hopes for it to astound me. It fell short, but it is indeed a great beer with much character."
"Simply another amazing Trappist Beer. Didnt expect anything less here."
"Aroma is absolutely out of this world! Plums, cocoa, dough and alcohol are all present in the nose. Taste is sweet and bready with a slight amount of fruits and yeast. Despite hiding the 11.3%abv considerably well, the alcohol is definately present as you can feel the warmth. The high alcohol content hurts drinkability. You know, this is a damn fine beer that really cannot be done justice by words alone. This is without a doubt one of the finest beers on the planet that I have tried."
"Overall: Damn, I think this may well be the best beer Ive yet tried. Extremely well integrated, about the only thing I can ding it on is the lackluster head. It will take a few more sessions to fully appreciate the flavor complexities. An excellent brew, go out and get one TODAY!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a huge frothy head that left layers of sticky lace on the glass. Aroma was very malty and caramelly with notes of banana, dark fruit and some herbal hop notes in the nose. Taste was quite rich and malty. Lots of flavors of malt, dark fruit, figs and chocolate balanced with a nice hop bitterness. This is a pretty full bodied beer, almost a meal in a glass. Amazing that the alcohol is so well hidden at 11.3%. This makes for high drinkability and can sneak up on you if you're not careful. Recommended, but not for the faint of heart."
"Overall: A wonderful beer, one of the best I have ever had. An excellent warmer to sip and savor. You WILL want to have another, when the time is right...."
"Dark brown, hazy in color. Moderate head, which faded fairly quickly. Smell was sweet and malty, with raisins and other fruits coming through. Taste was very complex, and takes a while to sort out (like all night...) -- raisins, port wine, chocolate, bubblegum, pepper at finish. Wow, what a beer. The mouthfeel was thick, with very little carbonation. The alcohol provided a nice warmth after a few sips. I think I would have enjoyed this more on a winter evening rather than the summer, but that was my issue, not the beers."
"Mouthfeel- Great crabonation and a clean yet undeniably warming finish that lasts for a great amount of time. Lots of complex flavors make a pretyy damn good melange of flavors all over my tongue. The monks know what the hell they are doing."
"Sweet departure"
"Adam"
"Poured a murky brown into a chalice with a nice dense tan head. Aroma was of dark fruits, sugary. Taste started out seeming pretty complex, mostly dark fruit like figs, a hint of brown sugar, but the more I continued drinking it, the less I liked it. The sweetness started to seem cloying, and there was a bubblegum taste that started to overpower the beer as it warmed up. Personally, I liked the Rochefort 8 better, and for the $$$, I probably won't be buying this one again."
"pours out of the third liter bottle dark crimson with a tan head. lots of sediment floating about. laces the glass with fine rings. sugary aroma with holiday spice. smells like x-mas pudding with a kick.. yummy. taste is a float your boat deliciousness of dried and wooden maltiness with a balance of divine yeasty intervention. there is the expected alcohol kick with a spicy rapture. body is full with a heavenly mouthfeel that brings the drinker close to nirvana. drinkability is dangerous."
"M/D- This beer reminded me of wine in the mouthfeel, except that it had lots of bubbles....it really coated the toungue....Drinkability....the alcohol could have been hidden a little better....This was pretty good, but I was surprised to see it is in the top ten."
"Wow, this is beer? Amazing what those monks can do... Awesome depth and complexity of flavors, probably more that my pallate can do justice to. Definately not an everyday drinker but I plan to keep a few on hand for special occasions."
"Somewhat murky brown in color. Good sized head that receedes quite fast. Big, sugary aroma-reeks of raisens and brown sugar. Malty with a definate alcohol tinge to it. The alcohol comes off quite spicy. Slight earthiness in the flavor. Good body-quite thin actually-obviously fermented out quite well. Dangerously drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is also impacted (to me) by the alcohol, this one isn't particularly subtle, Boy does it taste good though!"
"Alcohol is present but nicely balanced. A kick at first, but you get used to it."
"Pours a deep, rich brown with a tan head and not alot of lacing. Good but not great. Smell was sweet and fruity with nearly no alcohol, which I thought was impressive, given the alcohol content. Taste was malty sweet with some fruity notes. Alcohol makes a nice subtle appearance in the taste - very warming and slightly medicinal. Some spiciness contributed by the yeast. Hasn't been the fullest bodied beer I have ever tasted, but not weak in this category either. Stands up well to the alcohol. Very drinkable for the alcohol content but is definitely a beer to sip and enjoy."
"Drinkablity: I like this beer would love to have them frequently but it is expensive but this doesn't effect the drinkablity rating just FYI."
"Trappistes Rochefort 10 pours a chocolate brown color with an off white head and chunks of yeast from a less than perfect pour from a 33cl bottle. The aroma is somewhat fruity and alcohol is noticeable. The alcohol is noticeable in the taste too, not in a bad way though. Some dark fruit flavors are present. Chocolate comes to mind too, but its not really chocolate or chocolatey tasting, just an aspect of the flavor. I'm not sure I appreciate the style as much as others do. Definitely an interesting beer and quite good to boot. I think I may have to revisit this again sometime."
""
"Drinkability is OK. I prefer the 8."
"Bottom line: I had this brew a couple of years ago and I have to honestly say, I didn't care much for it at the time but now, after expanding my palate's horizons, so to speak, I find this brew a definite winner and certainly a world class product. I thoroughly recommend it!"
"D - A sipping beer to be sure. One of the best Quads I have ever had."
"It has toasty fruity, toffee/carmel nose with layers of soft malt and hops. Also, a lively mouth feel that is extremely well-balanced."
"A really soft, and complex, version of a quadrupel. I like it."
"all said, a really unique beer, i like westveleteren products more, but it is a special drink and the complexity has improved greatly over time."
"The ABV is the only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 as far as drinkability. This stuff is just so smooth; it drinks like something with half the amount of alcohol."
"A sipper for the most part but it doesn't get much better than that. This is a world class beer."
"Out and out one of the VERY best beers I've ever tasted. I hesitate to rate anything all 5's but I just can't come up with anything to argue about."
"This is a fantastic beer, no way of getting around it. It has many superior qualities which are executed in an excellent manner. Check this beer out. It is most certainly worth the money."
"Nice smooth thick creamy mouthfeel. With a good 30 second finish. A very good beer. Drinkability suffers a little because of the burn in the chest in throat."
"A great brew to sip and savour, its so damn tastey you can certainly have 2."
"Taste is similar to the smell only bigger and bolder. Chocolate and dates in the beginning give way to something dusty and earthy. Aftertaste is a lot of alcohol, much more than I expected. Chalky and dry in parts as well. Takes a few sips to get used to it but it does mellow out. This is a sipper and should be treated with respect."
"Last night I opened a brand new bottle of Rochefort 10 along with one that was about 3 years old (based on the best-by date and older label style). I've always been a big fan of this beer, and the style, and I wasn't disappointed by either of the samples. They were both complex and sweet, with a slightly fruity alcohol taste, excellent body and mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor abound with hints of prune, date, and wonderful Belgian yeast esters. As much as I enjoyed the new bottle, aging for 3 years brought the beer close to perfection. The 10's alcohol bite isn't bad for a strong beer, but the older bottle was far smoother, balancing things out better and allowing the more complex flavors to be tasted. Either way, I'd drink this beer anytime, and perhaps every time, given the chance."
"I think I will lean more towards the first impression, but it is still a great beer."
"D: I am constantly returning the glass to my lips. A slow drinking beer, but no hint of the 11% abv."
"D - Just an outstanding beer which I'll drink time and again. Drinkability? Given the 11.3% ABV it's far too easy to sip."
"A=4.5, S=4, T=5, M=4.5, D=4.5"
"Pored a deep black. Thick creamy head, with thick layer of foam. Chewy chocolate and spice at the first sip. I let every mouthful linger as long as possible, it was a real treat. So many flavors and an awesome texture, but without the expected alcohol aftermath."
"M&D: a heavy-weight beer with 4 more years to go before its self-imposed BB date, its mouthfeel is simply sublime--mellow yet softly-carbonated to provide reasonably refreshing mouthfeel, full-flavoured with but a quiet presence of soothing alc., vertically-structured and approachable... All in all, this is a beautifully-crafted beer with great drinkability, by which I mean it deserves careful appreciation once in a short while, not having more than one bottle at a time. There's so much more to explore in this beer, I'm sure, once my experience of beers is further broadened..."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Dinkability: pretty good for such a high alcohol beer. The is a well balanced slow sipper that can add an exclamation point to a evening of quaffing beers. Must have at least once."
"A very solid quadrupel that is a treat to be enjoyed. Although the flavor is solid, the aroma is the highlight here. Not my favorite for the style, but a quality offering."
"Dangerously drinkable. My heart says, ""Have another and another and another."" My brain says, ""Save the other one to brighten another lousy day but go buy some more."""
"Pours about a half inch of head: creamy, light-brown, excellent lacing. Dark brown color. Aroma is right on style: bread, moderate yeast, dough, raisin, cherry. Flavor was, again, right on style, but nothing tasted WOW. Like this is a cut above the rest. Palate was medium bodied, watery, and with a soft carbonation. Could definitely taste the alcohol. I prefer the St. Bernardus ABT 12 to the Rochefort."
"it poured a dark rich amber color with a thick foamy head. The aroma was malty , hoppy and a bit fruity, It tasted very malty with little to no hop flavor. It had overtones of dark cherries and blackberries, some rich dark mollasses flavor, but not overly sweet. It was quite pleasantly yeasty and it finished with a pleasant alcohol bite. Overall I really enjoyed this one, and would readily get it again if i see it in the store."
"D - Very drinkable. Another excellent Rochefort brew."
"This is definitely one to reserve for special occasions, not because I wouldn't love to have one every day, but because I don't want to ruin myself for all other beer."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is a little much, both on the palate and on the nervous system, but it's still a damn good beer. I'd love to have one cellared."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a thick creamy off-white head. The head settles down to form a perfect lasting cover for the body. Some lacing present. Aroma is chocolate, molases, dark fruits, with some roasted notes. Flavor is chocolate, molases, figs, candi sugar, raisins, prunes, and cookie dough. An alcohol presence comes in the middle, and lingers through the end and finish. Roasted coffee and rum come in at the end. The finish is lasting, with warm to hot alcohol. Finish is semisweet from the lingering flavors of the fruits. The texture of this brew is wonderful, silky smooth and creamy, coating with a full mouthfeel. Has a low carbonation, but still has a soft fizz on the tongue. Wonderful beer, but I think the strong alcohol presence takes away from the beauty of this beer. I definately prefered the number 8 to this."
" One of the best beers I tasted so far. Certainly not one for social drinking, but just sit back and relax!"
"Cellar temp. Carefully poured without the yeast residue into the glass. Opaque ruby dark brown with a solid finger and a half of creamy light khaki head. Nose of rummy fruits: plum, strawberry, and maybe pear. Roasted malt underside. Sweet, sugary wheat and yeast with some alcohol spice. Complex and mouth-watering. Taste starts off with sweet, sugary fruit malts. Dark-edged and ripe, but with a sugary wheat side. Roastiness settles in and gives a little balance. Hoppish bitterness follows in a crescendo that ends with loud sugary malts and spicy, warming fruit alcohol. Wow. Long finish of licorice, wheat tang, fruit esters, and roasted hop bitterness. Rocky, volatile, tingly carbonation up front. Body is full with a mouth-covering feel. An incredible beer that can be dangerously drinkable at 11.3%."
"This was definitely worth the wait. I've been sitting on this one for 5 or six months and there's no telling how long it was at Kenny Road Market in Columbus. Doubtfully very long, but you never know. A world-class beer that I'm going to try to find some more of and cellar away for many years to come."
"An ale that I'll definitely pick up more of, but one in a sitting is more than enough to satiate me. And I thoroughly enjoyed the scent of lilacs down to the bottom of the glass. Truly a noteworthy ale."
"Sudsy and active head, too magnificent to count by fingers, tan sitting atop a dark maple body with amber highlights. Rich malt and a hoppy floral freshness, with a huge mix of apple, nuts, and biscuit. Medium-thick body, with the same complexity, dark currants added in, slightly piney and woody. Goes down with a rush of flavors, belgian yeast kicking in full force with coriander, and alcohol warmth finally emerging. One to sip and savor carefully."
"On par with the Abt 12. Very good beer."
"The first aroma I get as soon as I pop the cap is musty green apple. The beer is a very dark garnet, and not transparent in the least. Near-black colouration actually. The head stayed solid as a nice thick layer of light brown, tight foam. It dimpled slightly but showed no signs of lessening at all. Thick styrofoam lacing that did not slide. World-class looking beer. The aroma is quite sweet up front, like fresh red grapes. Light nuttiness and dusty malts from above the rim of my chalice glass. The smell is even more sugary in close, but always under the veil of the musty yeast which softens and adds a table-cream nuance. The fruits are here: initially a little apple, then red grapes, pear, pineapple(yes), prunes, dates, figs, even light peach. Sniffing very closely gives the spicy phenols and some solvent alcohol. I find the earthy smell increases as the beer warms. Superbly complex malts. A new aroma with every tilt of the glass. As true with most of the great beers, there is a certain indescribable part of the nose too--almost a soft wood smell, or tree sap, maybe pine needles and a little clove? Almost medicinal at times, and it can be numbing to the nose after a bit, so take your time with this beast. In the background seems to float a little dried-beer aroma, like the smell of some beer in the bottom of a glass discovered the next day. Some roasted characteristics here too, but the malts are very creamy and soft, with little harshness. And for an 11% quadrupel, the alcohol is never overpowering. A definite cornucopia of aromas here though; incredible. The mouthfeel of this beer is layered in duplicity. It is full yet feels like whipped cream on the tongue. Delicate carbonation, and an intensely creamy texture. The first taste in the mouth is of some very deceivingly light malts, roasted but not bitter. The beer in the front of the mouth actually has very little flavour--the tip of my tongue registers more of its FEEL rather than its TASTE. In the middle comes some savoury maple, some brown sugar, a little milk chocolate, musty tannin-like dryness, and caramel cake. The alcohol shows itself a little near the end, but this tastes not even remotely close to a an over-11% ale. The malting is absolutely incredible: sweet, wine-like and filled with fresh bread and toffee/caramel flavours. The malts are not so much meaty as refined and balanced perfectly. The flavour exudes age, earthiness and dust. Any hopping is undetectable, and any dryness in the finish comes from the dark malts. This goes through the gullet to the stomach rather quickly; dangerously so. The 10 definitely warms the insides rapidly. This would be brilliant for a cold winter beer. Give me this over brandy or port anyday. Absolute liquid ambrosia here. Better than St Bernie 12 for me personally(the 12 has too much apple in the aroma). I am ecstatic to finally have this available in our province."
"This is a great beer, no surprise there. I do prefer the alcohol to be better hidden in beers of this strength, and that has cost it some points overall. I suggest a deep breath through the nose each time you take a sip, just to take in as much of this beer's essence as possible."
"Trappistes Rochefort was recenty introduced in the Swedish Systembolaget's selection. 10 sold out before lunch the first day but was back on the shelves three days later. Compared to the 8 the 10 is pretty similar. It pours with a generous, creamy latte colored foam and has a nice, very dark brown color. The smell is of fruity caramel and roasted malts. It's dry but unlike the 8 it has an alco taste. Apart from that it has the same licorice body. A great beer but I can't decide if I prefer the 8 before the 10."
"Smell is sugar laden with fine herbal notes, berries and an alcohol undercurrent. This brew has a very creamy mouthfeel while yielding a medium body. Quite complex flavors that range from mild smoky chocolate undertones to sweet ripened fruit. Perfectly at home on the palate, this brew ends with a warming sensation as the alcohol hits the stomach. Top notch stuff that deserves a sip to sip attention.."
"Poured with a quickly diminishing tan head at cellar temperature into a Leffe glass (oh the shame). Appearence is reasonably cloudy (possibly from a slightly quick pour). Aroma of ripe fruits with malt laced with alcohol. Tasted very rich and fruity, with a sweet malty lingering finish and alcohol warming the throat and mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a surprisingly lively carbonation. Definately a 'sip and savour' beer - one for those cold evenings when the rain is lashing against the windows. Possibly a bit too sweet for my liking, but I look forward to trying the other Rochefort brews."
"It's been a long time since I have reviewed so here goes. What a beer to come back to? Rochefort 10 is quite possibly the greatest beer I have EVER tasted. Pours a cloudy chocolate brown I am guessing from the yeast in the bottle. The head this thick and creamy with good lacing throughout. The smell is outstanding. There is everything from caramel to dried fruits (raisens dates etc) There is also a strong alcohol aroma but it just strong enough and not too strong. The taste is where this beer really stands out. It has everything you could want. It's smooth it has a myriad of flavors to explore (very woody as well as the fruits and nuts taste). The drinkability is perfect but one could easily be 3 sheets to wind in a very short amount of time on this tasty but potent brew."
"Opinion: Well, obviously I really like this beer! It is a work of art, and one that I would highly recommend. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. It is so drinkable and unique among even the Belgian brewers, that I will be indulging in this delicacy as much as financially permissible in the future."
"For my pure palate satisfaction and enjoyment, this is as good as good as I've had. In terms of complexity and depth, I think this beer can rival a great deal of fine wines on the market. It's beers like Trappistes Rochefort 10 that validate my love and appreciation for beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for an abv of 11.3%."
"Pours a deep copper color with a thick & dense two finger tan cap. Cap settled into ridges to a one finger cap leaving lacings up the side. Fruity esters in the aroma along with molasses, bubblegum and raisins. A very slight diacetyl . Alcohol is on the nose. Flavor comes through with a syrupy sweetness to almost chew on. Fruity with raisins and has a vinous quality. Not quite the depth of flavor I was looking for. Alcohol is apparent at first, but goes away after a few sips. Nice charcoal hop bitterness. Carbonation is medium and finishes dry. Very good beer!"
"Had this one at the bier garden in downtown Melbourne. Poured a very very nice looking frothy brown color with not much of a head, but a near perfect lace that was there till the end. This beer had a cloudyness to it that almost made it look like a brown slush puppy...it was almost too pretty to drink. Smell was of many dark fruits...figs and prunes were the most dominant for me. There was also some vanilla aromas and a slight whiskeyish smell lingering here and there as well. Taste brought out the dark fruit even more, especially as it warmed. I also picked up on some sherry and molasses flavors that were excellent. Mouthfeel was relatively heavy, starting off very juicy and ending with a slight tart twang. Carbonation was a bit high, but not bad by any means. It is a very syrupy beer but still easy to drink....I could see myself drinking a few of these easily enough. A wonderful beer, those monks are doing something right. Cheers"
"goes good with lindt dark chocolate truffles and munster cheese."
"Rochefort 10 is a superior experience. The complexity is so great-- it's hard to tease apart the constituent aromas and flavors. This is quite the brew."
"Exquisite!"
"first sip is sweet caramel, ginger and alcohol. instantly warming. dark grainy bread, some wood and anise as well. after warming and drinking more collected yeast, i get a cinnamony christmas spice cake. just delicious. aftertaste is yeasy with dark crusty bread hanging around long after the swallow. mouthfeel is initially excellent. creamy heavy body that expands in your mouth and coats your throat for a super-smooth swallow. does thin, though as time goes by. sip this quad. heavy alcohol so you wouldn't want to drink quickly anyways. very easy to take the time to enjoy this one. overall, i would have this one dead even with westy 12. i can't accurately say which i'd prefer, but based on what i remember, i'd put them both behind st. bernardus 12. one day i'll do a vertical and may be able to accurately adjust my ratings, but to make a long story short: absolutely excellent quadrupel. a must try."
"i kneel to the superiority of the belgian brewmasters, if their brewing skills are from god, maybe atheism is the wrong path."
"It only looses points in drinkability beacause it is so intense with such a high abv. that after a few it would no longer be appreciated."
"will revisit as this bottle didnt bring me trembling to God's feet as I had hoped."
"Drinkability is ok great aroma nice big flavors very tasty the finish just makes it good instead of great. Noticeable alcohol that doesn't seem to blend plus a little too much zest for my tastes. Still pretty good brew though."
"D: A good beer, yes. Worth $6-$7 per 11.2 oz bottle, hell no."
"Overrall: At 11.3% one can imagine that this is a sipper, and it is. But it is so delicious that I would gladly sip a second."
"While the alcohol is noticeable in the flavour, it certainly is not so 'in-your-face' that it hurts the drinkablility. For an 11.3% brew, this one is sneaky. While I think I prefer Abt. 12 to this brew, they are both classics, and exceptional for their style."
"I'm uncharacteristically dissappointed in this one - my palate just doesn't like the flavors and experiences it provides very much. I won't rate it lower than average, because I understand that it's my mouth's problem, not the beer's. Your milage may vary."
"Da sipping brew for sure, this one will warm you up in a hurry. Excellent! One is plentythe 11.3ABV reminds you it is there with every sip."
"This is easily an all time favorite. It pours into the glass aromatically with a stout head. The fruity eshters and sweet malt linger for a long time. The Head is tight laced and long lasting. The mouth is strong coffee and cocoa with a hint of raisin and licorice, but they are only subtle. The finish is somewhat dry and still long lasting. The coffee and trace amount of fruit from the hops/malt stick around for a while."
"My only problem with this one is not the high ABV (bring it on) but how the alcohol dominates the flavor a bit too much. This is a unique ale, in that I tend to taste and feel it differently every time. But it's always above average to one degree or another."
"I would definitely recommend this beer to anybody, even though the high carbonation didn't make this beer as enjoyable as I thought it would be. I could see how laying this beer down for a year or two would really help make it more complex."
"Drinkability get a point off because you just simply don't want this glass to be empty. Sip, savor, and fully enjoy each drop. Simply outstanding."
"a brew worthy of it's reputation."
"Wow. This is a meal in a bottle and a real treat to sip. Will definitely try this again. Richness and high ABV limit this to one in an evening and cost with limit how often I try this beer. This is my first quad and definitely will be hard to beat."
"taste brings more surprises, including a dry bitter finish. high abv is very obvious, but works with the flavor, isn't too distracting. big, full-bodied chewy mouthfeel. this is way more intense than the couple of quadrupels i've had so far, and a great example of a beer being so solid and powerful it can stand on its own. i'll take one of these with nothing else. no food or smoke, just a bottle and a glass, this beer kicks ass."
"This one holds up well to any food/cigar combo I can think of. It's drinkability is only held back buy the alcohol% and price."
"11.2 ounce bottle, pours cloudy brown with some yeasty sediment floating around, excelent retention shown on the tan head, loose, puffy, with world class thick lacing. Nose of rum soaked raisins, and yeasty goodness. Tasty and strong brew, notes of dark rum, ripe fruits, figs, ginger, bready yeasts. Yum. Heady, complex, classic belgian,world class sipper, well worth seeking out and enjoying. If only the price was more in the realm of affordability."
"O - A great beer worthy of any praise given. I wish had a bit more beer money to stock up on more of this..."
"This beer poured out a dark,reddish brown with a beautiful large sparkling head.There was hints of raisin and chocolate in the smell as well as taste.This is an exceptional Belgian beer,probably one of the best.Do yourself a favor and run out and get this beer now!"
"Six packs for all!"
"Very drinkable, just make sure you take it easy. The strength is deceiving in this excellent beer."
"This pours a clear very dark reddish black with a large two finger foamy head. The smell has a real dark fruit and alcohol aroma with a hint of brown sugar. The taste has brown sugar, figs,prunes or raisins, and a lot of alcohol. The m/f is heavy or even ""chewy"" with a complex mix of dark fruit and sugar flavors, alcohol,and alot of carbonation. This is a very good beer,yet I think it may be a tad overrated."
"I think this is my new #1."
"Very high, so long as you take small sips, and space them well. I learned this about halfway through. If you don't, the alcohol builds on your palate and hurts the taste."
"This is a serious sipping beer, I can feel the alcohol warming! To be partaken of on special occasions, a real treat!"
"$8 for a 12oz bottle. A very nice treat, but the price is a bit high to make it more than an occaisonal treat. Aside from the price I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to sample a good begium quadrupple."
"330 ml bottle. Rochefort 10 pours out an impenetrable dark brown color with a large head that fades to a thin layer of foam. Rich, malty aroma. Amazing aroma come from this brew as it warms: chocolate, toffee, dark fruits, hazlenuts, grapes. The flavor is quite malty and spicy, but not overpowering. The subtle flavors are still able to come through. Pears, grapes, chocolate, bread, and hazlenuts. Little bitterness. Alcohol is noticable, but this is way more drinkable than any 11.3% beer deserves to be. Mouthfeel is creamy. Great complexity and flavor. This is one of the best beers in the world."
"This is the greatest beer in the world. The flavor profile is so complex, with chocolate, fruity, spicey notes all going on, but yet perfectly balanced. I first had this beer in a cafe in Brussels, and it was perfect. I have since had it here in the United States many times, and it makes the journey pretty good, although it is better when handled and stored properly over its life. It is very consistant from bottle to bottle."
"33 cL bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Thick, opaque cloudy coffee. Fizzy grayish yellow head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Aromas of cherries, figs, raisins -- all drowining in cognac; caramel malts and a suggestion of anise. Big, alcoholic brandy flavor. Cherry cordials and date sugar sweetness. I kept thinking that this is what I'd expect a Belgian Barleywine to taste like. Viscous mouthfeel, oily and creamy at once with fluffy carbonation. This is absolutely one of the best beers I've ever tasted. An indulgence worth every penny."
"Bottle Pours a cloudy dark brown with a big creamy light tan head. The lacing is excellent and the head lasts well. Aroma is very pleasent with hints of plum, wood, and cola. Has a soft sweet aroma. Taste is excellent. Carbonation is perfect, the mix is awesome goes down with total ease. I could drink this anytime anyplace. This is a full bodied beer with an oily alcohol texture. Has a touch of a sweet finish, but its very good. I love this beer."
" At 11.3% ABV this is a sipper or nightcap for me."
"Overall drinkability pretty high, especially for a beer this high in abv. At seven dollars a bottle it's not going to be a staple of my beer diet, but it's a really good beer that I will be drinking again. Makes me want to try some more Quadrupels, that's for sure."
"Drinkability - I wouldnt have more then 1 of these in a night since it is a bit spendy to stock up on, but the one I have is goin down really well. I've been lukewarm on many belgian beers, but this one is unlike any other quadrupel I have ever had. Really drinkable."
"it's possible i still prefer the 6, but hella tasty this is"
"The drinkabilty of this beer is excellentso rich and delicious, after one sip I immediately want another."
"With the complexity, richness, and ABV of this beer, one bottle is good enough for me. But it will make an excellent 'special occaision' beer."
"This is a classic and lives up to its hype. A must try for anyone who really wants to learn to appreciate what beer can be. Just a great drinking experience that is enjoyment from the first sniff to the last swallow."
"One of my best friends favorite beers. If its on the menu this brew is in her glass. I tend to think this beer is one of the more ""overrated"" beers on BA but don't take that the wrong way. Its a fine brew but to my taste buds its an above average Quad."
"Overall, this is one hell of a beer. I will be purchasing much more, even at $6+ per bottle."
"This pours out a nice dark blackish with brown edges. At tall unforgiving head stands atop the beer like a piece of cake. The smell is amazing. It fills the entire room. Citrusy at first crack of the bottle. As I pour it out, it is a bit more earthy and yeasty. Has a nice fruity aroma. This has a very earthy taste. Not as fruity/estery as the smell. And a great kick of alcohol warms my mouth and throat. The roasted maltiness is just bitter and sweet enough. Quite delicious, but slightly less complex than I expected. This is probably the best mouthfeel on a beer I have ever had. Normally I rate mouthfeel half heartedly, but this one is full, huge carbonation and a nice smooth velvety finish with the alcohol warmth to boot. Just a fantastic beer to the end of a long day."
"The taste explodes in the mouth with maple, raisin, and a tiny bit of horsiness. This is a very sugary beer, lots of sweetness lingering in the back of the mouth. There is a definite feel of alcohol, not surprising given the abv. This is very pleasant going down. One of the more drinkable Belgian strong ales I've tasted."
"Poured into an Orval goblet, this beer was rich mahogany in color with a perfect creamy full head....gorgeous. Nose was also top notch, liqourice comes to mind first followed by a healthy serving of alcohol which was no surprise at this abv, also some very sweet candylike notes as well. Taste for me was OK. I really must admit that I had high hopes but this wasn't bad by any means just not as I expected. immediate big flavor but spicy tingly alchohol pretty much dominates the whole way through. Not unpleasant by any means, some slight hints at Oaky woodiness in the background but the alcohol is the main component here. Overall a good high ABV beer which is pleasant tasting and gorgeous, but it didn't blow me away by any means."
"Drinkability: Too strong to have several at a time."
"D- This is a well balanced beer with all the flavors melding and the alcohol is a nice balance to the grain and sugars. I usually don't taste dates but more of a raisin flavor but this was a nice difference. It goes down very smooth for a 11.3 ABV."
"This Quad has a thick cloudy brown color with a heavy thick even light brown head. The smell is rich with fermented fruit. The taste is lighter than expected. It has an ethereal aftertaste and a warming effect probably due to the high alcohol content. A bit nutty but far more sterile than I would have hoped for in a good Belgium beer. It has all the tags to be a great beer but it lacks a full flavor. Perhaps the 6 or the 8 will have a more intact flavor. Seems, overly fermented?"
"Sent by Lou91 in a beer trade. Best if consumed by 3/7/07 but I couldn't wait that long. Pours light to medium brown in color. Looks darker brown in the glass. Foam develops and fills over half the glass. Carbonation bubbles appear large in size. Aroma through lots of foam is of nuts and spices. Taste is a litle of cardboard perhaps damaged in the shipment? Mouthfeel is exquisite, very silky smooth. Taste is of nuts, very subdued not overpowering in any way. Taste is a little like grapeseed. This reminds me of Westy 12 a little bit. High ABV is hidden very well. No alcohol burn. A little bit of evaporating alcohol if held on the tongue for a while."
"Appears murky dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma is complex and of raisins, spices, belgian yeast, chocolate, cocoa and fresh fruit (bananas, oranges). There is a huge sweet chocolatey malt flavour. Tastes of dark dried fruits (raisins), brown sugar, spices (allspice) and has a warming alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is full, thick and smooth. Had Rochefort 10 a few times now and it has a lot going on. An outstanding, complex and warming beer. Always the right choice at the Belgian Beer Cafe in Perth."
"Overall, a very nice brew. I will probalby try this again, but not too often at $7 a bottle."
"Impressive pour into a chalice, deep mahogany with a slight tan head. The head is thick foam that slowly dissipates. The aroma is on candied rasins, fruit, and choclate. The flavor matches the aroma, except for the belgian sugar that is really sweet. The sickiness of the sugar leaves a slick feel in the mouth. After one the warm is enough and the sugary sweetness detracts from the ability to enjoy another."
"thick, chewy malts with a brown sugary sweetness and hints of dark fruits. full, creamy mouthfeel with a little too much carbonation. alcohol taste is nonexistent, but the 11.3% hurts the drinkability. excellent beer."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a large, off-white head that is slow to dissipate. The ruby highlights glinting through the cloudy brown were beautiful. Smells sweet and fruity, with some chocolate in the mix too. Tastes mostly of sweet toffee and caramels, with raisins and plum and a small hint of the usual trappist breadiness thrown in for good measure. Feels creamy and well-carbonated, perfectly thick without being at all difficult to drink. Honestly extraordinary, the ABV is so well masked that the beer is warming and inviting and not at all harsh."
"Poured beautifully into a Westmalle chalice. Beer poured a dark, almost muddy brown color with a slightly creamy head that slowly dissipated and leaves a solid lacing around glass. Smell is of dark fruit and deeply roasted grain, not an overpowering smell, just a very complex one that has subtle aromas to it. Taste has cherries and some malty sweetness, nothing extreme, just very complex. Mouthfeel is glorious and drinkability is high, to hell with the price."
"I think I could have given this beer all 5's, but I'm not ready to do that yet."
"Pors a deep murky brown with a fluffy,sticky off white that sticks like glue to the glass,wow what amzing aromas what can I say perfect cinnamon spice and cherry,cakey with alcohol infusion,amazing.Where to start flavor wise cherry over top of a cinnamon clove-like spiciness almost like fruit cake.The alcohol presence is there in the finish but its a great little burn,goes down smoothly but with a full body.A classic for reason I have had this a few times but this is my first bottle to myself,I wouldnt share with anybody I admit it.Damn fine beer."
"This is by far the best trappist ale available. Upon opening the bottle, you are met with a distictive fruity aroma. Pouring the beer reveals a creamy head,and a dark amber brown color. 11.3% abv, yet there is no real smell of alcohol. A beer that isn't bitterly hopped. Smooth drinking beer. You will find much yeast sediment at the bottom of your bottle or glass. The best beer I have ever tasted."
"You don't find many beers like this one. In fact, I often don't spend that 7.99 per bottle on any 11.2 ounce beer. So for the coast off a Sierra Nevada pale ale six pack, I bought this to try- well because I wanted to. I feel that is enough justifcation. Anyway, I loved this beer. It was rather like an experience ot sorts. Huge creamy head above a dark amber liquid. Strong smell of dried figs, raisins- all kinds of sweetness. The smell of alcohol was also enormous. The beer started too cold to really get a take of it's flavor, so I let it sit for a while. It almost hard to describe how it tastes. It's jst so flavorful, with loads of carmel/ brown sugar sweetness balanced by almost a spicey note. It all works. It's a sipping beer, and really you can only have one. Alcohol is extremely high, but you can drink this beer easily over the course of an hour, so you don't get blasted right away. I will by this again, but only as a treat on a cold winter night."
"This is nice enough but I wouldn't put it in my top tier...the alcohol on the finish is a bit much and overall the flavors while nice are not strong enough for this style in my opinion for it to hit my upper tier.."
"D - For a quad, this is pretty drinkable. It still is a bit of a struggle to finish it. It is a good beer that many would like, a good beer that I won't soon buy again."
"This beer pours a cloudy, murky brown, with an abundance of yeast settling in the glass. Smells complex and fruity, and the alcohol is very detectable here. There is an inital sweetness upon tasting, a malty, and honeylike uniqueness. It is thin with a slight coarseness (possibly due to the lingering yeast) and medium carbonation. Very nice balance of sweet and bitter, there are lots of hidden flavors in this one that are difficult to identify. Strong on alcohol, but like a Quadrupel should be. This is a fine example and I will have to drink a few more of these..."
"Unlike any beer Ive tasted before. Big alcohol presence carries a symphony of vinous flavor and aroma. Superb."
"Other than appearance and drinkability, this beer is almost perfect. I still think that considering the strength of 11.3% abv, it is extremely drinkable. The aroma is sweet floral malt with the smell of barley, hay and some fruitiness like cherries or apples. Amazingly smooth pleasant mouthfeel. Taste is well balanced and smooth. All of the elements in the aroma are present on the palate. A beautifully crafted beer."
"drinkability: very nice. i was surprised at how i really wished i'd had another one on hand despite the alcohol content."
"Notes: Simply an amazing beer. It isn't too sweet, not too bitter, perfectly complex."
"good drinkability for such a beefy beer. quite an experience, and something that should be sought out. i myself find that it's nice to come back to these beers once in a great while, if i had them too often, other stuff might not taste so good anymore."
"The aroma was wonderful and only got better as it warmed. Molasses and raisin, a lot of malt, not much hops. Definitely some alcohol. The taste got MUCH better as it warmed; take home message is don't crack this one from the fridge. Pretty intense carbonation hits you at first, a bitter, acidic taste but it fades very quickly, leaving a complex taste of yeasts, malt, almost molasses, bready grain taste, alcohol, small hints of dark fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent, with a very unique smoothness that developed with tempterature. It was extremely full-bodied, with a subtle semi-sweet aftertaste that was excellent. This is one of the finest, if not the very best quad I hve ever tasted. Try it, you'll like it."
"Personally, I enjoy Rocheforts 'light' weights a little more. In terms of other quads, it's a little more potent, with a slightly lighter body than most."
"There is no beer I'd rather drink than Rochefort 10. It is my favorite ale, hands down, and always on stock in my cellar."
"Well done!"
"Mouthfeel: I don't know how you could find a fault with this beer, let alone the mouthfeel, damn good. This beeer could be laid down for years and have a whole new experience to offer. A wonderful Trappist ale."
"Fantastic stuff here."
"Drinkability: This is a very big beer. With that said, this beer is wonderful. The huge alcohol content 11.3% does not dominate. It instead plays with the team of sugars, spices and general goodness."
"This beer feels great on the palate. It has a full body, and is moderately heavy on the palate. The level of carbonation in this beer complements the flavor of the beer. Overall this beer is great. If you haven't tried it find yourself a bottle and get some. I think that this bottle was worth the five dollars I paid for it and I would definitely buy it again."
"Prepare to walk on roundheels!"
"(Edit: After trying several beers within this style during a blind tasting on May 21st, 2007, Rochefort 10 was the unanimous, clear-cut winner.)"
"Excellent, estimable, enticing..."
"Rocking good beer. Im beyond thrilled to have a steady supply just one block from my place of business."
"Got a great deal on this bottle since a rep was in the store giving out samples, but even if it was full price it would have been worth it. Incredibly complex brew with some fantastic unique flavors. Find it and buy it. Now."
"This is a well crafted brew and worthy of praise."
"Smooth, mellow mouthfeel with fast moving carbonation. Goes down easily and attacks each and every taste bud in the mouth. Not to seem too gluttonous...but I could easily have a few of these in one sitting. Simply an amazing beer that left me wondering why I hadn't tried it sooner. One of a kind, amazing, a beautiful creation. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. If you have yet to try this...go and do it now...you will not be disappointed. I will be picking some more up for myself ASAP."
"-UF"
"well, an absolutely exceptional brew. not quite a 5 to me, but pretty damn close. goes down quite easily, but at 11.3%abv two (ok, maybe three) would be enough. wow!"
"This brew pours a solid dark brown color with a small creamy off-white head. The aroma is fruity with brown sugar peaking through. The taste full of spices and fruit. There is also a high alcohol presents. The mouthfeel is full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a mighty tasty brew."
"A gross, one-dimensional syrupy mess of a beer. I've had this 2 or 3 times, thinking maybe my taste buds were off or I got a bad bottle, and I remain very unimpressed. For the same cost, I can get a 750ml bottle of Unibroue Trois Pistoles or a 220z'er of Avery Reverend, both of which are vastly superior products and infinitely more enjoyable."
"D: Very easy to drink. Complex, but in a well-balanced way. Nothing unsettling or unpleasant anywhere to be found. LOTS of flavor. Seriously good beer."
"I'm enjoying with some Roaring '40's blue cheese... very nice."
"D - As I originally thought during my summertime tasting, this beer is not my favorite quad by a longshot. Its tastes are all huge, but for a sipping beer, there could be better balance. Don't get me wrong the beer is quite good, but there is no real evidence of the subtlety that makes a good beer great."
"Notes: Well I am now officially a Rochefort fan. Duvel was always my favorite Belgian but I think the Rocehfort 10 and 8 which I tried a few nights ago both take the top spot."
"Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights. Large, tan colored head sits atop the liquid. Its fairly clear, and looks quite enticing in a Belgian chalice. The aroma is full of malt, alcohol and phenols. The smell is a little harsh. I expected a more sublimely blended and dovetailed aroma. Its a very satisfying and full smell, but its sort of rough-hewn. Peppery and earthy. The taste is sweet, with considerable malt. Its got yeasty, estery, fruity flavors as well. Alcohol warming is notable. All the flavors are quite intense. This is a very satisfying, enjoyable, intense brew. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it doesnt quite stand up to its reputation."
"it aint rated this highly for nothing.. this is no poser, and honestly it is a little different than other easy to get belgians (at least around these parts). Worth it. Get it. Drink it."
"Truly a wonderful beer! Perhaps even a new favorite!?"
"Drinkability: One to be appreciated. The alcohol is a little too prominent for my likes. It does mellow which is cool. Glad I tried it, strongly recommended, but for the price I probably won't be back anytime soon."
"By the way, did I say this beer was smooth?"
"Rochefort 10 sits ominously in my Chimay chalice, a murky dark brown, a small skim of of bubbles on the top and a pretty ring around the edges. I always find it hard to begin drinking big beers like this--it's a challenge and I fear I'll be found wanting. Oh well, judgement time. It smells spicy, with prominent licorice, prunes, and raisins. The flavor is similar to the nose, with a little hoppiness and a bit of a medicinal quality. Big, thick mouthfeel. I like the 8 better, but as Quadrupels go, this is better than the Allagash Four I had recently."
"EDIT: Next time I'll be brief - the ABV must have gotten to me."
"Certainly a desert beer, but not one that relies soley on sweetness. The beer continues to develop with each successive sip and as the beer warms. Remarkably easy to drink seeing how malt dominant the beer shows. A magical beer that defies modern brewing logic."
"Hazy dark brown with a tan head, which quickly diminished to a thin layer of foam. Aroma of raisins, prunes, and sweet apples. The flavor is definitely complex - the different flavors this went through as it warmed was pretty impressive. It seemed every time I took a sip, I tasted a new flavor. Spicy / peppery / yeasty flavor was present throughout. Absolutely no alcohol harshness - I was amazed to see this beer was 11.3 ABV - just a nice warming effect A must try."
"Everyone should try this beer if they get a chance. Outstanding."
"I feel like I should be drinking outdoors, in the northwoods, sitting on a pile of recent pine bark shavings or on a farm, amid the crackle of cornstalks and the notion of autumn or in a coffeeshop, under the tumult of progressive poetry. Is this beer or a connection? The heady aromas of kirschwasser and chocolate creme and stone corridors aren't enough to alert the rest of the senses to the experience of tense honey and herbs. It reminds me of sharing warm times with friends, of rainy winter days wrapped in a comforter with my beloved. Beyond beer it seems."
"First sip reveals a smooth silky body and mild carbonation that is almost non-existant. Flavor is sweet from start with toffee, brown sugar, raisins, and red grape these all mix nicely. There is a bit of peppery hot alcohol on the finish that makes the beer a bit of a sipper. A nice rich beer, just dont try to drink it too fast!"
"A beer with great balance and complexity. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: I made the mistake of taking this one out of the fridge and having some of it a few minutes after, and of course I wasnt too impressed. It was too cold and all of the characteristics were muted with the exception of an herbal, alcoholic harshness. When I realized what was wrong, I set it aside for a little while and let it warm up a bit, and it was practically a different beer. I then understood why this beer is rated so highly. Sure, its pricey, but you get what you pay for. And its a small price to pay for an occasional luxurious treat like this."
"A fantastic sipper, I enjoyed this after a particularly long workday. While this is eminently drinkable, you'd be nuts (and well-off, financially) to session-drink this one. The abv would definitely kick your ass. Still, it's an excellet after dinner beer, or a treat after a long, trying day."
"Simply wonderful and worthy of being ranked among the top five beers in the world!"
"Butterd toffee and chocolate, cherries, currants and alcohols. Opaque brown with little head. I get a lot of alcohol. Probalby bacuase the best before date is in 2009. Fairly sweet with some of the dark fruit character. I think its pretty thin and there is quite a bit of burn. It hangs around a bit and kind of stings the back or my throat. I think Ill go get a couple more bottles and re rate later. Ther price here wasnt too bad. $5.99 a bottle."
"I would say this is a great beer and I highly recommend it. One of the better beers I've had."
"A purdy ale in my St. Bernardus glass. A dark reddish brown ale with some murkiness from those lovely yeasties, lovely. The aroma took me off guard a little bit, I expected the nose to have some alcohol to the nose, I mean it is 11.3%, but man I got the first wiff of sweet candy sugars but then the alcohol burned its way in to my nostrils. The sweetness hits my tongue like Ike Turner. I can detect raisins and what seems like brown sugar and caramel battling it out too, but the alcohol quickly soothes all of the activity. This puppy coats your mouth wonderfully. The flavors really pick up as this dude warms, I am glad that I am taking my time with this one. The alcohol makes drinkability an issue but overall I am happy with my first Rochefort experience."
"At between six and eight dollars a bottle, I won't be drinking this all that often, but I look forward to enjoying maybe 6 a year."
"Taste is... not bad. But not living up to the hype. Raisiny, sweet, pruney. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Mouthfeel is bubbly, medium-bodied, feels good. Pretty drinkable, but overall too sweet to be extremely drinkable. I liked this better when it warmed up, but overall I was disappointed. Perhaps I got a young bottle- who knows. Still, a good beer, and very sneaky at 11 percent."
"Deep brown and hazy with a medium tan head that leaves generous lace on the chalice and sticks around til the bitter end. Complex, warm aroma with lots of malt (caramel and toffee), a deep fruitiness, and vinous alcohol, but it still stays fairly soft and mellow. Wonderful flavours as well, with the caramel and toffee maltiness joined by a light roasted character. Ripe fruit as well as a bit of chocolate (mainly as it warms) and sugary sweetness. Finishes with plenty of alcohol warmth. Full body and high carbonation to start, but this reduces quickly. Airy texture with a drying and slightly grainy texture. This is fast becoming my favourite line of trappist beers. Excellent complexity and balance, big flavours yet still remains mellow. A joy to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is perfect, coats the entire palate with fruity flavor, only to rapidly fade away. This perfection makes it difficult to not drink too fast."
"Drinkability: Extraordinarily smooth with so much going on"
"This is definitely a beer to savor."
"Very nice. So much going on in this beer. No idea even where to begin and do it justice. Pours very black, with almost a purpish tinge. Color of liquid toffee. Slight head with some heavy carbonation. But that carbonation receded upon sipping to feel heavy and soothing on the palate. Extremely full and broad feel to this flavor. Whole lot of things happening in the flavor. Very candy like--toffee, caramel, chocolate, and mounds of Belgian sugars. Yeast is very prevalent too and provides a very nice plum flavor. Aroma is more of the plums. Alcohol is also quite strong but does nto detract from the drinkability because this beer is so full of flavor."
"This beer is just way too complex to try to distill its qualities into words. You have to experience it yourself. You won't be disappointed."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and viscous, with aromatic and gustatory qualities that beg to be savored. Everything a trappist quadrupel could ever hope to one day become."
"Overall:"
" The taste is of figs, dark cherries, a leathery dryness percieved at the back of one's tongue, and brown sugar. This needs some time in my cellar, methinks. The mouthfeel is thick, but it is not cloying. Drinkability is high. The taste is so complex, I want to sip, and sip again to discover everythig this brew can offer."
"Maybe twice."
"The stuff is darker than pepsi, smells like bubblegum, tastes like a big smooth latte, has no aftertaste and conceals the alcohol better when it is warm. I have never had Westvleteren 12; that being said, this is the best I have ever had. ALl beer snobbery aside, in my mind, you can keep the strong scotch ales and imperial stouts. This is the beer for real men.(and women)."
"The perfect end of a marinated grilled chicken meal with all the trimmings! Cheers from Mid.-Missouri Carpe diem."
"Amazing deal at Volo, $9 for one of the suckers. Pours a dark mahogany brown, pretty hazy, big head forms and goes but leaves a metric ass tonne of lacing. Smell is amazingly complex; almost weissbier like banana/clove esters and phenols abound, grapefruit, oaky vanilla, lots of malt, slight hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy, banana and clove once again, alcohol, earthy, oaky vanilla again, tastes oak aged, honey, a little bitterness from the hops but those take a back seat. Almost an armagnac vinousity (word?) to it, amazing. Very full mouth, warms all the way down, thick and chewy, perfect carbonation. This is one killer beer."
"Pours a dark brown with a hint of red. Nice small to medium bubbles. Got yeast in the glass even with a careful pour and leaving almost an inch in the bottle. It seems the yeast jumped into suspension when the bottle was opened due to the heavy carbonation. Sweet grape/pear, sherry, and yeast in the nose. Taste resembles the nose with the sherry flavor standing out over the others. Not overpowering, but distinct sherry overtones. Dry finish, slightly tart. Nice blend of flavor. The head is ever replenishing and maintains throughout drinking. Zero lacing on the glass? Looks can be deceiving on this one. Ignore the chunks of yeast and enjoy this one."
"Deep, dark brown in colour with minimal head. Notes of caramel, raisins, and nuts. Flavors are more powerful with elements of port wine, prunes, chocolate, and dark berry fruit. Perhaps theres just a touch of alcohol flavor in there as well. Probably too rich for more than one bottle at a time, or even one bottle per week, but this is still a masterpiece of brewing."
"Notes: This is a highly rated beer that many other people evidently appreciate more than me. I guess it just comes down to personal taste..."
"I haven't been overly taken with the quarupels and tripels, but still, this is impressive."
"Drinkability... excellent beer. I would have it again. Not the absolute best quadrupel I have had, but very high up there."
"I'd drink this until I burst..."
"This beer poured from the bottle a slightly hazy medium brown/dark amber in color. It was topped by a thick, clumpy tan head that retained for more than 10 minutes in my glass. The nose has bread dough up front followed by spice (coriander/allspice a hint of white pepper). It has layers of citrus (grapefruit/orange/lemon), and is finished by figs and dates from the malt. The taste has more of the bread dough followed quickly by the spice and citrus. The citrus combines with the malt in the flavor to produce red wine like flavors. Dark berries, plums, accompanied by slight alcohol warming. Wow! Amazing flavor, much more than even the nose indicated. Slick, lightly heavy mouth feel, decent drinakbility."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights with plenty of yeast sediment. Head is tan and initially large but quickly turns to a small sustained head. Nose is a medley of sugar, spice and everything nice including dark fruits and chocolate. The taste is one of the most complex beers I have ever had. The flavors are all over the board. Flavors noted include candied sugar, bananas, hint of pepper, dark fruits, finishing with a nice dry hop. Mouthfeel is creamy and full with a high amount of carbonation to light up the palate even more. Overall drinkability is near perfect. The only mark against this brew is the high ABV warms me up a bit too much after each taste. But nonetheless this is the 2nd best beer I have sampled yet!"
"This is one of my favourite trappists along with Orval."
"Overall - an exceptional brew. Would be in my top 10..."
"Edit: D/199"
"Just as flavorful and robust as I remember. Cherries, prunes, banana, and dark chocolate are the most prominent flavors this round. This beer scores a solid 4.5 for taste and double 5's for mouthfeel and drinkability. Simply a wonderful brew. Only disappointment is the lack of initial head."
"All in all, an outstanding beer. Enjoyed it with some Cotswold cheese and was not disappointed."
"Mouthfeel is medium with enough biting carbonation to keep it clean. Reminds me more of a Belgian strong dark ale than a quad. I would love to try this fresh on tap, my rating would probably be higher than the small bottle. Many thanks to futaboots for rescuing a bottle for me."
"Rochfort has sweet aromas of brown sugar and ripe fruits- plums and dates- I also detect some chocolate and liquorice there and the alcohol you would expect of a beer of this strength. Full bodied and lightly spiced with a dry vinous finish. alcohol well concealed. this gets better every time i drink it, it completely blows me away. My first perfect score."
"It was nice !"
"Phenomenal. Truly the most incredible and complex beer I've ever had. Just an amazing barrage of flavors, each standing noticable, but none towering over the others dominantly. The flavors work well together, chasing each other and blending into each other, only to re-emerge as a subtly redefined version of their prior selves."
"Overall: I thought this beer was definitely solid, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. To me I prefer St. Bernardus. I thought the alcohol was a bit out of balance in this beer and that caused me to downgrade it slightly. Believe me I like high abv. beers as much as anyone, i just thought it ""stuck out"" to me above all other flavors. I may have served it on the warm side though, so I'll give it another shot soon. I'd still recommend it though and would search it out to try it."
"Thanks!"
"Poured into a goblet a dark brown haze, heavy in suspended particulates, very pale brown at the edges in the light. Nose is brown sugar, raisins, and malty alcohol. Taste is malt and alcohol. I love these big beers that have a sweet whiskey feel on the tongue. Dark fruit, molasses, and an alcohol finish make this a delicious concoction. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but doesn't detract from the experience. If it weren't for the damned ABV, I'd sit and drink beers like this all night. Excellent."
"As always, thanks for sharing Gabe."
"don't drink it cold. it says on the bottle to drink between 54-58 degrees, but it is fine even warmer than that. i couldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting but definately awsome to have on special occasions."
"Bottle dated for use by 04-08-09. Pours a dark depp brown with a extremely bubbly head that dissipates to nothing in no time at all. Aroma is very enticing--hints of dark rum, cherries, pepper, raisins, chocolate, plums. Taste is absolutely wonderful--- thick molasses like malts mixed with peppery spices and a warming alchohol sensation. Mouthfeel is full and thick, just coating your mouth with the flavorful goodness. This is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"taste: bitter dark malts hit you like a brick. finish is smooth thanks to the richer figgy notes. mouthfeel matches with a hefty luxury... like pureed fruit. approaching cognac in its caramel-meets-alcohol-sting-in-wood complexity. a sipper and perfect for near-room temperature. remarkable how something this sweet lacks that yeasty tartiness. it does, its an achievement."
"Thanks to HardTarget for generously sharing this stellar beer."
"Qradrupel beers are sippers, not quaffers. I enjoy them whenever I can. This beer was pricey (5.99 a 11.2 Oz.)but I can now state it is worth the price."
"All in all, well worth the three pounds or so I paid for it, and the long walk across town to get it. Especially when I consider that I'll probably end up paying more than that for a bottle of Budweiser in a bar later tonight. Cheers"
"Drinkability is incredible, I have drank several of these over the last couple months and I can't seem to get it enough. I could probably drink this everyday I think and never get sick of it."
"Strong brew overall, considering the price it's not ""drinkable", but ultimately is. If my typing is any indication at this point you'll come to know the alcohol quite quickly."
"Bottle, best before sometime in 2009 (hinting that I shouldn't be drinking it just yet). I shouldn't be rating this, as I am recovering from a cold, however I decided to go ahead anyway because I think the beer has aided in my recovery. Only disappointment in the appearence was the small head. What was there laced pretty well. Deep effervescent chocolate amber colour made up for the disappointing head. Aroma, um, well, big! Spices, toffee, raisins, flowers, alcohol... Taste - um, well, huge! And it needs to be to get in before the alcohol which is considerable and smacks you in the face at the finish. Despite the big, warm, dry, (kinda like Australia) alcoholic finish, the balance remains very good, which is a big achievement. I think this is assisted by the fine carbonation which leads to a lush yet subtle feel. Would love to taste the same batch in 2009 to see what has changed. Think I might head back to the beer shop."
"Awesome."
"A bit of preface: my first experience with beer of this caliber was St. Bernardus Abt 12. I thought it couldn never be matched. Since then, I've seen numerous threads such as ""St. Bernardus vs. Rochefort"" or ""Westvleteren vs. St. Bernardus."" I haven't come across the Westy yet, but the Rochefort is always around so I thought I'd give it a try and see if it lives up to the hype. Let's crack this puppy open... Appears a very dark brown color, practically opaque with a big dark head resting on top, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Incredibily fragrant nose. A sweet cake-liek aroma out front, but no ordinary cake. It tingles your nose with hints of alcohol and spicyness. If this tastes as good as it smells I'll be a very happy man... Oh man it's good. Instead of comparing it to St. Bernardus it's really quite different. I can actually taste the alcohol in this and the spicy hops as well. Still the overriding taste is the sweetness, complex as it is, but there's a nice peppery quality to this beer that I didn't anticipate. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with the perfect amounth of carbonation. I don't know what it is, but there certianly is a distinct trappist feel to this beer that I wish I could identify and put into words, but I can't. For now I'll just enjoy it."
"Exceptional mouthfeel, but the high alcohol is too present in the taste to make this an easy-drinking beer. It's exceptional, nonetheless."
"The taste is great. The first sip is a little overwhelming because of all the tastes, but as you take more and more they go down much smoother. Alcohol is the first taste that you get, but then the beer effervesces on your tongue and the taste dissipates leaving behind a pleasant wheaty mouthfeel. As far as Trappist Quadruples this is debatable the top, and it is true to its reputation."
"My thanks go to John at Federal Wines & Spirits for donating a bottle of this exceptional beer."
"Carefully fruity, rich, sublime and at once captivating in the sensuality it exudes. A remarkable brew."
"330 mL, bottled on 8/4/04. The bottle overflowed with foam when I popped the top - really sucks when you're paying $7 for less than 12 oz. of this stuff. Served just under room temp. in a Chimay chalice. Pours a cloudy dark red/brown with a fizzy, 1 finger, tan head that doesn't leave much lacing but doesn't disappear either. Smell is rum bread, cherries, bananas, green apples, and maybe a hint of chocolate. At first the carbonation is tingly but is very nice by the end. And so many flavors on the palate... cherries, plums, apples, bananas, pears?, citrus?, coriander?, chocolate, rum, pine, yeast... whew! The beer also alternates between buttery/sugary/sweet and a somewhat powerful bitterness, both of which complement the other flavors well. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but very warming. Pairs perfectly with milk chocolate. If I drank another of these right now I would be out another 7 bones but I would be oh so happy....and very intoxicated."
"Drinkability: Good, but at almost $8 for an 11.2, it's simply too pricey to be ""drinkable."" Still, it's nice to have the real deal, and the beer is really well balanced, it's controlled, complex--it's just flat-out good. If you can bear parting with the cash, it's quite a beer."
"I got a chance to try this beer, this past weekend. ive never been disappointed by a trappist ale yet, and the rochefort 10 was no different. A wonderful aroma of black current filled my nose as i looked at this glass of dark brown nectar, sitting with a little less than a half inch tan head. The flavor, smooooth and rich, the alcohol doesent dominate the glass, wonderful balance. I enjoyed this with some nice cheese, savoring it like a 20 year tawny port. The trappistes really do some amazing things with yeast water malt candy sugar and hops.Any one who calls themselves a BA should consider the five trappist breweries offerings required drinking, they wont regret a sip of it"
"Well, I'm not going to argue the glowing reviews this special beer has gotten. Perfect in every way but drinkability, which is a good thing at $9 a pop. Pours black as night with a tight, tan head, that won't go away over the hour or so you'll spend sipping it. What a fantastic smell - prunes, raisins, molasses, and cherries. I'm going to put a couple in my cellar and see if this outstanding brew gets even better with age..."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown into my wine glass with some sediment floating around. No head to speak of but given the abv that's to be expected. Nose of fruits - plum, blackcurrant - and alcohol. Taste is of rich sweet malts with some yeasty notes and backed with strong plum and blackcurrant flavours and finishing with warming alcohol. Very nice mouthfeel with delicate carbonation. This is a lovely beer and one which I have had a number of times of ocassions and will continue to come back to. Surprisingly drinkable given its abv. Paired nicely with some French brie."
"It has a luxurious, silky mouthfeel. While the alcohol is obvious, it's in the right place and doesn't intrude. Very drinkable in small quantities - like, one bottle as a nightcap with some stinky cheese."
"Notes: It's almost as if the monks got two or three normal beers and concentrated them into this complex ale. This is such a mysterious beer that people could likely imagine many other flavours than actually exist. However, it's not my favourite style, and not my favourite Trappist ale: Westmalle (Tripel) is much more friendly and accessible (in flavour, not price or availability) to most people. But this beer is best reserved for special occasions and lazy winter nights."
"Immense beer! Smooth, fruity and extremely well balanced. I certainly prefer this over the 8, this was more complex and more satisfying. Rich on everything, lacks nothing."
"A WORLD CLASS BEER."
"I'll be visiting with this brew again."
"The yeast, and plum like flavors are still there when tasted. There's a lot going on here, very complex. The full bodied mouthfeel works together with the carbonation. There's some twinge from the alcohol, but it isn't out of place and the warming effect is perfect for a cold night. However, the high abv makes this one a slow sipper."
"all in all a very very nice belgian."
"Just a classic Belgian strong ale. A great mix of dark chocolate, malt and fruit. Yum, yum, give me some more."
"P.S...I'm editing and giving this a perfect score, cuz I believe this is THE most interesting, and best beer I ever had!...an ABSOLUTE MUST, in my book!"
"Not that drinkable to be honest. A sippin' brew for sure. Need me some more."
"Beautiful beer all around but be careful having too many of these in a row as they may impair your ability to taste and rate any other beers accurately."
"Flavors of rich malt and yeast are followed by dark plum and strong alcohol and a bitter earthy aftertaste. The alcohol is a little too powerful in the finish. Overall this is an intense beer with very complex flavors and moderate drinkability. Definatley one to seek out."
"Been waiting to try this for a while, looked really good. Pours a nice dark brown body with some hints of ruby in the light. Huge light tan head, great retention all the way to the end. Very sweet smelling, lotsa malt in here. Think I smell a grape aroma too. Very smooth, though a slight tinge of alcohol taste at the roof of the mouth, I don't really mind that. Tasted better as it warmed up. Very warming as it went down, I haven't had many beers that do that. Mouthfeel is pleasent, almost velvety. Great beer!"
"Couldn't wait to have this highly lauded brew. It poured with a deep brown and opaque body with a head that was cloudy, tannish, and substantial. The nose is alluring with notes of raisin, malt, and/or plum. The mouthfeel is almost chewy but also has a juicy texture. The fullness is also there. I mostly sense a raisin and brandy-like character that is complemented nicely by a juicy malt kick. You can finally get a sense for that high alcohol content right at the beginning of the finish. Mostly you get a continued raisin and plum layer that is balanced by a nice little bitter balance about midway through the finish. By mid-bottle, you realize how much of a belly warmer this really is. Truly a world class beer. Ah the trappists!"
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is great. It has a very rich and intense roasted malt scent that boasts of roasted barley and Belgian caramel malts; very nice. It is sweet and dry. The taste is good. It has a creamy, yet powerful brown ale flavor with lots of caramel malts and a tart yeast finish. It goes down smooth and is surprisingly thin and dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied brew with adequate carbonation. This is a great tasting brew with lots of enticing malt aroma. I wish it had a little more body, but otherwise it's a good drinker."
"Drinkability: Best beer I've ever had? I dunno..definitely not the most available or most practical, considering it's price and availability in the area. Is it worthy of being rated the 10th best beer in the world? absolutely. 11.3% ABV packed into an astoundingly complex Belgian such as this.. Meant to sip and enjoy, a pinnacle of the style and of beer in general."
"After a new batch of this came in (the first batch imported to the US since by Merchant du Vin as opposed to Shelton Bros), my judgement has changed. This beer knocks the socks off of any other beer I've ever tasted. Has a nice bubblegummy taste and aroma with a plethora of fruity esters. Just the perfect balance between sweet, dry, and bitter. Just enough alcohol punch to get you a nice buzz without going overboard. By the way, it seems much less boozy this time through to the point where it is damn near chuggable. I must stock up on this stuff."
"Excellent ale, just a bit heavy on the alcohol, not hidden very well."
"i love belgians, and so i'm hoping this was a bad bottle or that perhaps <gasp> my taste was off today. maybe i will try it again but from a different source."
"The only think I can really ding it on is drinkability; even though the 11%+ alcohol is hidden pretty well, there is just a little harshness that comes through. Nothing that should steer anyone away from having this on their 'best beers' list."
"In my opinion, this beer is a little better than the St. Bernardus 12. Like my brother said, it is a bit 'like drinking liquid applepie'. A magnificent brew."
"I will have to admit at first try I was not very impressed with this one. I read all the reviews and thought that this had to be better so I went out and bought alot more of them. I found out that with this and all other trappist beers you have to be really careful at which temperature you serve this at. Ounce I got that down I found the dark appearance rather inviting. After talking to many belgium people at the different festivals I found that many of them like this it's just what they call a beerwine. So I took that to heart and treated it like wine before every drink I will swish it around and smell it, for me that is enough, I'm in love. The taste is phenomenal with just that right bitter taste that from much research comes from the water. The fruitiness of this is bar none only to westvleteren which also has a distinct fruity taste. For convenience though I stick with rochefort. For anyone looking for a top notch beer that will surprise them from aroma till aftertaste this is a must have."
"I'd go on to say some more, but I think I'm going to savour the rest of this drink."
"The beer is dark brown with some red with lingering sediment running about the glass. The chunky, bubbly cream-colored head dissipates slightly but is retained in about a 2mm thickness throughout the drink. Lacing is present and sturdy but not overwhelming. Carbonation is certainly evident upon first sip but its run over with a rummage of caramel, paper early, yeast, fruitiness, and tempered hops. The smell is as busy as the taste. Taste is light spice, molasses, raisin, maybe plum. The 10 is eminently creamy smooth and drinkable considering its ABV. Goodness. Top shelf. Beer heaven. Praise the Belgian monks."
"3. Don't tell anyone I'm here."
"Based on other reviews, not to mention my previous tasting of Rochefort 8 (plus St. Bernardus 12), I'm wondering if I got a bum bottle. Not that this isn't good, it's just that nothing jumps out at me. Based on the price this one, I could get twice the amount of beer for less than twice the cost by buying the St B 12..."
"Like a Cohiba Siglo V, if I could afford to drink this every day I would. For now Ill settle for once a month"
"Poured into an Ommegang chalice, formed a 1/2"" creany beige head above the whirling burgundy brew. Head hasn't moved in five minutes, and the heavy foam lacing looks great. Interesting fruity, esterous aroma. Taste takes the aroma to another level. Smooth malt character quickly gives way to flavors of banana and other fruits, with a slightly spicy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tremendous, and drinkability is excellent as well. Scarily drinkable for 11.3%, the alcohol hardly comes out at all, except for the subtle warming after you've had a few mouthfuls. A must try, and revisiting will be inevitable."
"Drinkability is a shortcoming, but only because of its ABV. If it wasn't so strong, this would be 5's across the board (but only because it doesn't go to 11)!!! By the way, did I mention that I like this beer?"
"man this is good for being 11.3% ABV! pours a dark cloudy brown with a nice thick, creamy tan head. lacing is pretty nice too. i smell malt heavily and apple, maybe some caramel. taste is good malt flavor with alcohol. it is very smooth for how strong it is. the aftertaste is definitely alcohol. mouth feel is great along with drinkability. i could definitely drink another. this is a great brew but i can't buy it again. $6.99 for an 11.2oz bottle is a little steep."
"Pours a foggy burnt sienna with a beautiful off-white head. Carbonation comes up the sides so perfectly it's ridiculous. Smells amazing. Very fruity and woody. Hint's of vanilla and cocoa and even some dark soda. Very complex smelling. Tasty perfectly spicy and sweet. A brilliant mix of flavors. Nutty, gingerish tastes explode into the mouth. The sweet malts are so well balanced with the bitter hops it blows my mind. The more I drink the more flavor arises showing brand new sides of the beer. This a not just a drink. This is not just a beer. This is heaven summed up in 11.2 ounces."
"Intensely sweet. Astonishing layers of dark fruit - figs, prunes, raisins & dates. A touch of chocolate is followed by a firm bitterness. Finishes with some slightly herbal flavours. Dry, pleasantly astringent & warming. Robust carbonation, medium-full bodied."
"33 cl bottle. Date code on bottle 06 02 07. Underneath the lable the beer is silk screened. I may have to soak off the label and seen what lies beneath. What a great beer. Nice complexity of flavors. Alcohol that contributes to complexity yet never overpowers the flavor and even in the aftermath of warming only adds to the appreciation of the beer, never detracts. I am unsure what I paid for this beer, but it was certainly worth every penny."
"This is easily the best beer I've ever tried."
"Drinkability: High ABV and price make it less drinkable than other quads."
"What a beer. The only negative thing you can say about this beer is that its not clear. Drinking this beer regulary its always looking like a snowstorm in my glass. But what the hell, great trappist smell, yeasty and malts. A nice and not too sweet taste and a good aftertaste with fine hops. Good trappist beer!"
"Was very surprised to find this rare beer around here, thank you Smokeless Joe's! Poured an impressive brown with a hint of plum and a lingering tan head. Smell was impressive as well, floral with plum and prune esters. Taste, this is worth noting, it started very stealthy, dark fruits, and some malts, but going down it is smooth, almost unbelivably so. The world slowed to a crawl around me and for what seemed like an eternity there was nothing be me and the beer. I heard a buzzing in my ears and noticed my friend what talking to me, I told him to give me a minute. It is a very complex beer with a velvety-smooth mouthfeel and I really must try it again to take it all in. Outstanding, if I could afford to drink this all day I probably would."
"Poured a dark, hazy brown with a larger brownish head. Aromas of spices, plums, and raisins. Tastes of spices, malts, fruity, plums, and lightly sweet. Complex aroma and tastes that work very well. Alcohol content hidden. Another quality beer from our monk friends!"
"These Quadrupels are rarely appropriate and always a little hard to cozy up to, but nothing else in life approximates the sense of danger and possibility contained in them."
"Best Belgian I ever had. Copper, with a beig head, albeit not a big one. Nose of caramel, fruit, and a whiff of alcohol. Creamy, smooth to the palate. Some complex fruity, caramel like flavors, but not a big alcohol push, belying the big content. Simply the best beer I have ever tasted."
"Drinkability: Tastes great, enjoyable world class beer, one of the best, but not one youre going to drink all the time."
"I've had this in the fridge for a couple of weeks now and it's now calling my name. Review 151. Pours a nice dark dark brown with a good size tan head. Aroma is of intense dark fruits and chocolate with just a note of alcohol. Taste gives no hint of alcohol, it's dangerously drinkable. Heavy notes of chocolate taper off into flavors of raisins. Very little after taste. This is one heavingly beer and one of the best quads I've yet to try. I'll be buying more."
"I've been looking for the right night to try this, and it seems today is the day. This beer pours a nice opaque brown with about a finger of head that sticks around for the show. What a nice malty nose. I get a full in my face sweet fig nose with an alcohol punch that reminds me more of a liquor than a beer. The flavor is nicely balanced. There is the malty fig flavor, but it is balanced with a caramel sweetness and a smokey char finish. What a treat. Well worth the hype and the wait to drink it. Now I have to convince myself to let it warm a bit more before I finish it to see what else is hiding in the nose and flavor. The beer is thick with just a hint of small carbonation. Drinkability is top notch. I could easily handle a few of these, even with the high ABV. Its nice and smooth, without an offensive alcohol to make me want to slow down on it. I will be getting this one again, and soon."
"A real disappointment for me. Where is the complexity? Just because it has alcohol doesn't mean it is good. No hops, and not all that much yeast character. I don't understand this beer."
"Ya know, for all the hype... I was kinda let down. Pours and looks like iced tea. No head whatsoever. Aroma is pretty nice, smells of raisins and a hint of something like Capt. Morgan rum. Taste is, well, kinda bland. A bit sweet, some alcohol is present. Nothing great, just good. Mouthfeel would be better if there was more carbonation. Maybe Belgians just aren't my thing. Maybe this was a bad bottle?"
"Mad props to stonecrusher for rocking my world."
"Comments: A very enjoyable big beer with multi-layered flavors. Outstanding."
"Drinkability: If I didn't have a talk to go to, this would have been a repeat performer there and then, regardless of the $10 price tag."
"This doesn't even remotely hide the alcohol content. It celebrates it. A delicious offering when it's all said and done."
"Deep brown color a light brown head with signs of light carbonation. The head diminished to a fine layer quickly leaving a nice band of lace around the glass. Aroma is initially astringent and wine like, but more complex smells and flavors emerge as the beer warms: fruity bubblegum notes, dried fruits and caramel and an earthy background. Flavor is complex and full: sweet fruity and caramel start with a quick tart middle and a lingering tangy hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with an alcohol finish and a surprising amount of effervescence."
"This bottle had a best by date of 14Jan08. Poured a deep, hazy brown, in my trappist glass, with a small head, which quickly dissipated, leaving a thin, creamy layer, along with moderate carbonation. I left the last 1/2 inch in the bottle, as it contained the majority of the sediment. Smell was warm, doughy bread, with raisins, prunes, alcohol, and a hint of coriander. Marvelous. Medium palate, with a lively carbonation. Flavor was dark fruits, similar to the smell, with a warm, moderately strong, alcohol bite and a mild acidic finish. Great stuff!! I can get more of this; however, at $6.99 for a 33cl bottle, I will limit my intake!!"
"If the Trappists are as correct about religion as they are beer, we non-Catholics better sign up for Catechism!"
"Full bodied, tingles the lips."
"330ml bottle. This poured out a cloudy brown color with reddish highlights. It had a decent sized tan head that quickly dropped to a coated of bubbles that left subtle lace around the glass as it was consumed. There was quite a bit of sediment left in the bottle after the pour as well. The aroma smells of malt sweetness, various fruits and a bit of an herbal earthy tone to it. There is also a couple of notes spiciness to the scent and a couple of other smells that were not identified. Leading the way in the taste is a fruity sweetness that is also accompanied by a doughy malt flavor and slight bit of spice. It has a bit of a dry finish and a buttery taste going on as well. Very refreshing to sip on this warm day and no trace of alcohol anywhere. Mouthfeel is rich and about medium to full in body. It goes down very easy and is a very balanced beer. A truly all around excellent beer, highly recommended to anyone. With the many complexities to this I will defiantly be having many more of these in the future."
"My only down point is that the alcohol is still a little out of balance. But, I guess thats the price you pay for all that flavour. Cheers to the Belgians!"
"Best by: 14-11-06... Poured a cloudy brown color with a small tan head and that left nice lacing on the glass. An intoxicating aroma of fruit (mainly cherries and apples) some pepper and butterscotch as well. Chocolate, plum, grape and currant were indeed noticed in the flavor. Alcohol seems to linger alittle on my lips and the tip of my tongue as well! But all in all this in a great brew, and I wish it wasn't so expensive!"
"Since the first time i've had this with a creamy brie, chunky houmous, a selection of anti pasto and ciabatta, it all worked very well"
"All in all, this is a wonderful beer. I would love to end my meal with one."
"this is one of those beers that you just have to try before you depart this frail existance. it may not be everyones cup of tea, but good golly, its a champion brew in anyones language. its the most expensive bottle on the shelf by a long way, but worth it to the last drop. a monument to beer and brewing is rochefort 10."
"Super smooth and drinkable for such a high ABV. Another great belgian sipper."
"Light brown and ruby highlighted look in the goblet with a dense tight light tan head. Very attractive. Sweet bread dough and dark caramel smell with hints of crushed raisens as well. Deep dark sour plum and pear taste upfront is then followed by a white pepper, allspice, and cooriander finish. Nice very smooth fuller mouth. A beautiful sippin beer!"
"I love me some Trappist ale and believe me folks this is a damn good example of one. Appearance: Deep murky amber brown mahogany nice finely bubbled tan head leaves a nice bread rising like thicket of head even after dwindling a bit, and the lacing is intricate and fine belgian style all the way. Aroma: Candi sugar, cloves, layers of complexity bombard the senses with some chocolate doughy bread notes, anise, fruit (over ripened fuices flowing). Taste: Awesome slightly tickles the nose with a slow alcohol burn on the first sip, and after that just ease in and enjoy the experience of sampling this fine brew. More cookie dough, yeast cakes, anise, chocolate very dark chocolate, and lucious fruit around the edges herbal hops evident. Mouthfeel: Sticky texutre but smooth and perplexing full bodied fine carbonation. Drinkability: A true godsend constructed in an Abbey can't beat this great brew, pricey but mindblowing awesome."
"But one whiff to sense the alcohol and yeast started decaying my perception of it. But still, seemed spicy and valid to drink. I went right on, and the overwhelming alcohol, poorly hidden, as well as the excessive, inadequate abundance of sweetness mixed with an oily mouthfeel repulsed me (slightly, not completely), and dropped my judgment immediately. Sad, I held this one til the last minute here in paris, unpurchased, waiting for a good surprise. I'm sticking to Chimay et co."
"Pours a deep brown, orange, amber color and makes a thin, yet condensed bubbly white head. Thick lacing down my Chimay goblet. Odor is rich of prunes, raisins, figs, very chocolatey... very nice. Flavor holds true of the boquet, very spicy, pruney, roasted chocolate malts, hint of currant and an alcoholic bite. Mouthfeel is medium to full, warms the pallate as it goes down, leaves a syrupy coat on the throat. This is a very drinkable beer, but like any Trappist should be savored... I think Rochefort 10 would go very nicely with a fine cut of beef."
"This is a highly warming sipper. It's like drinking chocolate except so much better. Not sure why this is a Quadrupel, I would've guessed Belgian Dark Strong. Very delicious."
"Great beer, will get it again if Westy is not available."
"A pleasure to drink, but at $8 for that one glass bottle not something I can consume often."
"Ruby red body is slightly hazy as I am careful about not pouring the yeast dregs in the goblet. The foamy head is about an inch and a half tall after the pour, and sticks around a while, being fed by very fine bubbles from the medium carbonation beneath. Nice lace is evident around the glass. The aroma is deliciously fruity, with plums, cherries, raisins, and licorice notes. The taste is delicately balanced between fruitiness of the malt and spiciness of the yeast. There are also notes of brown sugar on the palette. The mouthfeel is very creamy due to the fineness of the carbonation. It is incredibly smooth and drinkable with almost no hint of the underlying strength. This is a picture perfect mold from which other Belgian Strong Dark Ales are cast. But as usual, the imitations pale when compared to the brilliance of the original."
"A smooth, clean, refreshing body along with some moderate carbonation make this one all around good beer. Easy to drink. Delicious."
"Murky mocha colored with a dark beige head of tight bubbles that rises up and settles quickly, but leaves a thin film of foam atop. Aroma is sweet and enticing, of sweet malt, fig, cocoa, and spices. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, a little crisp and dry, leading to rich flavors of malt and plum, rounded out with currant, spices and prune. A bitter aftertaste lingers, followed by an alcoholic tingle. The alcohol lingers long into each successive sip, and detracts from the fine flavors wanting to burst through. An excellent beer, but much seems to be masked."
"It is because of beers like this that I have been forced to reassess what my favorite style is. I still like my stouts & porters, but damned if the Belgians arent getting the best of me."
" Sampled 12/14/03"
"Second tasting December 2004 and it met my desire again."
"Special stuff."
"I had this beer with a big grilled steak, and it went very well. Complex is an understatement, this is a very complicated, intriguing and wonderful beer. Drinking this is an experience, not just another quaff. I wonder what it takes to become a Trappist monk ? . . . . . I might just send them a resume."
"NICE!!!"
"A: <yes>."
"Had one of these with alexgash. Pours a mysterious murky dark brown, I'm not really sure what to expect here. Light dense Khaki colored head. Rich dark fruit, chocolate and raw malt aromas. Taste is wonderful. Rich chocolatey alcohol flavors mixed with mild dark fruits and an almost roasted quality. You could almost call this a Belgian Imp. stout. Instead of the hops we've got sweet flavorful yeast flavors coming through. Goes down so easy for being 11.3% as to be dangerous. A beer worthy of its praises."
"Huge creamy tan head atop this cloudy dark mahogany beer. Very sweet smells of raisins, plums and strong malts. Hints of alcohol spices. The taste of plums and raisins hit the palate first, followed by a peppery spice and a warming alcohol feel. Very sweet smooth tastes. The strong old malts finish this beer of quite well and add a bit of complexity. Dries in the aftertaste. In conclusion this is a delicious brew that I wish I could get ahold of more often."
"WOW!. Thats a damn good beer. I poured it into the glass and held it up to the light. It was dark as could be. Took a sniff and knew that it was going to taste great. This beer did not disappoint. I think the Belgian Strong Dark Ales are beginning to edge out the dubbels as my favorite style. I could drink this beer every day (3 or 4 times a day) and never grow tired of it. I believe I will have to run up to Richmond this weekend and find some more!"
"Which brings us to its drinkabilty - it has alot of that! Wow, very scrumptious, just thick enough, fluffy, and glides down with astounding ease. Moderate overall really, in my book, was hoping for a bit more and the Rochefort 8 I like just a bit more; still this is very quenchable and wouldn't pass it up for nothing. Price wise it might be? $8 for 11.2 ounces it's almost worth it here."
"A world apart from the tasty Rochefort 8, with much more complex flavors and higher drinkability. I think that the alcohol is handled much better here: even though it's more evident than the 8, it's also more flavorful and actually adds to the experience of the beer. Rochefort 10 may be the perfect beer to enjoy after dinner; treat it like some good whisky, pause, and relax."
"ng"
"$7.99 for a 11.2oz (yikes!)"
"meld of hops and malt. You can taste the alcohol but it does not interfere with the sheer pleasure of sipping a glass of this classic."
"Port-like with a refreshing effervescence. I could drink this beer for the rest of my life -- I wish it were not so expensive and hard to come by here in the Big Easy."
"This is drinkable and there are hundreds of beers that I would turn down to get one of these, but there are so many others that I think are better."
"The warming alcohol, while noticeable, is well within the overall balance of aroma and flavor. This is a nice rich Trappist to enjoy by the fire with fine cheeses, dessert, or just as a pleasant nightcap."
"A light brown, off-red hue, with a thick bubble-bath-like head, which acts as a layer throughout the body of this well crafted brew. On the nose, a tinge of alcohol, cotton candy, fruit, fresh flowers. Up front, chewy and a bit sugary, yet now over-dominating. Alcoholic presence off the top, again not too over-powering or distracting. Extremely well balanced and in tact. Everything in this brew appears to be in place, incredible flavorings in the way of bubble gum, cotton candy, plums, cocoa, some spices as it warms, even cloves and orange peel. A decent belly-warmer near the end, with some notes of smokiness, yeast and fresh baked bread. The alcohol effect is incredibly well hidden for the style/ABV, this one is almost addicting, near liquid perfection."
"Thick, creamy, light tan head almost makes it look like a nitro. There's a fair amount of stringy above the chocolatey brown beer. Rich alchoholic plum and raisins, mixed with chocolate bars and apples. I don't know if I've done the aroma any justice, but it's damn good. A mild blend of dark fruits, a bit of caramel, and some followed up my a lightly bitter and alcoholic finish. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a moderately full body. The 11% alcohol barely makes itself known. This is one great beer, just the right mix of flavors and aromas combined with a smooth drinking beer."
"So many flavors, such little amount of beer I have to find them all. That is what I thought about this beer. The complexity was staggering. 11.2 oz was not enough! But I can't afford any more than that. This was a very dark beer for a Belgian and it had a nice, frothy tan head to show its carbonation. Lots of lacing. Smell is strong and has a raisiny, bready flavor to it. Taste is just too complex to describe. It starts out with a tang hit of chocolate and caramel malts. Some floral hops come lightly into the mix. A bready character soon follows. Then fruity sensations run wild. Dark plums and raisins dominating my palate. A rum-like quality is there all along but only increases to epic proportions towards the end. Yeast is quite sour and extremely dry in the finish. This is a beer to savor and sip, very slowly. The only drawback was the price for this. At $10/bottle I can't afford too many of these!"
"Poured ruby and black into Rochefort goblet. Lots of beige colored flakiness in suspension hovering on the bottom of the goblet. Light brown foam. Lots of dark roasted candi sugar and malt in the nose, coffee and fruit. Taste is complex; smooth, rich and amazing. So many changes in the palate as one sips. Malt sweet and candi raisin and currant, yet maintaining a dryness that is fantastic. I've had this beer a couple of times and it's just really, really good. It's dated 26 08 08 (b.b. Aug 8, 2008), so it's kind of young, but with this beer that's good. Sparkling black Cristal..."
"Damn, now that was how to start off 2004! Given how long the monks at the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy have been brewing this beer, they certainly have got it fine-tuned. Truly a world-class beer."
"Pours very dark opaque, with barely visible hints of red visible in the light. Thick foamy head quickly recedes. The smell of this beer presents so many thoughts, but they all seem to meld together perfectly. The smells are subtle and elusive. Malts are present, with ints of chocolate, various fruits, coffee, and some meaty spices. The taste is very spicy, again almost meaty, with the chocolate hints again, and nutty coffee hints. The heavy carbonation of tiny bubbles gives it a dry mouthfeel which smooths out on the back. Amazingly I thought it was maybe 8% ABV until my brother told me that it was tipping 11%. This says alot for the drinkability of this beer. Simply an amazing beer."
"Pourred a dark brew with a nice foamy white head with excellent retention time. Complex aroma of spice and roastiness arose from my glass. Taste of spice is complex and alcohol taste is subtle which is great achievement at 11.3%. Body if full and support well the mix of spice from this beer. Always great to review a trappist beer when they are so perfect as this one clearly is. The only thing I can compare this to is Chimay red. Wow!!!"
"Top notch tipple."
"World class beer."
"This is a lightly hazy deep red - amber color when held up to the light. It is dark amber to brown otherwise. It is topped by a light brown head. Aromas of dark fruit, fruit-cake, and rum. The taste has a lightly spicy yeast character. There is a light sweetness, though this beer is fairly light bodied. Flavor notes of raisin and other dark fruit are under the spicy notes of this beer. The spiciness adds a complexity to this beer that was not in the 6, but I think that the 6 was better integrated than this beer."
"In mouth: Nice complexity, roasted notes, controled alcohol, sweet nectar, everything is well balanced in here"
"Overall Impression: What a great beer! The flavor just BLOOMS in your senses. Also has a wonderful cognac-like essence. Rochefort is truly one of the best Trappist breweries. World class!"
"I enjoyed this one much better than the Westy 12. In fact, this Rochefort 10 was the best I've ever had, anywhere, anytime. A sublime experience! Thus my first 5s across the board. Definitely worth the price of admission. Perfection in a bottle!"
"The best beer around? Perhaps, but I still haven't had Westy 12 yet."
"not that impressed with this one. upon pouring, it honestly looked like i just dumped a can of pepsi into my glass. it was perhaps the most carbonated brew i've ever seen. the head was bubbly as hell and disappeared instantly. still, it had a better than average dark ruby/brown colour to it. the smell was actually quite nice, incorporating malt, cherry and some other sweet smells. the taste followed suit with the smell but was a bit more syrupy than i expected and the carbonation that was so apparent in the pour was virtually gone. strange. there is a strong alcohol presence in the taste as well to the point that it is almost medicinal. needs to be toned down a bit methinks. overall, not that drinkable of a brew for $7 a pop. i'd be inclined to try it again just to see if perhaps i had a bad bottle, but it's nothing special in my eyes."
"This is damn near a perfect beer and that is despite its massive ABV. The 10 poured a odd group of colors. Stout black with a foggy white head at first glance. A closer look revealed the top of the glass to be more a brown color with the bottom opaque. Smell was insanely good. A huge bevy of aromas melded so well together. Swirls of licorice, chocolate, dough, a musty ""belgianesque"" note, and a spicy alcohol finish that tickled the back of my nose. The taste was even more intense if that is possible. Huge notes of alcohol and anise coupled with a bittersweet chocolate upfront with hints of toffee behind cascading into a tart cherry middle, which developed into a almost stout like malt finish without the volumonous mouthfeel. The addition of the yeast subdued the mouthfeel but melded and increased the intesity of all the flavors, especially in the aroma. If this is what being a monk is like(which I know its not) then you can sign me up!"
"Don't get much prettier no sir! A black hole of a brew, yet with a very faint, and I mean faint dollop of amber at the bottom of the glass. The head and lace are concrete structures. Aromas are very ripe and fruity, with melon at the forefront. Some botrytis aromas appear as well. The mouthfeel is very enjoyable-at once enveloping the entire mouth with warmth and bursts of barnyard flavors. Flavors are redolent of Blue Cheese-funky, moldy, fruity, yes very much blue cheese esc. I'd bet it would pair like a dream. A sweetness in the way of coffee with heavy cream and sugar adds to the complexity. All in all very wine like in flavor with great depth of flavor. The ever present fruity funkiness will not be for everyone, straight off that is. Yet, this is one that will grow on you for sure. I will re-edit it each time I taste it. Superior Stuff!"
"Appearance was dark brown with a creamy white head that held on to the last drop. Smelled of brown sugar and bruised apples. Tasted like dark roasted malts and had quite spectacular ester profile of sweet fruits and real sun dried raisins to go along with a slightly yeasty flavor. The mouthful was thick and creamy with a slightly oily tinge to the tongue. One of the first truly unique beers Ive ever had so many flavors intermingle to tantalize the pallet. Very hard to describe just how excellent this beer truly is."
"Dark amberish color,huge head that disappeared slowly, sweet fruity aroma,the chocolate coffeeiish taste comes through in a gust. Mouthfeel is not very smooth, alittle too much carbonation, but otherwise very special stuff.Taste got a little bitter at the end."
"And fill the order it did. Poured a murky cola brown. Aroma and flavors redolent of dark candied fruit - sort of like fig and rice crispy balls from childhood Christmas. Alcohol was there in force, but the flavoring level was not overdone and lent some pepper bite. Quite drinkable for the abv heft."
"Update  I have this occasionally and decided to re-review for 2004. I was able to pick up some tobacco at the nose to go along with all of the wonderful fruits. It seemed a little more boozy though then I remember so I shaved a half point off of the MF."
"When everyone speaks of Trappists, they talk about Westvleteren, and rightly so. However, Rochefort is every bit as good, and I think I enjoyed it even more!. A very underrated beer, and definitely a new favorite on my list!!"
"The alcohol warming is prominent."
"Deep black color, lacy head, big malty aroma. Malty and expansive. Candy sugar and alcohol. Fruit and spices. Complex flavor, but alcohol predominates. Warms the tummy well. Smooth taste. Excellent flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is malty and dry. Aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter with a definite alcohol bite. Great beer."
"Dark brown with dried blood highlights, near opaque. The off-white head is massively fluffy, solid as a rock, excellent retention lots of unorganized lace. Eye candy in my goblet! Mellow nose bubblegum esters, ripe bananas, light spice/pepper, alcohol. It is inviting but not that potent. Very tasty palate with loads of alcohol spiciness (upfront) that sizzles the tongue a pleasant pain! Peppery, lightly funky-medicinal the amount of bitterness is great. The maltiness is not as pronounced as I though it should be, lightly sweet like candied sugar. Exotic fruitiness. There are plenty of subtle complexities so delicious to drink! Medium body, firm carbonation yet the mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Long finish, more-ish aftertaste. This one is great and I wish I had more. Very Recommended!"
"The mouthfeel is really good, it's silky smooth and perfectly carbonated. However whopping in at this high abv. it might not be the most drinkable of them all."
"What a dissapointment. Medicinal, sour and bitter. I really don't see what all the hype is about. I hope this was just a bad bottle, but at 7 bones a pop I won't be giving it a retry any time soon. It looked nice, it smelled nice, but it tasted like cough medicine served in an ashtray after you just brushed your teeth. The beer did get better as it warmed, and the alcohol did make it a bit more palatable, but all in all I think it was a bad beer. After trying all the great Unibroue beers this one fell far short."
"(330 ml bottle). Pours with an enormous and thick light tan head, beer is cloudy, very dark brown colour. Heavenly complex aroma: oak, port wine, dried fruit and spices. 5.0 points for aroma/smell is not enough! Flavour is complex, spicy and oaky - toffee sweetness is well balanced with hops. Warming mouthfeel, otherwise the high ABV is well hidden. Long lasting aftertaste. Can't find any faults with the beer - therefore a straight 5.0. Does that imply that any ""perfect"" beer has to be as strong as Rochefort 10? Certainly not - but in the strong division, this one is in the lead, at least untill I have sampled Westvleteren... (But the price in Norway is outrageous: USD 9 for a small bottle - in the store!)"
"This beer pours a murky dark brown color with a decent head and some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very fruity and malty. Very pleasant. Much like the Rochefort 8, this was a good beer. The alcohol is much more apparent in this one as opposed to the Rochefort 8, so I have to say that I think the 8 is a little more smooth and easy to drink. The flavor represented the aroma well - fruity, malty, and laced with alcohol. Another great Belgian beer."
"Appears deep auburn brown but when held up to bright light appears a deep redish amber color. A really beautiful looking beer. Head is creamy tan and very tight settling down to about a quarter inch and resting there. Aroma is a complex one. Very fruity and raisin like aromas, alcohol also present. A bit earthy as well. A rich strongly flavored beer which is fruity and malty with a good kick. Has a very smooth and delicate mouthfeel with just a bit of a bite to it near the finish. Nice warming effect creeps up on you. An exceptional ale."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a Rochefort Chalice. It pours a dark brown color with 3 thick fingers of dense, rocky, light tan foam. The head stays along for the ride the entire time, and there is lots and lots of lace left on the glass. The smell is rich in chocolate and raisins, with a little hint of alcohol. Not really as big of a smell as I was expecting. The taste is fairly malty with raisins and plums coming right out. There is some hops and alcohol to the finish. The mouthfeel is strong, yet this is a super smooth brew. The drinkability is pretty good for being 11.3% abv. Yet another fine Belgian!"
"And then: hey! Not overly carbonated or aggressive in flavor. More gentle in its maltiness and hoppiness than I would have expected, bringing the drinkability and mouthfeel ratings way up for the style and the alcohol content. A rich cake flavor with notes of molasses, chocolate, raisin, dried apple and floral hops. Not sugary sweet; some spice notes in the finish. Would love to have aged it some, but I'll start with a raw review and go from there."
"This beer poured deep brown with a red tint and 2 fingers of head. There were carbonation bubbles coming up from the bottom. Lace is minimal. The aroma is mainly of sugar and fruit. The taste is malty and creamy. It is very sweet and complex in flavor. I really like the flavor of this beer, but I cant pull out any distinctive tastes. Medium bodied beer that leaves you craving for another."
"Very rich in the mouth, pushing the limit of acceptable sweetness for me. Its quite fruity, and there is a ton of rich bready malt. Some yeastiness as well. The tiny, constant streams of fine carbonation rising throughout the pint keep it from being ponderous. The alcohol is a readily apparent, and not particularly pleasant, component of the palate."
"Poured out a raisin colored brown with a nice head that lingered. Aroma was of malt and a hint of figs. Taste is extraordinary; complex and layered, which keeps the alcohol from taking over. Hints of fig and raisin with a sugary overtone that's quite pleasing. Malt and a bit of hop were also evident. Simply superb. Easily one of the best things I have ever tasted. Will return again and again.."
"All in all we thought the Westy was better based mostly on its smoothness and better flavor!"
"First of all, thedm and I compared this to the Westy 12 and I very, very much like the Westy 12 over this brew. I just could not acquire a taste for this brew as I was hoping to. That said, it poured a large invigorating tan head with fine-small bubbles into my glass. The lacing was good on all sides of my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it and a cloudy brown body. There was carbonation observed with this brew. It kept leaving me with a tingly, burning sensation in my throat that was not to my liking. Give me a Westy 12 anyday!!"
"Here's one of those dangerous Belgian brews. This one pours a dark ruby color with a sturdy beige head that laces extremely well. A sweet chocolate aroma presents itself, as notes of nuts and yeast are subdued but present nevertheless. Taste is sweet, nutty, yeasty, alcoholic, and overall delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is very well balanced. For a beer of its ABV, this one drinks way too easily and can put one on his ass if he is not careful. Certainly a classic, and well worth its acclaim."
"This was a great drinking experience. A true classic of the beer world!"
"No wonder it is rated high. Primo stuff. Poured it into a fluted glass and got about half an inch of head that went away quickly. Some floaties. Very dark color. The smell is strong(to go with the alcohol). Banana, plum, cocoa, medicine all present in nose. The alcohol is not real prominent, surprisingly. Only a little warm going down. I would recommend the 52-58F serving temp stated on the bottle. Only a little carbonated bite. Really wonderful mouth feel. Fruit, malt, fig or plum. You can wait for several minutes between sips, the taste sticks around!! There are very few beers that even come close to this quality and enjoyment. Price is the only hold back ~$6. Worth it for a special treat"
"Originally sampled 11 March 2002 at Pizzaport's Belgian Beerfest on draught. Rochefort 10 is a world class wonderful beer. The explosion of flavors in your mouth aren't to be missed. It has very light hop notes, but the plum, raisin & other flavors are gorgeous."
"After passing this by numerous times because of the price, I finally sprung for a bottle and am just amazed at how good this beer is. The head foams up a bit fluffy off-white and looks like a layer of pudding sitting on top of the beer. The head dimishes a bit but sticks around to the end, leaving lace all the way down the glass. It's a beautiful, deep ruby. The smell is ripe fruit, most notably raisin and cherry, and a bit of spice. Ripe fruit and peppery flavors come through with just a hint of licorice. The mouthfeel is a creamy miracle. This is the ultimate sipping beer and a must for a special occasion."
"This ale poured (carefully) a cloudy, dark coffee brown with highlights of red, with thin tan foam that dissipated rapidly. The smell was vinous and fruity (figs, apples), with caramel, sweet malt, and oak thrown in. There was also an alcohol odor discernible, though not strong. The taste was mildly sweet, vinous and fruity (apples, grapes, figs, raisins), with malt and alcohol flavors. The flavors blended wonderfully to give a very mellow experience. The mouthfeel was very smooth and velvety, with medium-full body and low carbonation. The flavors lingered in the mouth. The drinkability was very good. A very nice strong Belgian ale."
"This is a huge beer. The flavor is all over the place with lots of complexity. A little sweet fruitiness is followed by a good smooth flow of dark malts. The flavor starts to get roasty towards the end, and then you get a big blast of alcohol. Sometimes the alcohol was hidden, and if it was like that throughout, this beer would have scored much higher. I tasted a whole lot of alcohol through most of this beer. It was not welcomed in that quantity. Besides that, this is an excellent beer. It is everything you would want from a belgian dark ale. Full bodied, with a great aroma and masses of flavor. The alcohol warms nicely, but the flavor of alcohol needs to be toned down."
"-F"
"What else can be said? I was told that this is the closest I can get to Westvleteren 12 without actually having it, and if so, I'm really looking forward to it. Manly head and thick mouthfeel. The flavor is inexplicable, so I'll let others try. You pour it, let the head settle a bit, take a spicy sip, stare down into it and say... ""holy shit."" Thank you, Belgium."
"Drinkability: Scary for the amount of alcohol this brew has. It packs a wallop, yet hides it until the end. I could drink several of these...slowly of course!"
"This beer is so easy to go back to, as it makes you content in its taste and feeling. Easily a beer to have often, if you can afford it. So simple, not in a minimalist way but in a straightforward way. Outstanding tradition and elegant simplicity - what a dark malty brew can be at its best."
"Things just keep getting heavier. Deep ruby in color with a very thin, densely packed, dark tan head. Aroma is of burnt malt, plum, sugar, and alcohol. I was actually a bit underwhelmed by the aroma. After sniffing the 8, I expected something even bigger from the 10. It would have been a nice warning of what to expect in terms of flavor! Once again, the alcohol is quite noticeable from the first sip. And thenwell, theres a *lot* going on. Bready body, tastes of molasses, pepper, raisin and plum, pear and banana, all undergirded by a solid chocolate/caramel maltiness. Finishes with a strong hit of leafy hop flavor. Thinner in body than I had expected, but still creamy and viscous in mouthfeel. Not to be trifled with!"
"Pours with a rapidly fading brown head over murky opaque dark brownish liquid. The nose is a heady mix of dark fruits, chocolate, malts and alcohol. Taste is a wonderful mix of candi sugar, yeasty fruitiness, hops, chocolate...and a massive alcoholic presence that just coats the throat as you swallow this complex ale. Finishes with a complexity rarely tasted in most ales of any style, with a chocolatey sweetness that gives way to a very appetizing dryness that begs another long sip...one of Belgium's (and the world's) finest beers, one of the all-time greats! Worth every pricey penny!"
"Way too drinkable for something this strong."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy coppery brown with a small tan head. It has a sweet cookie like peppery smell. As expected extremely complex and smooth with a creamy sherry like flavor and sharp peppery alcohol warmth with a very rounded full mouthfeel. Definitely a delicious smooth beer more akin to a sherry or port and intended to be savored in a similar manner. Would be welcome anytime but possibly best suited as an after dinner drink. One of my favorites."
"Once again, it's great to be Catholic, and the Trappist monks do it again! This stuff is really amazing. I really can't think of any flaws in this brew. I guess the only draw back is the high price of $8+ a bottle. As soon as I opened the bottle, I noticed the vanilla and fruits scent in it. One thing that ""turned me on"" was the sight of the beautiful dark color and a creamy brown head. The head was supper thick at first, but subsided into a film-like substance. The taste was of heavy vanilla, fruit, nuts, and a hint of alcohol taste. The nutty vanilla taste stays around for a while after you swallow and leaves a little tinge on the tounge. I really like this brew and put it up there with the Weste 12. If you have it in your area, give it a go, it's well worth the price."
"Ultra-ripe peach and fig aroma, brown/tan head. Brown Body, medium low head, lots of lacing. An explosion of flavor with maple focus flavor and the richest longest finish I have ever experienced wrapped in the creamiest texture. Alcohol slowly but elegantly making itself known. Can I sell my soul in exchange for a life supply of this beer?"
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"The initial sensation to me after my first taste was ""warming"". The alcohol is not overly powerful in the taste at all. What is powerful in the taste is pears and dried fruits. I didn't notice much of a chocolate taste like many reviewers have mentioned. I just can't believe how smooth this beer is for the amount of alcohol in it. This is the finest Belgian beer I have had yet. I definitely like it more than Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles; these being the only other Belgian ales I have tried. It tastes so good, that it's hard to drink it slow which is a good idea unless you want to be overwhelmed with a quick inebriation."
"One of the more drinkable big beers I have had, but definitly not one of the more interesting. I can see this making a great aged beer...but I dont see it as one of the top beers in the world. Who knows, maybe an aged bottle would change my mind."
"This beer is very complex and wonderfully balanced, with layers of flavor that reveal themselves as the beer warms in the glass. It really is a delicacy, and at $8.00 per bottle it's one that I will indulge in very infrequently."
"Overall this beer was excellent ."
"Pours a small tight head that fades slowly. A rich mahogany color doesn't hide the sediment that snuck into the glass. The grass like aroma lets me know to expect a strong brew. Buttery, toffee flavor rides the malty goodness and with a hint of wood it gives a full mouthfeel. The 11.3% is there from begining to end but not over powering."
"A masterpiece of a beer. A absolute treat, one of the true greats,has the perfect blend of malt and bitterness.Tastes of fruit and spice. Alcohol not that noticable in taste, but definitely in effect! Two of these, and it will be sleepy time! I had this after a St. Bernardus 12, and I definitely prefered the Rochefort. Overall, this is a unique and incredible beer! This one poured a very large, foamy head which took a while to settle. Sweet and complex, a wonderful brew.Smooth, creamy, and as close to perfect as a beer can be."
"Anyway it has a net start, well resoluted."
"443"
"Drinkability & Notes: Definitely a sip and savour brew and better to pair up with some different cheeses. I opted for a meat and cheese plate and it play well with this tall standing brew."
"Absolutely perfect!"
"Rochefort 10 pours a pleasant chestnut brown with a rich tan head. The head leaves a beautiful lace pattern on the glass. Tha aroma is dried fruits with alcohol and background floral notes. The taste starts off with a rich malty flavor that is well balanced with flavors of dried cherries and plums. The finish is very flowery and dry with alcohol and apple/pear being the dominant flavors. The aftertaste is alcohol warmth lingering with malty sweetness and faint notes of raisin. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation. This is one of the worlds greatest beers. Smooth, easy to drink, and one of the most complex of the Trappist beers. If you get the chance to try one of these, do it at any cost."
"Deep brown color, with a huge tan head of tiny bubbles, sweet and fruity aroma, sweet and malty, flavors of dark fruit and caremel, full thick robust mouthfeel and some what chewy, just about perfectly balanced. I will have another one."
"This beer poured a very dark brown color and formed an light tan bubbly head that left some lace. An aroma of malt, plum, raisins and spice. A flavor of malt and spice with some fruit element plus you can detect the presence of the alcohol and it's warming effect comes through in a tart finish that hints at heavy carbonation being present. This is by far the best of the three of theirs that I have tried. Thanks again to the Ohio lawmakers for letting us get this."
"Pours a deep brown colour topped by a nice thick head that settles down rather easily. Aroma of this dark strong ale consists of chocolate and strong alcohol aroma (afterall the ABV is 11.5%). Chocolate and alcohol are the dominants of the flavour of this beer. Mouthfeel is quite strong with heavy carbonation... One of the finest dark strong ales of Belgium"
"Cloudy deep brown / amber with a very persistant and lacy head... aroma of plums and chocolate... oh, and a whole lot of alochol... almost reminds me of brandy. Flavor is very heavily dominated by the alcohol, with some fruity flavors and a touch of chocolate coming through. Sweet and tart, but not at all cloying or overstated. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a lot of effervescence... this beer is just loaded with carbonation, and fills the mouth like a champagne. This is a very good, and unique brew... not quite the pinnacle of beer excellence, but definatley a very good beer."
"""ZAP, ZING, PFLOT, and ZOWIE"" Batman, where has this great beer been hiding, ""GUSLER"" you ""CHUMP", yes ""CHIMAY"" is great, but this beer ""Whips It's ARSE"". Deep, dark, and quite handsome is this beer! majestic beige head, lace in thick clinging sheets, the nose is that of a ""5 Star"" brandy, fruity, sweet. Start is heavenly sweet, the top is skimpy, the finish is pertinently hopped, strong alcohol dry aftertaste, potently acidic, and ""Just one spectacular Brew""."
"This beer got me by surprise with it's powerful aroma and flavor.  It is possible that it wasn't as fresh as it could have been because it didn't have any lasting head or lace to speak of.  The appearance was a bit hazy.  My homebrew dubbel looks better...  The flavor was very complex, though.  I don't have much experience in describing beers, but the words sweet, sour, and alcoholic come to mind.  Rochefort 10 is a good treat once in a while.  It must be drunk nearly at room temperature to experience everything that's going on in this brew.  Served cold, it has a nasty bite, as do most of the Belgian and/or dark ales I've tried.  The mouthfeel after swallowing this beer reminded me of whiskey or even a strong wine.  Something keeps me coming back to Rochefort, although there are many others I haven't tried yet."
"NOT for Atheists!!!."
"Hazy dark brown hue, topped by a thick, well retained very dense tan head.  Dense, heterogenous lace is left down the glass.  Bubblegum esters and mellow chocolate dominate the aroma, but tart fruit, yeast mustiness and whiffs of peppery alcohol add complexity.  Flavorwise, banana esters and assertive malt sweetness are perceptible initially, then are promptly ensued by deeply caramelized fruit notes reminescent of sugary prunes and dates. A combination of raisiny Special B and chocolate malt surfaces late, complementing the caramelized dark fruit flavors.  Hop bitterness is virtually absent and would be out of place in this malt driven brew.  Lightly bodied and agreeable in mouthfeel considering the strength-- the copious use of dark candi sugar is quite evident.  Finishes w/ bready malt notes and darts of spicy alcohol on the tongue.  Satisfying alcohol warmth grows progressively stronger and eventually coats the throat.  Rochefort 10 is certainly a delicious brew, but seems to lack the depth and drinkability of the ""lighter"" Rochefort 8.  It's intense and tasty, nevertheless."
"Unlike the Westy I didn't start this one too cold, and I was rewarded. What a great Ale. Like a liquid Fig Newton. Sweet, almost candy aroma. This is a beer to sit back, relax, and enjoy."
"Hazy with a huge rocky head over a reddish-brown body. The nose is quite impressive! Extremely fruity with notes of  pears and bananas, as well as a big chunk of fresh bubblegum. The body is light/medium and it has a somewhat zesty mothfeel.The flavor is expansive with a silky, fruity maltiness that fills the mouth revealing a faintly milk-chocolate character just before a charge of hops coats the throat. The alcohol is noticeable but not obtrusive. The distinctively chocolatey flavor also comes through in a late, warming finish - accompanied by some vanilla, fruit and bready notes. An astonishingly complex beer that cannot be done justice with just words."
"I will compare this beer to Westvleteren 12 because they are similar beers. Rochefort is darker and more opaque. The head is a darker khaki. The head composition is unusual. The bottom is big bubbled but the bubbles get smaller the closer to the top until the top layer you can't see the individual bubbles and you just get a creamy foam. Because of the different bubble sizes you get a less creamy mouthfeel , but one where the feel of the bubbles plays a part. The aroma is that of a good porter with some spice and fruitiness. The flavor has a nice toffee maltiness with pears, chocolate and a dessert spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. It also has a brightness to the flavor that the Westy lacked. Like the Westy, surprisingly easy to drink for its strength."
"This beer is a murky dark brown. Damn near black. Light only seems to get through on the edges. The head is thick, luscious, creamy and tan. This beer has a beautiful aroma. Dark fruits, dark malt and cotton candy all in the mix. And sweet cookie dough. Now this is a beer to savor. Beautiful taste as it hits the tongue. Sweet fruits meld in perfection with dark (slightly burnt?) malts and of course sugars (seemingly brown and dark candy). Barely a hint of alcohol. (And this is 11.5 a/v?) So damn smooth. And damn tasty to boot. One of the best Belgian beers I've ever had."
"Magic in a glass.......Deep dark, ruby hints border the glass of this beauty. Thin fizzy tan head, that left after minute or two. Perfectly rich smell of carmel, cannied fruits, plums, and chocolate malt. Tasted much the same, incredible complex combination of roasted chocolate malt, fruit, carmel, cannied fruit and silky smooth mellow finish. This beer blankets your taste buds in happiness. High alcohol slides past, warms your belly and makes you happy. A perfectly balanced complex beer, the best I have had so far in my beer exploration. I saved this one for a special ocassion............."
"Deep chestnut brown, head settles in 25 seconds or so. Small bubbles but not fizzy. Aroma is just a touch vinous, nice rum and raisin notes, yeastiness is distinct and fresh flowery. Dense smoky raisin flavors, slightly like the smell but more restrained. Nice balance, not overly champagne-like or super sticky brandy. Finishes with a satisfying alcohol warming and coating property. Flavor impact like a see-saw, powerful at the beginning and end. There are some Belgian brews that rub me the wrong way (and many that don't), this hallowed ""cough syrup"" is not only an excellent example of a dark artisinal ale but a great tasting beer. Coated the wine goblet I used really nicely."
"Great beer, big rich, strong, warming, chocolatey, bit spicy, great beer for a cold winters night. A classic."
"Ahh... sweet nectar. A wispy lace of foam on a maroon-black beer. This beer smells of carmel, plums, and banana. While drinking my first mouthful I breathed in through my nose and tasted smooth, sweet, caramel and fruit, with a finish that spiced strongly of alcohol and faint black pepper. The crispness of this beer is so light, it reminds you of a chewier lambic, with a indescribable smoothness. Quite possibly one of the best beers in the world, but damned expensive."
"As one of the few best Belgian Trappists (maybe the best), this is one of those beers that deserves a place in the Hall of Fame just as Ripken, Henderson & Gwynn do.  It's a classic, with a unique combo of strength and drinkability.  It's one of those beers by which all others are measured."
"God smiles on this monk made beer!! This beer is the softest, most velvety beverage ever to take a ride past my lips. Huge plum / fig flavor. Huge body, enormous malty yummyness with little hop to be found.  ALthough Todd and Jason mentioned a ""prickly alcohol"" presense, I did not get any of that. Mine was totaly smooth from begining to end. If it wasn't so expensive I would be drinking at least one of these a week. As it is, it is a wonderful treat to enjoy on occation."
"Notes: Beer like this gives us a reason to live."
