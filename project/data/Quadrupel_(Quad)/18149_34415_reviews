"Overall: Think of this less as a Belgian quad and more of an American-style quad, reinforced by the addition of raisins. In that sense, it holds its own. While it may not be at the top of the list for American quads, I have to imagine it's somewhere in the top five. It's clear that Lost and Found is this beer's antecedent."

"Absolutely excellent.  Tastes of apple pie, with notes of citrus. Excellent Belgian taste, with no feeling of alcohol.  You could guess the ABV was 4% not 10.  Absolutely excellent quad and well done across the board."
"Flavor is slightly vinous, as well, with loads of raisin character, modest sweetness, and a toasted, bready malt, spicy finish."

"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. It was hard to peg this tape-wrapped bottle. Dark red-brown in body with a small tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring. Some spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is raisins, figs, plums, chocolate malt, yeast, and alcohol. Taste is strong dark fruit and caramel malt sweetness with a touch of cherry, light cocoa and spice bitterness, and alcohol on the swallow. Medium-plus body, syrupy thick texture, average to soft carbonation, alcohol and spice finish. I have read that newer bottles may be too carbonated, but think this bottle was aged some, so that may have affected the profile. I quite enjoyed this style-bending quad."

"Not far from the classics, quality-wise, and surprisingly ""obedient"" for an US offering. Really cool!"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 10/31/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dark khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, clove, black pepper, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome quadrupel style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, raisins, and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"A damn good beer aside from the heavy booze presence. I loved it in every other regard. Maybe I'd suggest 2 or more years of aging to address the astringency."
""
""
""
""
"Bit sweet, bit heavy. Something to cut through - more bitterness, namely - would be welcome."
"Overall, yeah, another fine brew out of the Lost Abbey stable. It's certainly not different enough to stand out from the crowd, but it's a beer I'm perfectly happy to drink. But then, pretty much anything with the LA label on it is something I'm perfectly happy to drink."

"Good quad, and certainly the raisins were a forefront character in this. Didn't quite hit the mark on balance, as I felt the alcohol was a bit too perceptible once it warmed, still quite tasty and drinkable, but I wouldn't put it in top marks, it falls short of the complexity and balance I would expect in the best belgian quads. Still a quite respectable beer and rather unique in its own regard."

"O: good, but ABV is too high and complexity is too low."

"Pours dark brown with a nice beige head that diminishes with slight lacing. I read the other reviews and mine is a bit different. Drinking from a tulip glass (Frog and Onion Pub, Bermuda) filled from a corked 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounce bottle. The predominant taste that comes to the front is molasses with raisins and a warming alcohol feel. The bottle should be shared as the APVis listed at 10.5% APV. My best description of this taste is toasted molasses, a very nice winter brew, satisfying that need for a filling satisfying brew. Certainly one worth tasting, savoring, enjoying. The taste is smooth to the tongue and warming. A beer worth trying!"
"O-Overall a great quad by Lost Abbey. More please!"
"O - The Lost Abbey's Judgement Day quad is a rich and robust beer that's filled with Belgian yeast complexity but at the end of the day, it's clearly an American-brewed dark Belgian-style beer. The addition of raisins is a nice touch (though they seem to practice this with some frequency) but it seems to me, achieving the aroma and flavor of raisins in a beer like this is a job for the yeast, not the grape grower. And while my biggest dissatisfaction, if you would call it that, is the overuse of heavily roasted malt, I think Judgement Day is a damn fine beer, just unique in it's own right."

"D: a good big Belgian dark beer, but not loving this. a couple off things like the metallic notes I am picking up on."

"My first try with lost abbey. More a fan of their port brew offerings. Didn't do much for me. Spend the extra four bucks and get a st Bernardus abt 12"
""
"Overall par for the course as far as quads go. That's a good thing. It's not blowing me away, but it is a solid effort. Wouldn't actively seek this out but would get again."

"O: One of my favorites from Lost Abbey. It's definitely worth a try, and comes in a nice big bottle with one of their amazingly epic labels."

"The beer pours a deep mahogany with maroon highlights with a rocky, light tan head of sudsy bubbles. The head sits about a fingerâ€™s width above the glass with nice lasting power. In body, the beer is deep and dark, nearly opaque, but seems to be clear of particles. On the nose, the beer of rich raisins, tart plums, and soft brown sugar and caramel malt. Touches of spicy clove and even a hint of banana esters touch upon the nose. There is even a touch of smooth breadiness and warming alcohol waft over the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy sweet with lots of fruity esters. The alcohol is very aggressive at the start of the sip but does mellow into the rest of the beer as the sip continues. Soft acidity play off the esters of the beer in the middle of the sip, but only a touch of bitter hops do touch the tongue. In flavor, the beer begins as hot, stale, spicy alcohol that mellows into sweet raisins, phenolic clove, bananas, and unripe plums with a touch of tartness. The finish brings forward bitter herbs with soft astringency, and a touch more hot booze, caramel, and more raisins. The aftertaste is soft bread and raisins in brown sugar. Stale green apple flavors hit the mouth throughout sip, and what feels like herbal tannins also make an appearance occasionally in the sip. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to full bodied. Carbonation is of middling strength, but the mouthfeel is velvety, smooth with a little harshness from the alcohol. Overall, this is a nice quad/Belgian strong ale that could use a little more time in the cellar. The alcoholic heat is a bit much and takes away from the rest of the beer. Flavors are rich, and the raisin is very dominant in the taste, but I want more of the phenols and esters from the yeast. The nose is also a bit weak in terms of the flavoring of the rest of the beer. This is a good beer that should be cellared for optimum flavoring."

"Overall a very good Quad. Not in the same class as some of the Belgian heavyweights, but quite respectable."

"very dark brown with khaki colored creamy head which fades to thin covering. rich smells - aroma of pipe tobacco, leather, dark fruit, spicy, a bit of alcohol. tastes of complex malt flavors. I do pick up a bit of raisin. boozy herbal finish. medium body, but coats the tongue. lower, soft carbonation. overall - perhaps the best non-Belgian brewed Quad I've had."
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: I could tell it was a big beer from the moment I popped the cork. There were strong Belgian aromas as I poured this dark brown cloudy beer that had lots of gorgeous settlement. This was a thick brew with very strong raisin, caramel and burnt sugar flavors with a slight bitter alcohol finish. This is a great American interpretation of a Belgian style and its obvious The Lost Abbey knows what they are doing. Itâ€™s a shame I only brought back one sample of their lineup and that you cannot get their great beers in Texas."

"Things are slightly more bitter than I have found in most Belgian Quads. Part of that is due to the relative abdication of the sweeter elements of the beer that were in the nose, and part is due to the rather uncompromising nature of the booziness. While I am glad to have tried it, I would rather have had this in a 12oz bottle than the gargantuan bottle I have in front of me, as it would simply be a more reasonable amount."

"A pretty decent quad. I have to admit that it was lighter than other quads that I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is dry and surprisingly light. Overall, this is a pretty good beer."
""
"O - Feels like this lacks complexity for a style I'm quite fond of. The Belgian-brewed ones are just plain better than our American interpretations."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would have hoped 2 years would have helped to tone down the higher ABV and mesh the flavor profile as with most strong Belgian ales but this was not the case. Just too boozy and unbalanced; the kind of beer I would have loved in my craft beer infancy but a more developed palate merely passes this off as hot and way too raisin forward."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The texture is crisper with moderate carbonation."
"Flavor profile is an interesting fusion of Belgian Strong Dark Ale and Stout. Chocolatey notes from roasted malts meet ripe raisin and plum, and a balancing hop bitterness. Carbonation is aggressive but fine, nicely done. Alcohol is very well masked. Interesting hybrid sort of beer, a quad that's not all that ""quad-like."""

"I cellared this bottle for about a year and a half. The quad was poured into a snifter, with an appearance that was black with some degree of cloudiness. The aroma was that of malt and dark fruit. In the initial taste, one gets a high level of dark fruit such as raisin, prunes, and dates. Even before identifying the initial taste, one notices the warmth on this one. Dark fruit are heavily involved. Burnt malt, molasses, and dark chocolate notes are also present. The malts become more noticeable in the aftertaste. The warming sensation continues throughout each seem. Though this is a year-round brew, quads are great on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a translucent prune brown with glints of cola color around the edges of the glass. The head is HUGE, foamy, and dark tan. A bouquet of tart grape, raisin, cherry coke, and notes of chocolate. Mouthfeel is full, nearly thick, wet, with a bit of carbonation burn that interacts with the spiciness. Some vanilla, more raisin and brown sugar, and chocolate flavors. Sweet and tart occurring simultaneously. Not an off-putting amount of spiciness, for which I am grateful. A bit (just the slightest) boozy at the finish. A pretty clever beer."
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a thin beige collar. The aroma offers sweet malt, raisins, prunes, yeast, caramels, toffee. The flavor is sweet, with an abundance of toffee. Caramel candies with a touch of Belgian yeast. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Perhaps a bit out of balance with an over abundance of sweetness and toffee. A tasty beer in small quantities."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this Quad. Classic and well done for a non Trappist Quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a sweet, powerful quad that lacks the finesse of the better ones. An interesting effort, but one I probably won't revisit."
""
""
"O: Would not have guessed raisins were used even though all the tart, juicy, fruity tastes are there. What I expect from a Quad with tons of complex caramel malt flavor and little booze taste for strength."
""
"O: This beer was quite delicious, I would definitely buy this again"
"O: Good drinkability. My fist American made Quad. My second Lost Abbey after the Angel's Share. Not as good as the first one but still a good beer. Recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, it's pretty good, but nothing I'd go back to. I'm not sure if the alcohol would fade with some more age, but this bottle already had several months on it. A big quad to be sure. Glad I got to try it once, but I doubt there will be a repeat performance."
"Really nice quad. Nice balance with out being over-boozy. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer and for around $10 I hope to buy another one if given the chance. A good quad for sure. This one was aged around a year and was smooth. I could see where a fresh one may have a more boozy taste to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a solid quadruple. However, it finishes a little too dry for my taste. I prefer quads that leave your tongue moist with those fruit flavors lingering but, that's just me. The alcohol is there but, it doesn't feel like a 10.5 there is a good sweetness that keeps it masked until the end. I wanted to give this beer a shot before I try the Cuvee de Tomme seeing as this is the base beer for that recipe. If you can get this bottle for ten and under it's definitely worth a try. Seeing as some have payed up to twenty and over for the 750ml I would advise against that. This shouldn't be over ten dollars."
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall I preferred the Weyerbacher Blasphemy to the Lost Abbey Judgment day but this doesnt mean Judgment Day was bad in the least. While neither can really compete with true Belgian Quads, both breweries did a pretty damn good job of not destroying the style, in fact I'd have to say they both made progress of being truer to style than most. While I do chose Weyerbacher Blasphemy as the victor, it has had the advantage of having a bit of aging on it at the brewery letting the beer mellow out and become a bit more complex. If I recall, while weyerbacher quad was very good, it was a little sloppier than it's barrel aged counter part. Good show by both breweries though, I enjoyed them both."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. I know I've had this bottle for a little while, I'd guess it's about a year old. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about an inch frothy tan head that stays around for a very long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), peppery spice, molasses and some bready malt. It tastes like dark fruit (raisins, cherries, plums), molasses, caramel, bready malt and some chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. I think this is a good overall brew. I'd buy this one again at $10.99 a bottle."
""
"This beer, poured from a 750 ml corked bottle is a burgundy color with a rich tan head. The head dissipates after a few minutes, but the beer retains a continuous stream of small carbonation bubbles. The aroma is of intense malt...mildly roasted, with lots of bubblegum, spice, and sugar. Belgian, sweet...grape skins...hints of apple skins and cinnamon. Full in body. This is a fine beer."
""
""
""
"O: I wish this wasn't so expensive and that Lost Abbey wasn't so pretentious about this one. It was good, but not worth the $20+ price tag. Especially considering the many Belgian Quads on the immediate market in my area that are far superior."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this offering a lot. Will probably drink this again."
""
"Overall: A nice Quad. This batch has more chocolate and roast than usual."
""
""
"O - Fun beer, and my first try at Lost Abbey. While a nice quad, it is far from the very good ones that you can get much easier."
""
"Overall â€“ This was sweet tasty beer that warms the body and tingles the tastebuds. Very nice."
""
"Overall: I get what they are going for here and it is a nice beer and a sipper for sure at 10.5% abv. This (to me) is a nice beer to have after a good meal or by the fireplace in the cooler months. In May, this one was a pre-dinner crusher that left me looking for the bread sticks. Good variety of flavors, but I once again realize that the Belgians just do this so much better at the price. Cheers!!"
""
"O: Overall a flavor that showed some complexity, a manageable alcohol per bomber were its good points. A lack luster nose and mouthful were its weak points. Drinks like a strong ale rather quad, but a decent flavor despite the least for those who just want to have a good beer and not judge."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is rich and malty with molasses and brown sugar dominant, also get some raisin and plums and red grape. The booze is well hidden and sneaks up on me during the review. This is actually an easy drinking beer despite the booziness and high octane. Dangerously easy to drink but very appealing flavor and welll crafted brew. Wish I had another bottle."
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
"O- originally, I was trepidatious about fruit in my beer. However, the raisin seemed to add a dark sweetness that complimented the style. Really enjoyable overall."
""
""
"Overall, I would put this one on the low end of the Lost Abbey pool of beers I would pick from, but that means I would still pick it over 70% of beers out there. Good value for the $ and worth taking a taste of if you get the chance. I think it is one of those beers in the LA evolution that led to bigger, badder beers."
""
""
""
"Fuller body, well carbonated, sticky and full on the tongue. This is a pretty nice quad - I thought the alcohol might be a little overwhelming, but it was actually pretty balanced after a little time resting in the bottle."
"Poured from the bottle into a chalice it develops a nice dark tan head. The appearance is dark mahogany brown. Scent is all dark fruit and yeasty bread. The taste while good is VERY sweet to my palate and is a bit off putting. Not quite as much carbonation as would be expected for a brew this sweet. I was hoping that this would be a good sub for some of the Belgian quads that I love since it's price is better but it's not quiet up to par for that purpose for me. Not a bad brew at all just a bit disappointing. Too sweet for my liking. Maybe my expectations were too high."
""
""
""
"O: This beer could use a fuller body, more fruit flavors and some sweetness. The taste seems to improve a bit as it begins to warm up."
"O: Tastes more like a Belgian strong dark ale than a quad - not as much sweetness as I would have expected. Not sure I really want another of these."
""
"Drinkability/overall- this beer was a bit sweet to really drink a ton of but that being said did enjoy the flavor profile, was pretty decent first try from the much known lost abbey brand, not sure something would rush for again but if in mood for good quad worth shot, the brightest point for this beer was the nose really good"
""
"Overall: A nice treat, but not something that would be a regular in my fridge -- perhaps once or twice a year, kind of like a Rochefort 10. Good weight and plenty of sweetness would make this a great dessert beer, but I don't think I'd want to drink it while eating due to the weight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 4.5: If this is ""Judgment Day"" my ruling is, ""well done, my good and faithful servant."" Amazing beer that the label calls a ""Belgian Dark Quad Ale."" Call it whatever you want, $8.99 for 750 ML (that's 25.36 U.S. ounces) is a bargain. If you are lucky enough to find it...BUY IT!"
""
""
""
"Speaking of sipping, Judgment Day is not a beer you want to drink fast. At 10.5% ABV, and the insane amounts of malt and fruit flavor, this beer is a monster. This would be an excellent beer to cellar for a while, as the bold malt and high ABV will lend to a smoother more rum-like product over time. If I had more self control I would age this one, but I know it wouldn't last more than a month. Sure would be nice to see what some time will do to this beast though."

"B- (Maybe a B pre-yeast pour)"
"First beer tried by Lost Abbey, which is new to NJ. The bottles all look cool, anyway. Dude at the beer store suggested that I try this one. Pours very dark with a thick head into my tulip glass. Head disappears quickly, lots of lacing on the side. Smells of booze, vanilla and raisins. Tastes of grape, raisins and booze. Very hot going down. Not necessarily a bad thing. Mouthfeel somewhat thick. I have to say, I've had several better Quads, but this is still very good. It's getting better as I drink more of it. I bought the big stout of theirs. Can't wait to try that one."
"Overall 4- I feel like it should have way less carbonation personally. The booze is very assaulting which I don't mind but could definitely be a turnoff to some. With a year or more of aging this beer would be 10x better. Definitely enjoyed but would not spend $12 on it again."
""
""
""
"Overall: nice slow sipping beer. Full of flavor, this one is great on a cold night in front of a fire."

"This is a very good quad that builds layer upon layer of a sweetness echo chamber. If you're allergic to sugar, or vaguely diabetic, don't even sniff this brew."
"o- pretty good. i liked it as a beer that i was trying for the first time but i don't know if I've ever go out and seek this brew out."

"Overall: A pretty good quad. The raisins are definitely prevalent. Drinkability is pretty high. The ABV is well hidden."
""
"Judgment Day is a pretty good Quad, but does have its shortcomings. The biggest issues are the light Belgian yeast presence and the body/mouthfeel. If those two issues were addressed, itâ€™d likely be improved. Those arenâ€™t huge problems though. Itâ€™s definitely good, and is worth your attention."

"Pours a dark brown with some lighter browns around the edges. Huge tan head of several fingers, great lacing and retention. Nose has loads of dark fruit notes, some berries, rich chocolate notes and some brown sugar. Boozy vanilla notes too, but this only adds to the complexity of this. Taste is rich, boozy and caramel-ly dark fruits, lots of chocolate there too. Hints of brown sugar and vanilla as per the nose. Mouthfeel has a light and peppery carbonation initially, and melts over the tongue with a creamy and smooth texture. Subtle alcohol in the finish. An excellent quad, my second favourite on the day. Really some fantastic flavours and aroma."
"Overall: This is not close to the best belgian quad I've had, but it is still worthy of your purchase. Great beer, but the sweetness needs to be toned down."
"O: Good beer for the price. I'd like to age a bottle to see if it might cut out some of the stronger alcohol finish. This beer had a great, complex start but it's finish was a little dry for me. Definitely worth a try for the price."
"A complex and nice brew, sweet and potent."
"O: I'm a bit fan of Quads and this one doesn't disappoint. Grab it if you can and I guess let it sit for a year or so cause I'm really diggin the flavors."
"O: Great overall beer. I would recommend to a friend."
"Pours a dark dark brown color thin head gone before my first sip. Smell is heavy on alcohol and fruit. Taste has a very alcohol heavy start with a fruity, sweet back... not bad so far not great... Maybe the flavor will improve with a little warmth as I generally do keep my fridge kinda cold. Initial mouthfeel definitely has an alcohol burn, but nothing unbearable. Again sometimes that goes away with a lil warmth. Pretty good beer that indeed does improve as it breathes a little bit."
"Feels full in body, with mild carbonation. Kind of dry in the end, along with a slow alcohol burn."
"Overall: This beer is quite aggressive. It should age really well for 3-5 years. This beer could easily be an A. Only time will tell if this could be considered an A+ beer though."
"this was really good, fun to try an american perspective on the quad, the mouthfeel wasnt as big as a rochefort or westy so it loses some points, but good effort. Also i prefer slightly more brown sugar tastes in my quads"
"A fair amount of carbonation, but it is real smooth. Solid medium bodied, not quite sticky. It is a sipper. I suggest sharing this one, though I didn't."
"D. Very nice and surprisingly drinkable. Really like this alot. Would drink again."
"O - This is a really tasty quadrupel. I'm glad I picked this one up at Binny's."
"Tomme Arthur makes more than a few beers that have the kind of character and temperament to intimidate, but Judgement Day, despite its threatening name and 10.5% alcohol, is a beer that administers warm hugs rather than stiff blows. It's a best friend in a 750ml serving size. And it's every bit the beer that you'd get from any Trappist brewery."
"O- Nice drink. Would definitely buy again."
"O- A pretty decent beer, the alcohol comes off a bit strong and some time in the cellar would be good, head retention needs some serious work. Would recommend though especially since all quads are glorious, this just is a good to average one."
"O- Interesting beer with the raisin and dark fruit flavors taking center stage. Looking forward to trying some more Lost Abbey beers."
"Very solid Quad. A great diversity of flavors with a big and powerful delivery. A tad on the sweet side to get nitpicky, especially on the finish, but I bet this would cellar beautifully. The raisins were a nice touch too. Although I prefer in a Quad the addition of a brighter and uplifting cherry character (like the 3 Philosophers or Boulevard BBQ), the raisin's rich elegance also took this beer in a very sexy direction."
"O~I know Lost Abbey takes some hits from time to time with the quality control of their beers or if they are tainted in someway..but I thought this one was pretty good... even if there were some slight signs of a mold or something along the surface between glass & cork...slight.."
"Definitely a different experience from the belgian quadruples that I love. A refreshing difference in mouthfeel and somewhat in the flavor profile. This one is not dominated by dark fruits, but rather they are balanced by the coffee."
"O: A good beer to be sure, but falls a little short of expectations. Flavor is good but never quite gets to great. Still, absolutely worth a try, just might tickle your tastebuds more than it did mine. Even though you can't taste the alcohol, by the time you reach the end of the glass, it does help to erase any shortcomings...."
"o - overall pretty good for an american quad, glad i tried it, but nothing special."
"Overall a solid quadrupel but clearly not up there with the best. A very good Californian version though."
"Poured a big, thick head immediately. The nose had a very distinct pineapple juice smell. My first impression was that it tastes like New Belgium's 1554 on crack. Chocolate malt is definitely the dominant flavor. I was expecting something a little more balanced. High alcohol is apparent and warm. This heavy beer is good, but not my fave from Lost Abbey."
"Overall- very pleasant to drink with no hint of the 10% abv. I love this beer and it's one of the few quads I could drink regularly."
"Pours a nice dark mahogany with a fairly thick light tan head. Aroma is malty and slighty sweet with a decided raisin undertone and a hint of yeast. Malty and slightly syrupy flavor has tones of fruit and raisin with a hint of caramel and a bit of an alcohol nip. Silky smooth texture has a subtle tingle and leaves a slightly rough and fizzy finish."
"Got this one while out in Cali for the Bruery Reserve Society Party. Big thanks to womencantsail for shipping this one to me after I left! Shared this one with the Columbia Homebrew Club on our last stop during our tour of all things beer in Charleston on 'the bus'. Toasted to this one at 6PM on May 21, 2011 in celebration of the predicted Judgement Day. Served from bottle into a pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a one and a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raisins, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, raisins, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The raisins really made their presence known for sure and were quite enjoyable. They really mixed well with the roastiness going on here. The alcohol was just a touch and not overwhelming at all. If I could do it again, I would choose another beer to crack on Judgement Day, but this one just felt right."
"Overall: I really dont care for Lost Abbey and their high levels of carbonation in their beers. Apart from that I really enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I thought it had a great flavor was pretty easy to drink."
"O: This one is okay. Better than pretty things, far lacking against rochefort 10. My quad quest continues."
"Final thought - $5 and 10%+ ABV, this is a beer, I love. Huge and you only need one! Thanks lost abbey!"
"I'm sorry, but I thought this beer was downright terrible. Can't recommend it."
"Medium mouthfeel, but drinks very smoothly. My first Lost Abbey brew and I am definitely impressed. Highly recommend this one and now I'm very much looking forward to more from this brewery."
"Good qaud, not the best but good."
"O â€“ Touch too dry. Nice nose."
"I expect a lot out of my quads, and that being said, this is very good beer; however, this one falls just short of the great and world-class quads. All in all, a delicious beer."
"Judgment Day demands to be sipped, but is completely delicious. Nothing is off-putting. But tread carefully! Quads are not a beginner's brew, and this beer doesn't take half-steps to accommodate the masses. Maybe that was the point? Only the chosen few can find salvation in an ale? Well, I don't know if Judgment Day's powerful flavors are enough to stave off God's wrath, but they definitely go down swinging. Amen!"
"Light bodied and well carbonated, prickly on the tongue. Still a bit of alcohol in this one."
"Mouthfeel: I think its carbonated perfectly and it feels soft and slightly creamy as a result. Its big without being overly sticky."
"T: A bit of prickly carbonation and slight malt sweetness upfront. Brown sugar and a tiny bit of raisin and prune in the middle and then a slightly earthy finish that's bitter and a bit off for me. The finish really doesn't leave me wanting more. This is probably my least favorite of the Lost Abbey offerings I've had to date."
"Tasted of mild clover honey, citrus orange, and medium toasted malt. Medium bodied and decently drinkable. I'd like to try this again sometime in a larger quantity, though the price on this one is a little steep imo."
"O: Decent. Not bad, but not great either. Tend to be hesitant with some LA beers, due to past carbonation issues, unless I'm sure it is at least a 2010 bottle release. Since this was shared with me, no loss even if it was flat, but thankfully it was just fine. A sipper to be sure, and I only had about a quarter of the bottle, which was just enough."
"The one pours out as a reddish brown color with a very little head. No lacing on this one really. Smells like yeast and dark dried fruits, doesn't really give off the aroma I was expecting from a Quad. Tastes alcohol, bread and fruits throughout this brew. Thin mouthfeel not overly complex found this brew to be a little disappointing."
"I like the raisin addition, and it drinks like raisins eat: sugary sweet, but not TOO sugary sweet. Just right. And the script on the back label is worth reading. Carpe Diem!"
"This beer pours a dark maron color, that becomes darker as it pours decent size head and a bit of lacing. The smell is weak, but is fruier and sweeter. The taste is on the malter side and deffently sweeter, deffently can taste the rasins. The flavor is strong and dose stay on the palette for a while. Overall this is a good quad, but could better, a little bit too much rasins; a stronger alchool taste may help."
"Pours a deep brown to black in color with a small tan head. In the aroma, dark fruit and a dry alcohol note. In the taste, dark fruit, especially raisins, with just a small burn of alcohol. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry raisin like fruitiness in the aftertaste. A bit thin, but great flavor and nose."
"The brewery is well wortht the time if you're in the area and love a good pint."
"Really outstanding beer. Not much of an alcohol bite."
"Finally, I get to have a Lost Abbey brew with carbonation. Brown, a bit of haze, little head or lace. Medium roast malt and oak aroma. Soft up front with medium carbonation. Oaky with a touch of alcohol, and rich sweet back end. Mildly biter. The flavor builds gradually from start to finish."
"Pours a murky prune juice color with a puffy 2 inch light tan color that lasts. Kind of dirty looking overall. Good rings of lace on the glass on the way down. Smells of raisins, prunes/plums, dark malt, and yeast. Taste is of raisin puree, prune juice, and dark bready malts. Beer seems excessively carbonated (soda like) and prickles on the way down the throat. Slight alcohol burn too. Overall, a good beer that would be better if the carbonation levels were dialed down."
"O - A decent attempt at a quad but fall short of being authentic, Nowhere near the Rocky 10 or St Bernies Abt 12"
"Decent, but doesnâ€™t stand out among other Belgian quads for me. I will say that the alcohol, while present in the flavor, is very well hidden and is well integrated into the flavor profile."
"O: Too much raisin, an other dark fruits, and alcohol for my taste. Really missing the typical Belgian sweetness."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It smells and looks pretty good, but the taste is a bit of a departure from the style that I feel doesn't benefit this beer. It is too dry and doesn't have the signature sugar popular to other Quads."
"O: Overall it is lacking the complexity I love and the carbonation I expect. It is good for sure, but does not go into the realm of great."
"Drink- As I mentioned a 180 from what I thought this was. A nice quad with good flavors and a nice well masked ABV. Would have this again."
"Not my favorite Lost Abbey, but not my least favorite either. Decent. I'd be interested in trying an aged version of this."
"o - Overall this is a decent quad, but the carbonation problem in the mouthfeel and the alcohol prominence in the nose and taste hurt it a bit. Would give another shot but would certainly want to share the bottle next time as opposed to tackling it by myself, and probably wouldn't seek out."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a reddish tint to it. Good white head and a bit of lacing as it fell. The nose was really heavy on the fruit character, actually too much so. There was a large amount of raisins in the forefront along with a bit of red grape and dark fruits in the background. The flavor was still really heavy on the raisin character along with a heavy dosing of sweetness. Other dark fruits in the background. Feel was sweet, though luckily not cloying. Just a bit too one dimensional as far as I'm concerned."
"Notes: For a Quad, this beer was a bit lighter than I expected. However, it has a creamy mouthfeel, and is quite drinkable. Alcohol is present just enough to make this beer a good fireside sipper. Pretty tasty stuff!"
"Pours a five+ finger, thick, light brown head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy dark brown color, some yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is dark fruit, flavor is raisins and alcohol, smooth. $10.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. There is a little bit of alcohol heat, but not bad for a beer at 10.50% abv. This is a very good Quadrupel, which I will need to buy again."
"drinkability: Quite gentle for Judgment day. Very merciful."
"Poured from the nice corked 24.5 oz bottle into my Affligem chalice. Wonderful rich tan 2 inch head with ridges and peaks and valleys and a deep cloudy brown color. Smell the sweetness of figs and raisins and belgian yeast. Tastes fruity, sweet, raisiny and even some pears and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and it retains its carbonation. Drinkability is good despite the high ABV. One bottle per sitting please. Will probably look for this again!"
"the drink ability isn't that great....its not bad beer at all...but to try to get through a whole big bottle of this beer is gonna be tough"
"(750ml bottle). Pours dark brown with khaki head. Nice lacing. Lots of chocolate, caramel, and dried fruit in the nose. Taste is sweet like a tootsie roll. A little metallic note that is distracting and takes away from the nice flavor a bit. Full bodied with a creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Smooth finish with alcohol noticeable in the chest and throat. This is a nice beer."
"D- Complex flavors, but metallic notes and flat body suffer it some. Alcohol hidden well. A definite sipper."
"D - Great flavors, ever so smooth and deceptively easy drinking at 10.5% ABV (4.5)"
"D: The lack of carbonation is puzzling but this is still a quality brew."
"Very nice Abt/Quad, especially considering how fresh it is. Really probably should let this sit a bit but Lost Abbey just hit the store today and I couldn't resist!"
"So smooth. I really wish I knew the age on this bottle, it's phenomenal. Well that's what I get for being cocky. An excellent American quad. Slight alcohol burn but the next drink brings the smooth candy."
"D- Not one of my favorite quads, but not that bad. Not to much drinkability on this one."
"Pours a very dark brown that turn ruby red when held up to the light with a medium off-white head that slowly diminishes. Aroma alcohol with dark fruits and slight hint of chocolate. Taste is initially A LOT of dark fruits (raisins, plums, dates, prunes, and cherries) followed by some roasted almond flavor. Then I get a bit of chocolate followed by some booziness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Nice smooth finish. Drinkability is fair. Not my favorite representation of a Quad, but definitely brings its own uniqueness too the table."
"This beer pours a dark brown with purple on the edges and no head. It smells of dark fruits, mainly raisins and some brown sugar. Tastes very much the same, and is a great American quad. Full bodied, not super easy to drink and I got drunk off one bottle. Would buy again."
"Anyway, for the highly experienced,this beer offers all the strength of a barleywine without the overpowering esters of a typical Belgian, or the hops of a double IPA. Definitely a unique beer worth trying...several times!"
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is a dark brown with a filmy, light head. No smell to speak of; light undertones of malty sweet. The beer has heavy flavors of dark malt and molasses, and is heavy sweet, even for a quadrupel. The molasses is also present on the finish, but is balanced out with some cinnamon tastes. The over-sweet flavors makes this a tough one to drink, and the beer fell short for my wife and I both. Somewhat disappointing."
"D: It's very nicely drinkable but maybe it's too easy to drink, I split a bomber with my friend and it went a little to quickly. I would love to try it off tap."
"D:Because the alcohol comes through so strongly, it does not go down easily or quickly, and I definitely wouldn't want to drink a lot in a short amount of time. That being said, it makes a great dessert beer."
"I am getting pretty tiered of sub par Lost Abbey products. I am pretty much done with their offerings after this. Not something I would recommend."
"Judgement Day falls short of perfection, but that doesn't stop it from being an exceptional beer."
"D: I didn't like this one so much, so I won't be drinking it for a while, especially at the price. Maybe with a little more experience I can appreciate it, but I can't say."
"Drinkability: Below-average quad."
"Not a bad beer overall, but I've had several quads that were better, in my opinion. Ruby brown appearance with moderate light brown head, smell is sweet--toffee, Belgian yeast notes, and raisins. Flavor is dominated by the figs/raisons/plums spectrum of things, with a bit of sweet malt on the end. Pillowy in the mouth, though not as smooth as it could be. Ok drinkability, a bit sweet, and rests too heavily on raisins."
"A weak pop of the cork told me there may be carbonation issues. Not major, but it certainly lacked the nice, smooth Belgian cap that I'm used to seeing in my quads/BSDA's. Deep mahogany and a few trails of bubbles. Dark chocolate, rich caramel, figs, slight touch of toffee. Maybe a hint of clove? Nicely blended. Oily and slick body. This isn't really dry at all. Carbonation is moderate at best. But this actually drinks pretty well so I'll take it!"
"This beer is good, but LA definitely has some better offers."
"Drinkability: Kind of a weird brew, to be honest, which is why the weird reviews end up happening, as far as the numbers go. I feel like this may sincerely be one that's meant for cellaring -- right now, as I stated, the booze is too much, kind of, and if I'm saying that, it's something. That said, there's still a lot to admire, especially in its ballsiness and raucousness, which I can dig sometimes. Cellar it. See what happens. Now, though -- I wouldn't recommend it for the QPR probably."
"D - This is an unusual and complex quad, but a great sipper thanks to the red wine qualities. High drinkability, but eventually it'd but me under the table at 10.5%"
"D - Not as good as the Trappist Quads but still a good take on the style worth picking up a bottle or a glass if you see it around"
"D: Very good beer, but the booze is too strong to drink fast or in large quantites. Tasty."
"Poured a dark murky brown with brown highlights that had a absolutely no head and no lacing. The aroma was big on the dark fruits like raisins with toffee, booze, slight chocolate, and faint molasses notes lingering in the background. The taste was pretty damn boozy with raisins notes like the nose but it did have toffee, molasses, and a touch of maple accents. The brew was medium in body with absolutely no carbonation which had a sweet, sticky, and boozy finish. It drank alright and had me twisted after I was done with the bottle because I drank it to the neck. IMO it was too hot but still tasty without any carbonation."
"This beer weighs in at a heavy 10.5% ABV and does it amazingly. It is not your session beer but would be pretty impressive in place of a dessert wine after a nice dinner."
"D: This strikes me as the type of beer that is trying to impress you with its high ABV and bold flavor but is severely lacking in the complexity and drinkability department, something like the guy who drives a big truck to compensate for his small penis. Interesting to try but I won't be coming back for more."
"D- Really nice quad with a great flavor profile."
"D - The high abv and sweetness makes this one a good one to share."
"D - Delicious overall flavors and great beer. THe ABV is on the high side and it is quite complex in flavors."
"Rating from backlog, which was from memory. Bottle, poured deep brown with absolutely no head. I was immediately concerned that the bottle was flat, and it pretty much was. Flavor was alot of the round, chewy malt I find in Lost Abbey beers, with raisins, plums, prunes, and some nuts. Good malt complexity as is often the case with these guys. Carbonation would have been a good thing in this instance. It was a 2008 bottle I believe."
"Cheers..."
"D: Paired wonderfully with a ground sirloin cheddar burger (on a Brioche roll) with spicy fries. I hope I come across this brew again soon..."
"Once I popped the cork I knew this was going to be one of the so-called flat Lost Abbey ales. The pour revealed a very dark brown beer with little to zero head. The nose was reminiscent of raisins, dark fruit, dried cherries and lots of hot booze. The taste was very similar. I am a very big fan of the dark fruit flavors of Lost Abbey and this beer did not disappoint, it had all the wonderful pieces I love. I felt the composition of this beer was slightly off base, due to the lack of carbonation, it did however have an incredibly smooth, velvet like feel which I enjoy thoroughly. Overall, I am a bit perplexed by this beer. There are parts which I love and parts that I absolutely cant stand, I think I might have to retry this beer and hopefully I will get a product that is able top to bottom full of quality instead of the half-assed beer I drank."
"Drinkability: A bit to alcoholic for a beer I would really be interested in going back to on occasion. I can see this beer being good after a hearty dinner. It really didn't blow me away."
"Very tasty beer, somehow I was able to down 3 tulips and still want more."
"jd"
"D - Pretty drinkable considering the ABV. Good stuff."
"o - glad to try this. not a huge clove fan, but otherwise its a great beer."
"D--As a quad lover, this beer is nothing worth going all out for, certainly not a bad beer by any stretch, lots of alcohol in the finish, and a little too much raisin in this guy. I found myself a little let down, particularly with how my hype Lost Abbey gets, some deserved of course but this one falls a tad short."
"I was expecting more depth of flavor, or generally a more potent ale with this one - but compared to true Belgian quads, this is somewhat dull. Lost & Found Abbey Ale (their Dubbel) is superior in its use of raisins - I'll be sticking with that one..."
"Taste follows the nose and is pleasant and actually a bit chalky for the style. Nice cherry flavors and some chocolate malt. Overall a bit simple as for the depth and character of this beer as raisins dominate to a fault. Quite nice and enjoyable nonetheless, yet certainly not exceptional."
"D: I'll stick to one snifter, thanks. A strong quad, both in terms of booze and flavor. Probably not the best idea to down this right before KBS."
"This is nice attempt at a quad, and it's a pretty good beer. Having said that, I didn't enjoy it as much as the 4 or 5 other Lost Abbey/Port beers which I've had."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Smelled so good, but the taste was not on point with smell at all. Not worth hunting down. Many better brews in the style. Smell was very reminiscent of Bourbon County Stout but taste was not. Eh..."
"D: Great! Smooth and tasty. The ABV is not immediately obvious, but eventually jumps out and smacks you."
"D - This quad went down rather easily but it caught up to me...the alcohol is hidden nicely behind the sweetness going on...this one was nice with the age on it"
"The beer pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is raisins, alcohol and brown sugar. The flavor is awesome with raisins, brown sugar, milk chocolate, alcohol and Belgian yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- Nicely drinkable given the high ABV. The mild astringency and solvent notes take away from my overall impression of drinkability, but it's something that I'd like to have again nonetheless."
"Big thanks go out to Josh for this pleasant surprise."
"D - Big and bold with a high ABV impacts drinkability, but I'm not having any trouble working through this 750."
"Final Thoughts - Again this is a good quad (especially from the US), but not the best. Lost Abbey has better brews as well."
"drinkability: ok"
"D: its not bad but not good. I would not recommend tis to anyone. i wouldn't say its horrible, but i will not seek it out or recommend it. BLAH!"
"Drinkability: A nice and complex quad that is very raisin friendly. I do like raisin and bread combination. I would get this again but have other favorites from the brewery."
"Corked bottle opened with a pop that sent the cork flying through the air. Pours a dark amber brown color. It presents itself with more than a finger of fluffy dark tan head that has really good retension and tons of lace clinging to the glass. Nose is a sweet aroma slightly yeasty and with hints of berries and some dark mellow fruit like plums or raisins. Touch of hops is slightly noticeable in the back end with a bit of citrus character. Taste is a punch of alcohol with some bitterness induced by the hops. Mild carbonation and a thick feel to this beer. Lingering taste of dark fruit riddled with alcohol is left in the mouth along with a noticable warming factor."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a snifter. Nice deep brown color with a great fluffy khaki head. Aroma shoots out from the glass: molasses, cinnamon, dates. Fruitcake flavor with a hearty sweet maltiness, some yeasty notes, plenty of overripe fruit, a bit of chocolate/cocoa, brown sugar, and a perfect spiciness. My only complains are the slightly too-thin body and the short finish that results. But this is definitely one of the best American quads around."
"On the heavier side of medium-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Don't know if I'll make it through the whole bottle, but I'll certainly try."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm caramel malt sweetness along with some dark fruits and Belgian yeast esters. It's rich with a bit of warmth. The taste is decent. It has a dry, roasted flavor with some moderate caramel sweetness and some Belgian yeast character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty beer with a great deal of complexity. I'm not a huge fan of the dry, roastedness, but it goes down smooth and finishes with a nice yeast fruitiness."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a dark purplelish brown color. Aromas of fig, raisins, dates. Flavors of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruits and chocolate. Nicely carbonated, with well-disguised alcohol. I could drink a lot of this and regret it in the morning."
"O - Tasty Quad, might be better with some more time on it. Body should be thicker and not so much sweetness left behind."
"With that said, I did finish the bottle, but I don't think I will be buying this again."
"D: An easy to drink flavorful quad that goes down smooth despite it high alcohol content. The flavors are powerful and perhaps syrupy at times, but to me this does not detract from the beers overall presentation."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking for a Belgian quad. Kind of pricey tho."
"Overall was another solid offering from Lost Abbey and an interesting Belgian Quadrupel. I would certainly drink this again, but its price is certainly a bit high and with similarly priced Belgians I would most likely reach for something else. Recommended."
"The strong flavors of the beer mask the high alcohol content and, at the same time, make this beer a unique experience but also make it trying to drink at times."
"Not my favorite Quad, and not my favorite offering from The Lost Abbey. Nonetheless, Judgment Day is a fine, quirky Quad worth filling and emptying a glass. Solid, not spectacular, but good."
"D: if you take your time you can get down 1 750 ml beer yourself its pretty drinkable just not the best quad I have had its good not great"
"Drinkability is solid. Overall pretty good, but not quite at the top tier of Belgian quads out there."
"d - definitely a sipper, but something I could have a few glasses of, not overly interesting taste, however"
"Wow...so much better than last time. Very good! Nicely carbonated, lots of sweet fruits...good complexity. Reminds me a little of wine. Creamy mouthfeel. Great beer!"
"This wants to be a quad--it'd be better if it were a quad--and while it's certainly got the sugar and booze punch of a quad, it's lacking the yeast and spice complexities. It tastes like more like fantastically expired juice."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a very dark ruby color. There was about no head on it. This one has a big nose. Raisins, some alcohol, some toffee, caramel, bready, and lots of other stuff. It has a very rich taste. toffee, caramel, raisin, dark fruits, slight alcohol, brown sugar, and lots of other good stuff. I would definitely have this one again (and again)."
"Its dark, though the head doesn't retain well. The aroma is hot at first, though as it warms, lots of raisins and prunes emerge. The same could also be said about the taste. Somewhat what at first, with the prunes and raisins dominant. As it warms, the booze cools. Lots of pure maltiness in this one. Some yeast. Medium-heavy in the mouth, but most of the alcohol is shielded. Soft. It's a good one, especially as it warms."
"A interesting quad with a twist of raisin to enhance the dark fruitiness of the style. A very dark brown with a dense cloudiness from the yeast. Smell is rich and fruity with notes of raisins, dates, figs, chocolate, dark sweet breads and yeasty dough. Taste is full of the above. Caramel malt backbone is delicious. There is a light alcohol edge. Well integrated so as not to upset the balance. Finish is full of cocoa with mild and complex hops, bitter but gentle. They give a somewhat clean profile to the finish but it lingers with caramel, graham, chocolate, and subtle coffee. A tasty biscuit flavor as well. Feel is full and chewy with a creamy carbonation. This is what makes it a quad versus a BSDA IMHO. A good sipper for the winter nights. It brings you back again and again."
"Overall this is a well done beer however I think it may be more up the alley of a BSDA more so than a quad. Regardless it's tasty and worth a shot."
"This drinks way easier than it should."
"D: So much potential, but it came off as really disgusting with the poorly blended ABV and complete lack of head. I paid about $10 per bottle. My first, in March, was flat. My second, a year after release, is also flat. Christ."
"M/D - A decent mouthfeel. Lost points on drinability due to the taste. All and all I don't think I will try this one again. The 10+ ABV doesn't justify the suffering."
"Glad I finally got to try this one.. I will trade for a few... I would like to put them away for a while and see what develops."
"D-Nice stuff, nicely complex with an interesting collection of flavours. Certainly not a ""classic"" quad but well crafted and interesting."
"Deep french onion soup color, maybe a weak cherry cough syrup color. Pours completely flat. No sign of any head. Same goes for the lacing, zippo. Really quite lifeless. Knew when I popped the cork and there was no sound that something may not be right. Scent is quite nice though. Lots of dark fruit including raisins, dates and figs. A touch of alcohol as well. There does happen to be a bit of carbonation left, but not much. Just enough to keep it from becoming a drain pour. Almost cask style. Flavor mirrors the nose. Lots of raisin flavors, make that booze soaked raisins. Really a one flavor shop here."
"D: Pretty drinkable for 10.5%, even with obvious alcoholic notes. I think the carbonation needs to be a bit higher, though."
"This is a good beer to put away a 750 milliliter slowly on a dark winter evening."
"Mouthfeel is good and very drinkable for this ABV."
"Overall not bad but for what it is I'd find another alternative."
"After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to edit my review a bit. I figured I was too generous the first time around. Not sure if it was due to getting a bad bottle, but this beer was basically undrinkable. I described it to co workers as tasting like paint thinner. I try my hardest to finish beer I buy, as I don't like to be wasteful, but most of this went down the drain."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Mellow carbonation works well here IMHO and this bottle is far from flat. Overall tasty but it's still not near what I remember Mother of All Beers being. Will need to snag another fresh bottle sometime."
"This one pours a dark cloudy brown with a one finger yellow head. Smells of figs and raisins, an intense aroma. Tastes of figs, grapes, raisins, and malt in a pleasing if not overly complex flavor. Carbonation is fine, and I'd love to rate drinkability higher, but this is a pretty heavy beer that you have to take your time with. Overall, a fine American version of the style."
"D - A little too sweet for much more than a half-bottle of this one."
"Big thanks to Kaggie97 for the bottle!"
"Overall, this is more of a sipper for me, but I do like it. A lot of flavor. I wouldn't like drinking the entire bottle by myself, but half was a great amount."
"D: It's very tasty, but the booze takes away from the drinkability a bit. Still a great beer."
"D - It's a big beer. It's nice to drink but I can't see anyone plowing back multiple bottles."
"This beer would be more drinkable, if it wasn't for the 10.5% alcohol. After awhile you definitely know the alcohol is there."
"D) Nice flavors, but didn't blow me away. The alcohol is a bit hot and the carbonation level a bit low, both that may have been helped by more aging, but I held this a good year plus. Glad to have the bottle and glad to hit 1,000 reviews."
"Very dark brown beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is mostly dark fruit.Taste is fig,raisin and booze.A tasty warming beer that was really not meant to be drunk in the summer,even so it was an overall positive experience.I would recommend and would purchase again in the colder months."
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's an interesting and complex beer, but it's also a bit much. It's going to take me a while to get through the bottle. Still well worth trying though."
"Pours a hazy deep amber/brown with a minimal beige head. Aroma is moderately sweet with raisin, prune and light alcohol. Flavor is raisin, plum, pomegranate, caramel and dark chocolate. Sticky full body with low carbonation. Finish is dry and very woody."
"D - I would love to try this one again"
"A 750ml corked bottle split with psycohops. I knew something was a muck when I opened the bottle. The cork was loose and slid out willingly. I was greeted by a slight hiccup upon removal. Kinda equivalent to the mighty roar of a tit mouse. Appears the color of root beer with barely half an inch of light ecru foam. The foam vanished within seconds leaving no trace. Aroma / flavor - prunes, raisins, dark cherries, yeast, candied apples. Decent body but quite lacking in the carbonation dept. The low carbonation makes this one a bit hard to drink and enjoy."
"Conclusion: This was quite nice; a drinkable Quad full of character...this really shone with pairings, however. It was great as a dessert course with German Butterkase cheese, dried figs, and dark Belgian chocolate."
"A wonderfully complex brew that, although the alcohol is present, drinks quite easily (for abv). A unique brew that is raisin-y, but balanced. Very well-done!"
"D: At this launch party I remember Tomme saying that the first batch of Port/LA beer intended for Chicago had been bottled and sitting for two months already and not to judge his beer based on the initial offerings...like he was apologizing for it or something. Why bring your beer to a new market if ot's not firing on all cylinders? So far, everything I've tried that I bought that night has been good-but not worthy of the hushed, reverent tones that people gush over their products in. Don't know if I'll spend any more $ on their beer."
"D = About a glass is all I want and I'm not sure I will seek it out again, though it might be an excellent dessert drink."
"However, the main point here is that this thing was cloyingly sweet like my first attempt at brewing a barley wine before I understand concepts of residual sweetness resulting in me dumping that batch down the drain. This thing was so sweet I thought it did not get properly fermented so I logged onto Lost Abbey's web site and got their beginning and finishing gravities and checked it with my hydrometer. It was, to my surprise, attenuated as advertised. Sickingly sweet and no carbonation. I can only hope this was some experiment batch or there are quality control issues going on at Lost Abbey because it was horrible. I'll stick to the other quads in the future."
"Color is a deep mahogony bordering on black. Thin tan head that didn't last long. Aroma of raisins, belgian yeast and vanilla. Also plenty of vanilla in the flavor, with other sweet malt flavor. Some warming alcohol burn. Packs a punch. Full bodied and nicely carbonated. Another good Lost Abbey beer."
"Thanks again Clvand0"
"Drinkability is hurt about as much as the taste is. Boozey, thick. Startlingly, I didn't have any trouble finishing the bottle, which is kind of amazing. I really this will be a knockout once they get the bottling issues fixed."
"On-tap at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Served in a wine glass it appears a very dark brown with a tan head. Quite dark for a quad, but there are faint red highlight when held up to the light. At first I get a candy plum note, but that quickly fades leaving to big dark chocolate flavors along with raisin and very mild peppermint notes. The aroma also sticks with the chocolate, but it reminds me of a creamier, fine milk chocolate. Finishes with a roasted orange bitterness from the mix of hops and malt. Thick, but reasonable for a 10.5% beer. Certainly not your average quad, but a great dessert beer."
"notes- this is the 1st lost abby beer i have had i kind of disappointed because they get so much hype all and all this is a tasty beer"
"Typical body for the style, perhaps just a little thin. Not as drinkable as most, due to lack of a feature flavor. Overall a solid, if unspectacular, example of the style. Try it if you see it."
"Oh dear... Given what I've read in several posts about this brewery, I can't help but wonder if this bottle was the result of some inconsistency on their end. Considering the fact that I paid about $11 for this bottle, I had really high hopes for this beer, and the utter absence of carbonation practically nullified all the good qualities it had going for it. The label claims that it has an ABV of 10.5%, but God bless America, I've enjoyed beers of higher alcohol content that poured with pretty downright respectable heads. I may try this again in the future, as I'm quite certain that this beer was supposed to have a bit of carbonation to it, but I will be then, as I am now, EXTREMELY skeptical."
"A very rich and flavorful brew. Plenty of subtle complexity that keeps things interesting. So smooth and drinkable. Recommended."
"Very nice Quad that is quite a bit different than most. I really liked it, looking forward to more."
"D: A solid brew that disappeared too quickly. Worth drinking again."
"D- easy to drink but still very hot and boozy. Did I just say that? I'm losing my edge."
"Pours a dark brown with little head. Sweet smell of plumbs fills the nostrells without even lifting the glass. A closer take reveals a refined blend of spices. Taste is very, very complex. Easily the most complex dark beer I've taste, and one of the best. Dark plumbs, raisins, and old prunes. Sweetness balanced by spices and a wonderfull, ripe fruit aftertaste. Alcohol hidden very well. Amazing brew!"
"Pretty damn tasty and complex. Too bad it's a flat beer that cost me $13.00 and have cellared for two years."
"Had high expectations for this brew since I've had other Lost Abbey creations that have been downright incredible. It tasted more like a stout than a Belgian Quad. My reference point for Quads are Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 10, and Pannepot. This beer tastes fuller and more enjoyable when it not that cold, but it is more drinkable and smoother then it is very cold. I'm not a stout fan due to the nutty strength in the taste. No much lacing on the Belgian tulip glass that I poured it in. No head and didn't expect much cabonation since it was classified as a Quad. There is chocolate overtone trying to fight through the strong nutty smell. The raisins didn't punch through for me. This beer takes some getting used to and if you can experience a full bottle in one sitting for yourself, I'm sure you'll have lot to talk about on this one."
"Overall drinkability is good. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"It's strange to think of a beer that earns a 4.5 for flavor as an opportunity lost, but that's how I feel about Judgment Day. Having said that, I have a world of faith in Tomme Arthur and will buy beaucoup bottles of this beautiful brew whenever the opporutunity presents itself."
"Tasty, would get this again."
"poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a rich black with a slight redish purple at its thinist point, had tons of thick tan head on it that stuck around for a bit then settled to a thin lacing around the glass, the sent is hops, mollases and strong alchoal and a hint of fruit, the taste is alchoal at first sip that is burbon like then strong maltey molasseses and a bitter bite, their is hints of plums and raisins, maby a tuch of coffiee. their is not much that i like about this beer, it gets slightley better as it warms but still i dont like it, gess its just not my thing"
"D- This is a great quad and one of my favorites. The taste is great and that is what is important about it. For me the 10.5% was hidden pretty well. This is a great job done by Lost Abbey and is one of my favorite beers of theirs that I have had so far. This makes me really want to get my hands on Cuvee de Tomme."
"Once this beer was in my mouth, i didn't quite want to spit it out, but looked at finishing the 750 more as an obligation rather than something I would enjoy."
"Thanks to BrewerB, I think I had this once before at Port/Lost Abbey but I sure don;t remember it being this tasty. I was actually surprised how much I liked this but then I remembered my experience with Lost and Found. Dark brown, minimal bubbles, smells good, malty, licorice, raisin, brown sugar. Tastes like grapes and syrup, in a good way. A little harder to drink as it was viscous like a stout."
"overall a nice selection, but can't say I would purchase again. not a top quad."
"D: as interesting and weird as it is, it does go down pretty easily. i wouldn't recommend it as a first quad, as it is very unique to the style, but drinking a 750ml of this isn't, too hard. interesting beer, but not at all what i expected for a quad."
"No head after numerous hard pours. Cherry juice and merlot colors. No bubbling or foam. Plums, black cherries, and black currants make up a mix of malty and yeast good aroma. The alcohol gives a winey aire to the fruits in the noise. Blackberry Maniscewitz, currants, cooked black cherries, and baked plums with maybe a hint of brandy coated fruit cake. Winey grapes and raisins comes from the yeast and alcohol combo. Wet, fruity hot palate that feels more like a merlot than a quad. I can just barely feel the carbonation. Not a bad sipper."
"Crazy easy drinking for a beer of such size. But I'm a sucker for good quads. Mom drained her goblet lickety split, having no clue it was 10+abv until I told her later."
"Draft Dec. 2008. Cocoa & Caramel noted on the nose, warm, sugary sweet. Pleasant bubble gum component, as well as alcohol noted. Light holiday spices are present as well. More drinkable than expected, also has a rather musty ""cave"" like flavor. Pours luxurious brown to black with contrasting head that doesn't retain too long."
"This is certainly not in the class of the best quads but it's definitely a solid brew with an interesting fruitiness that makes it slightly unique."
"I'd say this is a pretty damn good beer. Nothing that is going to blow St. Bernardus or Westy out of the water but a strong effort by one of the best breweries in the world. Would like to see how this one ages."
"Murky brown pour with absolutely no head. I tried to force one out and there was nothing. Raisins, prunes, brown sugar, dank yeast, and earth in the aroma. Sweet but a little smoky in the taste. Molasses, more raisins, toasted bread, and dusty yeast esters mix well. The lack of carbonation gives this a syrupy, liquer-like quality. Still, this is very good."
"Pours a very dark brown with small beige head. Like all of the beers in this series the aroma is dominated by dark fruits especially raisin. Also, a bit more alcohol in the scent. Complex taste with a nice balance of dark fruits, figs, chocolate and alcohol. A bit too much alcohol taste and warmth that takes away from the smoothness of a beer like their Lost and Found."
"D Real good smooth. A good example of a quad."
"D- a nice domestic attempt at a huge belgian style. im glad i can finally get this in chicago. will check this one out again later, but more than one in a sitting wouldnt be the best idea given the massive ABV"
"Overall a drinkable beer, though it takes commitment to finish the bottle alone."
"D= A very interesting beer that only became more so as it warmed. The aroma was incredible and the taste was nearly as good. I will have this one again for sure!"
"D: Drinking decently, but definitely over the hill."
"D: Really good. Some flaws in the carbonation department. From what I hear 2 years mellowed this out quite a bit."
"Notes from 7/15/07"
"Disappointing, but I have access to some of the best Quads around, so I can pass it up without remorse."
"75cl bottle. Looks black in the glass, but a backlight reveals a deep red color, topped with a fine beige head. Good foam retention. Aroma of raisin, lots of toffee, vanilla, almonds and molasses. Plenty of vanilla in the flavor, with almond, raisin and other dark sugars. Surprisingly little alcohol and a controlled sweetness. Silky and full mouthfeel, but a bit under-carbonated for the style. Pretty tasty on the whole, with interesting and complex flavors. I think more carbonation would have done wonders for this though."
"regardles of my drinkability notes, a good belgian brew to try if you haven't had it before."
"That being said, it's worth the effort to try it."
"Corked and caged 750mL bottle into a Duvel tulip. Pours a nice almost opaque dark brown with a thin head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is loads of dark malts and dried fruits with some molasses and slight spice. The taste is a nice plethora of dried fruits and sweet molasses. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol and decent carbonation. This is a somewhat enjoyable beer, but not what I'd expect from Lost Abbey."
"Not as complex of a quad as I would expect from this talented crew but it's still solid. Would prefer more husky malt and maybe spice taste profile with a more complex grain backbone but it's still quite enjoyable. Alcohol burn and excess fermentation of the raisin sugars may preclude surpreme drinkability."
"A very good beer, perfect for sipping on a chilly evening."
"D - Not my favorite style, but overall well done. A little too sweet for my personal liking."
"750ml bottle purchased in March 2008 served in my DT tulip. Poured the color of cola; opaque and deep brown. Quarter inch tan-colored cap embedded with bubbles and ringlets quickly dissipated into a thin swirl of foam that gathered in the center and coalesced around the shoulders. Some watery lacing, but no legs. Nose revealed cocoa as well as a vinous quality. Some alcohol detected, but not overly boozey. Taste consistent with nose, but also picked up some additional dark fruit towards the back, however subtle. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lightly effervescent; no burn. I've only had a few quads, but I found the overall character to be quite rich and pleasing."
"Drinkability: A decent beer, but it seems like it got a little too big a little too fast. A good idea to brew a quadrupel w/ raisins - they compliment each other nicely, for obvious reasons - but there were a few too many phenols, a few too many funny chemically notes in the alcohol profile (understandable when it gets this high in terms of abv%, but still). Still, it's interesting, and worth trying once if you enjoy the style."
"Unfortunately, I have acquired a couple of the bottles that have the known ""corking"" problem. This opened with no pop, and poured a carbonationless liquid. The smell is great. Rich, dark fruits. Mostly the clearly stated raisin. But more dark cherry, blackberry as well. The taste is quite good. Full on the mouthfeel and rich. I prefer my beers not overly carbonated and this is surprisingly good. It needs just a hint of carbonation to add to the mouthfeel, and to slow down my consumption of this thing. Without the carbonation to slow you down, this thing just goes quick. A very satisfying beer that is close to the way I like them, just needs a touch of carbonation and this would be top shelf."
"Overall this was a great quad. It is a nice sweet quad that does well for the style."
"At $10 a bottle, there are so many better options. Sorry Tomme, but my first Lost Abbey experience was not very enjoyable. I had a hard time finishing the bottle."
"Not impressed at all with this one had a ton of better Quads and I really enjoy the style. I finished the bottle but not one of my favorites"
"I split the bottle with 3 other people and still did not want to finish my glass."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but this is a rich, thick, spicy brew that begets slow sipping. Still, each one is more enjoyable then the last. Nevertheless, the char reminds me of my home-brewed quad, where I felt that I over-caramelized the sugar. Or maybe it's just the raisins. Either way, it's thick and very spicy, and could use more time in the cellar. I've only had this bottle for about a month or so, but I'll save the other one for another year at least. This is my 4th or 5th Lost Abbey brew, and I'm feeling like their a little over-rated. Still, I love Belgians, and think it's great they have a whole label dedicated to producing them. But there are better examples from the other side of the pond that are equally, if not better priced."
"D- having this as an after dinner treat. Not on my session list, but a real treat."
"taste is thick, roasted malts, figs, prunes, raisins, dark chocolate, alcohol is present at first then fades away, end is dry with a slight amount of bitterness and a nutty aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Like I said before, it's not much to look at (other than the bottle), but at least this beer kicked into gear at the aroma and never looked back. Would I drink this beer again when and if judgement day ever comes? I would more than likely go for something better, but it would make a nice choice if that fateful day ever comes."
"Pours very dark purple to black. Smells fruity, of grapes, alcohol and malts. Lots of phenol and ethanol on the nose. Taste is fruity and phenolic and malty. Creamy, milk, chocolate, prunes, raisins, a bit of maple syrup. Finish brings a reduction of the fruitiness and a growing roasted, toasty dark chocolate and graininess. Fairly full bodied, even heavy. A nice beer, though not anything outstanding, imo."
"Pours black with some noticeable sediment. Light head, but sticks around as a ring. Smells sweet with malt and raisins and some other dark fruit. The taste is a little bit hot. There are flavors of raisins, toffee, figs and sweet malt. The hotness certainly hurts the drinkability, as does the sweetness. This is a fairly simple quad. Not bad, but not stellar. Some time in the bottle may improve things."
"Oh and thanks t0rin0."
"This is a pleasantly drinkable beer, a little more so than I expected at 10.5% abv. Overall it has some surprising subtlety. Alcohol is mildly notable, but not too hot or fumy. Taste is not too rich or heavy. Surely not the best quad out there by complexity or balance, but very tasty and easy to enjoy. I recommend not serving too cold, as much of the appearance, aroma, and overall taste seems to improve nearer to room temp."
"This is pretty tasty. A lot of raisin flavor but I like it. I could see myself drinking a bottle of this every now and again."
"Tannin-like bitterness up front. Herbal hops. Dark fruit (figs, raisins) sweetness settles in. Vinous grapes. Lightly roasted bitterness on the edge. Bittersweet dark chocolate is there as well. Sugary plums before a rather warming finish. A little boozy, with lingering dark fruits, tangy grapes, and tannin-like bitterness. Nice. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Maybe a tad rough around the edges and a little boozy, but all in all a nice American-brewed quad."
"Lost Abbey has a winner here. Judgement Day really impressed on all levels, and is sinfully drinkable for such a big beer. Highly recommended variant to the typical Belgian quads"
"750 mL served in my Arendsnest glass. Pours fairly dark and appears murky brown in the glass. Quickly diminishing head. Aromatically, i'm not impressed. However, I think the flavor is very impressive. In particular, it becomes very complex after the mid-palate with a pleasant sweetness, hints of brandy soaked fruits, caramel, cocoa and hops."
"Very big and thick. A great sipper that gets better as it warms up. Another fantastic beer from Tomme and Lost Abbey. I really enjoyed this one and would highly recommend it."
"D. Actually surprisingly drinkable for the flavor and alcohol. I had to fight to savor it. Judgment Day is simply delicious and a fine take on an American Quad. If it comes your way make sure to wave down a horseman and snag a bottle."
"Judgement Day is a strong, flavorful ale that just didn't quite hit the spot for me. It seems to incorporate elements of a stout or porter into the quadrupel style that don't quite mesh with my idea of what that ought to be. I enjoyed my snifter but likely won't be back."
"Decent at best for a lighter belgian style ale, it is far from a quadrupel, except in alcohol content. If I am going to rate this as a quadrupel, it might be one of the worst."
"The sourness in the smell is nowhere to be found in the taste. The dark fruit flavors are there but they do not have the sourness or even any real sweetness to them. There are also some slightly roasted malt notes, but the prevaling flavors are tha distinct belgian spiciness and alcohol. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel, and the carbonation is pleasant. Overall, it is certainly not the best belgian quad around. The alcohol overpowers any of the more intricate flavors and the result is not entirely positive."
"The taste is dark chocolate, very boozey, raisins, plums, brown sugar with a syrupy mouthfeel the taste mirrors the nose. The hops take a back seat in thie quad some bitterness is apparent but this is a sweet beer. Overall I liked this offering I would perhaps aged this beer and see what might happen."
"Drank very easy for the style & ABV, a good, not great Quad. Could get better with time, but seems pretty much peaked out to me"
"M/D: Alcoholic feel all the down the throat but kinda bland on the tongue. It had an ok drinkability not my favorite though I highly recommend as that Christmas beer the whole family can enjoy around the fire"
"Pours opque brown with a swirly brownish head. Nose is dominated by funky heavy fruit (raisin). Taste is pretty funky also, no sweetness, just heavy and bitter. Also, I get that gagging feeling I get whenever I eat mediocre raisins. But, after you down the first glass it really doesn't matter because the ABV creeps up."
"Pours a dark, almost black with very slight brown highlights when held to light. Minimal head and lacing. Aroma hits first with dried fruits, figs, some light chocolate, then some yeast. Taste brings some more fruits, some malt, a bit of alcohol, and spicy yeast. A few sips in and I'm hit with some sweet rum and hints of chocolate. Some phenolic tastes hidden under there too. Lots of sweetness in the aftertaste as well. Thick body, crisp carbonation, definitely a sipper. Nice big bold Belgian style ale."
"Dark as hell, think root beer with decent head and good lacing. Yeasty on the nose, definetly smells like a Belgian. Oddly enough the yeast does not come through on the buds. Malt, malt and more malt with sugary sweet plumb raisin toffee notes. Slight alcohol warmth well integrated for a 10 percenter. This one is a tough call, if you are into strong dark Belgians a more than solid offering, but overall nothing spectacular."
"The body is big and very solvent with alcohol. More of a sipping beer with all the complexity and huge alcohol notes. Feels like it should be twice the gravity it is. Overall not bad but I could see how people would not enjoy this beer."
"D: Great sipping beer, but a little strong on the alcohol and a little too sweet by the end of a glass. Would have again, interesting take on a quad."
"Drinkability- Need to get my hands on a fresh one of these. Tried to imagine I was drinking a cask version, but it just wasn't happening. Good flavor kept it from being a drain pour. If fresh this is probably damn tasty."
"Drinkability: A good, well-crafted quad from Lost Abbey. I certainly had no trouble emptying my glass."
"My least favorite beer from Lost Abbey, lacks the complexity an uniqueness that their other beers have, could drink any more beer after having this other night, would not drink again, only worth trying if you were curious like me"
"M/D: Full bodied, but slightly thin, alcohol is there. Drinkability is OK, it's a sipper. A solid beer but nothing overly redeeming about it."
"D- great sipper"
"Dark fizzy cola brown, small tan head of foam dies quickly. Aromas of raisins, dark fruits, figs, candy sugar, and yeast. Pretty straight forward and one dimensional but solid. Taste is a bit heavy, dark ruum, boozy raisins, fig (again), candi sugar, etc. Smooth and easy on the tongue, velvet like heavy mouthfeel very well executed carbonation level. Drinkability is good. Not the best brew ever, but certainly a respectable stab at the style."
"D: This is deffinately an intense beer, GREAT but a little intense. I'm not sure how many of these I would want to drink in a row but I know I will have one again some day."
"After enjoying a bottle I realized that I should not be driving nor operating heavy machinery. Beware the Judgement Day!"
"Drinkability- Lost Abbey makes good beer, thats all there is to it!! If you dont believe me try some for yourself."
"A perfect brown body almost has a blackened effect to it as it lets through no light. Head reaches about an inch and a half of rich tan fuzz that has decent retention. Nose has a nice mix of soured dark fruits with hints of banana bread, and seet figs. As this beer enters the mouth it gels to a solid mix of dark fruit of bitter dryness is the result of a balanced pairing of soft spiceness and rich burnt, carmalized malts. The darkness that this beer creates really paints the mouth. Alchol is hidden quite well. This beer really punishes the mouth and the drinkability is slightly hurt by this."
"Overall: Damn, damn delicious. Reminds me a lot of a vintage Thomas Hardys. I don't get a lot of Belgian character. Okay, almost none. But it's still damned tasty."
"I love Port San Marcos brewery. I had this one on tap and there, Judgement day seemed a little less boozey."
"Poured into a chalice a deep black color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy tan head, not much sticky lacing at all, but some oil slicks. The nose is malty, slight yeast, figs, prunes, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first, malty, dark fruit, slight alcohol, and caramel. Medium body, slightly chewy, complex brew. Very drinkable, a nice brew, there is a slight twist on the style though with this one."
"Cheers"
"Not particularly impressive. Seems that a lot of breweries in the US have trouble when their Belgian-style beers go over 10% ABV. The flavors are nice, but are overshadowed by the alcohol taste."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I have had better Quads, but this is still worth trying. I would get it again if it was available here."
"Pours a hazy reddish brown, thin off white head forms, settles to a solid ring, and a decent layer, nice retention. Smell is nice, toffee, dates, chocolate, alcohol, very caramelized raisins aroma, quite rich, nice oak, very good. Taste is similar, lots of toffee, raisins, figs, oak, some chocolate, bit of roast, very rich flavour, the raisins really add a neat element, alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, easy to drink and great flavour. Thanks Jay!"
"Beer poured agressively into a Duvel tulip that produced a momentary head. It is a very interesting color combination of a brownish purple. Nose is of alcohol soaked sweet dark fruits and has hints of chocolate in the background. Taste was initially strong of booze soaked raisins but with subsequent sips is somewhat chocolately up front with the dark fruit light hopped finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would expect and does not have the classic Belgian feel to it. Drinkability is good as it has quite the nice taste profile with a slight warming alcohol back burn. This is a very nice beer, like all the others I have had from Port/Lost Abbey. Recommend that you try this at least once."
"Poured aggressively yields a thin ring of tiny bubbles around the edge. Almost no lacing. The smell is amazing; rich chocolate, cherries, and gooey raisins. The mouth feel lacks the effervescent character of the best Belgian variety of this style, but overall this one is a winner. The tang from the alcohol invokes defensive involuntary ""sipping"" mechanisms in the brain. It has a lighter body but the rich, full dark fruit flavor combined with the cherry-vanilla aspect of the alcohol keep your senses occupied. Wow! I will not pass this one up if i see it again. Really enjoyed this one from Table & Vine in Springfield, MA. Highly recommended."
"This one poured a clear ruby red, nearly purple, with a thin ring of very fine beige bubbles. Spotty lacing. Nice aroma with a lot of grainy malt, dried fruits and raisins, tobacco and a bit of alcohol. Light bitterness with a lot of cocoa and raisin flavour, some semisweet chocolate and roast. Pleasant warmth in the finish. Medium to full bodied with well-integrated carbonation. This stuff is smooth and tasty."
"D- A solid specimen."
"Overall I would have to say this was excellent. Really a stunning brew and I was glad I was able to try it. I had not had anything really big from Lost Abbey before and this was a very nice introduction to their crafts. I look forward to being able to try everything they offer and really being able to explore a lot of these great flavors. Definitely would have to recommend this one."
"Pours very dark brown with no head. Nose is raisins, touch of antiseptic wood and just a funky edge to it, but not an overpowering one. Flavor is smooth. Nice even qualities to it with a minor sweet edge. Feel is smooth with a good carbonation to it. Easily drinkable. A well balanced quad with a sufficient enough edge to make it interesting."
"I've got another bottle of this that I'll be sitting on...perhaps not until Judgement Day but for a few more years anyway."
"D: (3.5) I can only really enjoy this is small amounts."
"D-The alcohol is a bit too noticeable which drops this down a little. Perhaps a bit more aging would tone it down. That said, this is a complex and tasty brew just not one I would have everyday. The toasted bitterness is a nice surprise and plays well with the dark fruity sweetness."
"drinkability is great. bit of warmth from the alcohol, but still balanced and very drinkable."
"Belgian style bomber, caged and corked w/o freshness info. This one opened with a whimpy ""poof"" and then poured w/ next to no carbonation, no head and no lacing, hmmm..things pick up with the raisiny nose and then full throttle, tasty, raisiny notes picked up in the early sips. Malty sweet, some Belgian yeasty, nutty notes, rum soaked raisins, brandy whiffs, yum. More quality brew from L.A./Port brewing"
"Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a small foamy head with not much retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry figs and plums with some subtle notes of alcohol. Taste of dry figs and plums is dominating with some rich and sweet Belgian malt. Body is quite full with some medium carbonation. A bit too sweet overall for my liking and it is missing something complexity-wise. Not bad but definitely not what I was expecting from this well renowned brewer."
"A drinkable beer, but not one I would rave about. Worth a try, and solid through and through. This beer is like a B/B+ student, solid, but unremarkable. A complex beer worth getting to know, but ultimately not quite as glorious in flavor as it is in complexity."
"Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. Thin, tan head that dissipates quickly to a rim around the glass. Nearly black body with tiny bubbles streaming up the glass. Dark and almost intimidating. Looking up through the beer, you can tell it is clear, despite the darkness, and this perspective shows a dark chestnut color. Warm fruity aroma with notes of prune, brown sugar, spice, and alcohol. Nice roasted malt with a hint of milk chocolate initial flavor with light bitter aftertaste that is relatively long lived with an alcohol finish. This brew comes across almost as a strong stout/barley wine cross. It is full bodied with slightly syruppy feel that coats the side of your tongue and the back of your throat. The lively, almost fizzy carbonation keeps it ffrom feeling too heavy. Overall, this beer has a nice subtle aroma that is reliatively complex and pleasant. THe taste is excellent and the mouthfeel is nicely balanced with a full body that is lightened a little by the carbonation. I would definitely purchase again."
"The beer pours from the 750ml cork and caged bottle a rather hazy brownish red with a large creamy light tan head that fades away leaving a velum like coating of lace. Nose is rich in sweet malt, fruit aromas; IÂ’d say cherries with a bit of raisins. Start is fruity sweet; the malt presence makes the top feel moderate, touch of alcohol bitterness at the back. Finish has a spiny acidity, alcohol warms the belly, and hops provide some spiciness, dry and long lasting aftertaste, quite a nice drinking beer."
"Overall, Judgment Day is still tasty, just not that drinkable."
"Interesting, obviously an above average and enjoyable beer, but just not up to what other Lost Abbey beers have afforded me."
"After being impressed with many other LA beers, i was extremely disappointed in judgment day. Thought maybe i got a bad bottle, but after reading the last review guess it wasn't just me. I had the same problem with the cork just flopping out, and almost no carbonation in the beer. Poured a hazy chocolate milk color, smelled like raisin puree and had one of the worse mouthfeels I have ever had in a beer. I would seriously drink BMC over this beer. Bummer."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and well attenuated. This is a beer that inspires deep and concentrated thought. Complex and very flavorful. My third Lost Abbey brew and I am extremely impressed. Highly recommended."
"D - A big ale, the Quad doesn't hold back. This quad is brewed with finesse and a dash of raisins. The raisin flavor comes out en force. An extremely drinkable beer for the strength. I would take a taste of this any time there is someone who is willing to split one."
"Note: Trying it again, mid-2011, and while the carbonation is gentle, it is much more developed than in my previous two tastings of this beer"
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a short-lived uneven layer of bubbles over the clear burgundy brew. Lacing is dainty but ample and admirable. Aroma is rich with dark fruits and dark malts. Taste is moderate dark sweetness upfront, tints of fruit in the center, and a slow-coming alcohol warming to close. Mouthfeel is smooth, but I find this one a little limited in drinkability. The flavors just don't come together for me, probably my personal preference. Nonetheless, a nice brew."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. On tap. Deep musky caramelized raisin paste aroma, with faint lamb spicing and roasting toffee. Very murky, muddled deep mahogany, with ochre fringe. Rim is tan. Flavor a beautiful, bold mingle of English toffee and chocolate, lightly roasted been, creme brulee crust, toasted hazelnut and almond and walnut extracts. A very brash and biting run of caramelization and nuts. Dries over these cooked sugars and the Maillard reaction. Good depth and hefty body amongst the sugars and a beautifully guised 11%. Epitome of caramelized malts."
"D: Good for a big beer, a little cloying, but nice. Very warming and tasty."
"A little better than average drinkability but it could be better. I have to wonder if there is a cork seal problem with this batch. This as fresh as it gets without getting it handed to me immediately after bottling and it is very low on the bubbles."
"After stories of people getting off bottles of this, I can say that I have had four of these now, purchased from three different parts of the country, that have not been off. Having said that, this beer could use a bit of work. It is not at the level of excellence that the last bottle of MOAB that I had was."
"Perhaps I shouldn't order beers based on the label art and/or name? (shrug) Still it was interesting... I think I'll settle for ""Worth trying if you can share with several friends who really dig big dark complex beers"". Me? I think I would've been happier sticking with more De Dolle and Gouden Carolus and the like. So it goes..."
"After 6 years Peter FM brings a bottle. Some sourness and lots of sweetness. Pepper, cloves n taste, a unique invigorating aroma of spice, fruit."
"Overall: I like this beer. I liked it when it was brewed at Solana, and I like it now. Different name, same great beer. The Mother of All Beers."
"This is a very nice beer, but I'm not hugely impressed by it. Also, drinkability is not it's best attribute. The malt covers some of the alcohol, but it's still pretty noticeable. Not sure I will want to buy this one again."
"I enjoy a good dark Belgium ale and this one is an excellent interpretation of the style. Good job, Tommy."
"Pours a murky muddy colored cider brown, small light tan head. Cloves and spices in the aroma blend with a nice toasted breadiness, sweet rich prune and raisiny aromas as well and a hint of some alcohol strength. Sweet maltiness and belgian sugars blends with licorice and more clove and spice and breadiness in the taste. Sweet raisins are also present but are in the background of the spiced bread taste. Alcohol is very well balanced in the taste, just a hint of its strength in a warming and somewhat dry finish. The closer to room temp this one got, the better it became, slightly sticky and sweet, but very nicely done, this one can probably age well."
"D- It is good but not one of my favorite offerings from Lost Abbey. Still a great beer though. Very interesting and different. I sure do love my raisins in beer too!"
"Predictably dark abbey. Good color, terrible head. The smell is very port-like. Very robust and raisiny. Taste follows suit, big, malty, huge dark fruit notes. Mouthfeel is much thinner than one would expect, which belies the whopping 10.5% alcohol content. The drinkablility of this is therefore very high. It goes down like a session beer with a much bigger flavor. Take this into account when consuming this big, bad quad. I look forward to trying more offerings from this brewery."
"Highly recommended. My favorite so far of the Lost Abbey offerings. I'll be picking up some more of this."
"Drinkability: The alcohol comes through a bit too much, taking away from some of the drinkability. Still, this is a well crafted and tasted beer that paired well with grilled tri-tip, steamed broccoli and herb roasted potatoes. The fruit flavors are rich and meaty and hold up very well to the sweetness and alcohol warmth. Drink it if you got it."
"D: This beer needs time to find itself. As delicious as it is now, where it will be in 3 years is unfathomable."
"Thick glug pour, love that sound! Very dark fruit forward aroma. First sip I knew I was in for a treat. This has a definite raisin flavor. I taste only a slight resemblence to DFH raisin dextra, which is way sweeter. I like this more, it's balanced, complex and simply unique. Glad I have a few more to sit on and see how it matures!! So far, every beer I have had from Port Brewing/Lost Abbey has been outstanding."
"Last swigs: Quad disguised as a Belgian Strong. Definetly worth gittin' yer greedy mitts on some."
"Notes: 750ML bottle corked and caged. I have been in a Belgian Strong funk lately so to speak. This has revived my interest in the style. Not as sweet as most. This is complex and a 6 month spell in the cellar may be the key to perfection here."
"D: Ok, I don't think anyone's going to be powering through this entire bomber. Find someone to share this with. Sip and savor it. I'm going to dig up some strong cheese to go with my second glass. Maybe some dark chocolate."
"Cheers!"
"The taste is all of the above with a good strong helping of alcohol to warm you up. Complex, strong and did I mention sweet? It truly does taste quite delicious if you are accustomed too this style...if not, give it a try and you just might like it."
