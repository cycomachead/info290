"It drinks like a champion of an Old Ale/Barleywine. I have to get more."

"quad done with valerian root and lemon balm, a nice herbal touch to a peciuiarly light base quad. cloudy medium amber color without much thickness, i am surprised how light this is, with effervescent carbonation it hardly looks like a quad at all. the yeast is forward in the nose, with esters of pears and figs and raisins, as well as a green tea bitterness likely from the lemon balm. the flavor is the same as the nose, not super complex or evolving, but extremely different from what we generally expect in a quad. absent is the dense dark sweet grains, and instead there is an herbal springtime lightness to it that aids in drinkability. i would never in a million years guess 12% abv for this beer, it drinks so much lighter than that. a beer that probably deserves a little more attention on our shores here, especially considering how affordable it is. i wish for more body out of a quad, and thats the part that really threw me off, but i loved the bright bubbles and the dryness on the finish. cool use of these botanicals in a very unique beer."

"Overall 4.0: A unique tasting beer and I do not mean that with any sarcasm. The rooty flavor is interesting and not a distraction. Also, this is a big BIG beer and it is a credit to the brewers that the alcohol is successfully hidden and the focus of this beer is on taste, not alcohol consumption. Recommended...if you can find it!"

"There are certainly better quads out there. This beer has the right notes but the volume has been turned way down. While the label marks it as an ale brewed with spices, these flavors are lacking or hidden by the alcohol bite."
""
""

"O: not what I think of with a Quad, but obviously notable for other reasons....curious about the handling and age of the bottle..."
"O-This is a pretty good quad with a unique flavor that tends toward fruit and sugar, instead of fruit, spice, and tobacco flavors. The high ABV is not hidden, but is displayed in a tasteful manner. This brew doesn't compare with my favorite quads, but I would not hesitate to drink this again."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Overall this was a pretty fun considering this is my first ten year old beer. It has held up considerably well. I am guessing this came out of someone's rare beer collection and was resold..."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber with a slight head and no lacing. Aroma estery and boozy. Flavor of brown sugar, fruit, especially orange, booze. Odd spicy finish, mega booze. Interesting flavors, but not at all balanced and the alcohol dominates. Interesting flavors if it was a bit more balanced."
""
"O: A solidly made, well constructed, drinkable brew."
""
""
"Where this Quad favors the lighter and brighter balance of nuts and fruit rather than the more chocolaty and richer varieties; it has a very dry and warm identity that should settle well with drinkers of cognac and brandy."
"Cheers!"

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve enjoyed drinking this one and despite the sweetness here it hasn’t begun to cloy by the end and so remains enjoyable throughout. My overall impression is that this is a well made, interesting beer that is not quite what I’d expected but that has a lot to recommend it."

"Overall: this is a tasty beer, even if it's not an exemplary quadrupel. It is quite drinkable for its ABV, and it has enough going on to be interesting (if not necessarily for the style)."
""

"O: This was a very unique quadrupel; in fact, it was more reminiscent of some English barleywines than many Belgian quads. A very intriguing and often overlooked ale."
"Served from bottle into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Poured a slightly red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sugar, citrus, lemon rine, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, alcohol, sugar, citrus, lemon rine, wheat, and bread. It had a medium feel on the palate with very high carbonation. Ovearll this was a decent brew. Based on the aroma I really wasn't expecting much from this brew. However, the flavor was quite complex and pretty good. Not sure how the citrus aspect was supposed to tie into this brew, but it didn't kill it in any way; just didn't enhance it. Worth trying for any fan of the style."
"O- I can't get enough, by far my favorite quad. Worth seeking out."
"jd"
"As the beer warms you can detect a slight bit of the alcohol and you can kinda pick out some earthy hop flavors as well. Belgian yeast adds some decent ""spice"" qualities."
"I had this on tap at the Map Room into a tulip. The beer pours a very light and clear maghonby color. Not what I expect when I""m drinking a quad. The aroma and taste are not what I was expecting either. When I think quad I want trappist quad not this. It has quad tendicies you can smell and taste all the inverted sugar here, but not any notes of caramel or dark fruits. overall, it wasn't what I was expecting, aside from that an average beer on its own merits."
"Interesting color..kind of a deep orange mahogany, clear through the pours, translucent in the glass..sediment on the bottom...yes, I'm gonna do the conditioned stuff. Sheets of pastel off orange Belgian lacing. Earthy nose that hints that this one is going to be on the thin side. Raisin, figs and plum, a little booze; all quite nice but slightly understated. The flavor matches up quite nicely with the nose. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel as understated as the nose. REALLY can't believe that this one is 12% ABV. Drinkability??your call. This one will creep up and bite you in the a$$, but crazy incognito. Recommended for those who consider themselves quad-noisseurs. Cheers..glad to find this one at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo."
"Reviewed from my notes of a rare cask pour at the Lion's Pride's Belgian Beer Festival. This cask was just tapped moments before I was served a glass; it had been stored in a cooler, so it was at a lower temperature than most cask beers are poured. It has a beautiful creamy copper/brown color. There are two fingers worth of white foam. The head settled slowly to an even skim of white. Perfect lace was left behind. This is exactly how a cask beer should look. It has a subtle aroma; a little cidery, spicy and sweet. It's a good balance of the strong smells you get from a quad and the faint smells from casked beer. The flavor has sweet malts up front, with some crystal sugar and a slight cider taste. There is alcohol and pepper in the finish. It's very unique and tasty. It has a lighter medium body; surprising for a quad, but right in line with a lot of the cask beers I've tried. There isn't much carbonation, but more than other casks, perhaps keeping the cask chilled helped with this. The beer leaves a great sweet coating on my tongue. There are plenty of alcohol vapors as well. It is slightly stickier than I like; I would rate it a 4.25 if I could. This is supremely drinkable, considering the strength, alcohol and spice. It's such a unique beer, I can't really say if it exceeds or conforms to the expectations of any style. It's just great. If you ever see the BBB on cask, get it!"
"Nice beer on cask."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture gets better throughout the tasting, going from prickly to a more foamy, rolling carbonation. I add the yeast to the final 2oz. pour, and the edges are softened along with the alcohol heat. An interesting, enjoyable Belgian quad that has withstood the test of time."
"Had a bottle for $10 at The Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Poured murky brown with a short tan head. 12% is a lot for a Belgian and it shows. This beer is more barleywine than anything, though the Belgian influence is there. The big fig and cocoa malt flavor are certainly rich, but the body is thin and dry enough (like a good quad) to make this drinkable and avoid a syrup-y feeling. Still the flavor isn't terribly complex. I'd call this more of a strong dark as it doesn't resemble your average quad."
"Very bold aroma, but a bit lighter in the taste. Still pretty boozy. Has held up very well. Not your average quad."
"D- easy to drink and a fine choice to christen my new glass. the alcohol is remarkably well hidden and could have been a problem if i didnt know how strong it was. something ill try to go back and snatch a few more up of. check this one out if you get the chance."
"Interesting beer! Quite good for a belgian quad."
"Drinkability isn't too high, even though it was a pretty enjoyable experience. This is super strong, and while the ABV is well hidden, the flavors are intense, and it's not something you'd want a second glass of, even if you really enjoyed the first. While far from pedestrian, I thought it was overall of average quality."
"Nice sipper I didn't really expect the strong citrus flavors in this beer. Haven't quite decided if I like this one or not, but it surely isn't a weekly flavored beer. Really need to find a big bottle of this and give it a further more intense analysis."
"Poured a dark plum color with a slight cream colored head. Aroma of sweet berries balanced out by a nice sour scent. I was expecting this to be very sour but was surprised by the nice balance of dark fruits and bitter sourness. Very drinkable enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazy chestnut with a decent head that mostly fades , but sticks around as a thin, swirly cap. Fruity and slightly funky with persimmon and apricot. No hint of the bandaid aroma that you sometimes get with this brewery. The taste is quite a bit more sour, but with more sweet persimmon to balance the the flavors. A touch of lemon and sweet red apple rounds it out. Quite tame and smooth for the style, and the alcohol is unbelieavably well hidden. Nice, if a bit on the soft side."
"Talk about from one extreme to another - the beer before was a tropical piss and now this. Age a small wedge of world champion aged gouda to set my mouth up. Yum! Worked perfect. Poured with a tan head. No lace. Hazy brown color. Odd mix of aromas: dark, ripe fruits, dark malts, a hint of wet cardboard, fudge, nuts, and and cocoa. Flavor was a little lighter. More of the dark, ripe fruits, some yeast, and honey. Soft body with a bit of tang from carbonation. Not much apparent alcohol surprisingly. Not the heavy hitter I would've expected either. Great beer though. Could get to thinking this is a session beer only to get carried out or stumble to bed."
"D.Excellant for a quad, I would be able to drink two of these and enjoy the whole ride a third would be pushing it.The alcohol is also a factor to consider at 12%."
"taste is medicinal(in a good way) figs, prune-bitterness, dates, thinner than most quad,mouthfeel is more of a farmhouse ale. Bitterish on the finish,but very drinkable. I never could have guessed from the cleanliness of the finish that this beer apprached anywhere near 12%abv, this is a well-masked high abv quad, very well executed."
"D: The abv of 12% is very well hidden, perhaps to much so. Very sweet and a very good try."
"This is a nice malty Belgian whose mouthfeel feels like its going to start out as a Flemish red, but quickly develops into heavy malt instead of sweetness or tartness. The color is a cloudy amber with a large, foamy head that dissipates into lingering lace. The smell makes it hard to pin down the style, but some booziness is detectable after a strong whiff. I think this would be best with some sturdy, aromatic type of food, like blue cheese, to go with it, more so than drinking it by itself."
"Poured from the bottle with a finger of head which was gone quickly. This beer had a light brown/deep amber color. Smelled like dates. Initially tasted raisens, dates, and carmel. Then, some resiliant hops. Lightly sweet, fairly smooth. Medium body with the 12% etoh felt on the tongue as I let the beer sit. Very good, I'm glad I was able to sample this rather rare brew."
"Edit: I started this one when it was much too cold. The medicinal and sour flavors mellow a bit as it warms, while the alcohol comes to the front, making for a more whiskey/brandy character. More enjoyable, but still a bit raw. Since I bought it in Chattanooga in a liquor store, so i suspect it has had plenty of time on the shelf to age, if not in the best conditions."
"Drinkability- Really enjoyed this one. Have one more in my stash. Think I will age it for a few more years to see how it fares. Great flavors!"
"Nice cloudy mahogany color. Aroma and flavor are pretty much identical... raisins, figs, dates, caramel malts, and spicy. Alcohol is basically undetectable. Delicious, warming and fairly complex, this beer is a real treat. Pick up a few if you can find it."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. I found it was better when it warmed up, say around 55 to 60 F. I noticed that even as it warmed, no alcohol showed up in the smell or taste."
"The mouthfeel is rather foamy/frothy. Some called this sour. I do not agree. Rather smooth for a strong one. Good drinking."
"glad to have had the opportunity to have this on tap."
"Overall experience: I had this beer one other time. Don't remember it like this at all. Fuller bodied...more malt presence. Dark Caramel notes."
"Reminds of what a Belgian take on a Barleywine would be like.. alot of malt.. fair amount of yeastiness.. a little spiciness and sit back and enjoy. This brew has been available in Boise on and off over the last few years and this is probably my 4-5th time sampling it....I will buy it again, but sparingly.. a little pricey."
"Pours a clouded dark amber brown with a small amount of tan head that does not stay around too long. Nose is strong with raisins and a bit of caramel. Also musty tones lingering as well. Flavor is smooth and sweet. Not a huge range of character, but still well made. The alcohol is extremely well hidden for being 12%. Feel is the expected with not a huge amount of carbonation. Definitely drinkable. May not be the greatest quad ever, but it is certainly well made and is good to try."
"Body is quite big with active carbonation and a creamy, full mouthfeel. I like the addition of Valerian and Lemonbalm, although I cannot taste them. Nice and worth the 5 bucks or so that I paid for this."
"Overall this was unique and wonderful. Something a bit different that I really was not expecting, but that was a wonderful surprise. I really enjoyed how well the yeast was able to morph into different flavors as the temperature changed during the session and found this to be on the whole very warm and enjoyable. I greatly look forward to trying this again in the near future."
"D-This beer has some nice big sweetness with a nice alcohol finish but not much depth in the flavor. The plastic note as a bit odd but the rest of the flavor compensated for it."
"Comment: I love quads and this is definitely at home in the quad family. However, for a Belgium quad it falls short of some of its Trappist cousins, as well as short by a long shot from its brother from the same brewery."
"10oz glass, $8, on-tap at Ebenezer's Restaurant and Pub Lovell, ME. Seems to be quite different from the bottled version - white head, flavor is sweet and tart with a nose that has a tartness to it. Clean finish."
"This is a good quad, but I'm not tempted to wax poetic. On the positive side of the ledger, it's one of the more drinkable high-ABV ales that you'll find and probably ages like a dream (this bottle is at least one year old, perhaps two). I'm sure they have no interest in using it, but my newly created motto for this brewery is 'usually good, always interesting'. BBBourgondier is both."
"Drinkability: I can't honestly recommend this one at all. The words ""stop"" and ""no"" pop-up in my mind whenever I see this beer in stores now."
"A very tasty, extremly yeasty and dry beer, with an attractive orange glow, a firm and frothy head, a vibrant, almost bursting aroma and a sticky, nearly cloying maltiness, yet it remains extremely soft and shows the delicacies of Belgian yeast and subtle spicing."
"I've never given a beer a perfect score before, but I'll be damned if this ain't one of the best beers in Ebenezers. Warming, smooth, and this beer will kick your ass. Dark, rich, malty, with the 12% abv very well hidden, with a nice sweet balance. Very lightlty hopped, this is a VERY BIG BEER. WARNING: THIS WILL KICK YOUR ASS! highly recommended Chris"
"Highly recommended. To be entirely honest, I don't understand why this beer is below 4 for the average review. I'd put this up there with the best of the Belgians."
"Nice chewy mouthfeel with flavors of ripe pear dipped in caramel. Warming alcohol appears towards the finish, but for 12% ABV, it is masked extremely well. A very pleasant, easy to drink enjoyable quad. Not overly complex, but tasty."
"D - A pleasing quad, milder than some, but its flavors are nicely balanced. The alcohol is one fo the main flavors, but it astonishing smooth and pleasant. Worth a try. If I see this on-tap, I doubt I will be able to resist."
"Generally I like it, but it's a little too rich for my blood. In my world, I would take a Rochefort or something else first, but this is good enough!"
"Quite drinkable for what it is. Strange and wonderful stuff."
"T/M/D- Thick and sweet...the sugars and fruit(cherry, raisin,and plum) are present in the body, a pungent hop alcohol burst right before the finish, and the beer lives on your mouth between sips....there is a really unique oily lemony finish....I really have not experienced anything quite like this...I look forward to trying more beers from this brewer."
"The amount of complexity and bouquet of flavors and aromas made this beer very drinkable, having me look forward to each new sip. This was an outstanding quad, at the top with Rochefort 10 and Westy 12. I'm off to the store to stock up on some more."
"A bit expensive, but worth trying, for sure. And certainly a sweet one, getting warmer as we go along...almost done now, and it's creeping up on me!"
"D: Interesting beer. More like a dubbel with seasonings than a quad (except for the alcohol content). This one would develop some interesting characteristics with a few years of age...not sure how old mine was."
"Great beer, but word to B.United..sort the label out, its bloody naff !!"
"Pours a deep reddish brown, and in a tulip glass the head was most excelent.The smell was sweet, with lots of dark fuits (dates, figs, raisins), and good belgian ale yeast. The taste was very malty and fruity, and fairly sweet as well. The mouthfeel was slightly syupy with slight carbonatoin, and the alcohol presence was masked extremely well. Drinkability was low, only because this is a sweet, thick beer with lots of booze in it."
"Drinkability: Carbonation. I have had tap waer with more carbonation than this beer. Flat as can be, this at least needs a little something."
"D- Very smooth, easy to drink, lots of flavor. Good example of a quadrupel, although not as distinct as a Rochefort 10 or a Westvleteren 12."
"Not too shabby but there are plenty of brews out there for less money that are easier to get a hold of that I'd pick before this one."
"This came highly recommended, so I expected a lot. At first sight... yeck, not a pretty beer. Looks like muddy water. However, looks can be deceiving, so I'll look past it... Smell is raisins. Sweet, alcoholic, raisins. Taste is a bit less intense- still lots of alcoholic raisins, but not as overwhelming. Sweet, a bit bready. Mouthfeel is chewy, sudsy, more bubbly than I'd expect for such a high alcohol brew. Overall quite drinkable, and pretty tasty. Good bang for your buck. And alcohol is waaaay sneaky."
"This is good but would probably earn a better score from me in the winter"
"Clear mahogany, a gentle pour producing nothing but the barest wisp of head. Minimal aroma, requiring me to stick my nose in the glass. Hot, fusel alcohol and rum soaked fruit. Maraschino cherry. The flavor opens with huge syrupy sweetness. Gooey caramel malt suprersaturated with candi sugar. Hot and boozy right from the start. Incredibly sweet, with that lingering saccharine bite in the end. I'd say it's cloying. Super fruity and packed with alcohol, like cherry syrup cut with grain alcohol. Peppery phenols into the finish, mostly overwhelmed by the hot, hot booze. Very little carbonation, enhancing the massive sweetness and slick mouthfeel. Crazy, and hard to drink. I feel like I could breathe fire."
"Drinkability is O.K., but to answer the question of would I have another? Probably not for a little while, but I respect this beer for what it is."
"This is pretty much ""just okay"" to me, straight down the line. I would never be able to distinguish it from a thousand other Belgians."
"Drinkability: pretty good for a quadrupel since the alcohol is not overbearing, but the sweetness may get old after a glass or two. Definitely worth trying."
"Aroma is subdued..some fruit cake spices and hint of sweet malt. Cloudy brown with a good sized creamy tan head. Fore is malty with medium clove/rum cake spiciness. Very bready with a sweet spiced pudding finish. Mild bannana flavors develop as it warms."
"Nice one that I'll have again. And again, and again, and again."
"Notes: Thanks to Terry Boyd on his recommendation. This was a satisfying beer. I wish I could have another, but I'll have to find it again first."
"Exceptional!"
"An enjoyable beer. Interesting complexity and worth a try."
"the colour, A cloudy juice with apple and pear. The smell, a yeasty odour with booze, like something not ready to serve. Taste and mouthfeel - so, so, was better than warmed. Faintest whisp of head and lace. Low carbonation, after a bit of pop in the open. Was this to be served 3 years ago, or needs 6 more months to ferment?"
"first taste brings out a yeast/malt profile very reminiscent of westvleteren 12. then i get hit with spices.. (bottle says 'valerian and lemon balm'). berries, bananas and raisins to me. sweet burnt sugar. stille nacht comes to mind in the aftertaste. funny that i drank it out of a st. bernardus glass... this beer imitates and captures certain elements of all these big belgians. well done clone- would be a great substitution for the expensive stuff if it wasnt expensive itself. good, but in a weird place ratingswise."
"The beer was well behaved on the pour with a little head and a malty honey alcohol nose. It is a dark brown opaque ale with small bubbles that just looked creamy. It is creamy with an instant alcohol warmth. The taste is surprisingly light and dry with alcohol dominating the palate. Nice sweetness with a citrus dryness making for a clean finish. The label read ale with spices but I cant taste spices other than coriander is a minor way. As it warms, the flavors come together better but this may need a year or three to mellow. It also is a bit thin."
"Pours a slight murky/cloudy/dirty apricot with a thick, guazey white head. I seem to really like the look of a dirty beer! Smells of caramel/toffee malts, cardamom, licorice, and big, spicy medicinal hops. Almost smells like an English Barleywine (with spices). Big malty sweetness with stewed fruit cocktail up front. Big, spicy (fennel), medicinal warming hops and alcohol come on strong and remain so into the finish. Too cough syrupy, and with the fennely spices, not the greatest combination. Cloying and syrupy big mouthfeel. Nice looking and smelling, but...taste...could barely finish."
"A very tasty and drinkable beer. I'm looking forward to trying other beers from this brewery."
"Pours a very murky deep amber color. Reminds me of apple cider. There was a small amout of sediment or crust around the mouth of the bottle-this might have made it cloudier then it should be. Nice aroma-hints of vanilla,caramel,brown sugar. Good oakey notes-earthy and yeasty. All the different smells are nicely balanced. Big sweet flavor up front-raisen like. Slightly sweet. 12%???!!!! Not from where Im sitting-high abv is very well hidden. Somewhat spicy. Very full body-a damn fine beer. I need to buy more then one next time or see if it comes in a liter size. Well worth buying."
"This beer pours a dark mirky amber color. The smell is of alcohol and the ever so familiar sweet smell that comes from the belgian candy sugar that I assume was used in this brew. It resembles raisins or dates, something along that line. The taste is sweet, honey-like. It also has hints of dark fruit like dates, raisins, and alcohol is there as well. The mouthfeel is smooth. It has the perfect amount of carbonation for the amount of flavor in the beer. It is a very drinkable beer but how many of these can one actually handle. Drink one and then consider switching down to something less dangerous. I would definately recommend it."
"A nice beer, nothing marvelous, but not bad by any means. Another notch on the belgium post, and grab it if you see it. This will not be a repeat buy for me, as it cost 4.59 for a small bottle, and I can get better belgians for cheaper."
"I had to check the ratings before I rated this one. Its incredibly low carbonation. I was worried with the very weak pfssht on cracking the cap, but looking at the ratings here, its either an incredibly common problem for this beer, or a flaw in every bottle. Anyway, it pours a cloudy brown. The aroma has a nice brown sugar and honeydew melon fruitiness. The flavor adds toast and a touch of caramel to the mix. This would probably be a great beer if they pumped up the carbonation. The fact I could drink it as flat as it was says something about it."
"Mouthfeel is pretty interesting as well. It isn't a huge beer; maybe a medium body at best w/ very little carbonation. The alcohol and hops are evident and leave a nice warming feeling in my belly (great winter brew I think). The swallow is nice, and a pretty decent aftertaste as well. This is proving to be a nice find in CT (thanks Spence!!!). I'd recommend it if you can get your hands on it!!!"
"Drinking a bottle of this brew at room temp in a snifter. The beer pours a clear mahogany with some garnet tints, the bottom of the bottle releases some yeast dredges into the glass. I get a soft fluffy off-white head of about .5 cm to foam up. Aroma is dark fruit, ripe plums, raisins and cherries dominate, but I also detect lemon and banana as well. Actually I hint of nutmeg perhaps too. First sip reveals a thinner body than expected with very smooth, gentle and almost non-existent carbonation. Flavor is generally sweet, with ripe fruit coming through again, plums and prunes mix with caramel and again the lemon shows up. I get a bit of bitter earthy hop presence on the finish as well. A quite tasty and easy to drink beer. Very smooth for 12%."
"Pours a still muddy burgundy with tons of powdery sediments. No head. No pop on opening. Very fruity nose: perfumey pears, plums, oranges, apples. Sweet caramel. woody spiciness, cinammon. Moderately yeasty. Remarkably hidden alcohol, but the flat body is very annoying and removes a big part of the excitement which is sad because there is a nice range of malt flavors and no yeasty acidity to speak of. Still, I dont know that I would enjoy this all that much as sweet as it is and with nothing to counter it. It feels like a fruity sweet full bodied red wine."
"Drinkability is average at best. Beer just does not have enough to get past lack of carbonation and a real direction."
"Notes of raisins, minty, yeast notes,alcohol evident but somehow kept in the background (even at 12%!), chunky malty center, spicy hoppyness clears things out for a long and complex finish. Get out the stinky cheese and crusty bread, this is a hearty brew, complex, flavorful and pungent. Belgian strong dark ale lovers rejoice"
"Pours a hazed copper with a big tan colored head. A careful pour from a snub-nosed bottle left lots of particles and protein coagulation left in suspension. Good lacing. Sweet, caramelly, toffee-like aromas as well as some faint old ale smells, like straight graininess, some hops and fusel alcohols and a light fruitiness. Good carbonation, which helps cut the high alcohol. Richly sweet, subtly grassy and botanical, and lightly tropical in it's starfruit-like fruitiness. Mild spicing evident, certainly not overwhelming, but hard to decipher any specifics. This beer certainly hides it's boasty 12% ABV pretty well with an array of sensations on the palate, but note it is an asskicker."
"The beer after its escape from the 11.2 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a smazy brown, with a colossal head that is spumous in texture and the color a toothsome tan, the resultant lace forms a glutinous blanket to obscure the glass. Nose is that of very ripe plums, hints of yeast and a bit of fusel alcohol, start is sweet and thick with malt, top id moderate to full in its feel upon the palate. Finish has a staunch acidity, the hops pounce on your palate along with the 12 percent ABV to make it spicy, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a quite decent beer."
"Flavors of bananas, cinnamon, brown sugar, caramel, fruit pectin, gold raisins with an alcohol bite. A taste balanced between 2 extremes (sweetness and alcohol) with everlasting carbonation, the alcohol bite is not so much that it would put you off though, it's more of a compliment to the sweetness than anything. This beer made the hair on my forearms stand up. Not a cheap beer, this stuff is worth the price though."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"The 12% abv is nearly completely hidden in this beer, especially compared to other such large beers. Absolutely a delight to drink. I think this is kind of an ""easy"" but pleasant Belgian."
"It has a creamy flavour, fruity. The taste is even too fruity, maybe raisin. The hop is present in the carpet of flavour. The beer is unbalanced to the sweet. The bitter is noticeable just in the aftertaste. I've tryed this beer on tap at the 24 hour of Antwerpen last year, and I remember it very different (and much better...). Maybe it is the bottle."
