"pours with almost no head.  nice dark cloudy cola color.  lots of sweet malty aromas.  the flavor is a bit young.  i can't figure out the vintage but i'm assuming it's a 2014.  i think this will round out with age.  not as nice as other belgian quads but very drinkable."

"O: Perhaps less complex when compared to the elite quads, mainly due to a quieter yeast contribution. But oh my God does it make up for it with sheer drinkability! The texture in particular is sinful in its decadence. The idea of a more-ish quad is a dangerous notion, but that's what we have here. Every sip is a delight to the senses."
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a decent quad but not quite getting the dark fruit flavors and sweetness that I prefer in my quads, where this is a tad dry and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is strong with a nutty light toffee and slight fruity earthy flavor similar to stone fruit with gently spiced quality and mild alcohol in the taste as it warms with a light dark sugar flavor in the finish with some residual sweetness. Overall a very good dark Belgian ale with nice yeast flavor and dry drinkable aspect without a lot of alcohol in the taste."
""
""
"Overall - Wow, this was one badass beer! I will be looking for more from this brewery in the future because this was a real treat."
"Overall / Drinkability:  This may be my new favorite quad.  Such a wonderful deepness of flavor all around and a very nice aroma as well. This is a beer for having one of and savoring over an evening, and yet with it being so tasty I found I finished it rather quickly.  The alcohol is dangerously well hidden, and I'm glad I knew this was 11% when I ordered the 25cl glass otherwise I think I would be in trouble later.  I will have to find this beer again.  Very well done."

"Nice falvor and color. Steel taste."
"This beer is very different from what I was expecting.  The strong fruitiness was surprising and made for a unique beer.  The alcohol is detectable but not overpowering.  I would drink it again on occasion but it is definitely not an everyday beer for me."

"Delicious rainy winter night brew...cheers!"
"Pours very dark brown, red tint, thick dense light brown colored head, settles slowly to a thin layer, with a sheet of delicate lace following down the glass. Smell: toasted brown bread, molasses, cooked apple and cinnamon, pepper, herbal, plum skin and earth. Fairly traditional but a bit different in an odd but not bad way. Taste: sugary dates, plum skin, burnt sugar, tiny cherry and cola notes, herbal and mildly earthy. Sugary and full bodied with light and creamy carbonation, finishing sticky and earthy. Nice flavors, enjoyed this one. 750 ml best by 08/16."
"This would go well with a spiced cake or bread pudding. It just really isn't worth the money or time. Plenty of other good quads/ Belgain darks . I give it 67/100."

"Bit of a let down in the nose. There were apple and raisin aromas, but they were sugary and had an over done, almost burnt quality. Gentle, flowery heat as well. Tastes as the smell suggested it would. Unfortunately that burnt quality comes across  even stronger on the tongue. It doesn't dominate the flavor profile, I tasted sugary dark fruits aplenty, but it is impossible to ignore. It lingers along with some vaguely medicinal alcoholic heat. This falls far short of the best examples of the style. Too many readily available great quads out there, I should have passed on this one."

"Low carbonation,  taste of blak cherry and some other dark fruits. Very good. 11.2 % no alcohol taste"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - great for sipping, I think the higher carbonation and good balance between sweet and malt flavours gives this beer an edge over other quads I've tried.  Plus it looks great in the glass.  As with other quads, hide the car keys before you open the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark cognac colored brown with a large lasting tan head, light lacing. Aroma has caramel malt, yeast with dark fruit esters and some raisins and black figs. Taste same as aroma with some mild hops bitterness to mellow out the sweetness and sweet alcohol notes. Palate is a full , creamy, slightly thick and sticky mouth feel, good carbonation. Finish has very rich flavor,same attributes as taste with some brown sugar and a lingering caramel malt and sweet alcohol flavors. Alcohol seems well hidden but you feel it in the end. Overall a very good, delicious and flavorful brew."

"O: Awesome brew.   I got this one at Bruisin Ale’s in Asheville, drank it in New Hamburg, ON Aug 19, 2014."

"O: This is a very solid and drinkable quadrupel. It never seems like a beer with an 11% ABV. Quite tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Drink - A little more anise/peppery bite than I like, but still and great mix of complex flavours and a perfect mouthfeel. The alcohol is well hidden and the mix of flavours makes this a great sipper."
"Its spicy bitterness continues to develop deep in finish as the ale turns decidedly warm, spicy and peppery. Taking on spiced rum proportions with that tangy red wine tartness, the taste concludes with port and effervescence."
"Not the best Quad I've ever had but still Damn good!"
"Pours a brilliant deep brown with a lingering frothy khaki head. Aroma is slightly sweet, with dark candi sugar and subtle plum and date notes. Fairly difficult to get much aroma. Flavor reveals deeply caramelized, toffee-like malt character at the backbone, with prunes and dates adding contrast. The finish is dry and somewhat bitter, with a touch of roast. Not as sweet as I anticipated. The finish is more bitter than expected, as well. Malt character lacks complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer and brewery that I've never even heard about, probably saw it on the shelves in FT Collins but never noticed, but I really like this one a lot. It has a comforting feel to it."

"O: really nice beer, but not one of the best I've drunk"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A notch or two above a standard American brewed quad but not quite up to the level of my favorite Belgian brewed. Still, this is a welcome addition to my readily abailable quad arsenal."
""
"Overall I forgot how I do really love Quads and this one was done so well! Highly recommended!"

"Overall: I don't drink quads often, but I do like this beer. It is not complex, but has a nice dried fruit flavor. The alcohol is tame, and provides a comforting warmth throughout the drink."
""
""
"Overall - This beer brought a look of disbelief to my face. The smell of the beer made me expect something completely different than I tasted. After you let it warm a bit it only gets better (to a point) and you can taste things that we're necessarily present before. Hope that helps and enjoy!"
""
""
"O: Overall I'm not really sure.. seems to have a rather unique flavor, but a touch harsh and a bit sweet at the same time. There is definitely less typical Belgian flavors in this guy, but perhaps that's the grain pushing through. While the taste is completely different, it almost reminds me a little of Duchesse, in a yin and yang type of way."
""
""
"O- truly delicious."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of dark fruits, alcohol, some malts. Taste is complex, dark fruits, yeast, some alcohol heat, malts, a touch of tartness, lots going on here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"O: Great quadruppel but a bit unbalanced (alcohol and spices)... but hey still a great one !!!"
""
"O: in no way is this a bad beer, but I expected better. Doesn't hold a candle to rochefort 10 but an enjoyable beer for sure."
"O: Great beer to end the day with, an easy sipper that is well worth checking out"
""
""
""
""
"Very well done.."
""
""
"Overall, quite a good quad."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Great beer. Hits a bunch of high notes."
"Deep brown with thin caramel head. Smell is brown sugar, caramel and roasted malt. Taste is mildly bitter, with notes of brown sugar and caramel. Sweet boozy finish with a bit of an alcohol burn on the way down and lingering brown sugar. Feel Is surprisingly light, with medium carbonation and a bit of bite."
""
""
""
"This is a great one. It is not overly sweet or syrupy nor is it drowning in fruitiness. The flavors are distinct and inviting. Overall I would put this with the big 3, Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Westvleteren 12."

"Poured a brownish body with two finger tan head and a little lace. The aroma is a good mix of typical Belgian yeast and orange along with a touch of sugar and and breadiness, with possible caramel and breadiness as well. Medium-bodied with a very slight sticky touch, the beer has a sharp carbonation and peppery spice edge that adds balance and gives a crisp finish (vanilla?). The taste is moderately sweet, with some candi sugar like malt along with toffee or caramel or bitter cocoa and a chewey breadiness, as well as having some fruit flavors beyond citric/orange like touches of dark fruit like figs or black cherry. A textbook quad with great balance and a mix of fruit and sweet flavors that is a quality example of the style that hides the alcohol well."
""
""
"To be sure, this was strong but it didn't taste nearly as potent as it felt once I finished this off a while after undoing the top of the 330 ml. bottle. While there was just a hint of vanilla that lingered after everything else slowly faded away, there's so much to like here that any Quad or even Belgian beer fan deserves to give this a go, for that matter. This isn't something to be downed quickly but those with ample time will be well rewarded to give this a go and enjoy it for all it's worth."
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Overall Impression: a very strong and noticeably alcoholic quad with strong flavors of dark fruits and molasses. A thick and sweet beverage, this beer demands to be enjoyed over a long period of time."
""
""
""
"O-This beer is not for the timid. More than any other Belgian-style beer, this one reminds me an American-style barrel-aged stout. The chocolate, the booze, and the heavy feel all suggest something not entirely Belgian. Still, it works pretty well and I found this beer to be an enjoyable way to end an evening."
"O- This is a great quad. There is the nice blend of yeasty esters with a good sweetness quality and alcohol warmth to balance, all blended with some malt character. Nothing is out of balance but everything has its place. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Pairings: extra sharp cheddar, hamburgers, tri-tip, and smoked fish are very good with this beer; don't forget the black grapes"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, pepper, light clove, cocoa, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy ester notes. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, pepper, light clove, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, light roast, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible flavor balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Quadrupel! Incredible balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A totally world class offering."
""
"As I try more quads I suppose I may find one I like better, but I tend to measure all beers in this style against the Straffe Hendrik as I probably will be for quite some time. I can't imagine how this beer could be improved upon."
""
"Overall: If you are going to discuss what might be perceived differences between a Quad and a BDS - this might be the one to point to. If someone is new to darker brews, you might offer them this as a small aperitif or digestif and when discussing the spectrum of Quads and/or BDS and any potential differences. A solid offering I would come back to. I enjoy drier, slightly warming booze characteristics mixed in with a hint of Caramunich - the only reason it didn't get a 4/5 or higher from me - but, that is my personal preference."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is close if not a world class quad. Lots of complexities in the flavor as well as a classic look and feel."
""
""
"Pours a gorgeous burnt sienna into my ommengang snifter. soft white head that lingers up and down the glass. The aroma of delicious candy sugar fades into sugar plums and mandrin oranges. The flavor of bready caramel malts lingers as candied fruit wash over the tongue with a warming brandy quality. It dances over the tongue and makes me wish for more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice tasting, though a bit boring for the style. Not much in the ester category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great showcase of what a Quad can be. Could use some adjustments in the taste department but it's still an elite status Quad."
""
"Overall: So close to a truly elite beer. Maybe it is unfair to this beer that I have Rochefort 10 and 8 very readily available in my area which makes my standards insanely high for beers of this essence. You can tell the craftsmanship is simply not there with this beer. It is worth the extra few dollars for truly world class products."
""
""
""
""
"M- Smooth and dry. Not overly carbonated."
"D: This was a solid quad with a refined scent and taste and great body. The finish was surprisingly smooth, so it was easy to drink. Could probably improve with a few years in the cellar, but very nice fresh. Not the top of this style, but still fully enjoyable."
"This is still very well done. A beer I will buy again, and I'm not sure why I waited this long to finally try it."
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the style Quadrupel."
""
"Overall - One of the best I've had. Complex, just the one almost got me drunk. 11%. there's a good reason this 11.2 oz cost $6."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid quad, very enjoyable."
"O: saw the middling reviews before I had this, and I imagine there is some issue with this beer not quite tasting like too many of the big name quads, but it is a very pleasing and distinct-tasting beer - I would easily recommend this for quad and BSDA fans. It might not blow you away for the style, but taken as a singular beer, a worthy drink indeed."
""
"Overall: Very impressed by this well-balanced quad that is filled with both complexity and restraint"
""
""
"Overall a great quad."
"Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is well crafted stuff. The ABV is much too high for quaffing, but it is very good stuff."
"Overall a very nice quad, I enjoyed it more then some of the bigger names."
"Beer is sweet and medium in body, nice finish, mildly bitter, a little roast in this one, I enjoyed this beer a lot and would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pick this up if you are a quad lover. Well done."
"Poured from a bomber to a pint glass. Nice head, doesn't dissipate, with a nice copper color. Smells of dark fruit and heavy malt. It tastes sweet with a nice dry yet tasty finish. You really taste the malt with a touch of raisins and dark fruit. The feel is smooth and perfectly carbonated. Overall a great brew with lots of flavor and balance. I will for sure pick this up again."
"Looked great and in such a fine bar it is difficult not to score it highly: but I'm being objective and truthful in my numbers, it deserves the scores it's getting from me."
""
""
"O: Great Quad. Excellent beer. Recommend"
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and some slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"O) Straffe Hendrik 11 is a fine beer and excellent example of the authentic Belgian Quad"
""
""
"wow. the 11% alcohol is well hidden unless the beer warms. dark, rich dark-fruit flavors on the tongue and nose. opaque brown pour with half inch foam which diminished quickly. foams sticks to the side of the glass which isnt being sipped from. is this what they call caramel malts? i'll check their website but i'd be very interested in the other beers from this brewery. great statrter brew for the evening.... also, had this on tap at THEGLOBE in garden grove, ca. and wondering if i should be there drinking this instead of at home in front of my computer . . . ."
"A nicely made rich and complex beer. Liquid dark bread..."
""
""
"Taste is heavy on the caramel malts, this makes the beer maltbitter and adds a currant and raisin taste, bordering my threshold for the maltbitterness. The alcohol is well hidden, 11% alcohol is warm, but it is not sharp. The beer is bitter, which is a combination of the malt and hop bitterness."
""
""
""

"Poured into my Ommegang chalice a deep roasted chesnut brown with a sticky one finger beige head atop that left a broken ring of lace as it settled slowly.A slight sherry vinegar note is something that caught my attention with dark brown sugar and dark fruit in there as well,the vinegar element is something I have never come across in a quad.Deep brown sugar and toffee flavors with sweet alcohol,it's cakey and rich with a slightly acidic finish.Full lush feel in the mouth,this is somewhat different than alot of quads and I really liked it,it's a bit raw in some aspects.Great stuff."
""
""
"Half finger head on a hazy deep brown body. Excellent lacing. Simple aroma with mostly sweet caramel malts and some herbal notes. Flavor is very different with dark candied fruit, candy sugar, toffee, caramel and a mild tartness. Medium body and lighter side of moderate carbonation. Very smooth. Perfect amount of sweetness and a touch boozy but for 11 percent not bad at all."
"Overall and excellent Quad. Took me to a sweet, caramel-like place that I very much enjoyed."
""
"O: A pretty good beer."

"a pretty solid outing for a quad. pretty textbook but with a strong taste. id rank it in the top 10 of quads ive tried but not top 5"
"D- this is a damn fine quad, with more hops and roasted flavor than others of the same quality. I'll still sweat that rochefort and la trappe but this one is a banger."
""
"O - This quad was a very good interpretation of the style, and one that feels a bit light, but is certainly warming and satisfying. Although this beer doesn't quite reach the top tier of Trappist quads, it's still well above average for the style and one I hope to find and enjoy again soon."
"Notes: December 2013 freshness date. Lot C. Drank on 1/21/2012."
"If I’m going to drink an 11 percent ABV beer, I like to at least get some flavor enjoyment out of it. This quad drinks like a single. It’s just too subtle in both aroma and taste. Not undrinkable, but I’d definitely never shell out cash for another bottle."
""
""
"Overall it's an enjoyable beer. It's balanced but it could be more polished. The alcohol detracts. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
"The tripel was a good one, and now the quadrupel is a good one. That's two very respectable showing from Straffe Hendrik."
""
""
"Brownish-burgundy color with a dense cap of off-white head; moderate retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dark dried fruits and bready yeast. Taste of caramel malts, bready yeast, dark fruits: cherries, figs, plums, raisins, light hints of brown sugar and earthy hops. Alcohol warmth mellowed out a bit as the beer got closer to room temperature. Medium body, tasty and complex as any good beer from the style. Very nice overall."
""
""
"a nice belgian quad, pretty standard in all respects, but the standard is mighty high, this is a quality beer. pours ar red color with a touch of orange in the light. small white fizzy head. smells like molasses, sour cherries, and belgian yeast. flavor is plenty of caramel malts and belgian candy sugar, even some raw cane sugar, but this is well proportioned, not rot your teeth style. mouthfeel is nice too, plenty of bright carbonation at first, mellowing as it warms and letting the strength of the beer come though. great finish. you could make a night of drinking these if they werent so expensive. glad to see it on tap at the Cheeky Monk downtown denver"
""
"O - Great drinkability. An excellent quadrupel. Flavors work well in concert with each other to form a beer that's not overly heavy and quite delicious."
""
""
""
"Like most Quads for me, it's a warming beer that seems to fit as a dessert after a meaty meal...something to sip slowly and really enjoy. Glad I picked this one up, hoping it'll make an appearance at the next Belgian Beer Fest I hit up in late February."
""
"O-I love quads-this one is a large step below St. Bernardus and Westy versions, but still very enjoyable-makes a great nightcap. Will have to see how this one tastes after a few more years in the cellar. Have yet to taste 1 made in the US that stacks up well next to the Belgians."
""
""
"Overall: Good beer but a step below the top echelon. Priced fairly well."
""
"O - A tasteful delight always nice to have some on you're shelf."
""
"Overall - exceptional beer. MUST try. I will be buying this again, particularly if I can find cases."
"O: Not the best quad that I've had, but it is quite drinkable. The faintness of the alcohol makes this a potentially dangerous beer. I wish there was more on the aroma, but the flavor more than makes up for it."
"Pours an amber color with a thick two finger pillowy head which gives way to skim and leaves nice strand of lace on the glass. The aroma is of dark fruits and caramel malts. The aroma is slightly faint. The taste has a caramel malt backbone, over top there are flavors of dark fruits. There is also a slight milk chocolate taste along with brandy like flavors. At the end there is a very slight hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated. Overall this is a good beer, the aroma was a little faint, but the taste was good and complex."
""
""
""
"O) A delicious Quad. I would definitely drink more."
""
""
"O: I had some difficulty rating this beer because it's so hit-or-miss for me. On the one hand, it looks great and tastes great, while on the other, its smell is not all that appealing and the mouthfeel is a little too boozy for my liking. In the end, this is a fairly solid quadruple, but it has the potential to be so much more."
""
""
""
"A good sipper. Not as complex as the Trappist examples of the style. Still, an enjoyable beer and worth a try."
"O - It is growing on me. Some good quad aroma and flavors. Nothing that really stands out, but overall this is well done."
"Pours a dark brown color, w/ a massive three finger cocoa head. Head sticks around for about 10 minutes without moving. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. Some dark crimson highlights when held up to the light. The nose is really fantastic- raisin, apple, fig, plum, malt, yeast. Really smooth and blended extremely well. No hint of the 11% ABV. Taste is equally as impressive, with toffee, caramel, and a touch of alcohol burn on the aftertaste. Feel is medium for the style, and super smooth. There is a crisp carbonated aftertaste as well. I really liked this beer. Let's hope the 11% ABV kills my cold. Cheers!"
"O - Great quadrupel. Another great find at Sycamore."
"Final Notes: One hell of a beer. This is one to sip on in front of a fireplace in the cold weather to warm up. Would also make a great after-dinner beer or beer to pair with dessert. It is a touch dangerous at 11% though, so treat it with respect!"
"--"
"Memorable beer! Pours a nice cola brown with thick bubbles and lacey-creamy head that lasts for the entire duration of the pint. Nose is rich with musty, attic & cave aromas with dark cherry and an estery/yeasty element . Enormous carbonation and therefore tingling pleasant mouthfeel that hosts a range of flavors from cherry to black tea to raisinbread. Finish has some of that musty quality and more raisins."
"This is a really well done Quad, that I believe would hold it's own with some of the best. I think it's better than the Westy 12 my buddy shared with me the other day."
"overall, a great Quad."
"Flavorwise, it started dry right off. Subtle choco malts with light sweetness melded with dark fruit, more as the quad warmed. Had no real bitterness per se, and could be more complex, but it was still damn tasty. Zum Wohl!!"
"1392"
" I would really like to see one of these in a cellar for nearly a year."
"Straffe Hendrik Quadruple. 4 pack of 11.2 oz bottles. Nice artwork of a celestial moon with a face on both the bottle and cap. Box has a detailed history of the brewery and it's present day status in Bruges. Pours a beautiful deep dark brown with decent head. Has the same nose as the best quads, Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus come to mind. Raisons and figs. Nice lacing. This quad tastes awesome! It has perfect carbonation and the 11 percent is very well hidden. This Belgian, in my opinion, ranks up at the top of the quads. I'm very surprised at earlier reviews as I will definitely seek out more. This is a must try. Enjoy!"
"A good solid Quad, pricey at $9 but worthy."
"Overall - a pretty interesting brew. If I have it again, I'm going to have to remember to serve it a little warmer than I did."
"O – An ok Quad. The booze feels disassociated from the rest of the profile."
"O: hard to find, I've had this on tap, and now bottle and I believe I'll get it every time I see it."
"This is a big-ass Belgian that hides its ABV very well. Balance and integrated flavors are its strengths. Probably worth a try even for those who don't love Belgian styles."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"jd"
"Delicious and tasty, quite a treat. The strength makes it a sipper. The mild hint of hops is a bit different than other less hop focused quads I've had, which gives it a unique characteristic. I would have this again."
"On draft at Brasserie Beck in DC. Poured into a tulip glass, rich and intense dark Belgian ale. It is brewed with a subtle blend of specialty malts, which give the ale an extremely dark color and a chewy, malty complex character. The quadruple combines a clean dryness with a warm full bodied mouth feel and essences of fruit. Overall a very nice Quad! Be warned this is some strong stuff."
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Price = $10.99 at Whole Foods NYC"
"Sold at around 11 dollars at the Giant Eagle Market District in Robinson. I love the De Halve Maan Brewery logo, big bottle 750 ml or 25.4 oz here. Pours a Deep russet, nearly opaque ruby tinted cola brown body...the head layers with a deep khaki tan head fomring large bands of Belgian style lacing with each sip. Aroma has a hint of cherry with apple/figs and other dark ripend fruits let's throw in raisins as well. Hint of alcohol tickles the nares with a heavily malt laiden mild dark roasted edge to it. Each sniff you take, you get more of a vinous character that really builds the backbone of the experience that this quadruple ale offers. Flavor wise this beer is drinking nicely, I'm excited to try other Straffe Hendrik offerings based on this big bodied Belgian beauty. Toasted dark malts brings on some mild bitterness but layers of complex malt also bring on layered fruit between dark plum tartness, deep sweetness of plump raisins burst, with an accent of tannins found in your favorite tea or big bodied red wine. More sweeetness than I can typically handle in a big bodied ale like this but I'm a sucker for well balanced big ass Belgian bier. Mouthfeel is still considered a bit effervescent even with loads of malts it doesn't seem the least bit cloying on my palate. Which is an amazing feat that true Belgian ales always seem to pull off with ease, it's hard to believe this is 11 percent abv, probably more hidden booze than any big American craft brewer will offer excecute. An artform the label states this is Bruges last standing brasserie or at least one of them. Mouthfeel is full bodied but carried so well with some lively carbonation it's pretty amazing. Overall exomplexity and flavor combined this is one of the better quads I've had in some time, a different style than my normal beer consumption is really a welcomed addition and revisit to beers I've tried in the past but either haven't had access to or just haven't desired since I've pretty much devoted myself to craft beer (typically hoppier offerings)."
"Pours a dark brown, off white head forms and fades. Aroma of nutty, toasted malt, sweet dark fruits and doughy bread. In the flavor, raisen, fig, toasted almond and caramel. Smooth on the palate and the alcohol is only barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, clean enough finish and semi dry at that. Overall, a very solid quad with great traditional flavor. Without a doubt this is one worth revisiting."
"Overall - This is solid, but not a top of the list quad. It almost comes closer to a strong ale then a quad. The dark fruits, roasted malts, it would be hard to guess this as a quad. Pretty good but there are a few other quads that smoke this beer. If you are looking for a different twist on the style, this would be a nice sample."
"O: A pretty good beer. Not my favorite example of the style, mostly held back by the dryness of the flavor. But, really not bad, definitely worth a try."
"poured out a good frothy head that disapated slowly leaving moderate lacing. the aroma of roasted malts and dark fruit dominate the nose.Peronally I like this one altough my preference leans toward strong blonds and tripels but this could change my mind on that. alcohol well hidden not overly sweet high carbonation definitely worth a try ,I bought a second bottle after to cellar ."
"I rather like this brew as it's quite unique. If you're expecting the big dark fruit and leather thing that you get from Gouden Carolus or La Trappe's dark brews, you will be surprised. Gets big points for a unique interpretation of the ""Quad."""
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish in color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet alcohol, nutty, and some dark fruit. In the taste, sweet nuttiness, alcohol, and a mixture of raisin and figs. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with and dry dark fruitiness, especially raisin in the aftertaste. Dry and nutty, with a nice presence of dark fruit."
"Bottle shared at the May Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a dark cola color with a poofy tan head. Aromas of yeasty brown bread, candi sugar, vanilla, alcohol. Flavors of dark and red fruits with coriander, fruitcake, raisin, vanilla, licorice, and booze. A bit too hot and perfumey on the palate at 11 percent."
"Overall this is a tasty beer."
"Sweetness hampers this beer a bit. Finished a bit twangy and sugary. Booze thins it out. Character is a puzzle"
"O/D - Not a big fan. An OK Quad but not what I look for. Too much spice and yeast and I could never have a full bottle of this."
"O - As referenced earlier, this beer tastes, smells and feels like a Tripel. Way off the mark for the style, and not great regardless of style consideration."
"Not my favorite Belgian quad but a nice break from the rochefort and saint bernardus I so thoroughly enjoy. The lace is truly spectacular on this guy."
"The alcolhol is well hidden and overall i have to say that this one is a very drinkable quad. I would like to see how this beer is when you age it a few years, it can only get better."
"It's a good drinkable beer. the 11% is not a big problem. It's covered well enough."
"A good quad overall, and must be some special offer since I didn't even see this at the brewery."
