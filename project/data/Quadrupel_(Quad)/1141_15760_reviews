"Something magical going in in this glass right now."

"Drinkable quad, but not terribly complex compared to other instances of the style. Feels somewhat shallow,"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm uncertain if perhaps I got hold of a bad bottle, or if I've been spoiled by other large ABV beers that conceal their payload, but this would not be a repeater for me. I am generally a fan of sweeter beers, but the heat and medicinal tinge taint the whole flavor profile for me."

"Smell of cherries and coffee.  Has a ""mango juice"" type of taste and feel.  Very nice belgian.  Solid offering from Dieu du Ciel!"

"Would have again; worth trying if you come across it.  (4)"

"2/9 - Monk’s Pub (Chicago) - Draft - This is my first quadruple and first Dieu de ciel offering, and it is one of my favorite beers of all time. I went from trying something new to enjoying four pours of an amazing beer. Very strong smell of coffee and fruity. The taste, however is very strong, malty beer. The beer feels heavy, great in the mouth, and goes down smooth. Rigor Mortis - definitely a beer to die for, and highly recommended from this beer lover. Cheers!"

"Was not expecting this to be as good as it was. Light carmel pour with a noticeable drinkability. VERY SMOOTH!"

"Pours a slightly hazy deep chestnut with a decent sized but short lived off white head. Massive chunks of something floating in this viscous liquid. Aromas are heavy on the fruit. Dark stone fruits with bits of pineapple atop a brown sugary caramel base with just a touch of alcohol. The flavor follows the aroma. Lots of tropical fruitiness with a solid brown sugary base to back it up. Pleasant warming alcohol. Medium body with a somewhat drying finish. Light level of carbonation. Nice sipper once you get past the appearance. This may be an older bottle, its got notches that are off centered from the numbers so I can't tell."

"Poured a rich, cloudy reddish brown with nice chunks of yeast and a thin ring of head. A good looking quad, it could do with a bit more head, but otherwise it looks fantastic. Scents of dark fruit, with notes of plum, raisin, fig, date, dark cherry and prune, along with aromas of brown sugar, bread crust, and rich, sweet, bready malt, fruity esters of an indeterminate type and a heavy presence of alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice quadrupel that is rich, sweet, fruity and boozy. It is quite nice. Flavor begins sweet and malty with notes of rich, sweet brown bread and dark fruit, mostly raisin, prune, plum, sweet cherry and caramel with a hint of milk chocolate and some limited spicy Belgian yeast phenols. This moves into a sweet middle that continues flavors of caramel, sweet bready malt, medium-light flavors of milk chocolate and dark fruit, with the fruits mentioned above, but at a light level. Finish is sweet with moderate notes of milk chocolate, caramel, bread crust, toast, sweet bready malt, medium-light alcohol warmth, and light red cherry and plum on the swallow. Light spiciness is present at the end. Aftertaste is medium-sweet with notes of toasted bread, bread crust, caramel, chocolate, white pepper and light alcohol. Overall impression of flavor is of a rich, sweet, malty, dark fruit-filled, slightly boozy and complex quadrupel. It is an excellent example of the style, not the best, but very pleasing on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and creamy with medium-high carbonation and a medium, smooth alcohol burn. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a true to style quadrupel that fits the richer Abbey style, rather than the drier Trappist form, more St. Bernardus than Achel Extra. Very nice. Overall this is a nice quadrupel. It is rich and complex in aroma and flavor, hitting the style quite well and it has a lovely, full mouthfeel that is pleasant and aids the flavor. A very nice quadrupel and I am looking forward to seeing how it ages."

"Drinkability: Easily the best brown Ale I’ve had, more akin to a great quadruple. Definitely one to stock up on in preparation for the winter! Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A pretty good quad, though the spiciness and alcohol heat detract a little bit, not as complex as I'd hoped."
""
""
"O:  Just a delicious quad.  Interesting and with a great name.  Not sure what the ABT stands for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of caramel. Pours cloudy brown with minimal head. Heavy sweet flavours. Full bodied with slightly sticky texture, average carbonation. Overall a nice strong beer, if a bit on the sweet side."

""

""

""
""
"A great representation with big flavors but still mellow and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Although totally lacking a head and lacing and being only medium brown, in other characteristics this resembles a quad. The alcohol, while not noticeable in the flavor, makes itself evident in the following stomach burn. Pretty weak overall, this may be a good gateway beer for someone afraid of quads."

"A stellar beer, hopefully for a stellar game tonight. Go Habs!!"
""
""
"Definitely worth picking up. It's a rich malty beer with a wine-like character along with some fruit and spice character."
""
""
"11.5oz bottle: Bought this a couple of weeks ago, but it appears from the label this may have been made in 2010 (4 years ago). It pours an opaque brown color. There was a very small off white head that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The aroma is good. I get a little tartness (possible brett) on top. Perhaps some cherry, banana, yeastiness, raisin, caramel and others. Seems like every time you take a whiff you pick up something else. The taste is good. I was afraid that it might be bad from a whiff of brett in the aroma, but it is not the case. A very complex taste. Very full bodied, lots of malts but only a subdued sweetness. Caramel, bready, chocolate, some spices and fruits in the background. Complex and nice. No hint of the alcohol. I would definitely buy it again!"

"Another good entry from the Dieu de Ciel lineup."
"Pours a hazy medium brown, dense cream colored head that coats the glass on the way down. Smell: brown sugar and brown bread note upfront, then pear, into caramelized sugar back. Taste: caramel, soft pear, sugary red plum, pecan-y note. Full-ish body, creamy feel, fair amount of alcohol cutting through."
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful drinking beer that stands well on it's on and is suggestive of a low hopped barley wine. Would be terrific with a rich chocolate torte and a warm fireplace enjoyed slowly."
""
""
""
"O: Somewhat underwhelming given previous experience with du Ciel. Good, but a little punchy up front and not a lot of follow through. Bottle says best after laying down for 6 months, probably true."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the sweeter quads I've tasted. It's also sufficiently complex and full. Good, but not quite in that echelon of great quads."
""
""
""
"A solid big Belgian beer, fairly easy to drink. But when you're reaching for a quad you're usually in the mood for something with layered complexity, which is lacking in this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer with 3 years on it. Not sure how it is fresh but definitely try this with some age on it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well balanced quad with very complex, layered taste. More hops that most quads."

"Another well made brew from Dieu du Ciel. While it's far from my favorite this is enjoyable. I actually like the grape jelly aspect. Worth a go for fans if the style or the brewery."
""
""
""
""
"A restrained version of the style. It's smoother and gentler than you get from most beers in this category. A nice change of pace or a great way to introduce someone to a darker Belgian style beer."
""
""
"I'm glad I let this sit for a bit so I could give it a chance. There's some wonderful flavors in here, and other than its unfortunate thinness, this is an excellent take on a style that does indeed require a complexity of flavors all balanced out the way this is. Given the hidden ABV, I'll be sipping this one all night, but there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. Not the strongest I've had from this brewery, but still an undeniable good offering."
""
"Well, the beer looks okay and tastes okay, but it's difficult to get really fired up about this one. Oh, it has it's malt-like presence and definitely exudes its big booze character without getting out of hand, but nothing quite gels to make this one stand out."

"Full bodied and rich from the first sip, overall an excellent beer."
"O: Very drinkable. One more great beer from Dieu du Ciel"
""
""
""
"Overall. A good beer. Nothing stands out as amazing, but a solid quad with some interesting spices and that DDC house flavour (which is not a bad thing)."
""
"Poured into a Chimay chalice. The beer pours cloudy toffee brown with a thin, off-white head that doesn't last very long. There are some visible tiny bubbles along the side of the glass and alcohol legs. The beer smells of bread, toffee, and chocolate. I get an aroma of dark fruits as well. The taste follows the nose. The beer has a nice bready flavor as well as some toffee that brings some sweetness to the flavor. I get some light flavor of raisin and some hop bitterness that mildly lingers on the back end. I also taste the alcohol. The beer is full bodied with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is really really good. Sweet aged fruit, complex flavors. Mouth is Rochefort-like, do wish there was a stronger nose. Flavors are really nice but slightly mellow. 10.5ABV is hidden so well. One of the best non-trappist Quads I've ever had."
"O: DDC says this is ideal with at least 6 months of age on it, so consider this a ""fresh"" review... I would say this is a quite nice quad for a beer out of Belgium. Nice flavours, interesting yeast profile, just not quite as refined as the 400+ year old Belgium's :P ... Overall, not the most complex, perhaps a bit sweet, but still worth snagging if you happen to feel like a triple during its once a year release or ones kicking around in your basement."
"Poured a thick almost brownish body with minimal head on top of a heavy aroma that seemed to have some sugary malts along with touches of dark and tropical fruits as well as the typcial orange/citrusy yeast strain I find in these beers as well as a touch of medicalness/booze. Beer is more of the same as it is thick and full and definitely a sipper. A very good beer, I just found, for me at least, while there are strong notes of sweetness and breadiness (yeastiness) that make it sweet and go down easy and balance the hops and something akin to dark fruits like cherries or figs, the ABV gets into the beer a little and as my b eer warmed the alcohol took over and somewhat muted the rest of the beer's flavor profile. A nice beer and I would recommend it but just not my favorite of style."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Overall- A really nice beer. Balanced, strong, delicious, enjoyable, and well made."
""
""
""
""
"Slightly all over the board. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not great. At $5/12oz it's a good value and should be considered a ""try"". Cheers!!! Can't wait to see how it cellars."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A decent quad from Dieu du Ciel! While it isn't as refined as many others and the alcohol takes over at times, it is definitely an enjoyable beer, but I'm not sure I'd buy this again with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 so readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice example of a Belgian definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"O - Great, well rounded brown. May I have another?!"
"The taste is powerful with a notable barley malt sweetness up front followed by molasses, and black licorice and completing its evolution with a moderate to high bitterness that reminds you what it was you just drank. This is also something that would cellar quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent, Nothing super exciting, Probably wouldn't buy again at it's price point."
""
""
"D/O: Overly-sweet and bready, it wore on me as time wore on. It's not a terrible beer. I'd have another if it was handed to me. But I won't seek it out again."
""
""
""
"M: very little heat, well-balanced, drinkable and true to type, very smooth"
""
"O: Not a bad quad, just fairly simply and quite boozy (despite this bottle being at least a year or two old). Tastes more like a belgian brown ale than a quad to be honest as well."
""
"OVERALL: A decent quad, but nothing crazy. Flavor was there, but it could have been bolder, especially initially. A quality beer worth checking out if you get the chance, but nothing worth jumping through hoops for, especially if you have access to the Belgian examples of the style."
""
""
""
"Rigor Mortis is definitely a good Quad, which doesn't often come out of other countries besides Belgium IMO. This one is on the edge of alcohol/phenol levels but it doesn't take over and ruin the beer. Big yeast character."
"Paying $5 a bottle for this hurts. Wouldn't pay $5 for a 6 pack of it in the future."
"I poured the beer into a chalice. It has a nice auburn like color. The head is cream colored. I can smell cherries but nothing else, and even that is faint (my weak sense of smell). I can taste cherry and a fruitiness. There's also a sweetness to the beer. I can taste a roasty finish with some alcohol burn. There's a cloying aftertaste that I'm not impressed with."
"0 - A reasonable quad/dark belgium ale which goes down well on a winters night. Not the best quad going around but definitely worth a try."
"Definitely one of the best beers Dieu Du Ciel has on offer. Perfect as we come into the Fall season. A very pleasant beer that needs to be tried."
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. Not fantastic."
"Pours a hazy brown-ish to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, mellow caramel with a note of chocolate. In the taste, sweet, malty caramel with a chocolate like end. A small bite and a a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel, with a hint of cocoa in the aftertaste. Hides the 10%, lack of nose, a small dry alcohol note in the end, and nice flavors of caramel and chocolate."
""
""
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep, murky red brown. Fine thin head and nice lacing. Caramel malt and Belgian spice and yeast aroma. Nice body, sweet caramel malt with light fruit and Belgian yeast. Malty, bitter finish. Excellent."
""
""
"O: All around a decadent beer. I really enjoy it and I can't get over this sour note I taste... is that on purpose or did I buy a bottle that's just a little contaminated?? Who knows but the result is good."
""
""
""
""
"O: To categorize this as a quad may be a bit misleading. It is most certainly a belgian style brown ale as described on the bottle. That being said, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Just a slightly above average dark belgian ale."
"A tasty example of the style with plenty to offer the senses and style appropriate."
""
"this is a very interesting beer, starting off as a malty sweet quad, but kind of turning into more of a barleywine when it gets to room temperature. pours slightly hazy dark, raisin colored, with a one inch tan head. smells like dark and red malts, belgian yeast, wood, dried cherries, and caramel. flavor isnt sweet at all really, more of a malt driven beer, although the yeast adds some very unique undertones of spice. hard to describe, not fruity, not sweet, different for a quad. when it warms it becomes a totally different beer. hops becomes a dominant flavor in the finish, and the alcohol really comes out as the carbonation totally dies. major transformation from the almost refreshing first sip. mouthfeel is pretty solid, fuller bodied with fairly standard carbonation. overall a nice beer, but for the price i might skip it next time."
""
""
""
"originally reviewed: 12-27-2010"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, warming, and semi dry with nutmeg."
""
""
"Conclusion: you can tell it has those brown ale notes, it is called a quadruple by rate beer and beer advocate but on the label it is in fact labelled as an extra strong abbey brown ale which i believe to be a much better description cause the flavor profile is not exactly quadruple and neither is the color. It is verging somewhere between extra strong brown ale (as labeled) and barley wine (with some very light notes of quadruple/strong dark ale) as it has notes of every groups typical type. THIS IS DELICIOUS going to buy some more for sure! WOW these flavors really do change quickly shifting between all three styles."
"Ho boy, this is as fine an abbot as you'll find. Poured at a great temperature with a small to medium sized, tan head that soon settled to a light swirl and a little lace. Color is a hazy dark copper with a couple of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, bread dough, yeast, dark ripe fruit, toffee. Flavor's much like nose and has excellent balance between a little hop/malt bitter, plenty of yeast bitter, carbonic tang, and sweet. Interestingly sweet seems to fade a bit. Body and carbonation are spot on. Finish is like flavor, boozy, and long. Superior beer."
"Low C"
"Heavily spiced flavor, much of it lingers after swallowing. Some sweetness from the dark fruits & malt. Harsh booze character dominates everything though. I'm unimpressed with this DDC brew."
""
""
""
"Overall - Enjoyable quad by Dieu du Ciel. Despite the creepy corpse image on the bottle, the flavours in this brew are quite warm and inviting. ABV is noticeable, making this more of a sipper. A nice addition to Dieu du Ciel's lineup - not for the faint of heart."
"O: I expect the best from Dieu du Ciel, but this bottle didn't quite deliver. Mediocre quad, pretty okay abbey ale, good beer. Recommended if you don't have to pay through the nose for it. Probably won't have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"B- to C+"
"O: Another great Dieu du Ciel!. I wouldn’t necessarily drink more than one of these in a night, but it is a nice culminating point. I definitely would recommend trying. I would look forward to aging a bottle to see how it evolves. A good representation of the style in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"D - Decent but not much that makes it stand out."
"11.5 ounce bottle into chalice, batch 15(or something). Pours cloudy dark brown color with a small light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some small bits of lacing on the glass. Aromas of big plums, molasses, chocolate, caramel, candi sugar, bread, raisins, and a bit of yeast spices and light alcohol. Very nice and well balanced aromas. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, molasses, dark fruit, herbal spiciness, pepper, and spicy alcohol. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is limited due to some booziness but it is a pretty nice sipper. Alcohol is noticeable, but not too bad. Overall this is a pretty nice Quadrupel. Some good flavor complexity and balance. If it was a bit less boozy I probably would have liked it more."
""
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a reasonably good beer that goes down relatively easily. My overall impression is that it is well made but does not quite hit the mark for me. It seems a bit rough around the edges and a bit lacking in complexity for a BDSA. Perhaps it needs a bit more time in the cellar."
""
""
"This is a full bodied brew that is creamy and full in the feel. It has a moderate amount of carbonation and overall is a very well put together take on the style. This initial reaction to this brew based soley on the aroma is wow, this is going to be a sickeningly sweet mess. But after the first sip, you are pleasantly caught off guard. Well done. I have no have many offerings from Dieu du Ceil but the ones I have had were quite enjoyable. Certainly worth a try."
"M - Full bodied, not too thin, but not syrupy either. Great carbonation level. A bit sticky on the sides of your mouth."
""

"I'm still not totally sure about how a quad is all that different from a Belgian strong dark. But this was really tasty!"
""

"Overall a pretty good quad but not as good as the best ones out there."

"O: This is a beer that I've tried a long time ago, and that I enjoyed quite a bit. The second time I've tried it, I really like the beer, but it has some things in there that I don't like. It does not have a good ""look"" to it, but I won't hold that against the beer. The smell is good, but not overwhelming or overpowering. The taste is where this beer is at. I would drink this beer and enjoy it without worrying about what its ""score"" is, but I dont think its an elite level with everything perfect about it. And honestly, I am perfectly okay drinking a really good not perfect beer."
"Pours a reddish brown, with a very light offwhite head. Thin film and collar, little clarity in the body with some mild retention NOse is lightly grapey, some sugary notes, a bit of non-descript 'stinkiness' and some extremely subtle spicing. Taste has some light dark fruits, lots of spicing that lingers in the finish. A bit of vanilla and brown sugar notes. Mouthfeel has a low carbonation, medium-full feel and some decent sweetness. A modest ethanol/alcohol heat on the back-end. A decent quad."
"Overall: I would most likely not buy this beer again. I really like quads, but this one while average overall, this is not one I would go looking for considering the great number of excellent quads to be had."
"Pours a murky brown with a light ring of off white head, no lace to speak of. I had to give this a hard swirl to get some head out of this. Smell is of dark fruits, raisin, brown sugar, yeasty, good amount of alcohol scents, plums soaked in booze, spicy with some chocolate scents as it warmed. Taste is full of dark fruit, dark sugary candy notes, lightly yeasty, raisin, plum and berries, lots of overripe fruits, light alcohol. Medium carbonation, silky smooth mouthfeel, medium-full body, good weight. This was pretty solid but I really had to warm up to it, starts out a little weak but halfway through I was sold, ABV hidden well, good overall."
"Overall a decent, easy drinking quad but nothing superlative."
"D - Very drinkable. The caramel malts and candi sugar provide a nice rich and sweet base to the beer with the fruitness and yeasts providing some additional flavors."
"Overall: I'm really impressed by this beer. However, for the price, you can easily get a St. B Abt 12."
"Overall: A quiet giant that is tasty and goes down easy."
"T: Belgian yeast, brown sugar, toffee, a hint of cocoa powder and a hint of hop bite on the finish alongside some roasted malt. Great take on the style."
"O: I haven't bought a bottle of, say, Bernardus 12 at a bottle shop lately, so I can't compare the price. This was 6 bucks for me, and frankly worth it. It's a really great beer. Very much to style, and very much tasty."
"Overall, not the best Quad I've had, but an usual take on a brown ale/quad combo."
"This is an interesting beer, and I can certainly enjoy it. It's a solid offering from a brewery which creates quite a few very good beers."
"Overall, the flavors in this beer are excellent, and set at just about the maximum level possible. If it weren't for the alcohol taste, this would be an incredible beverage. Even with it, though, it still ranks high on my scale. Recommended."
"O: Interesting marriage here. Can definite isolate the Nut Brown characteristics from the Quad ones."
"Not much to say about this beer. It's good, but there doesn't seem to be much that is making it stick out from other quads aside from its awesome label."
"D - At over 2 years this still has the same alcohol bite that fresh Rochefort 10 does. I don't anticipate it smoothing out much more without losing depth of flavor as well. The first 6-8oz went down relatively easily, but the mounting buzz and unpleasant alcohol made the last few ounces a chore. Not Dieu Du Ciel's finest offering, but a fairly solid quad. To be fair, they warn you that it needs at least 6 months on the bottle, and release it in April so that it's in prime shape for the winter."
"A nice example of the style. Very enjoyable and absolutely well made."
"overall, pretty good for a non-Belgian Quad"
"Pours a murky iced tea color with a 1 inch brown head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random patches of lace form on the glass on the drink down. There is some sediment floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of dark fruits (raisins/plums), spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is exactly like the smell with the dark fruit and spices being most prominent. A lower level of carbonation makes for a smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel on this beer. Overall, this is a pretty good quad that I am glad I picked up."
"This beer poured out as a murky dark brown color. The head was slim and didn't leave much lacing behind. The smell of the beer has some fermented dark fruits on the nose, a little bit of yeast, and not too much else here. The taste of brown sugar and fruit upfront with a nice sweetness to it. The aftertaste had a dry caramel like flavor. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall I enjoyed this Quad, I would still prefer a La Trappe over this one though."
"Overall, I do enjoy drinking this beer. It's certainly no Rochefort, but I would buy it again. Maybe."
"Overall: I think I was expecting more from this beer. It was good, don’t think that I didn’t like it; I think I just expected more. For me the alcohol was still a little prevalent and I think it could benefit with some age."
"Wonderful quad. Very easy to drink - scary easy. Worthy and then some."
"O - I thought this was a fantastic beer, probably one of the best browns I have had. The yeast used gives it a nice funkiness and a twist on the style. Very good."
"Beerradvocate calls this a Quad, but, on the bottle, it says Abbey-Style Brown Ale, so, I 'll review it as an Abbey-Style Brown Ale. Not fair to them otherwise. As such, it's not a style I've run across before, so, I don't really have a great reference point, however, I am enjoying the beer. The alcohol is well hidden, and I think the intended flavors come through. I get a nice amount of malt...not much in hops...not much in anything Belgiany either, but if you look deep, it is there. Really nice..one of there better brews..seek it out if you can! It's a rare style. If you want something different, you should try it!"
"O- Not a bad beer, but not really what I would expect from a quad. Worth a try, I suppose."
"Excellent beer. Very complex flavors. I've liked everything from Dieu du Ciel so far, and this does nothing to change that."
"O/D - I liked this one a lot. The sweetness up front fades to nice bitterness in back. The person I tasted it with hated it; didn't like the sweet flavors. If you like sweetness in a beer you should definitely give this one a try. A heavy brew though, so you needn't drink more than one at a time. I drank half a 12oz and I was satisfied."
"Poured a 3/4"" head. Looks hazy brown and thick, kind of like a darker brown version of apple cider. Not much smell at all other than the slightest hint of malt. Taste and mouthfeel is where this truly excells and I'd liken it to enjoying some nice Boston Baked Beans. There's molasses, burnt sugar, caramel, I can almost even taste salt pork, and there's a smooth body but almost a particulate aspect to it like a rich sauce. The taste treat makes up for where the rest isn't tops."
"made in the belgian trappist style."
"Overall: This beer is pretty good. It is defiantely a sipper. I would drink it again."
"O - a very good quad. might be a little too much bite to the alcohol for me but its definitely got everything going on that you expect in a solid quad."
"Very dark brown in color, with a very slim white head. The beer is moderately carbonated and is populated with notable yeast 'floaties'. The aroma has a pronounced alcohol scent, followed by a caramel-like scent. It's a little light in intensity, however. After a number of sips, the yeast and phenolic spice come out in the aroma, but they take a little coaxing. The taste is sweet, yeasty, a little chocolaty, and very warming. The boozy warmth boarders on harshness at times, but the sweet, toasted malt flavor balance it. Full in body and very drinkable."
"O: I was really let down by this one. Peche Mortel got me sort of excited about this brewery, but this was not enjoyable."
"a beer i have been itching for but was waiting for the right mood. Luckily i came across this one when i did. Winter release. Recommend 6 months of storage in the bottle...and the result is something that isn't north american. This is quebec... The island somewhere in the atlantic. Pour is a murky dubbel orange but with more to offer. Nose of bit o honey and apple pie. As it gets warmer some goat cheese. Palate is a meaty thanksgiving dinner. Squash, apple, corn, pepper, brown sugar and honey all contract to a bitterness that dries. Prunes and those preserve quality fruits. A tad leather smokey. Doesn't open up til 20 minutes after opening. Ceiler temp is best because the carbonation is ever lasting as it expands."
"I would say it is quite drinkable a little rough on the mind and wallet due to the price tag and high alc content but deserving nonetheless"
"I remember on several occasions that the Dieu Du Ciel brewmasters brought their talents and their presence to Volo Cask Days, one of the best beer events if you're lucky enough to get tickets! Cheers to Dieu Du Ciel! keep up the good work."
"D- Wasn't really sure what to expect with my first quad. Very interesting flavors make you want to keep drinking. Very nice balance here. Would like to compare it to some other quads though. The higher abv is nicely masked, which makes it pretty drinkable."
"This may very well be the best non-Belgian brewed Quad I've ever had. Wow. Dieu du Ciel never ceases to amaze...just wish the price was better and they would stop using screw-top bottles!!!"
"This would be good with many winter food profiles as well as many desserts and could also be a sipper. Nice effort."
"They gave the quadruple a try and didn't do that great of a job."
"Perhaps I got spoiled because my first quad was St. Bernardus Abt 12. Perhaps as a result, I am not inclined to recommend this beer. The syrupy mouthfeel combined with the phenols honestly made me think I was drinking cough syrup. Perhaps this is better super fresh (or mellows with age)."
"Mouthfeel is medium to average with adequate carbonation. Overall this is a miss for me; with some many better examples of a Quad this one should be passed over in favor of others, especially for $5 a pop for 12 oz. Not recommended."
"Dangerously drinkable stuff."
"This was an excellent beer that I enjoyed from beginning to end. The flavor was smooth and balanced. The nose was full bodied and a bit on the sweet side. The beer was just what you want out of a Quad. Even at 10 1/2 % it wasn't to much although I think one is enough. It is a sipping beer and needs to be enjoyed slow and discerningly ."
"drinkability - a sipper for sure, a good quad that I am enjoying at the moment while I check out this NFC Championship game, good example of the style IMO"
"While the alcohol is noticeable, it's not overpowering, making this one a nice sipper. Not ""dangerously"" drinkable, but pleasantly so."
"I would suggest trying it because I find it quite interesting and enjoyable."
"Turbid dark brown in colour, topped by a thin and fast receding beige head that doesn't lace. Estery aroma of raisin, sour cherry, and over-ripe banana, with a hint of alcohol. Moderately sweet with balancing acidity. It tastes of booze soaked raisins and hints delicately at banana bread, with a finish that suggests tobacco. Full-bodied with a velvety smooth mouthfeel, a rich and satisfying sipper."
"Rich creamy cheese and strong tasting salami goes well with this big, flavorful brew."
"fairly smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. i would have no objection to having another."
"Really fantastic beer from Dieu du Ciel. I would say a apple/caramel notes are the dominant, but they're not too heavy that you can't enjoy more than one of these at a time. Definitely a little syrupy, but served cold, I could drink this all night. Looking forward to finding this on tap."
"D- I love me some Dieu du Ciel. ABV could catch up to you quick as I'm fairly flushed in the face, but an excellent sipper on this cold Festivus night. There will be no airing of grievances on this brew!"
"Notes: I absolutely love this beer and this brewery! This along with Péché Mortel and Aphrodisiaque have been standouts within there styles and they are some of my favorite beers."
"D: Not a beer you want to have a lot of or have all the time, but that's also not its goal."
"First-rate."
"Drinkability is ok but I dont think I'd be reaching for another immediately."
"Pours a deep brownish red color with a thin white tan head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of dark fruits, malty goodness, caramel and some chocolate. Tastes of cherries, malts, chocolate, caramel, and some fig. Feels medium with good fizzy carbonation. A little difficult to drink."
"Drink - I'm not a huge fan of beers with this particular flavour, but it was still decent and highly drinkable considering the alcohol content. It's definitely worth a try."
"I wish I lived in Montreal. These guys make some solid beers, and this is another winner. It's a bit different than most quads, but it's still tasty and ephemeral. I wish the price here in Michigan was better so I could enjoy their beers all the time, but as it is, it makes a special treat."
"Passable, but overall too sweet and too much alcohol. Two dimensional, not enough warmth given all the booziness of it. Just a one off for me."
"D - Not bad for a quad, but I can't pound one of these because of both the flavor and the price. Would rather go for a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus 12 for the money."
"This brew is sweet and coats the tounge with a maltiness and warm alchohol. A good sipper that would do well cutting a spicy blue cheese."
"D: it drank decent but was a bit on the boozy side which made it a tad difficult to take down; definitely a sipper. It thought it was a good interpretation of a quad from canadians."
"Not bad, but I had higher hopes for a quad from this brewery. I'd have it again, but given a choice I would go for one of the more classic quads."
"OK, but there are many more tastey examples of this style available. This one is too boozy and sweet. Try it but dont expect much."
"Although Unibroue is my favorite French-Canadian brewery, DDC is close behind with a long line of quality offerings, this one included. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is coming soon to the LCBO, but for now, this is the only quad available and a fine one at that. I'm interested in comparing the two. Another great seasonal from the LCBO and one well worth picking up."
"Thick mouthfeel, not much carbonation and pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content. Not the best Quad ever, not something I would buy again but still well done!"
"D - Good drinkability for a bigger beer, especially for a quad, but it's a bit too thin. Just a little watery feeling on the finish. Good flavor and profile though. For a comparable price I'd go for Koneningshoeven or New Glarus ABT over this one."
"Not a bad quad, certainly tasty and fun to drink. Definitely will need cellaring for a while to even things out, because again, I found my bottle of Rigor Mortis to be quite hot. Almost too sweet, but the spiciness kept it relatively in check. Will be back for more for cellaring purposes!"
"Weak by way of body, especially given the appearance. Not too boozy despite the hefty abv. Not something I'd ever desire to order again."
"This is perfection on a cold winter's night. The 10.5% ABV certainly warms the chest and is relatively well hidden. DDC has done it again- this is one for the cellar."
"D - Top draw Quad this one."
"Upon that initial whiff, this offering kind of gave me the impression that this would be one hot mess. Nope - very well integrated alcohol, big fruity malt, and a more or less Belgian-esque yeast and hop profile, all adds up to just a well-balanced, and relatively easy to put back 21 proof abbey-style ale. Take that as you will, but take it well and easy."
"This overall isn't bad but I found the alcohol to be a little too overstated, affecting drinkability and the overall enjoyment. If the alcohol was toned down a bit this would be really good, but it was a worth a try either way."
"Well made beer. I teetered back and forth on the taste score, and settled on the higher one. Interesting and somewhat complex, and with some nuance. But it doesn't set the standard for the style. Certainly worth a try if you like the brewery and the style, as I do."
"D-very drinkable even with the high ABV, a nice winter beer"
"Drinkability is, astonishingly, not bad for 10 percent ABV! It doesn't have screeching harshness or sugars that make your head spin, and so it's a reliable long sipper of a beer that discloses lovely new tastes as you drink it."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/11/03/tasting-the-dieu-du-ciel-rigor-mortis-abt/"
"D- Very nice abt. Not something I could drink all the time, but something for a special occasion for sure."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown colour with a decent amount of head in the duvel tulip glass. Tastes of caramal brown sugars with a nice dark fruit taste in there too. The booze is hidden quite decently for this double percentage beer, drinks very smooth. Glad I picked up quite a few bottles of this. Great brewery. Impressed with all their beers so far."
"Very complex, needs some cheese as balance."
"d-surprisingly drinkable. The sweetness wasn't overpowering and nicely balanced by the alcohol spiciness."
"D - A nice beer but a touch hot."
"D - Fair. High ABV makes this hard to session obviously but I could have more than one for sure. Not the most complex Quad by any stretch of the imagination but a nice sipper."
"Funny that a beer named Rigor Mortis should be such a stiff drink. Rigor Mortis ABT doesn't quite compare to its Belgian counterparts but it does imitate them well. If you have any bottles in your possession I suggest you find them a cool, dark place and let them just be for a couple of years; my guess is they'll come back a much better beer, but doubtfully one that will ever be confused as belonging to Belgium's great Trappist monasteries."
"jd"
"D- A sipper for sure. Has a lot of initial kick in each sip and definite booziness. After each sip, booziness attacked my nose as I exhaled. I think I'm going to let my other couple bottles age for a bit to smooth them out and tone the alcohol down. Full of flavor, but pretty simple for a Quad. Was expecting a little better for a DDC creation, but they still did alright."
"Very nice version of a Belgian quad. Well done."
"D - It seems a bit hot/young right now, I'll have to put a few away, I feel like this could round out into something special with a bit of time. It's got a nice flavour profile and punch, it just seems like everything has had quite enough time to marry."
"A pleasant drop with good flavours, quality over quantity really. What's there is tasty but I kind of expect more from 10.5%"
"Rigor mortis is the stiffness that occurs in the muscles following death. Rigor Mortis ABT makes me glad that rigor mortis has not yet impaired my ability to enjoy expertly brewed beer. In my humble opinion, this offering is better than the much-heralded Peche Mortel and is Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel's finest creation."
"Bold on the sip, sweet taste with a bit of heat in the finish. Seems to be alot of sugar mixed in. It does taste like what they put on the botttle: extra strong abbey-style brown ale. Medium bodied for the mouthfeel. Overall another good beer from DDC. For the Rigor Mortis I probably would only have one as the 10.5% is decent on its own. Picked up a couple to put away and try every now and then."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Quadrupel."
"Finally the Control Board in Ontario brings in Rigor Mortis! Pours a ruby brown colour with big off-white head. Lacing surrounds the glass. Smells of dried fruit, Belgian yeast and some alcohol. Flavour is quite boozy, yet there is a lot of sweetness. Nice carbonation. I'm going to buy a whole bunch of bottles because I think this will age nicely."
"Decent enough, but I was underwhelmed after taking a sip. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good beer, but it feels like it's lacking for the style."
"Pours a moderately dark, nifty brown with a thin head. Nose brings a good amount of dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, and a bit of booze. The taste melds dark fruits with some dark rum characteristics. Feel is nice. Fairly heavy with a good amount of alcohol warmth. Drinks fairly well, but is not their best offering."
"Pours a very dark ruby-amber color with an off-white/tan head that isn't too large. Scent is very spicy with a bit of booziness. A lot of fruitiness comes through in the nose as well. Lots of plums and red grapes. The spiciness overcomes though. The taste is initially strong candied sugar and dark fruits. A bit of caramel and dark chocolate linger on the back of my palate as well. The booziness is very up-front and stays there in the aftertaste. Glad I bought another one to see how this beer ages and lets the alcohol settle. Mouthfeel full bodied and a bit syrupy, but at the same time, a bit more carbonated than other quads I've had. Drinkability is medium, and could be higher if wasn't so boozy. Quads are not my favorite style, but I found this one quite enjoyable."
"glad i tried this."
"This Belgian Dark Strong Ale favors the dark fruit and sugar sweetness. But the beer is beautifully crafted and delicious enough that the spicy/hoppy balance doesn't matter. A softer, more powdery malt character would allow it to compete with the Rochefort 10 and such."
"Too sweet and boozy for extended drinking, but enjoyable for the occasional pour."
"d- not great, this beer was a bit too strong for me, not my style."
"D: Definitely not one I will be purchasing again. Was too strong and not enough flavor."
"D - Just terrible. Total drain pour. DDC is so mediocre, I don't understand the hype."
"This has motivated me to explore the wide range of product available from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel and I recommend others give it try but I don't see it charging through the old tried and trusted offerings in this category."
"Inviting beer. Not too sweet or sugary with the Belgian yeast doing some of the work. Good no matter where it's brewed."
"The overall flavour here is good but not great. The sweetness is overpowering and the flavours don't quite integrate as well as the Belgian examples of this style."
"This is a very good beer and one of the best non-Belgian quads that I've tried. Tt doesn't seem fair to rate this one to style, but that's what I'm trying to do. On an absolute scale, these scores would all go up about a half point."
"This beer pours a cloudy light brown color with a medium head that hangs around for a while. The aroma is very sweet with some caramel and fruit notes. The flavor is much the same with caramel malts, some fruit, alcohol, and some spicy phenols - not terribly complex, but nice. The finish is fairly dry and the body is on the lighter end of medium. Drinkability is pretty good for the high level of alcohol, but I wasn't terribly impressed with this beer."
"D - All the aspects of this quad are good, but the alcohol is a little too strong for my liking. Ideally, the alcohol bite on the finish could be a little more hidden. It's a worthy offering, and worth a try to any fan of quads. Having only had a few different quads to date, this is the first that I've really noticed the alcohol, but the malty flavours were quite tasty nonetheless."
"Pours a murky, murky brown with an okay head that fades to a ring. In the nose there are nice Belgian yeast notes of banana, clove, coriander. A touch chalky and bready. The taste has very nice fruit and a bit of breadiness with a long finish that has a nice combination of bitterness, sweetness, and spice. Nice notes of banana, clove, pear, and spicebox. Sweet, bready, and thick in the mouth. Overall, pretty nice."
"D - Alc is pretty well hidden. Not really amazing for a quad, but a good brew. A bit more on the sweet side. Easy drinker, perhaps a good cross-over for a fan of brown ales looking to get more into quads???"
"This brew pours a reddish,copper,off brown hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a brown glazed head and a rim of lacing,the aromas are brown sugar,dark fruits,alcohol with big hints of some oak and wood characters,it has a nice rich creamy,sticky mouthfeel with tastes of brown sugar,oak,plums and some sticky date pudding aswell,overall its not a bad drop that is quite rich and true to the style but the one for tonight is enough for me,i could definately see this as a great brew to accompany a nice rich dessert cheers."
"D - the mix of aromas and flavours is fantastic, and while this is a quadrupel ale meant to be very strong, the alcohol content and bite do limit the drinkability, but none the less is a great brew"
"D: Intresting and quite good. DDC labels it as a abbey brown ale and I think it acomplishes that. It could use some time to mellow out though."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a solid quad, but with room for improvement. Overpriced, especially since I live on the same continent."
"Bottled on 04, 2010, so it is a bit young. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Clear dark brown with a quarter inch bubbly head which rapidly dissipates to a ring. Some fugitive lacing. Smells of malts and esters. Taste is very smooth. Malt flavours up front with a long alcohol finish. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good but the high alcohol will limit a session."
"Drinkability: As the label indicates: This one should be aged for six months for the perfect taste and I can see why. With that being said, The beer was not bad at all in it's early stage. I probably would only drink one of these in any given session, cellared or not."
"Again I am a bit disappointed by a Dieu Du Ciel beer. This is I am guessing about a year old bottle as encouraged by the brewer. Pours a strange looking brown/amber with a nice fluffy head. Nose is dark fruits, brown sugar, alcohol, and clove. Taste is a real blast of sweetness in kind of a fruit roll-up way, just over the top and, artificial? Something is off, although as it warms it is more pleasant. Alcohol well hidden in the taste and a nice dry finish. Strange beer."
"Drinkablity. Solid, but nothing that sits in your stomache"
"D: I like this a lot. Really no ethanol heat, great flavours, Belgian complexity. An outstanding quad for my palate. This was expensive as hell at Beachwood, Dieu du Ciel needs to get distributed down in the Southland with this and Peche Mortel it's game over."
"Nice creamy tan head over a mahogany elixir. Good lace as well. Nose has dark fruits, spicy yeast, peppery alcohol and candy malts. Taste is a nice balance of sweet bready malts, herbal yeast, cocoa and spices. Thick, creamy body is well carbonated. Nice Canadian Quad."
"D: It goes down easily enough, but I didn't get a ton of complexity from this one. I could certainly drink another, but I wouldn't be excited about it."
"This brew reminds me why i love a good quad so much. It's a great style and they nailed it. Quite a surpise considering it came with little fanfare. Quite the Quad and i think i'll have another!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink once it warms up and the alcohol is relatively well masked."
"Poured a clear brown color with an average creamy brown head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy earthy, yeasty and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration with a small alcohol burn. This is a good complex brew."
"Another ""hit"" from the folks at Dieu du Ciel. Not the spitting image of a Quad, but definitely taking some of the best aspects of that style and putting a new twist on it. Fine specimen."
"D: overall, a very respectable attempt at the Trappist style. This is really an enjoyable brew, and at a severely discounted price compared to the Belgian offerings. this is another great from Dieu Du Ciel!"
"Flavor is nice in this one, but the heat, the heat!"
"D - This brew reminded me of how much I love a good quadrupel. It's a great style and they've nailed it."
"You have a to love a beer with a name like Rigor Mortis with a picture of a corpse on the label. It pours a rose color, with about two fingers of white heading. The nose is very boozy, with traces of dark fruit, rose petals, and gum. Lots of juicy fruit comes through in the taste, along with some brown sugar. Overall though, the alcohol really overwhelms things here. It comes off as very syrupy/full bodied and sweet, without much balance to even things out. Not a bad drinker, but I would recommend sipping this beer, as it is heavy at times. I am not too sure when this was brewed, but the label says that it needs at least six months to age, so maybe that is exactly what is needed here."
"All 4's"
"For a beer this big it happens to be fairly drinkable. Im savouring each sip, and will be enjoying this for a while yet i imagine. A good example of the style, im wondering if i should have let this one age slightly longer. At any rate im glad to have tried this rich and tasty brew, and would gladly drink again."
"D - A big 'Abbey Brown' - more like a quad drinkability wise, but shares a lot with dubbel in the sense that it has plenty of creamy raisiny toasty, less roasty flavor. I was certainly happy to share this and could probably enjoy several with ease -another great beer from Brasserie Dieu du ciel"
"D - Great overall. Unsure if it is worth $8 for a single 12 oz bottle though."
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for $5.50. Ah, this is a well-made quad. It's nice to find North American Belgian ales that taste like they could come straight from a Belgian abbey. The aroma is a bit mellow with hint of prune and raisin, plus a hint of grape juice. Essentially it smells like a mixed bag of dried fruit. The flavor matches those esters but add caramel and toffee malt character that at times is both dry and juicy. There's a slight hint of alcohol, which is ok for the style since it's not distracting. The malt also brings toast and dark bread crust that allows this beer to border on desert, without being too sweet. Really, I think this is an under-rated quad and would be happy to enjoy it more often. The only real knock against it is the too-mild aroma."
"Notes: Hmmm, not something to look for explicitly from Dieu Du Ciel... It´s a decent quad but the sugar tones fall a bit short of being woven in the malty range, and that metallic-ish finish while not bad does not give it a particularly enticing profile."
"Really, really creepy label. Now, that aside, a really interesting beer, as well. Flavor profile was unlike any Belgian-inspired beer I've had. Not sure when my bottle was produced, but it certainly had the hallmarks of one that had been waiting for a while. Amazingly mellow for the whopping abv. Very low bitterness, with brown sugar sweetness and a touch of oaky vanilla. Mouthfeel had a unique creamy nature, almost as if lactose sugar had been used. Surprisingly drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Rigor Mortis ABT has a great mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy, but not overly thick. Medium carbonation. Overall a good, but not great quadrupel. It lacks the dessert-like spice that I have come to love in classic quads such as St. Bernardus. Due to the price tag, I won't be buying this again, but I would gladly drink it if offered to me."
"(D)- A very interesting quad that is really great with that chocolatey nut kick. Fits the style & has a few twists from the traditional. My only complaint is that $5.68 for this is a little steep just for 11.5 oz. Its good, but for the $, I would probably gravitate elsewhere for the style."
"ALl in all, this is not one of the better brews from them. They do have some good ones, so def don't put this on your list to hunt down. If you want to try something good from them try Aphrodite or Peche Mortel. Good to try once if you like hops."
"11.5 ounce bottle. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a brownish/red color with about a 1/4 inch tan head. However, the small head stayed around a while, and there was a decent amount of lacing, too. Aroma is dark fruit (raisins, figs), caramel malt, brown sugar and some apples. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some bananas, spice, cherries, and some nuts. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit coating, rich, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is decent enough, the 10.5% ABV isn't as strong in the taste as you think it would be, but you can feel it after a little while. I think this is a good brew, although I'm not sure I'd buy it too often at $5.49 a bottle. But if you've never had it before, I still think it's worth trying."
"This is a pretty nice beer, the biggest flaw is that the alcohol can be a bit too noticeable at times; it doesn't ruin the beer for me though. Interesting, this might be quite phenomenal if not for the hot alcohol; I wish I had bought a second bottle to age a bit longer."
"Opinion: Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in this beer overall. It has rode on my motorcycle for the last few hours, but I let it sit for at least 3 hours in the fridge before I drank it. I thought that it may come across as more yeasty as a result, but it is the alcohol that makes the beer out of balance."
"I like this a lot"
"I like the different boundaries that Dieu Du Ciel push,I wish I could get more of their wares.This poured into a small tulip glass a hazed russett color with some orange glow,a sticky one finger white head atop.A mix of dark fruit and phenolic spice in the nose,the alcohol creeps as it warms.Flavors are not overly complex but pack good flavor,dark fruit,and brown sugar flavors stand out most,again as it warms the alcohol really comes in.Its not overly complex but its pretty good,watch out the alcohol will hit ya."
"I like this one, but the one is enough for me. The carbonation and alcohol notes make it a little less of an easy sipper, but its still a fine beer in my eyes."
"This is a pretty good quad, but a slow sipper that gets a little cloying as it goes on."
"D. This is a very smooth and well balanced Quad. Very delicous. Not as complex as some. The alcohol is extremely well hidden, and makes this very drinkable."
"Feel and Drinkability: Carbonation is low and very fine as befits the style. Anything else and it'd totally blow this beer. Body is heavy and this beer is definitely one to sip on. Its not like other belgian styles that I've had. There isn't all that much sweet dark fruit and dark candy flavor or aroma here. An impression of smokiness and burnt or very darkly roasted grains...no maybe not that but heavily roasted barley and very much graininess. This is one that I'll sip on till its gone, but really, I don't think its worth the $5.50 I paid for it. I'm not saying to steer clear, but there is definitely better out there for quads. I've only had five hundred and change beers and I can tell you there are better quads out there. I guess its all about personal taste. This is not a ""traditional"" belgian quad. I think its very much different. I prefer the ""traditional"" to this. Not a big fan of that black patent or heavily roasted barley, esp when its mixed with a high alcohol brew such as this."
"Quite full bodied, but the carbonation is a bit weak, although of the right kind, with small soft bubbles."
"D--Another excellent brew by Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel. This is a favorite style of mine and I highly recommend this brew."
"I am a fan. I honestly think this is my favorite Belgian Quad to date. It just has a great pronounced chocolate-brown sugar flavor, which I like a lot. Very complex and very tasty. Seek this one out."
"Overall this beer this is another solid effort from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel. I very much enjoyed this Quad and found it not only easy to drink, but quite flavorful. Nothing earth-shattering, just a well-crafted beer. Recommended."
"T: The Quad is one of the most complex beer-styles and the masters of it are from Belgium (especially Trappist-monks). This is a nice try from another country. I will buy this one again, but I prefer the Belgian ones."
"I did enjoy Rigor Mortis and rate it highly in everything but drinkability."
"Pours a murky amber/brown with a very thin head and some below average lacing. The smell is of raisins belgian yeast brown sugar and a hint of booze. The flavor is similar in profile to the smell but not quite as hot, a very mellow malty belgian flavor with hints of dark dried fruits and spices. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin at first but it thickens some with warming, and its drinkable but not as much as other quads I have tried. This is the second beer from Brasserie I have been impressed with(the other being Peche Mortel) and I will have to keep my eyes open for more."
"A qualified quad: Good craft but nothing extraordinary."
"A sipper, no doubt, and with a not-too-thick mouthfeel over a pleasant flavor, it's a winner."
"This is a good, drinkable, beer. Unfortunately, the 9.5%abv, while not overpowering, is a little too noticeable. This is akin to a sweeter St. Bernardus abt 12, but the St. Bernardus has 10.5%abv, which is better masked."
"Drinkability: This one's definitely a quad - it's stylistically pretty spot on - and shows how you can make a really stylistically spot on beer that's just not terribly impressive. It's not bad, but it is decidedly mediocre. It helps that it's a little low on the abv% side - or, at least, you can't taste it that easily - but only so much really. Perhaps worth one try, but there are way better quads out there."
"M: Nice karbonated, smouth. A perfect cheese beer."
"Easy to drink and enjoy, I recommend this one."
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy grapish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice small islands, and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, lots of nice dark fruit notes, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of raisins, figs, grapes, plums. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty nice brew, glad to have had a chance to try it. Thanks Carl."
"Pours brown with crimson hints a little on the cloudy side with a full tan head. Aroma is sweet and malty with a definite alcoholic tinge and some background aromas of dark fruit. Taste is much like the aroma with a nice sweet malt base, but the alcohol is really dominant and of the hotter fusel variety often associated with a hot fermentation. Once past the alcohol you do get a little of the dark raisin and prune flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is full and slightly syrupy, but not to the overpoweringly cloying extent. This is a nice beer that could be a great beer if the fusels could be backed off."
"The body is medium-thick, a little chewy, a nice substantial base for such a substantial flavor. Definitely a sipper, my throat is burning a little, like I'm pounding a weak liqueur."
"An approachable quad, no doubt about that. Nothing intense or over the top, just a smooth operator all around, Sade would approve, this is worth getting your hands on if you get the chance."
"Pours cloudy, dark brown into the glass. Aroma is full of caramelized sugar with some dark sweet fruits. In general, it is sticky sweet and substantial. Taste is a little of a let down. Overall it is pleasant and similar to aroma, but alcohol is too evident. I am guessing that this is a young bottle, and the beer will improve greatly with some aging (the label mentions that the beer is at its best after at least six month aging). Body is meadium (I would've prefered something fuller). Mouthfeel is spoiled by alcohol. Cool label (that's always a plus in my book). This bottle was picked up at Half Time a week ago."
"Drinkability: high alcohol kocks this down a notch, but for a quad this was smooth and tasty but a slow sipper."
"Nice enough, but a bit challenging o drink because of the aggressiveness of the alcohol flavor."
"D: A drinkable version of a Belgian quad."
"Dark brown body with a disappointingly anemic head. Smell is typical quad dark fruitiness. The taste is incredibly mild. Chocolate, cherries, spices, and dark fruits are all there, but they don't jump out at you at all. You have to work for them. This is definitely the subtlest quad I've ever had. Worth a try if you're a fan of Belgians."
"Well constructed, tasty all the way - just needs some time or something to hide the alcohol burn better."
"D: Drinks decently for a quad."
"mouthfeel is thick and well carbonated, and the beer is easy to drink. a little less sweetness and alcohol would land this one a 5 for drinkability, but as it is, it remains very drinkable in its own right."
"Pours a dark brown colored body with a small creamy whitish head, somewhat lasting. Strong aroma of dark fruit, fig and plum. Some alcohol too. Creamy mouthfeel, some warmth. Dark fruit in the taste too. Some acidic bitterness. Some more sugary sweetness as it warms up. Some roasted flavors too, more as it warms."
"At volo on tap. Had a few samples of this- A deep hazed dirty brown with a nice structured eggshell cap. Nose is full on stewed fruits, lots of sugars, caramel, vanilla, spices. Tastes very sweet, of Belgian candy sugars, bubblegum, caramel, vanilla, floral spices, a bit oaky. Very good. Quite drinkable for the strength. A creamy and sweet and silky finish. Excellent example of this elusive style."
"This is a very good interpretation of a Belgian Quad. I'd definitely try to track this down again. Well balanced and very drinkable. Thanks to imagineii for sending me the bottle."
"Pours a murky chocolate brown color with a tight and creamy head that settles quickly into a chunky ring. The aroma is of red grapes and a light Belgian yeast spice. A bit underwhelming for a BSDA/Quad. The taste is of grape juice, some prune, a bit of spice and candi sugar. Nice but again, underwhelming. A moderate feel with a good amount of carbonation, on the sweet side but very subdued for the style. Crisp and refreshing. Drinks very nice, the abv is noticable but not over the top, balanced, good carbonation. You could get yourself in trouble drinking this one. The flavor profile is quite light for the style; the brew has some of the dark fruit flavors but not much malt. Good but falls short in the flavor department."
"Overall this was pretty damn solid, albeit a little hot still. With a year or two on it this would be damn near outstanding!"
"D: This is a smooth, easy-going quad; one that you could drink slowly for a little while"
"Drinkability: A very nice example of the style that is less sweet and cloying than many I have tasted from the old country"
"D - The aroma is very nice, but the flavor just doesn't live up to it (an unfortunate trend I have noticed with Dieu du Ciel). The rough alcohol and sweet malt make for an oddly cloying beer despite the dry finish. It may just need some age to bring things together, but it isn't all that great right now."
"Drinkability isn't very high here because of the alcohol."
"Surprisingly drinkable, I wish I had another one on hand."
"Overall Impression: Enjoyable. However, slightly off-balanced throughtout. It could have used more aging to smooth this beer out. Other note, I tasted no chocolate as indicated by the brewer's site."
"The taste is holy-cow-spice-and-caramel. In your face. Like a less boozy version of Rochefort 10 (which I'm not a huge fan of). Very interesting really, although not all that complex. The body is full but it just doesn't have that extra pep in the taste to put it over the edge. Overall, a solid quad that I probably won't bother visiting again."
"D: Fairly drinkable. I didn't notice any evolution after another one."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is rather hard to describe, it is a good beer, but while I can get St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the same price, which is a superior Quad, I can't see myself getting this one again"
"A pretty good belgian style quad."
"Well worth the 3.50$ pick it up."
"its a good quad if you are into extreme beer pick up a few of these bad boys"
"Pours a muddy reddish brown color with some fine sediment and a big fluffy tan head. Decent retention, not quite up to the Belgian standard. The aroma really shoots out of the glass, with rummy raisin at the fore and some accents of cinnamon, chocolate chip cookie, slight licorice, and a hint of peppery alcohol. Flavor is a bit of a letdown after the excellent aroma. It's just not quite as robust and well-rounded. Bready and yeasty without much sweetness, licorice and spicy alcohol in the finish. A little hot but not bad. The alcohol does sort of thin out the body a bit. Carbonation is pleasant, drinkability is decent. Good for a non-Belgian quad, but not even close to the authentic classics."
"Pours hazy medium brown with off-tan colored head that is quite thick at first, laces well, and retains a thin layer through the entire pint. Nose has soft baked good sweetness such as cookies or brownies, along with some yeast/bready components. Palate has a soft malty/roasty flavor that becomes a little nutty and brown sugary. Carbonation is gentle on the palate. Finish is somewhat long and flavored with soft baking spices."
"Pours a dark, semi-transparent mahogany with a fairly thick if not persistent beige head. Aroma is not strong but fruity and yeasty with malt underpinnings, rather inviting. Flavor is stronger than the aroma, malty and yeasty with a fruity and nutty hints and just a touch of spice. Texture is quite rough and fizzy, leaving a tart and nippy finish."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another one but later on that night I realized why this is caller rigor mortis. HA."
"The bottle says this beer is a abby-style brown ale, and I would say that is a great description though very high abv for a brown. This is a very complex and great tasting beer, I really enjoyed drinking it and will have to get it again."
"Drinkability- 10% is pretty big so more then one would be too many. Good Quad, if you can find it pick it up."
"Smooths out after 1/3 down. Drinking well for how ripe it is. Looking forward to cellaring a couple of these for years down the road."
"The aroma on this one was somewhat mild, but it increased a bit once it warmed considerably. Ultimately I got a mild, but pleasant spiciness from the aroma with some possible hints of alcohol. The flavor was much fuller. There's some sweetness upfront, then the spiciness kicks in, and there's a long, drawn-out combination finish. I'm definitely getting some Aventinus-like flavors which (for me) is a good thing. The phenolics in this brew are kept on the light side, and the spiciness is allowed to shine. This brew is somewhat sweet, but certainly not cloying. There's a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It was most-drinkable when it approached room termperature. The bottle did say it was best to age this beer, but I couldn't wait. Six months or so might do this beer some good. Whatever the case, I really enjoyed this beer which just recently showed up in Orlando (Knightly Spirits). I love a good Abby-style brew, but more often than not, I'm disappointed with what I find. However, I was happily impressed with this one. Nice job Dieu Du Ciel!"
"Overall, a good beer. Interesting for the style. Drinkable, but not too many at this ABV."
"D- This is definitely a slow sipper for sure due to the alcohol. Overall, a decent beer but not as good as some of the other good beers from this brewery."
"D: Not a huge fan, good, but a little thick.. don't think I need more than one at the moment, but I would get it again at a bar."
"D: As far as 'quads' go, I have come across better, but this one is a good effort, nonetheless. I'd look forward to eventually revisiting it, perhaps up against some others for comparison."
"AH, this really warmed me up, and its good and strong. I liked to see how the alcohol changes after aging, till then, Au revoir"
"D: Very good and I would definitely have this again though the alcoholic finish is a bit stronger than I would like."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Brown sugar nose. Flavor is brown sugar and molasses but it is well balanced. Nice brown (that's what the label says). Label has a 10.5% ABV. Pricey at $6.99 for a 11.5oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"A: Loads of thick cottony head that drops to leave patchy foam along the edges of the glass, the color of dark iced tea - 4.00, S: Surprisingly the aromas are relatively subdued, though an aggressive swirl brought out dark pitted fruit smells and a faint woodiness, alcohol is evident, faint rum soaked cherries, even fainter aromas of yeast - 3.75, T: For a 10.5% beer this is quite smooth with little to no burn but the alcohol does come to the front of the palate as the beer warms, strong flavors of dates and raisins, some phenols and medicinal tastes as well, burnt toffee, just borders on cloyingly sweet while being quite dry - 4.25, M: Medium bodied and smooth - 3.75, D: This is a great closer to a long evening, a little too high in alcohol to fit into a truly 'drinkable' category though it is very enjoyable - 3.50"
"I love this brewery. I love this style. But I only like this beer."
"Very glad to see the Dieu Du Ciel beers make their way to Denver. Pours dark brownish red with tan head. Smells sweet, caramelly, and dried dark fruitish. Taste includes the above, as well as candi sugar, yeast, and bread. Very good. My quad-loving wife is also enjoying some in her mini-City Beer Store glass. Body is pretty thick with medium carbonation."
"Quite the Quad."
"D: Good, but waaaay hotter than its' Belgian counterparts."
"Bottle. Pours a murky brown with a tiny white ring of head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, spices, and roasted nuts. Flavor of roasted nuts and a touch of roasted malt and sweet malt. Not boozy per se, just very warming. Nice abt/quad. It's roasted characteristics make it stand out from the traditional Belgians."
"I can't wait to sample some of the other Dieu De Ciel beers that I brought back with me."
"Pitch black and takes a hard pour to get 2 fingers of foam that drops ever so slowly. Rich dark fruit nose. Pungent raisins and prunes and red berries, sugary sweet grape candy. Sweet on the tongue as well with massive alcoholic complexity, concord grapes and boozy finish. Low-ish carbonation and light body. This is a big, big beer. Some port-like notes and a little bit of hops, just for balance. A sipper for sure. Frankly, very challenging to the palate and I think might be better with even less carbonation. Sweet, but not too sweet, and loaded with flavour."
"Drinkability is decent, it's a bit sweet and high in ABV but worth trying for those who like quads."
"Medium bodied with a nice medium level of carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel."
"Not bad, but not one of the breweries better offerings IMO. Worth a try if you like Quads though."
"Drinkability isn't too bad for a 10.5%er, but the campfire smokey taste really throws me off and gets a bit cloying. I wish I could access more of the dark fruity flavor that is up front. It doesn't help that the smell is good and the initial taste is good, because you get fairly excited only to be let down. I'd recommend skipping this one and trying their other offerings, which I think are a lot better. In case you're wondering, I had this on tap as well and felt about the same way as I did with this bottle."
"D- Easy to drink."
"D: Nice taste, fun to sip. I like it."
"Had this one as part of a late night session few days ago. Poured a cloudy brown with light beige head that left very little lacing. Smelled of fruity yeast and light malts. Tasted like fruity yeast (raisins, figs?), bread and malt. Smooth, but slightly overcarbonated, otherwise very easy to drink."
"Pours a Belgian style brown color with a decent sized white head that slowly disappears. Smells of dark fruits, sweet malts and a slight alcohol smell. Tastes of sweet plums and raisins followed by a spicy after taste of spices I cannot identify. Another reviewer mentioned that the ""sweetness is ""eaten up by the hops"" I could not find a better way to describe this flavor which does indeed balance out the sweetness of this beer. The flavor finishes with this flavor, and a slight alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is creamy and nicely carbonated. This beer is a sipper but it goes down easy. I could savor one of these for hours and could see myself drinking this again and again but I could not see myself drinking more than one of these in a night."
"Not drinkable. This beer really surprised me; I'm a HUGE fan of Dieu du Ciel and enjoy many of their beers. This one just doesn't live up to their standards, judging from the majority of their beers. Maybe I spoiled myself by trying Unibroue 17 last night for the first time; that beer completely blows this one away. Maybe I'd chug one or two of these to get a good buzz going...if they were free. I hate to sound like I'm trashing this beer; I'm really not. I'm hoping this is a bad bottle. This is really disappointing...Dieu du Ciel, what's up?"
"A good beer, however drinkability suffers from the high ABV that its you at the end."
"The foam was wheat in color, a little bibbly and dissapated quickly. The color was dark amber mahogany with a cola undertone. The smell was deep almost molassisy overtone, hints of chocolate and a hops undertone. The taste was exceptional - a rich molassis overtone with a choclatey highlight, hints of wood and maple and a rich spicey undertone and a little sharp like a barley wine. Mouthfeel - deep medium-bodied. Drinkability - a complex variety of tastes that danced in my mouth - wonderfull!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of cookie dough, with sweet Belgian malt and some light dry fruits. Taste is also dominated by some sweet Belgian malt, some candi sugar and some dry figs. Body is about average for the style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done but additional complexity and more dry fruits ester would have benefited this one."
"Rigor Mortis is pretty good beer. I like it, but don't love it. It's not competitive with the finest Quads out there, but it's a pretty good one. The nose could use more strength and alcohol is too prominent in flavor. Shore those two shortcomings up and you've got a really good Quad. Nonetheless, I've enjoyed the bottle and wouldn't mind picking up another at some point. It'd be interesting to see how it is with a little age on it. Grab a couple if you bump into it."
"Overall a very nice Quad that should age nicely."
"Pours a cloudy brownish copper color with some dark amber highlights into a chalice. Almost two fingers of foamy khaki colored head has good retention and leaves some lacing that falls back down onto the top. Smells of dark fruits, toffee, chocolate, Belgian candy, pepper, clove, and a touch of ripe bananas. Tastes of dark fruits like plums, grapes, cherries, and prunes followed by some chocolate, molasses, bread, spices, and candied sugar with a touch of earth, funk, and alcohol in the finish. Medium to medium-full in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth and really sweet. This is a great quad, easy to drink and great for the style. Perhaps it is a little too sweet, but overall it has a nice complexity and is enjoyable."
"Pours typical dark belgian style, dark brown, light tan, almost white head. Cool lacing left by intricate little bubbles up and down. Smells almost like medicinal alcohol at first, but that quickly fades way to sweet malt, a bit but not a ton of dark fruit. Flavour is equally balanced, not a ton of sweet dark fruit here, slightly sweet, little hop presence. The best part is in the mouthfeel, while it doesn't pack a ton of flavour, it still manages to be coating in mouthfeel, it just feels right. Carbonation is perfect. Drinkability is amazing. Not the most amazing quad out there, but still a great experience."
"Drinkability- Quite an interesting beer. Haven't had a bad, or even mediorce beer from this place. At $5.99 it was worth the experiment."
"Pours a clouded brown with a creme head. Nose is perfume and dough tones. Not overly complex, and slightly leaning towards one dimensional. Flavor is floral, dough, touches of fig fruits and slight sweetness. An alcohol burn is noticeably present. More so as time goes on and it warms. Feel is thick enough on liquid. Carbonation is middle of the road and about what I would hope to see. Overall not too shabby. The alcohol is a bit too much IMO, especially for a lower abv quad. But it definitely works for the style as many interpretations of quads have a difficult time doing so."
"Drinkability- This is not Dieu Du Ceil's best. But I will not disqualify everything from the brewery by a long shot."
"I'm highly impressed with this beer and think it is a great representation of the style, leaning heavily to the sweeter side of things. Big fan."
"Needs some aging but otherwise, an enjoyable example of the style that can only get better with a bit of age."
"Translation: This beer is bold and brash right now. I think it would do for some time to calm down all these aggressive fruits and booziness. But, to be honest, not sure if that will ever totally happen."
"12oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Poured the color of cola with a two inch frothy, off-white head. Head settles into a solid cap with thick bands of lacing. Nose is rather mild and difficult to describe - slightly vinous and malty with a hint of spice in the mix. Some booziness comes out up front, followed by the wine-like character revealed in the nose, dark fruit and spice. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied with a pleasant, consistent background carbonation. Nice abbey ale that changes its character as it warms."
"This beer poured a very dark murky dark amber almost black color and formed a light tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of malt, raisins, chocolate and Belgian yeasts. The flavor was of malt, chocolate, cocoa, coffee and bread yeast. The body was medium light and the finish was a touch sprite, yet sweet. A nice beer. but not sure what style to place it under."
"A sweet beer. Noticeably potent and very full bodied, almost as if an unfermented wort was blended in. Almost candy like in the taste. The swallow features a spritzy bitterness that fades quickly to the mouth numbing alcohol content, which is overpowering in the aftertaste."
"What an interesting beer. The nose sort of leaves something to be desired, but the tastes is like a Belgian Quad with the volume turned to 11. The meat taste just makes it ludicrously bizarre. I like it."
"On tap at Deep Ellum, Allston. Tonight's offering was a ""2007 vintage"". Served in a Belgian goblet. Very dark brown color to the body. No head or carbonation. Smell was quite a pleasing combination of dried cherries and caramelized sugar. There was also a distinct smell of barrel aging that I noticed. Taste was the highlight of the night. Strong but smooth. The smell led me to believe that his beer was going to be quite potent in flavor. But it turned out to be quite easy to drink. A nice example of a quad. Huge bursts of fruit flavor, with a sugary sweetness to balance the alcohol. I think the aging certainly helped mellow out this beer a bit and bring some of the core flavors to the forefront. Went great with a hearty plate of Belgian style sausages. Definitely would order one again."
"D: Not too much here. I mean, it is a very good brew, but the sweetness just kills it here. It's like chocolate, it's good, but after a bar, you ain't gonna get another one. But the first one is gonna go down like no other. So, one goes down easy, two is good, three is getting a bit too much. Alcohol is not a problem here since it is so well hidden."
"Pours a clear reddish orange, ruddy, huge and thick off white head forms, drops a ton of lace, great retention, settles to a solid layer. Smell is neat, quite sweet, caramel, apples and pears, bread, yeast, peppery spice, brown sugar, alcohol, light fruit, pretty big aroma. Taste is similar, sweet up front, honey and caramel, bit of fruit, yeast, pepper, bread, apple pie and cinnamon, alcohol comes through but isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth from the alcohol but altogether pretty smooth for the ABV. A nice quad, I could drink this stuff on a regular basis."
"drinkability is decent, but the sweetness detracts slightly from this. it's mostly balanced initially, then the sweetness begins to take over. still quite nice overall, just a little more of a sipper - which might be best with something at this ABV."
"The Rigor Mortis ABT was born in our Montreal brewpub in August 2001"""
"This is a pretty big quad, and I don't think it drinks too well young. It wears its alcohol and sugar content proudly, but comes off as too boozy and sweet for a style that is typically boozy and sweet. This is really too bad, because the peripherals (appearance, aroma, mouthfeel) are all great. I'd only try this again if it was aged."
"Overall, it packs a punch and with the sweetness and alcohol feel, I see this one appealing to those who like port. I enjoyed it but I was also glad I didn't have more than a half-pint."
"At the brewpub, a cross between a Belgium and an old ale. Very cloudy amber with great lacing, yeasty aroma, Full mouthfeel. Very drinkable and tasty. The clear winner here tonight Some chocolate malt. Some smoke. Had again three years later although not as good."
"Had this beer on tap at the Dieu de Ciel brewpub. Only available in 750ml bottles, not available for takeaway as of yet. This beer will whoop your ass! Very strong, raisiny, with rummy plum undertones, two finger head upon pourth. I loved this beer, but could only drink half of the bottle due to the strong abv that is very present. Highly Recommended. Chris"
"A dark brown color with ruby high lights. Taste reminds me of anise, chocolate, plum juice, some chilly porto. On the nose, it smells like funky grapes and roasted bread with notes of cola. Vinious, warming alcohol present. Very enjoyable. Easily drinkable. A must-try."
"Pours very dark brown, almost opaque with a short medium creamy head, good lacing. Nose consists of a strong alcohol astringent smell along with a myriad of fruits (berries, perhaps grapes and something else?). Some may also akin the smell to 'hamster piss' because of its overwhelming alcoholness. Taste is very strong with some heavy malts, mixed fruits, caramel, and again the intense alcohol. I realized it's a rather high-octane brew, but I like high-octane without the super astringency (like Trois Pistoles, for example). Mouthfeel was good for the brew's strength. This would not be a choice again if I was in the mood for a high-octane malty beer."
"One year old bottle, split three-ways with BA friends. Murky bronze/brown with a nice tannish head that did not quit. Aroma was out of this world. Sweet/dark fruits, alcohol, lovely malts, herbal hops, yeast, candy, dark port wine, and more! I also picked up hints of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. The taste was more of the same. Fruity up front with some nice malts in the middle and the herbal hops in the finish. The chocolate and coffee flavors were hidden within this beer as well. The mouthfeel was very thick and filling, but just right for an ABT, and the drinkability was also awesome for an ABT. A great Belgian-style beer and a truly wonderful example of the brewers art at work. Quite possibly one of Dieu Du Ciels best beers!"
"One year old bottle: Cloudy pale bronze coloured. Malty nose with notes of dark fruits, plums, original pomegranate. Good mouthfeel, warming. Very malty in mouth, almost vinous, but not quite sticky, roasted caramel, chocolate. I enjoyed the finish, but it was perhaps a little unbalanced on the sweet side. Strongly recommended, could be one of Dieu Du Ciel's best."
