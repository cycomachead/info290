"As it warms, it gets a bit sweeter, but the alcohol still doesn't seem to pile up. Still, a rich, flavorful sipper, another big Struise hit."
"This is a masterpiece! I'm truly in love. I bought 5 bottles but now I just GOT to get hold of a couple more..."
"the bourbon taste and smell was very pronounced. the alcohol taste/smell was so overwhelming it tasted like tequila"

"Aroma of raisins, honey, faint vinous, caramel, candy, spice. Taste cooked sugar, wood, faint vanilla, figs, dry finish. Excellent!"

"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty brown color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry fruits with some bourbon notes and some residual sugars is quite complex. Taste is a complex mix of bourbon with light residual candi sugar with some, fruity ester and some dry fruits notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Nice level of complexity thought a fuller body would have help appreciate this even more."

"2009 edition - poured a muddy red-brown body (like dark brown leather couch brown) with two finger head that dies quick with little lace. There is some booze and vanilla in this beer and it a touch of sourness to along with some sweet malts - pretty complex aroma that I can't really nail down. Beer is medium-bodied, a little sticky, the booze is hidden but after awhile hits you as beer warms, some typical Belgian yeast and citric zip come in as well and there is some moderate sweetness with a blend of sour that I get. A really enjoyable quad that the aging has smoothed out and sweetned and is a great sipper (this is not meant to be more than a sipper)."

"Picked this up at Bierhandel Willems en zoon in Belgium. Beautiful clear mahogany pour with a two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is amazing with huge vanilla, bourbon, and oak notes along with hints of butterscotch, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, and subtle dark fruit. The taste mirrors the nose with the oak, vanilla, and bourbon once again the stars. Hints of maple, caramel, pecans, leather, tangerine, figs, apple,brown sugar, and booze. The mouthfeel is lightly syrupy with perfect carbonation and a smooth as silk, subtly warming finish. Overall, this is an amazing beer! It's rich and flavorful and hugely drinkable for an 11% ABV beer. I've had this numerous times on tap, but this is the first time from the bottle. I have to say it's just as good, and perhaps has mellowed a bit in the cellar. For me, this is a Barley Wine disguised as a Quad. Highly recommended!"

"O: A really nice beer. The age, and perhaps the barrels, have made this delightfully balanced. Complex and not particularly boozy, though quite sweet, as most quads are."
""
""
"Overall- Good beer. Way different take on the Quad. Worth a try especially if you don't really like Quads but like Tripels."

"Doesn't feel four years old but the age is noticed and probably why everything has balanced out so nicely. Like the mix of the Bourbon and wine feel."

"O: This is easily one of the best beers I've tried this year, and is perhaps one of the best quadrupels I've ever had. The flavors are gorgeously balanced and the alcohol is not so overpowering that it is difficult to drink. The guys at De Struise have really created something marvelous here. Highly recommended to fans of Belgian ales and strong ales in general."

"Interesting mix of sweet, sharp, savory, and bitter. A little hot, but fairly complex. Somewhat sweet, overall."
"A big, boozy heavy hitter. Go slowly with this."

"Overall - Least impressive of Struise quads. Wanted this to be much more."
"O - An unusual quad this one, I still think there are many better examples out there, but try it for something different."

"O: A unique quad with the heavy EtOH character, but it was never hot, and it was an interesting beer to try. Though if you want this at its peak, I'd say give it another 5 years."

"This is great. Hectic in the best possible way."

"3.5 D: Very interesting beer that is worth a try. I doubt I'd buy another bottle if I had the chance though, but I'm glad I got this one. The bourbon is a bit at odds with the fruity notes, but at least it's a unique experience."
"The unusual take to turn the dark Belgian ale blonde leaves the beer tasting much like classic Belgian dubbel ales, but with the power and complexity of quadrupel ales. The results remind me of Founders Nemesis '09, except with far superior results."

"What stays is the smell of the beer and it's darkyellow colour. Very nice mouthfeel. The beer has to warm up a little but then it shows it's quality. Next time i have to get me a fresh(er) glass!"
""
"O: Surprising, tasty, heavy and refreshing, all in one beer. The usual wonderful balance from Struise. We've got a winner ;-)"
