Flavors are strong but never overpowering. Nice smell, not too sweet, sits nice in the mouth, smooth head, smooth finish.  You will never know this is 10% ABV.  Nice start to my birthday.","hotpauko","Mar 31, 2015"

The flavor follows the smell; and it is incredibly rich and deep. The sugar is present, but this doesn't come across as all that sweet. A gentle blanket of warmth and a strong, fruity presence make sure this stays balanced. The body is full and lush with creamy quality that coats the mouth.

My bottle was new according to the printed date, and my glass  was cleaned to the standards I have been taught, but I only observed about a finger of cream colored head that receded within a minute into a foamy sheet that clings to the glass. (I say this out of surprise after what I have read, but whatever, this is my review.) Smell was hinting of dates but overpowered by the banana pudding that was much more pronounced than I expected, and a finish of alcohol. Taste was hinting of dates, spice, and dark chocolate, but was again dominated with banana pudding. Had a a somewhat pronounced but not unwelcome or overpowering bitterness going down and a very slight earthiness in the aftertaste.  The alcohol is definitely deceptive, and did not make its presence easily known, especially for a beer with such a high ABV. It was velvety smooth from the moment of sip to swallow, with only a slight hint of carbonation on the tongue. Overall a very enjoyable experience that makes me wonder if my senses are more sensitive to banana pudding than the average person. I find that I don't have as much experience with quads as I would like, and as a result I may update my review score later.","AngEo","Nov 16, 2014"

Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, light caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, light caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, molasses, herbal, light caramel, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is insane. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming after the finish. Overall this is a world class quadrupel. All around incredible complexity and balance of bright fruity/spicy yeast esters and balanced malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the ABV.

Head eventually dissipates into a algae-like slick with swaths and spots of lacing coating the edges of the glass. Nose expresses notes of bubblegum, a sweet vinous quality and a suggestion of something else; perhaps honey. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of a candied quality and just a trace of hops that is a bit muddled, but slightly evident at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, even carbonation that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the throat between quaffs. There's also the slightest oiliness to the texture. Overall, a decent Quad, but a bit too sweet. Not sure how well this will hold up in the cellar - I get the slightest sense of a metallic quality which I don't think will bode well for extended cellaring.","Jwale73","Mar 16, 2014"

Taste is nice and sweet likely from the Belgian candy sugar. You can taste some of the nice banana yeast in the background but it's not as upfront as in some Belgian type beer. I realize this is not a Belgian but it tastes just like one and is very good at hiding the high ABV of the beer. Mouthfeel is quite thick and great for the style.

Flavor is sweet, well integrated fruit, dominated by plums, light hints of stone fruit, dried dark fruit and cherry, sweet malt.

Aromatic notes of toasted bread, raisin, and fig with delicate pepper and only a hint of alcohol. The flavour starts of with toasted malt, joined by dried fruit and hints of brown sugar and peppery phenols mid-palate. Finishes dry and with a light medicinal note that adds complexity. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. The carbonation is fine and soft, giving the beer a somewhat soft and smooth mouthfeel. Good beer. I feel that this would be a fine meal-time drinker. I could see this pairing well with a red meat stew, like beef or venison, or with a good steak. This would also make a great accompaniment to a cheese board. It has enough flavour that it should hold up to the food, but not so much that it might outshine it.","mintjellie","Sep 27, 2012"

I smell some cherry and Belgian yeast mostly, with light spices. The taste is quite simply amazing. It’s perfectly balanced with a sweet malt character up front and bitter hops in the finish. In between its a great ride of spice and fruit. Mouthfeel, a 5. I don’t normally do that but it actually is perfect. So incredibly creamy with a nice dry finish.

A little lighter in appearance in I would think for a Quad, but still a nice looking brew. The nose has blackberry, yeast, alcohol, caramel malt, slight hops, and other berries to it. A little on the weak side, but very nicely put together. It definitely improves w/ warming though, so I've knocked it up a notch. Taste is very similar to the nose profile, and you definitely get a nice alcohol burn on this one- almost too much so. Carbonated/alcohol burn/malty feel on this beer. I imagine this would age extremely well and really smooth out. It's a little too hot right now. Overall, this is a solid Quad Trappist Ale, and definitely worth getting if you enjoy the style...

Alcohol is a hot hammer on the throat. More of a liqueur than a beer, but reasonably amount of hops. Hugely fruity with raisins, toasted fruit cake, and dried figs. Nice nose of roasted barley. Sweetness seems overpowering at first, but the vast range of the Belgian complexity gives it a lot of interest.

You get alot of sweet, fruit infused bread, a ton of yeast, plums, and candied sugar. It's definitely the sweetest quad I've had yet. I just can't get behind the flavors.

It drinks medium to full in body and is a smooth drink with no alcohol left behind in the aftertaste. Perhaps I'm being picky, but I can't get behind this beer. It doesn't come anywhere near anything by St. Bernardus and it's in the same price range. I wouldn't necessarily want to try this one again.","aasher","0"

Smell is complex with hints of alcohol - fruity and nutty. A wonderful, rich taste which reveals different flavors in time. Dark fruit, rich malt, a hint of chocolate, and an ever lingering flavor of raspberries...chocolate covered raspberries! The mouthfeel is excellent - the velvety texture coats the mouth and remains for quite some time. An excellent beer and more motivation for me to seek out more Quads to try.","jimbus","May 17, 2011"

A bit fizzy and a smooth finish. This is La Trappe’s best commonly available beer and a world class quad.

It's got a light muddy brown color with a thick tan head on top that stick around for the majority of the time. The smell of this beer sucks me in every time. The aromas that come off of this brew are sweet fruits and some nice malts with just a bit of yeast in there. It nearly smells like candy to me. The taste is lovely, all those fruits and the yeast come alive once it hits your tongue. It tastes pretty much exactly how it smells.

Tasted like you would expect a Quad to taste. You can tell there is alcohol in it. IMO the alcohol is more noticeable in this beer than a Rochefort 10 but like the Rochefort it is so drinkable it isn't even funny. Great beer for socializing. Horrible beer for sucking down like water just to get drunk as quickly as possible. Way too good of a beer to waste like that.","jthor018","Aug 01, 2010"

The aroma is relatively complex -- other elements are noticeably present but difficult to distinguish -- and culminates in a sort of earthy, fresh smell of the outdoors. Flavor comes in three stages: initially a strong maple character, then a wave of fig and dark fruit that crescendos to a strongly alcoholic, malty finish -- a flavor that is sweetly balanced and symphonically complex. Very strong with a light-to-medium body. A distinctly earthly character that resonates with the sound of silence.","Shakesbeere","Beers"

The rootbeer and cola aroma is much more pronounced, though there's some orange peel and light chocolate in the background as well. On the palate, this beer is quite sweet, but the flavor profile otherwise is just stunning. There is just an incredible melange of rootbeer, caramel, vanilla, maraschino cherry and light chocolate. Absolutely, this is beer dessert for those who don't like dessert. Mouthfeel is rich, soft, full and long.... just delicious.

3.85,-7.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but trying the Dubbel, Tripel and Quad together, I'm highly confused about the Quad's significantly higher ratings. True, it's a bit better. The flavor is fuller, the malt is richer and the beer is a bit more warming, but the flavor profile is in line with the rest of the lineup with the smaller beers. I'm even lowering the rating a bit in deference to style comparisons. On a flat rating scale, this would be more highly rated than the Tripel or the Dubbel. At any rate, the Quad pours a deep medium red. It's translucent with amber highlight at certain angles. It's actually less murky than the Tripel (maybe a function of the pour). There's a bit more lacing, though. The aroma has more banana bread and clove than I noticed in the previous Koningshoeven beers. There are also aromas of vanilla, brandy and apricots/plums. The flavor is similar with peppery spicing. I'm again impressed at the depth of flavor these Trappist brewers are able to get out of such simple ingredients. It's one hell of a strain of a yeast that can impart this depth of flavor. If not for style comparisons, I'd bump up my ratings in every category.","popery","Aug 02, 2009"

The taste is really nothing but sugar and alcohol as well. The alcohol blends in a bit better in the taste, but not much. A slight hint of citrus fruits can be sensed in the taste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the carbonation is about right. Compared to the St. Bernardus and Westvleteren, this is much less drinkable.

Taste was nuts, cherries, caramel and apple, very port-like and sweet, with substantial, yet inoffensive, alcohol warmth. This is the first quad I have ever had. It was very robust and flavorful, was very wine-like, went very well with our lemon-glazed roasted chicken and saffron rice dinner.

Anywho, pours a hazy light chocolate brown color with a small and tight beige colored head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is fruity, with red wine like characteristics with a musty malt and candi sugar notes. Big bold musty flavor, red wine mixes with the dark candi sugar resulting in a strong raisin flavor, some fig and honey, rust, and just a barely there chocolate malt. La Trappe really brings out the musty flavors in their brews, much more so than the other trappist breweries. The brew sits well on the palate with fizzy carbonation, fairly crisp, sweet throughout.

The smell is malty sweet, green apple and spicey phenols are present. The taste is similar - spicy, malty sweet and a slight alcohol bite when you swallow. The mouthfeel is fairly light with a foamy carbonation and a dry finish. Given that this beer has 10% ABV, it is very drinkable. Although the alcohol is perceivable, it by no means dominates the palate making this a smooth drinker. I think I prefer their tripel though.","gmfessen","Feb 24, 2008"

The sweetness has a tinge of plastic-ness to it at higher temperatures, just when a quadrupel should be throwing off some really present flavors. Acidic tartness comes out first, then sweetness at the mid-palate, with no drying out toward the finish -- things stay sticky. Overall, this is a good quadrupel, but not, in my opinion, a great one.

Theres a hint of smokey, roasted and dark malts, even though this is pretty light in complexion. Plum and pear make their way up to the nose as I drink, with lighter hints of vanilla and cherry. Light hints of raisin, fig, and prune. Smooth and easy drinking, and while not as thick as other Trappist Quads, it isnt thin, either, and exhibits a richness quite unique to itself. Spicy, slightly tingly aftertaste with more roasted malts hanging on for the ride home. Very minimal bitterness, in the range of a Doppelbock, and seemingly no hop presence.

Deeper and sweeter than the aroma, the fruit bursts through and then notes of chocolate and a dusty, tart finish. The aftertaste brings the sweetness back, like bing cherries and the warmth of alcohol and a hint of brandy. The mouthfeel is full and oily, with a chewy finish. The tartness at the end of the flavor seems a bit at odd with the smoothness of the mouthfeel, but I'm nitpicking at this point. The drinkability is dangerously good.

The sugar is what really dominates the smell. Same for the taste. It almost tastes like malty cotton candy. Unfortunately the sweetness obfuscates other flavors. There is some fruit and malt, but the fruit tastes like candy that is artificially flavored, rather than an identifiable fruit. Aside from the sweetness, it is pleasant to drink, but I doubt that I could drink more than two without vomiting. Its just too damn sweet.","JulieRFoster","Mar 27, 2006"

Really malty taste, but not as much cherry and vanilla that was indicated by the aroma. There was a moderate a level of alcohol in the finish.

The aroma was what youd expect from a quad but with suble undertones often missing from lesser examples of the style. Citrus and yeast, sour fruits, spices and bread. The taste is spice and sweet hops, cloves, sour fruits, alcohol and sugars. It was balanced as well as any quad I've ever had. The mouthfeel was somewhat astringent with its acidicty, but excellent for sipping, even with its carbonation. I loved this beer and it has now risen to my favorite example of the style.

This left cobwebs of lace along the sides of my tulip glass. Smells predominantly (disappointingly so) of alcohol with some red wine, green grapes, oak and an underlying sweet bread dough. The flavor consists of a wonderful concoction of musky fruits to include prunes, sour strawberries, cherries and some mild oranges (and then some pears as it warmed). These are all tied together with a smooth, yet dry, oak and doughy yeast that reminds me of pizza dough. Also, theres a subtle spiciness brought on by the yeast and the alcohol. The fruity sweetness in this beer is wonderfully contained by this dryness. Finishes with some lingering dark fruits and an amplified version of the smooth spicy yeast. Theres also a good deal of gentle warming. The mouth feel feels initially light, but is a bit sluggish moving around in my mouth with big explosive bubbles that feel electric across the roof of my mouth. This is a really top notch brew with a fantastic balance of flavors that is terrifically enjoyable to drink.

This becomes more refined with each sip until a balance occurs where the beer smoothes out in contrast to its alcoholic largeness.

It's bottleconditioned but somehow only once in a while you'll have some yeast on the bottom of you bottle.

A rather medicinal flavor that brings me back to my days of my youth when my mother would pour cold medicine down my throat. Slight hints of raisins--bt the type that have been sugar-coated.

Taste was somewhat sweet, malty, a bit of Riesling white wine character, dark fruits and of course alcohol. Alcohol was prominent, but not overbearing. Rich mouthfeel as it warmed.

Rich apple and vinous flavour throughout with plenty of malty and fruity sweetness. Quite mellow with a pleasant alcohol warmth at the finish.

Decent lacing. Smell has a lightly fruit flavor (apples and peaches) with a bouquet of hops. Taste however is much darker in fruity flavor. Red grape skins and plums. Sweet malts mix in. Caramel and chocolate. A huge nutty flavor rides the raspberry/maple syrup body. Finish is dry and wine-like. It lingers in a soft way. I don't really notice the alcohol but feel it the further I go. Hops are weak in body and hardly noticeable. The malt complexity and depth of this beer are amazing. I kept finding new flavors.

Taste has a nice medley of dark fruits noted in the smell and a malty smooth sweetness with nice yeasty underlaying notes of clove and bits of medicinal plastic. Overall very soild in its length of malts, dashing with dark fruits and trailing with caramel, lighter toffee, and slight mild spice in the finish. The alcohol hardly makes any appearance but there is some warmth sneaking in. Feel is nice and smooth, lightly chewy and creamy with a lighter side of the heavy or full but yet, not medium either. Quite a nice feel, fits well with the malts and yeast.

The aroma is full and complex - cherry, malt, sugar, alcohol. The mouth is heavy and lightly carbonated. The tongue is quickly overwhelmed by the variety and complexity of flavors - fruits, malts, alcohol, caramel. This old hophead was surprised to find some hoppy bitterness coming through in the finish, nicely balancing the sweet and sour of the fruit. The aftertaste brings the malt back to vie for the fruit.

4.22,1.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy dark bronze in hue, topped by a thick, creamy, well retained ivory white head. Tart citrus and green apple along with mild clove hit the nose at first, then mellow to allow medium caramel and biscuit notes to surface. As the beer breathes, the phenols and esters dissipate, allowing caramel malt and toffee notes to become progressively more pronounced. Hint of jackfruit emerges late in aroma. Sweetness upfront in flavor is molasses like, then is complemented by a bread and butter like biscuit / caramel malt combination. Fruitiness is relatively bright in nature for style, w/ notes of ripe citrus overshadowing underlying darkish hints of dates and prunes. Like other La Trappes, other fermentation byproducts are mild, with only mild clove and trace banana esters present as an undertone. Meager in hop bitterness and thus sweet, but not cloyingly so, overall in character. Moderate in body, with a smooth, firm mouthfeel once the initially high carbonation subsides. Finishes bready and caramelly sweet. Quadrupel is a unique brew. Its flavor kept morphing as I tasted it. At first, it was slightly acidic, prickly and green, then fruitiness tamed into a ripely citric nature; malt character then became progressively more pronounced, thus lending eventual richness in overall profile. Although La Trappe Quadrupel doesn't possess the depth of character as some top examples of style, it is nonetheless a very tasty brew. Drink this one above cellar temp, and let the initially high CO2 levels dissipate. This 750 ml bottle was far superior to the 11.2 oz I previously tasted.","marc77","Nov 09, 2002"

Alcohol is the first thing to hit the nose, embedded in a deep malty aroma with slightly tart and acidic fruit notes. The beer itself is dark and dubbel like, a hazy medium-brown with a thin tannish head. The flavor too is rich and malty, with prune-like and bready flavors throughout. Alcohol is very unobtrusive, and hops are downplayed, just enough for a well-balanced finish. Relatively high level of carbonation gives this a medium to medium-light impression in the mouth.

It poured a slightly cloudy reddish-brown with a sticky tan head that did not retain particularly well.  There was a small amount of lace down the side of the goblet that I used.  The nose was very yeasty and the palate very sweet and fruity, almost candy-like with absolutely no balancing hops bitterness.  Apples?  Prunes?  The mouthfeel was very syrupy and complemented the sweetness.  Effervescence was on the low side of moderate.  Overall, a decent dessert beer, but not a beer that I would drink on a regular basis.  10% abv.","BKotch","0"
