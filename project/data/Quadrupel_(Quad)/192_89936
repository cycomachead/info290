The head sticks around for a long time, and there's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells mostly like cherries and dates (really just a lot of dark fruit in general), along with pears, cloves, and some tobacco. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit (cherries, dates, plums), dark bread, caramel, candy sugar, pears, and peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I liked it. $6.99 a bottle, definitely worth trying at that price.","bluejacket74","Aug 09, 2013"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, bottled in 2/2013. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, banana, toast, chocolate, dark candi sugar, brown bread, clove, herbal, leather, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity esters with dark malt notes; and good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, pear, apple, fig, toast, chocolate, brown bread, leather, banana, dark candi sugar, herbal, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, toast, chocolate, banana, brown bread, leather, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity ester and dark bready malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Quadrupel style. Nice balance and complexity of fruity esters with dark bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. This improved a lot as it reached room temperature. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 24, 2013"

3.98,9,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a 3 Monts tulip glass. Pours a medium red amber with a fine two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. Fruit forward aroma of stone fruit and cherry, caramel malt. Flavor begins with rich estery fruit; cherry, apple and light stone fruit and then dries out abruptly and finishes very light and dry with a slightly astringent bitterness. Medium bodied with spicy carbonation in the finish. An interesting and odd take on the quadrupel style. The coffee cherries really do add a pleasant cherry flavor. I would have liked a bit more presence from the dates, which would have given a bit more body to support the sweet fruit flavors. Not a traditional quadrupel, but delivers the coffee cherry experience nicely. Warming and a bit alcohol forward.","LiquidAmber","Jul 11, 2013"

This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, it was boozy and the flavor couldn't hold my attention, I think it would be hard for me to drink the whole bottle, I'm glad i'm sharing it, half a bottle is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, i thought this beer looked pretty good and it looked pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, it was pretty off, the flavors that shouldn't stick out the most did and that made for a pretty harsh quad that wasn't very drinkable. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it might get better with age, but I'm not willing to risk it and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, I don't think it's a good example of the style. All in all i was let down with this beer, it wasn't what I was expecting, I had high hopes after trying their Tripel that was released with this beer, but this turned out to be a let down. Better luck next guys, this one needs some work. So far this is my least favorite beer that I've tried from the Lips Of Faith series.","StoutHunter","May 15, 2013"

The nose even fulfills the description and expounds on it nicely, really playing to the beer style's usual characteristics nicely but it falls flat in flavor and feel, abandoning the unique and compartmentalized, though harmonious, characteristics for a flavor that's just the opposite; muddled and underwhelming following the aroma. Cascara is by no means a bad beer though, and New Belgium's continued innovation is admirable. Plus, if you're looking for a beer with kick, this one provides it with subtlety.","BeerFMAndy","Mar 17, 2013"

Near features heavy wave of Belgiany esters up front with notes of banana, clove , and bubble gum. Next comes a bit of bright and sweet cherry notes. This is my first foray into a concoction with coffee cherries. The taste is all Belgian quad up front with notes of candi sugar, banana, and grapes. The coffee cherry comes through next and provides a sweet fruity characteristic that has almost a chocolatey finish. Mouthfeel is light with mellow carbonation. Overall, a very sweet quad without a whole lot of depth and complexity.

I felt that the beer might be interesting to age, but that its current state is sub-par, and aging should not be used as a crutch. Belgian beer fans probably wouldn't enjoy this as much as drinkers who want to taste it for its unique ingredients (date sugar and coffee cherries). I would recommend it to those who want to try something different, and don't mind the taste of high-alcohol. For everyone else, I would recommend staying away.","teromous","Mar 07, 2013"

The nose comprises medicinal cherry dust (which also kinda borders on plum at times...), Belgian candi sugar, light clove, banana, perfume-y flowers, and a smattering of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of coffee in the background and some lightly-toasted biscuit throughout. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, I don't feel the cascara really works all that well here, as it seemed to go sideways.

Taste is packed with the dark fruits as well. There is a nice alcohol warmth to it, as it is a bit boozy right now. Very tasty date and fig flavors come through, along with red grapes and black cherries. The coffee in this beer is VERY subtle. More booze in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I think a bit of age may do this beer well.
