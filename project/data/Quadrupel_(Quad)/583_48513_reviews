"Ok, but not awesome.  Others are better"

""
""
"While it offered the complex flavors of a Quad with plum and toffee, the lack of carbonation and burdensome mouth feel made it unpalatable.  I would have rated it more harshly, but as noted it lacked sufficient carbonation and I fear I may have gotten a ""bad bottle"""

"Figs, deeply caramelized malt, raisins, and vinous notes form the aroma. Toasted caramel, sweet, nutty malt, buttery toffee serve as the backbone, with raisins, lightly tart cherries, and booze rounding out the flavor profile. Surprised by the toffee, buttery character."

"Overall, a very well made and balance Quad. Never had a beer from this brewery before, but would definitely try anything else they make after giving this one a shot."

"O: A very solid quad. Glad I grabbed another bottle to take home."

"O: Nice overall but I think it would be better if there were a bit more spice and a bit less sweetness"

"Overall: Pretty solid quad from these Missouri guys. All their beers have been stellar so far, but increasingly harder to find here in Massachusetts. I need to stock up."

"O: after shaking out some of the carb this beer is very solid. not the greatest but far from the worst. the finish is fantastic but I fear that after drinking more of it that it might become cloyingly sweet. A very impressive beer with good flavors and solid complexity."

"This reminds me of a beer I had a couple of years ago at the Milwaukee Ale house called Devil’s Advocate they had on cask that I really enjoyed. I like this a lot and by the way, Happy New Year."

"Consumed from a small snifter."

"This beer poured out as a brownish orange color, it has a white head on top. Seems to have a good looking retention, the lacing is very minimal. The aroma is loaded with raisin aromas, sweet malts and bready yeast. The taste of this beer is sweet, with some bitterness in there... There is a touch of funk in there too. The mouthfeel is decent, it's heavy with a moderate carbonation. Overall the taste is not as good as I had hoped. Not the best tasting Quad out there. It was ok, but wouldn't b something I would need to drink again."
""
"O: One damn fine beer. Quad's are rignt in my wheelhouse and this one stands up to the best that I have tried. It's flavors are bold, but balanced. And at 12%, its a sipper that can be savored. Keeps you wanting another sip. Get some for the winter."
""
""
"The alcoholic finish is dominant and dwarfs the finish, otherwise the beer is quite excellent."
""
"O: Although this beer masks its alcohol well considering its strength, it lacks the complexity of dark fruit flavors and sweetness compared to other beers in the style. It can also seem a little cloying at times and isn’t one of the easiest beers to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great depth of flavor, but there is an awful lot going on. Finishing the bottle will be a bit of a challenge, just because of the overwhelming sweetness and barrage of flavors."

"Pours a brownish body w/ minimal head that died quick, on top of a thick malty aroma comprised mostly of yeast, candi sugar/caramel sweet malts (touch of chocolate?), roasted malts as well as a touch of citirc hops. A rich, thick malty base of breadiness gives off a full body of balance. Getting sweetness from caramel and something like chocolate, but not as intense, as well as a dry edge from some roasted malts (IDK why I'm picking them up in this beer). A little bit of hop and peppery zip as well as a tinge of sharpness in the finish, catching me offguard due to very high ABV (which only slightly bleeds into beer). A good quad to sip on (literally) and perhaps my only knock is that is a little simplistic and the malts are the dominant force somewhat squashing the fruits, overtaking blance, and turning a potentially great quad into just really good."
"O- Good Quad, this is the 2nd of the 750ml bottles I've had that they make, I have yet to try a bad beer from them."
""
"Drinkability: A big and bold beer that sure will be a lot to power through in one sitting. Not available in Ohio, but another solid product from Schlafly."
"No date on the bottle but I purchased it in April 2011. Poured a light brown but still with light coming thru. The head settles quickly to lacing around the edges. I have let this one sit a bit out of the fridge and the aroma is still a bit muted to start with then it completely opens up. There is a sweet toffee along with maybe some plums and a light citrus. Wow, a lot going on here. The strong plum, heavy wheat and dark cherry start of but then the booze and a little spice take over to finish. The 12% is noticeable for sure but it tends to settle down a bit. I really like the light dryness on the finish. Very interesting and well done Quad. Glad I picked one up on a road trip."
"Drinks well for such a strong beer. I certainly want another and will probably get two to age. Great for the holidays or a cold winter night."

"I think a year or so only did well by this bottle. I quite like it and would recommend it, as I would just about anything by this brewery."

"O: With the exception of Westy 12, I'm not a huge fan of this style, however, I respect the brewery and hope they continue to make this to appease those who do dig Quads."
"2.5 D: This isn't too bad, but I really don't like the vinous character and the mouthfeel is a total turn off."
"Overall Impression- Very rich, thick, and good body! I'm enjoying each of these Schlafly Reserve brews almost every other night and have to say, these are real! Get your hands on any of them!"
"Very smooth, it was a bit thicker then I thought it would have been and most of the carbonation long ago died giving it a somewhat syrup like feel, although significantly lighter. Very nice sipper, though more then a glass is gonna hurt you in the end. This was a monster and there was no mistaking it."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Dark fruit and alcohol nose, flavor is malty dark fruit and hints of alcohol. Decent quad. $8.95 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall I'm glad I got this as an extra in a trade. Doesn't taste like any quad I have ever had before and hope no quad in the future."
"O- This is a quad I get all the time but I am a Schlafly whore, is there better quads ot there? yes but at this price point Schlafly sells it for it is worth getting instead of a high dollar quad."
"This is no quad, not even close. Still, it's a decent beer if you're okay with it not being as advertised - biggest downfall is the booziness which is not overly discreet."
"O: This is a totally decent quad; I'd say the only thing I dislike about it is the boozy character to it; maybe this would improve upon aging?"
"The mouthfeel is a little thicker than medium with only a hint of the alcohol, which is surprising considering the high abv. Excellent quad that I would like to try with a little age on it, as I expect it will only get better."
"O- I rated this a 4 because it's a good beer, but average for the style. There are other Quads worth seeking if you're looking for a good representative of the style. Not a bad brew, and I'm glad I tried it, but probably won't pick this up again."
"Overall, a decent but overly sweet quad which doesn't hide it's alcohol all that well. A nice sipper but make sure you have some folks to share this bottle with."
"This beer is definitely a sipper. The sweetness, thickness and 12% ABV all take a toll on the drinkability, but this is a good beer."
"Aroma was good. Dark fruit, Belgian yeast and some sweetness. Taste is not the the St Bernadus abt 12 category, but still fairly impressive. Rich dark fruit, definite Belgian character with the yeast and candi sugar. Just not as complex as some others. Mouthfeel is rich and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Drinkability is ok for this strong a beer. Solid, but I have had better. Might have been expecting too much because Schlaflys Tripel absolutely blew me away!!!!"
"I dug this one. Probably better to get a glass at a pub instead of the whole bomber to drink, but it is enjoyable. Missing some depth, but still very good."
"D: Not very alcoholic tasting, but something lingers on the palate here that i'm not crazy about."
"This beer pours a hazy brown amber color with two fingers of bubbly head that doesn't cling to the glass very well. The aroma has strong nutty malt notes with some hints of apple. The taste starts empty and then becomes very sweet of malt and nuts. Also has a fruity note to it and a very strong alcohol taste. Finishes overcarbonated and leaves a rotten taste in your mouth... Very unimpressed."
"drinkability is hurt a lot by the booziness. it's a strong beer, but it drinks like its even stronger than it is."
"D: This had a nice scent and taste, but it wasn't as rich or complex as most Belgian quads (typical of American attempts at the style). Nice body and decently hidden alcohol, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Didn't seem like a strong candidate for cellaring. Fresh was enjoyable but certainly not great."
"D--This beer will knock you on your ass. Worth a try indeed, I enjoyed this one."
"medium to full bodied mouthfeel; syrupy. average carbonation. not a bad drinker for being as big as it is."
"drinkability: Perfect for cold night under a bridge when you can't find a trash can fire anywhere."
"The body has a great bronze and reddish hue. The head also has a red tint to it but is more of a tan color. There is a lot of staying power to the head and some awesome lace. Excellent looking beer! It has very strong aroma mainly made up of malty esters. The taste is very rich. It initially has a grainy taste but settles to some chocolate and toffee like tones. This beer is just right in the carbonation department and has medium mouthfeel."
"A nice recreation of a Belgian standard, but doesn't really pop my palate like the Belgians do with this style."
"M & D - Fluffy and alcoholic. The booze is definitely in the taste over the nose. Very alcoholic."
"I'd say this is quite drinkable for something so alcoholic. This would be great in the colder seasons; I look forward to trying it this fall with a meal of tender, juicy roast of beef..."
"Like fire in a glass."
"D: The 12.0%abv, though not full realized on the nose, is certainly represented in the flavor therefore limiting this to a slow sipping experience limiting consumption. The bomber I found was at the further end of the drinking spectrum for me. Best shared with a friend."
"d - An ok quad but nothing special. Little too sweet for me; wouldn't seek out again."
"Fruit malt up front on this Quad, followed by just a tiny bit of booze on the nose. A really nice apple taste to this one, almost like biting into an macintosh apple, with some sourness to it. Dry on finish. Nice caronation and smooth body. Goes down pretty easy, almost too easy. Good drinker. I would revisit this beer again. Very smooth and enjoyable all around."
"**Edit** as good as this beer is cold, it gets pretty hard to drink as it warms. It becomes beyond boozy! This hurts the overall experience of the beer...but still a must try!"
"Poured a clear reddish brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy tart fruit, Belgian yeast and alcohol aroma. Medium body with a smooth sticky texture and lively carbonation. Medium to heavy tart fruit sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Solid complex brew."
"A solid quad, I would drink this again."
"This beer did not taste good IMO. It was super hot....hot hot hot. Very dry finish. Lots of initial sweetness immediately followed by very solvent-like alcohol. This may improve with age or some other mellowing technique. It just was not my favorite of the night."
"S - this is a really nice Quad. Others I was drinking with thought it was almost too sweet, but I preferred the taste over some of the other Quads that load up spices or dark fruits. This was a very nice example of a quad, albeit its high ABV and sweetness made it a little tough to take down after a while."
"D--- Pretty easy to drink, tried to share with my beer buddy, Beermantimmie, but he had to head home and take care of the baby girl daughter. Probably will improve with some cellaring, overall good quality."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a copper/red color with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, but not much lacing at all. Aroma is very sweet, malty and strong, it smells like dark fruit (figs, cherries, raisins), candy sugar, caramel malt, and a little bit of booze. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit, yeast, brown sugar, candy sugar, brandy, and some bready malt and spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's nice and creamy, and also has medium/high but soft carbonation. The smoothness of this brew makes it easy to drink, but the 12% ABV does have a kick to it after a while. Overall I think it's a good solid brew. It's certainly worth trying."
"By style, it's naturally not overly drinkable, with a high abv and dense full body. Taste is very pleasant though, making it a nice sipper. A pretty good representation of a Quad, but not the best I've had."
"Overall, not a bad rendition at all.. I'm guessing that with a little age on it this could be really really good. I'm gonna pick up another bottle and let it sit for a while..."
"Notes: Mnnnn, maybe nothing remarkable about this large bottle other than being a good reliable offering, which actually speaks volumes. Good quad, nice US take on the style, and will be happy to cross paths with it in the future although I prefer other Schlafly offerings."
"Almost all of the elements in this glass are things that I love in other beers. When they are all together at the same time though, it somehow becomes too messy for me to completely enjoy."
"One of the best quads I have had."
"As Belgians go, this beer felt heavy on my palate, though now I see it's a whopping 12%. By comparison to Bush Noel (also at 12%), I couldn't expect the mouthfeel to be any lighter. In the context of a dark, Belgian sipper of a beer, this is pretty decent. Still, the spicy, sweet fig, honey, orange peel and chocolate cookie taste of this quad, while interesting, isn't quite complex enough to stand up to the legends in this style while give your tongue a seemingly endless array of notes."
"Pours amber/red with a small off-white head. The aroma is caramel malt with some yeast, dark fruits and a little tartness. The flavor is more of the same with some alcohol, heavy malts, dark fruits and the same tart fruit that I got in the aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Very solid American-made quadrupel."
"Drinkability? I'm enjoying the unique flavours in this Quadrupel and the warming is welcome. Overall, good drinkability despite the fact that this will be only brew tonight. I heartily recommend giving this one a go."
"Also picked up a bottle to trade, should age nicely."
"D - For 12%, not too bad. That said, it's 12%! Very nice offering from my hometown brewery."
"750 bottle served in a Chimay chalice. Bottle conditioned. Opens with a big pop. Pours a clear amber tinted gold. Lots of carbonation, but only a finger of off white head. Slightly spice aroma from yeast. A bit of sugar and a little alcohol in the aroma. Full bodied and smooth. First sip seems pretty sweet, but that goes away pretty quickly, and the beer settles down. Nice and malty with some more spice in the finish. Dangerously drinkable at 12%. Alcohol is well hidden. Nothing spectacular, but a good evening's drinking."
"D - Nothing special and slightly boozy but it all seems to work together nicely."
"A well-made, enjoyable beer, and one I'll be glad to pick up again. As a fan of Schlafly, it makes me a little proud that they've made such a good beer."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & ABV, they need to slap a few 100 barrels into some barrels & run with this, well done Schafly!! Will definitely but a few bottles to trade or lay down; I see this improving at least over the next 2-3 years..."
"For the style, very well. More than a couple of these and I would be squinting to eliminate the second computer screen from my inebriated vision."
"Schlafly hits home runs with these special Belgian releases. The color fits with a deep brown, burgundy, plumb colored hue. Unfortunately the initial vibrant carbonation is short lived and makes short work out of the foamstand, retention, and lacing. Very fruity with plumbs, raisons, dates, figs, grapes, apples, cherries, and prunes. The power of the alcohol make the fruits taste and smell as if they have been soaked in rum. Never really fusal to taste or feel but definately heated and at times abrasive (think cough syrups). Otherwise a fruitcake breadiness leads the way and provides support for the confectionate sweetness, light tartness/vineous, and fruit flavors. Spicy throughout but not dry enough to allow the phenols to shine as they should. The beer is solid and nice but the lack of lasting carbonation leaves the beer too sweet and heavy on the surfaces of the mouth. Futhermore, the beer just lacks the depth and complexity of classic Belgian Dark Strongs."
"D - This is a great tasting brew. However, it is alot to drink. Needs to be shared."
"Nice dark brown to dark red color. Not much head. Big aromas coming off the glass. It smelled fruity and sweet and the taste went along with that. I would say this is just outside my palette on the sweet side. Very fruity and I could taste the alcohol. It' a big beer with a lot going on so I did not find it very easy drinking."
"D - very drinkable just on the edge of being too sweet but not"
"12% ?? No way, not the equation at all - scary brew, but a damn fine brew at only $9 a 750ml, an absolute steal. A good example that not all beers need the new ""fad"" of barrel aging (not that the barrels are a bad thing)."
