Lots of cedar and chocolate starts off with a rich prune and port wine. A tangy bitterness of pine and grapefruit rind and blood orange tingle your tongue. A long sweetness of dried raisin lingers long with a wheat bread and yeast note in the back of the tongue. Having been to Belgium I have to say this brew (from Sam Adams of all brewers) is quite delicious.  Though for nomenclature, this is more comparable to a dubble in flavor but with the body of a quad.","constantine_272","Feb 08, 2015"

4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml caged and corked bottle.  Served in a DFH signature glass, the beer pours a mahogany brown color with almost a couple inch creamy light tan head that stayed around for a very long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (plums, figs, raisins), cloves, molasses and some sweet spiciness.  It tastes like dark fruit (plum, figs, raisins), cloves, red grapes, caramel, molasses, oak and some brown sugar.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and is well carbonated.  The carbonation is soft, which helps make it easy to drink.  I thought this was a good overall brew, it's worth picking up if you've never had it before!","bluejacket74","Dec 22, 2014"

I was expecting a good brew, not an epic one!  Very rarely will I buy multiple $10 bottles of beer, but I immediately went back to the store the next day and bought the last 7 they had.  A beautiful pour of berries and oak hit you with a tasty aroma as soon as you uncork this masterpiece.  It pours a beautiful dark ebony color, has the perfect amount of carbonation and lace without overpowering the tongue. Very smooth and not too overly sweet for being over 10% ABV and overall this is easily the best new brew I have tried in many months.  Don't let the price tag scare you away, this is a world class and very beautiful beer.  I would love to shake the brewer's hand who came up with this gem!","ronniebruner","Dec 22, 2014"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good example of a American made Quad and it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style with some nice balance that kept some of the aspects from being too overpowering. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, fairly clean, rich. not too crisp, a little chewy, a little sticky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think half the bottle is a good amount for me, but I'm pretty sure I could drink a whole bottle without getting tired of it. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, I find that to be the biggest problem with these American made Quads, but this one had the balance right where it needed to be. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, I wouldn't mind seeing how it does with a some age and I would recommend it to just about anyone who likes Quads. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I'm a little leery on some of these American made Quads, but this one proved to be pretty good with no fancy bells and whistles, it was just a straight up good Quad. When I saw them blend this beer on tv they used some of their funky beer, Cosmick mother funk and I really didn't pick up any of that in this beer. This is one of the better Samuel Adams beers I've had and it's one of the better American made Quads that I have had. Good job guys, this one was a pretty tasty Quad, keep up the good work, I'll have to try more beers from their Barrel Room Collection.","StoutHunter","Jul 18, 2014"

This isn’t completely unexpected, as it is a Quad with 10.2% ABV, but masking that flavor would have made for a near perfect brew! Only avoid this one if you just absolutely can’t stand a strong boozy character; everyone else should snatch it up, especially if you love banana bread or holiday fruit cake.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jul 10, 2014"

4.76,22.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"O - For a long time a particular Belgian quad was hailed as one of the world's greatest beers. It could have been partly due to it's limited availability but I'd contest that this style is one of the hardest to replicate for American brewers because of it's deep complexity and inherent yeast characteristics. Having said that, Samuel Adam's nails the quad style with Tetravis so well, it could have come straight from Belgium. Rich maltiness provides a sturdy base while dark fruit and spice notes co-mingle with absolutely certainty; a completely brilliant beer!","BeerFMAndy","Jun 23, 2014"

The smell also has strong yeast notes. The taste is the same but a bit more distinct with dark fruits such as plums and sugar with a slight sweet boozy taste.

Aromas of big raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, molasses, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, toast, brown bread, molasses, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, molasses, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent quadrupel style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

4.18,7.2,4.75,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,"large three finger frothy head with good lacing on a very nice clear amber with maroon hues body. The beer actually looks very impressive. Aroma of plum, sour cherries, banana bread, caramel, spices (cinnamon), Belgian yeast. Flavor is a little disappointing after the aroma but still nice although the fruitness covers up some of the Belgian character. Flavor notes include, plum, raisin, currant, caramel, red wine. This one is fairly sweet too. Thin for the style, moderate carbonation. I felt the look and aroma couldnt be lived up to by the flavor. One of the better ones of this series for sure though.","kylehay2004","Oct 25, 2013"

3.99,2.3,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"O: This is a definitely an impressive take on the quad style by Jim Koch and company. One of the better American versions for sure. BBC/SA take a lot of slack from many people on here, and it leads to a lot of their brews being underrated (at least IMO). This one here is a winner, and in a style that in generally fairly difficult to pull off. Great job and great brew!","BEERMILER12","Jul 16, 2013"
