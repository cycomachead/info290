"O - One of the best."
""
""
"On tap at Sabatinis in Exeter, PA.  I am not the best reviewer of quads, but this is probably the easiest drinking and smoothest quad I've had. Flavors are strong but never overpowering. Nice smell, not too sweet, sits nice in the mouth, smooth head, smooth finish.  You will never know this is 10% ABV.  Nice start to my birthday."
""
""
""
"3/29/15 (Bottle)  - Excellent copper dark brown pour with thick generous off white head.  Generous scents of fruits, almonds, vanilla, caramel and malt. Pleasurable tastes and feel drinking, and a nice strong kick. Tastes included caramel, dried fruits such as raisins, malt. Great mixture and a great beer."

"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."
"an exquisite quad that definitely shows the world why the trappists are so good at what they do. beautiful deep dark brown with a nose dominated by sweetness and dried fruits. taste follows the nose and is exactly what i expect from a quad and more.nice thick-ish mouth feel and very warming. a great dessert beer or just a sipper after a long day. excellent, highly recommended"

"Excellent brew. You won't be disappointed. Watch out though.. It's potent."
""
"My current favorite quad. I got to sample this on tap at Yard House and it became my favorite kind of Belgium beer. The taste is so complex that it aroused my tastebuds wherever it touched (there's no better way to describe it). It's just so different from other beers I've had, so don't underestimate it. They did a good job hiding the alcohol too despite its high ABV. Paired well with happy hour food I had Yard House."
""
""
""
"Amber pour with light head.  Aroma of prunes.  Strong raisin/fig flavor start to finish - its a strong flavor true to the style, but I personally found the taste lacking depth."
""

""
""
""
""
"MF - Smooth even with the high ABV. - 4"
""
"Soft, enticing aromas of candi-sugar, brown sugar, plus an abundant array of fruits like, raspberries, figs, and pears. I could find barely a trace of the 10% abv. The flavor follows the smell; and it is incredibly rich and deep. The sugar is present, but this doesn't come across as all that sweet. A gentle blanket of warmth and a strong, fruity presence make sure this stays balanced. The body is full and lush with creamy quality that coats the mouth. Absolutely top-notch, what took me so long to try this?"
""

"Love this beer! Wish i ccould afford it more often!  My connection sucks so if I slure my words it's iPad problem"

"of red fruits. High carbonation and alcohol definitely present and a bit overpowering. This is a nice one but I fear I had it too early."

"Did a blind sampling of all trappist quads including westy 12 and I thought la trappe was the best!"
""
"Wonderful drink. Like a cognac liqueur ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great quad. A little fruity for me, but excellent nonetheless."
""
"Quadrupel beer, Spetacular in all directions!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a lovely copper/amber color with very little head into a La Trappe  chalice. Fruity nose. Taste is pleasantly sweet and fruity -- and boozy -- with notes of banana, raisins, and caramel. Almost wine-like in a way. Light carbonation and mouthfeel for the style.  Not my favorite quad, but it is nevertheless excellent if the sweetness doesn't bother you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a little sweet for me, however, the malts and hops balance it out pretty well. I have to say this is a damned good Trappist quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good flavor, it's a little cloudy for the style.  It might come across as a little too boozy for some.  I generally like these full bodied full flavored beers."

"Poured into La Trappe chalice. Pours a clear caramel colored brown with a bit of an orange tinge. My bottle was new according to the printed date, and my glass  was cleaned to the standards I have been taught, but I only observed about a finger of cream colored head that receded within a minute into a foamy sheet that clings to the glass. (I say this out of surprise after what I have read, but whatever, this is my review.) Smell was hinting of dates but overpowered by the banana pudding that was much more pronounced than I expected, and a finish of alcohol. Taste was hinting of dates, spice, and dark chocolate, but was again dominated with banana pudding. Had a a somewhat pronounced but not unwelcome or overpowering bitterness going down and a very slight earthiness in the aftertaste.  The alcohol is definitely deceptive, and did not make its presence easily known, especially for a beer with such a high ABV. It was velvety smooth from the moment of sip to swallow, with only a slight hint of carbonation on the tongue. Overall a very enjoyable experience that makes me wonder if my senses are more sensitive to banana pudding than the average person. I find that I don't have as much experience with quads as I would like, and as a result I may update my review score later."

""

""
""
"Pours a clear brown tinged red-orange with mild floaties and a thick cream colored head, half inch of which sticks to the end; sheet of substantial lace down the glass. Smell: toasted date bread, caramel, raisin, notes of red apple and cherry; just a little earthiness. Taste: brown sugar, dates, raisin toast, notes of banana pudding, clove, earth. Pretty standard but well done."

"O â€“ The flavour here starts off very well and it is very nicely spiced but for me the heavy solvent boozy end detracts from everything else this beer is doing. That is a shame really as it is a very nice beer and could have been better with more control of the solvent end."

"With a good balance of yeast, flavors, carbonation (just a tad present) and booze, this was everything that I could ask for in a Quad. Easily enjoyable from start to finish, there was a lot to enjoy here without feeling cluttered and heavy. A must-try for any Belgian beer aficionado and something that I'll be looking out for again. Just a notch below the best of this style but more than easily holds it's own regardless."
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Very light and well-carbonated for a Belgian quad.  Would be nicer if ABV were well-hidden."

"05/15/14 On tap. A fine, fine beer. Caution, as this 10% ABV bomb is deceptive. It's as slick & smooth as your grandma said it would be. I find this to be a faultless beer...unless you plan on having more than a few (2 or 3). The seduction lies in the ultra inviting balance bitter & sweet (which should be a good lesson in life). With temperance this could prove to be an ally. I, for one, have learned to live with it, gladly."

"Served on tap at Waldo Pizza in Kansas City, MO. Smells of smoke, malt and alcohol.  Taste lingers of oak, malt and alcohol.  One of the best quads i've had.  You definitely get some lingering alcohol, but its needed to balance the beer out and give it a bourbon esqe quality.  Classic"

"Tried on tap at The Social List, 4.25/5"

"Overall- I've tried this beer about half a dozen times and the bottles do vary. The older bottles are more fruity, tasty and the newer ones more ""alcoholic"". This bottle was fairly young and could be kept for a couple of years and the flavours would become more complex. Overall a potent enigmatic brew (like the type of beer I imagine druids drinking) . And at $8.50 N.Z for a 750 ml bottle not to be sneezed at."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours light reddish brown with an off white head, a little cloudy. Smells of very nice fruit bouquet and some Belgian yeast. Tastes of berries with nice barley aftertaste, very thick and a tad bit of alcohol. Beer is full bodied sipper, lightly carbonated. Overall, a very good beer."

"O: well balanced interesting beer with a full body, Leaving a warm sensation from the alcohol."
"330ml bottle. Tasting Chalice glass. Bright brownish amber color, deep amber tints to the light. Tan head is close & shows discrete retention, Intense caramel, alcohol, cane sugar, spiced, herbal & fenolic aromas. Kind sweet, slight toasted malty upfront. Toffee, biscuit flavors as well & involving heat. Medium to full body. Soft carbonation. Viscous & velvety mouthfeel. Peppery & funny palate. Low bitterness, fruit, dried nut & subtle wood notes are shown in the middle & linger into a long sweet finish. Ripe apricot, baked pear & apple flavors followed by memories of nutmeg liquor on the aftertaste. Flavorful, delightful & pleasant drinkability."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/8/2013. Pours moderately cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, light caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, light caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, candi sugar, toast, biscuit, molasses, herbal, light caramel, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and moderate malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is insane. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming after the finish. Overall this is a world class quadrupel. All around incredible complexity and balance of bright fruity/spicy yeast esters and balanced malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the ABV. An insanely delicious offering."

"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a tulip. Unsure of the vintage. Pours an amber hue with a rocky, two-inch, off-white head embedded with craters and ringlets. Head eventually dissipates into a algae-like slick with swaths and spots of lacing coating the edges of the glass. Nose expresses notes of bubblegum, a sweet vinous quality and a suggestion of something else; perhaps honey. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of a candied quality and just a trace of hops that is a bit muddled, but slightly evident at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, even carbonation that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the throat between quaffs. There's also the slightest oiliness to the texture. Overall, a decent Quad, but a bit too sweet. Not sure how well this will hold up in the cellar - I get the slightest sense of a metallic quality which I don't think will bode well for extended cellaring."

"750 ml. corked bottle. Tasted in a La Trappe glass, pours a small head that fades soon, but leaves a good lace. Smell of earth, barn, dark fruits, caramel, spices, raisins. Full body, sticky and oily. Taste of dark fruits, caramel, spices, raisins, some liquorice, dates. Alcohol is well hidde. Great."
""
""
"The taste begins with a tart, dark fruity note and a searing bitterness at the end. But it is not a pucker-up bite. It just drills its way into the sensation and lingers briefly. The booze is a bit more forward in the taste than on the nose. It's a Quad and it is meant to have some punch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a 22oz cage and cork pours to a glass with a medium brown color when held up to the light. Heavily carbonated on the tongue which is a good characteristic of a quad. Sweet initial taste featuring notes of honey follow by a bitter punch. Fitting because this beer claims to use two different hop varietals weighing in at a low 25 IBU. The thre different malts gives a hint of caramel on the nose. Excellent quad especially considering it's Dutch not Belgian."
""
""
""
"This is a good one. I still consider myself a neophyte in the style but as far as I'm concerned it's a good one."
""
"For a Trappist product, however, it doesn't really deliver the goods as some of its peers (most notably, Chimay Bleue), but it's definitely a good introduction to beginners to this often daunting, rich style of beer. It's a little too light overall for me and a little too phenolic on the yeasty side, but it's definitely one that I'd have again if offered to me."
"Overall, this is definitely a great quad but not top of the line for me. Probably my third or fourth favorite trappist quad."
""
""
""
""
"Very much like a tripel, though the color was a cloudy amber and the ABV higher. Good sized whiteish head that dissipated quickly, leaving a very light amount of lacing. Reasonably sweet, lots of bread/yeast flavor, minimal bitterness, light to medium body, hides the alcohol extremely well. Carbonation was less than I expected. Overall, good not great. Drank it at 48F from a tulip--I think I would have enjoyed it more if it were 5 degrees cooler. And if I'd been in a better mood--I'm recovering from frostbit fingers and was hoping that this 750ml bottle would lift my spirits; it did not. A little more carbonation would have helped too."
""
"This brew will definitely go in my rotation. Love it!"
"Overall a very good quad. I would have preferred less oak, but that is not a showstopper."
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
"Overall / Drinkability: A good quad, but one is enough per evening. Good with a meal (sloppy joes & green leaf salad) and I'm sure it would be good by itself as a slow sipping beer."
""
""
""
"A bit light on the mouthfeel and lacks complexity and sweetness."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Light head, and some light yet persistent lacing. Nose is sweet and fruity. Sweet and malty with a lightly bitter balance. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice sweet & fruity Quad."
""

"O: A good quad, definitely not the best. I'd take Bernardus or Rochefort over this any day. Pannepot is better as well, IMO."

"Pours out a nice dark orange/maroon in color with a great white three finger head with decent retention and a little lacing. Smell is of nice brown Belgian candy sugars and smells quite sweet. There is also some dark fruits in the background with a little cloves and nutmeg. Taste is nice and sweet likely from the Belgian candy sugar. You can taste some of the nice banana yeast in the background but it's not as upfront as in some Belgian type beer. I realize this is not a Belgian but it tastes just like one and is very good at hiding the high ABV of the beer. Mouthfeel is quite thick and great for the style. Overall a great Trappist beer that I need to drink more of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything a quad should be."
"O: this is my second go with this beer, my first experience being less than fantastic. This time the beer had a bit more age on it, at least another six months, and it made a world of difference. This was an enjoyable quad, not in the same league as the big boys like Rochefort and St Bernardus but a nice beer nonetheless."

"Quadrupel pours a dark cloudy reddish hue color with a nice long lasting head. There is a sweet dry and oakey aroma with nice mellow fruit notes. The taste has a mellow oakey backbone with a nice dry and semi sweet candied flavors, finishes warm and the oakeyness returns. Full flavors, good body, easy to drink. Overall a very solid quad."
""
""

""
"O: Belgian beer does not travel well to East Asia. Possibly due to having been left out in the sun and no doubt having been tossed about in cargo. I've had it a few times before and it's been fantastic so I'm adding points in consideration of that. I no longer think Belgian dark ales are the be-all-and-end-all of beer connoisseurship, but every now and then they really hit the mark."

"This pours a caramelly-amber in color with minimal foam. Thereâ€™s a great bouquet on this with notes of raisin and some light banana figuring prominently. Itâ€™s on the sweeter side for a quad, with a pleasing caramel-dried fruit characteristic and a rounded finish. Tasty. Didnâ€™t realize this was 10% until I posted this review."

"Poured into a snifter from a bottle bought at the local store. Dark orange color with a foamy head. A sweet malty smell, lots of fruit. Very smooth beer with strong banana flavor. The 10% hits a little at the end, but not as much as you would expect. Finishes with notes of oak, like a good scotch. Very pleased, definitely worth a second bottle."

"Overall â€“ A rather boozy and crisp quad with a whole lot of sparkling wine like characteristic. I was actually originally expecting something with more dark fruit flavors, so this was quite a surprise. It was rather interesting and nice and is certainly worth a try, although I think it is not really my thing ,and I think there are tastier quads out there."
""
""
"Very complex beer, good for having on a mellow pleasant evening at home. Highly recommendable."
""
"A trappist icon for good reason. Delighted to have found on draught."
""
""
"Overall, it's big, but untamed, uncouth and unrefined. Some might say that's great, but this feels like an experiment let loose like a tiger on a circus crowd. It doesn't have the structure, or the depth of purpose I want in a beer that's this big. This feels like someone let off a mound of TNT in a pile of bricks and hoped they'd get a house out of it. Big and explosive: but without the end result."
""
""
""
"83/100 for the style, 83/100 for personal taste."
""
"O: A very nice Quad, but I wouldn't put it in the top tier. A bit to sweet without enough esters and a bit too much caramel."
"Bottom Line: If your running the rails with trappist brews, this is a good place to start."

""
"I've been looking forward to trying this for some time. Superb, lightly spicy aroma with caramel malt and hints of honey. ABV well hidden. The light spicing in the nose is much more obvious in tasting. Rich and complex flavor but, unfortunately, it is just too sweet. On the other hand, the aftertaste is great."

"O - I had only tasted this beer in bottle before, so the draft was much better. In fact, I could use the term ""awesome."" Loved it."

"Had this on tap in Greece during my vacation. Overall a very nice beer. I did like the glass it was served in. Beer had a nice dark red color, not a lot of head but a bit of carbonation. Taste stayed the same throughout and it paired well with the German style fare that was served. Overall a very good beer."
""
"3.75 D: Tasty beer. I was in the mood for something just like this."

"O: Great quad, a little in the lighter side compared to other squads but flavor wise, spot on. A must have for the Belgian Beer people."
""
""
"In general, a wonderful complex beer. Doesn't fit the tasting notes of a quad. This comes with cellaring it for a while. Next bottle will be a year or more."

"To double check my analysis, I just took it to a discriminating Colleen and she said, yum, is this a grand cru? She gave the big thumbs up also. Big yum!!"

"O. This is a very flavorful beer which has a decent balance and screams Belgium Quad even though its from the Netherlands."

"Poured into a La Trappe chalice. Pours a hazy, almost coppery medium amber with a fine two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. Complex aroma of caramel malt,plums, dark dried fruit, light cherry and banana. A hint of sour and mineral. Flavor is sweet, well integrated fruit, dominated by plums, light hints of stone fruit, dried dark fruit and cherry, sweet malt. Finishes somewhat drier, leaving pleasant residual light hops, fruit and a touch of wood. Medium, creamy bodied. A very nice Trappist quadrupel that is a joy to drink."

"Overall: What a total beast of a beer, I mean what is there not to ask for. If you share a passion like I do for quality grab a glass and pour. Salud!"
""
""
""
"Overall a recommended beer, not a stereotypical quad but a very pleasant beer nonetheless."
""
"Quite an enjoyable quad. Hits all the high points of a belgian and an excellent interpretation of the style. On the fruitier, more bubbegummy side of the belgian spectrum. Recommendable."
""
""
"Overall: A very easy to drink and flavorful quad. Didnt really stand out much from others I have had but still very good and a must try."
""
""
"O - Not exactly unique or groundbreaking, but fulfills it's role as a smooth, flavorful Quad at a generally reasonable price. I'll probably drink it again, but I don't think I'll die if it comes off the market. If you're into Trappist beers though, it's a definite must-try."
""
""
""
" The Quad tastes like some toasted malt is present with the yeast adding a clove accent with mild honeylike tinge and floral hop element adding to the complexity with subtle alcohol in the taste and the strength is not all that apparent with malt providing the majority of the flavor with a nice effervescent yeast that leads to a dry mineral tinged finish. A great Belgian and originator of the Quad style I have been enjoying this for over a decade I am happy to drink this on occasion and it is very drinkable for the style."
"O: This is a pretty decent quad, but not as good as some of the others I have had, but I would for sure drink it again."
"V: Never doubt a Trappist ale... Great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: the taste is by far the best thing about this beer, but it's a bit too sweet for me. Has a nice balance though. Of all the trappists I've had La Trappe is the one I enjoy the least. This is not their worst beer though, and much better than some other heavy Belgian beers."
"Taste is richly fruity wine, toasted-caramelised grain finish. It is zesty yet silky, firm but not too heavy and nicely engaging."
""
""

""
""
"This is a fantastic beer. If you can get it, get it."
"O) I really enjoyed this most classic Trappist quad and am sure to buy more."
"chears."
""
""
""
"O: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, itâ€™s a decent beer but there are better options in the style."
"O: A good quad overall, and probably overlooked since it's so common. I don't know if it can stand up to Westy 12 or the Blauw, but it's still enjoyable and affordable."
"O: Very nice beer. Will have again, though not my favorite."
""
"O: It's an enjoyable belgian ale, with a lot of the spicy flavors expected in the style. It's on the sweet side, but still a solid representation of the style."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. Solid Quad."
"Overall: really nothing much to it, lacking character and proper mouthfeel; boring and too much like candy; maybe cellaring had a negative affect, this is the second La Trappe review I've had that ranked their beer way lower than others did, so something's up"
""
""
""
"This is my first beer from this brewery and while I've enjoyed a lot of the Trappist ales and tend to seek them out when I get the chance, this is just an OK beer to me. It tastes good but the esters in the beer are dominant. They power through any interesting malt this beer might have had to begin with and end up as a relatively boring one note beer. I drank my bottle of it and I will try other things from this brewery but so far I'm not overly impressed."
""
""
"This is one of the best Quads I've ever had. It doesn't get nearly as much fanfare as Westy, Rochefort, etc. but it's every bit as good."

"Overall - Really good stuff. I was expecting it to be a little more heavy taste and feel wise but the lightness gives it a nice drinkability.. albeit the beer has a high ABV - but its very well hidden."
"Food match: Dutch and Belgian cuisine seems appropriate for this borderline dessert beer: Boerenkool met Rookworst, MÃ¶ppkenbrot, Zuurkoolstamppot and Stoemp could all work."
""

""

""
""
""

"O-I was quite impressed with this one. It's sooo much better than the oak aged version. It has so many more flavors. It's so drinkable and the mouthfeel is so much more what I expect from a Trappist ale. I could get this again and again"
""
""
"Overall: Very good but definitely overshadowed by the Westy and Rochefort 10. Much thinner and with a dominating ester profile. Compared to the brown sugar/molasses of the others."
""
""
"-Overall 4.5: Excellent beer and what a beer it is! Quads are few and far between for good reason: few brewers can make one that is palatable. The brothers at La Trappe have turned out a brew that is not only acceptable, it is excellent. Highly recommended and worth the price you will pay. Also, please remember that this is a quad and it is 10% ABV (probably a little higher)."
"Huge frothy head when poured on top of a nice purple with ruby edges. Smells of spice and dark fruit, plums, prunes, grapes, raisins, apples, pears. Lighter color than I would expect from the style, but a pretty amber. Tastes of figs, raisins, plums and pears with some spice on the finish. Light bodied for a quad, but a nice bite at the end that keeps it from being too sweet. Good beer."
""
""
"Reddish brown colour with a large, pale, beige head. The head recedes to a retentive thin cap and coats the glass with lace. Aromatic notes of toasted bread, raisin, and fig with delicate pepper and only a hint of alcohol. The flavour starts of with toasted malt, joined by dried fruit and hints of brown sugar and peppery phenols mid-palate. Finishes dry and with a light medicinal note that adds complexity. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. The carbonation is fine and soft, giving the beer a somewhat soft and smooth mouthfeel. Good beer. I feel that this would be a fine meal-time drinker. I could see this pairing well with a red meat stew, like beef or venison, or with a good steak. This would also make a great accompaniment to a cheese board. It has enough flavour that it should hold up to the food, but not so much that it might outshine it."
""

"The mouthfeel was also nice, and the alcohol is at a nice level."
""
""
""

"O: A very sweet and drinkable beer that everyone should try. I especially recommend this is you like dark fruit presence in beers, as this beer is almost syrupy. The one gripe I have is that the yeast presence can get a little bit overwhelming at parts. That being said, it is still an extremely good beer. Okay Iâ€™m done typing. I need to get back to enjoying this amazing beer."
""
""
"Overall a wonderful beer and a true classic that no beer fan should avoid forever. It has everything you want in a great quad. The rich flavor and slight booziness reminds me of Rochefort 10, though it lacks a little bit of the power of that beer. Nevertheless, drink this one carefully and don't drive anywhere when you're done."
""
""
"Poured into a goblet. Pours deep hazy copper with a finger-length off-white head that recedes slowly, but does leave a small cap of lacing once it recedes.. There are plentiful visible tiny bubbles in the beer. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts. There are light aromas of dark fruits and banana with some mild sweetness. The taste has a nice blend of those bready and sweet malts along with the dark fruits and banana. The alcohol can be found in the flavor. The body is on the medium side of full with plentiful carbonation. The alcohol provides a warming character for this beer. It is a solid sipper. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"O: And from the Dutch Trappists, we get a winner. Itâ€™s not a perfect quad, by any means, but it really is delicious and drinkable, and thatâ€™s what counts in the end."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall - Good flavors. Maybe a little different from really great Belgian quads. The fruitiness is a little lacking and the alcohol is intense. Still enjoying the hell out of this, though."

"O - 4.25 - I'm really not a fan of banana notes in beer and am not really a fan of pears period. I detect both in this beer yet still really like it. I've had some other quads that promise more robustness than they deliver, which is surprising and kind of novel, but I want that back end. This one really brings it at a satisfying level. From the first sip it has the body I want. It's interesting to drink it slowly and see what the gradual warming brings."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey brown with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and spice. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: fantastic Belgian Quadrupel. Haven't had one before, but it kind of reminds me of how a port or a sherry is to wine - it is like a fortified beer - which it probably is, at 10% ABV. Only thing holding me back is the price - AU$116 per case in 2012. Ouch. To be honest though, it is in fact worth it."
"Well done, can't say that it offers anything unexpected or over-the-top, but good, rich flavors & a mouthfeel to grapple with."
"O: This Quad has a ton of potential but needs a year or two of aging to come around. A great beer for the cellar."
""
""
""
"The beer is brown in color, slightly veiled. Nice foamy head on top of it. Big bubbles. The head disappear quickly. The aroma is very fruity, some cherry and notes of bananas. In the mouth, still strong presence of fruits and some malts in there too. Strong and big beer. Chewy. A true sipper. Delicious. The ABV is well hidden. A nice one. Cheers!"
""
"O: This beer is quite enjoyable but it much more the sipping beer than one that is easy to drink. The alcohol is not as well hidden as I expected, making this take a little more effort to drink."

"Overall: Exceptional beer that is priced accordingly. I recommend 11.2 oz bottle which is a perfect finish to any evening."

"Overall a solid quad in the same league w/ Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12."

""
""
"An old favorite. A contender for favorite trappist. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Nice quad, but not one that I would put up there with the likes of Rochefort 10 or Westy 12. Still, a nice offering that is relatively easy to find."
""
"O- Not a bad Quad, but not the best in the world. Worth a shot (especially since it is a Trappist), but not a true jaw-dropper."
""
""
"(D)- A classic quad that fits the bill quite well. Fitting of the trappist name and reputation."
""
"Taste - um not exactly what I was expecting. There is a ton of yeast, and it dominates. Its such a yeast forward quad, that I had trouble getting past it. Definitely a spicy yeast that takes over the hints of dark fruits."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Super fruity quad for sure (not that that is particularly unusual). Very estery and a little boozy. Overall a good traditional example of the style."
""
""
""
"As the style would suggest, this is a good sipping beer that pairs well with reading or contemplation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's quite good but a much funkier quad than others I've tried. Less dark fruit and more Belgian.Â "
""
""
"Overall this is a good quad. Not perfect, but very nice. For it being such a big beer (alcohol) it mimics that of a lighter Trippel. Very nice indeed."
""
""
""
"O - This was a pretty enjoyable quad, although it's much better when closer to room temperature as the flavors seem to work better with the alcohol; Aside from the noticeable alcohol, the flavor and aroma are quite good and provide solid depth. I wouldn't mind trying this beer again sometime, preferably with some age to mellow out some of the heat."
""
""
""
"O: well balanced Quad, abv is deceptive, nice representation of the style"
""
"o: very complex and enjoyable, glad i was able to try it."
"La Trappe Quad has one of the smoothest pours Iâ€™ve ever seen, leaving a very creamy head that lingers quite a while and leaves beautiful lacing. Itâ€™s burnt orange in colour and carbonation just streams up the glass like crazy. Very, very nice looking. The smell has a lot of subtleties in it, which Iâ€™ve never been very good at describing. I smell some cherry and Belgian yeast mostly, with light spices. The taste is quite simply amazing. Itâ€™s perfectly balanced with a sweet malt character up front and bitter hops in the finish. In between its a great ride of spice and fruit. Mouthfeel, a 5. I donâ€™t normally do that but it actually is perfect. So incredibly creamy with a nice dry finish. I adore this beer, and I look forward to trying the other beers in the La Trappe Family."
"O - a tasty big brew, even though the whole idea of a 'quad' always seems a little contrived to me, I never look a beer horse in the mouth"
"O - Excellent Belgian quad, I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a amber capped by a nice foamy head with amazing retention. Lots of visible carbonation. Nose is ripe banana, burnt sugar, and booze. Taste is similar with the addition of dark fruit, perhaps plum is most evident. Medium bodied, buy very creamy mouth. YUM!"
"O: If I had to drink a single beer for the rest of my days, this would probably be it. It stands along side such greats as westy, rochefort 10, and st bernardus 12. Fastastic complexity, and amazing, amazing mouthfeel. This must have required a great deal of diving intervention. I would recommend above all others. Amazing."
""
"Overall a magnificent beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.1, a very respectable A-. Having had only this one quad I'm definitely not an expert in the style, but I knows what I likes. This is an enjoyable sipper that I would happily recommend to another newbie."
""
""
"Deliciously complex and underrated on here. What's not to like?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not too bad. Faint fruit though on the finish and not exactly moving a nice malt sense. Carbonation, seems to take away from some of the nice qualities, it's a little too fizzy and there's a hint of alcohol heat a bit. Pretty solid regardless, but not a favorite."
""
"Great big beer, itâ€™s prominently sweet but still good drinkable."

"O: great beer, great Quad, very complex and I love that its just a tad dry and the flavorful taste and nose."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O: Outstanding. Worth the price. I could smell this one all day and slowly sip the yummy Belgian goodness. This is a perfect quad."
"the exemplary belgian quad in my book. pours a nice hazy medium amber color with a vibrant off white head. nose of smokey wood, belgian yeast, and candy sugar. flavor is great, so smooth. ive got some slight fruits and some gentle sweetness. wicked complex. if i was less stoned id have better adjectives, but this one is hitting all the notes. mouthfeel is as good as it gets, very bright carbonation and a medium body turning into buttery silk. love the mouthfeel on this one. overall an excellent beer, even though it might score lower by these qualifications, i like it better than the oaked quad. just a perfect illustration of what a beer can be. lovely"
""
"O - This one has loads of hidden flavours and is extremely dangerous coming in at 10% ABV. You will not be disappointed and I'm hoping I can secure another bottle to age."
""
""
""
""
"Really a spectacular quad."
""
""
""
"Notes: Not too bad of a beer it's very sweet is not a bad thing and rather drinkable."
""
""
"O- I suggest you respect the ABV and sip through this one, although it was so delicious I wanted to keep the glass raised. You will want to savor it to the last drop. God bless the Trappist Monks"
"Drinkability: Excellent stuff. For some reason I get the feeling I am drinking a piece of heaven."
""
""
""
"O-The alcohol is much more noticeable than the other characteristics of this beer. It was enjoyable as an in between beer on New Year's, but nothing close to the quality of St. B."
"An ok quadrupel. Never my favourite style. A real sipper."

"O: 4"
"Dark burgundy elixer, a few fingers of roasted marshmallow head and bits of floaties, yumma...Smells like some sweet raisin and and sugar cookies, belgian yeast and faint coca cola. Thick sweet, bready, yeasty, a hint of spice, and lots of love in the palate. Basically it tastes like christmas dessert in a bottle. Really it is the epitome of all the flavors I taste in other Quads and say, I wish it had more of this or that. Well all those great notes are expressed strongly in this quad. Thick heavy body and cuddly carbonation caress the tongue in a syrupy chewy mess. Overall I'm a happy camper, if you have the means, I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, it was a good quad, but the smell took some points away because I really couldn't distinguish much else because of this."
""
""
"I have had every Trappist quad multiple times, and this one is my least favorite. Still, a decent beer and worth a try."
""
""
"O- one of the best Trappist Quads I've ever had! Not too much alcohol flavor like some other Quads (Rochefort 10), not too sweet, great overall flavor, is definitely strong but not too much so. Has a great complexity to it. Probably one of my top 10 favs so far in my journey!"
"I haven't been a huge fan of trappest beers, and this non belgian versions proves that monks should stay out of beer!"
"Overall: This is well balanced, flavorful beer deserving of the ""Quad"" title. If only it wasn't so expensive."
"O: Despite the feel, the flavors in this beer are delicious and the booze is hidden well, very drinkable Quad."
""
""
"Body is incredibly thick and syrupy."
""
""
"O: Really a balanced Quad. No date on the bottle, but I would very interested to understand the aging effect on this beer. This is the way a Quad should be."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's an enjoyable belgian ale, with a lot of the spicy flavors expected in the style. It's on the sweet side, but still a solid representation of the style."
"Overall, it is well carbed and the mouthfeel fits the style properly. There are several quads out there, and while this one is smooth and tasty, there are others that are better balanced with the sweetness."
""
""
"A nice enough Quad. The problem here is really that it is a ""mainstreamed"" quad lacking in the deep, rounded, rich and beautiful character of the Rocheforts and Westvleterens of this world."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good drink, but my only (?) other quad was De Struisse's Pannepot, which is devine, and this didn't appeal to me as much. Definitely worth checking out if you're into tripels, quads, and/or Trappist/Belgian medium-dark ales."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The alcohol is fairly present in this one, but it does not really detract from my tasting experience. Instead, it serves as a gentle reminder that this is a sipper and my speed of consumption should match that."
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as quads go it definitely doesn't make the list of favs which is disappointing. I was looking forward to it being a Trappist and all. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"O - I had this beer once, just before I took a Westvleteren 12. Believe me the La Trappe Quadrupel didn't have to bow before the Westvleteren 12, it uphold nicely. And therefore I say this beer is world class too."
""
"Poured a reddish golden brown, with a soapy white head; excellent lacing and pretty good head retention. Nose is lightly grapey, plums, vanilla sweetness, breadiness, some green apple and a touch of alcohol. Taste is very caramel-ly, plummy, sweet and more grapes. A touch too sweet for my liking (as I've always felt this beer is). Slightly syrupy and some spice in the finish. Slightly sticky and syrupy in the feel too, but but great carbonation. Full, but not too thick. Lightly alcoholic. Quite nice and this improves as it warms an aerates; a good quad that's on the sweeter side."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. The alcohol scared me a bit, but after a few sips, I realized how smooth it was. The dryness makes you want another sip. The taste makes each sip easy."
"O: This is a great Belgian Quad, one that I would definitely come back and drink again"
"Mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation. Drinkable, but it's best to take it slow with this one. 10% is no joke and you can get a bit of alcohol taste from this, especially as it warms, making it a little less drinkable. Overall, I enjoyed this brew."
"Overall- Like this beer alot, it is a very interesting representative of the style and it is a little different with its origins in the Netherlands rather than Belgium. You can really taste the difference and I loved that. It was very interesting."
"Quite a bit of a disappointment for me, as I really enjoy this style. This one, however, is just too sweet, the flavors aren't dark enough, and a bit monolithic in flavor."
"O- This has to be up there with some of the best quads. I really think I'll have to try some more offerings from Koningshoeven!"
"Overall: A great tasting quadrupel. I look forward to trying more!"
"OMG! This has got to make the top of the list! I've tried La Trappe's Tripel and Dubbel and Chimay Grand Reserve (Blue) has always been my favorite, until last night, when I tried this ""Quadrupel"" Smooth, Rich, Bold and perfectly balanced. Trappist Ale at it's best."
"D - Excellent example of the style, everything is great about this brew. Despite the high alcohol content, it has good drinkability and leaves you wanting more after every sip. Overall it's an exceptional beer."
"Overall - A very enjoyable Belgian ale. Has great front flavors marked by the tremendous carbonation, a middle where the smoothness and complexity really come out, and a tart aftertaste. Results in a comfortable alcohol-warming sensation from mouth to stomach."
"Overall this is a great beer, and a contender with the top quads"
"O: This is a nice Quad, very sweet - just as it should be."
"Pours a dark copper color w/ a nice three finger cocoa head. Massive lacing is evident on my snifter. Good carbonation as well. A little lighter in appearance in I would think for a Quad, but still a nice looking brew. The nose has blackberry, yeast, alcohol, caramel malt, slight hops, and other berries to it. A little on the weak side, but very nicely put together. It definitely improves w/ warming though, so I've knocked it up a notch. Taste is very similar to the nose profile, and you definitely get a nice alcohol burn on this one- almost too much so. Carbonated/alcohol burn/malty feel on this beer. I imagine this would age extremely well and really smooth out. It's a little too hot right now. Overall, this is a solid Quad Trappist Ale, and definitely worth getting if you enjoy the style... Cheers."
"Taste is wonderfully sweet and complex. More of lighter fruits, like figs, than other quads. Very rich, deep flavor. I can't help savor it as I drink it. Each sip is a little different than the last. Very creamy and also quite refreshing. Like other great quads, this one continues to be delicious as it warms."
"O- Solid Quad but was unfortunately able to finish it due to the excessive sweetness and alcohol burn."
"the waiter at Lazyboy's in White Plains brought it to me instead of the Triple that i asked for, best mistake of the evening. a dark pour that erupts with aromas of dark candies and a hint of plum. sweet taste that masks the high gravity of the beer. hops are not forward at all, mostly malt dominated but not detracting. one i plan to brew a clone of. drinks wonderfully, complexity increases as you let it warm up."
"On tap at Beermarket in Toronto. Pours dark amber with a lasting white head. Aroma is of caramel, dark fruit and brown sugar. Full, crisp body. Caramel, ripe fruit, alcohol, brown sugar create an amazing complexity on the palate. Long, balanced finish. An outstanding brew."
"D/O: 10% ABV is completely hidden here (until it begins to work it's devilish magic, as this beer will ""warm you up""). Wonderfully drinkable, and a great overall experience. One of, if not my fav, Trappist ale."
"D.ok...but very light...I expected something more assertive."
"O: Overall very nice, but I wish some of the darker flavors, and complexity from the smell carried over to the taste a bit more. Still, a very nice beer."
"This is very typical of why I like this style so much. Has a nice blending of flavors, has that typical Belgian candy sugar taste I have grown to like, and low bitterness. This would be an excellent beer to have on a cold winter night, the alcohol would keep you warm, and the taste would keep you wanting more."
"Good beer, but not among the best of the style. Certainly very happy to drink a bottle of it, but it would be nice if the sweetness could be toned down."
"Sweet, sharp, and underlaid with dark bitterness. Dark amber in the New Belgium tulip with nice lacing. Fairly coarse carbonation in the mouth, but lots of it. Alcohol is a hot hammer on the throat. More of a liqueur than a beer, but reasonably amount of hops. Hugely fruity with raisins, toasted fruit cake, and dried figs. Nice nose of roasted barley. Sweetness seems overpowering at first, but the vast range of the Belgian complexity gives it a lot of interest. I thought it was quite sippable at refrigerator temp, though it changes as it warms slightly and the darker, burnt flavors emerge more."
"Overall Drinkability - Great beer. Nearly identical in many ways to the Rochefort 10, but for some reason hasn't impressed me as much. I really like this beer, but rating it in style, now that I've had a few quads, this is going to be rated a bit below the user average."
"O: I wasn't expecting much going into this (compared to the other trappist ales) but it's pretty fantastic. Huge flavor profile with an abundance of fruits and light rum/burgundy alcohol presence. The mouthfeel isn't exactly what I like in the style, but it makes it easy to drink."
"O- Great beer, this one would lay down super nice and the alcohol would die down a bit. Super good and exactly to style."
"O- Strong in body and flavour but still pleasantly drinkable. Not even close to the harmony or complexity of most belgian quads though"
"O- Not a bad beer, but there's many quads I'd take over this one. It does have a fairly different taste profile than many of the style, and is fairly light bodied... But at this price point, it will be hard for me to come back to this one with so many other options available."
"Not quite as tasty and smooth as some of my favorite Dark Belgians, but nonetheless a success and a great beer."
"Price = $4.95 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"Sustained Taste: Flavor evolves, as a great beer should. Toward the end, a subdued milk chocolate even made an appearance, which was quite unexpected. Aftertaste is like a mouthful of rich buttermilk pancakes with maple syryp."
"While this quadrupel is a little more yeasty than I normally prefer, that sourness is held in exceptional balance with the sweetness. There is no denying that this is a very well-put-together beer. The flavors are compelling, the mouthfeel is excellent, and it finishes as great as it starts."
"O: Very complex. Absolutely beautiful flavors intermingling together. Incredibly easy drinking with no sign of alcohol presence. Delicious!"
"O: This is a good beer, but even if it's one of the ""true"" trappist beers, it doesn't feel like the one. It is slightly too sweet and slightly too thick to be as drinkable as the other trappist ales I had."
"M: medium body"
"This quadrupel was excellent and despite the warming feel of the alcohol at 10% it was not readily detectable."
"Overall incredibly good for a 10% ABV, with just the slightest hint of alcohol."
"It has a dark amber colour and a very thick, dense head. It has a bit of apples,pineapples and banana in the aroma, a suggestion of sugar or caramel in the palate and malty sweetness in the finish. I donâ€™t feel the 10% ABV. The brewmaster was very tricky."
"Poured from bomber into snifter glass. Pours clear mahogany brown with a creamy thick beige head. Aroma of wet, dank cardboard, dark fruit, dark caramel and some musty wood. The flavor is more sweet dark fruit, slightly sour yeast, plum, dark Belgian candi sugar, and some light bitterness. Medium to full body with average carbonation and a smooth, soft mouth feel. Overall a decent Quad, but seems a bit oxidized."
"This beer pours light to medium bodied and a dark amber in color with a one finger off white head. It is very translucent for the style. I really expected something darker. It smells of sweet brandy, plums, and is very bready. You can definitely get a good amount of sweet malts from the nose but the 10% is well hidden. The flavors are much sweeter than anticipated. You get alot of sweet, fruit infused bread, a ton of yeast, plums, and candied sugar. It's definitely the sweetest quad I've had yet. I just can't get behind the flavors. There just isn't enough going on if you can get past all the sugar. It drinks fuller than it appears. It drinks medium to full in body and is a smooth drink with no alcohol left behind in the aftertaste. Perhaps I'm being picky, but I can't get behind this beer. It doesn't come anywhere near anything by St. Bernardus and it's in the same price range. I wouldn't necessarily want to try this one again."
"Poured into a Westmalle chalice- light chesnut color with a warm red glow when held to the light, fizzy cream colored head also tinted with the red hue. Smell is complex with hints of alcohol - fruity and nutty. A wonderful, rich taste which reveals different flavors in time. Dark fruit, rich malt, a hint of chocolate, and an ever lingering flavor of raspberries...chocolate covered raspberries! The mouthfeel is excellent - the velvety texture coats the mouth and remains for quite some time. An excellent beer and more motivation for me to seek out more Quads to try."
"This is a damned fantastic beer, though I will say that I wish it finished just a bit drier. Nonetheless, it is phenomenal, and the alcohol is so well hidden that this beer is damn dangerous. Fucking delicious."
"O: love the style and would recommend this one. Perhaps a bit too carbonated and would like some more aroma but a nice effort here."
"Drinkability/Overall-I've had better Quads but this is still a great beer."
"Poured a dark brown with a small but thick head that retained throughout the session. Sugary aroma, and bready with Belgian yeast. Very strong taste, as would be expected. Sweeter and more fruity than many quads I've had; caramel and brown sugar, plums and nectarines. Definite alcohol bite. Medium mouthfeel, well carbonated, and decently drinkable, but not in large quantities. The sweetness is not a bad thing, but I do prefer other quads to this."
"Delicious flavorful brew, a real joy to drink in spite of the wallop it packs. Highly recommended."
"D - tasty but not something I could drink more than two glasses of."
"(750ml bottle). Pours slightly hazy mahogany with a light tan head and very active carbonation. Aroma has great ripe pit fruit (plum), candied sugar and dried fruit (apricot?). Taste is sweet but not cloying. Very light hops on the end. Medium bodied with a slick/sticky texture. A bit fizzy and a smooth finish. This is La Trappeâ€™s best commonly available beer and a world class quad. The alcohol is expertly hidden, which makes this a dangerous beer."
"O: Almost too much for me at first, but given more time to get to know the style I could see myself growing too appreciate it more. I won't necessarily be rushing to find another bottle, but it's definitely worth trying."
"I enjoyed how fresh and fruity this first appeared, before hitting you with the sweet boozy characteristics you come to expect. Not my favourite nor the most complex quad around, but is a fantastic sipper on this Easter Sunday."
"I've loved this Quadrupel since the first time I had it a few years back. I felt that I needed to revisit this to give it a fair review. Poured this into a snifter glass. It's got a light muddy brown color with a thick tan head on top that stick around for the majority of the time. The smell of this beer sucks me in every time. The aromas that come off of this brew are sweet fruits and some nice malts with just a bit of yeast in there. It nearly smells like candy to me. The taste is lovely, all those fruits and the yeast come alive once it hits your tongue. It tastes pretty much exactly how it smells. The mouthfeel has a really nice creaminess to it and mixed with some lively bubbles this beer just impresses me with each sip. A must try."
"Served from a 11.2 oz bottle in a small tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy orange amber color with a finger of white thick head with nice retention and lacing. The aroma is strong with banana, orange and spice notes. The taste and mouthfeel is quite thick and somewhat buttery, with similar notes as the aroma. Overall an ok belgian quad, but definitely not the best."
"-Flandes Bar in Oviedo, Asturias"
"O: Nectar of the gods. Hard to imagine anything better. Get it if you can."
"Loved this. Easy to drink, but not sessionable. Sweet, fruity, complex, and bitter appropriately. Almost passed this by. Loved this. Nothing harsh."
"O- An excellent beer and an exceptional Belgian."
"Overall this beer is a pretty good quad but not as good as chimay blue or rochefort 10. Probably my least favorite Trappist beer that ive tasted but its still good because all the other Trappist beers ive had were exceptional. For me it taste more like a barley wine then a quad."
"O: I love this beer. It's not overwhelming in alcohol or the spice flavor you often get in high alcohol trappist ales. It's very very sweet and the alcohol just warms all the way down."
"-This is a very nice quad, but not my favorite. Seems very consistent with the style, but nothing about it knocks me off my feet (except the alcohol). Glad to have tried it...will buy something else next week."
"Notes: First review for a La Trappe that I confess I had left aside for quite a bit. But not the first recent brew, I had their dubbel a month or two ago, and it was quite good. It made me want to see what their quad was all about and it proved itself well worth it. I'll sure keep the close to the surface in my choice of Belgium errr Dutch brews and Trappist ones in particular."
"M/D: Great overall experience. I wouldn't drink a bunch on these in one sitting as i think its important to give all your attention to the complexities of the first bottle. Great Brew."
"M/D: This had a medium amount of carbonation, it was on the sweeter side as quads go, but it was still really good. There seemed to be a lot going on, fairly complex, I would like to try a bottle that had a few years on it and see if it balances out a little bit. Having said that, it still is really tasty. Worth the purchase."
"D - enjoyed this very much after a bowl of spaghetti bolognese. Held it's impact all the way through, surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content but I would be a mess after a few."
"My 11.2 ounce bottle looked nothing like the one in the photo."
"D: Good quad. I would like to taste this when aged b/c as it stands - fresh is to strong for me."
"D: Very good. I like the sweetness and the age has really subdued the alcohol to levels that can't be easily detected."
"Though my review was short I did thoroughly enjoy this Quad."
"-Very good quad here, not up to par with its belgian trappist counter parts but def worth a try."
"Overall this beer does a very good job at mingling high ABV with great Belgian Quad flavors to combine for great taste and experience. On the lighter side of the amber/dark quad spectrum; it really highlights the vinous/grape/pear end of the spectrum. Not my favorite QUAD but def top notch."
"8/10"
"Fantastic beer, how can it be anything but on the same level?"
"It's hard not to compare this with Chimay Blue - Similar price, accessibility, ABV and style. I think this is more malt forward than Chimay, almost like a dopplebock. If your into that sort of thing, this should be your choice."
"D: Somewhat lighter and fruiter than the other trappists that I have tried so far. Surprisingly drinkable and smooth for a quad."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was its rich, aromatic scent. As soon as the beer was poured, and helped along by the carbonation no doubt, the immediate area was filled with ripe, tantalizing esters. While this made the beer so inviting, and seemingly irresistible, the taste let down a bit. It was flavorful, but lacked complexity. The primary notes were sweet and boozy, leaving the drinker wanting more from such an ambitious, powerful style."
"T - Pretty much the same as the nose and for that, I was a bit disappointed. Also, I may be a wuss, but the alcohol-laden resin-y aftertaste was rather off-putting and since I enjoy a good barleywine, I think it was this beer in particular."
"D: It's a little sweet but overall the drinkability is pretty good."
"I might call this a ""poor man's trappist," as it's pretty good but not nearly as interesting as Saint Bernardus or even Weyerbacher's Quad. This costs about as much as those, though, so if you might want to skip this if you can find other Quads."
"WS"
"d-This is a big beer but I could have a couple bottles of these for sure. Very nice."
"Drink with care."
"D: A solid quad all around and something I will probably revisit."
"Beer is thin feeling but flavorful. There's bold an sweet maltiness along with the chewy sweetness of raisins and apricots. Other than that it falls a little short. Alcohol is hardly present which really contributes to higher drinkability. Clean finish with only hints of aftertaste."
"D: Drinks very easy without a hint ofthe alcohol. Still a big beer"
"Drinkabilty - Very tasty and strong. One of the best quads, not thee best but worthy of talking about. Its 10% so 1 and done for sure. Would drink again for sure."
"D - Dangerously drinkable at 10%. Not the greatest Quad I've had but I could definately have a few of these in a night."
"Dr: At 10% abv, it'll knock your socks off, but at 12 USD a bottle (in Denver, CO), it'll do a number on your wallet as well."
"Amongst the group this received on average a solid B rating. Very pleasant look and fel on the initial, and then follow up also very good. I would recommend working on bottle appearencenif they hope to attract the curious as it leaves much to be desired. Don't be put off though, this one is worth the try,"
"D: This is exactly what I expect from a Quadrupel. It drinks lighter than its ABV and is an excellent accompaniment to a cold Winter Solstice."
"Pours a hazy dark amber with a rocky light tan head. The nose is dominantly apple, spices, bready malt. Taste is sweet, medicinal, caramel, light fruits. Bold flavour on the sip and mellow into a quick finish. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, sweet and sticky on the palate. Large format bottle will be plenty, not so sure I'll repurchase but was interesting to try."
"this beer does a very fancy job at mingling a high abv with flavor taste and experience."
"What an amazing Quad...deep ruby color, slightly tart and very refreshing. I swear I tasted pomegranate in the finish. I'm reviewing a while after the fact but had to put something up to show my support. I'm a big fan, and this will be finding its way to my cellar."
"A highly enjoyable trappist ale, certainly very alcohol-rich, but with a solid flavor profile that makes for fun drinking. I still think I prefer La Trappe dubbel, but this Quad is lovely as well."
"Too much alcohol interference, but enjoyable otherwise."
"750ml bottle with the first glass pours a slightly clear dark brown, and the second glass a hazy brown colour. Decent amount of foam as well. Tastes of brown sugared dark fruits with a nice smooth finish. How is this 10%? Seriously. I wanted another glass when the 750ml was gone. Only have one bottle left and I want to save it. But I might have to try and grab more before they sell out in town. Very damn nice quad."
"Pours a deep brown colour with ruby hints coming through in the light with a thick head that settled to a 1/4"" that sat on top of the glass. Fantastic lace left on the glass. Smells of yeast, dark fruit with a noticeable sweetness in the nose. Sweet yeast comes first on the palate followed by dark fruit and a taste similar to licorice. Almost no alcohol to be tasted here, and as it warmed it got so complex and delicious. The mouthfeel is initially syrupy but still smooth. This drinks like a dream, you would never guess this is 10% ABV, could be dangerous but I like it. Fantastic brew that I waited far to long to try, good thing I have three 750ml bottles tucked away."
"This beer does get some great reviews from BAs that I trust. Not sure how to square that with my experience. I will say, it seems that many are reviewing vintage bottles. Maybe my fresh bottle just hadn't hit its stride yet. I'll have to revisit this one."
"Poured into a La Trappe chalice bought in the Christmas gift pack. Pours a deep amber color, murky amber with a light beige tan head fine even Belgian style lacing. Aroma a dish of fruit in a cornacoupia style setting, with mild spices from the Belgian yeast. Awesome amounts of dark fruit soaked in alcohol big malt layers blended wth the balance of Beligan yeast strains. Carbonation is medium bodied effervescent carbonation flows smoothly goes down so easy, excellent big Belgian style quad. Drinkability is incredible smooth easy going I can't believe my senses this is smooth big beer at it's best."
"D - Not bad but I prefer other quads. The booze is not hidden well enough."
"A dark burnt caramel color with a great head and good lacing. The nose is comprised of light bubblegum notes, dark fruits, dark bread with yeast characteristics, and candi sugar. The taste is very similar but much more complex, the bubble-gum flavor is lighter, mellow dark fruits minus the acidity, nice caramel and candi sugar flavors, a very encompassing brew that flows from flavor to flavor seamlessly. A very impressive flavor profile. The mouth-feel is close to great; a tad more chewiness would send this beer up into flavor heaven. I love this quad and can honestly say that this is my favorite."
"Wow, what took me so long to try this quad? Maybe it's just how much I liked it or my mind playing tricks on me, but I thought this was more like Westy 12 than St. Bernardus (been over a year since I've had Westy 12, so take that with a grain of salt). Very pretty mahogany color with nice pillowy head. Nose is rich with Belgian yeast notes, a bit of booze, dark fruit, and a nice malt backbone. Flavor is robust and delicious, hitting the same notes in the right proportion. This one is spot on, as far as I'm concerned. Nice medium to medium-full MF, smooth and creamy. Took me a while to sip it down, but that's because I was enjoying the hell out of it."
"Light to medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and there is a bit of a sweet aftertaste, combined with green apple. I like this beer quite a bit."
"Drinkability: very, very tasty and quite drinkable. I think it might take me awhile to down this, however; 10% ABV is quite a lot."
"A decent quad, that's easy to drink, but I'm not sure if I would get this again."
"D - Drinkability is high. This beer is one of the lightest Quads I've had before. The sweetness and alcohol do not overwhelm, the finish is dry, and each sip goes down just as smoothly as the one before."
"D I really enjoyed this beer. I drank about a third, then had some sushi, and it went quite well with the sushi, better than the thin Japanese beers I normally have with sushi. 4"
"D - Again, this is easily one of my favorite Quads, Easily comparable to Westy12. I love drinking this one on a regular basis."
"The flavor is nice with a bit of malt sweetness and light booze. The yeast does a nice job creating some esters alongside caramel plus plums, dates, and other dark fruits. A really nice body with a bit of booze. Helps bring out the complexities of the brew. Drinks quite well and was the last Trappist brewery that I needed to try to finish off the list."
"still, won't give up on this one, think it will age well, but can't deny the fact there are far better regular quads around, 9 times out of 10 will pick a roch 10 over this one!"
"After struggling to get the cork out of the darn bottle (ended up using a wine opener!), I was pleasantly greeted with a lively head atop a deep cherry mahogany brew. Smelling of spice, caramel malt and lots of yeast, the taste offers similarly sweet and spicy flavors not unusual for this style of beer. The 10% abv is well masked amidst the strong flavors and creamy mouthfeel, finishing with a little bit of stickiness and just the slightest bit of sour bitterness. Not at all unpleasant, I would be happy to find this in my fridge again!"
"O - World-class - one of the first I think of when the style is brought to mind - Koningshoeven's La Trappe Quad is an iconic brew with few rivals. Rich malt complexity and Belgian yeast rouse spectacular fruity characteristics to the forefront of the palate for a beautiful beer!"
"Overall a very good quad and probably even better on tap than it was from the bottle."
"OK, but not a great beer in my eyes."
"drinkability; smooth and classy but the alcohol will sneak back with a bite, definatly a beer to respect."
"Quite balanced in flavor and texture for such a big Belgian ale. This Trappist offering certainly does not disappoint."
"D: I think if I just want to sit down and drink this would be a great beer to just sit down and drink and drink and drink. I could literally drink these for hours."
"D= As I mentioned earlier. This is dangerous. Really dangerous. A great quad but it's a little lighter than I expected. Most quads are sippers and contemplate beers but this can be either. This is good enough to sip or realy put back.... though I don't recommend the latter."
"From reading other reviews, perhaps I had one past its prime? I don't know, it seems unlikely that a quad would be past its prime in this day and age. Perhaps I'll try again later. Got it at a bottle shop in AK that had plenty of Belgians with a few years on them. Shoulda been prime, methinks.."
"D: A nice beer, pretty easy to drink for such a high ABV beer, and not really any discernible alcohol on the flavor or nose, either."
"Very dark color, smell of dark fruit."
"This is a strong beer, for serious sipping only. While pretty darned good, it's hardly likely to become a favorite. I'd prefer a Fin Du Monde or a Maudite, actually."
"Overall impression: sit back and savor this excellent quadrupel. it is arguably one of the top ten beers of all time!!!"
"Overall: Excellent trappist quad. Buy it if you see it."
"This is the best Quad I've ever had...hands down. The apperance was good a dark ruby red (not like any other Quad I've ever had). Smell was very nice. Sweet malts w/ a hint of hops. The taste was very much on par w/ the smell. Sweet malts w/ just a hint of hops. I picked up a good bit of dark, sweet fruit w/ a nice hint of caramel and something else...nutmeg maybe. The hops were very mild at most. The mouthfeel was very nice as well...full and smooth. Drinkability was wonderful. I would never have been able to guess its clocking in at 10%. I hope everyone gets to try the beer at some point in their lives."
"Reddish brown in appearance. Not nearly as dark as other Belgian Quads that I've had. There was almost no head, and what was there was dissapated within 2 minutes. The smell is a little better than the appearance. Sweet malt and hops. Mouthfeel is better than I expected. The carbonation is the first thing I noticed, but the alcohol is not overwhelming. Slightly warm. The taste was also very nice. Dark sugars, but with a nice bitterness to counter. Nice malts and yeast flavors. Better than I expected after pouring, but not an everyday beer."
"The finish is sweet, soft and silky with lingering full flavors. The Quad is so full and complex, but its distinct flavors are rounded so perfectly it really create a unique and graceful beer. This beer is a magnificent achievement and should be appreciated; without a question it has provided me with some of the greatest beer drinking experiences that I have ever enjoyed."
"Poured into my Chimay glass from an 11.2 oz bottle. Looked like a reddish brown in color. Had the scent of figs, honey, and alcohol. Tasted like you would expect a Quad to taste. You can tell there is alcohol in it. IMO the alcohol is more noticeable in this beer than a Rochefort 10 but like the Rochefort it is so drinkable it isn't even funny. Great beer for socializing. Horrible beer for sucking down like water just to get drunk as quickly as possible. Way too good of a beer to waste like that."
"Definitely a top-tier quad - a must try if you enjoy the style..."
"jd"
"D - Extremely drinkable considering the style and ABV. Amazing"
"This beer is very drinkable, and seems to be lighter in body without sacrificing any flavor or substance. I could easily have a few glasses of this. Overall, a very nice beer."
"D: Awesome. I would drink this quad until I fell off my chair. At 10% ABV, that wouldn't talk long."
"D- With this much alcohol, the beer really needs a much larger body. The alcohol overwhelms the flavor. It was good, and I'd drink it if I was in the mood for a quad and it was my only choice...but when does that happen?"
"D - I'm a big fan of Quads and this was no disappointment. Very smooth and the alcohol is really well hidden."
"Glad that i drank this one on tap but i was not flabbergasted!"
"taste mostly follows the nose, deliciously complex - noticeably lighter and sweeter than some of the other noteworthy quads (i.e. rochefort 10) and IMO not quite in that upper eschelon, but still a tasty offering from the monks. medium-bodied, style-appropriate carbonation. it's a quad, so for me drinkability is capped at a bottle per sitting."
"Full-bodied with average carbonation. Gets creamier as it warms. Easy to drink for a beer this big and really enjoyable. A great dessert beer."
"Had this on tap at Volo. I love that I can frequently get this here. It poured a dark reddish-brown with thin head. Smell of candied fruit - cherries, plum and raisins. I get the Belgian yeast flavour with bready malts. Very smooth mouthfeel. Not my favourite, but still an excellent quad."
"D - This is a very complex but overly boozy beer. I enjoy all the elements, but find the way it is put together to be out of balance and a little disappointing."
"750 ml Koningshoeven bottle -- corked with metal cage. Pours a a hazy dark amber-brown with a creamy white head. Aroma is hoppy with a maple character. The aroma is relatively complex -- other elements are noticeably present but difficult to distinguish -- and culminates in a sort of earthy, fresh smell of the outdoors. Flavor comes in three stages: initially a strong maple character, then a wave of fig and dark fruit that crescendos to a strongly alcoholic, malty finish -- a flavor that is sweetly balanced and symphonically complex. Very strong with a light-to-medium body. A distinctly earthly character that resonates with the sound of silence."
"The beer pours a slightly dark copper amber color with pretty good head retention and lacing. This is another beer that is just viscuous looking in appearance. The nose is very reminscent of the dubbel, except there's not as much brown sugar, and this beer has more spice. The rootbeer and cola aroma is much more pronounced, though there's some orange peel and light chocolate in the background as well. On the palate, this beer is quite sweet, but the flavor profile otherwise is just stunning. There is just an incredible melange of rootbeer, caramel, vanilla, maraschino cherry and light chocolate. Absolutely, this is beer dessert for those who don't like dessert. Mouthfeel is rich, soft, full and long.... just delicious. Drinkability is OK, though the obvious high alcohol and sweetness is just a bit much. Still, this is just an excellent Belgian Quad, especially if one can find it on tap."
"perhaps some time would mellow it out a bit, my only complaint is the booze could be better concealed. All in all a solid beer from a the only Trappist brewery outside of Belgium. Not being as well known as the others this brew tends to fly under the radar(at least my radar) but when all's said and done this is a lovely beer that's well worth trying"
"Overall, a really solid beer. I don't know if it had that little something extra that truly knocks my socks off, but there's absolutely nothing I could fault it for. I'd say that it's quite well done, but probably not my absolute favorite quad. But then, this is from the bottle. Maybe on tap it would have more nuance."
"A very drinkable quadrupel ale."
"My least favorite of the 4."
"Overall, an excellent brew that's a great example of the style. Worth seeking out."
"O: This belgian quad has a great nose on it. Great to style, but just doesn't pull through in the flavor/body compared to others, although it is great nonetheless"
"This was a bit more of a subdued Quad. Good beer that is worth a try, even if it isn't the best Quad out there."
""
"A lot of sweetness and taste in this one, a dessert in itself."
"Mouthfeel is a bit stingy, and lighter than expected."
"D- its 10 abv and quite sweet but the spice holds it at bay and really keeps it drinkable. Is it the best quad I've had no but its pretty solid."
"Update: Just had a bottle from 2008, exceptional, the aroma improves dramatically and the warmth subsides, the depth of flavor is unlocked. This is a world class Quad/SDA when aged."
"D: Quite strong, I don't think it would be wise to have another bottle of this or to drink a 750 of the stuff alone, but it is enjoyable and isn't hard to drink. Quads are a hit or miss style for me, and this one is definitely a hit. Nice beer. Recommended."
"There's a lot going on in the nose - pepper, brown sugar, raisins, plum, cherries, apple with a bready, malt combining to create an almost fruitcake-like backbone. The taste is sweetness of the dark fruits hit first (cherries, raisin, plum), the malt and breay foundation and then a light hop background, especially in the finish that makes this complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. While this was served too cold, I allowed it to sit long enough to get more of what was a very tasty, very complex sipper - good thing at 10%. I will seek this out again absolutely."
"Drinkabilitiy: A very good value at around $9 for the bottle which I will definitely be picking up more of. A great beer to sip after a long day of work (which I am doing now!)."
"D- This is most definitely a sipper, but what better way to enjoy a beer of this style. Stands up with some of the better quads out there."
"A good beer but the aftertaste of rubbing alcohol distracts from the rest of it."
"Really nice. But falls just short of a Rochefort 10 or Chimay Blue. For me, not quite as refined."
"Drinkability>yes, please... Wait.. this is 10%?! Maybe only ONE more=)"
"D: Although the alcohol doesn't stand out prominently in the taste and is rather well masked, this definitely feels like a strong beer and needs to be sipped slowly."
"Rolls Royce in your glass. I do believe I have found a new favorite, as this beer is without a noticable flaw."
"Recommended."
"All the tastes really come together to make a great beer"
"D-this is one heck of a great drink. Big flavors with a beautifully done complexity and light balance. What texture to accompany the flavor, I wish I had another!"
"It is medium bodied on the palate with having some pretty good drinkability for being such a high ABV beer. Could barely taste the alcohol but it became present the first time I got off of my bar stool. A great quad."
" Overall, a good beer but i'm used to quad's and SDBA being VERY complex with a pillowy feel, this one falls just short but still a fun brew."
"M + D: Medium bodied... not quite as full as many quads, but it isn't too horribly thin. A little sparkling carbonation on the back of the throat, tip of the tongue. Alcohol keeps itself very well hidden, considering the content. A beer I'd happily revisit, though I don't know if I would place it on the same kind of pedestal as Rochefort 10, Westvleteren 12, or even Chimay or St. Bernardus Abt 12"
"very nice but lacks the depth of the other trappist quads (e.g. westvleteren 12 and rochefort 10)"
"MF wise its not too carbonated, but is spicy and has a typical alcohol warmth."
"good but not fantastic."
"I'm feelin' this ale! I'll buy this again and tell other people about it."
"Overall - Delicious beer but right after the Rochefort it's apparent that it could be slightly better balcanced and delicious but very good."
"D â€“ Awesome. I love it."
"D - very solid Quad...held back only by a hefty amount of alcohol in the nose and taste. next chance i get, i'm buying a couple bottles to sit on for at last a year, as i think this may develop into something superb."
"Clear, dark copper. Billowing head. Looks great. A nose of sweet, dark fruits, Belgian yeast, figs, raisins and dough (with a hint of cherry just for me). This is a wonderful beer. The alcohol is perhaps not as well hidden as some of the Belgian Trappists have managed to do but this is overflowing with flavour, body, complexity and class. Considering it is usually around half the price of the other Trappists it's pretty hard to go past it."
"??"
"Certainly a keep-you-warm-in-the-winter sort of beverage, this is, with the requisite memories of summer field fruit, and an adequate amount of deftly obscured booze to help suppress them. Wait, this is a Trappist brewery, so I suppose I must proffer a comparison to the standard bearers for the style, etc, etc. Ok, then - this is barely worthy of mentioning in the same breath as the Rochefort 10s of the world, but that's no big deal - sometimes a bit of scaled down complexity, and upticked drinkability is a good thing."
"D: Alcohol is paired well with large body. Was expecting less pCO2 and more of a syrupy mouthfeel."
"D: Reasonable. Balanced sweet-bitterness. However, the high ABV can be noticed here. Recommended anyway. This is a classic Trappist, after all"
"D - Not exactly the most drinkable beer because of the present taste of alcohol, but I don't think it's that hard to finish."
"d: not the most drinkable beer, is not too big of a challenge to finish a bomber by one's self, but the alcohol presence is definitely there. Not too much heat, just there. The alcohol smacks you in the face a little bit, but it isn't overwhelming. Just not hidden as much as some other commerical quads."
"I've had this one on draft at Cheeky Monk in downtown Denver, and it feels like a totally different beer. This is strangely clear and overwhelmingly sweet, and while I can taste similarities, I am wondering why this one ends up so much different from the draft variety. The body is also noticeably lighter in body. I'll definitely aim for draft from here on out, as the bottle is surprisingly disappointing."
"Reddish enough blood. Nose of candied red fruit. Mouth slightly sweet, resinous and especially good fruity reminiscent of the fruit liqueur and more particularly to the liqueur grenadine. The taste of red fruit is very present. The presence of alcohol is moderate, making the draft more or less easy to drink. This coupled with a pleasant taste and gentle enough to give a good quality beer."
"Decent ale, but not my favorite in the trappist ale lines."
"drinkability is good - i enjoyed this beer more then the aged bernardus 12"
"D: Although the alcohol isn't as upfront as with other quads, it is still there and along with the heavy, layered flavor this is not the most drinkable of beers. Delicious, but one, maybe two, is my limit."
"Drink is good not exceptionally drinkable but I could have a couple more. Not a bad tasting beer at all.I was very surprised."
"OK, but I had higher hopes."
"All around enjoyable beer. On-tap, this was my first ever Quad and I immediately fell in love. Out of the bottle, it still stands up. One of, if not, the best Quad I've ever had."
"D - very nice and interesting, sweetness seemed over the top initially but is less obvious later on. Could easily drink again"
"D-- Very boozy, tastes and smells every bit of 10%. Still drinkable though. Not as good as other quads are. A little too sweet and overcarbonated. Might need to be a bit colder to offset the sugar. Pricewise very drinkable. $19 in Australia for a 4 pack of 10% is a bargain. Will buy again mostly due to price."
"D - Ok but alcohol taste is not masked at all by sweetness so I wouldnt drink too many of these."
"Incredibly enjoyable quad, well crafted and refined. Proof that a beer can be big without having to be overwhelming. Definitely worth revisiting."
"Drinkability - Delicious, but with such a high abv,one is probably enough for me. Side note: Beware not to judge this beer if you have been enjoying a lot of good sweet barleywines lately. I had to fight to get those sweeter, fruitier taste expectations of a barleywine out of my head before rating this. I find a lot of similarities in the two styles, but they shouldn't be judged side by side."
"D: A pretty sessionable quad with no burn. Problem is, that's not at all what I want in a quad."
"Dark yet extremely clear! Nice flavor and especially the scent. I've always read about licorice reviews of beer I tasted but never experienced the licorice flavor until this beer. Really malt filled and really sweet. Bolder than a triple. I would say it tastes most like a mix of a dubbel and tripel. The after taste is plesant with a strong sense of, ""wow I just ate a tullip."" Doesn't have to back down from any of the best Belgian quads."
"Taste...just like the description of aroma. Very flavorful...full of complexity and sweetness. Hands down my 2nd favorite beer! Booze is a little strong, but mixes well with all the flavor!"
"Pours a brownish amber in the glass with a small, but creamy off-white froth with above average lacing. Pronounced aromas of banana, fresh baked bread, green apple + caramel/toffee (kind of like a candied apple), brown sugar/dark belgian candy sugar, subtle cinnamon, hints of lemon-lime citrus, vanilla, soft honey, light alcohol, figs/dates/raisins....the more i go back to this beer, the more I pick up. Very complex. Then nose is one of the prettiest bouquets that I've encountered in awhile. Full mouthfeel, creamy carbonation, wonderful complexity (everything found on the nose follows through on the palate), there is a dryness to this beer, but also a balanced sweetness, long finish, and hints of sweet alcohol on the finish. Overall, a sensational/highly recommended beer."
" malty caramel and floral aroma with a presence of alcohol, dark reddish brown color light tan head,heavy cloying sweetness again with an alcohol presence, full body, smooth, lively carbonation,"
"Good example of the style overall, yet nothing to write home about."
"D: A very easy drinking quad but not near as much complexity as you'd expect for the style."
"D: Its balance and sweetness make it very easy to drink, though it's complex enough (and high enough ABV) that it should really be sipped slowly."
"Bottle at Chaucer's Pub- Brown liquid sits beneath a foamy off white cloud. Good lace throughout. Nose is very fruity. Dark fruit like plum, some fig, raisin. Lots of bubblegum esters and also quite yeasty and spicy. Sweet dark fruit flavour profile consists of fig, prune, red cherries. There's lots of spiciness and yeasty flavours with rye bread and some caramel. Excellent creamy finish with lingering bitterness and dried fruit flavours. Certainly a sipper. A good choice for #1200."
"Overall this was a very good quad however it was lacking a bit in viscosity and oomph. Still, even a non-stellar Trappist beer is near the top of the heap when compared to the masses and this is no exception. Worth a shot."
"If it wasn't at 10% abv, I could drink these all night long!"
"D - Good but higher ABV. Split one or have just one."
"Notes: In the top 10 for style."
"A very good, widely available quad, that clearly cellars well. Winner."
"Although the booze is evident, it's nowhere near 10.0%abv evident. The nice balance of flavors and smooth drinking make this one a real drinkable brew."
"D-Flavourful, smooth, spicy....very tasty. Not to sweet nor too spicy with the alcohol well hidden. Nicely done!"
"I found this beer to be more drinkable than most quads. Not necessarily better, but more drinkable."
"In one of the better ideas I've had i a while, I uncorked this one over the sink. It's a gusher, that's for sure. Pours a clear coppery-amber, lighter and clearer than expected, with quite a bit of surfacing carbonation. Big head, but not terrible long lasting for the style, and lacing is good but not fabulous. Nose is powerful, but not all that complex. Dark fruits and molasses, nice spicy notes. Pepper and clove. It's inviting, certainly, but not staggering. Given that, the flavour comes as a letdown, but not so much as it might have been. Alcohol is a bit overpowering, with the spices bold as well. Fruitiness recedes, and everything else is lost. The hot alcohol burn lasts longer in the pack of my throat than the flavour linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is watery and overcarbonated, though drinkability remains high. A disappointment from my first beer from this brewery. I'm an unabashed fan of most Belgian styles, and was excited to try a new trappist, but perhaps crossing the border robbed this guy of his mojo. In any case, this Dutch cousin can't compare to the best of the Belgian quads."
"D - This is one of those beers that you have to spend some time drinking a sipping beer for sure a good good quad thats worth trying"
"D. Complex, but yet very smooth and easy to drink for a beer of this style. It might lack some of the complexity of the very best quads, but it is a very good beer."
"D-Good, in that it is complex and enjoyable to imbibe. It's weighty body and huge flavors could be perceived as decreasing a sense of drinkability."
"Overall: Fantastic beer, the best of the La Trappe brewery. Full of easy definable flavors. Fresh, maybe not as good as Rochefort 10 and Sint Bernadus ABT, but at the Kulminator in Antwerpen, I had a 1996 vintage, which after the Westvleteren 12 (1998 vintage) was the best beer I ever had! So be patient, and store some in the cellar to fully enjoy the potential of this beer! Highly recommendable!"
"Certainly not the best of the trappists or even among the best of the quads but not a bad fall type brew. Earthy, light yet warming. Nice."
"Drinkability - Due to the hearty nature of Quad's like this, this is a great sipping brew. But the high ABV means that one or two large bottles is probably plenty for a session. Overall, one of the best Belgian Quad's I've tasted. Perfect for a cold winter night in front of the fire."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Soft and mellow, easily rolling in the mouth. The flavors perform well in the gentle effervescence. An easy drinker, with the alcohol laying low in the flavor profile but sending the brain a message to take in slow and steady."
"This one's plenty drinkabkle and can only really be held down by the ABV and one's personal tolerance for the sweet, boozy style this one captures well."
"Very tasty brew, a good beer to sit and sip. Probably not one to pound all night due to 10% alc. by. vol. rating."
"Overall a solid beer, and a gumtingler, but I'd go after a few other quads before this one."
"Had on tap. Dark color with a very healthy head that stuck around. The beer had some fruity tastes, alcohol, and a little bit too much sweetness for me. Not a ton of carbonation, and feels really nice and smooth. Needs to be drank slowly, but a good beer."
"D - a bit too sweet, but makes a good sipping beer"
"This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but trying the Dubbel, Tripel and Quad together, I'm highly confused about the Quad's significantly higher ratings. True, it's a bit better. The flavor is fuller, the malt is richer and the beer is a bit more warming, but the flavor profile is in line with the rest of the lineup with the smaller beers. I'm even lowering the rating a bit in deference to style comparisons. On a flat rating scale, this would be more highly rated than the Tripel or the Dubbel. At any rate, the Quad pours a deep medium red. It's translucent with amber highlight at certain angles. It's actually less murky than the Tripel (maybe a function of the pour). There's a bit more lacing, though. The aroma has more banana bread and clove than I noticed in the previous Koningshoeven beers. There are also aromas of vanilla, brandy and apricots/plums. The flavor is similar with peppery spicing. I'm again impressed at the depth of flavor these Trappist brewers are able to get out of such simple ingredients. It's one hell of a strain of a yeast that can impart this depth of flavor. If not for style comparisons, I'd bump up my ratings in every category."
"This is fairly simple quad and can't compete with big boy quads, but it is surprinsgly drinkable."
"D: Great beer. This one is in leaugue with Rochefort and St. Bernardus in my humble opinion. I heard that it also ages very well, so I stocked some bottles of it. I will tell you in 5 years... unless I manage to convince RvDoorn to come up with one of his secret treasure...."
"Good overall, with the main detractor being the hot and boozy character, which can be distracting. This doesn't seem to have the complexity of other Trappists, and suffers a bit from a slightly cloying sweetness--a bit malt-bombish. Definitely not my favorite of the quads, and probably not worth seeking out again specifically. Worth seeing what happens with some age, if the alcohol cools down."
"this is one beer that you definitely want to age."
"Medium bodied with a pretty smooth mouthfeel. This was somewhat hard for me to rate. When it comes to trappist ales I've experienced, they all tend to come across as very complex. I gave this a high drinkability rating because it really is good, its just that compared to what I've come to expect from other Trappist ales, it is not great or incredibly complex. Still this was enjoyable for the most part and I'm glad I tried it."
"D: Drinkability was mixed, decent flavor over all but really nothing exciting nor complex. Very boozy which makes this a long and drawn out sipper. The mouthful was the highlight here and the sense was better being contained rather consumed. Decent but somehow I was expecting more from a brewery with a trappist label."
"A tasty beer, and one I would like to drink more of. It seems like there may be more going on than my palate is aware of, but alas, my palate only develops so fast. Perhaps I'll review it again at a later date. Cheers."
"Taste is bit on the sweet side and I suspect this bottle could use some mellowing time (best til 12/2012). Some cherry and honey notes shine through. Otherwise, its tame and smooth. Not what I was looking for."
"Notes: I was really under-whelmed by this beer. It tasted fine but it lacked the complexity and body of other Quadruples I have tried."
"D: Very drinkable due to its balance. Clean and tasty yet strong."
"D: Very drinkable despite the alcohol content. Deceptively so..."
"On tap at the Sierra Grille in Northampton, MA. Pours a dark caramel with decent lacing despite high abv. Smell is sweet delicious caramel..a malt bomb. Taste is sweet, rich, smooth, cotton candy anyone? Smoothness on the palate. Is this really a 10 abv. Like fine aged whiskey...smooth! Ditto on the drinkability....Could have had many more..but....I like to walk out the door."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. The world's greatest quadrupel? Heck no! A decent, okay-inducing quad? Sure."
"This is my first La Trappe brew, and I felt this quad was underwhelming for a trappist product. However, it did the trick with an artisan chicken and apple sausage with Belgian fries."
"Overall a very good beer. Made me change my ideas about Dutch beers. Before I drank this one I thought that every Dutchman trying to brew should be trialed and jailed."
"Overall, this is a good beer and fairly easy to drink. However, there are areas of improvement when it comes to comparisons to the best in the style. It is quite drinkable though and the way it leaves you mouth, it wouldn't be that hard to have another."
"This is a good representation of the style however it falls short of the big names like Rochefort and Westvleteren et al"
"D: Too drinkable. Its great, and I'll have it again, but its 10% and gone in minutes."
"Bottle. Pours a semi-translucent brown with a small tan head. Aroma of raisins, molasses, and sugary sweet malt. Flavor of raisins, sweet dark fruits, apple juice, sweet malt, and bready malt. Very sweet A bit hard to drink and not even close to the complexity of the other Belgian quads."
"This is an ok beer, but compared to quads like Rochefort and Westvleteren, I think the brewery missed a chance to make this more interesting and complex."
"I'd try it again purely cos I did notice a lot of potential and possibly I got a bad bottle or a bad batch or my palate was not in the right condition. I've seen a few other reviews mention the over powering booze though."
"Notes - The beer had a heavy mouthfeel that wasn't too bad. I've had this beer before on tap and though it was awhile ago I didn't expect this bottle to be this disappointing. I usually love a good quad but I can't say this particular one was well received."
"Overall good. Affordable for a trappist. A decent quad, but not my favorite by far."
"I highly prefer the bottle as I always do with anything Belgian, but this one differs the most from its bottle counterpart that I can think of."
"OVERALL: Quite a good brew for sure. Drinkable and enjoyable, a much better effort than their double and triple. This is one I'd have again for sure. Recommended."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours a very dark amber with a medium tan head that degenerates to wisps. No sediment. Smells boozy, raisiny, and really sugary. Tastes roasty, with some chocolate; weird prune character. Lots of alcohol burn. Medium bodied with high carbonation for the style and a warming (hot) finish. Almost a chore to down. As an aside, these notes are from a blind tasting with Westvleteren 12 and St. Bernardus 12. This was far and away the loser."
"This beer pours a lighter brown color with a non-existent head. Sediment also non-existent. This has a very sweet boozy smell-very much like whiskey. Nothing else to report in the smell, which is sad because it could be much more complex considering the style. Others can hide the alcohol pretty well. The taste is really nothing but sugar and alcohol as well. The alcohol blends in a bit better in the taste, but not much. A slight hint of citrus fruits can be sensed in the taste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the carbonation is about right. Compared to the St. Bernardus and Westvleteren, this is much less drinkable. The alcohol is not masked well, and the beer is overwhelmingly sweet. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is better for the money in my opinion."
"Notes: Great beer!!"
"My hats off to Koningshoeven. I am frankly shocked at how good this beer is. I was expecting much less. This is one delicious Quad. It's not perfect and could use a more accurate nose. But, I swear, I'm picking on it. There's a ton of deep flavor and character here. Much, much to love. It's not quite as artful as the world's finest Quads, but it's not far off. I truly feel that the score here will not reflect how good it really is. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability:this is a good/great quad one of the best out there ,smooth and strong you can`t go wrong with this beer ."
"A nice quad, and considering the price one to keep in mind when in the mood for what is usually an expensive beverage. Not a Westy but in the vein and it wont break the bank. This bottle was one of two that I bought and the first one was flat and the cork was dry. I may have to revisit this one as the cork was dry but the brew was not flat. It may have suffered nonetheless. Stay tuned for a re- review"
"Drinkability: While I'm enjoying this a sip at a time I don't find here the depth and complexity of something like the Rochefort 10. Eventually the sweetness becomes cloying and I find myself sipping water to rinse the mouth. I'll be having and enjoying another of these. But with a 10% ABV it will be only one an evening."
"D:overall it was a very drinkable beer; however there are better quads for the money in my opinion and I will be sticking to those"
"Overall- Great beer, in my top 5. I would drink this over many other beers given the oppurtunity. Very clean, subtle and balanced."
"Overall, a good beer. I don't think it stands up to Rochefort, Westy or Bernadrus, but a good beer nonetheless."
"A bit of a candy-like Quad. A little bit thinner than usual, with a good bit of carbonation. Very enjoyable, and watch out for the alcohol. Recommended."
"Comment I've not had very many of this style but in my opinion this one is a little on the strong alcohol tasting side. I do like a strong alcohol taste but not really in my beer."
"bangin, son"
"Pours brown in color with a nice inch of head. Not as dark as my favorite quads, but stll smells good nonetheless. Taste is dark fruits, plum, and just a hint of what I'm wanting to call cola or root beer. Good amount of carbonation and decent mouthfeel. This is a good beer, but doesn't compare to a Rochefort 10 or a Pannepot. I'll stick to those."
"Pours a dark orange colored body, with a foamy whitish colored head, big and lasting. Has a very floral, very fruity aroma, with some spices, and some dark fruit. Is very sweet smelling. Has a very fruity taste, with some spices."
"Cracked this on Fat Tuesday at a dinner party with my wife and two of our friends. Poured a dirty amber color into a Duvel goblet with a thin off-white head that frothed to a thin cap and left wispy lacing through the drink. Looked very impressive in my friend's wine glass. Smell was cherries, caramel, malt, a bit of breadiness and alcohol. Mouthfeel was close to perfect for my taste, a good medium-body with perfectly balanced medium carbonation. Taste was nuts, cherries, caramel and apple, very port-like and sweet, with substantial, yet inoffensive, alcohol warmth. This is the first quad I have ever had. It was very robust and flavorful, was very wine-like, went very well with our lemon-glazed roasted chicken and saffron rice dinner. Drinkability is good, I kept wanting more, but it could be difficult to polish off a 750 of this brew by yourself due to ABV. Overall it was a fantastic brew that I look forward to sharing again."
"D - i'd drink it again, but there are plenty of other quads i'd pick before this one. it just wasn't that great and it definitely wasn't worth the price."
"The flavors work really well together, making it seem like someone mixed syrup with some orange rinds and some flowers. If you're looking for a quad that isn't as overly thick as some others tend to be, this is the one. None of the flavors is over powering, and they all seem to blend really well. Absolutely delicious. Highly recommended."
"This beer is very filling, but tasty. I had a hard time finishing the 750, but it was too good not to. I highly recommend."
"With the Belgian Trappiste offerings, I often find it hard to put the taste experience into words, this Dutch is no different, but likely that's because they have several dimensions to them, just the opposite from what the marketing geniuses push successfully on this side of the pond and north of the 49th. Vive le difference, translated into Dutch I guess!"
"For whatever reason (probably because they're Dutch) the monks at the Onze Lieve Vrouw van Koningshoeven monastery don't always get the recognition or credit that their Belgian Benedictine brothers do. If this Quad were any indication, they deserve at least as much, if not more. If you ask me, all Trappist ales are quality, artisinal products with a culturally and historically rich distinction that goes beyond the beer itself - this is no exception."
"D - Light and smooth.. mono tasting I'd guess like that of a wine. Just sweet grapes make this one an easy drinker."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Well balanced carbonation and a high ABV make this a great beer."
"Drinkability: Great for sipping, but becomes a bit overwhelming as you keep drinking it. The alcohol sneaks up on you until you realize that it's hit you very prominently."
"This would be a great session beer if not for the high alcohol content. This quad is perfect for a cold winter night. What an excellent brew!"
"A really approachable Quad, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: While a little thrown off by how clear this beer was, I was impressed by all other aspects. The carbonation is amazing. The way the small, tiny bubbles explode upon contact with all the nucleation points in your mouth is incredible. Who says natural carbonation doesn't have its benefits?"
"Expiration date of 07/08. A little old, but who cares with 10% ABV. Poured from a 750ml bottle, dark amber red with lots of champagne-like carbonation bubbles and a small off-white head and good lacing. Yeasty, apple spice aroma, light notes of chocolate. Taste is very sweet, loads of caramel covered apple, a light bitterness, a bit of earthiness and some light funk. Good play between the carbonation and texture. Alcohol is pretty well masked, tasty. I liked this one better out of the bottle rather than on tap."
"Pours a dark brown amber with a nice head that hangs around for awhile and some pretty nice lacing. Smells complex, as you'd expect from a quad - dried fruits, figs, bready. Definitely a little more fruity than I'm used to in the style. Tastes of dried fruits, a little less bready than I was expecting. The complexity is definitely here, but I don't like this nearly as much as some of the other quads I've sampled. The mouthfeel is creamy and light carbonation, goes down pretty smooth. Very nice beer, if I had to compare it I would to Chimay blue."
"Pours a hazy tea colored amber color with better than a full finger foamy light tan colored collar. The smell is aggressive with hints of alcohol; banana, molasses, caramel and bready. The mouth feel is silky and smooth and tangy with alcohol. This one is a sipper. The flavors, nose and feel compliment each other. Fruity and earthy with a dark fruit after taste. A real nice drinker."
"Pours a dark, translucent, deep copper, slightly reddish, like dark honey. Aroma is fruity, most like cherries, a little sweet with a hint of alcohol. Flavor is fruity and malty, like cherry, crisp with a strong alcohol nip and a sweet hint. Texture is tingly and edgy - a lively drink."
"I could barely finish this big bottle, my stomach had a hard time settling with this, very rich."
"Very nice to see this on tap at the Brick Store Pub, and a quite nice this way. Poured brown with beautiful garnet highlights and a creamy, finely beaded head that leaves some excellent lacing as well. Served in a beautiful Koningshoeven goblet. Smells lightly of banana, cloves, and chicory. The taste is also a bit light and extremely smooth with similar notes as found in the aroma with the addition of some anise. There is a lingering banana note that is pleasant. The mouthfeel is light, creamy, and smooth. Very easy to drink and the alcohol is very well hidden, almost unoticeable."
"Poured into a tulip glass this beer appears a hazy coppery-brown with red highlights and two fingers of foam that linger for a few minutes then settles down to a nice ring around the edge. I pondered over the aroma for several minutes before the first sip. Extraordinary complexity with malt notes of fig, raisin, cherry, red wine, spicy yeast phenols, and floral hops. Flavor is overwhelmingly malty similar to the aroma profile. Hope bitterness is medium to balance all that malt perfectly. Mouthfeel is curious. There's some residual sweetness due to the huge malt, but not cloying, and it finishes semi-dry making this an extremely well-attenuated beer. Carbonation is medium and cleanses my palate delicately. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Exquisite."
"D- Definitely a good night-cap beer. Will definitely looks for this again."
"Big ""Q" label, cellared for over a year. Bottle opens with a pop, pours a jeweled red-orange into a Westmalle goblet at 60Âº. Racing trails of carbonation can be seen in the center. After a sip the foam breaks and slowly ebbs away at one side. Slight musty cork aroma, with sweet brown sugar and caramel notes. Dried fruit flavors of raisin, dates, and prune blend with a sweet nutty almond finish and a vague touch of spice. Slight stickiness on the lips, and there is some minor earthy tobacco in the aftertaste. The feel is full and velvety, true trappist style. Not sure if it was aged too long or long enough, but the alcohol thankfully wasn't noticeable. Slighty more enjoyable fresh on tap (4.2)."
"D: More than worthy of the price it bears compared to others but not quite deserving of the upper echelon. I had this after some other stronger beers and this tasted more mild than any of those- incredibly well hidden."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fairly heavy carbonation"
"I'll be back..."
"$10.29 at a local liquor store tonight."
"Juding by the aroma I didn't think this would be that great but on the first sip I was shocked at how delicious this was. Definitely worth the $11 for the 750."
"For a 10.00% ABV, this is high drinkable--very delicious, smooth and, despite the boozy nose, not a boozy-tasting beer in the slightest. To me, this easily ranks in my top Quads with Three Philosophers and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 as the best I've ever had. Nothing short of outstanding, Koningshoeven has created a masterpiece, its best offering in my humble opinion. Do not pass this by."
"Drinkability is medium, I probably wouldn't be able to do more than one of these and would just go to another quad if I could."
"This is an incredible Quad, dangerously quaffable for 10% and full of complexity. Seek this out."
"The subtle variations achieved by true Trappist breweries continues to astound. While La Trappe Quad is not as full bodied as Rochefort 10 or as smooth as Chimay Grand Reserve it is certainly the equal to either on any given day. An exceptional beer. One of the best and worst days a beer drinker can have would be sitting in front of all three and trying to decide which one to drink first."
"This is very drinkable. I would make this a session brew if not for the higher abv."
"D - Very drinkable."
"This brew poured into a pint glass has a wonderful light amber color, with a little haziness, and a red tint held to the light. There is a nice clean white head that was frothy and left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was of sweet clove and fig. A nice lingering of banana and some mild yeast are present. The taste is one of the better Quads I have had. The flavor is intense but not over powering and there is little alcohol aftertaste that sometimes overpowers. This also has a strong carbonation that leaves little flavor bursts on the tongue. Very nice brew, I can tell why over 400 BA's review this so well! Thanks Mrs. CDKrenz!"
"(rated Jan 30, 2007)"
"Drinkability: for such a strong beer, La Trappe is remarkably drinkable. Needless to say, two pints knocked me off the face of the earth! I also noticed that, when you want to purchase this at the liquor store, it comes in a 750ml bottle. At 10% ABV, that's the same as drinking a bottle of wine. So in future I'll probably limit myself to one serving (330ml) for an evening."
"I find this to be one of the world's greats."
"Pours an amber/ chestnut brown with thick, foamy yellowish beige head. Aroma of plum, raisin, fig, chocolate, roasted malt and strong alohol. Sweet up front with taste of dark berries, chocolate and a strong maltiness foloowed by a dry sweet alcohol finish. Very Good!"
"D= This was a very drinkable ale, albeit a bit boozy and alcohol-laden. The last of the Trappists for me to try, but I have to say it is one of the best. I should have tried this years ago!"
"D: I could easily turn this bomber up and drink the whole thing straight down, it is THAT GOOD, it's the perfect balance of everything...and it's refreshing, nothing heavy about this at all. Outside of the price, this is perfection....divine."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottled, under the Koningshoeven name. Haven't seen the quad in a few years. Anywho, pours a hazy light chocolate brown color with a small and tight beige colored head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is fruity, with red wine like characteristics with a musty malt and candi sugar notes. Big bold musty flavor, red wine mixes with the dark candi sugar resulting in a strong raisin flavor, some fig and honey, rust, and just a barely there chocolate malt. La Trappe really brings out the musty flavors in their brews, much more so than the other trappist breweries. The brew sits well on the palate with fizzy carbonation, fairly crisp, sweet throughout. Despite the 10%abv drinks fairly well. Probably less malty than other quads but plenty fruity."
"Better to savor Chteau Lafite Rothschild Pauillac than puke on the MD 20/20...eh?>"
"D - being a quad, it is naturally very rich and a sipper. It is not one to have a lot of in one sitting, but rather one to enjoy. This is very drinkable and by the end of the bottle I wish I had more. Glad to try this one, this is my first Trappist ale."
"Pours brown with raspberry hues and is topped with a two-finger thick tan head that darkens at the edges and sticks to the glass for dear life, slowly fading, and leaving a thin but consistent lacing around the glass. Smells complex as expected with dark chocolates up front followed by a quick fruit burst and some phenolic notes. Tastes rich and hot with spice, dark chocolates and cherries noticed at first. In the background is some grain, some breadiness and a nice hint of hop bitterness. Mouth-feel is full-bodied with some stickiness is left on the lips. A quick shake results in a burst of quickly settling carbonation bubbles. This is as real as it gets."
"D: I would have to call this one of the gold standars of the style. A truly wonderful multifacted drinking experience. You won't need anything else for the evening after putting this one in your stomach. Between the flavor and the ABV, ride out the joy."
"Extremely drinkable 10% abv beer. Very good beer."
"Overall, this is a decent beer but not particularly drinkable. Quite sweet and lacking in flavor profile for the style. One was plenty. There are better quads out there, for sure."
"The mouthfeel was out of this world. Everything else was not impressive."
"Overall, a nice beer. I wasnt too big on this brewery despite it being trappist, but i like this one."
"Definately drinkable, nice well balanced beer that hides the abv very well"
"D: This beer is incredibly drinkable, if not a tad sweet. Unlike many ales with double-digit ABV's, this one lacks the bite thus making for a very enjoyable beverage. Probably the best quad I've ever had."
"D - Very drinkable. Slight alcohol only serves as a general warning on this bad boy."
"I enjoyed this beer. It was different from other quads I've tried. I did find it a bit sweet for my tastes...in fact cloying at times...but aside from that I thought it was well-constructed."
"Notes: Session beer. I can only have one of these. Also: much like my personal experience with Rochefort, the middle strength version of Koningshoven (the triple) and Rochefort (8) were my favorite. The stronger versions of both of these (this quad and Rochefort 10) were, to me, too strong. In both cases they upset the wonderful balance of their less strong bretheren. Koningshoven Quad is an excellent beer, I am only indicating that I prefer the tripel."
"Taste is damn strong but maybe that's just because I was going on a relatively empty stomach and the Quad was my first beer. The alcohol is definitely in your face with this one, but after the initial shock, the true flavors come through (Tasty!). Rich caramel malts and sweetness, some tartness. An initial bitterness became tame as the drink progressed. Very dark fruity flavors. A sipper for sure, given the assertive alcohol on this one. Mouthfeel was too fizzy for me. Overall a rare and interesting brew."
"D: This is a great beer and a very good quad. It's a little light to be world class, but I could drink it all night long."
"Beer was served a bit too chilled I felt - which took down the overall experience. I feel I need to give this another tasting, as the potential is there for this to be a fantastic quad."
"D: Very drinkable, high ABV not very apparent. This is a beer that I will be definitely having again."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Flavors are great, and although the alcohol is high it fits in well with this brew. It is certainly a really nice quad."
"Enjoyable beer for 10%!"
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. It just coats the mouth with its creamy texture. Really can't go wrong with a Trappist."
"Almost a mulled wine in texture & flavour. Nice winter sipper"
"Dark amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is alcohol and fruit.Taste is warm vanilla oak and fruit.The taste reminds me of the sherry you would add to snapper soup.It is pricey but if you have the extra cash it is definetly worth a try!!"
"D- A very solid and special brew. Maybe one for a special occasion. Went down easy."
"Poured into tulip glass for a seethru autumn leave body with a booming, soapy head that stuck around a while. Some minor citric hops in there, especially orange, plus some figs, cherries, bread and roasted malts with caramel and toffee along with some dark fruits all combined in a very potent smell. This beer is full-bodied and mixed very well. You'll get not only a good malt bite like caramel, coffee, maybe some chocolate along with figs and some pepper spice but also a minor, cloying hop bite on the end, although it does go down smooth with a little alcohol warming on the end (plus it is sticky on the sides). A tad pricey and ABV limits sessionability, but this was still a great quad to try."
"Pours a beautiful rich dark copper/amberish color with lots of floaties. A thick almond head rises up and stands at full attention deflating at a snails pace leaving behind some thin thready lace that hangs for a minute or two before disappearing. I smell strawberry and alcohol upfront some yeast and damp dirty dungeon aromas as well(I'm using my imagination a little,I love it!!). Dark fruit flavors prunes and rasins mostly,lots of spicy yeastiness on the tail end. A tangy bite on the tounge keeps this Quad rollin strong,clean soft finish with plenty of alcohol warmth to spare. This lil bottle is what great beer is all about."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & ABV, a good take on the style"
"D - At 10% ABV, it's nothing to take too lightly. Better have a meal under your belt, first!"
"M/D - Full body and medium to high carbonation. Feels good and easy going down."
"Poured into a snifter, it has a beautiful dark amber body with just a bit of yeast in it and is covered by an off white head that's starts off about two fingers thick and then thins out into a thin layer of bubbles, and has some very good lacing to it. It has a slightly dry alcohol aroma followed by some floral smells and a bit of rum as well, it smells sweet over all. It has a nice clean, semi-crisp, feel to it with a medium-to-light body; the carbonation really hits your tongue, you can barley taste the alcohol in it and it is quit smooth. There are some faint malts flavors, some raisin flavors as well, it has a dry aftertaste that's really warms up your mouth."
"This is clearly a sipping brew. It had a rather reddish color to it and smelled mildly yeastly. There was a rich maltiness to it, but was not at all cloying. It appeared to have a nice balance to it and was not overpowering. But again, I found myself taking only small sips of this intense quad!"
"D- Didnt come off as anything unusual or exciting. i enjoyed it, but not enough to look for it again anytime soon. finishing the bottle was easy enough."
"Poured from bottle to Chimay chalice. Pours amber red, almost mahogany. Nice thick off-white head with good retention and lacing. This is a great looking beer! Smell is good, pretty much what I'd expect for the styles. Some yeast, bread, alcohol and dark fruits...almost like a fruity red wine. Taste didnt do it for me though. It wasnt horrible, just something seemed off. I think the yeast was a little too pronounced and it had a stronger than expected biscuit flavor. The alcohol isnt very hidden either, very noticeable. Mouthfeel was on par, carbonation was perfect. Overall a very drinkable beer, just something seemed off on the taste."
"I really enjoyed this quad. I am a fan of the style and will continue to buy it with this one in the top five. It is hard to come by around here but worth the trip if you find it."
"Overall - Not my favourite Quadrupel, but very good."
"At first glance this beer is very pretty in the glass dark ruby . It looks absolutely amazing almost undrinkable when the light catches it. What a nice ruby color!!! Generated a very nice head with tight bubbles of an off-white hue. Aroma was complex with red wine esters, bannana-like yeast, alchohol and spice. Very smooth and warming flavor. Great bitterness to balance the sugary sweetness of the beer. Each taste brought forth new impressions and flavors. The alchohol was not overpowering but quite balanced with sweetness and bitterness. Can't wait for another one of these!"
"Orange color with a small foam. Aroma shows a touch of bubble gum and light fruits. Powerful flavors of raisins, rum soaked dark fruits, honey, doughy, pastry-like malts, with lots of belgian character. Very boozy, but well balaced and fairly complex. Hmm, nice tasting, but the aroma and appearence leave a lot to be desired. This is a fresh batch and not my favorite. The last batch I sold (which I have several bottles aging) was amazing. This is a nice beer, but not a batch I'll be collecting."
"I really didn't like this beer when I first bought it last year. But after letting it sit for a while, it's much better."
"The taste starts boozey, syrupy, caramel, and honey sweetness overipened plums, figs, dates, pure goodness. There is a faint spicy alcohol burn in the finish but I keep being drawn back to that fruity, overipened deliciousness. This is a fantastic quad a sipper def will be buying a few bottles of this baby for aging and now."
"Drinkability: A nice, suprisingly dry fruity finish with a minute plus linger. A true sip and savor masterpiece."
"Lower carbonation and a sticky, chewy mouthfeel work pretty well here. Overall it was a little less complex than expected, but it was good. Won't replace my St. Bernardus though."
"D- Well this might just be a once in a lifetime beer for me but this one was verry drinkable."
"D - The malt character is nice and complex, but I would like it to be a bit darker with some more intense yeast character. Reasonably drinkable for a beer of this weight."
"D - This is a very good Quad. It's worth the price."
"This trappist ale pours a mahogany color with a creamy beige head. The nose has bready malts, tropical fruits and spicy yeast. The taste is nicely balanced. A sweet malt and fruit presence is compimented by Belgian herbs. Delicious. A silky body goes down very well. A fantastic Belgian style quadruple from our friends in the Netherlands."
"My first Quadrupel. I did not know what to expect, but this is an exceptional beer. Something that I will enjoy. Though, to fully appreciate this, I need to be more familiar with the style."
"Watching the Red Sox game with some Trappist product...does not get a whole lot better than that. Koningshoeven Quad pours a light brown/ruby color, with a nicely sized white crown. Aroma revelas a mix of dark fruit (fig, strawberry and date), with some mild spice. Taste is very similar to the smell, but comes to life moreso with the carbonation, giving it a slightly metallic taste in the finish. Alcohol can be noticed in the taste, but it isn't too hot. Body is pretty light for a Quad, which is a nice change from some others I have had recently. So far this one glass is going down very easily, so I'm sure it won't be too difficult to finish off the bottle. Another beautiful, graceful Belgian Trappist beer. Some of Koningshoeven's brews, including this, have scored very high with my friends and I in blind Trappist tastings, even beating Westvleteren in a couple of cases. Cheers"
"Overall - This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart. One must truly be able to appreciate a good belgian ale to find love in this beer. My gf tried it and was not a fan... more for me! Excellently balanced in taste and texture with a light alcoholic kick. This is a great beer for an after-dinner conversation. Well worth every penny and disappears way too quickly."
"I tried this on draught on April 11, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a dark reddish brown with a thick, long lasting white head. The aroma was thick with yeast and some sweet caramel malt. The mouthfeel was thick, creamy, and mildly carbonated. The flavour was brown sugar sweet, with some yeasty hints. Not quite as sickly sweet as a Samichlaus of Hardy's."
"Pours a deep and clear orangish brown with a decent amount of creamy tan head that fades away fairly quickly, leaving a thin layer on top. Smells of yeast, raisins, cinnamon?, nutmeg?, orange, flowers.. Very complex, and very pleasant. The taste is also very complex and pleasant. It's very sweet, as it should be, and there's chocolate, raisins, some citrus, nuts, and the ethereal alcohol flavor you only really get from belgian style ales. Mouthfeel is very heavy and creamy. Overall, it's very drinkable for a quadrupel. Not something you can drink all day, but for a special occasion, it's an awesome beer."
"Drinkability: Sure.... go for it. Good Trappist product.... support them monks!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, very smooth and creamy. This is a damn fine beer, a slow drinker for sure but I looked forward to every sip."
"Overall, this definately makes it in my top 10. The Dutch trappists know their stuff! You do need a sweet tooth for this one. In my case, it left me highly satisfied and despite it's price, I will definately have it again."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Yeti snifter. This is lighter in color than the dubbel, more red than brown. It smells like sweet fruits and sugar. The taste is also heavy syrupy, sugary, fruit, good but heavy. This is quite flavorful and delicious but a definite sipper."
"D = Good drinkability, would make an excellent night cap."
"D- high abv, intense flavor, $$$, i love it but it's a special treat! so i treat it like one."
"D: Slightly drinkable to moderate drinkability because of the sweet taste and alcohol."
"D: I didn't get much from this Quad except a good buzz, but I would try it again if only to see how the flavor changes from bottle to bottle or batch to batch. I enjoyed La Trappe's Dubbel far more than this Quad."
"Drinkability was great at first, but sweetness gets a touch tiresome as the bottle empties. Very good though, and I will definitely try again."
"D - Not so good. Could barely finish the half-pint it was so strong."
"This poured a hazy light brown with light tan head. It had a barely noticeable, mild malt scent. It tasted like roasted wheat and malt with a nice hops bitterness and slight alcohol burn. It was pretty thick with no carbonation, and had a strong sweet and bitter aftertaste. Overall this was actually the easiest Koningshoeven to drink, and it was definitely my favorite of the trio. Even still, this wasn't that spectacular."
"At 10%, its no wonder."
"D-Interesting bottle that changes as it warms. Enjoyed sipping this one as the complexity and smoothness are more aparent as it warms but didn't think it was spectacular. Would drink again but wouldn't seek it out."
"definitely a great beer"
"L'aspect trÃ¨s intense de la biÃ¨re diminue un peu son score de ""drinkability", mais ce n'est pas pour autant un dÃ©faut... on est ainsi portÃ©s Ã  rallentir notre consommation!"
"D: Another nice offering from our wonderful friends the Trappist Monks. I would easily raise more than one glass of this quad in their honor."
"Poured into a chalice a beautiful golden amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy tan head, a few nice small islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, some bannanas, cheeries, and caramel. The taste is great, malty, slight sweetness, yeasty, a nice tone of banannas/cherries, and caramel. Full/Med body, complex brew. Very drinkable, a true gem, highly recommended. Thanks Toby for this extra."
"D - I could drink this all night. Fortunately at 10% I don't have any more right now!"
"This has to be one of the best-if not THE best-Belgian quads I've tasted."
"D - Bitchin beer. This is an edit of a 3.10.2008 tasting that I didn't really like. This one is much better on 10.4.11.."
"Really excellent candi sugar, malty, root beer and cola aromas, hints of peachy fruit. Mouthfeel is creamy with active soft carbonation, the alcohol brings a spicy warmth that complements the flavors and aromas. Taste really brings it here...a crisp, sweet/tart balanced, excellent slightly bitter finish. The peach, cola, and birch beer spices comprise the flavors. A brew that grows on you...it is a lighter quad than other Trappist ales. Will happily enjoy this again."
"D: This beer is a hefty one and truly something special. I don't see myslef drinking more than one of these at a time. However, it's so delicious that I will take my time with it any day. such a wonderful bouquet of fruity aromas and flavours and an incredible warming sensation. I just finished a paper for school and, I must day, this makes for the perfect night cap. I will most definitely buy this beer again."
"Drinkability is fair, surprisingly pear-dominated quad, the alcohol is well-masked, quite light and fruity for the style"
"D: If the ABV wasn't 10% I would happily enjoy multiple! Fantastic Trappist (and it's not even from Belgium!)"
"Cheers!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep amber, almost brown in color with a thick, pillowy, off-white head. The smell is malty sweet, green apple and spicey phenols are present. The taste is similar - spicy, malty sweet and a slight alcohol bite when you swallow. The mouthfeel is fairly light with a foamy carbonation and a dry finish. Given that this beer has 10% ABV, it is very drinkable. Although the alcohol is perceivable, it by no means dominates the palate making this a smooth drinker. I think I prefer their tripel though."
"Rerate in Houston,about 3-4 months later...orange rust colour...sweet fruit candi smell,great lacing of course...amazingly smooth for the 10%...and also very tasty, like a bitter piece of melon carameled brandy raisin snap. again, very very good, the taste is like a ...secret spicy kiss from the girl next door....wicked!!!....this is what all Trappist beers should do to you..!!!"
"Its an alright Quadrupel not one of the best but drinkable"
"Drinkability/overall: a crisp...gasp...refreshing quad. A refined, distilled Bernie's 12. A sublime Trappist without the musty, dusty , ""old-ness"" I've come to expect."
"Overall, I liked this a lot. And it was interesting to see how the lone Dutch Trappist differs from the Belgians. To me it didn't have the same candy-sugar qualities, which isn't a compliment or a criticism -- just an observation. This is a pretty damn good beer, though I'll still go for a St. Bernardus 12 if it's available instead (and it usually is)."
"This beer is rich. There are some heavy flavors and a high ABV that all mixes well. I am new to the Quadruple/Belgian styles and I am enjoying them."
"The taste is very warming with plum, caramel, dark cherry and malt. Very nice. The finish is very intense like figs or plum. This is a fine example of the quadrupels."
"Really quite enjoyable, and the only La Trappe brew I'd make a point of buying again."
"Could almost make a man religious...."
"Copped a single, 11.2 oz bottle from Total Wine and More in Union... Pours a dark-brown, mahogany hue with an impressive, lingering foamy and frothy head that exhibited some staying power... smell is powerful and rich, with fruits, caramel, citrus, and strong sugars pouring through and very noticeable... taste strongly complements the aroma, with a definite caramel and dark-brown sugar essence... this beer is very sweet for a quadruple, and the 10% ABV is noticeable behind ultra-rich, very sweet, and super-thick flavors... a good depiction of the style... I was really impressed by the appearance and aroma of this one... good stuff... A nice representation of the style, although very sweet and full-flavored... Recommended..."
"Tastes very much like it smells. Loads of tasty, complex yeast, solid fruit malt, and a pleasant alcohol burn."
"It's got serious body and is very warm with alcohol. I'm going to have to lay the rest of this four pack down for a while."
"Overall a very smooth drink and a solid quad."
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours a murky amber/brown color with a small off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is booze (rum), plums, raisins, caramel and sugar. Nice and sweet. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a peppery flavor noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick but not as creamy as I expected it to be. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and not hard to drink. Alcohol is noticable, it has a nice warming effect but it's not overpowering. It's not the best quad I've had, but still a good beer that I'd drink again. A great beer for a cold winter night."
"Overall this is a great beer and the best of its style. Highly recommended and easy to drink, even with the high alcohol level."
"drinkability is great. this is a very well crafted brew with a good breadth of flavors and aromas. excellent quadrupel. cheers!"
"D: I enjoyed this quad, but in the end, there was nothing really special about it to make me come back to it, especially with Rochefort 10 out there."
"The appearance of this beer was light brown color, slightly opaque. It had a strong citrus smell to it, that was pretty nice. The taste was kind of a letdown. While you initially got the apple taste, the alcohol seemed to cut in and take the legs out of the taste. The mouthfeel was a little overly carbonated for my taste. Not a bad beer, drinkable in its way. That being said, as far as quadrupels go, I prefer the St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this."
"D- Not my fav of the evening. I have noted that it felt like heartburn as I was drinking it. Our 13th beer of the night so I am not sure how accurate my notes are."
"D: Excellent beer that is a great for after dinner. Has a lot in common with good fortified wines. Especially good winter sipper. Alcohol is is more present than others in its style but that doesn't bother me."
"Strong aroma of fruit and alcohol. Plums soaked in rum along with some darks sugars. Creamy tan head leaves some nice lace. Hazy dark brown colored beer with a purple hue. Thick creamy mouthfeel coats your tongue with flavors. Sweet flavor is a mix of dark fleshy fruits, roasted malts, and caramelized sugars. The sweetness is balanced by a dose of alcohol. The alcohol fades in the finish and allows the fruity flavors linger. The mouthfeel is a little too thick for me, but otherwise the flavor comes close the amazing aroma."
"An exceptional Quad. What I missed in the smell was made up for with the mouth feel! Very easy to drink, with a nice lacy head all the way to the finish. It was even better as it warmed more towards room temperature. This is a beer I am boing to search out and drink more of! Worthy of sharing with your best friend!"
"Had it bottled a little later in the year and it impressed me as a very good quad."
"Great beer and probably the best of the La Trappe lineup. While this is a great beer, if I'm going to reach for a quad, I'd recommend the St. Bernardus Abt 12 over this one."
"D - A bit less flavorful than some other quads but still good. Not disappointing by any means but I wouldn't buy it again because for the same ~$8 I could get the masterpiece, St. Bernardus 12."
"750ml brown bottle (labeled Konings Hoeven Quadrupel) from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an amber red body thats translucent but slightly hazy with little head to speak of. Smells fruity - apple, grape, citrus. Tastes fruity - apple, grape, citrus - with a fair amount of pith and hints of malt. Some alcohol is noticeable, but not as bad as it could. Surprisingly flat and aqueous in mouthfeel. Somewhat one dimensional. Tasty enough, but not as tasty as some of its Belgian cousins. Not that impressed with this one, I'm afraid..."
"The beer has a dark amber, copper color with modest foam that faded within a few minutes. Wisps of foam remained around the perimeter of the glass throughout. A strong rum and alcohol aroma comes through in the nose along with a sugar sweetness and raisins. The beer is full bodied on the palate. The taste is sweet and alcoholic. The finish is again heavy on the alcohol and warming. This beer is warming and ideal for a cold winters night, however, the drinkability, in my opinion, suffers due to the overt sweetness."
"Not the greatest or most complex quad in the world, but a fine drink all the same. Some other Belgian offerings make this seem quite tame, but few are this drinkable. I would definitely try this again. Competes with the Dubbel and my favourite La Trappe beer."
"I suspect the main problem with this beer is a lack of aging - the 'best before' is more than 18 months away - it should probably be a 'best after' date. I'd love to try an aged bottle to see how it goes but I can't really give a good review to this new bottle I'm drinking."
"Pours a copper color with small yeasty chunks at the bottom, a small tan head. In the aroma, plummish, dark fruit and a nice caramel presence. In the taste, caramel and a nice alcohol presence. A smooth, big bodied mouthfeel and a caramel sweet alcohol aftertaste. Ages great, great flavors of caramel and dark fruit."
"D: based on flavor alone, I could drink this all day. However, it is pretty strong, so I wouldn't. A very good selection that I will revisit consistently in the future."
"Ã  l'ouverture le biÃ¨re dÃ©borda, elle a une belle couleur cuivrÃ©e-orangÃ© lÃ©gÃ¨rement trouble, la mousse est compacte Ã©paisse et durable, le nez est tout en Ã©pices, trÃ¨s invitant et piquant. la bouche est chaleureuse ronde, piquante, Ã©picÃ© Ã  souhait. une grande biÃ¨re."
"This is a quality quad. pours a deep amber, more reddish than most quads, and slighly transparent. The nose is of dark fruit with some clove banana smell and a little alcohol. great head retention, and just enough yeast mixed in. Taste starts off sugary, dark candy like. The finish bites hard and warms to the core, leaving a thin sugary residue on the lips. This is the best quad I have had brewed outside of belgium. The alcohol on the finish is a bit strong, and the thickness isnt quite that of belgian quads, but this is clearly of the same family, and if i didnt read the bottle i would have thought it was belgian. Good choice, my favorite koningshoeven so far."
"The alcohol is a little bit too astringent in this beer and it takes away from the drinkability a little bit."
"I've really enjoyed this brew for years... even back when it was still under the La Trappe moniker... but in the last year Koningshoeven became available again in Boise... and that makes me a very happy beer geek."
"At first when I smelled this it reeked of cheap beer, but after breathing for a bit the real smell of malt, caramel and plum came to light. Alcohol is fairly prominent in the taste, along with candi sugar, pear and more malt. Definitely not my favorite quadrupel but it's not too bad."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and prickly; again not as smooth or drinkable as Rochefort, Chimay, Westvleteren, or St Bernardus."
"this is a really good beer, i wish i wouldn't of ruined it, i i can't imagine what it would of been like normal"
"Poured a 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. I let it warm up for about 30 minutes before I poured it. When it was poured, it looked like sun tea, brown hazy amber. Had a 2 inch head that subsided within seconds of pouring the beer. Aroma is caramel, dark fruits and sugar. Taste is of caramel, fruits and vanilla with a warming brown sugary alcohol at the finish. Mouthfeel is dry and light."
"D: Incredible flavour, but the alcohol is a little much."
"i saved the biggest for last ; pours a clear, deep copper color w/ a fluffy off-white head that lasts a good while, then leaves a thin ring of broken lacing down my glass ; a powerful malty, breadish fruit smell, banana mostly w/ some grape, plum and clove notes as well, a faint caramel and alcoholic aroma present as it warms, kinda burns my eyes when i exhale into my snifter ; a sweet, tart, slightly vinous brandy-like flavor tapering into a hot, fruity, banana, cherry, and caramel midway, finishing up w/ a slightly nutty taste, a faint hop bite and that classic hi-octane ""gasoline"" feel in the back of your throat ; a rich yet delicate mouthfeel, the high carbonation helps keep it from becoming too cloying, another dry beer w/ tons of residual sweetness ; this is a good brew, but at 10 % ABV, one can't drink much of it tho...."
"Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this quadrupel. It seemed rather ""light"" in all aspects (aroma, taste and mouthfeel) and the alcohol presence was quite overwhelming."
"Tastes of sweet and slightly sour fruits, raisin, clove, a chewy malt, a bit of old hops (not in a bad way) and just a hint of that feel good alcohol warmth a big beer like this brings. I was very pleased with this one."
"Drinkability: My least favorite of the Trappists by a big margin; just don't like that cherry flavor"
"I've had better quads, but this is definitely good and well worth trying."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As can be expected, this one definitely warms as it goes down. Full bodied brew with higher levels of carbonation that help to cleanse the alcohol from the palate at the finish of the brew. The beer goes down easy, but I don't think I'd want to sit around and drink this all day. There are just many more to try and many still that are by far better."
"DRINKABILITY: I was very pleased with this brew. It's been a while since I've had a quad, and this one didn't disappoint. Easy to sip on all night."
"Ruby chestnut with thin white head that leaves a thin lace. Smells slightly of sweet cherries with a hint of spice and chocolate. The taste is warm alcholic malt with nice lightly bitter aftertaste that is very smooth and tasty. Full bodied with decent carbonation and a dry, alcoholic finish. Overall, this is a very good beer with excellent flavor and a very smooth finish. I would like to try it again."
"Mouthfeel has the typical tight Belgian carbonation that adds a sense of zest. Quads are never what I would call drinkable, but this one doesn't hide it's abv as well as others. If you enjoy this give Mad Elf a try, but I expect more out of a Belgian Quadrupel."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a tremendous fruity yeast aroma as well as a warm malty scent. It's dry with a slight earthy feel. The warmth seeps through the yeast esters. The taste is good. It has a strong pale and light crystal malt flavor. It goes down easy and finishes dry and warm with a mild yeast fruitiness. The earthiness resinates on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's got a solid malt character as well as finite yeast component."
"Notes: Time to check another Trappist off my list. They hardly ever disappointÂ… Alcohol is very well hidden, and almost unnoticeable until you have had a couple glasses... Very mild flavor, and surprisingly accessible."
"Translated from French to English (14/2/2010)."
"Scores averaged to represent the two very different impressions of this beer. Even if the second bottle was a bad bottle, I don't really see an reason to pick this up over the more widely available and similarly priced Chimay Blue."
"Drinkability- Of the few quad's I've had, this one is about even par. Not really great, but could be. I'll probably pick up another and age one...got it at a steal of $7.99 at Bottle Barn."
"Drinkability - this is merely decent ale, and its high abv limits sessionability."
"highly drinkable beer, jsut not a chugger, savor this one. excellent example of a blegian brew, not the best, but solid as hell."
"Drinkability is very good. Slightly more alcoholic tasting than St. B, but very enjoyable."
"D: I like this one better than many of the other popular and revered quads (Rochefort, St. Bernardus). This one is just allaround more pleasing, especially in taste. The price tag is much nicer too."
"this is 10%? well hidden. so mild. if you handed this beer to me blind i would have called ""dubbel"". i can't decide if that is a good thing. hardly resembles a quad, but it IS super drinkable. superlatively drinkable and hugely (i say, without irony) subtle. lightly sweet, with dark fruit tones and a touch of brown sugar. soft"
"drinkability is ok, it's a real sipper, but it does keep you coming back. solid quad."
"Very smooth, and slight bite at the end. Very drinkable, but at the price I had to slow it down. Could gobble this one up quickly."
"-Oelergud"
"D - This brew screams quite evening by the fire with some chocolate. This is pretty damn complex and very comforting but definitely not a session beer. Enjoy this over the course of an hour after dinner in place of port or scotch. I'm really impressed with this one."
"When poured into the chalice the appearance is dark brown and mahogany . The label is different than the one pictured . Tan leathery head and there is a small proportion of lacing on thee chalice . The smell is sweet / sour , toffee smelling . The taste and the mouthfeel are just bland and the aftertaste is nothing to brag about either . This just was all over the place for me and I did not enjoy it ."
"Drinkability: Moderated by high alcohol and what seems to me an unnecessary tartness."
"forward to trying the other brews by La Trappe. I am rather impressed by the Quad here."
"Overall, A delicious Quad, with a great balance. Not overly sweet, this one has a good bitterness to it. I'm glad I caught this on-tap, as every bottle of this brew I have ever had was not very good. I can see now it was the quality of the bottles and not the beer."
"This beer was the most off style of any of the Belgian beers I have had. It was an amber reddish color, which is much lighter than I expected a Quad to be. The smell is rich and malty with some yeasty funk and probably the best quality of the beer. The flavor is very hot with alcohol which is a big turnoff for me. There are some spicy notes in there as well along with a decent malty background; but the hotness seems to mask the other flavors. It had a medium body but only decent drinkability. Overall, a rather disappointing beer."
":-D"
"D- I'm really not a big fan of this at all. I think the sweetness is almost overwhelming."
"This was a gusher. Pours out a hazed chestnut with a thinnish head that maintains its diminutive size. Leaves some short sheets of lace. This one smells really heavy on the phenols to the point of overkill. Lots of booze in this one too. Underlying aromas of dark malts. Phenols aren't as wild in the flavor, but are still a bit much, I believe. Same with the alcohol. Malt comes out more with grape juice flavors along with apples and pears. Hops are subtle but give this an herbaceous feel. Mouthfeel is kind of light and thin for the size, but the carbonation is just fine: it stimulates the tongue well, but doesn't wild out. I'm not really moved to drink more and more of this. Glad I got a single."
"The drinkability is okay. It's an interesting brew, but not one I would try to session all night even if the ABV were low enough for that. It has some unique qualities compared to other quads and is worth trying."
"While I thought the mouthfeel of this beer was quite good, I was not a huge fan of its sour grape and champagne flavor. It is lightly sweet and tastes a bit like dried fruit, which may have been what bothered me (I'm not a fan). Aroma was a bit of a candied fruit sugariness. I had this beer on draft, and it was not unattractive in its martini-like branded glassware - a hazy red color with a white scummy head of inconsistently sized tiny bubbles. Still, i was not a huge fan of this beer."
"Wonderful trappist beer. Very full flavored and complex. This is a beer I will have again and often."
"Flavor is fruity, raisin, prune, banana with some light caramel notes and warming alcohol."
"Mouth: Extremely sparkly, a bit over carbonated actually, that makes it almost like swallowing a gas as opposed to a liquid. Very fruity, warm, ester-y, chocolate and caramel, a touch of a buttery feel to it. Dark pitted fruits, not overly sweet but touches of prune and raisin. Tobacco notes. Mouthfeel is overly gassy and bloating, hurts the drinkability. The flavor is enjoyable though not overly complex."
"Drinkability. Well, it remains a quad, but it is one of the better quads I have had."
"Now this stuff is pretty good. Pours a muddy golden amber color. Has a lot of botanicals in the smell. Tends to have a sweet, fruitlike taste but not overpowering. Feels like you are drinking velvet -- that's good. Drink it w/ a meal and not by itself."
"Flavor is of sour fruits giving way to subtle hops, with excellent balance. Quite a dry finish. Bitterness becomes more intense as it warms."
"Very tasty treat here. Quite fruity, mildly sweet and dangerously drinkable. This is a winner."
"A fairly smooth easy to drink Quad, nothing spectactular."
"Notes: Not the biggest or the baddest but this is a damn fine quadrupel. If you see it, buy it."
"Excellent. Sweeter than what I usually reach for, but a nice change up. Quite true to style."
"Medium-plus in body, good strength and a great flavor make this brew a more than quaffable ale...high recommendations!"
"La Trappe Quadrupel has surprised the hell out of me. I've always considered tripels and BSDAs to be my favorite Belgian styles, but if I continue to drink outstanding quadrupels, they'll be right up there as well. I'm ecstatic to see how well this beer ages because I plan to stock up the next time I see it on the shelves. Highly recommended."
"I'd never call this a session beer because it'd wreck me. Overall an outstanding quad."
"D- This beer has a big heat and big fizz but not much malt flavors. The sweetness is very present but not as much depth as I was expecting. The yeast helps give the flavor some depth."
"On tap at Ebenezer's Pub, served in a goblet. Dark brown in color, with a medium head. It had a dark fruit aroma, with some degree of maltiness. Dark fruit taste, as well as some sweet malt, almost like cotton candy, and yeast. Very smooth, alcohol not noticeable, which could be a problem if you drank a lot of them."
"11.2fl oz bottle poured into my St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a dark ruby brown color with a large tan head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. The smeel is sweet malt, dark fruits, yeast and a slight metallic note as well. The taste is sweet malt, banana bread and some spices. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy. The alcohol shows a little in the taste which affects the drinability but the brew was extremely enjoyable nonetheless. Overall, this is another great Trappist Quad that is reccomended."
"Mouthfeel isn't as chewy as I might have expected for the ABV, but it sort of works to maintain some drinkability. Still though, it's a 10% ABV Trappist quad, so if you have to ask if it's drinkable, either read more reviews or drink more beer."
"The mouthfeel is quite nice, very light and lively, especially for such a big beer, and you can argue the sacrifice of richness for drinkabilty is a welcome change from the heavier quads. I however, will not! In fact, if it were richer and less cloying, I'd find it more drinkable, regardless of how heavy it might be. All and all, I'd say this is an interesting beer worthy of a thorough investigation, but at the end of the day, for me it was neither my favorite trappist nor quad."
"An interesting brew, that seems somehow to be lacking a little something. I could wish for a bit more chewy malt character and perhaps some more body, but on the other hand it is nice that this is not a super heavy brew. Still it is a good brew, and certainly contributes a nice warm glow after a couple glasses from this 750ml bottle."
"The booze is hidden amazingly well for 10%! Feels nice on the tongue and warm in the throat, but never hot to the nose. Minor qualms with the aroma aside, an excellent drink, if not a little dangerous."
"The pour into my Westvleteren glass raises a noisy two-finger head that visibly surges as it falls, unfortunately quickly. It seems to give up falling while still quite a bit more than a mere surface lacing. Its color is light tan, and it leaves somewhat sticky lacing. The body is a translucent, almost glowing amber with ruby highlights, and a few flecks of sediment floating about. The nose is a bit spicy, and has notes of chocolate, berries, tobacco, and yeast. Fairly straightforward, but welcome. The taste is warm, acidic, and touched with cocoa, and the dark fruitiness mentioned above. Indeed, it seems to be simply a richer reflection of the smell. There's also a bit of a grape flavor that I really appreciate. The burn of alcohol is also noticeable, but not overbearing. The mouth is thinner than I would like, with also too high carbonation. Still, this is a fine quad."
"On tap at ZenoÂ’s, beer Mecca of central PA. Medium ruby-amber with a very small, creamy, off-white head. The smell is fairly mild for the style. Malt, bubble gum and a little alcohol mostly. The taste is much more impressive. Pungent and fruity. Wheat, yeast and honeysuckle to go along with the rich malts and very light hops. Warming alcohol finish with some lingering sweetness. It has a medium-full body, slick texture and low carbonation. DidnÂ’t wow me at first but slowly grew on me. Worth trying."
"This is a luxurious, rich, sipping treat from Belgium."
"I remember this being darker and fuller when it was bottled as La Trappe. Is it me, or my memory. Whatever, it's still good. Damn good!"
"Mouthfeel is slightly sweet up front, mild spices leading to a semi-dry finish. This one on draft blew away any bottled version I've had of this."
"If I didn't live in Alabama, I would have to get another to try to figure this one out. Maybe I was expecting something like a Tripel. That isn't saying this is bad -- far from it. But part of me is reluctant to rate until I've had another."
"Aftertaste sticks around and slowly changes to a cherry bitter/sweet deep malty taste. The burps bring back the sweet and make this a good sipper. Beware... 10% ABV hides somewhere in the nectar of Monks."
"Pours a dark, dark amber color with thin tannish foam that leaves plenty of Brussels lace on the side of the glass. Sweet and fruity in the nose -- notes of tart dates, sour apples, coffee, alcohol and some treacle. On the palate, full and juicy carbonation, light body, present alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The sweetness has a tinge of plastic-ness to it at higher temperatures, just when a quadrupel should be throwing off some really present flavors. Acidic tartness comes out first, then sweetness at the mid-palate, with no drying out toward the finish -- things stay sticky. Overall, this is a good quadrupel, but not, in my opinion, a great one. It doesn't take things enough beyond the dubbel-level in terms of depth and complexity of flavor. It's really just a very alcoholic dubbel, with not enough evolutionary flavor added."
"A masterpiece!"
"Served in a Westmalle chalice at ambient temperature. A medium pour produces a rocky, medium tan head of about two fingers. Plenty of lacing and medium-length duration. Golden-amber in color, with plenty of fine, suspended yeast. Nose is big and expressive, with notes of banana, warming alcohol, and grainy malt. A bit ""rummy"". Big, creamy mouthfeel on the first sip, with a sweet and tangy booziness. Alcohol is warming pretty much from the start, and thereÂ’s some nice carbonation rounding this out. ThereÂ’s a hint of smokey, roasted and dark malts, even though this is pretty light in complexion. Plum and pear make their way up to the nose as I drink, with lighter hints of vanilla and cherry. Light hints of raisin, fig, and prune. Smooth and easy drinking, and while not as Â“thickÂ” as other Trappist Quads, it isnÂ’t thin, either, and exhibits a richness quite unique to itself. Spicy, slightly tingly aftertaste with more roasted malts hanging on for the ride home. Very minimal bitterness, in the range of a Doppelbock, and seemingly no hop presence. Very yeasty, spicy, phenolic, and warming. This is a fresh bottle (by looking at the code) and I know that this brew tends to hold up well given a few years of cellaring. I'm very happy to see this back!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced, hiding its alcohol very well. very drinkable. i think this one would be great to try with some age."
"Thanks to my great son, Â“studyingÂ” overseas in Amsterdam. I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy direct from Belgium."
"From a Koningshoeven label at Coastal Wine Connection beer club. Deep copper-red. Big and sugary with apricot/peach, raisin and moldy fruit, brown sugar, medicine and very much warming from the alcohol aspect. At the end it almost had a green apple tingle. This was a young one, would like to do a vertical tasting of this one. (#2672, 2/1/07)"
"From a 750 ml bottle labeled ""Konings hoeven Quadrupel Trappist Ale.Â” Pours a rich saturated cooperish hue with a slight lingering off-white head consisting of tight bubbles renewed at a brisk pace early in the pour. Fills the mouth with a smooth malty sweetness that flows gently across your mouth. The aroma is surprisingly gentle with a slight hint of sweet, spicy hops. I did expect a bit more carmel flavor from the roasted malts but I as not disappointed in that it had an earthy oak background that complemented the sweetness and spices. It is medium bodied and refreshing that hides the 10% ABV."
"Drinkability: To re-iterate for the third or fourth time, this beer is incredibly balanced. : ) Fruity esters common to the style really are fantastically developed. The banana and plum flavors in this thing are just absolutely divine in their candied fruit sweetness. That being said, there aren't too many perceptible esters, so the brew has questionable complexity compared to other Quads. Still, well, well worth one's time."
"D: With all of the sweet fruit flavors rolling around in this one, this had the potential to be a syrupy-sweet mess. Thanks to the lightly roasted malt backbone this Quad features excellent balance and drinkability. The alcohol is very subdued and serves to enhance (and not trample) the complexity of this fine Quad."
"While this was a great beer to have on tap, I got the impression it could really improve and develop after a couple years in a celler. It had a rich fruit flavor with plums and apples, but not much else. I could really tell this brew used sugar of some sort from the sweetness, but that's not a bad thing and actually helped drinkability quite a bit. A good, I'll have to cellar a bottle some time."
"Clear reddish mahogony color with a big creamy tight head that diminishes slowly leaving a nice lace. The smell is sugary sweet and fruity but balanced by a strong alcohol presence. The Koningshoeven Quad is medium bodied with low carbonation that gives this beer a smooth mouthfeel. The taste is hard to pin down. It seemed to evolve as I worked my way through it, and as my tastebuds adjusted to the beer. Definitely malty, but at times nutty and then at other times giving off hints of bourbon. The finish is slightly bitter and moderately alcoholic. A nice warming beer that will most certainly give you a buzz."
"This is one big, bubbly, bold quad, and pretty good to boot. It's not over the top in any way, but it is strong across the board. The ABV is substantial and worthy of a wary eye, but it's warm and cozy as well. It seems the Belgian Trappists aren't the only ones with a quad of a clue."
"D - Not awful, but definitely not good. It is too strong, syrupy and boozy. It tastes alright, but the combination of effects, made me more than comfortable with giving half of the fifth away."
"Very nice Trappist quad. Amber color with cream head. Light scent that is typically quadish with some floral notes. Taste is malty, fruity (banana, raisin, berry), savory, and nutty. Fantastic creamy full mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable. Overall very nice."
"The body is very full and creamy. The carbonation is very light. The 10% alcohol is hardly noticeable. I would drink it again, and I look forward to trying the other Koeningshoeven beers on subsequent visits to Omaha (if we don't get the beers here in Iowa City before, since we've been trying to get them in at John's for the past few months)."
"Pours a murky, reddish brown over a dense, rocky head that hangs about for quite a while, leaving dense lacing. Smells of plums, raisins, spice (cinnamon & cloves?) with a citrus note at the end. The taste is fantastic! Deeper and sweeter than the aroma, the fruit bursts through and then notes of chocolate and a dusty, tart finish. The aftertaste brings the sweetness back, like bing cherries and the warmth of alcohol and a hint of brandy. The mouthfeel is full and oily, with a chewy finish. The tartness at the end of the flavor seems a bit at odd with the smoothness of the mouthfeel, but I'm nitpicking at this point. The drinkability is dangerously good. If the alcohol finish doesn't throw you off, you could easily sip these all evening. A wonderful, wonderful beer. Worthy of the ""Trappist"" designation it still seems to claim despite its commercial production."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is thick and on the syrupy side, and when combined with the alcohol, makes this a bit of a chore to finish."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick head. Smells sweet and a tad bit fruity, all pleasing and not over powering. Lot of alcohol presence, but in a warming pleasing way, not something like a malt liquor where it just is up front and bad, sort of like drinking good liquor. Drink this beer warmer and swish it around in your mouth. It thickens and tastes like caramel corn with slight hints of fruit. I loved this beer and would buy it again. Not as easy to throw back, and you wouldn't want to, as other Belgian brews. This is a good one to sip on and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Not too sweet, but it could use a bit more spiciness or bitterness to balance."
"D - ABV is too high to be really drinkable in quantity, but I'd have it again."
"A malty taste with vanilla and fig ensues. Some hints of nut present. The mouthfeel is a bit dry and, personally, too bubbly. It leaves a bite on the back of your throat as it goes down. Drinkability is limited."
"Found a four pack of this is in a back corner of an obscure store in Columbus Ohio call the wine vault which is pretty alright. Poured vigorously in to a red wine glass. The body is a deep rusty brownish copper. The head is thick, off white, with good retention. The lacing is nice Tsunami style all over the glass. Smells of caramel, apple core, candied plum, slight fudginess and bread. After looking this beer up I sort of deducted that this beer has to be at least two or three years old, which is really apparent in it's wonderful mature complexity. The taste is very similar to the smell, absolutely great, subtle dark fruit esters, sweet malt, balanced perfectly with subtle hop bitterness. This is a great beer an extremely drinkable quad. I am very happy to have come a cross this, ultimate thanks to the Wine Vault."
"Drinkability/notes: A wonderful ale, magnificent in its richness."
"Great mouthfeel, carbonation is just right. 10% ABV lowers drinkability, but this is overall a very well done Dutch Belgian."
"This one, in my opinion, is right up there with Rochefort and St. Bernardus. Probably ranked Rochefort, Koningshoeven, St. Bernardus respectively, in my opinion. Like them both, this beer can be pretty harsh when it is fresh. I've had this beer when it is aged for a couple years and my jaw hit the floor it was so astounding."
"Taste is alcoholic with a good solid malt backbone. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but not that it inhibits the drinkability. The dark malts give the beer a roasty taste and support the big alcohol and malt. Bitterness could be more, there is not really a strong bitter or hop tone, but still the beer is bitter enough to balance the beer. There is some stickiness on the lipps, but this suits the style."
"750ml bottle poured into a Bernardus chalice. Pours a cloudy, opaque mahogany color with a small white head. Quite fruity nose (plums, ripe apples) with a musty, hay-like note at the edges. Sweet and malty, with a liquorice and anise flavor; low bitterness really lets the barley and fruit character be tasted; alcohol is notable in the finish, somewhat harsh. Big bodied, full in the mouth."
"The flavor was sweet with mollasses, slightly spiced with cloves and cinnamon, and had a bittersweet tang like that of orange rind, which I really enjoyed. The finish was smooth and warming with alcohol. I felt the flavor was pleasantly complex and generaly enjoyable."
"Pours a deep copper with ruby highlights, very thin white cap that just sits right on top. Lots of sticky lacings hang on the side. Aroma is full of raisins, currants, sherry, and slight vanilla from the what seems like a bourbon oak barrel in the back. A little flowery from some hops, and some alcohol on the nose. Flavor is lots of dark, yet just ripe clean fruits up front...raisin, fig, black cherry...with some spicy peppery hops calm the sweetness down. Finishes dry like thin dried tobacco. A earthy oak background carries throughout, but stays through to the aftertaste a little too strong. Very warming, med-thin body, and medium carbonation. Very nice!"
"I think one's going to be enough for me. It's not bad, but it's not Chimay either. About the same price too. Too much alcohol, both in content and taste, to be a regular for me."
"I'm happy so many people thought this was phenomenal, but I just couldn't get there. I tasted a little cinamon, and candy sugar, but the overall impression was that of a beer stored too long in sub-standard conditions. My bottle said it was a Trappist ale, but I did not find the Trappist seal anywhere on the bottle (like the one on Chimay, Rochefort, Orval et. al.). Did I get some weird bootleg version, or is La Trappe suffering from some serious ""has been/ used to be"" issues? All the other beers in their line I tried were similarly compromised in quality of aroma/ body/ flavor/ finish. Rather two dimensional."
"D - Easy to drink for sure, esp. at 10%. Tasty and non-boozy. Very sweet, which may make drinking many of these difficult (if not the 10% abv that would knock you on your ass anyway). I find the apple flavour intriguing - rather than the sharp green apple aroma/flavour usually encountered, this one is much more mellow and mouth-filling. Overall, a fantastic brew. I'm sad it's not available locally."
"D: A very good beer. The best quad I've tried yet."
"After taking the bottle from the fridge I left it for awhile to get it to its recommended serving temperature, between 8 and 12 Â°C. It poured a lovely dark amber, about 2cm head that quickly receded into a thin layer of small bubbles. Almost no visible bubbles. There is not much smell, just some sweetness and alcohol. The taste is also not very prominent and did not really agree with me. It's too sweet, for some reason, just sugary and not very interesting. Oddly enough the alcohol was not very prevalent, given the high ABV. Maybe I need to be in the mood or something to fully appreciate this beer."
"[Edit: Seems that I am the only one who's tried this beer that reported ""no"" head. I'll definitely try it again to see if I got a bad bottle. Hell, if it was ""bad," I can't WAIT to see what ""good"" looks like!]"
"D: Drinkable to an extent. Not more than one or two of these puppies in one sitting. Definately worth a try, but the high abv and sweetness make this a onesy and then on to something else. With that said, I would have this again and am glad I've got 2 more in my cellar waiting for me."
"All in all a decent offering, but in my eyes only worth the price if you're really jonesing for it."
"11.2oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a big frothy head, great longevity and lace. Smell of dried dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and a bit brandy like. Alcohol is present but not harsh or overpowering. Dried dark fruit flavors mixed with big malts and candi sugar. Not hugely flavorful or ozerly complex but enough. Smooth, creamy and refreshing (as much as a quad can be). Definate alcohol in the finish. Still a bit young. I am glad I have 3 more stashed away. All in all a very good beer."
"D - Better as it warmed to room temp from the cellar. A good quad, but not sure if it's my first choice for a next quad."
"All in all, pretty good, but not as good as some quads that I've had. One thing I wonder though, is how this is labeled as a ""trappist ale", without having a trappist certification. Kinda odd."
"Koningshoeven Quadrupel pours an opaque, very dark orange, almost brown color with a small off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is fruity, grape, malty and some alcohol. I taste a little malt up front, then fruit and alcohol is definitely present if not overpowering. Maybe some candy sugar too. Recommended."
"Eric"
"M&D: med-full bodied for what I know of a Quadrupel, but the mouthfeel is rather fizzy and not as mellow as I prefer it to be, while the alc. is a bit assertive, standing in the way for fuller enjoyment. Compared with some other examples of this style I've tried, I find this one quite ""underperforming"" with some apparently sharp edges to square. An older bottle might be more complex and taste better, I hope?"
"Drinkability: A pleasure to drink, with the alcohol hidden very well, especially at 10% ABV. I may try future pairings with cheese because I think some great things would happen. Definitely give this brew a shot, it's fairly different for a quad in a way, but I really enjoy it and will drink it again."
"But overall, this is porbably my least favorite trappist."
"Opinion: I really enjoyed this beer. It is in a really tough category, but it does well to hold its own. Even though this beer is pretty sweet, it is still too easily drinkable. I would like it to be attenuated just a bit more to cut the syrupy feeling that lingers, but that could be its charm to mask the alcohol. I am almost done with the beer, and I am already feeling its ""blessing"" from the alcohol. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: A good Quad and surprisingly drinkable for a beer that clocks in at 10% ABV. After trying all 4 of thier main ones, this one is their best. Very good!"
"Verdict: This isn't an everyday beer. It lacks some of the complexity of other Trappist-style ales, but simple joy can be found in La Trappe's eager-to-please sweetness. I imagine this would be incredible after a dinner of roasted turkey."
"The nose is very sweet, with lots of bubblegum and some malt scent coming through. The alcohol also comes through a bit, but not too much. The sugar is what really dominates the smell. Same for the taste. It almost tastes like malty cotton candy. Unfortunately the sweetness obfuscates other flavors. There is some fruit and malt, but the fruit tastes like candy that is artificially flavored, rather than an identifiable fruit. Aside from the sweetness, it is pleasant to drink, but I doubt that I could drink more than two without vomiting. ItÂ’s just too damn sweet."
"This is an '04 that I've had in the cellar for two years. Nice half inch, light brown head, excellent lacing. Color is dark brown. Aroma of moderate malt, toasted, moderate yeast, dough, banana, vanilla, and cherry. Initial flavor was moderately sweet with a long finish. Really malty taste, but not as much cherry and vanilla that was indicated by the aroma. There was a moderate a level of alcohol in the finish. I think this could;ve stayed in the cellar for a coupld more year."
"Grabbed this at the Brickskeller in DC. Poured a beautiful brown, with a huge foamy head. Lacing was excellent. The aroma was what youd expect from a quad but with suble undertones often missing from lesser examples of the style. Citrus and yeast, sour fruits, spices and bread. The taste is spice and sweet hops, cloves, sour fruits, alcohol and sugars. It was balanced as well as any quad I've ever had. The mouthfeel was somewhat astringent with its acidicty, but excellent for sipping, even with its carbonation. I loved this beer and it has now risen to my favorite example of the style. Absolutely excellent."
"Lightly lemony, sour aroma, good but not too unusual for a Belgian. Taste is a complicated blend of citrus, clove, and finishes on a bit of plum. Fruity, but astonishingly drinkable considering how busy the drink is. Highly recommended."
"The finish is a lingering bitter/sweet that warms the chest."
"Drinkability: The ale is very strong, maybe even moreso after six years. If you have a fresh bottle, it may be a little hot (malt-related) so let it sit for a while."
"This beer was a bit of a let-down, especially after paying $11 for a 4 pack."
"Big whiff of candy sugar, alcohol and what smells like artifical sweetner. Deep amber with a thick two finger head. Alcohol followed by more of the chemical sweetness I find in about half the bottles I try of this. I think it is newer bottles that taste this way cause the better samples I have had have come from shops with low turnover. Fruit mash, some caramel notes, yeast and riasins are present as well, but often that flavor is dominated by that chemical sweetness."
"Perhaps the least enjoyable of all Trappist beers. Fruits, candy, and Belgian yeast are hardly appreciated over the fusal alcohols. Dehydrated fruits, candy sugar, and bready yeast are present, but the alcoholic strength and a undecernable nausiating flavor persists from beginning to end. Though I want to like it, the drinkability is low. Finsihes dry, sweet, and fruity / spicy. Not a particualarly good offering for the style."
"This beer pours a nice copper/apple cider color with a gigantic frothy tan head thatÂ’s sustained by a fleet of little bubbles. This left cobwebs of lace along the sides of my tulip glass. Smells predominantly (disappointingly so) of alcohol with some red wine, green grapes, oak and an underlying sweet bread dough. The flavor consists of a wonderful concoction of musky fruits to include prunes, sour strawberries, cherries and some mild oranges (and then some pears as it warmed). These are all tied together with a smooth, yet dry, oak and doughy yeast that reminds me of pizza dough. Also, thereÂ’s a subtle spiciness brought on by the yeast and the alcohol. The fruity sweetness in this beer is wonderfully contained by this dryness. Finishes with some lingering dark fruits and an amplified version of the smooth spicy yeast. ThereÂ’s also a good deal of gentle warming. The mouth feel feels initially light, but is a bit sluggish moving around in my mouth with big explosive bubbles that feel electric across the roof of my mouth. This is a really top notch brew with a fantastic balance of flavors that is terrifically enjoyable to drink. Reflecting on the potency of past quadruples, this is easily the easiest going down."
"Dark copper brown in color with a thick bubbly eggshell colored head. Good retention with a nice lacing around the glass. The smell is a touch spicy with a smooth fruity finish, it really reminded me of a butterscotch candy. Taste is sweet and smooth on the palate with a delicate balance of fruit and spice. Well carbonated feel that finishes light yet is quite filling. Not as heavy as I expected for a quad, but very satisfying."
"Very nice, somewhat hazy brown color. Awesome, tannish head that lasts the whole way down the glass. Aroma is a tad subdued. Malty and somewhat spicy. Buttery and pineapple like. Great, full malty flavor. Nicely spiced. Brown sugar, raisens and a slight alcohol burn combine to make a perfect blend of flavors. Very good body. Exceptionally drinkable beer. Very enjoyable. A real sipper for sure."
"Small bottle from a gift set box, which included the nice glass I'm sampling from.No freshness indication. Pours semi clear, rich dark honey amber, with a light tan head, leaving nice striated lacing. Nose here is of some spice, some sweet candi sugars and slight vanilla. Rich, tasty and complex brew, notes of honey, warming alcohol, rum soaked raisins, figs and wintery spice. World class quad, in the same ballpark as Westy and St. Bernardus. Go get some and enjoy this fine creation in brewing."
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention. Aroma of cookie dough, which seems to be part of all beer from this brewery and is very enjoyable. Taste is also comprised of sweet malt reminiscent of cookie dough with some dry figs. Body could be more full and alcohol was well hidden. Still missing a little something to match the other great beer from this style thought."
"This Quadrupel doesn't leave a whole lot to be desired. A bit expensive, but I'll probably be having it again."
"This may not rise to the Westy/rochefort/St. B level of darkness; but who says it has to? Its terrific on its own. This is no doubt one of their best products, and it could win some people over."
"This is a BIG beer. Huge assault of carmel sweetness hits you upon the first smell; it also screams alcohol. I felt this beer became better as I drank it- or I became less critical. It just seems to work. It is sugary, but backs off just enough to let you drink it without any worries. Definetely hits the back of your throat, like it doesn't want to leave you so fast. But even given this, I just enjoyed it so much- in the end it is balanced even though it is very strong."
"The beers looks very refined in a Leffe goblet ; all tawny brown with a classic big Belgian head. The nose is candysugar and plummy notes combined with wiffs of alcohol. The taste is sweetish was a slightly hot finish. Notes of old fruit and hops permeate the mouthfeel. This becomes more refined with each sip until a balance occurs where the beer smoothes out in contrast to its alcoholic largeness. A real sign of a good Triple/Double/ Quad is the ability of the beer to become a sum of its parts. This still is a great example of the style."
"This is definately not a bad beer, has its ups and downs. I would probably pick up another bottle."
"chewy. is this a slurpee?ã€€so thick and full of flavor. alcohol is very noticeable, obviously 10%. similar to other great belgian styles, double and trippel ... quad ... mmmm. good shit, but not totally irreproachable."
"The appearance and smell of this monster are quite nice. Poured a cloudy amber / bronze colour with a foamy off-white head. Nice lacing. The smell was heavy on malt and heavy on fruit. The smell alone lets you know that 'big alcohol' is comming. The taste is sweet. A little raisin like with a monster alcohol finish and is a bit syrupy to me. It isn't unpleasant, but close. I have to be in the mood for this one, and a 750mL is plenty plenty plenty to work on over the course of 45 minutes or so, provoded you can keep it cool that long. This is a fairly powerful brew that must be consumed ""at the proper occasion."""
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. The cork broke off during extraction was this beer corked, as wine can become corked? Might have to revisit in time."
"Bottled, fresh. The aroma is very nice although a bit yeasty and alcoholic, but it's nice and fruity with mainly apple. Looks good, nothing wrong there. The flavor isn't bad at all, but not complex like other Trappists. Rather sweet with apple as main flavor besides that. Long last and syrupy finish. It's bottleconditioned but somehow only once in a while you'll have some yeast on the bottom of you bottle. I must say that it's still a very good beer but it used to be better, more complex, less sweet. Try to find a pre 1999 bottle and you'll know what I'm talking about."
"A solid and enjoyable beer. As I approach the middle of the glass, I'm already wishing that I had a second bottle. I will pick up another in the near future."
"This brew pours a murky reddish-brown color. The head is creamy and white, but recedes within about thirty seconds. The aroma is malty and sugar. There is no classic Belgain aroma, which is very disappointing. The taste is sweet and fruity with the alcohol making its presence known. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew, tasty but not spectacular."
"Not as bold and flavorful as I expected. The alcohol seemed to predominate in this beer more than anything else. Even smelled the alcohol around a sugary-malty smell. Flavor is alcohol on the front and the back. Inbetween there are malts and some overly sweet candy sugar. A rather medicinal flavor that brings me back to my days of my youth when my mother would pour cold medicine down my throat. Slight hints of raisins--bt the type that have been sugar-coated. Poured a deep amber hue in color with a thick foamy head that never went away. Lots of stringy lace that was strangely thick and sticky. Full body but light in the sense that it seemed to evaporate from the tip of my tongue before I could swallow."
"I've been considering trying a home-brew version of this beer to serve from a keg. The experiment should be fun."
"Mouthfeel is pretty smooth considering the alcohol content. Taste is of ripened fruit, with a a subtle hop kick that is sufficient to lend balance to the brew. The overall feel is kind of cake-like. Very bready and almost cloying as the drinks progress. All in all not a bad beer."
"A very nice quad from a good brewery. Served out of a 750 into a chalice glass. Cellared @65 degrees for about a year and a half. Less ""pop"" than I was expecting from the cork worried me, but it still poured out with good carbonation. Hazy amber color. Aromas were very champagne like. Taste was somewhat sweet, malty, a bit of Riesling white wine character, dark fruits and of course alcohol. Alcohol was prominent, but not overbearing. Rich mouthfeel as it warmed. Very drinkable for ABV. I still prefer Abt 12 to this one, but this is a nice option as well and can often be found somewhat inexpensively."
"Conlusion: I'm boggled and disappointed by this one. It is way too alcoholic and lacks flavour. Seeing as it tastes more like an average barleywine I'd say it sort of misses the style too. With excellent Quadrupels like Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 being widely available, this is not worth seeking."
"Deep caramel colour with light haze and flecks of yeast/sediment. Starts creamy, and the off-white head quickly reduced to a ring of foam. Initial aroma is a combination of apples and alcohol, almost like a cider, but there's a maltiness there as well with a light grape fruitiness. Rich apple and vinous flavour throughout with plenty of malty and fruity sweetness. Quite mellow with a pleasant alcohol warmth at the finish. Chewy, marshmallow texture, full body with carbonation on the low side. Very nicely balanced for its strength. This bottle had been aged about a year and seemed very mellow and well rounded. Thanks Viggo."
"A fairly good dark belgian style ale, not anywhere near on par with the belgian trappists but drinkable none the less"
"Pours like iced tea, rich dark brown/amber, lots of sediment, huge head, legs and good lacing. Smell is alcohol, dark fruits, apple, grapes, sweet. Alcohol is also apparent in the taste however its a nice warming alcohol, very malty, apple and citrus, yeasty. Very warming beer, good carbonation, very mellowed as its been aging for 1 1/2 years. Excellent."
"33 cl. bottle. Copper colored with a thick tan head. Has a Cotton candy sweet vanilla smell. Medium bodied with an airy mouthfeel. Taste is a strong ,sugary spice flavor. Finishes with a medium strong alcohol tang. Not a bad fire side belly warmer, though the alcohol taste is pretty harsh here."
"This one is a sipper for sure. Sort of like a bitter dessert wine. Almost a shame I am drinking this in 92 degree heat (of course the a/c makes that manageable). Too much too fast will make my head spin!"
"This brew tastes and feels complete."
"This poured with a thick whitish/tan head. The color was a honey-like golden yellow. In fact, it had a very sweet nose that approached that of honey. There was a thick syrupy mouthfeel to it. It was also sweet in the mouth with a muted honey flavor underlying the general sweetness. I noted a taste of licorice or anise on the finish. The final pour was as thick as gelatin with suspended yeast throughout. I cannot say that it was unenjoyable, but sweetness just isn't my thing and so I would not be too quick to reach for a second one."
"Her taste is quite particular, sweet, maltish, not very hoppy. A sweetness of beer with the caramel flavours that is very smooth. An afternote of alcohol comes play, not that often."
"Overall, I think this is the most full-bodied, well-balanced Trappe beer- definitely my favorite. Light, smooth, silky even, and very tasty- with each sip you continue to find new tastes and hints of things- keeps you on your toes."
"Very complex and wonderful to drink, but not something I would session with."
"Now the review is over, I shall enjoy some crackers and aged English Cheddar."
"Overall, not a bad quad but this one lacks the depth and breadth of character seen in the top of the line quadruples."
"A wonderfully delicious offering from the silent monks of central Europe; thank God they donÂ’t talk. I think IÂ’ve just discovered the most difficult job in the world."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle. Pours out a beautiful shade of orangish brown, with a nice head that fades into a ring of bubbles on top of the beer. Smell is very fruity and sweet, alcohol, plums, raisins, bubblegum and hops. Taste is big and well rounded, spicy and sweet with fruit and alcohol, finishes with a tootsie pop and alcohol flavor. Excellent deep beer. Mouthfeel is well carbonated which goes nicely with the flavor. An excellent sipping beer. One of the best quad's I've had."
" The initial aroma was of nice yeast, malt and maybe a little brown sugar. The flavor was slightly yeasty initially and as it warmed up much more of the fruity flavors (banana, pear?, raisin) began to show. This beer seemed to be fairly high in carbonation. The alcohol is 10% and although it was evident in the warming effect the beer had, it was in no way overpowering. Overall a very enjoyable Trappist beer. I will definitely try it again and I am looking forward to trying the enkel. dubbel and trippel that they produce."
"The smell of this beer is a true knockout, but as one taster noted, ""it's like making out with a girl with too much perfume on"". A little cloying for me and the other tasters."
"There are so many brewers that make their attemp at a quad. Some get close, some don't have a clue. This is a true quad. God bless everyone of the Cistercian Monks. Earthy, fruity, (banana, plum) bubble gummy and malty. The pour looks cloudy almost dirt like. The head lightly lingers till the end. Let it warm a bit and everything melds into liquid ectacy. This is one of my most favorite Trappist creations. Any effort required to find this brew would be truly worth it. Wonderful."
"The mouthfeel is medium/big with creamy, velvet-like carbonation. There is a lasting aroma of sweet fruit long after my goblet is emptied. Thank you Monks!"
"this brewery is the best non-us out there."
"Drinkability is good this is not my favorite style but this is an enjoyable beer better then the other Koningshoevens I have had. Or maybe was just in the mood tonight for something other then my Bigfoot fix. Anyway thanks merlin48 for this sample have held on to it for 4 months about time I drank it."
"This is a fantastic, complex ""comfort"" beer that is the perfect accompaniment to relaxing evening wind downs or lazy chilly autumn days. A credit to the style but not quite the masterpiece that you'll find in a St. Bernardus Abt 12."
"Appears a dark brown iced tea color in the glass. A small tan head forms over the body before dispersing and leaving a minimal scattering of lace. Aroma was a bit fruity with a strong yeast smell. Also noticeable was a large amount of candy sugar. Not quite as deep and rich as other quads but still solid smelling. Sugary sweetness starts off the taste along with some fruit flavors such as apples and raisins. A bit too much sweetness in this one and not much else balancing it out. Body is about medium and doesnÂ’t have that cream smoothness I have come to expect from quads. Drinkability is decent but this is not what I would reach for if I wanted a quad. Thanks to clvand0 for the sample."
"Poured burgundy brown with a thin white head tah coated the glass on the way down. The nose is incredible: caramel malts and and tart green apples, great combination. Flavor is very complex: caramel malts and esters, bready. The taste of alcohol is evident and well incorporated, not overwhelming at all. This is a very tasty brew that should do nicely in the cellar. A true disappointment when the three pack was finished."
"Pours a nice copper/amber color into my glass. Not much head, but given the ABV of this monster, it's not surprising. Lacing was decent though. Aromas first hit me as raisins, and perhaps figs. A dried fruit theme in this one. Taste and mouthfeel are full of alcohol, and very dry. Not much malt presense here, just finished very very dry. Not a great beer in my book, I prefere more lush malts in the finish."
"Very drinkable for 10%. However it would knock you on your butt."
"By they way, I bought this 750ml bottle at Kappy's in Wellington Circle for $9.99 and it included a small glass."
"Very fine quad. Alcohol is well hidden and makes for an enjoyable sipping experience."
"Certainly a big, big taste at work here. Starts with lots of foam, but that subsides quickly. The brown hazy body shows off a cascade of golden bubbles when I pour more into the Belgian glass. Nice brown sugar smell. Even my non-drinking wife wanted to taste it, and delcared it delicious and sweet. Yep, good candi sugar sweetness. Extra alcohol smoothness gives it the texture of a sweet dinner wine. Or maybe I can compare it to a berley wine, just missing the hop bouquet."
"Very good brew... I'd drink it all night not for the 10% (that is very well cloaked)."
"This beer was excellent. I had it as part of a series session... had their singel, dubbel, tripel, and quadrupel in order with a friend."
"This beer came in a 11.2oz bottle. Pours a brown color with a small head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. The aroma is yeasty and fruity with a slight bit of malts. Typically I love a good Belgian, but this one didn't have a nice flavor. There is a fig and sweet malt flavor, but it is really weak. It needs to have more flavor if it's going to be a good quad."
"Pours a cream, five finger plus (pour very slowly) head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation. Nose is a sweet malty nutmeg. Starts smooth and sweet, has a mellow finish. $8.54 for a 750ml bottle from Oliver's Beverage Albany, NY."
"One of the few positive things to say about this beer is that the sweetness was rather low and unobtrusive. At best a weak take on the style. As far as trappists go (and this bottle was labeled as such) a failure on many fronts."
"This beer pours a nice rich tea color with finger of head that falls very quickly. The nose is not as full and rich as I want it to be. There's just a hint of the deep fig smell I want, but there are some more sweet notes that I don't expect. The flavor is more rich and full than the nose hints at, but it is still not as powerful as I want it to be. The raisin and fig notes just don't dominate as I would like them to be. The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I would like; its lacking the syrupy character I would like. Drinkability is okay. This beer is just not anything special all the way around."
"Thanks Genaro!"
"The beer poured out hazy dark orange in color with a tall blooming head. The aroma was spicy and sweet with orange peel, coriander, and candi sugar. The taste was sweet and tangy with an allusion of bitterness, and was backed by a good deal of spicy warm alcohol presence. The mouthfeel was clean and creamy. I did not feel that this beer was quite as complex as most quads, but was satisfying in its own way."
"I don't know how this beer is when fresh but I must say that it ages amazingly well. Pours a hazy thick darkish coppery color with a midsize frothy white head. Decent lacing. Smell has a lightly fruit flavor (apples and peaches) with a bouquet of hops. Taste however is much darker in fruity flavor. Red grape skins and plums. Sweet malts mix in. Caramel and chocolate. A huge nutty flavor rides the raspberry/maple syrup body. Finish is dry and wine-like. It lingers in a soft way. I don't really notice the alcohol but feel it the further I go. Hops are weak in body and hardly noticeable. The malt complexity and depth of this beer are amazing. I kept finding new flavors. However, I don't think I could drink much of this at one sitting but I am definitely making sure to get more of it next time I see it."
"Pretty intense, even for the style. Dark fruit character, rum soaked prunes and overripe apples, some unusual yeast notes in there. The alcohol wafts in and out of the flavor, adding some white pepper spice. Substantial but not syrupy. Sweetness well balanced by some not-quite-hops bittering. While the Quad has never been a ""warm and cuddly"" style for me, this one really didn't engage me."
"All and all this was an incrediblely tasty and refreshing beer. I think it would go great with food, or just with friends."
"Malty flavors on the mouth upfront, but finish is dominated by alcohol that lingers and cools the throat with each breath that follows prior to the next sip. Too much alcohol flavor in this one for me to recommend, it needs to be balanced better."
"The taste was powerful to me and very complex with fruity green apple overtones. The alcohol had quite a bite and warmed all the way down. It felt smooth in my mouth but had a bit of a metallic tinge that I don't particularly like. I'm glad I experienced it, but doubt I'll drink it again."
"the mouthfeel was a bit syrupy but otherwise fine, but the strong sweet character keeps it from being easy to drink. definitely not my favorite of the trappists."
"ok it must have been a bad bottle. had this on draft recently and it was dam tasty. fruity, dried fruits and slight spice from the warming alcohol. much better so i upped the scores a bit"
"Has a dark amber body with a reddish tint. Big creamy beige head. The aroma was full of dried fruit with just a hint of banana. That great dried fruit characteristic carries over into the taste. As the smooth dried fruit flavor covers your tongue the hop sharpness comes in. Giving a little bit of bitterness just before that, sit down and relax, alcohol warmth slides down your throat. As this ale warms to room temperature it gains in complexity."
"Full bodied. That rugged looking carbonation calms down quickly, becoming quite easy."
"Drinkability: I should hope to drink this beer several more times in my life time. It was a great experience - a real sipping beer that you want to make last all night, but you can't - unless you buy a case of them."
"3.5 years later had on-tap in Toronto fresh and great aroma, and rich wine-like colour of course. A bit boozy rich and sweetish."
"This beer really has alot of promise, but the acetone and metals hamper it's drinkability. They key to enjoying this beer is swirling and warming. They really need to clean up their fermenting method. Better than the dubbel or triple, but still somewhat poor when compared to others in the style."
"A very dense and fine head on a beautiful purple copper color opaque body. The smell is yeasty, with ripe bananas and strawberries, with a hint of citrus. The sweet (almost artificial) bananas are clearly noticeable in the taste too, with some citrus. The alcohol warms the throat but is a bit too noticeable for my palate. With the hops, it contributes to a thick aftertaste that lowers the beer's drinkability. The mouthfeel is round , smooth and complex. A good beer overall, some very nice features, but the high alcohol content kinda ruins it imo."
"Overall, a bit on the fruity sweet side of the scale, but with plenty of spices to balance. The subdued yeastiness adds to the complexity. I like this one a lot."
"Sweet and syrupy in character. Banana and burnt toffee come through quite clearly. Some other fruit in there that reminds me some of cherries there as well. Some breadiness in the finish. Lots of interesting flavours, but quite sweet. This is a slow sippin' after supper sitting around sort of beer. Alcohol is quite noticeable, but comfortably done."
"Pours amber with huge white, bubbly head. Smelled various fruity tones with some phenols and alcohol kick at the end. Flavor starts out thin with yeasty fruitiness, then moves back on the tongue and instantly fills mouth with creamy woodsy flavor. A bit of astringent bitterness in the finish but alcohol is also noticeable (better be at 10%!) and helps keep the finish lighter and pleasant. Smooths out nicely. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying - creamy and well carbonated. I loved the variation of flavor character and mouthfeel from tip of the tongue all the way down the throat - very complex and easy to enjoy slowly!"
"My first Quad ever. I went to the liquor store to find Allagash 4 but it wasn't available so i ""settled"" for this one. Pours a very nice looking amber color with a billowing white head one would expect. Smell has some fruity characteristics along with some spiciness. The first thing i noticed about the taste is the yeast. This is a very yeasty beer. Notes of orange/cloves were also apparent. Very enjoyable sipping beer. This is a full bodied beer, but I question it's drinkability. Overall it was an excellent surprise for me."
"This is an excellent beer in my opinion and has garnered some more of my respect for the style. As for drinkability, I donÂ’t think IÂ’ll have any trouble finishing off the 750 and I could definitely see drinking this one again. Plus the fact of anything being brewed by monks just seems to make everything feelÂ….right. Or something."
"This is a very tasty brew and I will be sure to purchase it again!"
"overall, a very drinkable ale for a 10-percenter. not really a very extreme beer once you get past the ABV. if you like ommegang, trois pistoles and a variety of belgian dubbels and brown ales, you'll probably like this one. if you love the fruitiness and complex maltiness of those styles, this oughta be your steez."
"12oz bottle that has the Koningshoeven label yet embossed with LaTrappe. Poured a slightly cloudy amber-brown with a beige head that is quite thick and leaving scattered lacing. Outstanding aroma of fruit, sweet malt and yeast with notes of figs and plums. Mouthfeel is velvety with a crisp lively carbonated feel. Quite smooth. The flavor is also outstanding. Fruity and candy sugar sweetness envelopes the strong malt flavor and a bit of alcohol is also detected. A slight warming sensation in the finish. Overall a high quality Trappist ale."
"33cl bottle into La Trappe glass. Dark orange colored, hazy with lots of sediments. Head is off-white and small, diminishing. The aroma is very pleasant, yeasty with sweet malty candy fruitiness reminding peaches, plums and green raisins without forgetting alcohol notes. Good medium to full mouthfeel, rather silky. The taste is not as refined as the scent, it's toffeish, peachy, very malty and sweet with a flowery spicy and hoppy finish that does not grab me particularly."
"Very drinkable, this is some tasty stuff; I need to spend a summer in Belgium once in my life."
"Heavier bodied and little carbonation. Very smooth on the mouthfeel. The thick body of the malt seems to stick to the tongue after swallowing. The alcohol is definitely noticeable. Great beer."
"Drinkability: a very good beer. my favorite from this brewery."
"Pours a medium brown with some orange tints with a real nice big creamy head,aroma has a light sour cherry tinge and 10x sugar notes with some real light smokey/yeasty smell.I get a light green apple flavor wich I didnt expect,definently on the malty side but not overly sweet because there is some light hop bitterness.The best Holland beer I have had and only the third of the style I have had,very impresive."
"11.2oz bottle- Color is a deep rusty brownish orange with big chunks of yeast hanging out at the bottom and suspended within, medium beige head retains a bit before fading to a thin collar and has very minimal spots of lace. Aroma is largely wafting with phenolic yeast and an ethonal alcoholic punch with a modest sweetness of malts lending dulled citrus of melons and orange with hints of banana, raisin, and plum and some touches of caramel skirt underneath. Taste has a nice medley of dark fruits noted in the smell and a malty smooth sweetness with nice yeasty underlaying notes of clove and bits of medicinal plastic. Overall very soild in its length of malts, dashing with dark fruits and trailing with caramel, lighter toffee, and slight mild spice in the finish. The alcohol hardly makes any appearance but there is some warmth sneaking in. Feel is nice and smooth, lightly chewy and creamy with a lighter side of the heavy or full but yet, not medium either. Quite a nice feel, fits well with the malts and yeast. Well balanced and pleasingly smooth and quite quaffable for having 10% ABV, although that sneaks up on ya quickly lending a bit of respect and engaging you to slow down and enjoy it. Best of the La Trappe IMO."
"Good beer but no great in my opinion."
"Sampled 11/20/03"
"Nice,"
"Revisited 2/23/2005. Yeah, it's still friggin' mind-blowingly good. I wouldn't even dare pouring some out for my dead homies, because it's that good."
"Excellent. This has some of the same woody flavor of the dubbel, but has many other well-developed flavors that turn it into a great beer."
"ng"
"Pours a hazy golden brown color with very little head, and low carbonation. A small layer of foam remains with some spotty lace clinging to the glass. Aroma is of bubblegum and malt. The taste is sweet at the start with a slightly dry finish. The feel is smooth and creamy with a good representation of effervescence. The warming effects of the alcohol are pleasant. A well-balanced beer, but is somewhat one-dimensional."
"Even with the high ABV, the alcohol is not overpowering -- to the contrary, it hides in the background and allows the other flavors to compete. It warms the palate with a velvety medium body, edging its way towards a liqueur like an amaretto or a brandy."
"This one gushes out of the gate and pours a mountainess beige head that fades to near perfect in time. The lace and stick are above average. The color here is bright blazing amber. The aromatics are pure mastery!! Wave after wave of fruit driven aromatics in the way of melon, strawberry, peach, raisin, creme caramel, toffee and a streak of vanillan. In the mouth the beer is duly complex offering more fruit in the way of chocolate raisin. Later melted chocolate liquor, roasted mocha, blanched nut, sweet butter, toffee, cocoa powder and again fruit liquor. Way complex!!!! Texturally this beer is liquid velvet. Full bodied, creamy and very warming, this is a sipper. Let this one come to you and give it some time to reveal itself. I did during game Two NLCS Cubs vs Marlins 2003. What a treat!!"
"Very thin mouthfeel, a bit too thin. In all, a very good beer but not something Iâ€™d necessarily ask for, never noxious, softly pleasing. Good results for such high abv."
"Updated Review: Had a bottle that had aged in my fridge for a good 18 months, probably more. Much better. Alcohol taste had faded, more vinous, less peppery, little darker in color, and just wonderful to drink. This had high scores on my first go (a4;s4.5;t4.5;m4.5;d3.5) but the aged version is a bit better. Hold on to one if you can."
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy dark orange under a magnificent tan four-fingered head with lots of body. The initial lacework was incredibly thick - kind of like shelves sticking out from the side of the glass. This thickness gave way later to more conventional but still impressive lacing. The aroma is full and complex - cherry, malt, sugar, alcohol. The mouth is heavy and lightly carbonated. The tongue is quickly overwhelmed by the variety and complexity of flavors - fruits, malts, alcohol, caramel. This old hophead was surprised to find some hoppy bitterness coming through in the finish, nicely balancing the sweet and sour of the fruit. The aftertaste brings the malt back to vie for the fruit. Overall, a very nice impression indeed."
"Comments Â– There is a maturity to the ingredients here that really impressed me. I think it was off slightly for the style, but a terrific brew nevertheless."
"F"
"Â "
"This brew poured a medium head of light brown bubbles and a cloudy brown body. It has a nice mild malt aroma and a strong yeasty taste of spices, smoke, and some burnt flavor from the alcohol content. I rather liked this brew and would love to have a fresh sample. This brew is definitely a keeper."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured with a medium head that lasted a fairly long time. There was no lacing observed on the sides of my glass with this beer. It had a sweet aroma to it in my opinion and it was a fairly smooth beer to drink."
"Whether this is a trappist beer (in the legal sense) or not, this is certainly a good one........as good as many Belgians. It's also quite a good deal, quite a bit cheaper than most of those Belgian selections. I'm looking forward to trying the other Konigshoven/La Trappe selections."
"Deep amber beer that looks like clear liquid caramel. Served with a light tan head. Sweet, bubble gum aromas denote primarily malt and alcohol, but there's a bit of a hop-type note. The taste is very malty and roasted. Good bitterness, with a strong, sweet alcohol taste. A lingering sweetness in the aftertaste eventually fades to an attractive dandelion bitterness. Smooth, delectable mouthfeel and suprisingly good drinkability. This powerful brew could cause problems for the unwary drinker. A very enjoyable beer."
"Sweet yeasty floral nose. Smells very fresh and sweet. Iced tea colored with lots of clumped yeast floaties. (Be careful pouring if you don't like dregs) White head on pour settles to a slight fine lace and sheen in the goblet. Sweet initial taste which leaves quickly and is followed by an acidic tongue and lips. The finish is one that is quite metalic (aluminium) and also slightly sweet. This metalic finish really hurt its drinkability for me.. The brew has a wonderful smell..."
"Pours dark amber, almost brown and very hazy. Carbonation evident, with bubbles rising to form a nice ring around my goblet. Strong aroma. Its got a fruity alcoholic kick with some bready yeast scents in there. This is one great tasting brew. Much more malt backbone than most belgians i've tried. A bit more like a wheat doppelbock. The after taste is dry & fruity, slightly alchoholic and hoppy. Goes down smooth with nice carbonation and a lingering aroma in the nostrils. A bit syrupy on the mouthfeel"
"528"
"Pours a deep garnet color with a creamy light beige colored head that coats the walls of the glass with sheets of sticky lace as it recedes. Lots of fruitiness in the nose with a touch of spicy clove. Full-bodied with a bit of a chewy texture. Taste is sweet up front with notes of candied fruit and rum cake followed by a bit of plum and some woody oak flavors. Some spicy alcohol comes through in the finish. A very tasty brew that does a pretty decent job of hiding its 10% abv. The main drawback of this fine beer is that it is rather expensive going for about $8.40 for a 750ml bottle."
"It's hard to believe that this could be high in alcohol, you can feel it in your mouth but really not taste it...the fruitiness covers it up beautifully. Pours a cloudy brownish orange color with no head, therefore no lace. A good clean tasting ale with little or no bite. A must try for any fan of this style of beer."
"A good beer, but probably my least favorite of the four beers from La Trappe. It's hard to beat the Dubbel."
"Had at the Taste of Belgium event at Celtic Bayou in Redmond, WA... Dark brown/amber in color with a nice head. Hops are minimal and the beer focuses more on the malt/yeast side. Fruity and surprisingly sweet with alcohol flavors very well hidden. I am glad I had the chance to try this before it becomes unavailable in the states."
"While not my favorite Trappist product, it is a very, very nice beer. Very drinkable."
"Pours a dark, brown, cherry, mahogany color. Large head that took a minute or two to settle. I swirled the glass and held it up to my nose. Unbelievable aromas, Slight sour cherry, dark fruits, roasted malts. First sip revealed dark fruits, chocolate, heavy malt flavor. High carbonation in the mouthfeel, with a trail of caramel at the end of the first sip. WOW. What a complex, amazing beer. Hardly any bite at the end, instead a clean, crisp, big malt finish. Great beer, watch the alcohol, as I didn't and had 2-3 too many!"
"The beer pours a clear cherry red with a largish and creamy light tan head and the residual lace a thick and clinging sheet to the glass. Nose is malt with hints of over ripe plums, earthy and sweet and the start also somewhat sweet, nice malt presence and the top medium in feel. Finish has delectable hop spiciness and the acidity stinging, the aftertaste desert dry, a quite pleasant beer, but I much prefer the dubbel and or the triple to this beer."
"Slightly hazy dark bronze in hue, topped by a thick, creamy, well retained ivory white head. Tart citrus and green apple along with mild clove hit the nose at first, then mellow to allow medium caramel and biscuit notes to surface. As the beer breathes, the phenols and esters dissipate, allowing caramel malt and toffee notes to become progressively more pronounced. Hint of jackfruit emerges late in aroma. Sweetness upfront in flavor is molasses like, then is complemented by a bread and butter like biscuit / caramel malt combination. Fruitiness is relatively bright in nature for style, w/ notes of ripe citrus overshadowing underlying darkish hints of dates and prunes. Like other La Trappes, other fermentation byproducts are mild, with only mild clove and trace banana esters present as an undertone. Meager in hop bitterness and thus sweet, but not cloyingly so, overall in character. Moderate in body, with a smooth, firm mouthfeel once the initially high carbonation subsides. Finishes bready and caramelly sweet. Quadrupel is a unique brew. Its flavor kept morphing as I tasted it. At first, it was slightly acidic, prickly and green, then fruitiness tamed into a ripely citric nature; malt character then became progressively more pronounced, thus lending eventual richness in overall profile. Although La Trappe Quadrupel doesn't possess the depth of character as some top examples of style, it is nonetheless a very tasty brew. Drink this one above cellar temp, and let the initially high CO2 levels dissipate. This 750 ml bottle was far superior to the 11.2 oz I previously tasted."
"2001/2002 version: Didn't know quite what to expect with this -- being the first time I'd ever encountered anything called a ""quadrupel."" All I knew is that I'd better save it till right before bedtime! It didn't dissapoint in terms of strength. Alcohol is the first thing to hit the nose, embedded in a deep malty aroma with slightly tart and acidic fruit notes. The beer itself is dark and dubbel like, a hazy medium-brown with a thin tannish head. The flavor too is rich and malty, with prune-like and bready flavors throughout. Alcohol is very unobtrusive, and hops are downplayed, just enough for a well-balanced finish. Relatively high level of carbonation gives this a medium to medium-light impression in the mouth. Very nice strong dark ale."
"Reviewed beer sampled from an 11.2 oz bottle.  Deep amber color with a well retaining cream colored head.  Raisin aroma and flavor with a very noticable amount of alcohol.  Malty and sweet, with some notes of molasses and some unidentifiable spices.  Full body with medium carbonation.  A very good beer, but not among my favorite trappist ales."
"This beer poured a reddish gold color and formed an off white bubbly head that left some trace circular lace.  Some carbonation was present.  An aroma of butter and slightly of clove.  A flavor of butter, clove and malt.  Some alcohol is apparent in the finish.  A good beer."
"This beer is a murky looking burgandy.  A well retained off-white head tops the brew.  Sweet and malty aroma.  Almost ""dopplebock"" sweet as far as the nose.  There are also some subtle fruity tones perceived on the nose.  Taste is stong with flavor and alcohol.  Almost a stinging alcohol presence blends nicely with deep fruity ester qualities.  Some nice wood notes accent nicely.  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  Creamy and smooth.  Body is about medium-full.  A tasty beer to be sure."
"Deep amber color.  Slightly spicy, alcohol aroma.  Full body with a great malt character.  Yeasty and dense.  Pleasant, slightly bitter finish.  Pours with a heavy white head, that doesn't last very long.  Great contemplative beer...sit back and roll a sip around your mouth.  Alcohol warming is matched terrifically with malt and hops."
"Easily my favorite from La Trappe even if the rankings are not much higher than the others."
"Surprisingly easy to drink for a brew with 10%ABV. But, it did tend to have a syruppy texture, with i didn't really agree with, nice spicy flavour, but also a bit sweeter than i like, pretty decent."
"Very hazy, coppery-red body.  Has a moderate sized, creamy head.  Good head retention and lots of lace on the glass.  Plenty of carbonation visible in the body, continually replenishing the head.  Wonderful malt aroma - caramel, toffee, raisin, and a bit of yeast.  Caramel/toffee malt flavor blends well with the raisin and an underlying frutiness that I can't quite place.  Finish is fruity, with obvious alcohol notes.  Thick and chewy brew, but a bit too heavily carbonated for perfection."
"Raisins. And Molasses cookies. Soaked in Rum. That's what I get out of this beer. The beer was a little flat, especially for a trappist beer. Good beer, but I've better beers."
"I was at a tamale party expecting the usual sea of Coronas and Tecates when a women brought twelve 1 pint 9.4 oz bottles of LaTrappe Quadrupels (imported by All Saints Brand Minneapolis).  Good hazy color, large-bubbled but tall head, good effervescence.  Mouth coating, very berry beginning flavor fades to a wine/grape and a little ester at the finish.  Belgians are not my style but this was very cool to try, and the first empty bottle is in my ""museum""."
"My first and only sample of this beer came in a 16-ounce crock and at $7.20, it was a bit pricey.  It poured a slightly cloudy reddish-brown with a sticky tan head that did not retain particularly well.  There was a small amount of lace down the side of the goblet that I used.  The nose was very yeasty and the palate very sweet and fruity, almost candy-like with absolutely no balancing hops bitterness.  Apples?  Prunes?  The mouthfeel was very syrupy and complemented the sweetness.  Effervescence was on the low side of moderate.  Overall, a decent dessert beer, but not a beer that I would drink on a regular basis.  10% abv."
