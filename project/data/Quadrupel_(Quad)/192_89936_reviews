"O: Not a bad quad and it definitely can't stand toe to toe with some of the best from Belgium. It's definitely well made and drinks well. Alcohol could be hidden better but the flavors meld fairly well."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted 5/4/13."

"Have to admit the beer grew on me as I had my second glass, got used to the alcohol content, enjoyed it more and raised a few of my scores. may have to change my idea that I would not buy again if I found it at a good price"

"This effort falls far short of the template set by the classic Belgian quads. In fact, there are many examples of American quadrupels that are more worthy of any quad drinker's attention. Mediocre and forgettable."

"too much alcohol flavor not enough any other flavor. The coffee didn't make an appearance and the cherry was not in the forefront. The only thing that sold me was .... did i mention $2 14 oz drafts left over from tap take over at that price Im going to sample it all night long.... could be much tasiter!"

"Pours a light reddish brown color with an off white head . Aroma of cherries, malt and alcohol. In the taste, much like a big quad with brown sugar, sherry, roast, alcohol and fruit. There is a very slight acidity. This reminds me of an aged Belgian quad. Full bodied mouthfeel and wel carbonated. Overall, this is a good example of the style with a few tweaks."
"Not a great beer but not just a booze bomb. Kind of complex with the cherries and spiciness, but I would noT revisit this one."

"Cascara Quad pours a reddish color with a small but lacing head. There is a sweet boozy aroma, with a dark tart cherry note. The taste has a nice boozy sharp malty backbone, with good hints of tart cherries, then the coffee flavors finish. Good body, coffee flavors don't mix very well, so funky aftertaste. Overall its funky, but enjoyable."

"Overall: Glad this is out of my fridge and I can't say that I'm a fan. Maybe it was a bad bottle, but I got none of the coffee and very little traditional Belgian quadrupel flavors...Unfortunately much of this bottle was a drainpour"
" Abv at 10 is there, but not dominate in any sense."

"O - This is a fine Belgian Strong Dark, but a real miss in the Quad department. Too light in color, too much noticeable alcohol and I'm still not even positive if the coffee cherries were a positive flavor profile to add..."

"New Belgium's Lips of Faith Cascara Quad: ale brewed with dates and coffee cherries, 10% ABV, just over a fingers worth of head; Appearance: very red amber; Smell: cherry/light coffee, light green leaf, fairly light scent overall, faint hazelnut; Taste/Mouthfeel: strong taste of mellow coffee, touch of hazelnut, bit of date, slightly cherry-like taste (but darker), mild aciditym bitter tang on finish; pretty good"

"What an interesting beer. This one definitely has stages on the tongue - First a slightly fusely, yeasty thing that kinda approximates a quad, then some cherry, then some chocolate, and then a finish that blends it all together with some coffee flavors that add a nice bitterness to the end. The aroma's a bit too yeasty, and doesn't work very well with the flavor, but otherwise this is an enjoyable drink that was fun to take apart."
""
"Loaded with ripe fruit, muted chocolate and a hint of mint. Slightly sour in the finish adding to the complexity. Tasty and highly enjoyable."
"22 ounce bottle, label says best enjoyed by August 2014. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a burnt orange/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. The head sticks around for a long time, and there's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells mostly like cherries and dates (really just a lot of dark fruit in general), along with pears, cloves, and some tobacco. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit (cherries, dates, plums), dark bread, caramel, candy sugar, pears, and peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I liked it. $6.99 a bottle, definitely worth trying at that price."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, cherries, hops, slight spice, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Quadruple. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of cherries, alcohol, sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of spice. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and blend, but the body is sadly lacking in strength."

"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, bottled in 2/2013. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, banana, toast, chocolate, dark candi sugar, brown bread, clove, herbal, leather, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity esters with dark malt notes; and good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, pear, apple, fig, toast, chocolate, brown bread, leather, banana, dark candi sugar, herbal, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, toast, chocolate, banana, brown bread, leather, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity ester and dark bready malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Quadrupel style. Nice balance and complexity of fruity esters with dark bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. This improved a lot as it reached room temperature. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, I like that the coffee and cherries are supporting characters that don't taint the beer. I like the high ABV, I just wish the alcohol wasn't so obvious. Regardless, it's a nice tasting, sipping beer."

"Poured into a 3 Monts tulip glass. Pours a medium red amber with a fine two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. Fruit forward aroma of stone fruit and cherry, caramel malt. Flavor begins with rich estery fruit; cherry, apple and light stone fruit and then dries out abruptly and finishes very light and dry with a slightly astringent bitterness. Medium bodied with spicy carbonation in the finish. An interesting and odd take on the quadrupel style. The coffee cherries really do add a pleasant cherry flavor. I would have liked a bit more presence from the dates, which would have given a bit more body to support the sweet fruit flavors. Not a traditional quadrupel, but delivers the coffee cherry experience nicely. Warming and a bit alcohol forward."

"Mouthfeel is thick without being all that sticky. Overall, this is a pretty good beer."
""
"O: I would drink this again. And it's really interesting. Otherwise, not obviously great, but worth your time."
""
"D: This was an ok quad but not great. The scent and taste were kind of bland, and the body wasn't right for the style. The alcohol was hidden pretty well, and the finish was smooth, so it was at least easy to drink. Missing any unique character from the dates or coffee cherries. Not worth aging, and hardly worth trying fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if this would have taken on more of a malt backbone and embraced some other Quad elements this would be much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this isnt an elite beer but it is certainly a very interesting experience. Keeps the palette on its toes and does not bore the drinker. Definitely worth a try."
"Feels alright, still not zing or softness of some quads. One dimensional beer. Couldn't take this one, poured into the bushes."
""
""

"Interesting beer but too sweet and undercarbonated. The roasty character doesn't mesh well either."
""

"O - Definitely a quad but the extra additions aren't extremely noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"I'm not typically a fan of New Belgium but this was an enjoyable quad. I'm assuming it's the coffee cherries that add the pleasant bitter sweet dimension to an overall decent base quad. No problems finishing the whole bomber in one sitting."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty interesting and good beer. Good cherry flavor with a good presence of spicy yeast and toasty malt. Sweet and rich but not too sweet."
""
""
"I picked this bottle up because I haven't had a Quad for New Belgium brewing company. As soon as i opened the bottle i was over whelmed with a smell of cherries. The appearance was a thin white head that just floats on the top of the beer with nice lacing. The smell was dominant ed by spices with the hint of cherries. The taste was just all over the place the flavors were not as balanced as they should of been. Overall not a bad beer is just decent to me."
"Overall, a sweet boozy mess. It tastes a bit like their dubbel with a ton of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there is just way too much going on here. It is a little bit messy with nothing seeming to meld just right. A nice attempt at a unique quad but I feel it is just too overdone."
""
""
"O: Interesting flavor, not very sweet. The finish is very herbaceous. There is some spice as well, but the green flavor controls the finish."
"Overall I thought this was a mediocre beer and an average at best example of the style, it wasn't that true to style and it seemed like the sweetness and the alcohol took the place of all those great malty quad flavors, it was really lacking balance. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, it was boozy and the flavor couldn't hold my attention, I think it would be hard for me to drink the whole bottle, I'm glad i'm sharing it, half a bottle is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, i thought this beer looked pretty good and it looked pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, it was pretty off, the flavors that shouldn't stick out the most did and that made for a pretty harsh quad that wasn't very drinkable. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it might get better with age, but I'm not willing to risk it and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, I don't think it's a good example of the style. All in all i was let down with this beer, it wasn't what I was expecting, I had high hopes after trying their Tripel that was released with this beer, but this turned out to be a let down. Better luck next guys, this one needs some work. So far this is my least favorite beer that I've tried from the Lips Of Faith series."
""
"Price can't be beat at $6/bomber. However, I don't feel all the components meld seamlessly enough to drive me to get more."
""

"The bottle says dates and cherries. Taste is full of dates and dark fruit. Medium sweetness and spiciness. Somehow the flavors just don't come all together. It seems like all the ingredients are there but overall not a very balanced brew. OK but not great. Mouth feel is the right carbonation but the booziness does something funny to the palate."
""
"Going different format for this one. Cloudy dark caramel, not much head but pure white. Lots of sudsy lace. Smell is disappointing, not much going on there. A little clove and banana. Taste is malty, and pretty middle of the road. Mouth is good carb, fair balance, medium to full weight. Overall, just not interesting to me. Most of the Lips of Faith have been disappointing to me, but I keep trying!"
"Pretty difficult to drink except perhaps in particularly small quantities. I didn't get a lot of the purported dates, cherries or coffee, and what's left is something of a pretty messy quad. There are certainly things to like in it, and it's an impressive beer no matter what I think of it personally."
""
""
""
""
"The nose on this beer is amazing, the flavor however is a little too busy for me. Complexity is good thing, but I can't help but think they went a little overboard with this beer."

"Taste has maybe a bit much on the toast and is not as rich as many a quad, but not too shabby actually. I have been totally unimpressed by all LOF offerings that are not sour, this one is fairly impressive though. I like the cascara, and I agree with the cherry and tobacco notes...maybe even add in a touch of coffee as well. Its not as sweet as most quads and mouthfeel not as thick, but still...I could see myself picking up another one or three of these. Not that I think it will age all that well, but a $7 quad bomber is a rare find indeed."
"Overall - Interesting coffee flavor, but the effect is intense for a quad, even if the coffee flavor itself isn't that strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the biggest, brashest, boldest, richest beers to come out of the Lips of Faith series in recent memory. Mmmm. Right up my alley, this one. Love it."
""
"O- One and...done. Forking over $18 for this is just crazy on my part but that is what I do. See new beers, buy them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is beer as contemplative beverage. You don't slug this at the sports bar among strangers during the latest MMA event, you drink this among a minimal amount of close colleagues and discuss philosophy between swigs. One to remember...and buy again if possible."
""
"O: some, but not enough malt profile, complexity or dark fruitiness. Not bad... but not real good either. Almost certainly would benefit from some aging."
""
"jd"
""
""

"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruit, and brown sugar aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's fairly boozy and strong."
"The alcohol taste fades the more you drink, but there is still an presence no matter how much. Interesting, but definitely a one time."
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet and a bit boozy. A Quad in strength but surely not in character. Even with warming and exposure this beer leaves a bit to be desired..."
"I love New Belgium's stuff, but this one is a stinker. It's not awful, but it's not up to their standards, which is a compliment. The fusels kill it. It's boozy and hot and oxidized. They either under-pitched the yeast, didn't oxygenate the wort, or fermented it too hot. Either way, it definitely doesn't stand up to other respected quads typical for the style. Wouldn't bu or recommend this one, even to my Belgian Quad friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I didn't know what to expect, but this is a nice interesting sipper for a Friday night. Or any night."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a good beer. Not one of my favorites though because I'm not too much of a cherry fan. All in all, I think New Belgium nailed it with what they were going for, although not for me you have to give it a try!"
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, decent head, and fair lacing. Nose is a great combination of sour bread accentuated with fermented fruit. Pungent and bready, accentuated with bitter fermented fruit. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"These Lips of Faith beers are always a leap, but this one is both extremely drinkable as well as peculiar. A sensational take on the Belgian style and worth From the 22 oz bottle bought at Royal Liquor in Encinitas."
""
"O – For a quad I wanted more but to be fair this take on the style was adventurous and I appreciate that. I have had quads with cherries before but definitively not cherries and coffee. Despite what I have wrote above I feel that this is a good solid beer. There is very little wrong with it and even less from New Belgium as a whole. This is decent and if I could offer any advice pour this and let it warm up the tastes really come alive."
"Took me a while to figure out what the aftertertaste/finish reminded me of. It was something that I’ve experienced before but I couldn’t name it… until I realized: unripe banana. Yes. That dry, mouth-smacking sensation from eating a still greenish banana. I didn’t care for that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Yikes. It's like there are good flavors in here, but they all made the mistake of attacking your palate at the same time. An initial explosion of Belgian yeast, tobacco, brown sugar, molasses, dates and fig. But those all die as quickly as they showed up and you're left with a fairly unpleasant sour grain husk and faded earthy hop flavor. Some ash and cherry skins as well. I loved the idea of this one, but it didn't really turn out so well."
""
"It almost tastes a bit flat, the mouth feel is nice though. I think I will just have to pick up another bottle and try it again."
""
""
""
"O-it's actually not a terrible quad. it's definitely an american quad, but it has a certain lasting after-taste i really enjoy. also, the abv is barely noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Super sweet and fruity, not impressed at all with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this isn't bad but it's not my cup of tea. Too much of the fruit takes over the yeast and breadyness."
""
""
"Not too bad."
"O - Cascara Quad sounds quite incredible on paper; a quad ""brewed with date with coffee cherries added."" The nose even fulfills the description and expounds on it nicely, really playing to the beer style's usual characteristics nicely but it falls flat in flavor and feel, abandoning the unique and compartmentalized, though harmonious, characteristics for a flavor that's just the opposite; muddled and underwhelming following the aroma. Cascara is by no means a bad beer though, and New Belgium's continued innovation is admirable. Plus, if you're looking for a beer with kick, this one provides it with subtlety."
""
""
""
"Overall a strange mix of flavors. OK but I don't need another one."
""
""
""
""
"7.1/10"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent offering. Good variation of the style with its hints of fruit, coffee and tobacco, but it's a little too subtle and the alcohol burn may be too present to make it great. Still, it was enjoyable."
"O: an alright quad overall, but a bit simplistic and under-attenuated. I wish the coffee cherries came through a bit more. Not offensive by any means, though."
"The body was way too thin for a Quad, it was pleasant and left a nice finish, but just didn't fill the palate the way I want. Drinkability was good, especially if you like an unidentifiable funk (and I do). Overall, this is one of those brews that I liked, but I didn't think fit the style. Worth trying when you see it."
""
""
""
"Poured into glass, looks like a berry fruit juice with a thin layer of white head that retains nicely. Heavy layer of lacing left behind. Near features heavy wave of Belgiany esters up front with notes of banana, clove , and bubble gum. Next comes a bit of bright and sweet cherry notes. This is my first foray into a concoction with coffee cherries. The taste is all Belgian quad up front with notes of candi sugar, banana, and grapes. The coffee cherry comes through next and provides a sweet fruity characteristic that has almost a chocolatey finish. Mouthfeel is light with mellow carbonation. Overall, a very sweet quad without a whole lot of depth and complexity. I'm not sure that the cascara style really adds anything new to this style aside from some added sweetness."
"O: Overall I was not a huge fan of the beer. It was very boozy and wasn't as smooth as I'd like. I did like that there was a uniqueness to the beer. I felt that the beer might be interesting to age, but that its current state is sub-par, and aging should not be used as a crutch. Belgian beer fans probably wouldn't enjoy this as much as drinkers who want to taste it for its unique ingredients (date sugar and coffee cherries). I would recommend it to those who want to try something different, and don't mind the taste of high-alcohol. For everyone else, I would recommend staying away."
"3.16/5.00"
""
""
"Not a good Quad, but interesting & would love to put a few back to age for a few years, this will pay dividends I bet. Give this at least a year, still too raw & off kilter, plus disjointed, in otherwords; pass for right now"
""
"Caution: This is a HOT brew. I'm talking hot, alcoholic flavour. So, if you don't want to taste that, don't put it into your mouth. If you're into that, go pick this up right now."
"Toasted caramel color with a fleeting etched surface with light tan foam. Smells like cherry cough syrup with some bits of cocoa and coffee, a little marshmallow and yeast as well. Very sweet, cherry, some nougat, some medicinal syrup, not really feeling this. Medium on thin for the style with tight, clean carb and a semi dry finish. One and done here"
""
"I'm torn on this, like a bad train wreck I have to keep looking at. I'm really impressed with the lacing. Yet, I have not mentioned anything about coffee-Where's the coffee? Would I buy this again-no, but dammit I just might."
""
""
""
"O: Just not impressed. You put 'Dates' and 'Cherries' and 'Coffee' on the label, thats what I'm going to expect to smell and taste. Call me crazy."
""
"O - This is a very interesting beer. Very unique."
"3.75/3.25/3.25/3.5/3.5"
""
"I'm not sure how sad it is, but beer teaches me more about the world than just about any other source. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset ruby-amber topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises medicinal cherry dust (which also kinda borders on plum at times...), Belgian candi sugar, light clove, banana, perfume-y flowers, and a smattering of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of coffee in the background and some lightly-toasted biscuit throughout. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, I don't feel the cascara really works all that well here, as it seemed to go sideways. Had that strange character not been there, ths probably could've been pretty nice, but c'est la vie, I s'pose."
"Pours a hazy, reddish-brown color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is packed with dark fruit aromas (dates, plums, raisins, figs). Light hints of cherry as well. Not really getting much of the coffee in the nose. To me, this one just smells like a Belgian-style Quad should smell. Very inviting aroma on this one. Taste is packed with the dark fruits as well. There is a nice alcohol warmth to it, as it is a bit boozy right now. Very tasty date and fig flavors come through, along with red grapes and black cherries. The coffee in this beer is VERY subtle. More booze in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I think a bit of age may do this beer well. It is a solid quad, but doesn't stand out too particularly from other quads. This one is quite boozy as well."
""
"22oz bottle served in a goblet. Pours a hazy amber with a thin off white head. Dark fruit in the aroma, also a bit of cinnamon. Medium bodied. A lot of malt sweetness. Some more dark fruit, a bit of cherry that comes out as it warms. Alcohol isn't readily apparent. Decent, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
"Can you say Cascara? Yes, please!!!!"
""
"I think a little more gravity would've done this beer a world of good, but it still has plenty going on to be worth the buy."
"O- 4 Overall seems better than the sum of its parts. Nice carbonation, great look but a little lacking in taste. Didn't cure my ""thirst"" but my head got fuzzy after killing the botle. It did get more complex once it warmed a bit, but I'd probably grab the Heavenly Feijoa (radically different style, I know) instead next time if I had to choose between the two, but I prefer the bretty-funkiness & tartness in most of my faves anyway."
""
"I always rush to pick up new lips of faith stuff. its been a really impressive series of beers, always pushing the limits. this one was strange. pours way lighter than I thought, medium amber brown with a pinkish hue and a tall fizzy soda looking white head. the nose is like gummy bears or something, sweet and fruity, not artificial, with lots of cherry, yeast, and booze. not a coffee beer per se, as a different part of the plan is apparently used here, but there are some mild coffee notes nevertheless. the flavor is dominated entirely by the date sugar used, which from my understanding is just crushed up dates. it really does have that sort of middle eastern feel to it, sweet in that way, but with the fruit its almost too much. its also aggressively boozy in both nose and taste, certainly all of 10% abv. its punishing, impossible to drink the whole bomber, so good thing I had some mates on deck here. we all agreed it would have been much better coming in closer to 7% abv. anyway, the finish is long and sweet, not sure id call it a quad in the traditional sense, but its a tasty and creative beer that's absolutely worth a try. the feel is really light for the style, not too much body at all. the carbonation is like a pepsi, big active bubbles, persistent. its an odd mix, but that's what we expect in this series. I was challenged by this, and I like it for that reason, but I wouldn't buy it again."
""
"Overall a pretty solid quad. It started off a little harsh but, as it warms, it begins to open up and soften into a nice cold night sipper."
