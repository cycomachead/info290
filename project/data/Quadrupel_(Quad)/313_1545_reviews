"Glad I have been able to have this twice, amazing!"
""
""
""
"I don't feel qualified to review this, but I was fortunate enough to get a 8,10,and 12.  They were all wonderful, burn a class of their own."
""
""
"Dark brown in color, white head tops it off. The head stay for a spell and fades to a thin ring. Fruity notes on the nose, raisins, figs and cherries come to mind. Sweet and malty to start then the fruity flavors come in to play. A bit bubbly in the mouth. A very nice Quad but I think there are better out there."
""
""
""
"Definitely the best quad I have ever had. Kind of blew me away since I figured it couldnt live up the the hype and it exceeded."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic nose, perfect mouthfeel, creamy and smooth with just the right level of carb. Flavor is amazing, rich, plum, raisins, apricot blend. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful fluffy head, dark brown. Malt and caramel aroma. Leans sweet, a bit high carbonation wise. A little smoke and spice with the malt. Improved on warming."
"One of the best beers ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"wonderful, but I gotta say I did this side by side by side with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 (could not tell a difference from SB12, yes I know why...) and Rochefort 10 wins my vote for the best of the 3.  All great, just personal preference..."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown color with a beige head. Aroma of dark fruit and spices. Taste is a mix of dark fruit, chocolate, spices and caramel. The alcohol is also present in the taste and enriches it. Very good beer, but the Rochefort 10 is slightly better in my opinion."
"It's nearly impossible to get this beer, but if you somehow come across it, you'll understand why there are nothing but 5's in my review. Easily the best beer I've ever had. I even aged a few, and the flavors were even more pronounced."
"Best beer in the world, hard to say...drink it with Belgian chocolate and I'm sold!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dried fruit nose, yeast, dark sugars. Pours brilliant chestnut with a persistent moussey tan tinted head. Caramel to toffee palate with dried fruit – raisins, honey, dark bread, faint anise and clove. Is very creamy with some alcohol on the finish and some light warming. Very rich with above average body and layers of flavor. Very fine malt flavors - especially caramel and toffee. Very well done, well rounded and balanced some very deep and interesting flavors."
""
""
"I had the beer at different locations, and different occasions. At ""le bon vieux temps", in bruxelles, and in Vleteren, and also from bottle shop in bruxelles. Incredible beer."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers.nice and and dark with a excellent fruit and sugar palate. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I wasn't sure about this one considering my past experiences with quads, I mean like them alright but this one certainly lives up to the hype and the complexities are there to a point I really cannot convey as well as others, but its well worth the ratings it once had as number 1 beer in the world and maybe should be closer than it used to be. I am just happy I had the opportunity to give it a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hype is real. Deep flavors. Beautiful aroma."
""
""
"The complexity of this beer has me in awe and in the winter a beer that one could live off of. Beautifully done."
"Well, if there's one thing that I can say separates this from other quads I've had and makes it worthy of the hype it's the great feel with each sip. Plenty of going on, but the creamy smoothness is worthy of numerous swirls and even then you'll be tempted to simply let the beer sit on your palate before saying good bye forever."

"O:  didn't get to drink a full bottle, but the sample was interesting -- side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12, it clearly came in third but was still very good.  the mustiness had a quality I tried and tried to place but couldn't other than to say musty."
"It puts a light brown with almost no head. The to maintains a thin white lace throughout. It smells rich, like a dessert. Loaded with dates and figs behind a musky funk. The taste follows the nose exactly. Sticky fruit with a sugary back round. The only thing keeping this from being a perfect taste is the backend is a little too sweet. Mouthful is medium thickness with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, had the sweetness on the back end been toned down it would have been a great beer but I was a little disappointed."
""
""
""
"Even with the hype, this beer truly manages to be outstanding. Nothing I could say can describe the experience. It's just a ridiculously enjoyable brew that will treat your senses."
"Friend shared 12oz bottle with me today. I don't have a lot of experience with Belgian style beers, but I could tell why this one is so highly rated. Really delicious"
"I have been wanting to try this for some time and finally acquired one as part of a bigger trade.  I always thought that maybe this beer was mostly hype and that it wasn't worth the trouble when I could easily get a Rochefort 10 or similar.  I was wrong.  It is amazing.  Dates and raisins and some complex yeast magic.  Almost made me swoon it is so good.  I ordered 6 from Belgium and happily paid the crazy shipping.  Forever ISO more."
""
""
"Finally trying this. Looks amazing, deep garnet highlights, ruddy body. Pillowing khaki creamy head. Coats the glass. Smell is fantastic, raisins, plums a little leather maybe hint of tobacco. Taste is chewy caramel with dark fruits and a little lingering sweetness, a bit of a vinous character save for the carbonation. Delicious. Crisp carbonation on a more than medium body, feels wonderful on the palate. I could drink k this beer every day of my life, but I like it as a rare treat. Simply amazing."
"Best beer I have ever had. It brought tears to my eyes. This is not like Pappy hype, this is real."
"Overall- This is the beer my wife and I used for out wedding toast. So it will always hold a special place in my heart. Plus there is a long story behind the beer. Always and Forever."

"I was fortunate enough to acquire six bottles of Westy 12 over the Xmas holiday.  All I can say is that this is by far the best example of a Belgian Quad that I have ever had.  Any Belgian for that matter.  It completely lives up to the hype.  the pour is nice with a tan head.  The smell has lots of dark stone fruits, rich toasted malt, maplely.  The taste just went through a rainbow of flavors, plums, raisins, dates, with maltiness, a little toastiness to name a few, with a light dry, very light hop finish.  It is incredibly complex, and continues to grow more and more complex with every sip, just building on the last.  Drink on the warmside, 50 to 55deg Fahrenheit. This beer is so smooooooooth. Just a fantastic beer.  It's one of my Top 3 Beers of all Time."
""
""
""
"This was my favorite of the three. This was just so incredibly smooth and easy to drink. It was everything i hoped for with all the hype around it. Can't wait to see how this one ages with the other two bottles i have."
""
""
"Thick, rich maple sap. Sweet raisins, ripe plum, bing cherries. Unbelievably smooth."
""
"The Rest:  Fantastic; super smooth and complex.  It was more bitter than I expecting and had less Belgian yest character, but was  a real treat none the less."
""
"Bit of a grape smell, unfiltered with lots of particulate. Very good, well worth the extra $ spent."
"This is really fantastic.  I really, really dislike Quads, and this is delightful.  Again, it's similar to Kvass, and so I'm really digging it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is damn interesting,  when cold it has dark raisiny smell and taste then as it warms it starts to smell exactly like grape Kool-aid!  and the flavour deepens to a phenolic warm boozy quad!  Epic beer but....... not sure its the best.  La Trappe quad is perhaps the best quad!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful dark fruits and warming alcohol."
""
""
""
"Got another bottle that will be aged."

"Bottle from the cellar, marked 27-03-15. Dark reddish root beer brown with five fingers of sudsy beige foam. Rich sweet nose: Milk chocolate, sultanas, rum toffee,  faint clove, banana chips, strawberry, subdued grassy hops. The aroma does live up to the hype. And the taste? I do understand the comparisons with St. Bernardus Abt 12 (allegedly these beers are the same recipe, different yeast strain). A supremely well-integrated combination of toffee/candy sugar, carob, molasses, cooked fruit (pears and mixed berries), clove-like phenols, licorice, grapes, root beer extract, ginger, plum liquor ... Heady alcohol bloom is the icing on the cake. Although the initial sips are sharply medicinal and boozy, the beer mellows in the glass and on the palate such that the great nuances shine though. Curiously dry and ""drinkable"" with a lighter than expected body and rather prickly mouthfeel. Some floral hops poke out in the otherwise cacao-like malty finish. Red berry and currant flavors are lingering long after my glass is empty. ""Best beer in the world"" is not a debate that can ever truly be resolved but this is certainly worthy of the accolades bestowed. Maybe the rarity factor used to play a role here ... With improved availability will the hype wither a bit? Not sure it matters. Worthy of its place in the Trappist pantheon."

"This beer is the real deal and worthy of the hype. The nose was disappointing and it's not much to look at but other than that, this one is close to perfect."

"Not overly impressed with this beer, but it is still really nice. I would probably prefer trios pistoles if I were to grab a Belgian strong dark again. And at 30$... Hmmm I don't know. But. I'm glad I tried this."

"these beer is awesome, taste so well, body is strong, fruity aroma. when you try it  you will get in love  with this beer, the best beer i have ever tasted, i cant get enough of these beer. want more. its like your tongue its getting rape with pure awesomeness. its a must drink before you die."

"Big, Fruity and Robust. Also Smooth, Tasty and Enjoyable... Ridiculously drinkable at +10% waves of Dark Fruit, Brown Sugar, Cream Soda, Vanilla, Oak, Cinnamon and Caramel slap the palette. Undertones of Yeast, Grapes, Chocolate, Cherry, Clove and Nut are present. Butterscotch, Banana, Licorice, Fig and Tobacco can be picked up in the after taste. The aroma is much like Christmas spice with Plums, Brandy, and Wine being picked up. The feel is medium and bubbly. I really can't pick out a flaw, may be a bit 'too much' (complexity and ABV) for a novice, other wise I don't have a single bad thing to say. Overall this brew is amazing and well worth the hunt~"

"2010 vintage. Pours dark brown, very little white head. Smell: dark fruit, plum, sweet Carmel, cream brûlée , some vanilla .Taste:  wow, amazing. A lot like the nose, caramel, plum, some dark cherry,vanilla, perfect sweetness.  Mouth feel: scary drinkable, slight creaminess, not a lot of carb, not as thick as I expected.  Overall: I did this side by side with abt 10 and roch 12, and this was a clear winner. I will admit that this is the only aged bottle but wow does this live up. Doing it side by side to fresh bottles show how amazingly the beer ages.  usually after 4 years a beer's flavors have blended TOO well, but this is magic. So happy to finally have opened this. The beauty of this beer lies in its world-class balance."

"In order to properly rate this beer, one must also consider the journey that is required to enjoy this brew at its home in Westvleteren, Belgium. The fruity, complex taste is complemented by the atmosphere of enjoying this in the hop fields of western Belgium. I highly recommend taking the trip to Westvleteren in order to enjoy one of the best beers that I have ever had the privilege of tasting. It is truly a pilgrimage that should be taken by every serious beer lover."

"Rich roasted, earthy malts, plums, walnuts and hazelnuts, hints of chocolate, very complex beer. Malts turn sweeter, in a honeyed fashion, supported by chocolate and wood. Fitting carbonation helps the body from becoming too heavy - adds refreshment. Full-bodied, complex beer, pleasantly sweet with a unique character, turning into an earthy direction with hints of chocolate in it. Very smooth mouthfeel, a little oily. Warm, slightly bitter, coffeeish finish."

"O: There are no short of reviews for this beer and chances are this won’t convince you to try or not try this beer, however if you can get the beer without too much trouble - get it. Not nearly as alcohol forward as I’ve heard and I wasn’t prepared for the yeasty bread flavor that made this very interesting and more drinkable. I’ll be curious to see how my other bottles age."

"Had better quads (especially for the price paid) but still a great beer"
""
""
"O: A really decadent beer, best used during the dessert course or perhaps as an after dinner drink. As fine a quadrupel as any I have ever tried, and perhaps the best. Since I have only had this beer once, I resist the temptation of declaring it the best. But certainly right up there with Rochefort 12 and St. Bernardus 12."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Complex still very light, high abv but not so invasive. The chocolate predominance is a good surprise, making this beer unique in it style. More delicate than Rochefort 10, but with all complexity makes a perfect balanced quad, a wonderful style, but too extreme for some. I really like Quadrupel style in all its complexity and Westvleteren XII is a perfect Quadrupel."

"Tasting this beer at all was a convergence of split second timing, vacation angst, and dumb luck. Google led me to the only bar in Brussels that served it, a gorgeous place built in the 1400's I think (and last painted in the 1600's I would wager). Perhaps it was the road weary barmaid or the loco dude siting to my right who was deep into a political debate with someone sitting between us that only he could see, but I hate to say that I was not that impressed. The beer is very complex with deep malty flavors, alcohol forward, caramel and nuts, nice bitterness, but it tasted like every other quad I've ever had. And it was served at what I would call spit-warm cellar temp, which seemed wrong. If I ever find myself in Belgium again, I'm going to the brewery. No more f'ing around, because I believe in second chances."

"O: I did a taste test, westy 12 vs rochefort 10. I regret not adding more quads like st bernardus 12 because it was fun comparing. I can see how this beer lives up to its hype. It's one of the best beers in the world and Im very fortunate to have been given this amazing opportunity. I'm happy to report beer doesn't get better than this. Makes me want to visit Belgium."

"O: Amazing how such complex flavors and aromas can be contained in such a concise package. It is almost impossible to live up to the hype that this beer has, but by far the best example of the style I've ever had. Those monks at Saint Sixtus know what they're doing."
"Pours a deep purple with a bit of haze and no head to speak of. Nose is a raisin bomb with very complex notes in the aroma. Notes of vanilla, leather, dates, grapes, and candied fruit all come through with a hint of brown sugar in the background. Taste starts out with malty sweetness which comes off as being quite smooth. The sweetness is reminiscent of candied grapes with notes of caramel and a nice cinnamon raisin bread. Flavors are balanced beautifully, which I'm sure is in part due to the age of this beer. Mouthfeel is mellow and smooth. Overall, this beer was quite the treat, now I just need to give it a try fresh."

"For the first few years I was on this site, it was considered the Holy Grail beer. I have drank it before but never rated it, but this one is utterly phenomenal. Even if not the best beer in the world, it lives up to its hype. Apparently six years isn't too long to age it either. Absolutely wonderful and I hope I get the chance to drink another one of these again."

"Rich maltiness with brown bread and mild spiciness from phenols and moderate bitterness. Fig, raisin, nutty chocolate, clove, mild roast, medicinal notes, and candi sugar leftovers. Pleasantly, on the dry side. So much going on, and nothing that really dominates. A hearty brew with savory notes and an immense body of endless size and smoothness. So brothy in flavor and in feel. Nice bubble pop here and there in the mouth. Incredible feel."

"Final Word: For the price, I found this beer to be surprisingly straightforward and simple. The flavors were good (though the buttery characteristic could be a sign that my bottle wasn’t in peak shape), but they didn’t seem to mesh very well or stick around very long. I count myself lucky to have even gotten the chance to try a bottle, but find that I am completely unwilling to pay the steep price for another bottle. I’ve had plenty of beers with big price tags that were absolutely worth the price of entry, but I wouldn’t count this one among them. It simply lacked that euphoric “Wow!” that I’ve gotten from other top tier beers that I’ve tasted. When you pay $20+ for an 11.2oz. bottle, the reaction should never be indifference or disappointment. Again, I’ve found that very few reviewers of this beer include the butter/butterscotch flavor that I experienced in their profiles, which could point to my bottle being sub par due to shipping, temperature, or time, but at the same time I tasted what I tasted, and it was unfortunately disappointing given the price tag. This beer is far from bad, but it did not live up to its reputation as the best beer in the world, as the flavors weren’t full enough, and seemed to stand apart from each other instead of existing in harmony. If you get the chance to pick one up, it might be worth it just to say you’ve had it, but honestly I worry that this reasoning is what drives many people to buy it. Rarity doesn’t necessarily equal quality, and while this beer was still tasty, I found that Rochefort 10 not only gave it a run for its money, but was actually preferred by me. Check for freshness before you buy."

"O: First time to have this was Dec 19th, 2013. I Drank it in China with wife. Got a sixer at In De Verde. Surprised at the dryness, probably needs no aging but will give aging it a try. Great scent, tastes like an already aged beer."

"My beer guru had someone pick this up and he was gracious enough to share. This one definitely lived up to the hype. I suppose that maybe now I know what the style is meant to taste. Very little to complain about, clean, tasty and smooth. I really want to go back through some of the other beers I gave great ratings to and compare."

"On the whole, this is a monumental beer and without a doubt the best quad I've ever had. That said...Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus Abt 12 give Westvleteren XII a real run for its money--and factoring in accessibility, it's hardly even a contest. All that said, this is still a spectacular beer, and one well worth hunting down."

"My brother hooked me up with a 6-pack directly from the abbey in Belgium. Poured from the virtually unmarked bottle into a tulip glass. Formed a thin off-white head over the dark plum colored beer. SO many aromas from this beer... dried fruit, malt, molasses, etc. The flavors are surprisingly smooth with almost no off taste from the high ABV. This was a sweet, sweet brew that I could not believe was so high gravity. I could imagine sitting at the abbey and drinking these all day long... but that would probably be a bad plan!"

"Pours an almost opaque burgundy with a white head. no lacing on my tulip glass. aroma is typical of quads. yeast is musty. ripe dark fruits and dark Belgium sugars. flavor is slightly boozy with flavor of dried dark fruit, anise and brown sugar. as it warmed the alcohol became much more present. medium body, heavy carbonation and a slight bitter finish."

"This was a 2012 vintage, consumed in 2013. Absolutely beautiful - this was the best Belgian I have ever tried, without question. Very rich, complex flavor, with notes of raisin, plum, dates, toffee, a little chocolate and much more. Dark, rich, full-bodied and complex. A stunning beer."

"O: Unlike any other quads, Westy is unabashed in its bold approach to the complexity and mix of sweet, spices, yeasts, earthiness and alcohol presence. It's complexity is worth the price point and effort to search it out. The drink is worth sharing with another BA who'll enjoy and appreciate the experience & appreciate the complexity compared to quads. Good to note - Westy pairs incredibly well with strong cheese, dried fruit and a good BA buddy, do yourself a favour and get one to enjoy and savour."

"From the 2012 American release. Pours a hazy chestnut, lots of sediment, with a thick, off-white head that diminishes to a frothy cap that remained throughout. The aroma is full of dark fruits, brown sugar, malt, and warm spices. On the palate there's the dark fruit, but unlike the aroma, these are reminiscent of holiday fruit-cake dark fruits - sweet, but not cloyingly so. Nice bready malt with hints of clove. The 10% ABV adds a nice warming feeling but doesn't overwhelm. Velvety, medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a very complex and well crafted quad. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but hunting this down is hardly worth the effort with so many other readily available outstanding quads, especially Rochefort and St. Bernardus."
""
""
""
"Overall: Truly a unique beer. Very interesting sweet flavors and a milder yet still somewhat sweet aroma. Definitely worth trying. I'd drink again if I found the opportunity - a great experience."
"Bottle from GBBF 2013. Well done to the international bar for sourcing these. Drunk on Bank Holiday Monday August 26th 2013. First sniff from the bottle and this is surprisingly beery and malt grainy. Not the overpowering hit of alcoholic complexity I was expecting. Pours dark reddish brown, with some nice reddish clarity in the glass. Thin off white bubbly head. First full on aroma is very malty. Caramel, ripe fruit, particularly a banana estery aroma, dark rye bread. Lots of banana and caramel, ripe plums. Taste is tangy and estery, but surprisingly quaffable and drinkable. It’s caramel, banana estery, some light dark fruit, plums and a bit of brandy or cognac alcoholic kick on the finish, with some of that black rye bread. Texture is medium, not heavy really, and it’s quite sticky and sweet. It’s less complex and heavy than Rochefort 10, but way more drinkable IMHO. I really like it. Could knock one of these back every day. 17.01.14 - comparison with St. Bernardus Abt 12. The Westy is definitely maltier and dryer compared to the fruit of the St. B. and the Westy 12 has a beautiful malty banana nose, which out-rates the St B. The Westy 12 although more subtle does have a bigger alcoholic kick than the St B though."

"I am stunned by this beer. It is most definitely the best in the style that I have tasted, and the thing that continues to impress the the subtlety mixed with the strength and power of this beer. Well-balanced, full-bodied, powerful aroma and rich flavors, yet gentle on the palate, smooth, fine, and would age more than gracefully. This is a beer that deserves all the praise and were I more local, I would make the reservation necessary to buy a whole case of this."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer is how it handles your expectations of it. You go into it expecting this insane, flavor-bomb of power that will forever change your views and opinions of beers. You don’t really get that. The real magic of this beer is in just how simple and clean the execution of it is. The balance is unsullied, with the booze and the malt bill meeting for a beautiful dance in the center of the room. They just take their recipe and should you how it’s done, without the need for any bells, whistles, or unnecessary flair or novelty. This beer is all about harmony, and doing the right thing at the right time. The nose and the flavoring both embody this mantra naturally and intrinsically, so it comes as an even bigger surprise when the mouthfeel comes crashing in unfettered. It is so thick and creamy, creeping along like molten lava, acting like the perfect delivery vessel for the bold cleanliness of flavoring. This is an exercise is technique, and although some may be disappointed by the flavoring alone not taking them into the clouds, one must sit back and appreciate the art of the craft and what it means to strive for brewing perfection. Hard to track down, but well worth it if you want to taste what a fantastic beer is made from."

"Don't make the mistake of trying this as your first Belgian Dark Ale, you'll be ruined. This is a great beer but just really tough to find in the U.S. Has a great spicy taste on your tongue and goes down great with some salami and cheese.

"I gave this excellent ratings. only the smell is lower due to the fact I cannot smell much, but that alone is also a great quality-nothing overpowering, ya know? I realize I gave the st. bernardus a higher rating but that was back when I was less refined and experienced and I was blown away with the beer. I haven't had a st bernardus in a while, and maybe it's time to try one (maybe side by side with the west12?) but from memory, this is a smoother, more stable, taste and I really think this is better in my opinion."

"Loved the mouthful caramel malty flavor. A very complex flavor with a rather deep finish.

"Our group of 4 Beer Advocate members did a recent small bottle tasting of high alcohol brews. Among the 12 brews tasted was; Westvleteren XII Quadrupel. We did a direct comparison tasting of the Westvleteren XII against the Rochefort 10. The Rochefort 10 was chosen the better 3 to 1, and tied for 4th highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.25. Smoothness being the deciding factor between the the Rochefort 10 and the Westvleteren XII. The Westvleteren XII came in 9th of the 12 brews tasted with an average score of at 3.81."

"Overall: It lives up to the hype and I'm so glad I had a chance to partake. It's a must try."
"As a comparison, I love St. Bernardus 12, but I don’t know why there are those who compare the two together… unless there like me. That is, saw others were doing it, so you in turn do it yourself. My take is that these Belgians bring different things to the table, and although I love St. Bernardus 12 I would take Westy 12 over it any day."

If I'm not being tricked, then I'm a healthy mix of bewilder-pissed. Not since watching The Happening and feeling a palpable loss of all respect for M. Night have I been this bewildered. Prankster Monk possibility aside, this is one ""world class"" beer that's hitting my fucking drain."

"Overall - Slightly disappointing, as I've heard so much hype of this being at least on par with and better in some people's eye with St Bernadus Abt 12 and Rochefort 10, two of my absolute favorite beers. Clearly a world class beer that was immensely enjoyable, but a beer that really needs to be served at the correct temperature, since so much of its aromas and flavors are released at higher temperatures even compared with the other two aforementioned quads. Really glad I tried it, but probably won't seek another until there's another momentous event in life."

"This is a very good beer. I like it old however. Opening this beer fresh is a waste of time and money. It is like drinking it with only 50% of its potential.

"So, here are the details: Westvleteren 12 is a moderately deep amber, very clear (much more than the relatively cloudy Rochefort). Smell is boozy, raisins, maybe a little banana. Rochefort is more of a caramel scent. The taste of the Westy will initially throw you, striking you as overly bitter at first. As other reviewers have pointed out, you may not like this one on the first taste but it will quickly win you over. It has an extremely complex flavor. I would not say this is a ""fruity"" beer but there are fruit notes, along with wood and maybe even a little smoke. The finish is warm but not boozy. Perfect beer. If you are lucky enough to get some, do it justice: serve it around 60F in a perfectly clean glass, pour it carefully to avoid the sediment, have a clean palate, etc. I must say I cannot disagree that this is possibly the best beer in the world."

"From a bottle. Pours dark reddish brown with a massive beige head. Aromas of dried fruit, plum and apple. Very complex flavors! Apple, raisin, brown sugar, candied fruit and chocolate cake. Finishes with subtle flavors of chocolate, coffee, perhaps a touch of licorice. Fruitier than I expected, but very nice. Very light mouthfeel for such a big, flavorful beer. Delicious!"
""
"There's no doubt that the overall experience is enhanced by the beer's scarcity. However, taken by itself and tasted blindly, I have no doubt that ""Westy"" would remain stellar. While I'd stop short of calling ANY beer ""the best in the world", this one is among the best. To this lucky drinker, it's earned and lived up to the hype."

"Pours a very opaque, dark brown. You can’t see through this one. A finger of off white head that lingers a bit. Decent amount of sticky lacing. The nose is well, incredible. There is so much going on. A lot of malt and Dark fruits, mainly plum, fig and raisin. A lot of pear, sparkling grape and orange zest. Caramel, spice, nutmeg, cloves and a unique sparkling wine/brandy combo. The alcohol is present but subtle. Than there is the mouth. Much of the same going on here. A huge malt backbone with a lot of dark fruits up front that fade immediately into a sweet caramel, almost creamy butterscotch like flavor. Nutmeg and cloves blended in perfectly again with that alcohol/wine mix followed with some licorice. Very smooth finish. Best beer in the world? Yes. Definitely!"

"O: A delightful beer; a lot of complexity in the aroma - maybe one of the best aromas on a beer I've experienced; taste is not quite on the same level, although still very good and satisfying; mouthfeel is a bit lighter than expected, but helps bring this 10.2% to more drinkable levels. Glad I stumbled upon this and was able to try it!"
"OVERALL- This is not only an extraordinarily well-made beer, but really quintessentially ""Trappist"". I have now sampled beer from every Trappist brewery and I don't know if it is for better or worse that most will try this one last because it makes you realize what the other breweries are aiming at. It has that semi-sweet (never dry, never cloying, but teasing you with moments of both), lightly tangy quality that must surely come from the sugar usage. Like all great strong beers, it is dangerously drinkable and unlike so many US big beers or ""extreme"" beers, it is not intense in any regard really. The alcohol comes on a bit strong at times, and so it is possible that aging this beer might be wise, but I'd hate to lose the wonderfully fresh malt and ester qualities that really make it sparkle. Belgian and Trappist beer fans would do well to seek this out, but those looking to get their minds blown by an intense beer would do better to spend their time and money pursuing something state-side."

"Translucent brown with shimmering ruby hues, and a thick, tightly-laced, creamy, sticky head above. Similar aroma as the other Westys; a complex, deep malted nose of carob, toffee and honey. Massive creamy buildup on the palate, as the tight carbonation hits the warmth of the mouth. Silky smooth, with a dry, medium, even body. Again with the powdery feel. Interesting twang of grapes. Dextrin sweetness. More carob, golden syrup, blossom honey, toffee, medicinal phenols, anise, ginger, booze-soaked golden raisins, raw candi sugar and a watery, slightly fruity currant character. Alcohol on this one is quite boozy and warming. Bone-dry, powdery, with a residual cocoa character and alcohol breath."

"Beer features a body of medium weight with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a very soft, foamy mouthfeel that would complement any beer quite well. Ethanol is felt on the nostrils, tongue, and back of the throat, but only in a marginal way, surprising for a 10% ABV beer. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate and lips."

"a deep brown pour with 2 fingers of off-white head which diminished slowly and gave off great amounts of lacing. aromas of dark roasted grains, molasses, bready yeast, dark fruits (plum/raisins), chocolate. the flavor is much like the aroma, except there is a nice warmth from the abv. lots of bready chocolate.. almost rye notes. lots of dark fruit flavor as well. as far as quads go, this is great.. not TOO sweet, and right up my alley. as far as considering this the best beer in the world or whatever, meh.. it's just not what i would consider, not even the style really. full body with modest amount of carbonation. a nice warming feeling from the alochol."

For me, it gets in the way of the sweet, rich, dessert-like qualities of the beer. Some BAs will disagree, but that's just my palate. Also, I definitely taste the similarities between this and St. Bernardus Abt 12 (although this one is a little spicier). Anything else? Oh, yeah. Highly, highly recommended every BA try this at least once (if at all possible)."
"Overall: I'll try to keep this short: It lives up to the hype. Honestly I had the mindset that there really couldn't be a much better quad than a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus ABT 12, but all hype aside, this is the better beer. I would love to do a blind test just to make sure... This one is so much lighter in feel but without sacrificing flavor or anything for that matter. It seems to emphasize the bready, biscuity characteristics instead of being dark fruit dominant like other quads. And I guess you can attribute it to the stellar brewing craftsmanship of the monks, but the alcohol in this is even less apparent, you could almost think you were drinking a trippel. Throughly impressed, waiting to try my 3rd one, and hopefully the other's once I make it out to Belgium again."

"Bottle thanks to Zathrus13. I can’t add anything the other 1783 raters didn’t already cover. I would like to say that I am pleasantly surprised with the complexity of this ale. I am really diggin the dark fruits (fig, plum, raisin), spices, alcohol, and Belgian candies. Oh brother, I need to fly to Belgium and spend a week or two defiling my liver.."

" Finishes with waves of sweet dark malt, apricot brandy, and the quintessential Trappist funk. While it seems sinful to imbibe more than one Westy 12 in a session, I could imagine drinking 3 maximum before the sweetness becomes overpowering. I waited too long to drink this masterpiece, but even in its ripe old age, the beer is exquisite and deserves the praise it receives."

"From bottle at In de Vreede, September 2012. Pours a deep amber color with a big rocky head. Aromas of figs, plums, candi sugar, dark chocolate, and dates. The palate is rich with fine carbonation and flavors of molasses, plum, raisins, spice, and some caramel. Finishes semi dry and not overly sticky. Well balanced."

"Worth a try, for sure. Lucky enough to be in Belgium during the time of this review but the vintage bottle still broke the bank. I like them both, but prefer it with age. My guess would be that four years, somewhere in the middle of these two vintages... Could be perfection. Taking a couple fresh bottles home with me, time will tell!"
"Well, I went into this one with high expectations this past Father's Day as I had this with my dad as his gift. My straight honest opinion was this was not the best Trappist beer I've ever had. The dark fruits and spicy notes came through fully, but did not floor me as ""the best beer in the world"". The hype definitely comes from it's limited availability methinks."

"I'm torn on this review. I believe a beer should be nearing high marks even if it requires age at a year. I however have been told 3 years is where this one needs to be. I just can't justify not marking a beer off for wanting 3 years of cellaring to drink. That said this is complex as hell, the flavors are well balanced and well put together. With that said it's not for me. The flavors will mellow and blend more but the end result will still be a beer that's too sugary and has spices that I can pass on."

"Malty, dark, sweet and lingering ending that absolutely invited another drink. And then another. I did a side by side comparison with St. Bernardus abt 12 and it was then that the complexity of the westy really shined. The St.B seemed almost thin compared to the rich flavors of the westy. It's a contemplative beer that invites a slow enjoyment. It'd be heaven with roast fowl and autumn chill."

"Overall: I like this. Really happy I was able to try it, but ultimately I do think I like Rochefort 10 the most of the big quads. I'll have to pick up another one of those to try again and determine. Regardless, this one really surprised me with the slight funk and sour fruit notes, alongside the normal quad flavors. A great beer."

"O: Very different from how I remember this one from years ago. I remember noting how the alcohol was completely hidden but in this one there is a lot of alcohol phenols in the aroma and aftertaste. Having said that, this is easily the best quad I've had. Very nice flavors all integrated with each other. Balance is excellent, drinkability is excellent. I look forward to re-reviewing an aged bottle at some point, I feel like this one might be too green given the alcohol harshness."

"O - some of these authentic Trappist ales make me think to myself that if I didn't have 2 beautiful little boys at home I'd move to Belgium and take up a life of prayer, a life of work, and a life in a community while wearing wool robes. Just as long as I got to drink stuff like this everyday. But hey I wouldn't trade my family for anything so I quickly come back to reality. Anyway, this is the God Father of all the Trappist brews and the King of fine Belgian ales in general. It has a rep that's nearly unmatched and often great Trappist brews are overlooked due to the mystery and the need to know that comes with the Westy 12. It's definitely one of the best crafted brews on the planet, but aren't all Trappist ales? It's the world's best quad, but is it that much better than the Rochefort 10? Yes to me it is, but its not on a whole different level. Both are in that top tier of best quads. What the Westy 12 does offer are flavors no other quad provide and an experience every craft beer lover deserves to have. In fact an experience everyone deserves to have over and over again. It's a shame this thing isn't easier to get ahold of. Bc its easily not only one of the best I've ever had, but would be one of my favorites to pick up throughout every year. Ill definitely be paying close attention for my next experience of this Belgian gem."

"Overall: Incredible quad, one of the best beers I have ever had. I thought it was all hype and came in with a jaundiced eye, but this one really blew me away, which was an incredibly nice surprise. It's not that the specific flavours in this beer were especially great compared to other quads that I've had, but it all came together incredibly well. I think that's the difference between this beer and all the others. (4.75)"
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"Overall Impression: This is the Quad to end all Quads. An immediate dark fruit punch in the mouth with slowly developing dark malt and yeast character that somehow manages to stay medium bodied and a slightly dry finish. Although it is very similar in taste to most well made quads, its nimble body and drying finish take the Westy XII to another level. This is a malt bomb that is amazingly drinkable."
""
""
""
"It seems there are a lot of beers in the top of the list that've climbed by inertia (especially the top beer). This isn't one of them. A couple hundred years of trial and error, coupled by the fact that the brewers don't make a profit...at least monetarily speaking, makes this one of the most interesting and satisfying experiences you can have imbibing a brew."

"O. I was less than impressed with this bottle. There are a lot of easier-to-get Trappist quads that are better than this."
""
"Picked up a bottle in a swap for some BT last year. Split it with the wife, pouring into a pair of tulips. It fizzed up quite a bit, like a soda, and then quickly dissipated into a thin head with a rich, deep caramel color base. The nose was perfectly sweet, with strong notes of candied figs and dates. For a quad, I was surprised at how mellow and sweet it was, rather than dark and powerful. I thought it was really drinkable for a 10%, and could easily put down more than one bottle if afforded the opportunity. The alcohol was warm, but not overpowering. It had a bold feel, but not chokingly strong. Again, mellow was the word I kept thinking of, with a bit of a sticky finality that I think was more in my head from the fruit smell/taste than actually having me smacking my lips. Overall, I was afraid after all the hype I would be slightly disappointed, but it was actually the opposite. I was even more impressed with this than I hoped I could be. Absolutely worth going out of your way to enjoy."

I didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but it's the best quad I've had to date. It even makes me optimistic about trying quads again."

"O-Hype notwithstanding, I was blown away by how complex and pleasing the flavors were in this beer. I know there is some debate about whether this brew is really better than Rochefort or St. Bernardus (or De Struise or...whatever), but for me, it really hits all the sweet spots. I mean that literally and figuratively because the beer really is quite sweet, but unlike some others, I did not feel this was cloying or syrupy."
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer, but I feel that it is wildly overrated based on it limited availability. Maybe I should have let it sit longer, but I feel like it should be good fresh as well considering all the hype surrounding it. A pretty big letdown but I guess my expectations were quite high. I I compared this to Abt 12 which I found to be superior."

"WOW, I couldn't believe I ran into a bottle of this. I am by far not as big a beer snob as some of you, but I love to try and share beer when I get it. This beer goes beyond complex. Each and every sip I took I got a different experience of flavors. The owner of the place I got it from took out a bottle, poured it into a westy12 glass and the head just kept on going thru the tip of the glass, and staying there. Took a frew big, deep breaths into my nose and trying to get a hint of anything going on off the top of the glass. Sipped it, took a bigger sip and let it sit in my mouth, trying to get some of the initial tastes."

"O: This is a superior beer. I hemmed and hawed as to whether I should actually pay the price for this, and in the end, it was well worth it (and quite reasonable considering). I prefer Belgian quads and tripels so to me this is like nirvana. What was surprising and pleasant was the complexity of the smell/taste. The fruitiness hid the yeast and the alcohol stayed in the background until the end. I've had Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Westvleteren just reaches above those making it well worth the chase."

"O: I drank the three other quads referenced in this review within 9 days of finally drinking this one and, I'll admit, I struggle to separate my review from the beer's mystique.

"at long long last, I finally got my chance to try this beauty. a friend of a friend lucked out when it came to the states, shared a bottle, and I was invited. the anticipation was obviously huge here, and the beer met all expectations. this pours a lighter brown color with plenty of fish food yeast floaters and maybe a finger or two of tan airy froth. the nose is remarkably complex, lots of interesting dried fruits and that classic Belgian yeast. it also smells pretty sweet, like brown sugar or molasses, and just a clue about its strength. the flavor immediately reminds me of Ramadan. dried figs and dates, raisins, and bready yeast, its got a lovely buttery component, and seems somehow understated compared to what my palates definition of a quad is, recognizing of course that this is THE quad of quads, and this is a personal definitional problem, rather than a shortcoming of this particular brew. its layered and refined, and dangerously drinkable. the body is light, still medium probably, but it doesn't feel heavy or sticky or filling at all. the carbonation is ultra bright, and the flavors come one after the other throughout the entire drink until well after the swallow. this beer is famous and renowned for a reason, it is of the highest quality. I am maybe most impressed by how well the alcohol is hidden. one would never know this beer is so strong. one of those rare moments when you feel a connection with people you have never and may never meet. this beer is like a brotherhood of sorts, and I am humbled and honored to be a part of it now."

"This certainly lives up to the hype. Just sweet enough with the perfect balance of flavors and not a hint of alcohol after the smell. Glad to finally try this and would happily welcome another."
"This beer absolutely lives up to the hype and perhaps even exceeds my expectations. A picture of this beer should appear next to the definition for ""world class"" in the dictionary.

Thank for sending this treat along Joe!!"

"Time to move on from the blond and the dubbel and hit up the quad I drove out to the middle of nowhere to try. Notes from tasting fresh at the brewery in Dec 2010, bottle cap reads 04.08.13. Poured the bottle into the Westvleteren chalice this beer has a thick tight tan head that has some staying power and laces the glass. Dark brown to black on top, lighter brown color noted towards the thin bottom. Aromas are toasted barley malt, with a chocolate characteristic. Great mouthfeel. Complex, very smooth with the alcohol hidden amongst all the other flavors. Super drinkable for such a high ABV beverage. The complexity of this beer is quite great, this is definitely the best of the 3 beers. Compared to the other great quads of Belgium I'd put this one in the world class category but a notch below St. Benardus Abt. 12 given slightly less estery goodness and the price and availability issue. Well now that I'm here I better have another...I might never get another."

"Was this a world class, complex, easy drinking belgian? Absolutely yes. Was it the best beer in the world? That's debatable. I could see it holding that title a few years back, but now that it has competitors with similar (if not better) taste profiles, I think not. Don't get me wrong, this beer was amazing. Anyone who has access to it needs to try it at least once. But it's price and rarity are a sky high, and if you can't get a hold of one don't lose sleep over it."

Great subtle smell with lots of dried fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very nice--slightly dank with more fruits and a touch of sweetness. The real strength of this beer is the mouthfeel, in my opinion--super-soft and almost creamy. Well-balanced, overall. This is one of my new favorites; too bad it's so pricy and hard-to-get!"
"I dropped some cash and purchased some of this from a reputably shop online and was really happy with my purchase.

Truly a great beer from the ""Westy Lads..."""

"We lined up two bottles of St Bernardus Abt 12 afterwards for comparison. Extremely similar but the Westy is noticeably better in almost every respect. Prior to this, the St. Bernardus Abt 12 was probably my favorite beer and I was blown away by how good the Westvleteren 12 was. I did not expect it to live up to the reputation, but it did and I'm happy to cross this off the bucket list."

"Just my opinion...I have seen the reviews of this beer fall after the sale of the gift packs in the US. I must say that those who rushed into drinking one right away missed out. I know it must have been very difficult to wait however, to let this beer ripen for a few years one would find a more earthy, well balanced flavor, without the alcohol burn at the end. I love this beer, just opened a bottle dated 14/12/14 which I bought at the Abby in 2011 and based it against one bought last month. The favors of the fruits are more pronounced/distinctive throughout. If you have any left, store it properly and let it sit for a few years, then review it again."

"Update (2/10/2014): Recently got to try a non-brick bottle recently, courtesy of jdhowe. This is terrific - the aroma has been bumped up slightly, as the bottles that are exclusive to Belgium display a funky, yeasty characteristic - like a freshly cut green apple or pear. The beauty really IS in the yeast with this beer, and undeniably puts it far apart from the other Trappist beers as the dark horse of the bunch."

"Sharing this beer with other people might have lessened my thoughts on it a little bit since I only got about 4 oz. of it, but with it being so rare, I had to share it with friends in order to compensate for the cost of it."
""
""
"So, is this the ""best beer in the world"" ? No. Well, in my opinion, anyway. BUT - I can definitely see why some people might agree with that, and I can definitely say that it deserves to be in the discussion. Even though it doesn't necessary top my list, it's certainly one of the best and most well crafted beers I've had, and no doubt a benchmark example of the style. If you love beer, do yourself a favor and seek one of these out. It was really an amazing beer, and the experience of enjoying it for yourself (or with a friend) is excellent."

"Overall: Not a huge fan of Belgiums but this is a nice beer. Complex yet nicely balanced :)"
"Overall- This is exactly what a Belgian quad should taste like. Really amazing beer. I wouldn't say it's the best beer in the world, but certainly the standard when it comes to Belgian quads."
""
"Overall: Very, very good. I need to have another go around with the other quads, but I don't really think the style is my thing. Still, I can see how this might appeal to a lot of people. Either way, enjoyed this one!"
"Overall - an amazing offering! I'm so glad I was able to try this and the birth of my second son is the best reason ever to crack it open."

"Overall: World-class quad. Happy to have had the opportunity to taste it. I don't think it blows all other Trapist quads out of the water, but it definitely has a stake in the ""best quad in the world"" contest. Hard to say it is that much better than Rochefort 10 though, so given the availability of the latter, I'm not sure it's worth the trouble and price of going after more than once."

"Overall- It is a disappointment but my curiosity is settled some. I will have to try another bottle to see if my initial tasting was tainted. I will also have to get some Rochefort 10 and Bernardus Abt 12 to compare. Also, I am now reading online that I may be trying this beer “too new.” It has 14.11.15 stamped on the cap which would be November 14, 2015. A poster on Beer Advocate suggested that the bottling is three years previous to this date which would make the bottle that I'm drinking only 2 and a half months old. The ideal suggested age is 3 years. And I thought I was being impatient."

"On the whole, a beer I was super excited to try, and the quality lived up to the hype."

"O: This beer succeeds where Rochefort 10 fails. 10 is a very good beer but can be a bit messy at times in the taste and feel department. But this beer fails at its whalez status. I could session this beer alll day."

"Dark bread, fig paste, vanilla bean, tart cherry, green tobacco with fire on its heels converging on smoke. Those are the prominent characters in this novel of creation via traditional yet soulfully transcending ways. A delightful voyage to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While an excellent beer, I have no interest in trying this again until I manage to visit the brewery. For the outrageous price of $40, I could have enjoyed the same experience with a bottle of St. Bernardus 12 six times over..."
""
""
"O: ""The flavor of a quad without the cloying""; ""complex flavor""; ""fruity like a Belgian white, but the feel of a triple or a quad", there is a lot going on with this beer. The flavor starts with a creamy chocolate/ coffee and ends with a sour lemon bite. It was excellent. I enjoyed it tremendously."
""
"O: This is a pretty enjoyable beer. It's fairly complex, easy to drink, and it hides the alcohol well. I'm glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't put forth the effort to get another bottle. It's not one I'd wait in line for."

"O- This is a solid, solid, beer. I am very glad to have tried it, and the taste really is world class. Some of the subtleties of this beer just can't be found anywhere else. With that being said, I don't think I would constantly hunt this beer down or seek it out. Given another chance, I would love to drink it, but the money and effort are at the far end of my tolerance for acquiring beer, when something like St. Bernadaus 12 or Chimay 12 is readily available. With all of that said- I would still have to concur that this is the King of Belgian beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So this is Westvleteren 12, perhaps the most elusive and highly rated beer on the planet. I must say, its reputation is certainly deserved. This beer is a work of seamless balance and grand complexity. It just feels more focused and more refined than any other beer within the style, and it may well be the most drinkable beer of its size. There are those within the style that draw very close comparisons, and some may even have a slight edge in terms of complexity and depth of flavor. However, it's the balance and sheer drinkability that set Westvleteren 12 apart and make it worthy of its place among the world's elite beers."

"Thanks matt for the bottle share. In the nose i oddly get almost a hefeweisse yeast - slight banana and clove, bakers chocolate, bready malts and carob as well. Thick rich and lush on the palate; bring the flavors on the nose with a dry almost earthy finish. Very complex stuff that i am not equipped to describe. Beautiful head with a ruby tinted hue on the basic quad brown color. Very excited to try this and an excellent beer but not close to the best i have had. Bottle was a usa export."

"Received from Ibrew2or3 in a trade. Thanks man! Looks to be one of the brick box ones that were sent to the U.S., given the gold writing on the bottle. Having this as I brew my first beer ever. Hoping that I will get some good vibes in my wort! Pours deep murky brown with fluffy light kahki head. A bit of reddish hue on the edges. Smells of figs, plums, pears, raisin, light alcohol, bit of bready nuttiness. Flavor is slight bitter up front that explodes into chocolatey fig and white grape. Some nutty bite going on as it mellows into a fruity sweetness. More carbonation than I expected, but still chewey mouthfeel. Lasting bouquet of fruit. So glad I got to try it."

"O: Very drinkable, nice complexity. Its excellence is not in being barrel aged, loaded with hops, or 14%, but in a superb balance and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like the smell, there is a sweet dessert wine flavor, a sweet hint of alcoholic heat, and deep candied figs and apricots. The carbonation lends a peppery quality to the taste. There is a sweetness in the background. Though this is a pretty serious beer, it isn't terribly heavy in texture."

"O: I know this beer has a huge claim to fame, but I'm just not a fan. I have had this many times in the past year, in a bunch of different vintages, and I remain firm on my ranking. I just don't like it. I don't understand all the hype. I can only trust my taste-buds. What I will say, is that I like this beer much better when it is fresh. This particular bottle has 10+ years on it."

"I've had a few bottles of this over the last few years, and am always amazed at this beer. I at first wanted it to be awful so I didn't have to keep driving over and getting some, but unfortunately I was wrong. The hype is true. Pours a nice dark caramel/toffee color. Bit khaki head that slowly falls and leaves plenty of lacing behind. The smell is a nice blend of caramel, vanilla, figs, raisins, malt, molasses, and dried black cherries. The taste is just as complex and leaves nothing to be desired. A nice sweetness in the finish and it leaves you wanting, craving, more. World class beer."

"Date: October 22, 2011 Mode: Bottle Source: Darkness Day. Full description not available as I sampled way too many beers during Darkness Day! October 27, 2012 had a 40 year old bottle at Darkness Day. Had the familiar Westy taste and palate, but was diminished noticeably. Past its prime, but still better than most other beers out there. No change to my ratings."

"O: this is a great beer... Would i call it the best beer in the world? No. Bit it is certainly damn good, particuarly for its style. It is a tad on the sweet and sugary side I would say. But very nice balance and flavor, along with the amazing mouthfeel put this amongst the elite few."

"Hard to deny that it's one of the best beers I've ever had. It really feels like liquid bread or a dessert - really satisfying but I could only have one every once in a while. But if I could I would definitely have it a few times a year. Absolutely delicious, and a great start to 2013."
""
""
"Overall I was really really really impressed with this beer. After hearing for years that a Rochefort 10 is equally on par with this if not better, I have to say that I do not agree. Maybe it is the age that made this one so special and tasty but I remember being really unimpressed with the Rochefort 10 I had around a year ago. This reminds me agreat deal of the St Bernardus 60th Anniversary beer which I previously thought was the best Belgian beer I have ever had. I would have liked to sample this next to that one to really see who is tops and I will revisit a Rochefort 10 I have been aging as well in a year to see if my memory/opinions will change but I cannot say enough about this beer right now, it was quite special indeed."
"O- The best quad/strong dark I have had so far. Last time I finished the bottle with some dark chocolate cheesecake. Not a good match. This seems to go better with savory foods. Something that is very sweet will cancel out the complexity of this amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
"In summary, is this a great beer? Yes. Is it the best beer in the world? For me, probably not. Like sex, everything is relative and everyone is entitled to their opinion. I've had beers that I enjoyed better, but I just slept with a super model, so I'm gonna gloat for a while."
"O: A very nice quad. The first couple of sips had me worried that it was going to be average, but it really improved by the time i finished it. I think it will benefit from some aging. Planning on spreading the other 5 bottles over the course of a few years."
""
""
""
"An obviously fantastic beer. Like Frank the Tank in “Old School” said, “Once it hits your lips, it’s so good.” One of the smoothest beers I’ve ever tried."
"All in all, a good quad. If I didn't know it was ""the best beer in the world," I might not have figured it out by what's in the glass. It is very good, but I think a lot of its reputation is self-fulfilling. Would buy again if I could."
""
""
"O- decent. I am glad I was able to get my hands on a sixer, but there are several better beers out there IMHO."
""
"Pours a very murky horehound brown color with a thick, foamy caramel colored head. Dates, brown sugar, caramel, notes of maple, and very light bourbon without the alcohol on the nose. The moutfheel is medium- to full-bodied and lightly oily. A bit of carbonation on the rear of the tongue. Nutty up front, caramel apple appears shortly after. Alcohol warmth shows up late and lingers in the throat. Some alcohol bitterness appears as well. So much balance from start to finish in all aspects of the beer. The only drawback is the cutoff at the finish by the alcohol bitterness."
""
""
"I have to say that this did not live up to the hype for me. I think had this been fresh it would have been exceptional. As it stands it is a good beer, but certainly not perfect. The flavors did not all come together for me. They all seemed to be disjoint. The baked apples are the dominant flavor followed by caramel and sugar. The dark fruits come in the finish. Don't get me wrong. This is a tremendous beer and it is definitely worth trying if you can find it, but ultimately there are equally good Quads available that are much easier to find."
"Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above. It was worth the drive to Maryland and the long wait in line to score, share and taste this well-regarded brew."
""
""
"O- this is a very good quad, however I definitely think it could benefit from some aging which is why I'm glad I split my gift pack with a buddy and have two more bottles, I'd like to see the alcohol subside slightly, other than that a solid beer even if it is a little over-hyped in my opinion"
""
""
""
""

"Quite unlike anything I've had before. As much as the alcohol is very prevalent, it's not at all overpowering nor does it have that alcohol burn. Complex, subtle, sweet, tart, bubbly, boozy, smooth. The one thing that amazes me, is the mouthfeel. If I didn't know it was a beer, I'd swear it was a sparkling wine. I can't say it's the best beer I've ever had, or my favourite, but it's probably the most unique and pleasurable in it's own way. Not something I'd want to drink every day, but a rare treat."

"O. I don't think that I'm allowing the hype to sway me: This is just spectacular."

"Pours dark brown with a pillowy, beige head that fades to a foam atop the ale. Aromas are pleasant and come through more as the ale warms: musty, boozy, earthy, sweet, caramel, honey, fruity as it warms w plum & cherry. Tastes are boozy, rich, sweet, malty, fruity with plum, raisin, currant, rum, bready yeast, mossy, musty, earthy - great complexity! Mouth-feel is full bodied with lots of carbonation, very smooth. Overall, it lives up to its expectations. I had my doubts, but it came through...maybe even better than expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to grade this beer impartially given all the anticipation and the amount of time it spent at the top of the top beers list. For the style, this is marginally the best example i've had. For me, though, it doesn't transcend the style or make me think of quads any differently than I did beforehand. It is worth seeking out if you can get it and are a fan of the style in general. For the price point though, i'd rather buy rochefort going forward, even if I prefer this by a slight margin."
""
""
"O: Fabulously done Quad. Right up there with Abt. 12, though I believe Abt 12 tasted better to my palate, with more caramel-apple dessert notes. Overall I can see why this is such a sought after beer. This also seems to be an excellent age for this beer."
"O - this beer definitely lives up to the hype. Have now tried all the Trappist top ABV brews and this is by far head and shoulders above. The balance is perfect and the expected Belgian Quad characteristics are in perfect harmony. Everybody's tastes are different, but for me, this is a Benchmark brew."
"I can't think of a better beer to celebrate nearly 6 years of beer advocacy than to review a beer that has consistently proven its' mettle in the BA Top 100."
"Overall- It's a big beer but expertly well-rounded. There's a reason why people have hyped this."
""
"My Christmas treat! This has always been way high on my wants, but never had much chance to try this...heard about the gift sets coming to the US and even then it was dicey whether I could procure one...lucked out and so glad I did!

"I reviewed St. Bernardus a few years ago, but I unfortunately did not record the date. I would say this beer is just as good as St. Bernardus 12, but I haven't had one in about a year. I definitely prefer Westvleteren 12 over this particular Rochefort 10 I'm drinking as I type. However, the Rochefort is only 10 months old, and it sure tastes like some aging would do it justice. This Westvleteren is two years old, so perhaps it isn't a fair comparison."
""
"overall, great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Lives up to the high rating. I feel like this one is different than the other top quads and separates itself with the complex flavors and minimal alcohol taste."
"Overall: Well, I wouldn't miss the chance, even if it did cost me 19,5 EUR! This is from the new batch, released to make some extra profits for the monastery. I heard that there was a small batch at my local pub in Helsinki, Kuikka, and I had to try one before they run out. It's obviously a great beer, but I personally prefer Rochefort 10 -- this is just too sweet for me. It would go well with a rich chocolate dessert or fruit cake and it's fitting for Christmas time. Not worth the insane price tag though. I do feel that the praise for this beer is partly just due to the difficulty in obtaining it."
""
""
""
""
""

"This was strong and very aggressive but never did the alcohol drown out all of the flavors and nuances that this had to offer. While I don't regret waiting for hours in the freezing cold to get my hands on a ""brick"" of this, it fell just a hair short of all the hype given to this. Most of that had to do with the unavailability of this beer in North America but there's no doubt that I don't regret a minute of the wait or cost of this beer. It's not #1 in my book but with so many offerings available these days, this easily beats out 99% of what's on the shelf or on tap at the local brewery or brewpub. This was fabulous from start to finish and I don't care what the extra bottles I have would fetch via a trade - they're either going into my stomach or to people that I deeply care about. Great beers like this do not deserve to be pimped out, but savored for the good times around good people. Anything less would be a disservice."

"Overall: I recently got to try Westvleteren 12 at a blind tasting of six different Quads. Surprisingly, Pannepot was my favorite - along with three other tasters. To its credit, Westvleteren 12 was my second favorite."
""
""
""
"D - Well, after years of wondering if I would ever have a chance to try this, here I am. You have to sort of expect that a beer with this much hype might fail, at least a little bit, to lie up to its reputation and as much as I hate to say it this is no exception. It is harshly toasty and kind of one dimensional, with a sickly sugary flavor that tastes like someone put too much sugar in their homebrew. It isn't as good as ABT 12 and its not even in the same building as Rochefort 10. I'm glad I only traded for one, I would guess this would fall off the top 100 rapidly if people could get it more easily."
"Overall: A lot of hype around this one. It is certainly an excellent beer. I feel there are other Quads out their that are similar enough to this one without all of the recognition. Regardless it was great to be able to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have been waiting a long time to try this and it did not disappoint."

"Fantastic, but truthfully not worth the price point with St. Bernardus and Rochefort examples readily available. Very glad I (finally) got to try this, however."
"O - Satisfied and cant wait for my other two bottles to age!"
"(BTW - anyone who says this brick set is overpriced does not value the glasses enough, they are excellent. And two - the bottle says in Latin, “Ad aedificandam abbatiam adiuvi” which means “I helped to build the abbey.” How cool is that?!"

"O- overall, I feel that this bottle of westy 12 was damn enjoyable! Is it one of the best beers I've ever had? Well, I'll put it in my top 5 for sure. All hype aside this is a beautifully crafted beer and, in my opinion, on the same level as roch 10, and st bern 12. Give this beer 18 months and maybe it will rise to greatness. I'll give it a solid A."
""
""
"O- very good beer. # 2 beer in the world, not sure about that. Did a side-by-side with Abt 12 and they are very similar. I would give Westy the slight edge, but if you don't care about the hype I would suggest just getting the Abt 12."
""
""
"O - 5 : 4.5"
"Overall: Amazing flavor, as described, with a million other fabulous flavors that I'm too much of a novice taster to even detect I'm sure. I really like the way the lighter body balances out the richness of the flavor. What more can I say?"
""
"Definitely can see the hype for this brew. A true classic, though probably not a ton of difference between this and Rochefort 10. Would I pay $85 for another sixer? No, probably not. But for this first chance to try it? Definitely. If I saw a single bottle on the shelves one day, I'd probably buy a bottle though. Well, time to sit down some of the other bottles and see how this beer changes."

"Aftertaste: The aftertaste is nice. The sweetness hangs around and some malty flavors start to come forward… but they are here and gone again just as fast. If you have had a Belgian quad before, it is a very similar flavor. We had some quads in Belgium a few months ago… and they do taste better over there. But still. The aftertaste here is nice, and seeing as how I like sweets, that makes sense."

"Pours solid dark brown, with a nice thick light-tan head. Excellent retention, and nice sticky lacing. Full of rich aromas, leather, tobacco, fig. Tastes of fig, raisin, alcohol is evident, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Perfectly carbonated."
"O: I think people are disappointed or underwhelmed with hyped beers like this, and let's say a brew like Pliny the Elder, because they aren't in your face, extreme beers. They certainly are a bit over-hyped and played out to be, but at the end of the day, it comes down to how simple and balanced they are. This is just a perfectly balanced Trappist Quad that delivers. Sweet but not overly so, and just the right amount of dryness. It is complex as hell. This is a beer that's also amazing paired with food. I'd put the other Trappist Quads, like Rochefort and other Belgian versions of the brew style, St. Bernardus Abt. 12 for example, right up there with it but it does stand out. These monks are not fucking around over there and I do respect their choice not to expand and distribute this work of art widely. Thanks for the gift sets and good luck with modifications to your monastery. I really wish I had access to more though, guess I'll have to wait for my pilgrimage. I'm wit da hypebeasts on this one, go get it now!"
""

"O: I've only found a few beers I like in this style. This is my new favorite. In the words of THE GREAT DALSA... BOOOSH!"
"This beer is crazy good. I love trappist beers and have tried all of them. I regularly drink Rochfort and Beranardus and they don't come close. This beer is the only beer I've ever drank and immediately crowned it the best I've had."
""
"O: A great beer that defines the style. Best beer in the world? I think it is unfair to compare styles but there are other beers that I prefer. Best beer in this style? Maybe, but I have not tried them all yet (but I am working on it). Either way, this is a great beer that is worth seeking out. I hope to try it on tap someday."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps I'm falling for the hype, but it does seem more rich, flavorful, and has a fuller mouthfeel than Rochefort and St. Bernardus."
""
""
"O - a great beer worth trying. IMO it's a dulled down version of St Bernardus 12. The recipe for the St. Bernardus and Westy are the same, so if you can't get your hands on this one pick up a St. Bernardus and try that. I was lucky to bring one back from Belgium and it was very good. IMO the Westy is like the Bernardus little brother/cousin."
"O - My absolute favorite for the combination of taste, story behind the beer, and rarity of drinking one."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am not a good judge of belgians as I have not had many but I enjoyed this. The belgian spiciness which tends to be off-putting to me is balanced quite nicely with rich maltiness and alcohol warmth."
""

"Smooth with a bit of a hops bite and no after taste. Very dark, muddy color. Had a hufe off-white head. Aroma was strong with peach, vanilla and caramel. The flavor had a hops bite that was tempered by vanilla, orange peel with a caramel finish. It gets seeter as you go through the glass."
"I really enjoyed this one. I look forward to seeing what some age can do for it."

"D - An all around superb beer, and it's easy to see why it's regarded as one of the top brews in the world. While I've always been attracted to the Belgian beers out there, Quads/BSDAs usually fall a bit short for me, but this one was certainly different. That being said, the massive price-tag and exclusivity make it a little harder to enjoy. I've yet to try Rochefort 10, but I can't imagine this is THAT much better than it. Either way, I'm glad I got the chance to try this one; world-class and a benchmark for the style."

"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is yeasty and sour with a touch of fruitiness. WOW. An amazingly complex and excellently made beer. Full bodied. Malts are bold and flavorful. Very complex. Seems to be a different taste/flavor aspect with every sip. Fruity with raisins, plums and cherries interplaying with vanilla, chocolate and orange peel. Hides the 10.2% alcohol very well. This is one beer that is definitely worthy of all the hype/accolades it has received. Very smooth and extremely complex. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry."

"Dark brown beer with small biege head and yeast..Very complex taste and smell.Sweet smell,wet wood,little smoky,raisins,pulms,spruce,bread,coffee. Taste sweet and dry,wood,bread,chocolate dry fruits,complicated spices,alcohol (but very ballanced with the taste.so good palate,a warm complicate feeling in mouth with a very long lasting finish.It has it all :the taste,aroma,prestige the legent. It is made by monks but the feeling is like orgasm in a glass."

"Overall - I should really review a fresher bottle. This is really oxidized but the quality of the beer still comes through. Westy with sherry."
""
""
""

"Great deep dark brown color with a small light tan head, the aroma is sweet like candy with hints of plum and a very slight sniff of alcohol but not immediately present. The taste is incredibly complex, so much going on with the belgian candy sugar, molasses, the roasted notes from the malts and the dark fruit just all meshes so beautifully together with what is an amazing yeast strain. To get to 10% with almost no presence of alcohol lingering is quite amazing while keeping enough residual sugar that it lingers on your lips, it's by far the best quad / belgian strong dark ale I've ever had. The body is rich, smooth and complex with medium carbonation to enhance the sweetness and finish, just great overall beer. I wish all beer was this wonderfully crafted."
""
""
""
"O-this is definitely a world class beer. however, its not my favorite quad. its fairly harsh. it has a taste that kicks back with a heat. i was hoping the flavors to be a bit more mellow. i don't regret spending a lot for it. i recommend anyone to do the same, if just for the reason to kill you curiosities."
""

"Overall: Very good but a little less substantial than expected. Compared to the Rochefort 10 its a little underpowered and much sweeter. Very good beer but not earth changing. Much more enjoyable over the long run than the rochefort 10; more welcoming and pleasant."
""
""
"Bottled. Dark nut brown, hazy colour with small beige head. Sweet aroma of caramel, alcohol, fruit, flowers a bit licorace and banana, very complex. Extremely wellbalanced complex flavour, being soft and sweet into a bit biting alcohol. Flavour consists of bananas, citrus, hops, alcohol and caramel and lots more. Excellent beer."

"Overall (5.0). After the skies shined, we had to return home. But not without stopping at the gift shop to pick up as many boxes of the samplers as I could manage. Flew home with four boxes of beer (four glasses, four 12, four 8 and 8 blond). Gave one box to my brother, split one with my beer nerds, and saved two for myself. I can't wait to try the 8 & 12 in a few .... years."
""
""
""
""
""
"N.B. This beer was had by the reviewer on two separate summer afternoons at the In de Vrede cafe attached to the monastery in 2012. He had 2-4 of them on each occasion."
"O - Really a nice beer. Goes down smooth, yet is complex and has a lot going on. No evidence of alcohol despite the 10.6% in there. It is very dark, so you need to be in the mood for something like that, but if you are, this is definitely one of the best."
""
""
"O - I had this in the pantry for about a year, waiting for that special occasion to crack this one open. One rainy, windy Friday evening at home with the wife I decided that given the hype of this beer, it must be a special occasion in itself to drink a Westy 12, and I can tell you now that I was not wrong. Incredible depth of flavour, sumptuous heavenly aroma, reaches the dizziest heights of beer quality. Exceeds the hype. Best beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
"dark brown colour with a fine head, very complex aroma: bread, raisins and black chocolate, impressive malty palate, deep balance between sweetness and bitterness, slightly oily, the finish is moderately dry showing candy sugar, plums, gingerbread and a long warming alcohol touch - my deep consideration goes to the monks who are brewing this wonder and who make me think for a moment that I'm living in paradise"
""
"O: Quads are far from my favorite style and I was expecting this bottle to be wasted on me but I rather enjoyed it."
""
""
"What can I say? I know tons of people love this beer. I hope to try it again, to see if my opinion remains the same. But for now, I find it to be in the upper tier of quads, but definitely not at the top. I prefer some others over it by a decent margin."
"D - Definite sipper, and TBH something I would prefer to split 2 ways. Still, amazing complexity and flavour."
""
"Medium-bodied and carbonated, clean and crisp, but velvety smooth and creamy. Yes, it’s probably a bit overrated due to its scarcity, but it’s certainly the best quad I’ve tried. Others come close, and it doesn’t destroy Rochefort 10 or even the best of De Dolle, but it is better than them, deeper and more complex but a good measure. Worthy of its place atop the pantheon of Trappist beers to be sure."
""
"O: Very good. Obviously hyped, but more enjoyable than any other Trappist beer that I've tried. At three years, it's tasting very nicely."

"Overall just a world class phenomenal beer. It's been a long time since I was able to enjoy one of these guys. I love it young and look forward to trying my other one with a few years on it in the near future."

"Best beer? Probably not but for the rather small style of quadrupels this one is probably the most complex and probably the best, atleast compared to the ones I had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall very good but not in my top beers. It seems well balanced and the alcohol is hidden exceptionally well, but is more of a one-note beer than I expected."
"O: While this was good I'd rather spring for a Rochefort 10 anyday. It didn't have enough burnt sugar and caramelization for me."
""
""
""
"O - An excellent beer, I close my eyes and think of sitting next to a warm fire in winter. I'm doubtful this is the best beer in the world as some tout but it is certainly quite good and I'm very happy to share this experience with some close friends I haven't seen in a long time."

"2nd Edit: I was just informed by another BA that the bottle I had was from Feb 2012 (not Feb 2010)."
""
""
""
""
"O: Having watched lots of hyperbolical Youtube reviews I was hoping for something about ten times more special, but absolutely no revelations here. I find mass produced Duvel more flavourful than Westy 12. A very nice drink but don't fall for the hype I say."
""
""
""
"Price paid - roughly $40 USD, but more than worth the price for this beer; which is rightfully one of the best beers in the world."
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I got to try this in a way that supports the monks. This fundraiser gift-pack showed up in Alberta and I just had to pick it up even though it had a price tag of $75 for 6 of the Westy 12's and 2 collectible glasses. Not a terrible deal I suppose compared to the grey market prices, but still more than I'm used to paying. The beer speaks for itself though and there's a reason it's generally considered to be the greatest Trappist ale out there."
""

"I even managed to score a few bottles to bring home to America. I poured one a month later wondering if it would be as amazing as at the Abbey. It was. Once again it poured perfect and tasted amazing."
"O: A"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is so complex that I could have it again and different aspect would prevail. I had this with my best beer bud, Cervezango, while sitting in Brussels. This beer was a somewhat dark brown with a little ruby. The head was nice and creamy, a little off white. The smell sweet, herbal, toasty, caramel, alcohol, malty for sure. The taste as complex as the smell. The high alcohol isn't as strong as it would seem. This beer has it all. Creamy feel. I could review this again every day and probably not get board. I paid about $15 for one bottle, and I don't even regret it."
"Overall: Definitely a great beer. Somewhat sweeter than I'd expect, but I really like that. For my next one I'll try a more vigorous pour and make sure its starting at a better temp."

""
"Great beer but nowhere near the best the world has too offer, I've only had this one fresh but I have a feeling it won't stand up too a Rochefort 10 of the same age"
""
"A good way to describe this would be to drink a Highland Park 18 year scotch alongside a similar type of scotch with 15 years.. The 18 year will rock your world due to its drinkability and smoothness and the Westvleteren 12 did the same thing against the Rochefort 10. That being said, I would still age my Rochefort 10s because of its availability in the US."

"O - I must admit given the price paid I was instantly skeptical and expecting a lot, and this delivers the goods, its not a big in your face brew and therein lies the genius, it is so mellow and well inviting that you would never guess this is a big ass Belgian. BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Worth the wait and the Dark Lord that I traded to get it. Stands out from other Quads in quality and mouthfeel, well balanced and amazing. I would drink this beer everyday if I could, and that's not easy for me to say about Quads because I sometimes find that they weigh me down. I would be willing to sacrifice my body to the beer-bellied gods to have this frequently."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Awesome beer, without a doubt one of the best quads in the world, but this is the freshest I've ever had the pleasure of drinking (about 5 months old) and I have to say, older vintages tasted much better. I think this needs some time to cool off and age, it had much more of an alcohol presence than I remembered. I have a good amount of this tucked away and I plan to try one each year to see the difference. I still say though that this is worth the hype and if you like quads you should track one down."
"Overall: Wonderfully complex with a lot of layers. Definitely a beer that is enjoyable young but will age well. One that should be shared with good friends or company, with people who appreciate good beer. Had a wonderful warm belly feeling after sharing half of this."

"Had from the source. Pour is a deep, opaque, mohogany brown with a creamy tan head and huge lace. Loads of caramel, brown sugar, notes of candied sugar, tons of dark fruits, plums, light raisin, and faint cherries. Taste follows the nose, very sweet. Some yeast kicks in mid palate after all the brown sugar and caramel. Candied sugars more towards the back with the dark fruit notes. Hints of booze and chocolate in the finish. Medium to full body, light bit of a residual sugar feel, very creamy and smooth carbonation. A little sweet but quite a bit of depth, good stuff."

"O: This beer was awesome but put next to some of the other great Quads I have had I don't think it really would be leagues above them. This beer def didn't live up to the hype and I don't think it deserves the #2 spot overall. With that said it was still very enjoyable and a great beer!"

"#BOTG 75! A huge one for tonight, a long time want. Bottled 4-14-11. Poured from bottle into Chimay Chalice. Pours blood brown/red. Super creamy off white head that doesn't go away at all. Beautiful. Smell- apple sauce, cinnamon, raisins, prunes, sweet fusel alcohol, ripe pears, dark cherries, dark overly ripe plums. Brilliant. Super complex. Taste- sweet, deep ripe dark fruits, raisins, plum, with a salty sweet ending. Prunes, brandy notes, a tiny bit of alcohol notes, but it doesn't burn at all. Just super smooth. I was wondering how it could possibly be better than Rochefort 10, and it is. It's just so creamy, smooth, deep, complex. Bravo, its the hype."

"12/15/14:  Sampled another one in a snifter from the same batch.  More dark dried fruit in aroma and taste.  Still lots of sweet spice and good complexity.  You can tell this has mellowed and softened a bit now.  Not as fresh as previous tastings."

"Thank you, Merci, Dankje!!!!"
""
"O- This was a fantastic beer that definitely lived up to it's hype. Definitely by far the best Quad I've ever had. The beer was very complex, while everything balanced perfectly into a great beer. The only beer that I like more then this is Heady Topper, but that's partially because I prefer DIPAs over Quads. I can see why this one of the top rated beers in the world. Definitely would love to try this beer again. Maybe with a little bit more age on it."

"Overall impression: Neither vintage was what I was expecting; I figured this would be a far more potent beer. These two bottles don't even seem like the same beer, they're so different. I like #1 better but, in terms of style, it's for all the wrong reasons."

"O-Head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included. Westy 12 finishes beautifully, much to my sadness, because I really didn’t want this wonderful Belgian beer to end. A true Trappist quadrupel, bless those monks. For a high ABV, Westy 12 is very drinkable, and I could easily put a couple of these away"
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, thick and full on the tongue. It's fair to say this lives up to the hype, although it's difficult to say that it's worth the price when St. Bernardus and Rochefort are sitting on shelves everywhere."
""
"Ain't nothing like this beer, it's one in a million. There's simply no comparison. The fact that you can only pick up one crate per car, at the abbey where this stuff is brewed by monks (!), only adds to its exclusivity. It's taste is like honeysuckle dipped in angel sweat. Best beer in the universe bar none."
""
""
"O - This lived up to the hype for me and was worth the price and hassle to get. I'm very glad I finally got to try this beer. Is it the best beer in the world? It wouldn't be number 1 on my list but it's definitely a world class beer worthy of a high ranking."
"This beer poured a reddish brown hue with no head into a snifter. The smell was very boozy which was a bit of a turn off, but as soon as I tasted this beer I forgot it even had alcohol. This had a very sweet and smooth raisin flavor all the way through. Easy to drink and only a hint of boozy-ness in the aftertaste. The yeast took a back seat to the raisins as I could not really taste it at all, over all this is a very good beer that I will search out again. Thanks to chewy08rx for this one."
"Just had at In de Vrede today. The beer is pretty fresh and has a bit of heat. Might be better aged a bit (says the beer can age up to 20 years). Nice dark color, more amber than black. Lots of raisin, fig, caramel flavors. Very heavy bread smells, almost like going to a bakery. Might write a follow up review since we snagged a few gift packs at the abbey at 2pm."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good, glad to have tried it, but if I was in the mood for a quad, I think I would reach for St. Bernardus 12, not to take anything away from this fantastic beer."
"Its got every flavor from a quad, but all in balance. I see why its so highly rated."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, what a fantastic offering.  How can a beer with such a high reputation live up to the hype?  Im not sure, but it does. From start to finish just incredible in almost every aspect.  Is it the best beer in the world?  Impossible to tell, as with all the different styles, and personal presences, it's an almost arbitrary distinction.  That being said, I would have to say its probably the best beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, and if not number 1, certainly in the top 2-3.  World class.  "
""
""

""
"Well, this lives up to the reputation. This is a fantastic quad. So many fruity esters, a great malt profile, and some bitterness that holds everything together. My only complaint is that it's has a little too much dry booze. This is pretty magical, but it's not the best beer I've ever had. I think this is a good thing, as this is not exactly easy to get."
"Overall: This is the best Belgian beer I've ever encountered. Loads of depth and complexity without being too much. Nice balance and the clean finish is damn impressive. Is it the best beer in the world, no. Is it damn good and worth drinking, absolutely."

"Poured from a 2007 vintage bottle (33cl) at Akkurat; murky brown with a concerted cloudy core, a tan light foam rests at the surface consisting of tiny bubbles. Perceptible sediments in the glass. Polite medium intensity nose with multiple layered odor of massive licorice aroma, refreshing cola syrup, chocolate pudding, butterscotch and a hint of fruit, raisins mostly. Along with superb complexity this beer brings synergy to my nose each time I sense it. The beer is full bodied, mouth filling and silky. The high alcohol is not quite evident and malty taste above and beyond the perfect equilibrium of bitterness and sweetness brings this beer into sum balance. Caramelized tones, licorice, butterscotch, dried fruit, cacao, cola syrup and some tiny hints, symptomatic of bubblegum summer berries. This beer is outstanding, and yet I feel there's something missing. The concentration is outstanding, but not extravagant. This is surely a masterpiece, but I'm not blown away. Perhaps my expectations were excessively high for this legend of a beer, lacking a bit of feel and extraordinary touch. http://quaffable.org/?p=32"
""
""
""
"EDIT: I had this a second time and was a little different. The smell and taste were extremely nutty. Almond was my first thought."

"O: Super complex beer that blends everything together wonderfully. This was fantastic for a quad which I'm not the biggest fan of. I certainly now need to get my hands on a few more of these. Very nice."
""
""
""
"Verdict: Simply sublime. I may not consider it the best beer in the world, but it has earned its reputation as one everyone should make a point to try in their lifetime. The flavors are balanced so well and have seemingly endless complexity, definitely worth the effort to get."
""
""
"cheers."
"Bottle 2008 purchased from the abbey pours dark plum brown with a murky clarity and medium off white head. Aroma is stone fruit, big yeast esters and caramel malt. Flavor is candied sugar, plum, caramel and again yeast. Wonderful mouthfeel, moderate in carbonation with good lacing in the end. Nice stuff."
""
""
"tried this beer for the first time a few weeks ago and have been waiting to rate it so doing it now for the rb scavanger hunt. did not think it was worth all the hype tasted very similar to roch10. it poured a hazy deep yellow with great white frothy head aroma was sweet and nutty as was the taste."
"O - Excellent beer? Yes. Light years ahead of the Rochefort 10 I can buy any day of the week? No, but I did have a Rochefort 10 immediately after this and it was considerably sweeter than the Westy 12. Sadly, I may not have the chance to have a nicely aged bottle for comparison. Overall, this was spicier and more bitter than I was expecting (in a good way) and thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Drink- Great beer, hard to get but worth the experience at least once."
""
""
""
"Impressive - a beer with a big character. Sweet, fruity booze; it's almost like sherry in flavour. Not sure that I would rate this as the greatest beer in the world, but it's certainly a show-stopper. Perhaps I'll revisit after a few hundred more reviews and see if a revision is needed. Definitely one to seek out and sample."
"It merits it's revered status but probably best in moderation as an occasional treat. I would be in trouble if this was my refrigerator brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy 2 inch khaki head that settles to a puffy cap on top of the beer. Thick foamy chunks of lace cling to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and a variety of fruit aromas: grape juice, grape jelly/jam, dark fruits. Taste is of raisin bread, brown sugar, burnt caramel, dark fruits, grape juice, and a kick of alcohol on the finish. The alcohol is warming in the back of the throat after each sip and a slight amount of bitterness as well. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly drying mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic beer and very worthy of its reputation. The carbonation level seems a wee bit high but that is of minor concern. I am thrilled that I finally got to try this beer."
""

""
""
"Excellent and very complex beer!"
""
"O: A little booziness is the only thing that holds this back from being perfect. It was evident to me why this is the standard from the minute I poured it...the color, consistency, and head on this beer are unequaled. Definitely one for every beer lover to try. Thanks again for this one, Eric!"
""
""
"Overall, this beer was hard to get. And at $20/bottle, it's rather expensive as well. I'm glad I tried this beer, but will most likely view it as a novelty than something I'll actively seek out in the future."

"Overall a very tasty beer, half a point knocked off for being so hard to drink any amount of."
"I don't think this is the best beer in the world but it's a superb one nonetheless. Very drinkable for a 10.2% quad and not too sweet. It's excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim."
""
"So, after all that - mere tenths of rating points divide this hedonistic, rarified harbinger of kingdom in the sky end days from its slightly more pedestrian brethren - I shall be taking that into consideration as I move forward in the beer-imbibing world."
""
""
"dark brown with a tan head that holds and leaves pretty lace. nose is plum, roasted nuts (reminds me of roasting pecans and chestnuts a bit), stone fruit pits, golden raisin and some mild spice (anise? dark spice). all of this is on top of a soothing kind of rum soaked alcohol presence. just wonderful. taste is huge, with flavors of plum, nut and raisins just singing in perfect harmony with the booze notes and phenols. full body with the classic belgian-style light-as-air feeling and a healthy pricklyness to open up the palate and dig the flavors in. the booze is there for sure, but it amplifies and harmonizes more than anything. a true world-class classic brew. thanks dan!"

"Pours a medium brown, clouded with some yeast sentiment, moderately firm khaki head, gone quickly leaving spotty lacing. Scent was fantastic, as it brought a wonderfully blended concoction of brown sugar, light molasses, honey, doughy and yeasty undercooked bread, prune, fig, raisin, apple and light spicing. Was expecting a slap in the face from the taste, but was greeted with a smooth, blended combination of the notes from the scent. Bready, fruity, sweet, savory in all the right quantities. Medium bodied, moderately bubbly, better towards the end as carbonation escapes. Overall, a truly exceptionally crafted beer. Always hard to live up to the hype, but in the way everything blends and layers, it is a work of art."

"...and in case you're wondering, my order of preference ended up being: Westy 12, Malheur 12, Abt 12, and finally Rochefort 10. Cheers!"
""
"O: In one word; phenomenal. Awesome drinkability and the ABV is hidden pretty well. I was a little concerned about the hype, but this lived up to it for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one oddly addictive beer. After sipping you just want more. If this was readily available I would have this quite often."
"Overall, this is basically the freshest possible Westy you can drink. This is an infant. So this whole review should be taken with that particular grain of salt: this beer will likely be better in a few years. This is just a score for a fresh bottle. I'll age my other bottles and reassess it if need be. As it is, this is a beer that is on-par with the St. Bernardus 12s and Rochefort 10s and De Dolle Oerbiers of the world. With age? I'll find out in a few years."
"really such a complex and enjoyable beer, but i was expecting there to be more to it. the taste was prolly the best part about this beer, but IMO this is still on the same level with rochefort and pannepot. im also not sure on exactly how old this bottle is, my guess would be around 1-2 years. with that said, id definately drink this again, but i wouldnt go through any lengths to get it again. still a beer every BA should atleast try once."
""
""
"D - No doubt a world class beer, but a question remains as to whether the hype is fully justified when compared to others in the style. Perhaps this is down in part to the relative rarity and therefore premium price point. Unsurprisingly, reminiscent of St Bernadus Abt 12, which whilst being good isn't my favourite of the quads. I'd go as far as to say Rochefort and De Struise offer slightly better beers, as well as being readily available to me and a much more cost effective option. I'll be cellaring a handful to explore how the booze and carbonation mellow and the flavours integrate, as in my estimation a few years will make it outstanding. Despite this, the overall score speaks for itself. Clearly the work of expert hands..."
"Overall (5): Awesome! Very well balance with the alcohol and deep rich complex flavors keep you searching for something you havent yet tasted. Tasted this with the other 2 big contenders in the belgian quad category, St. Bernies Abt 12 and Rorchefort 10 and have to say the Westy won out. Each of the two aforementioned beers are great without a doubt, but if money was no object I am drinking the Westy over the other two. Will definitely age out the remaining four I have left to see how it matures year by year. Yes, this beer is expensive and hard to get but I have to say I now know what the hype was about. It's a freaking fantastic beer that has made it's way into the top 3 best beer I've ever sampled. Best beer in the world as people say? Cant say, because I havent tried them all! But it is the best belgian ale I've sampled without a doubt."

"O: A great quad that I was fortunate enough to drink fresh right at Cafe 'In de Vrede' across from the abbey. However, I preferred the bottle that I had with some age on it, which mellowed out the alcohol."
"I have had the pleasure of enjoying this beer on a regular basis. Having lived in England for three years, I was able to travel to Belgium and acquire numerous cases of this hard-to-get brew. I drank about half of my stock (about 10 cases total) and have saved and began to age the other half. I break one out and drink it about once a month or so. I am fortunate enough to have tried a variety of Westvleteren 12s, some being as old as 30 years (acquired these from a Belgian teenager who found a couple cases of Westy's in his Grandmas basement!) I have found that the ""sweet spot"" for these beers is about 5 years old (+/- a year). The beers that fall into this range are perfect. There is not much more to be said, they are the perfect beer. Store these beers right and they will reward you with the best that any beer has to offer. Liquid caramel. Smell, taste, everything is spot on. This beer is rightfully the number one beer in the world. I will continue to make trips to Belgium for the rest of my life to enjoy beers in the cafe (In de Vrede) across the street from the Monastary."
""
""
""
"Had a few of these at the ""Cafe In de Vrede"" at the monastary. Well....it was pretty damn good. The best in the world? debatable. For me it was a lot like a St. Bernadus 12. Which makes sense since it was the monks at Saint Sixtus Abbey which helped to start St. Berny's brewery."
""
""
"O- First when I traded for this I was glad I wouldn't have to take part in the hysteria. Now I think I might have to give my first born for a crate of this. Seek out at any cost!"

"2009 bottle picked up from the Brewery. It pours mahogany to deep ruby in colour with a thin foamy beige head. The nose is wood, ginger, raisin, fig, date, orange-zest, leather and dark chocolate. The taste unbelievably complex: wood, caramel, toffee, plum, cherry, date, prune, fig, stewed pear, red grape, banana, vanilla, leather, smoke, charcoal, milk and dark chocolate, rich-roast coffee, liquorice, nice alcohol warmth....the list could go on. The underlying sweetness balances the more savoury flavours. It has fine carbonation, a full body, layers of complexity, surprising smoothness and one of the longest finishes around. Awesome."
""
"O: Very complex and well balanced but so easy to drink! With 2-3 years on it, definitely one my favorite beers!"
""
""
"Wow, I was lucky enough to get a bottle made in 2010 and I split it with a friend of mine. This is the best beer I have ever had and I can only hope that I can get my hands on another one before I die. We poured it out of the traditional unmarked bottle into the most ghetto of clear plastic cup, it pains me to even admit that, but good beer will always be good no matter what. It appearance was a dark murk brown and it had a large yellow/brown head. It had a heavy unami aroma that was very pleasant. Up front it has a simple sweet/malty taste with even a hint of raisin while the back-end of it provided a little spice and heat perhaps due to it being aged for two years. I was told to swish it around in my mouth and there was an explosion of flavor as it turned to a cream like consistency. I would also say it had a little bitter and roasty notes throughout the tasting. Would definitely recommend it and I may have to make a trip to Belgium."
""
"There is a mythical experience that comes with drinking Westvleteren 12 that cannot be understood unless one drinks it."
""
""
""
"Prefer the Younger as my top beer, but this rocks. Can't wait to try this one day fresh at the Abbey."
"Huge props to dbexpert, you're the man, thanks a ton for the trade!"
"One of the best beers in the world? I was a bit nervous before tasting it, but it didn’t disappoint me: One of the smoothest and most balanced beers I have had, with a distinct note of Raspberry Swiss roll."
""
"O: Stand ovation on this and it will never stopping amazing me - the monks of Westvleteren sure know how to brew an excellent beer! You can enjoy a ""fresh"" bottle or a vintage bottle and the result will always be the same - outstanding! It does age quite well too, but I think this bottle was a bit more fresh. Either way, it is definitely something any beer drinkers out there should have the experience of enjoying (even if you don't like the style). I converted to appreciate the Belgian Quad as a result of my first encounter with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So glad I got to try the great Westy 12. It’s interesting to think about everything that went into making this. I’d like to try another one with some more time on it. Hope I get another chance to try it again. Next time I'll opt for a chalice instead of a tulip."
""
""
"O: Such a wonderful beer; sweet but not cloying, dark fruits, grapes, and delicious"
""
""
""
"D - Solid quad, really nice complexity and balance between the sweetness, fruits, and malts. Definitely worth the trouble of getting for the experience!"
""
""
""
"Overall, I will admit I was slightly disappointed by the greatest beer in the world. That was obviously due to the extremely high expectations I had. That being said it is a great beer, but honestly I think St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is slightly better. However, I will definitely drink this again in the future. A must try for all lovers of beer."
""

"Notes: Sure, I would have it again, and again, and I did not pay tooo much for this bottle. But there is some undeniable hype riding here. Fruity and sweet character aside, this is on a similar league for me than, say, a Rochefort 10, which is readily available. Worth the try, and wishing I could ride up the monastery after having won the phone lottery to pick up a couple of legit cases. But that is another story..."
""
"Best by date of 4/18/10."
""
""
""
""
"O: I must profess that I'm not a Belgian style lover. I'm not sure if I let the hype get to me or I feel like I need to like this beer because it was expensive, but I really enjoyed this. If I was able to have access to this regularly, it would be a staple in my fridge and I'd be a Belgian beer fan for sure. Worthy of the acclaim that it gets."

"Whoever says that this U.S. import version is inferior to its predecessor is high on drugs. It's the same beer, for better or worse... (well, probably worse, considering the price)."
""
"O: Easily in the top five beers I have ever had. This was the second time I have had this beer, and it was just as good as the first. I think I might like the 8 more, but not by much. Fantastic flavors, all almagamated nicely. If you are in to craft, this is the Holy Grail of craft. Consider yourself extremely honored and privileged if you get the opportunity to try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Just great, and I am very happy I was able to get a bottle. I can't not wait to try this again, easily one of the best beer I have had, and very easy to drink...I almost finished the bottle before the review and that rarely happens with me. The 10.2% ABV really sneak up on you!"
""
"Having had an in-date bottle in the past, the aged one was just as good - but probably no better to be honest, slightly more earthy if that makes sense to anyone!"

""
""
""
"D: This is an incredibly easy-to-drink high ABV beer. I need to find more!"

"Serving type: bottle"

"Purchased a bottle in Belgium and brought it back to the states. It was in the cellar for 4 years and I just opened it the other day. What a treat. The color was deep and beautiful. The nose was an absolute delight. Definitely candy and caramel notes. The mouthfeel was perfect in terms of body. Not too much and not too little. And the taste, well, amazing. Looking forward to going back to buy another for those blessed monks. Cheers."
"Even though this is a difficult beer to find- especially now I have come to find over the years that this has been one of the best beers I have ever had. As far as quads go it has a consistent dark malty flavor without being overbearing. It does have a very slight banana ester flavor-just a hint so may not be as noticeable. As I have found over the years drinking/trying/comparing quite a few beers especially in the quad category this one always seems to be consistently terrific but now is extremely difficult to find."
""
"Is it better than Younger? I would say they are both excellent, but I don't see the hype. There are many beers more attainable that I enjoy at least as much, but I will say the hype and story makes each try of both an experience."
"O - Screw the hype, I love this beer. I've had it, along with most of the other Belgian quads and varying ages, and this is still my favorite. I think 2-3yrs really is perfect for the beer to showcase everything."
""
"Overall: I aged this one just over 3 years and celebrated the birth of my daughter with this beer and I must say this is just a Perfect Quad."
""
""
"Overall impression: I was somewhat surprised about the differences between the batches bottled just 3 months apart, but even moreso by the subtlety of both bottles. I’d almost go so far as to call them tame, at least in the bold world of quads. Tasty, although somewhat underwhelming. Perhaps they go through something akin to the ‘awkward’ stage you often see in American barleywines. I’ll update my review if I get the chance to try fresher or older samples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have had this on numerous occasions and I always forget to review it. This bottle really surprised me compared to the past bottles I’ve had, incredibly smooth, and well balanced. World class beer, very impressive."
"O: Very drinkable, very good beer. The best Trappist beer I've had yet. the flavors, while mellow, are blended perfectly and leave a pleasant aftertaste. Kudos to the monks on a superb beer."
"O: There is a reason this beer is constantly battling for the number 1 spot."
"O: Is this one of those cases of unrealistic expectations? I'm not sure. The excessive carbonation definitely takes this bottle down a notch for me, as the first half was almost impossible to taste. But beyond that, I'd say this is a nice, but not amazing beer. I'm curious to see if it's substantially different on tap when I have a chance to visit Belgium next spring."
"Chewy but nice and light with the good carbonation. Little bit of an alcohol burn. Very complex delicious beer. I can understand the hype."
""
"--> If I'll be at the Belgium coast on vacation next year, I'll again buy a crate, but for me this beer is not worth any effort! Very disappointing and absolutely overrated!!"
""
"O: If I could give this beer a 6 out of 5 I would. It just doesn't get much better than this and I wish it was easier to find, but I cant complain too much because I was lucky to get one thanks to my wife. Just amazing!"
"Overall, an impressive blend of flavors and subdued notes. Like an artist's palate. High abv makes the repeated drinkability low beyond savoring a few in celebration. Awesome overall. No hype here."
"Overall. Just a fantastic quad. So smooth and nice subtle flavours, yet complex."
""

"O- An amazing beer, its reputation really is well deserved. One of the best beer's I've ever tasted."

"O. Having had Rochefort 10 and St. B in the last week in preparation to try the Westy 12, I am basing a lot of my review on how Westy 12 compares to those excellent beers. In all honesty I think Westy 12 is an amazing beer. For me there is quite a few similarities to St. B Abt 12. I think the Westy 12 is just a bit better overall. Very complex aroma and taste. Nice carbonated full bodied mouthfeel. Is this the best beer in the world? That is hard to say, as one of the best beers in my favorite style, I would have to say it is certainly in contention."
""
""
"Overall Westvleteren 12 impressed me more then i thought. There were so many different flavors going on that it blew me away. The best beer in the world? Maybe, maybe not. But it is a good beer that anybody should try if they have the chance."
"Unfortunately this beer came at the beginning of my beer drinking career and I'm convinced has forever tainted my taste by setting the bar so damn high. It is perfect, subtle yet bold with a fruity taste that is neither to sweet nor to tart. Light with an amber/brown color, it goes down smooth and has a taste reminiscent of times only monks could capture in a beverage. A+ and R.I.P probably the only bottle i will only drink, if you see this, get it."
""
""
""
""
"You'll want to error on the side of warmer rather than colder. The beer really comes alive as it warms. This beer doesn't need anything from me to pump it up, so all I can say is try it. If you're a beer geek, you owe it to yourself. I actually prefer Westy 8, but this is near the top of the list."

"Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious. The alcohol is not a negative factor. This is an outstanding beer."

"Severed in Chimay chalice it produces about 2 fingers width of white fluffy head that disappears somewhat quickly the color is a outstanding dark chestrnut brown. The smell is very faint I pick up the Belgium yeast, a boozy smell and very faint caramel sweetness. The first sip is amazing, where I was let down by the smell the taste blew me out of the water. Great caramel/molasses flavor, nice dark fruit like raisins or figs, and that great Belgium yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is prefect great balance between the carbonation and the body. Overall this was one of my favorite beers I had, the 10% alc was extremely well hidden in the taste. This is a dangerous beer if I could get my hands on it more often I would drink this all the time."
""
"So in a nutshell: A+ awesome brew, but not what I would call the #1 beer in the world."
""
"O: Great Quad, probably the best I have had in the style. Glad to have tried it, but it does not live up to the hype. This is surely not the best beer I have ever tried."
""

""
""

"O - I actually wanted to not like this beer as much as I did. I know it has a great deal of hype and I figured since I invested $0 on the bottle I would be going into it unbiased. It blew me away though. This is an excellent quadrupel and its worthy of its high ranking. I enjoyed it much more than the easier to find examples, and the only other quad that I have had that surpassed this was pannepot grand reserva."
"I was a bit disapointed by the lack of ""roundness"" of it. Maybe because of the age? For other beers it did not happen so often..."
""
""
""
""
""
"As close to perfection regarding quads as far as I’ve had. I suggest eating beforehand or pairing with something after you get a taste for it because this leaves the head feeling good afterwards if you aren't prepared."
"D - Its a shame that this is sort of hard to get, its very enjoyable and one I wouldn't mind pulling out from time to time. By all means, if you can grab some, definitely do so."
"Thanks to urbancaver for this one! Best birthday present ever!"
"O: A beautiful taste experience and I believe that it lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've learned that I'm just not a fan of many Quad styles, this was a fine beer but can't say it was mind blowing."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burgundy color with a thin layer of head that doesn't dissolve quickly. Smells a decent amount of cherries and of some booziness. The first taste warms up the mouth. As the heat recedes the flavors present themselves. Cherries, currants, and slight oakiness.  A complex beer but simple in its enjoyment. Glad I took this journey. Pretentiousness aside, the Westy was well worth it.  Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good. I've had this a few times, but this is the first full bottle I've savored on my own. Obviously, it's hard to get a hold of, so that hurts it, but overall, it's a great beer. A top candidate for a desert island beer."

"O-A very enjoyable Quad and could honestly drink alot of if we saw regularly on our shelves top stuff thanks mate."

"Gonna be hard to top this one. Poured a golden brown, medium head minimal lacing ... and a terrific aroma of candied sugars, figs and raisins. Excellent body with medium sweetness, hints of vanilla, dark fruits and some caramel. excellent carbonation and a solid finish. I think what sets this one apart form others it the incredible balance between the carbonation, flavors and alcohol. Hard to live up to the hype of being the highest ranked beer in the world - but definitely something everyone must try if you have the chance. It is worth it! Great beer for my 40th!!"

""
""
"O - hey it's westy. I completely love what it is. But I think I would rather have roc 10"
"O - Worth tracking down, and an excellent beer, but naturally it can't live up to the overwhelming hype attributed to it."
"O – Incredibly tasty brew. More complexity then my palate can even fathom. Taste is out of this world. Lived up to the hype for me. Always on the prowl for more."
"Pours a beautiful dark brown. It smells of sweet fruit, rum, sugar, and malts. The taste is very sweet and complex, with a good deal of alcohol. There is a nice warming mouthfeel from the alcohol, and medium carbonation. I preferred Westvleteren 8, but this was still amazing. I think perhaps this one would have benefited from a bit more aging."
"Thanks to Wyatt for this gem!!!! poured from a 12 oz glass into a tulip glass. pours a brownlish murky red color with a thin head that leaves qucikly. The smell is of yeasty fresh bread and a slight booziness too. The taste is bitter on the front end but that leaves quick and your mouth is filled with a fruity sweetness that coats your whole mouth. The sweetness stays but you still get that bitterness. It is well balanced and not boozy at all like the smell leads. I can see why this one is rated so high. while I do agree with it having a high rating I have to admit I'd take a russian imp stout over this any day. Still a great beer and I'm glad I got to try it!!! thanks Wyatt!!!"
"O: Amazingly balanced and complex. Far too smooth for how much alcohol is in there. Without a doubt, a fantastic beer that just about lives up to its hype."
"St. Bernardus is also a great beer, but really, I do believe Westvleteren is in another class."
"A really nice beer inline with or slightly better than Rochefort or St Bernadus. The monks do it right."
"O: Overall I would say this may have been one of the best beers I have ever tasted. I wish I could have had a full bottle of it but from what I had it was outstanding. I feel as though there is much more to experience from this beer because it is just so complex. If I ever get the opportunity I will definitely try this again and hopefully unlock more of the complex secrets this beer offers."
"Overall: Best beer in the world? Damn good chance of it. This beer was well worth the wait and easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely top 2 or 3. I don't know when I will get the chance to have this one again, but I certainly hope it's soon."
"A nice balanced tasting quad with flavors of dark fruits, spice, with dessert and candy qualities. The nose was a bit strong on the alcohol but for this alcohol by volume, I feel that is forgivable. I've never been overly impressed with this one like everyone else is, but it certainly is a great beer. I believe the scores more have to do with the elusive character the beer maintains, due to it's limited availability and the monks choice to not commercialize their beer."
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew, although overrated. It is on the same level as St. Bernardus and Rochefort, and I would actually prefer St. Bernardus."
"This put every trappist that is available in the states to shame. I did a side by side comparison when i got home and the old favorites paled up against the Westy."
"Overall this is an amazing beer. I've yet to have it fresh but I cant imagine it tasting any better than this bottle does right now. This is a beer I will always be seeking out."
"Dark copper brown colour with a nice white head. Sweet malts, brown sugar, light wine and raisins. Rich malt taste, light bitterness. Definite suggestions of sugar, raisins and a very light spice profile. Light alcohol burn. Rich, but not heavy and a light, but effervescent body. Up there with Rochefort 10, but a bit rarer and a bit more expensive. An ideal quad, but not one I'd buy often if only because of the price."
"Did it live up to the hype? Honestly, my favorite quad is still Rochefort 10. I'm actually relieved because this beer certainly isn't an easy one to get! I'm happy that I had the opportunity to try it, and I recommend that if you can try it...keep an open mind. Maybe it will be the best thing you ever had, but I really feel a lot of the strong ratings come from the rarity/hype around this gem. Still an AMAZING beer...no doubt about that...and it is world class. Just not my personal favorite quad!"
"i am fortunate enough to be studying in london this fall and was even more fortunate that my dad wanted to visit and see belgium and him and his friend were willing to drive to the middle of nowhere to try a beer they had never heard about. As i walked into In Dre verde my whole body was shaking with anticipation and i must say the 12 didn't let down. It was poured into the Westvleteren glass and it looked so elegant. It had a perfect one and half inch head right up to the lip. And from the first sip i could tell what an amazing beer it was. Just like the other Westys it has a full and I mean FULL body and right away you can taste 4 or 5 different flavors coming through. What most impressed me was the smoothness. From start to finish it was incredibly consistent. After all of my hyping my father and friend were also very impressed and could see why we made the trip. Can't wait to try another bottle of this when i get home"
"D: No doubt a world class beer. Very complex and hides the alcohol well. Very excited to have another two to age a few years"
"330ml bottle twice. This is the mecca of all beers. Every beer lovers journey must include this bad boy. Lucky to have traded twice for one. Pours a super syrupy brown with nearly zero head on a careful pour. Smells very bready along with nuts and dark fruit. The taste is delicate brown sugar malt with several layers of sweetness. I pickup lots of belgian dark sugar and it reminds me a bit of a well aged barleywine, but not as thick or heavy. The mouthfeel is slick and a tad syrupy with a nice medium carbonation. Mild alchohol finish on it, but I loved it."
"Overall: Such a fantastic, fantastic beer, and well worth the wait I enforced upon myself. And it lives up to the hype! It's unbelievable to me that there are Belgians out there that have the opportunity to drink this beer on a semi-regular basis. I will seek this beer out again sometime, and encourage all beer lovers to try it at some point in their lives."
"O: 4.5"
"Overall: Yes I agree. This beer is living up to the hype for me. I really enjoy this beer and I want to get my hands on more! Seek it out and enjoy it. Every beer geek needs to try this once in thier life! Willing to visit the brewery for a beer that is without a doubt World Class beer!"
"The 10.2% only become evident as the mouth dries, so well is the body and mouthfeel, a truely great beer, certainly now in my top 10, only the appearance letting it down."
"D: For a quad, drinkability is very high."
"EDIT* reading back over the reviews. i believe this beer has been subject to the tried and true over-hype phenomenon. someone says its 'the shit', and people taste it, even if it isnt there. covet this beer but dont ASSUME its the be all and end all."
"O - hands down the best quad and the best beer i've ever had to date."
"O: Excellent beer, very complex, very drinkable, and well put together. We won't talk hype, but this can't be worth whatever price my friend paid to get it back here. I'd love to have this one again side by side with the St. Bernardus abt 12."
"Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is just under medium with high, very fine carbonation. Pillowy mouthfeel. This beer was certainly good as I had expected, but I wasn't awed by it. A little sweeter than I was expecting which retracted for me."
"The setting probably had a lot to do with how much I love this beer. I drank it from the bottle on a square in Bruge during my honeymoon. It was not the ideal way to drink it but it was amazing none the less. Luckily I have one more in my cellar. I just need a reason to drink it."
"(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)"
"a murky brown with a nice creamy head to it. Higher carb that I anticipated. smell is of dates, fig, grapeskin and caramalized brown sugar. Taste is all the same. Very strong on the dark fruit flavors. I was impressed by how strong the date and fig come out in this. Very good quad. Nice balanced flavors. Good mouthfeel, but a touch high on the carbonation. This was an '09 vintage."
"O: No doubt one of the best beers I've ever had. I just can't put the glass down. So drinkable, so delicious, basically perfect."
"A pure joy to drink, there's a reason this beer is considered by many to be the #1 beer in the world. I was worried it wouldn't live up to all the hype, but it absolutely did, and everyone else tasting it felt the same way."
"O: I simply cannot recommend this beer highly enough. An excellent example of Belgian monastic brewing at its finest."
"O: seek out if you like Belgians, although st. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10 are more than adequate substitutes if not available to you"
"O: One of the best Quads I have ever had. I can definitely see why it's ranked #1."
"Can't wait to try this on tap some day."
"This beer was a pleasure to drink and felt great as it went down. Very high drinkability, this was an outstanding beer that I am happy to have tried as it's not readily available in the US and I was lucky enough to try some brought back straight from Belgium. It went down so smooth and easy, hid the ABV with perfection so it wasn’t even a factor, and this beer was just impressive in every facet of this drinking experience. This beer lived up to the hype and is a very high recommendation."
"Hard to beat."
"I have had a couple of 12s since that day, both had been aged for a couple of years. Great, but not the same. Perhaps the travel and heat altered it. Fresh is what I will always remember. The monks advocate drinking it fresh and from my experience . . . I have to agree."
"Amazing Quad. Ordered this one online, vastly overpriced, but I had to try it. Quads aren't my personal favorite style, but for a Quad this is definitely the best in my opinion. Very flavorful, with a nice level of sweetness and an interesting level of hops. Alcohol felt well masked. It poured a dark brown with perfect head left on top. Wish this was more readily available, but if I get the chance, I will definitely purchase again. Lives up to the hype."
"It is the king of beer. He has a great background. Pity that it can not simply buy"
"Overall man I wish this wasn't so hot. It feels like a typical hot young wine that needs to age maybe that will make it better? Would love to age this and try it again some day in the future."
"O: It lived up to its name. Glad to try this before hitting up Belgium in a few weeks. I will be sure to take notes of all the other great beers I am trying out there."
"O: Wasn't sure what I'd think after reading so much about it, but this definitely lives up to its reputation IMO. The overall balance is unreal and it was a complete pleasure to drink in almost every way. It is going to be a total challenge to save my 2nd bottle."
"This, perhaps, was the beer I have been most excited for from day one on BA. I never really hunted it, I knew it would always be there. Leave it to AleWatcher to make it happen for me when I wasn't even trying. This ended up being one of my favorite beers of what is probably my favorite style. I'll have to get more than one bottle of this soon."
"Overall - terrific, its a shame this is so hard for people to try. Its also a factor to bear in mind when trying to objectively review this beer."
"Overall: Just an amazing beer. Everything blends together perfectly. Kind of reminds me of a super smooth barleywine. I definitely want to have more in the future."
"Overall: I have had about 15 bottles from this case over the past 5 years. I tried to space them out while giving/sharing the others. I hope this has diminished the hype/rarity factor so that I am not too swayed by those factors. So, even at 5 years this is a wonderful, tasty beer. I may have liked it better at 3 years or even fresh but it has held up well. For those who like Rochefort 10 or any other quads this is a beer that you must try. It may not live up to the hype, for some, but it's worth the try. Even my cat loved the drop I put on the table for her. I guess it's nearly impossible to do but I wish a USA company could replicate this beer."
"Finally got to try one of these top rated beers and it doesn't disappoint. The velvety smooth mouthfeel is probably the highlight, but the taste is very balanced and complex."
"Very complex, many aromas, many dimensions. Must be examined more times."
"O- Excellent quad, alcohol is invisible unlike the Rochefort 10 and St. Bernadus ABT."
"But thats just me."
"Today (13-09-2011) I tasted a Westy 12 once more at the 'Vrede' next to the monastery Sint-Sixtus. What a great beer!! We discovered (my buddy Ed and I) that when this beer is served, not to cold but say around 17-18 degrees Celcius, it is absolutely World Class. Nothing comes close. You can drink this beer anytime of the day and take any kind of meal with it, it will hold."
"Or maybe that's just my perception..."
"O - Absolutely lived up the they hype for me. Belgian ales are typically not one of my preferred styles and this is the first one I have had that I would drink every day if it was available. Truly remarkable."
"Words cannot describe. Rich, complex, and delicious. The epitome of ultimate beerdom! Cherry, yeast, bread, full bodied, beautiful color, and packs quite a punch. Sampled at the Trappist Tasting @ The Moan and Dove, Amherst, MA. At that point I was quite libashed, so apologies for a less specific review. Try it if you can!"
"This beer is a bit underwhelming, and maybe it was the age, but I found that I've liked St. Bernardus 12 and a couple other Quads I've had in the past better."
"O - This is fantastic. Lives up to the hype. It was like a fantastic dessert or a flavorful steak that melts in your mouth."
"jd"
"Leaps and bounds better than the first Westy 12 I had that was full of sediment and aged on its side."
"O: So delicious and drinkable, could easily drink this every night for the rest of my life. Definitely the best quad that has crossed my taste buds. Simply incredible, wish this glass would last forever."
"D- Appearance wise not amazing, Flavour/aromas are subdued i guess with age. Mouthfeel retains a lovely creaminess and full mouthfeel. Overall, not a beer i would say has enhanced with age. Certainly no developing complexties. Eventhough not drinking this beer before, i cant help but feel its lost some former glory. Would love to try fresh!"
"Pours a hazy brownish copper with a tan head. The nose is slightly caramel and bready with dark fruits and plum. The taste is big, bready, yeasty plum with a touch of banana and other dark fruits and slightly caramel malts. Very smooth flavor with a very subtle complexity. Blink and you miss it. Good carbonation, good body. Overall, this is a very good beer, but it did not top the 25 year old Extra 8. Maybe worth trying once, then grab a Rochefort 10 given the relative difference in ease of acquisition."
"Overall, this beer is phenomenal and worth of it's reputation. I love Quads, have tried a number of them, and this one is the undisputed king. I can't wait to have occasion to drink my last 2."
"O - I was a bit skeptical going in as this is quite the highly hyped, idolized beer. However, the beer speaks for itself and completely crushes any of the perceived 'hype' surrounding. Delicious, and that's all."
"O: Incredible! I don't know how much of that is the rare talking, but at the first sip I was blown away. Huge and bold, but still tame and so well balanced."
"This is an amazing beer, the fact that it is so hard to get and the recipe hasn't changed for thousands of years makes drinking it a great experience. I think the 8 was better, but this one was really good as well."
"Rich, raisiney, well masked alcohol, thick. Complex like a big meaty red wine. This is one of the finest quads I have had, but I can't say it lives up to the hype. I would rank this right along side the Rochefort 10, yet the unobtainability and buyer's remorse creates a mythical presence in this beer that causes to be catapulted to the top of any beer list. This is a fine beer that should certainly be seeked out. But is it definitively the best beer in the world? Probably not."
"O - Very good."
"O - This is still one of my favorite beers of all time. From the dark, complex, flavors to the soft, velvety, feel you would be hard pressed to find a better quad. I can't wait for my next encounter with this amazing beer."
"O- What can I say that hasn't been said already... This is quite simply the best tasting beer I've ever had. Considering the relative difficulty in obtaining it, I'm not sure how many times in my life I will get to taste this beer again, but I'm very glad I had to opportunity to do so. If you have the chance, make every effort to experience this masterpiece."
"When I got this beer I was in the company of some Flemish friends. I took no time to critique it. I didn’t figure out what kind of farts it produces, or count each tiny bubble of the head. Nope, I just drank it in good company. It is thick, sweet, complex, and delicious. Now is it my favorite beer of all time? Close. Top 3 for sure. Just a total experience."
"The aroma hints of grapes and some dark fruits as well. The flavor is grapes and dark fruits mixed with wonderful Belgian yeast characteristics - and no hotness whatsoever. This is delicious, well balanced, and very smooth. The mouthfeel is amazingly soft and effervescent like real Champagne."
"Gotta put the 8 a hair above this brew, but damn is it close. I think it comes down to personal preference - I prefer dubbels to quads or tripels (I'd make a lousy figure skater) as a general rule. However, I do enjoy a fine quadrupel, and this is most certainly among the top of its class."
"Overall, truly an excellent beer. Given the availability and price disparities, I would go for the Rochefort 10, but this is just wonderful. Glad I got to try it."
"And unless I want to think that it's all downhill from here, I have to believe that until the end of my beer-drinking days."
"This seemed to have some oxidation going on, but it was spectacular nonetheless. Medium bodied with good carbonation. I may need to seek out more bottles for a follow up try soon."
"Utterly complex and unique; who wouldn’t want to drink it? Frankly, both the missus and I were expecting this one to disappoint a bit, given its chargin’ hype train, and the fact that a Belgian quadrupel is not really a go-to style for me. This one, however, has won us over completely with its subtle complexity. There are other beers that have blown my mind more personally, but I can’t think of any that have matched this one in its refinement. Subtle, but super-assertive. Certainly nobody’s session beer, but one that I would love to have on ANY occasion."
"Reviewed from Notes: I had this amazing brew on a trip to Europe that was as equally amazing. Sampled at In De Vrede in the shadow of the abbey of Saint Sixtus, it really doesn't get any better than that. This nectar of the Gods pours a lovely dark brown color, aroma is of fruit, plumbs and sugar canes. As soon as you take a sip you realize that this beer lives up to the hype..Does it get any better than this? NO. This beer coats the tongue in sweet fruit flavors and the alcohol is so well hidden that you are not aware of the effects. That is until you walk down the path at Westvleteren to the shrine and realize that you are extremely drunk. This is OK you remind yourself, as you are in Europe at the Mecca for all beer drinkers. If you ever have the chance to visit PLEASE do..you will not be disappointed. We purchased some at De Bier Temple in Brussels. The lady there has plenty to go around, so if you miss the ""Beer line"" or all orders are full, fear not she has you covered. Do yourself a favor and grab a Westy, it is what the Gods Drink! Cheers!"
"O: Lives up to its promise. Super hard to get. Lucked out with several bottles from the recent release in Vancouver BC."
"The head was just right, smell and taste are really great. Its a beer to drink while you are in the company of good friends or family.Cant wait to have one with my father."
"O-Wow. This is amazing."
"NOTE: eBay prices are far too much for a bottle. Please don't buy these bottles from that site. The practice is against the wishes of the Monks and in an unbelievable inflation of the prices for each bottle. If you really need a small number of bottles, please post to the Belgium forum and I'm almost certain that you will be taken care of."
"O: Extremely complex and impressive quad. I was absolutely impressed at how well the alcohol is masked. Sure, you can tell it's there, but at 10.2% you'd think it would be more noticeable. Definitely worth the hype. I brought a bottle home with me to cellar. Current plan is break it out for a special occasion in a year or so."
"Overall there is just something amazingly drinkable and smooth about this big flavorful beer. Almost silky on the palate. Rounded flavors, I'm impressed."
"Pours cloudy amber with a tad bit of reddish pink hue. Minimal, but creamy head around the edge of the glass. The nose is pounding with grape/honey/wood. On the tongue it is sweet, quite sweet, grapes or raisins, then the alcohol bites you in the rear, but subtly. Mouthfeel is excellent, goes well with the fruity explosion. Overall, the Westy definitely lives up to the hype and I was very excited to drink it."
"Overall - super smooth and easy to drink. I concur on the hype to this. Super smooth and savory!"
"O- This beer is incredible. Believe the hype."
"Anyway, on to the review, as you can see from the video, this beer was properly poured into a signature Westvleteren goblet. Dark caramelized brown in color, hazy, moderately carbonated, with a beautifully crafted light tan head that settled right around the ""Trappist"" logo of the glass, retained throughout the session, and exhibited some fine lacing. Robust aroma, dark fruits, dark sugars. Extremely full of flavor, smooth, candi sugars, toffee, dark cherries, raisins, alcohol is noticeable but not at all detrimental. Earthy, organic, chewy, complex... Medium mouthfeel, but full of flavor, slightly bitter aftertaste, and very drinkable."
"Hard to tell if this is the best beer that I have ever had, but I will always remember the day in Nice, France when I first tried this beer. This beer wins for my favorite ""beer moment""."
"Despite its religious inspiration this really is a beer that strikes at your intellect and curiosity more than the heart. For me this is what makes it so inspiring. I'm still very much just beginning to understanding Westy 12 but I can recognise its genius which would have totally missed me had I drunk it as a beer rookie many years ago. And this is what makes me think that people here award it top marks based on reputation alone. Either that or BAs really have some of the most sophisticated and perceptive palates you'll find anywhere."
"Big thanks to Jason for sharing this rare gem with me at the bottle share! Pours a murky brown color with a small tan head that sticks around for a little. Scent is delicious candied dark fruits and brown sugar. Taste is initially sweet caramel, followed by figs and prunes. Lots of dark fruits with hints of green apple, molasses, and brown sugar. There is also some alcohol taste to it, but not overwhelming at all. The complexity of this beer is ridiculous. Mouthfeel is extremely dry and full-bodied. Well-balanced. Drinkability is VERY HIGH for the ABV. Overall, this beer is outstanding and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it. However, the beer does not blow Rochefort 10 outta the water, so I'm not sure if it's worth all the trouble getting one."
"overall - very nice beer, would gladly drink it again and was thrilled i finally got to try it. but i'm not understanding the holy grail status."
"O- If this were local and reasonably priced I could easily drink this on a regular basis. Definitely lived up to the hype and I will seek this out again."
"O- I've had Westy 12 a couple times now. Once was pretty good, but this batch seems to be a step up from the last time I had it. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had, and one of my favorite styles as well. If you get a chance to try this beer, you'll never forget it. It's a masterpiece that gets better w/ every sip. Cheers, Advocates!"
"I think the age of this bottle is certainly bringing it down a bit. I have several newer versions and will update this review to reflect the best buy date."
"M/O: Very good carbonation and presentation even after aged for a year. Very good balance with strong alcohol aroma but not overpowering the flavor or the texture This beer is balanced on a knifes edge presenting weight and superior drinkability."
"M: Medium feel with lots of carbonation. Smooth and nice overall."
"this beer pours a nice brown color wh a small off white head that recedes quickly. the smell is sweet, slightly spicey and reminds me of concord grapes. the taste follows suit with a very mild yeasty spiciness, with amazing layers of fruit flavors coming through and a nice sweet finish, but not too sweet. the mouthfeel is full and medium carbed overall this beer more than lived up to the hype. would definitely trade for this beer again."
"Overall: Wonder full, I'm glad I tried it, but I prefer some others. Particularly given the cost and difficulty getting this. Perhaps some fresh from the brewer would be ideal."
"T: Lots of raisin and brown sugar flavor upfront along with some brandy. Hints of plum and raisin on the finish along with a nice warmness on the way down. Some spiciness and a bit of white pepper to be found in this as well. Well worth it's reputation. I don't know if it's my favorite beer ever (still a sucker for Abyss), but this is a stellar beer."
"OVERALL: A very nice beer. Maybe it was all the hype, but I can definitely see how this is voted the best beer in the world. The complexity was remarkable. Quadrupels are not my favorite style, but I thoroughly enjoyed Westvleteren 12. If it wasn't so expensive and so damn hard to get, I would definitely put this beer in my rotation."
"O - This is #1. It was extremely good, but not sure if it is my #1."
"This pours out with a murky brown color with some orange highlights, the head is kind of minimals but has a little white ring around the glass. The smell of this beer is very good. Lots of sweet fruit aromas a little Belgian yeast on the nose. Not much in way or hops. The taste is very good, the flavors of apple, fig, and white grapes all come together in a very nice combo. When the beer is colder the mouthfeel is a little thicker feeling. Once it warms up it thins out and the booze aromas start to show. The beer as a whole is very good. It's incredibly easy to drink, it's great to savor over the course an hour if you want to. The finish is dry but smooth and overall just really nice. I can see why people love it so much."
"Overall, a very nice quad, not sure it is worth the hype, but being a beer geek, you have to try it."
"O: Overall I can def see why this is world class. Amazing beer"
"The smell was a blend of date & fig, sweet brown sugar and a bready yeastiness. The taste followed right along with where the nose was leading, but stepped up the complexity with additional elements. A peppery spiciness was there along with the candied dark fruits, a little bit of a vanilla and warming alcohol. This is an extremely well rounded and balanced quad flavor. The feel was equally as pleasant - full bodied, with a medium amount of carbonation. The finish was fantastic and imparted no harsh alcohol component. Overall this was a real treat to try - I don't know if after one bottle I'm ready to place it above some of my other quad favorites (St. B, Rochefort 10) but it is definitely a member of the exclusive group of top tier beers of this style."
"O: I love this beer and will most likely be ISO more, a great treat. Glad I got to try this!"
"O - not very drinkable but tied for #3 out of the 10 best quads. Would do MUCH better with some age."
"I opened the 2010 bottle that I had, and really am a fan. I did this side-by-side with a 2003 bottle and much preferred the newer, fresher version. It was a very interesting beer, definitely had a ton of taste and some fruit flavor to it. It was very strong, but even for a quad, I didn't get a strong burn or anything like that from the alcohol. I am interested to open my 2008 and do a test of the middle-of-the-road version."
"This beer is amazing. Get it. Try it."
"I don't think it's MY favorite, but it's very delicious and complex."
"The feel on this is nice. Really a dry beer with a full body. Soft carbonation makes this one really nice. Overall, this is clearly a well made beer. For my money, I can get stuff stateside that I'll be just as happy with. But don't get me wrong, this one is a rare treat that I'll accept anytime."
"O: One of the best beers in the world? Well in my opinion: it's clearly a fantastic beer, and in comparison to the St. Bernardus; It's very similar in taste and smell, but in this beer the smell and taste are so much stronger. When it comes to quads; this one is very nice, but I prefer Rochefort 10."
"May I just express my disappointment at how regular this was for the top beer in the world."
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. Cap reads 06.10.13. It pours a dark, semi-cloudy burnt auburn topped by a healthy tower of cream foam. The nose comprises dark greens, black pepper, clove, very bready yeast, nutmeg, figs, and light cocoa. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, nutmeg, mild milk chocolate, Belgian yeast, light citrus peel, light cardamom, dark greens, candi sugar, and grass. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light-ish moderate carbonation and an almost astringently chewily dry finish. Overall, this stuff was indeed tasty (and admittedly a little young), but it felt a bit wrong on my tongue. Honestly, I generally enjoyed it, but I've had plenty of better quads in my day."
"I decided to review this beer not because I could possibly add anything others have not already, but because this beer somehow is rated the same as pliny the younger. And although I haven't had that beer but the similarly rated elder, I feel there has to be some justice in this world. The pliny is a very good beer, I must admit, and it is a completely different beast, but I don't think it inhabits the same universe as Westvleteren. Westvleteren is a perfect beer. It is not THE perfect beer. But it is, IMHO, absolutely great. It is just so perfectly balanced. It really is a 5 out of 5 sort of a beer. If you have the money and the great luck to find it somehow, you must try it."
"Overall an obviously world class beer. Not sure if I agree that it's the best in the world but it is good. Would grab this any time I have the chance."
"Overall, its good, no where near the best. Give me a Rochefort 10 and call it a day."
"Verdict: Unfortunately, this doesn't pass even the second tier of quads I have had, and unfortunately it's not the Monks' fault as this is simply a question of poor storage...what a bummer."
"Lots of chocolate and bready yeast. I am surprised by the amount of roast this has! A bit of an earthier, woody tone to it compared to the St. Bernardus and Rochefort. Body is just about right, not quite chewy but plenty viscous. This most certainly is a world class beverage, but I am pretty surprised at how close St. Bernardus comes to this. The Rochefort came in a distant third for me. Great beer, cant wait to try one in Belgium one of these days..."
"Pours cloudy amber with a light head. The aroma is dark fruits and malty. Flavor is very malty, with a sweet finish. Overall a very good belgium quad. Not really sure if it deserves the number 1 overall beer, but thats maybe because it's not my favorite style."
"Bottle shared by colonelforbin. Big thanks Mike. Bottled on 15 December 2009. Pours a cola brown with a small light that has very good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. A little big of yeast can be seen floating in it. Aroma is big dark, plum, raisin, light brown sugar, a light nuttiness, Belgian yeast, and light alcohol. The taste is sweet with raisin, plum, brown sugar, hints of nuts. No alcohol to be found in the taste. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Really smooth for being such a big beer. A very good beer. Certainly one of the best quads I had. I wouldn't say it was one of my personal favorites, but I can certainly see how it has the reputation that it does."
"The alcohol came through on the palate but not in a bad way. What an awesome brew. I wish I had a case of this"
"O: overall a decent beer, but there are some things I felt it was lacking. I wish that there was some more complexity in the flavor, it's a little bit like a glorified malt drink, more dessert wine than beer. I also found the body a little watery. It's really hard to believe it's 10%, it's so well blended that it tastes non-alcoholic."
"O/D - I can't see how people consider this the best tasting beer in the world. But it's lovely complexity and texture are world class. It's amazingly drinkable, wonderfully smooth and flavourful. The yeast character at the start is a surpise, but once it opens up it becomes a great, complex beer. It seems alot more yeasty and sugary than other quads...probably due to the amount of candi sugar used. My girlfriend thought it was the best beer she'd ever had."
"O: Love it, which it wasnt so hard to get or damn expensive."
"D: Easy to drink and would drink another but want to save one for a couple years."
"Not the beast I expected but a Shakespearean achievement of fermentation. A keystone of western culture."
"Taste is malty sweet, candi sugar, rum notes, bready plum flavors, alcohol is very well hidden, nice and chewy. Carbonation is perfect. Some banana and clove with some spicy characteristics. A very complex beer, lots going on here. A real treat wish I could drink this more often."
"Definitely one to age for 5+ years."
"It's definitely a very good drink, and well worth getting your hands on one. I didn't like it quite as much as the 8, but it's probably more a style preference than anything else. I'm not sure exactly how old the bottle was, at least 4 months, and probably older."
"This bottle was courtesy of lotsaswigs (thanks Eric!) at DLD. The bottle was from '08. It poured a dark raisin brown, very cloudy, with a light cream colored head. The head was ultimately smooth and creamy and sat atop the brew in such a delicate manner. It looked exceptional! The aromas consisted of a lot of yeast, bananas, cloves, freshly baked bread, and it had a sweet and dry malty finish. The flavors were very full and consisted of bananas, yeast, freshly baked bread, and some type of nut (hazelnut perhaps). It was simply delicious. It was very full in body and quite thick. It was also exceptionally smooth. Wow, this is hands down the best Quad I've ever had. What an amazing beer. Thanks again Eric!"
"Wow."
"Overall: Only downside was price. Worth it for the experience."
"Overall - Lived up to the hype. I was hoping i wouldn't be let down and i wasn't. I would call this the best beer in the world for sure."
"O- Sweet and thick. A joyous discovery. Doesn't get much better. The reason Trappists are the best. Westy 12 you have my heart."
"I like it. Its my 3rd lash at the 12 and I hope I get another go."
"This is a medium bodied brew that has a lively, prickly level of carbonation. A little young, green yeastiness is present throughout the flavor profile. This is more herbal and bitter than I was expecting with hops being more evident than I would prefer but regardless it is balanced well and enjoyable. I couldn't wait any longer to open this brew and finally give it a try. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations, shame on me for opening this too early. Perhaps I will need to acquire a vintage bottle and revisit my review."
"I paired it with a Polyface Farms ""Fauxo-"" buco (adult beef shank), risotto milanese, sugar snap peas, and sour cream biscuits. An excellent pairing, but not perfect -- the beer was actually a bit strong for the food. It could stand a stronger, heartier dish, but it does love the garlic-tomato stewed meat and marrow."
"Overall, this is a textbook quadrupel. It was not, however, markedly better than the neighboring St. Bernardus. I understand that the rarity of this beer may drive up the ratings a bit, and that's understandable, but this is not the best beer, or even quadrupel I have had. It was, however, fantastic, and I highly recommend trying one if you have the opportunity to visit In de Vrede. The pilgrimage is worthwhile."
"D: If I could procure this readily, I would drink it every night."
"Ahhhh, the question that can not be answered: is this the best beer in the world? It is certainly one of the best I've ever had, but I'm fairly new to the ticking scene, so I don't know how I'll ever k ow, unless I get my hands on a case and can compare every year or so to the new beers I've come across. Overall wonderful and one I'm glad to have ticked."
"Purchased this at de Bier Tempel in Brussels and had it in my hotel room, which was actually equipped with a bottle opener and a proper beer glass. This beer pours deep, ruby-tinted brown with a huge and dense fluffy white head. The nose is malty and complex, with notes of dark dried fruits, cocoa, honey, and faint spiciness. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and the taste is complex with more dark fruit and caramel with almost port-like flavours. Alcohol is present and warming, but not hot despite the ABV of 11%. Probably not the best beer I’ve ever had, but damn good."
"Not quite up there with the worlds greatest quad, Rochefort 10, but damn it came close."
"O-Not quite the greatest beer in the world at all. Very good but nothing over and above other similar of the style. I feel that the effort for this one is too much for the reward."
"I am planning another trip to europe this year so maybe i will get to belgium and who knows, maybe get to the abbey to try the other 2 beers they produce!"
"d - i cannot help but reiterate that i think this is one of the most balanced beers that i have had. which is what makes this beer very good. i feel that i could drink this beer for any occasion and probably put back more than one if they weren't so expensive. this is definitely a beer that everyone should try one in their life."
"O: This beer is good. Obviously well crafted. Multilayered and complex. Unfortunately, I disagree it stands up to Rochefort 10, oddly, given the last review I did of that beer. I will have to review it again, as I tasted tonight side by side this beer and found it in the forefront."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a very drinkable beer. Each sip follows the last quite naturally and easily. But for the ABV I could sit and sip on this beer all night. I’ll certainly be willing to have another should the opportunity arise. My overall impression is that this is definitely a well made, first rate beer. I don’t know that I’d say it’s the best in the world but it well deserves to be right up there in competition for that honor."
"Overall, a very nice beer. A tad light for the style, and not a ""holy poop, this is great"" beer. Worth the adventure to secure one...or two"
"D- Only my second quad, and this is by far the better of the two. Didn't like my first quad, so I was a little apprehensive of this, but it lived up to expectations as a great beer. Wish I had the opportunity to get a couple and enjoy with more people."
"Note that the numeric review values correspond to the two year."
"Overall: This beer is indeed legendary. It's reputation is well deserved. I know this review has thusfar seemed as if I've been kissing Westvleteren's ass due to the hype. But it really is the best beer I've ever tried, and I've just tried to say why. It is such a shame that this beer is so rare. Because it is a real treat."
"This is without a doubt a world class beer. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that it contained over 10% alcohol. I want to give a huge thanks to Brabander for sending me 2 bottles and giving me the chance to try this delicious beer. Hopefully I'll be able to try it again next year when I'm in Belgium."
"Cracked two of these on my 50th b-day in February. Poured into GABF glass taster glasses, shared with my girlfriend's youngest son. Poured a nice dark brown/black with a nice head. What else can be said about this one? Taste was F'n Fantastic to put it mildly. I'd honestly have to say that this was/is the best beer I've had to date."
"Split two ways and poured into my chalice. Great two finger creamy light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aromas of light brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toffee, dates, plums, and cherries. Taste just like it smells with a dominant dark fruit taste. Creamy mouthfeel and smooth. Best beer I have tasted. Couldn't find a single flaw"
"Overall: Excellent beer. If you like good beer, it's worth trying to find. Even if you're an IPA or Stout drinker, it's an experience worth trying at least once. If you like strong ales, it's very probably top of the heap."
"O - Overall, I am not disappointed one bit. However, I am a bit surprised on the booziness of this beer. Amazing Quad. Best beer in the world...? Maybe. Worldclass...? DEFINITELY. I'd really love to try one that has some solid age on it...I bet it would be insane. I do understand all the comparisons to some of the other better known quads and I do understand some folks choosing other Quads over this one. I'd love to do a blind test next to some of my other favs."
"I poured from a 11.2 oucne bottle into a snifter. The pour is a cloudy caramel with a massive, sticky white head. The aroma is sweet with heavy dark fruit notes. The flavor starts with sweet plums and dates. It rounds out with an almost candy like sweetness and finishes with hot alcohol. It has a creamy full mouthfeel, nice carbonation. The beer is a great quad. Definitely world class, very glad to have tried it."
"I feel very lucky to have had this beer more than once during my trip to Belgium!"
"Probably one of my favorite beers ever and I'm usually an American hops kinda guy. Trade more of this with me and I'll be your best friend!"
"Cheers"
"drinkability: world class and amzing expereince. glad to have tried it"
"#1200"
"I turned to my wife and said ""this is without question the best beer I've ever had"". I felt vindicated when I found out later that I was sampling one of the highest rated and most sought after beers in the world. Brought a couple bottles home for my first wedding anniversary and I can't wait to drink them."
"Pours a a very dark murky red, little head or lacing. Aroma is hints of raisins, plums, prunes, and figs. First sip...Super smooth. Tons of different flavors dance around, cherries, mollasses, brown sugar, raisins and even a hint of chocolate. Each sip brings all of these and others, all perfectly blended and smooth to sip. No notice of the booze, even as it warms. Mouthfeel is smooth yet still a little crisp, not cloying at all. A beer worth waiting for!!"
"The CPJ"
"O: Highly drinkable, but not what I expected...maybe an off bottle. Nice beer, but to me, not the #2 beer in the world."
"D: Goes down very easily with the crispness. Overall, a fantastic beer and definitely the gold standard for quads."
"My dear Lord. This beer poured with a perfect, beautiful head that left a lace that was almost better that a woman's. Dark amber brown, with a clarity if poured with the retraction move utilized on most Belgians with internal fermentation. It almost kills me to wait and look, because I know what's next. The flavor is outstanding, dare I say epic. The fact that it pegs the meter in all aspects of beer flavors, while at the same time maintaining a perfect balancing act, is nothing short of awesome. The yeasty flavor coupled with the hard water provide the backbone for the dry and floral flavors that dance with the light malt and hops. It finishes dry and satisfying, and begs you to open another with its tempting warm alcohol in the back of the throat. Please don't hate me for having cases of this beer in my basement when I lived in Belgium. My friend's Belgian wife was very adept at acquiring copious amounts of this platinum liquid. This is my favorite beer in the universe, and has been for over ten years."
"Luxurious, brilliant and inviting to the palette. What's cool is that the taste differs slightly between a sip and a gulp. On the sip I get a refined succulent smooth silky grape and fig personality. On the gulp it's velvety but punchy surrounded by black cherry malts, dark candi sugar and toffee with a cream soda back end then a tremendously dry frothy finish. What's peculiar is that not a single profile overpowers the other. I think what makes this work and what keeps coming to mind is its incredible balance. Its complexity shines.A couple of sips toward the end it turned a peppery anise and even floral at one point. I really wish this bottle wasn't so expensive because I'd like to re-explore this beer and give it another whirl but alas, my hasty dive has unfortunately found the bottom of my glass and to be honest with you, am a little disheartened that I can't enjoy more of this magnificent brew. Westy 12 tastes incredible fresh, I bet it's even better aged. I'm going to let the other bottles sit in the cool humid darkness for another year and come back to let you know how the flavors marry."
"M/D: This had medium amount of carbonation, which allowed a lot of the subtleties to be appreciated throughout the tasting. A well-balanced and complex beer. I would love to let there be some age on the beer and see what it does. But a fresh one is superb, so I cannot complain"
"4.5 D: I suppose this does live up to the hype. It's an excellent brew, but I'm not so sure that it's that much better that easier to get examples. Still, quite a brew!"
"Thanks goes out to davolebomb for this one. Been waiting for this one for a long time like everyone else. Drinkin it with him right now. Poured a cola/chestnut like apperance with moderate head. Very nice amount of carbonation that gave a very satisfying tang to it. Very delicious beer, prob not number 1 though thats what its title proclaims. Very nice spicy fruity taste that complements the smooth creamy maltiness of it. A very rich package all together. I wouldn't prob pay this much again for the beer, but I am certainly happy I was able to have it finally."
"D-without a doubt this beer in a class of its own i only wish id could be able to drink this all night long"
"Over all an incredible beer that I was glad to finally try. Can't say I'd climb any mountains to get this again, but I certainly wouldn't say no if one happened to fall in my lap again."
"Re-reviewed as this was shared among a variety of other quads as part of the QuadShowdown - amazingly, out of 13 quads, we ranked this the absolute lowest. 2010 vintage. Poured a dark brown, with a dark cream coloured head. Great retention and a bit of lace. Nose is really grape-y, sweet with a lot of Welch's grape juiciness. Some sugary notes and a bit of vanilla. Taste reflects the nose, more grape and Welch's, some balance but there's just a great amount of grape juice here. Some caramel, darker fruits and sugar, but not alot of complexity. Medium-medium heavy mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess, with some lingering saccharine and grape notes. Modest, but feels too young. 4/4/35/4/35"
"D-Is it better than the Rochefort 10? I don't think so. Still, this is fantastic stuff, perfect for a special occasion."
"What is there still to say about this beer that was not said before. Maybe that fresh, this beer is not supposed to be #1 in the world (rochefort 10 and sint bernardus abt are superior fresh), at least to my opinion. With a little bit of age however, this beer becomes by far the best quad in the world! So, if you get your hands on a bottle, be patient and store it for at least one year. Cheers"
"D - this is beer you drink with your eyes closed. You want to experience it slowly and methodically."
"Overall, this beer incredibly complex, delicious and extremely quaffable. The best example of the style that I've tried and one of the best beers I've ever drank."
"Not my favorite style, and definately not my favorite beer, but this is by far my favorite beer of this style."
"D: I wish I had another... and another. I wish I could do this experience justice, I almost didn't write a review."
"There is a general warming overall but the alcohol is so well hidden it really is a work of art. Little to no phenolic aftertastes. Just a great amount of balance in the beer. Wonderful!"
"O- Second time I've had this, first time I had a whole bottle to myself. Hype has been lived up to and exceeded two times now. This is the real deal. Do what you can to get this."
"I have read many times that Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt 12 are good substitutions for Westy 12. I have had both on multiple occasions and could not disagree more. There is no substitute for this beer! May have found a new favorite beer."
"Masterfully crafted, oh and uh...better than Rochefort 10!"
"Pours dark mahogany with vibrant ruby red tones showing in the light, tight sticky white head and nice lace showing along the glass. Smells of subtle alcohol, fig, brown sugar, yeast, plum, raisin, cherry, faint leathery notes, dark fruit. Nose is stunning on this one. Tastes of yeast, dark fruit, alcohol, toffee, vanilla, fig, plum, raisin, dark sugar and something almost oak like that are behind the vanilla notes. Every sip of this opens up something new or complimentary. Medium to full mouthfeel that is smooth as silk with a delicate, light carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, ABV is hidden well and its so very tasty and flavorful. Does it live up to it's hype? it certainly comes close. Maybe the best I've ever had and absolutely in my top 3. Thanks to Volo for doing a side by side of all three Westy's that was an amazing idea!"
"Impression: The finest beer I've tasted. Hope to taste a better. Doubt I will. Doubt there is one."
"Okay, the hype makes more sense now. I had the 8, I rated it highly, but it wasn't mindblowing. This beer is an entirely different animal. Quite simply, this are masters brewing a recipe that has been passed down from masters. Fantastic, so deep and broad, yet because it is surprisingly light, extremely drinkable. Find it if you can, it will be worth the hassle."
"DB- The fresh bread and yeast profile here surely make this one a treat. At 10%, the ABV is a ghost and this one drinks dangerously smoothly. I could easily throwback a few bottles of this a week if it were available to me. Complex but balanced."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability to me are the true highlights of this beer. 10.2%, uh whaaa? Not even really a hint of that present. Light, extremely smooth and a bit too drinkable. Even as it warmed to about room temperature, this only improved."
"easy to drink, much to easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This might be sacrilegious but, I feel I money were no object that this would be my session beer. A few of these would be great after mowing the grass."
"D- I could sip on this beer all night long. Great flavors and great mouthfeel make this a winner. I will be seeking this out for future Green Bay Packer Super Bowl celebrations."
"I really enjoyed this, and would highly recommend it. Thanks again to Urbancaver for his generosity."
"Pours a darker brown. Almost like brown sugar with lots of frothy head. Very very pretty. Smells yeasty and flowery. Lots of light and dark fruity flavours. Tastes very smooth and clean. Amazing on the palette. Especially as it warms up. A slight sharpness and hint of the alcohol content but very drinkable"
"D: If I lived in Belgium, I would drink this every night of the week. It is truly amazing. Only if..."
"Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe my palate was not feeling it, I am just not finding what makes this the worlds best beer. Pleasant to drink, I am not sure I want more than one in a sitting. Good beer, worth trying atleast once in your lifetime."
"This is my second Westy 12 and although it's a very good beer it doesn't strike me as a world class contender. Very good but not worthy of all the hype. I was also surprised on the level of oxidation."
"Poured slightly chilled into a chalice with a hazy opaque brown body. Hazelnut color with lighter tobacco like hues around the edges, fluffy tall white head with nice retention. Smells like figs and fine cognac. Bready and caramel sweet odors in the nose, too. Taste is raisin and fig with brown sugar and slight booze. Sweet and caramel, malts are very pronounced with a slight floral background. Very clean and smooth, booze is not very apparent in taste or feel. Silky character to the body with low to moderate carbonation. This beer was extremely complex and balanced, rich and luxurious, and just downright delicious. I can see why this is touted as the best beer in the world, I hope that I get the chance to try this again and maybe get a few bottles to age."
"D - I am stunned that this is 10+%abv, it drinks wonderfully with zero alcohol heat. The dryness in the finish is my only drinkability related criticism. Lots of nuance and complexity, solid beer."
"This beer deserves its status as one of the best. THE best? Who knows. Westy 12 is a dry, balanced Quad, and this is what makes it a beautiful beer."
"D: Westy 12 and Hair of the Dog Adam are the two most complex and interesting beers I have ever had. There is a refined elegance to everything about this beer, from the packaging, to the aroma and taste."
"O: Overall, this beer is INSANELY good. I just wish it was more available to get, but oh well. I would recommend that any who likes belgian beers, especially Quads and Strong Dark Ales, this is a MUST try."
"Aroma is wildly delicious - sweet figs in honey, toffee, an immediately noticeable vinous presence, rum sugars, candied dates. A rich, fresh maple syrup is announced. Pour is deep chestnut brown with a small, cobwebby beige head. A highly-anticipated first sip. This has the round, chewy malt of St. Bernardus 12, but has a richer fruit presence and is more refined. Creamy, wonderful mouthfeel. Just beautifully balanced and well-crafted. As with Rochefort, an impression of overripe banana makes itself known. This is fucking amazing. A brilliant spicy note, like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom swirl about the dark fruits and rich, deep alcoholic sugars. I don't know if I''ve ever enjoyed a bottle of beer this much. If my tooth wasn't hurting I probably would have enjoyed it even more."
"shared with whiterascal."
"All beer connoisseurs must at least try the #1 rated beer in the world. Excellent !"
"worthy to note that there was no eureka moment upon first sipping it, but as you drink, the brew really opens up. hands down a world class beer, but THE best? hmm... not sure i could give any beer that distinction. were rochefort 10 as difficult to come by i think it would marshall a similar hype. that said, it's easily a top 5 candidate in my book."
"will be doing a side by side with rochefort 10 later this week to determine which I like better, right now it's pretty up in the air. i would have liked more of an emphasis on the dark fruits in the taste, but the presence of other nice flavors certainly makes up."
"I figured the ""best beer in the world"" would be more mind blowing - but this is more cerebral. It doesn't stand out in any one way, but it seems a great exercise in balance. Don't get me wrong, it's strong, but restrained."
"This beer is almost scary drinkable as it goes down so easy with almost zero hint of alcohol. In my opinion, the Westy 12 deserves every bit of hype that it gets."
"I'm very lucky/thankful to have a chance to try this beer. Pours a deep brown with an inch of foamy off-white head on top. This beer is not black but you can't see anything through the glass. Lots of lacing on the sides of my glass as I lift it to drink. I love the smell of the Belgian yeast in this beer, it smells like a really sweet apple cider. Lots going on with the flavor of this beer but I taste lots of sugary apple flavored yeast. There are also some slight hints of dark fruit and a nutty finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but with a ""lively"" feeling of carbonation. There is hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Everything about this beer was great, and with the exception of the mouthfeel I hardly noticed any of the alcohol presence. I would drink this again or consecutively if it were readily available."
"Only place I was let down was mouthfeel. I've come to enjoy carbonation, and was slightly disappointed. To each their own."
"Full bodied, creamy and very smooth. Has a certain lightness to it, soft. Alcohol heat shows up and lingers long past the finish..."
"10% ABV. Tasted on self-proclaimed ""Westy day"" 01/06/11 with my craft beer aficionado buddy. This quad made of perfection was bottled in 2010 (with date stamped 15.10.13 on cap) and given the title ""Baby Westy"" by us because of its perfection from birth. Currently, ranked the world's best beer gave off an opaque brown/copper appearance. As you drink it, you see many different layers of color - multi-layered complex. Smell hints of Belgium candy sugar. Mouthability and drinkability gave off a smooth and perfect balance. I could taste caramel, raisins, licorice, figs, maybe hint of orange peels, and candied sugar. Additional notes: A beer beyond measure and perfection. Now we can fully measure taste of all beers going forward now that we've had a Westy 12. By drinking the Westy 12, I wouldn't mind joining the St. Sixtus monastery. Humbling experience. Me: I feel buzzed already, Friend: No, its probably the euphoria of drinking this beer. This is a heavenly task that I would totally kill someone if he drank it down in one big gulp. The Westy 12 is indeed the ""Holy Grail of Beers""!"
"O - Great beer, but not the world-changer that the hype makes it out to be. There are just too many easily-obtainable beers in this category that are close to it in quality for me to work this hard for another one."
"-Well, if I lived next to the brewery, or even within 200 miles, this might be the best beer ever.... But I don't, so it isn't. If I did live that close, I can't honestly say that a Saison, Strong Pale or Dark, or a really nice Triple wouldn't tempt me to stray (Really, Belgium has all the super model beers). However, this is by far the best Quad I have ever had and would love to drink it again someday."
"So is it the greatest beer in the world? That's hard to say. It certainly has an appeal to it due to the rarity and trouble taken to get it, but I'm not sure if that should be taken into account too much. In my opinion, it's an incredible beer, but I think I let the hype get to me a bit and was expecting a bit more. I have a few more bottles, so hopefully in a few years I'll revisit this beer."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability - SpinRSX and i had this debate, but i think this is a well rounded beer and brings complexity to the menu. This is something that was more of an investment and a sample, but if i could drink it daily i would love too."
"Drink - I'm happy I got to check this beer off my want list. I'm sure the fact that it is hard to get adds to the hype and positive reviews; but it really is a must try and a fantastic beer."
"and/or Rochefort 10 (only had them fresh) before I truly make the call. Any which way, it is a phenomenal beer."
"Pours a murky amber-brown with a rocky off-white head. Smells of wine, peppery yeast, wheat spice, kind of like hopped up Bitburger. Taste is subdued, sweet but not in your face; I get some cola, toffee, white wine, hop bitterness on the very back that is barely there, some clove spice, mellow flavor for sure. I like the mellowness of this compared to similar brews with in-your-face spice that makes me wish I was drinking something else. Carbonation is high and mouthfeel isn't thick at all; very drinkable as the sugars aren't cloying, the pepper-clove character seems to cleans that 'sugar overload' from the palate. Drinkability was marked down to the exclusivity of this, if I could find it down the street I would sit through a sixer of it and crawl on my lips to my bed. A decent beer indeed, but nothing I'd trade something special out of my cellar for. Verdict: the best of the Belgian styles that I have tried thus far, but certainly not a game changer for me."
"D It is high in alcohol, therefore you won't be drinking a lot of these at one sitting. However, aside from the high alcohol, it is one of the most drinkable Belgian beers I have tried. Wonderful. 5"
"D. incredibly drinkable for its alcohol content. gives an experience that is truly unique and fulfilling in all beer drinking aspects."
"M/D-This is as good as you have heard so stop reading and try to get one."
"Overall, a really great beer and possibly my favorite of this style. I didn't expect this to be my number one beer of all time, but I definitely enjoyed it immensely. I'm really happy to have tried this and crossed it off my beer bucket list."
"D: Extremely drinkable, especially for a beer of this strength. I'd give it a 6 if I could in this category."
"Overall this is a terrific beer. And most certainly the best quad I have ever tasted. Seems more restrained then most bug Belgians which is nice."
"This is a great beer. A quadrupel that I can drink all night (I wish I had enough to do that). I had this at a tasting with Westy 8 as well and I found it interesting that this was less boozy than that. Is this worthy of the title of ""best beer in the world""? That's for you to decide. But I'll doubt you'll call it anything but a great beer regardless."
"D: Very. This thing is 10.2 ABV so be careful."
"D: The million-dollar question: is this the best beer on Earth? First off, I should note that my bottle was pretty young and still had some heat on it. I think it would improve with age. Anyway, this was an excellent beer, and I feel privileged for having had a chance to drink it. Whether it's the best is, of course, subjective, but I'd definitely put it in the conversation. However, Rochefort 10 did just a little bit more for me. Honestly, though, all the elite Trappist beers are superlative in their own way."
"I am not discounting how good this beer was, especially in the face of so many horrible CANQuest (TM) beers, but neither did I hear the singing of angels or have any sort of religious experience."
"Price alone hurts the score here. I could drink this all day...slowly, but all day."
"Now, obviously, I can't answer the question about whether this is the best beer in the world. That's a completely subjective question. I can do a little better by comparing it to other quads. I would need to taste them side-by-side a few times to really make up my mind, but my first instinct is that I like St. Bernardus Abt 12 a tiny bit better. But if you're a Belgian beer fan, or any sort of beer fan at all really, Westy 12 is worth at least some of the hype and is an absolute must-try."
"Edit: Upped the overall a bit, as I take into account the beer experience. One part of that for me is availability, and this one seems to have become increasingly more available."
"Wish I could rate this a 5 but I can't. If it was easy to find, cheaper and a little lower ABV, I'd rate this a 5. Even with the high ABV, the booze is hidden really well. It is still there in the nose and taste, but not as strong as I thought. I will definitely be going out of my way to try and grab more of these. Definitely an A+ beer that lives up to the hype!"
"Medium to full bodied and perfectly carbonated. I can taste some of the alcohol, but there is no alcohol burn at all. The alcohol is definitely warming though. This is also a smooth and creamy beer. Drinking beer does not get any better than this. The drinkability is off the charts, and I must seek this out again."
"D - an insanely well crafted beer here, the fact they can pull off flavors like this without any flashy ingredients is just mind boggling. just cant begin to describe how complex yet delicately constructed this one is. a real treat, and worthy of its own special occasion. cheers to the monks of St. Sixtus for this one."
"Sweet roasted malts, fruits flavours , and the great Belgian yeast feeling."
"Medium body with lots of light bubbled carbonation that sweeps gently across your tongue. A drinkable and inviting beer, but flavor wise isn't as impressive as I had hoped."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black with a light, quickly dissipating head. For such a highly touted beer, I was surprised how the taste was very subtle. The appearance makes you think that's it's really full, but that's not the case. I was initially disappointed in the flavors but grew to appreciate it as I drank more. I noticed the chocolate and light roasted grain flavor at the outset. The real strength of this beer for me was on the back end."
"Epic thanks to beerwolf77 for sharing"
"This is great, beyond question. It is the best beer I have had so far, but I think that there are a very very small percentage of better beers out there. But for now, long live the king!"
"D - Taste is magnificent, ABV be damned I could drink this all night."
"There are so many magical fables that we can't reach out and touch. If, as a child - you ever longed for Brigadoon, Narnia, Middle Earth or Neverland to be real - go through the motions and acquire a bottle of this beer. It's worth the trouble to reaffirm your sense of humility and wonder in the world."
"Great way to spend a lunch break. I don't think this is the best beer I've ever had, but I am very appreciative of the rare opportunity to try it. Here's to the last sip."
"Overall this is one amazing quad, but Rochefort 10 does compare favorably as do a few other quads and Belgian strong darks. It earns its reputation as the ""Holy Grail of Beer"" by the means needed to get a taste of it but once it has been tasted your efforts could be better used for more reasonable endeavors. I am so happy to have had it though and now need to decide when and where to open the second bottle."
"And now my glass is empty. Sigh."
"D: Simply incredible, something I could drink on a regular basis, if I had the access to it. Warms you up and doesn't disappoint."
"Overall: Delicious beer, a little bit alcoholic but for a 10% it's very bearable. Multi layered. Excellent."
"Glad I finally got to try this. Very good, great even... but I think the other Trappist Quads are comparable. Looking forward to seeing how other bottles age."
"Really enjoyed this one cant wait to get the next."
"We were gifted a bottle of 12 from a long time Dutch friend. We wonder if the beer had undergone temp changes because it did not have a lot of carbonation...but this was truly the best we have ever had. It is a dom of the beer world. It has a smooth, sweet flavor with a nice smell!"
"O: I think I bought a defective bottle. Very disappointing. I'm sure that this one can perform better, but I'll need to come back and revise when I get a chance to sample the beer again. Hopefully for Christmas."
"D: Alcohol level almost undetectable. Evident in the taste somewhat but not in the drinkability. The experience goes way too fast"
"Appearance is dark brown/chestnust in color with a creamy tan head. Complex aromas of dark fruits, followed by Belgian yeast spice notes and dark fruity malts. Tastses as it smells with and amazingly smooth and well rounded flavor profile. A sacred brew worthy of sacred appreciation. Full body with medium+ carbonation and semi creamy mouthfeel. Surprisingly drinkable at 10% abv. I personally enjoyed the Westy 8 better than the 12, but I am curious to try both again and take some detailed notes."
"Beautiful balance. The fruit flavors are nearly perfect. It does have a slight alcohol tinge near the end."
"2003 vintage. I've been lucky enough to try this several times but this is actually the first time I've ever had one in my possession. They always get cracked at tastings but its never found its way into my possession. My willpower lasted about 2 months before I i was forced to crack it open. The beer pours a muddy brown with just a bit of a head that leaves no lacing. Actually the heads kind of ugly. Big fish eye bubbles. No lacing. The aroma is chocolate and dark fruits. Sweet maraschino cherries with toffee. A hint of booze. Nails. The flavor is fairly similar. Pure coco powder up front with date and fig. Big sweet cherries with dark fruits. Caramel and toffee with just a hint of toast. Just a bit of sweet molasses. The mouthfeel is honestly the worst part of the beer. It honestly a bit thin. I don't know if its the prolonged aging that has thinned out the body but its not quite what I remember. Overall, this beer is fantastic. There's really not much more then that."
"A big thanks again to Thijs for the hookup. Saving my other bottle to do a quad comparison tasting."
"Had it again two days later, side by side with Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, Rochefort 8, Chimay Blue, Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw, and Trois Pistoles. Although I am rating Westvleteren 12 higher than Rochefort 10, it's only because of better looks and absence of alcohol in aroma; these two, although very different, are just as good as each other in my opinion. My taste preferences lean more towards Rochefort 10, which is a good thing because that's way easier to come by."
" Body is silky smooth, well-carbonated but not bubbly, full and creamy but not overly thick. A warming dose of booze comes through on the swallow, accentuating the complexity of the beer. On the whole, this is just a masterpiece. I wish it were easier to obtain, but I understand and appreciate why it is not."
"CHEERS!"
"Drinkability:It's a really easily drinkable, flavorful, complex, and smooth beer."
"a very good beer, but seems to me that rarity and hype have pushed this one to extreme heights. still have several other bottles, so will try again, and revise scores if my opinion changes."
"D , very smooth and creamy , nicely balanced , good carbonation, i could drink this al day long , alcohol is very well hidden"
"NB - I would like to revisit this beer again when I can be sure that I am not tasting a compromised sampling. Enjoyable despite that, though."
"It drinks very smoothly and very well. It's not sticky at all either, and no off flavors. I could easily pound this like it's water, if it didn't taste so good. Again the only thing that hurts it a bit is the lack of carbonation."
"The body is full and creamy without being too heavy or overwhelming. It works nicely with the carbonation and the flavors to create a sublime drinking experience. While I am not completely blown away, this is still a phenomenal beer. I do wish it was easier to obtain, as this is a top-notch BSDA/'quad' that certainly sets the bar high for the style."
"d - There's a reason it's #1 of BA; it's pretty amazing. While it isn't the #1 beer on my list, it's safe to say it's high on my list. The good news is that the taste and smell are the highlights of this beer. Both are complex and enjoyable. While the high carbonation hurt the mouthfeel a bit, the smell and taste are amazing. It also definitely helps to let this one warm up a bit, so you can fully appreciate everything in the nose and mouth. If you like quads, I think it is safe to say you'll love this beer. I was also surprised how easy it was to drink and how little alcohol was noticable in the taste. I think I like this slightly better than Westy 8, but it's close. I look forward to aging my other 2 bottles and see how they do with even more time on them."
"Mouthfeel: Wonderful. If I had more bottles they'd be gone. But then I'd be on the floor because the 10.2% abv can be felt but not tasted."
"this is good, cus i love grape juice. but really, this is a bit overrated. i highly preferred the westy 8 to this. i would love to try this fresh. at 12 years old, terrible. at 2 years old, good, whats fresh like?"
"This could become a perfect 5, if it balances even more with age and if the aroma's would be a bit more pronounced... but proud to be Belgian!"
"D: Likely the most drinkable 10.2% beer in the world. This one really earns its accolades. Incredible balance and complexity with a mouthfeel that really pulls it all together. Nose is impeccable and even looks great. Definitely one to try and seek out and very much worthy of the praise."
"Found this in a small bar in Brussels. For 10 Euro I was pumped just to have one. Anyhow they had two and I cannot believe I found this there. It was deliciou. Even though not my favorite style it was truely delicious. I shared the other bottle with my buddy in Paris"
"Overall a very nice quad, but I didn't find it completely mindblowing. Worth trying for sure but more for the experience than the beer I think."
"This was an amazing beer. I am not worldly enough to say best beer or not, but it was an amazing beer and I feel fortunate to get to try one."
"Not AWESOME, but it was good. i wouldnt go out of my way to try it again, but am glad I did drink into the hype machine at least once, and have another in the cellar to age and review again. But as many have said, St. B 12 isn't that too far off if not better."
"Bottle. Date on the cap of 08.01.11, so bottled in 2008 I believe. Pours a hazed deep mahagony reddish brown color with a slighlty off white head. Some sediment evident in the glass. A solid mix of aromas in the nose including fruit like raisins, spice, and alcohol. Also get plums in the nose. Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation that dances across the tongue. Dark fruits and subtle sweetness dominate the flavor. Some evidence of the alcohol in the taste. Pretty smooth and exceptional tasting. Other flavors that I can pick out include molasses and caramel. Nice sweetness left in the mouth after your drink. So, how does the ""#1"" beer in the world rate? It's hard to imagine how any such beer can be #1 for me. This is a great, very smooth drinking, well made beer for sure. The fact that you can only get it from the monastery has to come into effect in where it is on the list. Overall, I really like this beer. Its really tasty but I couldn't drink it all the time. Give it up to the monks for making this one."
"Don't get me wrong, this was very delicious, but to me beer is graded by flavor, construction, and sensations. This beer just didn't peak where I had expected it to, and hence the problem with knowing the hype. I would still give the Westy very high grades, just not in the elite class. That being said, two of my friends satting at the table has each had a Westy 12 before, and they both claimed that this tasted different. So, will not make a conclusion on this beer until I have had another. And the hunt continues..."
"The beer is clear and has a amber brown color. The head is tan and very bubbly. There is a sweet, semi-dry fruit that makes up the aroma. It smells like some sort of berry, but not one that I can identify (if I knew what it was, I'd go out and buy a pint). The flavor is big but not overbearing. There is some toasted malt and noticeable alcohol. The malts are sweet but never too much so. They impart a hint of strawberries that is most enjoyable. After each swallow the warmth of the alcohol lingers on and keeps you company until you bring the glass back to your lips. It has a medium body and plenty of carbonation. Swishing it about my mouth, the beer foams up quite a bit. I could easily drink a lot of this, at least until the alcohol caught up with me. It doesn't feel or taste like a 10% ABV beer at all. This is truly a world class beer. Nearly everything about it sets the standard for which quads should be judged. As I said above, Westy 12 is worth all of the praise it gets (but I must agree that there are some beers easier to obtain that come close to its greatness, see St. Bernardus 12), and it deserves your attention."
"D: A very, very good beer. Maybe a bit too sweet to drink a lot of at a time, but such a good flavor that you might make a bit of an exception."
"D - OK - so it's very drinkable. I was super exited to try it. However, I think if it were easier to obtain, it might not hold the position of top beer in the world. Something to be said for having to call the monastery for an appt, hoping you get through, and then picking it up. A treat to try for sure!"
"Overall, this was a very good beer, but I hope maybe someday I will be able to obtain a bottle with some age on it to enjoy more pronounced flavors an aromas."
"Thanks to Don for bringing this one to an EPIC tasting! Poured into a generic tulip. Nice off white head. High retention. Soapy lacing. Aroma of caramel, brown sugar, molasses and raisins. Taste is perfect malt sweetness, no alcohol, warming and effing amazing. Flawless in every way, shape and form."
"Have had this many times with bottles dating back to the mid 1990's. This review comes from my first time having the beer with a bottle marked 28.03.10. It pours with a off-white head that goes with time and leaves some waves covering a murky brown body with particles. Alcohol legs on the side of the glass. Amazing aroma of figs, dark fruits, raisins, chocolate, alcohol, brandy and a slightly tart plum. Taste is sweet, lighter than expected with complex, rich and spiciness. There is a complex savory alcohol note on the finish that is beautiful along with a long, clean and pleasant after taste. Brandy, spicy, sweet, yeasty and fruit. There is so much in this beer. It is subtly amazing! Syrupy mouthfeel with really light bubbles. This beer quietly lives up to all expectations. Is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it sure is an excellent one."
"The beer appears deep burgundy tinged brown with a large frothy beige head. The aroma displays a complex and complimentary sherry-like oxidation quality. This aged iteration is reminiscent of a fine port, with notes of ripe plum and prominent cherries. It's somewhat nutty, with an effusion of caramel, dates, and prunes. The flavor is rich and malty with sherry oxidation and a touch of cardboard, just a touch. Notes of ripe cherries accompany dates, prunes, and a strong caramel profile. The beer is highly carbonated with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel and noticeable alcohol warming. A rare aged treat, thanks!"
"D: This is a beer that makes you want to raise your arms in joy. The best beer in the world? I'm not sure about that, but in my opinion; the best Trappist!"
"O - This beer does get a lot better with age. The port like flavours begin to emerge at three years old. I will review again in a couple of years time. This beer cannot be beaten. I know some people are dissapointed when they first tsate this beer because they are used to massive bourbon barrel aged stouts that are dominated by a particular flavour or two. This beer challenges the need for massive flavours by taking you on a journey of subtleness and balance. That for me is the pinnacle of brewing."
"A meal for the soul. A real treat. Thick rich complicated like a real frersh fortified sherry wine from Jerez de la Frontierea Spain. Come with a clean slate and come mentally prepared."
"D: The alcohol is nearly unoticeable at first, but comes out a bit as the beer warms. I could literally drink this every day and never get tired of it. It really is too bad that alas, I only have one bottle. This is the very definition of a world class beer. I will certainly be seeking out more of it."
"Opened the homebrewed version, makes me appreciate the real thing much more, the homebrew is actually less sweet but more oxidized, darker color and especially darker head. Loving the original."
"Overall just an amazing beer! Looking over my review, I realize I'm running out of adjectives to describe how great it is. Worthy of the accolades and praise. The most wonderful, special, and unique beer in the world. Period."
"Drinks: incredibly. While I want to really wait it out and savor it, the beer goes down so easily it's scary. The complexity brings something new and exciting to each sip. Twelve's renown is indeed deserved."
"Overall, Westvleteren 12 is worth it's praise, however I still hold Rochefort 10 as it's superior."
"MF/D: faint soothing sizzle of carbonation, fizzles to a smooth finish, foam coats the lips. certainly didn't want to drink anything but W12 afterwards."
"I think that I will age most or all of my remaining bottles. This is a great beer, no doubt, but I have had it when it's been better. I do have two 7-year-old bottles sitting at home, maybe I will try one of them soon and refresh my memory how it ages. Regardless, fresh or not, this beer truly is great."
"Drinking this beer is an experience to say the least, it almost transports you to some medieval monastery, where monks in tattered robes stand around wood-fired copper kettles, stirring and sampling with large wooden oars. Highly recommended, worth the time spent salivating, excellence. Thank you again to the BA who put this into my hands, thank you from the bottom of a well enjoyed glass."
"Coiuldn't have enjoyed it more!"
"O: To be a quad, I think this needed a little more oomph. Not as viscous as I would have thought a quad to resemble to style, but yet still delicious."
"""It's ok."""
"Picked up at the monastery and stamped 16.06.13. This beer pours dark brown with a little amber on the edges of the glass. It started with about an inch of head and reduced to about a quarter inch that stays with the beer throughout. The smell starts with the malt with a hint of something sweet and is followed by the yeast and something that can only be described as slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is that of some carbonation and a nice warmth. The alcohol is well masked. It seems slightly sticky like sugar. The taste follows the smell with a sweetness and slight fruit taste. I really enjoyed this beer and would be very happy drinking it everyday."
"D - Off the charts. This is as good as the best beer I have ever had."
"This really defied my expectations. What I anticipated was a big, bold flavor profile, this is all about finesse. So complex, but not a slap in the face -- there are a lot of subtle notes & movements, & none of them overpower the others. Well-balanced, silky smooth, & flavorful, this is a great beer."
"So easy to drink. Quite subtle, but greatly complex."
"*From notes taken on 6-28-10"
"Regardless, this thing was absolutely delicious - I could drink this all day."
"D: I can see what the hype is about. Westy 12 is near perfect. Extremely easy to drink. This may be the best beer of any style that I have ever had the opportunity to try."
"It's crazy how well this beer drinks. I am honored to have tried it and have to say it is every bit as good as anyone has ever said. Amazing, amazing, amazing. There will soon come a time where I will NEED to have this again."
"i had to stop for a bit to think about how exactly to rate this ones drinkability....i had no desire, at any point, to take more then a sip. i have been repeatedly pouring this into a 4oz sample snifter actually. nothing more is needed. a beer that can make 12oz fulfill such an amount of time and be so complex yet still be easy to drink, perfect. Bella."
"[My mother HATED the sip of this I let her have :-) ]"
"D-This is unquestionably the best beer I've ever had. Life throws so many overhyped things that never fit the bill. This fits the bill and then some. If I have the honor of drinking this again. I will."
"D: Really great for a quad at 10% ABV. I could drink this all night."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I'm going to be heading to my fridge for an encore."
"Well, to my surprise, everything made this rare beer exceptional. This beer was a great beer. Taste, color and quality made me an advocate of this trappist experience."
"A must try for anyone."
"The flavors keep coming back in interesting ways, and I do not grow to despise them. I welcome them like an oil lantern after my flashlight lost power."
"D - Delicious and everything that is expected of a beer of this caliber. ABV is high so its not a perfect 5."
"This is as close to a perfect beer as you can get!"
"Big thanks to billinlafayette for this one! Dated 08.09.11 on the cap. Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Pours a deep dark brown with an off-white two finger head with a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Maintains phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of fruit, bread, alcohol, and malt. The flavor is of malt, bananas, alcohol, biscuits, citrus, and bread. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is excellent in all aspects. The complexity of this one is truly INSANE. The appearance is awesome as well. This one sample makes me want to book a flight to Belgium and drink more... The hype is true."
"Pours a murky dark walnut in color with very little light coming through. The head is thick and bright white leaving some awesome lacing. The smell is a bit subtle for what i was expecting but the amount of scents fuzed into a singe whiff is astounding, dried fruits cinnamon yeast spices and a bunch of other things I cant even put my finger on. The taste is more complex then the smell but also subtle. Raisins the slightest citrus note cloves and a warm tasty booze dominates for me. The mouthfeel is not heavy at all but you know its there and the drinkability is through the roof. Not that anyone would want to but you could put a few of these down in a hurry if you had to. This is hands down the best Quad I have ever had, I don't know if it would be the all time best for my taste but I would never argue this being the holy grail."
"This beer is worth the hype and is a must have on any beer lover's Bucket List of fine beers. Thank you monks, you hath done well."
"I'd drink this every day, I liked the 10 a bit better, but my friends who I shared these with all liked this better, but we're talking 1 sub A, and 1 sub B here. Amazing for the style."
"I had this ""young"" with a 2013 ""best by"" date. 12-oz bottle poured into a chalice. Poured a ruddy-red tinged, dark brown. A moderately aggressive pour yielded a huge three-finger white head. It settled to 1/2' which lasted throughout. I sipped this beer and there was that fluffy head at the very last sip. The nose was coffee, caramel, plums, lemon, clove, and chocolate. The taste? My goodness...dark, sweet fruit (plums, grapes) with some chocolate at the start and some spices. Belgian (bready) yeasts were evident. The finish moved to dry and even a little bitter, providing a wonderful, complex and balanced evolution. Mouthfeel was thick without being syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high, but seemed to fit. It's hard not to gush but this is just an amazing beer. I wanted to find fault with it but could not. Nothing in this review does it justice because it is the subtleties that make it special, and most of them defy description. It is NOT over-rated. You MUST have this."
"d-i'm an atheist, but this was a religious experience. is it THE best beer on earth? maybe. is it the best Quad on earth? i certainly think so. once you climb everest, what's next?"
"Pours a little murky, medium brown with a lot of carb., off-white head. Smells are dark fruits, a lot of yeast, slight funk and a hint of booze, smells really great. Taste some dark fruits, figs, a lot of yeast, slight funk again, a touch of hops and grapeskin. Mouthfeel is perfect amount of carb., smooth, feels great. Drinkability is very good, I understand why everyone wants to try this beer. Is this the greatest beer I've ever had? No, but it is definitely a great one, and one I would love to drink again. Soon. Very soon."
"Conclusion: Was it the earth-shattering, worldview-changing epiphany I was awaiting? No. But I don't think a beer that's this hyped could *ever* meet expectations. That being said, it was by FAR the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale/Quadrupel I've ever had. I think if the bitterness had been just slightly less, this would have been an A+. Better than Chimay's Blue and Rochefort's 10 w/out question (though those are both delicious beers; I haven't tried Achel's Extra yet, so I can't comment on it). I would love (someday) to have 3-4 of these so I could drink 1 a year or so and see how they change. I broke this open to celebrate passing my MA defense that day; again, thanks to frissianwits, I cannot think of a better way to have celebrated."
"Can't say whether or not it's the best beer I've ever tried, but it certainly ranks in the top few."
"I'm really glad i got to try this. Thanks to a very generous BA."
"We picked up three cases of 12 at the St. Sixtus Abbey. The head stays until the last drop, even if it is an hour later. The taste is very complex and almost indescribable. Three of us shared one that I brought back to the states. Each of us had different impressions. It has hints of spice, sweetness, caramel, and very rich mouthfeel. Even my wife, who does not like any beers other than lambics and flanders red, really liked it a lot. I guess I should not have let her taste it. Less for me."
"This was a real treat to enjoy and review this unique beer. There is so much mystique behind this plain brown bottle with the gold cap. I can only imagine what it would have been to enjoy all three styles at Sint-Sixtus Abbey. I appreciate the generosity of our friends wanting to share this awesome beer with us. Thanks Zombob!"
"The one big knock I have against this beer is the alcohol presence. For as hyped as this beer is, I found it to be boozier than I was expecting (contrary to what many others have commented). This booziness would be more understandable if the flavors were more potent, but then again it seems that this beer is meant to tantalize the taste buds rather than punish them. I can only imagine that if I had been more patient and given the alcohol heat some more time in the ""cellar"" to calm, allowing the subtlety of the flavors to truly shine, I would have seen this beer as the world-class stuff it is known to be. As it stands, however, it is still a unique, complex, enjoyable beer that suffers a bit from its potency."
"I recently took a trip to Sint Sixtus Abbey and had a few of the Wesvleteren 12 at the cafe. Served in one of the nicest beer glasses of the trappist beers, the dark brown beer looks almost like coke. An average amount of head colored light brown sat on top of the beer but dwindled after a few sips. I do not know how long the beer at the cafe has been aged (or if at all). It has a most enjoyable complex taste. Fruity and sweeter initially fading to lightly sweet, deep caramel malt flavor bordering on a malt liquor type taste. Very smooth and finishing with a crispness that leaves the mouth just slightly dry dry. Truly excellent beer."
"D: Perfectly balanced flavors, perfect taste. A little heavy for top drinkability marks, but it is not a weak point of this beer."
"I agree with other reviewers that the alcohol is well-masked and I think that is the reason why this is the highest rated beer on the site. While I have occasionally struggled to get through a whole bottle of the similarly structured Rochefort 10, the Westvleteren 12 is a kinder, gentler quadrupel that I could see myself drinking all day long."
"Glad I got to try this one, being the top dog and all but it is definitely not my #1. Very good though and would not pass it up if I saw it, but I can easily get Abt. 12 and Rochfort 10 and think they are on par with this guy."
"My favorite of the 4."
"D- This beer is an amazing drinker. Although, I don't see the hype with the all 5's, I do feel the drinkability should be a 5. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer overall is very smooth. I would recommend this beer to everyone who hasn't tried it."
"D - Hard to believe it's over 10%, Rochefort has a much stronger alcohol taste. This is quite drinkable and sweet. While it may not be my favorite beer, I can understand why it would be the concensus #1 beer over all. A lot of universal appeal, and the mystique of the Westverleten monks helps I'm sure. However, is it blasphemous to say I like Rochefort 10 better?"
"Drinkability: Tastes and smells nice, but the lack of carbonation ruined it for me. I hope I got a bad bottle. Otherwise, I can't understand how this is ranked so high."
"Notes: Best before 24/03/13. Wonderful beer that lived up to the hype for me. Well balanced and complex. Really an enjoyable beer that I would gladly drink again. A touch lighter than what I was expecting, but it worked well. Very tasty beer, with all the hype I can see how it might fall short for a number of people, but all in all I think most people would gladly drink another."
"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!"
"D - Oh no!!! It is almost gone... This is the worst part by far... So good and so drinkable. I wish these monks were closer."
"d- i could drink this beer until i was blue in the face. my oh my, this is not my favorite beer ever, but probably the best beer i have ever had. lived up to the hype for sure"
"D - Impeccable. Fanf***ingtastic. No alcohol detected in the finish, but a very distant warmth returns. 5.0"
"A beer that lives up to the hype. The only drwaback was drinking it so young; I would imagine that having this with 6-18 more months of age on it would make it heavenly. As it is, the heat of the alcohol is the only flaw."
"Overall, always happy to try Westy 12 - now I know to age it a little."
"Overall, with an unrivaled coherence, great mouthfeel, and a taste unlike any other Belgian ales I've tried (and I've tried quite a few) Westvleteren 12 is in a class all its own and is one of my favorite beers. In fact, the 8 may be the only other beer that really comes close."
"D: Again, the alcohol content isn't shy about showing itself, and the punchiness is considerable. But still, this beer is utterly fantastic, and one I will return to again and again as long as I have the money and opportunity. Worth the trip to Belgium."
"(D)- I can definitely see how this has received such high reviews, but does it deserve the No.1 spot? I am not sure. What I am sure of though is that this is a perfect example of the style and yet adds another level of richness into the mix. An absolute joy to drink; it only got better and better after each sip. No matter what position this is in, its just plainly one of the finest belgains I have had the pleasure of consuming."
"I was hoping that I would prefer the St. Bernardus or the Rochefort 10; I was hoping this beer was all about the hype. My hopes were dashed, if this beer was as available as the other two mentioned it would still be number one. It deserves its reputation and rating."
"All in all, this one was definitely not as good as expected. Very good, but not amazing. I'd say top 10 for me, but not #1. You definitely gotta try this one at least once if you're beer geek!"
"I am extremely excited to finally get an opportunity to try this beer after hearing so much about it. Pours a beautiful dark brown color, with a nice, fairly quickly dissipating beige-colored head. Aromas of candied fruits, dark brown sugar, caramel, Belgian yeast and sherry. Flavors of freshly baked brown bread, stewed plums, toffee and port wine. An exceptionally complex beer, and one that definitely lives up to its reputation. Is it the best beer in the world? No, but it's certainly in the conversation."
"Outstandingly drinkable for a 10.2%er. I could drink it all day and all night and never tire. I might get very drunk, but i would never ever get tired of this master piece of a brew."
"Drinkability isn't even worth discussing. I could drink this beer every day and never tire of it. While high in the ABV department, you'd never know by the taste."
"Stil a masterpiece. I have about 6 bottles of the gold still remaining. Another one won't come out until X-mas eve but I am looking forward to a couple of blondes (who isn't) this summer."
"This is indeed the best beer I ever had, and I had many, Quads, triples, doubles, stouts, ales, lambics, witbiers gotta go now hit the phone see if I can order a crate of Westys..."
"The monks don't think about us while making the beer, nor do we think about them while having it, but we miss them when we think about the Westvleteren. Worth the trouble and hype. Worth review No 100."
"Finally. Got it for a college friend's graduation from law school. Pours a deep amber brown with a generous caramel colored head. Has an aroma of dark fruit, caramel and malts. Some breadiness. The taste was worth the wait. This beer is not overrated. Sweet up front, then dark fruit taste. Chocolate notes show up. The carbonation hits at the perfect spot. Nice dry clean bitter finish with a subtle tart aftertaste."
"This beer was absolutely incredible. I've been drinking St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10 to prepare myself to try it. Then this puppy blew them out of the water. Unbelievable, the difference. More fruity taste, and a delicious warmth. Not as boozy as other quads I tried, and I can easily say if this ever comes across my path again, I won't be trading it away."
"Taste followed the smell, got plenty of raisiny fruit and a yeasty sweetness. Definitely no misgivings about it being a belgian quad. The combination of creamy, cask-like texture and the powerful sweetness is not my preference but I'm enjoying this beer. Belgians are not my favorite beers, this was my 4th quad (seems appropriate) and I found this to be the most interesting one I've had. Also less drinkable than others due to the sweetness and thickness."
"Overall its good but definitely not as good as the 8. Being as how I lucked upon this and might never get another, I think the St Bernardus Abt 12 will do just fine as its equal."
"Split a 2005 vintage with Brad. Rain water, earth, malt, yeast. Sublime. Hard to find any fault with this."
"Best beer ever? What does that even mean...? Anyways it certainly was great, and definitely one of the best Belgian beers I have had yet."
"M/D - Medium bodied brew, so ever so smooth. A brew that lived up to its name for sure a must try for anyone who can get their hands on one. I hope to have a chance to have another someday but if not I am for sure glad at least one!!!!"
"Lucky enough to try this from a friend who picked it up from the abbey in Belgium in 2008. Poured deep red with thick white head, great lace and retention, something very appealing about it. Smell was intense, sweet cherries, raisins, caramel and malt, alcohol in the nose too. Taste was equally intense, incredibly smooth and complex, sweet and bitter fruit and bready malt followed by spice and alcohol warming, yeasty with some more spice and alcohol bite in the finish. Incredible balance and complexity."
"I cannot even begin to describe the end of the Westvleteren. It sits there...waiting...."
"Notes: did a mini tasting with rochefort 10 and st bernardus 12 and the westy just to see which was the best... hoping it wasnt the westy so i wouldnt have to seek out another bottle.. and the westy won hands down. for sure the best tasting quad ive had"
"Without a doubt, a very skillfully crafted beer and completely different from what I was expecting."
"D: I was very afraid that this beer will be overrated and nothing exceptional, but I was wrong. I must agree it is really exceptional. The high price and unavailability makes me kind of sad but makes me also think about becoming a monk myself, on the other hand :)"
"Must try!"
"Needless to say, being the #1 rated beer on BA, I had extremely high hopes for this one. It didn't necessarily disappoint, but was perhaps less stellar than I expected, especially after having tried 8 a few months ago, which I found to have an unbelievable crisp, butteriness to both the taste and mouthfeel."
"A+"
"I prepped myself for this and had time to myself, at home, chilling by my open window as the spring breeze blew by. I took my bottle and opened it up gently. As I Gently poured out this brew, I noticed the gracefulness of its body as it filled my glass. Golden color with a hint of reddish rust color. As I finished pouring it in, I also see that the head is little but awake. So, at this point, I usually let it get 10 minutes of warming up at room temp, but i cheated and took a drink right away! How refreshing can a beer get, you ask? Lets just say that i could drink this year round..everyday!! The aroma was mild but every sense of flowery, parfume and almost like a cologne of a sense. Taste of the hops and the yeast are well balanced. Clean and smooth to the palate. It could be drank day in and say out because of the balance. nothing is dominant here.. just great craftsmanship."
"O: For the highest rated beer on BA, I was very disappointed. It is a good quad but when I can go to the corner-store and buy a Rochefort 10 or a St. Bernardus Abt 12 (both of which I think are better than this) for much, much cheaper, it makes this obsolete. Very glad to have tried this, but this is a 'one and done' given the logistics of obtaining more."
"D: My 300th review on my Birthday, and the #1 rated beer in the world. Awesome. I would definitely love to get this baby again, but the cost is considerable. For what the 'real' price is (vs. what I actually paid for it) this beer is unbelievable. Rich, beautiful, and complex. I know why you are on the top."
"I loved Westvleteren 8 but I was unimpressed with the 12. This beer had no real qualities that distinguished it from its counterparts. In fact, many of its characteristics seemed rather ordinary. I definitely planning on sampling another bottle in the near future to see if my opinion should change."
"Taken on its own, or consumed as a dessert, this is simply heavenly. I can certainly taste the similarities to other, more easily obtainable beers of the style, but Westvleteren 12 somehow stands apart. Whether it's because it's truly that outstanding, or because the hype machine has a grip on my soul remains to be seen. Regardless, this is definitely a beer everyone should try."
"While not my favorite style of beer, it's easy to see why it is on top of the Best of BA. It's a very enjoyable beer and one that certainly lives up to its reputation. I was not disappointed at all by this beer and will drink it again some day."
"D: The drinkability is great. Having never tried this brew before, I was expecting a big, sweet mess. I was so wrong. This beer is smooth, crisp and delicious. It just makes me wish I could enjoy it more often."
"Well this was right out of the box into my glass, mailroom temperature... both Jeff and I noted a distinct apple cider aroma... it was uncanny. Really just dark, unfiltered, unpasteurized, spiced apple cider. Along for the ride, some pumpernickel bread, caramelized brown sugar, barely a hint of oxidation, but it is very well integrated. Raisins, pears and some brandy. One of the things that is so impressive about this beer, is that it's 10.2%... it's not 'light' tasting, but still just feels so pleasant on the palate. It's not as 'dark' as previous times that I have had it (or as I remember)... a little less of a dark fruit presence than some other bottles I have been a part of. Low-medium but well-executed carbonation perfectly accentuates the delicate and more subtle flavors of this beer. It's just a masterfully concocted beverage and one that I hope to be able to enjoy for years to come. This review is for the 2005 bottle, but numerically reflects what this beer is fresh, and what it can be with a little time on it."
"The mouthfeel is the most impressive part of this beer. It's smooth and rich yet surprisingly light on the palate. The carbonation is a little lower than I'm used to, but is still adequate. The drinkability also shocked me. Compared to others in the style, there is no comparison. Other Quads are slow sippers and hard to finish, but this one begged me to drink more than half a bottle. I don't think I've had a beer this big and flavor that was so easy drinking."
"I wish I had several cases of this, I swear it would turn peoples notion about beer. Truly exceptional, to be brewed only by the divine. I can't wait to open up the other bottles further down the road."
"Drinkability: Easily is the best Quad I've ever had. I could have easily had more than one of these. Unfortunately I only have one bottle left and I'm going to save that for a spell. If it was more readily available, I would drink this every day. As far as I'm concerned, it lives up to the hype. It is ""World Class"" as stated on it's page. And I cannot say that I would argue against billing it ""Best Beer in the World""."
"M/D: smooth and perfect, lives up to the hype."
"D - This is the most sessionable high alcohol beer I've ever had. The legendary Westy 12 absolutely lived up to the hype. Such a special beer, truly a work of art. I could drink this every day."
"Palpable aromas of strongly fortified, port-like wine, intense sugary sweetness, plums, dried fruits represented by prunes, sour cherries , figs and rum soaked raisins. Clear presence of alcohol which is well incorporated into the whole. Each aroma listed reincarnates itself in the flavor department that perfectly matches the nose.The mouthfeel of warming and liqueurish brew is syrupy but not in a sickly manner, with zero carbonation. I'm pouring the beer carefully to keep the black slush at the bottom. Even so the last pour is hazy due to the raised yeasty sediment which adds some spiciness and in contrary with beliefs does not ruin the beer. Fully mature Westvleteren 12 is great, although does not have much in common with what I see as a beer. 2.5 5 5 5 5 = 4.5"
"I would like to say more about this beer and feel as though it just deserves more but I just really dont even know what to say."
"I don't really need to say much more. This stuff is amazing. Worth every dime. I think anyone who enjoys beer should give this a try at least once as it is a little pricey but damn it is well worth it."
"Best quad I've ever had? Yes, I would definitely say so. I've never tasted anything so complex. Best beer in the world? That's a bit more debatable, but it very well could be."
"Worth the trouble to obtain, better than the hype. Best Quad ever? Yes. Best beer ever? I'd have a hard time arguing with you."
"drinkability - surprisingly drinkable and smooth"
"Finally got to try this thanks to DJ Breezy. The most notable things for me were the sugary, sour apply jolly rancher part of the nose and flavor profile, the complexity that gave new flavors with each sip (dark fruits, apple, pear), and a level of smoothness that is unmatched. Exceptionally complex and smooth."
"Unique smell, unique flavor. Earthy notes,taste of grape tannin but without winy flavor. Alcohol subtily hidden and very nice body well balanced. It is like drinking honey. So unctuous, so rustic. Maybe not the world best beer but still a wonderful one. Fabulous"
"Drinkability: Yeah, if I could buy this locally, I would never drink any other beer as long as I live. Well worth the effort locating some bottles, would do it again and again."
"Drinkability, if you ignore the extreme difficulty in getting this beer, is fantastic. The alcohol sneaks into your head eventually but otherwise, I could drink this all day. Worth saving and my only regret is that I only had 1 bottle. A world-class brew!"
"This is my favorite style and I think it stands shoulder to shoulder with Rochefort 10 as the best Quad brewed today."
"Big thanks to Jason for this one. Pours brown with a little slightly off-white head. Nothing too special to look at. Flavor and aroma are lots of dark fruits, with brown sugar and a lot of sweetness. Obviously this beer is well-regarded, as it should be, but to me it's just not the best beer I've had. Glad to have tried it though, and truly a unique experience. If I could get this regularly for a reasonable price, I surely would."
"D: The drinkability is really good, this beer is just super complex and full bodied. I could drink this for days."
"Pours a dark ruby with a rocky head. Aromas of candied sugar and cloves, with some raisins, dates, grapes, and currants. The burnt banana peel often attributed to it is apt. Taste is more caramelized sweetness, dark fruit, and a deep, rounded clove finish. This beer gets more flavor and complexity out of the yeast than probably any other in the world (lambics excepted). A velvety body adds wonderfully to the experience. Worth the hype and a true delight."
"taste is extraordinary and probably has the best mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had. It is scary how easy this one is to drink...at 10.2% abv, it hides it very well! I have tried this beer on 3 different occasions and it remains to be one of my favorites!"
"Great texture. Tingly and soft at the same time. Absolutely no hint of the ABV. Such an easy drinking quad, too. Clearly the best."
"D - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but it's a superb one nonetheless. It's shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too. There's been a lot written about this beer, and I'm not sure there's much I can add - it's excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim that has been heaped upon it."
"The flavors in this beer are extremely complex yet unified. I don't know if this is really the best beer in the world, but it is certainly one of the greats."
"Thanks to Brabander, who sent some bottles of this and thanks to my roommate, wahmaster, for allowing me to have one."
"I have had better beers (that night even)."
"D- I have never been happier knowing that my father in law travels to Belgium on a regular basis. I want to drink this everyday. I will def revisit this masterpiece as often as I can."
"Lucky enough to get a hold of one of these from a very generous trader. Would this live up to the hype? The answer is yes. This is the best Belgian beer I have had, hands down. This handles all the complex quad flavors so well it's ridiculous. It is actually hard to pick out individual flavors. I found myself saying ""wow..."" at just about every sip. This is a complex, rich, fruity, malty, awesome beer. The mouthfeel is so smooth, and goes down so easy. If I could get this everyday, I could easily put down a few at once. I kind of feel like I'm fueling the hype train, but it deserves it. Drank this after a Roch 10 and before a Bernardus 12, and it was head and shoulders above those two."
"Westvleteren 12 is a Quadruple style Belgian ale. Pouring a beautiful rich dark caramel color with a thick frothy head it's armoa is a mix between a bakery and a ripe orchard. It tastes of fresh baked wheat bread, honey coated cinnamon, sweet cloves, sticky molasses, and ripe figs. At 10.20% ABV it is a forced to be reckoned with and demands patience and respect."
"D: I could drink many. The alcohol is well hidden - a true delight!"
"Bottle courtesy of Harpreet..Pours mahogany, semi-cloudy, with a medium tan head that leaves only a little bit behind. Awesome aroma of dark fruits (plum, date, raisin, fig), caramel, malts, spices, and faint alcohol. The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol. Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%. It's hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isn't the most beautiful shade of mahogany. But those are just tiny observations that mean virtually nothing compared to this beer as a whole. I never thought this could live up to the hype, but it absolutely satisfied all expectations. I can't wait to visit the place someday and try some there."
"D and overall impression: I could drink this all night, it really doesn't get any better. Overall this is one of the best brews I have ever had. Simply amazing! Skal."
"Probably one of the best beers in the world, regardless of the hype. Fantastic, and very unique, flavor. Too bad I don't have more... :'("
"My buddy brought out one aged 5 years and one that had aged 10 years and you could simply experience the difference. The 10 year bottle was pure perfection. As you experience the incredible amount of flavor and the yeasty punch after the first sip, you are immediately feel this balancing sensation on the back of your tongue. Quite unexplainable. Simply delicious."
"d- smooth and delicious, lives up to the hype for me!! IMO not the best beer in the world, but damn near close. looking forward to getting my own bottle very soon and not sharing!!"
"Drinkability: A truly world-class brew. I'm deeply grateful to brabander for the opportunity to try this one. If you can get your hands on it, try it!!"
"D - Very drinkable beer, especially for a quad. I typically find quads to be a bit rough and very much a sipper of a beer. Not this one...flavors are strong but balanced...nothing hot about this from an alcohol standpoint. Very drinkable...excellent."
"This beer is very drinkable. The ABV actually makes it a bit dangerous but yum in every respect. Again, much thanks for the beer and I hope many people continue to enjoy."
"*= ideas from fellow taster"
"So, is it the end all be all? The ratings don't lie: This is an amazing beverage. I think the rarity and mystique probably add to the experience, but believe the hype: This beer deserves the acclaim."
"A good beer, like a good wine, must exist in time. This is to say, it must be good at the moment you have it, but also good in the scheme of beers as a whole such that as new styles and techniques evolve it remains well regarded and enjoyable. The fact that this one has acquired a nickname (Westy) is a testament to this. Out of a bottle provided by BA members (THANK YOU!) this legend was a deep, copper color with burgundy highlights. It was visibly viscous, leaving good streaks of lacing off the well-retained head. The aroma was complex and demanding; a sensual blend of ripe plums, dates and dark fruits galore. Behind that was alcohol (esp. dark rum), chocolate, spices and the pungent twist of Belgian yeast. The flavors were just as big and layered. Chocolate, more dark fruits, coffee hints, raisins, wood, cinnamon, figs etc. etc. The doughy notes were hard to discern under the other heavier elements but the impact was like an alcohol soaked fruitcake. Despite the depth of the beer it was indeed a brew with finesse and a good finish. Easy to drink? No. It's rich and intense. Pleasant to drink? Yes, especially if you love beer. A casual drinker could be run over by this thing. The mouthfeel was good and creamy but not amazing, the body full without being heavy and the carbonation right on. Relatively drinkable for all that is has to offer and a genuine joy for the advanced palate. In short, this delivered on every level including living up to its reputation and if you can find it, do so."
"EDIT: the more and more I drink this, the more I realize how ridiculous the mouthfeel is. Truly a thing of beauty."
"D- It's definitely a sit down and talk beer, but I could definitely drink several. It's one of those that are so good you just want to sip on to make it last."
"taste, perfection. you can hardly taste the alcohol behind the rush of flavors, fruits (raisins, figs) slight gingerbread taste, sweet caramel. but not overpoweringly sweet, just enough"
"God I love Christmas. Rated side by side blind with Dieu du ciel Rigor Mortis and St. Bernardus Abt 12. Very spicy, nutty aroma with some fruitiness. Very rich nutty taste, lots of booze and tropical fruits. Full, creamy, A+ mouthfeel. A beautiful beer but a little young."
"It took me an hour to properly savour this brew as the complexity is nearly unparalleled. Like most BAs, I prefer a handful of beers over Westy 12, but it's still a beast that needs to be tamed at some point in your craft beer journey. I feel extremely fortunate to have tried this legendary quad. A tasty and luxurious treat, deserving of its world class status."
"Not sure if this is the best beer in the world, but there are certainly no flaws. Thanks again to thirdeye11."
"M&D - incredibly smooth and complex in both aroma and taste, this beer at least meets the hype, I'll leave ""excedes the hype"" to the individual. I wouldnt say this was the best beer i have ever had, but it was incredibly good, and worth the cost to try at least once"
"Forgive spelling/grammar - from my iPhone."
"Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. Near perfect, incredibly well balanced with many complex darkfruit flavors and some brown sugar and toffee flavors, it is sweetened nicely. I'm glad I have two. Alcohol is amazingly well hidden as well making for an all too easy to drink beer."
"Very drinkable."
"2005 vintage. This poured a hazy mahogany with moderate light tan head. It smelled like strong sweet brown sugar and caramel and creamy yeast, with some banana nut bread and milk chocolate and confectioners sugar and raisin. It tasted like toffee and brown sugar and raisin and banana nut bread, with creamy yeast and cocoa powder and chalky confectioners sugar. It was oily with smooth carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was amazingly sweet (malty) and complex. It really is one of the best Belgian ales ever. It had a delicious scent and taste, with great body. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink, but it definitely needs to be sipped to be fully savored. I'm curious how this tastes fresh, but I don't know when I'll ever find out. Regardless, this beer meets the hype. Fantastic."
"Pours a dark brown/red color, lots of carbonation, nice small creamy head which leaves pretty quick, lots of nice lacing throughout the drink in forms of islands in some spots. Scents are very complex, lots of stuff going on, but could detect plums, raisins, toffee. The taste is very very nice, I believe I've had nothing like this so far. Nice tart/tangy/sweet flavor. Could taste plums/grapes I think. The finish is dry and clean. Medium body, well rounded, with a carbonated feel. Very drinkable. This is my first Westy, and what a powerful/excellent/awesome brew. Just might have to try and get some soon."
"D - Yes this is a great Quad to say the least, but is it THE best beer in the world? Well, perhaps not in my humble opinion, but still this is an excellent Quad."
"I try not to buy into the hype but I honestly think it somewhat sways my senses. I honestly can't be sure if it made me more critical or more flexible but what I am sure of is that this is a very good beer. It's not my favorite and not as good as Rochefort 10 but it is up there. What it's not, is worth the hype. I wouldn't pass up another one but I would not actively search it out again. There are far better beers that are readily available here in the States."
"Drinkability is also unheard-of. To be blessed with great friends, great beers, and great memories is what life is about. This is a beer to celebrate the best of all life has to offer!"
"This is an awesome brew. Lots of candi sugar and not heavy on the annoying clove corriander like some Belgians. Highly and dangerously drinkable.A true find worth searching out for those who have yet to try it..Best in the world? But worth seeking for sure..I must admit though this is a must try! Cheers"
"Overall, is it worth it? I would have to say sort of. Is it good? Yes. I really like this quad because it isn't so boozy as compared to a lot of the other quads I have had. It is worth a try. A lot of nice flavors in this beer. A bit slow drinking, however."
"An excellent, exceptional beer. It may not be the best beer I've ever had, but I certainly understand why so many believe that it is. I may prefer the Abt 12, but this is about as good as it gets."
"D: This beer is pretty rather divine and I am almost tempted to try and fetch another few bottles. I almost did not want to like this beer going into it because of its scarcity and it always seems like a faux pas to give into ""the best"". A complex aroma and a smooth/mellow flavor (appropriating this to the age of the beer) made for a great experience."
"Incidentally, when you pour this, make sure none of the sediment gets through. Once I'd finished my glass, I went back and poured the last inch or so through a paper kitchen towel, hoping to filter out the sediment and get another few sips. I failed and ended up with a very hazy last inch. It didn't taste the same: drinkable, but the complexity was gone. Other beers (St. Austell Clouded Yellow, for example) seem quite tolerant to this, but not the Westy. Remember: store upright for eight days and leave the black sludge in the bottle!"
"Taste is very crisp and sweet and it's got some complex grain/earthy flavors. Light belgian yeastiness to it with raisins dominating the flavor. The '95 as much more mellow and drinkable/smooth but the '09 was very bright and sharp, both were excellent!"
"Overall this is a great quad, and a great beer in general."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, warming, and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium to medium full. This beer is fantastic, it has so much going on in it, yet it is so simple. The flavor explode in your mouth and is very easy to drink. The head was disappointing, nonetheless, the flavor makes up for it. I am so glad that I got to try it. It is just amazing."
"D - Obviously a sipper but goes down really well. So complex in the flavors and develops nicely as it warms to room temperature. The alcohol is noticable in the spicey flavor it gives but does not come across boozy, so I think I could easily do two of these. A pleasure to drink and I really would like to have this again and would love to cellar a few as well to see what age will do."
"Overall- very good. great tart taste. complex, great sipper. not the best quad I have had though."
"D: Definitely worth the hype behind it. I dont know if I could drink this everyday, but it is worth it"
"Overall not quite the mind blowing experiance I had envisioned for the number one beer. A good beer that I would love to revisit. I'm glad I was able to share this with a friend for our birthdays."
"Another huge thanks to Todd for sharing this with me for our shared birthday!"
"Got to try this again thanks to Jeffo. Very solid quad. It tasted a little hot at first, but it settled and became very drinkable. Lots of brown sugar and dark fruits in the flavour."
"Drinkability, what can I say? Very, very drinkable. Probably the most drinkable ale at this ABV that I have had. It compares very favorably overall to other Belgians that I've had, though I still need to try a couple of the classics. I just had a nice Maredsous 8 on draft at the Renaissance fair here in Texas and it was lovely but it didn't have the depth of character that this Westvleteren exhibited. This ale is a classic for sure. I don't know if it's the best in the world, but it's certainly in my top few beers I've tried."
"Drinkability: If this is the holy grail its one and done for me. I hope that I have been duped and I bought one of those counterfeit beers. I have one more in the cellar (my closet). Will edit my review if this was just a bad bottle."
"One of those few beers that lives up to its hype and delivers, certainly does not disappoint, I now know the exemplar to hold all other quads up to. Wow.... Once again thanks to Goldorak, how am I gonna follow this one up?"
"I wish Westy 12 came in a 750ml, so tasty and easy to drink, it's gone before you know it. Don't pass up an oppertunity to try Westvleteren 12 atleast once in your lifetime!"
"Drinkability: I kept pulling it back and was saddened when it was gone. I have to say, when I had Bernardus 12 on tap a few times on tap, I really loved it, and this beer was everything it was and just a hint more. I don't know if I had them both aged to the same point what they would look like in comparison, but both are worthy and amazing beers. Worth its' post in the pantheon of great beers, this is for certain, and like everyone always says, I just wish I could grab this more regularly for a special occasion."
"Massively complex flavor. Brown sugar, fig, and plum sweetness. Alcohol is well hidden, but catches up with you in the end. Very creamy mouth feel; this beer completely coats your mouth and stays sticky throughout."
"Notes - This beer grew on me. My first impression wasn't wow but this beer's complexity takes time to appreciate. I still have five more so hopefully a little age will lower the amount of heat."
"D: A very nice beer. Is it the best in the world? Not in my opinion but still worth seeking out."
"A great beer all around."
"M/D - One of the creamiest, smoothest beers I have had. I think the mouthfeel may actually be my favorite part of this beer. Not the 'best beer on planet earth,' in my opinion, but absolutely worth tracking down."
"Deep brown color. Strong lacy tan head. Malty, nutty aroma. Full mouth. Complex malty, vinuous, nutty flavor with hints of dates, raisins and dark cherries. Amazing complexity grows with each year of storage. I've tasted brews aged up to 8 years, with amazing results. Also tasted in a Westvletern-flavoured ice cream, believe it or not, at the monastery tap. In a class of its own."
"OVERALL: A very tasty quad, no doubt, but the look wasn't all that spectacular and the feel definitely held it back some. A little too thin and airy, a thicker more robust palate would bring it over the hump and set it apart from the masses for sure. Unlike their dubbel, which is world-class to say the least, and despite the superb taste profile, this one doesn't quite live up to the hype. In the Quad Showdown, it's a toss-up between this and the St. Bernardus, while both are well behind the superior Rochefort 10."
"I drank all three of my bottles on my trip so I doubt that I will have another anytime in the near future. So I must ask the question; is this the best beer in the world? It was great. But I think that I like Rochefort 10 a little better."
"D: For its strength, quite good. The alcohol content is very very subtle. I would almost prefer that it be a bit more apparent, in fact. The aroma is lovely, but I wouldn't mind a bit more warming in the mouth."
"Overall: #1 in the world? In my opinion...no, but I can definitely see why this beer is enjoyed by so many people. I've had the pleasure of drinking this mighty fine brew and hope one day I can enjoy it again. Cheers!"
"Rich, full of taste sweetnes but not too much..."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, very good representation of style, as it is ranked #1 on BA at the time of this review and has been for some time, I was expecting something a bit more demonstrative from this beer, but the only things that stood out in this beer above other were its sweetness and its smoothness. While I don't consider it the absolute best beer on Earth, it is indeed very good."
"Now, the question is: when do I drink my two remaining bottles???"
"A large feat this beer accomplishes is integrating the alcohol so well into the fruit that it resembles wine in many ways. Is this why this beer is so world-renowned? Because it so tastes like wine? Additionally, the intense sweetness leaves me wondering as well. Other quadrupels or sweetened lambics leave beer geeks complaining over the sugar content, but still they are not as sweet as this beer. It is all quite perplexing. A very good beer this is, yes, but drinking it sheds a lot of light on the biases of the beer world. This beer took third place in my three-way side-by-side."
"This is a great beer, worldclass no doubt, but best on the planet, i think thats a stretch. The nose is amazing, as good as any i have smelled to this point However, the pallete is a bit less complex than suggested by the nose. Don't get me wrong, this beer is better than most, its mindblowingly good. I jsut find the alcohol to be a bit much, and the flavor profile to be a hair off. All in all a truely great beer though."
"It takes a while to drink this beer, but it is best to savor it. Each taste should be a mouthful that you spend at least five seconds before you swallow it to fully experience all this beer has to offer. If you have the chance to try it I fully recommend it."
" Nevertheless. I will still prefer drinking a great IPA on a regular basis.. on occasions I drink Belgium's... But if I had Wests 12 all the time, I may possibly drink them all the time... unfortunately they are hard to find.. I have two left... One for when I get married and the other when I become a father..."
"Decent drinkability, but I would find it infinitely more interesting if it were carbonated. I have one more bottle in my fridge and I really hope it's carbonated; if it is and it tastes a helluva lot better then I'll repost an edit on my review."
"D - This is the kind of beer that I would imagine a St. Bernard would carry to a frozen hiker, seriously, I was sweating after drinking this beer, but in all seriousness, good beer, everything that I imagined, not my favorite, but definitely in my top 10"
"After a bit of hesitation, I finally pop the cap. Pours a pure brown infused with a panoply of bubbles. A slight covering of tan head dissipates quickly, leaving a few dots of lace strewn about. The aroma is vinous with ripe grapes, grape juice, grain, beer bread and some candy sweetness underneath it all. As it warms the complexity grows, with notes of vinegar and phenols eventually opening up. Tastes bready, malty and fruity up front. The alcohol heat goes straight to the stomach and curls up into a warm fuzzy little ball. Subsequent drinks reveal some sweet chocolates and caramel as well as spice and grain. The medium to full-body goes down creamy, and I'm looking at the half-empty bottle, already wishing I had more of this goodness."
"D: Quite complex and takes a while to drink, and only gets better as it warms up. Very nice to savor for a long period of time while continuing to find new things going on."
"Glad I got to try such a fine beer. Sets a benchmark of what a Quad should be. Drink em if you got em."
"Mouth is overcarbonated at first but flattens out quickly. Slightly dry like it has been wood aged but I'm sure it hasn't. I can't even describe this one past a point. I could enjoy a bottle but I wouldn't dare waste another on a ruined palate."
"D-This is an amazing beer but I would never want it all the time. What I would like to do is get hold of a few of them or even be lucky enough to try one fresh."
"Overall: This is absolutely the best beer in the world. Fresh good, vintage simple the best. I can drink this one whole year. Perfect balance between sweet, bitterness and spices. It is so soft, smooth, creanessmy and full of taste, this must be the real angels share! All other beers in the world, eat your heart out!!!"
"the only complaint I could have is that the nose is not strong enough. but i find this to be completely irrelevant when considering how synergistic the whole beer is together. keeping this brew from receiving a perfect score, in that respect, would not be right. this is the beer, and will be so in my view until I try something that is even better for its own style."
"drinkable? absolutely!"
"I was expecting a lot, and it delivered."
"Drinkability: the only thing impeding the drinkability is availability. More please."
"Bottle dated best before 08 03 088. Pours a deep mahogany, ruby highlights, and a long lasting huge pillow white head. Smells of rich dark fruit, candi sugar, cereal, a light grassiness, yeasty, a hint of alcohol, somewhat vinous, amazingly complex. Flavor profile is so deep, I'm not even sure I know how to describe it. Getting some candied figs, lightly chocolaty, chewy malts, buttery on the finish. Full velvety body with carbonation just dancing in your mouth. This definitely lives up to it's reputation."
"I need more. Please send."
"D- I must admit, I had pretty lofty expectations for this brew, but I can easily say that this is one of the best beers that I have ever had. By far one of the most complex and drinkable beers around."
"Guess I'm one of those people that likes Westy 8 more, as my score isn't as high for the 12. Pours a swampwater brown but plenty of tan head salvages the appearance. Smell is sweet, malty, dark fruit, stone fruit, grapes, yeast, and bread. Tastes similar, but add brown sugar to the mix. I don't find this as complex and layered as the Westy 8. Maybe that means my palate isn't as complex, but it is what it is. Body is medium with medium to high carbonation. Highly drinkable. Could drink 3 no problem. But I disagree with the characterization of this beer as best in the world. It's great but easily eclipsed by several brews. I wonder to what extent the beer's high rating self-perpetuates additional high scores."
"O: Deliciously drinkable despite of the high ABV. Perfect Belgian Trappist. Perfect Belgian Quad. Not as good as Rochefort 10 but, this is another story... ;)"
"Finally, Westy 12. Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass (its the only Trappist glass that I own). Beer was brown, mostly clear until the mud at the bottom of the glass came out, this was avoidable, i know how to pour. The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant. More yeast, no aftertaste. A perfect beer. I wish I could have ti year round."
"Pours a rusty brown with a thin but dense white head, leaves lots of lacing. The color is not terribly appealing. The smell is of roasted nuts, hijiki seaweed, sweet grape, a rich caramel malt -- very complex. The flavor is sweet grapes (like cognac, almost), caramel, grain, with a lingering bitter earthy finish. It's creamy but clean in the mouth, not at all viscous, very nice. Really just too delectable for words. More."
"D- I'm loving this, although I'm not sure it soundly beats out others like the Abt 12 and Rocheforte 10. Definitely a great drink, worth the try, although I probably won't get it again because of the price."
"I think I built this up too much in my head. It is definitely not on the top of this hophead's list, but still an amazing beer that I would highly recomend."
"Conclusion: Wow, truly one of its kind. Deserves an A+ easily. Perfectly balanced beer. Outstanding."
"D - Ridiculously drinkable. It took quite a bit of restraint to not put down the Westy 12s I had at in de Vrede in two minutes. Every time you take a sip of this stuff, you instantly want another."
"Bottle pours dark brown with a white head. Has a brown sugar aroma to it with some malt undertones. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lot of tiny bubbles for carbonation. I really like the feel of this beer. Taste is very complex. There is candi sugar, dark fruit, some sweet malt, and a small amount of hop spice. Alcohol is hidden very well. The blend of malt, hops, mouthfeel, and finish makes this a supreme beer. Truly world class."
"Just excellent."
"Cheers!"
"So, I have finally had the highly renowned Westvleteren 12. Tonight I tried this beer along side the St. Bernardus 12, which was my favorite trappist beer up to this point. I've also had the Rochefort 10, but after drinking these two I think I need to try it again. Drinking the St. Berndardus and Westvleteren head to head has really helped define the differences in these beers. In terms of appearance, the St. Bernardus looks much more attractive to me. However, I found myself liking the overall flavor of the Westvleteren more, and since beer is mostly about flavor, I tip my hat to the Westy. It truly is an exceptional beer."
"Pretty good, I'd say! Not sure if this becomes my definitive quad, but for sure it's a very interesting one and appreciably complex. I wouldn't mind sipping away at it again."
"Well, I have had it. Nothing else to drink now. Overall, this is one beer that lives up to its hype. Coupling its quality with its rarity makes this beer a real treat."
"Unbelievably drinkable for the alcohol content. Extremely hard to get unfortunately and althought it is easily one of my favorites of all time, but I think I just prefer my RIS's better."
"Initially, the high carbonation is a little bit off-putting, but as it warms and dies down it becomes much more pleasing. I didn't really understand the darker complex belgians when I began my journey. Beers like this, Rochefort 8/10, and St Bernardus 12 really help in making sense of the magical and mythical works of the trappists!"
"D: It's a great beer, but in almost a dozen bottles of having this, I can't recall one that was above a wisp of carbonation. Maybe I have bad luck or maybe this beer just lacks in that department. I don't care for that. Given the difficulty of acquiring it, I give the nod to St. Bernardus 12 here."
"Thank you Hophead101!!!"
"An excellent beer, and the world number one, if not mine. I can see why people like it, but for me it doesn't stand out from the crowd."
"Poured into my Trappist Westvleteren goblet after getting a HOLE IN ONE yesterday. What a way to celebrate. Dark opaque brown with a frothy two finger head; some minor lacing down the glass. Smell was heavenly; dark fruits, malty with some spice, sweet. Taste was similar, very complex; sweet and dry at the same time, very rich fruit flavor; figs, raisins, dates? Amazing how long down the throat the flavors continue. As it warmed it was slightly easier to taste the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel was really good, with a high degree of carbonation to keep all corners of the pallette involved in the pleasure. Drinkability from a flavor standpoint is good, but this one sneeks up on you. A powerhouse of alcohol."
"This beer is not all hype. Well worth the money."
"Mouthfeel: Chewy, full bodied. Low carbonation, which suited the beer nicely."
"D. Goes down very well. I drank slowly to enjoy the taste, however it tastes better when it is gulped."
"One of my friends said this, and I agree, this is a much better gulper than a sipper. You do the math..."
"D - Very good could drink a bunch but wouldn't want to over due it either."
"This is totally a highly drinkable brew, but, honestly, if I'm going to drink a Quad, which I often do, I'd probably reach for a different one than this, first."
"Finally I have this legendary beer in my glass. The bottle looks really good, no label - which brewery can do that? Dark in the glass, almost black, nice head. Starts strong and malty, modest sweetness. Notes of wood and a bit liquorice. Not as strong as exspected, very drinkable for its strength. Warming finish. Really great beer!"
"D= awesome. The most amaing thing I've tasted in a long time."
"Brought back a couple of bottles from Brussels last summer and aged for a little over ayear. Pours a nice brown with white head and smells of sweet malts. Carbonation is just right and allows for excellent drinability. Just has a crazy mild sweetnees that hides the high alcohol content - yes it tastes a little like grape soda at some points. Overall, not necessarily the best beer I've ever had, but probably the most balanced with such a high alcohol content."
"D- Exceptionally drinkable given the ABV. Could have 3 or 4 of these in a sitting if I were so lucky. (4.5)"
"Pours dark brown head. Lots going on in the aroma. Dark fruits, sherry, candy, quite a bit going on here. Flavor is very complex, fruit, funk, alcohol, caramel, chocolate. Finishes highly carbonated, but doesn't get in the way of the beer. I could still use less carbonation on this one. Light alcohol notes which melded well with the beer without taking away from the flavors. Overall I can see why people would enjoy this if big boozy belgians are your thing. I personally don't have the want to drink this more than once a year at most."
"Thanks to atsprings for splitting this bottle."
"Many thanks to afatty for the in-person trade. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip a hazy, murky brown with a nice light tan head that lasts as a thin layer that leaves slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is an incredible blend of sweet fruits, brown sugar, clove, spices and numerous other aromas that just add up to spectacular. The taste is more of the same, just about everything you look for in a beer all melded perfectly into one. The beer is medium bodied with decent alcohol presence, but with a taste that good, you barely notice. This one certainly lives up to the hype, and thanks to afatty's generosity, I look forward to trying it again!"
"What it all comes down to is that every time you pick out a flavor with this one, there's a subtlety and clarity to it that is just striking. Everything just rings true with every aspect of it. I'm humbled to be drinking this thanks to the generosity of a man I feel truly blessed to have met through this website, which only adds to the depth of quality I suppose. Lives up to the hype."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a dark murky brown with a thick white head. Aroma is very fruity--lots of dark fruits (plum, apple, and fig) plus some honey. Flavor is nice and fruity, with yeast notes and a rich malt base. The palate sort of had a pulp-like quality to me. Very nice and delicious! I can't wait to try this again."
"This is a great beer, but I believe just a notch below Rochefort 10."
"D--I really feel ashamed to be chugging this like I am. I can't help it. This is spectacular. This and HOTD Adam are the two most drinkable +10% ABV beers I have ever had. All around this beer is amazing, mind blowing, unbelievable. The hype is real. I need more. I will get more. I must get more."
"This brew was born in November of 2008 which makes it only half a year old. I must say that I got a little anxious to try this one. Still have one more that I plan on aging for a long while."
"Davey shared this bottle with me when we drank my Westy 8. Poured into goblet a still, murky, yeasty, brown with no head. Smelled of dark fruit, brandy. Taste of dark fruit as well, raisin, cherry, fig, a little warm, in the finish. This was pretty fizzy in the mouth which surprised me as it didn't look very carbonated when I poured it. Amazing beer and I'm glad I was able to sample this."
"D: What to say about this legendary brew? Well, I think it's almost as good as it's reputation say it is. It's just unbelievably tasty with an impressive complex character. This one comes really close to perfection."
"Smells of bourbon, raisins, dark fruits, honey, candi sugar and a phenol character. Tastes of fruit, honey and dark malts. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, tingles the tongue and finishes smooth. The sweetness, carbonation and alcohol warming character of this beer mend together perfectly. Drinkability is exceptional, I could enjoy this all night."
"Medium bodied, with a soft carbonation"
"Bottle reads a date on the cap of 19 11 11. Beer poured into my Westvleteren goblet is rich dark brown in color. No head or lacing to speak of has me a bit worried given this beer's rich tradition. Nose is wonderful and complex. Notes of candi sugar, dark fruit, anise and caramel. Taste is complex as well and nearly as great as the boquet. Amazing synthesis of flavors. Mouthfeel is too thin and the beer lacked enough carbonation. Alcohol was there but overwhelmed by the amazing flavor. A great beer but I would like to have one with a bit more carbonation."
"Myself, capra12, and Jimmy were in agreement that we simply cannot wait to enjoy this beer again."
"A classic that I would love to have again."
"i bought this bottle in 2003 so it had some time on it, i was let down with this beer...could have been a variety of reasons...maybe held onto it too long. i would give it another try."
"Easily the best beer I've had. Yes, there's a degree of mystique added given that it's also so rare. But seriously - try it!"
"Overall this was an excellent beer. I can see why it is the best in the world. I personally would not give it such a grand title because of its less than steller lacing and mouth feel however this is truly a great beer that i found myself in awe of."
"Overall I was very happy to try this beer, but I really wanted to be blown away but unfortunately I wasn't. I would still drink this in a heartbeat but the price of a bottle just wasn't worth it to me."
"Though this was one of the more enjoyable beers I've ever had, I think it's hype and limited availability have propelled it to #1. It's deserving of a top 10, but for it's rarity I think St. Bernardus Abt 12 makes a great substitute."
"Overall I enjoyed this one very much. One of the best examples of this style out there, although probably not number one according to my personal tastes. Still, this would definitely be a regular if it were more readily available."
"It is #1 for a reason. Please try it if you can."
"The best beer in the world? A lot of the hype certainly comes from how difficult it is to obtain. It's certainly a world-class beer. We'll just leave it at that."
"Those monks sure know how to brew a fantastic beer."
"pristine condition, cap said oct 08 as the brew or bottle date. stunner of a nose. best i've ever had. warm it was very silky, satin, smooth ect ect. great balance, acidity, woodsy. super finish. cooled down a bit more chocolate came out but the best milk chocolate you could ever imagine, with muddled fruits. super finish. could drink this all day every day. lives up to the hype and the best beer i've ever had."
"This is a very nice treat at @$10usd while over in Belgium. I saw at the most in Brugge and at differing prices. My first experience with this beer a few years ago at the abbey cafe was completely unforgettable."
"Overall, quite impressed and appreciative of the opportunity to try it. Definitely world class."
"What a great beer. I can certainly see why it's the top rated in the world. While it's not my highest rated beer, it's certainly deserving of it's praise. Very drinkable despite the high ABV, which is virtually absent in the taste. So good. I will cherish the remaining bottles I have and drink them a bottle at a time over the next few years. Thanks again, Jason!"
"I love old stouts and some of the crazy extreme beers that are now being produced. However, for overall quality and flavor this is probably the best ale I've ever tasted. I hope I can try it again. Don't miss this one if you get the chance!"
"Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had."
"The Westvleteren is 1 year aged. Pours a hazy mahogany with a decent sized head. It looked like it would be a gusher at first, but didn't quite make it over the top. The head dissipates quickly. It smells largely of dark fruits, with a bitterness combined with it. There is also a sweetness combined with it as well. The alcohol comes through slightly in the smell, but not to strong. The taste is filled with tons of spices and dark fruits. The alcohol has largely mellowed into the taste, though there is a warming sensation to the beer. The bitterness blends nicely into the taste, though there is a slight dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is as smooth as I've ever had a beer. The beer goes down smooth and is very drinkable. If I ever head over to Belgium, I'll enjoy myself a few."
"Not the most drinkable beer in my cellar. But I had to try it to see the hype of the #1 beer around."
"Overall, this beer did not disappoint. It was certainly a treat and an honor to share with a good friend. The 12 oz was probably the right amount of beer for two people to drink. It is a great sipping beer and would be a perfect after dinner or special occasion beer. No off flavors or hot alcohols at all, very, very well crafted beer."
"O: This is truly an outstanding beer. I sure all the hype surrounding it adds to the mystic of it. There no evidence this is a 10% beer. It is very well hidden. Thanks to my son, Geoff for a great birthday present!"
"If you get the chance, try it. But don't pay like 80 USD for it, there are better beers out there!"
"Still it's a must try, highly recommended after this time."
"OK A land mark review.... My first! So I thought I would start with a Slam dunk. L) Darker than I thought it would be ..Very dark but not a RIS. Two finger head. S) Molasses, dark fruits,. sweet. T) Same and stays along time, awesome. F) Very good . D) excellent.. This is not my type but I can appreciate this GREAT GREAT Beer. Is this the best beer in the world? ....I Don't think so .. I'm an RIS guy.. But I have had the best BEER in the WORLD and that is a lot more then most people can say."
"d- wish this beer wasnt so rare and expensive but i could drink this every day for the rest of my life. in fact, if i ever get on death row, this will be my final supper."
"Thanks again Dave, I really appreciate this one!"
"Bottle Pours a murky brown with tan head. The head lasts well. The head laces well. Has a great aroma of fruits, spices, cocoa, and vanilla. Has perfect carbination and an awesome mouthfeel. I waited a long time to get one of these and it is great. The flavors are very complex, tastes dance on your tongue. Has a medium to heavy body. A thick texture. The Finish is smooth and perfect. This truely is an awesome beer. The balance is perfect. I can't think of any bad part of this"
"This was certainly a special tasting for my developing palate. I want to deeply thank my friend Tyler for blessing me with this pinnacle of beer as a 26th birthday present. This superior belgian ale poured an opaque, cloudy dark amber hue from the bottle. The perfection in this brew lies in both the flavor and the balance. The flavor is complex, yet sweet on the tongue at first with hints of banana, raisins, plums, strawberries, and dates. The finish is of smokey dark fruit with a pleasant warmth of alcohol down the throat. This ale truly has every important aspect you could hope for in a beer. The flavors work in perfect harmony together, with neither over powering one another. The carbonation is subdued, yet present enough to remind you that this is a truly special belgian ale. I am truly amazed at the subtle, yet complex collection of flavors present in this ale. For those that are considering trying this ale for the first time, please take my advice and enjoy all of the wonderful flavors at room temperature. This brew achieves true perfection, and I am honored to have experienced the world's greatest ale on my birthday. Thank you Tyler."
"Overall, again very glad to have tried this brew and it is indeed wonderful stuff. The flavors and warming touch of booze really provided a pleasant experience. Against the style, it might just be the best I've had. As to whether it's the best brew in the world, I'm not quite sure. Definitely try it if you have the chance."
"D- I am going to revisit this one as much as possible, but this beer is not something I'd consider going to a bunch. Every now and then will keep this one special."
"You have to be brain dead to not like this beer. It was a religious experience, it smelled like a church, tasted like heaven and had the body of the Holy Trinity. But if you're reviewing this beer i'm not telling you anything you don't know. Not sure how you get much better than this..."
"Pours slightly fogged brown. Nose is malty. Darker sugars. Flavor is bringing much of the same. I want to say it is kind of boozy as well. Not sure if some age would mellow that out. Malty plums start to appear as it warms. Rich, yes. Smooth, yes. Feel is quite smooth on liquid. Carbonation is middle of the road. I like this, yes. It's good. But I feel like this is a bit tight and might need more age to develop more noticeable complexities. And it's certainly not my favorite beer ever."
"This is a very drinkable beer. You need to sip it because of the higher alcohol, but it's really fun to drink. Very dynamic - most definitely worth trying. If you can get ahold of a bottle - do it! This would go really well with a good meal. My wife said this beer was ""savory and sweet, like a good roast."" I could see this going well with a big platter of fruit, crusty bread, and cheese."
"D: The high alcohol content would prevent a huge consumption of it, but as it's not noticeable, so it doesn't prevent me from wanting more. It actually went down really easily, and overall it was a really enjoyable brew. I'd gladly buy more if I could find it and it wasn't so expensive."
"D- It was easy to drink and fun for sure. Nothing that I could drink all day or on a regular basis but was damn easy to drink."
"A nice beer with a unique blend of cherries and brown nut malt caramel malts tones. At first I was ""best beer in the world?"" but it started to grow on me with each sip. I kept it on my tongue and rolled it around. The mouthfeel is luscious with a perfect balance of carbonation and dryness. I haven't felt that since say St Benardus 12. But St. Benardus isn't a substitute for the fruitiness that this beer imparts. I expected more in the aroma department but the flavor more than makes up for it."
"D- Not sessionable but the 10 plus percent is hardly evident in the taste or feel and this is a wonderful quad. What else can I say. Well one thing is each sip is better than the last sip I took. westy 12 is a creamy sweet ride with a body of epic proportions. Cant wait till I try it again"
"Pours an amber brown with a small head that quiclkly fades away. The nose on this baby is amazing. Lots of sweet malts, dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins and candi sugar. There is soo much complexity. some alcohol in there as well. Taste is similar to smell. Very complex, dark fruits, candi sugar not as much alcohol as the smell would indicate. Feels nice in your mouth good carbonation and kind of creamy when swallowed. This was an amazing beer what else can I say. I mean its Westvleteren 12."
"What an experience. This is my first review on this site but by no means is this my first beer or review. At this rate I doubt I will find a better beer. If you can find it, try Belgian stores or trade here, pull the trigger on it and don't think twice."
"Perfect."
"Not the best beer in the world, or the best beer I've evr had, but goddamn does it rank up there."
"I was'nt expecting perfection but I was hoping for more... very good. If I get another bottle I'll take more notes and compare the results."
"My only perfect beer. There can be only one."
"Overall: Must go to Belgium"
"Great beer (not that it needs my endorsement); I look forward to trying this with some age on it."
"A very good beer. Made the Rocherfort 10 seem rather boring."
"Had a tasting at my house this past weekend and the first beer up was the Westy 12! Appearance was good not allot of head out of every bottle but a good amount. Color was a nice cloudy dark brown and looked very yummy. Smell was not overwhelmingly intense but was there and was a big hint to the complex taste that was about to happen. Sweet malts was a dominate taste with very next up dark fruits like raisins and figs etc. The taste it's self had everyone take a step back and honestly look at each others expressions. Dark fruits raisins and figs powered threw with sweet malts. More flavors were present but could not pick each one out as the beer was so complex. A bite of Alcohol was present and was a pleasant addition. The bit of Alcohol would probably hamper the continuous bottle after another bottle. I feel for me at least this beer was meant to be a one to two bottle a session beer."
"M- light, fluffy, and highly carbonated which i was expecting for the style. what i wasnt expecting was how smooth this one was going to be."
"Have a few more bottles and am looking forward to how this one tastes with age."
"Notes - The best of its style, easily. I see why it is held in as high regard as it is. Exceedingly drinkable despite the high ABV percentage."
"D: Great beer! Has a nice warming effect. Perfect beer to drink while relaxing."
"I was obviously looking forward to this beer and it did not disappoint. A brew that everyone should experience!"
"For mine, it's not the holy grail."
"Yes, the Westy 12 is worthy of the hype! Is it worth the money that you have to pay for it? Well, I guess that depends on how much money you make. I will most certainly buy more, but it's not something I can afford to drink even on a similar regular basis. Yes, this is my new favorite beer."
"D- I had to force myself from chuggin this beer down. THe smell, taste, and mouthfeel is just incredibly smooth making this a 5 on drinkability as its like no other."
"I've now had eight of the top 10 beers on BA, and can confidently say that the Westies, Dark Lord, and the Plinies are not overhyped. They are the best examples of their respective styles that I've tasted."
"It is too bad that we have to split this beer due it's lack of availablity. But, I am glad that we have friends that would bring over what most agree as the best beer in the world on a sunday night, just because."
"Could sip this one by the fire all night. I think that A is ruined for all future quads by this one. Much hype but definitely worth seeking out."
"D: Yes! Too strong to have more than a couple though!"
"M&D: the texture is blissful, incredibly satisfying and rounded, with utterly smooth carbonation to complement a full (but never thick) body... All in all, there's no drama here, no BIG flavours or overpowering elements to dominate the scene; only a brilliantly structured, evolving flavour profile proceeds from one stage to the other just seamlessly. I can't work out how dry and bitter it could smoothly transform into in the rounded finish given the oily malty foretaste, while consistently there's neither any trace of big alc. nor sticky sugary mouthfeel. This might have been the smoothest and harmonious Quadruple that I've had the luck to try - if it could be obtained at a much lower price (I was charged US$18 by the ""Belgian Shop""!), I wish to sip one bottle of this ale a month, just to remind myself how blissful and tranquil the beer world can be, without much pretence and loudness."
"Thanks again Josh for this tasty brew!"
"I have to say, the spicy malts of this beer are like no other I've tried. And it's not the spice flavor you find in some winter beers where you they just dumped a can of nutmeg, cinnamon and the like in a pot and called it a winter beer."
"Also can be found in Bruges..."
"Maybe it's the thought of enjoying this for the very first time but this dows go down very quickly. It definitely takes a while for that one off-flavor - the floral soap - to burn off its weirdness. Note no real mention of booziness on the taste or palate profile - after the initial rum raisin ice cream scent it simply isn't an issue. My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isn't enough. With many extreme offerings the flavors and notions are in your face so that there's no mistake. This treasure is definitely more subtle and takes a little more time to figure out. Great, complex construction."
"A special treat for my wife and I on our anniversary, as she is a huge Belgian fan. Pours a hazy deep brown color, with huge (2 finger), thick head that quickly evaporates into my goblet. Little darker than I expect from a quad. The smell was striking to me, and in a good way. It was nice mix of the sweetness of raisins and honey and an almost red wine alcohol smell. A very unique, and very enticing smell. The complex aroma is definitely a forebearer of the taste. A blend of a malty, sweet backbone, with spices, and that red wine character (I am not a huge wine advocate, so I cannot describe it any more specifically, and have never used a wine reference in a beer review, it just fits here). Medium carbonization and a medium density makes this rest nicely in the mouth, allowing you to enjoy all the complexities of the flavor. The ABV is also superbly masked by the complex flavor. Worthy of its lofty status indeed."
"Notes: Well, there you have it. This is the highest rated beer in the world (at least here on BA and I believe other places too) and it is deserving of the honor. This, my friend, is the king of beers."
"D. Great. I could drink this beer all night unfortunately I only have the 1 *sigh*. Is this the best beer in the world? I don't know, I haven't had them all yet but it is definitely the best damn beer I've ever had."
"12oz bottle with 13.08.11 marked on the gold cap. Dark, murky brown with a an odd smattering of bubbles almost like a slime. Smells nice, caramel, sugar, raisins but not as good as the 8. It tastes boozy, brown sugar, sweet cherry syrup, tastes like a good quad to me. Overall, I preferred the 8 to the 12 but I usually prefer dubbels."
"After hearing all the hype....I can say this is a truly amazing beer....and it was a true honor to sample it...."
"This is a standout complex brew."
"Will I go way out of my way to buy 3 cases and get them home from Belgium one day? Damn right I will!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In a word, sublime. The texture is pure velvet, bringing out all of the complex flavors as good as it possibly could get. This was tasted blind against seven other examples of this style, and it lives up to the incredibly high standards and expectations we've all heard about. I would seek this out again without question."
"This is a very drinkable beer, hides the alcohol very well. Very tasty and surely one of the best beers I have tried, easy top 3. As for being the best beer in the world, I would say there are a couple better ones out there I tried."
"I love it aged or not aged"
"This really is wonderful. I can't wait to have another. I only received 8 of these. So, I'm going to do my damnedest to cellar some. But, I have a feeling I will fail miserably. That's okay too. :P"
"This beer is excellent for sure, especially for its style."
"Time to have another!"
"On the whole, this is a magnificently made beer and understandably rated as such. For a true Belgian beer fan, this may be the end all/be all of beer. For someone, such as myself, who much prefers other styles of beer, this is appreciated for what is: a beer made with consummate skill, but to my taste, not the ""greatest beer in the world."""
"Overall: a fond memory"
"A. Either. I have now tried the beer both fresh, and after 5 years in the Kulminator cellar. Overall I would say the cellared version was the more complex, better tasting beer, but it had lost much of its carbonation. Whichever way you choose to drink it, it is a fantastic beer."
"D: This beer was worth the wait. I certainly do wish access was better and easier, and that ease of procurement wouldn't take anything away from the beer. It does live up to the hype."
"Pours an nice deep caramel brown with a decent head that dissipates rather quickly. The smell for me was probably the worst part, it doesn't smell as good as it tastes but it still smells pretty damn good. Sweet malts and candied sugars make this beer incredibly easy to drink. Would love to try this with a couple of years on it. I wish I had it every day as this would easily be my everyday go to beer. Really in a category of its own. Excellent beer! One of the few beers really worth the hype."
"Nice mouthfeel, very smooth with medium carbonation. The feeling as it glides across the palate is almost indescribable. A true sipper that I would love to savor throughout the night if only I could obtain a decent amount worth of it. Now all I have to do is make a trip to Belgium so I can (hopefully) obtain a full case worth for about 40 bucks. Trying this should be a goal of any BA and I am just glad I was able to fulfill it, even to this small extent, so early in my journey."
"Hype. Yep. Live up to it? Yep. Glad I've had the opportunity to have this a few times. Seek it out if you love beer. Obviously."
"All hail the king in his golden crown."
"Procured this rare gem from bgramer in July (thanks Brendan) and shared with Thirstybird. 11.2 Oz. bottle dated 08.04.11 served in my Simon Pierce goblets. Poured a mahogany/cola color - some light penetration with ruby red highlight around the edges and tiny particles visible in solution. Incredible head retention unlike any brew I've ever had, with thick sheets of sticky lacing evident throughout the tasting. Nose was wine-like with some woody characteristics, spices and cherry-flavored cough medicine. Taste follows nose with a dry, oaky and spicy finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with a tingly effervescence from beginning to end. Hands down the best Quad I've ever had. So smooth and easy drinking with an abv that's undetectable. I was not at all let down by this incredible Trappist offering and really savored the changing qualities of the brew as it warmed."
"Overall a great beer, however with that being said i think rochefort 10 and st bernardus are definitely its equal. i might even have to rate the rochefort 10 higher than it. perhaps there is even a bit of disappointment for holding and coveting the beer so long, that it can never reach the expectations that you have set for it."
"I am honored to have tried this gem.. It won't rank as my favorite beer, but I can certainly see why it's so well respected..."
"I'm very glad I had the chance to try this, and will jump on the opportunity if I have it again. Worth the trade and then some."
"D= I wish I could say, ""Keep 'em coming!", but at $20 a bottle I gotta save bottle number three."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a slight white head with some lacing. The smell is of raisins, nuts and chocoalte. The taste has lots of raisin flavors along with a nice chololate malt flavor. This beer is very full of flavor, there is also a nice flavor of the yeast that blends very nicely with the big malt flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, but the carbonation level seems low. For a +10% abv beer this is incredibly drinkable."
"D - Easy to drink and super enjoyable. Even with the high ABV I would totally try to session this."
"This is a great beer, no doubt. I'm not sure that everyone will find it the be all end of beverages, though. It has a average-nice head and lacing. It smells fine and drinks easily. But after all the trouble I went through to get hold of this stuff, I'm just not THAT blown away. Good stuff, no doubt. But the best in the world?"
"I can now die a happy man."
"This beer was split between four of us and poured into small tumblers...I had extremely high expectations for this beer and they were definitely met. Beer poured a dark toffee color with a thick foamy head. It smelled of caramel, malt and flowers. I was a bit surprised by the complexity of the taste; I know that I cannot do it justice: very strong caramel and malt flavours, with a striking tone of ethanol. It had a flavor of dark bread and a light sweetness to it, but was not sticky. Very well done."
"bottle from the Xmess 2012 stateside shipment, consumed 6/2013: Just a flawless example of the style. Gorgeous brune color with khaki head. Raisins, dates, papery aged hops, and delicately spicy yeast. Alcoholic warmth. Part of my pre-Belgium re-education. Flawless."
"I got a 6 pack with 2 bottles of blonde, 8, and 12. When I final got it my expectations were unreasonably high. I tried a bottle of the blonde then the 8 and both beers were wonderful but did not meet my expectations. Then I tried the 12 and it was fantastic and made the whole pain in the ass of get it worth while. It is rich, very sweet, lightly carbonated and has a slightly thick mouth feel. I wish that it had a little more of a head and that they only used there nondescript bottles, the ones without the ring of glass that says trappist on it, but at the end of the day those are the only negative thing I can say about this beer."
"This was my first beer off 2009, I had it at the stroke of midnight. It was sent to me by a friend in the states. I tried to keep an open mind and not get sucked into the previous hype about this beer, but was it ever justified. Poured dark and thick with an off white head in a Westy glass. Carbonation reminded me of the pricklyness of a Westmalle and the taste was roasted and sugary. What an incredible, complex beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"D - Wow. The complexity of the malt and yeast character is unique and rich. The BJCP describes this style as ""smooth and dangerous"" and I'd have to agree. Deceptively easy to drink for 10.2% ABV. Makes me wish I were a monk. Almost..."
"So, if the 8 is incredible, it's tough to conjure a a word for this beer. Definitely the best beer I've ever had. I wanted it to be hype the first time I went, but this beer has a way of surprising me with how good it is every time I drink it. One of the most transcendent of man's concoctions."
"The smell is brown sugar, similar to candy. The flavor matches this except that there is notable hop. Not surprisingly, very strong warm alcohol flavor and feel. This is a thick beer with a low level of carbonation."
"M/D: Full bodied, but not too heavy. Carbonation is a bit prickly and this is really the only negative of the beer for me. Drinkability is excellent even for a big quad. Absolutely worth every ounce of praise that has been heaped upon it. Excellent beer."
"Well, what can I say? This is definitely a magical beer, the pure intensity and complexity of the flavors is insane. Best beer in the world? Maybe. One of the best in the world? Yes."
"What can I add. This was the best beer I've ever had in absolutely every category. When enjoyed in its own glass, it's heaven. I sought this out in Belgium, and found it in Brugge. I brought a couple bottles home and enjoyed them with family for the holidays. Absolutely the best of the best."
"So I'll keep it short. Given the expectations one has after reading all these reviews, I approached skeptically. Westy 12 delivered and then some. A genuinely beautiful beer. Find some and try it."
"03.24.09 Second sample. Oddly enough...this experience has been significantly different from the first. The heat that i experienced the first time just wasn't there. This one was much more drinkable than the first..the flavor is phenomenal and the mouth is quite creamy."
"D: This absolutely lives up to the hype. It went down so smooth and easy it was scary! Wonderful."
"D: Dangerously drinkable even @ 10.2%. Not sure when I'll get another of this fantastic beer but hopefully sooner than later."
"Could I be possible that I had a bad bottle? Looks good with a murky brown color and quickly disappearing caramel head. Smells fantastic, sweet and fruity. Taste is heavy with fruits, figs, none of the ""bread"" taste I had had expected. Mouthfeel is thick. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the heaviness. I prefer the Bernardus and to a greater extent, the westy 8."
"This is a damn fine beer and one I would love to have more bottles of. I believe I enjoy St. Bernardus' version more so but this is the highest of quality. Thanks again for the treat Bill!"
"A great beer, but a bit overrated in my opinion."
"9/4/9/5/19/4.6"
"D - here is where it loses some points. The small aftertaste of the alcohol makes this one less drinkable than other brews. This is drinkable, yes, just not the most drinkable beer I have had. The small alcohol bite at the end is the most unappealing aspect of an almost perfect beer."
"D-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you don't take your time with this brew you surely won't get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion. A bit overrated (Its hard to be a perfect beer across the board)-but still an excellent, stand-out, well put together brew."
"I found this beer for sale at O'Brien's, with a hefty price tag for a 12 oz. Still, it was cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and I wasn't about to pass up the top rated beer in the world. Pours murky brown with a big tan head that stays around for a while. Pleasantly sweet aroma of cherries, prunes, brown sugar, licorice, bread dough, oak, and yeast. Unbeleivably light mouthfeel. Its like the beer hovers on your tongue. Amazing taste. It mimics the aroma quite well, with an intriguing combination of tastes. I had the same problem as others: it was very, very difficult to pin down specific flavors. It was almost as if the beer was blending and mixing while in your mouth. Sweet, sour, spice, and fruit were in constant motion and made up a beer that is almost undescribably good. It was well worth its price."
"This is the best beer I've ever consumed. Amazing. Awesome."
"dark like the night, smelly like a sweet, the mouthfeel is heavy but it's really drinkable without any doubts... And the taste... incredible... strong toffee, nice sweet bitterness, the alcool is present but it's taste is not too much present, so... it's well balanced for a (very) strong beer... 10.20% damn... those monks knows how life should be... maybe they found the best way to live a good life..."
"Overall notes: This is by far the best beer I've ever tasted, and completely worth any pilgrimage to sample it."
"Drinkability - This beer is perfectly drinkable. I didn't want it to live up to the hype, but it did. It is a fantastic beer. I don't know if I could point at a beer and call it the best in the world, but this is one of the most well-crafted beers out there. Even at 10.2%ABV, I could session this beer. It would be a mainstay in my beer rotation if it didn't require giving up shares of my soul to acquire it."
"Solid beer I thought, I really enjoyed this one."
"This beer is damn close to perfect. Balanced fruits, bready, malt, spices. The body is light. I don't recall ever drinking a quad with anything close to this body and mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. There is little reason for me to wax on about this beer. Many reviews have nailed it."
"This may not always prevail as the greatest beer on earth, but it deserves a place in heaven."
"D= Definitely a world class ale, and deserved of its following. I have a hard time saying it is the best beer in the world, but certainly a great beer that I will drink any time I can."
"Where are these monks hiding the alcohol? This beer was deliciously complex and balanced that I could not taste the 10.2% alcohol until I was working on a nice buzz. There is nothing I could say about this beer that has not been said before so all I want to add is, if you haven't had one get one. You won't be disappointed even if you pay $20 a bottle like I did. (I would have paid $50 if I knew it was so damn good.)"
"Certainly deserving of the hype. An excellent beer and probably my favourite of the quads."
"D - Very good beer. Alcohol is well hidden, but still kicks."
"Mouthfeel was zesty yet smooth. Very drinkable. Very well hidden alcohol. This is not one of my favorite styles but I would never pass the opportunity to enjoy one of these."
"D- Very drinkable you don't taste the high ABV at all."
"I was always skeptical of this beer being the ""King of the Hill", but after having this bottle I can fully understand why and fully endorse it's Kingness.  Wow."
"Though this is certainly a great beer, I would definitely not say that it's the best in the world. Personally, I prefer Rochefort 10 over this, and that one is incredibly easier to obtain. If this was as available as Rochefort I doubt that it would be rated as high as it is. It's just one of those beers you have to try though so if you can I would highly recommend trading for it."
"Sweet without being cloying, & not overpowered with booze. I can't say this is the best beer I've ever had, but it's a damn good quadrupel, & better with every warmed up sip. I'll let the last one sit a bit before I pop it open."
"Thanks to Eric for this amazing brew. From a bottle that is a few years aged. The taste was amazingly smooth. A great body and head. The overall taste is fruity, perhaps raisins or prunes with a sweeter strawberry. But the fruity taste is also combined with hops and some spices. Awesome. No need to say anything but top notch."
"a buddy of mine shipped 4 of these to me for when he was home from iraq on R&R. thanks again mike!!! we were definately not let down. I'm not sure if its the best beer in the world...but it sure can't be far down the list. pours a beautiful dark color with a couple finger head in a chimay goblet. first taste is very, very smooth with an abundance of flavors. drinks extremely smooth without a harsh alcohol taste for such a strong beer. overall one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking,even for a hophead like me. a trip to the monastery is in my future hopefully. I would recommend this one to anyone!"
"wow. I'd love to put some age on a bottle and see how it develops. Wonderful beer. Thanks again for the hookup randy."
"It's hard to judge, while finely crafted, it's certainly not my personal favorite. Rochefort 10 has surpassed this at times, and other bottles fall short. One to savor and recognize as a benchmark Quadrupel."
"I had to search far and wide (even in Brugges) to find this beer, and Im glad I did! Drank a bottle at an amazing pub there and brought a couple home."
"Overall - My brother got this beer delivered for my 21st birthday (and I know he'll read this review, so thanks again!). However, I had many fears that what I had received would not live up to its reputation. I had heard stories about Westvleterens supposedly deteriorating significantly when transported overseas. Also, the fact that one of the beers I received was not in the usual Westvleteren bottle sparked fears that I may have received a cheap, recapped ripoff. However, the first taste assured me that this was the real deal. Though I have given this a much higher score than any other beer, I do not feel that I have been generous in any way with my scoring."
"I can't recommend this beer enough. I had it at the Cafe In De Vrede, across the street from the St. Sixtus abbey that brews the beer in Westvleteren. Awesome."
"Ruby brown in color with shades of rust and copper. Medium head but not near the retention of some in its class. It's still falls slowly to a ring, leaving random lacing down the glass. Smell is amazing. Not as big and rich in the malt department. It makes you anticipate a slightly less full body compared to others. Great scent of fruits. Some grape, raisin, plum, pear, and fig. More fruity than anything. Still a good touch of candy(i) sugar and light yeast. Leather. Some caramel is evident also. Taste is just as amazing. Good fruit flavors again, not too thick from caramel and the like. Candy sugar and a lightly toasted bready yeast. Also some subtle bubble gum flavor. A delicate touch of spice and candy sugar. Mouthfeel isn't as velvety as possible but very nice. More on the medium bodied side with a bit of spice. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in this brew. It's a pleasure to sip on, if possible. So full of flavor and complexity that it's tough to beat. Unbelievably drinkable for what it is."
"If you can get this beer do not hesitate. You won't be disappointed."
"not a technical review because I just love Belgians and this one is number 1"
"Overall, a darn good beer. Try it if you get a chance, though it might be difficult to obtain."
"Overall im glad i finally was able to try this beer, did it live up to the hype, yes and no, i still think Rochefort 10 is a better beer, alot cheaper and easier to find. I guess part of the hype with this beer is the availability of it. But dont get me wrong still an awesome beer, and as long as its rare you should try and seek it out at least once. I spoke with the owner at the Downtown Bar and he said he has about 10 bottles left right now"
"i think alot of this beer is hype. but it is still fantastic. yum."
"D: I can see why this beer is ranked as it is, this beer has something for everyone. It is subtle enough in taste to please even the staunchest BMC drinker around, no boozy heat, not raging hop bitterness or cloying malty sweetness. This is just a perfectly balanced, quiet, non-flashy, beer that is just an absolute pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability is very good. I really enjoyed this one. It's definitely top notch, excellent, and well worth the praise. However... I'll take Rochefort 10 or Pannepot. I liked those 2 just a little bit better than this one."
"Pours a deep brown with a nice layer of light brown head. Smells of dried dark fruits with some nice spiciness and caramel. The taste, wow the taste. At first sip, I thought it was pretty good, nice and complex. But the flavor just keeps lingering and developing. Fruits, sugars, a little doughy. Definitely some nutiness in the aftertaste. Also almost seems like a little black tea on the finish. Great mouthfeel. Sticky but smooth. This beer has managed to surpass any expectations I had!"
"While not the best beer I have ever had it is certainly one of the best and I believe it was worth the hype. I will be looking to get more of this whenever possible and I am very glad to have been able to try it."
"Pours a cloudy dark chestnut brown color with 2 fingers of creamy tan head into a tulip glass. Amazing retention with beautiful lacing that is both thick and sticky and also slides down the glass to reconnect with its brethren. Smells of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, honey, sweet bread, dark fruits, cinnamon, clove, rose petals, coriander, candy, light yeast, and slight alcohol. Tastes of candy, fruits like apple and pear, spices, a touch of citrus juice, caramel, sweet bready malts, cocoa powder, figs, plums, cherries, earthy notes, peppercorns, a touch of yeast, and a slight dash of alcohol. An amazing balance of flavors, each pronounced at first along the journey and then gently fading away, leaving only a hint of lingering taste behind. Smooth and velvety with a nice dry finish and great carbonation. Simply a fantastic beer, not my favorite beer of all-time, but definitely the best Quadrupel I've experienced and among the best beers out there. For as high in ABV as it is, it covers it up beautifully. This is a sipping beer, but only because you don't want the glass to run empty. Definitely worth a try whenever you may find it."
"D : Very easy to drink. I would love to get more of this hard to find beer. Greatest beer in the world? Probably not but it's not far off that mark."
"Pours a dark brown with no clarity. A thick brownish head. Aroma was honey and ripe fruit and tones of alcohol, very pleasing. Taste was very complex, some honey, fruit, and alcohol. Very well-balanced with sweetness. Chewy texture with a slight carbonation fizz, very smooth in the palate. Excellent beer good taste and not excessively filling. It does pack a punch which may put it out the desire as a session beer, but enjoyable none the less."
"The best thing about this beer is it goes through several different changes during the process of drinking it and all of them are great. The pour was a dark brown but not black. The nose came out with dates, caramel, leafs, and strong yeast. The texture was some what like champagne. Tasted way lighter then it looked. I almost could not taste the alcohol at all. When it started to warm up I started getting a heavy tobacco taste, would have even been good with a cigar or what ever it is you put in your pipe. Also some strong licorice flavors. The malt is perfect and not heavy at all. Not sure of the date of mine but I would love to try one of these that as quite of bit of age on it."
"Overall maybe the best single beer I have had. Wish I had more than 1 bottle."
"D- This beer is very drinkable considering its immensely complex flavor profile and a 10.2% ABV. Each sip leaves you in anticipation of the next."
"Thanks again Life is good for sharing such a rare brew as well as another BA who will remain nameless for trading me one to put away for my son when he is legal age. Who knows I may even split it 60 /40 LOL"
"Into its beautiful chalice it pours a very dark, yet clear, brown with highlights of ruby red shining through the brew, only a bit of head crowns the beer and it fades to a delicate lace. I raise the glass to my nose and scents of warm red grapes, cranberry and cherry come flooding into my awareness. The sweet smell of fruit, caramel and toffee candy wraps itself so nicely around the significantly boozy brew. It pours over my lips and onto my tongue. Sudden sweetness hits me with flavours of red wine, plums, and wild berries. The sweetness is quickly followed by a refreshing dryness brought on by the high alcohol content. Both the sweet and the bitter mingle and dance on the palette in perfect unison, and linger into a long dry aftertaste that leaves me begging for more. The low carbonation takes the edge off of what might have otherwise been a sharp and bitter dryness, and makes it so very easy to drink. And then I had a second sip."
"Was it worth the hype and hope? Indeed."
"Notes: This beer is positively phenomenal. Even without the hype and exclusivity, I have no doubt in my mind that I could easily call this the Holy Grail of beers. This beer doesn't need the hype to make it world-class. It speaks well enough for itself."
"Is this the best? I don't know. I started my adventure in legality about one year ago and I've already enjoyed what is commonly regarded as ""the greatest beer on earth"". No matter - breweries change and I have no doubt that within my lifetime W-12 will be unseated, hopefully for the better. In the meantime... I'll keep on coming back for this stuff."
"The appearance was brown, with a crown of light tan head which would cling to the ridge of the goblet of whomever had the pleasure of enjoying it. The lady was taken aback by the complexity of the aromas, contrasted with the dank odour of the stone corridors in the bowels of the monastery. The flavour was rapturous. rich, complex flavours of dark fruits, the yeast lending a spicy character and the alcohol rounding out the drink with a warmth and intensity that she had not experienced before. She let out a deep sigh. She could die content now, as she held in her hands what her heart had so longed for."
"Overall, one of the best Belgian's I have had, though it does not top much others by far"
"Drinkability is of course fanatstic and this is my favorite quad. The best beer in the world? Definitely not but within range..."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a thick tan head that lasts. Smells of banana, dark fruits, slight roastiness, and caramelized brown sugar. Taste is more on the chocolate/dark roasty malt side, but with banana and brown sugar. Sweet finish with noticeable bitterness and next to no alcohol. Thick velvety body with low-medium carbonation. Quite drinkable for the ABV."
"Stellar fresh, preferred fresh, damn good aged. Best beer in the world? That's a debate for the forums on BeerAdvocate.com, but it's deﬁnitely among the top."
"D - Each sip unfolds new themes and flavors. Like any good work of art, one's appreciation deepens as you delve further into it. Wonderful."
"This is the best beer I have ever tasted and I am genuinely jealous of those that live close enough to go to the brewery and partake in this wonderful beer."
"Big thanks to zaf88 for this trade. I feel blessed to have tried this truly unique brew."
"Drinkability is very good for this abv. While not a session beer, certainly one that is easy to drink too fast because of it's ease of consumption."
"HV"
"Pours a dark cola brown, but with minimal head. Smells of figs, carmel, brown sugar. All the above flavors plus cola, cinnamon, grape, raisin and I don't know what else. The flavors are all mild, in fact a good notch milder than I'd prefer, but they are very well-combined in an intriguing package. I kept sipping at it to try to get a grip on the elusive flavor. A great beer and well worth trying, but not as intense as some other quads. I liked the St. B a bit better, and at a quarter of the price it's no contest."
"This is a wonderful beer! It achieves a balance in both aroma and flavor such that nothing is dominate but rather achieves a complexity that keeps you looking for more!"
"D - Drinkability is good. The high abv does place limits on how many of these that should be consumed at once. There is really nothing bad that can be said about this beer. It excels in every category. Glad I got the chance to try one of these and I'd definitely have another."
"D: Scores just shy of perfect as this is a strong sipper, Complexity in this beer is unmatched and the balance is better than any I have tried. It seems I get a little more of everything--the fruity, malty, yeasty flavors mixed with just a little hops at the end."
"Cheers!"
"I guess its probably sacrilege to say this but this wasn't my favorite Belgian. It was good but not the best I've ever had. Still... I'm priveleged to have gotten the opportunity to try this."
"An exquisite and marvelous masterpiece that defines the beauty of beer."
"This is also going down way too easy. I'm hardly detecting the alcohol in this at all. What a masterwork."
"Deceivingly rich, with masterfully crafted character, it's very difficult to say how drinkable this is. So enjoyable to sip. While I certainly want more, I found it very satisfying."
"Westvleteren 12...the rosetta stone for many beer drinkers. This one was tasted alongside St. Bernardus 12, and Rochefort 10. Poured in to an Ommegang chalice a lovely dark rosewood color, with lighter rosy hues at the bottom of the glass, and a fluffy tannish/white heading that clings the the glass, and has great retention. Nose can only be described as extremely deep, with layers of prune, candy, licorice, caramel, more sweet dark fruit...the list goes on and on. Taste is quite breathtaking, and complex. Begins very rich and sweet, with dark fruit such as plum, prune and date. Chocolate can also be detected lingering in the background somewhere. Alcohol also lends itself perfectly to the flavors, giving it the perfect amount of richness and depth of character without overdoing it. The end of the beer is interesting, in that although there is little bitterness in initial flavor, there is some int he finish, that one might describe as spicy, and perhaps a bit earthy. Mouthfeel is the most exceptional aspect of Westy 12 in that it is just so damn smooth on the palate. It was a sort of cask conditioned beer character to it, yet it is bottled. Sometimes I think cask conditioning beer takes a bit away complexity and flavor wise, but with this one there is not much left to be desired. Drinkability is very very high, despite the high ABV, although I don't think I could bring myself to drinking more than one of these in a sitting....that might just be too decadent for me. As far as the other two beers, I am sad to say that they did not even come close. The Rochefort was a bit more robust and boozy, whereas the St. Bernardus was lighter, more carbonated, and quite a bit spicier. Ok, so final verdict: This is my second time tasting this brew, and the first time I was less than impressed. This tasting, on the other hand blew me away. I now have no problem proclaiming that this is the best Belgian Quad, and one of the best beers in the world. I suspect that this will be a permanent member of my want list for a while. Cheers"
"Drinkability- This beer is absolutely incredible. Not quite a perfect 5 for me but damn close. I feel lucky to have been able to try one and now I want more."
"This beer carries a lot of expectations and while it wasn't quite a perfect beer for me, it still came pretty darn close. The look, smell, and taste of this are outstanding but it's the body and drinkibility that are truly world class, being rich and complex but still immensely smooth and quaffable. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"The body is really key here. There is noticeable body here but finishes dry for style. Just interesting to see all the flavor come out and then drop out with a lingering flavor. Overall a great beer. Loved the complexity and blend overall. I can see why this is a treat for so many!"
"Very warming, without being too hot. This could probably age with the best of them. Light body, with a good amount of carbonation aids in drinkability. What a world-class beer!"
"On a side note, if at all possible wait to try this beer until you are able to make the pilgrimaged out to the monastery in Belgium. The surrounding country is some of the most peaceful and quiet farmland I've ever seen, and builds up the experience of trying the beer to a whole new level."
"This is only my second time ever seeing or having this beer. What struck me most about it upon a second try was the predominance of chocolate that I tasted. It is very delicious, perhaps a little boozy once it starts warming up, but a very, very tasty beer."
"couple around since it is a top five brew that I have had. Recomend that everyone try this one because it will knock your socks off."
"Deep mahogony in color this poured a thick fluffy beige head. The nose gave off complex scents of sweet dark fruit, raisins, dark malt, chocolate dipped toffee, yeast, mineral and dark caramel. In the mouth it was medium-bodied with nice concentration yet light-on-its-feet due to the abundance of carbonation. The mouthfeel is soft and round with good richness in the midpalate which adds some dry/bitterness on the finish. Balance is the key work here and it has that in spades!"
"This is obviously one that I was looking forward to. Some friends from Belgium and I used the opportunity to cook some game and drink this from some Westvleteren chalices which had a really nice shape to them. The bottle had been aged 5 years. When we poured it out it was difficult to get a decent head on it. My friend thought perhaps we should have washed the glasses a bit differently. The smell and taste were rich with toffee. It had a nice sweetness to it that gave way to some warmth from the alcohol at the end. A very fine beer, and one that I will look forward to trying fresh."
"This is unique, as all Trappists are. Is it better? Not necessarily. Each Trappists is unique and to be appreciated in its own right. Is this deserving of the title of worlds best? Well... I overheard a server here in Belgium put it best: ""whatever beer you like, then that is a good beer""..."
"A classic - the classic perhaps - and rightfully so. Perfect in most ways a beer can be perfect, if you ever are lucky enough to get your hands on one of these ... well, I'll pay you for it."
"Thanks again to Jason for sharing the wealth!"
"Thanks hoeferweisen for the bottle"
"My hats of to the monks of Trappist Westvleteren."
"My first Westy 12! Dark brown with a cramy tan that disappears into a ring. Huge thanks to Old Style Cub fan! Huge and beautiful aroma of cherries, brown sugar, raisins, figs. Amazing flavor, fresh and strong, yet extremely complex. Has a strong vineous quality. Finish is beautifully smooth and sweet. There's a lot going on in this beer. It's worthy of its top beer titile!"
"Without any doubt, Trappist Westvleteren 12 is one of the finest beers, if not the best, in the world. The aroma and taste of this outstanding trappist quadrupel is exceptional and extraordinary, to say the least. It ages extremely well and its drinkability is truly remarkable."
"Smell is dark fruits, belgian candy sugar and some alcohol. Taste is pretty complex and quite nice. More of the dark fruits in the start, then there is a sense of spice with a roasted, smokey flavor to finish. Velvety smooth on the mouthfeel and easy drinking. Just enough alcohol to notice in each sip. Excellent brew, but #1 beer in the world?"
"I'd have to say this beer was worth the money, and worth the wait. It certainly lives up to the hype."
"At Gollem, Amsterdam, 12-2-07. Dark brown, beige head, lace. Looks perfect in its own chalice, very elegant. My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy. Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate. the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts I've had. No alcohol flavor. The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect. Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while. I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros. It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors. As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced. I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be too rich and alcoholic. St Bernardus is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor. Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus? No way, and I know I'll be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique."
"Aroma starts off with some vanilla and slight chocolate, but really comes to live as the brew warms. Banana's, plums, lots of malty goodness. Taste is caramel, dried fruit some alcohol as she warms. Medium mouthfeel with a bit of stickeyness. Nice carbonation. Definately worthy of the hype."
"Amazing. I could drink this beer forever. And I don't think I'm being biased by the hype."
"Drinks pretty good for the ABV & complexity, maybe a touch hot alcohol-wise, but in line with the style. A super, quad, this is the best quad I've had. The flavor & aromatics are superior for the style. I could happily stock this in my cellar, but I am just as happy with St. Benardus Abt 12 & Pannepot (sic). Now to go get those other 50 or so top 100 beers I must try before I die!"
"D + Notes: An excellent beer, and unfortunate to only have one bottle. It drinks incredibly smooth and soft, with an excellent sense of satisfaction after a glass. It has certainly secured a place among the best of the best, and well worth seeking out to try. Almost frighteningly drinkable, and perhaps the closest thing to perfection that I have had the opportunity to taste."
"I enjoy this beer. Get it. It will last forever!"
"The legendary Westy lives up to its reputation. It's a bit sad to think I won't be able to try this one again for some time, but good old St. Bernardus can keep me company in the meantime."
"Reviewing the beer long rated #1 here brings mixed feelings. Certainly it is an excellent beer, but I also believe there are some better ones out there, and my scores on this and those beers reflect that. Then again, it's all about individual tastes and how they reflect on a common scoring system. Any true conniseur knows there really is no #1 - there is a grouping of world class beers and this one belongs in the upper echelons of that group. 'Nuff said."
"M/D - Creamy, almost chewy and full bodied. The only thing keeping it from beeing a 5.0 for drinkability is the alcohol content."
"Wow! So this is it. The best beer in the world. What do I think? Well, no doubt it's good. Damn good. Worthy of many of its accolades. Personally, I wouldn't crown it the best beer in the world. Honestly it's perhaps only slightly better than other Quads held in very high regard. I mean, very slightly. That being said, I think a slight beefing up in the aroma and a bump in the spice flavor would be a slight improvement. But, those are very minor criticisms. This is damn fine beer that every BA should have the privilege of trying."
"pours a deep ruby color with a stingy brownish head, it looks beautiful in the chalice. the smell hits you out of the bottle, grapes, sweet malt, some alcohol aroma. the taste is absolutely magical, i was worried that it might be an overrated beer, and that its exclusivity breeds its higher ratings. but it really is an amazing beer, i wish the monks would use this great gift of brewing to a more expansive level. the mouthfeel is wonderful, i love thicker/syrupy beers and this one has a wonderul thick mouthfeel, and i could drink it every day all day long for the rest of my life, but i may never have this beer again, i have to make sure to take my time enjoying every drop of this beer. it is a real treat."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. The incredible flavors are easy to consume, and beer is very smooth. The alcohol is hidden very well too. However, the high alcohol limit consumption of tihs beer. All the same, if I could drink this beer with no consequences then I would probably do it all day long. A true work of art and a pleasure. Although I don't think I'll ever end my quest for the perfect beer, this has taken me several steps closer."
"Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised that the hype for this beer is all true! This is the real deal. From top to bottom, this is just excellent. Amazing balance, complexity and smoothness. I don't know if it is the best beer in the world, but it is truly outstanding."
"D = High drinkability, very tasty and warming. A great choice for a relaxing beer in the evening."
""
"This beer pours dark chestnut with a very tightly knit head that soon settles to a thin ring and leaves some spotty lacing. The clarity is better on this beer than the Rochefort, but the head is not as magnificent. Beautifully balanced malt aromas with quite a bit of dark fruit and a hint of spun sugar. The taste is exceptional with beautifuly balanced sweet malt, dark fruit, and spicy hops. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy, maybe a bit more so than the Rochefort and has a tannic edge to it rather than being super creamy. Regardless, this is a pleasure to drink and parse its flavors and if I had another one I'd crack it right now."
"I tried to be skeptical, but this truly is divine beer. I had this back to back with the St. Bernardus 12, but there's not much comparison. The Bernardus is lighter in color and thus has more fruity flavors than chocolate. I love Bernardus, but if Westy 12's were just as available, it'd be my go-to."
"Awesome beer. I wish it wasn't so hard to come by as I would certainly have it on hand regularly. Great treat though. Is it the best in the world? For me so far it has been one of my favorites."
"Overall, this was a great beer. Did it live up to the hype--could it live up to the hype? Hard to say. I would love to have another full glass rather than the portion I had in order to really savor and explore this beer. But I can't say that I was dissappointed, either, because what I did get to sample was awesome."
"D - Overall, this was a good and easy drinking especially for 10% ABV. It was a great drinker but i don't know if it was the hype or what but I wasn't super impressed. This is a good beer that really stands out because it has so much flavor that is all so balanced. Nothing really pops out and it is not what I'd consider a wow flavor beer but it has so much complexity in such a package. Can't wait to get another one if I can."
"D: Like the 8 this is an incredibly drinkable. No hint of the ABV at all. Some of the hyped beers let you down but this one does not. Makes me wish I would I lived in Belgium. Drink this one if you can."
"D- Oye! Amazingly good. This really lived up to the hype. I don't really know what more I could say that hasn't been said by other reviewers."
"11.2 ounce bottle, cap stamped with 30.08.09. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a dark murky brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like dark fruit (plums, raisins), caramel, bananas, pepper, cloves and yeast. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, with the addition of licorice, nuts, chocolate and some booziness too. It seems a different flavor comes out with each sip. Very tasty! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich and a bit syrupy and slick, and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol warming does kick in after a while, but that's not a bad thing. I think this is an excellent beer. I don't think it's worth the price to buy it all the time, but it's definitely worth it to get a couple bottles just to try it because it's not easy to get. I wasn't disappointed, that's for sure!"
"Vinous with a slightly roasted yeasty quality overall makes for a sublime taste experience."
" I simply didn't want to see the end of this stuff, I sipped slowly and it still disapeared quicker than I had wanted. This is a masterpiece of brewing."
"D- Yum! Perhaps I've been bamboozled by the hype and reputation, but that was one awesome beer. 10.2%? Who woulda thunk it?"
"Very well made beer."
"Poured a beautiful deep rich brown with a huge white slightly tan head that just does not want to recede. Smells of sharp citrus hops. First taste is unbelievably smooth, balanced, hoppy, and slightly bitter. Did the Monks who brewed this take a vow of celibacy? I'm glad they did. The 10.2% ABV is very well hidden. This puppy lives up to its hype."
"Finally! Sampled this fine beer with a friend last night. Poured into my chimay goblet. Poured a hazy brownish with red hues. Light cream colored head with good retention. Looks a bit murky. Smells are tough to describe. I get bready, yeasty, musty. Not old musty, but almost stale. Aromas get better as beer warms. Taste is wow! This is really 12%? I get a nice malty kidk right off the bat with tons of different flavors around my mouth. i swear I feel taste buds going crazy on the roof of my mouth even! Vanilla, clove, bready flavors are abundant. I want to savor this beer, but it really is too good and too easy to drink. Good thing I have 3 more!"
"I wouldn't put this one necessarily above some other trappist beers that I've had, but the accessibility makes this the rare treat. The mere fact that the quanities and availability are limited, makes me not at all surprised this is 'the' BA favorite."
"11.2 oz. bottle ""Belgian-poured"" into a tulip glass by the very knowledgeable bartender. Murky, brown appearance with a thick tan head that dissipates slowly leaving lacing. Aroma of dates, prunes, caramel and malts. Very complex flavor including hints of prunes, brown sugar, hazelnut and malt. Finishes slightly sweet. Served at room temperature, it could have used to been cooled slightly (the bottle indicated 54-58 degrees F). Heavy mouthfeel, meant for sipping. Good drinkability regardless, but at $12 a bottle it is unlikely that I'll be getting this very often. I would echo the sentiments that this is not the ""Best Beer in the World"" but that is quite an expectation to live up to."
"Drinkability: Drinkable beer, moreso than other strong belgium beers I have tried. Great beer but it is not the ""Best in the world"""
"Had the honor of sampling this popular item the other night as I was guided through my first beer brewing experience by a very generous friend who shared his last bottle of this liquid gold. Poured a rich chestnut-brown w/ruby-amber edges where light permeated through. Head thin and light beige. The aroma was complex, but dominated by chocolate character and various toasted malts, with lighter scents of a bouquet of spices and light herbs, light esters, and warming alcohol. The taste was exceptional--chocolate malt, molasses and candy sugar, an exotic blend of rich spices, and a strong finish of cocoa and alcohol rounded out by bitter hops. There was also an inexplicable bite at the back of the midpalate that was actually quite pleasant, but I don't know what it was. Very light carbonation, rich body that consistently delivers throughout the palate, and harmonious balance between a very dry texture and the sweet and spice flavors forge a powerful result."
"Is this a world class beer? Absolutely. Is it the best thing I've ever tasted? I certainly enjoyed it a great deal, but I'm afraid the answer is no, there are other things more pleasing to my palate. But who cares about the hype, it's a lovely drink and I'm pleased as punch, or I guess pleased as really good beer, to be drinking it. Thanks to pimpp for the inadvertent birthday present"
"Sampling same batch as of 2-27-10(#3 of 4): Nose is complex as it was two years ago - bananas, dark fruits dominate. Taste is more wine like, detecting less of the banana yeast notes and getting more hints of red wine and hints of chocolate. It is sweeter but definitely not cloying. The mouthfeel is still velvety smooth and still perfectly drinkable - no alcohol detected."
"If you see this available where you are, grab it without hesitation. I recommend going to Belgium, though and experiencing it in its homeland (plus there's about 1000 other breweries to try beers from over there)."
"d: I am convinced I could drink a case of this beer and notice something new with each bottle. A joy to drink. I am not the biggest quad guy, more a function of income than preference. But despite my naivete, I can't help but notice the excellence of this brew. Never have I had the pleasure of a beer with half as much complexity. This beer receives a lot of love on this site. This review will not alter that trend. It is a tremendous offering, the definition of what a quad should be. Oh yeah and at 10.2% it sure goes down easy."
"Flavor is rich, and so smooth and unified. Alcohol is almost completely concealed. A wonderfully tasty treat."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer, I have drank it on several occasions with some other world class beers to compare it to. I have a tough time saying its the best beer I have ever had, but have just as difficult time saying it isn't. I think it deserves a perfect score, I can't imagine a single thing here you could improve on."
"D - I could go on and on about this beer. I had really high expectations for it (how could you not?), and it completely delivered. To my surprise, it exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say, I will constantly be looking to get my hands on more of these..."
"This is the best beer I have ever had hands down. It lived up to it's reputation as world's greatest. I have a few more cellared, but will save them until a special occasion. It was truly an honor to drink this beer!"
"D-A true brain teaser of a beer...will challange the most adept beer taster. Not my ideal beer but it is SO flavourful and interesting that alone makes it very good."
"Nice white stabile head. Dark brown colour. Lower carbonation. Aromas of fruits (cherry), buttery malts. Very sweet smelling overall. Flavours of sweet bread, smooth malts, dried fruits (raisins) and roasted elements all perfectly balanced. Full bodied with an oily texture. Finished crisp, with some bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. Highly recommended and exceptionally enjoyable."
"Really a solid wonderful beer, and it didn't disappoint."
"I tasted this together with St. Bernardus abt 12, and though similar, it beat it hands down."
"D- I wanted to dislike this beer, I really really did. I told myself I would rate it like any other and try to play down the hype but it just didn't work. The only way I can describe how good this one goes down is the spicy, warming sharpness of the finish of a good big red wine. Because of the price I won't actively seek this one out again but if i'm ever in europe and I see one you can bet that's what i'll be drinking. I usually dislike quads but this one seemed so laid back, it was a delight."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy purplish-brown color with a thick, almond head. Strong lacing. Aroma is fruity (raisins, perhaps) with a nice bit of the Belgian yeast to it. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Flavor is very complex. It's hard to put a finger on it. There's some caramel, apricot, alcohol, and some toffee to it. Maybe not the best beer I've ever had, but it's right up there."
"I think it is hard to give a beer a 5 on this when you could only handle drinking one or two at a time in one night. This is for sure the best quadrupel ever! But My heart still remains a hophead. I thank the beer gods for this chance to try this outstanding brew. And thanks to Zack for sharing this beer with me!"
"Thick and silky, but very drinkable. Perfect carbonation. This is a fantastic example of the style and one of the best beers made."
"this is everything it's advertised to be."
"D: I don't typically like Belgians too much but the 8 and 12 are definitely worthy. I won't call this my favorite beer but I'd never argue with someone for saying it's theirs."
"St. Bernardus Abt 12 or Trappist Achel Extra..."
"d - what a wonderful sipper, goes down easily and one could get carried away with this if not careful."
"This beer surpassed any expectations I had, high as they were. The discussions about the beer started strong, but in the end we were simply too distracted by the deliciousness of this beverage to talk. Finished it pretty quickly, as each tasted prompted another. Had there been another bottle in our refrigerator, I'm sure it would not be there this morning. It may be time to start planning that trip to visit the monks."
"D--Well, what can you say, it is Westvletaren. Unfortunately, you are about as likely to win the lottery than to have this beer at your disposal. $450 a case?? That makes it pretty tough. IF I could have this beer regularly, I would. Though I have to say it will definitely hit you with its whopping ABV. A question any Belgian fan needs to ask is how does this brew compare to its most celebrated cousins, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus ABT 12? It holds up quite nicely. Know this, this is the best beer in the world, hands down. I dont know what is more depressing, that the Pats will likely win today or that my goblet is almost gone."
"This is perfection."
"West 12 trumps any Belgian I have ever had. Honored to be one of the rare few who has had the opportunity to have it pass through my lips. Got 5 more bottles, so i'm dying to see what will await me in two to three years when I open the next bottle. I can only imagine the taste after it's been cellared a few years."
"Thanks Maxskip!"
"Update: Oh god, this stuff is so good. I am praying for forgiveness as I buy all I can get."
"This beer was everything people have said it would be. Tasted much like other Trappist beers but more well rounded and smooth."
"Pours a brown/amber color with slight haze and ruby highlights. The nose is very fruity with some sour tones maybe cherry, and some spice. Smell almost champagnish (slightly kindof maybe a little) Nice white/off white head dissipates fairly fast. Wow!! intense dark fruit flavors. plums, raisins, figs, dates, black cherry wowwwowowowow!! Awesome spice and smoothness! damn smooth! I see what all the hype is about, this beer is great. The finish is smooth as hell and the mouthfeel is bomb. Drinkability is very dangerous as the alcohol on the finish is about as minimal as you can get with a quad, but still a great warming effect in the stomach. Awesome beer!!! Get it if you can. props to the monks."
"Overall- From the look, to the smell, to the taste, to the feel, just a bad ass beer. I see what the fuss is about and I am glad to try it, and also glad to try more. I feel that this particular beer is a little young, and will only get better with age."
"Overall this was a great beer and surely one of the best on the planet. I don't think I would even call it my favorite and if I never get to try another again I'm glad I got one shot and giving it a try"
"D- This beer could be paired with anything, or be enjoyed as an apperatif. This is an incredibly versatile beer. My only regret is not cellaring it for longer."
"I've been waiting to review this beer for a while (2 years since my first notes). I've tried 3 bottles from 3 locations - I guess I just don't like this beer as much as a lot of other beers!"
"D: Will I find myself craving this beer at many different occasions? Yes. However, some points taken off due to its rarity and inability to be a session beer"
"D- I like this beer a lot. I obviously won't be having it often but I am happy to have the chance to try it. This was the last beer of a Trappist tasting so my notes were light even though this was great."
"Thanks again to Aaron for letting me try this brew, one of the FEW ""top 100"" that i havent thought was overrated. Now to try and find a westy 8 to try :)"
"what a wonderful beer this is. superbly drinkable. i'm glad i have a few more of these laying around."
"I may, if pressed, have some that are more favorite. The only thing that keeps me from buying this all the time is the price. $10 for one bottle is not a frequent visitor to my shelf."
"Overall, a great beer, not sure if worth the hype, but certainly great. It's likely due to my lack of beer tasting experience. It actually got me a little lightheaded. Yes."
"Tastes of dark fruit, with a series malt backbone, without being cloying. It poured a dark brown with a light tan head. Can't wait to try again."
"This beer poured a dark brown with some amber hues. The head was tan with very nice lacing. The aroma is caramel with Belgian candy noticeable - alcohol is also perceptible. The taste is heavily malty with caramel and candy notes quite evident. The mouthfeel is full with a carbonation bite on the tongue  very delightful. This is a compelling beer that is quite elegant."
" Yummy taste. SPicy cinnamon and heavy raison flavor. Very complex taste progression. SUbtler on the caramel than the nose implies, which I appreciated. SHockingly smooth for such a rich full-bodied beer. Just a tinge of fusels. This beer is like a grandfather. It has an important message to impart and is full of wisdom , but you have to be listening closely, and selflessly. The brothers truly put a lot of love into this beer. I don't believe despite the brilliance of this beer that everyone would really get the point, but those who do are blessed. A gem."
"The beer poured a deep brown, almost black color with a medium thickness tan head that lasted for a few minutes and gave way to nice ring around the end but the lacing doesn't hold up well. The nose is pretty damn imressive. There are some fruit notes, dates, plums and a nice chocolately character. The taste is very impressive as well. The malty chocolate notes are the first thing that takes my taste buds on a ride along with some of the deep fruit notes I got in the aroma as well. The carbonation is rather full and overall makes for a full bodied beer. I could not say for sure whether this is the best beer in the world but it is a pretty damn good beer and well worth a try if you can get it for a reasonable price."
"Overall I prefer St. Bernardus 12 over this beer. The slightly thicker mouthfeel gives this beer slightly less drinkability than SB12."
"I've been waiting all day to drink this beer, but waited until the snowball fights with my daughter and cocoa and shoveling were done. It was well worth the wait. And as hard as it is to get, it will be worth the wait until my next Westvleteren 12. But believe me, there will be a next one."
"I think the ""rarity"" of this artifically heightens it's overall score."
"As far as the talk and excitement about the beer, Westy 12 is worth it, but I would not pay forty dollars a bottle for it at a bar but twenty bucks or so seems okay to spend from time to time, I highly recommend it even if you have to go through the hassle of getting from someone in Belgium because otherwise people are going to have some from trades or vacations where they brought some of this back, it is definitely a rare and highly demanded beer, yes this one was noticeably better than St. Bernardus 12 in my opinion, I am happy I got to try such a great beer and hope all of you some time soon"
"Overall- A good cold evening or desert beer!"
"Yeah, it's pricey but I'd go for another. Thanks eclectic for this via trade!"
"Not too long ago, in my haul from CrackedKettle's online beer sales, I have a Westvleteren 12 from 1998 and the date on the cap is for the year 2001. (I am not sure if it shld be 1997 instead) So I had a contemporary Westy 12 2 days ago and I clearly recall the taste as well as the full experience and gratification level; let's see how this one does. It is interesting to note that in 1998 (when I was in middle school), Westvleteren 12 is 11 ABV as opposed to the 10.2 ABV that it is today; it was also 10.6 ABV at a certain point in time. Man this baby is crowned tight; it took some effort to get it off and immediately a vinous grassy aroma can be can be detected at the opening of the bottle; some dark fruits but not really impressive here. I poured it out into my old Abdij St Sixtus oversized wine glass and a one finger thick head developed over a dark amber brown liquid below. What surprised me was the way this head grew to a 2 finger thick head which persisted for a while. the head was creamy and bubbly but more bubbly and I prefered the creamier head on the contemporary Westvleteren. The smell was not very strong but the vinous part of it was clear; there was this light yeasty bready smell with a little bit of fruits underneath and I think I sense a dash of malts but in general the smell was not fantastic. Moving on to the taste, the nutty/almondy goodness from the contemporary Westy was still present though the intensity probably halved. Other than the nutty entry, there was a well pronounced vinous taste of aged beers that was well within expectation along with the a nice maltiness which followed behind. Sweetness was clear but it was not a ""thick"" sweetness like in the contemporary Westvleteren; it became a more mellow sweetness. The fruitiness was also more subtle and mellow on this one; I can raisins, grapes and some plums which were kind of buried under the malts but stil detectable along with the sweetness. The finish was a pleasant nutty/almondy dryness with nice vinous aromas, maltiness and plums on the nose. The maltiness and the fruitiness towards the finish was a very pleasant part of the taste that somewhat reminds me of the greatly aged 1985-1988 La Trappe Dubbel that I had which was so called one of the best aged beer I ever had thus far; up there with the Special 6. On the whole I still prefer the taste of the contemporary Westvleteren though I prefer this one's finish. It was clearly a very much mellowed down taste which had it's unique strengths. The after taste was flooded with malts, brown sugar sweetness and dark fruits starting with plums and moving on to raisins and grapes after a while. The mouthfeel on this was about medium bodied; clearly the aging compromises on the thickness and the creaminess as well. It was still slightly creamy to drink and the carbonation was clearly going low but still pretty sufficient. 11 ABV seems deceivingly smooth and light and I almost thought this was a 7 or 8 ABV if I did not know from the start that it is 11 ABV. Again I prefer the mouthfeel of the contemporary Westvleteren 12. Let's now break things down further, the smell was largey vinous aromas which was obviously different from the contemporary's intensely fruity and sweet smell. Taste was a classic mellowed down version which was generally not as good except for the slightly pre-finish and finish which was in a greatness realm of it's own.Mouthfeel lost thickness, richness and creaminess as well as some carbonation over time but surprisingly, the nuttiness was still there. Very nice and I can really appreciate it but I still prefer the contemporary Westy to this particular bottle of 1998 Vintage; I mean aging really produces different results... We all know that. Cheers for the season folks! :)Ok, I am v.slightly intoxicated.. maybe it is my lethargy and lack of food... and... 11 ABV heh... In case I forget my individually ratings (BA disabled reviews till Sunday) Taste: 5, Appearance: 4.5, Smell 4.0, Drinkability: 5, Mouthfeel: 4.5 (Overall: 4.65 I believe...)"
"Not my favorite beer, but it's up there."
"This is one tasty brew, but, ya know what? The price is too high unless youre in Belgium drinking from the local café. But this is to be experienced in your lifetime."
"Huge thanks go to tpd975 for getting me this bottle!!"
"Murky ruddy brown color. This has lost some carbonation, but it looks decent. Very fruit-forward nose with fairly pleasant oxidation, smells decent. Palate is very oxidized, a little cardboardy. Earthy fruit is also prevalent. Carbonation is a bit low at this point. Pretty good, but I'd take a fresh bottle over this."
"This beer has been hyped as much as Obama/Clinton, but when you drink it you realize that it's just a beer. A very good beer, but just a beer."
"It has been a great experience in reviewing all three Westvleterens within 24 hrs. Although it is a very good beer, Rochefort 10 is just as good, easier to get and more economical, plain and simple."
"Overall, this is one of the best Quads I have ever had. I did this as a side by side with the Rochfort 10 and prefered the Westy. That said I can get a Rochefort all the time. Westy is much more difficult. Yes there is a bit of hype to this beer, but it is a great for a reason."
"Overall, the drinkability was not bad. ProbabIy wont be seeking it out again. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"Tastes like heaven will ( if I make it). The alcohol is almost completely hidden, has notes of raisins, plums, sweet malt, spices and yeast. No wonder this is rated so highly. Believe the hype."
"Notes: I am very happy that my stash has not been tarnished by my less-than ideal storage conditions. Compared to the many that I drank last year in Belgium, the beer has retained many of its great characteristics while mellowing out in the alcohol slightly. I would say that it has lived up to the hype that is associated with it... this is for a damn good reason. I hope this beer always maintains the quality and doesn't sacrifice this for quantity. Proost."
"Review translated from french (11-15-08)."
"Okay, I'm retired. No more beers for me. What's the point?"
"Bottom line: Yeah, I spent a few bucks to get my bottles of Westvletern 12(and 8) and I could have bought lots of other beers for the cost but, I feel that the money was spent well. I've had other quadrupels before and I liked them. I'm partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that I've had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. It's because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as ""easily"" available as other examples of the style, I'd buy it by the case."
"Expensive, but a must."
"I could make a decent session of this beer."
"Heavily vinous, and clearly a top-notch beer. I would definitely pay a crazy price for another bottle. There's more here than just one tasting can reveal."
"Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and slightly above the Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). I'm not sure if it's worth $20 if you don't get it in Belgium due beers of similar quality being available more readily and for much cheaper. Definitely a beer you have to try though."
"11.10.09 stamped on the cap. I've had these for a year or so as part of a wonderful gift from a 12 pack given to me. Poured at ~55F into my Westvleteren chalice. Strong tan head, decent retention, solid lacing. Nose has notes of rasin, figs and dates, perhaps plum. Mouthfeel is silky and spicy. Taste is similar to the nose, just more apparent in the depths of a profound flavor. This is sure making my Tuesday night something special. Truly one of the world's best offerings for a ""commercial"" beer, although I'm not sure this is the epitiome of a commercial offering. As far as drinkability goes, should we even discuss this? This beer is closest to the St Bernardus Abt 12, but is much cleaner, deeper and pure. Truly the best quadrupel offering by a long shot. I'd offer a longer diatribe about the complexities and beauty of this beer, but if you dont get it already, there is nothing my words can do."
"This is one big complex beer that really needs time to be consumed it is always fun to experience the change temperature can make in a these type of beers. If you ever have the pleasure of drinking this do not make the mistake of drinking it too fast or too cold it must be consumed slowly to let it warm up and express it's full potential. Great for the style and a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I finally had a chance to try this but, to be honest, I prefer the Rochefort 10; this one is just a bit too boozy for my taste"
"I'd love the chance to try one that's aged a bit!"
"Pours a dark chesnut brown with a frothy thin off-white head that dies down to a mystical layer that floats on top the entire time. Lacing is spotty all over the sides of the glass. Smell is so complex. Combination of yeasty goodness, dark fruits (fig, cherry, raisin, dates, plum), sweet caramel malt, sugary vanilla, thick honey, and fresh flowers. I can't think of a single beer that even compares to this one in terms of smell. Taste starts off with a bready yeast which is then bitch slapped by a whole lot of sweet goodness. Almost tastes like a caramel apple to me as lame as that sounds, but think about it when you take a sip next time. Aftertaste is a bit spicey, but perfect in the sense. Mouthfeel is full, complex, and warming with the perfect amount of carbonation. A bit of burning alcohol in the throat as it slides down, but the alcohol has to be somewhere with a 10.2% abv. beer. Hype? What hype!?...this beer clearly delivers."
"Oh, it's so sad to see it go. Who knows if I'll ever have the opportunity again. I'm just at a loss for words trying to describe this beer anymore. Believe the hype. And if you have a chance to drink this, DO IT."
"The smell was a rich aroma of fresh dates. Full, rich taste in the mouth with balanced bitterness. The finish was elegant and satisfying and not overpowering in the least despite the alcohol content. The mouthfeel was really exceptional and the finish satisfying, long and lingering. The subtle carbonation stayed for the duration of the tasting, even while there was less than a half inch left in the glass. This was truly a delightful taste experience, many thanks for this one."
"D - A great quadruple. Simply the best. I could drink it night after night. However, living 3,000 miles from the source makes the price per unit of enjoyment a bit out of my everyday range. Hence, it is my special treat. When I want to go to a happy place this is the beer for me."
"Pours a very dark brown. Big fluffy head that dissipates somewhat quick. Silky white lacing. Looks delicious. Too many smells to distinguish. Fig, caramel, raison, plumb, jam, malt, honey, tea, spices and mild alcohol. Flavors are abundant as well. It tastes of all that the smell indicates and it is an unreal flavor experience. The warming from the alcohol is the only indication that it exists. A spicy semi dry finish. The drinkability is unreal for any beer, especially for this type and abv. Lives up to the hype through and through. A unique experience that should be on every BA's list."
"D - A great nuanced ale - lives up to the hype."
"Drinkability is very good considering the strength"
"F*CKING DELICIOUS! Well worth the extravagant amount of money spent on it. It seriously tasted like an explosion of flavour in my mouth. I would recommend this to anyone who is a serious beer drinker and especially anyone who likes belgian style ales. This is the best of trappist market. The best the world has to offer."
"This was my first, and more than likely last, experience with Westy 12. As good as it was there are other more accessible Quads (St. Bernardus 12, Trappistes Rochefort 10) just as good that don't break the bank like this does. One of those ""At least now I can say I tried it"" beers. Now onto the Dark Lord!!"
"D: Damn. An amazingly superb beer that is worth the hype. This one easily makes my top 3."
"Thanks again to my fellow (anonymous) B-A for sharing this amazing and understandably highly-sought-after beer. Dude, you are excellent."
"Mouthfeel is very warm because of the high ABV. Carbonation is very filling too."
"D: High. If only this were not one of the hardest beers to obtain in the world, I would have this available to me on a regular basis. Looks like I just have to go back to Belgium!"
"Many thanks to HardTarget for graciously sharing this rare example."
"Got as a gift from my best friend who ordered from BelgianShop.com. Poured from a 33cl bottle with a best by date of Oct '09 into my NBB snifter. The color was an reddish brown and had a ton of yeast bits. It had a very small beige head that quickly dissipated. No film, collar or lacing. I thought I had let it warm enough but was just getting to temp when I opened it so the initial aroma was good but not great. After it got to temp (yes I used a cooking thermometer as my wife chuckled at me - screw it, good beer deserves to be treated with respect), the aroma really developed and was exceptional. Was strong on raisins and plum with a sweetness surrounding it all. Could smell the alcohol but it wasn't overpowering so no problem. The taste was really good but didn't live up to the aroma or the hype. It was exceptionally smooth for a quad but just didn't blow me away. I enjoyed it but I've had better quads taste-wise. The mouthfeel was also really good - creamy and smooth. While not the best taste for a quad it was definitely extremely drinkable for a quad - very smooth. I'm going to have to get some more and make sure this sample was up to snuff ;-) Overall, a great beer that you definitely need to try....but it's overhyped in my opinion due to the rareness of it. Get a bottle if you can but don't give the arm and leg for it - just one of em. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"D- I thought it was a decent beer but no way #1. I think it is quite a lot over hyped. I did this in a blind tasting with St. Bernys 12 and I choose that over this hands down."
"drinkability: she's a sipper"
"I've had many quads before. Some of my favorate being: Kasteelbier Brune, Trappistes Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus Abt 12 60th Anniversary. Somehow, this is more than just a good quad this is a good total beer. I'm still savoring it."
"As for this being the best beer in the world; that remains to be seen. But as for Quadrupels, there is no comparison."
"As one would expect this beer has a mouthfeel smoother than velvet. The carbonation is incredibly fine. Supremely drinkable."
"I could drink 2034578349 more of these if I didn't get so buzzed up off just one :)."
"Overall: This one took me back to my vacation in Belgium. Touring the Abbey's eating cheese, mingling, a snap shot of pure happiness in life. This $12 bottle of beer helped me to think back and relive one of the greatest experiences in life. Is it to late to step away from life and check into Westvleteren to devote my life to beer? Those Monks know what they are doing and they do it oh so well."
"An easily drinkable beer, but definitely something to be savored, not rushed. I look forward to the next chance I get to enjoy this incredible beer. Hopefully that chance may come soon!"
"Opened this with a friend a fellow beer lover. 5 months before best of date. Cap off and into a chimay glass. Mmm tastes like hype. A brown body with red rimmed highlights and a decent white head of small bubbles. The smell is close to unappealing to me my friend really likes it but to me the alcohol pops out and there is a cooked raisin smell that sends this sideways. The taste is decent it has depth of flavor and the yeast adds some nice edges of phenol with lots of dried fruit and some caramel with even a touch of more mellow dark malt and then the alcohol comes through warming all it touches. Good mouthfeel full but not too dense. Something to have once in a while when you can find it but not my favorite, shrug, once again this is mostly hype."
"5.0 - Drinkability- Despite all the complexities of this beer, I could easily guzzle this in a heartbeat, but I never would because I know it's too hard to get and every sip should be savored. I enjoyed this beer by itself, but I can only imagine what it would be like paired with a simply, yet delicious monk-like meal- I was thinking just simple rice at the time of drinking. Not sure why... I've got 5 bottles left of 3 different vintages... I am hooked and want more."
"This beer lives up to the hype - of course I could drink tons of these. Too bad I may never get to Belgium."
"D - Very outstanding beer, but not my favorite quad"
"D: An excellent beer, no doubt. Worth the hype, if not the crazy lengths some people go to to obtain the #1-ranked beer in the world. Incredibly complex, fantastic aroma, nice experience overall. Can't wait for the next occasion to have another..."
"I was overly excited when a buddy of mine bought a case of this and we were to have it for our final beer club beer #500. This beer poured a dark amber haze with a sizeable head. Smelled slightly sweet with a little spice and apple juice notes. Starts off with spiced apple juice, some sweet brown sugar flavors, dark dried fruit flavors, a little more spice and hints of lemon at the end of every few sips. More alcohol warmth than I would have liked. It overpowered some of the flavors and stood out more as the beer warmed. A very full flavored beer but not as good as I was expecting. In fact I favor several quads and trippels over this brew. It was worth the money to say you have had one, but I would never pay the high price to have this beer again. The rarity gives this beer extremely too much credit."
"Overall, the nose does not do it justice. It tastes like mystery and is so beautifully balanced throughout, it is dangerously drinkable for a quad. Godliness in a bottle."
"Enticing, sweetish aroma. Color is dark, murky brown. Pours with a big, white head. Sweet malt flavor up front closely followed by a balancing hit of bitterness. Rich complex malt, hop bitterness and complex fruit flavors dance in my mouth. The attack on my tastebuds is incredible. This beer has a long lingering finish that just won't quit. There's also a touch of alcohol warmth to the finish. I love the balance of this beer. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Delicious! I wish I had more."
"Pours a nice small head that falls into a thin layer with a great lacing that's very strong. Color is dark brown almost red. The smell is spiced with clove, cinnamin, brown sugar with a backround of Belgian Candy sugar. There's also dark fruit like plum. Taste is slightly sweet with dark fruit and spices. Mouthfeel is a little hot still. Mouthfeel is smooth, just a little hot. Overall this is a nice beer to have once in a while. I would like to cellar more and get different vintages."
"This beer is a joy to drink, though it was nothing like what I expected. I guess I sort of expected a Belgium version of the Thomas Hardy or JW Lee, but it was nothing like that. This beer is incredibly light on it's feet for such a big beer, and was way too easy to drink. It finishes with a whisper, a very smooth, satisfying end to a nearly flawless beer. Most excellent."
"In short - best quadrupel I have ever had, though that might only get it into my top 15 or so beers."
"Drinkability: Well-hidden alcohol and a divinely complex flavor profile? Drink on!"
"I got this beer and was so excited to try it due to the many good things that have been said about it. After drinking this I realized that it was one of the most complex and tasty beers I have ever had. It was like velvet, but abrasive. Sweet but dry. I could go on and on, but never the less, remarkable. I know now what everyone has been talking about. A rare beer, but worth every drop."
"Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect with all the hype, but this is one fine beer. Certainly the best Belgian I've had. I don't think I'll be trying this again anytime soon due to the trouble/cost involved with getting one, but it's definitely one of the best."
"My sweet lord! I've glimpsed divinity as interpreted by the hands of the monks at St. Sixtus. And savored by me - ahem. This sample was poured into a belgian beer glass with a small lite tan head. Only a little lace. Color is a slightly hazy brown with hints of walnut and mahogoney. Sensuously aromatic. Lots of levels of dark fruit, berries, desserts, candies. Specifically chocolates, pastries, malt, blackberries, cherrys, and many others that just goes on and on. Some yeastiness. Very balanced despite its rich fullness. Could dwell on this endlessly so much going on. Velvety texture, reminds me of what a mink jock must be like. I have been in the presense of divinity and drank it in."
"A true masterpiece!"
"very easy to drink, but i would definitely stave off from drinking 2 in one night. better to save it for another joyous occasion."
"As I said above, this beer, as a gift, might force me to rate it above its true worth. I worried about that a bit, but Westy 12 lives up to all of the hype. A marvel of brewing. Plus, it adds to the pride of being Catholic just a bit more!"
"Again, this is an awesome beer. I encourage you to try it. But I was expecting it to be far and away the best."
"EDIT: I recently found out that the date on the cap is a freshness date, marked for three years after the date of bottling. So this was vintage 2000. Wow. It was probably madeirized, but whatever it was, it was fantastic."
"D - This really was everything I wanted it to be, and lives up to its rep. By far the best belgian I have had, it is just on another level. The aromas and flavors were so unique. This really just needs to be tried as it is really hard to describe it. Fantastic brew."
"The beer pours from the bottle a mahogany color that is slightly less intense than say a Rocheforte 10. Nice thick head that leaves lacing on the glass. Flavor is of raisins, caramal, malts, maple syrup in the background, and a alcohol bite that is well within line for the high alcohol. It has a long finish, a sustain like a Gibson Les Paul, yeah this beer goes to eleven."
"Bottle carried back from the monastery and cellared for 1 1/2 years. Pours a completely opaque, very dark brown with a dense, rocky head that leaves nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells of candied fruits, plums and raisins with a orange note in the background and a dusky, rich aroma throughout. Taste? A 5 doesn't do it justice. Fruits up front, mellowing into an incredibly smooth malt, followed by nice tannins and then a sharp but mellow aftertaste. It has a nice warming alcohol finish but nothing harsh anywhere in this beer. The mouthfeel is oily and chewy, dense and spectacular. The drinkability is only limited by the availability. We bought a case of this in Belgium and went through it like shit through my dog after he's gotten into the trash. I hate to just jump on the bandwagon but this really does live up to its reputation. This is quite possibly the best beer I've ever had and is just a testament to what brewing can be. Hallelujah!"
"Bought a 4 pack at the Kulminator. Poured a dark brown with a nice thick head. Spicy, malty aroma with hints of sweetness. Slight sweet and malty flavor also. I honestly thought this would be better than it was. Don't get me wrong this was an awesome beer, but I guess with all the hype I thought it would be much better."
"Ok... The westy poured out a soft dark velvety brown with a light caramel colored frothy head, sticky lacing slides down the sides. The nose offers deep wood notes, prune, chocolate, caramel, sweet toffee, cherry, maple syrup, mollasses, and lots of other sticky sweet flavors. The taste starts off with all of those sticky sweet notes, mostly maple syrup, caramel, sticky bun, then goes sharp for a moment before descending into chocolate, some anise, a little wood, and some faint orange? Wow. The mouthfeel is clean and prickly, finishing super clean, not cloying at all in any way. Immensely and dangerously drinkable."
"D: This is a good end of the night, sip for an hour and a half kind of beer. Very complicated..."
"Decided that the ol' Westy 12 was worthy of my 500th beer review. 330 mL bottle which I found at the Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville over a year ago - 14/9/07 ink-jet printed on the cap. It pours a deep brownish/red that is crimson in the light, but I didn't decant carefully enough as there is a lot of yeast in suspension. It has light carbonation and a half-inch head that leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is quite nice, vinous and sweet, with ripe grapes and raspberries, figs, apples, pine?, cookie batter?, and doughy yeast. It tastes of sweet and toasted, lightly smoky malts, green hops, a medium bitterness, melon, green apple, raspberry, strawberry?, a flash of banana, a light herbal quality, Belgian yeast, and very light oxidation in the form of paper. It has light, smooth carbonation on the palate, with a medium, drying body that becomes more full and leaves a medium to long finish. It is both immensely drinkable and a very nice ale, but my bottle was a bit past its prime. I would love to taste a fresh one purchased directly from the abbey - I imagine that is a divine experience. Best beer in the world? Perhaps not, but it's a beautifully crafted Trappist that is worth at least half of the hype that surrounds it."
"While this is a damn fine beer, this is not the beer to end all other beers. It is very good, well crafted, and delicate in its approach, but it is not deserving of the incredible hype it gets. In this country, we are blessed to have a wide selection of great belgian style beers. St. Bernardus Abt. 12, Rochefort 10, Kasteel, and Gouden Carolus Grand Cru are all also excellent beers that are similar to the famous ""westy", but they don't have the huge hype associated with them. This is every bit as good as those other beers, but I can't say for sure if it's ""better"". I'd say that it is worth all the praise for being as good as it is, but it's not worth the hype and longing for it. I can now see why the brothers decided to stop selling it here. If you can get it, try it.... but it's not worth trading your first born for. Be happy with what we have here."
"Just when you thought you could not find a better beer than luck finds it's way to your cellar. The deep color, and a somewhat translucent brown-red. Love the Belgian scent. Ripe raisins and sugar plums. If subtle is grand then here is the Marshall. A fine long finish, with a beautiful blend of harmonic complexity. The yeast is just a thing of perfection ! A great beer that is hard to find but worth the effort."
"Drinkability: This beer did not disappoint, start to finish, it lived up to the hype. I wish getting another one would be a little easier."
"In case you couldn't figure it out from the rest of the review, the drinkability is extremely high. I'm gonna have to start calling in all my favors from friends with belgian contacts."
"From a well kept bottle of 4 years age. Poured a dark cola brown, and had little head or aroma. Slight aroma of dark fruit and maple, and flavor was similar. No oxidative notes, or any hint of staleness/ skunkiness etc. so I am sure this beer was well kept. I just don't get what the big deal is. this is my second try from a different batch a couple years after I had my first one, and the impression it has on me is consistent. Of course I did like the mouthfeel and finish that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but these were not very enchanting or beguiling - just vaguely pleasant. I suspect people just hype it up in their minds because it is so rare, and expensive. Highly coveted due to to its scarcity. Sorry if you are an offended devotee, but the emperor wears no clothes on this one. Someone said they are better fresh - I suppose I should try that before the final judgement."
"This is a good beer, a great beer perhaps, but it can't hold a candle to the hype that has been built around it. IMHO the Westvletere 8 is a better beer. I'm glad that I've now experienced the so called ""nirvana"" of beer even if I did spend a small fortune to get my hands on it."
"D - So very easy to drink, smooth and complex, warming alcohol flavour carries this beer down with ease. Utterly hard to falt truly without a doubt one of the best beers in the world."
"D - Very few crafted beers make me want to slam them all the way through. Usually I would want to sip them and enjoy the flavor with the occasional mouth slug to accomodate the medium cooked mustard cheese burger. This Westvleteren 12 is really hard to leave alone. Its a trappist that you could easily call a session beer IF you could get over the rareness and your liver can hack the alcohol % since it is hidden well from the senses after a year of aging. The young Westy 12 will make you sip it. Its invasive and still tastes great but the aged one was not asking me to use caution. It was mellowed out and finally the whole idea comes together for, easily, the finest quad on the planet."
"Two days earlier I tasted the Westvleteren 8 which I found to be an equally impressive, although a creamier brew. On a very special night sometime soon, I would like to try them back to back or do a blindfold test with a Rochefort 10 in the mix... I think I'll know the Westy 12 !!"
"Obviously had huge expectations for this one but I put the objective goggles on and just treated it like any other beer. Poured deep ruby, crystal shiny in the glass but 1/2"" of yeasties in the bottle. Lots of grape wine in the nose, sweet fruity, not dominant. Very nice taste, more like a wine than a beer, lots of heavy fruity grape notes. Tight carbonation and dense mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the end. I could drink this all night long but, seriously, it's not that much better than Trappistes Rochefort 10. If I can get another one I'll do a blind side by side with the 10. Very good but not the best beer in the world."
"One sip is enough for me to believe the hype. This one is a 5 plain and simple, I'm just going to enjoy the rest of this now..."
"I don't just hand out good ratings for beers, and selectively review beers. This one is all that its reputation says it is, some of the best beer in the world. So smooth, so good, so very very good. I'm happy I have more of these, and will have to work on getting some more. I just can't live without this beer (elixer) now. Find it, Get it, Be thankful you did."
"330ml bottle with the best by date of 30.08.09 printed on the yellow cap. This is my first time having this particular beer so I figured there is no better time to try it than to help ring in the new year. The smell is extremely aromatic and is simply fantastic! There are a lot of dark malty fruits (plums and raisins), Belgian yeast and bread. The taste is slightly spicy malt, fresh dark bread and a lingering warming from the alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with medium-low carbonation. No doubt that this is certainly a world class beer that is extremely well crafted. Now that I have had both the 12 and 8, I actually enjoy the Westy 8 even more than it's big brother."
"Pours dark brown with a decent size tan head that slowly recedes. A light perfuminess mixes with sweet ripe fruitiness in the aroma. Raisin, plums, and figs, a caramel breadiness as well. Taste is a mix of chocolate and more of the ripe fruity maltiness mix with belgian sugars and sugar cane flavors. There is a crisp peppery hoppiness that begins mid taste and blends with a warming alcohol and some smokiness in the finish. Medium to heavy in body. Besides the warmth in the finish, alcohol is very well balanced, peppery bitterness helps to cut the richness from the malts. Easy to drink, I look forward to seeing what some age does to this one."
"I'm a believer."
"2006 - Pours a deep, rich medium brown color with sherry red accents and a voluminous tan, thick head which dissipates fairly quickly. A lot of suspended yeast flecks visible as well. Heavy lacing in the oversized goblet into which this fine ale is poured. The nose is outstanding - sweet fruits, Belgian yeast, and a slight spiciness. Very inviting. The palate doesn't disappoint in the least ... sweet roasted malts, exotic fruits, and the finest Belgian yeast flavors. Starts out quite sweet, then yields to more complex fruity and spicy notes. Moutfeel is medium, with a very pleasing alcohol warmth. Finish is dry, despite the sweet beginnings. Mildly acidic, yet zero bitterness. Wow, what can I say ... it's Westy 12. You really just don't get any better than this. At the very top of my list, edged out ...maybe ... by St. Bernardus Abt 12. Maybe. Over all, though, one of the top beers in the world. Excellent in every way imaginable."
"Poured a really dark amber brown with an off white head that stayed throughout the glass and left some lacing. Smell is a little lighter than I expected, but still plenty of dark fruits and spices, with a little bit of a sour smell detected. Taste was much of the same, didn't really detect any sourness that I found in the nose, also I couldn't detect the alcohol. Even with my expectations of this beer being very complex, it still caught me a bit offguard, it was very nice, nearly perfect. Medium bodied, with a light to medium amount of carbonation; it was smooth with a slightly dry finish to it. Drinkability was incredible, alcohol was not to be found and it seemed to go down just as easy as a 3.2% cask ale, I had to hold myself back from drinking this too fast. The best beer in the world? Maybe. My favorite beer? No, maybe with some age though. A damn fine beer worth seeking out? Absolutely."
"edit: OK...I did find the date and put it in my review. I put the rest of my bottles away to cellar, taking out for special occasions. I hope a few last a year or so. Fresh it's, well, exceptional."
"If I were either a rich man or a monk, I could drink this all day and all night."
"Did it live up to the hype? I think so. I wasn't expecting a miracle or an otherworldly experience and what I got was one magnificent drinking experience. For sipping one beer, I don't think it gets any better than this."
"Overall: This is a great beer. It might not be the best in the world, but it certainly is fantastic."
"All the beer is poured from bottles, even in Westvleteren, but the quadruppel gets a glass with a gold rim. Nice touch. Wonderfully dark, rich color. Deep malty smell. The taste is enough to make you weep. Its a rollercoaster, really. The hops give you a nice introduction while the malty richness round out the flavor. The first hint of the alcohol is a appley overtone that is complemented perfectly by the hops. Truly spectacular. This is beer that I could drink for the rest of my life. Undoubtedly."
"Don't know if this is my # 1, but can certainly see how this is one of the best beers out there."
"I decided to drink it side by side with a 2006 St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the sake of comparison. The color of the two was almost the same but the St. Bernardus was much more carbonated. It also smelled stronger, and had a distinctly sour note in the taste that was absent from the Westvleteren offering. The Westvleteren was sweeter and smoother than the secular cousin. Bottom line; cant go wrong with either of them."
"Boy what a great beer. Poured with no head. Looks like brandy. Actually even has some signs of legs. Toffee and brandy aromas. Alcohol. Fruity and estery. The flavor left me speechless. Man, what a flavor. Raisin, cherry, gosh. Any description I could conjure up would not do this beer justice. How can the monks be so selfish."
"The taste is dominated with malty caramel and nuts with small hints of (?)cabbage. It feels smooth and rather dry on the tongue. Very potent. It finishes as smooth as it starts and is very agreeable. Great beer."
"Notes: I was taken back by the complexity and depth of this offering. You could tell me there is a woody presence and I could find it. You could tell me there are exotic fruits and in the depths of this brew I could get a slice of mango. Its all over the map and perfectly executed. The spices and slight bitter balancer towards the finish was the sealer for me. I bought 4 bottles of this and I will pull one out when the mood hits me although they may stick around for very special occasions."
"I gotta admit, with it being number one, I was expecting a religious experience, instead I ended up with a really, really good beer. My best advice is to NOT drink it cold. You gotta let the flavors show through at about 55 degrees. (20 minutes outside the fridge)."
"At first I was hesitant to give this beer straight 5s, but I honestly can't find anything I'd want to change about it. Perfection in a bottle. Easily the best beer I've ever had."
"D: The 10.2% abv is a whopper, as is the thickness of the taste. The abv is gonna limit you to one or two and the thickness is gonna fill you up quick. Absolutely drinkable and well worth the cost."
"Highly recommended; I was expecting a much more arrogant beer, and what I found was a gentle giant."
"Great to try, but given its rarity I would go with Rochefort or Chimay first."
"i almost don't want to remove it from my 'wants' list so that i can have it again, but feel it's more important that anyone who would have potentially hooked me up sends it on to someone who has never tried it."
"Drinkability: As with any quad, drinkable in moderation. I would say because of the lack of carbonation, more drinkable than most."
"Definitely one of the best in the style and one to seek out if your pallet is receptive to the quads."
"Mouth is really huge, even without a lot of carbonation. I wish I could take this beer for granted ... what I mean is, I wish this beer was so plentiful that I could buy it just about everywhere. I would love to drink this again."
"Thanks for the rare treat Mike (MDS)!"
"As complex and impressive as this beer is, I feel it's touted so highly partly due to its scarcity. Having had it along side the Rochefort 10, I actually liked the Rochefort better. To me it seemed to have a little more depth and richness than the Westvleteren."
"It's possibly the best of it's kind. I think it's different enough from Rochefort and St. Bernardus to suggest everyone try it. They're similar, but not quite the same. Each is good in it's own way...but considering how hard this brew is to come by, I'll likely stick to the other two most of the time."
"Overall - Believe the hype !!! This is without doubt the finest beer i've had the pleasure of sampling so far... Outstanding and highly recommended.... Thankfully i still have 2 bottles tucked away for another day !!"
"This was incredibly smooth and easy drinking. Finished with a small lingering sweetness with some booze burn. This made it drinkable as all get out."
"This beer is at peace with itself and the world. There are no internal conflicts or doubts. All the elements and flavors are in harmony working together to bring a sense of quiet stillness and well being to those who consume it."
"Cheers!"
"I would not consider this to be the best beer that I've ever had. However, I would say that this is the best Belgian quad that I've ever had and one of the smoothest, most balanced and pleasurable brews that I've ever enjoyed. I tried my best to be objective, despite the hype but the mystery and the quality of this beer lend to a very unique and memorable experience. I regret that I only have five more to enjoy!"
"This beer really does deserve it's hype...it is extremely complex and obviously very well crafted. I would like to try another St. Berny's 12 for comparison again...another excellent quad...but this one really is worth the hype, if not the price."
"The beer poured dark brown into the first glass and produced a half-inch head which dissolved quickly. The second pour resulted in no head and finished with with a much darker, murkier result. The lacing on both was little only resulting in tan bubbles sporadically placed on the edge of the glass. The smell resembles a brown with banana highlights and alcohol is easily traceable through the nostril. From sip to sip the taste is very complex and, like the Westy 8, the finish is as smooth as smooth can be and this is what makes Westy the best beer in the world. Its finish cannot be matched. I hope to order more of this beer as I feel, like Corsendonk Christmas Ale, it will taste much better with age. My guess is 2-years min and max."
"Kick ass after nine years."
"Drinkability is amazing , very balanced. I could sip a few of these all night.Could I be buying into the hype, I dunno ? I like this beer."
"I want another right now. Writing this review makes me a little sad that I'm presently drinking something besides it."
"overall this beer was excelent and if i ever stumble uppon it again I intend on getting some."
"-UF"
"This beer continues to grow on me every time I drink it, or as is more often the case, drink another beer out of my silver-rimmed westvleteren chalice"
"Drinkability is out of this world."
"Infinite gratitude to Jeff for this 3 year old sample. That kid didnt miss school the day that they taught sharing. Murky, brown pour with a medium sized, tan head. The aroma is very rich with lots of ripe fruit, apple pie, plums, pears, candi sugar. The flavor is well blended and superbly complex, toffee, pears, golden raisins, candi sugar, very rich. The mouthfeel is very soft, smooth and lucious. Believe the hype."
"edit: I just had the fresher ~6 month version of this beer tonight (8/24/06). I did the Rochefort vs. Westy challenge, and the Westy prevailed on all fronts. My roommate and I were even biased towards the Rochefort. Had a much cleaner flavor and finish. Not quite as roasty. Lots of bubblegum esters. Phenomenal. I want more."
"What I really like about this is how lightly drinkable it is for a 10% trappist... it dances on the tongue in a way that I've not experienced before in an Abbey quadruple. Quite amazing."
"A great great beer. Not quite the best Belgian I've had, but close enough to where I have no problems at all with this being considered the world's best. Believe the hype."
"This is a truly exceptional beer, regardless of its status."
"D - This is a fantastic beer that has no apparent flaws. However, I don't know if that's enough to make it the #1 beer in the world. Regardless of rankings, it's just damn good. How those monks get so much flavor out of just 4 ingredients is beyond me. But I'm sure glad they do."
"Edit 11/25/06: I just popped a 3 year old bottle received in a trade from prop13. This one seemed near flawless. I had it side by side with a Rochefort 10 and it slightly edged out the Rochefort by a hair with it's smoothness, gentle hopping, and a boozy brandy-esque enjoyability. Heaven in a bottle."
"Poured like dark copper pond water with a foamy, thick head. Has a yeasty fruity smell, leading into excellent sweet, fruity flavors of nut bread, dates, plum and caramel bursting out of a crazily carbonated bottle. Mild finish for a 10 percent beer, very drinkable but a bit yeasty to me (although I got it fresh off the plane from Belgium, courtesy of a friend, and probably should have let it settle for awhile.) A great beer to be sure, though surprisingly not my favorite beer ever (sacrilege, I know.)"
"Cheers..."
"I'm not sure this one met my expectations. Looking forward to trying another under different circumstances. Will review again."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with highlights of red. The foam was creamy and tan, and settled to a thin coat. The smell was lightly malty and slightly vinous. The taste was malty and lightly sweet with a touch of vinous overtones. The flavor was good, but was much less complex than older bottles that I had sampled. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and good carbonation. The aftertaste was pleasantly malty. Slightly warming. This was the first time I had sampled such a ""young"" bottle of this beer, and frankly the beer tastes much better after aging in the bottle a few years."
"Once my palate is more refined Id love to try this again and see what I can decipher."
"Best beer in the world? Not in my opinion - still a good one, and definitely worh picking some up if you find it."
"This is very good, but I wonder if the hype and limited availability doesn't effect people's overall impression of the beer. I certainly wanted it to be the best beer I'd ever tasted, but it wasn't there. In a way it felt less like beer and more like a hard liquor drink with how prevelant the alcohol was. Having said all that, I would still like to have this again, and certainly wouldn't let any chance of acquiring it get by me."
"Is this the best beer in the world? Apparently so. If you want my opinoin, and you must since you are reading this review, it is definately a great beer. I have had other beers of different styles that are equally as good though. It is definately the best Quadrapel I have had though. Thank you thomashardy for helping me finally try this great beer."
"For me it lived up to the hype. I must say this is among the best beers Ive ever had. The only downer is that it did not look amazing which is not that important."
"It has been over 3 months since I last had ANY westvleteren 12 or 8, but this reaffirms that this truly is a masterpiece of the art of brewing"
"Deep murky brown with nice 1/2 inch cap that never fully goes away. The swirly top is what I'd expect from a good trappist ale. The smell is nice and complex, but not as strong as it could be. Notes of chocolate, tangy raisin, and alcohol eminate. The taste has similar character of chocolate and raisin, only slightly sweet, and it finishes with an earthy/herbal flavor. It doesn't seem as complex as I would expect from the top rated beer overall. The mouthfeel was the best part of this beer. Rich, creamy, but not that thick, the bubbles are perfect on the palate and it finishes smooth. I enjoyed this beer, although I didn't think it was amazing. I would definitely like to try it again though...."
"It was everything I thought it would be. With a bigger head this beer is perfect."
"For a long time I've been wanting to review this beer so I could criticise 'the masses' for buying into all the hype. But I must say, this is the most amazing beer I've ever tasted in my life. Perhaps the most enjoyable treat of any sort I've ever tasted in my life. Too bad about the large head, this beer had a perfect score locked up for sure. Md-thick mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Creamy smooth body. I could drink this stuff forever."
"What can I say? This ones in a class of its own. Thanks to blitheringidiot for this one!"
"This beer is smooth opaque and malty. The alcohol is present form the 1st sip yet still very well hidden. An excellent beer thast is well worth the search. Mine was tasted at the Brewery and also in Brugge at a cozy pub. This beer is served in a chalice and should be consumed at close to room temperature for best enjoyment."
"Yes, It lived up to the hype for me. I am amazed at the complexity of the flavors. The scent was fairly easy to distinguish, but the flavor was another story. Truly, a world class beer."
"This is a very good beer, but I think the reputation is part of the high ratings."
"D - Very drinkable. This is my first Westy, and what a powerful/excellent/awesome brew. Just might have to try and get some soon."
"Well, since I recently visited this Brewery I figure I should review their beer. Having the notion that this is the best beer around and very difficult to get going in, my review could be partial. Pours a rich dark amber/brown with a great creamy head on top. The head never dies and lasts the beer. For such high alcohol content, what make this beer so good is it's drinkability. The alcohol is there but definitely not over powering. It's not syrupy but has good body. All sorts of crazy flavors present..couldn't really begin to define. You just have to try it."
"On taste, words kind of defy you. Incredible malt use, there isn't a hint of the alcohol wallop at all. It's sweet and bubbly like candy, but far from obnoxious. The toffee taste is delicious. all in all, this is the king. THE KING! No chinks in this armor."
"Drinkability is very good also the best Quad I have had to date, didn't want to rate this well because all the crap I hear about it being the best but it is quite good. However not my favorite style so not the best beer in the world for me but can't find anything to nock it for. Big thanks to gimmehead for this great brew he slipped into a trade as a suprise."
"oh dear lord, i understand the hype from the first sip. malty, bready sweetness, the perfect light carbonation, unbelievably rich body with absolutely no hint of the alcohol. ridiculously smooth. a touch dry but with a honey sweetness in the finish. drinkability? i wish it came in bombers, although the alcohol would put me in a coma. i hate being predictable, but this is going to get my highest rating ever."
"Go to Westvleteren. In summer, if you can. One of the coolest experiences of my life."
"I'm giving this the exact same score I gave to the Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or - Cuvée Van De Keizer. I think it might be a little better, or maybe that's the hype talking."
"This beer has a lot of hype and surrounding it and I think it's all very well deserved. An absolutely incredible brewing acheivement!"
"Make a pilgramage to Belgium if you have to - Westvleteren is one of a kind, straight from heaven."
"Dates and Anise fill out this perfectly rounded and balanced brew that is the color of blood and prune juice with a lovely yeast loaded off white head. Drinking this one was such a thrill and I largely agree with the hype. This is undoubtedly one of the top ten beers I have ever tasted. It is so wonderfully warming and gets richer and more pleasurable with each taste. Well worth a trip to Belgium in my book even if you can get it black market style at the punk bar down the street. Couldn't ask for a more perfect brew for my 200th review."
"Notes: I usually just read the ratings and don't post reviews. However, I felt I had to submit something for this beer; but I must say of all the beers I have tried so far, nothing has compared."
"Body reaches towards large w/out getting there. The silky smooth texture and creamy body just glides the subtle nuances across your palate. Awesome."
"Dark brown with the typical big Beligian head. Sweet spun sugar aroma with hints of raisin. Very present alcohol initially, but fades quick, and more of the spun sugar flavor with something slightly acidic, though still sweet, toward the end. Well balanced alcohol and worth the reputation if this is your favorite style."
"Monks must make this stuff because only god could tell you how to do this. Deep brown liquid poured into a westvleteren chalice, minimal head , off white color on the head, wonderful aromas, sweet, slight alcohol, caramale, and maybe liquorice at the same time, incredibly complex in the nose. big in the mouth, sipping beer at its best, savor this its great with a heady ripe cheese and some crusty bread. This beer gives a nice alcohol warmth going down, but not overpowering. I want to go to Belgium just to have this at the cafe adjacent to the monestary and soak it all in."
"Notes: I hate to do it, but this beer is just so good. The complexity and the amazing balance of this beer is just awe inspiring. I think that is what makes this beer so great the balance. Its full bodied, but not thick, sweet, but not cloying, phenolic, but not overpowering, estery, but not over the top, with the perfect amount of bitterness to contrast the sweetness. Absolutely wonderful."
"A true standout in the world of beer. I wonder when I'll drink my next bottle?"
"This was a hard beer to open. Graciously gifted to me by Bruiser81 a long time ago, it's the only bottle that I have ever layed eyes on, let alone possess. Does it live up to all the hype? Almost. Is it freakin' delicious? Hell yeah, it is!"
"D- This is a very nice beer. The notes of malt and sugar are balanced with a nice oaky flavor and some cherry characteristics come through but it is not a sweet or hot beer. This has done well with age and I hope to review it fresh one day."
"This beer is one that should mellow even more with age but I actually prefered the fresher bottle I had about 2 years ago. As I let this beer warm up I began to taste even more of the honey and clove. Overall this is a great beer, I love things about the fresher version but I love the smoothness of this aged bottle."
"HUGE THANKS TO DAVE AT THE PUBLIK HOUSE BROOKLINE for pulling this out of the basement and hooking me up with a huge surprise. Especially since it has been aged for 2 years. Once my heart restarted I poured this bad boy into a Westvleteren glass (also provided by Dave) and noticed that all the carbonation was gone. This was a bit of a disappointment because I remember in a fresher version I had the carbonation caused the yeast to swirl and swim around when the glass is sitting still. It was visually stunning and added to this beers mystique. The aged beer still had a fresh and balanced smell, a bit more molasses / maple syrup then I remember. The taste follows a trend I have noticed with aged Belgian darks, the flavors seem to meld and result in an overall flavor timeline similar to raisin bran. The front is sweet like a dried raisin, the middle is where the molasses and maple syrup are present, then when the hops appear they transform the flavor to a hearty, malty, grainy flavor (the bran part). Meanwhile the alcohol is hidden well, it's there if you look for it, and overall the beer is very well balanced. I have noticed that with age the flavors have toned down and blended much better (as expected). Especially the alcohol, in my previous review I mentioned that the alcohol flavor was too strong that it overpowered the rest of the beer. I rated the 8 over the 12 because of the alcohol flavor balance. So it was a pleasant surprise to see that age has solved this issue. Mouthfeel has also changed due to the lack of carbonation. I recall the fresh version evaporated on the tongue, it was epervescent, and lively. The aged version is more syrup like and smooth, which allows you to roll the beer around the tongue and really study the flavors before it evaporates. That being said, I like the fresh version better. It's more of a party in your mouth. And the drinkability I have to give a high mark because it was very smooth and balanced. The real test was that I was with a newbie to ""good beer"" and she probably drank more of it than I did."
" I think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America. And I seem to remember reading in one of the forums that Westvleteran 12 is bottled three years before the date on the cap. As good as this was, I would like to try a slightly fresher sample. And my two cents is that this is head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included."
"Bottle dated August 2005. Made a pilgrimage all the way to Westvleteren to pick this up. Pours into my Westy goblet black with dark tan hints when held up to the light. Decent compact light tan head which recedes fairly quickly to a thin covering. Aroma is complex and amazing dark fruit, toffee, oak (almost wine barrel), subtle spice from the alcohol. Taste is full on - all of the components identified in the aroma, but so intense. Very sweet start is balanced we superbly by the bitterness of finish and the peppery spice from the otherwise well hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is full and velvety smooth, just about perfect. I can't imagine having too many of these in a session - it would have to be the night cap, however it is almost sad to get to the bottom of the glass, so I have rated it high on that basis. Damn, only one left now :-(."
"I enjoyed this beer so much, that I will, without doubt, order it whenever it appears on a beer menu that passes in front of me..."
"overall: delicious. this is deserving of the current number one beer in the world. i cannot give it a five, nor can i make it my highest rated beer, but it's definitely one of the best beers i've ever tasted. i have three more of these put away, and i can't wait to see how it matures."
"Drinkable? Does a bear shit in the woods?! By far maybe the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking!"
"Big thanks to numenor1 for the chance to try this one. Pours a beautiful amber deep copper color into my DFH chalace. At first, an impressive head that looked like a cooking pancake, with large bubbles rising to the surface. Then, the head vanishes. I pick up alchol and dates in the aroma. Interesting enough... but not shocking. Taste is that of rum mixed with ripe fruits, and then it dries out and leaves your palate clean. Almost too dry though to me. Mouthfeel is good, outside of the dry chalky taste that this leaves. It is drinkable given the ABV, but I've got to say, I don't think this is the ""best beer in the world""."
"Undying thanks to the premier sack kicker on BA: Stonecrusher for the bottle. Look, I finally drank it! It only took me a year!"
"The body is medium-full with an incredibly soft and smooth mouthfeel. The finish is like silk. Drinkability is hurt a little by the richness and the alcohol which I can feel."
"Amazingly, it somehow lives up to the hype. Best beer in the world? I'm not sure, but it is certainly deserving of the title."
"Yeah buddy! I got me some Westy in a trade, and now that it's harder to find than all hell, i'm gonna drink it and review it. Blank bottle (no label), brought back directly from Belgium. Yellow cap is dated 05/04/08. Poured out to a dark brown color that became bright auburn red when held to the light. Lower carbonation, with some notes of lace in the glass. Nice 1/4 inch head was consistant through the entire glass. Aromas of fruits, buttery malts. Very sweet smelling overall. The taste, hands down, is a 5. I find this beer to be everything it is touted to be; flavors of sweet bread, smooth malts, ripe fruits and roasted elements all perfectly balanced made this brew exceptionally enjoyable. A thick, silky mouthfeel was ever present, reminding me that this brew really is quite heavenly (that's probably what the monks had in mind). Finished crisp, with some bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. The nearly 11%ABV was well concealed, a point that is well noted, as this could be very powerful in doses of more than one bottle (but really, who could honestly afford or even want to drink more than one bottle a sitting). A world class brew, and even better now that it is becoming a rarity. Highly recommended. Special thanks go out to kevinl6 for the hook up of this brew and his highly professional and friendly trade."
"When I get the money, I'm going to Belgium for some Belgian brew."
"I really enjoyed both beers- but I prefer this. The flavors seem to harmonize much better, it's deeper, richer. If only this was easier to find..."
"Appearance is murky brown with some sediment at the bottom. Surprisingly long lasting lacing which made me happy! I'm not getting a whole lot from the smell at first, but this bottle was served a bit too cold at the Hop Leaf in Chicago. As it warms, the smell opens up, but is not as powerful as I would like. It smells very spicy and a little alcoholic - in a mellow, rum-like way. There are also some fruity tones, which take the form of apple and cherries mainly. The taste is like no other beer I have tasted. The best way I can describe it is to tell you to imagine the monks mashed up some apple pie and some pumpkin pie into a liquid and added some Captain Morgan spiced rum. That's all I need to say about that. The mouthfeel is very luxurious and silky, and this beer is thick! This really complements the dessert like flavor well. Overall, I'm very impressed, and I like this one better than the 8. I definitely couldn't drink this every day because of the sheer sinfulness of it all (sorry monks), but I couldn't get enough of it when I had it so I would rate the drinkability extremely high."
"Sampled from a bottle that's been aged ~2 years. Murky reddish brown with a moderate head of very fine bubbles. Extraordinary delicate lacing in the chalice (it actually looks just like lace) that didn't budge even when the beer was agitated. Superb retention as well -- I don't think the head dissipated at all from beginning to end. Nice aroma, lots of fruity wine/vinous character along with a bit of more acidic fruit, possibly cranberry. Soft maltiness with a bit of light roast and faint hops. Mild fruit flavour throughout, malt sweetness fills out the middle and end, but stays fairly subdued. Some chocolate and roasted malt creeps in, but this is very mild. Caramel and toffee appear at the mid-point briefly. Moderate bitterness with a bit of grassiness. Complex flavour that stays balanced and round all the the way through, but keeps changing. Soft carbonation with an airy texture. Off-dry finish, a full body, and slight alcohol warmth. This is a wonderfully balanced, yet complex brew. A rare treat. A big thanks to Ralph for sharing this truly exceptional beer. It didn't disappoint!"
"This was the one that did it for me. I didn't even like beer all that much, I was a college kid used to macro crap and the occassional SNPA. Then I went to Belgium for a spring break trip . Then I ended up at a little bar in Brugges one afternoon that I only wish I remembered the name of. Asked the barkeep to bring me the best thing they had, and sure enough, he did...and I haven't had anything better since. Believe me, I've tried."
"There's one inch of dense, light tan head in the chalice. A toffee-brown pour fills out a deep red-brown beer (very nice, dark red). The nose is bursting with ripe fruit, deep toffee caramel, tons of malt, some tart apples. Rich caramel and ripe fruit (plums?) up front. Middle is buttery, rich, THICK caramel; brown sugar and milk at temperature. Delicious. Alcohol evident in the bready, yeasty finish. Cookie spice. This is delicious, fruity, buttery, toffee goodness. Definitely the best quad I've had: not too sweet, alcohol well-balanced. Exceptional."
"Notes: I don't really know if it's worth the price on a regular basis, but it's definitely worth it for special occasions. My very amateur first-time impression of this beer: 90% St Bernardus ABT 12 + 10% Rochefort 8 or 10.."
"Fantastic."
"ps if you see this beer on a shelf buy it right away it is extremely rare."
"Pours a very cloudy hazy brown, some orange around the edges, thick off white head forms, perfect lacing and plenty of legs, this head lasted until the end. Smell is very vinous, aged wine/port, fruity, some chocolate cranberries, little bit of alcohol. Taste is insanely complex, its a shape shifter of a brew. First very vinous and port like, chocolate toffee middle, dark cherries, tart bitter finish. The mouthfeel is amazing, silky and smooth, absolutely no rough edges, the carbonation was perfect, this beer just glides. Aged a couple of years, thanks a ton to the man who made this possible."
"What else can I say about this beer? Ummm... Very rich. Too bad the monks now limit purchases to a sixtus of this wonderful brew. 10.2%? I have had 6% or 8% brews where they failed to conceal the alcohol better than this beer. Much lighter on the tongue than I expected. Not lots of heavy sugars like other quads, but just amazing malts that are light (and crisp, dare I say?). Nose is full of nice yeasties and the hops are surprisingly potent throughout this beer. The Belgian sugars are sweet but not filling or so rich as to overwhelm the palate. Nursing my way through this goblet. May plan a trip to Belgium just to get some more of this beer."
"Drinkable? At 10.2%, I can't think of a more drinkable potion on earth. Believe the hype."
"No date, but bottle consumed fresh without aging. Time would only benefit this beer, it can wait longer than I can. Whatever your preference, pour in the yeast -- I downed at the last without regret."
"I tried to find fault with this beer, I really did... it was almost like a challenge, rating the #1 beer in the world. But I couldn't."
"More than lives up to is status as a very special beer."
"After much anticipation I finally got my hands on this one. Well it tastes just like St. Bernardus 12 and for about 4x the $. Still a terriffic brew. The taste has a raisiny-chocolate, fruity tone. The appearance is a non transparent dark brown with clouds of yeast swirling all around. The aroma is a pleseant bittersweet choclate and plum fragarance. The alcohol is hidden in the flavor but shows by the end of the session. A full bodied brew that is just enough for one session. A treat for anyone lucky enough to find it."
"The mouthfeel is nice and full. It coats your tongue like a fine wine. This is a very creamy tasting beer. Also the carbonation is wonderful. The drinkability of this beer is excellent for something with such a high abv. I hate to say this, but I like the Westvleteren 8 a little better than the 12. That said, this is truly one of the best beers in the world."
"D&N: This beer is everything it's cracked up to be and more. Much more. The wait I had to endure (over a year) while aging this was worth it, and I confirm it with each heavenly sip of this marvelous elilxir. I have never in my short beer drinking life had an experience like this."
"All in all, the world is becoming a small place. This brew is no longer as hard to get as it once was, and prices have fallen, so the mystique may have faded a bit -- but this is still a beautiful brew, and I thank the Trappist brothers for their efforts."
"Overall: Obviously this is amazing. I found that the alcohol provided a great dimension to the taste overall whereas I thought it overpowered the Rochfort 10. This is what every beer wants to be when it grows up."
"Upon finishing the beer, a patron sitting next to me asked. Where do you go now? My response was down. Down in quality, price, taste, and expectation."
"Drinkability & notes: There is no question that this is an excellent beer and very drinkable. This is the second time I've drank and review this beer and I must say I enjoyed it much more this time. The flavor is much more appealing and tasty to me this time around. This was definately worth a re-review"
" I think this beer needs to take a nap and cool off for some time. The alcohol profile is way too hot , and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of the sweetness that I expected. I'll let it sit for a year or so and try again."
"Nice ruby to dark brown, with slight off-white head. Head retention very long, lasting. Leaves a thick lace in the goblet style glass. Domination of malt, with various degrees of raisin, chocalot, caramel, and toffee flavoring. Thee aroma of fruit, spice, caramel and plums almost bready, hinting to a wonderful ambrosial nose. Finishing with a pleasant acidity, helping the alcohol grab your palate and making it beg for more, yes please more. The lingering aftertaste sooths the churn for the pleasantness to never relieve your palate. With the flavoring, lasting aroma, pleasant finish making this beer one for the all day marathon of pleasure. Alas the alcohol could cut it short if not carefull. Although the cap date reading 26.11.05 forgive thyne ignorance knowing not how to interpret the date. Beer exceptional yes."
"Slàinte!"
"Helluva beer- no question. I am reviewing such an old sample to let other consumers know that they may indeed be trustworthy- I have had at least four with this date stamp recently and they have all been remarkable. If I should ever have an opportunity to sample a fresher bottle I will not hesitate to re-review."
"Surprisingly, this beer is not overpoweringly ""Belgian"" meaning that it lacks that dominating Belgian yeast smell and flavor. They're there to be sure, but it takes a back seat to everything else going on. There are only a few beers that deserve such high praise. These beers could easily become an addiction. Luckily, this one costs about US$8.29 for a 330ml bottle. So, unless I start selling off the wife's basket collection, I'll keep this beer to about one a month."
"Just about perfect across the board. Poured (sadly) into an Orval chalice with very small head and a murky brown color. Smell is very aromatic, like raisins and candied fruit with not one trace of alcohol. Taste explodes in your mouth. First is of sweet fruits like apricots and plums. Next has more carbonation but a similar candied taste. End taste is just as sweet, like a sugar drink trickling down your throat. Not a hint of alcohol in the entire thing--remarkable. I can see why this one is always rated #1."
"At long last I was finally able to snag the great Westy 12,pours a deep brown with a suprisingly thin head that was gone pretty quickly not leaving anything behind.Whoa the aromas are just incredibly complex and rich,some almond and raisin almost a cinnamon bun type aroma to it,just awesome.Flavors are more mellow than expected,I get some star anice and raisin up front with some mellow orange tinge in the lngering finish.I like the ""12""better than the ""8" but I have had some better Quads but still a pleasure to drink for sure."
"I find this to be the best beer I've ever had. PERIOD. Rochefort 10 is a good alternative if you cannot find this beer. Worth the money I paid for it. I still got one bottle. So tempted to drink.. MY PRECIOUS."
"01-07-06. This beer looked and smelled great as was expected making waiting to warm and drink it very difficult. It poured with some life leaving a small but fragrant head and a dark brown root beer color. This is the best beer I have ever had. It is so good that it acts like several beers. First you have the high alcohol, sweet honey, maple like a trappist or abbey ale, then you have the lasting alcohol burn of a barley wine, then you have the crisp clean thirst quenching finish that makes it thoroughly satisfying and wanting more. Silky, rich with a panoply of flavors that linger on your palate. Even with a piece of pungent English stilton, westy 10 compliments it well and cuts right through it. Get it at Jackson Wine and Spirits."
"Drinkability: Is fantastic! this IS world class! but High abv, sippin beer for sure! but it's just a rare treat, to sit, sip, and savor this, simply great stuff!"
"A densely creamy tan head rests lazily atop a hazy, dark russett body (carefully poured from a longstanding bottle it's a clear ruby with orange highlights - but add the yeast later on!). Eventually the head receeds, but it's somehow able to hold a thin but completely solid cap throughout the entire beer. And initially, it leaves solid walls of thin lace that fade to become sheets of tiny spots towards the end of the chalice. And that's no easy feat given its 10.2% abv! The nose offers honeyish, nutty, cocoaish (Ovaltine...?), bready, and caramel drenched malt as well as a bit of hard candy and some chewy fruit (raisins, berries). It's velvety smooth across the palate with a full, dextrinous body and exceptionally fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is even more exquisite than the nose implies, and includes notes of soft anise, lemon rind, a touch of leather, some delicate bubblegum, and a mild floral character that really helps to round it out. They yeast is incredibly important as well, as it gives it depth and rounds it out; and it should be poured even with an aged bottle. Finally, one of the things that makes the Westy 12 such a stunning beer is that it's so soft and supple considering it's such a behemoth. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and when it does appear in the flavor it only helps by lending a ""spicy"" character. And despite the amount of character it has, it's actually not as malty as a doppelbock. It's lighter, and it finishes semi-dry with more spiciness and yeastiness than sweet malt that might build on the palate... giving it a really great drinkability. Impressive, to say the least, this is a brilliant beer because it's big enough to deliver a great richness and lots of complexity, but also incredibly well-balanced enough that it really leaves you wanting more!"
"330 ml bottle, bought at Pivni Galerie, Prague. Hazy dark reddish brown colour, enormous tan head. Lovely complex aroma of fruits, oak, leather and spices. Flavour is surprisingly bitter - hops of course, but also dead yeast cells? Leaves a not entirely pleasant bitter aftertaste on the back of my tongue. Elements of oak, caramel, toffee and spices. Warming mouthfeel, as expected. I much preferred the Rochefort 10 to this one."
"It is also very strong. My ears are flushed and radiating heat. Droplets of sweat are on my bald head..but, oh, this is divine."
"We went through hell to get this, fortunately it was worth the effort. Pours a dark cloudy red brown with a tan head that looks amazing, but doesn't look as amazing as I thought, still exceptional. Aroma was almost wine-like, with dark fruits and a strong breadiness, very good, but still not the best I have smelt. Taste is amazingly all over the map, sweet dark fruits first, malty middle, long hoppy finish, very, very complex, every sip was slightly different. Velvetty smooth mouthfeel, without a hint of alcohol. This beer is exceptional and definitely world-class, but I had one better than it so far. Next stop, the Dark Lord..."
"Exceptionally drinkable for a 10.2%."
"So complex. So smooth. So delicious."
"To make this beer lovers dream complete, I had an ice cream sundae topped with a beer sauce made from the 12. Beer and ice cream may not sound tempting to everyone but it was unbelievable! I will never forget this experience and will definitely return to St. Sixtus."
"Happy birthday to clvand0 with the drinking of this beer. Although it was a few days ago, I still can't get this one out of my head. The beer poured a beautiful dark brown color with a 2 finger head that barely falls at all. The lace is almost solid around the top of the chalice as I drank the beer down. The nose was very fruity, with lots of sweet fig tones, and an almost appley, crisp aroma. There is a nice spiceyness as it warms as well. The flavor is awesome. Very mellow, wtih a spiceyness and an alcohol burst that play very well together. The flavor moves into the fig, and slightly bready notes, but also with a touch bitter on the finish. The feel was smooth, slightly creamy and moderate to thick. Just a nice beer. I didn't want to put the glass down with this beer. This is definately a world class beer. Thanks to SheepNutz for trading this to me before I knew what a treat it was. What a show of advocacy."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Each of the Westys we had became progressively better to me, and this is definately my favorite over the 6 and 8. This one is damn nice."
"Ive been wanting to try this for ages-thanks to axisjones and Secret Santa I am now able to. Pours a hazy brown color-not cloudy but ""muddy"" in color. Nice yeasty aroma. Black currants,slight vanilla and raiseny. Malty flavor upfront-nice caramel sweetness,somewhat sugary. Earthy. Theres a spiciness in the finish from the alcohol-reminds me of how horseradish hits the sinuses. Excellent body. An extremely drinkable beer-doesnt have any of the intangibles that I find in some Belgians. Really a classic."
"33 cl unlabeled bottle; cap dated best before 5/13/2006. Pours a deep coppery brown with a fluffy light tan head. Caramel and apple aromas with some healthy yeast notes. Sipping is the true measure of this beer. Mostly malty and sweet, however there is the most intriguing floweriness in the finish, like a blossom. Appley esters come into play a lot and work well to hide the alcohol. Good mouthfeel, not too sticky like other quadruples. Overall, a wholly excellent brew that is quite elusive to many. It's worth the effort to seek it out."
"sat. 11/27/04 at Kuhnhenns with bierisgut and clark v v from rate beer,who brought this wonderful bottle to share. redmosquito and one of the kuhnhenn brothers where at the table to. poured a rich brown with a light tan head.aroma got a nice hit of alcohol, than came the malts, caramels, honey, cherry, and some apple. flavor, didnt want to swallow this , the creamy smoothness of this beer was great. got malts, caramel alcohol, honey, raisins, chocolate or maybe chocolate covered raisins.this is only the 3rd bottle I have seen I know bierisgut has got one so maybe in the middle of the night under the cover of darkness Ill see if I can get it."
"Coppery amber in color with an off white head and a little cloudy yeast sediment. Interesting aroma, definite alcohol smell, then a wine like aroma, oakey yet it still has some creamy malt fragrance. Alcohol warms as I taste this, malt sweetness dominates, nutty, caramelly, and creamy vanilla in the finish. The beer sits on the tongue and lingers with a warm malt creaminess. This is a great beer, the only thing keeping this from being a daily beer is the availability."
"Pours a stunning hazy brown with a frothy head. Smells very sweet and caramelly. Malty upfront with a nice floral hoppy back. Now for the taste. I also love wine, and this is almost a wine to me, except far surpassing any wine I've ever had. Tastes so complex and smooth, and fruity, and malty, and sweet, and hoppy, and bready, and so, so much more. This is a beer words cannot describe. This is one of my first attempt's at trappist beer, and I must say I've never been more impressed with a beer. This is beer perfection. This is beer paradise. This is beer bliss. This is beer. Period."
"I had this first about a year or so ago when I was really starting to get into craft beers. I decided to wait a while though before I tried it again as it had so much going on I couldnt appreciate it all. Bottle is dated with 07-09-04, so I will have to pick up a few to age. This poured out a murky brown with a tall light tan head that filled the goblet. There were some floaties that could be seen occasionally and the beer coated the glass in rings of lace. The head managed to stay afloat till the end, which was impressive. Aroma is very fruity with raisins and other dark fruit. It was quite sweet and spicy as well with a touch of yeast. The taste starts of with a strong fruity sweetness before a good bit of spice comes through to even things out a bit. Earthiness is also in full swing here adding a touch of bitterness before the spicy sweet after taste. Wow there is just so much going on here I feel like I am still missing out on plenty. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with good carbonation. This bottle went down easily but I would be reluctant to grab another right after, not sure why but one was plenty. Amazing beer that everyone should get a chance to try."
"33 cl bottle. Date code of 30.03.02 on cap. No price on bottle, but seem to recall $8 as being the price. None of the Westy beers poured very clean. The sediment separated no matter how carefully the beer was decanted. With the higher alcohol in this beer you could not drink a ton, but the smooth viscous nature of the flavors and the deep maltiness make you want to try."
"Finally decided to open this bottle and see what the fuss is about. Poured a rich Mahogany colour with an nice fluffy offwhite head. Smell is or dried fruits, prunes, spice and a brown sugar. Flavour was huge. Well rounded caramel flavours combined with liqour soaked dried fruits. A bit of dark sweet bread in the middle i think. Exceptionally well balanced. Carbonation was good and the alcohol was well hidden. Drinkability.... would I have another of course. This was a very tasty brew. Was it the best of the best. Not in my opinion, but then again tasting is subjective and can vary with time and place. A top-notch beer to say the least, but not the holy grail to me"
"Mouthfeel is good, really spot on. Carbonation and body are well balanced and make for a lucious drinking experience. A little more body wouldn't hurt though. Drinkability...well damn...I could drink this all night..problem is I'd be drinking it on the street because my home would be repossesed. If this was a bit more affordable it would be a 5 for drinkability. If you have yet to try this gem, track it down ASAP...it's worth the hunt."
"Edit: I got the chance to try both the Rochefort 10 and the St. Bernardus 12 and I think that the St. Bernardus was good, but a tad watery and I will have to try the Rochefort and Westvleteren again, because the Rochefort was so good."
"From my tasting notes (tasted on 1/14/04); How lucky was I to find a case of this in PA. Expensive but well worth it! Poured a beautiful dark mahagony with a small tan head. Initial aromas of maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses and fruits.Soft tastes (sugar, fruits, molasses, prunes, dates, so many tastes coming thru). Alcohol content well hidden. I can't say/put into words the depth and greatness of this beer."
"I'm delighted. I want it. I miss it already."
"This beer has extraordinary balance and complexity. It does not hit you over the head; it just states itself perfectly with nothing out of place. I equate it with Veuve Cliquot La Grande Dame."
"What to say about this beer... Well to say is that I can dream the road to the abbey and to know that it's a day job, just to get a couple of casses; you can guess how we( I never go alone) think about this beer. Just getting the smell of all the fruit and hops makes me dream away! Drinking it you go to (beer)heaven and afterwards you just feel in a green field with beautifull hopflowers of Poperinge. Well that's not too far from Westvleteren so I mostly go for another one because there is no other beer that you want after a 12 then another 12!"
"One can perhaps see why these European lowlanders thought so much blood was worth expending to maintain tropical spice island and plantation colonies in another era. Flavors like these are as cheap today as $12 or so a third liter."
"Best before date of 21.12.02 stamped on the bottle cap. How good is this SOB fresh!?"
"Complex, melded flavor. Up front, the beer is lacking in my opinion but does possess notes of cherries and grapes. Mid-palate leans into a brandy-like sweetness, notes of caramel and pepper and finishes with hints of plums and berries. The alcohol is precisely hidden throughout the brew and it simply just doesn't show its potency. That being said, I truly don't find this beer to be all that flavorful and I never have. It's a great beer but I don't think its the best beer in the world. I can see why others do though."
"The massive hype surrounding this beer is absolutely justified. Pure beer perfection. Definitely the best Trappist Ive ever tried. Worthy of its long held place at the top of the vaunted Best of BA list."
"Taste is sweet initially, with fruity notes. Almost seems to evaporate on your tongue, leaving the slight alcohol flavors to mingle with the dark fruits. Mouthfeel is great, creamy and smooth, and drinkability is excellent, as you'd have to sit and drink a few before nailing down everything that's going on for the senses. Unfortunately, abv kind of prevents you from re-examining many in a row, and then there's that whole availability problem. As was the 8, worth the search to enjoy..."
"In sum, the best example of this style, and one of the best beers I've had."
"Flavor appears one-dimensional at first, but becomes obviously more complex and mellows as it warms. More dry than I had expected. A great warming sensation and a nice buzz that seems to come only from the Trappist brews."
"Had this at 5 in the morning while doing some last minute packing. Will have to try it again..."
"Muddled looking auburn tone. Bubbly light brown head leaves sparse lace. Aroma consists of light candy notes. Some bubblegum. Brown sugar. Very sweet nose. The flavors are very delicate, yet complex. Sweet melon like tones. Light rum alcohol. Candy and more candy. And then a dry wash of spice cleans up. Very flavorful....even in it's fragile nature. For such a big beer, this is incredibly drinkable. Mouthfeel is very light and airy. Carbonation is moderate. Very enjoyable brew."
"If this is aged beer, I hope I live a long life!"
"The only downfall for me in drinkability was the price. At $11.00 a bottle it would hurt my bank account a bit to drink more."
"Really one of the most complex beers I've ever sat down to. A full bottle presents new flavors with each sip, some dwindling with warmth as others take their place. With the complexity came some unpleasant flavors, and I thought the sweetness was overbearing, especially when approaching room temperature. I didn't care for the yeast flavor, which was quite prominent, or the muddy drone of the malt, but that could have something to do with a couple years on the brew. Maybe the brew would present itself differently when fresh. I'd hope for something a bit more toned and alert feeling. A fine belgian ale, but nothing I'd consider world class material. I'm actually surprised at how well regarded this is. Possibly something to do with it's scarcity? I don't expect I'll be paying $9 for a second bottle, nor going through the trouble to get it. One was more than enough. It certainly does have personality, and I doubt I'd ever mistake this for another beer."
"Really drinkable...If you can find a bottle! I have been storing these two bottles for a long time."
"Had one in late winter 2011. Its very classy . Averaging my individual 5 ratings on it."
"Paid 8.50 for the 11 ounce bottle.."
"A fantastic example of a belgian ale, but maybe not quite as good as rochefort 10, didnt live up to my extremely high expectations, i thought it was great but rochefort 10 truly is the greatest quadrupel inmo"
"This has to be one of the best beers I have ever tasted. It is so complex that my pallete was exhausted after drinking one. It is a beer that you will never forget."
"Pours out dark with a small tan head. Served in the proper glassware it looks splended. Velvet smooth mouthfeel makes for so smooth and so perfect smiles. This is a fine crafted beer which is certainly in a class by itself. Best Belgian trappist brew hands down. Best beer? I don't think one can cross compare styles."
"This immaculate elixir poured a beautiful cloudy brown color with a medium tan head. Roma was that of dark fruits such as grapes and plums. It had a creamy mouthfeel and a sweet fruity but at the same time nutty and slightly chocolately tsate. Slight alcohol burn as the beer warmed up. Calling this a beer is an understatement, more like heaven!"
"Regardless, this is absolutely lusty and gratifying."
"Westvleteren 12 is world-class, no doubt about it. I can appreciate this beer (I think), I respect this beer, I even like this beer a lot. I just don't love this beer. Call me a hophead, call me an unrefined simpleton, call me what you will, but that's how I feel at this juncture in my journey. That doesn't mean that Westvleteren 12 is anything less than incredible. Everyone should have the chance to sample it at least once."
"This is a very complex beer and I am very glad to finally have tried it and add the bottle to my collection. Is it the best beer I've ever had? Tough to say, Top 15 easy. Go and look for it!"
"This gusher finally settles with a giant light tan head that's not overly persistent, atop a brown body with copper notes. Dark brown yeast flocs populate the glass and take their time settling. A huge malty aroma leaps from the glass, with a strong merlot-like vinous quality and a touch of vinegar. Smooth sweetness and spritzy carbonation battle for predominance as a many-layered symphony of malt and alcohol warms and entices the palate. This finishes wit a moderate alcohol heat and mild earthy hop character that emerge and linger as the formidable malt dissipates."
"Bottle: Poured a deep ruby colored beer with a huge thick foamy dark white head with incredible retention (the head was still in place when drinking the last sip of this beer 30 minutes after the bottle had been opened). Carbonation is really good with lots of bubble at the bottom of the glass and some other ones sticking on the side of the glass. Aroma is comprised of light and sweet roastiness with a nice touch of spice but I could not detect any alcohol. Taste is an almost perfect mix between caramel malts, candi sugar and something else, which might be cinnamon. I was really glad that I could not taste the alcohol since it could have been quite harsh at 10.2%. Wow, what a beer. I originally thought that this might be a bit of an over hyped beer but Im glad to report that it lives up to all the praises."
"The taste is a perfect and subtle balance of dark caramel malts and kind of hidden so floral hops. I got the impression to eat a slice of amazing bread: this beer's so nutritive. A veil of citrus and a note of raisin and grape appear also, with a wooden and slightly tart aspect of some great wines . What an amazing beer! A masterpiece that wonderfully hides its power. I had read a lot about it, I had thought about it a lot, and I will continue to do so..."
"I thouroghly enjoyed this beer. I can't wait for the other to be opened. Only a couple more years to go."
"I think its a very drinkable beer but I can say I would not spend the 8 - 9 bucks for a 12 ounce bottle again. If I had my choice I would go after the blue cap first"
"Brewed in March 2004 and sampled in May 2004. I've got five more, that I'll put away for aging. I can't wait to see how this beer matures."
"Direct from my trip Belgium trip I had to bring back 5 fresh ones. Unlabeled brown bottle. Light cherry color in the goblet with a big persistant pale tan head. Lots of little bubbles of lively carbonation. Caramel sweet nose with touches of pineapple, mecinal vapers, and clean hops in the sinus. A beautiful look in the glass. Sorf round taste of caramel and malt initally followed by ripe plums and sour pear. It tastes as good as it looks. So rounded and full of flavor. Very very soft and smooth in the mouth. The ABV ia well hidden behind dark fruits and toasted caramel sweetness. Lots of sediment in the bottom of the bottle.. carefully pour this beauty. A Classic!"
"11.2 ounce bottle. Expensive, I think I paid over $7 for this little sucker! Anyway, pours dark and viscous. This stuff is thick, raises a formidable long lasting head. Nose of spices,yeast,earth, currants and musk. Flavor notes of fruit, earth, muskyness and yeast. COMPLEX flavors, yeastyness. Not on the top of my list, cuz its just not all that drinkable , IMHO, Not a beer for beginners. All strong dark Belgian lovers rejoice and seek out this classy, exotic sipper."
"Drinkability: As with most of the really interesting beers, this one isn't one you can pound down one after the other. This is a sipping beer."
"ng"
"Last of 5 Trappist brews for me and Mkobes in our Trappist tasting. This is my fourth overall bottle of Westy 12, and will not be the last. This one had a date on the cap of 29/09/03, so I think this may have expired. pours a murkey deep brown color with floaties and a perfect trappist head. Beautiful raisiny musty tobacco and stuff aroma. Big fruity malt flavor, with tobacco and raisins. Rich and satisfying. This one seals it. I am becomming a monk in a Trappist monastary."
"The flavors come on in waves. There is no hop bite but rather a mild to moderate bitterness with none of that Pale Ale floral character... fades to a dry finish. Quite smooth. Reminds me of cognac. I get sweet malt and caramel -- ah I'm getting the sugar now. There's licorice and spiciness and something else I can't describe. It's full bodied and rich and darn smooth. The finish is dry but you still have the taste of complex fruit in your mouth. The alcohol moves in with gradual warmth. I sip it over and over and it remains a complex mystery to me. I must have more and more. It makes me hungry though I just finished lunch. I have some special Chinese duck that has been cooked with soy sauce and spices (five spice?) and they go together perfectly. Finally at the end my head is spinning with the alcohol. This would've kicked ass in the middle of my lunch. I can see why BAs love this beer. I'm glad I bought an extra bottle!"
"Drinkability. I think this one has sipability. It needs to be taken slowly like a brandy or single malt. It's in that class of beverage."
"Feel is beyond words here. Wow! Amazingly full, yet calmingly smooth and fluffy with a heavenly fine carbonation that continues to give way to the flavors, never too sharp and never too distant. Well rounded, superbly soft, and exceptionally drinkable. Its nearly a meal! It doesn't seem to have 10.8% ABV, its masked very well. One isn't enough, not nearly enough. I will need to get more, alot more, and hopefully begin to pick out what it is about this beer that makes my eyebrows raise and my mind go ""huh? and wow!"" Loftly, noble, sublime; wonderfully put together. Thank you Gusler!"
"It pours a dark brown with a huge head. The aroma has some dark fruit, chocolate, and yeast. The flavors are very complex. Probably the most complex I have ever had. The body is rich and creamy. There is a little amount of spiciness, some sweet fruits, and choclate. It truly is transcendent."
"This beer is so far away from Macro beers that I can't believe they are related."
"Disclaimer, it is the first time I have this beer along with 6 other comparable, 5 of which are classified as ABTs and there's only one among the 6 that I've had before. Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so. By the way, this was a nice fit with the great quebeccer cheese Victor et Berthold, recommended by Simon_Patrice and provided by MartinT. Big cheers to Ciderguy and Hopsrus for each hooking me up with a westy 12."
"Drinkability is probably as high as it gets although complexity makes this one to sip and savor."
"Drinkability: Tasty and well made, but I believe I like Bernie 12 better. It's darker, richer, and a bit more complex - but only by a hair, palate-wise. Wallet-wise, I like Bernie 12 by a toupee. Worth seeking out as you might disagree with my assessment Re: Bernie 12 v. Westy 12."
"Poured a hazy dark caramel with a small, creamy mocha head. It had a rich, well blended malty aroma with only a hint of alcohol -- one of the most pleasant aroma's I've encountered. The mouthfeel was almost more like eating than drinking -- it was full and flavorful; thick and heavy on the palate with a nice carbonated highlight. I detected toasted, chocolaty hints, but the alcohol was quite discernable. Blended enough to fit well with the flavor, but a definite alcohol presence. Highly drinkable for the style."
"Notes: Excellent beer. A very nice solid beer. Super drinkable."
"Excellent in its bitterness, but there is just too much alcohol (read lack of balance) and way too thick (any beer thicker thank heavy whipping cream is too thick)."
"Well I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that). While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways. I haven't had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last)."
"Overall: Complex, tasty...a must try!"
"Appearance: A viscous pour, mohogany brown color with the unfiltered approach let's the light through but very cloudy nice creamy textured head very small bubbles gives the silky appearance. Lacing forms in nice bands the typical belgian style lacing going down, overall great appearance. Aroma: A blissful mixture of different scents, this beer serves up a great spiced tone, then a warming sweet dough character, blended with raisins and alcohol. The vinous tone is the hallmark characteristic the one that stands out just a great experience even if it costs 10 to 12 dollars a bottle. Taste: Alcohol is warming and blends with a shortbread cookie and overly ripened fruit quality, cloves and spices are evident as well this beer is good stuff very complex. Mouthfeel: Full bodied soft silky carbonation coats the palate with a pleasant sensation. Drinkability: Massive amounts of flavor and complex aroma equals a satisfying drinking session this beer doesn't mess around very big, and unique all on it's own. Can't say their anything that compares besides the St. Bernadus Abt."
"Many thanks to Paquette for importing this gift by hand."
"Very good beer. Not *the* best."
"To sum it up, this is a phenomenal beer. I really enjoyed it on its own (several hours after a meal), and I plan to drink it that way again to really take advantage of its complexity and craftsmanship. The cost is a factor, but the overall experience is worth the price of admission. I will definitely buy this beer again."
"Drinkability is hampered by two things: the sheer magnitude of this brew, and the $$$$ that accompanies the beer."
"Deep garnet hued with a thick off white head that recedes to a thin, but persistant film. Chunks of sediment are suspended as if frozen in amber. Aroma is great if a bit subdued with a hint of alcohol evident. Taste of raisins, plums, chocolate, yeast and a touch spicy. Medium mouthfeel. For being such a firebreather it sure is some good drinkin'. If it wasn't for the crazy price I could drink it all day."
"Overall: I am impressed. While it may be hyped to some extent, I can honestly say I have never tasted anything like it before and I look forward to that as-of-yet-unknown special occasion where I can break out my other bottle and sit down with a nice cigar and enjoy it."
"Overall Impression: Finally, after all the hype, I tried this beer (yeah, shame on me for taking so long!). It does not disappoint. A world class beer, all the way. Definitely deserving to be in the top 50, just maybe not at #1. Come on guys, is the abv really that important!?! I tried to review this without the beer's ""rep"" clouding my judgement. And also before the beer's cojones rendered my judgement unreliable!"
"It pours a deep dark murky brown with and tannish beige head. An earthy aroma of cut hay, coffee, cocoa, sweet malt, hops and warming alcohol excites the olfactory senses. Sweet caramel malt, buttery biscuits, toffee, banana, lemon zest, light pine, hint of herbs and flavors of dark rum mingle and dance in perfect rhythm and harmony. This is a very drinkable brew for something of this strength. Velvety smooth and lush. Is there a perfect beer out there? Almost...try the Blue Cap Abt 8."
"a damn fine brew but i am still partial to the westy 8 over this one. it pours a cloudy amber/brown colour that is reminiscent of iced tea. there is a thin head here which is quick to dissolve and leaves virtually no lacing. the smell is just wonderful, with cherry, grape, plum and apple dominating a fruity aroma. there is a hint of alcohol here as well along with earthy tones. the taste is sweet, but less fruity than the smell and more focused on the earthiness in the smell, along with wood notes. alcohol is definitely present yet not overpowering. caramel, biscuit and maltiness were also hinted at throughout. this one is nice and smooth and quite easy to drink, though the alcohol does creep up on you suddenly. simply a great brew."
"Another masterpiece from my brown hooded brothers!"
"Comments  With almost zero availability here in Seattle, I was thrilled when I got this one from OldFrothingSlosh in the Christmas Beer Exchange coordinated by Richard, Mr. Big Dog himself. Thanks to the giving spirit of the BA community for giving me the opportunity to try this most excellent Trappist Ale."
"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a deep brown, with a huge frothy head that really stuck around. Lots of lace on the glass. Aroma is a complex mix, malty and sweet. Taste is as complex as the aromas. And as it warms it changes. Lots of sweetmalty goodness, nice and creamy feeling and it goes down so nice. The alcohol is nicely hidden, but makes itself known in the end. A thoroughly enjoyable experiance"
"Bottle dated 01-14-06 Poured a cloudy murky brown with small beige head and light lacing. Aroma is decadent. Malty caramel, spicy and big notes of sweet cherries. Body is full, smooth and delicate on the tongue. Possibly the most smooth ale I've experienced. The flavor of this beer is also one to savor and combined with the aroma is one that's hard to beat. That's one thing about this ale I found most impressive. The in your face aroma with the flavor is an onslought of your senses. The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass. I'm glad I finally had a chance to sample this wonder, but at a price of $13 a bottle it's one I won't enjoy often. The only downfall of this brew."
"Thick, shiny, khaki, meringue like head. Awesome l acing. Very dark brown in color with a cola hue. The smell is of dark fruits and a little grape popsicle. The taste is hard to put a finger on. There's some subdued alcohol, a lightly bitter aftertaste, a little Captain and coke? The taste isn't the flavor explosion I was hoping for, but it was interesting. The aftertaste is lightly bitter, just enough to cut the flavor. A really good beer, not quite great, especially when price is brought into the equation."
"Easy to drink because it's so good, but the large alcohol content definitely was getting to me. Not sure yet if it's worth the $7.99 for a 12 oz. bottle, but it's still pretty amazing."
"Acidy sweet finish is long and lingering with spices and plums."
"Wyll-"
"Almost to room temperature now. It's got a kick to it with the high abv. Highly complex all around. Definitely a special occasion brew at the price. This is the best Belgian strong ale I've had in my life, including a few I've had in Belgium. This Westy is, for sure, worthy of its reputation. No sediment noted, and I just drained the bottle. Keeps getting better, and leaves you with a warm feeling. Caramel aftertaste, in a good way. Whew! Quite an experience."
"Thanks to Pabobcat!"
"Westvleteren 12 is a beautiful ruby red that pours with a slight head. Nice lacing on my Chimay chalice as I sip. The nose is full of sour fruit - raisins and plums. The sour nose gives way to a very sweet taste (Belgian candi sugar), but balanced with some bready undertones. This beer could certainly get me through a fast. I'm not sure how the monks maintain their vow of silence after drinking this - all I want to do is talk about it. The body is quite light, actually, but it holds up to the ABV well and makes for a very drinkable beer. I can see how this would get better with age, as some of the residual sugars get munched on by the yeast. I think I'll have to pick up another bottle. I don't know if I am being swayed psychologically by this being the rarest Trappist beer, but it is truly amazing."
"I had been saving my Westy 12 for a special occasion, like maybe my 100th review, but I could only look at that number 1 rating so long, so I popped it.Maybe I should have waited. It looked nice enough, an exquisite brown red color, the aroma was malty sweet, with some citrus, but somewhat thin and evasive. The taste was supposed to be the thing, just send me to 7th heaven.Sorry. It was a straight malt citrus with hints of cherry. Nice enough, but simple. My cap read 08-07-06, so it appears that this beer has to sit.Just on its rep, Ill buy another bottle and let it sit"
"Drinkability: It doesn't get much better than this! A world class beer. This one goes into my top 10 for sure. If i could only find more, i would buy them all."
"The pour is a fuliginous deep cherry red color with a behemothic head, creamy in texture, and a beauteous light tan color, as the head unhastingly erodes; a splendid sheet of lace is formed to unite lovingly with the glass. Heavenly, is the word that best describes this nose, ambrosial, hints of over ripe fruit, yeast tones also noticeable along with a slight hint of alcohol, start is thickly malt, sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is pleasantly acidic, the alcohol grasp the taste buds in a Anaconda death grip, the dry vinous aftertaste lingers long after the beer is gone, but certainly not as long as the memory of this fine beer as it stays in your sub-conscience like your first kiss."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is yeasty and sour with a touch of fruitiness. WOW. An amazingly complex and excellently made beer. Full bodied. Malts are bold and flavorful. Very complex. Seems to be a different taste/flavor aspect with every sip. Fruity with raisins, plums and cherries interplaying with vanilla, chocolate and orange peel. Hides the 10.2% alcohol very well. This is one beer that is definitely worthy of all the hype/accolades it has received. Very smooth and extremely complex. Excellent beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Beer # 1100 on my personal list. Thanks to herbjones for this one."
"Not my favorte beer out there, but to say its a great beer is an understatement. A nice mohogany color which light does shine through, with a tannish head, which doesnt last long but does leave a good amount of lace. Smells, well some spices, some prunes or raisins maybe, and some faint sweet citrus. A lot of malt hits the toungue right away followed by some dry fruits (maybe those prunes or raisins i smelled) with a spice/ hop subtlety at the end, paired with some alchohol. Only one word desribes the mouthfeel.... velvet, it is rich and smooth. Great beer all around, expensive but worth it."
"A great beer? Certainly. The best in the world? Time will tell."
"First aromas are full of sweet carmel sauce, rum soaked raisans, and fruits. Some others have described the first taste it as bread pudding in a glass, that's about exactly what I experienced. rich full array of flavors. Rum soaked raisans, plums, cherries, and sweet cookie dough all wrapped up with a carmel sweet cookie. Snappy alchohol bite, some peppery fresh hop presence just for a second. Hints of honey, and freshly toasted grains. Flavors wash and soothe your tastebuds into submission. Supersmooth and rich. Perfectly charged, eases into your belly with a nice warming touch. One of the top 3 beers I have had, easily. Well worth the wait for a special occasion. I saved this one since last winter, cheers to the Belgian Bum for this treasure."
"I was actually expecting to be let down. It's the most highly anticipated beer I ever had so I though there was no chance it would be as good as others have claimed. Ok, so I was wrong. Deep garnet color with a long lasting had. Fresh plums in both the aroma and the taste. Also hints of molassass in the taste. The level of complexity is unbelievable. This beer lives up to it's expectations and that's saying a lot."
"This is a beer I searched high and low for and was very excited to finally find a single bottle sitting all by itself at a local liquor store. The flavor is exquisite and I hope to find another bottle soon."
"I'm here in Brazil doing some field work for herpetology. One of the villages, I can't pronounce the name yet alone spell it, had a large snake roaming around. My friends and I caught it and relocated it. One of the villagers offered me a beer as a reward. I said sure, expecting some Corona knockoff. It was this. Oh God, this is goooood. She poured this into a fattened wine glass. I don't know the style. Think champagne glass big enough to hold about a pint. It was a pleasant, ruddy red colour. Big head that needs some time to level down. Smelled alot of raisins, complex sugars, malt, a little alcohol, some more fruit I'm unsure of, and orange peel. Exceptional taste. The mixtures of fruit gave me a different taste every sip. The beer was served a little warmer than usual, which probably made it better. Beer aroma and taste are more pronounced when warm, and this is a very complex brew. Medium heavy mouthfeel. Only drink a few of these at a time. Drink it too enjoy it, not for the sake of drinking."
"Pulled out my new Maudite glass and poured it. Nice dark amber that sported a thin but lasting head. Very yeasty nose that was pleasant to smell. First taste was new to the tastbuds, almost velvety (not velveeta !) on the tongue. Great aftertaste. I bought the bottle for a mere $6.99 since it has been talked about so on the site. Worth every penny, and I will need to return to the only place I have seen it in NJ and buy some more. Lasting impression that I termed ""great Belgian on steroids"" to my wife. Her comments were different and interesting. She likes it also."

"Not much you can say about this beer that already hasn't been said. I just wish I lived closer to Westvletern, Belgium. I'm sure you can get it alot cheaper than the 8.50 that I had to pay. At that price I'll just save drinking this wonderful brew for a special occassion. Monks rule."
"Overall this is a really great beer. Although I feel it's a little overrated for it's $10 price tag. I'll definately have it again, and recommend giving it a try if you can find a bottle, but feel that there are other beers out there just as good or better for half the price."
"The beer is a brownish-orange color. There's a thin head at first, and a thin head it remains. Lovely aroma. It manages to be both sweet and sour at the same time. Tastes great. Very complex. A fantastic beer. And the finish is near-perfect. Smooth and clean. Slightly bitter after more sips."
"I've been waiting for this brew and it was well worth the wait!!! Poured a large, invigorating long-lasting tan head with fine-small bubbles. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass. This brew had a cloudy brown body with yeast. It had a sweet aroma to it. I could definitely taste the alcohol in this brew and was it ever good!!! I think thedm enjoyed this brew just about as much as I did! What do you say thedm??"
"I held a special party for this one. I invited 3 friends and Hotstuff to join me in a little Westy 12 sampling party. Two showed up and the third gets his sample tomorrow as well as 2 other co-workers. My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly can't get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle. This brew has to rate as one of the best beers available. It is truly a masterpiece! The high point of the tasting came from a younger gentleman who had never had a great beer before. He rated it as the best beer he had ever had. Who would have guessed! The low point of the evening was when the host offered up a couple of more beers after the Westy's. Sorry to say, he had Miller lights in the fridge! Gag! The friends rated the brew as 8-3-10-4-16 and 6-5-9-5-19 per the RateBeer rating system. They did truly enjoy the brew and stated that it was probably the best beer they had ever had. Go figure!"
"Its not quite as complex as I was expecting, but its an outstanding, amazing beer."
"As it warms, I can sometimes pick up a peppery sensation towards the middle-back of the tongue. The sweet component begins to develop a licorice bend of sorts and I'm picking up other tastes, but either they are too faint or I'm taking too long to identify them. A very enjoyable beer well worth its rank & status. I may have to go down to Party Source and drain their supply. Thanks to SheepNutz for this bottle, I owe you a couple for this one, I feel like I just drank the taste equivalent of 3 beers."
"Poured an attractive cola brown with a tight, fizzy head. There was a fair amount of sediment in the bottle, which was retained by leaving a bit of the beer unpoured. Aroma was rum soaked chocolate covered cherries. Flavor was mildly phenolic, the alcohol creeping in around the edges and a hint of burgundy wine. I kept expecting the flavor to go just a bit deeper, but it never developed, even as the beer warmed. Quite a good beer, but not head and shoulders above other good Belgians I've had."
"Certainly a beer that you have to try if you can."
"Now that I have finally downed a simple sample of this much renowned ale, I can only say...""more, please!"""
"A rare treat. Brought back from Sam's in Chicago by trbeer. The label is very spartan and doesn't advertise the mythical qualities of this beer. Enjoyed after a Rochefort 10. This is a special occasion - late night on a rare day off. I didn't quite get any special aroma until I inhaled deeply. At that point I got a whiff of grapes and bubble gum. Maybe this is unique. Beer in botle was mpale to dark brown with a two finger head. Flavor is of grapes, roasted caramel. A sip reveals fruitiness, followed by bitterness, alcohol taste, then fizz. Enjoying very late, 2AM, listening to some techno music. I'm enjoying this more than the Rochefort 10. A slight bit of hops bitterness in the beer which is nice along with the fruity taste. Drinkability is high - fairly light in body and not much stinging alcohol. Will I ever rate a perfect 5.0 beer? Let's see when I let the other bottle cellar for some time."
"I had this fabulous brew in a 11.2oz. bottle poured into a Belgian-style glass. It poured a deep brown with lots of yeast chunks and 1 finger of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is absolutely awesome, sweet and roasted, very complex. The taste has everything, some chocolate, some fruit, sweetness of toffee maybe. I really believe that my palate is too immature to really understand the complexity of this beer. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. The drinkability is a little low due to the 11%, but this really is a world-class brew!"
"What could be better? Frothy head, beautiful complex flavor. The high alcohol content is well concealed. Originally sampled 14 March 2002. Westvleteren 12 is the standard that all must measure up to. If you've not had it, go out of your way to find it. It's beautiful"
"After much contemplation on whether this beer was worth trying based on its cost alone, I decided to splurge. Abt 12 pours a deep mahogany color with a creamy, off-white head. The head retains exceptionally well. Flecks of yeast sediment abound in the dark liquid. The smell is a bit port-like, with some sweet candy present in the aroma, as well. The taste is quite strong, with notes of candy sugar, dates, dark fruit, etc. all making equal impressions. A very well-balanced brew. Almost every sip is like a unique experience. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, albeit a little less carbonated than it could be. For a beer of 10.2% abv, this one drinks dangerously easy. Although maybe not worth the price for a single bottle, this is nonetheless an excellent creation from the Westvleteren Trappist brothers. Nectar, indeed."
"I don't see how any beer could get better than this. In fact, I may change my rating to a straight 5 later. Let me think it over a little."
"This is it: With out a doubt, the best beer I have ever had. It just edges out Rochefort 10 by a whisker, although I have never tasted them side-by-side. Don't drink this cold: let it warm up a bit to get the full effect of the aroma and flavors. Makes me consider moving to Belgium and becoming a monk!"
"The beer gods have smiled down upon this brewery. Absolutely the most satisfying beer that I have ever tasted. It pours a dark and murky brown with hints of red and an impressively large head that dies down quickly. The aroma reminded me of a barley wine with a lot of fruity scents and a hint of alcohol (I'm not a fan of Barley Wines, so I was hesitant). As I poured, the aroma strangely filled the air in the room making me aware of the aroma from about three feet away - first time for such a strong aroma. The flavor was incredibly complex. The flavor is so incredibly smooth that I was in shock (considering the strong aroma) I think I notice a hint of chocolate in the taste as well as some different fruits and a couple spices. The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely smooth and satisfying. I could drink this beer all night long - although I'd probably not last more than three because of the alcohol. Again, this is THE best beer I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of the $8+ per bottle price."
"I could easily see myself drinking this again and again... and considering how easy this one is to drink, (and how strong it is,) that could be a very dangerous thing!"
"A huge thank you to AKSmokedPorter for snagging the sample for me completely on his own whim after spotting it! Thats a great beer advocate and a great friend!"
"A truly worthy beer for my 100th review and a truly amazing beer to be tasted."
"Comments: Flavors were very well blended together. The flavors however did not emerge slowly in sequence but came all at once. I enjoyed the beer, but there are others I like better that have (at least from what I perceive) a more multi-dimensional flavor profile."
"It was silky in the mouth, carbonation perfect. This was a truly great beer."
"I paid $11.39 for 11.2 oz of this stuff, and I have to question whether the expectation this price creates might be affecting ratings of the beer. Don't get me wrong, it's quite good. The pour is dark ruby with a thin, light tan head. Lots of sediment though, even when I tried to pour carefully. Aroma is slightly sweet, with hints of plum and a nutty character. Beer has a smooth body with a light, fruity malt flavor and what struck me as a very noticeable alcohol character. Malt takes on a slightly toasty character mid-palate, with hints of toffee, and the beer finishes with an earthy/herbal, and very well-blended hop flavor. Finish is slightly sugary, and very lightly dry. Good stuff, and well worth trying, but other examples of the style (Abbaye des Rocs comes to mind) provide a much better bang for the buck."
"Thanks to ElGuapo for so generously giving me a bottle of this wonderful brew, when I randomly showed up at his apartment."
"You could write a friggin book of poetry on this beer."
"Thick and hazy brown is the color, huge is the off-white head, and pleasantly fruity is the aroma. No single flavor jumps out at me. There is some major complexity in there while staying somewhat mellow all around. It's a warm kind of mellow, a fruity mellow. The alcohol is a little bit noticeable, pretty much warm really. Body is medium and there is a moderate carbonation feel. This is definitely the best Belgian ale I have had to date. I can't say it's the best beer overall, because I have so many yet to try. Anyone who is a broke college student like myself.....well you should still come up with $8 for a bottle of this. You won't regret it."
"What a great way to spend a half hour! Sampled my first Yellow Cap last night and I was not disappointed. This ale pours with a silky, creamy beige head sitting on top of beautifil toffee brown body. Belgian lace in the glass as you drink this offering is evidence of the excellent head reteniton. The nose is very malty with hints of prunes and toffee. The taste...ahhh...the taste! The taste is robustly malty with hints of raisin, caramel, toffee and chocolate. Take your time enjoying Yellow Cap because these flavors develop as the beer warms in your hand. Overall, the taste is sweetly malty with an excellent background of clove spiciness. The warming alcohol sensation only adds to the character of this ale. The finish is dry with a pleasant caramel aftertaste. a well balanced and well crafted ale. A must add to any true beer lover's collection!"
"This was my ""Holy Grail"" that I have been looking for and praise be to God that I did! When you taste something like this, you gotta feel bad for the Southern Baptist down here, becuase they either A) Can't drink alcohol or B) Can drink it, but can't tell anyone. This is proof that it is great to be a Catholic. At least something good has come from it lately. Anyways, the beer is a cloudy brown color and had a light brown head for a little bit. It's smell is that of various fruits and nuts. You can taste a hint of alcohol, but it smooths out quickly. The aftertaste is very smooth and also tastes quite fruity. I could drink this all day and night, but it's kinda on the high side for price. I guess that's the only drawback for it though. Aside from the price, all the combinations that are put into this beer, truely make this beer a heavenly experience. Praise be to God in the Highest!"
"F."
"I would highly recommend this to anyone."
"I finally got my hands on one of these, and at these prices, one is all I should have. This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that disappeared quickly leaving some circular lace. An aroma of alcohol, raisins and yeast/grains. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisin with some elements of spices. The finish is creamy and a touch sweet with elements of the alcohol. A very great belgian beer, but will need to try some others to see if this is really the best out there."
"A wonderful, world-class brew. As good as anything I've had. Every time I try it, I like it more. Yes, it's quite pricey, but costs the same as just a fairly good bottle of wine (and it's one of the top 5 beers in the world!). Probably the best body-mouthfeel of any beer I've had. CREAMY! Smooth, deep, and complex. Fruity, perfect balance. Nothing negative to say. If I could get this close to home, I'd have it (at least) once a week. As good as it gets, beer fans!"
"Murky brown pour, lots of sediment swirling about in the glass. Thick, medium lasting tan head, huge clingy bubbles initially formed on the side of the glass, then burped their way to the top, never to be seen again. Aroma filled the room with strong apple scents, with some yeast and doughy aroma coming with a more intimate sniff. Taste is strongly doughy and apple, with hints of banana, grape, plum and strong malty sweetness in there. The banana seems to come through more as it gets warmer. Slight alcohol comes through towards the end. Mouthfeel is huge, pummeling the palate with all the different luxurious flavors, feelings, and hints of alcohol."
"Pours slightly hazed brown/copper with one truly massive off-white head that is like smooth frothy foam that is very long-winded. Aromas of fruit with a sweet raison-like fragrance are quite nice. Whoa, Nellie! The taste reveals a very creamy medium bodied mouthfeel that consists of raisons, fruit, spices, light yeast, and alcohol. It finishes with a lightly sweet aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. The high ABV is not so obvious as this is a very complex and very well-done ale. Thanks to McCall for the opportunity to taste such an awesome brew! Op uw gezonheid!"
"""Gianni, sono ottimista!"""
"Deep hazy mahogany in color, huge thick creamy off white head, leaves a thick lace in the glass. Fruity, spicy, bready aroma of caremel and plums, kind of like a cake. Malty bready caremel flavors, full body, thick and creamy, silky mouthfeel, can't really even taste the alcohol, smooth and wonderfull, this is the best of the best, perfect."
"pours a murky dark brown with an sizeable tan head. the aroma is by far the most powerful i've ever experienced. ripe dark fruit and sweet malt. the mouthfeel redefines smooth....liquid silk. full, full chewy mouthfeel. the taste is a deep burnt caramel, spicy, sweet fruits and a touch of spicy hops. the finish lasts forever. i had high expectations for this beer, and i must say i wasn't dissapointed at all. it is deserving of it's reputation. this is a world-class beer that must be experienced by every beer geek. find it, drink it, love it."
"This bottle gushed upon opening, and was furiously overcarbonated. Upon pouring, the brew forms an off white head that slowly settles into a tight, well retained thin layer. Muddy, murky dark brown hue, w/ flowing aggregrates of yeast liberated from the gushing. Musty yeast, and dry, bittersweet dark chocolate upfront in aroma. As the beer breathes fruity esters of both banana and raisins emerge simultaneously with deeply caramelized sugar and mellow chocolate. Hints of cardboard from oxidation unfortunately dulls the aroma a bit. Chewy, molasses - like, heavily caramelized dark candi sugar sweetness hits the tongue at first. Sweetness then becomes dark fruit like in nature and when coupled with the mellow chocolate undertone, I am left with an impression of chocolate covered dates. Banana esters then surface along with yeast must, lending a perhaps overripe banana flavor mid palate. Hop bitterness is virtually absent, leaving an overall richly sweet profile to this brew. A true dessert in a beer! Full in body, w/ a sugary, slightly syrupy viscous mouthfeel that is appropriate considering the high strength and richness. Finishes caramelly sweet, offset by dull notes of oxidation. Alcohol warmth emerges dangerously late. Although it is clear that my bottle didn't travel well, 12 is complex and robust enough to prevent the oxidation from affecting the overall aroma and rich flavor profile significantly. Delicious! I will search out another bottle for another taste."
"400"
"One of the best dark Belgian beers I've had yet. It was perfect pour into a Westvleteren goblet with the head rising to the top of the glass when I had poured all but the last ounce leaving the yeast behind. The head dissapated to about a quarter inch and lasted to the end. Its heavenly dark malty body is offset perfectly by the tannish head. Smell is somewhat weathish with a slight tinge of bananas and chocolate. Went down smooth and creamy with chocolate, caramel, and fruity flavors of bananas and dates. First few sips were somewhat crisp and dry but as you drank more, it became sweeter but not overly sweet and the fine alcohol flavors became more pronounced. Had a nice floral hop flavor and there wasn't much bitterness, just enough dryness from the hops and alcohol to balance the sweet malt. As close as you can get to perfection in the style."
"I didn't know what to expect with this brew after receiving it (thanks to a trade from a gentleman in NYC!) and reading many reviews of it. I think it was a little too cold when I tried it, as the taste got noticeably better as I moved through the glass. Now about the taste, I honestly don't think my palate is refined enough to describe accurately what is going on here. This will be one I have to try again around beer #250 I think. There is a trail mix aroma, and the flavor is hard to pin down. If they captured this flavor in a cereal I would get up earlier every day, hints of berries, grain, nuts, chocolate. Like Willy Wonka invented it, I tasted something different with every sip. I think this would be a perfect drink with some Godiva chocolate covered strawberries. Superb!"
"Pours out to a dark, almost purple color in the glass with minimal head. Taste is that of a spiced fruit. Very wine-like in character and finish. Reminiscent of brandy as well. Enjoyable, but my palate didn't find it to be the best beer in the world."
"Probably the Best Beer in the World."
"Very dark. The color of a raisin, black except at the right angle when it turns a deep mahogany brown. Light khaki head is a creamy foam that is long-lasting. Laces the glass well. Yeasty caramel on the nose. The taste is vaguely stout-like. The richness of the flavor is very nice but not too rich to make it hard to drink. Caramel, spicy yeast and wood come out first. As it warms, more coffeeish flavor and some lactic characteristics. The beer manages to be slightly creamy and bright on the palate at the same time. Amazingly easy drinking for its strength."
"Yummmmm! This beer was one of the tastest brews I have ever had. I like Jason's Buckwheat honey aroma comment, very true. It's spicy, fruity, malty, chocolaty flavor, smooth texture and wonderful aroma, there are few that rival this beer. I had one last night as desert and had it with a chocolate macaroon, absolute perfection."
"Notes: So damn smooth, near perfection in a bottle. The alcohol at its strength does not bring down the drinkability and makes this beer so balanced in a heavenly way that it is devious for making you want more and more."
"Heavenly.  I took my reviewing cap off for this one and just simply enjoyed so I don't have a lot of descriptives here, but I recall a dominant fruit that I couldn't quite pinpoint (figs?) and an overall sweetish finish (maybe the heavy use of dark candi sugar).  As a treat every now and again, it's worth every penny."
