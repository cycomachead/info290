"Probably the best Sam Adams beer I've had."
""

"A top notch quad. Well done with this one SA"
"O - 5 - An outstanding representation of the Belgian quad style. Samuel Adam's may not hit the nail on the head every time, but sometimes they brew up some real magic, and this is no exception. HIGHLY recommended to fans of the style as well as it is recommended to be purchased in multiples and left in the cellar for a special occasion!"
""
""
"Overall one of the more interesting options from SA, an above average quad"
""
""
""
"Dark brown with a whitish head. Smells of charred oak, prunes, dates and a touch of pine resin. Wow, taste is surprisingly complex. Lots of cedar and chocolate starts off with a rich prune and port wine. A tangy bitterness of pine and grapefruit rind and blood orange tingle your tongue. A long sweetness of dried raisin lingers long with a wheat bread and yeast note in the back of the tongue. Having been to Belgium I have to say this brew (from Sam Adams of all brewers) is quite delicious.  Though for nomenclature, this is more comparable to a dubble in flavor but with the body of a quad."
"Not a typical quad. Very low esters and high on the dried fruit/fig/raisin flavors. Barrel age comes through up front. For Sam Adams this is a good beer but not what I was thinking it was going to be based on the bottle and description. Well made to be sure, but not my favorite quad."
"Raisins, caramel , toffee aroma and flavors"
""
"D/O  Drinkability is not that high since it is 10.2% alcohol and it is relatively expensive.  Overall this is a solidly brewed beer.  It may rank up there with some of my more favored beers from Samuel Adams!"

"Great American quad especially for about 8-9 dollars."

"I bought this in a Sam Adams barrel room collection 3 Pack at my local costco. This was far and away the best of the 3. It's a milky amber color, very little head while being super crisp and carbonated in the mouth.  Tastes better than it smells and it smells pretty good.  I'd buy this as a stand alone but wouldn't buy the 3 pack again."
"Pours a cloudy, brown color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Good retention and decent lacing.  Smells of alcohol, mustiness, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, earthiness, and slight spice.  Fits the style of a Quadrupel.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of alcohol, mustiness, hint of wood, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and earthiness.  Overall, average appearance, body and aroma hurt by the musty/earthy quality that is unpleasant."
"It's not a very good example of a true Belgian Quad. Label states: A Bold Belgian Quad with Rich notes of currants, raisins, and Clove, it's no wonder the taste is not of a Belgian Ale. But the taste isn't bad and the ABV is up there. I might look for this again."
""

""
""
"Remarks:  good, but a little too sweet; needs more hops to balance"
"O: I suffered from unmet expectations on this one -- i.e. it wasn't bad, just not as good as I was hoping it would be."
"Overall – A really rather nice Quad overall.  This is a quite nice and approachable brew overall that I can see most people rather enjoying."
""
"Very impressed. Definitely the best Sam Adams brew I've had so far."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle.  Served in a DFH signature glass, the beer pours a mahogany brown color with almost a couple inch creamy light tan head that stayed around for a very long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like dark fruit (plums, figs, raisins), cloves, molasses and some sweet spiciness.  It tastes like dark fruit (plum, figs, raisins), cloves, red grapes, caramel, molasses, oak and some brown sugar.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and is well carbonated.  The carbonation is soft, which helps make it easy to drink.  I thought this was a good overall brew, it's worth picking up if you've never had it before!"
"Wow!  That pretty much sums up what I think about this beer.  As usual, SA has exceeded expectations for me and this beer is outstanding!  I was expecting a good brew, not an epic one!  Very rarely will I buy multiple $10 bottles of beer, but I immediately went back to the store the next day and bought the last 7 they had.  A beautiful pour of berries and oak hit you with a tasty aroma as soon as you uncork this masterpiece.  It pours a beautiful dark ebony color, has the perfect amount of carbonation and lace without overpowering the tongue. Very smooth and not too overly sweet for being over 10% ABV and overall this is easily the best new brew I have tried in many months.  Don't let the price tag scare you away, this is a world class and very beautiful beer.  I would love to shake the brewer's hand who came up with this gem!"

"Nice Belgian base with fruity and boozy notes. Yummy."

"Pours easily with great head which settles in 5 min or so. Dark brown amber color.  Aroma of plum, raisin, sweet roasted malt. Feels med to med heavy on tongue, great carbonation and effervescence. Heavy malt flavor and slight fruit. Very sweet malty beer. Good alcohol warmth going down. At 10.2% ABV this is a slow sipping, sit down and enjoy beer. Overall a good example of a Belgium Quad although with longer aging the sweet malty flavors should mellow out a bit."

"Solid offering from SA's Barrel Room project.  Not the best quad you'll come across, but highlights the traditional richness of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Like most of the beers from the Barrel Room Collection, this is a home run.  I wish all Sam Adams beers were this good.  I typicall find their selections overrated, but not the Barrel Room beers.  This very well resembles the more expensive and exotic Belgians.  Where the Belgians are 1A, this is 1B."

"This was a good quad. I think I underrated it a bit, but it was tasty."
"O: one of the better beers I've had from BBC"
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark brown in color and nearly impenetrable to light. A quarter inch of beige head slowly diminishes to the point that it is only a trace and partially covers the top of the beer. In the aroma notes of raisins,plums, and a hint of clove are present. The flavor is much more intense than the aroma. Strong notes of Merlot,raisin,and alcohol are prominent. The alcoholic aftertaste is initially strong,but it mellows out as it warms. The mouth is fairly carbonated and sticky. I think this could have used cellaring."

"Overall it's a great beer. From the amazing smell and an overall great taste it's a good beer to start the night or finish an amazing night with."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a good example of a American made Quad and it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style with some nice balance that kept some of the aspects from being too overpowering. This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, fairly clean, rich. not too crisp, a little chewy, a little sticky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think half the bottle is a good amount for me, but I'm pretty sure I could drink a whole bottle without getting tired of it. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, I find that to be the biggest problem with these American made Quads, but this one had the balance right where it needed to be. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't a single thing that I disliked or would change about this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again, I wouldn't mind seeing how it does with a some age and I would recommend it to just about anyone who likes Quads. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I'm a little leery on some of these American made Quads, but this one proved to be pretty good with no fancy bells and whistles, it was just a straight up good Quad. When I saw them blend this beer on tv they used some of their funky beer, Cosmick mother funk and I really didn't pick up any of that in this beer. This is one of the better Samuel Adams beers I've had and it's one of the better American made Quads that I have had. Good job guys, this one was a pretty tasty Quad, keep up the good work, I'll have to try more beers from their Barrel Room Collection."
"A decent BSDA. Not off flavors but it does lack some needed depth."

""

"Final Word: Very rich, complex, and satisfying! The earthy spices, sweet, dark fruit, and buttery, bready malts all sit in great balance with each other, and present an experience similar to eating a refined, spice cake dessert. My only complaint with this brew is that the alcohol comes through a bit too much, and makes the finish a little boozy. This isn’t completely unexpected, as it is a Quad with 10.2% ABV, but masking that flavor would have made for a near perfect brew! Only avoid this one if you just absolutely can’t stand a strong boozy character; everyone else should snatch it up, especially if you love banana bread or holiday fruit cake."

"Taste / Palate: There are nice sweet malt notes throughout. It has notes of dates, raisins, black currants and sweet bready/fruitcake like goodness. It’s hops add a touch of spice and herbal bitterness on the back end. The solid 10.2% abv adds a mild boozy warming feel. This all comes on nice medium to full feeling body with smooth carbonation."

"O - For a long time a particular Belgian quad was hailed as one of the world's greatest beers. It could have been partly due to it's limited availability but I'd contest that this style is one of the hardest to replicate for American brewers because of it's deep complexity and inherent yeast characteristics. Having said that, Samuel Adam's nails the quad style with Tetravis so well, it could have come straight from Belgium. Rich maltiness provides a sturdy base while dark fruit and spice notes co-mingle with absolutely certainty; a completely brilliant beer!"

"Overall, I am quite intrigued by this beer. It really stands out to me as having some very unique flavors that I have yet to have combined into one beer. It's kind of like an American barley wine got with a Belgian yeast and got throw into a well used fruit dehydrator. I get very bored with the beers on the shelf and this one stands out to me as different."

"A musty whiff along with the sweet vermouth and roasted malt. This seems more like an authentic Belgian brew, though it has a lot of those cranky peculiarities that make it less than drinkable. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
""
"O: Exactly as described: raisins, mild spice. It's good, but kind of a letdown."
""
""
""
"The latest Samuel Adams ""barrel room"" beer comes out of the gate with all the hallmark flavors that are expected of the stronger, darker Belgian style. But as the palate searches for those distinctive intelligibles that turn good beer into great beer, Tetravis works only so hard to help the palate get there."
""
""
"The beer pours a surprisingly controlled light purplish tan head that takes a while to dissipate but does not leave much lacing. The beer itself is a dark purple but is clearly filtered. The beer color also has some light ruby notes. The beer smell is pretty standard and nothing special. Dark fruits and brown sugar. The smell also has strong yeast notes. The taste is the same but a bit more distinct with dark fruits such as plums and sugar with a slight sweet boozy taste. The bready yeast is also noticeable and works better in the taste than the smell. The beer is heavy-bodied and thick and very little carbonation. Overall, a decent quad but there are better ones out there."
"Overall: Ok beer, well crafted. But not my first choice for a beer personally."

"An okay example of a quad, but not one I would revisit."
""
""
"O: Not bad. The first sip is strange, but it balances out nicely after. With just a bit more in the way of defined flavor, it could genuinely be a great quad. In certain aspects, though, I liked it better than the oak-aged quad I had after this (Boulevard BBQ)."
""
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, viscous, with plenty of heat stabbing the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is kind of a trickster. It's very smooth and mild on the palate and then it has a huge smack of flavor on the swallow. Overall, not a bad beer but I think there are better representatives of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Excellent. Tetravis is a fine example of why I love quads. Recommended."

"Overall a good, straightforward, no-nonsense quad."

"Overall: This is a winner I highly reccommend, one warning be careful I shared this with a friend and we were kicked in the backside before the night started."
"Overall: Very good beer but can think of a few others I would rather have around this price range that are also a quad. It does give you a little bit of everything just lacks that potency you are hoping for after first gulp."
""
""
"O: quite good overall, and excellent price point. I would purchase again"

"this beer pours a really great auburn color. nice lace on the glass. the smell is rich with dark fruit- there is also a tinge of tartness. i get different flavors with each sip- fruits, a little smokiness, a little tart. there is also a slight dry alcohol burn- but in a good way. there is a bold warmness about this beer that i like. over all a complex and interesting brew."

"Checked my review when having the beer again and it is dead on. Excellent beer that I am glad that I picked up quite a few of to stick in my basement."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, 2013 bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, molasses, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, toast, brown bread, molasses, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, molasses, candi sugar, clove, pepper, herbal, floral, light oak, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent quadrupel style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, candi sugar, and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall, this beer exceeded my expectations coming from Sam Adams. It definitely lacks the depth and refinement of some Trappist beers but honestly for the price, it is really hard to beat this."
""
"Pours a cream, three-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and Belgian yeast nose, and flavor is sweet dark fruit. High ABV is hidden. $9.99 for a 750ml bottle from Madden Beverage Saco, Me."
"Pours a hazed light brown color. Aroma of sweet malts, fruit and Belian yeast. In the taste, bready, doughy malts, brown sugar, raisin. A light bitterness rounds out the brew. Given the strength, the alcohol is not noticeable. Has a powdery, estery yeast character. Medium bodied, well carbonated. Overall, a decent strong ale but lacking punch and depth. The oak dries it out just enough."
""
"Drinkability is ok. Rich flavor with well hidden ABV. But so rich, and not particularly elegant."
""
""
"O/D - No real alcohol evident. Started out a bit tame but became quite enjoyable and drinkable. Tasty stuff."
""
""
"Tetravis has many unconventional elements for a Quad (being barrel-aged, blended with a sour ale, fermented with champagne yeast) but it actually compares quite favorably with the style's best and most time-honoured examples. I mean, between this and, say, Rochefort or St Bernardus there's no contest, but, credit where credit is due, this fares better than most American brands."
""
"The fruit almost stands out too much. But as I keep sipping I'm liking it more and more"
"Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 1/25/14"
""
""
"Pours a clear dark honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, banana, spice, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, toast, and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a really nice smell but the flavors are a bit too boozy in my opinion."

"Pours a lightly hazy orange amber color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. The aroma is huge on the tart current with hints of clove and raisin. Moderate amount of dark sugary malt as well as a far to present hit of papery oxidation. The flavor is heavy on the clove and pepper with a moderate amount of sugary sweetness. Tart currant as well as bits of lemon and orange and like the aroma a bit too much oxidation. Medium to thick body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Meh, another letdown from the Sam Adams barrel room. Oxidized and a bit spicy for my liking."
""
"D: This was a surprisingly good beer. The scent and taste were fairly complex and enjoyable. The body was great, and the finish was really smooth, so it was easy to drink. Would probably age well, but doesn't need it. Solid brew, although I wish it had a little more barrel character."
""
""
"Excellent aroma. The wood doesn't stand out but is layered underneath the fruit and malt. There's noticeable bitterness that almost clashes with the alcohol. It would get in the way if it were any stronger but really helps with the sweetness. Pretty good for an American made Quad."
"O - Not quite as good as their New World Tripel, but another Belgian well executed by Sam Adams. Complex taste, extremely drinkable. I've had better Belgian's, but I've also had worse Belgian's that cost a lot more. So in other words, excellent brew, and worth the $."

"Tetravis is an impressive quad that generally hits the mark for the defining features of the style. While Sam Adams has never really nailed any of the big styles, they already produce good beers at good price points."
""
""
"O - Not a huge fan of these styles, but for BBC its decent, nice complex flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh"
""

"This is a winner for Sam Adams plain and simple. It isn't my style or what I'd want, but if you want to blow a wine snob away, this is another option."
""

"large three finger frothy head with good lacing on a very nice clear amber with maroon hues body. The beer actually looks very impressive. Aroma of plum, sour cherries, banana bread, caramel, spices (cinnamon), Belgian yeast. Flavor is a little disappointing after the aroma but still nice although the fruitness covers up some of the Belgian character. Flavor notes include, plum, raisin, currant, caramel, red wine. This one is fairly sweet too. Thin for the style, moderate carbonation. I felt the look and aroma couldnt be lived up to by the flavor. One of the better ones of this series for sure though."
"Overall: Pretty solid quad and reasonably priced too. Enjoyable and would get it again."
""
"Overall: Nice and fruity quad. Complex. I would get this one again. It may be my favorite in the barrel room collection."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is a great combination of malt, fruit, bitter, sweet, and wood components. Peaty and fruity with a little savory spice. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice Quad, not much barrel age aspects here, but not completely MIA. I would possibly buy this again, seems like it would age great; like the complexity on display already. Drinks easy for the heft & style"
""
"The taste is sweet malt forward with a quick eruption of pepper and hops finishing it off. The alcohol could have been a little more subdued but it reminds me to take it easy. I found it to be a nice offering from Samuel Adams."
""
""
""
"Overall: not a home run, but a nice tasty take on the style."
"O: This is a definitely an impressive take on the quad style by Jim Koch and company. One of the better American versions for sure. BBC/SA take a lot of slack from many people on here, and it leads to a lot of their brews being underrated (at least IMO). This one here is a winner, and in a style that in generally fairly difficult to pull off. Great job and great brew!"
