"Unlike other bourbon-barrel aged beers, Blasphemy never becomes too ""booze-y.""  This is still definitely rooted in the Belgian Quadrupel style, with the aging merely adding just a bit of heresy  (if you'll pardon the pun.)  A very nice example of a strong-style beer from a brewery that seems to be making such ales their trademark."
""
""
"Blasphemy has a bourbon, sherry, over ripe fruit and oak nose with traces of light caramel and vanilla. It pours hazy tea brown over a thin wisp of a head. It enters with sticky sugar and a little oily growing quickly to big fruity alcohol flavors, sherry, bourbon and a little alcohol heat on the finish. A big, balsy, full bodied beer with average carbonation."

"Overall: I had this a bit sooner than I otherwise would've out of fear of infection, of which there was absolutely no hint. I found this completely delicious and very enjoyable, and certainly holds its own against BBQ, 5 Monks, or Not the Stoic. Not in my personal top tier of BA offerings only because it's a bit one-dimensional, but for the style, it ticks all the boxes, and does so with some panache."
"Beautiful pour. Fluffy thick head that holds well. Unique quad smell of oats and bourbon aging. Taste is smooth and clean, not overwhelmingly alcoholic. An amazing beer that I highly recommend. If you come across Blasphemy, grab it before it goes!!"
""
"O- This is another massive and massively enjoyable offering from Weyerbacher. The more I contemplate, if a Manhattan and a Belgian Dark Ale produced offspring, Blasphemy would be the result. Weyerbacher knows big beers and their barrel-aging program is sadly overlooked with Blasphemy topping the list. What's more, the value for a beer of this magnitude is ~$8/bottle and cannot think of a better BBA beer for that value. Now, if they Barrel-Aged Tiny and Merry Monks as well, I just may not seek out another brewery. (5.0)"

"Strange Quad. Nutty on the nose (with banana?), just like you'd expect. But the middle is sour: grapefruit, granny smith apples, hint of raisins and nuts. And then the after is sour and a bit bitter with hops but not overpowering. It's a very interesting beer and definitely worth drinking, but the sourness is a little much and I'm not sure I'd buy it again."
"Very smooth and high abv is well hidden. Lots of raisins and bread pudding flavors. Loved it."

"Over all the price is cheap 8$ lot of alcohol not my cup of brew, the booziness is overpowering hiding the quality of the beer also felt there was too much residualsweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy yet some of that is hidden by the excessive amount of residual sugar. After drinking some of this I could not tell if I was drunk or on a sugar high..."

"Real good"
"This is an iffy style for me, but I enjoyed the flavors, and enjoyed the subtle complexities in the beer.  The beer had an unexpected thinness (watery feel) too it, more noticeable as it warmed, but that was ok.  On the other hand, the complexities mellowed as well, and since the style and ABC in general would make it a sipping beer for me, this prevented it from a higher rating."

"Bottle poured at Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Pours a lighter amber color, mostly clear, with a creamy off white head on top. Smells like nearly straight neat whiskey booze and not much else here, maybe some extra sweetness from the malts. Flavor is a bit harsh with sweet candi sugar, light spices, some caramel, vanilla, and lots of straight phenolic booziness. Body is medium, not standing up to the barrels, with low to medium carbonation. Overall this was a bit hot for me, with the whiskey masking the nice hearty sweet flavors from the quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty good. Like many 'Murican quads, it lacks that special something to rise it up to Belgian standards - and not even barrel aging can change that. I definitely think it's worth a try, though. I mean, it's pretty well priced as far as a barrel-aged beer goes, just don't expect brilliance."
""
""
"Overall not bad, but needs 3+ years to calm and cool down."
"O - A sipping beer for sure, Weyerbacher demonstrates its talents with maltier ales and lives up to what a Quadruple should be. Definitely not an everyday beer, heavy and rich for the holidays."

"750mL bottle. Pours a murky brown with a half inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is ripe bananas, bubble gum and cloves. Not really smelling any of the Whiskey. The taste is really where the Whiskey Barrel flavor comes out. Banana, yeast, coriander, vanilla, cinnamon and cloves. Booze at the end with some woody notes and more of the banana. Whiskey finish. Lots of carbonation. It's an interesting mix of the Whiskey flavors and the typical Belgian characteristics. Pretty decent price too. Overall, intriguing beer I'd grab again."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty solid beer overall, and very reasonably priced. I'd like a bit more Belgian flavor and aroma, but the whiskey rules. Still, what's there is good."
"Overall: definitely like this. Definitely expect to be feeling this bottle later on."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would like to try the base beer before it is aged in bourbon barrels for a comparison. Either or and they both would be awesome."
""
"Overall: This is an outstanding beer."

"Weyerbacher always does magical things when they oak age any of their brews. The only thing I see any setbacks with this brew is the appearance. This is ""too clean"" to be a Quad. It might be from me grading it on the first half (Since this is the 750ml Corked and Caged.) I was looking forward to an ugly brew, yet I found a clean Quad. Other than the appearance, I found this to be enjoyable."
""
"O - next spring, I will buy a dozen of these. Really outstanding, a great experience, highly recommended."
""
""
"Overall: Another solid beer from Weyerbacher. Strays away from a traditional quad, but still a really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a reddish brown with a white sand head. Left a little cap and ring. Pretty good for a barleywine. On the nose vanilla, butterscotch, prunes, brown sugar and caramel. Smooth oak, vanilla, brown sugar and candi sugar. While there is plenty of spicy, bourbon bite it's quite mellow. Mouthfeel is very warming with low carbonation. Body is just a bit thinner than expected. Overall, solid bourbon barrel quad. A good deal for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: really impressed with this brew from weyerbacher. this and their Insanity are two top notch bourbon barrel aged brews imo. got another one in the cellar, should be really good in about a year after some of the heat has perhaps dissipated. ill report back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps the most enjoyable brew I've had from Weyerbacher. A marked improvement on the base quad and a good value for a barrel aged beer. This will certainly be a repeat purchase for me."
""
"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/9/2013. Pours moderately cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, pear, plum, clove, pepper, oak, caramel, candi sugar, toffee, bourbon, molasses, light vanilla, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big pear, apple, plum, raisin, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, pepper, candi sugar, molasses, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark/light fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, pepper, candi sugar, brown bread, herbal and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark malt, and bourbon barrel flavors; with big robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barrel aged Quadrupel style. All around great complexity and balance of malt, yeast ester, and barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable sipper."
"87/100"
""
""
"I was really excited for this beer when I bought it. A barrel aged quad mmmm. It pours a beautiful redish gold color with about a half inch head. Smell is strong bourbon with notes of fruit like plums, figs, orange and maybe a little banana. Mouthfeel is good. Not overly carbonated with a smooth finish. Taste is sweet. Just sweet. I couldn't get past the sweetness to really taste anything else. There a strong bourbon aftertaste but it's just way too sweet. Had trouble finishing it honestly. I was disappointed with the taste."
""
""
"I love the smell. It has a fruity smell and makes me want to drink it."
""
""
"Bottle from Proof Bottle Shop. Pours a hazy brown with a tinge of red. Cream colored head that lasted pretty well. Collar persistedthroughout the entire bomber. Aroma is mostly fig, and red grape with lots of molasses and whiskey booziness to it. Taste is almost the exact same but with some vanilla and cherry as well. Mouthfeel is enjoyably boozy. The booziness that detracts from the taste and smell is airy and pungent on the tongue. I'm glad I've got a few more of these for this winter and next winter. I'm hoping the booze subsides and morphs into something else."
"O: Very nice brew especially if you like a stronger ABV with some sweetness. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I wished it was in 12 oz bottle to make smaller portions easier."
""
""
""
"O- I know this beer is almost 12% ABV, but the alcohol isn't hidden too well. This is the only thing preventing this beer from being really good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a strong, boozy and sweet beer. A little to sweet and boozy for my tastes but if you like a beer ages in whiskey barrels this is a good one to try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer that's definitely on the sweet side (a lot of quads are too sweet for my taste -- this one is borderline). It could use a stronger whiskey and/or hop presence, but it's still a complex, enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really big Quad, really boozey. I'd be curious what a little time could do to it."
""
""
"This is great it's kind of like a low abv bourbon boilermaker. The bourbon flavors and aromas are extremely prevalent. They mingle well with the Belgian yeasty flavors ones would expect from a quadruple. This is perfect harmony, the hops keep the sweet bourbon flavors in check while the malt is all smooth and graceful. Alcohol is a little strong on the nose but it's well hidden on the tongue. This was only 9$! For a something that is aged 2 years they could easily charge more but they don't! You have to try this if you like beer and you like bourbon."
""
"O: This beer is boozy as all hell, predictably. Not bad though. Let it warm up."
""
""
""
""
"A real powerhouse quad, pretty good but not fantastic. Definitely worth trying and Weyerbacher rarely disappoints, but there are some other Quads I'd take before this and definitely other offerings from Weyerbacher I'd go for. But I will enjoy finish this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a dark reddish color (nice when held up to the light) with a thin head of khaki foam. The aroma is really nice with big notes of plum, raisin, cinnamon, vanilla, wood and bourbon. Very inviting. The flavor is very sweet with sugar, plums, alcohol, caramel, wood and a lot of vanilla in the finish. Warming and fruity with some cinnamon, but a bit too sweet in the finish for my tastes."
""
""
"Overall-Better than most beer with such a high ABV. The sweetness manages to prevent it from being too overwhelming but I will probably stick to Tripels and Dubbels in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really great Quad."
"Poured on the warm side too long out of the fridge with a smallish, somewhat fizzy, tan head and no lace. Color is a clear orange amber brown with no bubble trails. Aroma is malt, sherry, dark ripe fruit, with a little oak and vanilla. Flavor's much like nose with sweet front and center, tapered with some bitter and a tiny bit of tang. Body is good, full and round, true to style, but carbonation is a little soft. Finish is like flavor, lingering, and has no off characteristics although the alcohol give only the barest hint of the power. Good beer, but a little does go for a distance."

""

""
""
"It's a boozy beer with a bit of caramel. It's not deep in its flavor with low carbonation. It almost tastes like a barrel aged doppelbock if anything. Definitely a sipper and lacks sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Big and boozy but far superior to the 12 oz capped bottle being much richer and more flavorful."
""
""
""
""
"O: having had their ""Quad"" quadrupel, I find this to be very similar, but with the additional of barrel aging, which produces that tell-tale whiskey barrel flavor overlay - certainly serves the beer well - a bit better than their Quad, but again, I find the beer to be good, but without the benefit of anything to really demand your attention."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It’s not like any quad I’ve ever had. This reminds me of sipping a class of scotch. Definitely to be enjoyed slowly with some friends."

"Nice appearance. Opaque, murky, wonderful brown. Aroma? Yes this has it, previously mentioned. Insane, lovely whiskey, like the Crown Royal I've been sipping on since Christmas. Taste, yes it's got that too, fruits, whiskey, vanilla, oak, wood, sweets, apples, pears and cherries with a wonderful, exquisite bitter tart finish with more sweetness. Like a Slam Dunkel on steriods. Probably why I like this beer so much, the recently retired Dunkel was always a favorite. I will seek this one out again, as in today, its pretty damn good, at a great price for barrel aged deliciousness. Weyerbacher killing it, as always."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great interpretation of the style, but I much prefer a straight up quad to one thats been aged in bourbon/whiskey/scotch barrels"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A boozy but not overpowering beer--I wish there was more of a barrel presence but it's a really nice beer nonetheless"

"M&D&O - too much burn for a high mouthfeel score, some decent fruits and sweet malts underneath the 11.8%. gets better as it warms in my glass. Though maybe I put too much age on this one, but I think its ok quality wise, a decent quad, but won't compare to the European versions of course, but apporaching benchmark for American versions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This one sat in the cellar for close to a year, but this one has a bit too much heat... Bourbon barrel aging can either add nuance or overpower and distract from the rest of the beer... Unfortunately it serves as a big distraction and creates a lot of unpleasant noise for an otherwise solid offering... I'll take the standard version (Weyerbacher Quad) any day of the week..."
""
"About as nice a bourbon barrel quad as you might ever ask for (Hardywood Park Bourbon Cru, anyone)? Really outstanding."
"O: Well done beer and one of my favorites of the year so far it can stand up to a good belgian quad. It will also please your palate now or stand up to some good cellaring for later."
""
""
""
"O-Poor balance, alcohol head, this beer was not that good, and it had been aged for a few months. Was expecting better."
""
""
""
""
""
" O - I don't drink too many Quads, but this was pretty good. Maybe a bit hot with the alcohol, but other than that, I enjoyed the complexities of this beer."
""
""
""
"Very nice. A touch too much booze, but great flavor. Nice and sugary, true to style."
""
"O: I had high hopes and was a total let down. I've never had a purple beer that I can recall and was just too sweet for me. Definitely something different and unlike any other Quad I've had before."
"O- I held on to this for a few months but it's still pretty hot and messy. I would say that I should have let it go even longer, but then the carbonation would have faded even more when it's already lacking in that area. I think I just prefer the Quad (which is the base beer of this aged offering) in its original form."
"O- ok BA quad. A little thin and dry, with less sweetness and barrel character than I would like."
"O: I wanted to be blown away by this beer. I was not. It's still a solid, tasty brew, but nothing mindblowing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Has this strange flavor quality that I have found in other Weyerbacher beers that I can't really describe very well. Comes together a little better as it warms up. Not the most amazing quad, and definitely not the best bourbon barrel aged quad. Yet it is worth another look at again in the futre. I will definitely start the bottle quite a bit warmer than I did this one."
""
"Good stuff. I never got a chance to try their QUAD, so I can’t compare as far as the differences the barrel aging brings, but a very nice and unique Quad in its own right. Pretty sweet, even for this style and may be a little tough to make it through the 750ml on my own. Monstrous beer, too. Every bit of the 11.8% ABV...this sucker will give you the hiccups and put you to sleep..."
""
""
""
""
"This was a little better than what I was expecting from the reviews. It is big and warm, but the flavors are very good. Goes to show you need to make up your own mind."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent sipper but can be a bit over-powering and there are better choices within in the style."
""
"But, beyond that, this blasphemer is damnably delicious. I'd be best off with a smaller sample maybe, or share with friends, but I had to take this one down by myself. I've got probably eight ounces to go, and it's getting louder in here, boom-boompbbom-boom."
""
""
"O - Not too impressed but I am not a quad expert to begin with. Barrel aging helped calm things down a bit, but I would recommend the cellar treatment for a year or 2."
""
"Overall –A wonderful sipper with some big flavor. Sit, sip, chat with a good pal, and enjoy. It’s delicious."
""
""
"I poured from a bomber(2012) into a snifter. The pour is murky, decent head, nice lacing. The aroma is boozy, fruity, bourbon. The taste is boozey, lots of dark fruit, hints of bourbon, the finish is boozey. The body is full, alcohol is very noticeable, good carbonation. A good quad, bourbon barrel should have added more. Perhaps some more time in the bottle would add more."
""
""
""
""
"O: It probably won't win any awards. It won't generate hype or have beer geeks sweeping it off the shelves. In fact, at the end of the day, it's a pretty average bourbon barrel aged quad. Not very complex, and a little rough around the edges. A touch hot, but not quite enough to be offensive. But at $8 for a 750ml bottle, I feel as though I got my money's worth. Maybe I'm just in a 'glass half full' kind of mood today."
""
""
""
"O. This is a hard style, but I think Weyerbacher is near the top here. This is a little astringent and dry due to the boozy finish. The nose, though, is excellent and the flavors are well rounded. Very good example of a BA quad here."
""
"3.5 D: This is a tasty beer, but it can't compare to the subtlety driven quads out of Belgium. While the bourbon makes this a fun change from the usual, it's not something I'd come back to again and again."
""
""
"Overall - These are my guilty pleasure. Giant, boozy, sugar bomb quads. I know it's not what a great quad should taste like (I love those, too), but it's still like drinking candy."
"O: This is a tasty brew, although it reminds me of a barley wine more than a quad. I think it needs a little more to balance the sweetness. This is a sipper, for sure. Give it a go."
"O: This was a decent beer - a sipper, to be sure. But I wouldn't pick it up all the time. Definitely not overly impressed."
""
"O: A solid example of an American-brewed barrel-aged quad. The barrel merely compliments the solid base beer. A nice sipper, and one that should age very nicely"
"Skål!"
""
"Overall- One of my favorite bourbon barrel aged beers. Putting a few away for aging. Should get better with time, another great beer for wheyerbacher."
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. Solid copper color with a decent two finger head. Fusel alcohols and belgian sugar in the nose. The favor is too sweet; there are a bunch of unfemented sugars in there. A sipper to say the least. Big malt body and little to no hop pressence. carbonation is fine for the style, but I would compare it to an old ale or old stock ale more than a quad. Not a friend of this brew."
"Overall: a big pleasant surprise. I expected a passable quad. Very nice."
"Overall I really like this beer. Sure it doesn't have a ton of dark fruit character but it is a great high ABV quite that hides it quite well. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"While it's no Insanity (I would say Weyerbacher proved themselves barrel aging masters with the recent Insanity batch, of which I've bought about a case already and will buy more until it disappears from stores), it's a tasty beer at a great price."
"overall, this one is decent. i'm enjoying it although i'm by no means wow-ed. worth a try. as a sidebar, it's getting to the point where to me there should be two separate styles: belgian and/or trappist quad vs. american/elsewhere. there are some tasty renditions within the latter category but i've yet to find anything that can approach the powerhouses that reside under the banner of the former."
""
""
"O: Pretty decent American Quad actually."
""
"A nice Quad flavor blends smoothly with whiskey barrels."
"Really good flavors, it's pretty sweet and fruity for a quad but it melds very well with big bourbon flavors. May pick up one to age."
""
"Blasphemy is one of the aces in Weyerbacher's deck. Looking at past reviews and thinking about past drinks, I have to concede to the fact that Weyerbacher is one of my favorite all-time breweries. They do great things, and then, they do not-so-great things surprisingly well. I'd have to be one broke mofo if I see this on a shelf and DON'T pick it up. Another notch in the belt for Weyerbacher, I'm sure, as they must know they're killing it."
""
""
""
"Smooth and much lighter bodied then expected. Super fruity and complex. Dark fruits, raisins, currants, rolls into this sweet vanilla infused berry marmalade as the oak takes over. Bourbon comes through just enough to let you know it's there, sweet belgian candi sugar notes make a suprise appearance on the back end. Finish consists of a drying touch of oak making this one of the smoothest Quads, Bourbon Barrel Aged Beers, and above 11% abv brews I've ever had. Go wyerbacher, this beer is ready to drink and one of weyerbachers cleanest tasting offerings yet."
""
""
""
""
"afterthought: it kind of tastes like a whiskey and coke with crappy whiskey, so still not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is sweet enough to be a dessert beer. This might work in small quantities, but gets tiring after more than 6oz."
"Overall, this was a “meh” beer for me, seemingly average for the style; I've had worse and better. With almost a year on it, I had hoped the EtOH would have died down a bit more as there seems to be a solid flavor profile lurking in the background. I just wished it had thickened up a bit and brought the intended flavors to the forefront more. Still, another new brew to me that I'm happy to have tried!"
"M: nice, creamy, well-balanced"
"O Hard call this a quad, but its a pretty nice beer. Pretty hot, will save my other bottle for at least a year."
""
""
""
"D/O- Very intoxicating, high drinkability considering the ABV. Every here enjoyed it. Right up there with Boulevard's offering as the best bourbon barrel quad that I've had. Thanks a bunch MaxSpang!"
""
""
"This was an interesting beer, I could definitely tell the barrel aging added some vanilla flavor and probably some booze. I think this might have been a little better with some age on it to better meld the alcohol. Maybe I'll pick up another bottle to do that."
""
""
"Weyerbacher continues to impress me. What an awesome brewery!"

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a Dogfish Head Signature glass, the beer pours a murky brownish/red color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is very nice, it smells like dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, sweet apples and some brandy. The taste is pretty much like the aroma, the brew tastes like dark fruit (raisins, plums, figs), caramel, bourbon, vanilla, oak, booze and candy sugar. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and thick with low carbonation. I think this is a good beer overall. And for just $7.99 a bottle, I'd definitely buy this again, it's certainly a bargain for the price."

"I am very impressed with this quad, I believe it's my first of this style. Very unique, strong and definitely a sipper. I am glad I stored this in my closet for about five months to soften the alcohol blow -- I learned my lesson from Weyerbacher's TINY -- not to drink it right away."
"And yet, I do..big punch of booze to start out with waves of dates, figs, and plums. Still bringing some heat after all these years, but it does manage to get down. The heat refuses to die the entire glass, a constant reminder of the likely damage being done inside my body. Hot mouthfeel that tingles and burns in a way that I feel a bit uncomfortable about. Like watching porn with your uncle. No, your uncle."
"Weyerbacher Blasphemy pours hazy, and is somewhere between brown and maroon. There are very nice light red highlights shining through. The bone colored head is barely there, fades quickly, and doesn't leave a stitch of lacing. A disappointment all around, although I do have to cut the beer just a little slack on this count due to the prodigious alcohol level. The barrel aging is readily apparent in he aroma. Notes of caramel and vanilla immediately jump out, before fading in with some dark berry and fruit smells. The nose is balanced in equal measure by a spicy phenolic character and a warming bourbon and boozy note, which could stand to be a little more subdued. The flavor works off that blueprint, but dials up the alcoholic heat and bourbon even a bit more The plum and raisin flavors up front don't seem as dark and intense as they normally are. The peppery phenols are there, but largely drowned out by the hot alcohol aspect of the beer. The body is somewhat full (though also somewhat dried out for a 12% beer) and nicely creamy. It's aided by an expansive, yet subdued carbonation. I had high expectations for Blasphemy, as I think Belgian style beers do better in bourbon barrels than a lot of brewers realize, and I think Weyerbacher does some great barrel aging (Heresy, and especially Insanity). This one though, was definitely a bit underwhelming. I chalk it up more to the base beer than the barrel aging."
"Overall this could have sat for a while. The 11.8% ABV acts like a watered down liquor on the throat. There are some great aromas but the taste is just very under ripe."
"Cheers."
"Overall: While still a little on the sweet end, it is amazing how much better the barrel-aging made this beer."
"Overall, it is enjoyable, and definitely a sipping beer. Big full nose and taste. I particularly liked how they integrated the bourbon barrel without it overpowering the other flavors."
"Overall: All in all, I don't really care for it. I do quite like some aspects of it though-- the raisiny and yeasty smells/flavors are good, and the barrel aging seems to have done the beer well. However, like the regular QUAD, this thing is a hot, boozy, mess."
"Pours a cloudy light copper with a huge head and sticky lace. Smells of candy, apples and mild spices. Taste is massively fruity, lots of fresh apples, raisins, mild mulled spices, just a bit of alcohol, candy sugar and a hint of dark caramel. Feels dense yet a bit fizzy. Overall a nice quad and it pairs well with cheese."
"Overall a nice brew if your in the mood for sweet and mellow."
"Overall - This beer is intimidating to say the least, when you look at the bottle they have the raven and a cross for a reason. When you read 11.8abv it will scare you, and we were scared .... yes I cried a little. However, the feel, the taste, and the overall appearance lead this to be a very good example of a Quad... although this is released seldom get your hands on this and give it a try."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and full on the tongue. This bottle definitely benefited from about 6 months of age, as the harsh boozy tones mellowed out and allowed the fruit and oak flavors to shine through. I'm glad I have another bottle or two."
"o - if you like whiskey or scotch, i think you will really really like this beer. it is very bold in its alcohol content and it comes through in the smell and the taste without holding back. it is balanced out with a little bit of fruit."
"O: I think I've had this bottle for a while but I really like this beer, in a strange way."
"A very good quad from Weyerbacher. Love the style and this one definitely holds it's own."
"O: This is the first Quad that I have really enjoyed."
"A lot of nice things going on but just too boozy to be thoroughly enjoyed."
"Very good stuff here, nice balance and flavors."
"o-very nice quad. another weyerbacher beer not meant for anything but sipping, savoring, and enjoying. this is a good beer to have cold or room temperature. ours was cold and as the night went on it came to room temp and we all notices that more flavors released as it came up to temp."
"2011 bottle poured into Chimay goblet. Pours a murky brown with a reddish tone. Small white head that reduces to the glass edge. Smells of sweet caramel, fruit and alcohol. Tastes of sweet banana and other dark type fruit at first. No denying there's lots of belgian yeast. Oak and vanilla flavors as well. Very complex and lots going on, but flavors are short lived due to the booziness that follows immediately after. Medium bodied with little carbonation. Truthfully, had a hard time finishing. I would definitely share AND age the next one, to mellow out that alcohol burn. This could be a high rating beer at the right age, especially for the price."
"O: This is a nice, rich & sweet sipper. Very complex with a lot of sweet notes; some of which I can't decipher. Nicely done oak-aging. Weyerbacher did this one just right."
"Overall this is a really satisfying beer, with a great value, though I couldn't drink it very often."
"Notes: Maybe not a brew for the ages, but in general they do their barrel aging fairly well. In a soft, almost subdued manner that actually works pretty well. This is a quality and nice take at aging a US quad and worth the occasion."
"I've had this once before, and really enjoyed it. Here goes. Pours a very dark brown, almost a mud color, into my tulip glass. Smell is strongly of alcohol (I don't remember that from last time), some fruit, like raisins or, hell, I don't know. The taste is somewhat sweet, with a slight fruitness. There is definitely a noticeable alcohol burn as an aftertaste, but that's not a bad thing here. I dig it. This beer is thick and creamy. A lot going on here. I will get another couple of these soon. At under $7 for a 750 mL bottle, this beer is a steal."
"O - A very tasty brew, and a good value from one of my favorite breweries. Glad they brought this one back so I could try it. The base Quad is one of the best (if not the best besides Three Philosophers) of the American style and I am glad the barrel aging helped make it a more striking beer."
"O - Barrel is well integrated, more oak than bourbon, and was a great beer to get to have. Really looking forward to how aging works this one out."
"O - Overall a good beer. I like my barrel aged beers with a lot of barrel This has the sweetness and the barrel character bt a touch too sweet."
"All in all, Im glad Dan made this again, it gives me another tick and it shows what chops the brewers in Easton have. I don't think this spent a whole lot of time in the barrels, but enough to keep the bourbon from overpowering the base quad. I'd drank it again."
"O- well integrated barrel profile and nicely done over all but a bit overly sweet are rough around the edges. I'm going to bet with some time down this would be amazing."
"Overall impression - a bit too hot and almost too sweet but the complexity trumps out in the end."
"Overall: I would buy again, it is a good beer to sip and enjoy slowly."
"O - At first I was disappointed with this one, but as it warmed and the flavors and aromas opened up it became quite good."
"O - Tasty quad. Not up to the level of some of the frontrunners but I enjoyed this one. Would definitely like to have it again."
"A great beer. I need to buy another to age."
"Lighter body, carbonation is pretty low. This is a bit hot, and has some amazing cellar potential. Very well made."
"Overall great beer, nice bourbon and whisky flavors, nice oak rounding, great malts and sweet syrups, and hint of fruit and bitterness, a nice aged taste too. The aging did this very well as the booze quieted down, the malts aged nicely, and the bourbon stayed a nice flavor but not too hot."
"O- A very nice brew from Weyerbacher that I will definitely look for again. Not quite world class, but I really enjoyed it. Just a touch away from 4.5 in a lot of areas. Cheers."
"Drinkability/overall- this beer to me was extremely drinkable because the alcohol is so well hidden and the flavor was just so yummy, i already was big fan in the past of the weyer quad but this takes it to and all new level, really happy i made this purchase and will probably seek out a few more bottles, to me this is another example of how much i love and how well done barrel age beers can be when done right, in the words of borat ""great success"""
"The huge flavor makes me a fan, as does the $8 price tag for a 750. Such a flavorful and well priced beer, I will be getting more for sure."
"O: This seems to be lacking refinement. Perhaps if it was laid down for a few years it would smooth out. Right now it's too hot, and carbonation is a little rough. I originally wrote that it might help to throw it in a barrel for a while, then realized once it warmed up that they had done exactly that. Maybe let it sit for a while longer... Jus' Sayin'."
"O: Very well done and I'm glad I have a few more of these to enjoy over the next few years. Definitely worth a try if you like Barrel Aged Quads."
"Overall- At $9 for a 750 of a barrel aged quad, this is a great value. I would recommend this beer pretty much on that alone, however it is a very tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Overall its good, would love to see what some more time would do to this one."
"D: Overall, a nice bourbon aged quad that i would have no problem going back for another bottle or two. I really enjoyed the boozy presence and enjoying the bottle over the course of a couple hours"
"This beer pours as a brownish copper color with not much head on it. The alcohol must kill it off right away. The appearance isn't too bad but it's not great either. The aromas are boozey and doesn't have a whole lot more to be said other than some malts in there and a little wood from the barrel aging. The taste is strong with alcohol and hasn't got much of the elements of a good Quad, It's missing complexity on this level, not really sure why. The mouthfeel is a little light too, this should be much thicker I think and should be a little more complex with some dark fruits in there and what not."
"I wouldn't go so far as to say that an oak-aged Quad is blasphemy. This beer proves it. It's not a bad release from Weyerbacher, but a couple of tweaks would go a long way. Personally, I think it'd benefit from more aromatics, more body, and less alcohol. I also wouldn't mind a little Belgian yeast. Having said that, it's definitely an interesting beer that's aged pretty well over the last two or three years. Thanks, Chris."
"Light toasted notes up front quickly give way to big, sweet, boozy malts. Sweet, candied tropical fruits on the palate. Vanilla and bourbon notes around the edges. Caramel and banana liqueur. Toasted coconut and rum-booziness take it away to the finish. Finish has lots of lingering fruity sweetness and plenty of rummy warmth. More sweet than bourbon-y, but the bourbon and oak definitely play a role. Full-bodied with a slick feel. Big, bold, and definitely a sipper!"
"Very sweet with again, a lot of boozy heat as well as a lot of dark fruit, oak and vanilla. I'm picking up hints of raisin, plum and dark cherries and more boozy heat in the warm finish."
"drinkability: very very drinkable for such a high ABV. a little sweet for my liking, but an overall great beer"
"D: I can definitely tell this is a sipper from the presence of the alcohol, but at the same time I just want to keep drinking it because of the smoothness and good balance of flavors."
"I like the way this beer feels in general, but, for the style, I have had American quads with more body that I like more. This is decent, though, but looses its malty focus because the malt isn't heavy enough to ground everything. Carbonation is nice, and the finish has some great lingering flavors but a touch too much noticeable alcohol. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again. It's an adventurous take on the quad and I think Weyerbacher hit the mark. However, to rate this up there with the best quads in the world would be a sin. But to give it poor marks would be utter blasphemy."
"This is a good, after-dinner, sitting-around-the-fireplace sort of beer. Solid overall!"
"Quarter of an inch head and clear body. Aroma of heavy malt, light bread, moderate yeast, dough, big banana and bubble gum, grape, clove, and vanilla. Pretty thick, creamy texture, and almost flat carbonation. No alcohol initially, slights hints as the finish lingers."
"Overall - Quick enjoyable and an interesting change of pace. I went back and forth on this one, some interesting flavors though it has a lot of heat and lacks integration."
"Impression: Glad I got to try Blasphemy, should have named it Why Bother."
"pours a very cloudy brown color with little to no head or lacing and flat carbonation. very heavily particulate. caramel nutty hints that the smell that is also very boozey. taste is the same with some butterscotch hints. alcohol is pretty apparent but not overwhelming. medium body with slick sticky texture. slightly bitter in the finish. seems like this brew almost has too many flavors that i can't decypher them all. tkae it easy with this brew it will jump up and bite you in the ass."
"The beer pours a clear medium brown with a very small white head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla and cherry. The flavor is bourbon, cherries and other dark fruit, alcohol, vanilla, oak and chocolate. This is one boozy quadrupel. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this although the alcohol could be toned down a little bit in order to make it more drinkable. I have only had a few oak aged quadrupels but I really like the way they react with the barrels. This beer is no exception."
"For an almost 12% ABV beer, t is amazingly drinkable. This is a beer definitely worth seeking out. Once my Papier runs out (what a sad day that will be!!), Blasphemy will definitely keep me going."
"Hazy orange in the glass, with an off white head which quickly disappears. Huge apple aromas, along with some bourbon , mulling spices and a bit of oak. Vanilla, apple, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, maybe a hint of cinnamon and some nice, warming alcohol. Finishes somewhat dry, with a touch of bitterness. Not an everyday drinker, but delicious none the less."
"D: I could definitely have more than one of these in a single sitting"
"Drinkability: It's definitely drinkable, but after a few you'll more then likely be reeling from its effects. The fruity tones taste great, but for people who are more attracted to scent then taste, this may be a one and done deal."
"Very sweet, really a bit too much for me. The booze is felt rather than tasted, which is certainly a plus for such a big beer. The oak aging seems to smooth out some of the edges in their standard quad, but the sweet fruity flavors are not held in check. The mouthfeel is full and lucious with the usual belgianesque carbonation. The sweetness holds back on the drinkability."
"D-this has a great flavor and is very smooth, it is extremely thick and the alcohol is prevalent. great beer, very strong!"
"D - the weak point. obviously you don't drink whisky and beer at the same rate. this is a sipper, but that's what it should be. savor the flavor and the 11.8% ABV bombardment. i shared this with a friend, and although my hangover lackthereof is nice (note - i felt even better than I would have had I not drank anything) this beer is one you could really enjoy all to yourself. just...don't...move."
"Mouthfeel is ok, ok drinkability. Check that 5 sips in I have to dump it. Not good."
"Drinkability: After a couple of years of aging, this beer has probably settled down, but it hasn't come together particularly well; the quad elements are missing and the alcohol is heavy handed"
"Drinkability: Weyerbacher Blasphemy is a slightly above average beer from a slightly above average brewery that really typifies the strengths and weaknesses of them. Though not quite as bad as Lagunitas (i.e., I don't expect to have a splitting headache tomorrow morning), but they really do have a hard time covering up their alcohol. It's spicy, hot, quasi-solventy, and really hides a lot of what I imagine are really nice, pleasant, well-integrated barrel flavors. But, also, at 11.8%, this one can't be too terribly drinkable. So, Weyerbacher, work on this! You'll be one I keep coming back to if you do."
"Pours a clear deep orange/amber with a bubbly white head the dissipates, but never really goes away. Smell is sugary sweet with lots of dark fruits cherries and plums predominantly a bit of vanilla and rubbing alcohol. The alcohol stings the nose if I take a deep breath after swirling the glass a bit. Taste is sweet with cherries prunes and plums, some oaky vanilla and a whole lot of hot alcohol. Harsh alcohol burn! Mouthfeel is sticky, body is thick, carbonation is medium. I don't know how to feel about this one. It is hot as hell, there is no hiding of the alcohol here. I think its tasty but the burn is a bit to much to allow me to enjoy this one, maybe with some age?"
"Barrel aging is very evident upon tasting, as is the alcohol. It is rummy and even a bit like whiskey. Could cellar for a while longer, for sure. Light bodied for a quad and drier than most, but it still retains some sweetness typical of the style. There is a nice bready, yeasty characteristic, but not quite enough. To me, it almost seems like a tripel and a half, as it needs a bit more body-adding malts and the alcohol is a bit rough...but that is being a bit picky, I am very glad I brought this out for my 500th. Great beer and I am sad that Weyerbacher has discontinued the brew."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good and the drinkability isn't too bad considering how big this beer is. An experience beer that I am sad is apparently retired."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit slick and syrupy. Mellow carbonation. Overall it's a bit too hot and sweet for me personally, but there are good flavors running throughout. Glad I got to try it but I enjoy the other Weyerbacher barrel aged offerings much better."
"Blasphemy is a beer that 'big beer' guys will long debate of being potentially over the edge. If you like Weyerbacher Blithering Idiot, Insanity, Quad, or Merry Monks...this beer is for you. In your face, HUGE in flavor, and big in ABV...perfect IMO. I have 3 6 packs in my cellar as we speak, and I look forward to finnishing them all."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma of bourbon and sweet malt, but strongly bourbon. Flavor of candy corn, sweet malt, and LOTS of bourbon. Very boozy and hard to get through. Ick. This is bad...not reminiscent in any way of an abt/quad."
"2.5-3-4-3-2.5"
"Its a little thick in chewy in the mouth, and with all that alcohol its not too drinkable. I've been working on this 22 for almost 2 hours now. Great Beer."
"I absolutely can't wait to open one of the bottles I brought home. Delicious beer, if you like 'em strong."
"drinkability: man, tough"
"D: Really boozy but very drinkable. I think I would say this beat out the Quad but both were great in their own ways. Too bad this one will soon no longer be made."
"Also leaves a warm feeling in your belly. This would be nice on a cold winter night."
"This beer certainly packs a punch with the 11.8% ABV, but I was hoping for more from the mouthfeel and complexities that one would expect from the style and oak barrel combo. The balance is off with some sips and enjoyable with others."
"I love this beer and it really should be tried by any strong beer fan!"
"A slightly cloudy dark amber color with a fair off-white head and lacing. The aroma brings on whiskey and nut, berry and oak. Seems potent. The first mouthful is fizzy and full of the same flavors I detected in the aroma. As advertized this suggests oak barrels and Jack Daniels. Still, not quite what I expected. Highly carbonated and lots of warming alcohol, viscous and challenging to push through quickly, not a session brew for me. These flavors aren't my wheelhouse, somewhat clove in the Belgian tradition, conducive to food to help cut the sharp acidic attack of this aggressive ale. There is a nice vanilla caramel hint that comes out as it warms. A quality brew but not suited to the average consumer. Definitely worth a try to anyone that enjoys a strong ale, and possibly a big winner for some."
"If the rumors are true, it's too bad that Weyerbacher has decided to give Blasphemy the axe. I'd like to see them continue to tinker (with both Quad and this beer) in an effort to create something truly special. It wouldn't take much. Besides, the craft beer world can always use a good oak-aged quadrupel."
"Pours a light golden color with a reddish tint. Slight head on the pour, but nothing that sticks around. Smell is alcohol and belgian sugars. Taste is, wow, very hot. This thing is like drinking a straight shot. This definitely needs some time to calm down. This beer will absolutely light you up! If you can get past the alcohol, there is a nice Quad underneath there, but God help you if you can find it. Full and complex on the mouthfeel. This is a beer that the whole time you're drinking it, there's no mistaking that you're going to be f'd up. This needs to be put down and cellared for a very long time."
"D- so great, loved the quad and love this even more"
"This beer pours a hazy reddish orange color with a one finger head that lasts several minutes. Mild lacing on the glass throughout. Nose is very spicey, slightly yeasty with some sweetness. Alcohol is definitely detected in the nose. Taste is very sweet - very fruity, some slight notes of chocolate in the taste, and a bit of yeast. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste as well. Combo of the alcohol and sweetness makes this one a sipper for me - the more it warms, the easier it goes down. Definitely a more heavier bodied beer. Overall, a decent beer - not my particular style - and if you're going with this one, it's a sipper!"
"Overall- This is a very complex and bold beer though I wish would have shared it with a friend."
"Notes: Not well balanced in my opinion. Too boozy for it's own good so drinkability is not bad ,but a slow sipper. I felt it was still a decent brew with a good subtle bourbon taste and a very warming effect. The alcohol just needs to be a bit masked in this beer and then I think it will garner a higher grade from me."
"This is one killer beer. Absolutely top-notch."
"Very tasty and extremely drinkable. Almost too easy to drink, given the ABV. Like a previous reviewer noted, the alcohol is present, but never hot. Another great brew from Weyerbacher."
"D - For whatever reason, Blasphemy is a very drinkable beer considering the high ABV. Although the ABV isn't hidden well, it isn't hot, which helps. Overall I would've prefered a greater depth of flavor and in the end I think the lack of body is what really holds this brew back as is the case with most of Weyerbacher's brews. A good beer, but not all that it could be."
"This is pretty tasty, but it's a little too hot to trot in the alcohol department. I like bourbon aged beers, but this one is a little too boozy. Flavor is good but it's a bit rough around the edges. Definitely a sipper. I actually prefer the base beer Quad; it's a bit more drinkable and not as boozy."
"Overall, a mostly sweet, slightly sour americanized version of a belgian, and a good one at that. Very fruity and sweet, with some alcoholic burn behind it. Almost like a very sweet barleywine. Tastes like plum, fig maybe, dark cherry, all the awesome dark fruits, backed by sweet malts. True belgian in style and implementation. Almost like a belgian dark ale, except lighter in body, but a lot of the same tastes are there. Strong, full mouthfeel, flavorful and coating whilst being refreshing at the same time. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit because of the booziness, but that's only a slight hit. This is my favorite Weyerbacher so far, definitely worth seeking out. The barrel aging leaves its mark all over the experience without being totally distinct, able to be picked out. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This beer needs a little more depth to the flavors, it comes off a little too strong, with pretty noticeable alcohol. But it does have a nice mouthfeel, and good aromas. All in all... it's a pretty solid quad."
"I can understand why Weyerbacher has stopped producing this, as I can see a very limited appeal. I wouldn't mind keeping a few bottles of this around, for special occasions."
"In the end, I found the bottle of Quad that I picked up right next to this one on the shelf to be a much more harmonious combination of flavors, and significantly more drinkable."
"D- This is a great beer to sit down and sip at, and I could probably drink 2 at best over an hour and a half or so."
"Notes from: Jul 12, 2008"
"D-I don't think so, it drinks nicely but I couldn't do more than one at a sitting-this is a sipping beer."
"Date consumed: 11 July 2008"
"This is a tough beer to get through because of the alcoholic heat. It is very complex and really needs to be sipped. It's too bad the booze is so forefront on this beer, everything else seems to be in check and right where it needs to be."
"D: Definitely a sipper. A very good oak aged beer ould not do more than one in a sitting"
"Amber color, white head and decent retention. Oak, bourbon, vanilla, and dark fruits in the nose. Bourbon, oak, cherry, and a little bit of vinous character in the taste. Lighter side of medium bodied and light carbonation. I'd try this again for sure."
"D: This is a special treat...to be sipped and savored like a fine cognac, definately not a session beer. Hats off to weyerbacher...this is a truly spectacular beer. More breweries need to experiment with bourbon barrel aged belgian style beers..."
"a tasty beverage and i am glad that ive had it. not my favorite quad but still rather good. boring review but who really cares."
"I have had an on again off again appreciation of Weyerbacher, but the Quad and its off shoot Blasphemy is definitely a unique and well done beer on their end. I would lean them more toward Belgian Barley wines than Quads or certainly not Strong Dark. In any case it is a worthy beer to experience and should be had more than once to appreciate its complexity and character. And it sparks my interest in getting a regular Quad which I have not had in a long time."
"Very heavy and full flavored beer. One is definitely enough. A slow sipper."
"Amazing color almost a red ale tint and minimal head with no rings. Hits the back of the tongue and stays there with a sweet aftertaste. Good hop level with medium alcohol noticed. Would not be long night repeat drinker as the alcohol hits quickly. Mouthfeel is clean and lightly citrusy. Best Weyerbacher I have had."
"Pours golden amber with excellent clarity. Medium head, minimal lacing. Nose- sweet candi sugar, booze, grapes. Taste- medicinal hotness to it, dark fruits (plum, raisin), some earthy wood and of course bourbon. Finishes dry and hot. Cabonation is moderate, body not all that thick."
"Pours a medium to dark amber color with good clarity and a solid half inch of off-white head. Aromas of deep oak notes, vanilla, spicy esters, and bready/toasty malts. On the palate, the oak continues to really soften the beer while providing increased complexity to an already interesting Belgian. It finishes thick and viscous with the tannic quality of the wood really rounding things out. Overall, I think this is one of the better oak-aged beers from Weyerbacher that I've tried."
"This poured a hazy burnt auburn with a bit of white head. It smelled like prunes and molasses with wild yeast and honey wheat malt, and a bit of citrus hops. It tasted like honey wheat and barley malt, with strong orange hops, and a hint of oakey prunes and molasses. It was fairly thick with lots of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this had a clean, bold flavor that was surprisingly bright. It had noticeable alcohol and a lasting aftertaste, which made more of a sipping beer, although still quite enjoyable. It didn't have as much oak in the flavor as I expected. I'd like to try this one again after it's been aged a few years."
"The beer was great. Not as good as I had hoped but better than average. I was especting a bit more of the oak flavor but it mostly just tasted like a barley wine. I love barley wine and it fit that well, I'm just expected a bit more. I would buy and drink this again, and I have had a lot of Weyerbacher beer before, it's just not exceptional."
"Full-bodied, sticky, lightly-carbonated and slick. Superb and substantial feel, drinkability severely limited by a smoking-big ABV. The copious booze in this brew makes itself a presence in the flavor and feel of the drink, and in the functionality of the drinker."
"22 oz bomber into tulip glass. Picked this up really randomly, I've had a lot of the weyerbacher offerings but I've never had this--or the non-oak aged version of the quad. Pours a reddish mahogany, somewhat cloudy, very good amount of head. After a couple minutes it goes down but retains to a caked on layer, lots of lacing. Really beautiful looking beer, actually. Smell is dominated by oak and a lot of spice--I'm even getting nutmeg and cinnamon in there. Vaguely like a winter warmer. Some citrus notes in there as well. Alcohol present. Taste is really surprising, kind of aggressive on the sour cherry side, actually, especially for a quad. Alcohol is very noticeable, I have to admit. It's good, but it's quite a lot to handle. The usual chorus members show up in the taste as well: vanilla, oak, brown sugar, etc. Very thick body, moderate to high carbonation. Definitely good, but as the label admits, it's kind of a strange idea for a beer. Would have come together better if the alcohol wasn't so present."
"It started with a nice, foamy finger of medium-tan head but the retention was so marginal that when I looked back, it had dissipated into wisps. The color had a slight haze, but it was definitely a deep-amber with reddish highlights. The nose was very oak-y, with lots of vanilla, caramel and coconut evident. The mouthfeel, besides being medium-to-full, was really HOT! This beer seems to cry out to be aged. This is what I have deemed a ""Now 'n' Later beer"" after the children's candy that advised ""Have some now, and save some for later."" I might have to see about procuring another bottle for cellaring purposes. After the initial heat died down, I tasted a lot of dried fruit - raisins, prunes, even banana along with the sweet caramel and vanilla that I noted on the nose. The finish was still really sweet and coupled with its high ABV, one was plenty on this go-'round. If I can score another, it will go in the basement to await its time."
"Drinks great, you do feel the heft, but a damn fine quad!"
"Worth trying... unlike anything I had previously encountered."
"***note: if the extreme moonshine characteristics are bothersome (like they are to me) this beer vastly improves if it's let to air out in the glass for a few HOURS. even though it lowers the carbonation significantly, treating it as a red wine softened the overall profile and made it more enjoyable. let it open up, decant it if you will, then park it in the fridge and chill it down to 60 degrees or so. think grapes."
"Drinkability - interesting brew and nice, but the oak was a bit much for me even though i love oaked beers."
"Its a transparent amber/orange colored brew with a white fluffy head that almost completely disappears and left very minimul lacing. It smells strongly of rubing alcohol but also has a wiskey/oak smell, some malt, hint of fruity esters and a very nice vanilla smell. Overall the taste is dominated by an acidic chemical/solvent type of flavor. Its unfortunate because there are some nice flavores there that get pretty blown away like vanilla, oak and some slight apple cider. The mouth feel was very nice however I really struggled to drink the whole bottle."
"22oz. bomber poured into a couple of snifters. Has a light amber color and a white foamy head with good retention and some lace. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, maple and a hint of oak. Smell is quite pleasant. Tastes to match with a heavy booze flavor and finishes cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel is very heavy. Tough to drink this one, it might benefit from some aging."
"This doesn't taste like an oak aged quadruple, it just tastes like whiskey and oak. It's disappointing that something which should have complex flavor profiles has been reduced to what it is. I really can't recommend this. If anything, try the original quadruple."
"D: Great oak character compliment and adds to their already very good Quad beer. Very much worth a try. A great sipping quad that lives up to is name the next morning if you drink to many of these the night before."
"D - An exceptional brew for the wine lover in you, though as a Belgian, it's only good."
"D: To be sipped slowly."
"A boozy sipper here. The bourbon didn't really make that great of an impression on me, relatively speaking. The ""quad"" aspect was fine, though didn't really nail the style. A bit of an awkward combo here. Not as impressed with this one as with the other two of the series I've had. Still, in all, it's a fair enough attempt, and certainly worth trying."
"It was okay. I had no desire to have another one, and I doubt I would seek this one out or recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't steer anyone away from this, but nor would I talk it up."
"Served in my Chimay goblet and poured from a bomber bottle, this 11.8% brew pours bourbon in color with a brandy tint. No head and zero carbonation. The nose was mild but vanilla notes were there but little else. The taste spoke of caramel,bourbon notes, vanilla and slightly sugary. Mouthfeel was boozy, and quite warming in the finish. This is very much a creeper as to alcohol as it hides from the taste, but also a pleasant brew. A quad? Yes, deceptive though it may be since it's about an inch away from a barleywine too. Nice effort from Weyerbacher."
"Even more bourbon in the flavor, and while it's hard to cut through the booziness, some of the raisin and fruity esters present themselves on the sides of the tongue. Although only .6% higher in abv than the Quad, this is a whole different ballgame due to the sharpness of the alcohol. Make sure you're not going anywhere for a while; this is one of few beers I would recommend sharing your bomber with a friend. Acidic on the throat and heavy in the stomach, it's not something you'll probably need or want seconds of. That said, I'm always a fan of extremes, and this one certainly fits the bill."
"This is definitely a sipper!!! Beer poured dark amber with a nice sized head. Aroma of bourbon abounds, and gets stronger as the beer gets to room temp. Can't gulp this one, too stong. Could be a dessert sipper. I plan on getting to Weyerbacher to taste this baby out of the tap for sure!"
"The beer poured a clear, dark amber with a thick, almond head into a pint glass. The aroma was of Bourbon and candy sugar. The initial taste was of sweet malt/candy sugar, immediately smothered by an enormous Bourbon-infused, alcoholic component - no attempt to mask the 11.8% ABV. Definitely a sipping beer, and would benefit from a larger malt presence to counteract the alcoholic esters."
"D : Definitely a sipper. I could see aging this one would help mellow out the alcohol heat"
"T: Full body, very thick and smooth on the tongue with a light, but active carbonation. After aging for a year, the alcohol is much more tolerable in this, but still very present. Sweeter than most other quads, very strong honey, sweet spice presence. As other reviews have said, this is a different beer than quad, not just an oak aged version. The oak aging adds a rum like, alcohol presence to Quad. I'm usually quick to fault Weyerbacher beers for having a samey, boozy, house yeast taste, but after aging this for a year, it rises above that stereotype for me. I still prefer Quad to this, but I highly recommend trying this beer for a different take on this style (but if you find a bottle, you should probably let this sit for awhile)."
"Aging this longer would mask the alcohol perception, but increase the sweetness...I haven't enjoyed beers aged for long periods of time because of the sweetness. So ultimately I like aging rich belgians and english barleywines to a good medium where the alcohol meshes well with the sweetness. This beer fits that equation. Will definitely enjoy again."
"D - A big, sweet sipper that has a nice slight barrel quality."
"This isn't quite as drinkable as its cousin Insanity - it's definitely a sipper. Best suited to cold weather - maybe hovering over a grill in the cold New England winter months. Still, this is great stuff. For some reason previous Weyerbacher offerings haven't blown my doors off but Insanity and Blasphemy are definitely bringin' it..."
"D: This is a nice quad that requires much cellaring to allow it to blend better."
"Way too much cherry and hot alcohol here. I've had big beers like this that hide the alcohol much better."
"Two fingers of very active deep tan bubbley head finely calms to about a half an inch. It sits attractive in the glass with a ruby amber glow. Nose is wonderfully syrupy sweet with great complexity. Showcases notes of vanilla taffy, honey, soft spicey slchol and banana. There is a hint of woodsy oak tword the end of the nose. On first sip you get a loud mixture of sharp spice fronted alchol, and a peppery biscuity richness. Sweet tones are of buttery dark fruit. Alchol is very present throughout the palate and hop in the belly. There is a dry bitterness on the finish that I actually pick up a bit of coconut rum. Mouthfeel is of thick bitter spice. With these facts it is as drinkable as it could be being this big and hot."
"Very warming and alcoholic and somewhat boozy. This was a huge and extreme beer. I enjoyed it but as far as BA's go, I expected more. This is certainly one that should be shared; I shared this one with my dad and he liked it as well. I would probably have this on again in the future."
"Of all the beer I bought on my last run to Vintage Cellar, this is the only one the guy at the counter opinionated on, and he endorsed it highly. I like it too. I prefer the more playful and colorful Quad over its barrel-aged cousin, but this is no slouch. Pick it up if you see it."
"Pours rather dark red with a short white head, a bit of lacing. Nose is at first rather strong with alcohols, but what do you expect from a nearly 12% ABV beer? Taste is also a bit strong with some funkiness, semisweet heavy fruits, but overall pretty good. The funk takes over a bit, but isnt' 100% overwhelming. Considering the high octane of the brew, it is rather drinkable and pretty good."
"Hazy caramel orange colour with a thin layer of fine beige bubbles. Solid collar with a bit of spotty lacing. Fruity aroma, some banana, coconut flesh, oak, mild vanilla, and a bit of caramel. Same in the flavour, but with additional oak and sweetness, it's also got an earthy and bready character, plus alcohol towards the end and a lot of heat in the finish. The sweetness really seems to be reigning in the alcohol here, and it's needed. The body is definitely on the full side with plenty of carbonation and a fair bit of dryness. Lots of warmth that stuns the tongue too. This one really seems like a car wreck, but somehow it hangs together. I'm not sure how Weyerbacher pulls that off in some of these big beers, but the result is pretty good here."
"One of the better Weyerbacher beers that I have had. I get the sense that the base beer here (a Quad) would not be as complex or tasty as I would want from the style, but the addition of the oak adds an extra dimension that really helps to make this beer work."
"Poured from bottle into oversized wine glass. Thick foamy head formed and was quickly gone. The beer is a deep ruby color. Smells of malt, plums, and vanilla. Tastes of malt, raisons, and vanilla. The alcohol is warming. Mouthfeel is smooth and light."
"I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a crystal snifter. It had a creamy head that left little lacing. The color was a deep red, almost opaque with a rim of white foam around the inside of the glass. The smell, again as with the OMMEGANG Abby Ale, was of dried fruits...dates and figs. The taste was smooth with fruity sweet and chocolate malty notes. This is an awesome beer. I love how Weyerbacher will take one beer, age it in oak, and then release it as an entirely different beer. It is amazing how a little bit of wood can make such a difference in the taste and complexity of a beer."
"Drinkability: Maybe a few years in the cellar would help Blasphemy come together better, but as it stands, I'd rather just stick with the QUAD. Even the dude on the label is struggling to keep it down."
"Taste is malty, diacetyl being present so it's quite buttery, vanilla is intrusive, a very warming beer as the alcohol is pretty evident as the oaked aspects mellows the sweetness."
"There was a lot of bourbon in the nose but the flavor was more plain or red wine oak. Iwould like to know what they used. Great beer."
"D- This beer has a nice blend of beer and barrel but they both bring their fusel flavors to the party. Surprisingly it didn't bother me and started to balance with the sweetness."
"Drinkability- I was really under the impression that for a beer to be a quad, it had to be aged in an oak barrel anyway, but in this case, it has been aged too long in an American oak barrel. This severely detracts from the light drinkability of the beer and makes me want to run for the hills. That said, I will age my other bottle back and see what this does in a few years."
"This one I have been wanting to try for quite a while now. The idea of a Quad aged in barrels definitely seems like something to get excited about. Pours a decent amber color, with lively carbonation, which leads to the head fading very quickly. Smell is of honey and dark fruits. Taste was the same. Mouthfeel is heavy and boozy. Although this is a very decent beer, it tastes a lot more like a Barleywine than a Quad. The price tag is also a bit of a setback. Worth a try I guess, but I would go with teh Insanity before this one. Cheers"
"Copped a 22oz bomber from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Really nice logo sticker with a monk covering his mouth with his hand... Blasphemy... According to the label, this beer is the result of aging Weyerbacher's Quad in Oak Barrels - the final product is an excessively sweet, slightly overbearing oak-aged taste with vanilla and strong caramel aftertones... pours a very nice dark-copper color with minimal head and impressive carbonation... Smell is replete with a malty, sweet, sugar-laden aroma... taste is ultra-flavorul, very rich and thick with a strong syrup taste pouring through...Strong alcoholic presence is noticeable in the tongue and nose, but is not entirely dominating, although the ABV is certainly up there at 11.8% ABV... as with many Weyerbacher brews, this one wasn't bad, but was slightly over-the-top, powerful, and should be sipped slowly... Overall, a flavorful, interesting brew... Worth a try..."
"D- The alcohol just over powers the beer IMO. Just seems like through a beer together and didn't refine it."
"Pours very red-amber, with a medium reddish-cream head that fades fast to a small collar of dense foam. Aroma: WOW, big time alcohol with lots of wood, hints of bourbon, and barest touch of hops. Flavor follows through with the alcohol nose, this is a BIG beer. Lots of malt back up the substantial but pleasant alcoholic bite. Body is big, as one would expect of a quad style beer. This beer is warming all the way down, with a pleasant sweet but warm aftertaste. Another great barrel aged beer from Weyerbacher."
"Overall Weyerbacher usually does a fantastic job with the barrel aging and this was proof of that. A very big Quad that beared its teeth and took a bite, but wasnt as big as it could have been. Very nice flavors and very robust I would love to try this one again some day. Very nice."
"d: This a fantastic treat to sip and savor every now and then."
"In a tasting of about 20+ beers, it's a bit weird that one of the ones I brought was my favourite of the night but, well, there you go. In my notes, it reads (and I quote): ""Holy crap OAK!!"" So, you get where I'm going with this. In addition to blow-your-head-off oak aromas and flavours, there are some quite complex undertones of butter, vanilla, and mild fall fruits, which make this more drinkable than some of its oak-aged brethren. Pretty tough to hide 12% ABV, but they do a decent job of trying. Probably one of my favourite Weyerbacher big beers so far."
"i am a little disappointed that the aroma doesn't reflect the complexity i get with each sip. i definitely pick up a yeasty malt character. some oakand it grows with timeand brown sugar"
"Pours a hazed orange/copper, thin off white head, no lace, settles to a thin ring, unhealthy looking. Smell is caramel, alcohol, fusels, raisin, oak, banana, bit malty, typical Weyerbacher but somewhat appealing. Taste is toffee, oak, raisins, sweet fusel middle, lots of alcohol, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but feels slightly syrupy, low carbonation, lots of heat. Pretty good for Weyerbacher, lots of fusel but works okay in this one. Thanks Jay!"
"D: Big, but I like it."
"Had again three years later, aged. Noticed more bourbon taste. Hid the booze, but its very high."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, meaty, cake-like all in a full body that's sugary, hot, yeasty, oaky with dark fruit lingering along the palate. It's yummy now but I think the best is yet to come with some age under it's belt."
"Cheers!"
"A good brew to sip on on Halloween night,poured into an oversized wine glass a deep rich amber it looked very nice in the light a thinner head atop.Deep dark fruit aromas with passing oak/vanilla tones a sweet alcohol prevails as well,somewhat sweet on the palate liked alcohol infused raisins and or prunes along with brown sugar and vanilla oaky tones.Its a sipper not something you would wanna drink early in the day but it fit the moment well."
"The beer is clear amber color with ruby highlights. Fizzy off white head fades to an edge layer quickly. Aroma is boozy, with mild bourbon and wood, some general fruitiness, and a lot of cherry scents. First sip reveals a slightly syrupy texture with fine rolling gentle carbonation. Flavor is complex with mostly sweet malt notes mixing nicely. I get caramel and bourbon with dark fruit, again I think cherries are in the flavor too. Not as boozy on flavor as nose advertised. Fairly easy to drink and nicely done."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. Aromas of deep malts, fresh wood flooring ( I just re-did my house) some vanilla sweetness, and that aroma you get from a banana, minus the sweet banana flavor, but that tartness you get from a green banana. The green banana flavor comes out even more in the flavor, along with the super sweet plum-like malt. The mouth feel is really sweet and almost cloying. Full-bodied that finishes with a slight dryness and a little bitter. Overall, the oak barrel phenomenon is over taking beers. There is a little too much oak cloyingness to make this a really drinkable beer. Would go great with a caramel apple tart."
"I might be able to have one of these at a time, but there are many better options in my opinion for that type of usage. Average beer that I am not sure the oak really helps at all."
"Whoa! This is a big beer. Astringent alcohol flavor pair with (again) acid-rich oak, sour apple & cherry. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, dry, and bitter all the way. It's a bit like swallowing nail polish, wood stainer, or some other dangerous substance. It's quite difficult to put this one away, which is strange, because I've not had trouble with other high ABV beers (Dark Lord, Bell's Batch 7000, Rochefort 10). This one just has too much acidity and bite behind it's oaken ""bark"". It would be interesting to see how this brew matures, as it might mellow out some of the more pungent aromatics and flavors."
"D: Not the easiest to drink, a slow sipper for sure, and the alcohol definitely lets you know its there."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear copper color ale with a big foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma of unrefined sugar with some light bourbon notes. Taste is extremely sweet, probably too sweet for my taste buds with some light vanilla and bourbon notes. Body is about average with some good carbonation. Nice application of the barrel but the base beer is just too sweet for me  interesting experiment."
"Pours a slightly cloudy tannish/amber color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slight vanilla, spicy, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet at the beginning, spicy, hot/tangy/bitter, and some caramel. Medium body, complex brew. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from Weyerbacher, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Drinkability - Loved it, that simple. I'm going to have to try the non-barreled version as well, but this brew will definetly open me up to more QUAD's. The guys at Weyerbacher have another big brew winner and this bourbon barrel aging is something I'm definetly going to have to investigate as there's an RIS and Barleywine version (Yes, I'm jacked!)."
"Drinking it young reveals a ton of character flaws that will definitely round out given the proper time and storage, but once a beer hits the shelves, it should be ready to drink IMHO. I think I may buy just one more bottle and sit on it for three years and try again. If it rounds out the way I think it may, it will be well worth the wait, even up to the tune of a full point gain or more in every rating category. Fingers crossed..."
"D - Very strong and flavorful, the mouthfeel is less than ideal. Hard to drink a lot of it."
"Thin and filmy. Does not finish clean one bit. Again, this is a quadrupel?? If so, if fails to impress."
"Nice mouthfeel and surprisingly drinkable. I should have saved this bottle until January or February"
"Drinkability: I wouldn't do more than two of these in one sitting, unless I had nothing else to do in the morning. QUAD was one of my favorite beers from Weyerbacher, but I think this one is better. You need to be a fan of nice liqours to appreciate this beer. It is close in flavor profile to some of the finer rums I've had the privilege of experiencing in my life. The sweetness of the barley with the bourbon risiduals is tantalizing and should age with grace. Other reviews of this beer view it as a last ditch effort to put another big beer in bourbon barrels, which is probably true, but this one is successful in the end. I for one, give big thanks to a brewery who puts the effort into barrel aging, while keeping their prices at an affordable level, AND producing a very complex product. Few could replicate this complexity with a wine or other beer that is comparable in price. Good job Weyerbacher."
"Another big beer winner from Weyerbacher, though the final couple of bottles are heading to the cellar for awhile to try and take a little edge off the alcohol. Worth trying."
"Overall a bit coarse and would probably do well with a few years of aging, but good stuff and worth looking for."
"This was not very drinkable. It's super high ABV, tastes super strong, and generally not very good. I'd wager 999/1000 average beer drinkers would take one sip of this and say it sucks. Fans of quads, big beers, and weyerbacher may be more forgiving, but it's probably just the alcohol clouding their judgment after they power through a bottle of this beast! I've actually got another bottle of this in the cellar, from a trip to NY earlier this summer, that I'm now certainly in no hurry to break into. We'll see how a few years treat this. Right now it's pretty rough, like drinking like a sweet/weak brandy, 22 oz at a time! I honestly doubt it will really improve that drastically, but I'll surely forget (or maybe never forget!) about this one long enough that who knows?"
"D: Overall, I reveled in this Belgian interpretation with a twist from Weyerbacher. The oak aging was nice, and added an unexpected quality, making for a unique quaff. While it may not have surpassed its ancestors, it's still a worthy offering and worth a try."
"D- This is not what I've come to expect from a barrel aged beer, but I suppose I haven't had to many. It was delicious however. The strong malt flavor of quads I've had did not rear it's head in this beer but instead took a back seat to fruitiness and whiskey. Not at all for sessioning, this beer is instead one to sip and calm the nerves when relaxation is required, what I generally reserve whiskey rather than beer for. I'm happy to have chosen this one for my 100th review and will be happy to enjoy it again."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a tall head that doesn't have great retention, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of alcohol as well as a lot of fruit and some spices. The flavors are very complex and alcoholic. Lots of alcohol and lots of sweet dark fruit combine with some oak and finishes with a nice hop bitterness. The body is medium and the drinkability is pretty good for the apparent alcohols. Tasty."
"I didn't care much for the QUAD but the oak aging does add some complexity. If this were available in a smaller bottle I might try it again."
"Pours a clean deep amber, with an off white head. Aromas that are oaky and a small presence of a dark fruit. In the taste, an oaky plum, alcohol, yet very minimal. A small alcoholic burn, and a alcoholic aftertaste, small oaky flavor left behind as well. Big taste, but it is smooth. Great sipping beer."
"D - one is plenty at this ABV but well done and thoroughly enjoyable!"
"D: This is a sipping beer . . . any more than that and you'll be on your arse before you realize it. One tops, it's quite laborious toward the end, but definitely a labor of love."
"Whoa, put this one back, it ain't ready yet. I'm not saying it's a bad beer, but it feels like it needs some time. The nose has some great vanilla and oak notes, but they're overwhelmed by alcohol there and in the flavor. There's a background sweetness in the taste, but again the booze prevails. I recommend this beer because it seems like there's some great stuff going on, but let it sit for at least 6 months before consuming."
"DA: This amazing Belgian style takes on a new depth with it's oak-aged effect, leave it up to an american brewery to *enhance* such a beloved style, the name is appropriate for this reason. 11.8% is felt rather fast, and eventhough it's highly enjoyable i was seriously buzzed after this bomber...so the key is too enjoy slowly. I have a feeling this stuff will be killer with some cellaring."
"This is a nightcapper. This put me right in the mood to toss on a game and hit the sack... Maybe that's why this review is a little shorter... gnite."
"This offering pours a maroon clear body leaving a thin tan head that disappears quickly. The aroma is very strong fruit, dark pitted, plums, vanilla, oak, earthy grassy hop feel. The taste starts sweet upfront, fruity, a bit of heat from the alcohol. The finish is bitter more than expected with a faint bourbon oaky, vanilla feel. This is a darn smooth quad, one that is made for sipping."
"D: The abv is huge and accentuated by the heat from the bourbon. This is a nightcap, I suspect that I'll sleep soundly tonight."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a one-sided beer. If you like that side, you'll love this beer. It's contrary to my preferences and thus, the relatively light review. If you like mega-malty, powerfully alcoholic beers, this may be perfect for you."
"Poured vigorously with a one inch short lived head carbonation fizzes out pretty quickly after the pour, body is a deep ruby amber tone with a beige fleeting head leaves behind very thin specks of lacing. Aromatics come off with heavy barrel aging overtones vanilla, oak, whiskey edge with deep plum and raisin yeast notes arising from the Quad while fusel alcohol cinges the nose hairs the sweetness is so outwardly sugary, not sure if this is a good thing. Flavors come crashing in with alcohol not hidden at all I'm going to age a bottle of this bruiser to see if it mellows my nose hair is past the tickling point it's definitely burning high alcohol and syurpy sweetness overrides alot of flavor aspects of this beer although it's nice to have a quad aged on oak the charred wood, vanilla, and whiskey notes all come to play but hide the parts of the beer that were once really desireable, man it's so boozy I don't feel like I'm drinking beer anymore this is definitely blasphemy. Mouthfeel is sticky with residual sugars alcohol sizzles on the palate with each sip really begins to become cloying when it warms up a bit carbonation is ample but the barrel aging is definitely evident. Drinkability I'm just such a fan the standard quad and the alright tripel they brew why throw them in oak barrels I don't think it's helps these styles on the other hand I'm in love with both Hersey and Insanity amazing, and this seems much different in color than the standard Quad I remember drinking."
"D - I like this a lot. It's a very creamy beer with very complex taste and smell. Try it if you can...I want more!"
"I was expecting more in the way of wood in this beer, but overall very nice. I've never really been overly impressed by weyerbacher, but this is really good. Although, the alcohol is seriously strong. I don't know what it is, I've had bottles of wine and other big beers that don't seem to hit as hard as this. Weird."
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Clear copper amber color. alcohol and oak nose. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet, alcohol, woody actually complex. Clean finish. Very warming. $8.00 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Has good drinkability for a brew with this much alcohol."
"D- Not really drinkable. Far too strong. The alcohol makes it simply too intense, even for an intense beer lover... overall, i think it'd be good if you lay it down for a couple years... everything's too intense right now."
"D-Not very drinkable, the alcohol is overwhelming to me. I have had many brews in the 10-12% that did not overwhelm like this."
"The biggest difference between Blasphemy and Quad is the strong vanilla tones and young alcohol presence."
"Blasphemy pours a light brown with a slightly foamy off-white head. Aroma is dominated by a chalky yeast with some sweet esters. Taste is sweet dark fruits, more of the yeasty flavor and some phenol-banana flavor. Alcohol is present, but not over the top for a beer that borders on 12%. Oak flavor is there but not overpowering."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy orangey copper brew. Head fades gradually down to a skim of froth, with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet, with vanilla and tart composing a large part as well. Taste follows along, sweet upfront, strong vanilla and tartness in the middle, and then it all closes up nicely with vinous alcohol, heavy on the warmth. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and the drinkability is very nice, although a little hot, which of course is to be expected at 11.8%abv. I think this is my favorite of the BA Weyerbachers."
"Nicely done with just an edge of Bourbon. Worth trying."
"The girls at Weyerbacher have another winner."
"Pours shiny, clear and brown with a puffy off-white head. Nose is alcohol and ethanol filled with some cherry and strawberry notes. Taste hits you first with a huge smack of alcohol that really burns as it goes down. Spicy and fruity with sweet malt tones, but its all overwhelmed to some extent by the alcohol. Makes my saliva glands open like a scotch will. Thick and full bodied, almost even syrupy. Overall, a bit too much for me in terms of the alcohol and not enough flavor, i think."
"It's light and sticky sweet. I'm glad I picked this one up. I'll have to grab another to age."
"Pours a clear burnt orange red with a medium head that disappears quickly. The smell is pungent with bourban,oak wood,alcohol,vanilla,and dark fruit. The taste is thick and sweet with alcohol,bourban,oak wood,cherry,vanilla,and rum. Very good and very complex. The m/f is heavy with the flavors mixing very well,but I found this beer very syrupy and thick. All in all,this is a very good beer from a brewery that I always seem to enjoy."
"Great sipping beer. An awesome example of an oak aged beer. And one thats better than the original unoaked version. I think this might be a little much for the uninitiated craft drinker and should be saved for special in the know people."
"What can I say about this beer that would serve it justice? By all means, it is not perfection, but if perfection were a destination, 'Blasphemy' would be a stop very near the end of your journey. The first couple of sips were a little overwhelming. Afterwards, however, the ride is smooth sailing. The vanilla tones are very pronounced, which is a good thing in my opinion. I am also a bourbon drinker when it comes to the harder variety of alcoholic beverages. The bourbon barrel aging process makes drinking this beer akin to going home and enjoying a nice glass of lemonade on the porch with grandma. I have nothing negative to say about this brew, so drink up and enjoy!"
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and light crystal malt scent along with a Belgian yeast fruitiness as well as an oakey/vanilla aroma. The taste is good also. It has a warm, malty flavor that's rich in crystal malts and oak esters. It goes down smooth with firm oak finish. It blends well with the barrels, but not as well as the Heresy and Prophesy beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I love the oak aged series. It adds a whole other element to the beer."
"Body is big, but retains a bit of delicate Belgian characteristic. Slick and thick, it is a sipper for sure. I don't recommend tackling aa 22 oz bottle without a little help."
"Mmmmm quite delicious but with slightly too much alcohol in the mouth and chest. Again oak is very toasty and vanilla-fied. Tastes of new american variety. And again fig and nutty flavors at the forefront with the same red currant, and bing cherry. Nice and spicey with a light carbonation that makes this a bit creamy and lively on the palate. I really like the mouthfeel and nothing is overpowering which really helps drinkability. Definitely a sipper but a sipper you can sip for a day. In other words nicely integrated with modest complexity."
"Poured a deep amber with a decent head that diminished rather slowly to nothing. The aroma was of dark malts, dried fruits and some subdued hops. The taste was extremely complex. Dried fruit dancing nicely with a subtle oak flavor. The beer was heavy but not overbearing, excellent alcohol warmth. This was a unique enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark amber with relatively little depth. Head is a slight dusting on top of the liquid. Many constant upward streams of bubbles keep things fresh. The nose is oak all the way: vanilla fudge bananas, treacle, and a dry/toasted woodiness dominate. The wood treatment has covered up some of the solvent alcohol that plagued the Weyerbacher Quad. On the palate it's very sweet (it's dying for some rich, creamy cheese as a pairing) with a powerful vanilla flavor and some banana notes. The alcohol, while masked in the nose, comes out in force on the palate, providing a big burn. Considering the very active carbonation there's relatively little in the mouthfeel. This is a big, sweet beer best suited for dessert. It's decent but not revelatory."
"Beautiful deep amber color with a slight white hat of small bubbles. The nose is sugary with some smokiness and an oak earthy presence. The taste is sublime the Quad lifts the tongue in joy and the woody oak which is perfectly tuned here hits the tongue in a long aftertaste. The body belies the gravity of the beer, a sipper for certain as the whole bottle with have you singing songs you don't even like."
"I initially thought this beer was too hot to be drinkable, but as it warms, the drinkability is greatly enhanced. You can definitely tell that this is a 10+% brew.... but pretty delicious overall."
"On tap at the Blind Tier Ale Hse in NYC a few weeks ago and reviewed from notes. Pours cloudy darkish, smoky almond, minor light tan head and leaving a tiny bubble film and fine light lacing. The nose here is boldly of crisp spicing and alcohol. One sip and its obvious that this a strong, heady and complex brew. Notes of currents, rum, brandy, burnt grains, alot going on here, not for the faint of heart/palate, not for quaffing, and not for fans of pissy yellow beer. Fine night capper/late night sipper."
"Pours a deep brown, somewhat hazy, with a big, light-brown head. Smells very spicy, yeasty, with hints of ripe fruit. Taste is very powerful, yeast, spice, raisins, and a lot of alcohol, too much alcohol. Very sweet. It is medium on the tongue, with a dryish finish. The alcohol burn makes this less drinkable than I would prefer, but all in all an occassional treat."
"The oak aging seems to take a little roast edge off the standard issue Quad. So it's just different enough to be new and still comfortably old. The ABV raises a rambunctious red alert, and only a simpleton would disregard the high-temp warning. Even so, finishing the bottle could carry consequences. And yet, in spite of this, I did enjoy it, and even if one bottle, or less, is the limit, it does leave a good impression in the end."
"A 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. I was trying to compare this to Quad, and found this one a little more interesting. It had a dark amber color with a thin head. It had a sweet, fruity aroma, with a vinous character. An explosion of taste. Fruity, some chocolate, yeasty, and wine. I thought it was very smooth and mellow. However, I don't think I'd drink this and Quad together in one sitting again. Next time, Blasphemy alone."
"The beer pours a very good looking darkish brown color. Very impressive looking beer with excellent head retention and good lacing. The nose is not huge, but one gets a sense of sweet spices and oak on the nose. On the palate this beer is quite sweet with candy, cherries, vanilla, chocolate, licorise and raisens. The alcohol is pretty noticeable in this one, making it not the most drinkable of beers. Definitely a sipper, but a good beer for all that. The beer finishes moderately well; sweet with a bit of crispness/dryness at the end. A very good beer from Weyerbacher, albeit not the easiest beer to drink given the high abv."
"Overall, I highly recommend it if you like the style. Quads, on their own, are a bit of an acquired taste, so I think the same can be said about Blasphemy."
"Pours an gorgeous ruby-orange with more a 1 finger head that leaves a few leaves of lacing. The smell on this one is wonderful - candied sugars, vanilla, a hint of the oak. The taste on this one is raw -- nice dark fruit, brown sugar, followed by a nice smooth oak back and a pronounced, borderline unpleasant, alcohol bite. My bet would be that this one will be very tasty if cellared for a while to mellow out the alcohol bite. Still, this one exhibits nice flavor complexity is quite enjoyable. I'll probably go back and buy a few bottles to hide for a while."
"22oz bomber from Florian's. Tramslucent copper-brown body with under a half inch of off-white head. Banana and woodiness dominate the aroma. Wood, banana, and spice all play prominent roles in the flavor. Lighter-bodied. Little carbonation to speak of. A pretty decent beer - more mellow and drinkable than its non-barrel-aged cousin."
"I want to try this one after it has cellared a while. Right now it is very hot."
"I can thank the Florida Gators for this one."
"Drinkability: For me this is second to how amazing Insanity is (which continues to be one of my favorites). And I say that especially after really not being a big fan of Eleven at all (here's high hopes for twelve, though). The barrel aging for Weyerbacher continues to be a great experiment, and one I'll certainly continue to look forward to. I'm a huge fan of the quad by itself, but this is just beyond amazing. I'm so glad they continue to be ballsy and not only be experimental, but make great beer while doing it."
"Oh yeah, found a new fave. Pours dark brown, looks a bit like a brown ale, very little head. Smells sweet, way to sweet. However the taste, oh yeah how to describe. Quite sweet but balanced with the high alcohol level, sweetness is like figs, strange artifical sweetner, alcohol and spices. This combo just works and it is damn delicious. Overall this is a very serious nightcap sipping beer. I have to get more of this, love it, highly recommended."
"Wow, the hits just keep on coming form this brewery that stays on style while trying to be different. Blasphemy is a BIG beer that has great drink ability even at this young age. I'm still excited about the possibilities of this beer as it ages. The 11.8% ABV does not hide itself, it attacks your tongue, throat, and senses right off the bat. When held to the light, it shows to be a beautiful light red color. The pour for me was into a large goblet that produced a fine off- white head. The early flavor is all candy sugar with a hint of vanilla. The flavors are clean leaving a light aftertaste that fades to a fruity finish. The glass is coated with the oils and tannins with each sip. Mouthfeel seem perfect for the style. Drink this bad boy with care for the alcohol can and will get you. This is another one of those beer to add to the collection for future use, some winter night to come when a good book beckons, or to treasure in the distant future as the flavors meld and mature."
"Light red body with a small white head and not much carbonation bubbles.Head leaves a small white ring.Vanilla,oak?,candi sugar and some berry mabey.and some phenols in my nose.Hard liquor taste,like whiskey.candi sugar,spice and vanilla.Warming sensatio in my chest,fizzy carbonation and a bit creamy from the vanilla I think.One 12 ounce bottle is enough for me.The first sips were a bit out of the ordinary for me.Its not half bad at all.I like it and would recommend it but now to a new craft beer drinkiner or the faint of heart.This brew is also hot, I have one in my cellar and I think a year there will do some good.The oak taste is tasty but overwhelming all in the same.The drinkability would be higher but I started to feel a small buzz off a few sips.Deffinetly SIP THIS!"
"I do love Weyerbacher, but this one is a little odd. This is better than some of the other wood aged Weyerbachers (like prophecy). I think this may also be the one occasion that this is better than the unoaked version. I'll be curious to see what this does with some age on it..."
"Actually, I prefer the Quad over this, but I still am enjoying this one. Cheers!"
"sidenote- I ""aged", if you can call it that, this beer for 1 whole month!!"
"Bottle. Tremendous tasting beer. Chewy dark fruit flavors, with hints of vanilla and a lovely sweetness overall. The oak component is nearly undetectable. It provides an extremely light toasted wood flavor, hints of vanilla, but no bourbon. In fact, I wouldnt think this was oak aged if they didnt mention it. Unfortunately, its not the most aromatic brew, but its still great. Weyerbacher is a really great brewery, imho."
"Drinkability - A blend of sweetness and booziness dominate this fruity and slightly spicy quad. A subtle woody effect and pleasant mouthfeel allow this strong ale to unleash the vigor and suppleness in equal measure. A very drinkable beer that lets you know it is a contender up front."
"At $8/22oz, far from outstanding. As a drink alone, it's just okay. Nothing to gush over, and nothing to run out and get. I was expecting a bit more from this troupe."
"Drink: Hm. It's good. I'd like more. But that's the problem."
"Drinkability: definite a slow sipping beer. One bottle was slow to finish on my own, I wish this was in 12 oz bottles. I think this may mellow nicely in the cellar."
"Pours brownish copper, mostly clear, with a small cream colored head that fades quickly. Aroma is soft and sweet, like a nice banana custard, some spices and bread, and a dose of alcohol. Taste is at first soft and sweet up front, spiced dessert bread. A slightly tannic oak comes in and mixes into the drying finish along with a major bite of alcohol that is warming and somewhat harsh. Medium to heavy in body, the beer is easily cut through by the large alcohol presence and the dry oak character. I enjoyed this beer, I liked its large bite of alcohol although its richness and strength would prohibit too much. Will definitely like to see if age mellows this or if it thins out."
"This ones needs a while to settle down. It's not undrinkable as it is now, but it will definitely improve by some softening, which only age can provide. I picked up a few bottles, and I'll give this one another go next year."
"We were told in the tasting room at the brewery that the barrels used to oak age this beer were from Jack Daniels. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle purchased fresh from the brewery. Poured into a snifter glass. Appears a dark mahogany toned amber with about a finger of fluffy off-white head. Smells of whiskey soaked oak, sweet caramel, and vanilla. Tastes of whiskey soaked cherries, vanilla, candy, crisp fruit and alcohol. Rich and full bodied with nice carbonation. A very warming beer that is certainly a sipper. Well done Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability: The intensity of aroma and flavor in this one makes it a great afterdinner drink (let's make it ""Blasphemy and cigars"" after dinner), but you probably wouldn't have more than one of these in a sitting."
"the oak is there so it adds a nice touch but this is a tough one to handle right now. I'd pick up another bottle and sit it down for another year."
