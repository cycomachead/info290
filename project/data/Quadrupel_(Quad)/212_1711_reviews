"O- this is definitely a sipper that drinks more like a dessert port, this would be a fine choice for an after dinner drink"

"I am neutral on this beer."
"Very dark brown beer with thin tan head. Thick smell of dark fruits, molasses, licorice, toffee, caramel. Taste is sweet, surprisingly, not very alcoholic, candy sugar, plums, sticky. Light carbonation, still drinkable, despite high ABV."

"A lot of sweet grape musk on the nose.  It almost smells like fresh grape jam.  The wine grape carries over to the flavor, mixing with some sweet malt, dark molasses and cola.  Unexpected for a quad, but very solid and easy to drink for such abv."
"Overall: Kasteel Donker forms an integral part of one of my favourite beers, Kasteel Rouge, so it was interesting to get the opportunity to try it on its own. I think I'll stick to the cherrified version - Donker on its own is just too damned heavy and sweet for my personal tastes. As an 'every now and again' thing, this makes a nice change (and hell, you can't beat a good quadrupel) but it's hard going for 'regular' drinking."

"Perfect consistency; rich, sweet taste with a hint of plum...phenomenal beer!"

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/16/2007. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing fairly quickly. No glass lacing and some slight streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, molasses, light chocolate, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown sugar, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian Quadrupel style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Poured a dark brown heading to maroon with little or no head, promising a boozy Belgian quad. Smelled like raisins, currants, and dark, sticky fruit in general. Tasted like a tawny port -- rich, sweet and booze on the front fading to fruit on the finish. Had a silky smooth feel perfect for the sweet alcohol. Overall one of the best, most balanced, beers I've tried even if one of the sweetest."

"Pours a dark brown with a hint of read in there.  Nice head but it dissipated quickly and there was no lacing on the glass.  The smell jumps out as you pour, the dark fruits are the first thing you notice, mostly raisin, there seems to be a little cherry and definitely the candy.  You pick up a hint of the alcohol in the smell.  Then the taste, wow, unbelievable.  Taste is similar to smell but bigger and even more complex.  It is very sweet up front, you get the candy and the raisin is what I would call thick, but not out of whack.  I still am getting the cherry, kinda like wine which I almost never drink so could not quantify, and something along the caramel/toffee that I can't make out.  Although maybe just the candy that comes across creamy.  The alcohol is there but you do not notice it until you think about it.  Extremely tasty, complex, but oddly it all works.  It is sticky in you mouth, almost syrupy but it really works.  You are licking the sweetness of your lips, outstanding.  Overall this was an extremely interesting and quality quad that I am shocked is not getting more pub.  Good day and it was a victory beer, victory is good."

"I don´t like my beers to be so sweet but it was done in a good way, and i learnt to love it while sipping. Had no problem in downing 75 cl., and i would definitely have this nectar again to get deeper in its complexities."

"An outstanding specimen of a Belgian ale."

"Final Thoughts: All in all, I was kinda a bit disappointed by it. I think part of the reason is I saw Donker, and thought Dunkel and was expecting something richer and bitter then something this light and sweet. It's ok, but I get the feeling Quad's are the malt version of IPA, meaning too much of one aspect of the beer dominating the others."
"Overall –  A really good beer although in my opinion not as good as Golden Draak. At 11% it is not to be trifled with. You had better treat this one like a Trappist beer and leave it to one bottle a day. It hits you first at the back of the tongue and it is definitely quite sweet. I find it quite similar to toffee but beyond that there is not much to say. If you like them sweet then this is a good beer for you."

"Poured from a bottle into a Kasteel goblet at Taste of Belgium in Palm Beach, Aruba. Pours a dark reddish brown with only the slightest creamy ivory head. It dissipates quickly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma reminds me of prune, but the sweetness is very evident in the nose. The taste follows the aroma. Prunes, plum and raisins with lots of caramel sweetness. Medium mouth, but the way it slides off the tongue gives it a light feel. It's certainly different from the other quads I've tried, but it is so very good. I wish I could find this one closer to home."

"Overall: only barely avoids being cloying, the lack of suds or balance to provide a break from the sweetness hurts the beer's potential - teetering on the edge of being a very good brew; it's difficult to finish the bottle"
"On tap. I admit it. I go for the sweet and this has all the angles going for it...as long as you're 'on the sweet'. Not white sugar sweet, but that raisiny sweet...dates sweet...kind of, but not really that dried fruity sweet. I'm on that in a minute...as long as there is of depth of flavor. I don't want to tarnish or enhance the experience with words that may be misinterperted so I'll just say if you like deep, serious flavors & have the time to savour...make this the one. So stop reading this & order the damn thing already..."

"Very complex and also sweet quad. This seems to age well and it works perfectly as a dessert beer (you wouldn’t drink a second bottle...). Call it a sleeping pill or night cap."

"O - This Quad is definitely on the sweeter side with a unassuming punch that finishes as strong as it starts. It may be a touch too sweet to make it an ideal Quad for my taste buds but the deep multitude of flavours still make this a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very fine quad, maybe not quite in the Westy 12 and Rochefort 10 league but eminently enjoyable and at all times a serious beer that is to be respected and enjoyed. Would gladly pick up another especially at the current price in Ontario."
""
""
""
"O- This bottle was aged for 3 yrs. and I must say, I reeeally love this stuff. I've had other bottles of varying years/age and this one was the best. Simply outstanding as a stand alone or a dessert beer. I would not say that this is a ""whole bottle in one sitting"" beer. Best shared with a friend."
""
"Overall – ABV is well hidden and it tastes a little like a barley wine in some ways.. I'd like a little more dark fruit flavour rather than the cola notes, but this is still an excellent brew. Just a little one dimensional. Curious to see how this ages."
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
"O: I would say this beer was a sleeper for me. I wasn't expecting what I got at all. While I know some would call it a touch sweet, I liked the dark fruit profile a great deal. If you like big Belgians I think you will like this."

"Beer is heavy-bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth (1/3) and otherwise foamy (2/3) mouthfeel that suits the beer and the style quite well. Ethanol felt as heat in the nostrils and low burn on the palate and back of throat, not surprising for an 11% ABV beer, fairly well-integrated into the overall package. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness on the palate and lips."
"O: Perhaps too sweet and cloying.. There are fascinating notes of apple peel, raisin, and prune, but you wouldn't want to drink too much of it quickly."

"I love this beer. Phenomenal for its own level of sweetness. Always a good choice. 4.25"

"Thick, almost dirty appearance; like freshly stomped grapes with all the residue that goes with it. Strong smell of fig, reminds me of the fig newtons I loved as a kid; you can also catch a hint of alcohol in the nose - not surprising considering the high ABV (11%). Nothing tame about the aroma. Wow! Tastes of grapes, fig, sweet caramel, and a little alcohol bite; sweet and fruity after taste. Mouthfeel - Like a high gravity, squeezed fruit drink, very full bodied. Overall - This is about as good as it gets for a quad. I didn't think I would find one better than Trappistes Rochefort 10 but this one is tops it in my book - a little pricey at about $19 for a four pack but well worth it."
""
"Who cares if this wasn't a session beer? You'll want more than one in a sitting anyways. I had the 11.2 oz. bottle that didn't even expire until January but that was more than enough to get a feel for this. Not all quads are created equal and the spice and heavy mouthfeel weren't present here. What resulted was a beer that would be a dessert until itself, unassumingly shoving dinner aside in the process. A must-have for anyone who love Belgian Beers without the seriousness underneath the surface. Really fabulous take on the style!"
""
""
"Sweet smell, typical of Belgian quads, tastes of dried dark fruit such as plums, raisins and dates. Thick and syrupy that is a beer that takes a lot of time to finish. The 11 percent abv is noticeable with the smell of alcohol. Also the taste of alcohol is present at the finish similar to a glass of wine. Otherwise the finish was excellent. You can also notice the legs on the glass when finished."
""
""
"This beer is in a class of its own. I dont know what class, but never had anything like it. Super nice quad that pours a thick ruby black. Taste like a pissed off chocolate cake. Smells like honey and brown sugar. How the 11% is hidden so well I will never know. Mouthfeel is creamy but a bit awkward like a junior prom tongue kiss behind the first base dugout, but unforgettable just the same. This damn beer is so sweet and strong. I don't know what to do with this...?"

"Pours an almost opaque crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, spice, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with super sweet dark fruit and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's very sweet and sugary, even for the style."

"Poured from a 11.5 oz bottle, that was bottle on Jan 25, 2012! The color was a cocoa black with minimal head as poured into my liberated pub glass. The aroma was pleasant with only a slight knod to the 11% abv. First taste revealed hints of dark chocolate, caramel and figs, but surprisingly little alcoholic bite! This is a very smooth beverage! It is a tad heavy so like another poster suggested, this would not be a good choice for a summer BBQ, however a perfect choice for later on! World class all the way!"

"It is a dark, sweet beer. Not something I might drink on a hot afternoon. However in the evening, this is my favorite beer. Heavy, filling, unique. I have never had a beer quite like this one. This beer is like ""Port"" is to Wine. It is a beer with a different, unique flavor, that is great to finish off an evening with. Belgium classic."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Beige head on a hazy deep tudor brown body. Soapy lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma includes candi sugar, brown sugar, dates, overripe banana, some alcohol and raisins. Mouthfeel is thick, tongue coating. Tasting notes are similar to the aroma although the alcohol is not noted on tasting. Very nice quad, as expected from Kasteel."
""
""
"i had to give it 4.5's across the board. it's got its ups and downs but this is an enigma. this is special. this a quad and quads are complex. i dont have the patience to evaluate most quads, i just appreciate the ability to drink it and the high abv. i'm a lush, eh? what more can you expect from me? it all comes out here and now. i think i need a good stout after this...."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Very little alcohol which is surprising for the ABV. A tad sweet, otherwise quite nice. Warms up to become nice and smooth. Doesn't break the mold but definitely does the trick."
""
""
""
"Taste is not quite as complex as the aroma but is wonderful, full, well-rounded and approachable despite the richness and strength. It has sweet-spicy dried fruits, ginger cake, port, sweeter up front but a slightly direr finish of dark toast and dried fig. It is not extremely complex, but has some complexity and a nicely well-rounded character. Feel is firm with a hint of oiliness but also a bit lively, and it is not heavy or truly oily, much less viscous. The high abv is hinted at in the port-like element, but otherwise the boozy alcoholic quality is nicely restrained, adding an enriching warmth without making the booziness overtly noticeable, much less harsh in any way."
""
"A quad that can stand among the elite abbey and trappist quads of the world."
""

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe Chalice. Dark with auburn edges, almost opaque. A small tanned head bursted out towards the end of the pour but it faded straight away. Initially the yeasty, cranberry aroma was weak but it got stronger as the beer warmed. Tasted brown sugar, cranberry, cherry, yeast and molasses. Finish was delayed and had a biscuity edge to it, there was also a slight burn from the booze. Had an initial prickly edge from the carbonation, smooth texture, light bodied for the strength. I liked how it hid the booze, need to explore a few more strong dark Belgian ales before I can really give a good judgement on this."
""
""

"Bottle from Belgian Beer Shop. Very beautiful dark red brown colour. Thick, creamy beige head that lasts very well. The aroma is malty, dark fruits, sweet, clear alcohol presence. Candy sugar, sweet, vinous, creamy, malty, heart warming. Very complex. Super beer."
"O. Damn good Quad. Up there with the best. Nice balance. Hides the ABV away without a trace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with crimson highlights, sporting nearly an inch of beige head. The aroma offers dark fruits, yeast, malt, alcohol, brown sugar. The taste follows suit, with the 11% abv well hidden. Sweet, but not cloying. Thick body with moderate carbonation. Palate coating and a tad syrupy. Notes of nuts (clever alliteration, n'est pas?), perhaps almonds. Brown sugar, spices, perhaps nutmeg. a solid quad. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall: Greatbigbeer! Strong and sweet, I would drink a few of the these over the colder months. As it sits it is quite pleasent in warm weather only as long as you dont excert yourself."

"The 11% ABV also puts an upper boundary on this beer's drinkability for me."
"O - This is the first beer I have drank of this style, but overall I am impressed. For a beer with 11% ABV, aside from its high level of sweetness (almost too sweet for my personal taste), it is very easy to drink. A little added carbonation may help balance out the sweetness, but that is just a small note to make in comparison to the many qualities this beer contains."

"Had this on my Belgian beer tour at a little bar in Bruge,recommended by a local. It poured a dark rich color with a minimal head and very little lace. I tend to prefer golden beers but this was a delicious dark beer. It had a lightness and sweetness to it that I was not expecting."

"Picked up in southern Spain. 750 ml bottle with a best by date of July 2016. Poured into my wine glass and it had a minimal head. Very much a dark fruity small and taste. Not much head but it was light brown head and did lace slightly. Deep brown almost ruby color. Lots of fig cherry sweet dark fruit taste. Definitely a sipper and some warming from the alcohol. Very heavy beer and coats the mouth and throat. Overall a splendid quadruple dark Belgian and will consider packing a few when I leave Spain and will continue to stock this."
""
"see you on the next one."
""
"What a wonderful beer. It is like drinking a nice glass of port. It's definitely a sipper and not the easiest beer to drink, and I think it could use a bit more carbonation to help stimulate the palate, but that doesn't take away from its great qualities. I wouldn't suggest this to someone new to beers of this caliber. It has a lot of complexity and a lot of power."
"Yes I can give this beer a lower rating than 4 for taste, it is just way too sweet."
""
"o: splendid, although somewhat sweet quad. alcohol was present but surprisingly, did not end up being a detraction. lots of complexity, and still incredibly smooth."
""
"O: Tastes like sweet raisins. If you like that sort of thing, this might be your beer."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. The one I had was part of a Belgian sampler and I went out the next day and bought a whole case."

"Price Point - $4.79/11.2 oz bottle"
"Furthermore, an above average beer but not really special."
""
""
"Among the best tasting substances to ever come from a bottle, a perfect quad."
""
""
"M: Complex sensations that starts neutral with some sweetness that rapidly changes into bittersweetness and then bitterness at the end not too hard on the mouth but present and also the alcohol sensation hits almost at the same time."
""
"Alcohol is well concealed, don’t feel it much in both aroma and flavor, indeed a worthy pick."
"Wow - tremendous treat here. If you are even remotely interested in Belgian ales you must pick this up if you see it."
"Overall, best quad I've tried yet. Complete package."
"O: An excellent sipper. Can't take more than a baby sip because it's so complex and sweet. It's not something you could have a lot of (high alcohol) and incredibly unique flavor experience. Good stuff. However, I would only want one once a year. Waay to rich to be an all the time beer on hand."
"I am no fan, generally speaking, of quads. This quad is a bit sweet, but somehow stays in balance and is not overwhelming. Nice looking beer. The belgian yeast comes through with a smooth, light tasting nuttiness, that moves toward the cherry/plum taste. Very drinkable, not much alcohol detected. Lightly delicate with nice lacing out of the tulip. Extremely nice beer, better than I remembered it when I had it around 6 years ago."
"A truly great beer!"
"Poured in a goblet to facilitate taste and smell; it developed a nice half inch head dissipating slowly. I sniffed it for the first time getting a strong scent of caramel and detected a subtle hoppy background; I tasted this brew and my palate detected flavors of caramel, toffee and fruity complex flavors like guava, this brew is sweet…I like the after taste and honestly I want to drink more. ..and remember folks to support your local brewery DRINK BEER. HOG"

"In short, if you like bock-style beers, this is definintely one to try and enjoy!"

" Relax baby, I'll fill you with money and keep you happy."
"The mouth needs more carbonation, but I recon the aging may have toned this department down a bit too much. I don't think cellaring this one helped it much. Medium body and not as smooth going down as the best I've had in this style."
"The noted lack of head comes through in the mouthfeel. It's not bad, but, lacks some of the pillowiness I'd have hoped for. Really, a touch of CO2 is all that is missing from making this a world beater. Of course, it did travel some route to get from Belgium to Anchorage, and who knows how that went for it. There is alot of good here no matter how you slice it. The flavor, in this ""sweet quad"" is superb."
"Fantastic for a sweet Belgian bruin - like a Gouden Carolus. Sweet food pairing brings out apple, perhaps prunish tartness."
"D- One of the best Quads i have tasted ....end of story"
"At the risk of sounding prudent, the Donker is sweet indulgence at 11% ABV. Like a still life from the Dutch Masters—it is deep, dark and decadent, sinful, pouring over with color and life. And like the Master's, it's imbalance is overt, with opulence overbearing from the deep... leaving me searching for a bit of light in it's darkest corners."
"O - This is another very solid beer from Kasteel and recommended."
"Overall: Quite smooth for the ABV. Will age well. I should keep other bottle for a few more years. A bit too sweet and has an annoying alcohol bite."
"I was served this beer at a small bar in Brussels, Belgium. I am a huge lover of dark beers and was really excited to try this. It was poured in the proper glassware and had a very nice mahogany color to it. I got about a 1/2"" of head to it, which receded fairly quickly. The smell was surprisingly sweet. I was expecting more of a subdued earthy scent, but this smelled almost like cherry cough syrup. The first sip yielded more of the cough syrup taste, but as I let it roll around in my mouth a bit, I tasted more of a molasses/brown sugar hint. Honestly, I feel as though this is a good beer, but it is hard for me to get past the cough syrup taste of it."
"C-"
"Poured a dark semi-hazy brown with just a bit of head that receded to a film of bubbles. Caramel malts and peppery spice in the aroma, and distinct alcohol. Similar taste with sweet malts and Belgian sugar, slight molasses, and some dark fruits also noticeable; not as much spice as I detected in the aroma. Medium-heavy body with some carbonation, pretty drinkable, but a bit strong."
"O: What a great beer, complex, easy to get and affordable make this a great quad."
"Overall: Nothing I have ever drank before with an 11+% ABV has been smoother. Truly a wonderfully crafted beer."
"Aroma is malty with caramel and bread hints and a noticeable alcohol nip. It pours a dark, slightly hazy mahogany with a thick, fairly persistent pale tan head. Flavor is malty and surprisingly sweet, having tones of honey, caramel and toffee in addition to the malt. Alcohol bite is more subtle than in the aroma. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy, leaving behind a soft but persistent tingle. Finish is sweet but not cloying, and has a nice alcohol nip to it."
"As drinkable as any 11% quad is ever going to be. This beer exhibits absolutely amazing balance and does everything right. It also reminds me exactly which country first awakened me to the vast possibilities of beer. Time to refocus my buying habits toward Belgium again. This is superb."
"Poured a clear dark brown with a small light brown creamy head that disappeared very quickly and had fair lacing. The aroma was of nutty dark malts and a horse blanket scented yeast with notes of brown sugar, raisons and dried fruit. It tasted sweet, rich and malty with hints of brown sugar at the start but matured into a nice sweet-sour yeasty flavor with notes of dried fruit at the end that left the flavor lasting an average duration on the taste buds. Mouthfeel was medium in body and nice and creamy in texture. Overall a very interesting brew. Sweet yet bold in flavor, which did a great job of concealing the high alcohol content. One definitely worth trying again."
"D. This was my ultimate beer then somehow its qualities were not as good as they once were. I noticed on the label that it no longer seems to be re fermented in the bottle and it is noticeable, which is why I have given it lower marks than I would have liked. Still, a mighty barleywine that will keep you good company whilst reading a bed time book."
"Absolutely a beautiful beer. Pours a ruby red with a small head that lays on top throughout. The aroma is fruity with raisins and grapes, maybe some plums. The taste is sweet with the fruits coming through. A very nice burn develops as it warms. The finish is quite lingering and very nice, warming all the way. This is a sipping on a cold night type of beer, not designed for tailgating."
"Drinkability: I will not have this one again."
"1998 vintage. Knowing i really don't like this beer fresh (waaay too sweet with sharp alcohol) i was very curious popping this bottle. Poured into a kasteel beer glass. The beer pours a dark brown colour with no head. Smell is very sweet: dark fruits, figs plums and the typical vintage smell. Taste is still sweet,but much less strong than the fresh one.plums, figs,candy sugar. This beer is so balanced,it is incredible. Very soft mouthfeel,no sharpness at all, liquid silk. Reminds me of a good porto. One of the best vintage beers i ever had!"
"Once again, this is my first foray into Belgian ales. Two friends had different bottles of Delirium at the same time, and after tasting the other two, I will say that I liked this one the most."
"I have to agree with LordAdmNelson. I dont know if I must have got a bad bottle myself... but this did not taste like beer. This tasted like a cheaper bottle of champagne, smells like over sweetened champagne and the abundance of carbonation would lead me to believe this was just a bottle of extra sweet champagne. The aroma is of grapes, definitely no scent of hops, malt or barley. When poured, the color was a golden yellow and did not look too bad, but mixed with the overly strong taste of stale grapes, that severely impacted my score, which is a total shame since I paid $9.99 for a big bottle. Very very disappointing."
"Poured a murky brown with minimal head. Nose is all phenols and a fake grape-y-ness. Gross. Taste is the same, this over-sweet, fake awful grape note. Feel is fine, drinkability is zero. Awful, awful, awful. Drainpour."
"overall, an enjoyable warming beer, or nightcap."
"I am glad, I tried this beer!"
"Give me this one on a cold night, sitting in front of a fire. It's definitely a great brew."
"One of my top three beers. Slight oaky smell. Sweetness is there at first, and all the way through. No bitterness at all. At the right temperature, sort of reminds me of a ""flat"" coke. In a good way! So smooth, rich and full. Very sweet and rich. very drinkable with a wonderful mouthfeel."
"Flavors of roasted malts are most noticeable as they sweep over the tongue. Dark, dried fruits such as figs, raisins and plums reveal themselves in the center. The creamy, long finish brings out the most of this rich brew."
"D-oh boy, the ABV on this one comes in to play. a better one of this style that i've had and i truly do want to have this again. not an easy drinker, but definitely a happy drinker."
"Great taste, sweet smell and sweet in the mouth. This is a well balanced top fermented beer. Dark sugars."
"I did not fell in love with this one. Some interesting characteristics but overall it is too sweet for my taste."
"jd"
"D: it's a respectable quadruple, for sure. But this 10 ounces cost me $11 (!) and at that price, I expect to be gobsmacked with pure deliciousness. On this front, sadly, Kasteel did not deliver."
"Donker is a funny name."
"medium-plus/borderline full bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. i wouldn't mind having this again in the future, but as far as this sitting is concerned i can see the 750 bottle wearing on me soon."
"D - This is a very tasty quadrupel. It is certainly worth a try, especially on tap."
"D - Hard to answer. One is very nice. I wouldn't have two. Two would be awful. For a nice dessert, I think this is wonderful. But just one."
"D: This was a solid dark Belgian ale with a very sweet character. It had great body, and the alcohol wasn't bad (even though it was noticeable), so it was easy to drink. Great candidate for aging, but also enjoyable fresh."
"Really interesting beer and I'd like to try others from this brewery."
"What a great beer! I only wish that the year was as good as it's first beer."
"This is one sweet muuhfuuh."
"Definitely a sipper, but it's delicious and interesting enough to keep you going."
"D: I find this beer a bit too sweet for my taste. I may be able to drink a bottle of it, and maybe two if accompanied by food. it has a high alcohol content for long drinking anyway. Would be an excellent replacement for a sweet wine, but not the thing you could drink in a casual manner. You kind of have to set aside your time psyche to admire it."
"D: This is a pretty sweet beer, but still ok for such a high alcohol content. Masked very well, there is hardly any burn, but the sweetness does become a little annoying later down the line. Pick this one up to give it a try - could be a good gateway beer into Belgians, but I could have used a bit more balance."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but due to the sweetness and tendency to coat the mouth, this beer may be best when coupled with some other dark ales (like Unibroue La Terrible) in a session."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"I can see this going well with a rich cheesecake or something equally bold and sweet, and maybe it mellows over time. That said, I won't drink this again as a stand-alone beer, and don't think I could get through a 750ml. Not bad, but I'm not likely to revisit this (again)."
"Drinkability- not bad but a little to much alcohol and packs a bit of heavy punch for smooth easy drinking, would have tough time finishing whole bottle but enjoyable flavor overall"
"Not my style of beer, however I enjoyed the adventure."
"This is one of those ales that inspires people to make the claim that 'beer is more sophisticated than wine'. While wishing to keep myself out of that discussion, I'll admit, Kasteel Bruin certainly helps out their argument - it really does transcend the world of malted beverages. Any first-rate, self-respecting beer cellar will keep this in stock."
"I'm not sure I can finish this beer. I'm afraid that it will give me a headache. I'm not fond of the sugary flavor and maybe it's because I am unfamiliar as to what a donker should taste like. If this indicative of the style then I'll steer clear. I'm now hesitant to try their tripel."
"Not best in style, but a suitable brew for dark fruit Belgian lovers."
"I'll be going back for more for sure."
"D: For such a strong beer, you don't really taste the alcohol. This is very drinkable and I would definitely have another."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this one. This is a world-class beer without question. I think it is a little underrated here on BA. Definitely worth seeking out!"
"Overall, this is way overly sweet. It's a bit of a treacly mess. As it warms and I get accustomed to the sweetness a little nutty malt and banana come out. So there's some complexity, but the sweetness overwhelms everything and makes it rather unpleasant."
"D - quite drinkable. enjoyable to sip and let it warm you"
"Drinkability: actually, quite drinkable for its strength. I'm going to enjoy this glass a lot."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. I think that it could use a good bit more carbonation. The cork was only in the bottle just over a half-inch, so maybe a little bit leaked while it was being stored. The cork has a Dec2008 stamp on it, so the beer really isn't that old considering the ABV. Oh well, I like the beer overall, and I wouldn't mind trying it again...especially if it was on tap when the carbonation was controlled."
"The 11% ABV really fried me!!"
"I was a little disappointed in this beer. Several of my friends say this is the best beer that they have ever tasted but I found it to be extremely sugary and sweet. Good alcohol content at 11% and no indication of the kick until its on you. Very expensive - buy 1 bottle and try before you spend the $100 plus on a 12 750ml bottle case."
"Notes: Really is like a liquid dessert. Lots of dark sweet fruit and sugar. Some may think too much (and at times/moods I would probably agree), but I think overall this is a great beer with lots of good flavors. Memorable one also, definitely worth a try."
"Nothing wrong with the high alcohol content, which is masked by its syrupy character"
"Felt the carbonation was a tad too low especially for something this strong served in a Champagne-like bottle. Sweet malt dominates producing flavors of chocolate covered fruit along with fresh wild cherries. The subtle bitterness is juxtaposed by big sweetness finishes somewhat boozy reminding me of straight coffee liquor."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, citrus, tart malt, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, slight hops, caramel, slight tart malt, yeast, and slight cherry. Overall, good body, but noticeably strong alcohol dominates."
"M/D: Smooth but thick, this beer does have a good amount of alcohol warmth in the aftertaste/exhale. A good one to share, this would have been hard to drink alone. I think it was a bit too sweet. I imagine that time would do this one well, as it would balance out somewhat."
"Overall probably not my first choice for a Belgian, but I will definitely try others."
"Great beer. One of my favorites when in want something real sweet."
"D: One of those good Belgian beers that gets stuck in the middle. Good beer for sure but not excellent. I got this one for free so for me it is a steal and a good beer. If I paid over $10 for it then it would be a bad beer. Horrible economics but facts."
"You don't want to drink much of this...but a few sips on a cold night, and then off to beddy-bye with sweet dreams, Oh yes!"
"Poured into a Chimay Chalice. Small white head that dissipates quickly. Color is a rich brown with a little amber on the edges. The smell is candi sugar and ripe figs. The taste is sugary sweet! After it warms up the taste isn't as potent. The stickiness of the brew brings down the motuhfeel and drinkability. It will warm you up at the end of the night. A definite sipper."
"Chocolate aroma and taste of both toasted bread and dried fruit. In the mouth it is thick, has a taste of port, but more importantly, it is overly loaded with sugar. It feels the sugar granules on the tongue. The taste of alcohol is therefore fairly well hidden and is therefore withdrawn. Unbalanced and heavy."
"It's like drinking a dessert! A bit too sweet but very nice to be sipping of!"
"I could drink myself to death on this beer."
"A fine sipper, and would make an excellent dessert all on its own."
"The taste is fairly nice, but isn't spectacular. And the mediocre mouth drags it down a little more. There is a nice variety of hints, plums and dates, anise, lots of candied sugars I'm sure. It suffers from too much sweetness really, like they were trying too hard to juice this thing up. And juiced up it gets, much too thick, too little carbonation, it doesn't get to the point of being difficult to drink, but if just a little better, I feel this could have been quite nice."
"D: Because of the high ABV, this is an okay sipper. I have this 750 ml bottle to finish myself, and that's probably going to be difficult. This is good to share with a friend. Especially if that friend likes sweet, boozy beers."
"Kasteel Donker (which is the exact same beer as Kasteelbier Bruin-Brune) is pretty good stuff. That said, there's definite room for improvement. Belgian beer is like ice cream and cheesecake. Even the less than spectacular ones are pretty damn good."
"This is quite a brew. Rather a bit syrupy for my taste but it doesn't necessarily taste bad. As for the style of a strong dark Belgian ale, I suppose, but it's closer to cough syrup. I did enjoy it overall though and if you are feeling adventurous, give it a shot."
"Avoid."
"D: Very good beer. I haven't had a true quad in a while and this one fit the bill. Great example of the style."
"Great beer, but it made me itch. Hmm... that's never happened before. Either way, it's worth drinking."
"Drink it slowly, drink it wisely, coz it WILL kick you in a place where it hurts."
"Bottom line: If you're expecting a Rochefort, Chimay Blue, or St. Bernardus, you'll be quite disappointed. In contrast, if you like some of the sweeter Belgian-style darks/dubbels (Grimbergen comes to mind), you may find this enjoyable. If I brewed this myself, I'd lament the lack of attenuation."
"Chestnutbrown coloured , creamy thin head, the boozyness is upfront in both the smell and the taste, but nevermind that. It's fruity and malty, but mainly the whole brew is too much sweetness from caramel and candy burnt sugar, to me a bit over the top."
"Drinkability is OK, not this beers strong suit, as it is so intense you must sip slowy. The kind of beer you need to sip with water. An extreme quad, and must try for lovers of the style. A bit too much for me here though to love."
"Served in a brand chalice at Lucky Baldwin's, Pasadena, CA"
"Drinkability- One's good for me thanks."
"could be a fan of this brew, cause it's that good .i would pick up a bottle of this again in the future .a fun treat ..cheers."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Has a dark color, like a coke but with a hint of read. Head was a dark beige that dissipated into a ring rather quickly. Smelled of dark fruits. Tasted like a light rum; a mix of sugarcane and a little bit of spices were there. Alcohol taste started to become prevalent after it warmed. Mouthfeel was thick but not too bubble. Overall pretty good. I was worried that it would be too heavy for an 11%, but there wasn't a strong alcohol kick at all, instead just a subtle feeling in the aftertaste."
"M/D: This is more of a treat beer, though it wasn't too hard to put down a good 10 ounces of it. Nice medium body, overall an interesting and excellent beer."
"Tip: the bottle says that you have to serve it at 12°C but I'd drink it a bit colder to mute the sweetness a bit."
"Overall, a very interesting and vinous beer. The mouth feel is thick and coats the palate with a sweet raisin taste - very full flavor."
"Drinkability: Like good Quads should, I'd imagine, this has certainly gotten better with age, along with being much smoother now. There's still a big sweetness there, and I wonder if that would get even less so as it ages more. I'd imagine this could last much longer in the cellar, but after 4 or 5 years, it's still going strong."
"Its pretty good, but you can't drink more than one."
"night 2 of the Reston-DC extravaganza featuring the father of filth, 375 at Granville Moore's jkhylojhoijoijoijoijioiuojloijij"
"drinkability: good enuff"
"Fun, Definitly worth a try."
"Like I said, this is a very potent, dark Belgian ale that I quite enjoyed, even if it is ridiculously sweet and the booze is quite powerful. Regardless, the rum-raisin notes and sugary-candy flavors pair nicely with the huge, peppery alcohol blast and finishes nicely with that sweet bready flavor on the palate. Definitely the best strong dark ale I've tried up to this point. Very surprised that there are only 11 reviews for this beer - its a definite must try!"
"I think this is an overall good beer, and probably should've waited until colder times to sample this bruin."
"OVERALL: Definitely a tasty treat. It's certainly aged well. I enjoyed this one much more than their triple. A solid, drinkable brew, worth having again."
"Rich mouthfeel and pretty long lasting sweet finish"
"Rich dark brown with crimson highlights and a tan head, this is a pretty beer. Lots of lace, densely bubbled foam, yeah...looks good. The aroma is fantastic as well, with ripe fruit, a little roasted malt (with lots of melanoidins), plenty of alcohol, and a light plum scent. Not as intense as I expected. The flavor, though, is notably impressive. Malty and sweet, low bitterness and decent alcohol feel. Intense malt flavor, and the plum qualities really come out in the taste. The mouthfeel is full and luxuriously smooth. The one downside to the beer is it's sweetness, which is not balanced at all, and can become a bit cloying at times. Still, this is a fantastic brew!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0902-Larry"
"One thing of note though, i had this brew before and i remember a strong distinct sourish character in the beer that i did not find this time around. I'm hopping to try this beer again to see how it holds up against my two previous experiences."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium body with moderate delicate tiny carbonation bubbles. Nothing all that special about it really. It does feel just as it should though, I can't see this one feeling any different and having it work as well as what it already is. This is an easy brew to drink and its worth picking up and trying. I know that I'll be going back to it in the near future. Its a great beer that I feel is overlooked."
"I really wanted to like this beer because I really like the Rouge from Kasteel, and at first I thought I was going to be disappointed. If tasted cold this beer is less than great, with both nose and palate closed. I would suggest serving this just barely below room temp (NC in mid-March). The nose doesn't open much, but it tastes tons better."
"Notes: I kept thinking of a Raison d'extra from DFH while drinking this."
"Get it, try it, love it. And leave it at 1."
"A refreshing example of the style. A bit too sweet at times but it has enough depth to stand up to other examples. Very drinkable."
"Beer is a dark, dark brown with little head. Gorgeous lace envelops the glass as you work your way through the beer. Smell is reminiscent of molasses and anise. Beer is very rich and complex in flavor; molasses, candied sugar, chocolate, portlike. Alcohol makes itself known but is well masked by the strong, rich flavors. Chewy and sticky on the palate; it's one of those beers that you can still taste for minutes after the last sip . . . and it leaves you wanting more. Not for the faint of heart with it's alcohol level but definitely a great sipping beer to be savored. I really liked this beer and will seek it out again. Holds it's own against some of the best strong belgian darks out there. I likened it to St. Bernardus Abt 12."
"Nice ruby brown color with an admirable sized head. Soft peppery aroma with a mild malt note. Huge malty flavor with a moderate caramel sweetness. Very slight hop bite. Mellow dried fruit flavor. Lacks the yeasty/sulfury notes most Belgians exhibit. No trace of alcohol at 11%. Must use quite the clean yeast to ferment. Great body-has a slight creaminess to it. I find this to be a great beer, rather sweet but I like them like that. This would be a great Belgian to turn someone who has never had one on to. Might not be to style but I really like this one."
"Poured an almost black body with a constantly there one-finger tan head in a tulip glass. A strong fruit smell, like orange and a little grape (dark fruit), and some hints of sweet and bread malts. A great smoothness is what first struck me with this beer, as there is a balance between the malts (some sweet and bread, little oaky even) and dark/heavy fruits (orange, grape again). A little sticky and syrupy, like there's some molasses in there, but finishes clean with a little bit of a hop prickle on the tongue. A solid beer to sip and relax with as the ABV is well-hidden."
"The smell was fruity and of brown sugar. The fruits were definitely apple dominated with a tinge of sourness. The taste was sweet then sour. You got a good malt taste up front then it was dominated by a fruity apple-nation. The abv is pretty well hidden and isn't too apparent till it hits the throat and leaves a burn. Overall it is a pretty good BSDA."
""
"The mouthfeel is well-laced with a balance of hops, fruit, alcohol, and a wood-induced earthiness. The drinkability and finish are not as well-rounded as I have come to expect from most Belgians, but the complexity and taste speak for themselves."
"Brown colored ale with a very rapidly fading head.Aroma is dark fuits.Taste is sugar cane,raisins,plum fig and dark cherries.Alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste but believe me this is not an ale you would want to play quarters with.Overall a solid ale that I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"Smells of dark roasted malts and some fruit. Taste is very sweet with dark fruits abounding. Pretty big alcohol on the finish for me. Really sweet sticky finish. Very creamy feel smooth, but the alcohol and sweetness is a little too much. Very interesting beer very different than a lot of the other ""quads"" not really my favorite, but fine nonetheless."
"D: This beer goes down pretty damned easy. I kept catching myself taking bigger and bigger ""sips"" as I went on. I didn't want to get trashed, so I slowed myself about. All categories are solid or higher. This beer is damned good and I have to thank Frank for telling me about it. The price at just $7.50, further helps the drinkability because it doesn't break the bank. Great beer."
"D: This is a solid Belgian beer that's well made and goes down easy despite its high ABV."
"Pours a four-finger brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Mahogany/brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is caramel, dark fruit, sweet. Clean finish. High ABV is hidden. I need more of these to cellar! Bottled Jul 2007, $4.20 for a 330ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"Overall a VERY good belgian style brew. Doesnt have the definitive butteriness of a Quad, but it is close, while still showing some other BSDA qualities. This one is sort of a style melder, but the style that it does fit perfectly into, is the one on the label, (funny how that works) which is belgian brown ale. A fantastic beer, one I think is a good cellar candidate for sure, especially with its mighty abv. Drink this one slowly and savor it, let it warm, and dont let the abv get the best of you, and you WILL be pleased. One that will satisfy the craving for the greatest of belgian style freaks. A classic."
"D: The high alcohol content can be a bit overwhelming after a while, and the sweet flavours started to overwhelm my palate as it went down. A good beer, but very intense, and best suited for very slow consumption."
"This was a tasty brew, good quad that I could drink again."
"If you see one of these (in this area that's not so easy!) you should grab it up, put it away and forget about it. When you find it trust me it will make your day!"
"A medium-full body, light effervescence, warming of the palate and throat. Quite smooth. Overall, good stuff."
"D: It was a good quadrupel with decent balance and flavor. It ranks behind others in its class but it is a good contender. It is a bit robust for a session brew."
"The appearance is a really pretty dark brown that appears to be a deep burgundy red when held up to light. The head is very thin, almost nonexistent. Smells good, kind of sugary sweet with maybe hints of caramel and, call me crazy, tobacco. The taste is almost shockingly sweet, too much for me. You can feel the alcohol at the end. The start is like caramel, followed by molasses and dark fruits like figs. Somewhat syrupy, maybe. Feels very smooth like a cognac. The effervescence is subtle. Overall decent drinkability. Great beer, although I personally find it to be too sweet."
"Wow, this is an amazingly tasty beer. I love it. Rich and complex, tantalizingly sweet. Awesome. I could drink this damn near all night, or at least until the 11% knocked me out."
"The body is a bit cloying with the sweetness. The lack of carbonation might be effecting this. Overall, this is way too sweet for a quad, not even throwing a Belgium quad into the mix. Some off notes in the nose and continue into the taste. Maybe it's some cup of quad, but there are better US version out there."
"Overall a really tasty complex beer, though it could be too sweet for some."
"D: Very drinkable - more so than the alcohol content really allows - especially if you have to get up in the morning. Surprisingly the sweetness doesn't become cloying at all."
"Can 't taste the alcohol but you can smell it and feel it."
"Cloying,with some stickyness yet smooth and suprizing drinkability."
"D: A nice drink overall, but definitely a slow sipper and the bomber will take a while to get through. The alcohol was noticeable but was halfway through the bottle before I read the 11.0% abv which soon made sense. A good drink I thought but more wine then beer which sways me not to try again."
"HV"
"Cheers!"
"The feel of the drink is just about perfect. The drink is soft, light, and well-carbonated, and is about as quaffable as a big 11% abv brew can be."
"Drinkability is good. This is a desert beer if there ever was one."
"Might be the best example of this style I've come across. Pours a deep brown with a good head. Has wonderful raisin and plum notes, very boozy tasting (in a good way). The mouthfeel is rich and thick without ever being sticky. Some wine-like flavors come through late. Highly recommended."
"This is an easy beer with which to get snookered. It's subtle and powerful. It isn't a beer with complexity."
"D: For a quadrupel, this is pretty drinkable. That said, I don't know if I could handle more than one in a go, but I'm definitely looking forward to the rest of this one."
"Not a ton of carbonation (surprising) brings forth a very dark, cloudy amber colored beer with just a half inch of off-white head that soon falls to a trace. Aromas are a mix of spicy phenolics, dark fruits, bright alcohol and a touch of toasty malt notes. On the palate, it is a very rich, thick Belgian with tons of malty flavors, minimal carbonation and a pretty sweet finish. Overall, it's a bit different than most BSDA, but I like how they presented it."
"Alcohol content is not obvious in the tasting, but as I drink this I begin to feel it. Couldn't see having more than one of these. This would make a marvelous dessert beer, something to be sipped and savored slowly."
"Overall, a different quadrupel than the ones I'm used to and that I enjoy more. This was still interesting but I don't think I would go for it again."
"Way too drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very good beer and incredibly smooth for the strength, but it doesn't quite have the awe-inspiring complexity of the great quads. Still, very much worth trying."
"Sip this, one serving per sitting - but what a sitting!"
"On tap at Pitcher's Pub in Cumberland, RI. Pours dark brown. Nice aroma of dark fruits, brown sugar, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor of dark fruits and brown suagr with a warming alcohol finish. Has a very vneous quality, Quite tasty, but very sweet, which is a little distracting. Underneath the sweetness is a beer with a loy of complexity. I enjoyed the beer, but it's defintely not an everyday beer."
"this thing is just too sweet, without enough other complexities that stand out or even hold their own. maybe passable as a dessert, but even then the medicinal notes might detract from that as well..."
"D: It is very sweet and not tart enough to balance all of the flavors to drink an entire glass."
"D: This would be a very tasty brew if it weren't for that little bit of sour fruit in the back. Still, not terrible, and seems reasonably drinkable for a Quad."
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into two pint glasses. Very mixed feelings about this beer. Pours an opaque dark brown color that looks like murky pond water. Nose is sugar, candy, dried fruit. Taste is VERY sweet. Unfortunately, I could only handle a few sips of this beer. This beer is so sweet, it's nearly undrinkable. I've tried giving this beer a chance two times now, and both times, it's just too alcoholic and too sweet to finish. Not my favorite quad - too sweet to be truly enjoyable."
"drinkability: this is simultaneously full flavored and refreshing. I quickly finished the 1 pt 9.4oz bottle and wished for a case of the stuff. It's very drinkable."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, this one really didn't appeal to me all that well. I've certainly had other strong Belgians that I like better."
"I was expecting to enjoy it more as the 11 abv kicked in (like the 120 minute IPA, which went from cough syrup to amazing), but nothing doing - to be honest, I couldn't even finish it."
"The nose is sweet, caramel, apricot or figs or prune. The taste followed this nose. This beer is made with high standards but is too sweet for my tastes. Caramel and dark fruits prevail. Not a hop profile to speak of. Overall a good beer, but as as I said a tad sweet."
"750 ML green Belgian bottle copped caged and corked from Total Wine and More in West Orange... ""Kasteel Donker"" on the logo sticker... this beer packs a punch at a whopping 11% ABV... Pours a grape-colored hue with minimal frothy head that left apparent lacing around the top of my mug... Strong alcoholic and prune aroma leads to a taste complete with dark, dehyrdated fruits, raisins, currants, figs, caramel, and cinnamon... the strong alcohol content is certainly noticeable in both the flavor and aroma and makes itself known after a few sips with a warm, inviting glow... definitely a beer for colder-weather days... Although labeled as a quadrupel, this brew could easily pass as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale with its syrup and molasses quality... not my favorite-tasting sample, but a quality brew nontheless... strong, rich, and dark flavor is really highlighted... Worth a try..."
"Not my favorite quadrupel but a very good one."
"Thick and silky with ample carbonation. A very complex dark Belgian brew. Has a long shelf life, but I think it is best a around 1 year. I have aged a few for longer, but the sweetness gets out of balance."
"This baby would certainly make an excellent dessert after a hearty dinner."
"Out of a 750ml corked, caged, and foiled bottle. The cork indicates that it was born in November of 2003, the label states to drink by November of 2008. Pours a murky brown color with a nice off-white head that left a nice ring around the glass with some nice lacing. The smell is of mellow roasted malt, mellow dark fruit, and some port wine characteristics. A lighly roasted malt flavor, sweet, with a nice mellow wine grape flavor; quite olde ale like. Definitely port wine like; nice and mellow, nothing sharp here. A Belgian Olde Ale perhaps??? The feel is moderate with soft carbonation, finishes sweet, slick, and sticky. Definitely an aged sample here and aged well. The mellow flavor is quite good; it is very sweet but is quite drinkable. Some nice fruity flavors."
"Rich and smooth feel to it, very drinkable even at 11%, we polished off 4 (small) bottles on the night."
"Served in my Sam Adams Sensory glass. Poured the color of cola. Two inch thick, fluffy white head settled into a thin layer of foam. A sheet of belgian lacing blanketed the sides of the glass during the tasting. Strong scent of dark fruit immediately hits the nose (raisins, prunes, plums) followed by a sweet, sugary smell and a faint aroma of yeast. Taste similar to nose with a bit of alcohol astringency at the finish, which is pleasantly masked by the sweetness of the brew. Warm, full mouthfeel with a little liveliness on the tongue. This is a truly greaat Quadrupel, but definitely meant for savoring slowly."
"D: An interesting beer, I've heard this described as a Belgian Barleywine, and I can understand why, though Quadrupel seems to fit it well as a style on this site. A very good beer, sweet and warming, the smell and taste could use a bit more ""oomph," but overall, an enjoyable warming beer, or nightcap."
"itself or with a hearty meal. Suitable for sipping after dinner or for breakfast."
"I cannot add anything to the descriptions in the reviews for this beer. My only addition is that this is truly one of those beers that lives and dies by the temperature that it is served. Perhaps ""lives and dies"" is too harsh. I only mean to say, that if it is too cold, then the beer is easy to overlook. But, when it is warm, then the beer is very, very good indeed."
"Pours brown with amber hues, clear, a decent size light khaki colred head fades with light lacing. Aroma is nice pruney and plum malt sweetness, some good yeasty breadiness, apples, and fusel alcohol. Taste follows with a big malty sweetness, caramel and toffee, that is cut by a peppery and dry bready and alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy body, fairly lively carbonation cuts throught that and tingles on the tongue, some warmth and bite from the alcohol strength in the finish and a dryness in the finish as well. A good beer that was much better the closer it was to room temperature."
"A well made Belgian brew, alcohol hidden fairly well, but quite sweet. this makes it a bit less drinkable."
"Review translated from french 6-11-2008."

"This reminds me of one of my all-time favorites, gouden carolus noel / christmas. I'll take that over this, but I'll recommend both for the high abv category. But of the quads I've had, this is one of my least favorite."
"If you have the means, get your hands on this beer. I would have ordered another if I didn't have to drive home!"
"Drinkability: Very powerful brew but quite enjoyable. Best suited to having a single drink with some good cheese or as an accompaniment to a rich dessert. (Or maybe just have it as the dessert!) Can stand alone and is a wonderful brew to have with a good book or good friends after dinner."
"D--Worth a try I suppose, too sweet for me personally...packs a wallop."
"Pours a lovely chocolate brown with ruby tinges and little head. The nose is straightforward quad, with sugary smells, some raw alcohol, and lots of chocolate and some sweet, raisiny fruit notes. On the palate, overly sweet first off, with some definite cloying going on, before a dusty, slightly rough date element comes out. Some creamed-and-sugared coffee toward the end. The finish is long and active but way too sweet, with no balancing hop influence to speak of. Mouthfeel is hot with alcohol and heavy on malts, with little lightness on display. Not that I want my quads to be light, but you gotta have balance somewhere. Overall, this is not a good quad. Too sweet, no balance, and not nearly enough complexity to save things in any way. Pass."
"Pours a clear mohogany color with some tan head and plenty of lacing. Smells of dried and candied dark fruit, fig, rasins and very earthy. Taste is very complex. The earthy notes are the backbone to a nice and sweet fig, dried fruit and almost some cherry. Gets a little medicinal taste in the finish as it warms up. Full in the mouth but ever so smoooth. Very drinkable for such a high ABV brew. A delish experience indeed that must be tried."
"tough to rate as this is the first barleywine that I've ever had. I don't know if it was the style or just the alcohol in this beer, but it was really tough to swallow at times. I enjoyed everything about this except for the acidic, bitter surge that came to me when I swallowed. other than that, this is a great ""sit down and watch a movie"" beer"
"One of the best quads that I have had the pleasure to enjoy."
"This one really hides the 11% extremely well."
"Drinkability: Really a bit too cloying for my taste; compared to the top quads this lacks the complexity that the great ones have"
"Ruddy brown, with a small white head. Fairly powerful nose hints of Brown sugar, plums, dates, red apple, golden apple, caramel, toffee and a bit of barnyard. Flavor is extremely sweet and very fruity. Honestly, I think its a pretty tasty beer. Well hidden alcohol, with a balanced flavor. This is a fairly tasty, enjoyable Belgian."
"The sweetness and abv slow this one down, but it is a nice, complex, dark Belgian brew that is very nice to sip on."
"Pours a dark brown with a tan head that disapates quickly. In the aroma, it is a sweet caramel and alcohol smell. In the taste, the carmel is there and hints of bitter sweet chocolate. It has a small alcohol presence but it is so smooth and rich, the alcohol mixes well with the other flavors."
"and I was already slightly intoxicated. A pretty good but still a few steps to being a great beer."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle. It looks ruby red black in the glass. Is that possible? The head is minimal, tan, and a touch sticky. The smell is astringent, dusky malt, and sour cherries. The taste has a surprising sugar dominance over a cherry background. The finish shows the hops, subtle but adding a great balance. In the immortal words of Homer Simmpson....Swet Jeebus. This stuff is begging to be aged and that just became my plan for the 2nd bottle I have. The mouthfeel is syrupy but nicely carbonated. It has enough bubbles to keep it from falling into the trap that barley wines do for me. They become cloyingly sweet. My apologies to the fans of 35 year old Thomas Hardy ale but its not for me and this really is. The drinkability is excellent. Even though it clocks in at 11 percent the alcohol really only manifests itself as a warmth down the throat and chest. Nice, nice nice. If you can find this stuff. Buy it. Period."
"From a growler purchased at Half Time, pours dark mahogony, seems to be pretty low in carbonation, mellow head, with just minor lacing observed. Nose is nicely glowing with cola, vanilla, bourbon and spice. Strong late night sipper kind of brew. Plenty of dark candi sugars, cola, alcohol, complexity etc to please all the strong beer/quad lovers out there. Character, boldness obviously evident, well worth a try if you like the style, not for everybody, but certaintly for me! A treat and in nice shape on tap/growler."
"4's straight across. This is less expensive than some of the top rated quads, and I think it is worth the price. Very pleasant and drinkable, do not chug at 11% abv."
"As to the mouthfeel, I experienced a biscuity and chewy, viscous treat. Just perfect, or as close as you can get to it. This was a pleasure to enjoy and to think it was available on tap. I only wish the pubs in my area would pursue such a treasure as this. Thank you once again Brick Store !"
"I am very impressed with how good this beer is. In a nutshell, it's cotton-candy sweet, fruity tart, spicy warm, and marshmellow textured. It's wonderful from sip to finish. A hearty malt / candy sweetness blends with nuts, figs, dates, and a hint of chocolate. Balanced with aged hops and yeasty esters bring out clove and pepperyness. Full and richly textured without a hint of astringency or heat. Finishes very clean despite so many complex flavors, and a bit dry. This beer ranks up there with the Rocheforts and Abt 12s of the world."
"An odd brew, but a great one. It's great when fresh, and better when it's 3 years old (like this bottle is). I really think this needs another 5 to 10 years to really shine. I'll hold on to another few bottles for a decade or so to see how they turn out. Right now it is good, but it's just a little too ""cola like"". It really almost tastes like a thicker version of pepsi."
"It's not too sweet, but I consider it a dessert beer. It's full bodied but not thick. It's drinkable if you like big sweet beer moving from a dubbel sensibility into a big beer unique unto itself. It remains unique."
"Not amazing, but very solid, and something I'll buy again."
"Only had a lil' 33cl stubby bottle, could have drank a bigger jobber."
"This is a fine example of a quad. The 2004 bottle really held up well in comparison to the 2000. Aged a few more years, the alcohol subsides into some awesome flavors. I'll definitely be throwing more bottles in my cellar for a few years!"
"Not much carbonation, and it poured a dark brown w/red ruby-like color. The alcohol hits you right away, but it has a fantastic burnt caramel taste. I find it to be very heavy and filling. For me, it's powerful stuff and not to be taken lightly. I've had several bottles, and some are better than others, but most are very very good."
"This was a gorgeous beer, I'd love to get another shot at reviewing it."
"Highly recommended. This is a wonderful quad, and great on tap (I haven't tried a bottle yet, but will look forward to). Go, and drink some of this nectar."
"4+ year old 750ml bottle. Poured dirty - looking like rust and stagnant creek water. Aroma of dusty attic and dry earth. Flavor was sweet stewed dark fruit, with port and sherry notes. I keep my cellar bottles well, and they do not get light, heat, or physical disturbance, but this one must have had all the yeast completely in solution, because it was so cloudy, but without any floaty chunks etc. I have had my fare share of five and six year old Belgian ales, but this one was weird. It just came out all weird looking, but still tasted fine."
"D: I rate this one just above average. The large (11% abv) alcohol content is very well hidden but the overly sweet flavors make a dent in the drinkability factor for me. With more balance this beer could be quite good."
"Wonderful smell, delicious taste, and a solid, fantastic representation of the style. Smashing!!"
"Drinkability: A little sweet, but otherwise drinkable."
"Overall: This is a very good quad, but a bit overly sweet."
"The 11% is a little more evident, but complexity makes it more drinkable. Talk about your winter warmers! looking back at my review, my instincts were right, this better than the stuff supposedly in its prime"
"11.2 oz. Belgian stubby, with a freshness date of July 2010, served a bit too cold at Michael's Bistro and Taphouse in a small snifter. It pours a clouded brownish/red that is ruby in the light and is topped with a small, light brown head that retains a thin collar. The aroma is quite vinous, sugary sweet, with a blackberry kick. Think Chambord. It is hugely sweet on the palate, very port-like, with pepper, berries, and maybe some hops near the end. The body is medium, yet syrupy thick, with light carbonation and a medium finish. On the plus side, the alcohol is undetectable, but on the negative side, it is way too sweet and a bit difficult to drink, making me wonder as to why it is rated so highly."
"33cl bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy caramel brown. There was a very small head on mine. The aroma is quite nice. Caramel malt comes through, with some breadiness. Some fruits in there also, possibly raisins and plums. Very full, rich taste. Some candi sugar, plums, breadiness, many others. An exceptional brew."
"Taste was SWEET!! My teeth almost fell out of my mouth! Unbelievable. The alcohol is also very apparent and off course the beer is sticky. I could barely get my lipps off each other. Every other taste that is possibly in there is masked by the sweetness of the beer. I would not advise this to anyone who is a serious beeradvocate."
"Opened this with a friend to celebrate the births of my new daughter, and his new son. He stays away from dark beer but this one certainly won him over."
"Brown head with few bubbles. It doesn't last much and leaves almost no lace. Brown reddish very nice colour. Nose of chocolate, cherries, apricots and plums. A hint of vanilla. Sugar cane, alcohol, sherry aged wine. Heavy sweet flavor, I think that I notice it more in the 75 cl. bottle than in the 33 cl one. Don't know why, lately I find the sweetness a bit artificial. Mouth of chocolate, brandy, cherries, plums, apricots, sherry aged wine again, sugar cane, aniseed. A beer of the gods. One of them. Too complex to find all the characters in one taste."
"D - Wasn't particularly easy to drink. If you like sweet beer then give it a go, but it's not something I'll be trying again soon as I found the sweetness overpowering."
"Rich and fruity flavor. Alcohol still present in this nearly three year old sample. Sweetish and candy sugar flavore. Hints of plum and notes of port. Big beer, thick and sticky mouth although the low level of alcohol taste dries it out, keeps the sweetness in check. This is some nice brew. Some more for the cellar is in order."
"Pours clouded opaque dark brown with red edges. Small (half-inch) of creamy foam that rapidly recedes but leaves decent lace. Smells yeasty, full of dark fruits (cherries, plums), medicinal alcohol. Flavor begins with sweet & sour medicinal alcohol sting, becomes round and malty sweet in the middle and finishes the same way. Heavy, syrupy body with minimal carbonation. Not a great quad. Kind of heavy on the alcohol tones for my taste."
"--side note, I found near the end.. if you drink it slower than I would the adding up of the candy sweet taste does not really happen, SO I would recomend to drink this beer at a slower pace than me, to enjoy it the most, the problem is it will let you drink it fast cause its good."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer but is 11ABV so be carefull and don't hurt yourself."
"A dark brownbeer with mahogony highlights, Has a small light brown/tan head and some lace. There is a dried fruit character in the aroma with some grainy malt in the background along with an alcohol presence. A raiseny/ fig dried fruit coating slides all over your tongue. With hints of cherries and caramel in the background. All followed by a nice warm alcohol note."
"Overall, a very nice quad. Nice sipping beer for a relaxing evening. Of course, can't drink too many of these [my limit is one]."
"Drinkability: The sweetness is more subdued than on tap, if my memory serves, making this a more balanced and mellowed beer. A great dessert beer, above average vs. the style."
"Full body with a velvety smoooth mouthfeel, and I do mean smoooth. Too easy to drink, tastes like candy...Cheers!!!"
"I would love to drink more of this beer if it was in my area, I would go looking for it."
"Damn! Who dumped the sugar bowl in my beer? Pours out to a cloudy and hazy brown appearance with a big light tan foamy head. Unorganized lace inside the glass. Aromas of sugary yeast and malt, with a candied toffee element. Taste is medium bodied; decent complexity, but way sweet. Candied sugar, mild sweet malt and grain, some bread yeast, a touch of clove and spices. Not bad, but way too sugary for me. Mouthfeel was sticky sweet, almost like a lollipop. Drinkability would be better if again, it wasn't so sweet. Take away some of the sugary-ness, and this is a far improved beer. Worth a try."
"Drinkable in terms a sipping ale...wouldn't want to ""down a few""...but really nice to split a 750 with someone."
"750 ml bottle served at room temperature. It pours a deep amber to ambered brown color with a finger of off white head that falls to a solid coat over top. Solid lacing remains as things recede. Nose is full of big dark fruit, fig soaked it rum. Light puffs of alcohol. There is also a healthy dose of bready and spicey notes as well. Flavor is very mellow. Good sweet fruity fig with a healthy but not offensive alcohol in the background with light doughy breadyness and a healthy spicey yeast character in there as well. I like it. Feel is big and thick, almost chewy, with a light carbonation. I enjoy this beer. Even with the alcohol presence, it is pretty drinkable. I can feel it going to my head a bit as I drink it more, so I know one of these a night would do me just fine."
"A sweet, sweet treat. Very sensitive and smooth. A carefully crafted sipper that'll keep you planted in one place for a while as it takes hold of your senses. A very nice brew and highly recommended."
"This is my second review, take it easy on me. What is that flavor!?"
"This brew was shared by a fellow homebrewer. Pours a red/brown color with a large head that has ok retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is excellent. Filled with all the goodies: Dark fruits, raisins, alcohol, toasty, spice, sweetness, yeasty, malty - all just jumping out. The flavor is equally complex and great. As it warms, tons of dark fruits and raisins come across with some spices, citrus, alcohol and plenty of caramel malt. The mouthfeel is on the high end of moderate and the drinkability is great. This is one of the better Belgian beers I've had (except Westy and Rochefort) and probably the best brew I've had in a long while."
"The mouth is full, no chewiness or over the top carbonation despite the loud pop when disgorged. At the same time it doesn't lean towards flat given its winey nature. Normally I take a point or so away from a beer that has such a high abv as drinking a lot can lead to a short, but messy night. For this beer, I'm willing to slow down and enjoy as much as I can. Absolutely worth $7.99 a bottle."
"The high ABV at 11% is not really a factor in the taste."
"D- This is a good complex malty beer that has great complexity. I happen to meet the brewer after I wrote my review and he said the kegs are all pasteurized but the bottles are still alive and kicking so I will have to try those next."
"Dark brown in colour. Complex caramel malt aromas along with notes of raisin, vanilla, and other dried fruits. Its fairly thick bodied, and has some interesting flavors going on, such as malt, prunes, brown sugar, more vanilla, and a mild chocolate note. I actually drank this stuff at the proper temperature this time. Complex and strong stuff."
"Honey colored. Cloudy brown with ruby tones in the light. No head to speak of. Smells wonderful and full, wow! of roasty pruny flavors, raisins, port wine, honey, sweetness. Mouthfeel is slick and slightly syrupy. Asks to be drunk a little slower than you wanted to drink it. :) Similar prunes and raisins and port wine sweetness in my mouth. Wow. This is a wonderful beer. The sweetness is best appreciated as or with dessert. Also paired beautifully with a Dutch Gouda-like cheese with caraway seeds in it. The slight spice in the cheese with the sweetness of the beer was great."
"Smooth, very nice feel in the mouth, definite warmth in the finish but drinkable. This would be a good desert beer either by itself or accompanying a dark, fruity torte. Great beer."
"Perfect for a night-cap."
"taste was aroma like, hits with grape and fruit with hints of brown sugar and chocolate. Sweet but not overly sweet. Its full bodied and packs a punch. Its smooth, sticky and the alcohol makes its presence known as it warms the body, mind and soul."
"Only beer I've had that got progressively worse and undrinkable as time went on. Pours a dark mahogany brown, lots of off white head and lacing. Smells is sweet malt, alcohol, and dark fruits. Taste is horribly sweet, dark cherries, and overpowering alcohol. The mouthfeel was the only pleasant thing about this beer, the carbonation was good. This beer is only good for cooking, it tasted like brown sugar mixed with rubbing alcohol, and this was a bottle that had been aged for 7 months at my house. Insanely one dimensional, it burns from the alcohol. Not recommended at all, horrible. It took all my willpower to force it down and not throw this out."
"Great stuff."
"pours a confident, dense brown with a thin coating of bubbles on top. lacing is pronounced and slides down the side of the glass like a slug. smells very buttery.. yeast toffee and malt notes. fruity with a definite trappist edge in the nose. wow! explodes with banana and berry flavors. taste is a sweet kick with smoothness going down. alcohol is evident but muted by the intense flavor experience here. leaps and bounds above the lighter kasteel. this is a nice, affordable halfway point between rocs grand cru and a trappist quad or dubbel."
"33 cl bottle, at Les Moules Belgian restaurant in Prague. Served too cold. Beautiful deep brown to ruby colour. Large head which disappears rapidly. Aroma of dark malts, oak, old sherry, spices and leather. Flavour is very malty and sweet with a warming mouthfeel, elements of Christmas spices and old sherry. Very good. Yummy!"
"Clear but very dark cola like brown hue under a thin 1/2 finger head that fades to collar almost immediately, but then leaves some pretty impressive lace strings along the side. Sweet caramel malt nose, like candy. Mildly carbonated and pretty sticky, basically the consistency of a semi-flat coke (but in a good way...). The opening taste is way too sweet (what? no sugar in here? Ha!), almost like maple syrup. Some hops try to fight their way through the sweetness, and manage to get noticed before falling back into the sugary swamp. The overall impression is way too sweet for me. I can't recommend it."
"Poured dark brown, with ruby highlights, medium tan head, gorgeous lacing. Aroma of raisins, chocolate, rum, sweetness and more alcohol. Taste was rich, wine-like, and extremely sweet. Dark flavours of chocolate, ripe fruit, yeast, spices, wine. Extremely complex flavours. Smooth, full bodied. It was just a bit too sweet for my tastes. Made it hard to finish. It's definitely a sipper."
"This appears to be an effective budget alternative to world-class quads such as St. B's 12, Westy 12, and Achelse Kluis. $6.75 for a fifth gallon."
"75 cl cork and caged bottle, bottled in Jan 2004, dated best before 5-2009 on backside label. Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown color with a sustaining tan head that laces nicely. A lot of vinous, yeasty notes with a ridiculous amount of dark roasted candi sugar and malts. Some earthy undertones as well. Upon first sip I think to myself how a couple of years ago this was like mother's milk to me, and I reflect upon the fact that palates and people's taste preferences change over time and how much this beer could rot your teeth if you pass out before brushing them. Holy shit is it sweet, with just enough vinous fruitiness and moderate hoppiness to cut it before it becomes too cloying. I still love this beer, though. I'm just a bit more critical about beers than a couple of years ago. I'm just trying to reminisce why I loved this beer so much a couple years ago. I think it's the creamy mouthfeel paired with a deep, malty alcoholic punch that is very clean finishing, yet coating the mouth with stickiness. Dangerously drinkable, especially for it's lofty 11% ABV; but, overall, a little too sweet to give it a 4 in the drinkability rating."
"I enjoyed this beauty from my cellar with a hunk of Callebaut 65% Dark Chocolate, and I could not wish for a better pairing. Instead of an overload of sweetness, the two brought out earthy and savory flavors left and right of center. The Belgians just might know what they are doing, maybe, possibly, you think?"
"330 mL short brown bottle with best before date stamped on the rear label."
"Poured a clear brown color ale with a below average head that had some pretty good retention. Aroma is exclusively comprised of roasted malt with some faint alcohol in the back.. Taste is quite simple, which was a bit surprising for this type of beer and consisted of mildly roasted malt with some warm alcohol at the end. Overall, this is not a bad beer but it is lacking complexity."
"Sampled a 750ml bottle with a ""Gebotteld"" date of 11-2003. Poured a beautiful dark copper color into my goblet. Left a medium head that quickly dissipated into a heavy lacing. Smelt of caramel, chocolate, and fruits. These aromas became more pronounced as the beer warmed. A pronounced, yet balanced, sweetness that was consistent to the last milliliter. Had an exquisite creaminess which is surprising when one considers the 11% abv. Most certainly drinkable, but probably better enjoyed in sips versus quaffs. I'm pacing myself so my six bottles will last until my trip to Mardi Gras next month when I pick up at least another six bottles. Don't pass this beer by if given an opportunity to sample it. Now if they can only find a Texas distributor."
"Nicely complex, an enjoyable beer, best suited for sitting back in the comfy chair when you've got no plans to be going anywhere."
"This was from a 750ml bottle, dated 09-2003. Appears a slightly translucent brown with reddish highlights and a slight tan head that bubbles down fairly quickly. Some lace it left around the glass as it was consumed. Aroma was fruity sweet with dark ripe fruits and a light sugary caramel. There was a bit of spice to it as well as notes of yeast and alcohol. Fruity sweetness starts of the flavor before giving way to doughy malt with spice that keeps the sweetness in check. Alcohol was barely noticeable and the after taste left a sweet spiciness on your tongue. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a nice creaminess and it was a bit warming as well. Drinkability is great, you just have to slow down a bit to enjoy all the complexities of this fine beer. Great all around beer, that I will definitely pick up again."
"Kasteel Donker shows where the line between beer and wine can get a little blurry. Pours a murky brown color with red highlights, practically no head but there was a good amount of lacing. Smell is really sweet and vinous. Taste is the same way. Lots of dark vinous fruits in a variety of flavors burst out from the start. Really sweet but there wasn't much of a malty sweetness. Alcohol comes in and has quite a kick with lots of flavor. There's a strong Belgian yeast element in here that melds well with the alcohol. Finish is dry and a bit weak for my liking. Becomes too syruppy sweet after a while. Needs more effervescence to offset the fruits. Decent but not the greatest Belgian I have had."
"Bottled. Typical Belgian stubbie. Pours a flat cola -red with little or no head. Aroma is alcohol mixed with spice. mouth feel is oils and sweet...pronounced molasses-cola tastes some malt body and the ever pervasive alcohol....very much like a Carib sweet stout...bad job of hiding it and too sweet with adjuncts to be considered a serious for a European ale...these Belgium mutants should have their own category...maybe ""rot yer teeth hi grav rummy beer"" ...woof , I wont be going back here."
"Pours super dark burgundy, almost black. The off white head starts off compact and foamy then recedes to a ring. Lacing is patchy and sporadic. The aroma is of plums, sweet cherries, jammy yeast and a waft of airy alcohol. The taste is very malty with lots of ripe dark fruit, port, and christmas bread flavors. The alcohol is zesty and very warming, though its in check considering the high ABV. In fact its the warming effect of the alcohol that makes this such a great winter brew. Hop aroma is virtually non existent. The mouthfeel is smooth and kind of viscous. This is a great Barleywine, very big and full of maltiness. A perfect winter nightcap."
"A dark brown pour with a medium tan head. Semi sweet nose. Molasses, grapes & black currant. Light roasted notes as well. Taste wise this brew was ru\ich and sweet...deacdent w/ a port-like grape sweetness. Underlying burnt sugars. Alcohol warmth. Nice lingering flavors. Great combo of fruit and alcohol. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy, sticky and sweet, thick n syrupy. This was quite the decadent, dessert beer. A great cold weather sipper, however, a little too sweet to have several."
"My first quadrupel. Never even heard of the style until now. Pours a dark, almost black colour with a hint of dark red when shone through a light. Sadly, next to no head. And lacing was nonexistant. Smells strongly of malt and chocolate. Despite the 11% ABV, not a strong alcohol smell. Taste starts out very sweet and malty. Has some ripe fruits as well, particularly plums and red grapes. Finishes with a chocolate and port taste. Afterfeel is bittersweet, kind of like a dark coffee with sugar and no cream. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Very nice for this beer. I think two would last the night, but a highly drinkable beer nonetheless."
"Pours a dark brown with an off-white head that disappears to a thin ring rather quickly. Has a very sour citrus smell akin to a lambic but not quite so strong, definitely alcohol as well. Taste was definitely different from the smell. some dark fruits, licorice, quite sweet but tasteful, very complex. Having only tried one other Quadrupel, Rochefort 10, this is quite different but shares the complexities that make up this style. Very smooth and drinkable, but the sweetness gets a little strong after a while... I think I had better pick up a few more of these before they are gone."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy cream colored head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a dry, yet fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The scent is sweet and creamy; very nice. The taste is great. It has a very smooth and rich malty flavor with a sweet and warm finish. It is full of flavor and malt complexity. The mouthfeel is excellent as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It is full of flavor and aroma; a great drinker."
"Nice mohagany color with a creamy tan head. It has a good level of carbonation, but note quite as much as other Belgians. The aroma is semi-sweet, malty, and caramel-like. It has a fresh, herbal aroma as well. There is some fruitiness in the aroma too. The flavor is sweet...way more sweetness than I was expecting. The flavor is way malty, with caramel and dark fruits toward the finish. Oh, and coming in at 11%, there is the alcohol in the finish. It is full-bodied, with a creamy texture. The alcohol is definitly there, but not as boozing as one might expect from a high-octane brew such as this. It is a very nice brew. The maltiness is a big surprise for me; different than most belgians I've had. I will drink this one again."
"A high quality brew that pleasantly surprisingly made the LCBO Fall list. Its only drawback is the knockout alcohol punch. Georgeous brown, barleywine and quality yeast aroma. Great taste in my favorite style. Hops, fruit and sugary malt. Good night!"
" The murky apperance in the chalice with it's light tan head is a sight to behold. The sweet fruity aroma and that first alcohol blast just have to be experienced. The yeasty, malty taste reminds me of the sweet dough bread my grandmother used to make. The 11% stands out like a sore thumb but, coupled with the nose and taste, that makes this an amazing beer. When Franklin said, ""Beer is proof that God love us and wants us to be happy", he must have been sitting next to a warm fire with a bottle of this liquid ecstacy."
"Along with Rochefort 10, St.Bernadus 12 & Westie 12, this is a brew that I always try and seek out for the last brew of the night after a hard days drinking when in Belgium! It makes a fantastic Nightcap, and has given me a second wind to continue drinking on more than one occasion. Treat this one with some serious respect!!"
"This is a very nice beer, but it kicked. I was not expecting it to be as sweet and strong as it was, and this is something I couldn't have very often."
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a small light tan bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and coffee with a hint of the alcohol present. A flavor of malt, caramel, raisins and dark fruit with a hint of chocolate. The body is fairly light with a sweet finish. Not a bad beer that hides it's alcohol level well."
"Big beer. Dark brown with medium white head. All malt aroma of toffee and fruits. The taste is extra sweet. Plums, caramel, malt, grapes. Very vinous, rich and warming, alcohol is very noticeable in the finish. Almost syrupy mouthfeel. It would be interesting to age, but overall I must say I expected much more."
"Deep crimson red highlights make it through this clear, dark brown bier. The vigorous pour produced just a medium rich tan head but a thin film lasted the whole glass and left a mess. Port-like, sweet dark fruits in the aroma, with some mild spices, sweet bubblegum, and alcohol vapors. Flavor is very rich, sweet, fruity. Again, very vinous and port-like. Dark candi sugar, dark caramel malts, dark raisins and plums, everything's sweet, dark and beautiful. Low carbonation, thick, creamy sweet mouthfeel. Very warm and flavorful. Did I mention sweet? I don't know if a fresh version would receive such high numbers, but the aged version sitting in front of me is fabulous."
"The beer as it shoves off from the bottle pours a pellucid deep garnet color, the head mastodonic in size, the texture creamy, and the color a winsome tan, as it slowly erodes, the laces forms a tight seal upon the glass. Nose has a significant yeast aroma, sweet caramel, hints of fusel alcohol, a real sniffer this one, start is quite sweet, nice malt presence, and the top is moderate in its feel upon the palate. Finish has a potent acidity, the hops stinging in their spiciness, the aftertaste quite dry and sweet, with a definite tummy warming sensation from the 11 percent ABV, a quaffable brew tis true."
"Very good brew, nonetheless."
"Seek this out."
"I am amazed that this beer is rated so highly. Unless you like your beers amazingly sweet, and I am talking SWEET, then this is not the beer for you. I love Belgians and seek out the micro beers from Belgium whenever I can and I have nothing slightly sweet beers. This beer, though, is something else. I could not get beyond the overpowering sweetness of this beer and if there is any redeeming quality to this thing, it is lost in the syrup like taste. The taste was so bad that I had to cut it with another beer. Interestingly, I mentioned this to another Belgian beer friend of mine and he said he had to do the same thing. Overpriced and overrated is my opinion. The Triple was also unimpressive. There are many far better Belgians out there for less money."
"Color varies from a black in the center to a deep orangish brown on the edges of the glass, body is completely opaque. Head is not overwhelming large and has an offwhite, slightly beige brown color to it. Aroma is extremely bready, covers up the alcohol smell, and has numerous candy-like sugar notes. A fig scent is somewhere in there--all in all its fairly complex. Taste is extremely sweet and centered on figgy, buttery, and slightly sour notes. Some prune-like qualities are in there. I know I havent used the most appetising words and comparisons to describe taste but dont worry, its actually pretty damn good. The beer finishes with a semi sweet aftertaste. Drinkability is there though I caution against taking up on it. This is no baby beer, packing 11% it will make the biggest man sway if he gets careless. Other than that the taste is extremely entertaining and unique which makes for quite a drinkable brew."
"Pours a darker shade of borwn with a real nice sticky head thats seems to dissapte quickly,great aroma of raisins and light chocolate with some definent alcohol notes.The raisin seems to be the dominant flavor I get with some syrupy flavors as well.A touch of nuttiness and alcohol makes this a nice warmer,I have alot of bottle to drink yet wish me luck."
"This is a great expression of the style. The pour from the 750ml bottom produced a great foamy head that was quite peresistent and left a classic Belgian lace. Very dark with ruby hints, the aroma was there but not as strong as I might have imagined, mostly sweet and raisiny. Mostly a sweetish malt flavor with some raisin taste with a drying burlap finish. Shae a bottle for desert and you will make a friend, drink it alone and you will be asleep early."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: This was probably my favorite beer of the tasting and a pleasant surprise. This is the beer Chimay Bleu wants to be. Pours a brownish-amber color with a medium thick beige head. Lots going on in the aroma - fruit, malt, port wine and caramel. Nicely rich body with a complex blend of malt, grain, chocolate, raisins and spicy alcohol. The finish is sweet toffee and malt. Outstanding."
"Carefully poured from the lees, its clear mahogany body rests gently beneath a short, creamy head of light tan foam as very tiny bubbles steadily rise up to support it. The head drops shortly to a wide collar and lacy surface covering, but also leaves some wide rings of sticky lace about the glass. The nose welcomes you with a delicious combination of chocolate covered raisins and caramel splashed with sweet red wine and backed by some earthy and leafy hops. As it warms some candyish - and also peppery - yeast character comes into play adding greatly to its complexity. The body is medium/light, and combines with its very fine, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning to leave it just lightly zesty on the tongue before fading smoothly away. The vinous character of the nose is immediately recognized in the flavor along with assorted dark fruits (plum/prune, dates), a soft note of chocolate, and a sweet light caramel that morphs into a harsher note of molasses that's less refined and a bit edgy at the finish (due in part to alcohol, and in part bitterness). It lingers with some alcohol that fades to reveal the true hop bitterness; then some candy sweetness (bubblegum); and finally a last note of caramel that's charged with delicate clove-like spiciness. Quite complex, rich and flavorful! And although the alcohol could be slightly more restrained, its sweetness is impeccably balanced and never interferes or build on the palate. An impressive brew that's well worth seeking out!"
"This beer was served to me in an interesting goblet with the beer logo on the side. A dark, dark brown beer with an initial (though not long lasting) tan creamy head. The beer is quite sweet with lots of caramel notes. A bit of toffee as well, and a finish that is lightly bitter. The bitter seems to be as much from the high alcohol as from the hops. It has quite a thick body that gently caresses and coats the mouth in it soothing embrace. This is quite a good beer, A dark contemplative brew that is great as a rainy Belgian afternoon snack."
"I enjoyed the tripel so much I had to try the dark offering from this fine brewery. The deepest crimson-brown with little trace of light through the glass. Smells are abundant, mostly sweet malts, rum raisin, maple syrup, figs, slight phenol from the alcohol. Tastes are sweet with a variety of flavors on the palette that reflect the nose--Raisins, figs, maple syrup (nice thick mouthfeel), maybe some currant to round out the sweetness. This beer is all sweet and it hides the 11% alcohol well in the taste, although you quickly feel the effects. Overall, not the best dark belgian I've had, but certainly worth a try, and I could drink a 750ml by myself anytime."
"Dark, very rich, sweet and malty."
"I had only a tiny scrap of a napkin on which to write notes about this beer, and it's most unfortunate. It's fruity complexities are impressive and very fun. I'm sure there are far more adjectives that one could use to describe this beer. It's aroma and taste are compelling to say the least."
"Very dark brown. Actually black from many angles. The biege head is fizzy and weak. The aroma is faint - sweet, slightly citric. Flavor is surprisingly light considering color. Sweet but not cloying. A bit of wood. Don't let it get too warm however as the sweetness grows and becomes sticky. Works well with sweet foods, however. Far from dry in any sense of the term. Far from bad but is a bit wimpy, which lets the sweetness run wild."
"Please."
"It comes in a 750 ml green bottle with a nice looking label. It's caged and corked. The cork says 10-2002, and the back of the bottle says 09-07, apparently the ""serve by"" date. It pours a beautiful dark brownish-red, sort of a deep cherry. The head comes out strong and fades a bit but leaves a decent trace of lace on the glass. The smell is a very complex combination of ripe fruit and that musty Belgian smell that's so welcoming. The taste is plum and raisin and most certainly on the sweet side, yet without being cloying. The mouthfeel is on the creamy side and makes the experience even more enjoyable. The beer is certainly strong, but the 11% abv does not overwhelm the beer and it's quite drinkable. This is a very nice beer."
"I had the Kasteel triple recently, and loved it. One of the best beers I've ever had. This one, unfortunately, is just too sweet for me. Of all of the Belgian beers I've had, this is the sweetest. Pours a beautiful, dark brown with a prominent foamy head. Nice, foamy lace, some head remains throughout. Hard to describe the taste, being that the sweetness is so prevalent. I feel great while drinking this beer. It leaves me (predictably) with a wonderful, warm feeling. But, with all of the great alternatives, I am not likely to buy this one again. (On the positive side, my wife (who doesn't drink beer), tried it and kind of liked it. Now I can get her to sample some other beers!)"
"Above review from a tap sampling at Bryant Lake Bowl. Just had a 750ml bottled I'd been saving, this one labeled as ""Donker-Foncee", and I echo my previous statements: this is one incredible brew. Just wish I could find more bottles around here!"
"Crystal clear deep garnet hue, w/ a head that quickly dissipates into a tight tan ring due to the high apparent alcohol content.  Spotty isolated bubble inlands are left.  The aroma is dominated by vinous, alcohol soaked dark fruit w/ a contrasting dark caramel and chocolate malt.  Hint of dry, coffeeish roasted barley is present as well.  Earthy Styrian Goldings hop nose. When combined with the light clove phenol, bubblegum esters and pleasantly peppery alcohol the nose knows this is a potent Belgian.  Unfortunately, there's a slight hint of lightstruck derived mercaptans (curse of the green bottle) that prevents the aroma from acheiving greatness.  Assertive, molasses like, dark candi sugar sweetness is perceived initially in flavor, then is ceded by a melange of dark, dried fruit including raisin and sugary dates.  The dark fruitiness then melds with dark caramel malt, light chocolate and pseudosweet alcohol to lend an overall impression of bourbon soaked chocolate cake.  Yeast derived flavors emerge late and mirror their presence in aroma, consisting of clove and mild bubblegum.  Ethanol flavors are well controlled, w/ only slight peppery notes percpetible.  Hop bitterness is paltry and leaves malt sweetness virtually unhindered, yet sweetness doesn't become cloying, due to this brew's inherent complexity.  Moderately bodied, w/ a sugary and dextrinous mouthfeel.  Finishes both sweet and lightly roasty, with enveloping alcohol warmth surfacing concomitantly.  Kasteel Donker is a tremendously flavorful brew.  Although sweet all around in character, the sweetness is multi faceted and contrasted by both yeast esters and mellow dark grain.  Considering its strength, the drinkability is supreme.  Donker is an oxy moron of a brew-- ballsy and refined.  Bottled 8/2001."
"You don't see me give all 5 but for this beer I just can't help it. I can not argue with one word Todd wrote. This is easily in the top three of my favorite beers of all time. This is the port wine of beer. Rich complex, malty without being sweet. I have one left in my cellar and the distributor has been out for the last 6 months. Dear god I hope they get more in time! I would put this head to head against any trappist for malt complexity, enjoyability, and price."
"A ""donker"" beer, brewed in 1999 (mine was). A dark brown brew. Very rich and malty with a port-like finish. Sweet bliss in a bottle with a shelf life of over 25 years. One of my favourite of the sweet dark beers that I tried when in Belgium (March 2000)."
