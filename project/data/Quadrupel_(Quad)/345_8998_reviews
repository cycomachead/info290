"Overall an excellent offering from Victory! I didn't share..."
""
"Very good flavor.  Light and fruity like others have said.  I didnt taste any banana.  Very drinkable with no alcohol taste,  but with 12% abv it sneaks up on you pretty quick. At $7.99 a bottle its a great deal."
"If you are looking for a quadruple... the best around for the price. Not a huge fan of quadruple ales... feels like more of a wine vs. beer... but have had a couple of these... and as always... share with a friend. Drink a whole bomber on your own... and pay the price...!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a one liter Belgian-style brown glass bomber, sealed with a cork and cage, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. Pours a medium to dark bronze amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of apple and pear, overripe tropical fruit, apricot, bready and candi malt, white wine. Flavor is similar mixed fruit, dominated by light and dark stone fruit, fig, banana, clove, bready and caramel malt, finishes with bready, almost rye grain with residual semi-sweet mixed fruit and light caramel; light hop bitterness. Medium to heavy bodied with pleasant creaminess. This is a nice domestic take on a quad, rich and complex. The hops were a bit of a surprise, but this is a half-year old bottle and they may have faded a bit, which is fine, because their presence, like some of the other flavors, is deftly integrated into the whole. Very nice. Victory seems to be poorly distributed to Washington now, and I was lucky to pick up this bottle from a store I know handles beer well. Glad I got the last bottle. If I see it again, I will cellar some, this has potential for a few years of interesting change."

"Overall: solid, decent beer."
"So good to slow roll. It's a new beer in every 5 degree increment. The lack of the unpleasant yeast might even win over English BW lovers."

"Overall - Victory rarely makes a bad beer. This one is top notch."
"Mouthfeel is medium. A little slick. Overall, pretty good."
"Had my first one of these yesterday. It was exceptional.  Especially for the cost.  I am a huge fan of quads.  This might not be as complex as some of the big Belgians, but still quite enjoyable.  I poured it into my St. Bernardus goblet.   Nice opaque dark straw color. Felt great on the tongue. Light on the carbonation. Not as much alcohol burn as one would expect from a 12% ABV. Overall, very impressive. I already picked up two more bombers"
"Delicious Quad.  The most outstanding, for me, was the mouthfeel.  Quite enjoyable, thick, delicate but also not too over powering.  The alcohol was present, but not what I expected out of a 12.  For the price ($7.99 here), this Quad is absolutely going to become one of my favorites.  Worth a try, if you're a fan of this style."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 3/13/2014. Pours slightly cloudy orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, apricot, pear, apple, light banana, clove, black pepper, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance, robustness, and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible quadrupel style! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Very nice take on a Belgian!  12%abv doesn't taste like 12%abv which is nice.  Could get you in trouble if you aren't careful!  The aroma sets up heavy but the taste is smooth and the feel is nice upon the tongue.  Victory is a very good brewery that continues to send quality beers.  This is one of their best."

"This is a fantastic quad.  I'd rate it higher but it is a bit hoppier than I'd expect from the style.  I'd rate it lower except the hops really compliment the flavor.  This is a phenomenal take on the style.  It has a great caramel earthiness up front, a slight hop twang on the finish, and just enough alcohol warmth going down to remind you to be careful.  And just enough awesomeness to make you want to throw caution to the wind.  Which advice will win out?  Only the rest of the evening will tell."

"In terms of appearance, this beer lacks any head that lasts longer than 30 seconds and produces absolutely no lacing.  The golden amber color, however, is simply beautiful.  I cannot detect any aroma whatsoever, but at least it doesn’t smell bad.   In terms of flavor only the sweetness of candi sugar is noticeable – no caramel, no figs, no dates, no raisins, no alcohol – just sweet.  No hops, no malt, no diacetyl.  The palate is decent.  I last had this beer in 2008 and can’t see where it’s changed.  Whatever I paid for this bomber was too much for a beer that’s “meh” at best."

"Overall, this is a solid American interpretation of the classic Belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a definite go-to with rich food."
""
""

"The best American made quad I've had. Another great one from Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-actually, this is an okay quad. I'm fairly impressed by it. It's definitely different from any other quad I've had, but it works in its own subtle way."
""
""
"An interesting beer, but I think it's a stretch to call this a quad. It almost tastes more like a farmhouse beer. I would actually consider this more of a strong saison than a quad, ad the look and profile of a true quad are missing here. Still, it's a decent beer, one I felt was worth trying once."
""
""
""
""
"Had this beer many times and am a big fan, bought quite a few to stick in the basement and wanted to do a full review to see if it can hold its rating. Great looking beer with an outstanding smell. Very tasty, and remarkably easy to drink for something that weighs in at 12%, big bonus points there. Victory hit a home run on this one. Outstanding beer that presents a very good value. I am sure I will buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Not your average quad, better than you'd expect"
"O- Guess it would have been better if I went in knowing it was a hopped up version of a Quad, I like IPAs and Black IPAs on occasion, but they are not my regular choice, because im not a hugh HOP fan. Especially mixed with my other styles. I did mark it lower just because it is not really a Quad, but I guess more like a American Quad due to the friggin dosage of hops."

"I really enjoyed this little gem I picked up in a 750 corked bottle from the local craft beer store. It has great drink-ability and a high ABV%. It has strong Belgian yeast characteristics with tastes of clove and coriander. I enjoyed it in a stemmed glass and observed a nice thick head that accented the taste perfectly. I will be comparing all Belgian strong ales I drink in the future with similar characteristics to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A borderline great Quad, definitely a good value. A little more complexity would go a long way."
""
""
""
""
"Victory - please approach this style with a modicum of respect. Please?"
""
"This is an exceptional beer worthy of stocking up on! This beer is one to be savored during special events. I imagine myself on Xmas eve sipping on this next to a warm fire as the rest of the world goes to bed and I drift off in my chair. Kinda like the sleepytime tea box:) Exceptional stuff. VERY highly recommended!"
"Overall: A pretty solid American take on a Quad/Belgian Strong Ale. Nice caramel and fruit notes. A little more hoppy than usual for the style but it adds a nice twist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not quite a quadruple in my opinion. I would like some more dark fruit."
""
""
"A solid Belgium ale on the sweet side."
""
""
""
""
"I made two attempts to try this beer. Each time it was a 750ml bottle with a cork. Both times the cork broke in half. The first time I used a cork screw to try and get the remaining cork out of the bottle, the lip of the bottle burst under the slightest pressure. The second time I managed to get the cork out. The beer tasted like a stew of dirty mop water mixed with old garbage, it was honestly awful."
""
""
"V-Twelve's look marries auburn and toasted orange hues, with a thin ring of off-white head. Not a bad look at all. The aroma is very fruity, with pineapple and apricot being dominant. I also quite strongly pick up what I perceive to be citrusy hops here. The taste is actually more balanced than the aroma suggests, with Belgian yeast and lots of candied fruit esters mingling with one another. The finish leaves a 'syrupy' taste in my mouth, which is borderline too much. Overall, I think this Belgian Inspired Ale is good, but can benefit a lot by resting it for a year or more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting take on the style, and not quite what I expected. I would definitely like more malt complexity, and more of those Belgian yeast aromatics. This reminds me almost of a double bock."
""
""
"O- Quite good but there are definitely better versions of the style. Pairs decently with Havarti."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty enjoyable beer, but like most American versions it pales in comparison to the original Belgian products. Worth a try, but for nearly the same price you can get Abt 12, which is on a whole different level than is one."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a surprisingly light and foamy white head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a dark honey color with shades of brown and dark orange. The beer smell has strong notes of honey with dark fruits and very sweet malts. The malts give off a very sweet and caramel smell. The smell also has slight notes of alcohol. The beer taste has similar fruity, sweet, and caramel notes with a slight hint of honey. The taste and smell are very reminiscent of a barley wine, more so than a quad.. The feel is fairly silky and smooth with very little carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer."

"I really enjoyed this brew allot - not like anything I have had before - start off sweet then the hops hit with a dry finish. A very well done beer! Cheers - drink slowly.."

"a nice quad, but nothing extraordinarily complex or intriguing I didn't think. it pours a sexy amber redish orange color, maybe a little darker than that sounds, with a prominent white head that slowly settles. the nose is big on this beer, dried cherries and alcohol right away, some warmer molasses notes also trickle in above a sizable grain bill. the flavor is heavy on the dark fruits, raisins and plums join the party, but the alcohol wipes out some of the subtleties. lots of burn in the finish, which is also very sweet, caramel based, and maybe a little overdone. Belgian yeast provides lovely carbonation, but there just isn't quite enough body for me here. also the teeth rotting sugar finish is even more than the style calls for. this is an absolute must share bottle of beer, even with one friend we struggled with the last of it. a quality quad, especially if you like yours sweeter and stronger than the standard issue."
""

"Fruity sweetness and toasted grain off the bat. Tropical fruit, candied pears, and banana rum fill in. Sweet, but not cloying. Herbal, spicy, peppery bitterness weaves in and out, providing some balance. Might be due to the alcohol. Notes of caramel, sweet bread, and honey come out mid-palate. Rummy fruits into a warming finish. Post-banana bitterness spreads, peppered by the peppery, spicy alcohol. Yeasty too. Full-bodied, with a subdued, smooth, bottle-conditioned feel. A very nice sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was a solid choice. It's nothing spectacular, but it is one of Victory's better brews."
""
""
""
""
"O-This bottle had some aged on it, still good though. But it didn't seem all together. Maybe I'll give it another go fresh. But very meh."

"O: A very nicely done American quad with good complexity and depth. Not as many layers as some of the European counterparts, but still up there in terms of quality. Fairly damn cheap for what it is, too ($6 for a 750 of 12% American quad). Nicely done, Victory"
"O- This is a nice quad. I dont say this often but this beer is just a bit too sweet. I can see this beer doing well aged in a wine barrel. Keep in mind my bottle is almost 2 years old."
"In style 4.25"
""
"Overall this quad is awesome and I got it for 7.50 for the bottle!!! Gotta be dumb not to pick it up for that price."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"GOOD, NOT MUST TRY!"
"Overall – A nice sweet and fruity quad that even at 12 % abv is very drinkable with very little boozy taste influence. A good beer to try if you get the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
"Btw this was my first review so hope you guys think I did an alright job lol."
""
"This is a beer that I rated a 4 in every category except for the overall I felt is was a 4.5. So I guess this is one of those times when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."

"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Bottled on December 29, 2011 indicated on the bottle. Pours a dull, burnt orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity. Head is half an inch, off-white and frothy. Nose expresses overripe figs, caramel notes and a spicy character. Taste follows nose; however, candi sugar is also present, as well as a fermented quality to the dark fruit. Finish expresses a hint of ethanol. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that falls just short of lively and a slightly crisp finish. Overall, I have to say that this beer seems closer to a Tripel in character than a Quad. There's definitely an alcohol presence, but it's extremely well-hidden at 12%. I think this beer might be worth cellaring for another year or two to see how it opens up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't mean any disrespect, but I always felt like there was a reason that I hadn't bought and tried this sooner. I've seen it on the shelves for years now. Never gave Victory a chance in this style. And, as it is, I could pass on it in the future. A decent Belgian ale, lighter in color than most quads, sweet but roasty. I always succumb to the real Belgians here, though."

"Poured at 37F from a 750ml bomber into a Duvel goblet. Color of unclarified dark amber honey, nonpersistent 1 finger head, vigorously poured. Warm sweet smell of (no kidding) nitrous oxide and slight booziness. At least when I was a kid this is what nitrous oxide smelled like when I was getting teeth pulled. Not sure if it actually has a smell or not. What a grand and warm taste this delicacy has. Flavor is warm and inviting with caramel tops and a cherry-ish reminiscence, or maybe sweet southern barbecue that rolls around the edge of the back half of your tongue on finish. The booziness enhances this lovely combination. The just-above-non-existent carbonation makes this fine sipping brew whose complex flavors beg for sipping and resipping. Hard to call $13 for a bomber snooty, but this is dang fine ale. Note to self: buy whenever you can."
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a great quad, super malty and sweet without being cloying. Fruit helps break up the sweetness a bit and the heat/spiciness does a great job too, while adding extra complexity."
"A well done Quad. Very easy drinking, despite the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice quad to drink in the summertime given its citrus and floral notes. I'm usually not the biggest fan of quads, but enjoyed this one a fair amount; recommended if you see it."
"Reddish brown with a finger or two of white head. Moderate retention, light lacing. Nose has some candy sugar, candy floss, mild dark fruit notes, light alcohol and some clementine zest comes through as it warms. Taste is quite sweet, candy sugar, some grapes, ripe plums, almost a bit of wheat flavour. Spice and alcohol in the finish. Medium full body, and a lower medium carbonation. A nice paler quad, good flavour and alcohol, although there, isn't as pronounced as I thought it would be."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side with carbonation being a little above average. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. The tart, crisp fruits did seem a little overdone at times for the style. Pretty enjoyable beer to sip on this evening though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Full-bodied with a light effervescence and smooth as silk. Warming as a 12% should be. A really good beer."

"I voted for the beer in this pairing with the food. The general concensus was that the beer was better than the wine with this dessert. This left the dinner with a 2-2 tie between the beer and wine. Looks like there will have to be another to settle it once and for all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This started to grate on me the further I got into my session and it's a true endurance test for sure. However, that doesn't mean I didn't think it is a great beer. For $8.99, you could do much much worse."
""
"Medium bodied, syrupy, plenty of carbonation, and a lot of alcohol taste. This bottle may have been better if I put it in the cellar for a while. Doesn't really taste or look exactly like a Quadrupel, but not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Surprisingly this is kind of a simple beer. Only after I'd opened it did I read the label and see that they said you should really age it up to five years. This one's only 10 months old. Drat. Wish I had aged it, because this wants more complexity. Doesn't really seem like a quad, but that could be because my quad experience is limited to the abt style. I was expecting dark and malty. It's enjoyable and very drinkable, particularly despite the strength. What it's not is interesting. I would not spend money to drink another unaged one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed it despite not being able to walk for 45 min after."
"overall - I would not consider a Quad. not enough dark malt taste. to thin, not smooth enough. a bit hot, let's see how my other bottles age."
""
""
"O: I'm new to reviewing beers, but I think I can safely say that this is one of those beers that you should try and then get another to cellar. I believe that boozy aroma and hotness will fade a bit and those dark fruits, spices and orange peel flavors will come out. Plenty tasty, drinkable and eager to store one."
""
"Really good beer here. Great for splitting with someone and admiring its qualities. Wish I had the smarts to buy another one or the patience to let it age a bit. I'm willing to bet that this one would be fantastic and a little more subdued in about 3 years. But definitely worth picking up if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This definitely isn't a Belgian Quad, but it is good for 12% abv. More of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Does pretty good as a Belgian style none the less. Alcohol is way hidden with such subdued flavors. Not bad. I dont believe this to be a quad, but it is good."

"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 6. It pours a clear copper topped by a frothy couple o' fingers of dusty cream-whiteness. The nose comprises light melon, tart orange, lemon zest, light white grape, a touch of pine needle, light honey, and there's a vague notion of Brett-like funkiness in there as well. The taste holds notes of rich caramel, pine resin, some sense of menthol, honey, and something akin to thick, spicy wine grapes (imagine a nice PX sherry made with chardonnay grapes or something...). It's like an overt combination of sweet and piny, with neither side knowing when to back off, always escalating and exacerbating every possible circumstance. If the world were run like this, it would consist of literal dust caught in the threads of the cosmic tapestry. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation, a syrupy feel, and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, I thought this was a pretty sad excuse for a quad, one that laughed in the face of a usually tasty style, making everyone involved feel all the worse for the experience."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a flavorful brew with a sweetness that most will enjoy. I like the unique yeast taste this has and I recommend trying it if you haven't already. I am curious to see how a few bottles age because they are great with 8 months on them."

"O-a nice sipping quad with good balance and flavor"
"Well, this was my 1st Quad and I am guessing Quad are not for my palate. I struggled to split my 1/3 of a 22oz-er. Way, Way, too much beer for me, this one bordered on hard alcohol in my estimation. If you like Quads, perhaps Victory has nailed the taste with this Twelve. But overall, it left me wondering how/why does anyone drink this kind of beer?"

"O: Mmm tasty. When all is said and done, I have to knock this beer down because it's still a little too hot, but I would LOVE to get my hands on another bottle to sit on. Kudos to Victory."
"O - One of the boozier beers I have had, but overall still a pleasant beer."
"O: 12 oz is plenty for an enjoyable drinking experience. Easy to take a nice hefty, delicious swig to take in all the flavors and then come back to it a warm 20 minutes later to find the flavors have only enhanced. Well Done:)"
"Overall: I was surprised by this. Quadrupels aren't necessarily my favorite style, but I really enjoyed this beer. Thank you, Victory."
"O: I was slightly disapointed by this, I was expecting a little bit more from this. I'm not easily intimidated by high ABV beers in the least bit, but I think it takes away from what could be a great beer. Its obvious there are a lot of different things going on in it, and that its complex, but it gets dominated by the ABV in the end."
"Comes out of the tap an attractive coppery amber with minimal head - but the latter may be an artifact of the pour. Aroma is yeasty and fruity, not particularly strong but quite inviting. Mouth-filling fruity flavor has malty, apple, banana and grassy notes with a hint of caramel - dee-lishus! Strong-bodied texture is smooth and fizzy and leaves a fruity, slightly sweet finish. Victory indeed!"
"Strong and boozy, but lacking the expected qualities of a outstanding quad. This seemed more like a farmhouse ale than a Belgian quad to me, although it is strong. Disappointing."
"O - The boozyness lets this beer down a touch and this tastes like no Belgian Quad I have ever had, in fact its more than a Tripel than a Quad. However it is a very pleasurable beer in its own right."
"O - Very belgian aromas and flavours. A solid quad with all the features of the style (i.e. heavy malt, boozy, sweet, balanced) without being top shelf."
"This brew pours a hazy copper hue which leaves a two finger head and little lacing,the smell is toffee,caramel,fruit cake and raisins,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of fruit cake,raisins soaked in brandy,bready malts,toffee and finished with a mix of burnt toffee and ripe lemon zest and overall its very sessionable and would buy again cheers."
"Taste: Heavy, rummy, molasses with butterscotch notes. Good hop balance keeping the barley malt in check. I am letting it warm up a bit and I am getting a bit of apricot but the alcohol kick stays strong. Some aging will probably even the alcohol out."
"One of the first non-European quadrupels I'd ever had. A darker amber beer, slightly hazed, with a finger or so of white head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving a bit of lace behind. Aroma strong with sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, yeast, and dried fruits. Similar in the taste, sweet malts, candi sugar and brown sugar, raisins and figs, yeasty, woody, with an obvious alcohol sensation. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and quite drinkable, within reason."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a two finger slight orange head. The aroma is of candy and toffe with a little alcohol present. The taste starts off with a candied yeast strain and then raisins with an alcohol taste at the end. The mouthfeel is velvety and very smooth. Overall a good beer I really liked the taste and mouthfeel on the list to have again for sure."
"Overall this is a very nice sipping Quad to be enjoyed slowly."
"overall: Well balanced, tasty. The 12% is well hidden. Velvety smooth. Nice American take on a quad."
"T: Really sweet and malty upfront. Some belgian yeast, a bit of raisin and some molasses follows. There's also a hint of earthiness and a little hop sourness on the finish. Complexity is good, but it's a bit boozy for me. Taste is more like a boozy tripel than a quad to me."
"Light golden brown color with little to no head or lace. Smells like caramel. Taste is big booze, caramel, slight banana, belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is a little bit thick with a lot of carbonation for the style. Looks, tastes and feels a lot like a real Belgian quad. I'm impressed."
"O: Nice. A good sipping beer. This would go nice with a sweet dessert such as a pineapple upside down cake or a cherry pie."
"Would have never guessed this was a Quad from the look of the beer. The look of the beer is a nice copperish color. The head is a little fizzy and settles into a thin scattered film over top of he beer. The smell is sweet and very pleasant in my opinion. It's got a bit of a dark fruitiness on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet and has an interesting dark fruit and brown sugar taste. The mouthfeel had a good carbonation and remains pretty smooth. Overall I liked this beer quite a bit. Really surprising."
"I like many Belgian brews and this quad is excellent. I am very glad I finally found and tried it. Great balance of ingredients. I will put it as one brew that's on the top of my list!"
"O: instant favorite; flavors hit the nose on opening, and lasts until bottle is emptied; definitely not a sessioner; enjoy it sipping every few minutes, letting it warm to room temp"
"Love it. Absolutely love it. Can't say enough about the blast of deep fruity, and frankly red wine flavors going on here. This beer holds its own against any European quad I have ever drank."
"Overall not crazy enough to be really interesting to me, and not enjoyable enough (to my tastes) to purchase again. Probably well worth cellaring; hop character would subdue and fruit/spice would develop, but I probably won't be going back for more. Fans of American strong ales/barleywines looking to dabble in something more ""Belgian-inspired"": worth a try; otherwise, maybe not."
"Overall: Hard to “rate to style” as this beer is 180 degrees from a St. Bernardus Abt 12 or a Rochefort 10. That being said it is still a good enjoyable beer; it’s just not a Belgian Quad/SDA."
"O- I'm really enjoying this one! The 12% never even shows it's pretty little head like one would think! This isn't your Grand Daddy's Quad! It feels and tastes like something old, but with a new twist. Kinda like the new ""Dodge Challenger""... Looks familar enough, but with a great newness to it! I imagine this with a fig jam coated Venison steak, rosemary potato's, and maple glazed carrots! MMM..."
"From a bomber marked Feb 4 2011 into a goblet. Vigorous pour yields a thin cap which fades quickly. Clear, light orange-mahogany color, strong carbonation stream. Nose is complex: Syrupy sweet with cloves and spice, raisins, pepper, syrupy malt, and hints of alcohol. Smells delicious. Tastes very sweet out front, with a bit of alcohol burn. Definitely malt heavy, which masks alcohol though there’s a definite burn at the finish. Hops are hidden but come out a bit at the end. Mouth is nicely viscous, very smooth, with consistency of thin syrup. Overall: his beer seems to just be “too big” and probably would benefit from aging. Definitely big and flavorful, though could use some moderation."
"O: A complex beer, meant to be savored. Drinkability-wise, it’s a sipper. Alcohol content makes itself known. Very nice how the big, full, fruity flavor gives way to a hoppy astringency on the back end."
"The alcohol hits you initially, but as it warms and your palate grows accustomed to it, all the elements fuse into a well-balanced, malty and fuzzy deliciousness. Definitely one to cellar and expect great things."
"O - A very good beer, but definitely something to drink in moderation and slowly. The bold taste is delightful, but you can definitely taste the alcohol and it can get to be a bit much at times."
"O-What a great complex and robust beer. Cant wait to experience again."
"Notes: Glad to have finally bought and tried this beer from Victory, an early favorite brewery in my explorations, thanks to Victory Golden Monkey. I think that this beer provides a good value too at only $7.99 for the corked and caged bottle."
"O- A very solid, but not World Class Quad. I'd love to age one of these 3 or 4 years, as I imagine it would really mature the beer for the better. Still, this is a very solid effort- maybe in the top 3 or 4 American Quads I've had. Definitely worth picking up and enjoying. Cheers."
"A bit harsh at first, but it comes together as it warms. Smooth and succulent. 12% ABV demands that this will be a sipper."
"O- Easily a storeable beer. I would say a late 4yr would be prime. Just a great addittion to all the great beers these guys come up with."
"D- a sipper most def. however, it drinks and goes down like a harvest fest seasonal."
"Let the bottle set out a little bit from the fridge. Upon opening with a nice little ""pop", noticed an immediate whiff of caramel malt. Poured with a foamy, spritzy, light tan head that mostly settled down pretty quick to a ring around the inside of the glass and a small island. Color is a clear medium amber. Nose is as said plus a little fig, fresh nutmeats, tree bark. Flavor is similar to aroma, but mainly dominated by the caramel malt with a little bitterness in the background. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor plus with alcohol warmth. Actually had expected a bit more out of this. Not a session."
"I really do not have much experience with this style of beer, so style-wise, I am not sure how this compares. However, I must say that this is quite a tasty beer. Lots of flavors and textures with this beer...another great brew from Victory!"
"Jeez, a huge pain to get the cork out of this one, then finally with barely a hiss... for a second was worried it would be flat, but it's ok. Pours a clear burnt orange with a mist of big floaties, half inch of clingy foam. Smell: brown sugar, pear in syrup, red delicious apple skin, peppery, boozy. Taste: sugary black plum flesh, peppery, spicy hopping, slight plum skin tartness, soft pear. Alcohol via the peppery component, but more more in control here than the nose. Despite the seemingly lowish carbonation, it's medium bodied with a soft luxurious feel. Peppery, fruity, boozy. Good, not great. Bottled Feb 24, 2011."
"Drinkability- just to boozy and sweet and to heavy to be enjoyable drinkable, its not offensive really but just kind of hard to get through, just too much, wouldn't seek out again a rare miss to me by victory"
"Over all well worth the 9.99 price tag on it. I might get a few to cellar over many years to see how it changes year to year. Good investment."
"Overall a great purchase. A lot of consumer utility for only $10 a bottle. Thanks to Scooter's pub in Mt. Pleasant, PA for having legit beer in a town full of fizzy, yellow beer drinkers."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a very light level of carbonation. Having an entire growler full of this is overkill, it needs to be shared because the alcohol really packs a wallop. Having drank a glass of this straight out of the fridge made me miss a lot of what this brew had to offer. Letting it warm up and open in my glass revealed quite a bit of depth that was enjoyable. Thanks again for the opportunity Matt."
"Had a tulip glass at Barley's in downtown Greenville, South Carolina."
"Quite Belgian. Good job on that. I'm gonna err on the side of caution/respect-for-real-Belgian-shit with praising what they did here. But what a lovely, quaffable, stunning (as in tranquilizer dart) brew."
"I knew there was a reason I got this again. My palate has definitely changed over these two years and this high octane Belgium really hits the spot. Prost!"
"D- Med. More than one bomber and I'd be a zombie! It's booziness is masked by the spices. It's a great beer!"
"D: The best American quad I have ever had hands down. The carbonation is spot on which is something the American examples really have a hard time nailing down. Hard to blame them though the Belgians do have a few hundred years head start. I really would no change anything about this beer. My gripe with some of the recent Belgians I have tried is all you get is that residual candi sugar chewed through taste. This really is beyond that and is sweet without giving me diabetes. I westy 12 St B V-12 blind might be a good idea. Kudos Victory. Often slept on but not by me."
"I plowed through one of these on an afternoon. Not a bad beer at all. Looks like a 2009. the conditioning was fine. I think the balance was pretty good, too. Don't know what possessed me to buy this. I'm trying to reduce the inventory, looks like a pleasurable task."
"Very good BSA (Quad?), but not my favorite in the style. Something is just a little off on this one which doesn't ruin the beer by any means as this is still quite enjoyable, just distracts a bit. I dunno. Good, but not great."
"Really solid quad, enjoyed all the banana notes, almost like banana fosters as compared to traditional hefe banana notes. All in all, very good and one of the better quads in the US."
"jd"
"It is highly drinkable, great Belgian inspired yeast notes and sweet bread and fruity flavors. I loved it."
"Verdict: Not my fave from Victory, and a little too unique for me."
"D: Fairly good quad, certainly not the best in show. Would love it to be darker with a bigger dark fruit character like it trappist counter parts."
"very interesting beer that is kind of all over the place. not sure if it is from the aging or it tastes like this fresh as well. don't think I'll call this drinkable. gonna have a hard time drinking the whole bomber because of the sweet and heat. hmm... that would be a cool name for a homebrew."
"D: Drinks very well, but watch out for that ABV."
"Overall, this was not what I was expecting when I picked this up. I wanted a sweet , dark, strong belgian quad and instead I got a m,edium colored, spicy ale. That said I am really enjoying this beer and this is coming from someone who has been rather dissapointed with Victoy's offerings. It is certaintly a plus that for a 12% beer, the alcohol is masked extrodinarily well; one glass down, I am suprisingly and happily subduded."
"Big, complex malts with light & darker fruity esters balanced with phenolic Belgian yeast spiciness. Its ~12% ABV give it a pretty warm & full mouthfeel, and it impressively manages to make the ethanol presence work with the sweet malts. Many other beers in this alcohol range can be too hot and boozy. Very very good stuff."
"d- would like it more but the taste is almost overwhelming and the 12% is evident"
"D: Not much drinkability due to booziness. Would love to see what some cellaring would do to this one."
"Bright copper to amber in color; hazy but not terribly so. Thin, fizzy, off-white head that dissipates immediately. Some lacing and some nice alcohol legs on the glass. Aroma is some light malt, some caramel, raisin. Quite subdued though. Slight hints of spicy yeast. The flavor is deliciously spicy and yeasty. Complex malt flavors of dark fruit, some caramel. Mildly sweet, full bodied. Abit flat, it could have used a little more crispness I thought. The 12% ABV is practically undetectable, just adding a nice warmth to the beer."
"D- Drink carefully, this one masks its alcohol very well."
"D - Warms the belly. A nice sipper. Glad I opened it."
"Overall: A real nice beer from Victory that I've been passing up for some time now. Finally paid the $8.99 for the 750. Glad I got to try it finally as it's pretty darn tasty."
"D: A nice, complex, evening Belgian sipper, especially at the lofty 12% ABV. However, alcohol is not the dominating force on the flavor palate here. Rather, it's the spicy and sweet Belgian yeasts and super fruity, complex malty ale profile that make this brew a winner in my book. Pop the cork amongst friends and try to conjure up the characteristics of this enjoyable brew."
"D: very tasty, deceptively strong--drinking one of these is like drinking a bottle of wine, but you'd never know it from the taste."
"D- Drinkable for the percentage of alcohol and a good refresher of quads."
"D: Quite nice. I don't come across this too often, but I'm gonna be sure to pick up a few next time I do. I think this is as good as any non-Westy quad out there."
"Notes: All and all a very good beer. I like the unique hop profile. Didn't know it was a quad until I looked on BA, and I was very surprised to see that."
"D- Will drink this all day long. This American made Quad will stand toe to toe with many made in Belgium. I've had this one before and loved it, I review it now with a slight cold and was still thoroughly impressed."
"Overall an average Belgian style strong ale. I like the appearance and smell but the spicy finish and boozy notes were a little too much."
"Bottled in 2003, drank 12/20/2010. I was expecting a drain pour, to be honest, but was pleasantly surprised. The bottle opens with some ""oomph"" and pours a sprightly pour. Lots of bubbles, though only a thin cap of lacing shows up... not much ""head"" to speak of. Mouthfeel reflects the bubbly body: plenty of carbonation, full bodied. Flavor is touched by the age, some oxidation, but in all this is still a pleasure to drink. Fruity character, apricot, toffee... just lacking a bit of bite to set it higher on the pedestal."
"Overall this is a good beer, kinda light in taste for a Quad in my opinion. I had higher hopes for this one, but I think that alcohol level gets in the way."
"D: The beer definitely tastes like it is strong, but the alcohol is relatively well masked and makes this taste more like it's an 8% abv instead of 12% abv."
"The strength makes it a sipper. A great experience, though. Very delicious and a real treat. Fits the style well, great job by an American brewery capturing that Belgian feel. Totally recommended."
"D - Good stuff, but I think it is better when cold."
"Wow, way better then I remember this being from many years ago when this first dawned my fridge. A victory for Victory for keeping this stuff around. Yum!"
"D- This beer is very drinkable. I wish the alcohol wasn't so prevalent and that the flavors and malts and hops stood out better. Overall, I like the beer, but not sure I'd be going out and buying it again. I'd like to know how it would taste after it has aged for a year or so and those floraly citrus notes can emerge and also see how the beer progesses."
"D - This was a much more enjoyable beer than I remember it being from my last tasting; a pleasant surprise which I suspect may owe much to the fact that this bottle was just a bit over a year old when I popped the cork. The yeast character is still quite spicy with an almost, but crucially not quite, overwhelming note of clove. There are other subtle complexities in the yeast profile, such as pear and lemon, but aside from clove the other dominant flavor characteristic is anise. These are both yeast flavors that I consider desirable in a golden colored belgian ale (which V-12 more or less qualifies as), but they are a bit too strong for my taste in this brew. Still, they are much more subtle than I remember them being from my last sample and they have moved back just enough to allow other flavors to show through. Rich, thick and syrupy malt is abundantly present throughout with a nice honey and biscuit richness that reminds me of Victory's German style lagers. This malt would be cloyingly intense in almost any other beer, but here it is just what is necessary to balance the powerful yeast and huge alcohol content. Overall, this is a surprisingly drinkable and well balanced beer, though the alcohol level seems to be bordering a bit on novelty levels and I'm not convinced that it wouldn't be a better beer at 10%."
"Overall I think I may have left this sit too long. The sweetness was just overwhelming and I was surprised the alcohol was still that evident. A decent quad, but there are way better. Did I let this sit too long? Possibly and that may have been the problem. I'll try again with a fresher bottle some day."
"D: This is the most drinkable 12% beer I've ever had. Very refreshing, but I can't say I find it typical of the quad style. At least to my experience so far."
"Drinkabily - Low for me. Not impressed. Not enough floral flavors, or spices. Too much yeast and the alcohol came through too easy. Victory makes great beer but there triples and quads basically dont cut it, i dont want this ever again"
"D: very inviting, but in limited quatities"
"Overall pretty good. A little boozy but typical for 12%. Great Belgian tastes and aromas, pretty well done."
"Im having a hard time calling this a quad. I mean line this up with Rochefort 10, St Bernardus ABT 12 and Pannepot Old Fishermans Ale and the looks alone will have this one sticking out like a sore thumb. I guess the shoes this beer has to fill are too big."
"Pours almost a cherry wood color with almost no head what fuzz that did appear was white. Smells almost like apricot schnapps. Taste was good but not what I was expecting from a belgian style, very sweet. Has quite a bit of alcohol burn, guess thats to be expected from a quadruple, I'd drink a couple of rounds of this if it weren't so expensive or lethally high in alcohol"
"Thoroughly enjoyed this brew. As another reviewer stated, it does feel like a boosted saison more than a quad. Either way the drinkability is high on this one."
"Overall impression: good alcoholic quadrupel, though lacking smooth texture and sufficient malt."
"What is drinkability? I still don't quite get the criteria. What if I'd rather spend over an hour with a bomber of a 12% beer than an hour with 6 sub-standard, boring ""session"" ales. My own criteria, at least for V-Twelve, is a combination of 1) can you sip and contemplate the beer's complexities as it transforms with warming? (yes) 2) does it taste excellent? (oh yes) and 3) do I want to close the computer, go outdoors and quietly bask in the glory of the beer in these peaceful surroundings? (yes I do...goodbye!)"
"Notes: This is decent Quadruple, not my favorite but it was still interesting."
"D- The booze is definitely there, and the sweet caramel finish gets a little cloying after a while, but knowing that it's a 12%ABV, I shared it. I don't think I would want the whole bottle by myself, but I did wish I had some nice cheese and maybe some proscuitto along with it. I think it would be great with some food, but it's a little hard to handle on it's own. I enjoyed it, but it got to be a little too hefty after a while. Nice job, I think it would shine in the right situation."
"Pours a well carb'd clean brownish hue with a one-finger offwhite head that died slow and gives off a bready, yeasty, smell w/ caramel and orange as well as some citric hops and hints of chocolate. Medium to heavy body with a crispness due to carbonation and has a balanced taste of citric and orange fruit flavors and a dryness from hidden ABV and yeast. Sweetness in there as well as caramel malt and hints of chocolate are evident. Touches of tropical and dark fruit are also evident although just barely. Overall a well-balanced sweet and fruity quad with dry finish that is a great sipper and gets a little dryer but not bad as it warms and the ABV is latent and can sneak up on you but does not overpower brew."
"pours a nice, luxurious amber tone with a half finger of fluffy off-white head that fizzles out quickly... looks inviting though. in the nose i get raisins, yeast, and alcohol. first sip brings dark fruits, yeast, malt, and i'm noting a bitterness described in an previous review that IMO doesn't mesh well with the overall profile. minus points for that. mouthfeel is decent, full bodied and with middling carbonation. overall, not a bad interpretation of the style, but definitely not my favorite."
"Notes: I had higher hopes for this one, but I think that alcohol level gets in the way. Whatever hops were used were wrong for the beer, I think, as they are aging in that ""plastic oxidized hop"" way. Normally I'd say, ""it might improve with time," but given the way the hops are breaking down and the thin body, I don't think it will help this beer. Not great, but appropriately priced."
"drinkability: definetly couldn't have more than one of these. It is drinkable if you're just sipping. 12% alcohol lets you know it's there by the end of the bottle. If the abv weren't so high I could probably drink more."
"Notes: Nothing wrong but it doesn't stand out. To me it tastes like a boozy saison. It isn't nearly dark or malty enough to be a great quad to me, but its not bad."
"D-for 12% abv it definitely catches up with you, yet it's dangerously well-hidden during the drink; it's a really nice interpretation of the style with more of a bright fruitiness rather than the dark fruit flavors of traditional quad/dark ales"
"D- This beer has a higher ABV but is still pretty drinkable. The end of the bottle was a little rough but overall a good keeper. I wish this beer would be a little less sweet but we can't have it all now can we...haha."
"Notes: I keep on being surprised by some of this big bottles form Victory, I like the brewery, but the large offerings are on another level. This reminds me of some sensations as I was approaching Quads a while back and in particular US ones. I like it, but under the unfermented sugar and the Belgium yeast I feel there is a closeted barleywine... A nice one, mind you, and I'm going to try to get hold of this brew again. I think that it is a rather rich and stimulating take on a quad, but the barleywine is there for me too, albeit rather well dressed up."
"Bottled on Sept 18 2009. Sampled on June 3, 2010. It is served at about 47-48 degrees but warmed up even more as I savored the offering. It pours a cloudy amber-copper with a very thick but puffy beige head. The multi=faceted aroma includes malts, wheat, grains, and yeast. There is a strong bitterness in the flavor and some wheat which culminates in a sinus-clearing hoppy finale. Quite a decent brew."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer. Not exactly a St. Bernadus, but for a local brew, very good. I will be drinking this again."
"Pours from the 750 ml bottle a nice copper color, with a good inch or so of creamy white head. Aromas of caramel, Belgian spices, raisins and granny smith apples. Very boozy, with flavors of apple cider, caramel, Belgian yeast and spices. This is a big, alcoholic beer, tough to get through in a single setting."
"Victory Twelve poured a dark amber color, with a medium sized head. It had a great smell, of hops and other flavors. It had a sharp taste, the alchool was a bit strong in it, but there was a combintion of complex flavors and hops. It was by no means a light beer, but not too difficult to drink. The only promblem might have been the strong alchool flavor. Overall fantastic beer, a must try, I would love to get another bottle and let it age."
"Summary - This a very nice beer, be sure to share with friends. It gets a bit heavy for me after a serving and can get overwhelming if one drinks it too quickly. Again, this is definitely a sipping beer. I will be trying some other Victory beers after trying this one."
"I'm a little intrigued by victory brewing but still uncertain. This beer doesn't do anything to improve or disprove my opinion."
"One of the best beers I have had, really something special."
"Drinkability - Considering the 12% ABV, this is a decently drinkable beer."
"D: This is a very well made beer with a great flavor profile. That being said, I have a 750 bottle and no one else will drink any, so one will probably be enough"
"A corked 750ml, bottled on August 27th, 2004. Popped and poured into my trusty tulip glass. V-12 appears a hazed golden auburn color with about a finger of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of sweet candied apples, caramel, pears, grapes, slightly spicy yeast, ripe plums. Some lingering alcohol heat, but it is rather muted overall after almost 6 years in the bottle. The taste takes a back seat to the complex nose, but it is also not to be passed by either. The ale approaches full bodied with delicate, yet somewhat lively carbonation akin to a good bottle conditioned beer. Really nice, this was worth the wait."
"pours a hazy amber-copperish color with a good bit of thick fluffy head and lacing. has a bit of a malty flavor, nothing else really sttod out to me except the amount of alcohol which i thought was very present in the smell but not in the taste at all. i saw some other reviewers don't feel the same way, but i thought the alcohol was very well hidden and the beer was very good and very easy to drink."
"An excellent beer I hold this up some of the very best Quads. Also veyr drinkable for 12% ABV."
"D-a little too much alcohol to make it very drinkable, but still one to try"
"drinkability: This is not a quad and not a very good belgian style beer. The worst of the Victory line-up that I drank at the victory party."
"There are two ways to review this beer... One against what it should be to the style and the other just as a general beer. Both, in my opinion fall short of what it should for the style and as a beer but then again, I'm biased to overly hopped beers especially when the style just isnt meant for this level of IBU. In my opinion, there is too much refined sugar used to get up the IBU which should be reduced slightly and presented more in other adjunct or malt for complexity. It is a very straight forward malt profile built on light malts. I dont mind the 'hotness' that comes through on the tongue which may be offputting to others. This is really a malty imperial tripel if there was such a thing and falls short of many in the style. However; I'd rather have this over any IPA. If you like an over hopped American Belgian that packs a lot of punch this is the beer for you. It doesnt have the complexity or balance to rival the most complex category of beer on the planet."
"D - Another well crafted Belgian knockoff from Victory. 12% is noticeable but doesn't impede enjoyment."
"Served from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a nice amber shade with a 2 finger cream colored head. Smell is very citric and hoppy. Tastes...like it smells, citric and hoppy. The alcohol comes through a decent bit. Feels very good, and somewhat light actually. Because of the high alcohol, one bomber of this should be enough for the night."
"drinkability - Nice sipping beer to lay back and drink on a cold night."
"Bottled on March 2, 2009. Poured into a snifter. Pours a nice orange/amber color. For some reason I expected this to be darker. Moderate head that fizzes out quickly, leaving a ring and some suds. Some nice lacing left behind after each sip. Smells sweet at first...figs, grapes, apricot? A little musty, slightly hoppy. A noticeable amount of alcohol in the nose. The taste is much the same. Fruity and sweet malt. It's a well balanced taste, and it tastes every bit of 12% abv. No bitterness to speak of. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Leaves no stick and is rather dry. It's a sipper for sure. Overall, this is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Great balance. Extremely pleasant aftertaste. I recommend giving this a try."
"Overall - A pretty good version of a Quad. Maybe a touch sweet for the lighter mouthfeel though. The alcohol is apparent in the taste. Lacks lacing and the beer is a bit hazy. I like the yeast choice though. It gave a hint of citrusy fruitiness to it. Could use a few more years in the cellar."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. A very nice sipping beer for a cool evening."
"This is a very stellar take on the style. from what I remember this is one of the easier drinking Quads I have had before. Victory continues to shine each time I drink their brews. Very Good."
"Well done, Victory!!!"
"Medium bodied with a stronger malt body than I expected with lots of sweetness from the dark fruit and strong alcohol presence. Hints of plum, dark cherry, grape, fig and raisin as well as some candy sugar but these flavors are overpowered by the strong alcohol flavor. ABV not well masked at all hurting this beers drinkabilitu. There is some subtle hops but this beer is too sweet and has too much of alcohol presence. Dry finish."
"I can't say that the taste lived up to my expectations. Rather mono-dimensional. Good front palate, decent mouthfeel, but this beer finishes with a harsh alcoholic note that was almost metallic. Not particularly pleasant."
" I finished the bottle myself and left the sediment in the bottle. This was a good brew and a interesting take on a Belgian staple. I would buy it again if I find an older bottle. Thanks again Dan"
"Out of the caged bomber bottle this brew was a hazy orange-copper color with one finger of khaki-colored head. The collar retention was good and the lacing good too. The aroma was delicious! Citrus, caramel, toffee, alcohol, sweet dough and spices; an excellent blend of hops, malt and yeast elements. The flavors were parallel, equally big and enticing albeit sweet. Starting with the caramel/toffee sweetness it was punctuated by the punch of alcohol in the middle and a bitter, hoppy finish at the end. Complex but not overwhelming. Well balanced and quite drinkable for the massive 12% alcohol. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation light."
"D: Woah, this one is a warmer for sure. It'll make your core warm up quickly. A good, strong sipper that could be a great aperitif or a night cap. But don't operate machinery or anything that requires hand to eye coordination after drinking this one. Because you won't have it."
"D-it has a lot happening, but it seems to work very well. the huge alcohol is also extremely well hidden and only shows up slightly towards the back."
"Considering the high ABV, the alcohol is very well hidden. There is a slight boozy burn, but all things considered, it's quite subdued. It took me a bit under two hours to drink the whole 750 mL."
"D: Very well balanced. Considering the style and ABV, this is amazingly drinkable. ABV is so hidden. I've actually drunk the whole bottle, NO problem man. Overall an outstanding brew. Not perhaps World-class like the St Bernardus or Rochefort 10, but a GREAT US version! Definately find & try."
"D: Considering style and ABV, this is actually quite drinkable. ABV is very well hidden. Overall a solid, but not outstanding brew. Give this one a try."
"Even at 12% there was no Fusels detectable in this fine beer. Spicy, cloves, plums, raisins in both aroma and taste. The flavour blends so well. I dare to say that this is a perfectly balanced beer. The only thing I knocked it down by half a point was the aroma was great, just not to what I would have considered a perfect aroma. I am definitely going to pick up more bottles of this finely crafted brew."
"I was surprised in this beer."
"Goes down far too easily for a beer of this abv. Still, while not hidden if you pay attention you can taste the fact that this stuff is not to be taken for granted, it us quite strong."
"Not a bad American take on a Quad. I think some age would really eliminate some of the noticeable booze."
"D- Not complex and boozy which made this not enjoyable."
"Needs more aging. Not too hard to drink fresh but the alcohol will calm down over time, bringing out more flavors."
"I poured into a snifter from a 25 ounce bottle. It is a deep orange with a medium, short lasting white head. The aroma is sweet bourbon, apples, and ripe fruit. The alcohol is up front, but not overpowering, in the flavor. It is rounded by fruity flavors, apples and pears. It finishes with a hot alcohol. It is a medium sipper. I liked this and would buy it again."
"OVERALL A sipper, as intended. but a very tasty sensory adventure."
"i had this beer with a delirium noel. v-12 is absolutely superior hard to compare with anything else as it is in a category all its own.i will buy all the v12 i can buy!!! complicated beer. well thought out. do not wait five years. the americans make good beer too."
"D - A very potent and powerful offering from the folks at Victory... A definite sipper... An excellent appearance and aroma coupled with a very good taste go a long way, however a slightly over carbonated and fizzy mouthfeel hold this American quad back from being a top tier offering... I would still recommend and welcome the chance to drink again in the future, this one just falls well short of its better known Belgian counterparts.... These 25.4 oz. bottles are not intended for one person, they pack a serious punch and leaving feeling like you were hit over the head with a hammer..."
"D: This is one of those beers that I could drink to relax maybe once or twice a week. Not an everyday beer. I enjoy it in the colder months and wish I could find it more accessible besides just at the brewery."
"Very drinkable and one to enjoy over a long period of time."
"This is a great Indian Summer beer to kick football off with."
"Drinkability: Another top notch brew from Victory. Delicious and time tested. Simply put, it's good. I will absolutely be picking up a few more bottles on my next beer run."
"Taste is sweet and Belgian. Light bitterness and smooth finish. It's a bit sharp and sweet but still has a nice fruitiness to it, very good."
"D - Very drinkable and tasty."
"D - this maybe the best American made quad that i've ever tried. at the least it's the best beer i've had by the fine Victory folks. Dare I say it's world class?? i sampled this bottle fresh, i can only imagine what some aging would do for this tasty beast."
"Overall, sort of one dimensional, with raisin sweetness dominating. The alcohol was pretty well hidden and the mouth feel was appropriate."
"Overall, a good quad and definitely worth picking up if you have the chance."
" D- A nice beer, even if it doesn't stand up to some of the Belgian epics. I would definitely buy it again and see how it ages."
"D-- Excellent beer but took me a good 2 hours to drink it. The warmer it got the more sugar and fruit taste it became. When it was colder it was more of the typical belgian candied sugar and bread taste. 12% is a little big for me so one is more than enough. On a cold night this will warm you up quick. Something I wanted to try while back in the US but a bit big for me. Sip this and enjoy it."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, if you're in the mood for this kind of beer, this is a nice strong Belgian that is worth drinking for as long as you can handle it."
"Drinkability-wise, I think I'd give this a 5 if I could drink it all night long. A bit too sweet and a bit too much abv to make this drinkable all night long. I'll give the big bottle a shot though! CHEERS!!!"
"MF&D - the feel and drinkablity are quite good. the feel is a full medium, with good carbonation. the carbonation is full, but not particularly zesty or potent. nevertheless, the beer goes down easily and one really doensn't take as full a notice as one could of that 12% abv. surprisingly smooth except for the finish, or if the beer is held in mouth for a long time."
"D - High for a 12% ABV quad. Chalk this up as a victory for Victory."
"I went into this with little expectations, and was pretty impressed with the end result. One of the better American versions of a quadrupel I have had. Though not so dark and malty, it is balanced and loaded with plenty of fruity and phenolic characters the best examples of the style possess. Also remarkably approachable for a 12% beer. Recommended. This is a great beer to share with friends, as it is pretty hard to share a tiny bottle that the Belgian quads usually come in. Another victory for... Victory. They do a great job of filling the gaps that most American craft brewers leave. Cheers."
"Goes down smooth despite being so damn strong and a remarkably drinkable beer given the alcohol content."
"man this is strong beer and very good at that i give the guy at victory a standing o they are putting out quality beers at a great price and they are not shorting the consumer on taste or quality! this v twelvw goes along way be careful it is the monkeys bigger brother. if you like raisins and figs and a great buzz you found it"
"CHEERS!"
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but at this ABV one glass a night is fine, so be prepared to save part of it or share it with others. I'll be happy to have this again and surely would pour it for friends and relatives as a special treat."
"Overall it is a very hearty, heavy, intense beer. Would benefit from more subtle complexities, a bit of mellowing and refinement. An EXCELLENT candidate for cellaring, considering that this bottle is only 9 months old."
"D: Cheers to Victory for making an excellent Quadrupel. I just visited their brewery and they are confident in saying they are the best craft brewery on the east coast. I'll second that unless someone wants to steer me in another direction and convince me otherwise. The V-Twelve has been added to one of my top favorites."
"M - Again well done, not too gassy and none of the ingredients hijack the beer. All in all very well done and I would certainly reach for this beer again."
"Good sipper."
"An aptly named brew, easy drinkability, quite a surprise; this beer has a lot to offer to the senses. Entirely to easy to drink, it can get away from you. Enjoy!"
"Belgian Quads are not a style I usually go out of my way for, but this is a decent one. Victory never disappoints, and if you are a fan of the style, this is one to seek out. Not great, but a solid effort."
"Overall this is a solid quad but I didn't think it had enough going on to be anything more than that. I'd like to try the bottle version to see if it gains anything from the bottle conditioning."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, sugary, and full of flavor."
"Drinkability: This is meant to be for sharing, and I kept it for myself. Alone, it just becomes too sweet and boozy. Its fantastic, but share it."
"D. Very sweet to drink, which suits me just fine. Maybe lacking some of the complexity of other Quads, but all in all a pretty damn good beer."
"The beer has a nice complete flavor. The alcohol comes through quite a bit but helps a keep a lingering finish. There is some malty sweetness up front, but it quickly followed by hoppy bitterness and alcohol. All of these flavors resolve themselves as the beers flavor lingers. I like this one, and given the high abv it is quite drinkable."
"Bought from the brewery and poured in a goblet. Seemed a little on the reddish side. An excellent feel in the mouth, somewhat reminiscent of a slightly bitter Chimay quad. Has an exceptional aftertaste that lingers forever. Easy to drink. The Philadelphia area finally has something to be proud of."
"This is a solid Belgian style beer, though I think it's probably more successful as a Belgian pale ale. As a quad, it's a little too sweet and lacks the carbonation and body of the best in the style."
"Pours a medium-bodied purple-amber in color, average head and lacing. Smells like typical sugary raisins normally associated with the genre. Decent flavor, on the sweeter side. Lots of plums, figs, etc. Medium bodied, decently slick mouthfeel. It lacks that bready fillingness, velvery smoothness the best Quads have. Very boozey, though, and this is aged around 16 months. I thought it would have mellowed out a lot more by now. I wouldn't even think of trying this fresh like I did the first time having it before."
"Pours with a deep golden and slightly reddish body and decent light tan quarter to half inch head. Smells are of candied sugars and dark fruits (fig, raisin, apricot?). It tastes good, but I'm not incredibly impressed. It is a bit sweeter than I would like and the flavors are not incredibly deep and complex. It's not as bready and smooth as I was hoping it would be. I will try this again, but I would let it cellar for a few years and to allow the flavors to develop."
"D - very Drinkable would not want to drink alot but would have again."
"d: this is a huge beer with a lot of alcohol, yet it is fairly easy to drink. nice beer all the way around, but definitely not the best representative of the style. interesting beer, and I'm glad to have tried it, but I don't know if I'll be getting it again."
"Medium body, good carbonation, smooth and very easy to drink. The beer did have an oily or slick aftertaste to it. Overall an excellent beer and maybe one of the best quads I have had."
"An all around winner that's big and bold and probably great with Thai food and other bold flavored dishes. A winner."
"750ml caged and corked bottle from McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a murky copper body with an inch and a half to two inches of light tan head. Smells fruity - pears, raisins, citrus - with some spice, caramel, brown sugar... Tastes fruity sweet with caramel and brown sugar notes. Fairly dry despite the robust sweet flavors that equally comprise the flavor. Balanced and subdued as any good quad should be. Smooth medium body with ample carbonation. A sipper for sure (as is to be expected) but one sip most definitely invites another. A really solid quad and an enjoyable beer. Not overwhelming or in your face like a lot of American interpretations are, but balanced and enjoyable."
"Pretty good for 12% One bottle is definitely enough. This is a new favorite for me and my wife. Maybe top 10, maybe top 5"
"D- Ehh...this is probably my least favorite quad thus far. The alcohol isn't exactly well-hidden and the flavor is kinda dirty."
"Extremely smooth mouthfeel and very easy to drink. this is honestly one of the easiest to drink high gravity beer I've tasted."
"250 in and a solid beer. I would have to call this my favorite quad over BLVD and Ommegang's offerings."
"D - This is a pretty good Quad. Despite the high ABV it is not too boozy."
"Overall: This is a fantastic beer that destroys my prejudices about high-alcohol beers. For me, 8% tends to be about the sweet spot. But this beer pulls together the high ABV with some great flavors without being too sweet or too boozy. Great pickup."
"A nice medium body with ample carbonation for a Quad. Easy to drink, but a nice bottle to share with someone. Uncork a bottle and slowly savor the night."
"I could drink quite a bit of this, another excellent offering from the folks at Victory."
"D: Not an overwhelming quad by any means. The flavors aren't as developed as in other quads, but still quite flavorful. The lighter alcohol profile makes it much more drinkable than others, however -- and you can still feel the alcohol in other ways. Well worth the price, add some aging in and this is a stellar beer."
"This is one to enjoy on a cold day as it warms you up. Thankfully I split this bottle and about a 12oz serving is sufficient."
"Notes: This is a pretty nice quad that I enjoyed my time with. A little too sweet from the malts, fruits, and candied sugar for my blood. But, that is what makes Quads great! They deserve to be savored and enjoyed in moderation. Highly recommended with some age on it."
"Bottled in 2007. Thanks for sharing Will!Poured a hazy amber orange color with lots of dregs floating, suspended in the brew. The creamy beige head left no lacing. The aroma is of alcohol , dark fruit, molasses and berries. The taste is super sweet and rich due to the brown sugar and tasty spices. Alcohol is super warming to the mouth and esophagus. This sticky and coating to the mouth. This is delicious but be sure to share the bottle with a friend or wake up dead."
"Here's to Victory and the many victories celebrated by Ferrari and McLaren - Cheers!"
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a clear light brown color with a small off-white head. Doesn't really look like a quad, very thin. The aroma is sweet and spicy. Some banana and clove. Again not something that reminds me of a quad. The taste is of roasted meat and light roasted malt, sweet but not sugary, some honey notes and alcohol soaked prunes. The feel is fairly light for the style, softer carbonation with noticable alcohol burn. Not a very impressive quad; thin, very boozy, odd flavor. I would probably avoid in the future."
"Wow. Shared with mbunje. 7oz of tasting is almost too much. However, it was a great experience and we had great conversation while sipping and discussing the tasting."
"Tasty offering, good at this age but would probably last longer as well."
"An intersting take on a quad (if that is what this is intended to be). probably not worth the $$ but was worth it for the one bottle."
"RJ"
"Drinkability: A whole bomber of this beer is a tough task for just one person, and the alcohol overtook some of the great qualities this beer had."
"D - Slightly better than average drinkability. I would like to give it a go on tap and see what changes."
"smells a lot like apple juice to me. flavor is more of funky yeast and alcohol. not especially tasty. softens as it warms, but not my favorite. overpriced too."
"Poured this reddish brown coloration Belgian-inspired ale into a pint glass. When first poured it came with a nice amount of foam that reduced to wisps of lacing. The aroma is that of fruits and sweet hop aromas. The taste follows suit but then turns to apricot, hops, slight hints of colander. Well balanced as any victory brew has been to me so far!"
"If you want an over the top extreme version of the style, then pour this one. Otherwise, this is too much sweet, syrupy, estery, for someone to enjoy."
"This is a huge beer and also a very tasty one. A nice Quad for sure and worth seeking out."
"Drinkability- Moderate, this is a strong brew at 12%"
"I would drink it again in the winter."
"Tastes similar to the smell. Lots of orange peel and dried fruit. Not horrible but I expect more from Victory and from a quad. I am happy with simplicity from other styles but believe a quad has to have a certain complexity absent in the Twelve. For a 12 abv it masks the alcohol reasonably well. I got through the bomber but kind of wished it was a 12 ouncer so I could move on to something more interesting or tastier."
"The taste does not replicate the complexities of the nose. Less fruity and less sweet than I would have anticipated. There is some additional depth present through a somewhat funky hay quality that seems out of place in a quad and better suited to a saison. The initial fruit flavors described above are muted and brief passing listlessly towards the aforementioned dry hay finish. Less rich and lighter bodied, too. The carbonation is full in all its Belgianesque beauty, but the liquid seems slightly thinner than I would have hoped. The alcohol is hidden in a drying finish, but the warming effect on the throat cannot be dismissed. This doesn't play out as a traditional quad, but is a good beer nonetheless. Yet, nowhere near the best of Belgium. I prefer Victory's German inspired styles better."
"Date consumed: 10 August 2008"
"I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a while. I may to seek out several bottles and see about aging this some."
"I dont drink alot of Quads only on certain occasions,CHRISTmas is one of those occasions.Poured into an oversized wine glass a deep auburn color with a creamy thinner off white head that left patchy lace behind as it settled rather slowly.Aromas of raisin/prune,roasted nuts,brown sugar,and slight phenolic spice with alcohol that creeps.Flavors are like an alcohol dipped holiday fruit cake,its full of dark fruit with notes of a nutty port,a sweet cake-like flavor lingers as well.The alcohol with hit ya but it wont punch ya,a nice holiday-type flavor to it although not intended,maybe a litle early to drink this today....zzz."
"D: Highly enjoyable drink, good drinkability."
"(rated Jul 8, 2008)"
"Drinkability is ok, this isn't the greatest quad, really without any esters, it just a sugary BSPA that's not even that good for one of those. A bummer, I'd been sitting on it for so long, a gift from a close friend, I wish it was better. The ABV is well hidden, but also rather bruising. The label claims it can run for 5 years, and by the numbers (12% quad) I'd make the same guess, but at a little over 1 year old, it doesn't seem to be holding up well. That said, it could be in a lull phase and turn-around with more time, but it's my only bottle in the cellar, and not one I care to restock."
"D - A good drinking quad. Most significantly the reduction of CO2 really helped me enjoy this beer. Otherwise, it's got a great amount of flavor and the alcohol is hidden well and not over the top. Though it might not have been my choice of beers to down 750ml of, I have thoroughly enjoyed this brew."
"Pours a hazy copper with an off-white head. Yeast and fruit dominate the nose. Taste is mostly apricot and apples. Sugary-sweet malt with caramel in the finish. Slow alcohol burn in the finish. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel. A good, strong beer that doesn't go overboard."
"I've like the other Victory brews I've tried, and this one wasn't bad, but not up to the high standards they usually meet."
"Victory's got an impressive Quad here. It's big and badass, but somehow comes across as just a deep and flavorful beer. It doesn't have any glaring flaws. I certainly have no reservations recommending it. Thanks, Chris."
"D: Heavy on peppers and rich complexity. Hits the tongue very nicely and prickles all around. While it drinks pretty easily one should proceed with extreme caution. Glad I picked it up and would recommend at least one good go around."
"Drinkability is low. Why? Because this beer is so strong, there is no way you could drink more than one and even you need to be sharing it. One 750mL bottle will definitely keep you home or wherever it is you drink it. I'm not a black pepper fan, and this beer is all about black pepper. Not my favorite, but a well brewed beer nonetheless."
"Very smooth for 12% i gotta say that. Drinkability is high. This brew could creep right up on you"
"D: It's still a tad bit boozy and at 12% just one goblet has got me buzzing a bit. Flavor is lovely and I can only imagine how good this beer could taste with another year on it. Still, it's really filling and strong--definitely one to sip slowly whilst avoiding over-indulgence."
"Overall, this is a great American Quad. Not quite up there with Southampton Abbot 12 as far as American quads go, and not on par with the Belgians, but this is a great representation of the style."
"750ml bottle served in a snifter. The beer was a dark amber color with a small white head. It had an aroma of cotton candy. A more complex taste consisting of candy, fruit, and some late hops. It got better as it warmed. Now that Victory is here in Maine, I will be looking for this beer."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Nice clear amber color. Raisin/caramel/alcohol nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet mix of raisin and alcohol with a bit of hop, finishes sweet, not cloying. Smooth and one to definitely savor with the very high ABV. $8.75 for a caged 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Drinkability: I found this an easy drinking example of the style... perhaps too easy... not something I'd actively search out as I didn't find it overly complext, but definitely something to try once."
"Drinkability is about right for a Belgian. Splitting the bomber with someone else is about the right amount of this beer."
"D: Flavor being what it is and 12% ABV dictate a nice sipping beer to sink into; won't drink a lot, but love every minute."
"D- the only drawback to this is that its too potent to attempt a second. it crept up on me the more empty the bottle became. ive had this one fresh as well, and i dont remember it being this great. time has definitely worked in this beers favor. im glad i have some more of this years versions left in the basement."
"Overall it is a phenomenal beer."
"D: Not so much because the flavours are so strong."
"a hint of spice, mildley sour and a strong alcohal presance then an almost fruty quality comes in as the beer warms. their is a sweet quality through out this one, might be nice to cellar a few of these, this one still seamed a little green"
"D: This is an excellent drinking brew."
"Overall, Victory V-Twelve is a pretty solid American attempt at a Belgian Quad. I bought a bottle for immediate consumption, and a second bottle to hold on to for aging. This one should age very nicely and improve quite a bit in a couple years."
"""Victory"". Seemed to be the proper beer for cheering the Americans to victory in the Olympics. The beer pours with a bright ruby hue, abundance of carbonation with great staying power, lacing, and legging. Beers just don't look any better than this. Aside from being a bit light (Dubbel-like), the beer is ideal. Aromas of cotton candy, confectionate sugars, rich fruits, rum-like alcohols, and a surprisingly large amount of pine and floral hops. The balance in the nose is of the candied fruits, alcohols, and hops. Flavors of sweet confectionate sugar, cherries, berries, apples, figs, dates, grapes, apples and pears make for a sweetly balanced brew. A burst of perfumy, floral, herbal, and pine hops fight hard to balance the sweetness and nearly dominate at times. The taste of alcohol with the hops compete too much to appreciate the delicacy of the beer. Textures are more sweet-syrupy than malty. Heat and abrassion from the alcohol-hop blend prove too much to be the drinkable beer that it wants to be. Finishes sticky sweet, dry, and with a lingering floral note. Age will surely be kind to this beer."
"I would not buy this beer again, but I guess the 12% will have me buzzing by the time I am done with this one."
"D- Easy to drink, the 12% ABV is not a stinger and is hidden very well."
"Split a 750 bottle with friends, served in a Chimay chalice. I found this beer to be surprisingly drinkable for the 12% alcohol. In fact, for the strength, I also found the taste and aroma to be a bit muted. Still I found a wonderfully complex flavor full of mellow fruit, like plum and tangerine, with Euro hops spice around the edges. Worth trying."
"What can I say? It's good. Many thanks to Foxman for the chance to taste this one! So... Let's think about this a minute... What the heck is that flavor? Oddly, I've decided that the second flavor in this is beets. Before that it's rich, sweet caramel candy. Hmm. You know... I wish I had another bottle or two of this. I'd like to compare it with some other awesome quads - side by side. I mean, I'm curious! But, hey, this is really good and even though it's a limited release it's a lot easier to get than, say, westy, you know? Good stuff - wish I had a few cases of it!"
"Pretty good as far as American made Quads go, but I think I'd go with Three Philosophers first. The strong alcohol finish detracts from the drinkability."
"Drinkable, for its effects more than the taste, but not my much."
"Corked bottle was an automatic plus in my eyes. But the beer itself stood on its own besides presentation. Murky, dark amber with little to no head or lacing. Faint dark fruits, malts, barley. Aromas lack an alcohol punch to them so this is not overpowering at all. But the taste definitely shows the beer's true colors. Very, very sweet and malty with a perceived alcohol taste that is very well balanced. Mouthfeel is a silky, crisp texture; a slow night sipping is recommended to enjoy this one. Overall, really good."
"Highly recommended. I've always thought this was quite solid fresh; it is nice to know it ages well too."
"D: If you're into quads, then give this a shot. It's one of the best American examples of a Belgian quadrupel."
"Fruity flavors and a slight astringency of alcohol. Thick white head that dissipates with fine carbonation, champagne-like as another BA pointed out. Strong malt flavor comes through as well. All in all not a bad beer, recommended but not a must have."
"M/D - Med to heavy mf. Very fine carb somewhat champagne like. Sweet finish, but a great quad. Very complex flavors overall"
"Let this beer warm up. It becomes much much better and the fruitiness comes out. If not, it's overly astringent and boozy."
"""Liquid Luxury," as stated by the bottle, is quite right. It has surely seduced my soul. A damn fine brew; strongly recommended and worth every penny."
"D : It's ok but a little too boozy"
"Damn, but this is a classic beer."
"Drinkability - Oh you could go overboard with this quickly. High alcohol and high drinkability can be a dangerous combo, but hey you'll be smiling when you call for a cab."
"D - I really enjoyed this one. I thought is was a good example of a Quad and I would love to get my hands on another."
"Overall a decent Belgian-style beer, though not particularly inspiring. Nevertheless it's certainly worthwhile trying it!"
"This brew pub is less than 1 hour away from me and the trip is so worthwhile!!! I purchased a 22 oz bottle from the bottle shop at Victory took it home and Voila! instant gratification! Pours a dark amber colour with a finger or two head that disappeared quickly, leaving a light lacing. Aroma had scents of sweet fruits, and well as the taste. The 12% ABV is well hidden in this tasty quad style brew."
"this beer is better as it warms up, but it's not my favorite quad."
"Drinkability: It's all kinds of decent, even with the raw, searing booziness."
"Bottom line is that this is a great brew. It is more English and American than Belgian, but very good. Drink at cellar temp and above."
"Drinkability- Very impressed with this one, especially with 4 years under it's belt."
"Nice brew for a cold night!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"For a 12% Quad, this was not bad at all in terms of drinkability. But you must enjoy slowly, and commit to this beauty for the duration of the evening."
"This is surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer. I really enjoyed it."
"This beer pours a cloudy reddish-brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of anise, plums, dates, caramel, black licorice, and rock candy. The taste is full of dark fruits with a spicy anise and alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with low, fine carbonation. Overall, this is a nice quadrupel, that I will surely drink again."
"drinkability- For the most part the beer is very drinkable but the high ABV is something to watch out for."
"This is a Belgian strong ale, so it poured a hazy brownish copper with ungodly amounts of light tan head. It smelled like apricot and hops to me, although Jeremy didn't smell any apricots at all. It tasted much like it smelled, with apricot and copper hops dominating the flavor. There was some bitterness lingering in the aftertaste, and slight alcohol warming, but no big kick to it so it wasn't too hard to drink. The texture was smooth, and it had pretty good carbonation. Overall it was interesting and enjoyable, but not my favorite style of beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Much lighter color than a quadrupel should be. Not much of a head either. Smell is boozey with a little bit of fruit in the nose. Taste is way too subdued to be considered an outstanding quad. The alcohol is very prominent. Unfortunately the alcohol is the most prominent taste. I get a little bit of dried fruit but it is quite underwhelming. Overall, a decent try at a quad, but not the best."
"Overall experience: I keep coming back to V12 for that big belgian like experience. Another well done beer for Ron & Bill."
"Maybe if the bar weren't so high for the style, I would have given it a bit higher in marks, but, though it does have some nice qualities, esp. in the aroma department, it just doesn't match up with some others I can think of...Also - booziness and general lack of depth don't help..."
"This is great to sip slowly and deeply for a nightcap. Very good stuff that I'll do best to sample again."
"love the complexity, but disappointed in the head retension, alcohol content kicked my ass"
"Bottled on 10-05-07. Poured a 750 into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a dark amber golden with a slight off white head that receded into nothingness and left no head along with no lacing. Aroma is big on toffee and vanilla with hints of cheery and a finish that's fitting of the 12% it professes. Taste is interesting. Quads are normally a bit sweet for me, but I didn't find that this one fit the bill. It was sweet, don't get me wrong, but not what I normally think of a Quad. There were also cherries and sweet fruits like apples. Also it had a finish that was big on the alcohol. Splendid. I really enjoyed this. Mouthfeel was full and a bit dry. For me, I think this is the most drinkable Quad I've ever had."
"D: This is a sweet bomb similar to the Avery Grand Cru...very rich, complex and satisfying. It hides its high ABV well but after finishing a 750 ml bottle it would be hard to take on a second in a single session."
"D - I like the first one, but I am not sure how many I could follow it with. Either way, it's everything I expected."
"Overall: Victory makes another wonderful beer. Tons of nice sweet flavors mingled with fruit and booze. Was a wonderful drinking beer. I really liked it."
"Bottled on January 9th, 2006. Consumed the night of January 12, 2008. Aroma is yeast, citrus, dates/figs, spices, some alcohol and some copper. Pour is a muddy brown-orange hue with a frothy tan head. Taste is odd, almost like a strong nutmeg eggnog at first, not bad, but very different from what I assume was a Quadrupel attempt. A bit closer to a Tripel, but still not distinct. Mouthfeel wasn't great for the style or price. Decent alcohol present on the finish."
"Copped a 750 ML bottle, caged and corked, from Bottle King in Livingston for about $8.00... certainly one of the best Victory brews I've ever sampled, and more than likely the best Quadrupel I've come across in a long time... the beer boasts the typical Quad flavors without the cloying over-sweet taste usually depicted in other brews of the same style... Pours a dark-brown, mahogany hue with impressive foamy and frothy head that soon disippated... smell was really noticeable, rich, deep, sweet-fruit aroma with esters and some alcohol noticeable... Taste was dominant with pears, apples, florals, candied, brown sugars, and a thick, rich, and fulfilling mouthfeel... an excellent represenation of the style and probably one of the best Quadrupels out there on the market... Sweet, creamy, candied taste is apparent but not overwhelming, and the hefty 12% ABV is only slightly noticeable behind a thick cornucopia of amazing flavors... Victory did very well with this one... one of their better brews... Definitely recommended..."
"Cloudy amber with a small, vanishing head - a slim ring remains. Smells of apples, spiced fruit, and toasted, somewhat bready, malts. Sugary orange caramel. The flavor is much more forward: ripe fruit and a candi-sugar sweetness that builds into the aftertaste. Very powerful stuff, the alcohol is pretty noticeable. Peppery, grape-skin. Medium bodied, slickly smooth, and warming. Gets better as it warms for sure."
"A whole lot of subtleties that combine to create a a big pile of fairly intense awesome."
"Definitely powerful. The alcohol is hidden nicely enough to make this drinkable, but it is definitely present. I think its great. Unless this is your entire night, find someone to split the bottle with. If it is your entire night hey, it was mine and I dont judge."
"Aroma just barely above average in presence; really need to take a good strong whiff to get the scent, mostly of malts. Head and lace are minimal to non-existent, while the color is an unremarkable murky tan. Flavor is good at masking the high alcohol, which as a nice warming effect, but lacks complexity. Mouthfeel is about average. A decent beer, and one of the most quaffable for such high ABV, but Im a bit surprised at the super high scoring..."
"This might be the nicests smelling quad I have ever encountered, though. Lots of candied fruit smells and heavy, yeasty dough-like nuances. Taste is pretty sweet with plenty of fruit and bread dough, and then a really aggressive alcohol punch. Par for the course in the way of quads. A good example of a style that really isn't for me. I have a couple of 750's of this aging and I'll be curious to see what this is like in 2 or 3 years."
"I would have again but this beer does indeed to spend sometime in the cellar."
"Pours a cloudy orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, huge alcohol and big citrus, corriander. In the taste, a sweet maltiness, alcohol, and corriander. A smooth alcohol mouthfeel and a dry, corriander alcohol aftertaste. Ages very well, smooth with big alcohol, somewhat like a huge saison, or Belgian pale, more than a quad."
"D: Very good take on the style and something I would order again and again as dessert (insteady of whiskey or brandy). Very nice sipper."
"Overall a decent, drinkable beer that's a bit stronger than what I prefer for a Belgian style brew."
"Victory is a brewery that constantly comes out with quality products. This is one of them that I have not tried. Pours a nice strawberry coloration, with a white heading that is just a bit bigger than a lacing that lasts throughout. Smell is full of sweet fruit, namely strawberry, grape, melon and pomegranate. There is also a sweet honey characteristic in the aroma, probably a result of the alcohol. Taste is juicy full of fruit such as those mentioned above. Starts off very fruity and ends on a slight dry note. Either way, it is bursting at the seams with fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is heavy, but not necessarily viscous or syrupy, more slick I would say. Carbonation is just right on this one in that it is apparent, but below the sweet alcohol, balancing everything out nicely. This is an exceptional example of an American made Quadruple. Even better than some of the Belgian examples I have tasted. I would be happy to see this brew in stores all year round. This brewery is victorious again."
"Poured hard into a wide-mouthed glass. Little to no lacing after the minute or two that the head needed to settle. The smell is largely reminiscent of banana and sweet malt. The mouthfeel is quite viscous and the palate again shows the banana and malty goodness, but finishes with some bittery hopiness that helps mask some of the alcohol. Long finish on this one, but I'd have to say that I would almost catergorize this as a barleywine or strong ale instead of a Quad."
"d: A very fine American quad. I look forward to more of these."
"D---Well, a couple of these and you are quite buzzed. Worth drinking."
"Go this as a gift in a 25 oz bottle. Beautiful dark copper/orange with substance and a significant head that dimishes to a nice lace. Can briefly taste carmel/maltiness fruit with a strong alchohol finish along with a decent hop bitterness. Feels warm and creamy in mouth but not flat - awesome. The booziness makes its drinkability questionable - I'm only on my first glass and feeling it pretty good."
"A fine example of the style, pours a murkey garnet with off white head. Great lacing. Smell is typical of the style, cherries, plums and that funky earthiness. Taste is the same with a near perfect mouthfeel. I'd like to be able to drink more than one but I felt the effects of this one pretty quickly, it's really easy to drink one. I will put this in rotation with St Bernardus abt12, Three Philosophers etc, if I can find it again. A solid offering from a great brewery."
"D-I really like this beer and what they have done to balance it. It is surely not an everyday beer, but it is very easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"D - This is the second time I have tried this beer - although I like it, I liked it better the first time. Big beer - a sipper to be sure."
"750ml bottle from Bevmo. Pours a nice cloudy copper color with a short lived off white head. Observed minimal lacing. The aroma was strong with spices, malts, alcohol and dried plums. The flavor was dominated by a distinct, and distracting, hard alcohol taste. Other flavors in the background were caramel, malts, and toffee. I am unable to evaluate the hops as the alcohol taste keeps getting in the way. The mouthfeel is full and satisfying. The finish is long with a big alcohol burn. Overall: Too strong for me, I poured this one down the drain. I can not rule out that I got an isolated bad bottle--may re-evaluate again sometime in the future. Not recommended."
"The beer poured a deep amber almost brown with a nice lasting frothy head. The aroma was of burnt caramel, dried fruits, molasses and some spice. The taste was a complex blend of brown sugar, fruit, caramel and spice. A strong alcohol presence exists as well, but is not too overpowering. The beer is not anywhere as syrupy as I have experienced with the style. This one is an extreme sipper, however. I am glad to have tried this one."
"Pours cloudy copper with fierce carbonation, a finger of rich tan foam, and sheets of lace. The aroma features caramel malts, damp earth, yeast, orange fruit, coriander and pepper spice notes. The flavor is quite peppery, with fruity cherry and carmel notes that become increasingly medicinal and sour as you drink. Doesn't seem particularly alcoholic at first, but turns quite boozy after a few swallows. Extremely smooth, creamy, and dense body. Looks and feels great, but could use more complexity of flavor and alcohol balance."
" It had a decent amount of body to it and was very drinkable. A bit of alcohol burn was detected. I would love to have more of this except that its a bit pricey."
"Poured a dark amber with little head or lacing. The first thing that hits you in the smell is the aroma off alcohol, followed by Belgian yeast smells of banana and clove. A bready smell is there as well as some sweetness. The taste is super smooth, which is especially nice given the 12% abv. It is winey, bready, and has a long malt sweetness. The finish exhibits banana and spice as well. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and integrated. Unbelievably drinkable for the high alcohol. Very pleasant."
"D: Quite similar to Rochefort or St. Bernardus. I don't find this one particularly outstanding, but it's very good for an American brewed quad. Perhaps some more age would do this well."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth, comfortable"
"If you haven't had it, I would definitely give it a try."
"Fantastic beer, cannot wait to have more"
"This is not a regular drinking beer, although it is easy to taste. For one person, I find the 22 oz bottle to be too much of a good thing."
"I only wish it wasn't 12% alcohol or I would be drinking this all night. Did I mention I rode my bike to the brewery? Yeah, I live that close."
"Maybe it's because I don't have access to their beer (except on my occasional trips to Ohio), but I sometimes forget just how talented to good folks at Victory are. V-Twelve is one of the few Belgian-style ales (not brewed by Allagash or Russian River) that I now think of as world-class. I can't wait to acquire a fresh bottle. In a word, this one is... superb."
"A decent beer overall. A bit sweet for my liking but a great effort from Victory. I generally like Victory beers and this one is no slouch. Give it a shot, although I probably will not attempt a second effort."
"Not so shabby...kind of nice."
"D - A lot of sweetness like crystallized or candy sugar. Nice spice - a bit malty, but well made and beautiful spice in the yeast gives it a drinkability that is fierce + above average, but shows the high abv in it's taste. I would definitely advise splitting this big belgian style ale."
"Pours a hazy, dark amber color with a huge head of foam that threatens to overflow onto the kitchen counter. Looks very lively and Belgian. Aroma was very spicy and fruity with notes of caramel and honey in the nose. Taste was also quite spicy and fruity with lots of caramel malt, yeasty flavors, molasses and warming alcohol. The alcohol was very evident in fact and hurt the drinkability slightly. Mouthfeel was medium-full in the palate. The beer finishes with a good bit of peppery spices in the back of the throat. Overall, a very nice interpretation of the style that would probably benefit from some aging. I'm continually amazed how well American brewers are crafting Belgian style beers."
"from zrrbrrt in a bombing/ No BS Beta combo"
"Reddish-amber with golden tints, rocky white head is soon gone with the wind leaving a mottled white surface. It smells Belgian. The taste is thick, sweet, fruity, and delicious, wow! The alcohol is not really detectable overtly but the thickness and sweetness make me sure it is strong. This is an excellent beer and possibly the best I have had from Victory."
"D: Strong alcohol taste does not get in the way of this good tasting quad. Great paired with a sharp cheddar cheese."
"Don't drink and review."
"Well done brew. I don't have alot of experience with the quads but this would appear to be a good example of the style."
"The texture is not too lean and not too thick. It's more creamy than fizzy, and the way it just sort of coats your tongue is incredible. I hope I can finish this bottle, as the alcoholwhich isn't intended to be hiddenis already making its presence known!"
"Big strong beer and very nice sipper. Doesn't have a lot of the finesse of a lot of strong-belgian ales but is still a pretty nice effort."
"Amazingly drinkable for what it is, a quad. From memory it's every bit as sensational as the V-Grand Cru was as a BSDA."
"Wow, this was one hell of a big beer. Poured a deep dark brown with no real head, just a thin layer of lace around the top of the glass, which did stick tough on its way down as well. Smell was alot of alcohol, could really set you back for a second, once it warmed it had a nice dark fruity grain like smell. The taste was a bit harsh, like rocket fuel harsh, too hot for me, and I like big beers. I really feel the alcohol really drowned out any of the subtle flavors that were there, just really overwhelmed it. The feel was good, smooth, not thin or watery and not too heavy. I think the real reason this suffers again is just too much alcohol. Still a good beer though, maybe just needs to sit for a while to age."
"This beer went down way too easy. Too easy to drink, but the warming feeling is very pleasant. I still have a bottle with the same bottling date. I wonder what it will be like at college graduation."
"Overall a good beer experience but if you are looking for a quadrupel, go with Rochefort 10 or Three Philosophers. Worth a try."
"Overall impression: This is a decent belgian offering - not my favorite I've had, but certainly enjoyable, and a decent value from Victory."
"I can't get anything nearly as complex in the flavor. Up front I can get the a little of the fruit middle is all bready, and the finish seems a bit off with a sour boozy funk. However, the lingering numbing and fruit is nice."
"This beer definitely falls within my top three favorite beers. I love the beer itself and the price is reasonable at $8 for a 750. It pours into my wide-mouth Chimay glass with a beautiful rosey color and not too much head. It smells sweet with some fruity tones. The taste is wonderful. Sweet and fruity at first and then ballanced out very nicely. Pick this one if you get a chance. Very drinkable!"
"D: A solid representation of the style. Very clean and quite complex. Alcohol is present but not as intense as the 12.00 % would imply. Recommended."
"Pours a fairly clear burnt orange with an off-white bubble filled head. Lacing is here and there throughout tasting, but not much of it. The aroma starts off with a nice floral burst. Along with that comes the powerful fruity sweetness that dominates; apple, peach, pears. A tiny hint of toffee malt odor peaks as well. Flavor of this beer is very complex. The taste has a buttery alcohol flavor to it. Spiced orange peels tickle the tounge as well. As this beer warms, a caramel apple flavor seems to appear along with a tiny bit of smokey pepper. Carbonation makes the mouthfeel a bit rough, lots of continuous bubbles. Drinkability is scary good, 12% abv, you sure? Probably should have shared this with someone, definitely my only review of the night. Another win for Victory! wow, how lame...my bad."
"the 22 oz bomber was a bit much. moving on to some more solid brews seems right."
"D - It's a sipper at 12%, but a delicious sipper nonetheless. It gets better as it warms, really aiding the drinkabilty. A great offering from Victory, and one of the top American-made Belgian-style dark ales."
"Taste goes from a buttery cream to a bouquet of fruity esters- melon, peach, and banana. Strawberry? Pineapple? Loads of sweet sugar, lemon cake? A slight citrusy ethanol twang in the aftertaste but overall the booze taste is very mild for such a potent brew. Highly drinkable. A very impressive Belgian brew for an American company."
"Overall, this beer was very unimpressive. It can't hold a candle to the likes of Rochefort, Westy, or St. Bernardus for that matter. There wasn't much depth to this beer. I think Victory is capable of being right on the mark with beers like Prima Pils, but like Hop Wallop, this one fell pretty short of being good."
"DA:"
"Nice brew, that I'll definitely partake of again."
"Drinkability: Good, but dangerous."
"one of the top 2 quad styles brewed in the us that i can think of - glad victory finally tapped the colorado beer market."
"Pours a hazy orange with red tints. Lots of bubbles. Looks festive. Nose is sweet ethanol and hints of malts. Not bad. Taste is very sweet, with slight hop bitterness, and alcohol at the end. I can taste 11 of the V's; not sure where the 12th one went. Mouth is super foamy. Way too foamy! It's like a bubble party in my mouth. Drinkability is average. Reminds me more of a new barleywine than a Quadrupel. Not bad at all though."
"Review from a bottle I bought while in PA and shared at our beer tasting club. Pours brown/orange with a tan/yellow head. Odiforous spicy alcohol nose. effervescent. Taste has a lot of fruity alcohol. Fruitiness is dense and thick. some fermenting bananas and spicy yeasty flavors. Alcohol violently evaporates off my tongue. mouthfeel has a cottony chewiness. a fine and dandy offering from Victory, but in terms of the style it doesn't blow me away or anything."
"I do really enjoy this one. I do start to feel the 12% about halfway through though, not that I'm complaining."
"Not a session ale, but interesting to keep you going back. This bottle is just a little young, but a nice quad = to a lot from belgium I've had"
"750 mL cork-n-cage, bottled on 1/9/06 and sampled on 11/23 (just found my notes for this beer today). It pours a lightly-hazed garnet with high carbonation and a modest head that leaves light lacing. The aroma is grainy, with phenolic cloves and medicinals, fruits (peach, nectarine, grape), herbs (chamomile?), and a lightly musty character. It is quite fruity on the palate, with pear, honeydew, melon rind, banana?, and green/yellow apples. In addition, there are phenols, a touch of cork, and light hops that impart a mild bitterness. Toward the end it becomes a touch too sweet, but quite nice on the whole. It is lightly drying with a medium body and a champagne-esque effervescence, leaving a medium finish. Overall a refined, quite drinkable Belgian that belies its 12%, as I had no problem finishing the bottle myself."
"Overall, a well done Belgian ale."
"I look forward to drinking one of these at the 4 year mark. A very nice US brewed quad! enjoy!"
"Fairly full bodied, but a bit slick. This beer is a conundrum. Like many American Belgian style brews, it is really too much. The yeast didn't seem to fully do it's job, plus the brewer just went balls to the wall with gravity and as a result the beer is sweet, overtly alcoholic and a bit messy around the edges. On the other hand, it follows the trend of Victory making extremely drinkable beers, and despite the problems I had with it, I had and enjoyed seconds from this beer."
"Bottling date is August 27, 2004 and it has been cellared since then. Absolutely zero head, but a nice dark amber color. Aroma was wonderful: heavy malt, bread, moderate yeast, dark cherry, clove. What a great feel on the palate. More carbonation feel than I had expected based on zero head. 12% alcohol - sure couldn't tell. This was very, very easy drinking. Not a dark tasting as Chimay, but really incredibly good. I think I 'll let my other bottles age a bit longer and see what happens."
"Head is first joint thickness, lots of tiny, tight white bubbles with good retention. Body is a musty brownish, red, rust color. Some strong esters here, banana, cloves, apple, pears, not many or really any dark fruit, like expected, this smells more like a tripel to me. Smells of bread, sticky sweet pale malt, the alcohol is subdued in the smell for a 12 abv. The taste is a lot like the scent, sweet sticky malt, slight apply bitterness, the alcohol is a bit more present in the flavor than the sent. The mouth feel is soft and round, but the alcohol and slight bitterness of the hops give the beer quite a bit more weight. To me this is not a quad in any way other than it's strength. If I want a tripel I'll grad something else, as to quads I'll stick to my st. Bernardus 12. Not that this is not a tasty brew, but I like my quads a little different. All the same give it a try."
"Drinkability is pretty good. The complexity of this beer makes for an enjoyable experience but the high ABV always demands respect."
"Overall a nice beer. I think i would rather move forward from this beer than come back to it."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not gonna lie, a little harsh at first, but blossoms as it warms and gets some dregs. Sweetens up and gains a lot more character. A unique experiment for Victory, not always successful but clearly well-made."
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer, but little beyond its high alcohol content sets it apart in my mind. If I were to design a stealth session beer, it would be much like this one. In any case, I would gladly buy and enjoy another one."
"Pours copper and slightly cloudy, fairly active head fades back pretty quickly. Smell is a rich sugary sweetness of honey and caramel, there is a little alcohol evident in the aroma. Taste is more complex with some breadiness, caramel, a lemon and grass like flavor, and some pepperiness that blends well with the alcohol warmth in the finish. Mouthfeel is belgian-like, fairly active and crisp effervescence with some peppery spiciness that mixes with the warming alcohol. Alcohol is well balanced for its strength. Fairly enjoyable beer that I might not run right out for but would definitely drink again."
"D: Great. Probably could use another 12-16 months to really shine. Gorgeous flavor none the less."
"Nice auburn color, thinnish head. Nice aroma. Not very robust, a bit thin on the tongue and somewhat lacking in the flavor dept, tho there is a slight fruitiness to the flavor, and a bit of alcohol warming on the back of the throat. It's a bit thin on the mouth for a quad- very deceptive for the strength. More of an easy drinker than a sip 'n savor. Overall a good beer, but not a great example of the style. I don't think I would go out of my way for this one, as there are much better American quads just as, if not more readily, available."
"Actually pretty nice, I enjoyed this one."
"Poured a heavily hazed amber, with a moderate head of foam that quickly receded to just a thin layer on the surface. The settled foam did, however, stick around for a while. Slight lacing left behind. The smell is an irony richness, with a sweet fruit mist and a hint of alcohol. Fermenting plums maybe. The taste is pretty similar to the aroma. Sweetness from the malts complimented with fruit and an alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with a dry finish. At 12%, I dont think its wise to have too many; however, I got through the 750 mls pretty quickly."
"This is definitely a heavier-bodied beer. Strong alcohol presence and overwhelming sweetness hurt the drinkability, however. This is a very rich and flavorful brew, though the balance is not quite what I was hoping for. Nonetheless, it's one of the better ""Belgian-style"" brews I've tried, and would definitely recommend it."
"Body is colored like autumn leaves. A nice fluffy pillow of a head adorns the top. Nose is like a cherry pie straight out of the oven. There's also a bit of caramel syrup and a pleasant earthiness. Taste is of caramel, cherries, candy apple, and smooth unsweetened cream. Mouth is immensely thick and pleasurable. I greatly enjoyed this beer."
"Medium bodied with modest but enduring CO2. Basic in some ways, but nice regardless. And drinkable far beyond its 12%."
"Full flavor and very sweet. Lots of candy and Belgian sugars going on in there. Some slight bitterness. Thick malty base. Bits of dark fruit-particularly prunes. Full mouthfeel with some alcohol burn, but not nearly what I would expect for a 12% ABV. Had this one cellaring for a while. Wish I had cracked it open sooner."
"I think this beer might make a decent session beer. The flavor is not overly aggressive, but the alcohol content is high, making putting back too many a problem."
"($6.99 / 25.4 oz. tall brown wine-like bottle, corked and caged)"
"Drinkability- One bomber is enough at 12%. Very smooth and creamy and a fantastic after dinner drink."
"Drinkability: At 12%, this is not a beer for the faint of heart. Enjoy it as a digestif."
"The body is full, as is the flavor. This beer goes big in all aspects, yet doesn't overdo it like some American brewers of quadruple. Not huge on the drinkability on the other hand. Still a good beer."
"Not at all a bad brew, and fairly cheap for a beer of the style. Definitely pick one up if you see it, but be prepared for a somewhat different experience than you might expect."
"Drinkabilty - not crazy about this beer, so it goes down with some effort. Also high abv of 12% limits this to a rare-once-in-a-while type drink."
"I rate drinkability purely as a ""How much could you drink, and are inclined to?"" ABV plays a huge role in this. In *spite* of its 12% ABV, I'm absolutely making a go at a 750mL by myself. Share? Hah! Sharing is for that Duvel in my cabinet, or that Angelique. This stuff is aalll mine."
"Tasty spicy citrus, the alcohol is fairly well hidden (but not perfectly hidden)- this is a pet peeve of mine when the beer tastes like rocket fuel- this one doesn't. Rich, full mouthfeel, it's a well made beer, but it doesn't grab me and make my head spin as I fall in love with it. It's pretty good, glad it made the trip from the east coast for me to try, but it's probably one I'll pass on to try something else next time."
"The drinkablitity of this brew has to be a little low due to it's ABV (12%). It's an above averge beer in my tastes, but not remarkable. I could have a couple, but it's not a staple. Another solid offering though, from a great brewery."
"Pours a dark orange, copper color with a little haze. One inch thick off white almost creamy yellow colored head. Decent head retention, with some spotty lacing. Decent carbonation. Lots of bready, yeasty smells upfront, followed by apples, pears, malts and spices. Some booziness aromas also. Tons of sweet malt flavors, maybe a little too sweet. Some hop bitterness and a definite alcohol warm feeling. Full bodied brew that goes down smooth. Overall a good brew, whose alcohol content will kick your ass. Drink this one with caution!"
"I'd suggest trying it for its style, as there aren't many out there. However, note that it is strong and very young at this point in time to enjoy. Buy one, but hold off on opening it."
" Taste has some spices upfront, then grapes and other dark fruits. Needs time to mellow. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, definitely coating. Average drinkability, probably needs some more age."
"this beer is one of those that doesn't taste at all like it smells: the fruit nose gave way to a very spicy flavor (both sweet, however). a small amount of alcohol heat and very spritzy from the carbonation. the sweetness really hangs around"
"The mouth is full and a bit thick but there is ample carbonation that cuts through it leaving only the slightest trace of residuals. For such a big ass beer, this is quite tasty and drinkable. I find no real fault with this beer, but I would like it to look better. Minor detail, IMHO, but at any rate this is a prime example of a Belgian style from America that is done right."
"Mouthfeel- Sugars take over most of the palate with with some very light but well balanced bitterness too malt ratio. Definetly satifying."
"I picked up a bottle for a special occasion, but the guy I was splitting it with is strictly a macro-drinker, so this was a mistake for his first venture into Quads. But I thought is was AWESOME!! I'm so glad I live on the East Coast and can find Victory beer anywhere!! The Twelve was poured into a snifter and allowed to warm, that's when it got really interesting. Complex yet balanced. Fruity, malty, bready, full. I picked up some plum and almost a black cherry in the taste. The alcohol, however, was not masked as well as in a Belgian quad. Great beer, but never, ever try it out on a newbie."
"Cheers!"
"This here is some tasty grist ma! Very drinkable, but yet I think it lacks a bit of complexity...even so, I'm enjoying this one to it's fullest potential."
"thanks goes to weeare138 for this.bottle mar. 29th 05.poured a amber copper with a big light kahki colred head. aroma with the corked popped got a big whiff of brown sugar, when the nose went to the glass got honey, grains , hops some tartness leaning to sour, alcoho, fuzzy fruit. flavor the alcohol kind of took over but not over powering than along came the sweetness than hops and a hint of apple. good beer"
"Pours a hazy red/orange/brown, big loose white head, dies pretty quick, some lacing though. Smell is all apples, some caramel and citrus, alcohol, and a little yeast. Taste is apples and caramel, wheat, citrus, sweet through the middle, alcohol/apple finish, little bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with high carbonation. Not bad, was expecting a little bit more from it, but a capable USA Belgian ale. Thanks DrJay!"
"Burnt orange colour with a rocky, dark cream head. Aroma of caramel followed by apple skins, bready yeast, and alcohol spiciness. Crackery malt flavour with a bit of caramel apple fruitiness. Alcohol is quite warm, but not harsh. Fizzy carbonation with a medium body. Fairly dry. This has probably mellowed a bit, but still quite tasty."
"This quad pours from the bottle with a very thick, long lasting, bubbly head. It has a kind of maple syrup-y light brown hue. At first taste, the malts are overpowering, a veritable malt explosion. Then it has a buttery smooth flavor and goes down quite easy. But overall not a very impressive ale. Tasty, but not as drinkable as i would have thought."
"It's big, and it's got a lot going on, but to be trendy, it's all good. The fruity aspects provide a nice foil for the hefty ABV. And that ABV places a real limit on how much you might want to drink, but what you drink is sweet, damned tasty, and nicely warming. I'd imagine it's not necessarily everyone's cup of tea, but I thoroughly enjoyed it...the whole bottle. Shame on me, but I've no regrets (though see me in the morning for an update!)"
"not the most complicated quad to pass these lips, but not a bitch I would kick out of bed either. Tasty enough but not in the same league as it's belgian counterparts. A solid effort though, I'll throw one in the cellar for a couple of years and see what shakes loose..."
"A big body with size 12 shoes. A syrupy texture and a warm phenolic taste that finishes and hangs around limits the taste overall. I think this is a great beer but good use more time to sit and mellow out more."
"Body is naturally big, slick, and syrupy, with a very creamy mouthfeel and smooth texture. The 12% abv is only noticable once the bottle is finished, and I begin to slide off of the couch. This was consumed immediately after drinking St. Bernardus Abt 12 on a fresh tap and it was a very nice follow up. The best big V beer from Victory I've had so far."
"I'm not sure what the ""retired"" status of this beer means; if Victory is no longer making it and the supplies that are out there is all we're going to get, I would say that you should pick up a bottle if you get the chance. Hell, pick up a few, as I'm sure they'd cellar well. You won't regret it."
"If there ever was one, this is ""the champagne of bottled beers"" very little pun intended. As listed on this site as retired, all I can say is sorry to those who have not had the pleasure because I can't recommend trying this fine ale enough! Awesome job Victory!!!"
"Bottle (courtesy of Shaughn256): Poured a clear mild brown ale with a medium foamy slightly off-white head with great retention. Aroma of what I think is candi sugar is quite evident and well back by strong malt. Taste is also quite sweet, maybe even a tad too much for my liking with a dry hops finish. Not bad overall but just seems to be lacking complexity and yeast signature is way too discreet. Body is above average but could have been more full and bit more creamy. Interesting but I definitely had better beers from Victory."
"750ml bottle, this is the first time i've ever needed a corkscrew for a bottle of beer! Pours a dark rusty orangish/amber color with a MASSIVE head of foam (pour this one slowly, folks) . Aroma is fruity, sugary, and candy sweet. Taste is reminiscient of sweet hard apple cider, with some maltiness and a definite alcohol bitterness. This is obviously one potent brew! Has a sparkly, bubbly medium mothfeel to it with alcohol burn on the swallow. Great beer, a little strong on the alcohol prescense, but maybe that's a good thing, since you'll know from the first taste that is one is to be sipped and savored slowly and respectfully. I've been wanting to try this for a long time and now that I read that it's being discontinued, i'll have to grab another couple of bombers to save for a special occasion. Hopefully, there's still a few left!"
"Thanks, BeerBeing"
"Bottom line: If you see some around your neck of the woods....grab 'em!"
"Bottled 29 Mar 05 Pours a golden copper color, some carbonation, huge head, nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. Scents of hops, citrus, and malts. A very nice taste of grapes, apples, and spices, but sweet with a nice tangy finish. Alcohol content is hiddern very well. Medium body. At 12% ABV very drinkable. Retired? Did I get some of the last batch? If so, not sure If I can get anymore, but it was very enjoyable while it lasted."
"Carbonation is a bit overkill. fizzy and annoying. like frickin pop rocks on the palate."
"edit: Do not drink this whole beer. It will give you a hangover even if nothing else is imbibed. It's best the bomber is poured to a group of people to taste. Happy beering!"
"Cheers!"
"My bottle was dated March 2005."
"bottled aug 27 2004. Poured out an amber thick brew with a 1 finger head. Smells of malt sweetness and alcohol. Taste is pretty sweet with some hoppage lingering with a smooth alcohol burn to it.Pretty strong stuff.Mouthfeel is thick and chewy.All in all a pretty wild brew a lil too strong for more than a once a month thing. I see it says here that this is a retired brew ,, not sure ive seen it recently in the stores ill have to lookinto it"
"drinkability: one 750 and i was done for. maybe i drank it too fast. who knows? all i know is that i got so smashed i accompanied a buddy of mine on a beer run where we partook in a 6 pack of miller lite tallboys. the nite started off so good... what hapened???"
"Although this beer was a little hot, it was a surprisingly drinkable concoction. I am definitely going to sit on the second bomber for a while though. This will be even better when the flavors meld better."
"I saved this for a holiday meal, and enjoyed it immensely with some Smoked Duck in Apricot-Orange Sauce I did that day. It was 20 degrees out, and the V-Twelve made for a wonderful meal that brought my dulled senses back. I am sad to see its retired, but will enjoy the memory."
"I am planning a trip to Victory soon, so if I'm able to get my hands on a fresher bottle I will pick it up and give this another go. All in all an excellent beer."
"Overall very nice interpretation of the style."
"A rare treat to try this gem on tap at the Blind Tiger in lower NYC. This beer thankfully was left over from last weeks allways special , ""very special Keg"" fest at the Tiger. Poured murky mahogony with a slight, but tight tan head. This is a large, bold and strong brew. Notes of vanilla, light raisins. sweet fruity notes, some spice all rolled into a smooth high quality sipper/night capper. Get some and enjoy!"
"D: This is definitely a great beer. Don't know that I could do more than one in a night due to ABV but most definitely something I'm gonna have to clear out from the local distributor seeing as how this puppy's gone forever."
"Overall: A treat of a beer. I recommend doing nothing but smelling V12 for a few minutes before you even bother with taking a drink. Savor this fine American interpretation of a great style. Just watch out for the 12% because it will put you on the floor. Victory!"
"Thanks Len!"
"I'm a sad that this has been retired because this is another great beer by Victory."
"D - This one definitely leaves you wanting more on each sip. A highly drinkable quad. I'll grab another one of these to share with friends sometime if I can still find it."
"For a 3 year old beer this one is wonderful. The flavor, carbonation and alcohol all presented themselves with each sip. I think this beer would do well cellared for even 5 or more years."
"A big, big beer. Brings to mind St. Bernardus Abbot 12. Full-grown, no holding back beer. Probably not for the inexperienced, although my 4-foot-9 wife, who is only recently a craft beer drinker, loved it. Try some."
"I would say this is a great drinkable beer for a quadruple. I highly recommend this beer."
"If this beer was a woman, I would be arrested for stalking. I need me another taste."
"Drinkability: I guess this one just ain't for me. Something seems out of whack and uncomfortable about this beer. The malt profile is nice and spicy and fruity yeat flavors are great too. But the syrupy sweetness and weird mouthfeel just overpower the good things. They're on the right track with this one, but I think it could still use some work. At this point though, I wish I'd had my 8 bucks back."
"Drinkabilty - By far the worst aspect of the beer. My first sips were very good to me. Then our food arrived. I made a big mistake in ignoring the food pairing recommendations, but I really had to try the V-12. I found its character clashed very harshly with my dinner (a bruschetta pizza). The beer actually became very difficult to drink toward the bottom. This is not just a mistake I made however that tainted the rating, its flavor is too overpowering to be paired with almost any food. By itself, it does make a decent desert beer. Even without food pairing problems, at 12 abv the 750mL is a formidable task for anyone."
"[I've been watching my DVD of ""The Office"" while tasting this brew and if any of you Brits can exlpain the Peter Purves/Mr. Noakes joke to me, I'd appreciate it.]"
"March 29, 2005 bottling...extremely charged bottle (at least it didn't gush), huge head of two inches of delicate mousse-like foam on a careful pour. Oxidized nectarine color, tons of rushing bubbles inside the glass. Wide by relatively sparse laces. Nice aroma, spiced apricots, stewed prunes, a bit of a honey quality. Body is about medium, carbonation is sprightly and effervescent. The flavor is too tinged with alcohol, some underlying senses of the apricot of the aroma, bitter orange extract, and slightly scouring hops help -- but the finish is quite bitter and overly hot at the back. Frankly, this one is a bit too much, the nice aroma and generous carbonation are what makes it decently balanced as an overall drink, but it does wind out its carbonation in about half an hour. Maybe this might age to a mellower product."
"Entry is silky smooth with just a touch of carbonation showing on the back of the tongue. Midtaste begins with a brief flash of alcohol closely followed by sugary fruits, burnt malt, and candi sugar. The finish enters with a sharp hop bite followed by a long deep malt fade with the alcohol warming the back of the throat."
"Overall: Erm, not that sure about this one. Hey, its Victory V-12 and I looked forward to cracking this one  but it is not the huge classic brew I was led to believe it was. I also always thought that this would be one to age, but I guess from what I just tasted and witnessed it isnt. Cost $7.99, and given the distance from the source and strength it is not that expensive, but Im not sure I would pop the greenbacks for one of these again. Not bad, but certainly not the great brew many told me it was, it lacks complexity and definition, in fact its a little rough around the edges and worse it suffers from poor carbonation and that annoying orange syrup ending. Drink it fresh once bottled and drink it quickly once poured would be my advice."
"It poured with a semi-frothy white head that utterly disintigrated into wispiness. It was a deep golden/amber color with great clarity. The nose gave off notes of cherries and melon. The drawback for me was the mouthfeel, which was simply way too hot. It also had a nice creaminess to it, but the heat and intensity of the alcohol made it difficult to really tatse much. I tried, believe me, and I will try again, but I think that this is a beer that could do with some maturation time."
"We will preface with the fact that I usually don't like my beer this strong. First sip. Good. Nice. Solid. Second sip. Better. much better. really finishes nicely. Complex, lots to note. Fruit after the malt, sweetness at the end, almost sugery, but not in a bad way. This beverage got better as I drank it, and I don't think it was because it got me drunk. Dcent if not great carbonation, belieing the absence of head, this continued to stimulate after swallowing. At 12%, not a beer to drink all day and night, but I sure could have more of it."
"Pours a transparent burgundyish auburn color. Tons and tons of bubbles sit afloat with a small layer of foam on top. Minimal lacing. Aroma is boozy at first then becomes sweeter and fruitier then ultimately becomes drier with a little sting in there. I'm reminded of the peanut butter and strawberry jam sandwich I had an hour earlier every time I take a whiff. Taste gives me more malty sweetness but hardly any residual sugars. More just of a nice fruity flavor along with a sweet liquer taste. Alcohol esters are there but controlled marvelously. Hops are basically not providing any bitterness but I think they're holding the sweetness back and giving more of a dry fruity flavor and I thank them for giving this beer balance. But the main base flavor is a yeasty sweetness. I don't really know how to describe it but the yeast gives a depth nicely and a little spice. It could still use a little more body and viscosity and maybe more complexity. Finish lingers and lingers. Belly warming. Quite well made and quite enjoyable."
"2002 edition, 750ml corked and caged. Pours with a head about 1/8"" deep that reduces quickly to a thin spread of whitish film. No real viscosity to the deep, pure copper-colored liquid. Smells okay--not too special--like slightly sour apple skins and a vaguely white-winey grapeyness. Cordial notes come through in the finish, like brandy and lemon. The nosefeel is thin, vinous, and cutting with alcohol's cold heat. At first the flavors strike me as being simple. Like, ""hm... fruit."" And then, just as I'm about to stop paying attention, ""fruit"" becomes ""dried apples, mandarin oranges, raisins..."" Fruit, and overflowing baskets of it. Every flavor, from black cherry to banana, is soaked in layers of alcohol and medicine, warming to become bitter like honeyed herbal tea. Fantastically dry mouthfeel, alcoholically thin and warm, evaporates into the tongue but leaves the tastes behind to be savored. Points go to the drinkability just for the sheer polish of it all. Drink with care. After the first half of the bottle I was feeling pretty good. After the second half, I wasn't feeling much of anything at all. Great stuff. It was worth the wait."
"Not going to be able to drink a whole lot of this at a time, but if you see a bottle of this don't deny yourself the absolute pleasure of trying it."
"I had been eyeing this bottle for a while, and finally bought it after a nice 11 hour shift at work. Pours a brilliant copper broown color, with lots of carbonation visible. Head is small, but resilient. Smells fruity and earthy, like a fine belgian ale, with strong wiffs of alcohol. Taste is absolutely intense. Fula dn rich, lots of carbonationa and alcohol to leave your lips and mouth tingling. Funky and sweet, with well calculated hops that blend in and enhance the alcohol in the beer. An absolute ride of a beer, big and ballsy, what I expect from Victory."
"Pours a clear amber-red with an almost non-existent head and very little lacing. Smell is sweet like candied sugar, with some banana, grapefruit, and a litlte alchohol coming through. Taste is wonderful---a big creamy malty flavor dominates There is a surprising light hops presence, along with expected cloves, sweet fruits, and alchohol. This is a thick full bodied beer with a medium/light level of carbonation that works just fine. This is a great tasting beer, and the only thing that lowers its drinkability is the high alcohol which you really start feeling after a bomber."
"I remember not liking this beer. Lets see what another few months have done to it. It pours a bright copper color with a 2-3 finger head that falls to about a finger over top, with a nice bubbly off the bottom that keeps it heady. The nose is raisiney and spicey, with an underlying caramel and brown sugar sweetness and a wisp of alcohol playing underneath it all. Not too shabby. The flavor is pretty nice. I get a rum-soaked raisins, brown sugar sweetness, spiceyness and alcohol that play very well together. I even get a touch of orange citrusyness in there. The brew is moderately thick, with a slight syrupyness to it. It is very warming in the stomach and esophagus. I find this to be very easy to quaff for a 12% alcohol beer. My mind has been changed about this brew. Its pretty nice if you ask me."
"This was a very nice treat, but at 12% abv it's tough to have more than one or two glasses. A quad to be shared."
"The head is a ring now and the beer is a beautiful clear copper. The next taste nets a slight tartness that moves into sweet. This beer has a lot going on. It is very drinkable now. I couldn't think it could become more beguiling with more age. I will buy more to share. It will close a meal well."
"I would drink it again, but I prefer Golden Monkey."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Very faint odor; just a touch of caramel. First taste is delicious! Quite a sweet, candy sugar flavor, a taste of raisins, caramel and yeast. For a 12% ABV, the alcohol is extremely well hidden; I barely got a hint of it. An incredibly drinkable beer; I'd have to say preferable to some of the higher rated Quadrupels I've had in the past."
"Drinkability and Overall: Though I never had this fresh, I think time has already crafted this beer wonderfully. It's smooth, rich, complex, and incredibly drinkable. This is a great American take on the Quad."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. 2002 on cork, bottled on Mar 11 03 on bottle."
"All and all I would drink this again, and plan to purchase one if they have them next time I'm at Victory. Next time I plan to cellar it quite a bit longer though."
"Comments  A huge thanks to GeoffFromSJ for sending me this gem from one of my favorite breweries. I had this to celebrate a new job that Im starting on Monday. Cheers to BA!"
"The label states V-12 should be enjoyable up to five years from the date bottled. IMO it is barely hanging on at two, surprising considering the 12% ABV. I cared for the bottle well and doubt it was an ""off"" bottle. It didn't taste wrong, it just didn't taste like much of anything. If you have one (or more) cellared, you might want to try it now rather than wait."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The mouthfeel is crisp at the start and finish. Alcohol and yeast ride the tongue long after swallowing. Medium / heavy body. Quite a tasty and nicely drinkable quadruple. The more it warmed, the flavors really came out."
"Nice, though I don't think I'd call this a Belgian style quad. Pours a reddish/copper color with a minimal tan head and little carbonation. The first taste is spicey, hint of orange, malts, and a semi dry finish. Once the taste buds adjust this brew smooths out a lot. It still is spicey, but with a more sweeter, fruity/malt start and finish. The 12 abv doesn't overpower you at all. Kind of reminds me of a Unibroue Maudite without the carbonation and with a heavier body. Goes down very easy for a 12 abv. Good one to keep around to take the edge off of a tough day."
"Beautiful, pleasant surprise from Victory. This is a keeper."
"Actually I am quite disappointed in this beer, it is not quite Belgian enough, not quite enough complexity. This is a nice tasting beer, it is just a bit simplistic, though I should give it some credit for being so smooth and drinkable despite the 12% alcohol. This is definitely not something that I can finish a full 750 of though, so be warned this should be shared with friends."
"tasted side by side with old horizontal just to reaffirm my taste suspicions. confirmed. similar, but v-12 lacks the bite and bitterness. what a great beer and it will surely age well. grab a few and throw them in the cellar (but get one to drink now!)"
"This offering was bottled on 24 August 2004. Poured a nice reddish amberish color with a slight head that vanished as fast as it came and left no lacing at all. The smell is of candy, fruits, and some alcohol. The taste is excellent. Fruit sweetness, a touch of alcohol and finishes with some lingering sweetness and a touch of hops spicyness. The mouthfeel was very nice. Smooth, nicely carbonated, but a touch thin, but still good. I would drink this one again, after it ages a bit."
"Reviewed from a 750ml bottle on 12/29/04. Date bottled was August 27, 2004. Pours out a fairly clear amber color with a slight tan fizzy head that disappears quickly. No lace was left on the glass. Aroma was a light fruitiness mixed with sweet malts and a touch of spice. Unfortunately the alcohol was very evident in the aroma and came to dominate as it warmed. Sweet malt, a light spiciness and ripe fruits seem to be battling with the huge alcohol here in the taste. At first the strong alcohol was noticeable but as it warmed the alcohol makes this one pretty hard to finish. It didnt seem like it was an off bottle, just that the alcohol was way to dominate. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I would expect with a big warmth due to the alcohol. Drinkability was ok but hindered by the alcohol. I will probably give this one another chance in the future."
"Overall, this is a very nice quadrupel. Very warming and soothing on a cold, blustery winter's night. Quite drinkable, in fact, considering the high ABV. This one really hit the spot."
"Bottled on 3/11/2003. Oddly, cork dated 2002. Pours a pale copper with a fizzy off-white head that dies down quickly. Aromas of toasty malts and candi sugar, some further biscuity suggestions, light fruitiness and fusel alcohols. Well, if this doesn't warm you up on a cold winter's night, you may well be cold-blooded. Malty, sweet and thick; chockful of fruity esters and alcohol notes, undercurrents of clove, cocoa and sulfites. Warming and numbing to the esophagus. A year and a half in the cellar has mellowed the carbonation pretty good. I remembered it being a little too spritzy for the style. It's better in the warmer stages of the beer, and the brewers at Victory recommend decanting carefully as to leave the yeast behind. Good job guys!"
"Drinkable masterpiece. A work of art in great malts and hops and yeast. Tasty orange and peach flavour with faint cloves and other spices. Somewhat complex on the taste buds. Good mouthfeel. Up there with Top Belgiums I have had. Great for a freezing cold day's supper."
"At 12%, it's not one to drink solo (though I am). Get a friend and share a bottle. Excellent brew, as always from the Victory folks."
"WIth the pop of the cork, she opens. Pours a light amber with slight reddish tones and a soft light tan head. Slightly sour, geuzish nose. Unexpected, but nice, intriguing nose. Slightly musty, with candy and estery palate. Alcohol slightly warms the finish. Flavorful mouthfeel, but not too heavy. Again, the alcohol adds warmth and viscosity. A very interesting brew. Not sure how to catagorize it. Drinkable, even with the high ABV. Glad I got to try this one. Inticing and inviting. Definately worth a try if you find it."
"Nice burgandy tone. Clear. CO2 bubbles accelerate rapidly to the voluptuous crown of white foam on top. The head has great retention and leaves bountiful lace. Aroma blends candy tones, sweet-bread, doughy yeastiness and lemon pepper. The taste is reminiscent of some of the finer Beligian style brews I've had. Sweet candy tones and yeast dominate the profile....and nicely so. Raisin, fig and rum soaked cedar come into play as well. The heat from this 12% bad boy is really held in check on the palate and interplays nicely with everything else that is going on. I'm catching some fruits as well: melon (maybe watermelon), cantelope, etc. The mouthfeel is close to silk. The beer kind of melts away in the mouth like cotton candy. Superb. This is one beautiful beer."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with fruity Belgian yeast esters. The taste is great. It has an extremely smooth and rich malty flavor that goes down easy and warms on the finish. It has a complex malt palate along with hops in the aftertaste; very nice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good Belgian ale. It has awesome flavor and aroma; a great drinker."
"750mL bottle. Pours an amber color with a moderate head that dies off quickly. The aroma was dark fruits, sweetness, caramel, and alcohol. Promising aroma there. The flavor is dominated by a sweet fruityness that I really enjoyed. Caramel malts and some other sweet malts. Very strong alcohol in the taste. It could use some age to let that mellow, but it's still a wonderful beer."
"Also, i've had previous vintages that were aged longer. my favorite being an 02 that aged over a year. The bitterness i mentioned above was not present and the fruityness was much much stronger. Leave this in the cellar to mature and it will be much more satisfying especially if you're saving it for a special occassion. Victory says it should survive a cellar for about 5 years."
"Impressive after only 12 months of cellaring."
"Poured a dark amber with a golden head that fizzed fast and settled quickly. Immediately hints of spices in the aroma like alot of other quads. Obviously tastes like cloves to me, same as a previous reviewer stated. Alcohol is present in the taste but not so much as to detract from the enjoyment of this sipping beer. I like this alot compared to other domestic quads."
"I picked up a bottle of this beer on a visit to their brewery. This beer poured an orangey amber color. Moderate head which slowly dissipated. Smell reminded me of wine. I also detected the aroma of spices such as cloves and a faint wheat scent. Tasting this beer is definitely an experience. It is very sweet and fruity. It is reminiscent of warm cider or gingerbread because of its spiciness. The whole effect covers the tongue like a nice winter coat. Don't get me wrong, this a wonderful beer, but it is not for the faint of heart. In fact, be prepared to take a nap after this one!"
"Brew poured a rich muddy-amber into a challice. Nice color, some carbonation (and a bit of cork from the opening). Nice smell - fairly sweet, some malt backbone. A nice nuttyness to it. Taste was very pleasent and extremely smooth, very much like an extremely good belgian brown. Some nutty and vanilia notes in the tasteing. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good, after its time in the bottle the beer was very, very smooth and could have easliy been quaffed, had I not had a deep respect for a $10 bottle of brew!"
"Picked up a bottle in Feb. 2005 to celebrate the upcoming Eagles Super Bowl championship, which didn't happen. Turns out the bottle was from 5/15/03. Looks the same, smells the same. Flavor seems very balanced with some light fruity esters, a bit of malt, some yeasty goodness, and a pinch of alcohol. Light, soft and fizzy feel."
"Pours a slightly cloudy medium amber color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with a hint of alcohol as well. The taste is also fairly sweet and malty with some white grape in there too, but there's lots and lots of alcohol burning through. Too much of an alcohol flavor present. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability suffers due to the unhidden alcohol. This has been aging for a while, and it looks like it could use a few more years."
"Drinkability: Maybe I'm just getting used to big beers but truly this one masks the alcohol amazingly. Easy to drink!"
"Bottled 3/11/03. Despite the gushing bottle, pouring yields a modest one fingered head cream white with respectable retention. Sparse lace. Black licorice with notions of candied almonds and marzipan upfront in aroma, along with persistent hot, solvent twanged fusels. Mellows slightly and deepens in complexity as it breathes, with ginger snap and dark toffee hints arising. Enticing, but noticeably alcoholic aromawise. In flavor, perceived incipiently is an nutty, but boozy impression of bourbon soaked brittle and whiskey macerated dried dates. Subtleties surface after a deliberation as the beer oxidizes. These include hints of herbal, clove themed phenols, bubblegum esters and ripe fig undertones, all wrapped in an ethanol laden, middling quality liquor blanket. Distinct malt and / or sugar derived character is subdued, with deep, but integral dark caramel notes provided by both caramalt and perhaps dark candi sugar. Moderate in body, with a viscosity that is both ethanol and dextrin induced. Surprisingly, the carbonation level is perfect. Usually a gushing bottle is noticeably overcarbed. Finishes with a searing ethanol snap yielding to drying, albeit slightly astringent bitterness. Quite the intense brew, and is overtly boozy even after over a year of cellaring. Certainly not short on flavor. Tasty, but brambly."
"Yeast, sugar and insane amounts of alcohol. Well balanced, but you definitely need to sip this one."
"The flavor was just amazing...spicy with a hint of coriander...sweet to a fault perhaps but still delicious. The one thing that struck me (literally) was the alcohol. Yes, this beer is 12%. However, the alcohol is not dominant. It is, however, dominant in effect. However, the flavor is such that the tastiness makes it so very drinkable."
"very drinkable, i went right out and got the last one they had and am letting it age for the winter...we'll see what happnes to this one over a bit more time, although it was bottled in march of 03 so it has already had some time to age"
"It pours a copper with a nice, soft head. It is perfumy/flowery spice in aroma. The body is gig and the palate seems slick. It has some fruity esters and a touch of alochol. It finishes dry and spicy. A very nice beer. I'm glad that I cellared some. I can't wait to see what it will be like."
"MMM..mmm the 2002 edition. Nice beer, you need to work this brew, but this is a nice, solid victory brew. Pours a nice, solid dark amber color. It has a semi-creamy head, and a nice solid lacing all the way down. It has a sweet, fruity, and sublty complex malty flavor to it. While there is a balanced hop after-taste, I feel the over whelming flavor is a sweet fruity malt.The hops are there, but it is a more barely-wine style belgian condiment to the malt then anything else. It its a well-blanced all around good beer, and, despite the strong taste to it, has a nice depth and balance then most others. well played indeed."
"A nice brew yet again from the folks at Victory this one being my last straight from the brewery as I am now stuck in missouri and away from all the great NE beers."
"Very smooth but still heavy in the mouth. This is amazingly complex and a phenomenal ale."
"Thanks to beerluvr for this beauty."
"2002 750ml bottle: High expectations for this beer. A good ""POP"" from the cork when it was pulled. It pours a slightly orangish color. Some head, but it dissapates quickly. Sweet nose of caramel, fruit and yeast. Taste is sweet, with fruits, as well as some caramel. A hint of sourness. The first taste was very good, and it got better from there. A fabulous brew. A great way to watch the snow fall!"
"I really like this beer. This is one I should have bought a case of in the spring. Victory makes many solid beers, and this is definitely one of them. I will be checking out the rest of the future V series offerings. If you have any of this, feel special. If you see any, buy it without hesitation. Fantastic stuff."
"This is my first Victory, so I didn't have a clue what to expect. The label says Belgian inspired ale, but I don't get the connection with this big boy. Syrupy sweet fruitiness dominates. Too sweet for my palate. Maybe this one will improve with age, but I'm not impressed overall."
"2002 Vintage corked 750ml. Initial pour quite fizzy and sounding like the ocean. Nice amber colored and clear but with no head. Seems highly carbonated. Spicy fruity aroma with noticible alcohol. Very sharp mouthfeel and a warming effect from alcohol.Flavor is malty and fruity with a hint of caramel. Overall not a bad offering. Just a bit too fizzy for the style in my opinion. Also little retention in this one."
"Thanks to jcalbi for providing!"
"Got a bottle that had an old cork in it i.e. was bottled on March 11 2003 but the cork was dated 2002 and as such was the first time ive seen this happen. Smelled of grain that had been soaked in alcohol with a slight breadiness. Tasted good with a slight kirschwasser on the rocks flavor followed along a slighty sweet malt suger flavor no hops at all to speak of. Mouthfull isnt all that full but the alcohol which is highly noticable makes it a tad thicker to throw back. Drinkability wise this beer is good for the 750 and you wont want to have much else unless your drunkard."
"Hmmm, Im not quite sure what to think of this one yet. Lemme thinkabout it a few minutes. Until then, it pours a nice burn orange color with a bubbly white head that fades away quickly. Theres a large amount of fine little carbonation bubbles just fizzing away in the glass. The aroma is very complex, each time I take a whiff, and I smell something different. The first aroma is a mild and sweet yeast bread followed by a hint of citrus fruit. Upon the second smell, I picked up a mixture of caramel and candied yams. All of the aromas were intermixed with a perfect medley of alcohol and sweet malt. Upon first tasting the alcohol makes its presence well known, theres nothing subtle about it, its extremely warming as it flows down my esophagus into my belly. The follow-on flavors were a very nice balance of spicy coriander sweet toasted malts, and just a hint of brown sugar. The mouthfeel is very nice. Its very well balanced. The only downfall is the high carbonation level tends to disturb my tongue from picking up a lot of the flavors that I detected with my nose. This is definitely an absolutely wonderful brew from the folks at Victory. I could definitely see myself buying this one again and again. Yep, I absolutely love this beer"
"burnt orange color w/ a very sweet flavor, this is a sipping beer. In my opinion, to enjoy this beer, you have to be in the mood to sit back and take your time w/ it."
"I'd been looking forward to trying the V-12, and it may have disappointed a little, but it wasn't terrible. I think a little more aging could make this a tremendous treat."
"This beer poured into the glass a golden amber color that was clear but yeast was present that became more noticeable and turned the clear into a haze by the end of the glass. It produced a white foamy head that seemed to come and go fairly fast, leaving a light ring on the edges of the liquid. No lace present. Decent carbonation. The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh hops, pine needles, wood, lots of fruit (apples, pears, sugar coated berries), sweet malt, warming alcohol, yeast, candy sugar, and a hint of spices (pepper, fresh cilantro). Moderately sweet aroma mixed with a warming alcohol made the aroma a very good experience. I liked this beer already, and didn’t even take a sip as of yet. As I took my first sip I noticed sweet malts and sugars first as it eased into the other flavors that were all warmed by the warmth of alcohol. Flavors of sweet fruit (berries, apples, some citrus tones), fresh hops, some floral hops, spices (fresh cilantro, pepper –white and green), pine, some barrel wood (aging barrel - bourbon), and yeast all blended very well together. Medium bodied. Good balance of flavors. Complex and easy to drink, I was surprised d/t the alcohol content and the age. I rather enjoyed the sweet qualities of this beer though. With time this beer will only become better, smoother, more complex as the flavors meld together and balance each other out even more. Glad I have one in the cellar aging."
"This is good but I don't dabble in Belgians too much. I find Victory to be making quite good beers and decided to give this a shot. I don't like this style of beer but they seemed to hit it right on. The alcohol is strong and very prevalant throughout. The sweetness is overwhelming but par for the course I think. The interesting thing about this beer is that it is quite drinkable. I find this style to be hard to drink but this has enough consistency and very little imperfections that make it easy to drink. Don't get me wrong, there is some burn but it is good."
"This one is middling in its drinkability. At 12%, it's hard to expect a well-hidden abv. And in this case, the alcohol drives the sweetness past interesting and into overwhelming. This could really benefit from toning that alcoholic flavor back just a couple notches."
"After a dissappointing V-10, Victory seems to be back on tract. Pours with a nice amber color with a head that disappears quickly. The aroma is fruity and yeasty, The taste is the same with some alcohol as well). With a beer this drinkable it would be wise to be carefull. At 12% alcohol, this is a powerful beer."
"I could drink this beer every day, but alas, I have only one bottle left. Anyone want to take bets as to how long it lasts?"
"Drinkability: While 'drinkable' isn't the first word this beer calls to mind due to it's strength, it is quite a tasty Belgian-style ale. I wish I could get a few bottles to cellar until the holiday season, but this one is sadly not available in the Midwest. What a shame...I'd love to see what a bit of aging would do to it."
"At 12% abv, this one's a powerhouse. Careful, 'cause it goes down easy! Probably best shared with a friend or loved one. My only gripe would be the sweetness - a bit too sugary. As this one seems to get better with time in just one sitting, I'd like to cellar one for a few years and see how it matures. Another fine offering from Victory!"
"-F"
"Pours a brilliant reddish orange with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is sweet malts and fruit (mainly apricots) with a whiff of alcohol. This is a big beer with big flavors. Initial impression is of an over the top belgian yeastiness with some candy sugar and loads of fruitiness. V-12 doesn't pretend to hide the alcohol either. A nice burn with every sip. Subtle piney hops are there to subdue the sweetness. This is a nice evening sipping beer. A fine brew from Victory, just not as complex and sophisticated as the top Belgians."
"I have been anticipating the sampling of this beer for some time now, I just wish that I wouldn't have. Sometimes I think you can build up a beer so much in your head sometimes that there are preconcieved notions of how the beer should be. Here are my notes from a bottle I split with a friend at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. Appears a copper amber with a full white head in my goblet. Flavor is a rolling malt barrage with hints of hops and one very pleasant yeast profile of spiced up notes. Some fruit tones wrapped in candied sugar. Mouthfeel is full with buttery tones and this beer is warming with a good amount of carbonation. The only thing that keeps this beer from becoming a session beer other than the price tag is the 12 % alcohol. I liked and enjoyed but I wasn't overly impressed definitely will try again."
"This is very light, like a pale ale. Pours a creamy, thin head. Not much to say for the aroma. Not much there, but mostly sweet smelling, and a little medicinal. Tasty, but sweet, (I mean sugary sweet) and also very strong. Some berry flavors, too. The sugar feel and alcohol taste dominate."
"Pours a medium copper in color, medium off-white head, quickly diminishes to minimal lacing. Some small particles float about in the body, dodging the medium sized carbonation bubbles that are making their way to the top. Aroma is banana, spices, light hints of alcohol, apple, pinepple. Flavor is quite sweet, lots of fruits, some spicyness. Body is quite full, tons of different flavors come through, and get stronger and more plentiful as the brew warms. Quite good now, and will most likely get better as it sits a while."
"rusty copper brown with a minimal head. aroma is of belgian yeast and candied fruits. minimal carbonation lends a full, lucious mouthfeel. tastes initially fruity followed by a cutting dryness from the hops. alcohol taste is non-existent, but a warming in the belly begins within a few sips. fuller and smoother than V-10, this beer tastes ready to go at only about 6 weeks from bottling. aging should do nothing but improve it's characteristics. this is the best stab at a belgian style victory has attempted. excellent."
"Pours a medium brown, mahagony color with a fine, whispy head. Alcohol and esters are strong in the aroma. An aromatic beer, with smells of wood and pine, and an occationally leather. First taste is very malty and slightly medicinal...and you can almost taste the sugar. The taste of rasins is in there too. A little oily. A pleasing alcohol warming hits you right away....too much of this would hit you hard. It's very good, but not outstanding for the style."

"Sweet cotton candy nose with a pinkish red color. Orginally on the pour you get a nice white head but this does not last long due to the ABV. You are left with a little puff of white in the center of the goblet as you drink. Sweet aromatic flower hot taste along with corriander. Wonderfully floral taste. This is a kicked up sippin' American/Belgian style brew! And it will only get better in my cellar!"
"Bottom Line: If Churchill had this instead of his beloved Pol Roger, his “V for Victory” hand-signal might have meant something else!"
"Pours with a minimal, barely off-white head that settles over slightly yeast-hazy russet/golden liquid. The nose is super fruity with a subdued Belgian horse blanket aroma with sweet, sweet maltiness. Taste is big on fruitiness, with initial notes of banana, malt, spice and a decent hopping, followed by a warming alcohol stance. Finish is fruity, sticky, alcoholic and bitter...all of the things I love in a good ale! A bit young and brash, good drinking now, cellaring can only improve upon the previously described flavor attributes."
"I wanted to go catch the hockey game. Good beer, and a good game, the perfect evening."
"The complexity of this beer is incredible. It has a great deal of hops, yet they are well balanced by malts. It has a very crisp mouthfeel at the start, and it then gradually smoothes out and lets every little flavor hit your tongue like silk. Breads, and a hint of roasty malts come in at the finish. This beer really is 12%, but you will have no idea until you finish it. I picked up one little sip where I could barely catch the alcohol sneaking in. Victory did one amazing job with this brew."
"Amazing tasting beer! So light, and dare I say, refreshing (?) at 12%. Smooth, light bubbly mouthfeel. Loads of hops with subtle undertones of yeast and citrus fruits. There is surprisingly little notice of alcohol, but oh you will know it's 12% when the bottle's gone. I definitely need to grab a bottle of this to let sit and enjoy a few months down the road. Seek out and find, and get 2...one for now and one for later."
"750 ml. corked and caged bottle and man, did I have a time getting that cork out. I see Victory does not want to repeat corking errors found in the V 10. Anyway, this beer's appearance is a quite clear and lustrous red orange. Small head fades quickly and nose reveals big malt and fruity esters. Whoo boy! This stuff is a bit young. Remarkably sweet upfront and bitter hops are undetectable, which is no surprise. I believe the hops are there and lend to a smooth finish and somewhat cut the cloying sweetness. The nice fruity characteristics found in the nose are found in force in the flavor. Not bad. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy with small carbonation. Alcohol is there and makes its presence known first on the palate then later in the head. Good creeper beer. A little age behind this bad boy and I see it being much better."
"750 ml bottle, corked & caged. The year is on printed on the cork. The body is a surprisingly clear, very deep amber/orange with glowing highlights. Tiny bubbles rise in steady streams to the creamy white head. It's short-lived, but it probably just needs some conditioning. The aroma is malty and fruity with a very light spiciness. The body is firmly medium with a very fine carbonation that tingles the tongue before becoming creamy in the mouth. Smooth and malty! The flavor delivers a very rich, sweet, and fruity (both light and dark) malt that's well-balanced by underlying bitterness and yeasty spiciness. Some alcohol is clearly present, but it's not overbearing and should mellow with some cellaring. Rich! Supple! Excellent! 6 months of aging will do wonders for this beer. Absolutely worth seeking out. Buy it now and put it away for special occassions! It should be quite nice in time for Thanksgiving, and will make an excellent after-dinner drink shared with good friends!"
