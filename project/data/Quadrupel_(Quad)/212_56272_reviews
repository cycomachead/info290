"Flavour is not very alcoholic, rather sweet, correlating with the smell, fantastic balance of the beer, surprising drinkability, considering ABV. Aftertaste is not very long, but actually good in those pleasant moments."
"eh, its ""a'ight"". not amazing."
"I am neutral on this beer."
"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/29/2013. Pours clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a spotty cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, date, red grape, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Outstanding aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, red grape, date, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, clove, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, red grape, date, cherry, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, clove, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming lingering after the finish; but not boozy at all. Overall this is an outstanding quadrupel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Similar flavor profile to Kasteel Winter, with the toffee and raisin, only a lot more alcohol burn. Aroma predominantly recalls a dirty urinal, thankfully it is pretty faint and blasted by alcohol as it warms. Not a bad beer, but I can do better at this price point."

"Boozy and not enough carbonation for my liking."
"Those the toasted malts arrive in the taste punctuated by a vibrant but tart cherry flavor. Mellow on the palate. Lingers dryly at the finish but like a wine sort of dry.  Easy to drink.  I would have more of these."
"Pours a cloudy, brown.  1/6 inch head of an off-white color.  Poor lacing and poor retention.  Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and yeast.  Fits the style of a Quadruple.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  There is also a high level of astringency.  Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, strong yeast, hint of toffee, and slight metallic.  Overall, poor appearance, and the astringency and metallic notes are unpleasant."

"Killer quad."
""
""
""

"Darker than expected with an appealing nose. Rich in the tongue, with afternotes of fruit and molasses. Incredibly smooth for a quad, this beer goes down too easily. A pleasure to drink, and I look forward to the next visit."

"OMG. Open the bottle and the aroma hits you in the face. Don’t pour inclined into the glass. Pour it like a wine. Nice head becomes a thin film but it doesn’t fade. Dark brown, almost black, see through. Aroma of a giant chunky banana, raisins, some chocolate, liquid bread, a tiny bit floral. Medium body, low carbonation, fruity on top, explosion of flavors in the middle, alcoholic at the end."
""
""
"O: The most fruity quad I've had, with lots of cherries and dark dried fruit. Less alcohol in both the nose and mouth than what I expected. While less complex than other quads, this is extremely enjoyable and I would definitely seek out again."
""
""
"The flavor on the finish is a bit lacking with a lighter medium mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Doesn’t throw like 11% at all. Deep, faceted, BSDA. Sweetness kept in check by spice. A blue cheese beer."
""
"Price Point - $10.99/750ML bottle"
""
""
"O: Top notch! Lush and full of aged fruit flavors. Natural essence to balance the sweetness. I want another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good beer that goes in many directions, but it's all done very tastefully. My expectations for something tart were slightly misleading, as this beer remains true to its quad roots on the tongue."

"Encountered this delicacy on draft at Philadelphia's Monk's Cafe. It's a deep, deep ruby red, translucent only at the edges, capped by a rich, but thin, layer of foam. Attractive, viscous cling. There's an undeniable blast of alcohol at the first sip, but it recedes into a mellow medley of dark fruits and roasted grains, long on raIsins and dates. This is a substantial and rewarding elixir, its sweetness and enveloping texture balanced by a volatile finish and slight alcohol sting. It lasts."
""
""
"Overall 4.25: What can I say? This is a challenging, complex beer. If you are looking for something to go with your ""roasted wild boar shank with sherry reduction and Shiitake mushroom risotto"" LOOK ELSEWHERE. This beer is all about sipping, enjoying and focusing on the beer. The brew, the amazing tastes that come from barley malt, hops and water, that's what this baby is all about. This beer will make you want to understand what is going on with it. To hold its ""hand"" and comprehend it. What does it want? What do we all want? Wow. Highly recommended. Did I mention the 11% ABV? Can't detect it. In the taste, anyway. ;)"
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a foamy (1/2) and smooth (1/2) mouthfeel that's a bit underwhelming for the beer; for the style it's in an acceptable place. Ethanol is readily felt on the palate and back of throat as fairly obvious burning, and in the nostrils as a notable warming sensation: not subtle or pleasant. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness remaining on the palate and lips."
""
""
"O: I would say, aside from the bitterness, it was barely distinguishable from the ""Donker"". If it qualifies as a Quadrupel, it doesn’t quite hit the heights others do."

"Very dense and caramelized flavors with a thick and sugary body. This drinks very elegant. The finish really shines due to the swift and spicy dryness. I haven't had this fresh but this is drinking excellent for the year. Lots of spicy malt laced with sugary fruit. I picture myself drinking this in a tux with a cuban cigar after dinner. Really glad I cracked this. I just wish I had another one to hold onto for a few more years."
""
"O: This one didn't completely work for me. It was just too vinegary. I found that sour alkaline finish acrid. It did soften up a bit as it sat and I liked many of the other qualities of the flavor profile like the thick prune notes, but I won't be rushing back to cuvée du chateau."
""
""
""
""
"overall - excellent"
"Really enjoyed it: this sort of brew is one of the reasons I love going to Belgium so much!"
""
""
"Overall: this beer is a bit on the hot side, at least in the aftertaste, but I like the dark fruit composition. Beers of this style don't have to work too hard to be pretty tasty to me; still, this guy is worth a shot if you like the style."
"Heavenly beer."

"The taste is sweet with the port taste also present. The berries and tartness remind me of lacto or brett? The beer is sweet, but light in a way, it is drinkable, and not cloying at one point. The first sip I suspected artificial sweeteners but this beer is the best beer from this brewery."
""
""
"some more residual sugars would have helped a lot, the finish is just too much on the dry side for a dark, fruity belgian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Not the best of the style, but the style is the best of beer. Good aroma, Good flavor, average mouthfeel. Just nothing that reallys stands up and makes you say Wow."
""
""
""
"The aroma comes off aggresive, but the taste is more comforting to approach. Sweet with a slight semi-tartness. The flavors of cherries, red grapes, dates, and bread crust make their mark. A moderate dose of alcohol makes its presence, especially when the beer goes down and warms your throat and tummy. Its a full bodied beer with low-medium carbonation, drinks slow but steady, and is an adequte example of the quadruppel."
"Gosh I love a good quad, and this is a good quad. For big, robust, complex flavors, they just cannot be beat. This one has all the attributes I look for: sweet dark fruit, big bready malt, that Belgian yeast flavor that always reminds me of puff pastry, and port-like on the palate. It's not the best quad I've ever had, but it is awfully good. It's like munching on spiced holiday cookies that have been soaked in mulled wine. Recommended."
"O - This is a good beer and a big beer. Went well with Thanksgiving dinner."
""
"The sharp, bright and zesty citrus-like qualities of Cuvée Du Chateau make this a memorable quadrupel in my book. Just when I thought I had this style figured out, I get thrown a curveball…and a uniquely delicious one at that."
""
""
""
"Really great beer."

"Delicious dark Belgian ale, good balance of flavors. The strength makes it a sipper. Very enjoyable, though, and I could have this again and again."

"{revised with March 2013 tasting of 2011 bottle}"
"D - Nice stuff, but not particularly mind-blowing or distinct from a number of other quads. I like the 'pre-aged' element of this beer as it cuts out some of the harsh alcohol and phenols I get from fresh quads - not sure how this is done, but it's a nifty idea. Easily the best thing I've had from Van Honsebrouck, but that's kind of faint praise."
""
"Bottle at Stubbies in Gainesville. Pours very dark with slight head. Heavy alcohol smell mixed in with plums and raisins. Maybe some pear. Definitely lets you know it is 11%, but this does not overpower the complex prune-chocolate combo that bursts on the palate. Nice sweetness, molasses, candy sugar. Felt it going to my head after just one. A must try for Quad fans. This one should be talked about more."
"A: For me, this is overly sweet though complicated that I can hardly finish a bottle myself! It's more like personal preference I suppose..."
"Drinkability is dangerously high. This is a fantastic beer. Absolutely world class; it may have equals, but is unsurpassable."
""
"O: This is definitely not a beer wimps. It's big, strong and forceful. It's also well made and totally drinkable."
"Overall, a nice quad that hides the alcohol flavor fairly well. Not as complex as I had figured but the vinous character is interesting and helps the body not seem so heavy."
"Getting past the notion that Belgian ales must provide the effervescent champagne-like dryness and evaporating candish sweetness; a savory sipping beer can be every bit as complex and satisfying to the stomach and taste buds. Honsebrouck has proved this with their time honored Kasteel Donker, but really showcases the phenomenon with Cuvee du Chateau."
""
""
"Overall: A nice quad, easily drinkable. Not in my top 5 quads, but still very good."
"I think I paid $4.99 (Total Wine and More) for this beer and it was worth every penny. I could easily see this going for $8-10 on tap and I'd gladly pay it."
""
"Nice quad. Very smooth. Colorful flavor. Enjoyed this vintage immensely. 4.0"
""
""
""
"O) Not port like, similar to most quads, but an excellent beer."
""
"O: Pleasant aromas, but it could be better balanced."
""
"Bottle at Volo, served way too cold ininitally. So much better as it warmed with grapey aroma and winey rich, dark coloured body A good barleywine, and a real wine substitute. That kasteel flavour. Alcohol well hidden. Almost no retained head.Above average mouthfeel."
""
"O: Heavy not easily drinkable beer, but tasteful and fairly complex."
""
""
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Pours a murky caramel brown color under a sparse head. Complex aroma blend of dark fruit, perhaps fig or prune, cherry, oak and dare I say, somewhat similar to that of a robust port wine. Intensely rich dark roasted bready caramel sweet mouthfeel dominates with flavors foretold in the aroma. As brew warms, flavors become more pronounced and buddy-buddy with my palate. Very nice brew..."
""
""
""
""
"O- Better than the sum of its parts. While this certainly isn't an everyday beer, it is excellent on a cold dark night. While I think it's pretty solid right now, a few years would do this beer wonders. I anticipate in another 4-6 years this will be flat out phenomenal. If you're a fan of the style, it's certainly worth trying. Especially at the excellent price of $9 for a 750 mL."
""
"Well done in all dimensions, not a brew for daily drink but perfect for special occasion and time."
"Overall not bad, there are plenty better Belgian quads out there, but this is decent all things considered. Most other Kasteel beers I've had were also better."
""
"O - I had decently high hopes for this when I found it at my specialty liquor store. I was more than disappointed. I'm not impressed with it, especially because it's a quadrupel. The flavors don't seem to harmonize with each other. It's not awful, but I can't find a lot of redeeming qualities in it. Quads are one of my favorite styles and I was disappointed in it."
""
""
""
"O - This is a real nice to drink evening warmer."
"Bottle from Half Time poured a clear reddish brown with a small lasting tan head. Aromas of toffee, plum, dates and yeast. Mouthfeel was medsium to full bodied and smooth. Flavors of toffee, cola, dark fruit and yeast with a smooth lingering cola finish."
""
"If this beer tasted more like it smelled, it would be a much better offering. Maybe a year or two of aging would really work wonders for this one."

"NOTE: Bottled on 7/14/2010"
"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a strong zesty spice presence up front that lingers over a chewy, roasted malt character and estery dark fruits into a slightly dry finish. There's a nice balance of pepper, medicinal syrup, chocolate cake, lightly roasted coffee, plum, raisin and grape. Fuller bodied with a much stronger malt presence than I expected. Also, the high ABV is excellently masked resulting in a flavorful beer that's easy to put down."

"good, but id like to see how their donker is."

"Poured a dark mahogany color with a small cap of off-white head. Caramel and brown sugar in the nose, lots of dark, dried fruit; decent aroma but not too pronounced. The taste follows the nose for the most part, with dark caramel, honey, brown sugar, plums, raisins, figs, black cherries, and a subtle hint of cocoa in the background. Actually a bit similar to Kasteel Rouge in some ways, but a bit more complex array of flavors. Thick in the mouth, heavy-medium body, kind of syrupy, low carbonation, and a definite alcohol warmth that balances out the thickness a bit. Quite enjoyable, and I'd like to sample it again."
"Drinkabiliy : good beer in the belgian style; but too sweet for my taste"
"O-For the price this is not a bad beer, I will drink it again for sure."
"O: A decent beer to have with dark meat, like burgers, steak, ribs, that kind of thing. I'm going to have a cheese steak in an hour, and I probably should have cooked it earlier; it would have paired nicely. Good health to you."
"When I heard of this, that it is brewed to resemble the flavor of an aged Kasteel Donker, I wondered first how you would do that, and then, if you could, why not make that the original beer? I don't have answers for any of those questions, all I can say is that they did it, and it's wonderful. A lovely, spiked plum pudding of a brew, a laced liquid licorice whip, and a toasty, tasty, caramel and toffee confection rolling happily in the mouth, all in one. And all very mellow, very groovy..."
"2010 edition. Corked and caged bottle, opens with a resounding pop. Poured into oversized wine glasses, a rich deep amber/mahogony hue with an off white dense head that recedes away over time. Aroma is fruity, bready, a touch of alcohol, dark fruits and brown sugar. In the taste, ripe grape, raisen, and plum but mostly grape. Alcohol is well in check and stays in the background. Pleasing dark fruits, some malt body lending caramel and brown sugar notes. Damn tasty. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and effervescent, semi-dry on the finish. Overall, a really nice beer, great flavors, clean and has the potential to age quite well."
"D/O: Drinkability is reasonably good, here. It's just a touch too sweet to be ""exceptional", for my taste. Overall a very good beer, though. I really like the beers that this brewery puts out."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a quite large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of candi sugar and Belgian malt with light fruity ester is quite nice. Taste is also a generous mix between some candi sugar with balanced Belgian malt and notes of fruity ester. Body is quite full with nice bottle conditioning and great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done though a bit heavy for everyday drinking."
"Overall: Not so bad, but it is supposed to be compared with aged kasteel and having real aged kasteel and this one side by side, this one is very very disappointing. Much sharper and less soft than the aged version."
"O - Kasteel just doesn't make any bad beers and this is pick of the bunch."
"O - A nice warmer."
"Notes: A nice take in what I remember as the dark Belgian Cuvée range. While nothing mind blowing this tops the decent Scaldis version, and sure enough is miles away from the Leffe offering. Not something to actively look for but a brew that I would have gladly again."
"M/O: Very crisp and carbonated with some nice sensations on the nose. Very much masks the strong alcohol content but still delivers some very strong flavor."
"Black, almost opaque. Aromas of chocolate, dried fruit and bread on the nose but with a look and smell much more winey. However, in the tasting, vinous character, it enhances the lubricity, does not add acidity and leaves near the potion Kasteel Brune, sugar and less. A small taste of Puerto complements the taste by adding creaminess to the finish syrupy."
"A big Belgian bruiser, to be sure, but as long as it's sipped slowly, this well-balanced beer is just as much beauty as beast. But I'm glad I opened it when I did, as I wonder if the alcohol would overwhelm given another year or two...?"
"Very drinkable and very nice. I'll take this any day."
"Pretty nice overall, certainly different from the average quad, though I expect not quite the same as a truly aged beer."
"Overall, this is an interesting, complexly flavored Belgian quad that is light in body and pleasant to drink. At 11% ABV, this is a beer that requires sipping and/or some food pairing."
"O- Quite drinkable for such a cherry forward beer that isn't a sour. Easy to split a 750mL. The alc isn't noticeable. good."
"This is a nice cuvee. There is plenty of flavor. The alcohol is tasted near the end."
"Overall a good offering. Drinkable for 11%, but one to share, being that it comes in 750s."
"Overall, this was a very good strong dark ale, and I would happily drink it again."
"O- Good stuff. I'd be interested to see how this ages."
"This is a highly drinkable Belgian Strong. It comes in at a pancreatic femur bone crushing 11% but it won't make gag if yer thirsty. It is a little thin in its mouthfeel but the flavors are nice. The aroma is also nice (rich but crisp). Delicious I will drink this daily until my market runs out. Buy it for God's sake it only costs 8.99."
"D: For 11% ABV, this is incredibly drinkable. The alcohol is very well hidden by the balance of flavors, and it sweetens even more as it warms up."
"2.5 D: This isn't a terrible beer, but it is a bad one and it's definitely too pricey given the quality. Anyway, I can't say I recommend it unless you like booze and raisins a lot."
"Pours a dark reddish tinted brown color with khaki colored head that dicipates quickly. Scent is bold, yet refined... rasisin, burnt carmel, rum, slightly oxidized wine and some prune and fig. While the whiffs hinted at strength, the taste brings all the components of scent together in an ultra smooth beverage, not one flavor overpowers the other. Medium bodied, smooth, good moderate carbonation. A nice, in control and sophisticated BSDA."
"Pours a black color w/ a thin one finger head that quickly disappears. The smell is caramel, fruit and malt- and a little on the weak side in my opinion. Ok, the taste is better than the smell- plum, caramel, malt, spice, and alcohol are all accounted for here. Reminds me of a Grand Cru I recently had. Mouthfeel is good, not much going on though. A pretty major plum/alcohol aftertaste that quickly goes away. The plum lingers longer than the alcohol. This is a pretty easy beer to drink, but at 11%- you wouldn't want more than a couple a these in a sitting. Glad I got to experience this one for the first time!"
"Mighty fine stuff-Belgian lovers rejoice and go get some."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a tan head that dissipates quickly while leaving a thick, oily coating on the glass. The smell is strong with dark stone fruits and soft, ripe raisins. There is a slight booziness which mixes well with the sweetness of the dark fruits. The dark, sweet fruits come through quickly while the alcohol lingers on the back end. There is not much bitterness, just malty sweetness. A great example of a BSDA. The mouthfeel is smooth from the tight carbonation and the drinkability is insane for an 11% beer. Great representation of the style and a great drinkable beer."
"drinks surprisingly well for being so strong. booze never lets go of this one, but it is integrated nicely and makes for a nice sipping beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a slightly creamy amount of carbonation."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruit, figs and raisins, and a small alcohol note. In the taste, dark fruit, raisin stands out and a caramel like sweetness and a pinch of alcohol. A small alcohol bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit like aftertaste. Kind of somewhere between a barleywine and the Donker, nice nonetheless."
"D-i do love this beer. this is one of the best non-fruity belgians i've had. the taste diminishes a bit but i truly hope to have this one again a couple times! i was very pleased, especially after having many disappointing beligians over the past weeks."
"The beer is rich, sweet, viscous, a touch effervescent and has lots of fruitiness to it in the middle / finish. The fruitiness has notes of raisin and dates most prominently to it. The finish has a spiciness to it from some warm alcohol as well as an earthy spiciness and some black pepper character to it. A really rich, caramelized malt character makes me think of rum, dark candi syrup, brown sugar and even some notes of molasses. This actually does do a good job of simulating an aged malt character; it is almost nutty and even has a sort of sherry like note to it. The texture is nice and rich, with works quite well with the faux aged character and rich malt character; this is most certainly a beer to be savored and sipped slowly. This beer is quite nice, it is more enjoyable than I expected. Definitely drink this one slowly and allow it to warm up as it becomes much more expressive and interesting as it warms."
"D - Definitely worth drinking/sipping slowly as flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms up."
"Drinkability: An expertly crafted brew. A fantastic drinking beer that had no hint of alcohol at all - I was shocked to read that this one was 11% ... between the mild tartness and maltiness, its completely buried. If you like malty Belgian's, this is one for you - worth seeking out, even at the (somewhat) steep price."
"Awesome."
"jd"
"Good brew. I love a strong, boozy beer but this is too much. Only 11% and it does not hide it well"
"D: This had great delicate complexity leading to delicious taste. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol amazingly well, so it was super easy to drink. But it was also good enough to sip and savor. However, there was a very unpleasant sulfur element to the scent (dominant) and taste (subtle). I'm not sure what's causing that, or if age would help that or make it worse. That's the only thing keeping this from being a top BSDA."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer however it wasn't quite as complex as I would have liked given the big ABV. Still, a nice sipper that's worth a shot in the colder months."
"T: Quite similar to the aroma, and rather sweet, but it's a very positive experience. It manages to have a robust flavour which finishes remarkably dry, which makes for a very nice drinking experience. Finishes with just a little bit of bitterness that doesn't linger. Carbonation is beautiful... crisp, sparkling, and then it gives way to the dryness to finish. Alcohol is there, with a touch of pleasant warmth through the throat, and just enough to make each sip quite enjoyable. Very nicely done, and well worth every penny."
"D: This brew has aged gracefully (or has forced-aged gracefully according to an earlier reviewer). The Kasteel Cuvée Du Chateau is very much a sipper and could have just as easily been labeled a quadruple rather than a BSDA. Perfect as a digestif."
"minimal malt-type flavors (you know, nutty or caramel), in favor of some complex esters. blackcurrant"
"Brown in color with a tanned head that leaves a spotty lacing. Murky towards the bottom of the bottle. Nose is hard to wrap around, somewhat light. Notes of sweet, buttery molasses and candi sugar malt. The taste is still quite sweet, but tempered somewhat by a full carbonation. Candi sugar mixes with some strong dark fruits like raisin and figs. With the sweetness and high carbonation, comes off as almost like a craft root beer, with apparent herbs and spices mixed in. Super fruity as it warms. Alcohol also emerges as room temperature approaches; while not overly thick or sweet, this one does get a bit bogged down. Shy of the finest mouthfeels for the style, but still pretty damn good."
"Perhaps hard to obtain, but defenately recommended if you can find it."
"OVERALL: What the hell? This was a brewing experiment gone right. I would absolutely love to find an actual 10 year old bottle to compare to the magic con-artist that is the Cuvee du Chateau. I quite enjoy their regular bruin, but this freak of a brewing fast-one really got the best of me. I've had a few aged Belgian brews, and this one tastes and feels exactly like what I would expect from an aged Kasteel Bruin. Liked it so much I went back a grabbed a few more. Wonder if other breweries would be willing to try this with some of their age-friendly beers? A unique and enjoyable drinking experience. One to check out if you get the chance."
"Not boozy at all - the 11% ABV really hides itself, making this a dangerous beer."
"This decandently delicious beer is flat out dangerous.... that's how easy drinking it is. Impressive. Really hope this beer makes it down to Baltimore, as I'd like to see this around from time to time."
"D-world class beer. Just one of the best beers I have ever had. I would drink this beer again."
"No, brother, it's Kasteel Cuvee."
"Had on tap at Track 84 on 5.4.2010. Served in a tulip. Poured an opaque mahogany with burgundy highlights when backlit. A half inch, creamy, off-white head quickly receded into a thin consistent skim - no lacing present during the tasting. Nose was very subdued - some malt and a slightly vinous quality. Taste follows nose - dark fruit dominates, but not particularly malty, sweet or complex. Flavor profile is lacking the big malty, sugary quality I've come to associate with the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a subtle carbonation - somewhat thin for the style, with a slightly dry finish. I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Not really style consistent; closer to a Belgian Strong Dark in my opinion. Alcohol was well-hidden, but I was a bit disappointed by this beer."
"D: A bit sweet for me, but not bad. The flavors are good, but considering what this beer ""is", I was expecting a bit more."
"D: I think it's cool that this beer was brewed when I was in high school. That being said, I didn't really get anything except a drier version of the Donker. That's fine, I guess I just expected more."
"D - This provided me with a wonderful sipping experience while enjoying my visit to Ebenezer's. This wasn't as crazy and in-your-face as I was expecting. Instead, I was treated to a rare and delicious blend of cherries and oak."
"I should note that I feel that this beer deserves a higher overall rating than the individual scores I have given it...""sum great than the parts"" and all that. This is a very good beer that fans of Belgian and English styles should seek out, as well as those who appreciate what aging in a barrel can do to improve a beer."
"Had on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia. Poured deep reddish black into a tulip with a thick creamy head. Absolutely beautiful, color of a dark red wine. Smell was equally impressive, fruity and malty, bitter cherry and caramel notes. Taste starts sweet and fruity, malty with some vanilla too, finish is tart cherry and Belgian hops. Mild carbonation. Fantastic beer, 10 years of aging has done this one well."
"Thick, full bodied...robust! Booze is definitely warming. This beer came out of nowhere! Very, very good beer."
