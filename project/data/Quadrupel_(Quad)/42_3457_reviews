"Overall a wowzer of beer. Very complex but very easy to drink.  Definitely an after dinner sipper."
"O: One of the best quads made in the States. A great example of this classic belgian style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Total (46/50)"
""
"A heavy and complex beer. I wish I could rate it higher for its quality, but I can't due to my personal taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Belgian glass.  Huge head on it.  About 4in and probably poor on my end.  Aroma of sweet figs and caramel.  Tastes like it smells.  Front end has a sweet fig taste.  Absolutely delicious.  Ends with a slight alcohol taste and a malty caramel finish.  Delicious quad."
""
""
""
""
"O: very complex aromas and flavors;"
""
""
""
""
""
"Just at the upper-end of sweetness. Was strong but not completely overpowering"
""
"Price right and  exceptional for the price. One for the best Belgian Quads out there in the USA."
""
""
""
"Overall, not he best quad I've had, but still very good. Would've liked to have seen a slightly larger malt presence."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter. Instructions say to pour this slowly, and you need to do that, or else you're going to be left with one giant head. I did it very slowly, but there was still significant head to it. I let it sit for a bit, and once it settled, the head was a beautiful brownish-white layer of fluff. It retained itself throughout the drink, and provided the ale a nice creamy element. Lacing was superb. The ale is smooth, with the cherries providing a very nice touch. This is overall a tremendous beer, and I think absolutely a top-ten quad."
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of Belgian or Belgian style beers, but this wasn't bad. Very bread-y and crisp."
""
"Fruity and bright and effervescent. With a luxurious, velvety mouthfeel. Ommegang does not disappointment here."
""
""
"I'm always feeling pretty fantastic after drinking a bottle of this one. I want to be the fourth Philosopher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely the most exquisite beer I have had. It is amazingly good value and I am laughing right now because I completely forgot I was drinking a beer with Morello sour cherries added! That is quite the accomplishment then, because it shows the balance and character they have achieved in this masterful brew. Cheers."
"o: I love all the offerings from Ommegang and this is one of my favorites. Comforting in its familiarities and exciting in it's differences."
"Another great Belgian example from Ommegang.  The mouth fell felt a little light and champaign, but I'm still learning how to discern subtle nuances.  Overall, great quad!"
""
""
""
"Ooooomfph. Now that's a beer. Tread lightly my friends."
""
""
""
""
""
"any cherry at all.  It's not terrible, but I wouldn't pick it up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, dark amber body with a big creamy head. Smells of dark fruits like cherries, dates, and raisins, and at almost 10% alcohol it makes an appearance aswell. Taste is essentially the same as the smell would imply, very sweet, fruity and the alcohol packs a punch but is still enjoyable. Has a very thick mouth feel, it kinda leaves a film coating your mouth, and it has fairly low carbonation. Overall pretty good beer, but is a bit on the pricy side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was pissed off how much I paid for it. I'm a cheap batard. But oh my! It hasn't been this good since I was in Brugge. Their making this in New York! Lordy, we might find some monks out of work!"
""
""
""
"Strong, dark and oh so sweet."
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Complex, layered. On the sweeter side - definitely a dessert drink."
""
""
""
""
"Nice complex beer.  My only negative is it was a bit too sweet for me."
""
""
"Smells and tastes awesome.  Great cherry flavor that goes down smoothly.  No weird aftertastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Great beer that is complex and full of flavor. Had fun with this one."
""
""
""
"Good.....but not really my taste"
""
""
""
""
"A bit bitter and fruity. Unique sour taste. Quite good"
""
""
"Beautiful, copper color.  Foamy head, smooth finish.  Fantastic Belgian ale."
""
""
"12oz bottle - Tulip  - Best beer from Ommegang  in my book."
"One of my all-time favourites."
""
"Not a fan of this one."
"O – A complex, layered beer, a lot going on here, the residual sweetness needs to be balanced out a bit, but an excellent sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Type of serving: from a 750ml bottle into a Chimay glass"
""
"Would not buy this again."
""
"My first quadrupel so I don't have a standard of comparison.  It was OK, but too fruity/malty for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not one of the better quads I've had and a little more bitter than I like for the style.  The kriek does very little for this beer."
""
"malt bomb :(  I like their dubbel ale much better."
"This is a marvelous beer. Pricy no doubt at $4.49 a single, but it's easily World Class in the style. Big fan of this one."
""
"O: this is a awesome e example of a Belgian quad. It does not overtake any particular aspects of itself just very well balanced. It would go good with plenty of kinds of food. For the price point it is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O-A unique full bodied that displays a lot of complexity."
""
"Wasn't sure how I'd feel about this beer at first but it's very nice. Smooth great flavor."
""
""
""
"This style is not to my liking."
""
""
"Pours deep brown. high in carbonation. thick vanilla colored two finger head. roasty, malty. Ommegang has yet to disappoint me."
""
"I have a question. This may sound dumb but it's just a little confusing to me. Well....first of all, I love this beer. One of my favorites. Anyway, when I'm rating a beer.....let's say the color......is the ""color"" rating based on how light or dark it is? Or is it based on how pretty or ugly it is? With the smell, is it how good or bad it smells? Or how potent or non potent it smells? Do these questions make sense or am I just a stupid dummy? Pardon my ratings......again, I don't know what they mean. I'll change them once I know."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect for sitting by the fire reading a book."
""
""
""
""
"O: Three Philosophers is a Quad away from the pack. The addition of true Belgian Kriek give this brew a really unique twist that makes this beer feel like luxurious desert in a glass. While not strictly true to style, this beer if a must try if you're a fan of all things strong, dark, and Belgian."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Generally I have found Ommegang beers less than expected, but this one was good although not great.  A hint of cherry, not as dense and malty as most quadrupels."
""
""
""
"Poured a 750 into a goblet. A reddish brown beer fills the goblet offering a hearty  cream colored head. It smells just like a belgian quad, dates raisins? defiantly fruits of that nature. I get the cherry straightforward upon sipping, not overwhelming just the right amount of blend with the kriek. Slight carbonation in the mouth. A real nice quad from Ommegang."
""
"2006 - Thanks Matt! Aged copper. Musty Barleywine-esqe, faux cherry, big toffee. Not bad for 8 years old."
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable beer. It's only 2% cherry lambic and I would suggest they push the cherry a little more and see what happens. This beer tasted so good I drank almost the whole glass before I started my review. Of course I have 3 more cooling in the fridge..."
""
"I enjoy Ommegang, but I think I like visiting the Baseball Hall of Fame even better."
""
""
""
"This was one of my favorite Christmas gifts - I love the name, the packaging, and I've been very interested in trying an Ommegang beer for a long time.This definitely fits the BA mantra of ""drink better, drink less."" I really like the way this one looks and smells. The aroma gives you no illusions - it says ""I am a yeasty, fruity, boozy beast of a beer"". There is plenty of raisin and black cherry in both the nose and the taste. The finish is somewhat tart, which is a bit unexpected. There is a lovely alcohol burn after the third or fourth swallow, in the most pleasant way possible. One bottle of this is plenty for tonight."
""
""
""
"Very well rounded beer. One of my favorites. Could be a easy daily drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lions and tigers and beers, oh my."
""
"This is generally not my my favorite style of beer.  (A little darker and sweeter than I would usually drink).  But this was very good, smooth, and tasty.  Be careful...I imagine the high ABV could sneak up on you.  :-)"
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Only 2% cherry.  Not as fruity as I expected.  It's really just a hint of cherry."
""
""
""
"Not always consistent and sometimes tasting a bit harsh, when Ommegang gets this one right it is a smooth, heavy Belgian with a touch of cherry."
""
""
"Dark brown color, fizzy light head that quickly faded, no lacing. Aroma was figs, plums, raisins with some tart black cherry and grassy notes. Taste was pretty close to the smell, with the tartness from the cherries melding with the candi sugar sweetness to form a nice complex mix, with just the right amount of yeasty funkiness to let you know it's a quad. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and silky smooth. Overall this was pretty good, but not quite up the stature of a Abt 12 or a Rochefort 10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my all-time favorite beers.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Packaged 10/14. Pours a clear dark red, brown tinted; two fingers of cola-fizzy light brown colored head settles to a thin ring; rings of lace try but don't stick. Smell: brown sugar, brown bread, notes of unfiltered apple juice, prune, black cherry...maybe. Taste: sugary dates, dark brown sugar, lots of cherry, notes of stale grain and banana, earth and clove in the finish. Feel is fluffy but carbonation is a bit aggressive. Interesting combo, pretty tasty."
""
""
"Love the brewery. Love their Quads...the Kriek has just enough fruit to send the whole thing wrongly bitter depending on the batch..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong notes of black cherry and black currant. Very fizzy, as well."

""
""
"Wow. I had seen ratings of this and immediately built it in my mind to be a life changing experience, and while it did fall just short of the latter description, it certainly wasn't far off. I suppose it'd get a full 5 out of me if its finish was just a tad smoother, because I really can't come up with anything else legitimate as a complaint."
""
""
"Aroma of dark fruits and breads. Pours ruddy brown clouded body with a more than generous beige head. Head lasts and produces a lacing that lingers all the way down the glass. Taste is sour cherry, a touch alkaline very alchoholic. Unique."
""
""
""
""
"Really nice beer. Rich, malty nose...big body, malty-sweet. Some of the characteristic Belgian yeast finish came through. Agree with other reviews that said you need to let this one breathe a bit before diving in. I had this one out of a corked bomber bottle.  A little bit of Brussels here in the states."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good, but not overwhelmingly so, especially at $17 a 4 Pack. I'd buy it again, but I've had significantly better Quads for quite a bit less price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, really good, but not my favorite quad.  Rich and malty, but more carbonation than I had been hoping for.  Perhaps it was my error in not letting it breath for a bit.  Overall an enjoyable quad, not as much ""wow"" as Rochefort 10, but more drinkable nonetheless."

"I personally did not care for it. I am not a fan of the brown ales. But it is smoother than most of the brown ales I have tried. Hints of caramel. Did pair with my gingerbread cookies."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"I loved the complexity of this beer. This is a beer that you sip and savour. Truly excellent!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full bodied, darker ale which will surprise your palate with rich and malty flavors. Take a big whiff before taking this one back, and enjoy the deeper flavor of this quad."
""
""
""
"Very good beer. Nice hint of fruity malt taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I also should note that my rating reflects my preference for dark, malty beers with minimal hop character.  Three philosophers finished too hoppy for me to buy it again."

"I quite like this"
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why they felt the need to blend in cherries. Would be much better as a stand alone quad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Make sure to air it out in a proper glass, super smooth and malty finish."
""
""
"O:this is not a bad beer, but I believe it to be an overly ambitious one, I think perhaps most of all that's what makes it unsuccessful. The quad style is a monster of a beer style built on the legendary brewing traditions of the trappists. generally, though not as much so in the wake of the later phase of this our american craft beer revolution, very few brewers even attempt to brew quadrupels and even fewer do so with true success. the great ones generally come from the trappists of belgium. three philosophers then, may very well be an adequate or to be more descriptive not a bad beer but once again that's the largest part of the problem, Making a 'passable' quad, either in the sense that it's just not bad for beer or even in the sense that it's just not bad for a quad and even tastes like one, is a lot like duplicating a famous painting, sure you have the skill, but if it is not better than the original or at least equally good yet different, who gives a shit. the equally good yet different here was supposed to be the kriek, and if it truly worked in this beer, I'd be inclined to give it high praise indeed all of the praise it deserves. So while points are most assuredly deserved here for craft and a willingness to experiment, what we are left with is a briny, adequate beer with all of the worst characteristics of the beer it blends in, with none of the things that render those bad characteristics complementary."

"41/50"

"Plum, pruny, cherry-slight tartness reminiscent of the tartness of a cranberry, concord grape also prominent as well. Mild malty sweetness. Slight cooked caramel notes along with some hints of light toasted notes. Boozy notes present off the grape flavor. Soft earthy, hoppy bitterness balances the malt sweetness nicely. Second time I've had this brew in 10 days, it just keeps getting better. A nice end of summer, start of fall beer. I am glad this is s year around brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I believe this is my new favorite Quad! Definitely an Americanized Quad, but the complexity of this brew makes it stand out and it is downright tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank the 2014 version in 2014 (for you people in the future reading this). Be aware that this drink is suggested by Ommegang to be cellared and many people reviewing it are drinking cellared versions from years ago. If you want to know what a fresh batch tastes like, look no further. That's what this review is about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cherries seem to add a bitter quality to the Quad which competes with the other elements instead of working with them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A tasty, elegant brew.  The age on it, perhaps up to two years, may have added both smoothness and mellow fruitness which is much appreciated."

"Serving type: bottle"
"Such an enjoyable beer, I don't know what they put in there, aside from grain and alcohol, but something about it is like dark chocolate and cream and raspberries and everything that's meant to be good about a dark, aperitif beer."
""
"This is exactly what I am looking for from a Belgian Quad, and is one of my favorites from outside the Trappist ales. Spicy and savory, the 750 ML bottle goes down smooth. The sweetness of the cherries really shines through, and the rich mouthfeel leaves me satisfied every time I spring for a bottle. A bit on the pricey side, as I shelled out $9.50 for the bottle, and the bar I know of with this bad boy on tap charges $6.50 for an eight ounce glass, it's worth springing for when I'm looking for an excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a tasty quad. Right away I got a bananaesque aromas from the bottle. Malty noise with dark fruits in the glass. Looks like a typical quad. The taste is dark fruit, malts, and cherry in the background. This is overall a great beer. Not a Rochefort 10 (my personal favorite quad) but well worth a try."
""
""
"O: A very good beer, nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with a full bodied mouth feel."
""

"Good beer"
""
""
""
""
"The nose is citrus and dark fruit, belgian yeast, and molasses.  A little toffee and rustic funk.  Personally, I get raisins instead of cherries, but could be just my nose.  The flavor is much more tart than I anticipated and the kriek blend really is present here.  More dark fruit, plums, grapes and moderately sweet molasses.  This is a great blend, enjoying the sour element to it.  The only negative for me is the over carbonation.  Great beer, just less fizz."

"This is a great Quad for an American Brewery, it's up to the standards of any Belgian ale but with a little bit of uniqueness of American style.  Ive tried the sampler which as three different years with the oldest being the 2010 if I remember right.  Saving that for a special occasion!"
"Very good, very strong!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-not one of my preferred styles as it is a bit too sweet for me with a boozy punch.  The sweetness lingers which makes it less drinkable for my tastes.  (3.75)"
"This beer pours a nice dark brown. It has a strong presence and a nice full body. Its flavours are of molasses and toffee, but it also carries a strong sweet flavor like a Belgian. It is full bodied but well rounded and is easy to drink considering its strength. Overall it is another strong offering from Ommegang, but not my favorite."

"Overall: A fine brew that is to me ""misplaced"" in category. I should re-review an older bottle in the future. Might be ""too fresh"" to enjoy thoroughly. Right now the brew stands out like a high alcohol Dubbel or BSDA. For a Quad it falls short. This bottle lacks complexity and depth. The flavors seem to be muddled together so nothing really stands out and says excellence. Like I said before its a fresher review but it still feels like I’m drinking a higher gravity version of their Abbey Dubbel. Still this is worth a shot."

"Sorry, but this is not a quad."
""
""
"Aged this bottle for about 6 months. A dark brown-amber, almost the color of weak black coffee, with a thin white head. Smell is of dried fruit, molasses and yeast. The taste adds another dimension to the nose, with some Belgian spice, brown sugar and more dried fruit. Full bodied, smooth, fairly low carbonation, but easy drinking with a definite alcohol presence. Overall, a solid quad."
"I gave this beer an excellent rating, but I only drink it with dessert. On it's own it's good, but Ommegang (not the biggest fan) has created the near perfect dessert beer. For a bunch of reasons, it just goes really well with eating sweets."
""
""
""
""
"Nice amber/toffee color, decent cream colored head. Smell is bready, yeasty, a little overripe fruit and spices. Taste is nice but not overwhelming. Some fig/pear fruits, but caramel malts and Belgian yeast spices are more pronounced. This also has a green hop flavor that I find a bit unusual for the style. It provides a little sharpness, and I think this could be smoother. Overall, very solid but it didn't meet my fairly high expectations."
""
""
"Overall, another enjoyable quad. from Ommegang."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty, luscious quad that affords all the dark, malty complexity one would expect of the style."

"Pours a dark hazel with a tan head that laces the glass. The smell is very boozy with a hint of cherries on the end of the nose. The taste was really nice with a lot of great sweet flavors off the front with the cherries as well as banana and clove, but with a sweet burn from the alcohol at the end. The mouthfeel was a little thick but worked well in the style. Would definitely recommend for those who like stronger styles."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer. Not as outstanding as authentic Belgian quads such as ABT 12 and the like, but a solid representation of the style nonetheless. The added cherry dimension from the addition of the Liefmans Kriek really makes this beer interesting. The cherry element brings it all together, without being too overpowering. I'm not a big cherry person, but the amount of cherry flavor is PERFECT. I'm probably crazy, but this beer kinda reminds me of red licorice. Extremely drinkable, with alcohol that is masked insanely well. I could drink this all day!"
""
""
""
"Medium to full body with soft and abundant carbonation. Really mellow after four years of age, but with a tinge of tart cherry flavor. Alcohol is non existent. I do wish there was a bit more of nose."

"Sometimes with Ommegang, I don't know what to expect. White the 3 philosophers, I was thinking it'd be a bittery type of beer, but once I poured it, and saw a nice dark, caramel color, I knew it'd be different. It's sweet. Reminds me of amaretto, while my friends said it was like so co. Nice to drink of the bat, but gets heavy later on. I could see myself drinking this with a dessert, which I rarely do."

"o. Wish there was no coriander, but I think it is the signature spice of the Ommegang group."
"O- I can't say I was the biggest fan of this one. I finished the bottle, which I don't always do when I'm not overly impressed, so it gets points for that. You could definitely tell it was a combination of styles. The flavors mixed together to form something kind of muddy to me. The aroma and mouthfeel were nice, though."

"Hazy orange-brown pour with a medium beige head, settling to a nice creamy coating. Enticing, complex aromas of candied cherries, brown sugar, raisins, a little citrus and yeast. Less cherry notes in the flavor, but some nice dark fruit, along with light citrus. A bit light for a quad, with a subtle sourness and a very dry finish. Very nice and a bit different for the style."

"4/2014 Almost 4 years later I tried this beer again. I was out to dinner and the beer choices were limited. Went perfectly with the stuffed bacon wrapped dates, scallops and drunken goat cheese ravioli. Palates do change. Will have to keep this one in mind next time I am planning a special meal."
""
""

"Taste is much like the smell. Very rich with an upfront caramel note. The aftertaste houses a Lambic or Saison hint. Not overpowering... the perfect blend. Very smooth on the tongue. All and all, an incredible beer."

"Notes: Complex to say the least, each sip gives me something new. The alcohol is very present in this one. Oddly wine-esque, much more so than other quads I've had. This would be a great dessert beer. Also, it happened I was sipping this while snacking on some cantaloupe and for some reason that match up went really well."

"A bit sweeter and not as bready or fig-tasting as many other quads, but still a favorite and good go- to beer. Spicy flavors and aromas and almost a peppery taste that is appealing. Medium bodied, which makes it go down way too fast. That and fact that it belies its high abv. Always satisfying and tasty. Probably my favorite from Ommegang."

"this one had a bit of everything, hints of lemony citrus with huge cinnamon grahm cracker notes, lot of raisin and hints of coa coa. just thick enough and not too bubbly. wow . complex and very drinkable but not as drinkable as a rochefort 10, and less abv. still amazing beer"

"750ml bottle into tulip glass. Being a fan of anything Belgian, I was excited when a friend brought this over. First thing I thought of the flavor was that it tasted like a mix of cigar smoke and burnt wood chips (the kind hamsters shit on). Color to match. A great beer that I would drink again but only with help, as a full pint of this is too much for me."
"I need a bottle all to myself!"
""
"I've had this a few times and loved it. This one was poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Aggressive pour yielded a thick, foamy head that dissipated slowly. Fruity, spicy aroma with a very dark, reddish color. Taste is very complex that leaves a tingly mouthfeel. Good carbonation without a serious bite. These guys specialize in Belgian ales and it shows. Who knew Americans from New York could pull it off so well? According to the label they're part of the Duvel family of beers... Ah, it makes sense now. If you like the abbey ale style as I do, you'll love the Ommegang offerings. Cheers!"

" Opinion: I felt this was a fantastic drink but beers like this don't quench a beer thirst. These are a one and done type of beer. I've had other beers with higher abv that hid it better. Don't mistake what I am saying, It really is a fantastic drink, very complex and I would probably buy this again. My wife loved it. She was of the opinion that it would be better if served at room temperature instead of cold as we had it. She felt the flavors really came out more as it warmed in your mouth and I can't disagree."
""
"Overall: An amazing beer, with a lot of sweetness from the malt and fruit notes, but so well balanced that it's not cloying. Despite the high ABV and the fact that it is a bit strong, it's surprisingly easy to drink."
""
""
"Haven't had one of these in a few years, and this has been in the cellar fit over a year. Really solid for the style. With a few more years age on it, it could be pretty on par with westy 12."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out to a thick buff head and deep amber color. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is sour cherries with a bit of aged hops, sugar, spice and bubblegum. Flavor is complex and deceptively easy to drink. There is a good dose of sweet and sour, berries, bubble gum and other fruity-spicy esters. Mouthfeel is medium and sugary. Overall, an exceptionally tasty and enjoyable beverage."

"O: Outstanding beer. The beer's individual performance in each category of evaluation belie how good it really is overall. Furthermore as a hybrid, it has done a great job of taking all the great aspects of its parts and saved only those for this. A truly enjoyable beer, but at an abv near 10% this makes for a short, but lively and enjoyable, session."

"Mouthfeel - Full bodied with small bubbles that completely coat the palate. - 4.5"

"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer. That old chestnut about the whole being greater than the ""sum of the parts"" comes to mind and is certainly applicable here (especially since it was uttered by one of the world's greatest philosophers). There are remarkable aspects of taste and other levels of enjoyment in this beer that would not be found in the individual beers of which it consists. I would recommend it, but with a warning: its high ABV will knock you on your nates. Great and unique Belgian Quad."

"Had a bottle at 1410 Bier Haus in Calgary, the sort of beer you'll pay a premium for if ordered out but worth it in this case. Looks like murky, hazy root beer with a little cream mixed into it, with ample brown foam. Aroma a sweet and heady mixture of rich toffee, floral tobacco, vanilla bourbon, and brown spices. Very sweet smell but there's a little bitter grain to provide balance. Palate is all rich sweet malts, dark fruits, and spice, minimal toast or roast. Milk chocolate, dates, nutmeg and clove, vanilla cream, a little banana, and licorice toffee with a semi-chewy, buttery mouthfeel. A small amount of ale brewed with Belgian kriek cherries imparts a subtle red fruit acidity from start to finish. Low to moderate carbonation. A very nice quad with a lot of complexity and character. I found the aroma to be sweeter than the palate."

"Poured a rich, cloudy dark amber/brown with a one finger-off white head that receded leaving a bit of lacing. Very true to form for a quad, quite nice. Scents of bubblegum, Belgian yeast spiciness, candi sugar sweetness, cherry, caramel, sweet spices, raisins, dark fruit, prunes and a hint of alcohol. A very rich, complex aroma, fitting a Belgian Quad. Flavor begins with Belgian yeast spiciness, tart cherry and candi sugar, sustaining spice and tart cherry throughout the sip. The middle moves into raisin, plum, sweet spices, peppery spiciness in the background, some apricot pit-like bitterness, dark fruit and dark chocolate. There is faint alcohol towards the finish, which also has a yeasty, spicy and dark fruit quality. Very rich, sweet, spicy and complex. A well done mix of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with low carbonation and semi-drying finish. Very good for sipping, though almost smooth enough to gulp. Excellent feel. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Quad. The usual flavors are there and the addition of cherries during fermentation add a nice tartness in the back of the aroma and flavor that is quite pleasant. Its a very good beer that is rich, warming and complex. This is one to go out for."

"O: a decent impersonation of a Belgian quad, but I find this beer just lacks a little something on the flavor spectrum. Quads tend to be among my favorite beers, and I had expected a lot from this one, but in the end it just sort of left me feeling a little flat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite quad but it's good to know that I can swing by any decent beer store at any time to grab some when I'm craving the style. It's a solid brew with enough going for it that I revisit periodically."

"O: A sipping beer, really more for sharing with a friend than finishing alone, and best when paired with a strong-flavored side (Ghirardelli Intense Dark chocolate worked for me). The next bottle will come out when we have friends over for dessert."

"The Three Philosophers was a great looking beer as well as great tasting, with big malts and little to no hop bitterness. I didn’t pick up any huge cherry flavor only a slight tartness on the end that gave this brew a nice complexity along with the Belgian yeasts and sweet malt. It’s a great gateway beer for someone unfamiliar with a Belgian Style or a stronger style of beer, as the cherry lambic helps to mellow out the Belgian Quadrupel."

"Not going to lie, I was expecting a lot from this beer when I purchased it. However, it was still one of the better beers I have tried recently. The pour presented a dark copper color with a small, off-white head. Taste was smooth, I was expecting a more velvet mouthfeel. I will definitely purchase this in the future. Ommegang Brewery keeps me coming back to them."

"Poured from a Belgian bottle into a pint glass. Pours a copper, almost brown color, opaque from suspended yeast, visible carbonation, thin off white head. Smell is sweet and yeasty, some dark cherry and plum notes. Taste is alcoholic, and yeasty with some sweet cherry finish. Slight bitterness, maybe slight astrigency. Higher than expected carbonation, and not quite as thick as I was expecting. Overall, an excellent beer made in the Quad style, although not on par with some of the best Belgian Quad's."

"Lots of cherry and dark fruity aromas and flavors. Reddish tint to the glass and a decent amount of carbonation. Not too bitter or alcohol tasting. More of a dessert beer and hides the 9.7% abv very well. This beer gets better as it warms up out of the fridge. Very delicious quadruple."

"This is my current favorite beer. I have not had a better beer in my 30 years of life. If you have any suggestions, please let me know! I welcome a challenger. But as of my 100 or so beers, this is my go to deliciousness. It's strong but not too alcohol tasting, it's fruity and dark. Just everything I've dreamed of a beer. Why is this not replacing water?"

"Overall: An excellent example of a strong dark ale. There are no qualities that make it a true standout in my opinion, but this is a big beer style, and with every beer in this category making quite the statement, it's difficult to outshine the others. Absent of faults, and even the characteristics that I was expecting to find but didn't aren't ""musts"" for the style. Definitely delicious. Always a good choice."

"Overall, Im generally a west coast style IPA kind of guy, love the whole hoppy citruisy bomb type beers ( stone ipa, green flash west coast ipa, ballast points sculpin ipa), but for what this beer is, I really enjoyed it. Has those dark fruits which im not a fan of, but they are very mild and enjoyable, and that little bit of spiciness you get that dies out quick and just leaves you with cherries. for 9.7abv, this is dangerous and delicious. i enjoyed this."
"This beer is fantastic! similar in certain flavors and balance to their Abbey Ale. As others have said, very similar to Trappists style ales Ive had. Definitely has a slight cherry flavor in the finish giving nice balance to the sharp beginning. Awesome Beer!!"

"This big Belgian style ale has to be one of my favorite. A rich hearty beefy beer with complex caramel overtones. Not to bitter with a touch of sweet cherry in the finish. The large corked bottle is perfect to preserve it so that it does not have to be drank in one sitting. Open top fermented provides a complex yeast blend. If only it were a little less expensive at the local pub. But hats off to this American interpretation to this Belgian masterpiece. The filet mignon of Belgian beers."
""
""
"O- I find this a pretty good tasting brew, lots of flavor, easy on the nose. Very good mouthfeel that makes it pretty easy to drink. I will buy this one again at some point, even tho it is not my normal style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad brew, but not one I'd buy again. Who knows, maybe the single I bought wasn't the freshest. I enjoyed drinking it, but I was a bit disappointed as it usually gets outstanding reviews. Quad fans will probably like this beer, but I feel there are better examples of Belgian ales."
""
"O-This is a pretty good beer, just not a great one. I thought it was a bit overly-spiced and carried too much light fruit and bitterness to compare against the Belgians. I could have used more raisin/plum/fig/prune. On the plus side, the alcohol is nicely concealed and, if you're into spices, there are a plenty here."
""
""
"O: Deeee-Lish!! A beautiful round beer. Great Belgian flavors with a big malt profile and the subtle cherry and fruit adds a nice complexity."
""
"O: Ommegang is a good thing ... my quadrupel experience is very limited, so it's hard for me to place an accurate to-style number on this thing, BUT it's good -- the cherry kriek addition supposedly only accounts for 2% of the brew, but it is present. you can taste dark cherries in there, and it mixes just fine with the dark-fruity/yeasty taste of the quad."

"A very well done quad. Very inviting nose, and the taste is quite enjoyable. Though I felt that the individual characteristics in the taste weren't quite as distinct as in the aroma."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a Quad, even though it's a blend of a Quad and a Kriek I thought this beer was much more Quad like with Kriek aspects showing up in the background and blending well with the Quad Like flavors. I would be able to tell there was at least some cherries in this beer by the aroma, but I don't think I could tell that this was blended with a Kriek by the flavors alone. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was slightly warming, but I thought it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't rule out drinking a couple of these if I was in the mood for this kind of beer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, I'm not sure how this beer would be if the Kriek was the dominant aspect, but I don't think I would enjoy as much since I liked the Quad flavors taking the lead with the Kriek aspects showing up in the background. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but I do think that cherries could have shown up just a little more in the taste. I would buy this beer again, it was a little expensive, but I could see myself buying a bottle or two once in a while and I would recommend this to anyone who likes Quads. All in all I was happy with this beer, I enjoyed it just the way it was and I now see why this beer is as popular as it is, I don't know what took me so long to try it, but I'm glad I did. Good job guys, this is a nice take on a Quard and I think blending is something that is very under utilized by American Brewery's. Keep up the good work guys, so far this is my Favorite beer from Brewery Ommegang and even through this was a blend I still think it's one of better Quads I have tried."

"Overall, I like this creation even more that many Belgian counterparts. It's the mouthfeel that really makes that happen for me--as a contrast to the syrupy cordial character that can make these beers intriguing, but tiring to try to consume. I'd drink this one too long for my health, especially on a chilly evening."
"O: Overall a very nice creation. For the ethanol content- as well as the true richness of its flavor components, this is an incredibly drinkable beer, and surprisingly somewhat refreshing as well. Not insanely filling, as many beers with similar flavor profiles can be - and also does not scream winter warming seasonal brew. This can shine on its own, but wonderfully also accompany food as well. Definitely worth a try!! I will absolutely have this again."

"Not your average quad! The cherry addition lightens up a usually heavy style, but the base beer is still complex with yeast esters. Sweet, dry, tart...a little bit for everyone. I do prefer my quads with more malt sweetness, though."

"O: I was pretty disappointed in this. I had it a year or so ago and loved it but i was put off by the gingerbread that dominated. I'll have to give this another go because it appears well made and complex but it just didn't mix right for me compared to other quads. /82"

"Poured a tan thin persistent head from a 12 oz bottle deep cloudy red amber hue. It has smell of prunes some etoh  and yeast apparent . Tasted some sour blunted cherry flavor that lingers with some warm tartness slight malt . It had a warming effect with moderate carbonation. Overall pleasing but strong beer on the palate lingering sour and etoh"

"I enjoyed it more than most Belgians"
""

"On first taste, the toasted flavor comes shining through, especially in the foam, then followed by the bold notes of coffee and caramel chocolate. Low carbonation, medium sweet and medium viscosity. Very very slight bitterness. The taste centers on the middle of the tongue. Aftertaste of caramel, very little bitterness."

"overall: Been a while since I enjoyed one of these. Forgot how great this is. Great brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of Ommegang's more well-known brews. It's elegant, but a bit overstated at times- very boozy, especially as it warms. A prime candidate for aging, I'd think."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: didn't score A, S, T, M at that time; please disregard those scores."
"All in all, a pretty good ale, one I'd probably try again after I get some more tasting experience."

"Three Philosophers pours a mahogany red color. Deep and luscious with four fingers of foam that really last. Off the nose is grass and a subtle sweetness, cherry. Complex. Excellent retention and lacing. The first sip has no alcohol taste, a little spice and a bit of warmth. Creamy and balanced. The body is perfectly carbonated and soft. Medium body. The cherry from the Kriek is exquisitely stated. Little bit of a dry finish to remind you that the hops are in there. This beer is truly ""cordial."" Ommegang is near perfect as usual."
""
""

"Poured from corked and caged bottle into a chalice. Deep cloudy copper-ruby color with a medium-thick fluffy tan head that isn't going anywhere. Smell is Belgian yeast, smooth maltiness, some chocolate, and a hint of fruits, mostly dark, although there's some cherry. Taste is just as complex as the nose; sweet malt up front, with the standard Belgian yeast flavor hiding in the wings; it fades into sweet chocolate and a bit of sweet dark fruit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is the first Belgian beer I've been able to stomach, let alone enjoy, and I love this stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm really impressed with this beer. I've loved everything I've had from Ommegang and this beer did not disappoint. It fully deserves it's reputation."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Only knock against the beer is the lack of a distinct finish. Has so much distinct aroma and a wonderful feel up front that I wanted more from the back end of the taste."

""
""
""
""
""

"A bit of cherry, malt, sugary sweetness, date or prune, and a touch more cherry can all be found on the tongue. A bit tart and a touch of fig comes near the end. Overall, it's very good and with some minor tweaks to the flavor and feel it could be great."

"The Rest: De-li-cious. A bomber of this is the perfect evening companion to relax and enjoy life."
""
""
"O: A solid beer overall but perhaps a bit too sweet for my tastes. The sweetness makes drinking a second glass a little tougher than I'd prefer Pairing this beer with something slightly bitter would be really nice. I feel like this beer would age nicely after a few years."
""
""
""
"O - Very, very impressive. Smooth for a nearly 10% ABV beer. This is a fresh quad; I have two saved for aging in the cellar. This is truly among the best beers I have ever had. It's not the most incredibly complex, but there are some subtleties, and absolutely every flavor is complementary, clean, and lovely. There isn't a single aspect of this beer that I can criticize negatively."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this with other quads. It’s better than Chimay, but not as good as Rochefort nor St. Bernardus. It’s well crafted though and definitely stands up with the Belgian quads."
"O: This blended beer is an interesting creation and worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brownish color with amber highlights and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is lots of dark fruits, some mild spices. Taste is not as good as the smell. Malts, dark fruits, alcohol is making itself known here, pretty good, but expecting better. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pricy beer, but worth it if you're hunting for something complex, layered and unique. I've never had a beer like this one. It has it's flaws, but it is a must try for any fans of the style."
"Overall: Pretty delicious beer overall. I think there are some lacking elements to this beer, but nothing that is boldly wrong with it. A bit on the pricey side, but worth at least a try."

"O-My new favorite Belgian Quad. It beats out Boulevard's, IMO."
""
""
"Overall: My first quad, so I don't anything to compare it too, but if they are all like this, I'm in for a treat. I hope to delve more into this style in the future, but with summer fast approaching, I'll probably go with lighter styles for the time being. A good brew to curl up with in the winter."

"Good bit of clove/malt, nice caramel appearance and taste. Smells and tastes like I would expect a strong Belgian would taste. Bit of boozy taste but not overpowering, esp for a high gravity at 9.8%. Smooth on the way down with a bit of aftertaste. Very enjoyable experience, and that's not just because it's my second Belgian of the night (other one was Unibroue Maudite). If I had a gun to my head I would go with the Maudite, but it would have to be a big gun."

"O - Overall, better than Chimay and Abt 12, but it isn't a Rochefort 12. I'd have again. Savor from a snifter!"
""
"So if you are NOT a fan of heavily hopped beers and IPAs, then this is a great choice."
""
"This baby can replace a bottle of red wine easy, I served this at a dinner party with wine drinkers and after a few minutes of complaining they all went for it and really enjoyed the meal. It was a steak meal. It's amazing how complex and satisfying this beer is. The 2% cherry blends so well that it gives you the best of a red wine and a strong beer. This is now my favorite beer for a red meat meal. I only wish they vamped it up to wine strength, this isn't a criticism only a celebration of seeing beer find it's rightful place with a tasty meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts out with some instant sweetness, the candied sugar is the star, some subtle flavors meld in such as some dark fruit, like raisins, and some lighter fruit, like banana, none is overpowering but tend to work together to paint an overall picture, carbonation is a touch high but gives it a more refreshing aspect than what might normally be too sticky or cloying, strength is very well hidden with only the slightest of afterburn in the back of the throat."
""
"Overall-This beer is making me look forward to trying others of this type. I love the sweet and sour mix in this. Price for this is reasonable, I would like to try the 12oz bottles next time, seems the better deal. 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a great dark amber color. Sweet fruity aroma with hints of banana. Sweet toasted caramel taste--almost a bit burnt. Spicy also. Strong flavors and mild to moderate carbonation. The 9.8% alcohol level really hits you. Great complexity and a strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Intriguing, full of character, but not one for sipping more than a small glass at a time. This probably would be better with a bold-flavored snack. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Liticker's in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was an easy drinking brew with a nice mouthfeel and really nice malt presence. I'm a bit of a neophyte for this style, but overall this was solid. I've got an extra bottle I'm planning to age for a year to see how it ages."
"I just don't think I am a fan of Belgian beers. I can appreciate that this was a good representation of the style but the smell and taste are just not for me. I got a very yeasty and bread-like smell. The taste had these same components but also a sour, fruit-like taste. I think this is what exactly what they were going for but like I said, I just don't enjoy this style. I shared a bomber of this with my brother in law and I am glad I did. He likes this type of beer so he got to enjoy it and I didn't have to go through an entire bomber of this by myself."

""
""
"O: Really nice, but for $10, I expect no less."
""
""
""
""
"Don't drink crappy beer! Life is too short!"
""
"Overall, I think the price keeps me coming back to this beer. A comparable Belgian costs about 50 percent more in my area."
"I had this when it first came out and liked it but I was concerned it might not be so good after sitting in my cabinet for over a year. It held up really well. I don't recall all the characteristics of it when I first had it but I feel like it is more complex and subtle than I remember."
""
"O- I think the combination with the kriek is very interesting. It adds tang to what would be a powerfully sweet beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Re-edit...50 minutes into this beer it's fully opened up. I'm upping the overall & taste categories, but note, it takes at last half an hour for this brew, even in a big chalice, to fully open and start to resemble the qualities of the above mentioned brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O - Sweet and dark fruit, not my favorite right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Of course, Ommegang, lives up to it's name, I've never been disappointed by an Ommegang beer, and probably never will. Although I got the beer for a good deal, it is generally expensive but it its well worth it, wonderful taste, very rich and robust, very delicious, basically a dessert rather than a beverage, at least once everyone should make the effort to try this."

"O: Age has done this beer well. I got no boozy taste whatsoever, and the yeast brought out some nice spiciness, particularly in the aftertaste. This is the best American Quad I've ever had, but I don't think that's as good of a compliment as most would."
""
""
""
""
""
"The first thing that hits the nose is a mix of the sweet, organic cherries found in the aroma and a bitter earthy hop note with a touch of alcohol. This mellows into a very smooth bready malt taste that gradually caresses the tongue until finishing with a subdued Belgian yeast note with some of the downplayed banana mentioned earlier. Carbonation is medium to low, though the high point of the mouthfeel is the gradual way in which the brew continually reveals itself, as opposed to the typically discrete tripartite view of ""front, middle, finish"". Overall, a very nice quad and a great go-to beer if you want something a little sweeter than St. Bernardus Abt 12 for a readily accessible quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However, this booze did linger and even though I couldn't feel the warmth from this, I could certainly notice the alcohol by the time I finished the bottle off. It's here but the way this was crafted relegated the strength of this brew as an afterthought once the serving was over with. It's a testament to this beer that the teeth behind it didn't come out from the onset. Even though it's crafted here in the U.S.A., you wouldn't know it unless the bottle was in front of you. This was solid from start to finish and worth getting your hands on if you have two hours on your hands to enjoy all that this has to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best American quads I've had. Doesn't quite reach the level of some of the authentic Belgian offerings, but it's not too far behind. Definitely worth picking up a bottle."
""
""
""
"O/D-Not bad. The subtle cherry nuance is actually pretty cool; I'd rather have that as opposed to a cough-syrup cherry overload. Its a pleasant take on the Quad. Probably won't be running back for more anytime soon."
""
""
"Overall - Another one of Ommegang's great brews (I don't think I have ever had one I didn't like). This particular brew is a little heartier than my usual preference, but nonetheless, if I had to choose a full bodied brew of this style, I'd pick this one."
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and heavy on the tongue. Rich, boozy and a bit cumbersome - the love for this beer has always been a little difficult for me to understand."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I thoroughly enjoyed this quad. It is sweet, malty, and delicious. Very smooth and tasty. Give it a try if you get a chance."
""
""
"O: This was a very drinkable quad."
""
""
""
"Bottom line: Not a fan"
""
""
""
"From a 750 mL bottle this poured a deep, dark brown amber. It has a weight in the mouth and a smooth feel. The touch of cherry flavor from the added Liefmans Kriek is, in my opinion, just about the perfect amount to add some sweetness to this dark, rich ale. If you tend to be disappointed by overpowering fruit-forward beer yet feel like you want some sweetness, I would strongly recommend Three Philosophers."
"Quads and BSDA's are more and more becoming one of my favorite styles (and in fact I used to not care for them at all), and this one definitely stands out as one of my favorites. A really solid quad with the added awesomeness of some Kriek blended in. While a little on the pricey side, I would still buy this again."

"O - We did the tasting blind, but we could totally tell which wasn't from Belgian. It's very good, but next to the other heavy weights, it can't compare."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark red-brown body. Excellent two finger light khaki head forms. Very dense and creamy in appearance, a swirl produces some nice lacing and retention as well as some alcohol legs. Aroma of cherries initially, then comes a wave of rich malts, caramel, dark candied fruits, toffee, brown sugar and spicy yeast. A touch of warming alcohol on the finish. Smooth and rich. Taste is ripe cherries, caramelized dark fruits, oak, brown sugar, and a yeasty finish. Incredibly delicious and smooth with all the right Quad notes. The finish has a light lactic twang, almost in the form of oxidation, but its very pleasant and complimentary. Mouth feel is creamy and medium bodied with the alcohol very well hidden. Overall this is hands down the best American made quad I have personally tired. It really does compete with the big Belgian quads."
""
"O: I'm not too enthused by this beer. Maybe quads just aren't my thing, but there are many a beer that I would rather drink. That being said... I suppose it is pretty spot on for the style."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flat and syrupy sweet, are the lasting impressions. Terrible outcome for such a well flavored brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not as good as I remember this beer being when I had it several years ago. It just seems like the flavors don't meld well. A decent beer but I will probably skip over it for some Belgian quads in the future."

"Great quad, the lambic addition gives a relative lightness at points but at 2% I is just enough; but it could have used .5-1% more. It will age amazingly. Both in the yeasty depth and lightness from the lambic. Good now but great later. Overall is just under a 4 but not quite worth it yet."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A really good Quad from an American brewery. Would I drink it again? Yes, if it's reasonably priced."
""
""
"O: Where I am you can usually get a 4pack for around $15 or a bomber for around $10.99. So is it worth it? Yes. this is one of the best sipping beers you will find."
""
""
""

"Great American made Quad. Would really love more dark fruits. Big honey sweetness and Belgian funkiness. The 9.8% abv could be better disguised."

"O ~ I would've loved to see this after 3 years, because I'm thinking I may have been a year late on this. But it was still well worth trying. I've got my eye on the 2011 next to drink one and cellar the rest."
""
""
"Notes; fruity, boozy and sweet. This is tasty but I wonder how this would taste after cellaring for a few years."
"O: Tasty. A good blend of flavors that leaves some warmth in your belly, Three Philosophers goes through, roughly, three phases. Cheery, bread, and booze. The boozy end might be blended better, but it doesn't detract enough to find heavy fault (it is 9.7% after all)."
""
""
"O - Very good tasty quadrupel and very glad I got it. Would definitely age one if I could. This one was bottled 6 months ago so I feel like aging this would be excellent. Drink by date is 5 years later. Only thing I could say about this is I would prefer slightly less carbonation."

"This is my personal favorite quad. Pours dark brownish red with a thick egg white head and lots of lacing. Some quads are dry, others are sweet. This one is on the sweeter side due to the cherry blend. But don't mistake this for a cherry beer because it is merely an ingredient and not the focus. The cherry flavor accentuates the natural dried fruit flavors of the quad. The result is an extraordinarily well balanced strongly flavored beer that is not overly hoppy or malty beer and no hint of an aftertaste. Just beautiful."

"one of the best, a real unique quad. the beer pours a hazy and pale red to brown color, with a huge rising white head courtesy of the belgian yeast. the nose is very complex, some chocolate, sour cherry, funky yeast, and spices. i taste cherry first, but it isnt sweet or sour, sort of neutral in terms of feel, layered in is cocoa powder, peppery yeast, and some brown sugar. lots going on here, and i feel like this beer may have changed a little over the years. real bright mouthfeel, lots of bubbles and a surprisingly dry finish for a bigger and sweeter beer. the alcohol content is barely perceptible at all. overall this is much different than most quads ive come across, and one of the classic beers from the state of new york. id be happy to make a night on this, really tasty, and i figure more out about it each time i enjoy one. not to be missed."

"O - I have grown fond of Brewery Ommegang and even more so recently. This Quad is a Very unique brew that screams complexity with the blending method Ommegang uses. Three Philosophers is unbelievably unique with its complexity yet remaining wise with its tasty character. It's a true work of class from a brewery who doesn't pretend to give you Belgian style ales for the fact that they do give you Belgian ales and quality. I'm definitely putting one of these in the cellar as I know for certain it will sit nicely as time passes on. However I will buy a few more to enjoy now. 3 philosophers is one of the greatest quads ever brewed and luckily the majority of us can grab a bottle of this."

"Overall - This is a nice beer, I would make this a daily drinker if I won the lottery"

"Yumm, yumm. Malted banana nut bread in a bottle. This is a very acceptable and drinkable beer, far from excellent but very good. The first scents of both banana and with a nutty subaroma make this one intriguing. Upon further review as I enjoy this beer, it does hang in to a nice flavor, well worth giving a try. I have developed a big soft spot for quads anyway, so anytime I try one this accomplished and up front I just relax, enjoy and don't overanalyze. The Liefmans Kreik is right there and adds a bit of mystery to the overall finish, Enjoy this one with a friend, it's special, different and I'll comment later on it's aging properties."

"thick and heavy feel in the glass, and overall this is a brew that will fill you up and feel good doing it. it definitely has the belgium tendency, and the addition of the kriek was a stroke of genius. at 9.8% abv, though, you should be prepared before you pop the cork. it is a journey, and while you dont need to drag it out, it is a great brew to savor and appreciate."

"I was a little shocked though by the sudden sweetness and it's consistently throughout. If you are looking for a true taste of hops, you might have to wait a while. Even chilled the Three Philosophers was thicker than I remembered but it is a brew to be savored, not slammed. All in all a really good brew."
"Frothy light tan head over chestnut brown. Aroma is wonderfully complex, with dark fruit and a mild sour note. Berries and alcohol with a deep pull. Flavors mirror aromas, sweet and tangy and sour. Nutty and bready malt is noticeable as well. Each last sip is tangy stone fruit. Medium mouthfeel leaving a bit of a sour residue on my palate. Good carbonation, good froth retention, and good lacing. It's gorgeous to look at, it smells wonderful, and the flavors are well balanced. Ommegang does a great job with this style."

"I honestly can't decide which I like better. The 2009 has beautifully aged and mellowed, but the bright fruit and cherry flavors in the 2012 are quite nice too. The scores are very similar, except the 2009 gets an extra half point each for the exquisite long lasting head and improvement in body. I will definitely age another one of these just to have this debate again. It's win-win."
"Overall: as far as a Belgian style beer I would say its pretty good, smooth and drinkable but not my favorite beer certainly"

"O: One of my favorite quads. Great for taking the chill out of a cool Autumn night."
""
""
"An excellent beer for a cool autumn day, rich flavors of caramel and toffee coupled with cherries are a fantastic way to keep my palate craving more. I will continue to purchase this beer from time to time and will even age some to see how it changes."

"O - Overall, a great beer which combines nicely two legendary Belgian styles in a delicate and balanced way. Highly recommended!"

"This is my first time trying Three Philosophers after passing over it for several years. I like it a lot for what it is, an American take on a Quad. With cherries. It is malty, and even sugary, without being too sweet; it treads that distinction with conviction. I'll be getting more sooner than later."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, 2011 vintage. Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big apple, pear, raisin, prune, toast, toffee, chocolate, biscuit, cherry, molasses, earth, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of big raisin, prune, pear, pepper, earth, toast, molasses, cherry, toffee, chocolate, herbal, and yeast spices. Lightly tart earthiness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, toast, cherry, pepper, herbal, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; with a nice balance of maltiness/yeast spiciness. No cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Quad! Great flavor balance and complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable."

"Overall I definitely love this beer. It's delicious and I'll recommend it to anyone."

"overall - a nice twist on the traditional Quad style."

"O - Used a brandy snifter (closest proximity to the right glass - something I need to remedy). This is a very enjoyable slow quaff, but I'm glad I took the time to update my ""had it"" to a full review, because I believe I was too generous. There isn't as much going on here as I'd expect - it is very good, but it isn't as complex as you might expect from this style. I'd like to try the Kriek base beer sometime."
"Unfortunately the place I had it at didn’t have a chalice or goblet so I was stuck using a regular pint glass. Pours a dark reddish brown color with medium head. The aroma was nice but not as good as other quads I’ve had. Taste was a sweet fruityness with noticeable alcohol and slight bitter finish. Overall a wonderful beer."
"A good beer, but could use a little more complexity. Pours a deep red color with a fluffy white head. Not much detectable aroma, but some slight cherry on the nose. Heavy cherry flavor, but not overly sweet, which is well done. Nothing really stands out here but the cherry and it is somewhat one-dimensional. No spice or yeast as I would expect from the style. Excellent dark red color and perfect mouthfeel. Slight alcohol warmth. Good, but won't go out of my way for it. Doesn't fit the build of a quad that I expect, but a very good beer. Dial down the cherry, please."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into my Chimay chalice, Three Philosophers is a deep cherry-brown red color with a milkshake thick off-white head. The nose speaks of a huge beer with a strong malty backbone with bits of dark fruit and slight burning of alcohol. The flavor follows suit with a very strong malty-alcohol flavor with a backdrop of cherry sweetness and tartness that finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a minimal yet creamy carbonation and as previously stated has a very dry finish. Overall another great beer by Ommegang, I will intentionally go out of my way for anything they brew."

""

""
"O: Really a fantastic beer that age has been very kind to. This beer could definitely go much longer in the cellar. Very rich and great on a cold fall or winter evening."
""
""
"O: Not a bad quad, the cherries add some nice complexity without overpowering it. Has some roasty aspects even though I don't think it actually has any roasted malt. Chocolate and char and smoke in there for sure though. A nice semi-tart and quite dry quad, if that's you thing. I have to admit, I liked the beginning of the beer more than the finish."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic beer. I was skeptical to buy it at first because of the blend, but the Kriek seems to be only a slight addition of it, and it truly does balance the beer out; it mellows out the booziness of the beer that can sometimes mask the complexity that quads should (and mostly do) have. If you see this beer, pick it up. Even if you don't usually like the style, this one might surprise you."

"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, and some slight sour cherry aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight roast flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but fairly strong."
""
"Overall I am just not toally sold on this beer. This particular bottle is around 4 years old but I still don't feel the flavor profile has melded enough. The cherries conflict with the lighter (for the style) base beer malt bill and seems a bit artificial in cherry flavor. almost medicinal."

"cherry flavor. There are notes of tart cherry, raisins, grape, clove, cinnamon, hints of ginger. Some threads of banana bread. There's a lot going on here. I don't know why I never tried this in the past. This is a fantastic Belgian-style ale. Its a blend of a Quadrupel and a classic Kriek. I'm getting some more in the future for sure, especially for only $6.49."

"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and silky smooth. Carbonation is a little above average. Overall, it's a great version of the style. It's got a great range of flavors and they come together perfectly. Very drinkable and flavorful and a classic version of the style."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark reddish brown with a finger length off white head. Some tiny bubbles can be seen rising in the beer. I pick up the smell of alcohol, cherry, and sweet malts. Breadiness is a bit more prominent in the mouth that it was in the nose. The cherries also come through in the flavor pretty well and I do taste the alcohol. The beer is also a bit tart, which is expected since this is a blend of kriek and a Belgian quadruple. The body is full with strong carbonation. The alcohol has a nice warming feeling in the back of the mouth. It's a very pleasant sipper. This is an excellent beer. I would prefer a quadruple that is more true to the style, but this executes excellently."

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Quite unpleasant if you ask me. Fizzy cherries are soaked in alcohol and then smashed in the mouth. The alcohol is unpleasantly mis-balanced, and the aftertaste is among the worst I've encountered. I wouldn't call it sour, more funky and odd."

"Poured from a bottle into a chalice glass. Pours a deep burgundy, brown with lots of large yeasty sediment held in suspension. Very dense. Looks great with a big tan head with medium lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance is the most impressive of this beer. The nose is cherry syrup and it just eats up everything else. The yeast in the background, the malt, all are eaten alive by the cherry on this nose. I just couldn’t get past it. The cherry eases up on the first taste. There is lots of fruit ester, phenols, and of course, cherry. It’s very fizzy, and very big on the palate and finishes quite dry. Maybe some time in the cellar would improve this beer by mellowing out that cherry, but as it was, it just wasn't for me."

"Based on a recommendation by the beer guy I purchased a 2011 bottle. Poured to tulip the beer arrives a fairly clear dark amber with a decent 2 finger off-white head. Good retention and lacing. A lot of yeast particles though, even after proper handling and aging in the cellar. The nose is fruity sweet with cherry as well as hints of toffee, caramel malts, and plum character. The flavor follows the nose with caramel malty sweetness that doesn't display the cherry flavor as indicated with the nose. More fig. Alcohol warmth is noticeable. Hints of banana from the yeast. Full bodied and well carbonated but unremarkable. Overall, this is very average in my opinion. Nothing really remarkable to review and at $10 I can find better Quads."
"This is fruit forward but everything really works together to create a well rounded Quad. Love the cherry presence, while a green banana flavor really adds a layer to the robust caramel malt."
""
""
"This is a brew on a mission. The brewer sought to create a certain style and flavor and were quite successful in that goal. For that a I'll give this beer a 5/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tingly on the tongue. Medium bodied. Dry. A little sticky on the palate and lips."
""
"This beer starts out great, every aspect would start with a high score. But before finishing the bottle, the taste starts to build in an uneven direction. Not quite sure how that happens, but I've consumed four bottles and it was the same each time: I loved it at the start and was ready to put it down half-way in. I'm a fan of Belgian Quadrupels and there are other brands I'm going to score next, this one just didn't do it for me."
""
""
"I think I""m having to downgrade from previous rating (that one, also on tap, at Hobbit Cafe in Houston, rated 4.75). Not sure if it was the varied context this time that has me enjoying it less than before: this time, it was preceded by the sour ""Aphrodite"" that I liked so much, as well as ""Seduction"" (not as much) and ""Art of Darkness"". I think by the time the Three Philosophers came to the table, my taste buds were pretty much asleep."
"If I can remember correctly (and the 9.8% ABV makes it a challenge), this is my third time really sitting down with a bottle of this. I really enjoyed it the first time, the second time I thought it tasted like ""sugary blood"" (according to my notes), and now I'm just not impressed. It's not a bad beer, but it's too sugary for me to really enjoy it. It doesn't help that I've recently had some great Quads."
""
""
""
""
"O- Good. I will pick up another few bottles to save and see how the flavor changes. I was expecting it too be aged enough after 3 years but this was still pretty hot. Maybe in 3 more years. I have a feeling they had it in a cooler for 3 years, maybe a bit too cold to age well."

"O: Cherry overkill"
"O: An incredibly smooth QUAD that keeps me coming back for more! I love the Lambic aspect to put the complexity over the top. A must try."

""
"O: Hmmm... I've had 3P many times before - this one seemed to be a lighter body (not a big bold Quad). Pleasant pineapple notes in the flavor might indicate Brettanomyces Claussini - producing a fruity Brett character that is quite different from the more common Brett. Somewhat disappointed in this particular batch."

"The mouthfeel is pretty spot-on, admittedly. The attenuation level is Belgian-appropriate. The body is in the medium range and lifted up by the active carbonation. It's super-sweet but balanced a bit by the yeast's phenols and spice. Overall, this is an above-average Quad. A damn fine American attempt at the style, but not a great example compared to the revered Belgian inspirations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Quite drinkable at near 10%, appropriate carbonation. Decent brew for sure"

""
""
""
""

"O: Three Philosophers is exciting and anyone with access owes themselves to at least a single. Obviously you're probably not going to drink the four-pack. This is the ideal nightcapper and does what an excellent beer is supposed to do: make you feel alive and aware."

"This is one unique beer. I have never had anything quite like it. It seems to combine the complex maltiness of a quad with the tangy acidity of a kriek. Lots of the maltiness is lost, but it is still delicious. I will keep a couple bottles for a while and see how it ages. My only gripe with this stuff is the price. It must be a difficult beer to make."
""

"Recommend"
""
""
""
"O: I cant figure this one out. In some aspects, it's a great beer, but in the aspect of simply sipping and enjoying it piece by piece, it unfortunately isn't. There's just something hindering its drinkability. Still a very nice drink, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Every time I try this beer I have a different reaction. The first time it was mindblowing. The second time it was a giant piece of crap. This time, it's solid. It's not my favorite by any means, but the ability to blend a medicinal cherry flavor with a Belgian ale is impressive...considering the fact that it never becomes exhausting."
"Overall: Deeply flavoured, aromatic, and full bodied Quad that makes me enjoy every sip. Don't pass the chance to pick this up if its available."
"Overall - This beer is a great dessert by itself. Very rich, complex, sweet, and interesting. Ommegang does a great job with this beer and the nearly two years of age have brought the raisiny sweetness even more to the forefront. The yeasty spice is the perfect accent to this sweetness and really helps this beer shine. Simply fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A rich malty treat; a superb ale I would recommend."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The quad part of this very solid, but I would like more of the Kriek to be blended in on this one."
"Dark ruby red, almost brown. Short off-white head with nice lacing. Pale malts, dark roasted rye malts, brown sugared fruits like cherries and figs on the aroma. The taste mimics the aroma quite well: Pale malts, dark roasted rye spices, sourdough bread and black cherries on the first sip. Hints of chocolate, vanilla and orange rind follow the malty sweetness of the rest of the body. Syrupy, mildly bitter, tangy mouthfeel. Moderate to high carbonation with a medium sized body. Beautiful brew."
"I absolutely love Ommegang and everything they do. What I really want is for the tangy tartness to be lowered ever so slightly, and everything comes together for this one."
""
""
""
""
"O-I think for how available this beer is and for what it has to offer it is pretty incredible. That being said, quads are not really my thing but I really like the touch of kriek added to it. It is an incredibly drinkable beer for what its worth and I am not sure if I would buy it again but I do think it was worth trying."

"“And remember: “philosophy begins in wonder” - Plato”"
""
""
""
"The beer is a pretty shade of ruby with an inch of fizzy, beige head. A lot of cherries in the aroma, followed by Belgian yeast. Smells malty. The flavor is fairly sweet, with prominent cherry juice. Yeast takes a backseat to the sweet cherry flavor. Booze emerges more as I progress through the bottle. Overall, a good beer and one I would have again. That said, this is best only occasionally and in small doses. Cherry flavor becomes a bit cloying midway through. Interesting and worth a try."

""
""
""
""

"O: A very good beer and it's amazing how well the kriek comes through with only being 2% of the blend. I'd like to see how this beer changes after a couple years."
""
""
""
""
""
"Single finger head and not much lacing on a cloudy amber with yellow hues body. Sweet and maple syrup like smell with dark fruit notes. Initially this one is very boozy and bitter but it mellows out some. Still too boozy. Takes away from the dried fruit glavor in the background. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall just too much alcohol taste."
""

""
""
""
"Overall a damn good beer. Not a big cherry fan or I would have rated this a little higher."

""
""
""
""
"O: this beer is great. This is one of the best quads I have ever had. It just has so much flavor and looks amazing."
""
"O: a very nice, enjoyable quad; the kriek mixes things up a bit, but doesn't overpower."
""
"O - I have had this ale many times before reviewing. Each time lends more and more awareness. Complex and wild. I am sure to pick up more flavor specifics with my next bottle. A must try."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful dark orange red color with a voluninous white head. Typical quad scent with dark fruits and a touch of dark cherry. The taste followed the scent but no cherry flavor was present. The mouthfeel was pleasant with a touch of effervescence. Not a bad beer but there are better quads out there for sure."
""
""
""
""
"I was thoroughly disappointed with this beer. I expected something exceptional and got a beer which is average at best. Nothing about this impressed me. Lacked depth and character."
"Not a great beer, at least not yet. I'll save the second bottle for a while and see if a little age makes this a better beer."
""
""
"O- This is a serious beer and it bears that weight literally and figuratively. This is the 2011 version and I believe that ignoring this for several months will yield rewards as the complex components come together."

")- Fantastic beer, easy drinking, the complexity works. It's like Asian cooking (a ton of different flavors working together in harmony to form one great flavor.)"
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The aroma sets things up nicely, but the tastes showcased a creative way to present a Quad. The blend of the malty base with the sweeter and tarter fruit was very nice, and unique for the style."

"Overall, classic Belgian transplant brewery that I am thankfull we have in the US! Obviously, they know how to nail a quad, and they did just that."
"One of my favorite styles. Poured into my Orval chalice, half finger light tan head that retreats faster then a French regiment (I kid). Lots of floaties, opaque deep reddish brown, an ugly beer. Nice bready aroma. I also detect bubblegum, raisin, clove and brown sugar. Reminds be alot of a dubbel I just brewed. The cherry comes through nicely in the flavor but doesn't steel the show. Malty, brown sugar, and cooked fruity sweetness. Lots of yeast charecter in the taste. Not as smooth in flavor as I usually like in a quad. Velvety mouthfeel, a little more prickly then typical carbonation, like liquid candy. Great little beer here, glad I borrowed it."
"o - this beer is solely responsible for my love of Belgian style beers, it introduced me to a style that now represents a large portion of my beer budget and I'm just as impressed by it today"
"Brown with a reddish hue. A fat, white head starts off that eventually reduces to the splattering across the surface. Sweet, and tart aroma. Flavor has some sweetness, sugar and dark fruits, cut very nicely with a little tartness from the cherries, not sour though. Very lively mouth feel from the carbonation, medium bodied. I wasn't sure what I would think of this, as quad's can often be a little too sweet for me, but the presence of the cherries is a great addition and really cuts into the sweetness so it never becomes too overbearing for me. Very nice take on a quad."

"O - Overall, I am really enjoying this quad. It is not at the level of Rochefort 10, but this is very solid."

"two fingers of tan head rise and fall gracefully upon a reddish brown body, head retention and lacing are poor. as luck would have it the rest of the beer is far from poor. big fruit aromas of cerries, plums and raisins lead you to a very well balanced malt presence with flavors of caramel and toffee. and you cant ignore the ever present warmth of alochol. this is a well balanced and very smooth drinkin full bodied beer. this one is best sipped over a period of time. highly recommend this one."

"Hard to believe that after close to 650 beers I haven't tried this one, but here it goes. Pours a cloudy ruby red color, nice thick head.. looks great in the glass. Estery smell with some dark fruit aromas. Taste is medium bodied and super complex. It takes a couple of sips and some real patience to even dissect them all. Prunes, grapes, chocolate, coffee, cherry.. all blended together in a hearty tasty brew. Finishes super smooth a tinge of alcohol. A great sipping and night cap beer, will definitely try it again in the future, worthy getting for sure."
""
"O - Despite not being made in Belgium, this beer represents the accuracy and precision with which Ommegang produces tasty Belgian-style ales. Three Philosophers is better than many Belgian quads despite being US-made and it is definitely my favorite American quad."
""
""
""
"palate: heavy in the mouth, very strong yeasty taste with a little bit of chocolate and mostly fermented and fruity. It is brewed with a little bit of cherry and that is definitely apparent in the aftertaste. not prominent but detectable"

"This beer may be my favorite quad i ever had. I have had several bottles since my first one, and they have such a smooth hint of cherry on the back end with no boozy taste that can be found in other quads. As the beer warms the flavors really start to open up. It poured amber colored into a belgian tulip with a nice two finger head. First sip and i knew i was hooked."
"If I ever win Lotto, this would have a designated spot on my shelves forevermore."

"O: Holy shit! I can't believe how well this beer ages. A fucking treat for sure! Almost five years in the making! Seeing one of my all time favorite quads aged for almost five years is completely mindblowing. Age one and see for yourself. I hope I don't offend too many people with the f-bombs. This is an absolutely amazing revelation!"

"Overall- A great Belgium style beer, not too shabby considering it is made in the heart of NY state."

"I've only had a few Quads before. I'm trying to get into the Belgian Style of beers; most of my focus has been on American brews, so I decided to branch off a little. I have to say, I'm impressed with this style. Very complex and it exercised my palate -- it made me wonder -- what are all these flavors that I'm indulging? I have tried my hardest to describe them, since they are so different than the typical American Style beer; although, this is brewed in America, this has a genuine Belgian taste."
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice quad. It's nice that it is available all over the place and year round, though I wish it was a tiny bit cheaper. At first I enjoyed the taste much more than the nose, but as it warmed up the nose got significantly, as more fruit and cherry came out. Worth checking out, and something I would have again. May buy one to age and see what happens."
""
""
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle, 2011 version into a Ommegang tulip, I can't read the bottles date. This pours a hazy dark tea color with a massive tan head which doesn't last. The smells are of funky and sweet Belgian yeast esters, a hint of cherries, some dark fruit and loads of malts. The feel is medium with tons of carbonation which give it a tingling creamy feeling. The taste is how it smells and it'd excellent, a little dry but full of sweetness, cherries and dark fruit and a tad alcohol burn."
""
""
""
""
"Very delicious beer just mouth full of taste which other beers really don't have this one has a heck of flavor to it.Taste is rich ripe fruit. Sweet with a mild bitter finish. Mild carbonation. Very smooth. I really can't taste much cherry.Smell is really intense, often resembling molasses, chocolate, raisins and rum"
""
""
"Taste is near perfect for a Quad (in my opinion). Very rich cherry and belgian yeasts, some banana, roasted caramel, and oakey notes...smooth yet full of lots of flavors and body. Alcohol is felt in the mouth, but not very intense. Its rated very well for a reason...go get one of you havent had before...in fact, go get any Ommegang; for the most part, they all rock!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark reddish brown with one fingered off white head. Tons of stuff floating in it. Some lacing on the glass. Smells of bananas and plums. Maybe a hint of cherry but not real distinct. Taste is rich ripe fruit. Sweet with a mild bitter finish. Mild carbonation. Very smooth. I really can't taste much cherry. Overall this is good."
""
""
""
"Ommegang seems to have developed a hybrid of Belgian styles that produces intriguing results. Quite an interesting and experimental beer, and definitely one that is suitable for grand occasions budget-wise - although a Belgian Trappist could do just has fine. Recommended a try."

"O: a must-try beer, and I say this even though this beer is not to my usual tastes - the infusion of the cherry kriek adds a sourness and a tartness that is at the very edge of what I will drink. Some may find it too fruity (cherry), but I think it is a classy beer that desereves a drinking. Even though it is not my exact preference in a beer, every time I have one it doesn't disappoint."

"Unfortunately im not finding anything too special about these beer. Very medicinal and the minor cherry addition doesn't do much for it. There's also a bit of cloying sweetness and spiciness after a while. tolerable, but its there. drinkable but id rather have something else."

"O: Another holiday staple in my household. This is a beer that I cherish sipping during the cold weather. Cheers!"

"I like this beer but it was not as good as I had hoped it would be. I was actually hoping for a more pronounced tart cherry flavour. The cherry is clearly there, but that flavour is not unusual in the style and doesn't really differentiate this beer that much. Good but not a standout."
""
""
""
"Recommended."
""
""
""
"I could name a few Quads I like better, but Three Philosophers has a unique and trademark flavor. It tastes distinctly Belgian, but unlike many US attempts at this style, it doesn't just taste like a ""Quad"". And for such a young brewery, this ale might as well come from a recipe passed down for 200 years. A great holiday sipper - I rarely bitch about weather, but it's in the freaking 30's in San Diego right now - this is hitting the spot."

"Overall a style that American breweries have trouble doing. Ommegang does quite an excellent job! Great brew."

"This is a dessert beer, through and through. Sip it, enjoy it, take your time with it. Ommegang is full of quality brews, with a penchant for creative Belgian goodness. That said, Three Philosophers is Ommegang's grand slam...befitting for the Cooperstown brewery."
""
"The cherries really make this what it is, the tartness completes this beer and makes it very good. This is however far from a St Bernadus or Rochefort in complexity."

"Well, at only 2% of the blend, the cherry kriek component does well to represent, spurring other thoughts of comparative low number, high value providers in our cultural midst - I only somewhat kid. I sense here a decent ode to a strong Belgian dark ale, but going all upstart colony with the cherry juicing gag. Once past the academic firsties, I can say that they've succeeded in their melange of traditional Belgian flavours - my oblivious initial confusion slowly turns to gentle appreciation."
""
""
""
"Anyway 3 Philosophers is world class top quality brew. America has brewed its Guiness."
""
""

"O - a silky smooth big belgian, that cherry accent adds an extra kick of sweetness that makes this almost wine like in some ways but still all brew, so glad we have a few from this brewer in town now"

"Overall: smooth, warming. A great dessert beer. Those 3 philosophers really put their heads together for this sublime taste."
"O: A decent beer. I'm not real versed in quads but I would probably buy this again."
"D- Its exciting and different but far from the best I've had. And it certainly doesn't take many of them to feel it."
"Overall – The alcohol was very well hidden and the beer was very drinkable. The taste seemed well balanced, but it didn't blow me away as much as I expected it to. It just seemed to be missing a little something in the taste and mouthfeel department. Regardless, it's still a very very good beer."
"Haven't had a ton of quads, but I would say this is better than some of the others I've had. Really think they hit the mark with the cherries. Nothing too much, but a nice complement to the beer. Would love to try an aged one."
"One of the best American quads I've had. This remains largely faithful to its Belgian counterparts, but the addition of cherries is a pleasant tweak. I'm curious if this would indeed hold up until 7/2016, as Ommegang suggests on the bottle."
"O- This is an excellent style representation with a new twist. It's a go to in the fridge and I have several in the cellar for years to come."
"Overall a great brew with plenty of complexity and one I will always grab when I can. The abv is well masked although it comes through in your head during the second half of the bottle."
"O: I really enjoyed the experience and am now more interested to try more of this variety."
"Mouthfeel is medium to medium-full with that nice smooth carbonation feel that also leaves a little bite on your tongue. Overall, a good brew. Not the best quad I've ever had, but still satisfying. The cherry adds an interesting note to the beer. Definitely worth having around."
"Medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Well-balanced brew that is drinkable. I also love the design and name of this one. I'll have more of it in the future, I'm sure. Recommended!"
"O: This is a very solid example of a quad. I particularly enjoyed the role of the kriek in this one to give it that dark fruit and cherry input. I will definitely revisit this when I can get my hands on it."
"Save for an occasion with others, and spread the happiness of this great beer."
"D - Three Philosophers is an exceptional beer/Belgian Quad. It's easy to drink, has a complex flavor, and is extremely enjoyable. Great brew."
"Overall this was a wonderful beer that you could sip on for hours as the flavor profile changes as the beer warms."
"I hope the Flemish have found this one."
"O: Delicious complexity and a great deal to boot. Let this one heat up a bit. That is, if you can hold out"
"O: I could only wish I lived in Belgium. This bottle needs to be shared with a friend."
"O: Super Quad. Lots of malt and yeast character."
"Overall: For the value minded BA, this is very close to a Rochefort 10, but at a third of the price. I would rate this very close to Rochefort 10 and St. Benardus, of the different quads I have had, this would be my third favorite. This actually has a better head and lacing than the previous mentioned beers, the coloring is closer, maybe a little bit more ale-ish, clearer than the those two. But it does not have the same depth of flavors as a St. Benardus or Rochefort, still a great bang for the buck."
"O: A solid quad that's definitely worth a try."
"Overall: A very nice take on a Quad. Full flavored and well balanced."
"Pours a deep amber red too brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark fruit, but more cherry than anything. In the taste, dark fruit, cherry, and a pinch of alcohol. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit and sweet cherry in the aftertaste. Very easy to get lost in this one, sweet cherry makes it not as abrasive as some quads."
"This pours a hazy copper color with a very small quick fading head and plenty of carbonation left in the aged bottle. Smells of plums, malts, raisins, and sugared molasses. Strong smelling beer. Taste is very nice up front with a somewhat alcoholic finish. Lots of dark berries and plums on the palate with a nice malt backbone. Slow drinking beer but very good tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is a great quad. Aged very nicely but think it could go a few more years to mellow out further."
"A strong example of an American-brewed Belgian-Style quad-in fact, this does a decent job of standing up to its Belgian counterparts, and I can't think of another American brewer that does it better, at least not as part of their standard line-up. Great stuff."
"Nice, smooth body. Alcohol presence is light, but you can feel it. A really nice beer, but the bottle size and alcohol make this a one off."
"Overall a very interesting beer that I'm glad I was finally able to try. Very complex - I definitely will drink it again!"
"O: First Quad, really enjoyed it. Will have to add this to my shopping list."
"4, 3, 3, 4.5, 3"
"O- A very decent brew and one that I could see aging. A few tweaks and this could be very tasty."
"O-not an outstanding quad, but it is a very good beer. i'm enjoying this a lot. its a little more cleaned up than many of the Belgian quads, though maybe not as complex. it doesn't have too many negative qualities. overall, this is a decent cheaper alternative to many quads."
"Overall, a bit pricey ($16 a 4 pack), but I like. It's a decent quad with added fruitiness from the kriek."
"Poured into a pint glass (sorry, didn't have a clean chalice). The pour was dark amber, almost red with a creamy, tan-colored two-finger head. Lacing was thick and clingy. The nose was leaning heavily to the malt side with some phenol notes detectable. The taste included some subdued clove with a touch of cherry. Not malty at all as I would have anticipated from the smell. I didn't detect any alcohol in the taste, either. It was medium bodied with higher than average carbonation. Overall, not as much punch as I had expected from a quad, but not bad."
"Poured this beer into a tulip Duvel glass. The appearance of this beer is very nice. It looks like a hearty reddish brown, with noticeable yeast and large bubbles of carbonation. The nose is complex, and changes as the beer the warms. It is sweet and spicy, figs and nutmeg, with the slightest bit of caramel. The alcohol and bitterness is up front followed by a balanced spiciness. Definitely some ying and yang, going on here. Good beer, will drink a few this winter."
"overall - tons of dark fruits, caramel, bread, and toffee. Haven't had many quads but this is fantastic. Extremely complex. You gotta love when the smell of a beer is similar, yet different then the flavor. This beer works on all levels for me."
"O: A great beer for sure. It's unique and unbalanced. Different from any other quad I've ever had...but quads are all pretty different."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a fine, understated carbonation. Easy to drink, not too sweet and far from boozy."
"O: Another good brew from Ommegang. I have enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It is a simple beer in some aspects, but is complex enough to capture your attention. It does not overwhelm your senses, and pack quite a punch. If you are not careful (or if you like it that much...) it can get you pretty tipsy by itself. You can pair it with a hearty meal, or drink it by itself."
"I wasn't satisfied for the price and the hype."
"From the home of the baseball hall of fame comes this exquisite and unique rendition of a Belgian ale. A really caramel-sweet aroma leads to an extremely complex flavor with a full mouth-feel and finishes in grand fashion. Careful though...this beer packs a punch to the tune of 9.5% ABV so definitely not for the light-weights!!"
"O: Not as boozy as I remember from past experiences with fresher bottles; I think the age mellowed this one nicely. Went amazingly well with a steak from the grill."
"M: Full body, rich, surprising fine carbonation."
"O: This is one of that beer for me- the one that turned me into a craft beer lover. Definitely one of my favorites and I recommend it whenever someone asks what's a good beer. One of the best quads I've ever had."
"O - Wow. If God is a beer drinker, this would be in both his fridge and his cellar. It would be hard to improve on this brew."
"Slight cherry flavor, large fizzy cream colored head which recedes quickly. Dark amber brown in color. Smells great--malty sweetness . Tastes great. Lots of delicious sediment in the bottom. Lots of lacing. Really smooth full bodied ale. This one is so complex, I love beers like this. They are hard to describe but simply awesome. This one is worth seeking out."
"Recommended Music Pairing - Jimi Hendrix - Band of Gypsies"
"I'd drink this again but maybe I'll wait a few years, pretty fresh Quad but I'm stoked to see this on the shelves in Alberta"
"Overall - Medicinal beers are a bit rare in our household and this was balanced enough to be very enjoyable though the yeast seemed a bit much for the malts."
"T: Brown sugar, fig, raisin and a bit of booze. The mouthfeel feels a bit thick, but the beer manages to come off feeling light. Not sure how they pulled that one off."
"Overall i did not like this beer when i tried it fresh a few months ago but this bottle i have been sitting on for 2 years has turned from an overly sweet mess to an amazing beer."
"O: Complex, unique and enjoyable."
"4/5/4/4/3.5"
"D: Enjoyable bouquet, higher alcohol volume. Easy to drink."
"After encountering 3P on several more occasions since my initial review, I have raised some of my scoring. I find 3P to be insconsistent from batch to batch and my initial impression was likely made from an off batch even though now I can appreciate the beer only slightly more. Cheers."
"D: It's okay at best, due to the alcohol. I would never have more than one of these. I bet it's good with a cigar."
"Overall it is a great beer. I could see myself buying this beer in a store. It was very pleasant and satisfying"
"O: Big flavor in a big beer. Very enjoyable brew. Would definitely drink again."
"I feel that the best way to have this beer is on tap. That being said it is definitely advisable to ""sip"" this beer because it is equally strong and thick. Almost has that abbey-ale feel to it with that cherry flavoring added in to make it drinkable."
"O- Have sat on this for atleast 6 months. Now I have to run out and find another."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with thick tan head. The smell is slightly sweet dark fruits a hint of booze. The flavor is a little Belgian yeasty flavor followed by a big dark fruit and alcohol presence. The mouhfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Not a stellar representation of the style but a veery good one none the less"
"Much passed over; too-rarely purchased. Three Philosophers has always been available, and now that I know how high-caliber this is, I’ll be purchasing more often. A fantastic Belgian dark that I imagine would benefit from some cellar time."
"A very cloud head. A nutty, clear color almost clarifying itself after being poured. A nice sweet olor with an essence of a balance toast and smoked, honey and fruity. Spectacular flavor. malty, a hint of oaked caramel. A balance between light and heavy. Excellent mouthfeel, letting you know that it's balanced and you can drink it without problems. Wonderfull Quadrupel."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, and feel it could be outstanding if aged. Highly recommended."
"D: very tasty brew. my opinion of ommegang has gone up immensely lately. maybe im having most of the hits, but its seems like everything the put in a bottle is delicious. this might be my new favorite."
"O: Definitely a sipper, and good with food. Sweetness and alcohol get pretty overwhelming and need to be cut but something sharp and/or vinegary. I was a little annoyed when I looked at the bottle and saw ""cherries added"" but I am pleasantly surprised. Really tasty beer, and different from your average Belgian in a nice, refreshing way."
"O: I wish my palate were advanced enough to describe this. An amazing, incredibly balanced beer that has to be tasted to be believed."
"Simply brilliant."
"O - A solid offering from one of America's premier Belgian style brewers. The sourness from the Kreik addition really matches well and balances the sweetness of the malt. A solid yeasty flavor, a good mouthfeel, and an excellent and complex scent make this a reliablely good brew."
"O - a most unique brew and something worth a try. Not something that I would want all the time, but a most delicious and unique treat."
"O - Warming, strong quad with a hint of cherry. Im a fan of quads, krieks and sours so I liked this addition."
"Overall: A complex and unique beer for sure. This is a slow sipper to be enjoyed over an extended period of time. I had no problem finishing the bottle with two separate glass pours. Ommegang hasn't disappointed me yet. I really enjoyed the Kriek style."
"I had high hopes for this beer, but it didn't really deliver. The alcohol needs to be toned down a bit so the cherry plays more of a factor."
"O: A very enjoyable and unique version of the style with the addition of the kriek. It wasn’t as bold or complex as the greatest of the quads, but I loved drinking this nonetheless. This would age nicely, and I may have to re-review after I sit on a bottle for a couple years. I bet the alcohol would become more integrated and the flavors would become deeper."
"Overall-I prefer this over St. Bernardus. The light tartness adds that extra ummmphhh that I like. The lower carbonation level really lets the flavors shine as well. Great beer."
"The taste is excellent, this bottle progressed very well. The sweet fruit flavors, especially cherry, are still dominant, but lacking their sharp edge. The dark fruits and chocolate get their chance to shine on the finish. There's a nice backing provided by the yeast. The alcohol sometimes present in fresher bottles has now completely mellowed, this is now a super-easy drinker. The mouthfeel is solid, it's lightly carbonated and goes down very smoothly. The drinkability? Off-the-charts. This brew just goes down so easily, any hint of alcohol this beer presented is completely gone, making this one very dangerous. Overall, I'm very happy with this beer. It's just straight-up delicious."
""
"Overall--Kind of surprising alcohol presence, considering the strength of the other flavors. Even when warmed up and creamy, alcohol presence is strong. I was a bit dubious about the presence of cherries here at first, but it is not at all dominant, and adds very nicely to this beer's complexity."
"O: Well balanced malt sweetness with sour finish. Alcohol is never overpowering, but evident. Very great Quad."
"Overall, a good beer. Alcohol is well masked by the complexity of flavors. This has benefited a bit from aging. Of course, Ommegang knows that as they have cave aged this beer. Could age this longer before cracking it open."
"This beer is quite impressive: It has a balance, feel, and flavor that are very engaging and, almost contradictorily, very comfortable. I can't imagine a way they could have brewed this quad differently that would have improved the final taste. I think that's one of the marks of a really great beer, which this certainly is. It should not be missed."
"THREE PHILOSOPHERS HAS MADE ME A BELIEVER"
"O-- to me this is still the bar standard for US Quads. Like the addition of cherry to this, as it adds a fruity dimension to this. Thin taste besides cherries but the mouth does pick up the beer."
"Good balance, good carbonation, refreshes. ABV there but alchohol flavor not noticeable. Very good, I'd have this again."
"overall: a very mellow Belgian-style quadrupel, well developed in all aspects, well balanced and not overbearing, high abv without the punch of the taste, very enjoyable."
"O: I think this is just average for a quad, honestly there's nothing here."
"O - The noise is disappointing, but the flavour is excellent and will not disappoint."
"O - Best beer I have ever had. There is no way that anyone could NOT love this beer. I wish it was more affordable because I would make it my one and only. Made it 4.5 overall just because of the price factor."
"overall really wicked oustanding beer i need to keep one of these all times as a special treat when i want to reward myself for good beer"
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"Overall, this is a really good beer, and I'm glad to have picked it up. I bet this would only improve and mature if cellared, but its pretty darn good either way. I will undoubtedly pick this up again, especially at a decent price tag."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking brown color with some red highlights. The head was a bit foamy at first but settles quickly. The smell of the beer was lightly acidic but had a sweet fruity quality too. The the taste was a little tart upfront but then shifted into a yeasty dark fruit sweetness. The mouthfeel was decent and and drinkable. Overall I would drink it again, especially now that it comes in 12oz. bottles."
"Pours a crimson red with thick creamy white foam that settles out. Malty plummy smell, some cherry. notes. Taste opens with hint of sour cherry, then evolves into a belgian yeasty taste. Ends sweet. Good carbonation. Tasty belgian, complex and fruity. Good use of cherries - in there, but not overt."
"Quite a nice quadrupel. This isn't my favorite style but I enjoyed this one. Very well-balanced and drinkable in spite of its noticeable ABV. I'd probably pick this up again given the chance if I were in the mood for a quad."
"Three Philosophers, Belgian Style Blend, 2011 at The Office in Summit, NJ. A business trip has just gotten sweeter with the hint of cherry in this Cooperstown, NY brew. I would definitely recommend this beer for a lazy summer night. It is NOT on the light side with an excellent balance of strong flavors. This brew has a rather sweet finish reminiscent of summer nights. Cheers."
"O: I hadn't expected to like this beer as much as I did: I was afraid that the cherries would be less subtle and integrated and that the beer's sweetness would be too much. The drinkability is high for a beer of this abv."
"O: A solid brew well worth the $4 spent!"
"This appears to be one of their “Flagship” beers so I was perhaps expecting a little more intensity, not that it is by any means an ordinary brew. There is a lot here to enjoy, it just did not wow! me in the way I expected. That being said I would never turn one down if offered to me."
"O: A very nice malty quad and a solid choice for an evening sipper. Alcohol is well hidden. Would be good to pair this with some food, as it's a hearty brew to be sure."
"Overall this is a great quad, to be enjoyed very carefully. After a few you can solve the worlds problems."
"D/O: This beer is a well-intentioned American-brewed take on the quadrupel style, worth a comparison to the more well-distributed Belgian standards. The involvement of cherries is evident, and does enhance the overall product. Acidity is a factor and could be less assertive, while less carbonation would help to make for a smoother and more velvety texture."
"(Forgive me if this sounds redundant. This is a copy of the review I wrote for the Village West Discount Liquors newsletter, Kansas City, KS.)"
"O- I was expecting this to be sweeter and more distinct flavors. However, this wasn't the case, in my opinion. It isn't as sweet as say, Rochefort 10. It's a good beer in the end."
"Overall - It was good, but not great. I have had better Quadrupels (from Rochefort) and better overall beers (Hopslam). The taste was very similar to the other Quadrupels, but not as strong and not nearly as sweet and pleasing near the end of the sip. I am going to be trying th Ommegang Abbey Ale next; let's hope that one blows me away."
"Overall / Drinkability: A slow sipping beer for savoring by itself, although I think it would work well with dessert. Interesting beer and worth trying out. Really impressed with the appearance and smell, but more sour than I expected."
"Overall: Excellent rendition of a classic Belgian style, honestly I think this is better than Rochefort 10. Lower abv probably helps it not get too boozy."
"Overall I am not really that impressed by this quad, but it's certainly a good passable brew. Not for me."
"A really good quad overall and well worth trying."
"This is a very nicely balanced brew. The cherry flavor is minimal, but in great balance."
"A very well rounded quad at a decent price. It's not mind blowing, but it will not be a disappointment at all."
"O: To me, this is every bit the little brother of Rochefort 10. It’s great, but not quite as thick, not quite as warming, not quite as flavorful. It’s more of an everyday beer, and I’m more than ok with that. If I ever, and I mean EVER find this on-tap, you can be sure that I’ll be at least two or three glasses deep by the end of the night. This stuff is great."
"O: I don't overly enjoy this beer. The reminders I get of a cough medicine totally taint the quality of this beer for me. I believe it is a well crafted beer and very respectable, but I just don't go crazy over the taste. I wouldn't mind if I never had this one ever again. This is my second time with it and I remember not enjoying it very much the first time."
"Very nice quad, perhaps a touch on the ""too fruity"" side--if I had to pick something"
"Pours a hazy burgundy with a fine, small layer of white bubbles for a head. Complex aroma of yeast, spice, and fruit. Roasty malts in the taste, with flavors of cherry, plum, brown sugar, cloves, and rum. A little boozy, but not harsh. Medium mouthfeel, can be a bit syrupy. Can be enjoyed cold or closer to room temperature. Highly complex, highly recommended."
"Overall, a nice beer. I could drink a lot of these and find myself in trouble!"
"Wow another brew that i dont see too often im loving this lately anyway the brew pours a semi see through mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head that quickly recedes to a few islands of froth,the smell is aromas of whiskey,cherries,peated malts,brown sugar and alcohol,the mouthfeel is very smooth medium bodied and well carbonated and has tastes of whiskey soaked cherries,xmas pudding,dark fruits,peaty malts and finished with a sticky date finish and overall a very unique drop and very true to style."
"First impression is a bit of a letdown. Color is an average brown with a bit of amber tint. Small film of head forms and laces a bit. Smells fruity and sweet with a bit of must. Has a classic Belgian feel to the nose. Palate is sweet and tart with alot of different flavors meshing well. Cherry and spices from the yeast come to the forefront and the alcohol is felt in the finish. Medium bodied with a dry mouthfeel. Very flavorful and quite drinkable for a beer of this strength."
"D: Very nice, med-large bodied beer. Sip slow, enjoy cherry flavor to fullest."
"O- A good quad that has some great flavors of dark fruit. The cherry comes through and is balanced nicely with a slight spice."
"O: This is a great brew, and for the style and ABV, it is remarkably smooth, solid beer."
"Overall - A really great beer. This brew had the pleasure of being my first quad a few years back ... always a nice treat whenever I drink it."
"D - I like this one."
"Well, this beer could definitely go longer. I'm only sad I don't have a fresh one to bust open & compare, but that's not a very good idea on a school night. ""Sorry, can't come in today, too much Philosophizing last night..."" Hey, that might work! Excellent quad."
"Final thought - this beer has a nice ABV, great taste and is very well balanced. Great beer"
"Overall, this version seems to be more boozy than the 2009. I say ""seems to be"" because I did not check the notes from my 2009 before I reviewed this 2010, and I did the 09 review several weeks ago. One thing this version shares with the 09 is the ability to improve as the beer temp rises. Good Stuff!"
"O: Quite nice. Very different take on the quad style, but very satisfying and worthy of revisiting often. Ommegang always does well, and this is no exception. Take note, the mouthfeel is truly oustanding, and that really helps the flavors come through."
"O: A different take on a quad, the cherries change the flavor profile, but in a good way. Sort of a cross between a Belgian and a light lambic/sour. Would be interesting to see it with a few more years on it."
"Overall - this is the type of beer that made me fall in love w/beer. It's a big beer, an intense mouthful. If you're looking for a Belgian style beer to try though, this is a pretty great start. One of the better ""Belgians"" that I've held up to my lips."
"Quite nice but yet to reach its peak. I like the cherry aged blend and hopefully that remains as the rest of the beer mellows."
"O - My first and favorite Ommegang beer. I had this at Easter with family and some sliced manchego with fresh chorizo. Just a perfect pairing that made an exceptional beer even better. A true sign that america can make quality belgian styles."
"The beer pours a medium, clear brown color with a large cream-colored head. The aroma is a strong mix of Belgian sugar, yeast and dark fruit. The beer smells outstanding. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of dark fruit (mainly cherries) as well as some yeast, alcohol and dark candy sugar. Very sweet and fruity tasting beer. Very well balanced and very tasty. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A great American-made quadruple."
"Pours a murky mahogany color, moderate cap of khaki head, sporrty retention and some lacing. Scent has strong notes of banana and bubblegum, sweet watery fruit, brown sugar and fresh yeasty bread, moderate amounts of spice and peppercorns. Taste leads with the banana and bubblegum, but not as strong as the nose would dictate, quite malty sweet with notes of brown sugar and carmel and fresh yeasty bread, light peppery spice, watery fruits such as plum, moderately bitter finnish underneath the sweetness. Despit being medium bodied, felt watery at times, lingering sweetness on the palate. A nice, strong, bold quad that would probably age nicely."
"D -- Solid brew, worth a pickup and a revisit. Very interesting and complex."
"Overall - This beer is what is great with beer blending! The cherry taste may throw some off, but works well in this beer. This is a true dessert beer and I would give this to any fan of late harvest Zins/Chards."
"O: Overall a decent quad--a bit too hot fresh and the yeast seem to dominate the flavor despite decanting the glass, but one of the cheapest out there and better than many more expensive versions I've had."
"O - Not bad, but I feel like they were going for more than they should've been. A nice beer to try, but being a HUGE fan of quads, I was a bit let down by what this could've been."
"D: The flavors were nicely balanced. The sweetness combined well with the slight tartness, and it's dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Great brew overall."
"Overall this is the best American Quad I've had yet far.... although I wish it was available sans cherry juice, or with less cherry per my preferences."
"Definitely worth a try or two. It's its own beer, which is huge. Nice sipper."
"O: A really solid quad - especially if you like cherries!"
"Overall: This beer actually exceeded my expectations going in. I wasn't sure whether or not the Kriek addition would be to my liking, but it seems as though the blend was quite judicious and the unique quad character was preserved. I will definitely go back to this one again in the future!"
"O) Three Philosophers is an excellent attempt at the Belgian Quad -- a very competitive class that includes the greats from the Trappists & the Abbeys."
"Thanks to Mr. Klain for the export of this from USA to Spain. I've been trying my share of quadrupels from Belgian while over here and it's nice to see that we have some superior Belgian style to look forward to when I return home in 2013. Pours a dark brownish red into my Affligem chalice. Mild head, certainly nothing too crazy and some mild lacing. Didn't check the glass for wetness so maybe I detracted from the head others write about or maybe the cork got beat up on its journey?! Smell is what I like about belgian quads - brown sugar figs apricot and plums I suppose. The alcohol is prevalent in both smell and taste. Tastes great- some of the belgian yeast, alcohol is prevalent, dark fruits, and a tad sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and warming (alcohol). Overall, I would try again and recommend to friends. Recommended for promotion and retention."
"Lots of head action, four finger head that overtook the top of the glass, causing me to take drastic measures to keep from loosing good beer. Head is dense light brown foam, with moderate clinging lace. Color is a 27 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is crisp, and has aromas of chocolate, honey, fudge, roasted coffee, apricot, and pepper. Taste is intense, with flavors of caramel, molasses, green tea, licorice, pepper, and chives. The flavor is remarkable and wonderful blend of melon, green tea, clover, watermelon rind, licorice, coco, rye, and overcooked lamb. Mouthfeel is a great experience of creamy and prickly flow over tongue and soft palate. This is one of my top 10, great for the price, good buy itself or with cheese and prime beef."
"D - I keep finding new flavors with every sip, and the beer takes on a completely new character as it warms. You just want to sit down and sip on this all day."
"Great atmosphere. Nice appearance including a decent head and some fair lacing. Nose is not strong, but a really well-done combination of grain, wood, and cherry. Flavor, similarly, is a great combination of yeasty grain tone, and a subtly sweet cherry. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"O- Overall, This is one of the best American quad that there is imo. It rivals the Belgian Quads that have been around for centuries. This a total A+, in my book."
"O: More of an after dinner beer for me."
"D: Strong alcohol presence but it is paired nicely with the fruity taste. This is my first quad and I will certainly be revisiting the style."
"Overall, this is just an excellent quad. I really love cherries in beer, so that makes this even more enjoyable to me."
"I like the label here...its classic and simple. Pours a pretty reddish amber color. It is somewhat cloudy but that doesn't affect the overall experience for me. The head is off white and a little frothy. The aroma is a little bready and also the cherries come through. The flavor is complex: cherry, biscuit, apricot, raisin and ripe fruit in the backend, a hint of of toffee? The finish is bold and lingers for a bit, and maybe there was just a hint of strawberry? I think this beer is a classic and I'm so proud it is from NY. I especially like it when barrel aged in caves."
"Definitely worth trying. Maybe not my favorite of the style but an interesting take."
"this was a very tasty beer, good, balanced flavor. Wouldn't mind having this again."
"Overall a superb Belgian Ale with the sweet flavors meeting the bitter ones very nicely with just a hint of alcohol. Not one flavor in this brew overpowers another, giving you a tremendous taste."
"Very tasty with a definite but not limiting alcohol presence. I'd prefer the flavor to be skewed just a touch more to the tart side, but I ain't complain' too loud...!"
"The CPJ"
"Very oakey with a strong alcoholic flavor. Not much fruit, but very acidic. I would have liked some more sweetness for this variety."
"Drink- I enjoyed this alot. Would have it again with some age on it. Was a quick drinker. It was a bit small but had good balance and flavor."
"D: Pretty tasty ale. The ABV makes it a nice stay-home on a cold day type beer. The cherry aftertaste was quite enjoyable, would drink again."
"D: If it wasn't for the alcohol you could drink these all night long. Pair with pork dishes, vanilla ice cream or panna cotta."
"Good beer. if it wasn't so strong, i'd drink it all day."
"D - A heavy and enjoyable sipper."
"Drinkability - I'm sure that this brew has a tremendous following. A bit much on the alcohol flavoring for me however. Not something I would want over and over. It's definitely a ""sipper."" A little too much of the wine characteristics for my liking. I want a beer that leaves me wanting for another sip. This beer did not provide that for me."
"Drinkability - Enough of this and you'll numb your gums. Not a session beer by any means, but very drinkable for its style."
"Pours a dark ruby brown colour with huge light tan foamy head into a tulip. Lacing heavy along the glass. Nose is Belgian yeast, caramel malts, dark fruit; figs & plums, light fruit; grape & pear. Buttery and phenol auroma lingers. Taste follows the nose; big malt and yeast flavours, dark fruits provide some bitterness / tartness. Heavily bodied mouthfeel, leaves a dry sensation. Big abv. here limits consumption, though pretty standard for the style and one would want to enjoy and warm over a period of time."
"Pours a gorgeous, slightly cloudy mahoganny reddish-brown, with a buoyant three-finger head that slowly dissipates. Smell is fruity with that typical Belgian yeasty aroma. Taste is a very nice malty sweetness with cherries and other dark fruit, backed up nicely by a bit of alcoholic punch. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated but smooth. Overall, delicious, and very drinkable (though at 9.8% ABV, gotta be careful)."
"*I may revisit this beer in a year or two as my palate refines"
"D - Not really my type of beer."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable especially if alone. I plan on pairing this with a slice of sweet chocolate cake in the future just to see what happens."
"While this isn't my favorite quad, it is a fairly unique and delicious. Easily one of the most affordable quads too, under $10 for a 750ml bottle."
"Great , very drinkable beer, alcohol very well hidden, loved it !"
"I like this trappist style Quad"
"A kinda dark red that filled my perfect pour glass with an ominous presence. The aroma had cherry with maybe some winter spices thrown in. The taste, extraordinarily robust. There's that cherry you can pick out from all the malty alcohol. The flavor borders on overbearing, but becomes much more acceptable as it warms up, I'd say that slightly chilled is the ideal temperature to serve this at. The body is thick but not chewy. It leaves very little tartness on the way down. I'd say let it warm up and this becomes a great brew."
"D: The cherries was the thing that made this American Quad great - the balance between sweetness and dry bitterness was great. Usaually I find the Brett instantly, but here I had to read the label to understand that some Kriek-style beer was an ingredient. Really interasting beer - try it!"
"Simple and sweet quad with some cherry tartness and a rich mouthfeel. Delicious, though a bit too sweet for my particularly tastes."
"Well balanced, nice that the sweetness is modest."
"Boulevard take note - This is how to add cherries to a quad. BBQ is a FAIL compared to this."
"Lengthy description of the beer and how to pour on the bottle. Poured into my Ommegang glass, the beer has a beautiful dark brown color and a two finger head that gradually fades away. Plums, figs, cherries, and alcohol are present in the aroma. Taste is comprised of the dark fruit from the smell, with some raisin. The cherries make a subtle appearance, and they complement the taste very well. Mouthfeel is light bodied, and probably the weak point of this beer. Drinkability is dangerously high as the ABV is nearly hidden. Great beer."
"Poured into my Karmeliet Tripel glass, with a 2 finger off white head of fine bubbles that resides fairly quickly after a minute or two. When held to the light it is deeply red and lacing is minimal. Cherries and currants are apparent in the nose with the aroma of yeast on the back end. First sip begins tart but drops to a sweetness. Overall the taste finishes dry with some heat on the back end probably due to the 9.5% alcohol. Yeast makes the texture that much better and the tart dryness blends well with the malt. For being a quad this beer is dangerously drinkable and doesn't come off too fruity despite being blended with cherries. Great beer overall."
"D - Really tasty stuff. A great combination of warming alcohol and depth of flavour on a beer that drinks easy and looks great."
"Very fine, high-quality, thoughtful, complex beer."
"Lovely dark amber color but the head was not as creamy as I anticipated (this may be due to tap settings). Nevertheless, wonderful complex flavor! I was afraid the Belgian Kriek (cherry lambic) would be overpowering, but it was present with wonderful subtlety."
"I also recently had an aged Philosophers from 2008 on tap at Blind Tiger. Very smooth, creamy, subdued. I enjoyed this 2011 super fresh and new version better, believe it or not!"
"Drinkability: Some may not like the cherry flavor, but I think it's what gives this excellent Quad it's edge. Very tasty and easy to down a 750 ml bottle in one sitting. Although at 10% ABV, I'd probably stop my session after one big bottle. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"This beer blew my mind, you better sip on this one."
"I had pretty high expectations on this Quadrupel as it is from the Ommegang brewery which I have heard and read so much about and this Quadrupel, a bottle from 2009, happens to be my first beer from Ommegang. In general, the flavors were very good, not yet great, but the mouthfeel failed to hold up effectively. I am not sure if the blame goes to age though 2009 is not exactly ""old"". Will revisit with a fresh bottle when the chance comes by."
"D: The slighty sour and bitter finish makes it more difficult to enjoy for me. It just tastes like a belgian that has been infused."
"*** Edit on 2/18/11 (original 2/2/11): Had a couple more of these and I am even more impressed than originally. I am bumping my smell and taste reviews from 4.0 to 4.5 and my drinkability to 5.0. This is definitely going to be one of my favorites. I was actually saddened when I got the bottom of my last glass. Maybe a trip to the NY brewery is in order?"
"An overall good beer. Cherry on the nose, dry finish, but great drinkability. A mild beer overall, but the more you think about it the more complex it seems. I could drink a lot of this, although I prefer more of an IPA myself. I purchased a growler on a whim, and do not regret my decision."
"2011 bottle. Dark ruby color; clear. Thick tan head. Smells like toasted bread, yeast, sweet fruit, and a little bit of the cherry. Taste is very malty. Caramel, and yeast. Some fig and raisin. The fruit flavor is a cross between cherry and apple cider, a little bitterness but also pretty sweet. Some of the alcohol comes through as also. Big body; kind of sticky. Very nice drink."
"D: While I loved the layers of complexity that the cherry added, I think that this beer would improve dramatically with a bit of age on it. I think that the sometimes harsh/medicinal cherry notes will round out a bit and push this beer to greatness."
"Sweet taste with spices. To be honest i could not taste the cherries. One the many good qauds i have tasted untill now."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into heavy chalice glass. Pours a deep brown with garnet tints and a super tight beige head. Aroma is loaded with fruity esters that fill the room before the first sniffs even transpire. Plum, prune, dates, raisin, caramel, toasty sweet malt, molasses, brown sugar and light fruity notes that seem to proliferate with the accompanying of some mild alcoholic warming notes. Fruity esters that showed up in the aroma make a similar impression in terms of the light fruit flavor profile. Dark fruits, however, take the day with nearly every facet making its respective way in the swirling dark sugar torrent that is so prevalent. Dark syrup like sugars are complemented nicely by a wholly evident alcohol note that warms the nasals but doesn't detract from the experience. Palate is effervescent with lots of bubbly prickling amongst a high viscosity torrent. Mouthfeel is thick and quite rich- even chewy with warming booze and an ever so slight roasty dryness. This is only very subtle, though, for the overall theme of the finish strays away from attenuation and presents itself with a sticky smacking fullness. I was pleasantly surprised by this American example of a style that American brewers rarely edge out the Belgians in..."
"D: As mentioned, Three Philosophers is a complex, sippable brew that in my opinion was a good value for the money and fine example of a Belgian style quad. However, this one lacked just a tad in the drinkability due to the aftertaste; I'm glad I shared this bottle as it is unlikely I could have finished the full 750ml without going to another drink in between."
"I don't find this beer to be very drinkable. Honestly, it doesn't go down too easy for me, but it is more of a sipping beer to enjoy over the course of an hour. I bought a 4 pack and didn't drink the last beer until a month and a half later. A good beer to try, but I don't think I'll be buying it again."
"I really like this beer, but I wish they would ramp down the alcohol just a tad. The alcohol up front really dominates the beer, however. There are some sharp fruit flavors that is followed by a smoother caramel flavor. But I am still bothered by the almost overpowering booziness of the beer. Great stuff, nonetheless."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a murky mahagony reddish brown color with a tight light tan head. An interesting aroma; a mix between cherry fruit, grape, plum, slight smokiness, alcohol, caramel, and an almost bubblegum type note. Medium/light mouthfeel. Wow! This thing has quite the boozy punch. The booze really takes away from the other flavors for me but it still is pretty nice. Sharp fruit type flavors up front followed by a smooth caramel flavor. Some roast type notes as well. Hmm, it's flavorful but for me, as I said, the booziness sort of dominates this beer."
"D - Outstanding beer. I enjoyed sipping on this one for about an hour. Really comes to life once it's warmed up a tad."
"D: High. Thoroughly enjoy this beer, and would gladly quaff it all evening long."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but was not impressed as I thought I would be. I enjoyed Hennepin and Rare Vos more, but this is still a quality brew."
"A very good beer that I recommend, not the best of the style but an example to be revered, well done!"
"D - Not only do I know I've positively reviewed this before (one of the first great beers I shared with my Dad before he passed) I remember it being much, much better than this time around. A little boozy and cloyingly sweet, the 12 oz bottle doesn't seem to have the same greatness the 750 does."
"Overall this is a nice complex yet pleasant beer. Could see this one aging very well. Going to have to pick up another to set aside."
"D- A great drink but I wished for more chocolate, coffe, toffee tones. All-in-all I will buy it again and age it. I think this beer will be awesome with some age behind it."
"Nice Job Ommegang!!!"
"D - A touch boozy but very drinkable for a quad."
"Drinkability: Very smooth drinking and tasty, and also very well crafted. However, I don't really see what the big deal is. It's a great beer, but on par with and similar to other Belgians I have tried."
"D. for a beer that is almost 10% it goes down nice and smooth with very little alcohol burn"
"D: Something this rich and complex is one to savor."
"Poured from the corked 22 into my Ommegang glass. It came with the gift pack. Medium black with some brown foam and nice lacing. Smell was malty and roasty with the slightest hint of cherry. Taste was also malty and roasty. Mouthfeel was bit thick and drinkability was good. The alcohol snuck up on me. Nighty night."
"d 4 this is clearly good beer but some of what these philosphers were trying to say must have gone over my poor head."
"D: I tried this on tap a few days after being quite disappointed by a bottle serving. I usually prefer the taste of bottle-conditioned beers being served from the bottle, but this seemed quite a bit more appealing to me on tap. I'll give the bottle a re-review some day. The draft serving lacked the carbonation and alcohol burn that turned me off from the bottled serving and seemed maltier which I enjoyed. It seemed also to have lost the slight cherry taste it had from the bottle, but this could be due to the bar serving it too cold. I tried to let it warm up but had a hard time resisting. All in all an enjoyable quad but unlikely to be a regular choice for me."
"D- Definite sipper, but smooth and sweet. Slightly creamy, Take it slow and this is a treat."
"Personally, not my style. It is a very strong tasting beer that works well as an apertif for after dinner. I could see this being a decent dessert beer. Something chocolate would compliment nicely I think."
"After drinking my second Three Philosophers I had to come back and increase my ratings. The balance of sweet malts, spice and alcohol is really impressive and delicious. I'll get this again very soon. I will also reach out and experiment with other quads."
"Decent drinkability, it's not a session beer but it was very tasty. Dry bitter finish that was almost sour and left a pucker. Would definitely like to try this beer again, and even pair it with cheeses or food. iT was very good, but not great."
"D- Quite. I'll have a second...or a third."
"it would be great with duck and its great with a good dark chocolate."
"Overall, I was expecting way better. People seem to overly hype this beer for some reason, not just from reviews but from other people I know. This beer is the worst Ommegang offering that I have tried and I won't buy this one again."
"I capped this one to save the nice carbonation and in the hopes that I would drink it later to get the value of the bottle. But I haven't returned to it. It's just not that appealing. Sorry, Mom. Still love you!"
"HV"
"Not too harsh or bitter on the palate. Great brew."
"About as good as it gets from a balance standpoint- I enjoy warm as sipper or a bit more chilled as a drinker. It is also very predictable. Maybe being located relatively close to the brewery helps"
"I would highly recommended this beer. It very complex and would par well with a strong blue cheese. I had this in a sniffer and a touch warmer than i would have cared for."
"Overall a good beer and interesting beer but less complex than I was hoping for. Very sweet but interestinly funky"
"D: I maybe biased because I love this style, but this is a wonderful beer that I really enjoyed."
"Quite enjoyable this one was. I'll pick this up for a diversion whenever I feel as if I need, well, diverted...."
"A true personal favorite!"
"Another spot-on Ommegang beer. I wouldn't say this one is in the same class as St. Bernardus, Westy or Rochefort, but its cetainly in the top 5 I've come across so far. Awesome stuff!"
"D - I've had this before and I think it's a wonderful beer. I think some age would make this beer even better."
"M/D - Medium to light body, thought it would be heavier for the style, but has good use of carbonation. Finishes sour on the palate and the alcohol is nowhere to be found other than making you feel light on your feet after drinking a 750mL bottle. Sums up as really good flavor, easy to drink, and a great twist on a Quad."
"This beer is to be savored in smaller servings."
"This beer pours a deep brown color with a ruby tint when held under light. Thin, tan foam and little lace. The aroma is chocolate with hints of banana and toast. Well balanced. It's flavor is mainly chocolate with raisin notes and is again well balanced. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and filling. While meant to be sipped it would be hard to drink more than one at a time. Ommegang Three Philosophers is a very good beer, highly recommended."
"I know this is quite an accomplishment to find such a good mix between a quad and a lambic but this is not what I expected. was looking for a quad with a hint of cherry and got a sweet cherry mess. not a huge fan of the sours but trying not to let that ding my rating. interesting experience and glad I tried it."
"Tastes like black cherry and brownies. Black forest cake beer. Typical bubbly yet creamy Ommegang carbonation that they do so well."
"The beer pours a rich blend of mahogany and maroon, with some ruby spots shining through upon direct lighting. The off white head is monstrous, filling top half of the glass. Retention is great, and so is lacing, even for a style where I expect a bit of each. I took 3 Philosophers out of the fridge and served immediately, and cold the kriek comes through very strongly, cherry and earthy notes. It takes a long time to open up and let the caramel, plum, and fig notes really shine through as well. The taste rounded into shape much sooner, and Ommegang really did nail the blend of quad and kriek. Sour cherry is a slight, but very welcome addition to the standard quad flavors. The only thing holding it back is some alcohol on the close that passes from a pleasant warming to a bit of harsh heat. The mouthfeel is superb, a rich and full body that stops short of stout like viscosity. The carbonation seems muted at first, but by the time it hits the back of my tongue it's exploded, refreshing my palate and highlighting some of the otherwise more background notes (specifically some of the spicy yeast phenols). The aforementioned slight booziness hurts the drinkability some, but other than that it's a great beer, and the cherry kriek blend helps distinguish it from most of the rest of the quads."
"D: Not quite as boozy and overly intense as I remember, but something I'd still have a bit of trouble drinking a significant quantity of."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber/red with a very light tan head that hangs out for a while. Smells of cherries up front followed by malts and alcohol. This is a truly well-balanced beer. The alcohol is there (and it packs a punch), but the drink managed to stay smooth and not too sweet. The cherry lambic does add a bit to the sweetness, but when later revisited discovered the tartness it brings to the table. This beer will warm you up. This is easily one of my favorites, though it's out of my comfort zone of dark brews, I'll be coming back to this one until its pulled off of the market."
"As a New Yorker by birth and a Belgian in spirit, Ommegang has long been at the top of my list of must-try American breweries, and needless to say this beer did not disappoint. All this beer needed was a French/Dutch label and I would have been convinced it was an import. The deep yet pronounced flavors mixed well with the beer's high ABV, making it a great example of the style. Top-notch, no question about it."
"Bottle. Pours hazy dark red with a small, short lived head. Nose is very fruity, sweet malt and alcohol. Full body with sweet malt, brown sugar, yeast and cherry flavor in the beginning, with floral hops pleasantly kick in the finish. Wonderful beer."
"Can't believe I haven't tried (or don't remember having tried) this one before. Wow. Super complex, unique, smooth and balanced. I like that the finish isn't dry, but I'd like a bit more sweet maltyness...No I wouldn't, it's great just the way it is!"
"M/D - Quite light bodied and pleasant on the tongue. The drinkability suffers slightly because of the carbonation. A few sips in and I am already feeling the carbonation building up within. Still, it's a great tasting beer that is definitely worth trying. I will be picking up some more of this on my next run to the US."
"I love quads, but this one isn't my favorite. A fine brew to be sure tho, no complaints. If dry is your thing this might be the quad for you."
"Not bad, just not a great Quad style example. If you make a couple great ales and at least one standard Quad - then sure, have fun with a blend like this. But don't make this your one Quad entry."
"I am going to have to remember this one for New Years. Would rather toast to beer than to champagne and this beer would really fit the bill."
"D: Very drinkable. Needs to be sipped to enjoy the mouthfeel and aftertaste. This one is going into by beer cellar. Want to age it and try it again. Definately a good beer."
"CHEERS, OMG-ang"
"Drinkability suffers from price, and a little from alcohol content. I enjoy Belgian Quads, but their high alcohol and smooth taste are a deadly combination. . . Best part about this beer is the availability."
"Really enjoying this beer. Saved this to share with Dad."
"Wonderful tasting, this is reminiscent of Troegg's Mad Elf, one of my favorite Christmas beers. Cheers!"
"Overall: Had this on tap at a sports bar (it was the only thing worth while on tap) and am very happy I did. Easy to sip, but the alcohol is deceiving, so I suggest pairing with some cheese or pizza (that is what I did), because 3 of these bad boys went down very easily, and the alcohol content caught me off guard in a good way. Cheers!!"
"Ommegang, what a nice find for me. To the rest of the BA world this is old news, but to me it is a wonderful brand new find. For the money this may be the best quad i've had. Poured from a 12oz bottle in a Duinen chalice. Lovely Dark red amber in color with a nice tan head which quickly recedes into the glass. The taste is awsome. Fruit, cherries. I'll buy this for as long as I can."
"I'm happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought this beer. No regrets. However, I won't be buying this one again but would never turn it down if offered to me."
"Drnkability: This is definitly a sipping beer, because it will sneak up on you. But tasty and very enjoyable."
"Poured a hazy brownish-red from a 12 oz bottle with ABV on the label. Nice thick head which slowly dissipates to a thin head that stays. Aroma is predominantly cherries, with hints of yeast and alcohol. Delicious brew, taste is again predominantly cherry with the ABV masked very well. Smooth, silky finish with excellent lacing. A solid, solid brew from Ommegang, very highly recommended quad. Just be careful, the smoothness and delicious taste makes you want to have more, but the ABV will hit you before you know. Cheers !!!"
"D- Given the high ABV it is quite drinkable. I probably wouldn't reach for another immediately after due to the ABV but outside of that it isn't too much to handle more than one of at all. Overall I wouldn't be in any hurry to buy this beer again."
"D: I picked this up in a gift set with a BPA and Triple Perfection and the chalice I mentioned for about 18$ which wasn't terrible at all. I would get this again on a chilly night when I'm in the mood for a sipper but I wouldn't see myself buying it regularly. A for sure special occasion beer."
"Pours a deepish red with a pillowy Belgianesque head. Slightly cloudy from the small amount of yeast that pours at the end of the bottle. Aroma is of dark fruits, caramel, sweet malts, and Belgian yeast esters. Flavor is complex and well balanced. Lots of dark, rum soaked fruits, plum, and figs. Caramel and toffee. Sweet graininess is present. Some sour cherries are noticeable, and the flavor of the cherries increases as the beer warms. I let this one warm up to room temperature and it was fantastic. Alcohol is amazingly well hidden and this is a very drinkable beer for the abv."
"Overall, quite an interesting and flavorful beer."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Great fruity sour taste but not so far away from just a great beer. Very easy to drink and would recommend to pick up a bottle!"
"D: This ale is very drinkable for the higher ABV, but I wouldn't have more than one. Something isn't working here for me, maybe it's the Ommegang glass with the gold ring around that came with the beers. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but I think the glass tastes too much like metal to me, I'll have to try this again with a different glass."
"Served: November 26, 2010"
"D - Yes but don't think you are going to have a few. This is a great sipping beer. I wish it got colder in Florida. My ass would be outside getting a chill and chasing it away with the warmness this provides."
"D- Drank about two-thirds of the bottle and think that was about all I needed. Excellent sipping beer. I have just started getting in to this style and am really taking a liking to these belgians."
"OA - A great beer. Started a night with it and intend to start many others similarly, given the taste and texture. Overall, A-. A damn-near exceptional brew."
"D- I found this to be very easy drinking. The 10% was there, but it blended in with the drink tremendously. The biggest downside of this drink, was that the flavor didn't last as long as it could have. I wish it had more follow through. Aside from that it was a great quad, especially considering that it's an American take on Belgian beer. It is true to the style, and a quality brew. I wouldn't pass this one up."
"D - This certainly isn't a drain pour, but I am kind of disappointed. I hadn't had this beer in a couple of years and I remembered it being much better than this. The aroma is spot on, but the flavor is dissonant and unpleasant. The spicy yeast character seems inappropriate for a dark belgian and it clashes with the cherry. Maybe it its just that this beer is better in the bottle or maybe it has lost something in the last couple of years, but it seems like a shadow of what I remember it as."
"D- not a style of beer I usually drink but am trying to expose myself to. Enjoyed the smoothness and complexity, high alcohol was blended well in the taste and detectable by my fuzzy feeling face after consumption. It worked as a great slow sipping compliment to my slow paced reading."
"Drinkabilty - Not a beer that you would want to drink with a quickness - The more it warms the more the caramel toffee notes come out - very drinkable"
"Wow, at 9.8% it feels a bit boozy, but all in all it is a fantastic beer. The combination of dark sweet malts and tart cherries is outstanding. I'm glad that I have another one of these in the basement."
"This is a big rich quad and amost sweet enough in caracter to have with dessert or even as a sipper."
"Notes: YES!!!"
"D - Alcohol is present in the flavor and the sweetness can be overbearing. Not for everone. I'm had plenty of 10% beers that were far better at hiding the alcohol, but the alcohol taste is actually an improvement to this beer adn adds a bit to the flavor, making it a touch warming. I'm left a bit disappointed overall, I thought this might dethrone Hennepin as my favorite Ommegang brew, but it falls short."
"D - Easy drink; goes down smooth; great beer to sit down and enjoy a nice dinner or a round of brews with the amigos; I could definitely have a couple more"
"A great after dinner beer, along with a Rocky Patel Vintage cigar."
"mouthfeel: heavy, mild carbonation"
"Drinkability is only average with a high ABV like this one. But it's worth every sip."
"Overall: quite good. A very solid quad but I prefer it with some age. I certainly recommend this if quads are your thing, as it is an interesting take on the ""style."" Cheers!"
"Drinkability surrounds the evening's activities. Not a session beer, and two of these beers is more than enough. Take my advice, if you have friends that don't like beer, but enjoy red wine....bring this to your next snooty box social."
"D:I like this beer.It's interesting,It has a good burn to it.It keeps you guessing.And it's very easy to drink!"
"D: This is a nice beer for a dreary rainy or snowy day. Warms you up on the inside. For me, one to two in a sitting would suffice as this is a sipping beer."
"Pours a dark red/amber with little head.  Smells are the darkest of fruits, some yeast, alcohol and some malt.  Tastes are plums, cherries, yeast and alcohol, pretty damn hot.  Mouthfeel is kinda thick and drinkability is slow, definitely take your time with this beer."
"D: Thick in body and flavor profile. Definitely goes best with food."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The taste for the ABV is certainly great, but it's an assured sipper that really sneaks up on you."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and is just a little too carbonated. Overall a nice beer and an interesting twist on the standard quad. For the price its hard to beat and of Ommegangs lineup."
"Overall, a nice and flavorful quad, but its not overly in your face or complex and suffers from that a bit. Certainly a good beer for the proce, just not a standout."
"D - Fairly bold, but very drinkable. The tartness helps to cover some of the alcohol taste and stays crisp."
"D - For being almost 10%, the alcohol blends well with all the flavors so it is easier to drink than some beers with a similar abv."
"This beer has a fantastic malty bouquet with hints of cherry. It's a great bouquet,, and I would suggest the pouring instruction on the bottle be followed. The bottle I had didn't have an exception amount of yeast settlement by any means. Flavor very much malt driven with cherry undertones and strong yeast flavors. Well balanced with great structure. It's a malt bomb, with an almost buttery mouth feel. I love this beer. I must admit that this is my first Quadruple, and my my first from Ommegang. I am impressed though, and it was worth the four dollars I payed for it. I recommend it."
"Overall: Just a so so quad IMO. Not overly impressive. I expected this to be better."
"Taste - 8/10. I'd have to describe as creamy, large, and very heavy on the 'fruit'. Crispness not so much, but again much so on the cream dept. Good beer overall, just not my favorite. Definitely a decent Belgium, but again, not the best I've ever had. Drinkable 100%, but didn't really leave us talking about it."
"D-not for sessioning, but a wonderful nightcap"
"I first had Three Philosophers out of a 750 mL bottle, and wasn't cultured enough at the time to actually enjoy it...but even then, it tasted amazing. I bought a four-pack of 12-ounce bottles for about $16, and I think that was a pretty good deal for this brew. I think I might try aging one or two of the bottles, just to see what would come of that."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is just under medium, carbonation is about right and leads to a bit of a peppery alcohol finish. This beer is nearly 10% ABV and honestly, I can tell. However, it seems to fit the beer about right; the other flavors mix well with it. Overall, nicely done quad by Ommegang."
"Drinkabilty - Not bad, it cant tounch trappist 10 or chimay but its solid. I wouldnt run out and but again, but its decent."
"Pours a nice reddish brown with a light tan head that stays around at about half a finger and leaves some good lacing. Nose brings forward subtle hints of cherries along with some light caramel and dark fruits. Hints of molasses. The taste really doesn't bring much cherry flavor at all. Really, I can't detect it, and it was faint enough in the nose. The taste does bring some Belgian yeasty esters and some caramel. Good, sturdy body that is slightly creamy. Not nearly as complex as I'd like to see, but pretty good overall."
"This beer pours a dark red color with a fair size head that perisisted through out. It smells strong and there is a strong cherry smell. The taste is very complex, very heavy full flavor, cherry flavor really stands out. The flavor stays on your paletee and theres nothing wrong with that. Overall amzing, loved it must try."
"When poured from the bottle this brew produces a thick head with a slight reddish hue to it. The color of the beer is a truly phenomenal red color that is very cloudy. The overall appearance is a thing of beauty and only alludes to the overall quality of the brew. The first taste produces nice cherry hints which can also be smelled as it is being drank. Overall it is a great beer but lost points for me in the drinkability category because of the strong taste. I know this taste is precisely what the brewers at ommegang were going for and thus i cannot fault their genius. Hats off to ommegang once again."
"Overall- This is a great desert beer. Definitly a one and done, but you will want to revist this again and again."
"Absolutely delicious. I highly approve of this beer. Whereas some beers of this style may try to blow people away with flavor, this one has a nice harmony between two flavors which go together quite well."
"Drinkability- Yes but not too much, it was a good beer at first and a great beer after about a half hour, I just don't think waiting that long for it to develop deserves too much. I would recommend it however if you've never tried, it is worth a visit."
"Another brew I felt I had to revisit. It pours a ruby-tinted russet topped by a finger of ecru foam. The nose is a menage-a-trois of black cherries, rye bread, and dried wheat. The taste begins with the wheat, burnt this time, then moves into a solid helping of slightly medicinal cherry. If it weren't for that bit o' cough medicine, this would have been great. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a somewhat sticky feel. Overall, a solid outing, but falls a bit short of gem status."
"This bottle pours a deep red color that borders on mahogany. There is no real foam. The aroma smells strongly of oranges in addition there is a cough syrup like aroma that is rather strong for my liking, but the pleasant aroma all together with the orangy booze is rather nice. The taste is really nice. There is the bready, banana yeast flavors that would be expected in a Belgian style. The mouthfeel is pretty darn smooth no harshness or bitterness from the alcohol like you would expect. It's pretty drinkable and an overall solid brew. I think that it's quite a nice brew overall."
"Overall, I really enjoyed it. I wish I had more of it, this was simply a left over bottle from a while back. I really enjoyed the experience and it was neat to try the specific vintage. A truly delicious brew."
"Cheers.."
"Drinkability: Another great beer from Ommegang. This one is certainly a sipper but definitely enjoyable and something I'll look for again."
"Tastewise, this is complex and nigh quaffable. I'm impressed by the cherry flavor coming through so strongly without it being cloying or saccharine, but the great yeasty mouthfeel and bitterness balance makes it so, so enjoyable."
"pours a dark copper/brown color with a staying 2 finger head with nice lacing looks good..smell is cherries ,fig,plum,raisins, ..taste is a market of fruit with cherries first then plum and other currant fruits..its really creamy and sweet very tasty..mouth feel is full and robust so much fruit mixed with sweet caramel lots of kriek flavors and candy so smooth and tasty..one of my favorite domestic quads"
"Odd profile, the malt and spice of a quad with a hint of cherry - creating almost a cherry cola note. Booze wafts up in the nose especially but time has obviously mellowed the flavor - earth, spice, toffee, quite dry almost astringent, touch of booze still in the finish, cherry but it borders on fake/syrup. Not all that impressed but it's hard to call it bad. Good carb for style, lush but not prickly."
"In the mouth it is quite creamy and soft, and goes down easy enough for the circa 10 abv. The buttery joys of this mouthfeel are rarely felt. The taste lingers for awhile, so it is a slow drinker despite the good taste."
"My first Quad...thanks Kirk from work!"
"This beer is a dark reddish garnet color with a small amount of just off white head. The beer smells of Belgian yeast, plums, and a bit of cherries. The fruityness is what is most prevalent in the taste of this beer. Plums and dried cherries dominate. The alcohol is very well hidden. Good medium to heavy mouthfeel with solid carbonation. A good drinkable belgian beer with definite replay value."
"Overall: An excellent beer overall. The style doesn't get much better if it's not brewed in Belgium."
"Cheers..."
"Then again, it helps when they're the home team. Well done, lads."
"D: I enjoy a bottle of this on certain occasions. Couldn't drink much more than that."
"Drinkable given its percentage and mouthfeel, the cherriness has really mellowed out nicely and made it a nice addition to the great qualities this beer already posseses."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - i suggest drinking it sip by sip if you dont like cherry beers i dont find they taste like robitussin this beer doesnt get they taste unless you drink it like you would any other beer"
"I dont usually like belgian beers this much but this is really, really nice."
"Notes: I feel like I need to review this one again. My other Ommegang experiences were good, I waited to try this one last because I love Quads. I gotta say, it looks like a quad, it smells like a quad, but it did not taste like one, or have the same mouthfeel. Maybe I poured it wrong and it lost a lot of the elements because this one had no head whatsoever. I have another one that I might age for a few months and review again. I refuse to believe this score, but it will have to do for now."
"Overall impression: i love this beer! body, smell and flavor of a excellent quad style."
"Delicious, syrupy concoction."
"Taste is zesty, sweetish with light spiciness, lots of fruit and port up front, light tartness in zesty finish with long woody-toasty grain and dried-fig-skin aftertaste."
"D: A really nice brew from Ommegang. The cherry character is a bit understated, but that's generally a good thing in these types of beers. I wasn't blown away at any point, but I've enjoyed this beer."
"D- An absolutely top notch beer. This is one of my new favorites. The complexity of this one just propels it. A well made beer."
"A great interpretation of a Belgian quad, really loved how all the components came together."
"I am so impressed with the brewery and what the have to offer with the 3 philosophers. My first time trying it was at their brewery tour, however, there is a huge difference between tasting this beer in a 1oz. dixie cup vs. a full 12oz glass. This beer takes time to mellow and reveal its true character. You will not be disappointed with this beer."
"This pored into a chilled pint glass, with a red tinted color and nice white fluffy head, that holds for quite some time. the flavor is quite pleasant. The hint of cherry from the 2% Lambic makes for a great compliment to the ale they brewed. Being a fan of lambics my self, this makes for a excellent brew."
"D- It's not fair to give this low marks here considering that ""drinkability"" is not really supposed to be a feature of this style. However, the intense cherry flavor makes this a drink that you'll probably only want one of even if you like to knock back a few huge, dark, complex malty ales in a row."
"D: OK this is not a session beer... one and done. The cherry notes are heavy but not as bad as some cherry influence brews I've had. Overall worth looking up.... Not quite my cup of tea but other may love it."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty smooth, its almost tart. Its mostly sweet, the cherry tartness is interesting. Not my favorite beer, its odd. Not terrible just OK."
"Wow, this stuff is good. A very nice quad, with a nice hint of fruit from the kriek. A truly superb beer."
"Overall, I love it! This is absolutely a beer I would recommend to everyone, and would be a fantastic beer to use to introduce to new comers who are interested in Belgian beers. Its much easier to drink than it may seem, and it is thoroughly enjoyable. I am willing to bet that it will cellar exceptionally well, however I would also bet that I don't have the patience to find out, unfortunately! If you are enjoying this with food, I would stick with deserts to best pull out the sweet cherries and chocolate. In such case, try it with a flourless chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, Chocolate Cherry Trifle, or really anything with either chocolate or cherries in it!"
"I am not much for words, this I can hardly call a beer though. It is incredible, I truly love the smell and how smooth this beer is to drink. Definitely a sipping beer, not something you will want to drink down as fast as you can. Take your time and enjoy..."
"D: Considering the strong flavor and alcohol, it's good. A sipper for sure, but a great beer."
" This smells and drinks like a wine, but mouthfeel is definitely beer. Carbonation hits the sides of your mouth then swirl to the front in a sweet frothy cream - the feel is excellent. A very drinkable beer - especially for the alcohol content."
"D-this is my second time having this beer and it keeps getting better"
"Very aromatic floral and spice. Malts and fruits are evident. Alcohol permiates the nose. Taste: Grains and alcohol make a splash right away, then is met with the sweet fruits and malts. Cherries, raisins and more alcohol remains for extended stay, warming with every sip. The mouthfeel is part of the taste. The carbonation expands on the palate and opens the taste buds, exposing the flavors. Creamy and velvety. Easier to drink with every sip as it warms and the initial shock of the style settles in. This really good. I like the cherry ale blended in. Pairs nicely with beef or lamb."
"I've fallen in love with this beer again after some time away. Sigh..."
"D: it drank really well and was a decent quad offering that tasted legit but honestly didn't have a big kriek flavor and nose like I thought it would; it was still tasty."
"Pours dark copper color with one finger off-white head. Head dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma - deep yeast, sweet malts with hint of fruits (cherry and apricots perhaps), warming alcohol. Taste - sweetness upfront, very fruity and malty, alcohol hidden very well, slightly bitter finish. Full body, very rich smooth quad. Extremely drinkable for ABV. Probably one of the best quads I've ever tried. Great brew!"
"Taste: My wife's words: it tastes like a chocolate covered cherry. True that. Cherry is very noticable. The effervescence adds a bit of an odd MF, almost makes me think dry at the end- though it isn't. Alcohol flavor becomes more apparent as the beer warms up, but still quite delicious. I've not tried a fresh bottle yet, but that will definitely be something I pick up on my next trip to total wines. Mf is pleasant. Beer is not heavy at all, and effervescence is pleasing aside from the odd sensation it lends to the beer."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle. Sampled on August 5, 2010. A hazy amber pour with a generous, fluffy, silky tan head that lingers and laces beautifully. The aroma is full of floral hops and a pleasing mellow maltiness with a little spiciness. Smooth but bold mouthfeel. The taste brings out the cherry and the hops more than the malts but it also brings out a noted alcohol flavor, which takes away from the overall experience for me."
"D: A slow drinking beer. but still i would have a couple of these of the course of the night. i enjoyed this beer. something good right here."
"Drinkability - This is easily a sipping beer based on the flavor, the body and obviously the ABV. I may have to pick up a few bottles for the cellar."
"A wonderful offering from Brewery Ommegang. I fist sampled this beer at the brewery a few days ago, and I highly recommend to anyone to take their tour. It was a good experience."
"D - An excellently complex Belgian-style, quite delightful. I have been saving this beer for just over a year and it was worth the wait. I'd be happy to drink more of this."
"D: For a beer this strong, very drinkable."
"Deep dark ruby red. Creamy bone colored head starts out thick but sticks around as a thin but solid layer of cream. Dark fruits and dark rich cherry aroma. The flavor follows the aroma almost exactly. The same dark fruit and cherry, along with some sweet brown sugar. Downsides are a slight metallic taste and the lack of dimension - the cherry and sugary sweetness keep the malt complexities from being noticed. Finishes sweet and a little thin."
"Drinkability is good, though I wouldn't drink more than a couple if I had major plans. This is a delightful offering from Ommegang. Cooperstown knows Belgians."
"jd"
"D-Surprisingly good for a quad.The insistence of the cherry flavor might be it's only drawback."
"D- a solid belgian quad, the alcohol is present but not overbearing, the flavors mix well even if the smell doesn't make it all that attractive, overall a nice beer worth picking up again"
"Drinkability: Nice, alternative take on a Quad with the addition of cherry. Personally, I may have enjoyed it more without the cherry, but personal taste aside, this really is a great beer."
"Pours a amber-brown colour that starts off with a lot of head, but it quickly dissipates without any lacing. Smell is cherry, plum, raisin and faint Belgian yeast. Taste is a bit tart. Has the cherry that this beer advertises, but not enough of everything else I'd expect in a quad. Carbonation level is nice. A tad boozy, but I still had no trouble finishing my half of this bottle."
"I could down easily down the whole 750ml bottle, but this beer deserves to at least be sipped frequently instead of outright chugged."
"D: If you like sour cherry taste, there is nothing to stop you from drinking this. I wouldn't take another one for free..."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this offering from Ommegang, and the whole 750ml to myself had me buzzed to a great point that didn't go away for a few hours. I drank it while I watched the MLB All-Star Game, and finished it before the 4th inning and I was feeling it well up until I went to bed."
"pours a deep reddish brown with a finger of beige head... middling retention; strong lacing. aroma is of cherries, plums, yeast, alcohol. taste follows the smell, except - and maybe this is me - you lose some of the yeast characters evident in the nose. some caramel and muted spice notes. mouthfeel is medium bodied with prickly carbonation. pretty drinkable and worth trying - interesting take on the style with the lambic addition - but imo not on par with the upper echelon (i.e. belgian/trappist brews)."
"2008 brew. Deep red amber pour. Light head. Strong wine aroma -- alcoholic and fruity (cherry). Flavor comes in two stages. The primary stage is malty cherry and dark fruit. The secondary stage is alcoholic -- with a cherry base -- with some limited floral hints. The body is of medium thickness. The flavor and aroma are sophisticated and complex and lead into a delicate finish. If philosophy is an intellectual method of elucidation compared to a scientific doctrine of propositions, then beer philosophizing is too an activity that clarifies our thoughts of the fine brew. The Three Philosophers quadrupel exemplifies this activity."
"D: Although pretty easy to drink when it warms a bit, this beer remains around 10% ABV...and I can taste it. Its flavorful, surprisingly tart, sweet, and a bit boozy. 12oz is enough, but I am enjoying every bit of it!."
"Drinkability suffers from the hotness. I have a 2006 bottle in the cellar and will re-rate, but this beer just falls waaaay short of the legends of quadrupel fame."
"D- if I really enjoyed this beer I could have two or three no problem. This is a well crafted beer Just not my thing, dont think I will ever be picking up another bottle"
"Drinkability - very drinkable, i'm about to drink this entire 750 and will def want another..."
"M & D - Nice and crisp and very well carbonated. Drinkability is good in terms of flavor but ABV is high."
"Served from bottle into a La Chouffe tulip. Pours a dark brown with a 3+ finger off-white head that subsides to minimal after sitting a bit. Maintained nice lacing throughout. The only aromas I could pick up on were fruit wtih a trace of alcohol. The flavor followed the smell with only fruit and alcohol showing up. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not bad for a quad. It was very smooth and drinkable. I would definitely purchase more and drink it again."
"All-in-all this one is very satisfying."
"O: Such a pleasure to drink! What a unique beer. It's satisfyingly rich but isn't cloying or heavy. Lives up to the hype. Curious how it will age. Can't imagine it getting better actually, as I like how the flavors are now and don't see them improving with time."
"Definitely worth a try, an outstanding craft brew."
"Pretty good beer, will probably pick up some more."
" ~ This is a good beer. I have a feeling I'm drinking this bottle at a somewhat premature state. I have another bottle cellared that I will enjoy a few years down the road. At that time, I'll offer some more details."
"Delicious beer, could not be happier with it."
"D - Fairly drinkable though not overly so. The sweetness becomes a bit much after a while. The aroma, flavor, and look of this beer are enough for me to buy it again though. If anything, buy this beer so that you can LOOK at it. It is a marvel to see."
"Bought in a 25.4 ounce corked bottle. Bought refrigerated. Poured into a tulip glass. Head covered two thirds of the glass. Smell strongly yeasty. Dark caramel color. Taste is fruity with a moderate level of carbonation. Definite aftertaste of cherries. Smooth. Highly drinkable"
"Three Philosophers is artfully crafted blending rich malt with flavorful accents such as chocolate and cherries. For me it tasted like a chocolate covered cherry with liquor infused into it, which I do not find very appetizing but I can appreciate the complexity and subtleties of this Belgium style brew. I feel that it had great length from start to finish and the taste lingered long after my last sip. The color is a deep red with a nice rich head. With a slightly aggressive pour, the nose opens up and the aromas are exactly as they taste. The texture is very smooth, slightly thick and easy to drink, perhaps comparable to Guinness from tap but much larger in complexity and body. I believe that it would pair nicely with fruit or chocolate as an after dinner drink."
"The nose is a blend of spice, dark fruit , a mild medicinal cherry character, a little Brett and warming booze. The palate is fruity, mildly brown sugar, honey, cherry, a little paper. A touch watery. 3.5/3.5/3.5"
"D: A really nice-drinking Belgian Dark Strong that is a fantastic sipping beer.. spread this one out over an hour or so, as the character really comes out on warming."
"D: This beer is a pretty strong beer. I do like this beer; however, I would probably only drink a couple in one night. This beer would be a good starter beer for a pregame for a long night."
"Pours a cloudy crimson mahogany color with a thick foamy head. The aroma is understated, but notes of yeast and a dry cherry sweetness are discernible. The flavor is more of the same with notes of dried cherries, Belgian yeast, and grapes. The flavor is not overly sweet with the big cherry presence, though, and it has a bit of tartness to contrast the sweetness. Not quite as big in flavor or body as I would expect from a Belgian-style quad, but an interesting, flavorful, and satisfying beer nonetheless."
"You can NEVER go wrong w/ Three Philosophers, one of my all-time faves. Recommended to anyone who enjoys well crafted beer. The best use of cherries in a beer that I've come across. The availabilty is nice too."
"All in all an exceptional brew and one that on one should miss"
"This was delicious, and I highly recommend it."
"Drinkability - I will no doubt seek this out again. I have been drinking this for the past forty five minutes or so and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Honestly, the cherry taste in it just makes my day. This is a great tasting quad and for a style I have not really enjoyed in the past, this has made me look highly upon Brewery Ommegang. Very drinkable for such a high abv and very enjoyable."
"D: Smooth nice drinking ale. Even with higher alcohol it goes down well."
"Drinkability - This is a very good beer that has a style of it's own as far as most other Belgian style beers I have had. The dark body and taste give it a very rich, full bodied flavor that lingers for a while. This is a good beer to sip on, but I'm not sure if it's something I could drink a whole bottle of in one sitting."
"Drinkability: While I really enjoyed all the aspects about this beer, it sits a tad heavy and the higher ABV definitely made itself known by the end. I really think 12 oz. is a great serving size of this as it allows for moderate indulgence, so when I do crack my '08, it will HAVE to be in the presence of friends."
"Granted, I don't know if ""Quadruple"" is even a real category, and if so, whether or not this fits the style. It's simply ok. The flagship and the Hennepin are far better."
"Pours a cloudy amber brownish color with large off-white fluffy head and good lacing. lots of fizzy carbonation. smell a slight floral, fruity, hoppy smell. cherries are very apparent in the smell and taste. carmel nutty malt hints as well, very sweet. sour chalky and slightly bitter finish. medium body and creamy texture. fantastic beer i was very impressed with. waited a while to try this beer because it is available everywhere i go for beer. i will most definitely be purchasing this fantastic brew again in the near future."
"D- This beer is good, but I'm glad I shared this two others. I usually compare all categories of my reviews I can to other beers of the same style, but this is my first quad- so I must say, I'm not sure how this one should drink per the style. With that said, I would love to have again (quite often actually!) but will always make sure I have someone else to enjoy with me!"
"A rich, dark colour. not quite opaque, with a typical Belgian style head and plenty of lace. The aroma is sweet and malty; there's a hint of the cherries within. It almost reminds me of my favourite cough syrup from when I was a kid, but nowhere near as medicinal. Taste is a little on the sweet side for my palate, but I'm sure that if I was pairing this with a dessert or some fine cheese I'd enjoy it a whole lot more. This is a very well made beer to be sure."
"Would definitely get this one again."
"Appearance-2 finger head, didn't linger. Not much lacing either. I'm torn on this beer, overall. I had very high expectations based on what I've read a/b this brewery but I'm a little disappointed. The taste is good (cherries, raisins, warmth) but the booziness in the taste is just too prominent for me to really enjoy it. As others have mentioned, this one is definitely a sipper and best with food."
"Feel is very unlively. Not much carbonation to be had, and agitation of the brew does not seem to help much. Feels a bit flat on the palate, though it may just be my bottle. Still, this is smooth, not sticky or oily in the least, and a very easy drinker, if you can get past the up front cherry characteristics of the ale. Drinkability is slightly above the average for me, though I'll keep the rest of my bottles for evaluation further down the road. My opinion, if you see this one, give it a shot."
"I think I know why I have not had this in awhile, it's just underwhelming in many area's andI remember those same thoughts from years ago. It's pretty drinkable but after 6oz's or so I was pretty much done with it. The bottle says this is ageable for up to five years, but I don't see this getting any better, it's just not that complex enough as it is."
"Overall I was quite disappointed in this beer. it seemed to be yet another example of a non Belgian brewer trying to make a Belgian style beer and coming up well short. I might try this again at some point, but won't be in any hurry."
"Not a bad beer at all, but far from my favorite Belgian quad style ale. Seems to be lacking a little malt balance in there."
"Yeah, I like this one."
"Drinkability: A sipper. The tart cherry taste provides an interesting foil to the style. Aftertaste limits viability of having more than one or two. Probably better to have paired, than alone, as I did."
"drinkability - at nearly 10%, one bottle should suffice"
"Drinkability - too sweet and fruity to be a session beer for me, and WAY too much alcohol. My whiskey days are over and this beer is a testament to why!"
"Drinkability: This got better and better as time went on. I like fuller, more chocolaty quads better, but this was nice."
"Drinkability wise, the alcohol was hitting me a little too hard for me to want more than 1 additional serving."
"D: Exceptional. The complexity of the beer is engaging, keeping me smelling and sipping. The surprising lightness of taste allows many such sips to continue. I will definitely be picking up more Three Philosophers."
"Three Philosophers Belgian Style Blend is a fairly complex beer. It is like a fruity Belgian beer, maybe even similar to a lambic. There is definitely a fruity aroma with this beer. The taste isn't has sweet has I expected, can definitely tell there is 9.8% alcohol in this beer. A very decent beer, probably not my favorite though."
"This has alwyas been one of my favorite belgium style quadrupel. Pours a dark reddish brown with a fine khaki head. Aromas of cherries, sweet malts and chocolate. The palate is sweet and malty with flavors of dark cherries, plums, and oatmel. I just have one more 2009 release that I hope to age for a few years, it will be itneresting how this develops in the bottle over time."
"This beer could be a dessert to me. You definitely taste the cherry notes but nothing overbearing of stand-offish at all. Creamy head that hangs around for a while. Sweet smell and heavy on flavor. I wish I could comment more but maybe I will edit this after my next experience with it."
"Drinkability - While an interesting beer, not quite my type of beer. - 3.0/5.0"
"D: The alcohol isn't very apparent in the taste but it definitely hits you later on."
"D: I like a lot about this beer, but that darned maraschino cherry flavor was just too heavy in the flavor mix for me. I shared the 1 pint, 9.4 oz. with my girlfriend and I'm not sure I would want much more than that."
"Overall, this isn't my favorite beer because I prefer stronger prominent flavors. However, I can appreciate its subtly and use of lambic as a mix to create something unique, if not muddled. Something everyone should probably at least try."
"Finishing this bottle became a bit of a chore towards the end. I would recommend splitting it. Also, I paired it with a roasted duck dinner and it worked, but wasn't a home run."
"Flavorful, well crafted, and potent!"
"Pours a deep amber with a one finger, cream colored head. Don't get much of a smell right off the bat. What I am smelling...is pretty much just alcohol. The taste is quite pleasant...vague taste of cherries coming through maybe? Regardless, its quite refreshing. Not too heavy at all, either. You don't even taste the alcohol, and it sneaks up on you. I really like this brew, and will have to pick it up again."
"Very lush, creamy-smooth. Very good beer, gets a bit sweet toward the end, but excellent all around."
"D: Big beer. The 2% of the ale with cherries added is in good balance and enhance characteristics in its style."
"Edit: I bumped the appearance score from 4 - 4.5 to represent what I thought was a fair score for the beer."
"Bottle shared with me by my friend Chris- A rusty auburn pour created a frothy beige cap with pretty lace. Nose of over ripe dark fruits, lots of caramel and Belgian candy sugar, floral notes, some perfume, molasses, and a hint of red cherry. Tastes of sweet candy, dark pit fruits, molasses, with added cherries and a good dose of balancing bittering hops. Finishes sweet, fruity, quite creamy and no trace of the high ABV. Nice brew. Thanks Chris"
"I will buy more but being offered year-round i'll chill on the looking aspect."
"This was a nice thick bodied quad I'm glad to have tried. The high alcohol content was very much present, and rather than mask it as some styles do they seem to have embraced it."
"Good stuff though! Ommegang, you dont disappoint!"
"Velvety texture with nice, crisp carbonation. A deep, rich, and complex beer. A sipper, although any alcohol character is quite subdued."
"This is an odd one. I don't have much experience with quads or lambics. I dislike the banana flavor often found in quads but I'm not finding it here. I am, however, finding lots of dark malts that can be described as tasting like prunes, grapes, dark cherries, and caramel and even a bit of chocolate in the background. The lambic provides a tartness on the finish, and some cherry before. An odd beer, indeed, but a good one."
"Verdict: This is a beer I love to sit down with and enjoy over the course of an evening--it's also a versatile pairing for a meal, working well with a variety of entrees and desserts. Thoroughly interesting when fresh, I'm dying to find out how this will taste in a few years."
"This has made me curious to try again; one sample is not enough to truly measure."
"I liked it overall. It has a beautiful golden-brown wispy lacing and a rich flavor and hue that reminds me of late autumn for some reason."
"Drinkability: This isn't quite my thing. The cherry flavor and high alcohol content really knock this down a few notches for me. For people who like cherries and don't mind high ABV, you'll probably love it."
"D – I feel like one too many of these is both easy to do, and worse than the usual ‘too many’."
"D=4.0 Good beer. You can't really sense too much alcohol which is very surprising for the high abv. Good Belgian style quad."
"Highly drinkable for a Belgian, but of course, it is a blend. Highly recommended."
"D-Easily drinkable quad."
"I recommend this to someone who would like to introduce someone to fine beer. It is not overwhelming, but still rich in flavor and feel. Enjoy with friends to get the most out of it!"
"D-really serve this at 55 degrees or above. once it got closer to room temperature it really opened up and was quite tastsy. cooler temps made the alcohol quite present. any who, very tasty and extremely smooth. quite nice in taste with huge flavors of cherry."
"Those with the no-fruit-in-the-beer ideology are missing out on this one; the cherries add a perfect tart backbone to a great abbey-style ale. Want to show a beer newb how complex, delicate, and vast the flavors can be in beer? Add this one to the list."
"J"
"I'm not the biggest quadrupel fan, preferring the paler belgian ales like strong pale, blonde, tripel, etc. But this is one of my favorite dark belgians. Very good malty aroma without too much dark fruit, extremely drinkable for 10%. This is the ultimate winter beer for me."
"D - sipping but its a nice sipping."
"One is enough - for one day. Still, worth revisiting as often as one would like."
"I had thought that this one would mature with a lot more grace than it actually did: Low sweetness, low body and a bit unbalanced."
"This is the reason for drinking beer! Exceptional brew. From the time you here the cork ""Pop"" till you see it pour... You start to feel giddy like Christmas. I recieved this and two others in a gift box set with nice glass. When poured its like a deep cherry waterfall into your glass. The smell that comes from the glass is like Heaven on Earth. When the taste first hit the tongue you get that bubbly belgian classic tast and then cherry flavors wash the palate.Mouth feels like its full of micro bubbles washing around. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"This is currently my favorite beer. I wish I had this on tap at home.Kind of pricey. I love this beer. Cherry beginning with an abbey ale finish. Complex.Color,smell,taste,overall a wonderful beer made in the U.S. This is better than the Chimays,sorry guys."
"Drinkability: A very tasty sipping beer and a beer with much character. True to its Belgian inspiration."
"Beautiful deep-brown color with with an orange highlight. The head is thick and fluffy with a caramelized tint. The nose is pretty complex with a tart fruitiness taking the lead. Cherries and rum-soaked raisins are most noticeable. Also, an herbal spiciness that seems to underpin the fruit character is also present. These all carry through onto the palate with the addition of a pleasant malt preasant that peaks through. Flavors of sweet caramel and even a light chocolate note show through and interweave with the raisin/cherry fruitiness. I wouldn't mind a little more cherry presence but given the overall balance and complexity I'm not too upset about it. Very smooth with a lively carbonation. Nearly perfect mouthfeel with maybe a tad too much alcohol present. I'd have to say that of the American Belgian-style beers that I've tried this is easily a top three, maybe my favorite so far. Highly recommended."
"D: will never buy again belgian Quads are among my top styles and this one was off for me. I did not like it at all, had half the bottle and dumped it, it would have been good, but it could not get over that Cherry flavor that i hated as a kid."
"Three Philosophers adds a nice cherry finish to the sweet malty feel of a Belgian Quadrupel. It's delicious, aggressive, and a great warmer."
"For the strength and thickness of this beer it is very drinkable."
"Pours with a dark brownish color that fades to a red at the bottom. I was surprised that the body was so clear considering the color was so dark. I could definitely see my fingers clearly through the glass. It smelled exactly the way it should, a nice strong ale with hints of cherries. The taste was reciprocated but the cherries definitely added a nice flavor to the ale. My only problem is for me it tasted a little... well the only way I can describe it is watery. Other than that I thought this beer was great, it felt good in the mouth and even with a high ABV I felt it was more drinkable than other strong ales."
"D: Good, though I'm not surprised by the ABV, it could have been smoother."
"I would rate this beers drinkability as very high. Nice carbonation - just right - and that balance of sweet, sour. Excellent"
"D - Not sure I'd want to drink more than a serving of this, but I have a 750 mL bottle to get through. I'm no quad expert, but I think this should be aged for a couple years."
"The body gets more and more rich, full, and creamy as times goes on as this last glass I'm having now is the cream of the crop. The alcohol is hidden well vs. most other 10% beers, but it's impact is most certainly felt! Haven't met an Ommegang brew I didn't love."
"Drinkability is superb. Quads need to be sipped and appreciated, but this one could be taken to different heights because its so smooth medium bodied and just damn delicious."
"Impression: This is one of a stable of fine beers made here in NY by Ommegang, and it is one that should not be missed by lovers of Belgian ale styles. Marvelous, fairly complex, delicious, and satisfying."
"With its high ABV and depth of character, and 750-ml volume, there's certainly enough here for three philosophers to share and contemplate. The three of us decided this New Year's Eve not to contemplate so much as celebrate, and Three Philosophers fit the bill nicely."
"Drinkability: High drinkability, very high considering it's such a rich, complex brew. Especially high for having a ABV of 9.8%. Overall, very well done, a real king of beers."
"Flavor, at first was a little hidden by carbonation...but sweet none-the-less. As the beer warms, very complimenting sweet malts and dark dried fruits mixing with a slight warming booze. Somewhat complex and a very tasty quad."
"D: This one is somewhat complex, and also has a somewhat heavy feel to it. The malt and cherry aspects might wear a bit after two. I think I could drink a maximum of two of these before I would want to move on to something else. Nonetheless, a good and interesting brew."
"I happened to have both a 12oz bottle from 2008, which came in a mixed 12 pack and a 22oz bottle of 2009 from another gift pack that I received this Christmas (2009). I have to say the 2008 was much better. I'm thinking the extra year of aging much improved the flavor. My rating is based on the 2008 bottle, but both were great beers."
"Not as full bodied as expected. Some decent carbonation lightens this one and makes it quite drinkable. Not as heavy, complex, or dense as other quads, but worth the try."
"Overall, a very good interpretation of a quadrupel. Also very reasonably priced for the style as well."
"I really enjoy this! I will buy it many times again."
"For what it is, this is a great beer. Incredibly filling an highly alcohlic, this beer is best when savored."
"D: This is a strong beer, so it's not going to rate highly on the drinkability scale. However, for this style, you're not supposed to throw back a bunch of them, right?"
"D: A strong ale but isn't that what we are made for... drink away boys"
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew and would pair very well with pork loin!"
"Average drinkability for a 9.8%'er. The heat really makes this beer limited. A nice, interesting beer, capable of being outstanding in the right circumstances."
"very drinkable beer. it was almost 10% so one was pretty good. My first ommegang, and very impressive."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy dark chestnut brown with a tan head with no real lacing. Great Belgian fruity spicy aroma. Tasted even better than the scent. This is full of flavor, cherries of course but chocolate, rasins, maybe coffee and other sour type fruits are rolling around in your mouth. You also do detect the alcohol in this. Was not sure what to expect but it was a truely excellent experiance."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, with a big tan head. Smells of ripe cherries. Taste is woody and earthy up front, with a dextriny, chocolatey middle, and a slightly tart finish. A hint of earthy hops in the aftertaste. You can also barely taste a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is super lush, carbonation slightly high. Drinkability is good, though not as good as some Quad's. Overall I would get this again, but only on sale."
"Beautiful dark red color with a long lasting head. Aroma fills the immediate area with sweet scents. Smells like a red wine, slight alcoholic aroma with light cherry notes, a yeasty character and a little bit of banana. Tastes of roasted malts, with fruit at the tip of the tongue. Very dry, heavy mouthfeel. I enjoyed it."
"Another fine offering from Brewery Ommegang. Have yet to find one of these that I don't love. Highly recommend everything that they brew."
"Heard great things about this beer, so I was SO disappointed. I was expecting a fruity holiday beer and was confronted by an antagonistic, obnoxiously alcoholic (read: yank-loving) stinkbomb. Smelled like rotten, fermented cherries and a musty basement in Jersey. Just awful. Tasted like pancake syrup that had been sitting at the bottom of my trashcan for a week. Thank Nature I did NOT save this for X-Mas Eve as I would have been even more disappointed."
"D: Excellent beer. That's all I can say...."
"In the end, this is a great Quad and I can't wait to revisit this vintage in a couple more years."
"This is great stuff. Poured from a 750ml corked bottle: dark clear amber with a light tightly lace head. Did not stir up the sediment from the bottom. Aroma is light with caramel, banana and hops. Taste is complex with malt, hops, toast and some citrus and yeast. An expensive beer but well worth it."
"D - This beer is flavorful, smooth and easy to drink. It's a nice American brewed Belgian."
"D-while at 9.8% the alcohol isn't too overbearing. one bottle of 750ml is enough for an evening. i wish it had a tiny bit more sweetness."
"Drinkability is great! It goes down pretty easy and smooth. I wouldn't mind having a couple at a time but don't think I'd session it. It may not be the truest form of the style, but it is quite a tasty and well blended brew!"
"D- The ABV seems bigger than it is, making this a really nice, sweet, warming sipper. Its quite a nice beer, pretty creative."
"I was very excited to have the opportunity to sample this on tap, as I currently reside half way across the country from Brewery Ommegang. I was not disappointed. I am a believer in Belgian style brews, and while Ommegang is not in Belgium, I believe they have represented the style well."
"Considering the alcohol content and strength of the style, this is very drinkable. I could easily down more than one of these at a sitting, such a nice mix of flavors, makes me wish I had a lot more of this."
"D: This beer is very drinkable, and makes a good sipper on these cold december nights. This beer may evolve nicely with a year or two of age."
"Very complex. I usually love cherry flavors, but this one is kind of odd. If you like dark belgian styles, this one may be for you."
"A rich and malty brew with a distinctive Kriek presence. A stately appearance with a quality head, retention, covering and lacing. A garnet brown and light cloudiness. A deep carmel aroma with cherries and light alcohol. Taste is a bigger version of the nose. Big caramel malt backbone supports a unique take on a quad. Kriek lambic notes fuse with the hops and create a one of a kind finish and balance. Multifaceted layers of flavor including some belgian spice notes. Some alcohol in the finish gives a wine like quality that is gently pushed away by the cherries and lambic tartness. An earthy, clean dryness in the finish as well. Malt lingers with light Begian spiciness. Fell is full and velvety a creamy carbonation is the ""Cherry on Top"". Easy drinking but you don't want to go to fast as the complexity calls for a long savoring with each swallow."
"Overall this is a solid beer. Interesting flavor combination mixes well together, very balanced and solid beer."
"Drinkability: High abv, and a bit too sweet to make this a more than 1 bottle session in this size format. Great tasting and a super great winter beer for me."
"D= solid. well balanced and smooth. A good sipper with some nice strong cheese or a solid meal. This one is really a great quad but not a beginners quad at all. This stretches what I would define as a quad but still has the same characteristics. Unique to say the least."
"D: Decent domestic quad imitation which lacks all the niceties of a Belgian quad. I remember liking this one better the first time I tried it, but my opinion of it seems to have lessened purely based on the fact that I've tried a lot of other Belgian quads since then. Still, a solid brew."
"D-I think the alcohol could get to me after a while so I think drinkability would be about average."
"Ultimately, I'm not sure that the aging helped this particular beer, but I quite clearly need to have it again fresh and compare. The not-quite real cherry seems much more prominent and the beer as a whole more dried out and a bit exhausted; that said, Three Philosophers is still on my short list of top American Quads."
"Poured out of the bottle into a Duvel type tulip. Foamy head gives way to thin slick of head. Smells like dark fruit and lots of alcohol. Slight fake cherry taste mixed other fruits. Maybe raisons. What stands out to me is the heat of the alcohol and the bitter finish. Taste smooths a bit as it rests/breathes. I didnt find this beer very enjoyable. I do not plan on purchasing it again."
"D: I kind of have mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand, it's a pretty solid mid-range quad. On the other hand, a few more bucks will get me a MUCH better beer. The heft of this body (and relatively affordable price) makes me want to use this for food pairing or cooking, but for plain ol' drinking, I think I'll stick with something else."
"I was lucky enough to find a bottle of the cave aged version of this beer from 2006 at a local store where nobody seems to buy craft beer. Color is a dark ruby, and comes with a quick to fade white head. Nose is wonderfully fruity, with the cherries really shining. At the same time the booze comes in with some chocolate, caramel, and brandy notes, and really makes for a great smelling brew. Taste is really full of fruit and dark malt goodness. You can tell that the age on this beer has mellowed some of the flavors in a good way. Body is full, and although you can taste the alcohol, it is really tame, and in the end adds depth to the whole experience. This beer reminds me a little bit of Brandy Angel's Share from Lost Abbey. I could sip this beer all day every day. I have to admit that I rarely go for this beer; instead usually opting for Hennepin or Ommegang. I really wish they would release the cave aged beers more, as I think I can tell a difference. All in all this is a sensational brew that has multiple layers of complexity. I have had a lot of the to[p rated Quads out there, and this one still sits close to the top. Cheers"
"Quite a nice brew, and my first from Ommegang. I can't say I've ever had a quad with so many lambic elements, but it's a good uniqueness, and the fruit is prominent in the brew, without being saccharine, or overtaking all the other elements. Alcohol is well hidden too; it doesn't taste like a 9.8 ABV brew."
"Would buy again and would like to add one to storage for sure."
"D: a quality after dinner beer. Right about now I'm wishing I'd sliced up some gouda and a few pieces of dark chocolate- good thing I have a couple more of these so I can try out that combination. I think I'll even cellar one of my remaining bottles and see how this tastes another year from now, though I should also probably grab a 2009 vintage to compare a fresh one to the 2008."
"OVerall, a very nice quad. Easy drinking. I loved the cherry flavors in this beer. I split this bottle, but I think I could drink this over the course of an hour or two."
"Another hit from Ommegang."
"D - this is a serious brew at 9.8 abv and is so easy to drink...I fell in love with this a long time ago and it's still great today. I could drink as many as it took for me to not be able to drink anymore...but I wouldn't ever do that because I respect beer....lol"
"Drinkability: My favorite from the brewery so far. It made me think I was drinking a cherry cordial with a bit of funk. I could have several if not for the high abv. Glad I bought the bomber."
"Ommefest on tap. I've ever only had this on tap but can't wait to open my 07 at home. Pours dark with a malty cheery chocolate nose and follows straight up on the pallet. Very complex and a great desert beer with dark chocolates. It's one of those beers I can't wait to see in 5 years. So damn great, my favorite ommegang."
"(D)- A great quad that is made even better by the addition of Kriek. Crisp & refreshing with that sour bite just at the end. Great stuff."
"This one is pretty damn drinkable. It was also my test bottle to see if I invest in the mini vertical I stumbled upon. Looks like that got a green light."
"D - Definitely not a session beer but great beer because of its taste and complexity."
"Drinkability: very high drinkability,"
"This pours a hazy orange and brown. Once out of the glass, the head is not billowy but sticks around till the end. It has a sour cherry smell from the lambic that is used with a little chocolate mixed in. I pick up a malt, bread, chocolate, cherry, and caramel. It has a nice long finish."
"Note: At 2 years, the 2% cherry ale really begins to stand out. I should buy this more often."
"Taste: Slick, fruity, minty, and malty. In my opinion it's kind of tastes like a Scotch ale that's been fruited."
"Poured a hazy deep brown color. It has a highly carbonated head that dissipates quickly. The aroma contains light hints of malt and fruit. On the front end of the first sip immediately noticed the higher carbonation of the beer. The flavor has a malty sweetness with a slight cherry flavor. The alcohol is slightly noticeable. Overall a decent beer. I was hoping for a little more, but definitely something I will get again. Look forward to trying more quads as I have only had a few."
"Drinkability is very nice. Have no problem putting away a 750."
"Drinkability remains pleasant but clearly not as easy as others, even among strong beers of comparable ABV."
"D: very drinkable, the alcohol is well masked with a multitude of flavors."
"Overall: Never been disappointed from Ommegang and it makes me proud to be a new yorker and have them as a home state representation. Is a homerun hit in its belgian style representation and as a whole. Is quite delicious and really is an example of a perfected craft that makes craft beer what it's known for."
"Overall this beer could be one of my all-time favorites if it was able to finish. The first wave of taste combined with the mouth-feel are absolutely fantastic, it just lacking a smooth finish. The alcohol burn is a little much, but not enough to destroy this beer."
"Drinkability: this is a delicious beer, but definitely a sipper. Extremely tasty, but it suffers in this category from its strength."
"M & D - Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with a medium to full body. The ABV and cost preclude it from being highly drinkable, but overall this is a solid offering from Brewery Ommegang. One I will definitely recommend to all my friends."
"Notes: Hmmm, this is a good approach to a great quad but for me it falls a bit short of the extraordinary. A bit too fizzy, and unfortunately in my palate the range of notes that would make it really memorable do not show up. Better than most US attempts at the style I´ve tried but still not reaching the source of original inspiration. On the other hand the type of quality offered by Ommegang at the range of prices compared to the imports is tremendous so they have a totally deserved spot in cellars across the US, and in that context I am sure I´ll be revisiting sometimes in the future."
"First of the Ommegang beers that I have tried, the others are soon to follow. 3P definately lives up to the hype that surrounded it's arrival to Oklahoma. The cherries aren't exactly ""my thing"" but I can appreciate this beer for exactly what it is... A very well done Quad with a unique twist."
"On tap at the Sierra Grille, amazing beers and prices. Pours a dark blood red with a half finger head that leaves almost no lacing. A nice cloud coats the beer. Smells of dark fruits, malts, and an alcohol bite. Taste is dark fruits, malts, citrus, raisins, alcohol and cherries keep coming to mind. Mouth feel is moderate bodied, low carbonation, a good warming and a real nice oily coat of flavor on the tongue. Drinkability is good, good taste, decent price, alcohol may kill this one over time, a very nice twist on a quad."
"D: A great beer, to savour - can go on and on - nice and slow. This is a big favorite"
"would reccomend this. This was also my first craft beer i ever drank, I had it on tap on my birthday."
"ehhh this beer was extremely overpriced if its offered to you for free i wouldn't say no to it, however i won't be ordering this beer again"
"Rich deep mahogany color with reddish hues and lots of fat sticky lace. Lots of malt in the aroma..some raisin, lots of dark cherry malted, very rich. Flavor is much the same with the malted cherries taking the forefront and the raisin, fig notes sticking more in the back. Some Belgian yeastiness comes through but its faint. Theres just a lot of rich malt flavors going on here and its wonderful. Id only expect this one to get better after a few years as the cherry would probably round out and the raisin notes would come more firmly through. Alcohol is not detectable."
"Notes- Amazing creaminess with warming qualities, the lacing is consistent throughout. I want to wait a few months until it's cold and I have a fire going to retry this one."
"Color is dark brown with random hues of red. Poured slowly, as instructed on the bottle, and a two-finger dirty white head appeared quickly and skeddadled. A few fat fingers of lace jut upwards and a few dots speckle the perimeter of the glass. The complex aroma involves big dark fruits, sweet malts, grain, spice and bubblegum. Closer inspection reveals some diacetyls, faint hops and a note of distant caramel. Taste isn't quite as complex, but big and bold just the same with a graininess up front followed by ripened dark fruit (cherries and plums) some sour fruit, a welcomed hop hit, some sweet malts and spice. Goes slightly rough with a ubiquitous alcohol heat, which never bothers me. It's a bit airy with a good amount of carbonation, and the mouth-feel lies right between medium and heavy."
"M/D: Alcohol comes in strong, fitting to the style. Carbonation is spot on. Medium to medium-full body."
"It won't be among my personal favorites, but this is an excellent beer nonetheless."
"D- A 750 went down easy. At 9.8%, you know that's a good beer. I'd buy this again, and while this beer was not what I was expecting, it was very good and has me excited for future Ommegang purchases."
"Has a nice mouthfeel, lasts several seconds. Decent drinkabiliyt."
"I will admit, I am not the biggest Quad fan. But compared to others I have had, this one is pretty middle-of-the-road. Flavor needs more refinement and the alcohol presence needs to be more masked. Probably not one I would drink again. I recommend it if you are a big Belgian Quad fan. If not, then you might want to pass."
"Taste is very complex. Not very warming but a bit sharp from the alcohol. The taste is sour and a bit sweet from the cherries, but not too harsh, very good for someone trying to get into sours. There are also some oaky and woody notes to it, reminds me of Bourbon.Nice amount of carbonation. For a Quad, this is really drinkable and quite smooth for such a complex beer."
"Overall, a good beer. Perhaps a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but quite drinkable all the same."
"As you work through the bottle (Even a 12 oz.er), it gets wearisome."
"A truly great beer that represents a compromise between tradition and innovation and pulls it off with aplomb. I only got one to try but would buy it again in a heartbeat."
"This is easily one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability suffers because after a while the flavor begins to get boring and it becomes a task to finish the bottle. Not a bad quad by any stretch of the imagination, but not one that I will be seeking again."
"Cheers!"
"D - even with the higher ABV enjoyed this quite a bit and look forward to the next one."
"Poured deep, dark coppery brown with a slight red hint around the edges of the glass. The thick head was a bit fleeting, but laced my glass nicely. Spicy Belgian yeast smell with sour cherries in the background. Nice alcohol and cherry flavor at first, then you get the bready sweet malts. Damn, this stuff is good! Very drinkable despite the ABV. Luckily, I only had one 750, because if more was at my disposal it would have been downed as well."
"Definitely a sipper, but no problem finishing a bottle solo. Very tastey with a complex variety of dark fruits."
"D: A sipper but a lovely flavorful beer to experience. I would definitely have this one again."
"Drinkability is exceptional. I could easily stick with this the whole night."
"Pours a dark amber brownish color with a little one finger head that gave way to some lacing. The smell is of black cherries and sweet roasted malts. The taste is a strong malt backbone with black cherries overriding the malt at the tail end. There is also an alcohol taste from middle to end, there is a good deal of bitterness that starts at the beginning and is present throughout. The mouthfeel is a little slick and oily, with a low to moderate carbonation, not as high as i would have thought. This beer is below average on drinkablility, it is very strong and a little overpowering in the middle."
"This is my new favorite beer. It was $12.50 for a 4 pack in bellevue, ky @ the party source, aug 2009."
"Perhaps not the most traditional of the ""quads", this is still a nice offering on its own. The elements meld well together and this makes for an excellent after-dinner drink."
"Notes: I'm probably gonna revisit this yearly, and try to get an older bottle... just to see. I'm not the hugest fan, but it's still a nice beer all around."
"Prost!"
"D: In spite of a lot of nice elements, I was done & had lost some interest halfway through the bottle."
"Pours a dark ruby/maroon color. Very nice looking. Aroma is overall sweet.. sort of hard to pick many different things out but its sugary. Flavor is similar to aroma, quite sweet with a sugary, candy-ish presence. Some dark fruit and a hint of Belgian spice but mostly a malty, sweet affair. No hop bitterness at all (but why would you expect any?). Mouth is full-bodied and pleasant. Crisp carbonation. Not too heavy really.. If you're into sweetness its very good, I could see it being a bit much for some but even with the higher abv I could easily drink more than one in a sitting. Quite good."
"Notes: Made the mistake of drinking this beer by itself rather than pairing something along with it, should have taken the warning. Won't make the same mistake twice, wouldn't want to waste this one."
"Pours reddish brown with a respectable head that fades quickly. The aroma I get is malty sweetness and alcohol. The taste is sweet with an underlying sourness and yeh, I can taste dark cherries. Mouth feel is about medium bodied with a little carbonation at the tip of the tongue. I think this is a sipper because of the sweetness and ABV. Overall, though the flavor was not what I expected, I both liked and recommend it. The quads are a tough category of beers and there are other great ones out there."
"Overall a very solid beer. Good flavor and fairly drinkable despite the high alcohol content."
"Overall this is one great beer, very complex and a great deal for a Belgian style beer with an American price tag to boot."
"This is one of my favorite Belgian styles beers. Perhaps because it is an American beer it is priced below the import Belgians and over the past year I have enjoyed a number of bottles of this brew. At home I drink this beer in my favorite snifter since that glass opens the smell nicely bringing out the fruit tones and earthiness of the beer. The color is a dark caramel with a white head that pours nicely from the bottle. The head does tend to fade quickly with no lacing which leads the drinker to think there will be no body but the mouth feel is big and full while not being over powering. This is a drinkable beer great to enjoy with a number of foods. I have paired this with grilled chicken and fish and vegetables with great success."
"I typically like a more traditional Belgian dark or abbey, bit this was a pretty cool switch-up! Will get again."
"Perhaps I was a little disappointed in this beer because the waitress who served it to me talked it up a great deal. The thing that struck me as odd was the overwhelming scent of this beer. It reminded me very much of cheap cognac. Otherwise, not bad. It was reddish brown colour (maybe it was the dim lighting in the beerhall) with a thin head. The mouthfeel was pleasant. As for the taste, it also reminded me of a chocolatey, cognac-y concoction. It wasn't bad, but I had high hopes. Bit of a let down."
"First few sips of this brew were a bit intense. Pours out a very thick dark copper color. Huge foamy head as well but no lacing at all. Carbonation was right on. Very smokey tasting with some light hints of cherry. Just a little too sweet for my taste. I would however buy this again."
"I have no doubt this is a high quality beer, but for $10, this is a one-time buy."
"Dr. Very good. Easy sipping after a nice meal."
"Three WISE Philosophers, indeed."
"Sorry this stuff takes you to a higher level... EXCELLENT!"
"D: An impressive tasty and complex beer which I enjoyed quite a bit. But it's slightly edgy and I don't think it really manages to succeed in the ambitious task it sets up for itself."
"Had this yesterday after work. Poured a burgundy color with light beige head that faded quick and left light lacing. Smelled of fruity yeast, malt, slightly sour and toasty. Tasted almost exactly the same. Very smooth. Finished the bottle, but not sure about wanting to drink any more of this."
"Worthwhile, so long as it's only one or two. again, no let-down from ommegang."
"Overall impression: A definite candidate for extended aging, as it seems to just now be hitting it's stride. Good beer."
"I am just starting to find my way through the Belgian forest. I think I found a clearing to sit and enjoy the scenery. I will have to try Ommegangs other offerings."
"I enjoy this. And will look to age some more. Another nice beer from Ommegang."
"CHEERS"
"Well, this is definitely the best Ommegang I've tasted yet. The cherry character is just fantastic, though not really typical of a quad, but who's complaining? Then you've got some lovely spice notes and that hint of chocolate that is oh so appealing in dark belgians when done right (I have been personally searching for this in my homebrewed attempts). And then the mouthfeel really adds to the overall character of the beer, they just nailed it absolutely perfect. Wow."
"Mouthfeel - the medium body is quite smooth and creamy with the low, fine carbonation and is not too course in the finish for a high octane beer."
"This is the 2nd beer I have reviewed from Brewery Ommegang, and I have been impressed so far. I can't wait to review another offering from them."
"All in all it may be the best craft brew I have ever had. I love this beer."
"As previously mentioned, this is the drink that piqued my interest in the style in particular and the craft in general. This brew from Ommegand has my highest praise."
"D) A very delicious Quad. Not as alcoholic as anticipated."
"750ml brown bottle bottled in 2008. Obtained at McKinnon's Meat market Salem, NH. Murky dark copper in color with about 2 inches of off white head that sadly didn't last long however left a little bit of lacing. Cherry smell at first sniff, a plum like undertone. cherries were the first i was able to taste then plums (or prune) flavors came in and made their place on the pallat with a little a bit of brown sugar. strong taste but goes down nicely with a light body. pretty good for a quad, not much of a sipper."
"Drinkablility: I've put off trying this for a long time because I don't think I like lambics. I'm not sure why they blend this, because I think it would be great without the cherry notes. That being said, its delicious as is. Its not cheap though-- cost me $8.50, and I'd rather have a $6 11.2 oz Abt 12. Its a nice change of pace though, and I'll have it again I'm sure. Maybe a good one to share with a wine drinker."
"I really enjoy this beer. It is a nice change from the Russian Imperial Stouts that I normally drink."
"A soft brown body pours out into a Chimay goblet; off-white, gently settling head--strong head that holds sway...fragrant, ester-laden bouquet strikes immediately--the lambic quality plays nicely in the crisp Hallertauer hops--malts are balanced well enough to hint at something amber...light, soft flitter on the lips and teeth; smooth enough to sneak through to the throat without much fanfare...definite acidic grape presence...hops keep the taste tart...the 9.8 % alcohol is present, yet overall accomplishes a mellow, malty finish; almost no aftertaste--this beer excels in its self-control... a wonderful Easter ends with this Quadrupel, and a great end at that--with the bold passion of a merlot, Three Philosophers displays body and taste sophisticated enough... the Ommegang guys miss little, and this beer could keep me philosophical with a rather clear buzz as the bottle drains..."
"D: Better when you sip this one slowly."
"Light brown in color and cloudy with a thick foam head. Fruity and malty nose. Smooth attack with an extremely fruity and thick malt flavor. Very thick and heavy mouthfeel. The flavor of the fruit and the malt intensifies at the finish. The flavors weren't my favorite and the intensity is a downer on drinkability for me. Perhaps I just haven't had enough Quads to know what a truly good one is, but this just didn't do it for me."
"D: This is my first quadrupel and I must say that I am not dissappointed. This is definitely a beer to serve at dinner. It has a touch of class. I am glad I bought it and I will most likely come back for more."
"I would appreciate this beer in a 16.9oz bottle for around $3.50."
"This beer was delicious. I would without a doubt purchase this beer again"
"Too much raisin a la Lost Abbey and not enough yeast esters. Too sweet in the end."
"Also, this beer is the 2009 version. If aged for a year or so, I believe it would bring out a lot more of the chocolate, toasted, and dark fruit flavors. Less of a cherry bomb."
"D - decent, but at almost 10% abv, not something you want to tempt fate with."
"D - i found it quite easy(maybe too easy) to cap off my night w/ a 750, obviously this isn't really a session beer, but in all honestly, one bottle satisfied but i can't say i would turn down a second."
" I was reading a lot of good reviews on here and I just don't see it. I wasn't as impressed with this as I thought I'd be. Perhaps I'm not down with the style as this was my first quad. I must prefer the tripple la fin du monde. Although I wasn't blown away by my beer experience I gave it good review because this beer was well-crafted, I will prob review it again at some point to see if it goes better."
"D- A strong beer but could go down with somewhat of ease. I struggled at the beginning but it got easier and smoother."
"D - with the great finish, not overly sweet, and well hidden alcohol, its just about perfect on drinkability"
"This is a smooth, sweet beer that is surprisingly easy to drink. It is very complex as expected in a quadrupel. The hint of cherries is nice. This surprised me as I am not usually too fond of fruit in beers. The alcohol is well hidden in the other flavors. Overall - A great sipping beer to enjoy with friends."
"One of the best beers I've ever tried. I'm very satisfied and will return to this one very soon."
"Drinkability - High for a Quad. I usually feel full after one but I could enjoy a couple of these. The high carbonation helps this ale go down easier than expected with the 9.8% ABV."
"Taste is initially sweet, but backs off into a wonderful complex of mixed fruit, spice, sweet bread, a bit of bacon smokiness. So smooth. Really a top notch brew. Bottle purchased at 12 Pine in Peterborough"
"D- Really good for a high ABV brew. Delicious and light--a dangerous combo."
"12oz Bottle A muddy burnt amber color body with a lasting small to medium offwhite head, huge amounts of sheeting and nice lacing. Aroma of dark cherries,apple,rasins, earthy spices and tobacco. Flavor is fruity without being tart,malty,yeasty,cloves,peppercorns,tobacco,sometimes I wonder if im getting hops or alcohol they seemed to have mixed well because it seems more spicy than alcoholic in flavor and finish. Slightly dry/slightly sweet. This shit is the bomb."
"D - A single bottle of this by yourself is enough to make you feel good. It is by far a sipping beer and something fancy that should be pulled out to make a good impression to the ones wondering."
"An exquisite beer, complex and tasty"
"I'll conclude my thoughts on the Three Philosophers Quad with a rather philosophical question: Is brewing beer a craft or an art? That is to ask, does it involve skill or artistic impression? I think it is the latter that shows the most. That said, if this beer is any indication, the answer is that it inevitably involves a great deal of both."
" I am pleasantly surprised by how well this one ages. I would definitely let another one of these go 5 yrs or more. In fact I would highly recommend it."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Sticky almost. Incredibly smooth and creamy. Carbonation is barely noticeable in the mouth. Incredibly drinkable. I'm glad I had one of these fresh(er), but now I'm curious as to what a couple years will do to this. Only time will tell!"
" This ale doesn't strike as being as heavy as the others produced by Ommegang, but it does have a kick. Unfortunately, it's between $8-$9/bottle around here, so I reserve this one for occaisional purchases. Still, a fairly good ale."
"Deceptively high drinkability. The ABV is well hidden, and it's not overpowering. You could go through this quickly without even trying."
"Drinkability really goes two ways for me. This is a great brew to drink in moderation, a glass with a meal, possibly a dessert, or even a nice cut of prime rib. But I could also see, on one of those nights when drinking just for the sake of drinking, killing quite a few glasses of this beer in a sitting. Impressive."
"This is one of my favorite beers and I always thoroughly enjoy it whenever I pick it up. Highly recommended."
"D- This beer is highly complex and enjoyable to drink. For the high abv it is very smooth. There are so many nuances in the palate of this beer its like a little adventure for you mouth."
"D- Really an awesome quad. Good representation of the style. I'd drink this as I often as I can."
"D. A very drinkable beer. Interesting twist on the quad style. A Good Beer."
"I bought this bottle during the summer of 2005 and opened it Apr. 2009. I poured the beer into the tulip-ish glass that accompanied the beer when I bought it. The ale poured an apple cider color with a brief ecru head. The ciderlike aroma set the tone for the rich cherry cider like taste and feel of the ale. There is a red wine like after taste that doesn't linger. The flavors are clean and to the point with a bigh show of cherry. The 9.8 ABV is definately there but blends well. Though the lacing is faint it sticks with the brew down to the final sip. there is a good amount of carbonation in this beer, you tell at a glance but the bubbly look doesn't convey exactly in the mouthfeel. This isn't really a ""knock 'em back"" beer for me but went well with dessert and cheese. THe coolest thing about the beer was the relatively substanital sediment hanging out in the bottom of the glass left behind just to reinforce the Belgian in this ale."
"D: Good"
"D - it definitely doesn't compare to any of the trappist quads or to St. Bernardus. it isn't bad, but its price is not that much less than a bottle of St. Bernardus 12, which I would definitely prefer"
"its not that its a bad beer, just not my style."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall, this is a great, cheap example of the style."
"D- I gotta say, I didn't think I'd be able to taste the ""2% ale brewed with cherries""(LAMBIC), but it was really brought out by the simplistic yet complex, ""dark quad"" base. The 10% alcohol makes me happy. Worth it at 9.29$ for a 750ml."
"D: Easy to drink, but needs to be taken slow due to the high ABV."
"All and all a great beer !!!!"
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a good high-powered Belgian that adds the tartness of a lambic. Five years might have been a little too long for this one, but it's still worth drinking for a long time."
"The alcohol flavors are a little harsh and biting with the sugary fruits if you have it straight away. Let it sit for a minuet or two and watch the lace swirl while studying the mysterious murk of the body. Then, sit back, sip and enjoy this taste of Belgium right from the states."
"Overall an excellent Quad - I've stayed away from this one due to the Lambic but I have to say I'm pleasantly suprised. I'll definitely get this one again! Many thanks to Phil at Ommegang's tasting bar...."
"I like this, and will definately pick up another bottle, but I can't help wondering what this would taste like with a bit more moxie...ie a real quad taste with a real cherry kicker. I was expecting a dark ABT 12-like brew with marachino cherrys thrown in. This reminds me more of a triple with a bit of cherry lambic flavoring but there is something rather pleasing about its lighter taste."
"Low carbonation and oily feel complements the alcohol dryness well. This brew could be sipped for quite a long time. I let mine warm up for a good while from the fridge, since the label says to enjoy at 50 degrees. I think they were right, and enjoy I did! Highly recommended."
"As I continue to drink, it mellows a bit.."
"The alcohol in this heavy hitter is barely there with how drinkable this is."
"Not one of my favorites"
"Slainte va!"
"d- I did a complete 360 on this beer. I absolutely love 3 Philosophers and is now my favorite beer by Ommegang"
"Poured a deep red with a tight foamy head that laced the glass. Smelled sweet, sour, spicy, and a hint of cherries--but maybe that was just because the bottle mentions that it is brewed with cherries. Taste is very sweet with a pretty strong alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is well balanced."
"Opaque brown with a large head that has good retention. Wild, fruity, and yeast aromas. The taste is very sweet and fruity malts. It also has a nice cherry flavor to it. It's really good. It gives a slight creamy texture in its medium body. It is very drinkable for such a big quad."
"I had no problem drinking it! The alcohol level gave me no problem at 9.8%. This is a delightful brew, and would definitely drink it again."
"All around a solid offering. Not my favorite quad, but it didn't let me down at all. Definitely something I would drink again at another time."
"overall very tasty but probably not something I would have all of the time."
"4.0 D: This isn't boring at all, but it isn't the greatest tasting, which works out to pretty good drinkability but not great."
"Very drinkable, as long as you aren't expecting a huge, full-bodied, Quad. Very tasty and well-hidden alcohol."
"I couldnt handle more than one of these mostly because i am not a big fan of the style but for the type it is i think it is one of the best by far. Thought i would try something new and while still not my style it is a great beer."
"Final Thought: Best Quad to date, it contains no faults except a little less flavor that one would expect. Classic!"
"All in all, this was a delicious beer and something quite different from the Quadrupels I've had in the past. That said, if I decide to pick up a few more bottles, they will definitely be for aging and special gatherings, rather than regular consumption."
"Drinkable, however when you get this in a 750 ml bottle , you need to be dedicated to it. Takes some getting used to , I have not had a beer like this one before."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable draught. Nicely crafted and pretty unique in flavor. Would pick this up again."
"Overall not crazy about this beer."
"A very good beer for quad lovers. Would make an excellent pairing with mussels, especially if cooked with them as well. Cheers!"
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"Beer poured into a Rochefort chalice. Beer is a beautiful dark brown color with a purple hue. Beer has a pleasing cherry molasses boquet. Taste is pretty good but a bit of let down after the look and smell. Beer springs onto your palate nicely with good carbonation. However, the finish loses some points with me as the cherries just aren't balanced out well with the alchohol and other flavors. Overall, a pretty good beer but I was hoping for a bit more out of an Ommegang quad."
"A nice example of a strong fruit beer, the cherries blend quite well with the overall flavor of the beer."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful beer for sipping on a cold winter night but I'll not want more than one. Much too rich to drink more than one. While different from it this beer seems the equal of the Rochefort 10 I had last night."
"Had this on tap at Andy's Corner Tavern in Northern Jersey, one of my favorite places to go for great beer. While I'm not usually a fan of this type of beer, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this one. For the amount of alcohol in this beer, it was very drinkable. There was a strong aroma of cherry on every sip, which I really wasn't crazy about, but I could have definitely knocked back a couple more easily. Would love to have this one again, but wouldn't rush back for it."
"Quite a wonderful beer!"
"D - great. I agree it would be good for pairing with cheeses or a meal instead of drinking alone. But, if there wasn't cheese in the fridge, I would exactly refrain from drinking it."
"D-Not something I would have alot but I will for sure have this again. High alchol makes it a little harder to drink on a regular basis"
"mouth is crisp but oddly viscous. medium carbonation and a great finish. This beer drinks easy, too easy for 9.8% Great, Great beer. definitely not the best Quad but it's a great creative representation."
"Notes: Definitely on the sweet side (like a Quad should be) but not at all overwhelming. What really makes this beer standout to me is the Cherry Lambic that was blended in. It gives it that sour tartness that really plays well off of the sweetness, while providing the palate with a dazzling display of cherry brilliance. This is very, very good beer!"
"Will buy again."
"D - The look and smell are there, but in the mouth it's a boozy mess of a beer. Not recommended."
"Very, very nice!"
"This is an original Three Philosophers 750ml (2002/maroon label)? The beer has aged surprisingly well. A nice pop of the cork, beautifully laced pours, and a delightful head retention immediately hint at a well-preserved ale. Oxidation has served it well. Old Ale qualities such as caramel, nuts (walnuts in this case) and, as one 2007 review of this 2002 vintage claimed, a beer that expresses an almost kriek-like lambic charcateristic. All in all, glad that I aged this one."
"Overall, very good American attempt at a Belgian quad."
"I found it hard at times to describe what I was sensing, because this is by far one of the most complex beers I've ever tasted. The combination of Quad and Kriek works very well for me, especially since I'm still developing my Lambic chops. If you've yet to try this, go and buy one now!"
"Tastes like a fruitier version of a belgian dark, really doesn't have the complexity or depth of malt as a quad. Nice in that while it has a strong malt presence, it isn't overbearingly sweet. Smooth if not overly deep, or creamy, or alluring. I just find the depth and flavor a little shallow. A rush of dark fruit at the end provides a slightly harsh (or a little bittersweet) ending. I much prefer this to other similar belgian cherry-inspired beers, like Mad Elf. This has a medicinal, cloying aspect to it as well, but the flavor works much better. Extremely drinkable, this seems as good a place as any as an introduction to the Belgian style."
"Just flows down so smooth across the palate. I really enjoy this beer. One of the few American brewers to nail this style. Not quite as great as its Belgian brother's, but I would never turn one down."
"My first Belgian quad and it was a great experience. The mouth feel to this beer was nice and light and was easy going down. Overall it was memorable beer experience."
"The complexities of the initial taste and then the aftertaste make this one worth buying again and again (at $7.99 a bomber, who wouldn't?)."
"D 4.0 - note a session beer, a sipper for sure. If I was in the mood for a fruity Quad, this would cure the itch."
"I'm not a huge Belgian/Belgian style fan but this was good. I'd like to get my hands on a true Belgian example in the near future."
"This beer is fairly drinkable, although I might have some problem finishing off the bottle immediately, I might have to give it a little while. Either way I would try this again and recommend it for its interesting character."
"I would reccommend this beer over and over again."
"D - Not my style - wife loved it. I would drink it again but it's nothing I gravitate to."
"D: A very good beer from a very good brewery."
"Sip or gulp as you please, Three Philosophers will reward any connoisseur. If you like the bottled version, seek out the draft as it is clearly superior."
"Nice one-inch white head atop a beautiful dark rouge body. Raisins, cherries, candi sugar in the aroma. Tastes like a Belgian quad with a sour twist, which of course is exactly what the beer is. Sweet, complex, creamy up front and finishing perfectly with the light-sour bite. Smooth in the mouth with tight, intense carbonation and chewy goodness. The drinkability is above average considering the big abv -- and is a testament to the sweet/dry balance provided by the touch of sour. Good shit."
"Drinkability- Not something that I would drink on a regular basis, or have more than one of in a sitting. A great treat."
"D - Better than I remember it but the sweetness would prevent me from having more than 1 12oz bottle. A 750 might be a bit much."
"Pours a dark red color ruby, light reddish head, diminishing. Some sour cherry aroma, but hard to distinguish in the bar. Sour, fizzy some cherry taste. Floral, dark fruit like plums, only some cherry, weakish. A dark heavy beer."
"Notes: paired amazingly well with 75% dark chocolate and it is probably the most successful beer and food pairing i have managed to pull off."
"D: Not bad at all, but not a ""wow"" either. Lacks a bit of expected complexity. A good beer, but there are more preferred examples out there."
"Pours a blackberry brandy color with a thin off-white head. Aromas noticed are mainly fruit, with cherries coming through the most. Main flavors noticed are cherry, plum, clove, and a little yeast....all with sweet and sugary malt backbone behind it, with a little alcohol in the finish. Good complexity here. Alcohol warmth becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. With the exception of the alcohol, this beer is not too heavy in the mouth, but I probably couldn't drink more then one in a sitting. Another good one by Ommegang."
"D - I could sip on this all night. A great brew and a definite sipper. I was a little wierded out when I read it was a kriek and quad blend, but it came out nice. They compliment each other well. Will definite cellar one next time."
"Nicely drinkable for such a huge beer, surprisingly so - a world class Quad."
"Despite it's heavy body and quite rich flavor, it's not grating or polarizing. It is very drinkable and is one of my favorites."
"This one is a bit over the top but I really like it. Very complex and not quite balanced but surprisingly drinkable. ABV and taste limits how much I pour."
"D - Though I feel like the alcohol is a bit out of balance with the rest of the beer it's still a good brew, and a pleasure to drink."
"Taste was of malty goodness again with a kick of cherries. I deffinatly felt the kick it packs but the abv is very well masked. Very yummy"
"d - Great Belgian ale for a cold winters day. Hearty with a warming sensation. The only downside is that it seems to be a little bit over carbonated but I'll try a pour a little rougher to see if I can take care of that. Probably not a session beer but a fine sipper for its style. Seems to deliver its ABV pretty quickly - maybe the high carbonation helped? Nice touch with the 2% cherry lambic without overdoing it."
"D - for a blend between a quad and a kriek it's quite good. I think this is the first time I've had this in like 4.5 years maybe, and it's still very enjoyable. Drinkable for what it is, but doing more than a couple of glasses would be intense"
"D - A filling beer combined with a high ABV in a 750 ml container - that speaks volumes for it being a single and special occasion beer. I believe that is the brewers intent anyway."
"decently drinkable for 'next-to-10%' ABV; love this Quad-Kriek combo--somewhat comparable to the more straightforward Cherry Quadzilla from Church Brew Works (Pittsburgh pride holding true!)"
"Notes - A good tasting Quad-blend and quite interesting with the addition of cherries, however I feel that this aspect would get too sweet too quick. Granted, I would really only have this as an aperitif or to compliment a cheese or chocolate. All in all though, a pretty tasty brew that shows the amount of craftsmanship of Ommegang and a definite recommendation to any fan of Belgian-styled beer."
"I think this is a highly drinkable beer. The ABV keeps it from being a 5."
"drinkability: quality but maybe 3 philosphers should be a tripel. J/k"
"Very nice, I was pleasantly surprised!"
"Definitely a sipping beer, but really great. I think the four packs are the way to go, as a 12oz bottle of this stuff is more than enough for one person, especially after having another beer to warm up on, which you should. This brew is incredibly complicated and is not to be trifled with. Considering that this is probably one of the most widely available quads out there, it's pretty incredible that Ommegang has been able to keep it of such high quality."
"d - this is hard to say, because last bottle was more drinkable than this bottle. i baught the glass because i liked it so much, and the price was good. but this batch was lacking the consistency of a quality drinkability."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown. 1/2 inch head with slight retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong malt, high alcohol content, and some pungent fruit (possibly cherry). Definitely fits the style. Crisp and slightly thick mouth feel. High carbonation levels and a tartness from the fruit. Tastes of an earthy malt mostly with some of the fruit flavors and a noticeable hop kick. Overall, really tasty and I'm glad I had the opportunity to enjoy this beer."
"This is a smooth, easy sipping beer. I absolutely loved it. On a freezing cold night, this was very warming. I'll be getting a bottle soon!"
"Decent mouthfeel considering the biting flavor. A bit of a bitter aftertaste."
"Pretty drinkable, really sweet though."
"With such a fantastic mouthfeel and perfectly bittersweet flavor profile, this is a breeze to put down. The abv is pretty high, and I enjoyed taking my time with this one."
"Cloudy with lots of yeast particles floating about, dark orange rust color, thin head of very fine foam, slow to dissolve, moderate lacing left behind. Sweet nose, the cherry fruit comes right through with honey, molasses, black licorice and candied orange peel accents, heavy on the malts, rum raisin cake, lingers for a long time. Full-bodied if not outright heavy, plops onto the tongue with all its weight. The sweetness of the cherry, raspberry, plum fruit not to be denied here either, even slightly cloaks the ginger, clove spice, licorice, brown sugar and honey. Syrupy texture has it clinging hard to the mouth pores, lack of lift makes it hard to get a clear impression of the malts, never mind the hops. Average carbonation. You damn well better have a sweet tooth to pop one open."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle in to a snifter, dark brown color with a creamy TF head that dissipated but left decent lacing. Smelled oaky to me at first, and fruity but complex. First few sips at cooler temp. also tasted oaky to me, but as the tmep. rose, cherries came through and smoothness increased, helping to mask the apparent high alcohol content. Definitely better as the glass warmed; going from ""this is fair"" to ""this is great"". Mouthfeel was typical for a Belgian, very active and smooth."
"Poured into sturdy chalice. Poured with a thick, light caramel colored head. After the head dissipated there was minimal, but pretty lacing. A medium-deep brown with a slight reddish tint. A welcoming aroma featuring fruit and spice notes. The flavor follows the lead of the aroma closely, but the fruit flavors have a stronger presence. Enjoyably so. A well balanced, continually interesting flavor that opens up more and more as time goes on. The body is pleasingly full, smooth and and well-rounded. Very drinkable, but because this beer hides its alcohol so well, be aware of what you're involved with. A long time favorite from a well respected brewery."
"Just the perfect balance and body in the mouth and goes down with a kind warmth. An absolute gem of a beer!"
"D- Overall this is a somewhat drinkable beer. 2 or so would be plenty. I was done after drinking a bomber."
"Very good holiday brew that is one of my top rated bottled beers for style."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, like bodily excretions. Overall a shit-hot beer, could drink a gallon of this without taking a breath and I'd be smiling all the way to the graveyard."
"Overall this is a great beer that gets better as it warms up.. maybe around 60 degrees? the flavor enhances as it gets warmer and the carbonation mellows out a bit."
"2006/750 ml bottle. Hazy crimson-brown color under a dense, creamy tan head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, fig, black cherry, sour dough and yeast. Mouthfeel exceptionally smooth and silky. Initial sweet flavors of dark fruits, caramel, plum and very restrained cherry. Could have used a bit more cherry influence.Finishes with a late hit of some mildly harsh bitterness. Maybe would benefit from some further ageing in this regard. Overall a well done, classy Quad."
"taste is complex, there is a lot there, its fruity (dark pitted fruit), tingles the tongue, some roasted nuts, a cherry or two, somewhat sour, caramel, and malts, leaves the mouth dry, slightly bitter in the end."
"in front of the the fireplace on a snowy afternoon."
"Could drink this any time, although it doesn't inspire the devotion I feel towards some of the most superior quads I've ever tried... it's accessibility, price, and availability make it a must try, a classic, and a worthy respect garnerer. Cheers"
"D- This beer is great! Its a unique blend that works really well for me. Its very drinkable despite the 9.8%. It did sneak up on me a little by the end of the bottle. I will definatly add this to my frequent rotation list! Cheers!"
"Drinkability: As with my earlier spill, of course I think the drinkability is high. It goes down so smooth and easy for the ABV. A little sweet, but that only detracts slightly from the drinkability of this brew."
"Opened a 2007 bottle this past New Year's Eve. Poured into a Three Philosophers glass that I purchased at the brewery a while back. Hazy red color. Large white head at first but that burned off quickly. Some bits of sediment noticed at the bottom of the glass. Smelled nice and spicy, with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg present. Tasted very smooth. Some aging did this bottle well. The alcohol was definitely more mellow, but also, the cherry flavor was less noticeable than fresher bottles I have had. The two glasses that I got out of this bottle went down very easily. While the taste made have been smoothed out a bit more than I would have expected, some aging definitely changed this beer in a good way."
"D: This one is sneaky. Lots of alcohol, but it drinks quite easily, goes down nicely and I could easily see popping open another 750 if I had one on hand. Great beer."
"For me, this beer is somewhere in between a session beer and a sipper. Three Philosophers is a great, different take on a quad."
"Once I have more quads and Belgians, I might modify this review I would probably buy this at some point, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Wow this beer is good! Had it in a 750mL corked bottle. The smell is nutty with a hint of fruit. The taste is very strong. You get notes of cherries and raspberries with a hint of nut brown ale. The finish is clean and refreshing but it could be the alcohol evaporating. This beer is one you need to savor the flavour with. The alcohol content will sneak up on you. Very well worth the money in either a bar or store."
"D: Fairly drinkable for the style but definitely a sipper as a quad should be."
"terribly drinkable on this nearly 10% ABV sipper."
"Drinkability: Very good brew despite the dominance of the alcohol. Would seek out again."
"D- This goes back smooth but is definitely a ""sipper""."
"will do a more sophisticated review at a later date in the comfort of my home, I was in a bar trying to be social with more than my glass"
"Pours a dark brown in color with no clarity. Develops a thick brownish head that does not dissipate, but slowly develops into a nice collar. Aroma is very sweet and fruity, slight hints of alcohol. Taste is good and complex. Very strong alcohol unlike other Belgain quads with a tart finish. Good texture and body. The taste was good and I would recommend this as a good session beer. If I had a choice I would take other quads over this one, but it was not bad at all."
"3P's Quad has a dark amber color similar to whiskey. It tastes just like it smells, sweet and malty, not as sweet as St. B's or Rochefort, which, to this reviewer, is a positive (StB and Roche are fine). Upon tasting, it starts off with a maltly flavor and full bodied mouthfeel, immediately becomes delicately sweet, very cider-like--fruity, apples come to mind, then finishes subtley with a twangy sweetness on the palate. The bottle does contain sediment, so the last pour is cloudy, but the flavor and body are not affected. I drank it out of a crystal goblet and, later, a pint glass, preferred drinking it from the pint. What I write next is probably a heresy, but I made a batch of beer using that ""cheesy"" beer making kit--""senor cerveza"" Recipe: 1 can r*d ale and m*llow a*ber, 1 pk of b**ster, 2 cups honey and 4 wks fermenting and 2 wks conditioning in bottles, 7.8 abv--and it had a similar smell, taste, appearance, and mouthfeel as 3P's Quad. Heresy? Probably, but both make me want to guzzle them down, not sip, and guzzle some more!"
"(rated Feb 5, 2007)"
"Great sipping brew, although would probably pair well with strong cheeses....have three or four of these, and you'll be spouting out some great philosophy!"
"Tart and sweet, slightly woody and even a bit smokey. Seems like the amalgamation of a Kriek and a Quad and it sort of seems like they don't belong together at first. Complexity gets a little higher, flavors become less muddled, when the beer gets a chance to warm up and breathe. Maltier, warm alcoholic heat keeps the back of the throat feeling like its wrapped in blankets. Tart cherry and sweet brown sugar and an earthy spiciness make this beer a definite sipper, this is where the beers tartness works in the beers favor and keeps an already sweet beer from becoming mind bendingly saccharin."
"Deep ruby red, with a solid head ring around the glass, mostly filled with a solid cap of head. Heavily malted from the beginning with a light a burn to the back of the throat, finishing exceptionally clean with a hint of dark cherries and brown sugar. The finish then echoes around the back of the mouth, bouncing from the roof of the tongue and back, with lingering and added nuttiness. Enjoyable, if only for the unique combination of flavors, but not wholly so, but I can't put my finger on why. As I near the end of the glass, it continually numbs the mouth like shots of completely wonderful liquid novacaine."
"Mouthfeel gets good marks because this beer has just the right amount of weight and cohesiveness in the mouth, which then leads to good drinkability. The beer just feels like it's not complete - it lacks balance and depth, but I'm hoping for good things from future batches, perhaps."
"I would love to age a bottle. I would enjoy a less carbonated feel and a more blended flavor. We'll see about hiding one from myself. Always a challenge. I paired this beer with some creamy cheddar, which was ok but I didn't really have much else around at the moment. (Time delay edit) I just remembered that I had a Specialty's Direct thick rich semi-sweet chocolate chip cookie. It pairs quite well with the chocolate. It brings out more of the fruitiness of the yeast rather than the cherry. I imagine the beer would go well with good rich food, maybe a braised pork tenderloin or something. The sour cherry could really cut a rich flavor well and the quad is a joy anytime."
"Nine months of cellaring later and it is definitely better, but now feels a bit thin and certainly doesn't eel any more complex. The booziness has DEFINITELY subsided though."
"Drinkability - this is, without a doubt, a well made beer. It may very well be a Great Beer. But it isn't a great beer for me. Even though I am enjoying this glass, I can't imagine having another without a nice bowl of really good vanilla ice cream on the side of it. As someone who doesn't love fruit-beer, this is not the beer for me. But I would recommend it to anyone who like a good fruity beer, because for what it is, it is very nice. In my opinion, this beer might be best enjoyed with a simple desert, following a rich meal (also like a port.)"
"Overall an outstanding beer that was much more tame then the regular version and just a thing of beauty. I was very glad to have tried this one, very glad indeed."
"D: I've had this fresh & thought it was a little boozie... but with 3 years in the cellar it's quite drinkable."
"Dark red pour with a big thick head. Aroma is nuts and black cherries. The blend of this beer is very thick but full of flavor. Bittersweet up front, then moves into the fruity sweetness of the lambic, and ends together in an sour malt. Everything seems to compliment each other in what is a very different and very good beer."
"D: Hides abv, but too much in flavor to make it great in the capacity of drinkability."
"D: Wow. Definitely a beer to drink in small doses with the company of friends and family. Sits well on its own, or as an accompaniment to chocolate and soft cheeses."
"Very tasty and glad I got to try this, especially on tap. Would love to try cellaring this. Reccommended."
"Bought as part of a Ommegang gift package and poured into the Ommegang glass. Deep red in color with quickly diminishing head. The cherry real comes out in the aroma, as does the distinctive Ommegang yeast strain. This was the first Belgian Quad that I've tried and could not really distinguish it from many of the Strong Belgian Dark Ales that I enjoy. Cherry is apparent in the taste, but not as strong as in the aroma, and this is a good thing. The beer is quite drinkable, with a pleasant slow warming sensation much like you would get from a bottle of red wine."
"The high ABV is clouded with tastes of cherry and birch, with a little sweetness and a little bitterness, but no dominant, overwhelming flavor component. This beer is extraordinarily well-balanced with a little bit of everything and perhaps even thought-provokingly so. The finish is light and welcoming, though not smooth or refreshing. The mouthfeel and drinkability derive from the beer's fruit component, though allows for a bitterness rarely matched with fruity beers. It, above all, tastes like an Ommegang brew, though it possesses a flavorful and balanced bouquet that far surpasses Ommegang's other brews."
"Pours a beautiful, dark ruby color with an off-white head that leaves a little bit of lace but keeps a centimeter layer of head above the beer. Knowing that a Kriek is blended in, the first thing that hits my nose is sour cherry. I acutally couldn't help but let out an audible ""fuck yeah!"" Other dark, sweet and sour fruits hit my nose as well, along with a definite funk and outdoors-like character. The taste is also remarkable, but I was expecting a little more sour kick. There is definite sour cherry upfront while the beer is in the mouth. Dark fruits come through midway and wood and earth-like flavors appear at the end. This beer is one of the more unique I have tasted. I am glad that I am able to get it within a couple of blocks of where ever I am!"
"M = Heavy body, decent mouthcoating, carbonation and alcohol sting just a bit too much."
"This beer pours a deep almost cloudy cider color with a head that quickly dissipates except for a ring around the chalice and some wisps in the interior surface. The aroma is dark ripe fruit, the cherries perhaps, and seductive alcohol over a malt background. Exceedingly smooth but not syrupy. The flavors are similar to the aroma with sweet malt, dark complex fruit, some sugary character as well. It finishes warm from the alcohol. This beer is warmly inviting, like the crackling of a fireplace on a cold winters eve. A sipper indeed, but do sip."
"4.0/5"
"Pours a wide, but light head on top that quickly dissolves into the deep, hazy, brown beer. Only faint light comes through the goblet. A nice looking beer, indeed. The smell is not very strong, but a nice fruity, sweetness, though. The taste is excellent, a sweet, but surprisingly light quad. All this adds to the smooth, and deceiving considering the alcohol, drinkability. I could very easily drink too many, its almost like a candy goodness with its sweetness"
"For 9.8%, I can't think of many beers as drinkable. It goes down far too easily. I'd buy this again in a second."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass because my wife had used my goblet. Three Philosophers pours a beautiful brown with a nice tan head that sticks around. Nice lacing remained after drinking the beer. The smell was a pleasant hoppy smell but the taste is what strikes you about this ale. It's plenty hoppy and there's the tartness associated with a Belgian style ale, but the taste is an ale version of a chocolate covered cherry. Very flavorful and very drinkable."
"A deep translucent woody maroon brown color with a thich tan creamy head. The aroma is a bit fruity (cherry aroma) The aroma is reminiscent of chocolate covered carries, like when you break open a chocolate covered cherry and the filling pours out. Just like that. The flavor is similar to other Belgian style strong ales but significantly darker with a distinct hint of cherries. Memories of pleasant Valentine's days past come to mind with the first taste. Definitely a beer to be savored."
"The drinkability of this beer is an awesome adventure. I could definitely only drink about one of these but I enjoyed every drop of it. I also enjoyed it more as it warmed up and released more of the cherry flavor."
"Drinkability - This won't be a staple as something doesn't quite sit right, but its definitely tasty. Bottle looks like a one and done though."
"D: This is one my favorite colder weather brews.. warm and inviting. However, at 9.8% ABV not sure I'd call this a session brew. A little patience helps with this one, but overall one of the better offerings from Ommegang."
"This is a decent example of a quad despite not being extremely complex. Very drinkable."
"It pours a dark copper color, much darker than I expected. A fully tan head that lasts for years. 2% Blended with a cherry lambic style, its great, you can really taste they tartness of the cherry. Its a very malty chewy beer, smooth and rich all the way down, this bottle would have been hard to finish without my drinking partner."
"All in all, I really can't recommend this beer. I didn't enjoy it very much from the get go do to its lack of smoothness and semi tart flavors. I really felt as though it was being forced down half way through."
"D. Not a session beer, but great as a brew to be enjoyed slowly and with contemplation."
"Another great beer from Ommegang. This is one hell of a quadrupel from an American brewery. It's big, warm and tasty. Perfect for this odd cold spell in Houston (42˚ today!)"
"Overall this is a good Belgian ale. There are better ones out there, but this is certainly worth a try."
"D: Another quality ale and blend from the fellows at Ommegang, I wish it wasn't so pricey, it's good stuff. One of the very first beers I ever had, back in '05 I had it without knowing what it was and it really opened my eyes up to Belgian styles along with Orval, so I'm very thankful."
"D- Heck yeah. Probably not sessionable, but I wouldn't mind trying. Huge flavours and well balanced. Very complex."
"D: Very nicely done bursting with dried fruit flavors and a easy drinking quad despite its abv and thick viscous nature."
"Drinkability is okay but not the best. High alcohol and unusual esters and funk make it a bit of a mystery. I want to like it but I'm a bit disappointed."
"super aromatic, very sweet and malty, a good bit of spice in the nose as well. great flavor. slight cherry, good caramel malt flavor all surrounded by a good alcohol taste. the caramel come out even more as the beer warms up."
"Drinkability: Ok, I really didn't like this one at first, but as it warmed (or as I got progressively more intoxicated?), it grew on me, though my score may not reflect that. This is one seriously strange brew - malty, fruity, light, dark, sweet, dry. It's definitely a study in contrasts, all with a hefty alcohol bill, though perhaps not for the style. I slowly but surely appreciated this one more as it warmed."
"2006 Cave aged. Pours a murky rusty brown in color with a massive cream head that very slowly recedes with a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a nice breadiness, spice, cinnamon, rich caramel, raisins, and belgian yeast. Taste follows the aroma with some good yeastiness and breadiness, some sweet fruit, good dose of cherry and vanilla, dry hoppiness towards the finish leads into a spicey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, carbonation is light and soft, good dryness and a little pepperiness towards the finish at the back of the throat. A great beer that could easily go another few years and see improvement from it. Many thanks to Todd for the opportunity."
"Poured a very dark purple/black, but translucent, unlike a stout. The color alone told me this would be different!! Very good taste, definite black cherry in there, reminded me slightly of Dr. Pepper. Minimal aftertase, and no lingereing alcohol burn. Very drinkable, can do more than one if you're careful!! Would recommend, and WILL buy again."
"One of the more interesting beers I have had. Great beer from ommegang."
"Really good beer. Glad they're making these in 12oz bottles."
"Definitely a sipper, but a very enjoyable sipper. Not the best quad I've ever had, but still a great show at a great value. This will definitely become a staple in my rotation."
"T&M: Full and intense. Strong toasted, yet intensely sweet malt flavors with a tartness from the added lambic that provides a welcome addition to the complexity. Rather intense fruit flavors--some fig, plum, raisin, apple, all blended with a kind of earthy, nutty undertone. I really enjoy the flavor of this beer. The body is fuller than average, but still adequate. Fine carbonation creates a tingling, lovely effect."
"Of course the batches will vary from year to year, but my opinions on the beer have changed somewhat.  I'm much more appreciative of the appearance and aroma on this one now, but I feel the body ought to be a bit fuller for this style.  Still an excellent beer and shouldn't be missed."
"Certainly worth trying, a good take on a classic style."
"This is a good drinkable beer."
"Despite the strength, the lightness of the body, and the lighter, fruitier characteristics of this beer make it supremely drinkable. This is a truly wonderful brew. Not just one of the best Belgium ales brewed outside Belgium, but one of the best Belgian ales period."
"On further review I prefer the large bottles to the small ones, more flavor."
"Drinkability: An interesting spin on the Belgian Classic. Cherry flavor manifests itself as an almost hidden aftertaste, hidden if not looking."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass."
"I like this beer very much. It's my first from Ommegang. Impressive smell, nice head and an appealing amber color. Delicious taste, really well done. The quadrupel isn't my favorite style, but I do enjoy it. Works well with a fine piece of stake, some football, and whatever else you might have handy. A bit pricey, which I'll factor into the drinkability to knock it down a tad."
"D: very enjoyable and drinkable; limits sobriety so must be enjoyed within its boundaries, but nonetheless worthwhile."
"It would be a good one to enjoy around Christmas as it has that sort of feeling."
"Two thumbs up."
"This beer poured a hazy dark cherry brown with quickly dissipating tan head. It smelled like sour cherries and light floral hops. It tasted like sour cherry and floral hops malt undertones. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a rather tart aftertaste. Overall this beer was very well balanced. The flavor hid the alcohol well, making this surprisingly easy to drink."
"Poured in a tulip glass for a dark brown body that included a constant one-finger tan head that left laces as it dropped. A mix of malts in the smell, caramel, maybe something like honey (think sweet), a touch or roasted malt and possibly some figs. They say cherries on the label, and you can pick up a hint of them. A heavy malt taste, kind of sweet, has a dry finish but there's only a hint of roasted malts. ABV hidden well in this medium-bodied beer as there is no alcohol burn or warming sensation, just a smooth passing that contains said sweetness along with dark fruit taste. I couldn't session this because it's a sipper, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great Quad that everyone should try once."
"Overall, a good beer. Maybe my taste buds are not avanced enough for this Belgian brew, I don't know but you should buy it and try."
"My favorite beer from Ommegang thus far and definitely a must try for those who are a fan of the style. Highly recommended."
"It's highly drinkable, but not something to over indulge in!"
"A very drinkable, flavorful beer, one of my instant favorites!"
"Revision - today, 11/1/2014, I am drinking a 2010. It seems a little less interesting - a little too mellow. I think this means one year is enough. They don't seem to be pre-aged any more either."
"Quite a tasty Quad here, this ain't no session beer though, a enough of these and they'll knock you off your bar stool."
"D - I liked it, but it was a little too strong for two."
"Pours a dark, ruby red. Smell is of dark fruits and alcohol. Somewhat medicinal. Tastse: there is quite a bit going on here! The alcohol is quite present, especially for on a 9% abv. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment though. Dark fruit sweetness, cherry and raisin, come through as well as some caramelish candy sweetness. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good. This is a sipping beer among sipping beers. Not my favorite quad, but a good one. I may buy again just for variety, but it won't be a regular purchase for me. Don't get me wrong, it's really good, I just think there are more enjoyable quads."
"Although it takes a while to oxidize, the balance of its parts levels after about 15 anxious minutes. A bomber is the right size, much more would be forced consumption. That being said, I would prefer a generous glass-full with cherry/blueberry/strawberry pie during holiday dessert."
"One of the Best beers I have had."
"Poured into my Chimay goblet this beautiful red,amber liquid produced a one finger head. The smell was of the promise of just what this beer is, a rich Belgian ale mixed with a cherry Lambic. The mouth feel is creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation to keep it interesting. The taste is heavenly. I love the sweet malts,caramel, and the cherry-vanilla finish. Just enough of the Lambic coming through to end on a sweet note. Where the 9.8% abv is hiding, I can't tell. This is by far one of the best drinking experiences I have encountered. The ""breast milk"" of beer!"
"Dark amber nights with a cloud of off white head, a delicious looking beer. Smells of black licorice mixed with some chocolate kisses. Exquisite tastes of slight malt and dark chocolate with medium body. Midway through the experience comes a landslide of cherries that has an alcoholic punch at the back. Finishes much like a liquor with a touch of dryness and alcohol coating. A blend of great taste makes for an original personality in a beer, a fine specialty of brewing."
"I poured a 750 ml bottle into 2 large chalices to split with a friend. It poured a cherry/caramel color with a very thick white head. The head retention was decent with moderate lacing. My first impression of the aroma was of cherry soda, but later smells detected medicinal and alcohol notes. The first taste is a mix of alchohol and cherries, followed by a mixed bag of fruit. This is a full bodied beer that needs to be sipped, not quaffed. This brew is good, but definitely not something I would want every day."
"D: Not an everyday beer, but a treat."
"Pours a syrupy mahogany color topped with a nice creamy tan head. Subtle hints of cherry in a malty tangy aroma. A tangy, winey mouthfeel. A nice rich complex flavor consisting of malts, brown sugar with a sweet and sour alcoholic rush. Subtle hints of cherry. Bottle states that this is ""98% Ale with 2% Ale with cherries added"" so I was concerned about a dominant cherry flavor. That was not the case as it blended in quite well. The beer is more enjoyable the more you get through the bottle. A sour presence constantly lingers. Even at 3/4 through the beer there is still a thin frothy lacing present on top. This is a top notch beer."
"Cloudy dark ambered colored ale with a rapidly fading head.Smell is sour cherries.Taste is malt,cherries and alcohol.Alcohol is definitely noticed in the aftertaste.This is not your bbq or football watching beer!It is good however for someone like me who was curious to try.I would recommend and buy this ale again."
"I enjoyed with a nice steak and it paired excellent."
"D: Great for sitting around and sipping and catching up with a friend. Looking forward to more."
"Drinkability: I absolutely love this beer and usually have a bottle on hand for when I get a craving. I've had this both fresh and then lightly aged. After 2 years the alcohol flavors and aromas tend to subside and not be as strong but still noticeable. I love how the cherries are not overpowering adding to the rich complexity of the beer. Another great beer from Brewery Ommegang."
"Incredible three finger tan head. Great retention of tiny bubbled cap, very stubborn. Aroma of carmel malts and raisins. Appearance is a little hazy with ruby hues in an otherwise Grade A Maple brown. Incredibly rich and deep with multiple layers. Some broken lacing. Figs, brown sugar, oak, currants, black cherries (clearly from the 2 % lambic they added). Tart but not puckering. Very drinkable for a quadruple but still not for the faint of heart. Long sweet finish with a touch of alcohol nip (heat) at the very end."
"D - Complex and enjoyable... Big beer, bit still very drinkable... I'm typicallyn not a big Quad person, but this was very enjoyable..."
"Highly recommended..."
"D- I enjoy drinking this. I started off sipping and toward the end I find that I'm just taking full on gulps."
"Drinkablity: 7.99 at a local liqour store which is cheaper than I normally see it at 9.99 very tasty, but at practically 10% alcohol it's a sipping brew. However I'm going to enjoy the rest of this 750 in the bath and probably after. Prost!"
"Philosophy begins in wonder...indeed."
"Pours into my Pabst goblet (yup) a hazy dark caramel topped by a fluffy cream head. Smells malt heavy with some fig and cherries, a faint touch of licorice and pumpkin spice. Tastes heavily of bing cherry with a bit of cocoa and fig behind. Fairly vinous with a very faint oaky bitterness in the finish. In the end, I find the mouthfeel a bit too thick, lacking the effervescent lift I like in most Belgian versions of the style. It has some prickle but feels too syrupy. Quite good quad, but not exceptional and not so much cheaper than some offerings from abroad."
"D- An interesting twist on a classic style. Not sure id buy it again, as there are several i have liked more. i did enjoy it however."
"mmm, good beer think I need another, had some sharp cheddar that complemented it very well"
"Drinkability - One my favorite beers, surprised I never reviewed it. I have cave aged one, and all the bottles gong back the past 4 years. I have done a flight of these through the years last summer. The older they get, the more complex the taste. Go put these away man."
"mmmm, mmmm, good! This is one of the best all around beers I have ever had the honor of drinking. A complex blend of flavors creates a wonderful taste that can't be completely described. Bought a 750ml bottle and poured into a merlot glass. This beer pours a nice color that resembles a fine mahogany. The head is like a fluffy cloud that sits atop a cherry sky. The aromas are chock full of malty sweetness, cherries and raisins can be detected along with caramel and other sweet malts. The aroma alone is enough to satisfy. The intense flavor is bursting with sweet malts complimented by cherries. Overall this beer is very smooth and drinks easily with much satisfaction. I can't wait to get another bottle, this is a must have."
"Its a light burgandy in color with a nice foamy kacky colored head that leaves a little lace but does manage to stick around for quite some time. Smell is malty with dark spice and candied fruits. Some alcohol in the nose as well, but I was unable to pick out the cherries. Taste is very nice, Raisins, plumbs and pears make an appearance with the roasted malt flavor and some back end spice. The cherry flavor is there as well. Mouth feel is thick but well carbinated. It took a while to finish this bottle, not because it was hard to drink, but because I was savoring it."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Worth a try for all quad fans out there."
"Pours an amber/brown color with a one finger tan, creamy head with good retention and spotty lacing. Aromas of sour cherry, vanilla, malt, and chocolate. Sweet malt, chocolate and sour cherry up front leads to citrusy hops and alcohol with a dry bitter coffee finish with some lingering bitterness. Medium body and carbonation, there is a creamy mouthfeel. While the alcohol can be tasted, the drinkability is still very nice."
"Drinkability: Nice desert beer or night cap"
"This is simply a great beer. The addition of kriek really seems to lend this one an interesting touch. Highly recommended."
"Notes: An excellent beer, one of my favorite."
"This poured a hazy dark cherry brown with quickly dissipating tan head. It smelled like sour cherries and light floral hops, with Belgian lemon grass yeast. It tasted like sour cherry and floral hops with wild Belgian yeast and some molasses malt. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a tart aftertaste. Overall this had an interesting flavor, and was very delicate and well balanced. The flavor hid the alcohol well, making this surprisingly easy to drink. All in all, this was a very good Belgian."
"Tasted on 6/23/08."
"D- A good brew just don't think I could have a few of this in one night."
"I really enjoy this. I am not that familiar with Quadruple's, but it seems spot on from what I have tried. Something I would recommend."
"Smell is one of the most pleasing of any beer I have had. Chocolate, cherry, soy sauce, smoke, coffee, brown sugar, fruit esters, alchohol, and more. Taste had very similar aspects as the smell. It was sweeter than the smell hinted at but not too sweet. Nice bitterness. Very delicious. Finish is long lasting and bitter."
"Overall - Incredible beer. Not something I could drink on a regular basis and would love to taste this aged. I'm glad it came in a 12oz bottle also because the 750ml would have been a bit much."
"One of my favorite Belgians"
"I recently purchased this in a Magnum as part of an Ommegang 10 year anniversary pack (with commemorative glass), so this is at least one year old."
"750ml bottle into a snifter. Hazy dark brown in color with a beige colored 1 inch head that leaves no lacing. Aroma of dry yeast and funky tartness. very strong alcohol presence as it warms. Taste is much better than the smell. The hint of tart cherry lambic is the first thing to notice, but it's not overpowering. Followed up by some nice dark fruity malts, dry Belgian yeast character and a little bit of funkiness. Hop character is in the background with only a slight hint of bitterness in the finish. Apples, cherries, and a small amount of candy sugar and dry chocolate are present. Strong alcohol heat becomes present as it warms. Highly complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is slick and well-carbonated. Excellent brew, and fairly easy to drink despite the high ABV. Another winner from Ommegang."
"Dammit, I just love Ommegang. They make such fantastic beers (including the heavenly Hennepin). This is just another feather in their cap. Probably my favorite American brewery, and for good reason."
"A fruity, dark Belgian ale, different with each sip. Time spent interacting with this beer is phenomenally better than time spent just watching tv. The only conceivable downside is that with 1.5875 pints of anything 9.8% abv, one tends to have a hard time logging memories. I had a good time."
"D- Definitely need to split the bottle as it hides the 9.8% really well."
"This review is for an '04 bottle that had been cellared correctly. Nice creamy, light brown head. Light malt and bread, with flower, dough, grape, and big cherry. Big pop when it opned. Very sweet. This beer was OK. I expected more of a quad taste, but it seemed a bit thin. Mostly just cherry."
"Fin."
"D= I was pleasantly surprised by this ale. I was hoping it would not be cloyingly sweet or dominated by the cherries and I was not disappointed. A fantastic ale!"
"d- this is a very drinkable beer and I'm sure I'll buy another...."
"Drinkability: Perfectly drinkable, but a little one-note ish."
"OK. I really didn't want to rate a beer all ""5.0"" as I understand that this should be really rare. However, honestly, there is nothing wrong with this beer. It is an excellent brew and all people that like Belgian beer should give this beer brewed over 3000 miles form Belgian a try. It has a nice dark color, pours nicely, smells good, and has a taste to die for. Unlike other Belgians I have enjoyed, this also has a great drinkability (sometimes I enjoy my initial tastes of a Belgian and i grows old half way through - but not this one). I don't see how anyone who likes Belgian Ales wouldn't enjoy this brew. Maybe they won;t give it as high praise as I do, but I can't see them not enjoying it."
"D: very tasty beer, goes down easy. nice fruity flavor definitely keeps you coming back for more."
"A very nicely balanced quadrupel. I like that it's not as boozy as others in the style. It lacks a little complexity and has a little less of a flavor profile than others in the style, but is very drinkable and a nice ale that I could have a few of."
"M/D- pretty good here. Medium, has a bit of body on it but for a big beer it's still relatively light. Interesting beer but not something I would probably order again."
"Poured 355 ml. bottle into a fishbowl chalice. This Qaud presents itself w/ a deep ruby hue and off-white foamy head that settles quickly to a 1/8"" film. You get a waft of sweet fruit compote followed by a hint of the booze. first impression w/ taste was that of sugared caramel-like well-done toast with butter and sugar on it-less the cinnamon. Throughout the rest, you get fruit teasings (not necessarily the 2% added cherries though?) This finishes strong; and as usual, you get more alcohol towards the end. The best part about this brew is how well the mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. The aftertaste keeps you wanting more-even more than the taste itself! This can get syrupy after a few but doesn't sit heavy. The 9.8% ABV is a sneaker so watch out. I would have liked this to offer a little more on the front end but overall, I enjoyed just drinking this one!"
"Drinkability: One glass is a very rich drink, and I took it relatively slow with a paring of dark chocolate. Good experience, but not one to drink several of."
"This brew is very full-bodied and complex with a nice, velvety mouthfeel. There are many layers of flavors. Although the sweetness coats my mouth and becomes a bit much after the first glass, this is a wonderful quadruple to sip on."
"I have been reluctant to try ""Belgian Style"" brews, mostly sticking to the true Belgian Breweries. This one was very good, smooth. Do not taste the alcohol, the hint of cherries is very subtle. Appearance is wonderful clear, coppery. Will have again."
"I was quite impressed with this, my first from Ommegang, I'll have to try more."
"Drinkability: You'd think that a beer this sweet and this alcoholic would get cloying after awhile, but in general this is a very quaffable brew, finishing nicely and giving a nice warm feeling inside. Not the greatest quad ever, but then again it's a blend, so what can you do?"
"An excellent balance and flavor make this beer absolutely great. I would recommend this beer in an instant. I am not the biggest fan of the Belgian style, but I could drink this for a long time to come."
"Overall, an interesting brew. Rather complex. Definitely worth a try."
"After letting it warm up for a few minutes some of the alcohol taste becomes a bit more noticeable, its also more apparent in the aroma as well, but it is not offending in any way."
"Very drinkable, if you have patience. This is too good of a brew to rush through. This may limit the number you would drink in a sitting. Good for the cellar to pull and savor on ocassion."
"Served in a snifter. The beer pours a dark amber, forming a thick and creamy 1 inch tan head. Light spots of lace slowly slide down the glass. The aroma is rich and complex, consisting of a strong mix of candy sugar and dark fruit, along with a hint of alcohol. The taste begins with the Belgian candy sugar taste, along with the dark fruit flavors, followed by a slight taste of cherries, and ending with a light smooth malt finish. As described on the bottle, 2% is cherry lambic, but for only 2%, the cherry lambic is very present in the taste! Clean mouthfeel and finish. IMO, this is an exceptionally drinkable ale. Full complex flavors. Whats not to love about this? Overall, I was truly impressed by this ale. I think the addition of the cherry lambic enhances the flavor, giving it a very unique taste. Definitely my favorite offering from Ommegang!!!"
"Drinkability is about average. Although this is a fantastic beer it is by no means a session beer. Very rich in feel and flavor, and at 10$ a bottle..you get the point."
"very sipable. i don't think i could have more than a couple glasses, but one glass is enough and very enjoyable. A blend, but well blended. Nicely done."
"I loved this anonymous quote from Ommegang web site: ""I drank it once, very soon after I bought a case. I drank it again and now I will build a beer cellar. I don't know if I will share it with anyone. No I will not share it with anyone. I am sorry."""
"Nice thick chewy mouthfeel with a sweet sticky mouthcoat. A great complex beer that is unbelievably smooth for the 9.8 ABV. Without a doubt one of the best beers I have ever had. If you have the opportunity to score one of these cave aged beauties jump on it."
"MF&D - Creamy and full bodied. The high alcohol content makes this one a definite sipper. This is a special ale, I highly recommend this one , if you can find it."
" Alcohol smell and taste could be toned down."
"It' full bodied, yet the high carbonation makes it feel lighter. Very clean finish. Also very drinkable, though the alcohol sneaks up on me quickly."
"D- dessert in a bottle? definitely. not usually a fan of blends, aside from a certain froggy black-n-tan, next time seek out this decadent treat will be around the holidays, to share with people, as i'm sure this is a beer almost everyone can enjoy."
"Another great beer from Ommegang. This one's very complex: lots of fruit, lots of spice, including cloves and nutmeg. Extremely drinkable. A nice head that lasts a while and smells wonderful. Take plenty of time to enjoy the aroma. You cannot go wrong with this."
"An exquisitely complex flavor. Sweet and sour dark fruits blend with an Earthy nuttiness. Spice lingers on the tongue after swallowing. Richly bitter hints of black coffee in the finish. Flavors become darker and malt richens as it warms. This is apparently a blend of 98% Quad and 2% Cherry Lambic, which is interesting. The cherry flavor is perfectly subtle, adding another layer to the as previously stated vastly complex flavor."
"D- Delicious tasting and I would happily have another."
"Cheers"
"D-Good, but I don't feel the body was sufficient to carry through the strong malt character. Paired with Morbier, which carbonation and malt complemented well."
"Be careful with cooling this beer, it loses a lot if it is too cold. If you don't have a way to regulate temperature, I would cool in fridge and leave out until it is a bit above the 50 degree cellar temp. The flavors really pop when the beer is warm."
"An outstanding quadrupel that's on par with the best beers from Belgium. It pours a dark reddish brown with a dark and cloudy body. The head builds up to a thick pale tan head that bubbles down to a thinner layer that just covers the body. An inviting aroma of sweet dark cherries, caramel, malts and alcohol leads you to the first sip. Sweet dried cherries mixes with caramel and chocolaty malts, sour cherries, plum and raisins. All of these flavors are surrounded by a warming alcohol that fades off slowly with some bitter notes into the finish. The palate is full bodied, smooth and a little sticky. Overall an extraordinary beer that only gets better and more complex with age."
"Pours a deep ruby/brown color that is super clear. Modest head that is fed by some intense carbonation. Slight lacing as I work through the glass. Smells of sweet figs, yeast, bread, and a little alcohol. A sweet tartness noticable right away, not overpowering but its there. Good maltiness. Nice fruity esters upon swallowing. It may be the powers of suggestion but I can tell there is a slight cherry influence, really well balanced. Slight malty/grainy finish. Light mouthfeel. Alcohol warms rather quickly. A really nice Quad and worth seeking out."
"D: this is a good quadrupel, a little expensive for what it is, I would rather have a Ommegang Abbey. but still a nice beer."
"Final thoughts - Very tart. A little to much noticeable alcohol for me to enjoy."
"Drinkabilty - very enjoyable, I want more, stock up if you find it"
"So dang drinkable if you like the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Not too dry and pretty drinkable. This would be a good Belgian style beer to introduce people to the style."
"D: my first Belgain quad and still one of my favorites, the blend with the lambic is a nice touch"
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a dark tan single-finger head. The scent is mostly sweet malt with some caramel and fruity hints. The taste is sweet caramel malts that are cut fairly quickly by a some tart cherries that leads to some warming and a nice dry finish. The mouthfeel is nice and thick with a decent amount of carbonation and some pleasant alcohol warming. This is very tasty sipping beer, but it's not exactly something I would down a couple of bottles of back to back. This beer was even better than I expected, I'll definitely be picking up some more in the future."
"This is one of those beers that makes me smile when I see a bottle of it. It's one of the brews that ignited my passion for good beer. Anyways, what I enjoy about Three Philosophers it that it's a heavy complicated beer, but it's so balanced and drinkable. It pours a deep mahogany color, which most closely resembles a dark tea, with a foamy light tan head. It has a very subtle scent, with slight cherry notes and a maple sweetness to it. The flavor ranges from a caramel nuttiness to an oaky barrel character. The finish is crisp and brings home the cherry undertones. All around this is just a great beer and one of my favorite domestic selections."
"paired with a decent home-made attempt at carbonnade flammande with limited locally available ingredients. the belgian buddy i shared this with was impressed with both ;)"
"As with most Belgians, the drinkability is excellent. A great session beer for someone who can really hold their booze. I wouldn't recommend going and having a good piss up with beer of this quality, but it is easy going enough to where I could easily have 3 of them in an afternoon and enjoy them all."
"Drinkability: Would definitely drink again, and again, but that 9.8% abv might catch up to you very quickly."
"Drinkability- A most drinkable beer, reasonably priced and not overpoweringly complex but with interesting notes, buy again."
"M&D: Relatively heavy mouthfeel but less than most dark Belgian styles, especially of this ABV. Carbonation is relatively light, which lends well to the creamy texture. Goes down smooth. I enjoyed the brew but I don't know if I could drink more than one at a time. Good stuff overall."
"This was the 3rd brew from Ommegang that I've tried... so far so good... a very solid brewery. Big bottle, 2007 edition... wonderful bottle... corked. *3 finger frothy head pours and refuses to disappear... Dark burgondy, some visible sediment... perfect carbonation. Impressive looking. Yeasty nose... nice malt, dark fruits... sweet. Taste is quite complex... malty.. (Ommegang beers all share a similar malt backbone... kinda a brewery signature I suppose). Cherries stand out more and more the deeper you get into the glass. The alcohol warms you up, and the fruits really start to show their face. 9.8% abv is noticeable, but adds character. Medium body, with a creamy finish. Delicious brew... quite drinkable for such a strong beer."
"M/D: Overall very good Ale, I would definitely buy this again, enjoy."
"btw, I found this to go well at cellar temperature (or room temperature too!) with a light dinner (perhaps some Greek food or a chicken caesar salad) and mild cheddar cheese :)"
"I'm not the biggest Belgian fan so I can't say that this is one of my favorites but it is nice and I actually enjoyed this bottle."
"If you have the opportunity to enjoy this beer on tap, by all means take it. It's worth it."
"A well-made effort; definitely a sipper."
"d: This is by no means a bad beer, I'd just rather have a quad OR a lambic, not both. This combination diminishes both styles, I think."
"Poured a deep reddish brown with a fluffy off-white head. Smelled of sour tart cherries and some other fruit esters and a slight alcohol astringency. The taste is malty with a sour tart cherry flavor. This is the best year I have had of this but the first time I have reviewed. The cherries really come out in this. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with great carbonation that plays on the tartness very well. I have one other 2006 bottle and two 2007 to taste in the future. Hopefully the ""06 will keep the amazing complexity it has right now."
"The neck label indicated a 2007 bottling date, and the pouring instructions on the side of the label were helpful. It didn't take much vigor to create a luxurious head as suggested there. The body was deep red and brown, and the head was quite stable and frothy. Quite a bit of lace formed each time the glass was tilted. The smell was floral sweet with a ton of dark fruit character showing through as well. The taste wavered between sweet and dry and finished spicy. The blended nature of the beer was apparent in a mellow smoothness that muted some of the edgier and earthier tones found typically in Quadrupels. The alcohol was more of a factor in the taste than I initially expected it to be, and the warmth was quite noticeable after each sip. This was a well built Quadrupel with a lot of good facets. None of the qualities was really best in class, but the sum was greater than the parts, as it was a nice cohesive whole."
"2003/750ml. I've saved this for a while. I guess that late Winter is when I deliberate over my aged stock. It pours well. It has a decent head and looks like a good one. The smell is not that revealing to me. The taste is somewhat bitter. Bitter? I then get too sweet and bitter. The carbonation is right but the metallic bitterness is quite a distraction. I wouldn't buy this again."
"D: For a quad, this is good.. its no St. Bernardus 12... but its a good alternative"
"This is a great beer, and the first one that lived up (for me) from Brewery Ommegang, well done Quad, and I am a little more picky when it comes to big beers."
"Split a bottle of this with my brother and cousin at a christmas party. It had a purplish red appearance with a white head. The taste was complicated like a fruit cake having tastes of wheat, fruits and spices. It felt creamy to the toungue and was quite pleasent going down. I found it exceptionally drinkable, however I don't think I could drink an entire 750 of it on my own."
"Sorry."
"The beer was a nice cloudy brown in color with a strong earthy fruit smell. The taste of cherries is very subtle yet still notable. Mildly sweet with a slight bitterness, possibly from the almost herbal notes. You can definitely pick up on the alcohol but it is not out of place for this beer. It provides a nice warmth in the sip. This is a very enjoyable beer as I've come to expect from the Ommegang Brewery."
"Notes: Mix a Kriek and a Quard, great!"
"The pour brought forth a rich mahogany liquid with an off-white head that dropped fairly quickly. The aroma of cherries was at the forefront along with some other dark fruits and sweet malt. The dark cherry flavor comes out initially, followed by the rich, sweet malt backbone of a Belgian dark ale. It was slightly tart, and somewhat astringent. The 9.8% ABV can be faintly detected in both the aroma and taste."
"Drinkability: Very good. These guys from out east know their stuff."
"The body is heavy and I can feel it in my stomach. Not exactly a low calorie beer or anything but its great if you take care not to ruin the beer."
"Drinkability: Yay for complex beers. This is a good and worthy adaptation of the Belgian quad style, and meant for slow enjoyment. I paired it with some rosemary & olive oil bread and a couple of mild Italian cheeses, and was quite satisfied."
"Tastes of caramel malts, dark fruits, a sting of bitterness and some alcohol for warmth. This was one hell of a treat."
"Note: I recently tried the cave-aged verison of this beer and it is like a totally different beer. Definitely worth the try if given the opportunity."
"Overall a tasty beer. I'm not a big fan of belgian beers, but this one is alright. Glad they have smaller bottles of this. Threw a couple down in my cellar to see how they do in a year or two...."
"Overall: Glad I tried it, but not my favorite in the class. The cherry notes bring in an added dimension but it's not quite enough to make this on a steller brew."
"As you gaze through the glass with some backlight it looks like a starry sky... with yeast sediment being the stars. Heavy lacing and a dark amber carmel color. Sweet smell with hints of fruit (cherry?) and possibly chocolate. Kind of heavy on Malt and perhaps dirt... but good dirt. Tastes yeasty, malty, and sweet with not much alcohol burn considering the ABV. Flavors described in the aroma are present as well. There are intense carbonation bubbles. It feels like there are thousands of them with each sip. Heavy and ass-kicking beer. A six pack should be streched out over a couple weeks and supplimented by lesser beers. Good Beer. Only about the third quadrupel I've ever had and it's my favorite of the ones I've had."
"The brew feels good on the mouth. It has a silky creamy mouthfeel and a nice twinge of astringency that leaves you wanting another sip. The only set back is a slightly higher carbonation level that seems to strip the flavors from your pallet. No worries, a few swirls in the glass alleviate that problem."
"Three Philosophers, Belgian-style blended beer, 9.8% Alcohol by Volume $6.49 Total Wine & More 536 W 21st St., Norfolk"
"Not a phenomenal quad but not a bad one either."
"D: It's a decent drink, though I prefer others over it... it is unique, I'll give it that. I would not turn it down, but might not be one I actively seek out."
"Looks like murky sewage and V8. Reddish brown pour with no head, floating chunks, and overall not appealing. Smells like a heller bock. Sweet sour maltiness but with a hint of alcohol as well. As it warms it smells a bit more of rubbing alcohol. Not a terribly appealing smell either. Taste is really rather dry, muddy and bland actually with alcohol definitely noticeable but i've had stronger alcohol tastes in less alcoholic beers. Cherry isn't really noticeable, but maybe comes through it the tartness rather than big cherry flavor. Reminds me of a cross between beer and wine. Like a carbonated wine almost. This isn't awful, but I don't see it being anybody's dream beer as its story and creation indicates. The best thing about this to me was that it didn't have the awful belgian yeast taste and smell that I really abhor. I actually liked it better than I thought I would, and it grew on me a touch."
"This is another one of my favorites. It pours a thick dark red with a 2 finger head that stays for a while then clings. Smell is that of dark fruits and malts with the cherry lambic very present. The taste is right there. Sweet not to roasted with a great mixture of the ale and lambic. Mouthfeel is a little heavy but creamy at the end. Drinkability is up there. I love it. A must pickup whenever I can find a big bottle."
"Note: I tried to cellar this beer and it didn't turn out to well. I think the ABV is too high. I purchased another and drank the same evening. much better."
"Like most of Ommegang's beers, Three Philosophers is a drinkable beer. Although it's not my favorite example of a quadrupel, it's still a fantastic beer."
" The Three Philosophers poured a deep rusty reddish color, wish a creamy off white head that quickly dissipated. There was no lacing on the inside of the crystal snifter, which has been the medium that I sample all of my beers in. The smell was sweet with hints of sour cherries and yeast. The taste was suburb both hoppy and fruity with a sour finish. This beer is a wonderful American take on a traditional Belgium quadruple. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Poured a deep burgandy color with a nice head that is well retained. Slight hints of cherry lambic, mint, caramel, and sweet sugars smell. Complex flavors of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, dryness, and herbal accents. Alcohol is hidden in the array of flavors and smells but is evident in it's drinkability. Overall a fine quadrupel from an outstanding brewery."
"D: Very Nice. Easy to drink with a little kick on the back of the throat."
"D: Crisp, clean and light. For me a good starter beer, but maybe not a good finisher beer for the night"
"This is the brandy of beers."
"D: Very easy to drink. The flavors have balanced out well over the years. Smooth on the tongue and throat."
"I might have served it a bit colder than recommended, so the cherry taste might not have been as strong as others. The beer is beautiful, poors with a large off-white head that disappears. Cloudy color with tiny particles bubbling around, color is somewhere between amber and red. Nose is moderatly citrus-hoppy with light yeast undertones (dough). Can also smell elements of Cherry/Casis, port wine and cinnamon. Taste starts lightly bitter with elements of fruit and over the long duration finishes moderatly sweet. Wait even longer and there is a slight nutty aftertaste on the rear end. Texture is somewhere between dry and creamy (I know that sounds wierd, but it is true). Carbonation is lively on this light to medium-bodied beer. Alcoholic notes on the finish. Very refreshing, quite good!"
"Heavily carbonated and a little sharp on the tongue. There is also a touch of alcohol that hangs around for a while in the back of the throat. After the beer warms up a bit the mouthfeel is a little better but I still think it's a tad over-carbonated. Actually, now that the beer is at room temp. the mouthfeel has improved."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but a sipper. I do not know if I could get through a 750 ml bottle due to the alcohol (nearly 10%!). This bottle is nice on a cold, snowy night. However the price (about $13 bucks for a 4 pack here) is such that I don't know when I will purchase it again."
"Three Philosophers pours a dark, opaque, plumish amber. The smell is really pleasant and uniquely aromatic of malts and cherries. Taste wise, this is very different, offering a nice mellow cherry flavor with absolutely no bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium thick, moderately carbonated, and very smooth. This drinks suprisingly easy for the alcohol, but it does pack a good punch."
"D: In the bottle the drinkability is probably a 4 but on tap this was amazing. This is actually better than quite a few Belgian quads I have tasted. Good job Ommegang/Duvel."
"D- This is a very interesting and complex brew that I do enjoy-but the blatant booziness of it all keeps the drinkability above average-but less than ""good."" This is my 5th quad and it falls in the middle of the 5 for me. I love Ommegang and their brews and through this isn't my favorite quad I will certainly have it again."
"malts,very complex.Taste- caramel, cordial cherrys, dark breads,toffee, malts then the lambic cherry finish. The complexity is amazing, it initially tastes like a Dubbel-dark,bready rich, malty,then suddedenly transforms itself into a light crisp lambic on the back of your palate,with a very clean finish. What a great experience. I cant imagine anyone in the US doing a better job."
"Drinkability- Quite nice. I haven't tried a lot of quadrupels, bt if this one is a good example, I'll start seeking them out. This one gives you the impression of exceptional pipe tobacco and a fine old cheese when you are drinking it. Hmmmm...maybe I'll do all 3! Good for sipping on a rainy day."
"Like the best ale I've had but with a slight hint of cherry lambic mixed in. Not like a Frambouise lambic which will carry a very direct fruit taste, this is truly an ale first with some of the lambic added. I would like this ale with a meal or late night snack, can be drank alone like I did but better with a Beef Strogenoff, or Chicken Fried Veil steak."
"This beer pours a deep copper-brown with a frothy off white head that dissipates to a ring with wisps of foam across the top of the beer. The beer leaves just a little lace. The smell is full of caramel and cherry notes. There is a lingering aroma of sherry as well. The taste is up front with sweetness initially, caramel and cherries. This is followed by a bit of hop bitterness and some phenolic and alcoholic flavors. The mouthfeel is nice for the style, medium-full bodied. Overall, a great beer. Maybe not a perfect quad, but an amazingly drinkable beer. While not as complex as some others, it brings enough to the table to keep you coming back for more."
"D: The flavor isn't a sweet and crazy as I had expected. It's quite complex, but it's not overpowering. Seems like this beer would age extremely well. I like this beer a lot, the flavor is nice and it's a bit unique. More of a sipper, and one bottle is plenty for one night."
"The latest brew that I've sampled from Ommegang, and this one is slighty over-the-top in terms of flavor and complexity... pours an outstanding dark, ruby-red color with immense foamy and frothy head with some staying power... smell is full of caramel malts and brown sugar... taste strongly complements the smell, with a thick and rich creaminess on the palate that hits home and is very overwhelming... taste is complete with esters, alcohol, malt, caramel, brown sugar, figs, and prunes.... extremely creamy mouthfeel with a compromised drinkability due to the rich and thick flavors and the hefty 9.8% ABV... overall, a very good brew that is definitely a sipper and should be enjoyed over a long period of time...in my opinion, Ommegang has produced better brews, but this is still a top-notch, quality sample... Recommended..."
"D - Very quick to enjoy, the high ABV clearly does not designate this as a session beer. Two is all you need. Sipper and enjoy!"
"D: This is a unique take on a quad, but very well done. It's really enjoyable and I'd recommend it. I can definitely see keeping this around. It'll be interesting to see how it ages as well, since this is 2007 vintage."
"Still wish I was in NYC, but found out the boys beer of choice is Heineken, I knew I should have offered them a Double Bastard from the trunk of my car."
"The taste starts with a strong sour fruitiness but quickly becomes full of bold complex malt and fruit tastes. It then ends with a slight warming sensation with the strength of the alcohol. As it warms a bit, the alcohol taste seems to come through a little more and bit more of the sour cherry taste sneeks in at the end of each sip. It consists of a nice full bodied mouthfeel that isn't real thin but not to overly thick either. Overall, it is a very good, full bodied complex and tasty brew that is both drinkable and enjoyable."
"Pours a nice, slightly murky, dark brown mahogany in color with just a half finger of tan head. Smells generally sour with cherries, caramel, chocolate and a bit of spiciness are present. Taste is complex. Big and malty with caramel and dark fruits, such as figs and dates. There are also some spices and esters (pepper, clove, coriander) in the background. Mouthfeel is good, medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this beer. I found it interesting and complex and the flavors really had melded together well in the ~3 years since it was brewed. I will recommend this one with enthusiasm."
"Incredibly smooth beer. Aroma of black cherry and alcohol. Taste lacks an initial presence, but you're soon hit with another strong cherry flavor tinged with sweet, dark malt. Color is very dark and murky, slightly rosy when held up to the light but the center of the beer remains dark. Goes down incredibly easy with a silky mouthfeel. Would definitely buy again in the near future."
"Very unique brew based on an exellent Abbey Ale. Huge complexity yet balanced enough to drink with many pairings."
"This beer was poured into a tulip glass to a ruby/copper color and no head to speak of, but nice lacing. The aroma is excellent with a sweet, malt and fruit smell. Similarly, the beer is sweetly malty and with a slight cheery flavor (as advertised), but the sweetness arrives first, but the rest of the finish carries the maltiness of the beer. Eminently drinkable with a medium mouthfeel, slightly carbonate, and a smooth texture. This beer actually meets expectations. Excellent."
"Pours a crystal clear deep caramel color with red highlights and has a two finger head that lasts forever. Lace almost coated the entire glass. Smells of caramel and dried fruit. Has that yeasty estery taste as well as the caramel and cherries. Has a high level of carbonation. Very nice sipper. I would have liked the cherries to be up front a little more, but still a very nice brew."
"Poured into an Ommegang gold-rimmed chalice, formed a dense inch tall tan head above the deeply reddish-brown brew. Aroma is quite yeasty, with it's other main essence being the whiff of the cherry lambic. Excellent lacing as drinking commenses, and the taste is pretty much as expected, with a heartier mouthfeel than you would expect and also a lessening for the tart mouthfeel that you would expect from the cherry lambic. It seems the quadrupel ale tastes are upfront, with the cherry flavors wandering along afterward, giving the aftertaste an interesting change. A novel product from Ommegang, and worth the trouble to obtain, for occasional enjoyment, but not an everyday in my book."
"Bought at Binny's in Elmwood Park, IL"
"Pours a clouded ruby with a light tan head. Nose is heavy with sugar and alcohol. Flavor is extremely sweet. Pungent cherry tones. Strong quad tones with that very noticeable cherry lambic presence. Feel is thin. Lacks body and grace. Drinkability stays low due to extreme mix of flavors. Overall it is an okay brew IMO. I dont feel as though it holds any character that helps it stand out against the rest of those of its kind. Ommegang is good, but this time for me they are not good enough to warrant a return to this one."
"... and a good value."
"It pours a very nice brown red with good one to two finger head. head has decent retention. The nose is nice, smells like it came from belgium. dark fruits with the slightest cherry hint. Taste is quite thin. The dark raisin flavors are there and the candy sugars are there but kind of weak. The finish is ok and has a very coppery taste. The taste does not linger well. Mouthfeel is quite thin for a quad. A very good shot, but just not belgian! The cherries dont add alot of flavor. Drinkability is ok, and the sugar residue does hang on the lips. I recommend trying it, but there are certainly better quads out there."
"This is silky smooth, great feel. Moderately carbonated, slightly sticky. There is a great warming feel to this. This is my kind of beer. Highly enjoyable, but a bit too boozy for many."
"Just tried the 2009 edition and was equally amazed. It's good to see this Belgian ale stay in my highest regard, even as my tastebuds mature."
"...WIlly.. outa Wanaque, NJ"
"I can drink this alone by the fireplace with my sweetie cuddled up next to me. Great with Flemish beef stew. Venison would go nice. I can also imagine it with dessert courses as well."
"Smooth mouthfeel, good carbonation. Rich and luxurious body. Not a lot of booziness despite the high alcohol. Very easy to drink."
"I was surpised how evident the alcohol was in this beer. I think it dominates with the malt and fruity elements only noticed in the background. It does have a bit of a wild funky taste that makes this beer rather unique. Medium bodied with good carbonation ease consumption but the alcohol warming may be a little too much. Definately a sipper."
"Caramel toffee flavors, black cherry, low bitterness in the finish is the only indication of hops in the finish. Medium bodied with perceivable drying alcohol. It's about what I remember from the bottle I had a year or so ago. Not my favorite from Ommegang, but worth trying if you find it on tap."
"Very very easy to drink. I was very impressed with this beer. I would not think twice on purchasing another bottle of this fine brew. Highly recommended to any BA. This Quadruple is cultured yet wild, curious yet wise."
"D - It's a great beer to sample and try. A night of Three Philosophers would be tough to do, but a glass every know and then won't only be enjoyable, but reccomended."
"Pours a ruby black-brown with a thin tan head that leaves a bit of lacing. The smell is leather, baked cherries and phenols. Very different. The taste is bitter up front, then tart cherries, then a rum-fruit flavor. There are some raisins in there. Interesting but very odd. The finish is dusty dry. I love quadrupels and I really like lambics. This....is just not for me. The mouthfeel is silky and carbonated, right on the money. The drinkability is limited by the acidic leather taste up front and the dry dry finish. Nice try but I'd have to recommend several of their other beers over this one."
"D - I won't be gulping this down at tailgate parties, but it's a nice after dinner beer. Or two."
"D - A little high on the abv to drink a lot of but this is my second night with the bottle and its a great sipping beer to have and relax with"
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. I find this more in line with a Dubbel with a special twist than a Quad or Belgian Dark Strong in terms of richness of flavors. Everything is well balanced and very enjoyable. At less than ten dollars a bottle this is a terrific deal. (4.5)"
"With Ommegang, this is my favorite product from the Cooperstown-based brewery. It does not disappoint, packs a smooth punch, and is right at the top of domestic Belgian-style beers. It's also great for sharing and sampling, and easy to make converts to it. Nearly perfect, in my humble opinion."
"Drinkability- For me the drinkability on this one is high. I give it a 4.5 on these grounds. I'm not sure that others can handle all the belgian qualities of this beer, but I like it."
"D:: Would have only one at a sitting but would choose another as a second choice just to wake up the tastebuds."
"Overall, an average quad."
"D  A nice sipping beer. I really enjoyed this beer, but drinking it wont be a regular thing."
"I'm in love. This is one of my favorite beers, and another notch on Ommegang's belt. Try it, you'll like it."
"Rating the 2006 - Poured into a tulip glass with a thick off-white/light tan head that quickly dissipated into a thin layer of foam that skimmed the top of the brew. Good lacing adherence during the sampling. Color was a deep garnet red/brown color. Very subtle smell of dark fruit similar to a red wine bouquet. Complex flavor that was difficult to describe but pleasant to imbibe; flavors of dark fruit (plums, cherries, grapes). Nice tart mouthfeel with a pleasant bite to the tongue. Finished with a subtle feeling of alcohol astringency and mild carbonation. Very pleasant and not as strong as I anticipated from a 9+% abv."
"Poured out a nice copper color with a godo head and a bit of lacing. Has a vaguely sweet smell with a hint of alcohol, which goes for the malty and alcholol taste, as well. Goes down fairly smoothly, with just a bit of roughness at the end. This would have been a great beer if the abv wasn't quite so noticable. While it's interesting to have a 9+% beer, if I wanted that much of the taste, I'd have scotch. Still worth a try, though, it's still quite good."
"750 ml bottle from Bevmo. Poured a gorgeous coffee brown with red around the edges, there is just a slight haze. Head is khaki colored, three fingers large, sudsy and long lingering. Aroma was light with cherries and allspice. Flavor is ripe with raisins, sour cherries, something floral, coffee, chocolate, and musty yeast. This brew has a good balance of spicy, sweet and sour. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying, carbonation is light and prickly. Finish is dry, weak and short with a bit of alcohol showing. Overall something is missing that would make this a truly great beer, even so, it commands a lot of respect."
"ok. If I were going to make a beer out of a cherry fruit roll-up, this would be it. Don't get me wrong, I used to love fruit roll-ups as a kid. This is a fruit roll-up in a bottle for adults. I think as I'm drinking more of it I'm having more fun, and I'm still on my first glass..."
"Deep ruby brown beer with a 2 finger creamy tan head. Little lacing. Aroma is of cherries and malty sweetness. Taste is pleasantly tart and cherry sweet up front, with a nice bitterness balancing out the background. Mouhtfeel is rather spritzy due to the carbonation, but is rather heavy on the palate. Much thanks to the Ommegang folks for another fabulous brew."
"a heavy beer, not very drinkable in large quantities. reminds me of the Sprecher scotch ale i had in vegas in terms of heaviness. tasty, though and Id probably have it again."
"Poured a dark brown/amber color with generous off-white head. Aroma was a malty sweetness with a bit of fruit. Flavor is very much like the aroma except the cherry tartness is more evident. Mouthfeel is good. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. An enjoyable experience."
"The first glass was right out of the fridge and a little too chilly, now I am on my second which is warmer. The malt and spices come through better, I'd recomend letting this one sit a while before drinking it. I feel the greatest part about this beer is it hides the alcohol very well. 9.8% and it tastes more like 6% or so even after it warms up, It did a good job at warming me up, too."
"Poured slowly into a kwak glass (the kind that you need some wooden holder). The carbonation is so very powerful I let it sit for a few minutes...also so that the yeast in the remaining beer can settle as well since the first pour was stopped early from such a big head. The retention in the head is very very good. The color ranges from dark ruby brown to light brown at the neck of the glass. The smell is Belgian candy sugar and spices. There is also some clove in the smell. The taste is lighter than expected. The sweetness is not as much as you'd think, the clove stands out in the aftertaste with spices in the background. The taste is nice, but the aftertaste is bitter with sweetness still on your mind. Overall I would have another one, just not very soon."
"Bottle, 2005. Drank half the bottle the night before last, made the mistake of serving it too cold. First impression was not good, not pleasant at all. Drank the rest last night, served at about 60, much, much better. Cherry aroma. Flavor was a wonderful mix of cherry, chocolate and berrys. Very warming. Excellent !!!"
"Color is a beautiful reddish-brown. When I first popped open the bottle, the aroma was very strong and malty with an alcohol nip - it said ""Drink me!"" very clearly. Flavor is rich, mainly malty with some hop bitterness and hints of cherry and caramel with just a touch of sweetness. Smooth and mouth-filling, this is one delightful ale."
"This beer I tried for the first time at my tasting club's 'Belgian Night.' I remarked that it tasted like root beer a little, with a little bit of cherries. It is soda-ish, and I appreciated its effervescent qualities, as the alcohol content is so high. A quad would be a beer I can't handle well, so I had about two shot glasses worth. I would drink this again, in a small glass nonetheless, but I am proud of myself for at least trying different and bigger Belgian beers ."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer but w/ out a doubt this is a sipping beer. Goes well w/ a lot of different food."
"Pours a dark ruby-ish brown color with a sizable loosely packed tan head that steadily collapses on itself leaving splotches of lacing in its wake. The aroma is unique. Very complex and difficult to pick out individual scents. Dark fruits, cherries, fresh cut wood, yeast and caramel meld nicely. The taste was surprising and almost offensive at first. But it finishes cleanly and I find myself quickly going back for more. There's so much going on with this beer that I'm having a hard time dissecting it. The alcohol is hiding backstage waiting for the final act to reveal itself. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, yet there is plenty of prickly carbonation. This is a good beer that I will surely revisit. I'll likely grab another bottle or two and forget about them for a few years to see what happens."
"Appearance shows a rich dark brown with a strong thick head. Smell of dried cherries and sweet malt. Taste has the sweet tartness of dried cherries with spice and a slice of bread. Mouthfeel has full body to it with a good carbonation. My 1st full taste of a quad, I'd like to try others to make a comparison, but it's not bad. Makes me want a cigar."
"A very good dinner-party beer that won't burn a hole in your wallet. Yet another beer you can safely hand to your wine-drinking friends."
"Overall this is a good, interesting and complex brew that seems to balance all the contrasting flavors well, definitely worth having on a crisp fall evening."
"Pours a deep amber-brown, opaque, with a finger of tan head that dissolves fairly quickly. Solid lacing. Nose os crazy strong toffee malt, lots of spiciness too, and light dried fruit. Taste is similar, lots of toffee malt, some alcohol presence (although it's fairly well covered for a near-10% ABV). Cotton candy, dried fruit, and a touch of licorice. A light hit of hops at the back end. Body is full and creamy with fairly low carbonation, although it works here nicely. I liked this one a lot, although it's not quite in the same league as some of the really mind-blowing quads out there. For the price ($3 for a 12 oz), I'd go back for more any day."
"I'm a big fan of Ommegang, this one is one of my favorites."
"D: Moderately easy to put down but not one to quench your thirst but rather to smell the roses over."
"Comments: A very likeable beer. I have added it to my list of quads worth having and sharing with friends."
"Opinion: This is a very complex beer. I definitely like that it has a whole lot going on in the flavor. The alcohol is a little distracting for me in that it is so strong that it has a tendency to muddle all of the flavors a bit. I have had the beer fresh, and I seem to recall that it was easier to drink. I am assuming that was from the oxidation, and is not a vintage thing. It says on the label to enjoy immediately, and I would take that recommendation in the future."
"The taste reveals a bit more of the herbal smell through a very smooth and wonderful mouthfeel. Carbonation is present, but not to strong, keeping this quad very drinkable."
"Medium-thin body with sparse carbonation, yet enough to keep this from being overly sweet or cloying. Easily, and thoughtfully consumed."
"Palate is a rather ordinary sour lambic, perhaps sour brown like New Belgium's la folie, but with a modest amount of the cherry kriek in the mix. Honestly I can't figure out why this beer exists, and why it is reviewed so highly. It tastes neither like a traditional quad, nor like a good fruit lambic. It's almost as if it was a mediocre quad so they had to add the cherry lambic to offset the poor results. Nothing extraordinary here other than the cool name and bottle."
"Found one last bottle marked 2005 and picked it up. Poured a slightly cloudy reddish brown with little head (there was more of a head when I poured more after the bottle had warmed a little). Smells absolutely incredible, hard to describe other than distinctly Belgian with a hint of cherries. Taste reminds me of Chimay Blue plus the sour taste of the cherry lambic. Very good beer, but found myself wishing I had someone to share the bottle with. Aside from the drinkability, a top notch beer!"
"Perfect amount of cherry lambic added. Its not overwhelming but adds character to the brew. Its not a typical quad, but worth a try at least once. Ommegang has always been a great American brewer of Belgian beers, but I'm mixed on this one and may have to revisit in a few years."
"This is seriously hitting the spot and I think a large part of that is drinking it at the right temperature. Heed what it says on the bottle: try it lightly chilled. And pair it up with some cheese for Pete's sake, even if it's just sharp cheddar."
"Three Philosophers is an excellent quad. I have many of these bottles, so I'm laying quite a few of them down and can't wait to see how they turn out."
"D: Surprisingly high regarding it's ABV the lambic side brings it up but down at the same time. The tartness and sweetness can get overwhelming."
"Overall this is a very good brew. I think this is also my first quadrupel and I'm pleased."
"This is a very fine quadrupel. Mine was from a smaller bottle with no cork, so I'm wondering if the company may have downsized the quantity from the 750 ml. It pours a very dark brown, hazy color with a reasonable head, decent retention and some lacing. You can almost see the candied sugars in the glass. This is a medium to full bodied beer and has the carbonation to go along with it. This is a Belgian style for sure. The smell is sweet malts, some raisin, some caramel, maybe other fruits as it warms a bit. The color seems to mellow as it warms as well. The taste is strong malts, warming alcohol tones, some raisin, cherries, and some caramels. There were some pepperish snaps, but these seem to fade as the beer mellows. The down side is that the alcohol is too prevalent. The after taste is mild, and the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It is just the overly strong alcohol tastes that compromise this beer for me. It's good, but not brilliant. L'Chaim"
"A real treat from this New York partner of Duvel."
"Pours rich medium reddish brown with 2"" off-white head and very active bubbles moving up through the body. Good head retention with contant production of new small bubbles. The aroma was pretty floral, maybe lillies, mild with a hint of cherries. The initial flavor was of brown sugar and malt with a little sour yeast that grades quickly into a long-lived complex aftertaste that picks up the cherry lambic. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with creamy texture and very active carbonation. Overall, this is a solid beer and is not overly sweet despite the lambic addition. This makes a great dessert beer that stands up well on its own. We tried it with dark chocolate truffles toward the end of the glass, and it seemed a little overpowered. Maybe try something a little more delicate like vanilla creme brulee. You could also try with roast pork for a main course beer."
"I dont think Three Philosophers should call itself a quadrupel. It is a unique beer that doesnt fit well with other quadruples. It has its own wonderful style."
"D: In ""Osso Buco," Billy Collins writes, ""the lion of contentment / has placed a warm, heavy paw on my chest."" Finish 750 ml of this brew and you'll know what he means. With the high ABV, the lion starts sneaking up on you after only a few swallows. Although the flavor is surprisingly mild and light, you won't open a second one unless you want to make jelly of your brain. Regardless, popping the cork and passing an hour or so with this brew has proved to be a most delightful experience. I look forward to enjoying another one on a cold, rainy winter day."
"and the flavor is awesome, too. big, warm, malty, yeasty, bready, tartycherry...this stuff is great. what else...oh yeah, i love this stuff"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are on par with the style. These are I think the toughest to rate for this style."
"D: As mentioned above, a unique taste thats hearty and rich. This might make a good dessert beer, but certainly not one to start off the night."
"This is one complex brew. Very smooth, a dessert beer to just sip and enjoy. I'll make room for this brew more often."
"Pours a reddish brown with a tall white foamy head. Smells sweet with cherry notes and some alcohol tones. Also has some yeasty characteristics. The flavor is pretty similar with the alcohol and cherry coming through at first with the yeasty notes to follow. It has a smooth taste with good carbonation. It has a decent drinkablilty but high ABV which makes this hard to have more than a few. This is worth checking out. Enjoy."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 750ml brown glass Belgian-style bomber, sealed with a cork and wire cage, served in a Belgian chalice."
"Pretty good but just seemed to be missing something. I certainly would not turn one down, but I wouldn't go looking for it again, either."
"Great complexity. Smooth as all hell. I really enjoyed this one and will pick some more up soon."
"A little bit of alcohol heat on the finish."
"D: Quite strong. The taste was ever so slightly subdued which I believe actually promotes its drinkability. I would drink it again if given the opportunity."
"Copper to red in color with a nice two finger head. In the body, a glimpse of sediment floats around. Smell reminds me of black licorish, yeast, spice, and cherries. The first thing you think when this beer hits your tongue is how much cherry is in the flavor. The beer actually has a bit of cherry lambic mixed into the receipe, but it sometimes became cloying. More black licorish, with touhes of bourbon and banana. A sweet treat to end my night."
"D: A very interesting experiment of a beer and certainly worth a try. I enjoyed it but not as much as I'd enjoyed pure quad's in the past."
"D - Although I was expecting something bolder (stronger), this is a very satisfying quad - particularly for those that prefer a less sweet, less heavy dark Belgian. I'd love to try this on tap."
"The mouthfeel is good, but would be better if the carbonation was toned down a touch. The carbonation is more prickly when it first enters your mouth and then becomes softer as you hold it in your mouth. It is full bodied."
"This brew opens with a torrent of foam ebbing out of the bottle. The beer pours a clear brownish-red color with a thick, rocky, light tan head. The aroma is of prunes, dates, and cherries. The taste is of dates, prunes, caramel, malt, and has a hint of cherry. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a high level of fine carbonation. Overall, this is a nice brew, and perhaps the best American made quadrupel I have yet had."
"D - A bit much for more then one pint at a pop, but oh what a pint. Very good quad, goes down smooth and leaves you with something to ponder"
"I have seen Ommegang beers in my local Wegmans for quite some time now and just passed them by. This may be due to their obscure location in the cooler or maybe my unwillingness to explore outside of the standard 12oz and pint servings of beer. My friend turned me on to this company and wow is this beer amazing. No, its not the every day drinking beer but rather something you can sit down and enjoy a bottle of with a friend, it also goes great with a cigar as the potent aroma and taste still make their way through the smoke to your taste buds. In the same way that good scotch is great after being aged this beer gets better and more flavorful with age. Only downside really is its a bit gassy of a beer."
"Poured out of a 2005 corked and caged 750ml bottle. The color is a deep brown with ruby highlights, a fantastic tan head that took its time dissipating. Some spotty lacing left on the glass. The smell is of dark cherries, figs, carob. The taste has a big cherry hit due to the added lambic, the sweetness is offset with a nice roasted malt backbone, has hints of tobacco. Maybe just a hair too sweet. This is a very flavorful brew. The feel is well carbonated and well bodied. The drinkability is scary with the 9.8% ABV, this goes down way easy. Ommegang hit it out of the park with their Quad."
"D- This one actually surprised me on how much I liked it. Every other Ommegang I haven't been a fan of at all. This one is really tasty and can see myself buying it again when I am finally out of quads."
"All in alll, a very drinkable brew. I don't think I'd undertake more than 1 of the larger bottles at time. I'm looking forward to picking up a 4 pack of the 12 oz. bottles so I could include a smaller portion in an evening of multiple delights."
"Very glad a friend from Cooperstown introduced this to me."
"this is quite possibly the best beer i have ever had. beautiful redddish brown with a wheaten colored head. smells like cherries and toffee. very nice. the taste is fruity upfront, but leads up to nice complexity. sweetness mixes with roasted notes and tofee flavors round out a sharpness. the finish is slightly warming in the chest. very nice. extremely drinkable. a few members have described as luxurious. in new hampshire we would said this kicks major ass. great brew."
"I am not the biggest Quad fan, but I do appreciate a good one when I come across it. The biggest problem I had with this one was the addition of cherry Iambic. This seemed to enhance the already existing sweetness to a level too high for me. It was also a bit too carbonated for my taste. I did appreciate the warmth of the alcohol and its beautiful ruby red appearance. Definitely not a bad beer (better than many) but there are Quads I prefer."
"Incredibly complex/ambiguous beer. Would almost certainly due well with cellaring."
"D - This beer can be described in one word: luxurious. Very complex, tasty beer that will leave few dissatisfied. Definitely worth a try."
"Beer poured a decent brown color into my Schlitz chalice. Not much head. Aroma is very strong, malty with definite raisin smell to it. A bit of chocolate essence but not much. Taste is very strong with a coffee/caramel essence and alcohol in the background. The alcohol is subdued here, which is nice. I really like the taste though. It's also roasty with a black coffee edge to it. Yum."
"This is one of the more disappointing quads I've had. You should definitely spend a couple more dollars to get the good stuff if you're in the market."
"Very enjoyable. I'll buy it again as an excellent and cheaper alternative to more expensive Belgian style beers."
"A little lambic tartness evident in the nose, otherwise sweet and boozy, with background grain. In the mouth, rather thin, with pretty obvious strength, a bit of cola bite, some medicinal/tea bitterness, some dark cherry, and then little hints of malt action, but not all that much. Not objectionable, but I think I was hoping for more."
"A smooth texture is lightened significantly by a mellow epervesent carbonation. Very complex in flavor and high in drinkability. Better than I expected, an awesome beer."
"Pours a murky, nutty brown with just the vaguest of amber highlights, along with an off-white dusting of a head. Aromas of bitter chocolate, dark candi sugar, pear and cherry fruits, and some yeast. On the palate, bitter cherry fruits felt on the sides of the tongue, matched by figgy malt sweetness before a dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fulsome carbonation. Overall, this beer is better than I remember it being. Nice fruit, rich malts, high ABV that doesn't burn. Very good."
"D - A great pleasure for my taste buds. Sweet, strong, balanced and complex - a great example of a hybrid of styles done with inspiration and skill. A superb fruit blend with Quadruple punch. Not gentle in heft, but graceful and sophisticated all the while. Perhaps the most drinkable Quad I have had. Versatile to the extreme. Could be poured and enjoyed with desserts or a variety of main courses. A really delicious brew that can be enjoyed easily all by itself."
"This is a very wine like beer, i think it it would be a suprise to those sad folks who hate beer and like wine, especially darker earthier wines. This is a very good and suprising beer. drinkability takes a hit. but its extremely good"
"Not as attenuated as something like Rochefort 10, but is still very digestable. I remember the taste of this beer being more ""bright"" I think with time and poor storage the beer seems to have take a dull like quality. Still very good though."
"Three Philosophers pours like dark amber-maple syrup, and while sipping it, it's almost as thick. About the only beer I've had which is thicker would be various barley-wines. The aroma is complementary to the flavor in that you get a hint of the cherries, but it comes out when sipping it. I say sipping it because it's kind of like a bourbon, too strong to quaff, but the characteristics come out when sipping it. It's quite sweet, which means that it's hard to drink a lot of it... but somehow, it leaves me wanting more anyway."
"This is an incredibly tasty and well made brew. Barely being able to perceive the alcohol makes a brew this tasty dangerously drinkable..."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice and interesting Quadrupel. Fairly easy to drink, especially at 9.8% ABV."
"750ml caged and corked bottle, 2005 vintage. Murky brown bottle with slight ruby-red highlights and a half an inch of light tan head. Smells like raisin, roasty caramel and brown sugar. Tastes like raisin, caramel, with a bit of a woody character. Full creamy mouthfeel with a fair bit of carbonation. Very well balanced and extremely drinkable. By far and away one of the finest beers I have ever had the pleasure of having and the best Quad I have ever had. Practically perfect in every way."
"Overall it's a very good brew, I'm not disappointed but I don't know if I'd pick this up again. It was good, just nothing that overly impressed me. It pretty much tastes exactly like it should, like a belgian that had some cherry lambic added to it. I think I'd be more happy to just have the quadruple part of the beer and skip the cherry lambic. Might be something good to serve to someone who doesn't really like beer who usually sticks to wines or sweeter drinks."
"Pours a quite dark ruby colour..very smooth..has a nice amount of bitters..has a regal sweetness to it..lacing is low, but present..intriguing smell..quadrific!..cherries add a different twist...wl cross off...Had been on my wishlist for a while, and it didn't really disappoint me.."
"1/2/08 Edit: About a month and a half ago I had a cave aged bottle of Three Philosophers, 2006 vintage, and it was absolutely incredible. So smooth, so tasty. Today I'm enjoying a bottle, 2005 vintage, that has been in my own cellar for about 9 months, and it too has smoothed out and is really nicce. Negligible tartness and a smoother, more pleasant cherry flavor. Ratings have been upgraded accordingly. This is a great brew with some age on it."
"An okay attempt at a Belgian ale. Flavor is pretty lacking, but it's not bad. I was just hoping for something more. Worth trying if you're curious."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle to chalice, with a rich dark plum-like appearance with a large head and very nice retention. The smell of good, trademark quadrupel spices with a light cherry scent. The taste begins with a thin mixing of the contents, spicy yet smooth with rich, thick dark cherry finish. Interesting how the cherries are light in the scent, but strong and dark in the taste. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and creamy, chewy enough to bite down into. A good sipper, but the dark cherry aftertaste puts a very slight damper on the drinkability but not enough to keep me from going for this one on several occasions."
"Wonderfully complex and drinkable beer, I would love to see this on cask and if I can put it down I'll save a bottle or two for next winter."
"This was just luscious. A beauty in every respect, a true malt lover's brew and as close as you can get to a great Holiday dessert in liquid form. Outstanding. Will definitely keep a bottle or two around for special meals or a great treat. Highly recommended!"
"D: A beautiful brew to behold and quite complex. A dinner beer that is to be sipped and enjoyed. Tastes flourish was the beer warms. Highly recommended."
"D-Dangerously good for the %. This one is a winner and one i will revisit especially with Fresh Direct delivering."
"brewed in 2005  750 ml. bottle- color of deep reddish mahogany , with a thick frothy tan head - nose of malt , dark cherries , white flowers , and assorted red fruit  taste of deep red cherries , bitter chocolate , roasted , dried apricots , slightly sour , and milky - body is medium , and well carbonated  aftertaste of sweet/ sour , red fruit , berries , and hints of chocolate"
"On the palate it is not as complex as I recall from an on-tap serving I had last year...rich and malty, fairly sweet but not cloying, a solid example of a dark brown Belgian ale but doesn't thrill me. At least it's cheaper than an import."
"The bottom line: not a bad blend, but I think I would rather have a straight quad, or a straight cherry lambic."
"Poured a dark reddish amber, great fizzy dissipating head with sticky lace as an after effect. Nice yeasty aromas dominate- some fruity malts, a hint of spice. Notable belgian yeast flavors, fresh berries and sticky malts at first taste. Extremely well carbonated, and dry like an expensive champagne. Mild hops come through in the finish, along with a yeasty sourness that evens out the sweetness. Interesting blend- the quad style mixes well with the lambic berry flavors- a very refreshing brew with a deceptively high abv. Not my pick for Ommegang's, best but well worth a try."
"D - This is a fasinating beer. I love the kriek taste added to a quadrupel."
"Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of quads; and even if you're not it's still worth a try."
"750 ml bottle, brewed in 2005. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a small tan head. It smells like cherries, pepper, and other dark fruit. The aroma wasn't very strong. It tastes spicy (pepper and cloves) and like cherries, herbs, caramel and dark fruit. Finishes bitter, peppery and sour, and a bit dry with some alcohol warming too. Mouthfeel is medium, with a lot of carbonation. It's also a little bit slick. Drinkability is OK, but would be better if the carbonation was lower. Overall I think it's good, but I wasn't impressed with this beer. That being said, I'd try it again in the future but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."
"This one may just be to overly complex to make it a session beer. It's not the 9.8 ABV that scares me, I've had much higher and have made a session out of them . I think this one is just a tad to complicated for my taste bubs to make me yearn for more than one."
"Highly recommended. A wonderful take on the quad style (and by an American brewer no less). I'd love to see some more quads blend in a bit of kriek - adds a nice dimension."
"Disappointing - I have been looking forward to this beer and was happy to hear it had landed in Texas. It *could* be a good beer - IMO it just needs more attention to fermentation of the base (98%) beer and blending."
"A great sipping beer...not for everyone, an acquired taste...but a wonderful selection for those who enjoy Belgian beers."
" Highly enjoyable, a wonderful Quad and the cherries only add a nice fruit complexity. American's can Brew Belgians!!"
"Ultra complex and a thrill to drink. The cherry lambic adds a little tartness to the overall sweet and smooth drink. Enjoy with someone else, as this one is a bit heavy."
"This one sips pretty light but burns going down until about mid glass. I can't picture drinking this regularly. It's a flavor experience but one I would take in moderation."
"Now, I usually don't go talking about prices for beers, but at five bucks a pop, this is just an unbelievable deal. And now that my Ommegang stash is winding down, I'll have to jump over to Sconnie to grab some more."
"D- Pretty good. While not in love, I do enjoy it, which is good since the afformentioned friend loves it. The alcohol needs to tone down a bit, perhaps go sit in the corner and think about what he's done."
"I have only had a few quadrupels, but this American brew held its own with its Belgian counterparts. If it was not $7 per bottle I would have one everyday."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown color with at thick head and pretty lacing. The smell is a bit sour and perhaps malty. The taste is malty with definite sour and sweet notes  a hint of fruitiness. The mouthfeel is full, but not chewy. Overall, this is a well balanced ale that Id recommend."
"High % means it's not a session brew but it is still a very nice quad and worthy of another go in the near future."
"Drinkability: Lacking in complexity, I thought, but good overall if you know what you're getting into."
"I can hardly stand to finish just one. For those who like sweet fruity beers, this is for you but it isn't my cup of tea nor it is a good quad. It is far to sweet, fruity and artificial; contrived is a good word to describe it. Give me a real quad like Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12 or any other quad out there, this can't even being to approach them."
"D - Excellent...except for the price. My parents got this for me as a gift and they paid eight or nie bucks for the big bottle. Honestly, this is good stuff but I wouldn't buy it again for this price."
"Overall, very nice. Highly recommended to fans of Belgian-style ales. Also good for cherry fans who are put off by sour ales. This is a popular ale in my house, and I will definitely be picking it up again."
"Poured into a goblet a rich dark amber almost brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. There was a beautiful two-finger head that was slow diminish and left great lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong of cherries and carbon-dioxide, almost like Cheerwine! Taste was absolutely wonderful. The vibrant cherry flavor was accented with a complex malt flavor and very subtle hops that were almost unnoticeable, but they did their job. This beer was vibrantly carbonated, once again, almost feels like Cheerwine in the mouth. It is very hard to tell that this is 9.8% alcohol. I'd have to say, this is almost certainly my favorite beer made with fruit. Very enjoyable any time of year."
"My favorite beer. Strong, yet sensitive. Brash, yet reluctant. A high alcohol beer, strong on malts and hops but also a very strong dark cherry aftertaste. Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed, but also wanting a little more. Pours a dark red/mahogany. You only need one for a night, if that. It is heavy and filling, but the taste is very complex and surprisingly smooth."
"A pretty decent beer in the end, but would need a good reason to drink it again. Maybe with a good food pairing?"
"D - a little too sweet to want a lot of this, but overall a very nice brew!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass. Appears a dark mahogany with a finger of dark tan foam. Smells of dried fruits and sweet caramel malt. Tastes of dried sweet dark fruits such as cherry and plum. Spicy notes and then the sweet malt comes through. Moderate carbonation and slightly heavy on the tongue. This is a great dessert beer, one of the best. Definitely one to sip. Cheers."
"Shared the 750 ml bottle with a very good friend of mine (actually it was his beer that I gave him for Christmas). This is the 2005 batch. Appearance of a golden-tan cider/straw color. Very thin head - great retention. Wonderfully complex smells: brown sugar, cider, cherry, apple, molasses, bread. Overall smells like a delicious apple crumble or apple pie. Tastes of the apple, with tangy cherry in the center and aftertaste. I really enjoy the addition of the cherry lambic to the quadrupel - it complements the apple and sugar flavors without overpowering them. Good thickness to the mouthfeel - like a thick cider. Overall, a wonderful beer. Lots of light, complex flavors and aromas. Would gladly buy another for my friend so I could split it with him (just kidding!)"
"Poured from a 2005 750ml bottle into an Ommegang cervoise, the quad is a deep mahogany that has a bottled conditioned cloudiness, although I didn't purposely swirl the yeast. A vigorous pour produced a large tan head with medium bubbles, that quickly subsided to a 1 finger collar, leaving some thick, sticky lace. The aroma is very rich and complex, earthy and vinous and mainly sour cherries. The taste is sweet, rich malt, caramel, prunes and yeast, reminiscent of Gulden Drak, but with a very pleasant tartness from the Cherry lambic and brett. that really takes it to the next level, before fading to a boozy and slightly dry finish. The 3 Philosophers had a moderate mouthfeel and a great flavor profile that takes a while to unlock, but is a bit rich to drink more then a bottle or too of...that said, it is choice for enjoying with a robust cigar, such as a Romeo y Julieta Reserva Real # 2 Belicoso, which is suburb."
"A bit of a poor man's St. Bernardus Abt 12 but at a pretty nice price for a decent quadrupel."
"D- Wonderful , will have again .."
"cheers!"
"Drinkability- I would love to bring this with me to a bring your own restaurant. This easily takes the place of a wine when accompanied by any high end meat. Beautiful for long romantic nights, or a very quiet elegant sitting. Really is a mood maker. I'll buy it again when I have an occasion for it."
"Excellent, excellent beer. Tried it on a whim at RFD in downtown DC. Saw it listed on tap, and selected it because it was the most expensive one on the menu! Was pleasantly surprised.. it was very smooth and rich. Complex in taste, with lots of sugar, caramel, apple, pepper, honey, cinnamon, and anise coming through. Had another glass just to make sure I liked it as much as I had initially thought.. and oh yeah, it's an excellent, excellent beer."
"makes a great afternoon by sitting around sipping the whole bottle."
"I am new to this site and also to the art of beer reviewing, so please forgive this review if it is a bit rudimentary. Three Philo's, quite simply, is outstanding. It is a full bodied, dark and very tasty. This brew also packs a 10%ABV punch, so be careful. It tastes so good, you tend not to realize that once glass of this potion equals about 3 of your domestic beers. The main reason this beer strikes my fancy is the intense taste that it brings to the table. It's not something that you can just drink and not give it a second thought. It makes you stop to realize the quality of beverage that is flooding your palate. It makes you sit up and recognize that this is not just another beer. Thats all for now!"
"this bottle has been preserved very well. i would prefer all my 3 philos to have a few years on them."
"D - This is my first time trying an entire bottle of this, and as expected, Ommegang nailed it again. I consider them a great alternative to wine for those special occasions, but they also make for a great relaxation beer...I sampled this one after a pretty rough day at work, when I just wanted to relax. An excellent Quad from a great brewery. I'm going to pick up some more to cellar them, because I'm sure this ages beautifully!"
"Drinkability: This is 9.8% ABV? Cannot taste the alcohol at all. The mixing of the cherry lambic and quad makes for an interesting and nice flavor. Different tastes dart in all over in flashes , some of which stay for awhile in the long lingering finish , complex - but delicately so."
"CO2 level seemed to be just right for this brew, and mouthfeel was smooth and very drinkable. A fantastic quad that is so easy to acquire, I cannot believe that this is my first time trying it."
"D - Good. It is a very enjoyable quad. I've had it before and I will have it again."
"If someone offered me a 12 oz, or a glass of this beer, I would gladly accept, but nothing more. I'd like to revisit this beer again sometime, but only in a smaller portion."
"Drinkability - Definetly a unique brew that I'm glad I tried, though a bit too strong/ meaty to have on a regular basis. Have this one on an empty stomach as it is very filling. Definetly a brew all serious beer drinkers need to try and one I look forward to trying again a year or 2 from now."
"Aroma is sweet, fruity. Taste is malty up front, candy like, slightly cherry. Good medium body, a little creamy, nice dry alchohol finish. Overall this is a pretty good brew, as far as belgian style beers go though there are many that are better. Worth a try at the very least."
"I can't recommend this enough. Definitely one of my favorite beers, and probably the best I've reviewed thus far. For complexity and versatility, you can't beat this."
"You really can't take this one in a half hour. Need to pair it with something, cheese of any variety I think will do."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This is one of my personal favorites and I usually have a 750ml in my fridge at all times. A great buy, if you get a chance, try it!"
"Pours a deep reddish color with good clarity. Smell is sweet, malty with hints of cherry. Flavor suffers from an excessive sweetness that is rather cloying. This was a 2006 bottling, so maybe it was still too young, but the flavors just didn't seem to meld together well."
"Cheers!"
"Other comments: A nice idea for Ommegang to blend one of their ""Belgian-style"" beers with a true Belgian beer: cherry kriek. The result is a comforting, warming, flavorful concoction. Reminds me a bit of Rare Vos from the cafe of the same name in Schepdaal, Belgium."
"In October 2005 I purchased a couple mixed cases of 750 ml bottles of each of Ommegang's four ""main"" beers when I camped overnight at the Waffles and Puppets event. Most of those beers have since been drunk or given as gifts, but of those that remain there are three specimens of the 2005 bottling of Three Philosophers ""Belgian Style Blend."" This bottle has sat quietly with its Ommegang brethren since then, and now seems like a good time for a review. The bottle was opened at cellar temperature. A careful pour into a Three Philosophers bulb yields a slightly murky burnt-orange glowing brew with a steady, densely-bubbled light brown head. Slightly boozy, almost medicinal aromas of prunes and cherry juice, along with brown sugar and faint canned-pineapple notes. Very noticeable cherry flavor rings the edges of the first sip, surrounding a caramel-drizzled spiced poundcake center. Spicy alcohol prickliness subsides toward the finish. Clean, fruity (plums, cherries) flavors in the aftertaste. Slightly tart, almost vinous, but mostly a caramel-fruit melange. Vaguely funky ""farmhouse"" yeasty esters in the burps. Moderate alcohol slickness, medium body. The year and change this has spent sitting tight in the cellar has brought the Lindemans Kriek out from the shadows -- or maybe I've just had a difficult time discerning it in the past. As of now, this is drinking fine, but I've got two left to try for the next couple of years, and it should be interesting to see what additional time will do to this beer."
"It's drinkable, but not something I'd do over an over. A decent beer to sip on for a while."
"Drinkability: good not great. This beer puts the palate through the wringer."
"Glad I had a chance to sample it. I might like to try this with a nice fruit tart or truffle some other time."
"Interesting blend of two completely different styles of Belgian beer."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is unmatched. This beer holds its own exceptionally well, but it would mix well with many desserts."
"Highly reccommended, this is one of my desert island beers."
"D: I think I like this beer more fresh opposed to aged. The cherry isn't as apparent but it does get more caramel personality. Regardless, delicious."
"So drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden; except for the buzz. One 750ml and I'm not driving a firetruck anywhere. Opened this now to celebrate being packed and ready for a cruise. Sailing tomorrow for Key West and points south."
"This is a really nice beer. The only thing that slows down drinkability is the alcohol percentage and the huge bottle!"
"I enjoyed the flavors and complexities of this beer a lot, however the lambic blending added a slightly disjoint set of flavors, that while good, would have been much better had they blended better."
"Aroma of sweet malt, coco bitterness, some spice and clove hints from the yeast and a tart cherry fruitiness. A firm, lasting, off white head tops the brown body interlaced with red highlights. Malty sweetness up front, followed by cherry cough syrup, and a hint of mustiness. Left a candy coating in my mouth. A interesting beer... would like to see more sourness and less sweetness though."
"Drinkability - As with most Belgian and Belgian-styles this bad boy is for sipping. Anyone who thinks they can drink several of these needs to drink cheaper beer for the buzz they are looking for! This is a well presented Quadrupel without suffering from the oft-times overbearing alcohol presence. One of my favorates in the style."
"This is a wonderful, unique brew. The mixture of barley malt and cherry lambic makes this one interesting and delicious. As the bottle states, this one is better to have when at room temperature or slightly chilled. It's a very nice occassional ""sipping"" brew."
"Let me finish with this thought: This beer reminds me of wine. A very dry chard with hops and barley. Not a barley wine, not that sweet. I would like to revisit this thought on another bottle."
"If you have access to this beer, it is a must try. This will be a regular in my beer rotation."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is hidden well and it's interesting and tasty. very enjoyable."
"Quite drinkable- refreshing, but just complicated enough to keep your interest."
"D - A very tasty quad indeed, but I just don't see where the cherries come in. Perhaps this is a good thing, however, since an overtly cherry smack in the face would be an affront to the style. A pleasure to drink, and satisfying nonetheless!"
"D - Surprisingly good considering how rich and alcoholic it is, largely thanks to the rather mellow flavor."
"Taste is immediately alcoholic with the sourish cherry flavour coming in just behind. This is a little more tart than I thought it would be, but I like it. The cherries give way to a mild chocolate sweetness, some fruitcake flavour. Figs, plums, blackberries all make an appearance, along with a hint of coriander. Mild yeastiness in here as well. There's a multitude of complexities to this beer, very impressive. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, and it leaves the palate a little sticky. Carbonation is medium and dances the flavours around the palate just enough. Drinkable is more like sippable as this is one hefty brew, and I could keep sipping this all night. Not more than two though!"
"Not my favorite Ommegang offering, but a very good brew nonetheless."
"Dark brown in color with mahogany highlights. The beer is topped by a thin, fizzy, tan colored head. The nose has lots of dark fruit, blackberries, plums, dark caramel toffee, dates, and the lightest hint of spice. There is a light citrus finish. The flavor really turns up the dark fruit. There must be some Belgian candy syrup in this beer. Tons and tons of blackberry, blackcherry, and dates. Light orange citrus bitterness comes across midway. The finish blends the sweet fruit, and the bitterness. There is just a mils alcohol hint on the finish. The mouth feel is just a touch thin. Overall, nice beer."
"You're not going to knock back this beer. It's too heavy, too alcoholic, and too Bretty. Savor it with a good meal and a lot of free time. I imagine this might actually be a good introduction to Belgian yeast (and even lambic), as the Brett and sourness are strong but balanced nicely by the quadrupel-style weight."
"It's kind of a ""stouty"" quad to me. It tastes pretty good but I don't think it's necesarilly a very good showing for the style. A good dinner beer."
"Bottom line: a brew I appreciate more than actually enjoy."
"Definitely an interesting combo and a good one at that. However, I prefer my quad's with out anything extra in it, but this still may be a repeat purchase."
"Notes--First introduced to the Ommegang line at a beer tasting in Buffalo, NY. Their beers are excellent Belgian styles--and you can't beat the price!"
"The only blended quad I've had and it was interesting to same the least. I poured a dark brown with a tinge of red. As it warms, the sour cherry smell really comes out. In general I found the lambic to dominate this beer, losing some of the more subtle flavors. There were still some good dark fruit flavors, but I'd prefer more focus on them. Only actual negative is that more the longest time the beer was overcarbonated to the point of making it hard to taste."
"Paired second glass with cherry pie without improvement."
"Id seen this beer on the shelf a long while and always been intrigued by the idea of a quad with blended cherry lambic. So I finally caved, and here it goes. Poured it into my chimay chalice, careful not to disturb the sediment. Nice off white tan head with good retention. The body is a dark coffee brown with deep reddish highlights. It smells of Belgian yeast, sweet and charred malt, mild hints of coffee and caramel with a little subtle, but pleasing natural funk of lambic. The taste is crisp and malty, some definite sweetness coupled with a mild yet well balance hint of hoppy bitterness and the cherry lambic funk is definitely there yet not over pouring in the least. If one dislikes lambics they need not worry this is not a 100 funk its more just the right amount for a great all round flavor. This beer is a really fun modified quad. Honestly the flavor of cherry lambic and charred malt, with caramel, coffee and chocolate notes makes for a great beer. Id definitely buy this again especially to show it to a friend."
"Was very happy to find this one almost locally. Will be a staple in my beer cupboard."
"Three Philosophers was an enjoyable beer experience."
"I need to revisit what Brewery Ommegang has to offer since I reviewed most of their regular offerings prior to knowing what the hell I was tasting. Still though, it's hard to believe that anything in their oeuvre can compare to Three Philosophers. This is a stunning creation that was a steal at only $5.99 per bottle. I'm seriously considering buying a case because I'm sure that this nectar will age like a dream. Highly recommended."
"This is a powerful and quite strong beer that is ultra complex. If you don't like full-flavored and robust beers, then steer clear of this one, because you will surely cower in fear at its awesome power. A must have for those who love lots of flavor and complexity!"
"On the sweetish side, but I think it was still too powerful of a brew for the wifey. Ill have another, thanks."
"Tall cap, big tan colored bubbles that fades to something moderate. Hazy chestnut color and ruby red when held to the light. Malty nose with notes of caramel and toasty malts. Extremely carbonated, phenolic, crisp alcohol presence, very dry bitterness and tart background. Cherries and cranberries make a distinct appearance. Medium body with a watery, carbonated mouth feel like soda pop. Charred oak and nutty flavors. Losses some of its carbonated quality towards the end. This was certainly a fairly complex beer but still fell short of expectation."
"Still very good, but not as good as my first bottle."
"Overall, it was an interesting beer. The bottle size allowed it to warm to room temperature, offering a variety of flavors and temperatures to take in. The hop presence was surprising, but not offensive. Excellent beer. I'm warm and happy."
"Quite good overall, as are all of the Ommegang products. I'll be curious to see how the other bottle turns out after a couple years in the cellar."
"Has a nice bubbly texture but then coats the mouth with some unwelcome astringency. That aside, its not nearly as heavy a brew as Id expected & thus, if its to your taste, makes for a pretty drinkable beverage."
"Solid, but not worthy of regular revisits."
"Overall, a terrific quadrupel and an outstanding value for your money."
"This was really good. Poured from the bomber to a reddish brown color with off-white head, that lingered and left very good lacing. Aroma was strongly cherry, with malty sweetness evident. Body was medium, and at first, highly carbonated. Taste was more of the cherry, mixed well with the traditional ale taste. As beer warmed, the alcohol became more evident in the nose and taste, but still well blended with the cherry ale. Excellent warming finish as the alcohol took hold, and a very smooth after-taste. I will look for more of this in the coming winter."
"This beer is full bodied and is easy to drink. I think that I'll definitely try this one again. I want to see if I have the same experience that I've had with this one. This beer goes down very well there's nothing wrong with it that would make it hard to drink, could almost drink this all night. However, I find the flavor of this beer to be more bland than other beers I've had; beers that I would rather drink all night. All in all its above average and I like it, but in the way of Quadrupel, I prefer Rochefort 10."
"Poured a very rich, dark brown with ruby hues to it. about a half-inch head that dissipated quickly into a tiny head that was formed just around the circumfrence of the galss, leaving behind very little lacing. Smells of ripe, dark fruits, cherries, figs, sweet, and some alcohol. Taste is also of very ripe dark fruits, figs, prunes, raisins, cherry flavors, very noticeable alcohol burn in the finish. This beer could mask the alcohol better but I guess with a beer like this, aging it would be a wise move to mellow it out. Mouthfeel is full and airy, silky, with a good amount of carbonation. I've had better quads but they are usually from Belgium. This Three Philosophers is probably the best quad coming from the USA, or at least from what I have had. Cheers."
"From what I can remember it smells and tastes similar to the Hennepin but stronger in flavor and alcohol. I smell fruits, maybe prunes, apples, some malt. Taste is the same with a finish of alcohol and some hops. Pretty drinkable. Another good brew from Ommegang."
"D: Even at 9.8%, this is a strong drinkable ale."
"Highly drinkable...if it were available in my area, I'd always have some on hand."
"2004... Poured a hazy brownish red color with a thin tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of tart cherry and caramel malts, spices, and light alcohol. Taste of pepper, caramel, some cocoa, cherries and some yeast as well. Reminds me of a candy apple."
"Between the thickness and the strength and complexity of flavor, this really is best enjoyed slowly, in small amounts, and without food; as much as I enjoyed it, I could only have one small glass in an evening. But I'll happily have that one glass any opportunity I get."
"Looks like a nice, dark red wine with some brown tints. Head fades fast, in its place comes some consistent and evenly placed streams of carbonation. Smells sour and malty, with cherry and caramel aromas. A delicious clean taste up front, very sweet and wine-like, cherries, grapes, bitter greens. Nice alcohol warmth follows. The carbonation is well integrated. Some slightly roasted, smoky flavors as well, predominantly in the aftertaste. Slightly dry all in all, but this trait is presented well. Goes straight to my head; drink slowly. Mmm"
"This tastes a bit more alcoholic than it is, and that hampers drinkabliity a little bit, but it's well worth it otherwise."
"Pours a very deep and dark plumish amber color, with a medium sized light brown head, that doesn't seem to leave much lacing. Smells of sweet malts, chocolate, and cherries, a very pleasant smell that begs to be drank. A waterfall of flavors hits the palette upon first taste. I first get plenty of chocolate flavor, some malty flavors, then sugar cane, followed by the slightly sour cherry lambic flavor to finish it off. Leaves a very pleasant aftertaste. Quite enjoyed this one, however, it is about 2 years old, I wonder how it tasted upon fresh brewing."
"Ommegang beers: First past the post."
"Overall, I would say for the price, and the quality of Three Philosophers, this is a HIGHLY drinkable quad. Definately going to be putting it into my regular rotation."
"I will definitely have this beer again. My girfriend even liked it."
"Now to the food. This might not work so well with most entrees, but there are few better dessert beers around, IMO. With a dark chocolate cake, a cherry cheesecake, or other rich dessert this beer shines. But to my surprise, it goes nicely with lighter desserts too. For this tasting, I had it with a fresh raspberry and blueberry tart with B&J's vanilla ice cream and some excellent chocolate cookies. Absolutely perfect - the cherries and the sourness meld with the berries and the richness matches up well with the ice cream. Try this beer with dessert and you won't be disappointed."
"It was very good for the length of the bottle, but I wondered if it would be better in colder weather."
"M&D - kind of strong, but easy down, the girls thought it was a bit strong, but i enjoyed it, a little too thick, but very tasty, i prefer the cherries in NGWBR, but MUCH better the SA Cherry Wheat"
"I fixed up a yeoman's feast while Trüb strained to open the vintage Three Philosophers with his mustachio heavily persperating into the glory hole of nectar. Afterall, one should never bloody his apron with the tumescence of ghoulish beers while his dick-butler(euphemism for personal home-plebe) lurks near! Well, this wasn't as ghastly as it was NOT BEER. It was undercarbonated BAMPAGNE. A gassy little beer in a big time bottle. It uncorked, it bit and it sang like bubbly. Not even the dancing porkchops could make it beer. The peppers of yellow, red and green cajoled it to be but it could not. I even asked it politely to salutate with a ham-fisted beer 'ello but it said no sir. Get your violin and bree cheese out because the French waiter and weird sounding police cars are going to buzz by your summertime window with this one. Rap tap table tap."
"Delicious, and balanced. The taste lives up to the nose. This is really good."
"Deep amber red color with a foamy tan head. Nice retention on the head. First sniff is full or dark fruits, cherries and plums. Followed by a sweet maltyness. The smooth mouthfeel is the first impression when you taste this one. The flavors are rich and powerful but somehow hidden by the smoothness of this beer. Nice maltyness and mild cherry flavor show themselves. The high ABV is amazingly well hidden. Another winner from Ommegang."
"D-Good drink for a cold day, a definite sipping brew"
"This beer has great flavor, but don't try to rush this. I was on the fence on whether to give taste a 5, but I figured I don't have enough quad experience to do so."
"The beer poured a deep hazy amber color with a thick tan head that disapated rather quickly and left behind a solid ring around the edge of the glass and some floating islands in the middle. The beer has a very distinct aroma of cloves, yeast, cherries and maybe some other dried fruits. Sweet and malty and hard to put down. The taste is a bit tart but balances out well with the cherry taste, malty sweetness and then rounds out with an alcohol kick on the back end which is pleasing to the palate. Based on the high abv, this is a bigger beer to drink but being very smooth is is fairly easy to drink as well."
"Good drinkability for the style. It's not often I drink a whole bottle of this"
"Drinkability: A great offering from the folks at Ommegang. Had the opportunity to drink this on-tap a few times at Zeno's in State College, PA, and enjoyed just as much now as I did then. Drinkable, well-balanced example of the style. Not as much of the fruit burst on the front palate as I expected, but the cherries on the middle palate provide an interesting and welcome twist. I'll definitely be buying this again in the not-too-distant future."
"This was really good, and would be worth keeping a few bombers around... that's what I""ll be looking for next time."
"Hard to pin down, but easy to love. Definitely on the sweet side, but you almost don't realize it because the flavors have so much depth. There are many sides to this one. Utterly enjoyable, a fantastic piece of work. Easily one of the best non-Belgian Belgians that I've had. This tends to be said a lot about Ommegang, and with good reason."
"D - Very drinkable...The high alcohol content may make it a bit less drinkable when sitting down for a session (or atleast I would hope so). Very very tasty and I plan to buy another and enjoy it thoroughly."
"750ml bottle. Pours out a rich brown color with a hint of red when held to the light. Nice creamy head that falls fairly quickly and leaves nice lacing. The smell is malty sweet with dark fruits. Some of the alcohol can be noticed in the nose also. Very complex taste. Slightly medicinal, very malty. Dark cherry flavors too. The alcohol is slightly noticeable in the finish. Hops a just barely in the mix but balance everything out nicely. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and creamy but does not have any stickiness to it. I love this beer. This is a great after dinner sipper."
"A very drinkable beer. Complex, rich. Not to be missed."
"This beer is similiar to regular ommegang, but there is definitely a stronger cherry taste. Very nice and highly reccomended."
"Easily drinkable and enjoyable, ommegang only seems to make winners."
"Drinks pretty good, I think this is one to lay down for years. Worth it ($9.00 a bottle)"
"Otherwise, there are plenty of other beers to explore if you're not into something as meaty as a quarupel. This isn't a proper introduction."
"Very drinkable this beer is very rich and full of flavor, I think that this beer would both be an excellent pairing with rich foods as well as a great beer to cook with."
"a modern classic of blending A+"
"The least head I've ever seen on any belgian-style beer, but a beautiful dark, mahogany colored brew. Smells tight and pointedly fruity--kind of a flat and musty fruit. It's actual taste is not as fruity as I expected, especially since I still cringe at the thought of sickly-sweet lambic style, and I figured it would be a moderated version of that. Really, it's more of a sour, compromised version of a fairly good belgian ale. It's pretty good and definitely worth trying and enjoying, but it wouldn't be a priority for my personal future purchasing schedule. It's very different and interesting, and the 9.8% in this bomber is going to knock me out for the night. Judged for style against other belgians/quadrupels."
"Just a completely enjoyable complex brew."
"Three Philosophers Belgian Style Blend (Quadrupel) pours a dark brown with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I can smell some cherry in the aroma. The taste has a little bit of cherry in it, malt is also noticeable. There are some medicinal type flavors as well. This is an interesting beer, it's definitely pretty good, but not particularly to my liking. Your mileage may vary."
" June 12, 2006"
"Beer pours a deep brown, bordering black, with ruby tinges around the edge of the glass. The head is a tad on the small side, but other than that, this is a good looking beer. Smell is like a quad, but a bit more sour. Ripe fruits with a tart bite. Taste is much like the smell. The beer starts out with a fruity sweetness, but toward the end of the drink, transitions smoothly into a sour note (in a good way). Mouthfeel is good. Full bodied, but a little alcoholic. Drinkablity is pretty good too. Nice beer."
"Drinkability: you might have to call the paramedics if i got my hands on a case"
"An interesting pour, characteristic of Ommegang. Cloudy apple cider amber color with some copper red present too. A relatively small amount of tan head that nonetheless sticks around for a while and clings pretty well. Nose improved noticeably as this one warmed, with sweet but complex malts (reminding me of Scotch ales) tinged with sour cherry, spices, and a bit of alcohol. The taste too improved as the beer (and I) warmed. That malty-cherry-spicy blend faded nicely into a slightly warm and nicely lingering finish. The mouthfeel is intriguingly soft and full with a lasting crispness. While I will stick with some of Ommegang's other offerings, this one is worth another go. I look forward to pairing it with some appropriate chow."
"Overall: An interesting take on the quadrupelthey claim to mix with a cherry lambic, and it shows, yielding a bittersweet, nearly syrupy concoction much better sipped than gulped, especially at 9.8% ABV. Not my favorite quadrupel, but worth a try."
"Edit, Nov 2 1010: My first bottle since my review, a 12ozer. As deliciously cherry tarty and with the same caramel sweetness as the 750ML bottles. It lost nothing going down from the large format bottle at all. A real treat to drink!"
"Pours an amber cloudy brown with good head and minimal lacing. Smells of dried fruits, dates, caramel and fig notes as well a strong hop presence. Tastes like much of the same. Mouthfeel is somewhat bitter but smooth overall. Drinkability is limited by high AC but this is sweet enough to power over the stong alcohol taste."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle. This beer had a brownish amber appearance with a huge light tan head that lingered in the glass. Aroma was malty and caramelly with hints of fruit in the nose. Taste was a wonderful mix of sweet malts, dark fruit, cherries, chocolate and alcohol. I could taste a little bit of sour wineyness in the finish. This is a very rich and warming brew that is very easy to drink despite the heavy body. I polished off the entire bottle in about an hour and enjoyed every drop of it. An excellent beer for the money($5.99)."
"This should be enjoyed sparsly with friends and would be fantastic at the end of a good meal."
"An absolute pleasure to enjoy on it's own. Swirl it around in your glass a bit, it will bring out some really amazing scents"
"Overall though just a great brew and the fact I can pick up a 750 and local quicky mart for $6 just makes it even better."
"This might be a little too big, flavor-wise, to drink too much of, but a really great interpretation of the style."
"Drinkablity - this goes down very easy, and is delicious! High abv limits it to one 750ml ( or two 12 oz.'ers ) per sitting. I was going to ding it a half point on this trait, but I just can't - it gets the full 5 -just excersize due diligence and repsonsilblity, you'll be wasted in no time flat after two 750's without seeing it coming because this excellent ale completely hides, and I mean completely hides, the potency of its high abv."
"note: Sometime early in the winter of 2006-2007, probably around November, I had a 2003 bottle sent to me by goodbyeohio in ""These go to eleven...a bif," and it was absolutely awesome."
"Verdict: I can't hate anything from Ommegang. I enjoyed this beer, but it didn't fully come together for me. The alcohol isn't as well hidden as it is in other quads, and I didn't think that the lighter fruit flavors were an ideal match for the rich caramel flavor of the malt. A good beer, but not my favorite Ommegang offering."
"This was a very strong and intense beer. I didn't really like it just for that reason. Overall it was just to hopy for me. It did have a nice color and feel, however. On another note, I am looking for someone to tell me what book(s) or place will teach me more about what I need to know in order to appreciate beer."
"This is my first time having this beer and it is immediately among my favorites."
"I guess I'm not the only voice of dissent on this one. I have a hard time getting through a glass of this since I find the blend not very interesting. I'd be more interested in the straight beer from Ommegang."
"I think this is a love it or hate it brew. I like many of Ommegang's products but this one will not be on my buy list."
"Poured a color I can only describe as auburn. Not much head to speak of but what there is, is colored off white. Nose is full of buttery cherries. Taste is a bit of butterscotch followed by mellow cherry. There's very little tartness. Some about the flavor doesn't gel though. Something seems missing. It isn't bad but I don't find it very pleasing for some reason. Mouth is luscious, thick and creamy. Drinkability is so-so. Its good, but not something I feel the need to follow with another glass. Something tells me that this might be more pleasing with an older bottle. I'll buy one and re-review an older sample."
"Notes: This is absolutely a big beer, and not something I'd want to drink too much of. I don't see myself buying this often, but I think it would make a nice ""special occasion"" beer, or a nice subsititute for red wine."
"Overall-yikes, massive beer with lots of flavor but loads of alcohol kick as well, still definitely worth trying, I'd be interested to see what it would have tasted like on its own without the cherry lambic added, but still this is an interesting combonation brew and definitely worth trying. Ommegang really has their shit together."
"I'm glad I finally picked this up and I will definitely get it again."
"Another very well crafted belgian-style from Ommegang. So rich and substantial...a truly awesome beer."
"Drinkability: Excellent flavor, but quite alcoholic. I'll have no problem finishing the bottle but that will probably be it for me."
"The Ommegang beers were among the first I drank when I began to explore the world of craft beer. I'm finally getting around to reviewing this. It pours a beautiful clear reddish amber with an offwhite head. It looks to be very carbonated. I can smell the Belgian yeast quality along with raisins and cherries. It seems like a very complex beer...and wow, it is. It's a creamy, full bodied beer with a great spicy quality and a caramel sweetness. It's pretty drinkable considering the ABV and complexity. I will be sure to savor this."
"A good fireside sipper, but don't let that stop you from drinking it year round."
"Taste and Mouthfeel- Strong banana and other fruity flavors again. Alcohol is perceptable but plays a background role. Malt is quite prevalent. Smooth mouthfeel with some light tingling sensations. Definitely a sipping brew. A good treat every now in then when looking for something strong."
"D - A ton of complexity here, makes you want to sip and analyze. Only complaint is I;m picking up a tiny metallic tinge that I;ve noticed in all Ommegang brews, however here it's masked and/or blended with so many other flavors that it's opk with me."
"Overall impression: A sipper that should be enjoyed. Amazing complexity. The alcohol was a little too prominent and took away some of the enjoyment for me. Nicely done. A good choice for my 400th formal BA review."
"Dark ruby color that glows in the light, fairly hazy. Thin head disappears rapidly into a frothy ring. The aroma has light notes of fruity sweet malt, perhaps raspberry or cherry, with a slight nuttiness. The is initially cinnamon sweet malt, becoming more fruity with winey and cherry notes. The finish is fairly unremarkable, with the strong alcohol showing itself a bit. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but nice and bubbly. Decent drinkability, needs more finish to round it out, also a bit alcoholic..."
"Thick, creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Plenty of dark malt flavor, with some herbal and medicinal notes and just a little bit of hop bitterness. Some warming alcohol on the finish."
"I want to be fair so I'm going to get another and try it. I want to overcome my aversion of cherry, but it's unlikely that I would ever drink this regularly. Because of the cherry, perhaps I'd open one at a celebration, a party with good friends or something. If you like Cherry dig in. If you don't like Cherry avoid. Finally I'm told the pleasant flavor and I enjoy at the beginning and the unpleasant cherry that finishes the brew 'merge' if this is aged. I am definetly going to age a bottle to find out and see if this improves over time. I'm also going to review this beer to make sure I've been fair to it."
"A wonderful rich body, glowing with caramel and vanilla flavors. Topped of by a very thick head. Almost like a soda float of some type. Alcohol everywhere in this one, listed @ 9.8, but hits like a 14+. A little hard to get through the bottle. Ended up with quite a hangover from not consuming that much."
"I was hesitant to try this with cherry-lambic added, but overall found it refreshing. This is another beer I'll revisit in a few years after it has aged."
"Smooth and hugely carbonated -- belch inducingly so. A unique and complex offering from Ommegang. And a great deal for $6.99 a bottle."
"not bad, but I espected more"
"D - Very drinkable. Would recommend and buy again."
"Mouthfeel is great with the full body and superb carbonation that this true to style ale is loaded with. It's the kind of beer that you must drink slowly to appriciate it's abundant qualities (and it's potency) yet the taste keeps you wanting more. Damn good stuff...Cheers !"
"750 ml bottle Pours a cloudy dark amber brown with a good fizzy light brown head. Very good lacing on the glass, head diminshed in average time. Aroma is of carmel and cherries. Taste has good carbonation. The sweetness blended nicely. It doesnt overpower the beer. Has an astringent aftertaste, but a short finish. Has a sherry wine like flavor. The correct glass will help you appriciate this one. I got it in a gift pack that came with it."
" Dark and rich taste that hides the alcohol as well as it can, but 9.8% cannot be completely hidden, methinks. This beer compares favorably with most other dark Belgians I've tried. I taste the lambic and think it mellows the taste but the malt and the depth of texture is what defines this brew for me. If you like Belgian style beer, you'll almost indubitably enjoy this offering from Ommegang."
"very smooth and light with high carbonation. sour and earthy with bitter cherries, a touch of plummy caramel sweetness and a dry alcoholic finish. complex and subtle; a nice quiet beer to sip and enjoy. this one would definitely age well."
"Pours a slighty cloudy brown with about half a finger of fizzy brown head that quickly fades. Smell is sweet, brown sugar mainly, with some yeastiness and a hint of cherry. The yeastiness is sharp in the flavor with some roasted nuts and a slightly sweet aftertaste. The cherry flavor increases as it warms. The mouthfeel is a little sticky with lots of carbonation. This is a pretty good beer to relax with, very enjoyable."
"I remember, several months ago, being afraid to try this because I didn't know what the heck 'cherry lambic' was, and I thought 'fruit beers' were some kind of evil hybrid style that should be denounced at all costs. Simply stated, how wrong I was."
"Dark ruby brown with a light brown head. Great lacing. The aroma is slighty fruity and alcoholic. Some hints of licorice. The taste is full of dark malty flavors. Kind of sweet and sour from the cherry lambic blended in the ale. Has a herbal bitterness as well. The finish is slighty dry with a touch alcoholic sweetness. The smooth full body makes for easy drinking. To sum it up, a great sippin beer full of flavor."
"A wonderful beer. It went over big on Valentine's Day. It poured a dark brown/black with a thick coffee-colored head. Some nice lacing. It had a sweet caramel odor with some fruit in the background. . It had a coffee/chocolate/dried fruit taste, with a lingering of the coffee. Very warm and complex in the mouth, lots of fun to drink."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Poured into my Duvel goblet. Murky chestnut brown with some ruby highlights with a nice 2 finger head, OK longevity but very nice lace. Smell of big caramel, brown sugar, candy and dried dark fruit. Slight coffe aromas as well. Coffee like taste mixed with some chocolate and dried dark fruit, no roastyness though. Caramrl and dark brown sugar tastes. Rich creamy and sticky. Alcohol is present in the aftertaste which also contains a fair amount of bitterness. Definately one to sip. Very complex. A nice brew."
"Drinkable. Not entirely impressed but I will give it another chance in the future."
"had to try it on tap as presented... but I won't be searching this out again. It wasn't great in bottles (the idea is) and it wasn't great on tap... it was worth trying, but there were better offerings on tap."
"Pretty drinkable, but my least favorite Ommegang to date."
"Cheers!"
"Reddish brown in color with very nice head and loads of lacing. Medium alcohol smell with dark fruit smell (kinda raisiny). Great smell for a quad. HUGE taste. Very sweet with distinct graininess. Strong alcohol flavor without the burning. I'm not sure why that is. Slight toffee flavor. Ridiculously smooth mouthfeel. This brew is great. A bit dry on the palate. Still lots of dark fruits in the finish. This is a great brew. I can't wait for the bottle in the cellar to get some age on it. Grab a bottle of this or I'll hunt you down. Not seriously but you need to try it."
"D: Three Philosophers did not come across as well-balanced or providing much in terms of depth or subtle flavors/smells. The malt power is just ""on part"" for the style. Given its high alcohol content without much reward in terms of other aspects, this one doesn't strike me as much to rave about. Perhaps 2004 was a bad year..."
"Buy a few bottles, drink some, and cellar some for later."
"Found a 4-pack of this locally at a wine store!! Pours a nice brown/reddish color, smell is of plums. Tastes to me a bit plummy and other fruits but not too fruity. Finishes really nice. It's a bit sweeter than expected but it's not bad at all since I don't like real sweet beers. Definetly recommended!!"
"A very interesting beer that is a belgian style quadrupple ale blended with Lindemans cherry lambic. Overall, a fantastic and unique brew. I could drink them all night."
"pours orange caramel in colour with a surprisingly less than ""luxurious"" head. no date is visible on this twelve ounce bottle. the beer is hazy and some random yeast clumps made their way into my glass despite a careful pour. the nose is full of funked cherry that foretells of a tartness to come in the flavour. mild alcohol vapours and a scant amount of yeasty tones, most likely obscured by the rather brash cherry aroma, are notable as well. the wild appeal is quite grand. the flavour, like the nose, is dominated by the Lambic's bold character. a sturdy malt texture serves as my sole insight to the level of malt burried within the fruity tartness. a fading malt aftertaste lingers in the finish and manages to outshine the cherry for a fleeting moment. this brew is not just a cherry flavoured beer. it has some degree of complexity with its dank earthy aspects. if one can find appreciation for musty, aging, fruit tones coupled with some rich malt character look no further. if nothing else, this is interesting to taste."
"D: This is one of my favorite beer from Ommegang to date. It has an obvious Belgian character with a uniquely American twist. Very enjoyable and highly reccommended."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is smooth and light. Cherries are noticeable, but not overpowering. High abv can be noticed when the first drop hits your tongue. Not a session beer, but a damn fine one. Brewery Ommegang continues to make stars."
"This is great stuff, unique flavor, great aromas, big mouthfeel, a great sipping brew given the abv. I really like to sit down and savor a three philosophers a couple times a year. The cherry undertones from the kriek add a great layer of flavor to this quad, its a really unique offering."
"Pours a cherrywood color with a decent enough head that dissapears to almost nothing, not what i'd expect of a quadrupel. Smells of cherry and alcohol. Taste is initially candy cherry, cough drop cherry without so much menthol. Medicinal. To be fair, this fades a bit and there are other flavors underneath, but this overwhelms them, sadly. Any subtleties are masked, and it's pretty much cherry alcohol riding through to the finish. Phenolic, fusels even? Mouthfeel is quite nice though, full, with nice carbonation. Not very drinkable at all. Slow sipping is tolerable, but why would I want to? Interesting idea, quadrupel+lambic but in the end not so good. I've had this brew a few times, didn't like it before and thought maybe i'd age it a bit to see if it improved, and it did, but only so far as to mute everything and make it less offensive. Ah well, can't like em all."
"Very interesting flavor. Great bargain for the price. I don't think I could drink a lot of these in a row, but one or two at time was good."
"This beer pour a beautiful looking cherry color with a centimeter of tan creamy dry looking head that left some droopy strands of lace. Smelled of cherries, cranberries, alcohol and a slight smoky dry yeast. Tasted strongly of red wine with an intense dry yeast and a subtle strawberry and cherry sweetness. Alcohol became very noticeable on the exhale. Good blend of flavors here. Mouth feel was light with lots of carbonation against my palate. A very dry and bubbly beer."
"Pours a drak reddish brown with bits of yeast floating around. The aroma about knocked me out with the initial alcohol scent. As the alcohol scent fades and the aromas of cherries and sweet malts is notable. The alcohol is the first thing that hits you when you take that first drink. Quickly following the alcohol there is a notable cherry flavor but not as strong as I thought it would be. This has got to be one of my favorite brews of all time, I have got to find this brew again."
"Overall - I loved it. An inspired brew that has a great flavor and a nice balance. I Cracked it for PSU/FSU. Go Lions!"
"I really like this ale, but don't think I could drink more than a glass... well maybe if you twisted my arm."
"This Quad has a deep amber red color with a ½ inch light brown head of thick carbonization in my chalice-style glass. The smell is of aromatic fermented fruit with light cherry overtones. The taste is smooth with a bit of ethereal warming qualities. The flavor is a woody and cherry experience with a hint of caramel. The mouth feel is full and slightly fizzy with that ethereal feel after the swallow. This beer was one of my early Belgium favorites."
"the mouthfeel is very thick almost surypy"
"I'd try it again but am in no real hurry to do so. I'm going to try the Rare Vos next ..."
"Notes: I am putting a couple in the cellar fridge. Winner."
"Overall, fairly drinkable for the style and alcohol content. If you grab one of these guys, give it some time to age- I have a feeling that's all it needs to really stand up with it's Ommegang siblings."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied and well carbonated. The sweetness is in balance with the spicy contrast. Alcohol is well masked."
"Drinkability: Its pretty drinkable for how much alcohol is in it. Though I couldn't drink alot, I would not shy away from it if it was offered. A decent North American replication of a Belgian style."
"Notes: Definitely a surprise considering its comparing itself to a lambic. A little bland I must admit. Fine beer otherwise."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown with a large, light tan, foamy, thick head with very good retention. Some light lacing all the way down. The smell is a marvelous blend of caramel malt, Belgian yeast, cherry, herbs, alcohol and fruit esters, and light bubble gum. The taste is sweet, with huge malts, prune, cassis, tobacco and a late sting of fruit. The finish is long, warming and sweet. It has a medium body, and the silky texture and effervescent carbonation give this a spectacular mouthfeel. This is one outstanding Belgian! A must try."
"Drinkability: A very balanced and quality brew. Ommegang has never disappointed me. And, let's face it, for about $7 a bottle this is beyond a steal. Certainly pick one up. I can't wait to cellar some of these."
"This is a fine example of a quadrupel and is a great beer to sit and sip."
"Pours an opaque, murky-looking black with a brown colored head that stays put and leaves behind intricate lacing. Aromas of alcohol, grapes, and leather are apparent, but the alcohol definitely dominates. The taste is a bit more 'porter' or 'imperial stout' like than is typical for this style. An interesting combination of fruit, candy sugar, and drying bitterness. In my mouth, this beer feels like liquid leather in that it is overly viscous and sticky. It felt like I was drinking something I shouldn't be; motor oil, discharged broth from a fermentation tank, etc. But that is the beauty of this beer, it combines two styles so well that is absolutely unique. I enjoyed the taste of this beer very much and was interested in more even with the high ABV."
"This is pretty damned easy to drink at 9%. The flavor is great and should be savored. But I will definitely go back for more of this on occasion."
"Pours a rich, ruby red/brown with no head to speak of. Smells like deep chocolate...but not that horrible, fake, burnt smell. It's much more subtle. I think it's the presence of a milky-ness. There's a pleasant subtle grainy taste (along with the smooth chocolate), and a pleasant hoppy bite. A delicious beer!!!"
"3P's pours with a moderately chunky head, settling to a sturdy 1/8"" chunky slick with staying power. Color of slightly less than opaque cola with visible carbonation and generous sediment suspended throughout the glass. This I have no issue with. Agitation aerates the surface resulting in good creamy foam on top and coats the glass nicely. The Nose offers some chocolate, Belgian yeast and cardamom. The spicy notes are held in slight abatement giving this brew a classy character rather than being totally off the wall flamboyant. The flavor is rich and buttery, malty and reminiscent of lightly roasted hazelnut. The flavors linger for a minute + with essence of sticky molasses, ground cherry, (aka Physalis pruinosa) and lightly roasted nuts and a pleasant saltiness on the lips. Creamy and expansive in the mouth, this is another fine product from Ommegang. Finishes just short of dry with drinkability being surprisingly great. Very well done!!"
"This is one of my favorite brews of all time. I would drink it every day if I could afford to and if it was available locally. If you like the darker Belgians, you owe it to yourself to hit this up."
"Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of subtle sour cherries with big strong malt. No hint of yeast, which is little surprising for a Belgian style ale. Taste is sweeter then expected with a strong malt body and a hint of kriek lambic at the end. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. I would appreciate a bit more complexity but this is still a very enjoyable beer."
"The lacing was phenomenal, and the head took minutes to dissapate. When it finally died down, the aroma was of dark fruits, perhaps sour cherry, malts, yeasts and subtle hops. The taste was certaily Belgian, with extremely complex flavors, a lot of alcohol (yet not overpowering) and yeasts. the feel was somwaht carbonated as it pased the tongue, and slightly acidic and puckering, but overall very pleasant. I recommend this one ot anyone and everyone."
"Notes: I paired mine with some havarty and sesame things, which was a decadent treat. I salute the Bros for those selections on the Three Philosophers page, dead on."
"D-Very interesting to say the least. I have not come across anything like this before and I think the concept is very unique. This can be interpreted either way, but for me, I will probably go for others over this. Probably my least favorite from Ommegang, but that is still better than most."
"Very much worth putting one in the cellar."
"Pours out a dark brown to black with tawny/ruby edges. Nice velvety head with retention that lasts forever. Smells fruity and grassy. A little like cherries. But just a little to sour for my smell. Tastes remarkable. Charred malts, like coffee, chocolate, and pie cherries. Quite good. Could be stronger in my opinion though. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, medium to full body. Very drinkable. Complex. Light, no huge alcohol flavor. Can drink this very well...even if I shouldn't."
"Pours with a decent head and a dark amber color with a hint of cherry red. The smell is very nice, sweet with very strong cherry overtones. The cherry flavor is not quite as strong in the flavor although it is certainly front and center. There also hints of caramel and an aftertaste of bitterness that makes it interesting. A very nice begianish style beer that is a treat on a friday night after a long week."
"Shared a 25 oz bottle at Zeno's. Pours a deep red with a nice head which leaves some very good lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and cherries. Taste is sweet and tart with lots of cherry flavor with much complexity hidden underneath. Also a bit of alcohol is detectable in the finish. Mouthfeel is very full and thick. This stuff is pretty drinkable. Almost like a fine wine (but better)- would be fantastic with a big homemade dinner or around the holidays. Very good beer."
"I enjoyed this very much. Brewery Ommegang delivers high quality at reasonable prices. They might be the biggest bargain in craft beer."
"D- A very nice warming brew. I've had this one before in a smaller bottle, but this is the first time I've had a chance to review it. Recommend!"
"Pretty intense drink. As Jason noted it really calls for something to be eaten with it. I think I tried a piece of cheese and/or dark chocolate."
"A dark reddish color with a one finger head make this offering from Ommegang a very good looking beer.A real malty fruit smell,cherry,apple,and maybe pear.This is very earthy.This tastes very much like the smell.Full of fruit and malt this also has a warm alcohol finish.A medium m/f,this isn't too sugary or thick.This is very drinkable a I would love to have another one or two."
"Next day note: Upon finishing this thing I was pretty well down for the night. Quite a lot of alcohol, it would seem."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle brewed in 2005 pours a bright hazy reddish brown with a nice creamy light brown head that leave nice sheets of lace in my glass. Aroma of baked apple, plums and raisins. Chocolate, cherry and caramel flavors, full bodied with a creamy soft mouthfeel, finishes sweet and sour."
"This is a damn tasty brew, somewhat diminished by the solvent-like quality of the finish. At 9.8%, it'll knock your dick in the dirt, but it would be worth it. A very fine beer, well designed and well made. If you look up the style profile, it is right on."
"This is a pretty potent beer. I had it poured into a glass. It was a dark color with hints of red. It had a fruity smell. The taste reminded me of wine. I don't think I could drink this every day but I may try it again in the future. This is a fairly complex beer."
"This is one of the first High Gravity beers I bought in NC since they popped the cap. So much better than the Chimay I purchased a few weeks back. I was disappointed with the Lindeman's Kriek by itself, but mixed in works for this Quadrupel is great, both for the taste and overwhelming smell. Great combination of cherries, caramel, and malts with one of the best mouthfeel sensations out there. A touch of alcohol in the aftertaste but nothing to back away."
"Drinkability: I don't know. I'm inclined to want to score this low, but I wonder whether the sourness of lambic and the sweetness of the malt are incompatible."
"Pours a slightly hazed amber mahogany hue with the yeast pour. A creamy tan head rises above three fingers, then very slowly turns to sticky lace. Burnt chocolate malt and dark fruit aromas, followed by a light floral hops in the back. A toasty malt-driven palate; baker's chocolate upfront, with phenolic date and raisin tartness pulling through that balances the noble hop bitterness. Rich flavor cloaks the high alcohol, and mild german hops in the aftertaste dry the mouthfeel leaving a semi-residual finish. tasted very-well attentuated and rich with complexity. Fine, medium carbonation and a thick, chewy body enhance the mouthfeel. This pairs exceptionally well with chocolate-covered cherries, especially when aged for a few years. Slight alcohol warmth and pleasent inebriation, an outstanding quadrupel."
"Ive been cellaring this for some time. Pours a deep mahogany color with a very tall tan head that has a strong retention but ever so slowly fades into thick rings of lace. Nose is rather complex with aromas of sweet fruity malts, a black cherry tartness, a touch of lambic sourness, and rummy alcohol in the background. Fairly full-bodied and rather creamy in texture. Taste begins with sweet plumy fruit and candied sugar (with just a hint of vanilla) followed by bready yeasts and a bit of liquorish. Some herbal notes follow as well as warming alcohol with a touch of rum-soaked raisins. Quite smooth despite the level of alcohol. Very niceyou could certainly do some wonderful cheese pairings with this brew. Thanks to Carmen for the sample!"
"Overall impression: Nice belgian style ale with some added complexity from the kriek. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Let this one warm to room temp before drinking. The flavors come out so much better. Haven't really had a beer that taste like this one before. This one would go great with a dessert with fruit. Will have again in the future."
"Deep dark burgundy in color. Little head & lacing. Kind of a spicy caramel oder with a slight wiff of alcohol. Taste is strong and complex. Spicy and Fruity. A bit too strong and complex for me, but some may love this. For such a strong taste mouthfeel is thin, but well carbonated. This beer really sneaks up on you. I like that. Certainly not a beer I would buy everyday, but maybe one purchasing for that special occasion or to age in the cellar."
"Notes: OK, actually very good for the price (<$5.00 for 750mL). Probably will buy again."
"I'm not typically a fan of this style, but this was a treat--certainly a well made Belgian style ale."
"One question: Does anyone know what percentage of this ale is Kriek?"
"Pours a nice deep red color accompanied by a nice long lasting head. Nose is heavy of cherry, reminds me of a cherry based dessert. First taste was a blast of alcohol but that has blended into a predominately cherry malt flavor with subsequent sips. Mouthfeel is nice and full and well carbonated. Overall drinkability is OK but the high abv and the cherry is a bit much."
"I would recommend you pick one up next time you get the chance."
"12 oz bottle. Poured into a tulip, dark brown with some hints of red, large two fingers of cofee-colored head. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells a lot like cherry cough syrup, more alcohol and a little more natural kind of cherry, but still similar. Some other sweet notes of candi sugar, prunes, and figs, and a hint of spices. Taste is more of the same sweetness, with all the fruitiness coming in again, especially the cherry, over a sort of caramelly malt base. Some cinammon spiciness comes into play towards the end. Alcohol is noticeable from the first sip, but it blends in pretty well with the flavors, and doesn't ever get to the point where it takes away from the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a smooth somewhat slick coating feel. Overall this is another good beer from Ommegang, a good example of the style, but a little too strong and in your face to drink more than 1 or 2."
"This really tastes like alcohol soaked fruit cake.Very sweet initially from the cherry lambic, slightly woody with a bit of tartness on the finish. The alcohol is warming, but is kind of heavy in the mouth. It's not necessarily a horrible thing, but a bit much. It really is kind of medicinal. This is my 2nd try, and better than I remembered it to be. I really don't know if I'll be buying more anytime soon, but it's worth a try none the less...especially if you like cherry flavor. I couldn't have more than one in a sitting."
"This is the second time I've had this beer, and I'm not sure I'm much of a fan of it. First of all, I am no fan of most cherry-flavored things, and this reminds me too much of the negative aspects of a lot of those things. I'm also not a fan of sweetened lambics. I think I'd like it better if it had a chance to mellow out some, maybe for a year or two."
"**EDIT** thought my review would be at the top of the heap when sorted by score.. it's #21. another true testament to the quality of this beer."
"A unique brew in the Quadrupel style. Poured out to a dark and cloudy red, with a large cream colored white foamy head. Good lacing was noted around the glass. Aromas of cherry, roasted elements, and some brown sugar was noted. Taste was heavy and filling, with complex flavors abound. Flavors of cherry, dark chocolate, some weak malt, and a hint of sour tartness on the finish. The higher alcohol level is well masked, but still present. Very heavy mouthfeel, like having cherry extract moshing around in your mouth. I'm not sure if I would have this again, it was like having fermented cherry juice. Not many of the a-typical quadrupel characteristics were here. I really don't know if i'm going to finish this..."
"Pours a murky, sludgy mahogany brown with a frothy tan head that the alcohol quickly erases. Smell has layers ans layers of complexity, as does the flavor. Standard Belgian dark fruits - plums, dates, figs, a funky/sour cherry kick along with some vinuous notes, strong malts, strong alcohol, and some faint chocolate/toffee. This is some heady stuff. Almost too complex. So many flavors and so much alcohol make this a seriously big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and bubbly. I enjoyed this quite a bit, but still had a hard time finishing the 750. Could use some refinement, a little time to mellow out perhaps. This was the 2004 vintage. My first Quad, and not a bad one to start me off."
"Excellent flavor. Alcohol and malt up front followed by a small rush of cherries and finished with tiny hops. A smooth beer, easy on the palate. Sugary. Syrupy. Terrific."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy, but actually on the thin side. Drinkability is still a problem for me, because of the alcohol profile."
"I'm somewhat torn about this beer. On one hand, I like the idea of a flavored quad, and cherry provides a good foil to the otherwise bruising power of such a malty monster. I don't really like the idea that this is essentially a quadruple and cherry flavoring black-and-tan. I'd rather see a direct product, with the fruit right in the fermenter. I also think the sweetness of the cherry lambic used (Lindemans?) detracts from the flavor. If anything, this quad needed a sour cherry. In any case, the deep brown body with ruby edges is appealing. Low carbonation. Smells of sweet figs, dates, and chocolate covered cherries. Main flavors are the same, with an unexpected viscosity (somewhat thin) and some transparent alcohol slickness. I think this could be tinkered with and improved upon. As it stands, I think it's just an average offering. Bottled versions may have more promise."
"What a super beer. It pours a mahahony tone with some garnet highlights. There was a huge tan head that seemed to last forever. The aroma was quite complex. the sour kriek lambic was in the forfront, but the bunt-ish brown sugar was quite evident. They all played well together in the flavor of the beer also. In the palate, you get the soft and smooth sensaton of a Belgian ale, with the sour astrinency of the lambic. This was the 2005 vintage. I hope I can come across a few more bottles of this down the line."
"Not my favorite from Ommegang, but still very good. Perfect for those cold winter nights."
"A very enjoyable brew, but i can tell this could benefit from some cellaring and it has a somewhat raw vibe now...but still another excellent beer from Ommegang."
"The taste of wheat hits you at first then the fruit tiny bubbles provide for a belgian like carbonation. Slightly medium bodied, and finishes nice. The taste of the alchohol is present but not by any means overpowering. Adds a nice warm feeling through the whole beer. Very well constructed, and a great balance."
"D- This is a very well designed beer. It is a quad first and the cherry lambic is a very subtle flavor."
"drinkability, is limited, due to the high abv, definitely a sipping beer, but not to be missed!..excellent stuff!"
"Served from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. Had a deep rich color with a lasting tan head. A nearly overwhelming variety of scents greets the nose, with a malty sweetness above all others. Has wine-like aromas at times. It is extremely smooth going down, no bitterness or bite to speak of and the alcoholic nature of this beer is masked by its complicated taste. I wasn't able to find many cherry lambic flavors in the blend, the quadrupel flavor seemed to overpower most of it, but occasionally I found a hint of oak or cherry in the background. Overall it is a beer that I would highly recommend, easily my favorite of the style. This will surely be on my shopping list from now on."
"Murky, light brown with red wine highlights that are glowing. Decent, carbonated shoe brown head that clings for its life. Oily slick and ohhh sooo smooth and delicate. Bordering on full bodied, and full of flavors; black cherries, roasted malts, coffee and chocolate are all noted in the initial sips. A near sweet and sour palate, tingly warming affect; hints of oak, raisins, figs and hazelnuts. As it warms, yeast and spicy qualities emerge, cotton candy, slightly acidic. Black licorise palate, very clean and satisfying. Tons and tons of flavorings; very tasty and ohhh sooo smooth, worthy of a Top-10 appearance in my book! Superior!"
"drinkability: more than drinkable"
"2004 edition. A dark, creamy head that helps to unleash a hypnotic Belgian candi sugar smell. Taste came up with a bit of Curaçao liquer and cocoa, making it more than a little buzzworthy. All I get from the kriek blend is a light sourness. Very good and an intriguing blend."
"Wow, pours a dark brown with a huge creamy head. The smell is an exotic mixture of chocolates, fruits and sugar treats. The bananna roasted chocolate is unbelievable to the nose, the yeast is fruity and terriffic. The taste is complex but has everything a belgian ale should have. Smooth sweet yeast blended well with compley malts. Perfect ale."
"Wow. This is a truely a crazy and unique brew. Nice presentation, cool ass bottle. This pours a gorgeous cloudy brown/ruby hue with a beige/brown creamy 1 inch head. The lacing is nice and sporadic. The smell is a combination of all sorta of amazing things with a sweet maltiness. Cherries, chocolate and apples(and maybe orange) were detected. In the begining I sort of felt attacked by the alcohol, the warmth actually hit me right there at the begining but as you experience it you are enveloped in amazingness. The cherry flavor seemed to fade into an excellent balance with the other flavors. The mouthfeel is moderate with a light carbonation that results in a really smooth ride. This is so damn tasty and complex (yet at the same time so drinkable and smooth) that my review does not do it justice, read the others. After you spend 2 or 3 minutes with this the drinkablility increases greatly. The alcohol is hidden very well. A real treat."
"Overall: A distinctive beer that is always worth re-visiting"
"Drinkability: Overall one hell of a tasty brew that is easily affordable at just under $5. Not bad for my first Quadrupel. Another winner from Ommegang."
"Nice dark maroon body, with lots of red highlights visible. Head is very large on the pour, which fades slowly to a solid creamy layer of foam. Lots of alcohol and cherries in the nose, other dark fruits and rum also present. Very rich and malty, witth dark chocolate covered cherries the showpiece. This is a very big beer, very interesting beer, the cherries play a big aprt of the experience. I like it a lot."
"Wow this is a tasty brew!!! Pours a nice ruby brown color. Good thick foamy head, that disapates to a nice lace around the edges. Good legs too. Smell was malty and fruity, couldn't peg either, very slight. Taste was a bang though. Belgium flavors all over, candy sugar, yeasty malts, and oh so sweet cherries. I can't believe how good this beer tasted. Not too powerful either. Great balance between malt, sweetness, and slight hop flavor. Considering it's abv, it was quite drinkable."
"Hazy, deep reddish brown colour. Light tan head with some lacing and good retention. Bready malt and apple skin/pear fruitiness dominate the aroma. Starts with malty sweetness, some spiciness shows up in the middle, followed by light cherry fruitiness at the end. Some yeastiness throughout. The finish has a light alcohol warmth and is mostly dry. Moderately low carbonation, medium body with a creamy texture. I really enjoyed the aroma and the alcohol is hidden well. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Pours a cloudy amber/red, nice highlights, big offwhite head, but it goes quick however leaves some nice lacing. Smell is malty sweetness, hops, apple skins, cherry. Taste is spice, maltiness, alcohol is apparent though muted, sour cherries near the end, and yeast. The carbonation was nice, medium, body was great. Tasty beer. Thanks DrJay."
"Pours a very dark ruby red, with a thick tan two finger head that gently fades away to a thick cap that leaves behind tons of lace. Smells of toffee, spices and a little cherry. Taste is a slightly sugary, malty and a mildly sour cherry. Had to keep myself from drinking it to fast with it being almost %10 ABV. Really good in all. I'll be keeping some of this on hand all the time"
"A euphoric philosophic thanks in the dualisms or abstractions contrived of existentialism and transcendentalism goes to warriorsoul for this experience in hedonism."
"I did give this beer a fair shot and scored it high in some areas. Something kept me drinking to finish the whole glass. I just don't consider this world class, but based upon what it is and what it is trying to accomplish, its really not that bad."
"Where, oh where is cave aged Three Philosophers!??!"
"A quite terrific American rendition to a Belgian Quad. Pours a viscous brown-ish red with golden highlights. Dainty white, fizzy head that fades quickly, but laces well. Smells sweetly with caramel, fruits, and spices. Tastes big on malt, and mildly caramelly, brown sugary, fig-ey, date-ey, and cherry-ey. Sweet spices of clove, corriander, pepper, and estery. Becomes more alcoholic through the body. Sweet and powdery finish. A good Belgian replica. A great buy for the buck."
"Mouthfeel is very full, with ample big bubbled carbonation and a creamy dense texture. Definately for sipping. I fely very toasty after a 750 to myself."
"Cheers."
"A definate must try. I have to get some more of this soon."
"Drinkability is low. This is a sipping beer for sure and at 9.8% you had better take your time with this one."
"Was given this one as a gift and could not wait to try, so I opened it up and gave it a whirl. I absolutely loved the color, a beautiful dark red, cherry wood color that was very crisp and clear. Outstanding. A sweet cherry aroma that was very subtle and smooth. Also noticed a slight medicinal smell, but did not think it was very overpowering or consuming. Taste was a bit rough, and would probably be better with a year of aging. Cherry taste was very noticeable and was quite interesting since it did not have the lambic-like tartness. I would purchase this one and probably let it age a year or two to smooth out some of the rough edges and let some of the malt characters come though. Overall, a very interesting and original beer that I would recommend."
"There are two good inches of dense, fizzy, tan head. Color is a cloudy, dark brown with pale sediment. Wow: rich, tangy nose has dark toffee syrup, chocolate and cherries. The front is tangy toffee, spicy with butter. In the middle there is dark, rich malt and tangy fruit. Lots of alcohol in the finish, with some buried cherries and bitter chocolate. Nice cherries push forward in the aftertaste, with some biscuit and spice. Wow. What a great use for Lindemans Kriek. Delicious, spicy, dark, fruity brew with a quite bitter finish. Brilliant."
"What a wonderful beer. Wonderful. It could be improved but Im not sure how, exactly. Its not lacking I drink this beer often but not often enough. This bottle has been in my cellar for a few months. My 750ml bottle was purchased in Milwaukee, MN. Now the smaller bottles are available in Omaha. Hell Yeah!"
"This is a good Quadrupel. I would recommend this beer (as well as other Ommegang products) to someone who would like an introduction to the style."
"Finger licking good."
"D&N: Very nice beer here, wish it were packaged in a smaller bottle, this big bottle will take me a few hours to enjoy. Very complex, drinks more like a nice wine than a beer. Worthy of trying if you like quads."
"This isn't the most highly drinkable beer obviously, intended more for sipping and pondering I suppose. In this sense, I really enjoyed the brew, but there was also a side to it that I found to be too much for me. Also slightly disappointing was that I couldn't even detect a hint of the kriek blend on the label until very late in the aftertaste (well after the brew is finished). Worth a drink, but make sure you are able to be alone with your beer and your thoughts, or at least in the company of a few like minded and intelligent drunkards."
"Addendum: Review was written during 1st 12-14 oz. Upon finishing the bottle, I stand by the review. But I say that this beer, although a thinker by nature, is best if you just drink and let it be what it is."
"taste started with a slightly sour cherry hit then finishes with a fairly smooth caramel malt and some spice from the belgian side of it. very wine like. it finished slightly dry with a nice alcohol tinge in the throat. quite warming as it went down. all in all a solid brew"
"The smell is extremely nice, giving a smooth cherry flavor on top an otherwise strong and appealing combination of malts. The taste brings layers of caramel and dark malts, with cherry more blended than simply added to the rest of the flavor. The mouthfeel is a little light, as might be expected after blending lambic in. This stuff is easy to drink."
"The beer is a beautiful deep, deep caramel color topped by a fairly tight beige head that just never says die. I swear the carbonation doesn't get in the way of the taste or the mouthfeel but is ever present in the appearance. Smells like plums mostly, definitely some alcohol in there too. About three quarters of the way through this and I can't decide whether it tastes more like cherries or grapes. Either way it is incredibly fruity and almost wine-like. Oh yeah... did I mention there is some alcohol in this. The mouthfeel is very good, lots of body but still light, kinda like eating fruity marshmallows. Drinkability, hmmm... well as much as I would like to keep tossin' this back it's very rich and got quite a kick. It will definitely be something to stash in the cellar for future desserts."
"A decent beer but not as good as I was expecting. This one poured a very dark brownish red color with a small bit of lacing around the glass. The smell was not to prominant and I could only detect a scent of alchohol and malty sweetness. The flavor was allmost too sweet for my liking and it left my mouth quite dry. Lots of malts dominated the scent, a little too much domination to me. Overall, try pairing it wilh a good cigar but drink slowly and wiith caution."
"Slàinte!"
"A tremendous effort- very well concieved and executed. Any thoughts one might have of a gimmick concept should quickly disappear upon the first sniff of this wonderful brew."
"Drinkability: this is so rich I don't think I could handle multiple offerings over the short term, but as for long term, I will definitely confer with the Three Philosophers as they are quite affordable."
"2004 Bottle: Pours reddish-brown with a medium thick dark beige head. Thin, slippery lacing. The aroma is fruity and spicy, with a pinch of malt. Medium-bodied with a tart but subtle cherry character. Sweet malt, spice and yeast flavors are offset nicely by the added Lambic. The finish is lively and long and fruity. Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is rich with good carbonation. Flows over the palate well. Just a tasty brew overall. Thanks to my dad for sharing this with me on Easter. I will most definetly have it again."
"Decided that this would be a good brew to go along with Easter dinner but actually finished the brew before we sat down for dinner. The brew poured to a dark amber color with some highlights of red/burgundy showing through. The brew had a nice sized tan head that had smaller bubbles and stuck around for the entire brew leaving a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aromas form this brew are of dark fruit, mostly cherries but can also plums and raisins I think. Also pick up a caramel like malt aromas along with a nice alcohol scent that seems to compliment the brew very well. This is a very smooth brew with a creamy like body. I can taste a lot of malt that lends it to having a sweet taste that does along with the slight cherry flavors. Also seems to have a nut like taste to it along with a slight hop that accent this brew really well. Has a alcohol flavor that gets more pronounced as the brew warms. This beer seems to be very complex as I am sure I am not capturing all of the scents and tastes from this brew adequately, but I can say that this is an extremely good beer."
"big bad quadrupel, slightly hazy, very deep ruby in color with a gorgeous head. smells sweet and spicy, alcohol upfront. maple syrup all over the place, big sweetness taken down a notch by a tart fruitiness (the lambic i presume). a touch yeasty with some nutmet spice. once again the alcohol is there, a slight burn in the nostrils and a nice warming sensation in the tummy. well carbonated and crisp, not heavy at all. a delightful brew that REALLY comes to life as it warms. top notch."
"Really quite good. The beer poured a average brown with a string red tinge to it. A sticky film formed a head on top that stuck to the edges of the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity--cherries. The flavor is quite quite sweet. The malts and hops are pushed aside by the cherry from the lambic. There are other fruit tones: prunes, apples and pear. The mouthfeel and drinkability is surprisingly rich and bold. The alcohol is nicely hidden, and I feel I must be wary of the sweetness."
"This was a fine dessert beer, which I paired with some dark chocolate. It seemed a good combination. This is most certainly NOT a session beer. Drink this last, but only if youve drank a moderate amount and can still grasp the flavor."
"I haven't really delved into the realm of lambics beyond the gueze genre because I never really liked the idea of fruit in beers. Reminds me of a wine cooler or someting. Although I really like little fruity notes that I get in the finer dark ales and quads, etc... So call me a hypocrite. But I really really liked this beer and found it to be not too overly cherryish as I thought it would be. First of all, really nice red amber color with a big poofy tan head, leaving some intricate lacing. Smell and taste are both a world of complexity. The main event really is the dark cherry flavor but there's plenty of other fruity spicy notes in there. Nutmeg, dates, figs, the list goes on and on. Really smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Very warming at almost 10%. I had this beer immediately following an Allagash Four and I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would compared to Allagash, one of my favorite breweries. But this beer is definately unique and can hold it's own. I'll probably go back to this one and I encourage anyone who is skeptical about fruit to check it out because it's really not overdone. Cheers."
"My favorite beer from Ommegang. Poured from a 750ml into a chalice glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with about 1/2 inch of head. Smell is of ripe fruits and alcohol. Taste is rich, malty, slightly sweet up front with a slightly sour finish with some definite warming from the alcohol present. Ripe fruits and sugars are present. This is one of the best US produced Belgian style beers I've had, and I'd put it up there with other Belgian quads and strong ales out there. Pretty drinkable, even though it has a high ABV and the alcohol is definitely apparent. Also, don't be shy about cellaring this one... The bottle I just consumed was cellared for about 9 months and it aged quite nicely."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer is too out of control for me. It's not horrible, but the alcohol is really overwhelming, way too much for a 9.8% beer. There are much smoother Quadrupels coming out of Belgium. Try those instead."
"Wow! This one looks, smells and tastes like what I would expect a true belgian to be. This is my first time trying an Ommegang product and I'm looking forward to trying others."
"Three Philosophers is a dessert in itself, one to be had at night by the fire. Everything from the packaging to beer itself demands your silent contemplation. Looks beautiful in a Trappist glass. An impenetrable cloudy brown, with a steady upward flow of carbonation. After the bubbles settle, it looks like chocolate milk with reddish edges. The strong cherry aroma hit me even as I poured, overwhelming my ability to detect much else. Strong taste of cocoa, cherries, and raisins. I agree with the reviewers who mention plumbs, too. There's a complicated dance of bitter and sweet. I expected the lambic would lighten it, but no, it's a full bodied heavy weight. Creamy, has a really nice feel. I plan to store away some more for a rainy day."
"As a quadrupel, it's not as complex as St Bernie Abt 12, Bush Ambree, or Rochefort, but, as I said, it's very tasty."
"Overall, despite its strength, I found it to be an extremely drinkable brew. My hat is tipped to Ommegang in upstate for this one."
"This is my first Ommegang and I'm going to have to try some others to really know why people rave about the brewery. While I trust they make good beers, Three Philosophers is not one I will pick up again."
"I'm hoping that I just have a bad bottle. This pours like a classic Belgian dark, small beige head that doesn't last long. Not much lacing if any. Smell is of a harsh liqueur with the fruit subdued. Alcohol predominates. Taste follows the pattern of the smell. This brew was harsh alcohol, very little fruit, some slight cherry notes like cough syrup. Rather than the best of a Belgian dark and cherry lambic, this tastes as if I'm getting the nearly 10% abv with some cherry flavoring. It is certainly sippable, but it didn't meet my expectations. I will try this again, given its obvious reputation. Wish me luck with the next bottle."
"from the bottle poured a muddy brown with a big light brown head. aroma dark cherries, malts, bitter sweet chocolate, raisins, dark fruits. aroma a slight suorness that gives way to the dark cheeris and chocolate and the fruits. nice smoth mouth feel. very enjoyable beer."
"Overall, a wonderful beer. A lot of folks said that there was an alcohol presence, but I had a hard time believing that this was 9.8%. When I finished, I wanted more, and there is really no higher complement I could think to pay to a beer. Another reason that I love Ommegang."
"A very enjoyable beer and perfect for a cold night like tonight. Comforts and consoles."
"I really struggled with the cork on this one. The beer apparently wanted to be aged instead of consumed. Oh well, I eventually won the battle. Pours a little lighter than I would've expected. A milk chocolate brown sits underneath a 1 finger creamy head with a slightly tanned twinge. Aroma is very rich with plum and roasty malt sweetness and a subtle earthy hint. Taste is very different from other quads that I've enjoyed. The usual dark fruit/malty goodness is there, but man does that kriek jump out at the finish. That cherry bite really balances out the earthy character of the brew. There's a slight acidity that comes along with the cherry that really shocks me and makes this beer so much more refreshing than a normal quad (Very dangerous at almost 10%). I don't remember Lindemans having this kind of slightly acidic punch. A slight bit of wood is present in the aftertaste. Unique beer which i can see being polarizing. Really really really well done. Quite possibly my favorite of the Ommegang lineup. I'll be enjoying this one on many more evenings to come."
"It would be a definate repeat, however, the cost would preclude regular buying ($8 a bottle is steep for a poor, starving college student). The good news is now I have a new addtion to my Christmas list nex year."
"Drinkability is fairly high, I will drink it again but not this 2004 edition."
"Out of the many bottles I've had of this beer, I much preferred it aged, at least two years. Even better is to get a hand on some of the cellar-aged bottles - I'm not sure where and if these are available, but I enjoyed some at a Ommegang party at Monk's Cafe a year ago and it was spectacular."
"First off, The color of the beer was a semi dense copper. Also one of my favorite things is to see yeast sediment floating around in the bottom of he bottle. To me that is the sign of where the true flavor and craftmanship comes from. The smell of yeast ( I think it was yeast, what ever it was, it was pretty pungent. I know it wasnt hops though) hit my senses as soon as I started to take a sip. Followed by a slight ever-so taste of caramel, and then cedar. I dont really know how to describe it other than cedar. Hops are apparent in the taste, but not overwhelming. I actually enjoyed it. The after taste wasnt the best but while I'm drinking it, It's one of the closet things to a home brew. Delicious."
"Id love to have this after a few years of shelving. High props to Ommengang. Cooperstown has another Hall of Famer here."
"For a beer of this caliber and complexity, 5 in drinkability is warranted I do believe. Very smooth and easy to drink. Wish I had another."
"The smell that seemed to pierce through the others was the cherry. I must also say this about the taste of the beer. My first to try from this style, so I did not know exactly what to expect. Overall this is a good brew, and I would definately give it a try again."
"Very complex beer, with lots going on. I saved this bottle about a year, but the only difference I can taste is a better finish, not quite so sweet as a young bottle. I'd like to try one about 4 or 5 years out, but don't know if I can save a bottle of this excellent beer that long."
"The color when poured was a sort of a hazy Root Beer Brown with a reddish hue. Not much on the foam, but some lace on the sides on the glass. The smell of spices filled the nose. The taste was of a creamy spicey nature on the palate with a bitter/sourness to the finish. Overall, a pleasant, but not an overpowering Belgium Style Ale. Better tasting, the warmer it got."
"Pours a dark almost chocolate colored brown, with some red highlights. An off-white head which includes some large bubbles caps the beer and lingers for some time. As expected, a strong aroma of cherries issues forth from the glass--this is nice, but the combination of cherries with some light alcohol notes reminds me a bit of cough medicine. Smooth with some pleasant sweetness and good fruity flavors (cherries, plums and others which I can't pin down). The cherry which was so overpowering in the aroma is much more subdued in making itself known in flavor. As the beer warms, a bit of alcohol taste comes forward, although not excessive to the point of detracting from the broader, nicely complex flavor. Overall this is a very nice beer--while I probably would not want much more than a glass per session it is certainly a beer I would look forward to having again."
"Murky brown, raisiny in color with a minimal off-white head. The aroma is of dark fruits, raisins, and dates, with a boozey, cherry smell. The flavor is malty and full of the dark fruits of raisins and dates and also a nice cherry flavor in the back. A very solid and tasty beer. I could drink this one over and over again if only they would come back to my hood. Top notch."
"Overall, Three Philosophers was an interesting beer, an intriguing blend of two styles. Complex and with a nice feel, the only downside I had with it was the overriding alcohol aroma and taste. Nevertheless, worth picking up a bottle if you see it somewhere."
"Good beer, but to be consumed in small quantities."
"2003. Pours a turbid chestnut color with some red highlights from the kriek infusion. Even the head is beige with a little bit of pink hue to it. Aromas of sweet malt, sun-dried cherry, and fusel alcohols. A year's aging fares this beer nicely. A little sweet; and too much cherry for my liking, but a solid quad nonetheless. Nicely carbonated, giving a creamy mouthfeel. A slight tartness in the finish keeps it drinkable, otherwise it might just be too sweet. The last glass poured seemed to have a bit more esteriness to it."
"Popped off the cap and immediately smelled that Ommegang smell. Pours a dark, russet brown. Light doesn't penetrate. Head is big and creamy and tan with a hint of red. Smellwise...I'm picking up dark cherries, oak, leather, alcohol, and yeast. Not overly aromatic, but nice and vinous. Dark, rummy fruits kick off the palate. Cherries, raisins, maybe plums in there. Slightly sweet, but slightly tart. Alcohol hits mid-palate, along with some leather, and a little oak. Bitterness backs its way in, but its a very herbal, tangy, and almost medicinal bitterness. Yeast is notieceable throughout. The finish has a tart apple taste to it. Warming. Full-bodied, but with a rather fluffy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little on the ""too much"" side. Overall, a decent beer, but not my favorite Ommegang product."
"This is definitely one to sip and savor. The taste itself was okay, but something was lacking to really set it apart. Not sure if this is better by itself or paired with food. I think the correct food match-up would bring out even more of the flavor nuances that this beer might have. I enjoyed it, yet I wasn't ""blown-away"" either."
"Drinkability: Packing a big punch means consumption in quantity is limited...but what a wonderful adventure!"
"P.S. I paired this with plain bittersweet chocolate wedges and it turned into ten times the beer it was on its own. The cocoa balances the quadruple part of the beer, the sugar and fat cancels out the alcohol, and the soft, luscious kriek element shines on through as well as an interesting Westy-inspired grape bubblegum finish. As a pairing, the Three Philosophers would merit at least a 4-point score, but it is indeed weak on its own."
"Pours a nice cloudy dark brown with big fluffy tan head lots of good lacing , a great looking beer. Aroma is little subdued malt with dark fruits raisins plums some black cherries with spice present. Taste is nice malt with fruity flavors raisins plums ect very solid tasting beer. Finishes with light spice and hops present sweet and lightly bitter plus a little sour. Mouthfeel is very solid a big beer their is know doubt. Drinkability is good a nice little quadrupel to say the least. Again thanks goes to merlin48 for the sample and the good times had tasting."
"Pours a cloudy brown with bronze highlights. Moderate head which leaves a good film of lace on top and lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is lightly toasted malts with strong candied fruits, subdued sour cherries, and alcohol spice. The taste starts with light toasted malts, develops slight lambic and cherry sourness, turns into sweet candied fruits and alcohol spice, and finishes with nice drying hops and very long-lasting sour kriek finish. Nice medium body with good creamy feel and carbonation. Very tasty and relatively easy to drink. Superbly complex and compelling."
"Cheers"
"Superb."
"the label says it's ready for immediate consumption without aging, but i don't agree. this one definitely wasn't ready for drinking. i was disappointed, especially considering how much i love ommegang, hennepin and rare vos."
"It poured a cloudy amber that produced a tan lace. The aroma was of sour malt and alcohol with a little tamin in the tail end. The taste was mainly of malt with an undercurrent of strong fruit it finished with a strong alcohol bite. The feel was exceptionally creamy. a very drinkible beer."
"At 9.8% abv, and all that is going on in terms of flavors, this quadruple is like drinking a four course meal. Not too heavy, but it would be tough to have more than a few glasses. Nonetheless, a gem and something to seek out."
"Beer is good. Happy Quad beering."
"Had this at 2004 Extreme Beer Fest but the day was a blur so this is a much better chance to review the beer.Very nice chestnut color. Excellent head-retains it all the way down too which is nice. Aroma of malt,yeast. Slight sourness to it. doesnt really say fruit or cherries-byproduct of the yeast? Somewhat vinuous and oakey. Malty and wine like flavors upfront. Slight tartness-as it warms this increases. A great mix of flavors-raisens,currants,cherries-hints of vanilla and oak. Nice full body. 9.8% ????-no way!!! You could certainly never tell here. Quite an amazing beer. One bottle is a meal in itself. Go for it."
"For such a light feeling beer, this sure came across as being quite rich. Good melding of the Quadruple/lambic styles. I was still thinking about the deep flavors of this one the next day! Excellent."
"Notes: 2003 Edition."
"Pours out a deep dark dark amber with an almost yellow tan head. The fruity does come through which is very nice as it mellows what I imagine would have been a much harsher brew without the blended Lindemans Kriek. This is a huge beer though. Flavors are through the roof but for me the hole it makes lets in the rain. I do think this beer will be excellent with some cellar time under its belt. I'm glad to see American brewers experimenting like this."
"JUST DON'T DRINK IT COLD."
"Cherry chocolate truffle with brandy. Quite a lot of fizz, and oak, cabernet, roasted coconut, upside-down pineapple cake with scorched cherries... Mama and papa like this, and mama and papa could drink lots of this in front of the fire place."
"One of the highlights of what I managed to find on my trip to Vegas, I've been itching to try this stuff. Came in a large 750 ml brown bottle, caged and corked, 2004 edition. Safety comes first with Ommegang, as on the back label they recommend pointing the cork away from any friends while opening. Poured into my Leffe chalice, it's a deep murky/cloudy mahogany body, capped with a massive fluffy beige head with intense retention. Serious lacing as well. The nose is heavenly, sweet toffee malt, rum raisins and figs, dark grape and cherry, bubblegum and cotton candy. Underlying vinuous alcohol throughout on the flavour, it starts out with purple grapes and cherry skins, along with alcohol soaked dark dried fruits like raisin, dates, figs and currents, a sweeter rummy toffee towards the middle with notes of earth and wood, a dry twig-like roasted espresso finish, with light sour cherry tones. I'm practically chewing on this flavour on the aftertaste, so much to register. The mouthfeel is creamy, velvety and somewhat effervescent, not as thick and chewy as the flavour would have one expect at first. My first foray into the quadrupel style, an interesting and successful blend, I shall willingly grab more when the opportunity arises (damn suitcase space and customs duty!). Not a session beer or an everyday drinker, but I would love the opportunity to break this out for special occassions and special people on demand."
"IMHO: an interesting interpretation of a quad and I like the addition of a the lambic, but knock my socks off it did not."
"Fairly drinkable but not exactly what I am looking for."
"2003 bottle. Poured a dark mahogany color with a two-finger sized, off-white head. Head had excellent retention. Aroma had a slight red wine oakiness with cherries and malts and a alcohol presence. Cherry lambic flavors are rather upfront, leaving the sweet malts to try their best to balance it all out. Alcohol was not obtrusive and overall this blend of lambic and ale made for a warming and unique drinking experience. Mouthfeel was smooth and medium to heavy bodied with medium carbonation. This would probably be best to sip after a meal."
"I love this beer! Distinctive, fruity taste, get's better with every sip. I noticed the cherry taste, but not much. The dark fruit notes are prevalent. Great balance, sweet (but not overly so). ABV not noticed in the taste at all. Doesn't taste ""just like"" anything. Smooth, creamy and satisfying. I will purchase this beer every time I get the chance. This was the 12oz. version, I will have to try the 750. Great brewery, great beer."
"750ml bottle (2003 vintage): The beer pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. There was quite a bit of an off-white, but it subsided quickly. Big nose full of different fruits, with mainly cherries coming through. Also a yeasty breadiness to the nose. Some sweet caramel in there also. The initial taste is tart cherries, with a hint of sweetness also. There is a somewhat chocolate aftertaste that finishes a touch dry. Some spiciness comes through also. Definitely full bodied. A very good beer!"
"Reddish brown with a very vigorous, medium tan head. Slightly sour cherry nose with some good malty tones. Mild candy sugar notes. Tastes like chocolate-covered cherries! Quite nice. Alcohol warms the finish. Rich mouthfeel, with a long, lingering finish. Very tasty. An enjoyable brew. Quite solid throughout. Nice and drinkable. Not an everyday brew for me, but good to have occasionally. Definately worth a try."
"It is great in the mouth with a medium to full body."
"750 ml bottle. Brewed in 2003. $6.99."
"The major flavors of sweet malts and ripe cherries with an alcohol warmth finish. Creamy and complex. This is amazingly smooth for a 9.8% ABV quadrupel."
"The beer pours a nice dark redish brown color. There is a 3 finger head that falls very slowly, leaving a nice thick lace around the glass when it falls. The nose is malty sweet with fig coming through dominantly. There is not but a hint of the alcohol in the nose, which is good for the ABV. The first taste has a metallic taste to it, which detracts, but this flavor is not present in later sips. The beer is nicely balanced with good sweet malt that give it a subdued fig flavor. The beer is big, but not offensive. Very good. Its thick, but not syrupy. I enjoy this. I would like to try it out of the corked bottle to see if the metallic taste comes through in that offering. This is a highly drinkable beer for the ABV and style. I would drink this again."
"As someone who has never been overly impressed by ommegang offerings, I was blown away by this one. Poured a hazy tan colour with a moderate head. The aroma of cherries were ever present, but not overpowering. Very nice taste. of cherries balanced nicely with hops. I was surprised by this. Usually the cherry beers end up overly cherry tasting like cough syrup (sam adams), but we have a winner here"
"This one can be passably sipped. It's one of Ommegangs better brews, which isn't saying anything at all. I think I taste Hemlock. To quote Aristotle...""This beer tastes like Hitler."" Ommegang...philosophize my sink, or toilet."
"Vodka soaked Fig Newtons and plum skins. What starts as smooth, alcohol-free complexity (d)evolves into a somewhat harsh alcohol presence as it warms. Tart Michigan cherries are a minor presence, but I can't shake it. Finishes a bit yeasty and much drier than anticipated. A bit astringent; I'm chewing on wood chips here every now and again. But quite good. I have this same issue with Rochefort 10, but I really wish this held up a little better as it warms, because I could easily put back the whole 750 without -- and this only shows my laziness -- returning it to the fridge during the wait."
"This came in a nice looking 750ml corked bottle. This appears a nice brown color with dark red hues in the light with a nice sized beige head. While receding down to a collar of bubbles there are nice sheets of lace left clinging to the glass that stay for the duration. A very complex aroma rises out of the glass the smells of sweet fruits, caramel malt and the cherry lambic can be detected as well more so when it warms. There are also trace amounts of alcohol and spice in the nose as well. The taste starts of with the sweet caramelized malts with fruits such as apples and cherries coming through. The finish has a good earthy hop flavor, slight alcohol with a lingering cherry taste. There is so much going on in the taste I will need to pick up a few more bottles to fully appreciate this tasty brew. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a coating light fruit sweetness that is amazing. This is defiantly a sipper but I could sip this all day provided I had no plans. This is defiantly one of my new favorite beers, great job by Ommegang."
"Pours the colour of a rich black cherry soda with a ecru head. the smell is of cherry, pomogranite, and carmel apple. Taste is malty and rich with the sweetness of the cherry cutting through it like a knife. Was not as lambicy as I expected it just seemed to add a bit of sweetness and tart flavour to cut the richness of the beer. Mouthfeel was nice with light pinpoint carbonation at first. By the end the beer had flattened a little which melded the brew even better. The alcohol is muted at first, but as it warms it begins to show through. A really tasty brew, but more of a special occasion brew.. I wish I had one to save and see how it progressed."
"Ommegang is s-erious brewery, and I look forward to any new beer they produce"
"It is undeniably fresh yet found it bland. Watered down cherry and not a full punch of a quad. Could it have been dusty glasses?"
"Reddish brown with buttercream-colored foam. The nose is a dense, furry wall of black cherries, macerated and scorched into a paste. Almond butter, nutmeg, jerky, sticky, moist, brown and black breads and pepper assert their presence as aromas too. On the palate it burns slightly, but ultimately in service to a leathery circus of flavors including soot, toffee-stewed, overripe apricots, plums and cherries. There is a distinct, severely burned sugar component to this beer, reminiscent of authentic creme brulee or black-topped croissant crusts. Overall the bitterness works just to cover any residual sweetness and ensure a slightly gritty, dry finish - some alcohol fume heat is apparent as it closes."
"Overall I like a few of this breweries beers better than this but that is personal preference....I would consider this a nice Thanksgiving Day meal brew....would seem to mesh well with a lot of foods...as a sipper it is good but I'd take a few others over this for just sitting back and sipping on.."
"The beer after releasing its grip on the 750ml corked and wired brown bottle sets in the glass a somewhat hazy mahogany color, the head stupendous in size, spumescent in texture and the color a winsome light tan, the lace after decomposition of the head forms a thin veil to obscure the glass. Nose is laced with black cherries, caramel, a hint of musk, clean and crisp, with the start ambrosial, nice malt profile and the top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops forceful but not overpowering, very dry aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a great beer from a long time favorite brewery."
"Exactly as promised on the label - sweet caramel malt & cherry flavours. But its got a whole lot more. Subtle fruity notes lurk all over, along with some spicy yeast character. Everything works very well together. Slight warming of the throat is noticeble, but not annoying. Slick on the tongue. Moderate carbonation that had a soft feel to it. Quite enjoyable with chocolate covered cherries."
"Drinkability/Overall: Outstanding brew, very complex. Pairs very well with food. Something I would definately consider cellaring. Highly Recommended!"
"Overall: This is one very complex Belgian-style Quadruple ale made exclusively for sipping. Highly recommended! But do drink this with caution as it clocks in at a staggering 9.8% ABV."
"Drinkability: I'll have this one again, for sure."
"Murky red, nearly black with a thin tan head with no lacing. Dark fruits dominate the aroma with raisins, cherries and plums sweetening the nose. Flavor is pleasantly tart over a sweet candy and malt base. Earthy yeast flavor and a slight spicy biterness creep in towards the end. Hugely complex yet very drinkable. Huge props to my sister's fiance who scored this gem for me."
"There is an interesting battle going on here, with both the belgium style ale and the lambic jockeying for position. In one corner is the sherry like flavor of a fine belgian ale, in the other you have the upfront aggressiveness of the cherry lambic. Superb blending of the two!"
"VERY dark red, quite opaque. Thick retained head of fine bubbles. Smells smoky with hints of fruit. Has a pleasant taste of spice, cherries, malt and perhaps other fruit infusions. Has very complex taste on your tongue, hitting you at different times. The balance is very good as well, nothing is overpowering. However, as the ale warms, a strong alcohol smell and taste comes out. A very interesting blend that is a good choice for a change of pace."
"Very drinkable brew, this would be excellent for a holiday brew."
"This was a dark orange/brown pour. Plenty of liveliness in the glass and a generous head. The nose was obviously spicey and sweet. Hints of caramel fudge an underlying spiciness. The taste was much of the same. Medium bodied with a full, lively mouthfeel. Sweet on the finish with a nice lingering touch."
"This beer (which finally showed up here after all the others did long ago)poured a dark, very red amber color and formed a small light tan bubby head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, plum and spices. The flavor was of malt, raisins and spices. There are slight citrus notes, but nothing to really show the cherry lambic added. As with all other quads, like grand crus, it's hard to know if there is a set standard for the style. But this was still a good beer."
"I want more...now."
"DRINKABILITY: Stop me at 3. Then I may vomit."
"Comments  What a huge gesture from AleOha to send me not one, but two bottles of this incredible Belgian Ale. Hell be happy to know that Im spreading the wealth and will share the second bottle with some local BAs. Cheers to BeerAdvocate.com!"
"Three Philosophers was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle, with a neck label indicating Brewed in 2004. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a very dark brownish ruby red color, and was topped by a thick and fine light brown head. The nose was rich and enveloping, letting loose a barage of cherry-caramel-plantain maltiness with amazing underlying subtleties: tingly tartness, musty chocolate, and luscious esters. The taste presented a dark and bitter cherry-laced buttery maltiness with a warming alcoholic kick and accents of musty banana and freshly turned earth. This finished with a dark cherry skin-chocolate bitterness with lingering earthy cherry notes. The flavors of this beer reached their highest complexity and intensity near room temperature. The body was appropriately full for the flavors and character of the beer. The evident alcohol decreased the drinkability considerably, but then again this was meant as a sipper I would guess. Three Philosophers was a robust and tasty tummy warmer with very nice assortment of flavors. A succesful blend of the dark Belgian-style ale with a kriek."
"This is very smooth and creamy in the mouth. It also has some real bite to it, which I like. I have to say that it is good from first drop to last, but this is not a beer that I want to sit down to do a lot of drinking. It is a sipping beer that after two glasses left me satisfied."
"Smooth and silky in the mouth, and the carbonation just tickles the tounge. Awesome feel to this one. A 750 is easily and joyfully consumed."
"Drinkability: Given the 9.8% abv, it sneaks up on you only after you've had several snifters, by then it's far too late. Just call me a happy guy."
"Served from a 750 ml corked, bottle-conditioned behemoth on 3/23/2004. Poured with an initial thick, creamy head into snifter, which settled to a thin layer with a golden tinge after resting. Copper-red hue with visible carbonation present. Strong cherry up-front bouquet is noticeable from a foot away, and upon closer inspection a malt character is present, but cloaked. Not overpowering aromatics. Cherry, go figure, comes through at initial taste, followed by a slight astringency. Like the bouquet, other flavors eventually make their way through the heavy Lindemans, but not enough to point out. Alcohol not overdone. Quite drinkable, though krieks are not high on my list. Still, I wont refuse to drink them like Kumar. Im just glad Jim wasnt around when Kumar was offering it up, because he loves this kind of stuff."
"Drinkability - a decent beer but not really repeatable. A beer tasting kind of thing or an alternative way to wind down a busy day instead of wine."
"Light, airy, nearly bubbly body. Creamy feel. Much less heavy than I anticipated, but very very pleasant. Supersmooth and very drinkable, paired this with roasted pork loin, sweet peas, carmelized onions with grilled mushrooms and chocolate truffle dessert. A typical Monday night at the Wayne household. :)"
"This was something else. Pours a very dark color with a moderate head which left some nice lacing. The taste was something else in this quadruple: at some points the cherry lambic seemed excessive, at other moments it was dead on. This would be something to open and share with a friend as an after dinner drink. It is not something I would make a habit of but it is definitely worth trying."
"A fun beer - but hard to find the occasion to repeat it."
"A deep, deep red beer with an ample tan head. Clove, coriander and cherries dominate the nose. Three Philosophers tastes spicy, oakey, sour, with a dry finish and a hint of sour cherries through and through. Highly carbonated and light on the palate, with the bubbles bringing the flavors up to my nose. An amazing blend of flavors - extremely complex, especially as it warms. Very drinkable for the high ABV. This beer would undoubtedly age well, but is amazing fresh."
"Served close to room temp in a chalice, poured from a 750 ml. The appearance was excellent, dark ruddy brownish red. More brown than red really, but it certainly had a reddish hue that pointed to the lambic blended in. Medium tannish head which left nice rings of lace after each sip. Also a nice healthy dose of yeast coating the bottom of the bottle. The smell was exceptional. The usual banana like Belgian yeast fragrance but accompanied by the cherry scents of the lambic. The smell reminded me almost of the cherry soaked cigars that my uncles and cousins used to make when I was a kid. Also some solvent odors that hint of the 9.8 abv. The taste was excellent as well. Sweet, banana like, and earthy hints of cherry. Very complex. I did not experience the medicinal taste that others have spoken of. In fact the warmer it got the less solvent like it became. As it warmed the cherry flavors became more apparent almost like cherry soaked cedar wood. The mouthfeel was rich and thick. Very filling. Drinkability was good, I drank the whole 750 over the course of a few hours. All and all an excellent experience and one I will try again. I'd like to cellar one of these."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this one."
"Corked magnum bottle that opened with a satifying ""pop"" and a waft of condensation. Poured a deep burgundy into the chalace with a tight, fizzy head that quickly settled. The mouthfeel, particulary on the first few sips, was rather odd - a foamy feeling that coated the tongue, much like a nitro stout does. Highly carbonated. Flavor was earthy, with a prominent bitter cherry flavor, like cherry pits. I don't think I've ever said this about a beer before, but this could have benefited from just a touch of sweetness to better develop the cherry flavor. As it was, the bitterness was rather harsh and tended to overwash what probably would have otherwise been some nice Belgian malt and yeast flavors that tried to distinguish themselves, but couldn't quite make it."
"Overall this is a good beer, especially if you like earthy flavors."
"Bought a bottle for $4.50. I love Ommegang; quality Belgian styles brewed in the USA. The only quad I had ever had was Weyerbacher so I wasn't too familiar with the style. Poured a reddish-amber color and left a head that lingered till I finished the glass. Strong fruitiness abundant in the aroma. And it tastes oh so sweet. Not as strong as other quads but 9.8% nontheless. But you BAs are responsible fellows HAHA!"
"Sorry to be a sore thumb, but I didn't think this beer was that tasty at all. I used a nice glass, like the one on the bottle and filled it half with beer, dark cherry and opaque in color. The other half was full of thick tan frothy head. The head did die down rather quickly. I have this around for about an hour now, and it really hasn't improved that much. The smell is of sweet cherry cough syrup or drops (remember Ludens?). What strikes me with the taste is that the cherry syrup is on one side of the room, and the ale is on the other. I am actually shocked that the flavors are not that well blended. It's almost as if someone took one beer and poured it into another. The flavors do seem to blend more the longer it warms, but the aftertaste is bitter, and not bitter in a pleasant hoppy way (medicine theme comes to mind again). I still have one bottle of this, anyone want it?"
"This beer poured a red color with a moderate head and left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was very busy and pleasing. Smelled of sweetness/sugar, cherries, yeast, and some other fruits. The taste is great. Tastes of cherries, other fruits, sweetness (but not too sweet), caramel, and malts. Very well made beer."
"750ml bomber poured a deep blood red in my glass with a thick lingering head. Sweet smell of cherries filled my nose as I brought the glass up to my lips. The sweet fruity taste is earned after your mouth deals with the carbination and strong taste of alcohol. Once the carbination and alcohol feel dissapated I greatly enjoyed each sip of this quad. I'd love this one with a big slice of New York cheesecake, that's some good living. This one is definitely enjoyed in small doses however."
"3P finally arrived in southern California after much anticipation. It pours a glowing red with a foamy head that lingers, leaving little mounds of bubbles all over the top of the beer. The cherry smell is very subtle at the start but becomes more pronounced after sitting a while. It tastes nice but never seems to go quite where it seems it should. The cherry is just hiding in the background and never makes a full appearance. It's tantalizing in its tartness but just remains tantalizing. All in all, it's an interesting and enjoyable beer; it's just a bit disappointing after the wait."
"Dark amber colour. A bit of bready malt, load of caramel and some cherries in aroma. Blending is made in heaven! Creamy, fruity and malty body. Surprisingly powerful carbonation. Load of chocolate flavors. Dry finish. Actually this very vinous beer. People who likes Australian plummy Shiraz wll like this beer. Great brewery, awesome beer!"
"This is another great beer from a great brewery. It is wonderful now and I image it will only get better with age. It is a clear dark-ruby color. The aroma is fruity and there is some trace of the alcohol. It is fairly complex with tastes of cherry, some caramel, and choclate. It is very malty, but is spicy enough to ropund it out. Definitely a sipper."
"750ml corked bottle brewed 2003. This Quad poured a cloudy reddish brown with a head that settled down to a thin tan layer just like others in the style.Underneath the bready malt aroma lies subtle notes of cherries giving this a fantastic malty fruitiness that is a delight to the nose. One of the best aromas I can remember at the moment. The body is soft and full with a crisp carbonation that dances on the tongue. The flavor has everything you'd expect in the style. Fruit, malt, yeast and an asortment of spices that all add up to a complex and completely satisfying ale. Overall I found this ale an exceptional example of fine craft brewing that I highly recommend giving a try."
"In a chimay chalice, 3P is deep brown with a light brown smallish head, fully diminishing. Bottle-conditioned with a few yeast particules. Deep malt aroma, most herbal from our ABT lineup (sage, basil). Malt profile is caramelic, but also fruity. Now I know this is made with cherry lambic and I can find the cherry aspect to it, but I'm not confident I would've without searching it. On the other hand, there's a definite peachy profile into this, together with bready yeast and maple. The body is outstanding, better than any ABT from belgium I've had, decadent creaminess and perfectly mouth-filling. Finish is chocolatey and malty. A fine-tuned desert beer, a most excellent rendition by Ommegang, who would have thought a New York State brewer could make a beer to match the monks' legendary big guns. 2 thumbs up Martin!"
"Taste is lightly sour with some underlying cherry sweetness. Eases into a fruity maltiness with alcohol flavors underpinning all of this. Some port flavors in there too. Lots of flavor and complexity. Almost like two beers at once (oh yeah, it is!) Lots of sour/sweet cherry up front finsihed with a strong belgian dark ale in the finish. very nice and a great candidate for aging. It'll be even better in 6 months I'll bet."
"The appearance is a red-brown with a golden hue. You can see the carbonation. The head was a light tan that laces. It smells more like cherries than in tastes like cherries. It's a typical Belgian-style in its carbonation. It's slightly bitter, but the bitterness doesn't linger in your mouth. It's pretty smooth considering the carbonation. I might have another one again, but it is a sipping beer."
"The cork almost came out by itself once I uncaged it. It has an extremely dark reddish-amber color with lots of carbonation. Very yeasty, malty, and fruity smelling and tasting. A bit of sourness too. I can also smell and taste the cherry, I wonder what this would be like without the Lambic added. Mouthfeel is very good for this style with alcohol and carbonation standing out. It's a very good beer when you are in a sipping mood or with a meal. It's not something I'll drink a lot of, but it would be a great, fairly tame way to introduce newcomers to the Belgian style."
"This one needs to be tried. Get one at the earliest opportunity."
"Appearance: Dark amber hue nice creamy tan head leaves uneven coats of lacing. Aroma: Strong vinous alcohol infused malts with semi tart hints of Lindemann's Kriek that will only mellow with time. Tones of honey wrapped in mild chocolate this is beautiful, finishes with brown sugar awesome stuff. Taste: The taste is a bit rough shows some signs of being young needs to be put away for a few years, the alcohol shines through pretty bright with chocolate covered cherries. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied effervescent Belgian style. Drinkability: Pretty good stuff, by about next year this is going to be so smooth watchout for the 9.8 abv."
"2002 release. Murky deep crimson hue, with copious animated yeast aggregates. Spritzy carbonation. Tall, fluffy tan head leaves sparse lace. After an initial snap of ethanol, the aroma settles into a balanced, subtle combination of cocoa dusted prune, underripe cherry and banana esters. Becomes more herbaceous as it breathes, with oily hints of myrrh and trace coriander surfacing. In flavor, toffeeish dark candi sugar notes upfront yields to a melange of raisin, semi sweet chocolate and buttery oak hints. Suspended yeast makes its presence known in a complementary, gentle, underbaked bread and must undertone. Ethanol character is subdued, and is discernible by a subtle black pepper and licorice presence. Once sufficient CO2 is released from solution, the mouthfeel is revealed to be firmly dextrinous and agreeably creamy. A slight nutty, brittle like note emerges late concomitantly with a soft, pleasant, dilute bourbon like alcohol presence. Finishes protracted and complex with lingering notes of buttery, cocoa tinged toffee coupled with a prune like acidity. A highly enjoyable, continously morphing brew. After all is said and done, it's reminescent of a English barleywine / Dark Strong hybrid. Surprisingly shy in outright yeast ester presence. I am quite curious as to how this compares to a ""fresh"" 2003 version. I noticed very little kriek character in flavor."
"pours a nice semi-cloudy brown-amber colour with a moderate tan head that looks nice at first but dissolves rather quickly. smells of cherry twizzlers, malt, bread, bit of alcohol and a general fruit aroma. the taste, while complex, just isn't balanced enough. starts off with a sweet cherry flavouring, then goes into a malty alochol middle, which, combined with the cherry is more medicinal in flavour than anything else. finally, this one finishes with a bold dry, alcohol finish that hints at some spice flavour as well. the alcohol is simply too dominant here. it's warmth is nice, but it's flavour isn't as welcome, which also makes for an unbalanced mouthfeel. this one wasn't bad overall, but could use some subtlety in the alcohol department and even tone down the cherry flavouring an ever so slight notch."
"A good quad, with just the right hint of tart cherry to make it slightly sweet. One I've been looking for, and though slightly disappointing (was picturing slightly below Westlveteren, to be fair) this is still a nice year round offering to add to the Ommegang line, and I'll probably have this again."
"Popped the cork and a nice swosh of CO2 escapes. Th ebeer pours a dark reddish brown with a fairly thin head. The aromas on this beer are thick, caramel, apples, maple, rich and heady. Also, some musty, wet barn like aromas. The flavors are the same, dark rich plums and sauted cherry, caramel, melted butter. Deep malt flavors conceal the alcohol until I drew some air across my tongue and got an ethanol shot in the back of my nose. I have another that I'm going ot cellar, but I'll be buyin more of this years"
"As I popped the cork a rush of foam followed. Very carbonated. Upon the pour a semi-massive head ensued but it stayed controlled for the most part. Dark red, slightly purple in color with a thick, dark tan head. Bubbles race to the top. Explosive in appearance. Smell is mellow and very vinous. I can't get much more than that. Taste is intensely complex. Obviously cherries are present and are the first thing that comes to my mind while drinking this beer. Many more vinous, dark fruits are there such as plums, grapes, figs, red apples, and maybe even pears. The malt backbone though is caramel, a sweet caramel taste and that holds everything together. Hop taste is a little on the weak side but it is very floral when it comes out. Yeast is strong and a little overbearing at times. Very dry finish. Alcohol flavor is also very noticeable and sometimes too much. Super thick in body. Maximum effervescence. This beer is definitely is sipper and finishing 750ml will take awhile. However the flavors are amazingly complex and they fit together very well. A unique and intriging brew."
" This is a very well made beer. You can tell that a world class brewer put this beer together. Having said that it is missing something; though it is quite complex a couple of other dimensions would be wonderful here. Perhaps a bit of acidity & a bit of Brettanomyces character would be wonderful (I know this is a ridiculous request as these things are not too controllable, but De Dolle gets some of this right, at least sometimes). A very rich beer that is quite satisfying, I definitely like this best of the Ommegang products."
"Medium-full feel, smooth."
"First things first, the alcohol just hit my palate hard which is very disappointing. I really am trying to like this but I just can't. Some red licorice and plum flavors but where is the black cherry from the Kriek? A nice malt backbone but damn this is hard to finish. Finish is dry, leathery and lingering but very unpleasant. I really thought this would be my brew but oh well."
"Very nice presentation in a corked and caged 750ml bottle, served at cellar temperature into a goblet. I had to use a corkscrew to get the cork out. Pours a deep mahogany with a moderate beige head that has good retention. Looks like a fine sherry when the head settles down. No lacing was noted. Aroma is intriguing, with a spicy background of clove and coriander, and various fruits up front. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, not much carbonation. Taste is smooth, with a caramel flavored background that reminds me of chocolate covered cherries. Although this is blended with Lindemann's Kriek, I taste a lot more fruits than cherries. Plums, apricots, raisins, and prunes, stand out more than cherries. I really can't taste the Kriek at all, but this one has an abundance of fruitiness. Not a lot of hops here, but I love the flavors. I hope I can resist the urge to uncork my other bottle for awhile. This is a very interesting American effort at a Belgian quadruple, and I like it a lot."
"An excellent brew, but somehow I was looking for more. It started with a beautiful burgundy color and a great head. Smell was fruity with a light malt essence and very little alcohol presence. I had hoped for a bit more. Taste was initially sweet, then burst into a strong cherry presence....definite alcohol notes. Mouthfeel: after initial sweetness. a very, very dry, alomost wine-like presence that was nice. Easy to drink for a high abv...but definitely a sipper."
"Pours a one-fingered head that doesn't leave any lace. Light carbonation, medium bodied. Nose has black cherry overtones, starts on the sweet side finishes smooth and mellow. A very good quadrupel too bad this limited brew is no longer available. $7.50 for a 500ml bottle."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep reddish brown color with three fingers of light tan head. There is a fair amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of fruit, including cherry and plum. It is a sweet smell, that has a hint of alcohol in it as well. The taste is malty and sweet, with only a hint of cherry. There is more of other fruits in there; raisins, dates, and currants. The finish is fairly sweet, a little tart. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and fairly smooth. The drinkability also fairs well for a beer of such high alcohol. A new wintertime treat for me!"
"Just as good as I'd expected. Poured beautifully deep and dark, with a golden head. Within its phenolic aroma are detectable hints of cherry. Tart, roasted flavor and mellow mouthfeel. Much more alcohol flavor than the other Ommegangs, but it's to be expected for such a strong beer. I think I might well save my other bottle for a while, let it age, and then compare."
"I have been impressed with all of Ommegangs offerings that I have tried to date, and this is no exception. It is a very interesting experiment. But I would certainly like to drink a vintage example of this, as I feel age may well improve this further."
"This was an really interesting beer as i'm not a big belgian beer fan. it Started off too cold so I let it sit around for a while before tasting it to let it warm up. When cold, it's a bit thin and bitter, but when it warmed up, it became much more complex. some spicy/yeasty and a little cherry nose. Tartness from the lambic was mixed and mild and only came through as it warmed to the point where it should have been served."
"Pours with a fluffy, loose head of foam. Lightly rustic, powerful cherry aroma. The first sip (served a bit too cold) tastes syrupy with a cherry cough drop flavor -- this isn't a bad thing -- although I thought I'd taste more malt. As it warms up I notice some malt flavors and the bitter finish is more pronounced. I notice the alcohol towards the finish. This beer is not as full bodied as I had expected, nor as complex. I was hoping for more complexity and perhaps that sugary, caramel charcter I've found in a St. Bernadus Abt 12, which also could be considered a quadrupel. Despite these perceived shortcomings, I did enjoy Three Philosophers, and will definitely drink it again. Another fine, and creative beer from Ommegang! I really appreciate the blending of a strong dark ale with Lindeman's Kriek."
"The armoa was somewhat cidery but plagued by astringent and alcoholic smells. The taste had some of these minor problems, but was otherwise quite tasty. The sediment accented the fruity and tart tastes, probably the yeast itself giving the flavor. Much like a cider, there was a very dry, tart finish."
"A wonderful looking beer. Cloudy reddish-brown in color with a small tan head. The smell is typically Belgian and reminds me a lot of their Ommegang beer. Maybe a tad bit sweeter. The first thing I notice is the huge malt backbone. Cherrys, raisins, yeast and bananas are all tastes that I pick up. The taste kind of switches from malt to sweet. The 9.8% alcohol is very apparent in this young beer as it leaves a great warming feeling at the end. I think one year in the cellar will do this beer some good. Interesting fresh, but I think it may smooth out over time."
"Char"
"Taste is very, very good. Malt overrides all, yet I can still detect cherry flavor from the lambic, coffee flavor, sugar flavor, bitterness of the lambic, carbonated spice, and a very underlying hint of hops. What can I say that hasn't already been said? An exceptional combination brew, and one of the best I've ever had!"
"The beer pours a dark burgandy color with an ample white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has the traditional dark Belgian aroma; malts, spices, yeast, etc., but there is a lingering aroma of cherries added by combining a Tripel with a lambic, producing a Quad. The taste is brilliant. It is a strong beer, but you wouldn't know it. It has a dark feel to it. It tastes like the regular Ommegang, but with a nice cherry aftertaste that really compliments the flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with low carbonation, which suits it perfect. This is a great beer. It drinks well. I wish it wasn't a seasonal brew."
"Unbelievable, they say it couldn't be done. But it was. I tasted both the lambic and the belguim ale, and they mixed well. Two for one. Dark and carbonated, fruity, yet dry. I had so many great tastes in my mouth I felt like I never tried beer before. And one bottle, 750ml, will do you. Any more and lights out. A perfect feeling."
"Three Philosophers pours a rich and cloudy brown with a nice size tan head with fantastic lacing. The smell of cherries and sweet malts dominate. The taste is unbelievably complex, rich and full bodied with a distinct cherry finish. This brew masks its alcohol content incredibly well, so much so I could drink it all day."
"Nice lingering cherry finish. Srong malt, candi sugar and burnt fruit flavors. Exceptional creation in brewing, seek this one out if youre a Belgian lover."
"Very smooth mouthfeel. The malt and cherries rode the tongue after swallowing for a short time. A slow drinking ale."
"Nice white head subsides to a reddish amber colored liquid that is redolent of dark, berry filled forests and pathways strewn with mulch and wildflowers. As far as fruit flavored brews are concerned, this stuff blows away that insipid Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic that I tried last week. (Just thought I'd add that bit.) An interesting and very nice beer indeed."
"I could drink this stuff for hours and hours. I'd be really toasted by the end of the evening, but quite happy."
"Simply, it's as interesting as the name would suggest. Sweetness, tartness, and tanginess are all well-represented here, and to top it all off, you could even call it savory. The ABV glows more than genuinely impacts, but it's there and it does its work well and fully. I have another bottle I'd like to age, but, as is, this beer challenges the palate and then rewards the effort, making it drinkable and enjoyable. Though, of course, moderation is the watchword in this instance."
"An excellent offering from Ommegang, and the price is right too. Will pick up another bottle or two to cellar."
"Opened up a 750mL bottle last night as my brother and I enjoyed this great beer. The color was a rusty copper. Carbonation was perfect in my opinion. Medium head with lacing around the beer till the very end. The smell was dominated with various fruits, but mostly consisted of raisins that I tasted while sipping this beer. The aftertaste was quite unique. First, a fruity burst of flavor then you can taste the alcohol at the very end. But the fruit taste did hide the alcohol aftertaste somewhat. A very tasty beer. I would recommend it."
"The flavor is reflective of the aroma with a spicy and nutty large chocolate cherry followup before a cinnamon break leads to a long warming draw of the 9.8% alcohol."
"Poured a light brown with very red highlights when I expected closely. Minimal head and lace. Taste is great, cherry flavor comes through dark malt but the tartness is cut and the cherry flavor is not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is great and carbonation is just right. As the beer warms the complexity begisn to more pronounced with some more citrus aromas and dark fruit tastes coming out. The finish is just a touch dry and spicy. Overall a very complex and beautiful beer, need to drink several to appreciate the full complexity."
"Ommegang never ceases to amaze me. Pours a dark brown with a lacy whitish-tan head. Smell is medicinal, slightly alcoholic, sweet malt. Very smooth and inviting mouthfeel. Tastes like exactly what it is: a blend between kriek lambic and Ommegang, but weighs more heavily towards Ommegang than the lambic. Herbal, with heavy sweet malts, fairly alcoholic, with some bitter cherries. This is a fantastic brew - perfect for a cold winter's night."
"The taste is something to behold. A beautiful marriage of dark cherry and belgian brown ale that twists and turns over the tounge. Lots of fruity spice up front with a full bodied semi-sweet middle. The ending has a peak of medicinal flavor but it subtly ebbs in to a nice spicy/peppery finish. Drinks silky smooth for such a lively brew. Someone is doing something right at this brewery."
"Bottle label scheme from West Coast is quite different than the current white label scheme on the East. Pours a complicated caramel color with a thin head. Aromas strongly of sweet plum and raisins. The first taste is strongly of caramel and plum with undertones of currant and a hint of bitter chocolate. Throat warming finish with a moderate bitterness carried by a sharper, but heavy body. Very complex and full of flavor."
"This unique ale pours a ruby-tinged cordovan with a thick and foamy beige head. The aroma is heavy on the fruit, with cherries, apples and citrusy notes dominant and malt, hops and rummy alcohol working their way in. Sweet caramel malt, jarred cherries, orange zest and brandied raisins are all quite strong tasting. Peppery spices, cloves, lemon, rum and a bit of astringent camphor enter the mix. The hops are present but almost completely nondescript due to the overwhelmingly power of the Lambic, sweet malt and alcohol. A most curious taste is the lingering essence of Smith Brothers® Cherry Cough Drops. This could have been a top 10 contender had it contained a little less sweet fruity flavor and a bit more hoppy bitterness."
"Poured out of the bottle and into the glass with a long-lasting head, medium tan in color that settled over lightly hazy deep ruby red liquid. The nose is heavy on fruit, cherries most dominant, mellow and inviting to the senses. The taste is semi-dry cherry, light maltiness, a great hoppiness and perfectly potent alcohol flavors, each melding wonderfully each other. Pleasantly bitter without the sometimes cloying malt sweetness sometimes associated with this style of ale. Finshes on a almondy-dry bitterness and a palate teasing dance between the sweet and the bitter, cherry notes abound throughout the taste...a wonderful, wonderful ale, buy 2 bottles if you see it, one to drink now and throw the other one in the cellar for a spell!"
"This beer was quite complex. Chilled, it is not very good. As it warms up, it becomes much more pleasant. It tastes good at first, but it has something in the aftertaste which is quite off-putting. I cannot tell what that is. I am very curious what the underlying beer mixed with the lambic is. I love lambic, and I enjoy the one they used. I may or may not like the underlying ale. I may just not like the combination. The flavors didn't seem to complement each other. This is worth the try, but I will not be having this again."
"Enjoy!"
"To begin, this is the most incredible looking beer I've seen. It pours a deep ruby red with a beautiful frothy smooth head, with light draping lace. The bubbles stream up from the side of the glass, reminiscent of champagne, and the minute specks of sediment float in stasis. The smell is very fruity, with cherry, apple, and fig immediately evident. The fruity smell is underscored by the smell of alcohol which is a bit overbearing. The flavor of fruit is mirrored from the smell, but it is more mellow, beneath layers of toasted malt, hops and the everpresent alcohol. The mouthfeel is probably too smooth and pleasant for its own good, enticing the drinker to drink more, quickly, creating possible problems with overintoxication. Served from a jeroboam (3 liter)."
"This was an really interesting beer. Started off too cold so I let it sit around for a while before tasting it to let it warm up. When cold, it's a bit thin and bitter, but when it warmed up, it became much more complex. Nicely spicy/yeasty and a really full cherry nose. Tartness from the kriek lambic it was mixed with was mild and only came through when warmed to the point where it should have been served. Easily drinkable and quite tasty."
"Backwash: A more fair comparison will have to come when the WL has more age, but for now I’ll have to go with the “original.” A very impressive beer that vaults to the top of my list, and a great value as well. I hope the WL improves to this level, because I'd love to have it regularly. I also tried an “old” 3P after trying a Terrible, and this blew it away. Although similar in style, 3P was much more complex (even the WL), with much better integration of alcohol. Perhaps the Terrible will improve with age, but for now, it pales in comparison."
"Wow - if you're sitting here reading reviews, you're not out buying Three Philosophers, which is what anyone who appreciates good beer should be doing. It most strongly reminds me of port with its rich, mellowing, dark flavor. The addition of Lindemans' Kriek adds another level of complexity to an already tasty quadrupel - yielding dark cherry and green apple flavors among others. As the bottle indicates, it should be served slightly chilled. The alcohol is well hidden in the mix, and as a drink at winter time there's little that can beat it."
"Complex and deep, but nonetheless and pleasure to drink. The alcohol presence is most difficult to detect, while its fruity and vinous characteristics at this point in its life keep in all in check. One of Ommegang's finest creations, this should continue to mature and develop as both time and production of this beer increases. Great stuff."
"I think you probably have to drink an entire 750 to truly appreciate this beer. The foremost quality of Three Philosophers can best be described as tart and dry. I never realized that this beer included a few shots of cherry lambic, but thank goodness it does, for this is definitely what I'd consider a quadrupel golden boy. The label says that it ""inspires your mind"" and it really does... quite the vehicle for a fantastic voyage."
"Now cherry aromas are nice and amber color is good, but what gets me about this beer is the taste. I have loved this medium body beer since the first time I've tried it. It's one of the few beers my wife, who is not a beer lover, said that she would be able to drink a whole glass of. I love the way the malt flavor mingles with chocolate and licorace overtones. It is such a beautiful, well crafted beer, I figured that it should be the first beer I rate."
"2003 version here,pours a nice chesnut brown with a real creamy head that lleaves very nice lacing,aroma ismalty sweet with a slight spicey note with candied sugar very evident.A very nice rounded beer taste wise softly sweet with some spicieness with the cherry taste that lingers in the background,wow what a great tasting beer!I could drink this pretty potent brew all night!"
"This is quite possibly my new favorite from Ommegang. Good job guys!"
"Sampled during the Three Philosophers release party at the Blue Tusk. Small, solid, tan head left a small amount of lacing. Dark burgundy colored liquid lets just enough light through to glow. The aroma is rich with hints of dark ripe plums and cherries along with some acohol, and a banana mellowness. Smooth malty taste with a pinch of dark frout and spices. Mouthfeel is bullay and alcoholic. The dry aftertaste leaves you with a warm stomach. Overall impression is of a young and alcoholic beer. Supposedly some will be sent to the Howe Caverns for aging in the next few months."
"This beer pours a deep cherry red in color. A thick, tight slightly off white (with a red tint) head sits on top my glass. Aromas are of cherry, oak, and yeast. Hints of the Lambic are present through this brew. Flavor is a rush of different things. Malt sweetness then an aged wood/oak tones, musty yeast with a tart cherry finish in the end. At no time could you notice the 9.8 that this brew has. It has a smooth creamy mouthfeel and is enjoyable to drink on a cold winter's night. Another outstanding brew from Ommegang."
"Wow!!! Really a work of art. Omengang has really outdone themselves with this brew. Its a shame its not a year round beer. Whats even worse. I cant find this beer anywhere in stores. I might have to take a pilgrimage to cooperstown soon."
"Drinkability: Rather drinkable. I was reminded at times of a sour Maudite. Can't wait for the wide release version to make it's way down here."
"Abundant gratitude to purplehops for breaking this out of his cellar for me...it was magnificent!"
"Notes: Drop dead in complexity, a sipping brew and certainly something you would want to pair with rather than drinking it alone. I varied my pairings from a creamy Danish Blue Cheese with water crackers to dark chocolate."
"Winner of the Brew your dream beer contest. Dark brown color, smallish head, lacy with some arabesques. Figs and apricots in the nose. Very complex flavors. Malts, spices, figs, earthy and fruity. Well balanced. Very smooth taste, a slightly alcohol bite at 9.8%. Great mix of complex subtle flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and smooth. Finish is very clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sweet. WOW. Great beer from a great brewery. Please make more of this."
"If I close my eyes and not read the label, I would swear this is a very fine Belgian. I let the second one age several months and it was more along the fruit profile. Still tasty."
"This beer poured a dark ruby/mahogany color that was cloudy in appearance. The head that was produced was minimal and short lived, just a thin covering that was tan/beige colored. No lace. The aromas were intense and bold! Smells of bourbon, port wine, wooden aging barrels, big dark fruits (raisins, plums, black cherries), sweet dark caramel malts, and alcohol. After I took my first of many whiffs I hoped that the flavors would and had to be as good as the nose. And they absolutely were. Tastes of rich dark sweet malts, dark fruits, fruits macerated in alcohol, port wine and the barrels that they were aged in, caramel, spice (hints), alcohol and a wisp of granny smith apple tartness at the end. Aftertaste was filled with port wine and fruit. Heavy bodied, and thick. Big complex flavors that are rich and heavenly and the warmth from the alcohol were truly inviting. Wow what a beer truly amazing how all the flavors compliment each other so well. Glad I had the chance to experience it, several times in one day."
"guys are playing on the same level as Unibroue 11 which is available in B.C. This beer came from a buying trip to Portland."
"This brew pours a small head of light brown moslty lasting bubbles and a brown colored body. It had a strong bubblegum and alcohol aroma with an overpowering alcohol flavor. THe alcohol flavor was so strong I couldn't get passed it to any of the other flavors than may have been present."
"Overall an interesting and complex offering from Ommegang. Would one expect less? This is a special occasion beer that should cellar nicely and bring joy and warmth for years to come. The best part is that it is to become a regular part of the brewery line up instead of a specialty product. Thank you Mr. Duvel."
"Thank you cokes for expanding my philosophical horizons with a little Plato, a little Socrates and a little Aristotle."
"Origianlly reviewed 26 January 2003. Copper/red color w/ a thick tan head. Lots of banana in the nose. The taste has Lots of complex fruits: plums, apples & others. A slightly sweet malty finish makes this an all around world class beer. I wish that this was more readily available."
"Pours a lightly hazed dark brown tea color with a modest light tan head that disappears rapidly. The sweet smell of mixed fruit but predominantly raisons and light alcohol notes make up the aroma of this brew. A repeat in the taste of what made up the aroma along with a chocolate covered raison being the dominant flavor along with a light bitter and again alcohol notes. This light bodied brew is just a tad under hopped IMO, but it does go down surprisingly easy. Another solid beer from this brewery. Thanks once again for the chance to experience this McCall! Cheers!"
"3.)	Thoreau for the essence of a pond"
"After having visited the brewery and actually reading the essay that was the inspiration for this beer I was ready to get the taste poetry in motion as it were. The philosopher poured a deep, foggy mahogony with a tan/yellow head which dissapeared quicker than most Belgians I have tried. The lace was real clingy and looked good on the cup. Several strong sweet aromas came out almost immediatly. There were cherry, raisen and maple which abounded in the nose. The taste was distinct with some notes of bannana mixed with honey, figs, pears and cloves. They tour guide at the brewery said Ommegang uses none of the spices that it adds to its other beers. I sm still a tad sceptical, but if it is true then this is truly a triumph of a beer."
"Sweet floral yeasty nose. Cherry color to the brew with a nice white lace that becomes your following friend. Sweet strong sour plum taste with banana chips and a citrus bite in the finish. Fuller mouth. A very complex beer with lots of stuff going on in there. The plum and banana chip taste really swirls in there. It's bold sweetness and tastes make this a sippin' brew that should improve with maturity."
"I bought this a year ago. It's been aging in the cellar, and I thought it was time to give the beer a try. Very dark brown color with moderate carbonation. The head is a tan color, but is very short-lived. I love the aroma: very strong fruit overtones....raisins, plums, apple. Intensely fruity and sweet smell, with a lot of alcohol as well. Taste is very malty with a jagged graininess. Peppery and fruity. Alcohol warming is predominant. Medium body, and very drinkable. I admit that I had higher hopes, but this is still a very nice beer."
"Poured a dark amber and mostly cloudy. Head dissipated fairly quickly; this beer has very little carbonation by design. Smelled and tasted of all the fruits mentioned on the label, particularly raisins and apricots. The sweetness is much more prominent than the alcohol, which you can definitely feel coursing through your veins after a full glass. This is a very good strong beer thats surprisingly drinkable."
"750ml bottle, corked and caged. A carefull pour renders a clear, reddish-brown body with crimson and orange highlights. An off-white, creamy but short-lived head leaves only very minor lace (possibly due to the high level of alcohol, or maybe the need for some more conditioning). The nose displays dark fruit (raisins, fig) and some alcohol. The medium body is lightened by a moderate, but still gently effervescent (very fine bubbled), carbonation. True to the description on the label, the flavor is rich with raisins and pears; as well as some apricot and slightly tart apple. It's mildly sweet maltiness also lends a nutty quality (hazelnut?) that becomes more obvious in the finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but far from intrusive. It finishes dry with some residual sweet fruity malt. Quite enjoyable. Worth trying."
"The '03 is much niceer than I remember last year's being. It has a nice backround of cherries that really add complexity and take away from the alcohol flavoring."
"I waited for the right moment to share this 1 pint 9.4 fl. oz. bottle of Ommegang ""Three Philosophers"" with my wife and son on another cold night this winter. We drank the ale at slightly under room temperature (maybe 60 degrees). The ale poured in an initially deep, almost blood, red, but the later pours were significantly cloudier due to much evident sediment. The foam was a light caramel color, which sustained a good body for much of the drink. This ale clearly signifies its high alcohol content (9.8%) on first smell--almost like wine. Anyhow, there is also a sweet aroma, but that sweetness is not at all evident by taste--the alcohol definitely overpowers most everything else--not something I am fond of, frankly. If you want to warm up quickly, this is the brew, but the taste is not quite up with the best of them."
"Nice big tan head and nice deep brown cloudy color. It had a very yeasty and sweet nose of dried raisens and fruits. It was strong but not in offensively. You could really tell difference from regular Ommegang in regards to alchohol strength. Had sweet malty, carmel and prune flavors from start to finish. Overall I liked but prefer Ommegang regular over this."
"This was definitely a strong beer. Not so much in alcohol but in taste. Very complex with a mixture of dates, raisins and figs with a touch of bubble gum. Scent was raisin/caramel. Nice deep dark color. Would not be able to drink a ton but good for a glass or two. Became better after a few sips but I would not suggest it warm/room temperature. A nice beer to cellar."
"135"
"If you get the chance to try/buy this, do so."
"Aroma: Black cherries, plums, dried currants/raisins, alcohol. In three words: Ximinez Sherry Lite. Flavor: Very big - the aforementioned fruits along with some Belgian yeast flavors, a hint of bitter chocolate and oak(?), with the alcohol present in proportion. Warms you to the soul going down. Very complex and delicious. This brew made me want to have an oxblood red reading chair in a dark panelled library - that is the kind of flavor it seemed to have."
"Matt, I think the style catagory is spot on."
"Man I love my job :-)"
