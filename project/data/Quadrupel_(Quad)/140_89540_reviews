"I enjoyed this one, kinda hard to find good quads out there and this one was a decent example. My only complaints for this one are that the alcohol wasn't as balanced as I would have liked and I'm not sure why SN felt it necessary to add plums to a quad :/"
""
"not wat i was hoping for. Tasted dry"
"Overall, this is a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a very fruit forward quad, but the dark and chocolate malts actually maintain a great balance with the fruit and provide a pretty awesome drinking experience."
""
""
"O: I really like this, very balanced, it has that classic quad Belgian flavors but it is enhanced with a nice plum, dark fruit sweetness, warms up really well, alcohol is hidden pretty good, definitely going to pick up another four-pack."
""
"Deep dark brown in color with minimal head. Smell is dominated by molasses, vanilla, and plum with a minor bit of bananas, and bread.  Taste is similar to the smell with fruit, sugar and roasted notes but has a hoppy finish.  Mouthful is heavier with no carbonation.  A nice American quad but their are better choices out available."
""
""
""
"O: A beer that is among the best US-made quads but really can't compete with the elite belgian ones like Rochefort/Bernardus/Van De Kaiser/Westvleteren.  Straddles the line a bit between quad and belgian stout."
""
""
"delicious candied plum with dark sugar and bready yeast delicious beer all around fantastically done."
""
""
""
"O: overall outstanding, a real treat!"
""
""
""
""
"delicious. My kind of quad. Love the sweetness of the plums and the booziness. Can't wait to see how this develops. To me, a total bargain..corked and caged 12 oz bottles for around 3 bucks per?"

"(Preface: learning to taste. No where near an expert). I poured it into a chalice and it had very little head. It looks to be about a 36 on the SRM. Held up to the light, nothing comes through. After agitation, you definitely get the sweetness of the plum. For taste, I am getting some sweet, maltiness, and some mild bitterness."
""
"Served in an Oversized Wine glass"
""
""
"Picked this up and tasted on 3-4-15.  Pours a very dark brown/red.  Can pick up the plum on the nose.  Taste is very nice!  Can pick up the plum influence, but it does not overpower or dominate.  Extremely smooth finish.  No hint whatsoever that this is a 10.2% alcohol.  Would highly recommend."
"Complex in flavor, yet it seems to become simpler as the glass goes on.  Nice flavor balance.  Nice carbonation.  Nicely done."
"Comes across more as a Belgian quad leaning toward barleywine qualities. The sweet elements of plum, dates and banana combined with mild alcohol heat without the latent ashiness of most Belgian styles hit the spot for me.  One of those ""tastes twice as good when half finished"" brews...dig."
""
""

"A well done Quad, great mix of flavors."

"Amazing beer. The smell is hypnotizing. Taste is even better."

"Overall- A well done, spot on quad. Also love the fact that SN did it with a legit Belgian collaboration, and it is a one time offering which adds to the uniqueness. The plums set this one apart as it adds layers of sweet complexity. Yeast tasted like those of similar Belgian greats. Excellent all the way through."

""
"Great ale with smooth hints of plums"

"O:This is a pleasant, albeit somewhat strange beer and I would say that serving it just to the left of cold would work just as well as serving it could. It leaves a warm burn in the stomach and a sweet taste on the tongue, if this is to be your first foray into quad territory better go with St. Bernardus Abt. 12 instead, there really is no good place to start with this kind of beer so that is as good as any. this is good beer and an interesting beer, take time to enjoy it and the experience will be better for you."

"02/06/14 From bottle at RAttle n HUm, NYC. This is a superior brew...but if your not a fan of raisins or plums or prunes, stand back. Great taste. Complex . It makes you think of foreign lands but one need not be too adventerous to appreciate this offering. Do it! You will not be sorry. BTW it's 10%+ so be aware."

"O: I really like this style, and its well done by Sierra Nevada. Yes, it has the plum theme all the way through. Drank at Turkey Creek Rd, Clyde NC June 28 2014 my daughter’s 2nd birthday."

"Final Word: Unfortunately, the strong alcohol presence got in the way of the other flavors in this beer, and made the experience feel lopsided. While the black liquorice, spice, dark fruit, dark sugar and chocolate flavors could have created a nuanced drink, they felt as if they were crushed and compacted under the weight of the alcohol flavor. Had they been allowed to bloom and expand, this beer would have been very complex and satisfying, but instead it felt like every sip was dominated by booze. It was as if each sip had a 50/50 blend of alcohol flavor and ONE random flavor contained within the beer. You’d get a hint of raisin in one sip, but get only black liquorice in the next, and the flavors never seemed to mingle. The potential here was great, but the experience felt like a missed opportunity. Still some good flavors in here, but the profile is much too alcoholic for the subtle flavors within, even for a Quad."
""
"Excellent Abbey style quad from Sierra Nevada. Pours a dark roasted brown with a tannish brown off white head that gives a Guinness cascade when poured with a slowly dissipating head that leaves a thin tight beaded head that lightly clings to the glass. Smell of chocolate, dark plums, tart cherry, and astringent grains. Taste is of dark berries, cherries, raisins, plums and dark malt rounded by Belgian candy sugar. Aftertaste is pleasant with dark chocolate and dark fruits and a slight herbal note, yeast flavor is hard to find with everything else going on, which is a LOT----especially as it warms. Silky smooth mouthfeel and VERY deceptive of the alcohol. Another APLUS from Sierra Nevada brewing, a favorite I have had many times in bottle, but could not pass up the chance to have on draft. As a side note, I noticed a different head and more subtle flavors from tap than bottle....for what it's worth. Try it! Cheers."
"Overall: a good and strong quad. Be prepared for some strong and hot alcohol though."
""
""
"Bottle code translates to 1/8/13 bottle date. Dark brown cola-colored pour. 1/2 finger tan head dissipated relatively quickly. Smell is booze, fruity sweetness & moderate yeast. Taste is decent fruitiness up front (from the plums?) with yeast esters. Pleasantly sweet. Finish yields more yeast esters along with slight bitterness. It isn't as complex as your ideal quads but I think the plums add another level of sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat creamy but also slightly on the thin side. Overall I like it. It isn't the best quad ever but it's got enough yeast and the plums add some fruitiness that make it interesting."

"This Quad definitely caught my eye the first time I saw it. Even the appearance of the bottle itself was appealing to me. I absolutely loved the artwork on the label and the cork on top is such a great touch! The Beer itself has a thick dark appearance with a tan, fizzy head when poured. Nothing crazy but still looks satisfying and has a wonderful smell. The first inhale I took I was hit by a rich chocolaty scent with a slight undertone of plum finishing out with a smooth hint of sourness. Leading into my first taste I was definitely hit by the bold fruit flavor and velvety smooth finish. It was rich and round with hints of fig, chocolate and spice. I loved this beer! A true standout from other Belgian-Style Quads I've had."
""
""
"I have had this beer a few times and realized I had not reviewed it yet, so stuck one in the fridge and here we go. Beautiful beer, thick and dark on the pour and then thick enough appearance to get me salivating. The smell is also awesome, not super strong but clean and no obvious alcohol despite the over 10%. The taste is very good and gets even better and smoother as it warms, take your time and enjoy sipping on this one. Overall it gets bonus points for both value, $15 a four pack I believe, and for the ABV which does not come on strong. Also, the corked 12 oz bottles are unique and cool."
""
""
""
"Overall - A really nice, balanced attack of sweet and bitter, with loads of complex flavors. A big beer with alcohol warmth from the first sip. Really enjoy the big plum flavor mixed with the other dark fruits. A real winner here, cant wait to try a aged bottle."
""
""
""
"O - As I mentioned above, I'm sure this was a lot better when it was fresh. With it being a Quad, I didn't feel the need to drink it right away and figured it may benefit from some down time. I have two of these left and I want to try one soon to se if this may be a bad bottle."
"Price Point - $3/12 oz single"
""
"A nice interpretation of a quad from SN, but not up to level of the classics."
""
""
""
"A very nice, smooth and tasty dark ale. New aspects of flavor and feel come out with every sip and all are enjoyable. Subtle, deep and a real pleasure to savor."
""
""
""
""
"The body is full, almost thick without being too syrupy as a dryness opens it up and crispness keeps it moving and biting. There's a light acidity, and the alcohol's effect on the body keeps it from doing too much rather than detracting from it."
"I usually reserve my St. Bernardus chalice, gifted to me during my only visit to Brawley's in Charlotte, NC, several years ago for special treats, of which I am hoping the Ovila Abbey Quad is one. Opens up with a light pop, as the cork is freed from the wire cage and extracted. The carbonation is light, and the beer pours very dark brown, looking like a thick cola. The smell is filled with cherry, plum, and other dark skinned fruit. There is a touch of hops upon deeper inspection of the smell. The taste has more of a brown sugar, than a dark fruit type sweetness, with sour notes becoming more noticeable mid palette, before being swept aside by the alcohol warmth. Some dark chocolate presence in the finish. If I have a fault to pick, it is the thinness of the body. It does not quite seem up to the velvet like feel of others in the style. I like the Ovila Quad for what it is, but I think the Ovila Saison is better."

"A good Quad, the plums give a great taste and color for the beer"
""
"Taste is very balanced. Early, dark fruit, spice and on the sweet side. This beer is very enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black in color with a thin beige head that leaves some streaky lacing when sipped. The aroma is very pleasant of sweet dark fruits, brown sugar and roasted malts. The taste is...FANTASTIC with a lot going on! ALL the flavors mentioned above coming through with more taste as well of some caramel malts. Really great flavor with no bitter aftertaste and goes down easy. By far the BEST Sierra Nevada brew I had."

"Overall this was well worth the price of admission and I could see purchasing a four pack for around 15 bucks (works out to a 7.50 bomber) Tasty stuff."

"Overall, a very tasty quad and one that's great to pair with food, but as noted previously, it's not very complex, which is typically a hallmark of this style. I can't help but feel as if the plums are crowding out everything else that might be going on here, but what can I say--I enjoyed the beer."
""
"This Beer is excellent. A fruity treat for dark beer lovers. I work at a Liquor store and traveled to another store before we got it in. highly recommended and a great fun story behind the beer. smells great, looks great taste great. was expecting more mouthfeel due to the color and smell. still was not a disappointment. My new Wow beer for sure. Excited to hear what others think. Also had the Saision and it was Excellent."
"Plums are definitely showing through here. Kind of presents a sweet and somewhat thicker drinking experience. Could be toned down a bit on the plums, and the sweetness. But it works pretty much. Smooth feel. A pretty decent quad. Too sweet for me to go back to. But it’s pretty good as it is."
""

"It is a very heavy beer at 10.2% ABV, it packs a punch which is best followed up by a glass of water and another beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark body in the chalice with ruby highlights, looks great big head tan colored rolling with fine bubbles it looks great. Aroma deep dark fruits of course with the plums added the tart ripened fruit holds over other notes. Flavor dark fruit again the plums are added to bring out raisin tart dark fruit with alcoholic notes more and more big fruit flavors with each sip this stuff is excellent, Belgian style with the higher carbonation it carries it all very well. Each sip brings out chocolate malt with high end spectrum dark fruits a mixture of dry and sweet malts add to the balance. This is a big calorie big flavored beer mouthfeel is medium to full even flowing carbonation residual sugars lie down for me. Overall it's a big beer meant to be enjoyed by the masses."
""
"An excellent quad. Love the addition of plums."
""
"Overall, while this quad is a bit messy, I enjoy the plum flavor. I'm not sure if I'd try any of the other SN Ovila line, but I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"o: Really good stuff, much better than the saison."
""
"Overall: I have not been this pleasantly surprised with a beer in a long time. At least with others that I've bought on a whim lately, there was a description of what to expect. Here... I didn't even look it up on BA or have anything to go off of other than the bottle's description. I am so glad I bought this - I suspect I may buy another 4 pack to age!"
""
"The taste has many of the same attributes as the aroma with a notable sweetness followed by a notable, sinus-clearing, bitterness. It is also on the dry side."
"I bought the latest release of this beer about 5-6 weeks ago, and it is a wonderful, full bodied Quad. I didn't think I was going to like it when I saw ""PLUMS", but it one of the better quads I have experienced. I have currently put a 4-pack back for aging and look forward to how it will mature over a year or two.I'll get back to you on that."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd argue that this holds its own against other quads, but it may have a bit more astringency than the best of the best. Still,very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is one of the more enjoyable Quads I've had to date. Really liked it and would pick up again, especially for the price."
""
""

"A very interesting take on a Belgian quad. Pours a very murky, imposing dark brown/black, very little head and almost no head retention. Smells of dark fruits, plums, dried black raspberry, some of the spiciness from the yeast comes through. Taste follows suit, tons of dark fruits and floral/spicy yeast. Mouthfeel is superb, extremely smooth with a great finish. This is closer to a good Syrah than to most beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Westy chalice a very nice grapey color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some very nice thick sticky lacing with some nice big oil slicks. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, plums, grapes, raisins, figs. The taste is malty, yeasty, with lot's of dark fruits. Medium body, ABV is hidden very well with this one. Overall a pleasure to drink, surprised to see this one in Utah."
"This is big and rich. Definitely a slower drinker and a 12 oz is the right size, especially if I don't add any food to the experience. Not great but really solid. Would have like more plum in the flavor but is was a nice addition to the aroma."
""
""
""
"All in all, a very enjoyable experience and a great sipping brew. I was expecting more plum very but I find I'm enjoying the subtlety here,. Quite nice. It would be interesting to age a couple of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps the plums add additional sugars that amp up the ABV and therefore cause the boozy face of this ale. The plums really make this but on the other hand may be its deterrent too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall a great rich fruity Quad. Solid."
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, but not quite as complex or nuanced as I would like a quad to be. Hopefully some age will mellow the booziness and promote the development of some different malt flavors."
"O - A very nice offering by Sierra Nevada in collaboration with Abbey of New Clairvaux. Solid Quad worth seeking out if you like this style. Only complaint is I wish the finish did not mess with my palate so much, other then that its a winner, cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great! The drink looks so deep and inviting. The smell is pretty good, but rather simple; mainly a roasted malt and coffee hint. The taste has more components. The best to me was the chocolate. It had a delicious, creamy chocolate taste. The alcohol is certainly noticeable, but not over the top for this ABV. All around, this is one to get and try. I would get it again."
"Overall / Drinkability: I don't know if this was supposed to have yeast sediment in it or not, but when I pulled the cork and there was practically no noise I was concerned that something was off with this bottle. No bad tastes, but I wonder if something is missing in this beer given that I'm not picking up the aromas as described on the bottle. Tasty, but not an amazing quad. If there are plums in this, they are well hidden. For the price I cannot see getting it again when there are better quads available."
""
""
""
"O - I am glad I got my hands on this before my local liquor stores ran out of it as it seems to be in low quantity and high demand. If I can grab another 4 pack I will and I suggest you do the same if you enjoy dark Belgian ales."

"O- Not a bad beer, but again this is a very mild quad. Plums work in the beer and are enjoyable. I like a lot of beers from Sierra Nevada, but this is one the few I wouldn't pick up again."
"O: A nice American interpretation of a quad and an enjoyable brew but not my favorite of the group."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't mean to totally rip apart this beer but I am disappointed in it both as a quad and as a Sierra Nevada product. SN offerings are usually top notch. Perhaps if it was labeled as a Belgian strong ale or something else, it would have been more successful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is some odd flavors going on. Definitely a unique Quad...or beer for that matter. Grapes and cherries seemed to dominate the fruit profile especially when warm. There was a burnt charred character running through the entire beer and the heavy handed alcohol seemed to disrupt rather than add to the flavors. Not my cup of tea."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I am very partial to this style so I tend to rate this type of beer highly. But this is a really great American made Quad. Thank you Sierra Nevada for this wonderful beer at such a great price. I would compare this to Abt 12 or Chimay blue. If you can get a hold of this one give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
""

"Mwdi"
"With all that sugar plum talk dancing in my head, its easy to become seduced by the ale's clean fruit/spice balance and its hearty malt sweetness. But comparing it to more authentic Belgian versions, its easy to see that this much more simplistic ale not only lacks the much needed complexity it also doesn't allow for the drier drinkability to emerge which would facilitate a much more palatable and Belgian-esque digestible quality."
"Drinkability- I thought this was very good. We should have bought some at the gift shop but we didn't. I would love to drink it again."
""
""
"what i love about sierra nevada is not just how good this beer is, but the fact that it is on shelves for $2.99, a steal at any rate, but for a beer this strong and this good, its insane. rich mahogany body to this and not much head in my globe. the nose is amazing though, i get more cherries than plums, but a definite dark fruit element stands strong among the grain trees here, sweet and a little spicy, quintessentially belgian. the fruit is there in the taste too, which is layered and huge, but not hot. it ins some ways reminds me of life and limb, that different sort of sugar additive, birch syrup or something, earthy and stately, really delicious, and a great compliment to the plums and the yeast. its a long flavorful experience driven by rich grain and semisweet under ripe plums. one of the best quads ive had honestly, and the fact that it was so affordable makes me want to go out and buy up all i can find. really big body and not much carbonation here, it really isnt needed or missed, as the flavors carry themselves just fine in its absence. top quality quad packed with flavor. a real generous gift to the beer community this one. thank you for it sierra nevada."
"Pleasant though a bit light for the style. That being fruity and some caramel vs. more chocolate in nature. Still better than those raisan infused beers nonetheless. At the same time I think this is a step back from the original yet an interesting aside."

"A solid American quad. The addition of sugar plums provides a pleasant sweetness."
""
"Overall pretty tasty, worth $11 for a 4 pack. Two more aging in the crawl space"
""
"O: This is a hearty and unique beer. The plums are a nice enhancement of the richness within the beer itself, but doesn't overpower. It is perfect cold night, sit by the fire and relax with friends and loved ones. With 10+ ABV, it's a sipping beer! Enjoy"

"Very solid beer that has improved even a bit more with a few months of age on it. I really like what Sierra Nevada is doing with these Ovila beers, both with the beers themselves and the backstory of helping the local monks with their abbey and perhaps eventual brewing. This particular beer definitely has gotten a bit plummier after a some months in the bottle, either from the fruit itself getting a bit more prominent, or the other constituent flavors mellowing a bit. Lots of juicy fruit on a fairly soft frame of malt and spice and a bit of tannin to help reign it in. The finish is long and has a touch of sweetness and then a long spice note. Very balanced and very pleasant!"

"375 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 2/7/2013. Pours hazy nearly opaque reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, plum, prune, banana, clove, pepper, toast, dark bread, molasses, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, plum, and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, banana, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, molasses, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, toast, dark bread, clove, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy esters; with good plum flavor presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice quadrupel style. All around good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and plum flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Tastes a bit like cough medicine. Weird sweetness overpowers the malt and the carbonation and it just seems like a slug of medicine every time you take a sip. A bit harsh, too. If you needed an excuse not to try American examples of Belgian styles, this is a good one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not that great. I was expecting a lot more here. I got it as an extra in my first trade. It's good but was a bit weird for a quad. It must be the plums. Not a big fan of the fruit, so it makes sense."
""
""
""
""
"T- Just doesn't have the wow factor I continue to look for in the U.S. made Belgian styles. Having said that, there isn't much wrong with it."
""
"T: I like it overall, but I bought a beer not a Coke. Tasty, fairly complex, the plums come through well, but I wish that soft drink note weren't persistent throughout"

"This beer is quite a joy, i wish i didn't dink it so fast writing this review."
"O- This is a big hot (fusel) sweet monster that could really use some age, but no dates on the bottles. The fruity quality is nice but it can’t save the beer. It was a bit rough to slug through but perhaps it will be better in the bitter winter winds?"
"375 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a dark cola brown color with a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like plums, cherries, bready malt and a bit of molasses. It tastes like plums, bready malt, cloves, toffee, and some bananas, chocolate, and a slight medicinal taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew overall, but with that being said it's not one of the best Quads I've tried. Still, it's certainly worth trying. $3.79 for a single bottle."

"Poured at fridge temp into a Bernardus goblet. Little to no head at this temperature. Also, almost no yeast at bottom of bottle. Dark, impenetrable brown in color. I get sweet notes of coffee, chocolate and smoke both on the nose and on the tongue. Sweeter than I expected, similar to a St Bernardus. No bitterness and a front-tongue dry finish. Very little carbonation, again probably due to the low temperature. Warms nicely to a full bouquet, like I'd expect from an abbey-style quad. Very nice, buy again."
"Pours a kola hue with the creamiest two finger head that stays forever and clingy lacing all down the sides,the smell is caramel candy,booze,plums,toffee malts and raisin bread,the mouthfeel is just over medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of plum jam,port,toffee liqueur,marzipan,bready malts and finished with a sweet raisin booziness which is most noticeable on first sip and goes away after it warms you up and overall it's not a bad quad but I don't get much of the plums added and just tastes like a normal quad with nothing added but a nice winter warmer netherless just not a beer you would have to repeat to relive the taste."

"Overall: I tried this in January and thought it was very average (3). Different beer to me now and I think it should be up in the 4 range."

"3.8/5.00"

"O: its a very good beer with some wow factor but wont make you do cartwheels as there are other quads i prefer"
""
"A very solid and tasty quad. Looks good, although not a great head. Taste of raisins, plums, figs, and bread. Nicely balanced. Not the most full bodied but not too bad in that area. Enjoyable from the first taste to the end. You feel the booze by the end, but heck, that's a quad for you. I could definitely drink this again. I'd like to try some of the other collaborations of Ovila."

"D: This was a great brew, with complex and delicate scent and taste. The body was great, and the finish was smooth despite the noticeable alcohol. So it was pretty easy to drink, although I suspect it would mellow further if cellared for some years. I was surprised to enjoy this beer so much, even fresh."
""

"From a straight pour it’s purplish black like an eggplant with a soft full head of foam that fell fast but hugs the glass with soapy lace. Left a thin skin on top and has alcohol legs. Nose is really sweet and I’m immediately turned off. Big heavy malt, sugar, molasses and dough. Plums, more dark fruit sweetness and the subtlest of hop floral and spice underneath. Alcohol is peeking out. As it warms it opens up vinous and with some leather and tobacco . Taste is sweet and then some. Sugar, heavy and cloying. Plums are lost to the sugary sweetness and to the taste of prune. The malt is underplayed and could have used more roast, more toast, more depth and some biscuit. There was no hop presence to balance the sweetness and it was thick and syrupy. Yeast tries to offer up spice but is devoured by sugar. One dimensional. As it warmed it developed a bitterness from the alcohol. Without much carbonation the alcohol is fully on the palate and this hits the stomach like a big sweet donut. I could live without it."
"Overall: Awesome stuff. Will look for more of this in the future."
"Overall, a solid quad and one that a fan of the style should definitely try. This is a huge beer and you can definitely tell while tasting it. Newcomers should steer away as it could deter them from the style. But to me, this is just plain delicious."

"Overall, I didn't care for this. I remember it being fruitier with less off notes last I had it (still not great though)."
"rich chocolate malts, sweet dark fruits - plum, dried cherries, dates. Woody undertones, peppercorn, clove, cocoa, molasses, fruitcake. A bit dry in the finish. Dope label art and a nice price for the style - an impulse buy, and not one to be regretted"

"Taste: Complexity starts us off, a myriad of rich flavors at work. Plenty of the dark fruits, the raisins and plums, and the rich, sweet notes, with malt working wonders below it all. Damned tasty. Hits all the right notes, but misses some magic."
""
""
""
"Really thought the plum addition stepped up all the best parts about a quadruple. Good price point SN!"
""
""
""
""
"Not terrible, but the weird and vitamin-like aroma and flavor that seemed to cling alongside the plums was just too prevalent to be fully enjoyable. It masked what would otherwise be a solid Belgian-style quad and instead turned it into a forgettable, slightly better than average ale. Wasn't disappointed to have tried it, but I recommend passing it up, especially when options like Rochefort 10 and Abt 12 are readily available."

"I'm enjoying this beer very much, as the style is (still) a relatively rare find in my area . The complex flavors (and high ABV) promote slow sipping, and quiet contemplation, as personified by the hooded monk on the label."

"O- Not a bad quad. The flavors are there and the aroma is great, but I found this one a touch too hot, even for a quad."

"More carbonation, less sweetness, this needs a little pep in its step to set itself apart."

"12.7 ounce bottle poured in a tulip, 4 pack at $14.99. Amazing stuff. Aroma has a roasted character, raisin bread pudding is a good descriptor, malts and dried fruit blended in a complementary way. Appearance is a dark brown-red with decent lacing and lingering residue of foam on top. Taste is a dried fruit lineup of plums, figs & raisins, very smooth despite the high abv, chocolate(?), orange zest. The main theme I picked up is that it’s all really well integrated. The wide array of roasted, citrus and dried fruit flavors work together. Palate is lively, sizzling in carbonation, medium bodied, long lasting flavor presence. Overall, this stuff is a good deal for the money and one of the few Belgian-style beers I’ve had in recent memory that’s highly recommendable."

"update 5/9/14 - chatting with my bro about this hard-to-find favorite of mine, realized it still had no image. not the best, it's a pic from my phone from last year, but i wanted to show the label because i absolutely love the look, and it has brethren with similar names but different styles/labels, wanted to help avoid confusion. cheers!"
""

"This is a decent beer, but definitely an American version of a Quad. Missing some of the best elements that make Belgian Quads so complex and tasty. It was a little sweet as it warmed up, but a very tasty beer that's worth checking out."
""

""
""
"Overall about what I expected. Not in the league of Rochefort 10 or St. Berndardus 12, but the plum gives this beer a unique twist."
"O : Probably will not drink again, had it on draft last week and then bottled. I generally like most Belgians and big beers but this one had a very astringent and bitter lingering taste that I found unpleasant. Worth trying because everyone has different taste but I will be moving on."
""
"O: A nice take on the base beer, with plenty of plum to be found in both aroma and taste. Reminds me of a Belgian winter beer with the spices and yeast. Good price point for a 4-pack as well at under $12"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark russet brown with red highlights at edges. Fine one finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Subdued aroma of dark fruit; particularly plums, grape juice, sweet malt. Flavor follows aroma with dark fruit, grapes, bready malt, the fresh plum flavor is remarkable. Of all that times I've used plums as a flavor ingredient in beer, this is the first time I got such a fresh, first bite plum flavor. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A bit reserved in flavor for a quad, but enough to well cover the ABV, and refreshing in the fresh plum component. I hope I can pick up another bottle of this."

"Overall, a decent quad but it falls short of some more notable Belgian examples. I don't feel the addition of plums is really that big a deal but still worth picking up if you come across it."
""
"Taste follows suit, tons of plums, currants, hints of vanilla. surprisingly little booze for the abv. Light, crisp, lots of carbonation. I enjoyed this a lot, but I don't really have much experience with quads to make a good judge on style. Slightly too sweet."

"Poured a rich, almost black color with a thin head that receded to a ring that left little lacing. It looked beautiful upon pouring. Scents of chocolate, plums and a slight hint of alcohol. The flavor has notes of chocolate, plum, prune, Belgian yeast, peppery hints and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly sticky, medium bodied, with a medium carbonation level. On par for the style. A very good American example of a quad. It's not quite up there with the St. Bernardus quad or Rochefort 10, but it's a definite improvement over the standard Ovila Quad and quite good."
""
"Tons of plums! This is a nice Quad that hides the alcohol well."
"Overall: A really tasty and unique take on the Quad style. Bigger dark brownish flavor than what is typical for the style which adds a nice spin. Solid yeast and dark fruit presence."
""
"Overall: Interesting take on a quad. Definitely deviates a bit from some of the more traditional options. The roasty and coffee flavors were a bit surprising, but they worked well with the other flavors. Worth picking up a bottle or two."

"Beer poured dark brown with red hue. Pretty body, but poor head/head retention. Thin lacing sticks to the rim of the beer. Head kind of ruins the appearance of this beer. Beer has a rich nose of plums, molasses and a little cherry. Also some earthy notes, but those don't stand out much. Flavor is very sweet, even for a quad. I think the plums move the sweetness to the next level, and it's a little overwhelming. I taste high acidity, which hurts the balance of the beer. Flavors of tasted oats, smoke, tree bark, sweet berries, and of course plums. The body is nice and typical of the style. A little high on the carbonation. Overall, I like the beer. Drinkable, interesting, and a good example of a quad. The aftertaste, however, is acidic, bitter, and not so pleasant."

"Overall, this was a really nice quad. Very easy to drink with a lot of nice flavors. SN deserves more credit on this one."
"O - Overall, so I was not blown away by this beer. But at $4.20 per bottle I'm not really going to complain. Glad I have 2 more to just forget about in the cellar. I bet/hope with some time that roast will die out and this will become nice and sweet and plummy. Looking forward to that."

"Overall a real tasty American quad from Sierra Nevada and the Monks of New Clairvaux. Perhaps a little sweet for my taste buds now but would love to try one that has some age on it."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruits, and earthy spices. Taste is much the same with plum and spice flavors on the finish. There is a bit of a sourness with each sip as well. There is a medium amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a distinct plum flavor but it really doesn't stand out too much in the smell."
""

"O: pretty much on par with what I expect from sierra Nevada, exceptional quality and balance. i really enjoyed this one but ive also had the brandy barrel aged one which was a bit more over the top as is to be expected."

"Either the plums or the yeast gives this beer a pretty vinous overall flavor. This adds a nice complexity to a very flavorful yeast strain in such a big beer. A bit boozy but not enough to bother me."

"Overall: a slow sipping big beer that has a nice flavor profile. The fruit sweetness is mild here so the plum flavors contribute but are not overly noticeable. Worthy of a try."
"O: Overall it was a very nice beer. I would call it a ""take"" on a quad, because it generally steps away from many Belgian flavors and scents. I was a bit dissatisfied that there was no plum taste in the beer. If the label didn't mention it, I never would have known."
""
"Three Philosophers is much better as a drink, but even less Belgian than this - at least this has some Belgian character in the nose."
""
"O- I actually had to leave for an assignment halfway through this beer, so the flavors changed entirely as it warmed. Tasty, sweet and the booze wasn't killer."
"The palate opens moderately sweet, with some caramel heft, wheat bread and fruit. The mid-palate is quite deliciously complex, with the interplay between the fruit, the yeast, the spice and the alcohol making this one warming treat. Burnt toast is also present. The yeast character is a relatively clean, fruity, spicy flavor, complementing the caramel notes quite well. Drying on the finish with an earthy, alcohol bite, this beer is medium in body and a little too crisply carbonated. The flavors on the finish are a blend of spice, fruit and carbonic acid. Solid stuff."

"super dark brew with hazelnut edges. decent white head. aroma is heavy plum, lots of concord grapes, slight honey, some heather, a wintergreen spice in the finish. taste is insane! ive gotta boner. thick molasses, grape, sugar, vanilla, spearmint, caramel, earthy, cherries. furkin full bodied brah, heavy carbo. sticky finish. i fudgin bathe in this sheesh"
"O: Not particularly complex, this beer is overtaken by plums. It's too sweet without enough esters. Not terrible, but certainly in the bottom half of Quads."
"O: I really enjoyed this one. Complex but not overly sweet. Plums add character. Awesome mouthfeel."
""
"It might not blow anybody away but this is a nice quad. I liked the additional fruit notes from the plums and really appreciated the fact that it isn't overly carbonated. And while I typically don't talk about packaging, it is worth noting that this makes for a mighty sexy looking display. The corked and caged four pack is really quite attractive. And what's inside is right enjoyable too. If I resist the urge to drink them all, I'll see how 1 or 2 of them do with some age. For the price this is worth a shot for any fans of the style."
"It's pretty good, but the taste hasn't caught up with the rest of it."
""
""
""

""
"Overall, a nice beer, but not one I would buy again. It has lots of flavor, but the combination of dark fruit and intense booziness makes it rather difficult to drink. The best quads certainly have fruit and alcohol heat, but they also have malt complexity that this one lacks. Perhaps a bit more carbonation would drown out some of the fruit and wine notes and bring the bready, malty notes more to the foreground."
"O-Overall, I'm very glad I splurged and bought a four pack. Enjoyed this beer very very much and highly recommend it to any big beer fan. Cheers everyone!"
""
""

"This is a great beer. The underlying quad is delicious but the plums really give credence to the ""dark fruit"" references that are always made in regards to this style. The flavor here is complex, deep, and very enjoyable. This is really a solid offering. This could be one of my favorite quads to date."
""
"O: Really a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Better stock up on this one Quad lovers! I already bought two cases!"

""
"O: Not liking what the plums did to this beer - combined with the heavy yeastiness, it gives it an odd dried fruit taste that isn't very good."
""
"It's Definately one of my favorite beers all time. It's a dark beer but not too heavy! The hints of plum and banana were subtle enough to enjoy with out over-powering the dark coca. Excellent beer but be careful, this beer comes in at 10.3%! A couple of bottles will do."
""
"(O)- I like this, though was expecting it to be much more fruit forward due to the addition of the plums. Nonetheless, it fits the style well and easy to enjoy."
""
"O- dark fruity notes dominate the palate, a nice sweet sipper that serves well as a nightcap on a cold night"

"An interesting entry in the world of quads. Plums add something, which certainly makes it unique. But overall does not stand out on it's own as a quad."

""
"O/D-Its well made. I got the bottle at around $4 so that's cool too."
""
"The sugar plums don't make this a new beer, but it's a nice addition in an already super solid quad. The plums add a nice acidity that cuts through the heavy maltiness and provides depth. A great after dinner/desert beer, and a great quad all around. Definitely recommended for fans of the style."
"Just delicious... probably my favorite of the Ovila beers I've had so far."
""
"O - I'm enjoying this beer, but couldn't see me drinking more than one in a night. Well done Sierra Nevada."

"This small bottle was just the right size."

"O - Sweet and fruity Belgian Quad. Pretty straight forward, but a bit sweet."
"O- this isn't too bad but not my favorite. I like trying beer variants but I won't do this one again. The plums add a nice subtle taste but.... Who loves plums? Sweet label though."
"O: Pretty good Quad. I really like the mouthfeel of this one. The appearance was dull though."
"It has some really nice flavors of dark grains, chocolate and dark fruit. The fruitiness is kept at a good level; it does not overpower the malt. The bready aspect is just a touch too much on the 'burnt' side, like a loaf of the brown bread from Outback that got left in the oven a bit long. Alcohol is well integrating and lacks the usual 'sting' of some beers this high in ABV. Mouthfeel is fine-bubbled and not quite chewy but full enough not to be a problem, carbonation a touch on the low side. It’s a pretty good quad; I’m glad I bought a 4-pack of this and look forward to seeing what this does over the next couple years."

"Sierra Nevada collaborated with monks of the Abbey of New Clairvaux. The quad features sugar plums grown on the Abbey grounds and harvested by the monks. The beer pours a deep, rich brown with ruby highlights and is nearly opaque. A decent khaki colored head diminishes slowly, but is well retained. The nose is rich with malty flavors. Hints of the dark fruits are aided by the addition of the sugar plums, and a bit of molasses, toffee, and spices round out the complex aroma. The dark fruits are pronounced on the palate, with dark cherries, plums, and figs all playing a role. Toffee, caramel, and molasses flavors are contributed by the bold maltiness, while a touch of booze and slight Belgian funk carry across the tongue. Silky smooth, Ovila is fairly heavy in body with a moderate level of carbonation."

"Not my style, disregard these notes if it is your style, don't let this guy make you think it won't be something you like. The old lady likes it, but she is on facebook too much to write a beer review."
""
""
""
"O - This is a really good Belgian quad IMO. I'm not a real big fan of Belgian yeast flavor most of the time but it seems like the sugar plum used in this one helps this beer lean toward a much evolved flavor. I would purchase it again, even at $6 a bottle."
"O - I didn't read reviews before buying this and I'm glad I didn't for the fact that I probably wouldn't have done so based on other opinions. But boy was this a treat and did it's job. One of the best american made belgian style ales I've ever had. It's a shame this is probably the only time it'll be offered bc it's worthy of a seasonal release. The quality of dark fruit and plum flavors are spot on and overall this quad is very tasty. Grab it if you can."
"Pours dark brown - sort of a maroon-tinted mahogany - but light enough for color to be seen throughout and the beer is transparent even in a full (small) glass. Head is thin layer of fine beige bubbles. The aroma has lots of sweet malt and dark fruit notes. Lots of raisins, prunes, plums and other fruitiness. If I didn't know there were plums added, I probably would think this is just a normal quad with particularly deep fruit notes. It smells like a raisin bread pudding. Lots of doughy, bready malt with caramel, molasses, treacle and sweet booze. Very nice spice, as well. Taste starts sweet and builds in complexity and spice. The fruit comes through with a bit of tannic bitterness. Makes me think of macerated plum skin. Most of the sweetness is caramel and other doughy, toasty malt notes. The finish is a bit boozy, but there's a lot of nice lingering flavor. The mouthfeel is fine and gentle. It does get a tad sticky as the beer warms and some of the carbonation comes out of the beer. Hard to avoid that. Still, it coats the mouth nicely and that light bitter note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Overall, I'm impressed by this beer. With their fancier offerings, Sierra Nevada shows off a mastery of restraint. When it comes to adding fruit (and barrel-aging), breweries tend to go overboard. This beer uses plums to enhance its flavor, and the beer, rather than the plums, remains the star of the show."
"Overall: I have never had the standard Ovila Quad, but this version is good despite the lingering cloying sweetness. Better than the Ovila Dubbel and Saison, but still not top notch. I am not sure why Sierra Nevada can't nail these traditional Belgian styles - usually the mouthfeel seems to be the issue. But damn this is a good smelling beer."
"O: Just fantastic. Loved the original Ovila Quad. This one amps it up a bit more. Will be buying more, especially at this price."
"This poured out as a deep brown color, almost black. The head was thin and cream colored. The retention is thin and the lacing is scattered. The smell of the beer is bready and sweet with a subtle touch of chocolate malt in there as well. The taste of the beer is sweet with some chocolate and herbal spice flavors. There is some fruity elements in there as well. The mouthfeel is a smooth with a pretty solid carbonation and medium body. Overall it's a good brew, not sure what I'm supposed to taste from the plum that were added but either way it's a pretty solid Quad."
"Overall: A really nice example of the style from Sierra Nevada, especially for the price. Would definitely buy again."
"Overall, this is pretty disappointing. It's not bad by any means, but it is missing so much character and umph to make it a ""wow"" beer. Just average. The bottle is cute though."

"O – This is a decent beer. Unfortunately for it, it’s the quad category, which immediately puts it at a disadvantage (some of the best beers in the world are in this style). Every aspect of the beer minus the appearance is lacking in some aspect – the aroma and taste lack the complexity of good quads and each have evidence of phenols, the flavor is a bit cloying, and the mouthfeel is lacking in that wonderful characteristic Belgian creaminess. Regardless of all of these things, I appreciate the collaboration and originality of brewing the beer with plums. It’s also pretty tasty (albeit lacking for the style) and very drinkable for 10.2% ABV. All-in-all, it’s a decent beer, and I’m glad I tried it."
"O: Not a perfect Quad but I love plums, perhaps I overlooked some of the flaws and rated this to high based upon my tastes and bias to SN. Either way, I would drink again and at $5 for a 375mL...yeah, its def worth a try."
""
""
""
"Maybe this is an interesting beer, but compared to many other Quads, I have to rate it lower. If I saw it in bottles I might try one-- this just seems to need some sudsiness to lighten up the dark fruitcake. On tap at Tiger! Tiger! in San Diego."
""
"Overall this is a tasty yet mild ale. Only problem is it is too mild really for a Quadrupel."

"O: While this beer has its flaws, it isn't a bad example of the style overall. Easy to drink and pretty tasty, I'll revisit this from time to time."

"B-"

""
"3.75/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Odd that this hasnt been reviewed yet very similar to the regular quad, pours a midnight chestnut brown with the slightest touch of maroon held to light. An espresso crema cap just hangs on through the finish. Nose brings belgian yeast, bran and buckwheat, dark fruity esters and milkshake malt. The taste brings more of the same and while pleasant is one dimensional. Oddly while i do pick up slight dark fruits i cannot find any plums for the life of me - just an average belgian style quad in my book. Nothing to look at here."
