Pouring it out, the khaki head was thick, but eventually went down quite a bit (though never completely dissipating). Looking in the glass, it was fast apparent that this is the opposite of a well-filtered beer, with little bits dancing about in the carbonation. Color is very pretty; depending on the angle of the light hitting it, it can display mahogany or rosewood tones. The flavor has a sweetness to it that stays in my mouth, the kind of complex sweetness that a dried fruit like a date or a raisin has. No hops to speak of, but maybe a little bit of alcohol on the back end. The flavor is rich and complex, without being overpowering, and that is part of what makes this beer such a pleasure. That combined with the beautiful appearance and the aroma (with notes of dried date and rich caramel) show the obvious master craftsmanship that went into the making of this brew.","plaidowl","Jan 20, 2015"

However,  since reading the reviews from the BROS and having somewhat of an understanding of what this is supposed to taste like, I THINK it's pretty spot on. Given that I haven't much experience with this type of beer, it very enjoyable. I gave some to my mother to try as well (which is someone who doesn't know the first thing about different beer styles at ALL) :) and she loved it. This is a beer that you have to try in order to give a review. I suppose it will taste different to everyone given the tremendous complexity of it, but just my two cents, it's worth trying a few or more in order to fully appreciate this wonderfully well rounded Beer","bman13","Jan 03, 2015"

I was disappointed with the appearance of this one. It is just a dull brown beer that has little to no head while you drink it. This is in part because of the high alcohol content but it would be nice to see more of a head on this one. Not the best beer I've had this year but a classic example of a Trappist Ale.","ClavisAurea","Dec 27, 2014"

4,-11.3,,,,,,"Overall – This beer also brewed from malted barley and non-malted cereals, is sweeter in its smell and taste than the no 8. The first sip has serious nip of alcohol though still not over powering and there is a much sweeter taste to it than the no 8 so that this one is closer in flavour to a Leffe. Unlike a Leffe however the taste lingers for a while. Again proceed with caution this is a strong drink and should not be taken lightly. It also has a lot of bubbles so this one also tingles on the tongue.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 22, 2014"

Smells of intense licorice/anise with hints of warm spice and a wet earthiness. Tastes of warm brown sugar coated raisins. On the finish there is a light, dark, herbal taste with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is noteworthy in that it is lighter than expected with noticeable carbonation.","asmith55","Sep 18, 2014"

4.25,-5.8,,,,,,"Ok, not the style that I prefer, but I will give my honest opinion of the style and taste. Pours a decent creamy head at approx. 50 degrees F. Color is very deep and very little light is able to penetrate. Sediment is definately present and beer needs to settle after pouring because of the bottle conditioning. Aroma is of dark fruits and malt sweetness. Taste is full of raisins and malt sweetness. Balance is way better than I expected. Alcohol taste is definately present due to the 11.30% ABV. Overall, a great sipping beer, One is enough, but I will have to say, this is a world class beer","hophugger","Sep 18, 2014"

Appearance dark brown with a bit of reddish hue, half inch of fine small bubbled head, and good lacing. Some yeast sediment which aided in dispersing carbonation. Smell is amazing. Great Belgian yeast Aroma, brown bread, dark cherries, and a hint of brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Complex, with dark fruits, cola, toasted brown bread, and grape nuts giving way to a tart cherry and dried plum, with a bit of alcohol heat, but not what you'd expect, considering the ABV. Finished sweet and rich, with a lingering raisin toast flavor that faded towards coffee and burnt sugar, in a good way. I believe that this is the best beer I have ever had, and I've had quite a few trippels and quads, but this is simply outstanding. Wish it was more readily available.","MikeI","Jul 26, 2014"

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"ever since reading about Trappist beers, I've always wanted to get my hands on one. being that I come from a long line of priests and a bishop, it made the style even more intriguing. I figured I would never find one, at least in my area. well, I took a trip to ocean city, MD and made a stop at Anthony's with the intent on finding a bottle of something new. sitting on the top self was a bottle of the Trappist beer 2nd on my list, don't think I will ever see a westvletern XII. I couldn't wait to get home and try it! I poured it into a silver goblet used by my grandfather (who was a bishop). all I can say about this beer is it is truly amazing....everything about it! definitely at the top of my list. there's beers out there on my favorites that are based a lot off of my personal drinking experience. For instance, erdinger because of the one I had in a small bar in Munich that opened my mind to German beers and even rolling rock (yeah, its a favorite) because it reminds me of my grandfather. however, this beer is my number one solely on taste, can't imagine there's a better beer out there.","flagbearer","Jul 20, 2014"

4.53,0.4,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,"O: This beer did live up to expectations. I am not a fan of beers that are best when served warm so I was glad to note that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 retained most of its delectable nuances at cold temperatures. It's thick, heavy, with a super strong ABV but not overpowering in any of the above categories. It is a drinkable beer (more than expected from a Belgian at 11.3% ABV) that has a nice sweet flavor that would pair with heavy foods such as steak or a good pasta dish. Not to be taken lightly or consumed before a hearty meal or followed by a lesser beer. This is a dessert beer, one to finish with, perhaps with a cigar or during captivating conversation with close friends. I would dare say this would be a better pairing with a fine steak than even the best cab. I look forward to reviewing more Belgians, especially those from Trappistes Rochefort.","jsausley","Jul 14, 2014"

4.97,10.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Much like the Chimay line of beers, and other Trappist brews, the blasé appearance of the bottle belies the complex flavor that lies within. It smells heavily like sugar, probably brown, and anise seed. It tastes heavily fruity, like a carbonated brandy, and is very yeasty. Goes pretty well with some Machego cheese and some hard salami. It's also got a pretty high alcohol content, around 11%, but the kick's somewhat delayed as it's just so darn tasty and toasty you don't really notice the wallop it packs 'til later.","TheBeerLord","Jul 07, 2014"

Not getting any of the stone fruits until right towards the end. Starts with a hint of malt sweetness, proceeds very, very quickly to a facepunch of alcohol. The 11.3% ABV is no secret here. Mouthfeel is as full as you would expect from a quad. Overall, the alcohol was maybe a bit too assertive for me, but it mellowed as the beer got closer to room temp. Not an every day drinker for me, but next to a nice meal, this would be quite nice.","slackattack","Jun 18, 2014"

At a seemingly non-existent 11.3% ABV, this bad boy is straight up dangerous. If it wasn't $5 for that 12 oz bottle I'd buy a whole lot more regularly. What's up with the chunky mud look though? Makes me wonder if I had an old bottle or something: I'll just have to buy more and see. If It was an old bottle - I can say this brew ages beautifully.","Redneckwine","Jun 13, 2014"

Taste is full of dark fruits; notes of raisin, plum, prune, currants, and a hint of chocolate. Texture is rich, moderately heavy and very smooth. Overall, this didn't blow me away quite to the degree I expected, but still a fantastic beer. Beautiful and complex balance of flavors, and so rich and smooth.","ljthiesse","Apr 28, 2014"

It has a very smooth texture for me. The sediment is also interesting, it has a nice coloration and once it hits you towards the end of the drink it adds a subtle complex flavor that can only be expected from a trappist. Some trappist style brews do not have as nearly the great flavor as this one does, so this one for me is a favorite among trappist style brews.","SovietBear1982","Apr 16, 2014"

4.5,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought This was very good beer and a very good example of a quad it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but I still found it to be pretty unique for the style and it kind of has it's own thing going on that i haven't seen in other quads. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little rich, a little creamy, a little filling and the tasting did a great job at holding my attention, I would be pretty happy sipping on a couple of these especially on a cold winter night. What I like the most about this beer was how it wasn't like a lot of quads that I've had but it still stayed very true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it is a little expensive, but that's to expected with most of these good Belgian beers. I would for sure buy this beer again, I would like to keep a couple in the cellar, but the price would prevent me from buying a lot of it. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, I think every craft beer drinker should try this beer. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I have no clue why it took me so damn long to try this beer, but I'm glad i finally did and I won't be sleeping on the one anymore. So far this just might be my favorite Quad and it's for sure one of the best ones I've have had. The only one from them I have left to try is the 8 so I will have to pick one of those up soon. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Mar 13, 2014"

The beer has a fairly complex smell to it. A hoppy smell dominates the nose but with notes of dark fruits. The dark fruits appear to be prunes but are very faint. In addition to hops and dark fruits, the smell has a fairly peppery and salty smell as well as hints of sugar to it. The taste resembles the smell fairly strongly. The taste has a stronger pepper taste with hints of hops but with faint traces of dark fruits. The taste is fairly complex with subtle notes that can easily escape a person's palate if they're not too careful. The mouthfeel is fairly surprising. The beer itself is heavy bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation but feels light compared to other Quads. Overall ,a very good beer and worth getting and enjoying.","HattedClassic","Feb 26, 2014"

Upon a repeat purchase (well actually 1 of 6 bottles since Rochefort 10 is seasonal around these parts), It lived up to the expectations I maintained for every bottle of this world-glass beer as constructed in my head based on that first experience last summer. A true treat (for my birthday this time) worthy of all the praise it gets and a beer that you shouldn't miss the opportunity to try if you get the chance.","DenisKolkin","Feb 05, 2014"

A thin veil of off-white head develops, lingers briefly, and then dissipates to a patchy collection of bubbles across the surface of the glass. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of candied brown sugar, plum, date, raisin, some toffee, more ubiquitous dark fruits, and caramel. A distinct belgian yeast aroma is also present alongside subtle clove. The taste begins with a bit of the brown sugar before a rush of fruit comes through - dark, raisin, plum, date, and even some grape. A nice yeasty funk and some straw finishes it off. Mouthfeel is full bodied but not too viscous, thanks to adequate carbonation. It is lively, and finishes dry with some of the fruity flavors lingering on the palate. Overall, this is a phenomenal belgian quadruple that is absolutely worthy of praise and attention. Well balanced, full of flavor, and simply an excellent brew.","eclipse54","Jan 24, 2014"

Often, at least in my opinion, beers that cross the 10% ABV line lose a lot of the beer quality for sheer alcoholic punch; basically, an unusual wine taste. This is one of the exceptions. The smell and taste have a sweet and spicy theme. The first smell is grape, and then followed by pepper and spice. I believe the taste does the same, but the pepper is the dominant note. This brew is hard to beat. OF course I will get this again.","TeamMathis","Jan 20, 2014"

Color is dark brown, with a decent amount of tan foam but less aggressive carbonation than the 6 and 8, not to mention other Trappist beers. Body is thicker than other Trappists but still falls short of imperial stout or barleywine values. Aroma is rather impressive, milk chocolate, rum, raisins, brown spices, and a blast of alcohol. Smells like a chocolate brownie drizzled with rum sauce. Tastes strong and boozy but quite sweet as well. Brown rye bread and cacao powder, dried dark fruit like dates or figs, caramelized bananas, burnt dark sugar and molasses, ample clove and ginseng spice, culinary herbs ... Wickedly complex and infused with aromatic alcohols. One of the more boozy beers I've had but this works with the other elements. Finishes earthy, woody, and a little tannic like overly steeped tea. Surprisingly complex but I'd say the spicy, earthy elements trump the sweet components in the overall impression. My favorite Trappist ale and widely regarded as one of the world's best beers. The fact that it is easy to find, to the point where some fools derogate it as a ""shelf turd", just means that there is no excuse not to try it.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 18, 2014"

4.56,1.1,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A dark mahogany colored liquid with slightly rosy edges and a major stack of light tan colored foam on top. Chunky lacing follows. The nose enjoys spiced yeast that hints at delicate cinnamon allspice and spruce vinegar. Smooth and so tasteful. The flavor ushers in a remarkably smooth creation that is such a beautiful blend that it's really difficult to identify any individual flavors. There's a light molasses/brown sugar and spruce/ juniper idea with a bit of Chardonnay and a touch of nutty maple whiskey. This probably isn't doing this fine world class beer any justice at all but it's a unique and wonderful blend. Carbonation in this solidly medium bodied brew is quite mild yet so proliferated as to convey a fairly lively, yet generally velvety feel. Quite a treat and definitely more refined than the ""8" which I had last week. Ultimately these aren't my favorite flavors, but if they were, it could be a ""5"!","Durge","Jan 05, 2014"

Perhaps the only real flaw is the over carbonation, that's probably due to extra fermenting in the bottle which added a bit of booze and phenols, but softened the beer a lot, plus the yeast chunkies. All around and amazing beer with great characters and great blending of all characters, smooth, rich, delicious!","jlindros","Nov 11, 2013"

The taste is a bit boozy at first (which would be expected with such a high BAC). But wow. The aftertaste saves it. The boozy flavor doesn't last long before it gets replaced by a sweet creamy flavor that crawls up from the back of your throat. The flavor is full bodied and it's a realitively slow drinker. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm not sure that I'd give it a 100, but it's definitely a beer that any craft beer enthusiast should try in their lifetime. Good stuff.","Ryan_Graham","Nov 08, 2013"

I have now had 3 six packs at ruffly $50 a piece. The only reason I don't have this at a 5.0 is because there was a batch that was off. I took it back to the LQ after drinking 3 and had them swap it out with the distributor because it was so bad. I know this brewed small batch style by Monks, so I guess I get it but at $8 a beer I really do expect perfection and often times I get it with this beer.","Snowman","Jul 04, 2013"

That old friend has never let me down and constantly reminds me that it deserves the same sort of respect Westy 12 and any other great beer in the world gets. The class this has is unmatched and arguably the best quad in the universe. It's flavors can go 1 on 1 with any in the style and come out on top more than just once. This is as fine as Belgian Trappist ales get and we all know Authentic monk ales have class, but the Rochefort 10 takes class to another level and has remained there a long time now. A true Belgian jewel and a true world class quad that deserves more than what it's handed. Ill drink this til the day I'm no longer here. It's that good.","BradtheGreat7","Jun 27, 2013"

With strong notes of dark fruits and slight spiciness from hops to balance out heavy dark malt bill, this beer packs a punch that will knock you on your ass on the first sip.

It pours a nice deep brown, with about a inch to inch an a half beige colored head. First blast of flavor is from the alcohol, and at over 11%, it gives you that almost hot sensation no matter how cold the beer is. Also ,as a side note, I would not suggest serving this beer ice cold. To really get it's nuances, serve it a little warmer around 40-45 degrees. After that there is a taste of caramel and pure heaven. The mouthfeel is very light. I will surely be enjoying this gem again.","spmiller86","Jun 08, 2013"

I had this bottle in two sessions. The first time it was slightly over carbonated for my liking, too much like champagne. So I corked it and drank the rest the next day. I also paired it with some smoked Gouda and muenster . Wow what a difference. This quad has so much going on here . Yes it's cliche' but it is indeed very complex in all aspects. Believe the hype, It's that good. You know when you see a picture of a trappist monk and he's always smiling with a red nose and rosy cheeks?

Damn this is good stuff. The nose is out of this world with figs, blackberries, raisins, prunes smelling liked they were soaked in a spiced rum and let age in a toasted oak barrel for a few months. Some goes for the flavor, except there is a little more noticeable alcohol on the palate. Either way, I am buying another one of these before the store runs out and letting sit for a few months.","ironchefmiyagi13","May 02, 2013"

Very little alcohol flavor and heat. The mouthfeel is heavy, thick, and well carbonated. Not too syrupy, but there is a bit of maple flavor. Overall, this is my favorite trappist/abbey quad.

At 7.99 a bottle, not something I will drink everyday, but will be buying this over and over again whenever I need a great quad to just sit down and enjoy. If you're familiar with other non-trappist Belgian Ales, such as Duvel, Delirium, or La Chouffe, you'll immediately recognize the signature Belgian yeast tastes, but as a trappist quad, you really are getting an amazingly complex tasting beer used with the finest ingredients. Yea these beers have a lot of hype that i'm sure factors into a lot of reviews, and frankly, all the hype is warranted and well deserved. Looking forward to trying Westvleteren 12 next year when I get to go back to Belgium. My hat is off to these monks that still continue to make and supervise the production of this beer.","Roman5150","Apr 03, 2013"

4.74,5.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"This brown consistant beer is definitely one of the best belgian beer I have ever tasted. Strong alcohol percentage and taste that litteraly leaves you breathless, this beer can be drunk at room temperature, or, naturally, at 5 to 6°C. Both will present totally different tastes. I would harshly recommand to have more than two today, because you're going to hate yourself tomorrow. Also, this should be one of the last beers that you taste today, because it will hide any other smooth beer's taste afterwards - they all might taste like water.","Felixp","Mar 30, 2013"

3.43,-23.9,3.25,4,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Rather subtle aroma of molasses, chocolate and soy sauce, with a hint of mild acidity. Highly carbonated. The taste is unexpectedly harsh, with the prevailing notes of molasses, dried prune, dark sugar and rye bread, followed by pronounced bitterness and alcohol. Overall, rather disappointing.","VaRy","Mar 26, 2013"
4.3,-4.7,4,4,4,5,5,"surprisingly much different than expected. Close to flat with a medium body that breaks up nicely across the tongue. Only the faintest touch of detectable alcohol for such a big abv brew. Flavors are sweet, deep, hidden, well blended and pretty balanced. Sweet malts up front followed by a dark fruitiness with a tart belgian candy spike. Woodyness with a big plum and raspberry flavor, a dry yeasty character, faint cherry like medicinals. Alcohol balances the sweetness pretty well but sweetness lingers a bit. Overall a beer that is truly something else, Worth the high price tag. Super complex, incredibly subtle, and super drinkable all at the same time.","jtierney89","Mar 25, 2013"

This is definitely one you want to drink slowly and savor. It seems readily available and though it can be expensive ($6.99 for 11.2 oz, in this area), in my mind it's worth every penny. A perfect beer to break out on a special occasion. This is an absolute favorite of mine and I'd highly recommend trying it to anybody.","hermit990","Mar 22, 2013"

I find the cola and licorice flavors to be a bit much and I know I am in the minority on this one, but I find Rochefort 10 to be a bit less delicious than both St. Bernardus 12 or Westvleteren 12. The alcohol pokes out a tad more and the sugars seem more...well...sugary than the deep bready malt/yeast combo the other two offer. That said, this is still a delicious beer that integrates the ABV so well that there will never be a 'cringe' involved…so smooth for an 11+ %’er.","twiggamortis420","Feb 09, 2013"

It seems like a sort of brawn rather than brains trade-off. It isn't as nuanced and complex as some of the best quads, yet it's more drinkable despite its size. The alcohol is masked so well that it never occurred to me that this beer is 11.3% abv. That is until I stood up and had to catch my balance. Rochefort 10 is always in the discussion when the 'World's Best Quad' title is debated. It is very good, but now that I've had the time to sit down and cast a more critical eye over it, I don't quite think it's there. It falls just a hair short of its competitors.","ryan1788a5","Jan 22, 2013"

The taste is amazing, plums, grapes, complex but so smooth, just a little alcohol burn on the end, just right. Medium carbonation and body is perfect for this style, a sticky finish. Among the elite this style. Great.","Steamer","Jan 13, 2013"

The complex flavors are fantastic and you can tell that these Belgians put a lot of time into their brews. This makes me want to try a Westy and see how they compare. I'm not sure if I'd buy another one of these at 7-8 bucks a bottle, but I will say that it's definitely worth it. Great job Brasserie de Rochefort in Rochefort, Belgium!","RichD","Jan 13, 2013"

The tartness has a cider quality while the sweetness is quite chocolatey. I note some caramel apple in the aroma as well. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that gradually dries just before finish. I pick up a lot of alcohol warmth. Apple, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of brown sugar in the flavor. Just a little overly tart around the edges of the tongue, which throws it out of balance just by that much. The alcohol flavor bitters the finish in an unappealing way.

It has all the elements I was hoping for in a strong dark Belgian beer and has a fantastic mouthfeel to go along with it. It’s unbelievable how 11.3% ABV is almost nowhere to be found.

There top of the head had a small scar on it from the pour. Aroma was very pronounced, could be smelled from much further away than usual. I detected musty grape. Tasted caramel, figs, brown sugar, molasses and malt. Booze was so well hidden I wondered if they put the decimal point too far to the right!

Just over two fingers of bone colored foam rise up and crown the beer, and manage to stick around for a good long while. Little in the way of lacing though. The nose is fairly fruity, though more figs than some of the dark fruits that are more typical in a quad. There's just a bit of brown sugar sweetening up the ester profile, and a subtle clove aroma completes the picture. The fruit flavors, while still fig centric, lean just a little bit more towards plum and raisin than the nose (though I find myself wishing they did even more so). I find myself really enjoying the faint suggestion of brown sugar present, it's a nice, unique touch for this kind of brew. The spicy clove phenols are again relegated to a supporting role (which is how I like them). The body is fairly light and agile mouthfeel wise, but the carbonation could benefit by being just a bit brighter and more lively. I don't know if Rochefort 10 is my favorite quad, but it's surely a classic.","axeman9182","Nov 04, 2012"

There's some bubbly carbonation but its much smoother than the 8 (although the alcohol birn kind of negates that). This is supposed to be one of the best beers available (all the trappist ales are).

The color is an amber red, a bit darker than I had expected, actually. The smell was like the taste, balanced with nothing dominating over anything else. It has a high alcohol content (11%), so there is a trace of a kick in its taste. But like the sour fruit and caramel tastes, it is balanced in well. A solid beer that I would easily drink again and again.","Ilafan","Aug 19, 2012"

Blend of dark fruit coloring, I'd say raisin, raspberry, strawberry and cherry, and grape. Smell is light and of dark fruit aromas. I generally do not like dark fruit-based beers, like ommegang's three philosophers, but this is much different. Smell is crisp and sharp. Taste is otherworldly -- nectar, grape juice, unreal. Nutty presence, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, aftertaste is a bit bubbly, like a champagne, but much less biting. This beer is awesome, prob #2 on my list of Trappispte beers.","rodlavers","Jul 28, 2012"

4.97,10.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"O - This is the best beer in the world. It easily outclasses every barrel-aged stout, Double/Triple IPA, Belgian quad, and other beer I've tried, and I've tried just about all of the best. Nothing really even comes close to delivering the experience from pour, to 5 minutes after the last sip like Rochefort 10. Westy 12 is pretty close, but I think Rochefort 10 suffers in its rankings from being widely available in the States if you're willing to pay for it, because it's better than even Westy 12 in my opinion. This beer is an experience like no other - fresh, aged, it doesn't matter, you won't find a better beer anywhere. Find it, buy it, horde it, and drink one whenever you feel like drinking the best beer ever made.","kdb150","Jul 23, 2012"

I almost want it boiled down a bit so the same flavors are there in richer form. What I like about it is the subtlety of the flavors. I like when fine cuisine does this - it gives you a flavor at about 95% of the level you'd need to recognize it, which forces you to chase it and keep wondering quite what it is. For a beer some call the best in the world, I'd like to see something more. I've been saving my 5's all this time for something like this! Now what do I do? Go back and recalibrate everything?

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured a beautiful reddish-brown, with a finger of gorgeous off-white head. Spectacular. Scents of dark fruit, raisin, some dried apple and slight alcohol when cold. Fruity scents and brown sugar take over the aroma as the beer warms. The apple is also still present. There is also some slight spice aromas, almost cinnamon-like. An excellent, complex nose that evolves as the beer warms. Flavors of raisin, brown sugar, dark fruit, apples, chocolate, and slight alcohol when cold. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced on the finish and the other flavors also become more intense. The fruity flavors in particular become stronger and more assertive. A slight red wine character also begins to emerge. A sublime, complex flavor profile. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with a slight alcohol burn. Quite good, nice to sip. This is an excellent beer, deep, complex and rich. Well worth drinking, well worth savoring. It is simply sublime.","Auraan","Jun 15, 2012"

4.3,-4.7,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Appearance is dark brown with a slight reddish tint; a dense tan head is huge but fades pretty quickly with no lacing. Scents are of dark fruit, licorice, and freshly baked bread. Wish it was stronger though. Taste is mainly dark fruits - plum, raisin - along with a hint of cocoa. Alcohol taste is noticeable but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is outstanding. I enjoyed Rochefort 8 a little more than 10, but 10 is still a wonderful experience.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jun 08, 2012"
4.62,2.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a very dark, purple, brownish color with a hazy like almost soapy texture to it. The head is off white, very pronounced with at least a 4 finger fluffy head that dissipates to a film barely holding on with each replenishing carbonation bubble streaming from the bottom. Huge aromas of raisins, brown sugar, almost a caramelized walnut aroma. Deep cedar notes followed by a nutty sweetness . There is also a vinous character to this that reminds me of inky red wines like shiraz and barolo. Deep dark stone fruits come just after the sweetness and lend itself to a nice warming alcohol note that lets you know this is a big beer. Taste is very complex starting with a big raisin and tobacco note that leave both sweet and earth flavors on the palate. Dry finish but before the finish there is a big kick of prune sweetness and just a touch of cocoa that leaves a bitter note that is quite nice. Dryness overwhelmed the palate on the finish, suggesting another sip. The body is actually medium to heavy bodied, even with the alcohol presence. Warming alcohol burn in a nice way gives this beer a distinct vinous quality as mentioned before. Overall, probably the best quad i have had so far. I never knew what ""extremely complex"" meant but after having this and seeing the flavors develop each second after the sip, i now know what that means. I have 2 bottles of west 12 to try still so maybe that will be better than this. Definitely more complex that Chimay Blue, but equally as drinkable. Very easy to access, and often passed by but you should really try this with a beef roast or a stew. Perfect night beer.","Augustiner719","Jun 08, 2012"

I'm not sure I could tell the difference between the two if you put them both down in front of me, and I'm not sure I'd Westy 12 would be the winner. This is a fantastic quad: it doesn't break new ground, but it is absolute aces as far as the style goes. Complex and savory, Rochefort 10 sets the standard for Belgian Quads and is absolutely a must try. Cheers.","siege06nd","Jun 04, 2012"

Appearance - Pours dark, just a bit of lacing that sticks to the glass. Smell - Figs, fruit, chocolate. Amazing. Taste - Like smell but stronger..the high abv is barely noticeable. Figs, chocolate, raisins, bread. Absolutely delicious. It is a bit much, strong flavors and alchohol, although the alchohol is well masked, it does still tend to have a kick, unlike the 8. Mouthfeel - Chewy, heavy...not too carbonated though. Almost winelike at the same time. Overall - My second favorite beer (next to the 8). Expensive, but an experience that any beer lover should try.","BrewHawkeye","May 27, 2012"

It's a bit unfair to compare the other quads because I just had a 2006 bottle from Kulminator. Aging this beer only makes it better. The little bit of heat felt with a fresh bottle changes and all the sweet malt, toffee, caramel notes come out much more prominently. Wish I had it in me to drink another in one session but might be a bit too indulgent. Can't wait to drink another bottle soon.","rdespain","May 15, 2012"

The smell and the taste are so beautifully complex that I can't wait to buy another one or two just to enjoy without reviewing. The mouthfeel too is something that's very important to me in a beer and this one is stellar. It carries the weight of the flavours and smells so well, and goes down much easier than an 11.3% ought to. I could big this one up for hours. Go try it, I strongly recommend it.","killianf","Apr 12, 2012"

Pours very murky dark brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big plum, raisin, caramel, banana, molasses, clove, pepper, biscuit, roasted malt, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Awesome aromas with great complexity. Taste of big molasses, caramel, plum, raisin, prune, pepper, clove, banana, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of sweetness and spiciness; with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Incredibly lush and smooth mouthfeel as well. This drinks way too smoothly for 11.3%, but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is practically invisible, with pretty much no warming noticed. Overall this is a beautiful Quadrupel. Big complexity, smoothness, and flavor balance. Amazing.","superspak","Mar 30, 2012"

It’s nice crisp when it first hits your tongue, and really envelopes your mouth with a thick warm feeling. I can pick up some fig and raisin flavors along with some mild citrus fruits like grapefruit. It has a very good aftertaste with some strong alcohol flavors.

This one is highly rated for a reason. I even gave my mother a sip--who turns her nose up at anything but Coors Light--and she was wowed by it. You don’t have to be a beer snob to enjoy this one.

4.5,-0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The Trappist Rochefort 10 is a beautifully dark, rich beer. It is very alcoholic for a beer at about 11.5% which is why it is called Rochefort 10. This beer retains its head for quite a while considering its ABV which, for me, is one of the determining factors of a quality beer. Deep, complex flavors that gradually change even as your pallet adapts to the flavor like all truly great beers should, in my opinion. Flavors change from hints of dark caramel-raisiny to light floral notes at the finish which are likely brought out from the high ABV. Because this beer is a quadrupel, the alcohol is very prominent and perhaps maybe too prominent for those who are new to the wonderful world of Belgian style beers, however, to those who are accustomed to strong flavored beers this one is great! It does sound like I am going on and on about how much alcohol is detectable in this beer, but don't misinterpret this as a fault, this beer is balanced near perfectly. In summary, this beer is very complex, has a beautiful dark brown (nearly black) color, strong slightly sweet/rich smell, and a complex taste. The Trappist Rocheforts are on my all time favorites list. Absolutely Delicious!","prosson","Feb 26, 2012"

The smell is dark fruit (plum, prune, figs and a hint of vanilla). The taste follows the scent but so well integrated that it takes a bit of sipping to fully identify all that is going on in this very complex brew. This beer has wonderful carbonation and at times I thought I picked up a cola taste and the mouth feel when held on the tongue for a bit was similar to a mouthful of Coke with the fizzy tingly feeling. This is a monumental beer. I can't recall enjoying a beer more. If Westvleteren 12 is better than this then I don't want to know about it. Simple outstanding!","Nuke77","Feb 09, 2012"

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Purchased from the Seibu department store in Ikebukuro, poured into a 378ml glass goblet. I was so excited to try this brew, and it met every expectation and went beyond. The color is a beautiful dark hue that is 99% opaque except for a brilliant burgundy rim that appears if you hold it up to a light source. The scent was deep and nose-warming, and when I took it into my mouth, immediate sensations of dark berries and cherries took over. The swallow was accompanied by a flash of heat in my cheeks and throat, evidence of the 11.3% alcohol level. However, nothing painful about it... just concocted bliss. Half way done with the bottle, I enjoyed the changing flavors as it casually warmed in the room. I might have started it off too cold, or maybe the alcohol was affecting me, but I noticed as I drank and as it got warmer, the taste improved even more. I didn't serve it very cold, just maybe 20 minutes in the fridge after I returned home. Anyway, enough of this whole sexual experience I had with this brew. If I had three thumbs, they would all be up for this wonderful drink.","shigg85","Feb 06, 2012"

The nose is that of toasted malt together with fruit and malty sweetness. The yeast is light and adds a hint of fruity flavor. A hint of heat. The flavor is quite complex: roasted malty sweetness, fruit, hints of chocolate. The alcohol is hidden quite well but reveals some heat on the tail end. The beer finishes with syrup mouthfeel and hints of cereal grains with a lingering fruit fig-like flavor. Good. Overall, this is a good beer.

As the beer settles into the snifter-inspired vessel, a dark smooth liquid emerges with a decent cap of foam. The color of the beer is dark chestnut brown. After allowing the brew to catch its breath the aroma is unmistakable. The alcohol is certainly noticeable, but it is mitigated by so many other things: burnt sugar, prunes, cloves, pear, chocolate. The complexity is demonstrated in the waves of the aroma. These characteristics come alive on the palate. The beer is much nimbler than expect and even manages some prickly carbonation. A bitterness pervades the entire experience providing balance to this Behemoth. The wonderfully melded components provide a deep rich flavor that is distinct and complex.","BeardedBoffin","Dec 07, 2011"

The aroma was nice with a lot dried fruits dominated by plums and figs. The taste is just exceptional, a little more sweet than the aroma would lead you to believe and the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is great, a bit on the heavy side but goes down smooth and very sticky. Overall a fantastic beer I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said.

It's all there - sugar, rummy raisin - but no sticky mouth, nothing lingering that shouldn't linger. It's a boozy beer but one that makes you feel like you can drink a few in one sitting. (You probably shouldn't.) An adult beer. I nursed this on its own while playing Super Mario Bros with my niece and nephew but could easily pair this with beef stew.

The initial taste was a sweet candy flavor that was well balanced with a warming tartness. The flavor combinations made the beer not too sweet or too tart. The warming nature makes this an ideal beer for a warming a cold winter day. On the other hand, sipping the bottle with a friend or friends could also be ideal. With a thick texture, there were hints of prunes, grapes, and other sours fruit that touch the palate as the aftertaste fades. The flavors are certain able to keep the tongue entertained as the thick texture stays in the mouth. This is a beer that can be tasted well after swallowing.","JohnnyHopps","Dec 02, 2011"

The taste is sublime - dark fruits, plum and suggestions of grape again mirror the nose. Minimal booze and finishes a bit dry. There is just a slight bit of a mildly unpleasant finish, but that is being picky. Having had several, my guess is that it goes away after being cellared. The mouthfeel is velvety, low carbonation, good body. Overall, this beer is really good and shows that not everything that is good has to be hard to get.","seeswo","Nov 15, 2011"

Nose has some alcohol, brown sugar, prunes/figs, a rich malt character and a light herbal/vinous note. Taste has a beautiful profile, dark fruits, sugars, fantastic malt notes. Some wood, a light sweetness (maybe vanilla-y) and some spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is lovely, extremely velvety and smooth - excellent all around.

The aroma is huge on this one of sweet figs, fresh plum maybe, sugar and almost a light port aroma. The taste on this starts with just a bit of carbonation then takes off. I like that the sweetness powers its way to the front then quickly fades to an alcohol heat and last a bit of a malt finish. This is so incredibly smooth, I can not over state this. The finish is almost velvet like even at close to room temp. A very good quad that very closely lives up to the hype.","lonestar4lunch","Nov 08, 2011"

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"My Fave!!! Pours deep brown with a thin head and good lace. Smells like malty dark fruit. Taste is a mind blower. Dark fruit, rum raisin, banana, booze, brown sugar, apple butter, yet not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A bit oily and chewy. Not too carbonated. It is hard to describe how this brew EXPLODES on the palate with such complexity, so much going on. So many sweet nuances, yet not cloying. Finishes surprisingly clean and dry for such complex flavor. This is by FAR the best of it's style I've tasted. Stunningly good.","hombrepalo","Oct 18, 2011"
4.69,4,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is a truly complex beer. I've noticed some things since writing down my observations on beer, and most of them have to do with yeast. When I compare this beer to Unibroque's offerings, I understand why so many flock to Belgian creations: the yeast. It has to do with so much of the flavor, nose, and feel of the beer. Yeast touches all of the aspects of a beer, and Rochefort has a dynamite strain. When I added a little yeast to the beer after a swirl of the bottle I got more of a fruity flavor. Amazing! Very impressed with this beer, in that the complexities come with ease. I have a feeling I'll update this review at a later date when I am able to observe more aspects of this interesting creation.","Philousa","Oct 16, 2011"

Smells of raisins and fig and you can get a tinge of alcohol in there as well. The taste is one of dark fruits and honey. The slight taste of alcohol blends nicely into the mix and is not overpowering at all. Very pleasant taste in general. Very thick mouthfeel but one that suits the style very well. It's velvety and smooth. Carbonation is moderate and fits in well with what i was expecting. I think i'm in love with this beer and will be buying at again for sure. For 5.99 its well worth it.","Rhynes2","Oct 10, 2011"

There's a long finish with a little alcohol burn to it from the 11.3% alcohol but yet it still doesn't seem too hot.

In low light, pours a very dark shade with a small 1/4th"" head that disappears quickly not leaving any lacing. The oh so famous etched elephant in the base of the glass provides a nucleation point for carbonation to release, thus forming a incredible cap of foam about 5 mins after pour. The beer is so dark in the dim light that I cant see through, leaning toward a dark brown. Larger size chunks of yeast and protein float around near the bottom despite a soft delicate pour. Smell is very soft. Smells of grapes, plums, alcohol soaked dates, and a bit of brandy for me. The taste matches the nose, soft and delicate. White grapes are up front with assorted dried fruits, mainly raisins. The mouthfeel is strait up velvet. It is so smooth and so soft. Its weird how such immense taste can be paired with such a delicate presentation, but these bastards make it work. The alcohol is almost undetectable, which also means it is deadly. I have honestly had better quads, some of which are domestic, but this beer shines with its own astounding quality's. If I find it again for $4 a bottle, I'll be grabbing a few to cellar.

The beer poured a cider-brown with a thin film off head that faded quickly into a light ring of bubbles around the outside surface of the beer. The nose was a sweet mixture of molasses, raisin/date/fig, light alcohol, yeast and a little malt. The taste was a wonderful melding of complex flavors. Spicy yeast, brown sugar, malt, the gamut of dark fruits, molasses and a bit of chocolate. The alcohol is there, but it's very well masked amongst the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium to full bodied with a good amount of prickly carbonation.

Of course, that is also dangerous since you could pound these beers if you wanted. But again, coming in at 11.3% ABV you should only drink one or two of these before slowing down.

4.82,6.9,4,4.5,5,5,5,"This is my second Trappist Ale to taste, the first being Chimay. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky brown color, poured slowly so little head, but the craziest thing Ive ever seen at the top of the beer with the head: the carbonation bubbles are swirling around in circles in the middle of the glass. Nuts! Smell- sweet fruits, cherry, breadyness, brown sugar, alcohol, maybe a faint scent of chocolate. WOW there is a lot going on here. Could probably think about it and smell it over and over and get something different. Taste- prunes, richest carbonation I have ever experienced in a beer, cherries, raisins, almost no alcohol present. Amazing for 11.3% beer. Mouthfeel- the rich carbonation off sets the richness of this beer and gives it a needed dry quality. I've never had a beer this big that was this smooth. I can't even imagine what this will do with time. Drinkability- this is among one of the best beers I have ever had. I'm cellaring a few more, we will see what happens!","lnashsig","Jun 09, 2011"

4.35,-3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"The taste is superb and full of dark-roasted caramel malts that make the beer sweet and flavorful. Chocolate notes are there too, but I mostly notice caramel more than in any other beer I've had. It's sweet and almost dessert-like. The booziness is noticeable in a big, enveloping way immediately after the sweetness of the caramel. As it warms up, the alcohol becomes more and more pronounced, almost to the point of taking away from the amazing sweetness and flavor of the caramel, and this is the only reason I take off any points for this one. With such a high ABV this is somewhat expected however, and the overall flavor was still fantastic. Also the alcohol was warming, so it wasn't much of a detriment to the flavor. The mouthfeel is just spot on with a creamy smoothness that brings the whole beer together into a nice package. It's clean in the finish, with lingering boozy twinges in the mouth. Overall, fantastic beer and one I'm glad I had the chance to taste.","chodinheaven","Jun 02, 2011"

I don't really get as much sediment as I did with 6 and 8. #10 seems more fruit forward with aromas of sweet plums jumping at your tastebuds as you take a sip. The 11.3% ABV is pretty well hidden as the fruit aromas cover it up and leave none to very little alcohol burn and stepping aside for the smoothness of the sip. This is goes down easy.

Smells of dark fruits, fermented raisins, spices, and yeast. There is a bit of a funky smell coming out of the glass too. Taste is very spicy and surprisingly funky. Lots of fermented dark fruits and super dark brown sugar. However, there is a definitely an off flavor here as I am tasting dirty gym socks. It's to degree where it's not very dominant but it's enough to be noticeable. The beer is pretty flat and combined with the taste it's a chore to even sip on this one.

This shit is something else thats for true. High octane raisins and figs hit the nose accompanied by huge alcohol clouds and ends with subtle grape juice like finish. Dark chocolates, strawberries, cherries, vanilla, cherry oak, rich malts, and of course that famous Belgian yeast strands are also very detectable. Dark fruits, sweet brown sugars, dark chocolates, smoked apples and cherries. Sweet grapes and mellow fruits add to the finish. Medium to heavy on the feel, almost like syrup, so so sweet yet a mild finish. This kind of melts in your mouth like cotton candy, it feels very heavy then melts away, amazing.

4.35,-3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall / Drinkability: I think I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think the famous Rochefort chalice is the wrong glass for this beer. I think I would capture more of the smells and tastes if this was in a tulip and next time that's what I'll use. Overall a very malt forward beer, but not cloying, and a very interesting to sip and savor. Despite the higher alcohol I did not notice it until the end of the glass, but by then the alcohol was warming and even then I was pleasantly sated - no need for a second glass.

I haven't had them side by side so it's hard to be objective, but I found this to be more sweet and alcoholic, and the buttery notes I've gotten in both the Rochefort 8 and 10 are just not doing it for me. It's still a tasty brew, but currently I'd have to give the big three Quads a ranking of... 1. Westvleteren 12, 2. St. Bernardus 12, 3. Rochefort 10.

Hops are invisible; it's definitely got a malty spine and that dark fruitiness that you expect in a world class Quad. For the complexity, taste and overall experience, I score this one high but it fails on drinkability for me so I can't give it an A, it's a B+ IMHO.

Dark brown look probably less head than St. B 12, but is perhaps a bit more drinkable because of a softer carbonation for such a high abv beer. This is a bit different than St. B 12 in that it smells a tad bit more like fruit than fine sherry (St. B). The taste is less fruity, but as I mentioned more drinkable and dare I say I prefer this beer a bit more because of it. You have to drink this slow.

4.62,2.4,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"What is there to say but this is an exceptional beer. Aroma isn't what I would consider complex but it is so good it only whet's your appetite for what's to come. It is very sweet (I like that), like a liquid candy bar (in a good way) but it's somehow balanced or tempered by the yeast and alcohol. The alcohol accentuates the taste rather than just creating a pleasant warming or boozy quality. It certainly has similarities to malt liquor but it seems every sip brings something new. My only complaint is the bottle isn't big enough!","Bfarr","Feb 20, 2011"

4.68,3.8,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Someone told me that this is the type of beer you need to sip slowly to enjoy, but you will want to gulp it down. Boy was he right. It poured a very very dark brown with a light 1 finger head. The smell as a bit fruitier than I was expecting. When you sip it, you notice immediately that it coats your entire mouth, but it is not heavy at all. I know others have commented on the alcohol bite, but I did not notice it at all -- something quite exceptional for a beer with this ABV. The taste is complex but not overbearing. I do get some dark fruit notes, but everything is balanced exceptionally well. It has a short finish but it is satisfying. I was surprised at complex this was without hitting you in the face. In a word: subtle. It scores a perfect 100 when it comes to drinkability.

Smells of melon, raisins, plum, peach, molasses, grapes. Flavor is one of the best I have sampled. Figs, plum, peach, pear, melon, molasses, caramel, chocolate. The more I taste the more flavors I find. Rich and creamy in my mouth. I would like to drink this all day, but with the price and the ABV or almost 12 percent, I don't think this will happen.

The smell is fantastic- dates, walnuts, malt, spice, very complex smell. I wish I didn't have a cold right now, because I'm having a hard time picking up all the smells- still great though. The taste: One word comes to mind when I take my first sip- ""WOW!"" I don't know where to begin. Caramel, dates, raisin, malt, and alcohol hit the taste buds. Each mouthfeel is like eating a loaf of bread- but still smooth. Slight burn w/ the alcohol aftertaste. What a great beer. At 11.3%, it's a sipper, and you wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. World class all the way. This is definitely one of my favorite quads, and one of my favorite beers period.","jayhawk73","Feb 15, 2011"
4.84,7.3,4,5,5,5,4.5,"Pours black with a large beautiful off-white head. Special care must be taken to stand this one up for awhile before enjoying, and when it's poured unless you want to chew it you need to keep a close eye on the neck of the bottle and pull back when you see that healthy sediment start to slide down. Unique and wonderful smell of malt and banana. Flavor is fantastic, a malty plum-like flavor that is dry and yeasty. Soft mouthfeel despite the healthy carbonation. Goes down nice, with flavor to the end. Finishes dry and complete. An outstanding beer that I personally enjoy with some nice aged gouda.","Wegomlegging","Feb 13, 2011"

I was most surprised by the strong alcohol smell and taste, most good beers of this abv hide that. Now, my only other quad experience is Ommegang Three Philosophers, so I'm not a quad expert. I might get another bottle to age and see if that improves it. My guess from the date stamped on the label is that this was bottled 4/14/10, so it would be 10 months old, so it might need more time on top of that. I'm also curious about how other reviews either highlight the alcohol presence, or talk about this wonderful, complex, amazing beer. Will update if I get another one.","MadCat","Feb 10, 2011"

It also has this slightly off, sour tinge to it. Meh. It's very bready and gives off a lot of dark fruits. Of course, a little too much alcohol. This makes me crave a St. Bernardus 12 Abt. It drinks ok, and that's about it. It's still crisp and goes down smoothly but isn't very drinkable. This beer features far too much alcohol. This was infinitely better the first time I had it.

I would have thought that to be really impressive (and while it still tastes good) there is a tad bit of sour to the flavor that I must honestly say I didn't expect to taste.

Before this, I looked forward to a frosty Franziscaner Dunkel or Guiness with excitement, but now anything less than a Rochefort 10 doesn't get me to that place. Sadly, I live in Austin, TX, now, and Rochefort doesn't ship to TX due to tax reasons, so I leverage every trip out of the state as an opportunity to buy/drink as many 10's as possible. It has a body, flavor, smell, drinkability (especially for 11.3% ABV), and overall enjoyment that is unmatched from my experience. Still haven't had Westy 12, and think I'm going to save that for an actual visit to the monastery in Belgium. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is a decent substitute to get me by, but it and Chimay blue will never match the superior experience that a Rochefort 10 provides. Ignore the price tag and grab as many bottles as you can, then enjoy the pleasure it brings.","boulderaz78","Dec 27, 2010"

Little visible carbonation. The nose revealed plum, blackberry, raisin, date, tart cherry, cocoa, slight coffee, and the presence of alcohol. The taste revealed black cherry, chocolate, and molasses initially, then a dry tartness midpalate, and finally a smooth brown sugar finish, with some lingering tartness afterward as well. The alcohol was much more hidden in the taste versus the smell. Deeply complex, yet oh so balanced. Thick feel, yet velvety smooth, with no carbonation, and a dry bitter tartness afterward.

What is it about the monks that make them brew such magical offerings such as this? You can really tell the difference between the water used in this beer vs. other quads/belgians. I think thats what does it, well, that and the years of this yeast being developed. I have read reviews where they say the alcohol is sharp. I don't think so. It is well hidden, for 11.2%. The appearance is what I would expect, dark with lots of sediment. A nice sticky head that sticks with it. Mmmm, the sediment is an added treat IMO. Smell is wonderful, I get raisins, bread, dark currents, and something else I can never quite put my finger on. Taste is fantastic! I like to pour it cold and let it sit for awhile before I taste it. Then I sip on it as it warms, letting my palette really warm up with it. If you tried this cold, then tried another one warm, it is completely different. I prefer it somewhere in the middle. The mouthfeel is good as well, kind of chewy but not too thick. Drinkability is also good, but I would never dream of slamming it. This is one to be savored.

There is a lot going on here. The mouthfeel is great. It feels thicker but light at the same time, slips down the throat with some zip on the tongue. feels like a party in my mouth. This is a very drinkable beer especially given the ABV. I like this beer. I'm glad I tried it and will rate it highly because it is crafted with as much artisanal skill as any beer I've ever had.

Feels nothing like 11.3% and is extremely smooth. I intended to drink this slowly and pair with a sharp cheddar but after the first sip, I chose to drink it alone.

Nose is sweet dried fruites (raisin, fig, prune) with caramelized malt and light citrus. The alcohol is definitely present on the nose. The flavors are not quite as dark, with the malt and yeast taking over. The fruits are a little more acidic, and much juicier, not as dried, on the palate. The plum flavor really comes through.

It has an excellent, full, rich feel with some faintly medicinal-tingly character and feel. It's excellent, has a rich, strong character with some complexity, but it is a little too thick, heavy-duty and sweet and fails to achieve the incredible balance and complexity of character that the #8 does. Then again, I suppose that that is part of the nature of this beer, so much higher in alcohol, and for the alcohol, the character and drinkability are really very high.","Offa","Sep 26, 2010"

The smell is pretty sweet dominated by dark fruits. There's raisins, dates, brown sugar, chocolate, pears, banana, and spice. Lots of sweetness once it hits your mouth along with a warming alcohol. There's some sweet breadiness as well as a molasses component. The raisins and dates also make a reappearance in the taste. Mouthfeel was slightly different than expected. Although it was creamy, there was a bit thinner feel at first. The creaminess then wiped this out. I'd enjoy a little less carbonation.

The head is light tan in color, extremely creamy and has wonderful retention and lacing. On closer inspection, the lacing appears to shimmer. What's with that? The aroma is an incredible mix of raisin, fruit leather, molasses, tart cherries, chocolate, and clove. There is so much going on that every time I take a sniff it is like I pick out something different. One smell that that I do find myself searching for is alcohol. It seems to be almost completely hidden in the aroma. I take a sip and the complex flavors cascade over my tongue. Once again, dark dried fruits seem to be center stage, but are quickly followed by burnt and flavorful dark sugar. Spice notes of clove and star anise also enter the mix. There is also a wonderful leathery earthiness in the flavor that gives this brew a real old world sort of charm. The alcohol is more present in the flavor, but seriously, this thing hides its ABV very well. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium and has a nice smoothness and a long, but delicate finish. I am not a huge fan of quads, as they tend to be a little bit hot, but this is like a steel fist in a velvet glove. It's a sipper, but goes down easily for style and is quite enjoyable.

The mouthfeel is very nice, but it tends to be a little watery...I thought this beer would be a little more full-bodied.

This is a trappist beer, but is very different from most of the other trappist beers out there because it is exceptionally dark, and does not have the ""wheaty"" aftertaste associated with most belgiums. The beer pours very dark, and does contain sedement, with a cloudy dark appearance. The smell is a bit smoky, with intense caramel and chocolately tones. The taste is very, very smoothe for such a dark beer, with a very sweet finish, with a little touch of smokiness and bittering, but both working in accord with the heavy chocolate/caramel flavors. I have never drank more than 2 at one sitting due to the price point of this beer, but 2 will definitely put you in a stupor. Perfect beer to accompany a steak, chop, or shank. Would be the perfect beer if not for the price point!","mcnkuckles","Jul 15, 2010"

Tons of lacing and head retention. The smell has lots of dried fruit - cherry and plum mostly - and a hint of sweet chocolate. Some brown sugar too. Flavour is just out of this world.

In addition, in contrast to some other Belgian (and Belgian-style) beers, the texture is largely unremarkable and does not provide any relief from the sweet fruitiness of the flavor. Overall, this beer can serve as a benchmark against which the flavor of other quads and Belgian strong dark ales are compared, but the potency of flavors is just a bit too much, and this beer breaks down just short of excellence.","devilben02","Jul 08, 2010"

Despite being aged for 9 more months, this did not mellow out enough to be a close enough in comparison to the much softer Westveltern 12.

Poured into the Rochefort goblet, very proper. Poured dark brown with plenty of expected sediment, nice off-white head sticks around pretty well. Smell is huge on this one, excellent and strong. A really great raisin/booze scent. Tastes include raisin, figs, rich chocolate truffle, brown sugar, spice, booze, plum. Maybe the most noticeable thing about the aged bottle compared to a new one is the mouthfeel, much creamier and less harsh on the alcohol. The alcohol taste that is there is very warm and comforting on the stomach. A truly great beer to sip and savor but it's hard to because it tastes so great. The last few sips are full of yeast. At the bar I paired it with some excellent yogurt with cranberries, granola and nuts and while enjoying them they played ""Black Out"" by Pavement and I was pretty much in heaven.","Chico1985","Mar 06, 2010"

The beer only gets better as you drink it and as it warms. I found myself disappointed that I had only bought one bottle. Anyone who is getting their ""good beer"" career started should definitely pick this one up, it does not disappoint.

The taste follows, with the molasses, figs, vanilla, and brown sugar coming through strongest. At the surprisingly (but not overly) dry finish a final sugary sweetness pries its way forward, a fitting end. The body is medium, bordering on heavy, moves fizzily smoothly over the tongue, and does not sloggingly cover the mouth, allowing this brew to be highly sippable and enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Feb 27, 2010"

It's velvety smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. It's a bread like, malty beer. A bit medicinal due to the high abv, but that imparts a slight, very very slight smokiness.

Besides all the sweetness and warmth a ponderous Earth element reigns: Something rotten, woody, musty and old as Earth is lurking beneath to grab the lonely wanderer. This beer holds a dark secret. Rochefort 10 is a complex brew yet so obviously based on simple recipe - not surprisingly as the best things in our lifes are the simplest ones.Richer and musty as Rochefort 6, similar to but stronger (and less carbonated) in every aspect than R8, which, although good, is like R10 diluted with water. It's not nearly as fruity as St. Bernardus Abt.12 and lacks the aristocratic silkiness of Westwleteren which hides the alcohol better and is more refined. Thick malty body is lightly crispy and even so velvety smooth and creamy as it goes down. Apart from mostly unobtrusive alcohol presence the beer is highly enjoyable and very drinkable for such a sheer ale.

The smell is great- rich and chocolately with some dark fruit; kind of like a deeper, richer doppelbock. This is one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. The taste is also chocolate with a slight bit of alcohol in the background. Although it doesn't burn for the amount of alcohol in the beer, I can feel it warming my stomach. Nice. As it warms I get a hint of skunk flavor. I'm not sure how long this has been on the shelf but it could be a bit light-struck. Mouthfeel is smooth on the tongue but carbonation is a little harsh as it goes down my throat. Drinkability would be pretty good on this except for the price and amount of alcohol.

Lacing is modest but available. Smell is complex, maybe too complex for my preception at this point, but I'm getting a lot of dried fruit, rum-like quality, pepper, and the booze is lined up in there. The taste is excellent and develops as the temperature climbs. Plums, raisins, and figs with an alcoholic kick in the ass soon after swallowing. The mouth is very creamy yet still retains more of a medium body. The carbonation was a bit much right after pouring, but subsided and is now actually a bit lacking as I have whittled it down to a few sips left. This is nearly irrelevant as the creaminess and sustain of the feel are wonderful. It be exciting to see how this beer turns out if you wait the recommended five years or so they suggest. All in all this is a complex, hearty beer that drinks quite well considering the high ABV.

I thought drinkability was good, but not great. I prefer the St. Bernardus ABT 12 in that regard.

There is a sweetness to this beer from caramel and sugary candy flavors as well as a smoothness derived from something like oak/wood which is noticeable on back end. Balanced w/ fruit flavors like orange and some figs, there is a light herbal and spicy hop presence in the back which leads to a balanced beer with a little bit of a dry kick.

Frankly, I wanted the 10 to be better than the 8, but it isn't. A very good beer truly, but the ABV gets in the way in the 10 that it does not in the 8. I have 5 more bottles that I will let age in my cellar and report on changes over time. In the near term I will try another 10 (the sixth in the cellar)that I will let warm a little first. Finally, a store in the area has the 8 for $3.29 a bottle I am going there and buying every last bottle they have.

I received a bottle as a gift and poured into my trappistes rochefort chalice. The color is a dark amber with about a half inch head, I pour the whole bottle so there is noticeable sediment. The smell is like Christmas morning, a sweet blend of clove, anise, dried fruit, and alcohol. The taste evolves with every sip, with a masterful blend of raisin, plum, clove, anise, among other spices, and a warming alcohol finish. It's truly one of the few beers that seem to evolve with each sip. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, a little on the chewy side. The high alcohol content is expertly masked by all the sweetness and complex flavors. There is just so much to say about this beer and yet words really fail to do it the proper justice it deserves.

The flavor is very sweet and alcoholic; a bit straight-forward in this respect, a lot of caramelized sugar flavor and ripe fruitiness. The body is very thick and full, but the alcohol keeps it from being too sticky in your tongue, and the coarbonation is ample but very soft at the same time. This is quite a beer, but I still like Rochefort 8 more, simply because its levels of alcohol and thickness make it a more pleasant experience. 10 is simply a massive beer, you've got to be ready for it for sure or it'll kick your ass.","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

4.79,6.2,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Poured to a dark brown cloudy color with a perfect sized (fit the glass perfectly) medium tan head that has good legs, leaving sheets of lace down the side of the chalice. This is a very good looking brew. The aroma has a warming alcohol smell, rum or brandy? Dark sugar, could be adding to why I feel it has rum like characteristics? Different fruit, apple and/or pear and cherries. What a fantastic and inviting mixture of aromas. The taste is simply fantastic, again going with the rum aspect, I pick up rum cake. Has a wood like flavor that seems to linger for a bit then disappears. The fruit does come out, but not as the apple/pear I noticed when I was first taking a whiff, with fig / date / prune flavors. Medium spice flavors that mix, oh so well. I know that a lot of folks say that they get banana when they drink this one, not for me as I can't pick up that flavor one bit. The feel of this one does not come close to the 11.3% alcohol level as it is very smooth and well hidden behind all of the interlaced flavors, though as this brew warms the alcohol esters do seem to come out a little more but in a way that is a complete complement to this brew. Very easy brew to drink even though it should be a sipper, but it is damn good and goes down quickly. Give this brew a try as it is simply a delight.","Stimack","Jan 25, 2009"

It finishes sweet as well, but with a very nice, zesty hop touch. This beer is one of, if not, the best I have ever tasted. Even for it's high ABV, it is very smooth and delicate.

4.61,2.2,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Upon tasting, I was correct. This beer is amazing. Perfect balance between the main components, malty up front with just the right amount of hop kick to keep it in check to follow. Sweetness is typical Belgian, but far from overpowering, I think the carbonation gives it a sizzle that acts as counterpoint. Hint of a grassy flavor, but nothing like a barnyard. Buried deeper in the flavor profile are dark fruits (plum? raisin? date?) and what to me tastes like licorice, or something similar. Mouthfeel is just thick and coating, but in a completely awesome way because of the high carbonation, keeps things moving. It's like drinking velvet, the consistency is just so easygoing. That makes for an amazing oral sensation as well as drinkability. There's a little boozy presence on the finish but it settles right in, not too hot or anything. I could drink this forever. I want to give 5's all around, I really do. I'm severely tempted, but i think it's just a little too much of a sipper to earn perfect marks for drinkability and mouthfeel. Not quite perfection, but this is pretty damn close to it. While I'm still pretty early in my beer drinking life, this may be the best I've had so far. Now I want to cellar one, and see how much closer to 5s across I can get!","damienblack","Dec 29, 2008"

It might have been because I had some difficulty in opening the bottle, which made it bubble up so I had to pour a bit quicker than I would have. But its a dark brown with a few ruby red hues. The head is offwhite, and it lasted the entire time. I could even see bits of bubbles and sediment waiting around in the beer. The smell is yeast, and a bit of alcoholic sweetness. The taste is nearly perfect. I love the way all of the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the darkness, and even the good sweetness from the darker, roasted malts is extracted. If the alcohol content was just a little bit more subdued, namely if the bit of burnt alchohol taste was not present, I could've found a perfect 5 in this, but I really love it. The mouthfeel has adequate carbonation, a good amount of complexity from the darkeness and sweetness. And it drinks very well for the style. I could drink these until it caught up with me and knocked me on my ass. I will probably buy another at some point in the future.","taylorhamrick","Dec 21, 2008"

Alcohol aroma is both spicy and a bit like perfume. Taste is much like the aroma. Initially its fairly malty but sweetness quickly builds. The dark fruit esters are a constant and lurk just beneath the sweetness. As this brew warms a bit the flavors actually seem to come together a bit more; they mellow a bit and this becomes much more balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium-light+ in body with high carbonation. There is a very prominent alcohol presence here but its not overwhelming or harsh as the alcohol takes on perfume like characteristics. Drinkability is pretty good.

The nose is a combination of dark fruits like raisins and figs, candy sugar, slight banana, fruity esters, and you can smell the alcohol in this beer as well. The taste is quite complex with the main players being banana, dark fruit, caramel sweetness, vanilla, and some peppery spices. A really nice combination of flavors and they work really well together in this Quad. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite smooth with moderate carbonation, and I certainly get the warming alcohol on the mouthfeel as well. The drinkability is really quite nice for a beer that is 11.3% ABV, but it is a sipper and not your everyday type beer.","TheodorHerzl","Sep 08, 2008"

Taste is complex, some ripe fruits and malts, but on the sweet side. Texture is excellent, on the chewy side and is thick and heavy.

A biscuity base is also evident. A panoply of chocolate, caramel and licorice candies light up the taste buds in the front with some grapes and apples in the middle all followed by some invigorating spice and hops.

Tastes quite malty up front, with plum-like esters, chocolate/toffee, spices, and some medicinal phenols. This is a fresh bottle, and the alcohol is quite brazen.

Not as much weird earthy funkiness, but there's notes of apple skin, chocolate, plums, light raisin, and molasses. Yumm, this is much much better. This finish long with a yeast and minty herbal like quality on the back of the tongue. I can't even believe my old review.

The taste is much like the aroma but has a much bigger Belgian yeast flavor that then gives way to huge dark fruit flavors along with a bit of brown sugar and caramel.

4.67,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This bottle of goodness travelled all the way from southern Belgium, where it is brewed by one of the only Trappist Breweries in the world. Rochefort makes three Ales -- the 6, the 8, and the 10. I recently purchased a 10 at New Beer in Manhattan and aside from having sampled a large number of high powered Trappist ales in Antwerp over the summer, this is the most intense and amazing beer I've ever had, period. This is one of the few brews that I have had which are deserving of the ""Life is Beautiful"" tag. Whenever there's a beer that there's not much more to say about other than ""if you haven't had this, you haven't had beer," I'll just tag it like that to keep it simple. Rochefort 10 is full of amazing flavor like dried fruits and other dark and mysterious things. There's a ton of alcohol at almost 11.5% ABV, and you can taste it. But it doesn't matter, because you're literally swimming in a full bodied, complex, ocean of a beer that is the very blueprint for hundreds of imitators. Seek Rochefort now and seek it often.

Taste is rather dry, though this is a malt oriented beer. It is also slightly spicy, with a bit of heat from the alcohol. There is a bit of oak like character to the beer, along with a slight amount of earthyness. The hop profile is very mild. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are quite smooth. For its alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer, though for maximum enjoyment (and at $5.50 for a 11.2oz bottle) it is best enjoyed once per drinking session IMO. A fantastic trappist ale that I plan to buy again.","tronester","May 09, 2008"

This reminds me of drinking whiskey. Very warming to the throat and mouth. The flavor isn't as deep and complex as i thought it was going to be. It mostly just tastes like dark ripe fruit and alcohol. It does taste better as it warms though but still mostly one dimensional. Similar to cough syrup. Slightly drying.

Flavors similar to nose; however somewhat of a medicinal quality detected. Not really alcohol-laden, but more herbal in nature.

Ive had the 6,8 and the 10 and i really think this is the best one it seems to be more mature than the others. I had 2 bottles and i let one age for a bout 5 months after the first and the only thing i remember being different between the 2 was the sediment on the bottle.

Smooth and creamy with a nice carbonation that really only pops up in the finish along with the 11.3% alcohol it's packing. Definitely a sipping beer.

I got some good news today so I decided to pop the bottle in celebration. This one has aged for about a year and poured into my chimay chalice a nice deep brown with a touch of ruby around the edges. The head rose to about 2 1/2 inches then slowly dropped to a solid layer of tight foam that covers the top. The smell is rich boozy raisins and other fruits giving great promise. The taste is rich with chocolaty notes along with sweet dark fruits. There is a very familiar flavor here that I cannot put my finger on but it is fantastic all around. Alcohol is present only in the background and as a slight warming at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and lush, precisely what I would want in a beer that is extraordinarily complex and delicious.

4.85,7.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Decanted into a Rochefort goblet, the beer appears as a slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with deep crimson hues. A voluminous head emerges of a light sandy tan color that nearly spills over the rim of the goblet. An absolutely gorgeous beer in every way. The nose is an explosion of sweet tropical fruits (pear, banana, mango), some candy-like characteristics reminiscent of bubble gum and hard Christmas candy. Underpinning these notes, a solid caramelized malt base is evident. This is one of the most enjoyable beers to sniff you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying, without a doubt. The palate is a myriad of complex flavors that wholly embody the essence of what a Belgian strong dark ale ought to be. Roasted coconut, spicy banana and pear, subtle floral hops, and a wonderfully rich, warm alcohol presence. Some rich chocolate-like flavors add to the incredible complexity of this beer. The mouth feel is no more than medium and not cloying in the least, even with the aggressive sweet candi and fruit elements. This beer contains a good amount of carbonation, leaving the finish clean and rather dry with some residual alcohol warmth lingering long. This is, without a single doubt, one of the finest beers I've ever sampled regardless of style or origin. This beer is the pinnacle of the Trappist brewer's art, in my opinion. Nearly perfect, the much sought-after Westvleteren 12 really has nothing on this beer. If you want to taste Trappist brewing perfection, you really can't do any better than the best of the Rochefort beers, and one of the best in the world, Rochefort 10.","beerphilosopher","Feb 12, 2008"

The taste is smooth with creamy roasted malt finish. A caramel flavor with Belgium yeastyness is noticeable. The mouthfeel is soft with a smooth maltyness, light medium body and delicate carbonation.

Thick, really thick, off-white and creamy head with great retention and lacing. The overall look in the cup is amazing. Smell is good but a little too much alcohol in it, but I guess thats to be expected with such a high ABV. Also some chocoalte, roasted grain, raisin, and touch of rum in the smell. Taste is wonderfully complex. Tingles at first and then lead to a nice caramel and chocolate taste on the tounge and leaves a raisin like warming sensation as it goes down. The first sip was amazing I must say. As it warms I started noticing more alcohol and some sweet sugar. I would say mouthfeel is medium with a nice aftertaste and somewhat thick presence left behind. Drinkability I can only give a 3.5 due to the cost and high ABV. Overall a tremendous beer, while not my highest rated beer of the first 100, its probably in the top 10, just as it is in the Top 100 list. Enjoy this beer slowly.","bunnyhustle","Dec 26, 2007"

Pours a nice brownish/red with a massive amount of yeast. (awesome) Smell is fruity like cherries and other dark fruits. Taste is definately almost a wine. Class is close to a barleywine in my opinion. Very sweet though with little to no noticeable hops to finish off the palate. A very different type than I'm used to, but I very much appreciate the craftsmanship put into this superb brew. Very pleasant and light. A very drinkable but sipper of a brew.

I read somewhere that the monastery that produces this fine beverage puts it in the bottle right after fermentation, so I didn't want to review it being so ""green"". The beer poured into my Chimay goblet had a dense, dark brown color. The head that sat atop the brew was a soft, pillowy white. The aroma had a lot of fruity esters resembling raisins. There was a slight hint of sour in the aroma as well. The scent of toasted grains comes through nicely. The alcohol was definitely present in the aroma, but it had a sweet, belgian candi sugar quality that made it pleasant. There was no hop aroma. The flavor was a very intense maltiness. The flavor of dark, dried fruits was barely present. There was a great alcohol warmth with every sip, coupled with the carbonation, giving the beer a great mouthfeel. There were really no hop flavors that I could detect. The beer finished very dry, leaving a bread-like feel in your mouth. This was a very, very good beer. As to be expected from the Trappists.

Absolutely wonderful. However, the smell was just a warm up for the taste that followed. Delicious Mediterranean fruits, such as plums, figs, and raisins make appearances. Not a trace of bitterness.

The smell is average for Quads: vanilla, hint of coca-cola (yep, I'm crazy), and figs. The taste is heavy for a quad. Definitely not on the sweet side: vanilla, some nuts, and then a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is great. Feels like heavy cream. This is a very drinkable beer.","wardough","Nov 28, 2007"

Taste follows with a nice chocolate, vanilla, and caramel, nutty dessert bread flavor, nice and yeasty, some apple flavor before a biting alcohol warms and drys the throat in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a peppery effervescence of carbonation tingles on the tongue and builds to a foam in the mouth.

This beer doesn't look like it wants to be in my glass the huge billowing head rises four fingers above the cloudy mahogany colored liquid and that head isn't going anywhere any time soon. The smell is wonderfully complex, dominated by dark fruit from plums to raisins followed by more light fruit and pulled together by some phenols and alcohol spice. The taste is upfront prickly alcohol and peppery spice maybe a bit of hops but it seems to be mainly the alcohol. Incredibly warming but not ""hot"". Hidden beneath the alcohol is an incredibly full maltiness which suggests of dark bread. The fruit stays in there but it isn't as noticeable as it is in the nose overall the flavor is amazingly vinous, on taste I would take this over that $100 bottle of wine any day. The warming tingly yet deliciously smooth mouthfeel is pretty wild, not too light not too heavy just dead on. OK it's not a session beer but damn this is a treat worth every cent. Let me admit that I was a bit skeptical about this beers very high rating and wondered how much of it was hype. Let me tell you that after drinking one myself, I've become a true believer. Rochefort 10 is the real deal give it a try and you wont be disappointed.","fank2788","Sep 24, 2007"

Tastes very malty with hints of caramel and vanilla. Lots of roasted malts with a nice balance of hoppy bitterness. Hops are not overpowering at all; very subdued.

The first sip reveals some roasted malts and earthiness up front and ending with a hoppy bitterness and citric balance. Burnt brown sugar sweetness, anise, nutty malts, and aspartame shows up as it warms. The finish is long with notes of chary, hazelnut, nutty malt, and faint espresso. The alcohol burn is moderate for a 11.3, but this would make it a gem after some aging.

Full bodied with slightly dry texture, a little fizzy and clearly alcoholic finish. This is a tasty beer that is not as amazing as I was expecting considering the high cost of a small bottle.

While it is common to cellar this big Belgian brew I must say that the fresher Belgium bought counterpart is superior as it lacks the oxidation that I feel detracts from the rich flavors of the quadruple. Wherever you buy it from it pours a dark mahogany with a hint of ruby on the edges. The head is not exactly consistent with some I have dissipating quickly while others lingering for a whileeither way, it is a slightly dark tan. This is one of those rare brews that show the best of beer can hold its own against the complexities of fine wine. You will certainly notice the strong molasses sugar notes from the candy sugars used in brewing. Plums, black cherry, leather, raisins and hints of roasted malts play on the tongue. The alcohol will not miss the senses as its flavor blends into the overall character and leaves the mouth and throat warm without burning in a pleasant balance that lets you know you are drinking something substantial and brewed with the alcohol balance only mastery of brewing accomplishes.","bensiff","Jul 23, 2007"

There is a sweet, almost flowery characteristic as well, not the typical floral hop aroma. Taste is amazing, dark fruit, esters, and sweet malts. The finish is sharp, with a hop bite. Alcohol is present, quite spicy and very warming. There is a strong yeast character in the aftertaste.

The taste comes through to me as dark whole grain toast with some sweet, but very dark rum/molasses notes. I get a very strong yeasty flavor that I associate with homebrew. This beer is very dry, and very well carbonated. It will linger after each sip and reveal new sensations.

On the palate... mmm... so rich, so smooth... satin and silk with a heavenly mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet, but is not the least bit cloying IMO. The flavors replicate the nose, with lots of cherries, caramel and chocolate. This beer is very rich and very long, with a very long, lingering finish. This beer is a real sipper, which only makes sense given the abv.

Smells very rich -- chocolate, that familiar Rochefort yeast, and raw alcohol. Some faint fruit notes in the vein of figs or dates. On the palate, rich, malty mocha notes overlaid with figgy fruits, phenols and spice. The flavors are huge, refined, and are lent a boozy intensity by the raw alcohol that comes out in the mid-palate and burns through the finish. Mouthfeel is very full with alcohol, carbonation and smooth malts that are a huge step up in thickness from the Rochefort 6 and 8. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. All the different elements are in balance, and all those elements are compelling in and of themselves.

The head was small but a constant carb stream kept a foam in the center throughout. The smell was heavy on plums and raisins. I saw someone describe it as port-like and would tend to agree. Was very sweet smelling and you could get hints of the ABV. The taste was also very sweet from start to finish with a little bitter at the end to tone down the sweet. The alcohol definitely comes thru in the taste but isn't too overpowering. Overall, it has a good taste and a 33cl bottle is more than enough. Anything more than that and I know the sweetness and high ABV would get to more. Pretty warm feeling as it is. Highly recommend you try it. I can see this as an annual treat for me.

Taste as it smells, starts sweet, bold and rich in malt, dried fruit such as plums, prunes and raisins. Molasses and a strange hint of tobacco (copenhagen) in the medium.

Tasted again of alcohol, more dried fruits, and maybe a hint of oxidation. Was smooth up front, with a somewhat bitter, warming alcohol finish. Very tasty.

Absolutely exceptional creamy mouthfeel for a beer this strong. Alcohol is well-hidden and has perfect carbonation with a great finish. This could be dangerous because of how easy it goes down. Finish has a dry moderate bitterness with a full body. Hops are tasted more and more with each sip thorughout half the beer. This is very drinkable and a beer not for amatuers. About 3/4 through and I'm feeling the effects of the 11.30 ABV already. This was bought at Town & Country Liquors in West Springfield,Mass. for $6.99/bottle.

Most of the taste is malt and a residual sweetness as you might expect. There are also some spicy phenolic notes and the slight bite of alcohol.

An incredible combo of ripened banana and sweet malt warms you as it finishes remarkably with mild black pepper notes (Normally I might not be thrilled with a black pepper description, but the softness and complexity of the taste is fantastic). The mouth feel was heavy, as you might expect of a quad, but the smoothness throughout this huge beer is what solidifies it's ""5" status for me. Indicative of the style, flavorful cheeses thrive when paired with this beer. I enjoyed it with a plate of gorgonzola ravioli, using a fairly neutral butter herb sauce so the cheese shines through....of course one could pair it only with a little Port Salut cheese, and be in for a terrific night...Enjoy","Greenfloyd","Jan 24, 2007"

Smells are winey, malty, a little sour, and with notes of dark spices. Taste starts out with prunes, cinammon, stewed fruit, and progresses to a delicious yeasty taste, brown sugar and a late hit of spicy hops. Absolutely wonderful. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy and smooth, with no discernable alcohol, especially considering the whopping 11.3% abv. Tremendously drinkable.

It poured very, very dark (even held up to light it was difficult to see the yeast particles dancing). It fizzed quite loudly and suddenly into the glass, but on the first taste, as I braced for carbonation overhaul, surprisingly found the carbonation no more than a beautiful dancing upon the tongue. Magic, friends, pure magic. And the tastewell, as it warmed the taste grew in complexities that I cannot dare to describe. Sweet dates and figs dance upon the palate, but the sweet taste did not overwhelmneither did the bitter kick. I am quite partial to that bitter kick, but did not miss it here in favor of the amazing taste of this ale. Highly drinkable, only be careful friends, as the unnoticeable alcohol creeps up and by the end of only one glass I was surprised by the pleasant buzz.","uncle8gil","Dec 28, 2006"

Color is deep ruby brown, impenetrable except at the edges where a touch of light shows through. The sticky ecru head is durable but a bit thin, perhaps owing to an overly gentle pour. Slightly leathery, prune-raisin dried fruit aroma, mild hints of chocolate and whisky-like phenols. The first sips start fizzy and sweet, evolving into a phenolic bite and prominent alcohol warmth, turning into almost a sting in the aftertaste. As I let it warm and breathe a bit, the carbonation mellows and some port, sherry, oaky flavors come through. Still, the bitey aspect at the end of the sip sticks around, and I wonder if it's actually something to do with the grain (like a lot of Biscuit malt).

It continues with the slightest sour notes - green apple and dark cherry. Just a tiny bit of bitterness finishes. There's a lot going on here and it all comes together wonderfully.

Smells like a punch in the face nessled between lushes medieval breasts. It smells of toffee, chocolate, banana (not in the way a tripel smells of banana, but as in a real banana) hints of raison, vanilla, Belgian yeast, maybe a tinge of hops if you really search for it, and sort of a sherry sent. The taste is milky, slinky, some mild bitterness, a complex richness that coats the mouth, with sweetness and a finish of young bananas. This is a monster of a beer, one must be careful or it will kick your ass.

Huge complex aroma. Tastes of yeast, bready, ripe dark fruits, nutty, caramel, hints of chocolate, even cherries, a tad of spiciness like clove. Taste is everywhere. Deliciously complex. Every sip brings about a new hint of some other flavor, like anise for example, that I just picked up in my current sip. Ends with a noticeable alcohol warming, which from experience fades away to absolute smoothness with a bit of aging. Mouthfeel is slippery, creamy, pretty carbonated. I could have one of these everyday, but that would be it. Even though it is one of the best beers I have ever had in my life, it is still 11.3% ABV which takes away from the drinkability factor.

I originally thought it was from a bit extra sparkling carbonation from the bottle conditioning, but as the spicy-ness showed up later in the beer, I thought that might have had something to do with it as well. The alcohol in this beer was awesome. About 20-30 seconds after a sip, a nice warming feeling would come from the belly. At no point was the alcohol off putting in this one, it was barely detectable besides the warming, which in turn makes this the definition of a dangerously drinkable beer at 11.3%.

Beautiful aroma is almost too complex to describe - notes of apricot, raisin, chestnut, sweet dark malt, lactose, and more than a little alcohol. Palate is simply wonderful - a huge smile came across my face with the first sip. Rich, sweet malt, dark fruit, a touch of spiciness, all mixing in perfect harmony. Beautifully creamy mouthfeel is just absolutely perfect - velvety smooth, without the thick, syrupy body that can overwhelm some of the stronger beers, along with a lightly dry finish.

Taste is complex, sweet and malty, alcohol brings some warming with it's presence, fruitier than the nose inclines.

They were both complex and sweet, with a slightly fruity alcohol taste, excellent body and mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor abound with hints of prune, date, and wonderful Belgian yeast esters. As much as I enjoyed the new bottle, aging for 3 years brought the beer close to perfection. The 10's alcohol bite isn't bad for a strong beer, but the older bottle was far smoother, balancing things out better and allowing the more complex flavors to be tasted.

Aroma is chocolate, molases, dark fruits, with some roasted notes. Flavor is chocolate, molases, figs, candi sugar, raisins, prunes, and cookie dough. An alcohol presence comes in the middle, and lingers through the end and finish. Roasted coffee and rum come in at the end. The finish is lasting, with warm to hot alcohol. Finish is semisweet from the lingering flavors of the fruits. The texture of this brew is wonderful, silky smooth and creamy, coating with a full mouthfeel. Has a low carbonation, but still has a soft fizz on the tongue. Wonderful beer, but I think the strong alcohol presence takes away from the beauty of this beer. I definately prefered the number 8 to this.","artusory","Apr 17, 2006"

Nose of rummy fruits: plum, strawberry, and maybe pear. Roasted malt underside. Sweet, sugary wheat and yeast with some alcohol spice. Complex and mouth-watering. Taste starts off with sweet, sugary fruit malts. Dark-edged and ripe, but with a sugary wheat side. Roastiness settles in and gives a little balance. Hoppish bitterness follows in a crescendo that ends with loud sugary malts and spicy, warming fruit alcohol. Wow. Long finish of licorice, wheat tang, fruit esters, and roasted hop bitterness. Rocky, volatile, tingly carbonation up front. Body is full with a mouth-covering feel. An incredible beer that can be dangerously drinkable at 11.3%.","alexgash","Apr 13, 2006"

4.7,4.2,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"The first aroma I get as soon as I pop the cap is musty green apple. The beer is a very dark garnet, and not transparent in the least. Near-black colouration actually. The head stayed solid as a nice thick layer of light brown, tight foam. It dimpled slightly but showed no signs of lessening at all. Thick styrofoam lacing that did not slide. World-class looking beer. The aroma is quite sweet up front, like fresh red grapes. Light nuttiness and dusty malts from above the rim of my chalice glass. The smell is even more sugary in close, but always under the veil of the musty yeast which softens and adds a table-cream nuance. The fruits are here: initially a little apple, then red grapes, pear, pineapple(yes), prunes, dates, figs, even light peach. Sniffing very closely gives the spicy phenols and some solvent alcohol. I find the earthy smell increases as the beer warms. Superbly complex malts. A new aroma with every tilt of the glass. As true with most of the great beers, there is a certain indescribable part of the nose too--almost a soft wood smell, or tree sap, maybe pine needles and a little clove? Almost medicinal at times, and it can be numbing to the nose after a bit, so take your time with this beast. In the background seems to float a little dried-beer aroma, like the smell of some beer in the bottom of a glass discovered the next day. Some roasted characteristics here too, but the malts are very creamy and soft, with little harshness. And for an 11% quadrupel, the alcohol is never overpowering. A definite cornucopia of aromas here though; incredible. The mouthfeel of this beer is layered in duplicity. It is full yet feels like whipped cream on the tongue. Delicate carbonation, and an intensely creamy texture. The first taste in the mouth is of some very deceivingly light malts, roasted but not bitter. The beer in the front of the mouth actually has very little flavour--the tip of my tongue registers more of its FEEL rather than its TASTE. In the middle comes some savoury maple, some brown sugar, a little milk chocolate, musty tannin-like dryness, and caramel cake. The alcohol shows itself a little near the end, but this tastes not even remotely close to a an over-11% ale. The malting is absolutely incredible: sweet, wine-like and filled with fresh bread and toffee/caramel flavours. The malts are not so much meaty as refined and balanced perfectly. The flavour exudes age, earthiness and dust. Any hopping is undetectable, and any dryness in the finish comes from the dark malts. This goes through the gullet to the stomach rather quickly; dangerously so. The 10 definitely warms the insides rapidly. This would be brilliant for a cold winter beer. Give me this over brandy or port anyday. Absolute liquid ambrosia here. Better than St Bernie 12 for me personally(the 12 has too much apple in the aroma). I am ecstatic to finally have this available in our province.","Cwrw","Apr 08, 2006"

Compared to the 8 the 10 is pretty similar. It pours with a generous, creamy latte colored foam and has a nice, very dark brown color. The smell is of fruity caramel and roasted malts.

Aroma of ripe fruits with malt laced with alcohol. Tasted very rich and fruity, with a sweet malty lingering finish and alcohol warming the throat and mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a surprisingly lively carbonation. Definately a 'sip and savour' beer - one for those cold evenings when the rain is lashing against the windows.

There is everything from caramel to dried fruits (raisens dates etc) There is also a strong alcohol aroma but it just strong enough and not too strong. The taste is where this beer really stands out. It has everything you could want. It's smooth it has a myriad of flavors to explore (very woody as well as the fruits and nuts taste).

There was also some vanilla aromas and a slight whiskeyish smell lingering here and there as well. Taste brought out the dark fruit even more, especially as it warmed. I also picked up on some sherry and molasses flavors that were excellent. Mouthfeel was relatively heavy, starting off very juicy and ending with a slight tart twang.

Not unpleasant by any means, some slight hints at Oaky woodiness in the background but the alcohol is the main component here. Overall a good high ABV beer which is pleasant tasting and gorgeous, but it didn't blow me away by any means.","masikon","Jan 04, 2006"

Foam develops and fills over half the glass. Carbonation bubbles appear large in size. Aroma through lots of foam is of nuts and spices. Taste is a litle of cardboard perhaps damaged in the shipment? Mouthfeel is exquisite, very silky smooth. Taste is of nuts, very subdued not overpowering in any way. Taste is a little like grapeseed. This reminds me of Westy 12 a little bit. High ABV is hidden very well. No alcohol burn. A little bit of evaporating alcohol if held on the tongue for a while.","mjohn27603","Dec 30, 2005"

Tastes mostly of sweet toffee and caramels, with raisins and plum and a small hint of the usual trappist breadiness thrown in for good measure.

It was rather like an experience ot sorts. Huge creamy head above a dark amber liquid. Strong smell of dried figs, raisins- all kinds of sweetness. The smell of alcohol was also enormous. The beer started too cold to really get a take of it's flavor, so I let it sit for a while. It almost hard to describe how it tastes. It's jst so flavorful, with loads of carmel/ brown sugar sweetness balanced by almost a spicey note. It all works. It's a sipping beer, and really you can only have one.

Pretty intense carbonation hits you at first, a bitter, acidic taste but it fades very quickly, leaving a complex taste of yeasts, malt, almost molasses, bready grain taste, alcohol, small hints of dark fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent, with a very unique smoothness that developed with tempterature. It was extremely full-bodied, with a subtle semi-sweet aftertaste that was excellent.

Smell is amazingly complex; almost weissbier like banana/clove esters and phenols abound, grapefruit, oaky vanilla, lots of malt, slight hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy, banana and clove once again, alcohol, earthy, oaky vanilla again, tastes oak aged, honey, a little bitterness from the hops but those take a back seat. Almost an armagnac vinousity (word?) to it, amazing. Very full mouth, warms all the way down, thick and chewy, perfect carbonation. This is one killer beer.","Viggo","Jul 19, 2005"

It seems the yeast jumped into suspension when the bottle was opened due to the heavy carbonation. Sweet grape/pear, sherry, and yeast in the nose. Taste resembles the nose with the sherry flavor standing out over the others. Not overpowering, but distinct sherry overtones. Dry finish, slightly tart. Nice blend of flavor. The head is ever replenishing and maintains throughout drinking. Zero lacing on the glass? Looks can be deceiving on this one. Ignore the chunks of yeast and enjoy this one.","sacfly","Jul 19, 2005"

It has layers of citrus (grapefruit/orange/lemon), and is finished by figs and dates from the malt. The taste has more of the bread dough followed quickly by the spice and citrus. The citrus combines with the malt in the flavor to produce red wine like flavors. Dark berries, plums, accompanied by slight alcohol warming. Wow! Amazing flavor, much more than even the nose indicated. Slick, lightly heavy mouth feel, decent drinakbility.","carln26","Jul 04, 2005"

Flavors noted include candied sugar, bananas, hint of pepper, dark fruits, finishing with a nice dry hop. Mouthfeel is creamy and full with a high amount of carbonation to light up the palate even more. Overall drinkability is near perfect.

Only disappointment in the appearence was the small head. What was there laced pretty well. Deep effervescent chocolate amber colour made up for the disappointing head. Aroma, um, well, big! Spices, toffee, raisins, flowers, alcohol... Taste - um, well, huge! And it needs to be to get in before the alcohol which is considerable and smacks you in the face at the finish. Despite the big, warm, dry, (kinda like Australia) alcoholic finish, the balance remains very good, which is a big achievement. I think this is assisted by the fine carbonation which leads to a lush yet subtle feel. Would love to taste the same batch in 2009 to see what has changed.

Since then, I've seen numerous threads such as ""St. Bernardus vs. Rochefort"" or ""Westvleteren vs. St. Bernardus."" I haven't come across the Westy yet, but the Rochefort is always around so I thought I'd give it a try and see if it lives up to the hype. Let's crack this puppy open... Appears a very dark brown color, practically opaque with a big dark head resting on top, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Incredibily fragrant nose. A sweet cake-liek aroma out front, but no ordinary cake. It tingles your nose with hints of alcohol and spicyness. If this tastes as good as it smells I'll be a very happy man... Oh man it's good. Instead of comparing it to St. Bernardus it's really quite different. I can actually taste the alcohol in this and the spicy hops as well. Still the overriding taste is the sweetness, complex as it is, but there's a nice peppery quality to this beer that I didn't anticipate. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with the perfect amounth of carbonation. I don't know what it is, but there certianly is a distinct trappist feel to this beer that I wish I could identify and put into words, but I can't.

Served just under room temp. in a Chimay chalice. Pours a cloudy dark red/brown with a fizzy, 1 finger, tan head that doesn't leave much lacing but doesn't disappear either. Smell is rum bread, cherries, bananas, green apples, and maybe a hint of chocolate. At first the carbonation is tingly but is very nice by the end. And so many flavors on the palate... cherries, plums, apples, bananas, pears?, citrus?, coriander?, chocolate, rum, pine, yeast... whew! The beer also alternates between buttery/sugary/sweet and a somewhat powerful bitterness, both of which complement the other flavors well. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but very warming.

After talking to many belgium people at the different festivals I found that many of them like this it's just what they call a beerwine. So I took that to heart and treated it like wine before every drink I will swish it around and smell it, for me that is enough, I'm in love. The taste is phenomenal with just that right bitter taste that from much research comes from the water. The fruitiness of this is bar none only to westvleteren which also has a distinct fruity taste.

4.62,2.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is dark brown with some red with lingering sediment running about the glass. The chunky, bubbly cream-colored head dissipates slightly but is retained in about a 2mm thickness throughout the drink. Lacing is present and sturdy but not overwhelming. Carbonation is certainly evident upon first sip but its run over with a rummage of caramel, paper early, yeast, fruitiness, and tempered hops. The smell is as busy as the taste. Taste is light spice, molasses, raisin, maybe plum. The 10 is eminently creamy smooth and drinkable considering its ABV. Goodness. Top shelf. Beer heaven.

Interesting fruity, esterous aroma. Taste takes the aroma to another level. Smooth malt character quickly gives way to flavors of banana and other fruits, with a slightly spicy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tremendous, and drinkability is excellent as well. Scarily drinkable for 11.3%, the alcohol hardly comes out at all, except for the subtle warming after you've had a few mouthfuls.

There is the malty fig flavor, but it is balanced with a caramel sweetness and a smokey char finish. What a treat. Well worth the hype and the wait to drink it. Now I have to convince myself to let it warm a bit more before I finish it to see what else is hiding in the nose and flavor. The beer is thick with just a hint of small carbonation.

There is also a couple of notes spiciness to the scent and a couple of other smells that were not identified. Leading the way in the taste is a fruity sweetness that is also accompanied by a doughy malt flavor and slight bit of spice. It has a bit of a dry finish and a buttery taste going on as well. Very refreshing to sip on this warm day and no trace of alcohol anywhere. Mouthfeel is rich and about medium to full in body. It goes down very easy and is a very balanced beer.

The aroma is deliciously fruity, with plums, cherries, raisins, and licorice notes. The taste is delicately balanced between fruitiness of the malt and spiciness of the yeast. There are also notes of brown sugar on the palette. The mouthfeel is very creamy due to the fineness of the carbonation.

But I can't afford any more than that. This was a very dark beer for a Belgian and it had a nice, frothy tan head to show its carbonation. Lots of lacing. Smell is strong and has a raisiny, bready flavor to it. Taste is just too complex to describe. It starts out with a tang hit of chocolate and caramel malts. Some floral hops come lightly into the mix. A bready character soon follows. Then fruity sensations run wild. Dark plums and raisins dominating my palate. A rum-like quality is there all along but only increases to epic proportions towards the end. Yeast is quite sour and extremely dry in the finish. This is a beer to savor and sip, very slowly. The only drawback was the price for this. At $10/bottle I can't afford too many of these!","granger10","Jan 20, 2004"

Lots of dark roasted candi sugar and malt in the nose, coffee and fruit. Taste is complex; smooth, rich and amazing. So many changes in the palate as one sips. Malt sweet and candi raisin and currant, yet maintaining a dryness that is fantastic. I've had this beer a couple of times and it's just really, really good. It's dated 26 08 08 (b.b.

The smell of this beer presents so many thoughts, but they all seem to meld together perfectly. The smells are subtle and elusive. Malts are present, with ints of chocolate, various fruits, coffee, and some meaty spices. The taste is very spicy, again almost meaty, with the chocolate hints again, and nutty coffee hints. The heavy carbonation of tiny bubbles gives it a dry mouthfeel which smooths out on the back. Amazingly I thought it was maybe 8% ABV until my brother told me that it was tipping 11%.

4.92,9.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This is damn near a perfect beer and that is despite its massive ABV. The 10 poured a odd group of colors. Stout black with a foggy white head at first glance. A closer look revealed the top of the glass to be more a brown color with the bottom opaque. Smell was insanely good. A huge bevy of aromas melded so well together. Swirls of licorice, chocolate, dough, a musty ""belgianesque"" note, and a spicy alcohol finish that tickled the back of my nose. The taste was even more intense if that is possible. Huge notes of alcohol and anise coupled with a bittersweet chocolate upfront with hints of toffee behind cascading into a tart cherry middle, which developed into a almost stout like malt finish without the volumonous mouthfeel. The addition of the yeast subdued the mouthfeel but melded and increased the intesity of all the flavors, especially in the aroma.

The mouthfeel is very enjoyable-at once enveloping the entire mouth with warmth and bursts of barnyard flavors. Flavors are redolent of Blue Cheese-funky, moldy, fruity, yes very much blue cheese esc. I'd bet it would pair like a dream. A sweetness in the way of coffee with heavy cream and sugar adds to the complexity. All in all very wine like in flavor with great depth of flavor. The ever present fruity funkiness will not be for everyone, straight off that is. Yet, this is one that will grow on you for sure. I will re-edit it each time I taste it.

Very tasty palate with loads of alcohol spiciness (upfront) that sizzles the tongue a pleasant pain! Peppery, lightly funky-medicinal the amount of bitterness is great. The maltiness is not as pronounced as I though it should be, lightly sweet like candied sugar. Exotic fruitiness. There are plenty of subtle complexities so delicious to drink!

Heavenly complex aroma: oak, port wine, dried fruit and spices. 5.0 points for aroma/smell is not enough! Flavour is complex, spicy and oaky - toffee sweetness is well balanced with hops. Warming mouthfeel, otherwise the high ABV is well hidden. Long lasting aftertaste. Can't find any faults with the beer - therefore a straight 5.0. Does that imply that any ""perfect"" beer has to be as strong as Rochefort 10? Certainly not - but in the strong division, this one is in the lead, at least untill I have sampled Westvleteren...

Not really as big of a smell as I was expecting. The taste is fairly malty with raisins and plums coming right out. There is some hops and alcohol to the finish.

A sweet chocolate aroma presents itself, as notes of nuts and yeast are subdued but present nevertheless. Taste is sweet, nutty, yeasty, alcoholic, and overall delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is very well balanced. For a beer of its ABV, this one drinks way too easily and can put one on his ass if he is not careful.

I would recommend the 52-58F serving temp stated on the bottle. Only a little carbonated bite. Really wonderful mouth feel. Fruit, malt, fig or plum.

It's a beautiful, deep ruby. The smell is ripe fruit, most notably raisin and cherry, and a bit of spice. Ripe fruit and peppery flavors come through with just a hint of licorice.

The taste was mildly sweet, vinous and fruity (apples, grapes, figs, raisins), with malt and alcohol flavors. The flavors blended wonderfully to give a very mellow experience.

Sometimes the alcohol was hidden, and if it was like that throughout, this beer would have scored much higher. I tasted a whole lot of alcohol through most of this beer. It was not welcomed in that quantity. Besides that, this is an excellent beer. It is everything you would want from a belgian dark ale. Full bodied, with a great aroma and masses of flavor.

Once again, the alcohol is quite noticeable from the first sip. And thenwell, theres a *lot* going on. Bready body, tastes of molasses, pepper, raisin and plum, pear and banana, all undergirded by a solid chocolate/caramel maltiness. Finishes with a strong hit of leafy hop flavor.

Finishes with a complexity rarely tasted in most ales of any style, with a chocolatey sweetness that gives way to a very appetizing dryness that begs another long sip...one of Belgium's (and the world's) finest beers, one of the all-time greats!

One thing that ""turned me on"" was the sight of the beautiful dark color and a creamy brown head. The head was supper thick at first, but subsided into a film-like substance. The taste was of heavy vanilla, fruit, nuts, and a hint of alcohol taste. The nutty vanilla taste stays around for a while after you swallow and leaves a little tinge on the tounge.

5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Rochefort 10 pours a pleasant chestnut brown with a rich tan head. The head leaves a beautiful lace pattern on the glass. Tha aroma is dried fruits with alcohol and background floral notes. The taste starts off with a rich malty flavor that is well balanced with flavors of dried cherries and plums. The finish is very flowery and dry with alcohol and apple/pear being the dominant flavors. The aftertaste is alcohol warmth lingering with malty sweetness and faint notes of raisin. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation. This is one of the worlds greatest beers. Smooth, easy to drink, and one of the most complex of the Trappist beers. If you get the chance to try one of these, do it at any cost.","purplehops","Dec 14, 2002"
4.82,6.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Deep brown color, with a huge tan head of tiny bubbles, sweet and fruity aroma, sweet and malty, flavors of dark fruit and caremel, full thick robust mouthfeel and some what chewy, just about perfectly balanced. I will have another one.","maxpower","Dec 10, 2002"
4.42,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer poured a very dark brown color and formed an light tan bubbly head that left some lace. An aroma of malt, plum, raisins and spice. A flavor of malt and spice with some fruit element plus you can detect the presence of the alcohol and it's warming effect comes through in a tart finish that hints at heavy carbonation being present. This is by far the best of the three of theirs that I have tried. Thanks again to the Ohio lawmakers for letting us get this.","Wildman","Dec 04, 2002"
4.55,0.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a deep brown colour topped by a nice thick head that settles down rather easily. Aroma of this dark strong ale consists of chocolate and strong alcohol aroma (afterall the ABV is 11.5%). Chocolate and alcohol are the dominants of the flavour of this beer. Mouthfeel is quite strong with heavy carbonation... One of the finest dark strong ales of Belgium","ipogios","Nov 30, 2002"
4.15,-8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Cloudy deep brown / amber with a very persistant and lacy head... aroma of plums and chocolate... oh, and a whole lot of alochol... almost reminds me of brandy. Flavor is very heavily dominated by the alcohol, with some fruity flavors and a touch of chocolate coming through. Sweet and tart, but not at all cloying or overstated. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a lot of effervescence... this beer is just loaded with carbonation, and fills the mouth like a champagne. This is a very good, and unique brew... not quite the pinnacle of beer excellence, but definatley a very good beer.","zerk","Nov 26, 2002"
4.77,5.8,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"""ZAP, ZING, PFLOT, and ZOWIE"" Batman, where has this great beer been hiding, ""GUSLER"" you ""CHUMP", yes ""CHIMAY"" is great, but this beer ""Whips It's ARSE"". Deep, dark, and quite handsome is this beer! majestic beige head, lace in thick clinging sheets, the nose is that of a ""5 Star"" brandy, fruity, sweet. Start is heavenly sweet, the top is skimpy, the finish is pertinently hopped, strong alcohol dry aftertaste, potently acidic, and ""Just one spectacular Brew"".","Gusler","Nov 18, 2002"
4.37,-3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer got me by surprise with it's powerful aroma and flavor.  It is possible that it wasn't as fresh as it could have been because it didn't have any lasting head or lace to speak of.  The appearance was a bit hazy.  My homebrew dubbel looks better...  The flavor was very complex, though.  I don't have much experience in describing beers, but the words sweet, sour, and alcoholic come to mind.  Rochefort 10 is a good treat once in a while.  It must be drunk nearly at room temperature to experience everything that's going on in this brew.  Served cold, it has a nasty bite, as do most of the Belgian and/or dark ales I've tried.  The mouthfeel after swallowing this beer reminded me of whiskey or even a strong wine.  Something keeps me coming back to Rochefort, although there are many others I haven't tried yet.","JasonStrauss","Oct 13, 2002"

4.13,-8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Hazy dark brown hue, topped by a thick, well retained very dense tan head.  Dense, heterogenous lace is left down the glass.  Bubblegum esters and mellow chocolate dominate the aroma, but tart fruit, yeast mustiness and whiffs of peppery alcohol add complexity.  Flavorwise, banana esters and assertive malt sweetness are perceptible initially, then are promptly ensued by deeply caramelized fruit notes reminescent of sugary prunes and dates. A combination of raisiny Special B and chocolate malt surfaces late, complementing the caramelized dark fruit flavors.  Hop bitterness is virtually absent and would be out of place in this malt driven brew.  Lightly bodied and agreeable in mouthfeel considering the strength-- the copious use of dark candi sugar is quite evident.  Finishes w/ bready malt notes and darts of spicy alcohol on the tongue.  Satisfying alcohol warmth grows progressively stronger and eventually coats the throat.  Rochefort 10 is certainly a delicious brew, but seems to lack the depth and drinkability of the ""lighter"" Rochefort 8.  It's intense and tasty, nevertheless.","marc77","Sep 15, 2002"
4.26,-5.5,5,4,4,5,4.5,"Unlike the Westy I didn't start this one too cold, and I was rewarded. What a great Ale. Like a liquid Fig Newton. Sweet, almost candy aroma. This is a beer to sit back, relax, and enjoy.","Dogbrick","Sep 13, 2002"
4.85,7.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy with a huge rocky head over a reddish-brown body. The nose is quite impressive! Extremely fruity with notes of  pears and bananas, as well as a big chunk of fresh bubblegum. The body is light/medium and it has a somewhat zesty mothfeel.The flavor is expansive with a silky, fruity maltiness that fills the mouth revealing a faintly milk-chocolate character just before a charge of hops coats the throat. The alcohol is noticeable but not obtrusive. The distinctively chocolatey flavor also comes through in a late, warming finish - accompanied by some vanilla, fruit and bready notes. An astonishingly complex beer that cannot be done justice with just words.","NeroFiddled","Aug 10, 2002"
4.73,4.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"I will compare this beer to Westvleteren 12 because they are similar beers. Rochefort is darker and more opaque. The head is a darker khaki. The head composition is unusual. The bottom is big bubbled but the bubbles get smaller the closer to the top until the top layer you can't see the individual bubbles and you just get a creamy foam. Because of the different bubble sizes you get a less creamy mouthfeel , but one where the feel of the bubbles plays a part. The aroma is that of a good porter with some spice and fruitiness. The flavor has a nice toffee maltiness with pears, chocolate and a dessert spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. It also has a brightness to the flavor that the Westy lacked. Like the Westy, surprisingly easy to drink for its strength.","aracauna","Aug 10, 2002"
4.62,2.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is a murky dark brown. Damn near black. Light only seems to get through on the edges. The head is thick, luscious, creamy and tan. This beer has a beautiful aroma. Dark fruits, dark malt and cotton candy all in the mix. And sweet cookie dough. Now this is a beer to savor. Beautiful taste as it hits the tongue. Sweet fruits meld in perfection with dark (slightly burnt?) malts and of course sugars (seemingly brown and dark candy). Barely a hint of alcohol. (And this is 11.5 a/v?) So damn smooth. And damn tasty to boot. One of the best Belgian beers I've ever had.","Bighuge","Jul 11, 2002"
4.9,8.6,5,5,5,5,4.5,"Magic in a glass.......Deep dark, ruby hints border the glass of this beauty. Thin fizzy tan head, that left after minute or two. Perfectly rich smell of carmel, cannied fruits, plums, and chocolate malt. Tasted much the same, incredible complex combination of roasted chocolate malt, fruit, carmel, cannied fruit and silky smooth mellow finish. This beer blankets your taste buds in happiness. High alcohol slides past, warms your belly and makes you happy. A perfectly balanced complex beer, the best I have had so far in my beer exploration. I saved this one for a special ocassion.............","StevieW","Jun 19, 2002"
4.65,3.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,4,"Deep chestnut brown, head settles in 25 seconds or so. Small bubbles but not fizzy. Aroma is just a touch vinous, nice rum and raisin notes, yeastiness is distinct and fresh flowery. Dense smoky raisin flavors, slightly like the smell but more restrained. Nice balance, not overly champagne-like or super sticky brandy. Finishes with a satisfying alcohol warming and coating property. Flavor impact like a see-saw, powerful at the beginning and end. There are some Belgian brews that rub me the wrong way (and many that don't), this hallowed ""cough syrup"" is not only an excellent example of a dark artisinal ale but a great tasting beer. Coated the wine goblet I used really nicely.","ADR","Apr 16, 2002"

While drinking my first mouthful I breathed in through my nose and tasted smooth, sweet, caramel and fruit, with a finish that spiced strongly of alcohol and faint black pepper. The crispness of this beer is so light, it reminds you of a chewier lambic, with a indescribable smoothness. Quite possibly one of the best beers in the world, but damned expensive.","hooligan","Nov 17, 2001"
5,10.9,5,5,5,5,5,"As one of the few best Belgian Trappists (maybe the best), this is one of those beers that deserves a place in the Hall of Fame just as Ripken, Henderson & Gwynn do.

Huge body, enormous malty yummyness with little hop to be found.  ALthough Todd and Jason mentioned a ""prickly alcohol"" presense, I did not get any of that. Mine was totaly smooth from begining to end. If it wasn't so expensive I would be drinking at least one of these a week. As it is, it is a wonderful treat to enjoy on occation.","mattmaples","Oct 05, 2001"
