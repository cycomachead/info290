"Screams ""fresh lemon", a nice summer beer when you're not in the mood for heavy drinking (or any drinking at all, almost)."

"Body feels a bit watery."
"Picked this up at La Capsule Cave à Bière in Nancy, France. Slightly hazy golden yellow pour with a quickly fading one finger head with decent lacing. Really nice fruity, hoppy nose with the Citra really standing out along with hints of grapefruit and grass. The taste is hoppy and citrusy as well with hints of peach, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, pine, orange peel, and just a touch of grass. Just enough caramel malt sweetness to keep it balanced. The mouthfeel is light and crisp and totally refreshing. Fizzy carbonation with a nice tangy, bitter hop finish. Overall, this totally hit the mark as a low ABV summer session beer. Flavorful and refreshing and extremely drinkable. Another great beer from To Øl!"
