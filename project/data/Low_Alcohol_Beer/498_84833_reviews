"Having said that, Bavaria 0.0% is perhaps *the* most heinous NA beer I've encountered. Sweet and corny and metallic and sour and just tremendously unpleasant in every way I can think of."

"This is better than I thought. It is very drinkable and I plan to go back to it. However Pilseners are not my favorite style and I think it is a tad too sweet and I would enjoy a stronger hop flavor and bitterness."

"Overall, not a good one, I drunk it in big gulps to make the torture end sooner."
"Well, not really all that offensive, given the lack of the one true ingredient that might give one cause for giving a shit about this offering. It guess the straight-up graininess, without the gag-worthy sweet booziness (the usual Bavaria trademark) shows how things really could be, given a more deft hand at the controls."
"Bavaria Regular 0.0% is not the worst Low-Alcohol beer out there. But neither is it in the same league as what I consider good ""near-beers."" It has an appetizing list of ingredients, but turns out to be unbalanced and far too sweet. Give it a try, but don't buy a six-pack."
"Blech! Not good - if I needed to stay off the booze I'd drink something else. This is horrid; sweet cooked grain and off-notes. Flavour and aroma-wise it barely resembles beer. The watery body doesn't add anything. Imagine a macro lager, then subtract what little substance remains. Voila - you have Bavaria 0.0%! Avoid at all costs."
