"Everything to expect from an NA"
""
"Somehow this was a lot better than expected. Someone gave it to me when I said I didn't want a Busch Light 'because I had to drive.' I had never had an NA beer before, so this was new. Not a lot of flavor, as you might guess. It's not offensive or awful though. This of course isn't bound to be a favorite of BAs, but I bet there are worse examples out there."
"Busch NA Brewed by Anheuser-Busch. This brew has an ABV of less than 0.50%  It is known as a  Non Alocholic/ Low Alcohol Beer. The brew pours out a light amber color with a small white head.  The smell is light with grains and malts.  Busch NA has a nice light taste, but you pick up on some grains an malts. The mouthfeel is light and thin.  Also most like water.  For what it is worth this is not a bad brew. If you are looking for a brew with Low alcohol then this is the brew for you. This one of the better NA brews on the market. Overall I'm giving this brew a solid 3.5 out of 5."
"Overall : The box is decorated with awards. I wouldnt go that far. It is however, better than Busch light and has less calories to boot. Not as good as Busch regular of course, and thats to be expected. Sure, I'd have another."

"Bland, boring, lacking in flavor, aroma, and body, looks like pee.  No lacing, decent carbonation, maintained a 1 1/2 finger head for a little while before dissipating into a thin film .  Tastes of slightly sour corn and cooked vegetables.  Good for quenching your thirst or washing down cheap pizza and burgers and not much else, with half the calories of a soda.  Drinks like water."
"O: Not bad but I did not have very high expectations for this beer - at least it tastes like beer and is not as watery as some of the lights beers from BMC breweries."

"The nose is grainy malts with a clean crispiness at the end. The taste is about the same with a subtle sweetness too. The body is light. It is comparable to other low alcohol beers in its class and it is reasonably priced."
"Overall a good value and nothing unpleasant for the style. Just not much flavor."

"By no means is this a great, hell even a good beer. But if you can't drink or if you are the designated driver and want that beer ""feel", this is as close as it gets."

"This na was responsible for helping me get through a 90 day ""NO ALCOHOL ALLOWED"" period with a prescription I had to take. I tried Old Milwaukee NA and even St. Paulie and drifted back to Busch on price and taste. Overall I found this ""brew"" not all that bad and may even try to mix a few in when I go back to the real stuff. In the meantime ""Countdown to Liquor Day""!"

" The taste is not bad and I honestly don't expect a lot of it for this style so it has what most NA beers deliver: a light malt taste which has a subtle sweet tinge like corn pops or rice crispies perhaps with a dry essence and slight yeast element which gives a mild mineral note until the semi dry finish. Overall I really was trying to base this on the style which is made to have a low flavor but it was not unpleasant for what it is and has a palate scubbing quality that would make this good as a lawnmower beer. I wouldn't buy this unless it was for the reason I got this: a beer to drink while on high strength pain meds. It is similar to the original busch taste-wise without the alcohol buzz."
"overall, i would pass on again"
"Pours a thin straw yellow color with a thick white head and mountains upon mountains of carbonation and no lacing. Smells of corn and nothing else. Not much to the taste -- a little sweet a little canned creamed corn and some salt. Mouthfeel is really thin and drinkability is poor."
"Drink - This reminded me of a (even more) watered down glass of coors light. Not a bad option if you're not allowed to have alcohol for whatever reason."
"This really looked appealing after the pour! It had a nice, foamy finger of bone-white head that acted like it was interested in hanging around. Color was a deep-gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cereal sweetness to it, along with a slight metallic tang. Not great, but at least I was not literally gagging every time I held it near my nose, unlike Miller Sharp's NA. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a decent lager-like taste on the tongue. Finish was slightly sweet, very lager-like, definitely the best so far this afternoon. Frankly, I bought a sixer on Wednesday at the local Giant supermarket and drank one at room temperature while waiting for the bus on a hot, humid afternoon and I liked it just fine then. I liked it a lot more now, chilled down. I could find space in the cooler if I knew someone wanted an NA beer."
"Drinkability on this is awful. I usually have no problem with finishing any beer, but I have to force myself to consume this one. I have had my share of regular Busch, so I know what it is like to drink more than one of these, and it is not a good time. Minus the alcohol content, this beer should only be sought out if you are a true lightweight, or if you just really love the taste of bland, generic, fizzy yellow beer."
"Thanks, I think, to my wife's grandpa for leaving a sixer of this in my beer fridge about a year ago. Poured from a 12 ounce can into my Mayor McCheese tumbler. Appears a crystal clear pale yellow color with a surprisingly tall inch or so of fluffy bone white head. What head was there quickly faded within a few seconds. Smells and tastes of liquid hand soap, canned corn, grass, a bit of toasted cereal grains, some sweet malt. Body is quite light with decent carbonation."
"All in all, I'd drink this again if it were free and I was really, really bored and there was no other beer around."
"kind of plain with a grainy mouthfeel.Drinkability is decent.I would buy again if OM is out."
"Not bad for what it is. Oh yes, except that it's a non-alcoholic beer that isn't going to impress anyone."
"Conclusion: It's an NA beer; that being said, and that stigma being implied, it's very possibly the most ""beery"" NA beer out there, which is odd, considering it's from AB. If put up next to several American Light Lagers, I might have trouble picking out this NA beer...that being said, it is what it is, and for what it is, it's way above average."
"A pale yellow color with a thick quickly diminishing fizzy white head Aroma is a light sweet malt ,dry and grainy malt with a bit of corn, but not sickly sweet. Flavor is lightly sweet with a bit of skunk or maybe it is hops, who knows. Watery light body with lots of carbonation, no lacing,finish and aftertaste are a little barn-yardish.No beer buzz."
"Pours a clear amber/yellow, some gold highlights, thin white bubbly head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring, no lacing. Smell is very light, sweet malt, some corn, honey, doesn't really smell any worse than other macros. Taste is.... nothing? Kind of like carbonated water with a touch of corn, light fruitiness, thats it. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high fizzy carbonation. Lost me at the flavour, otherwise pretty standard stuff. Thanks Jan!"
"If anything, the non-alcoholic aspect helps its case. Surprisingly, this never became outright offensive. It can easily pass for a drinkable beer, especially to those who don't normally drink. In fact, I'd prefer this to Bud Llight, or Coors Light. Still, Busch like most all mass produced macro lagers are abominations to beer. This is no exception."
"Drinkability: Fairly non-offensive, bland, and watery."
"Pours an extremely light yellow color with a very small thin head, almost no lacing. Below average carbonation with a slight smell of sweet hops. Tastes like colored water not much taste or body at all. Water is the dominant flavor. Drink and piss. Again, water is the dominant flavor."
"This is way better than Busch regular. If given a choice between the two, I'd take this one."
" ~ Hopefully I will never have to have another one of these ""beers"" ever again. That includes finishing this one. Down the drain you go."
"D - There are much better N/A beers out there...like, all of them. Avoid this. Drink a Diet Coke if you're the DD."
"Sadly, there are a few regular macros I would probably choose this over. This isn't much of a beer, but isn't bad for the style (and price). There are worse out there."
"I can't believe I'm reviewing this...but here we are. Used to drink ""real Busch"" when I was younger, and hard to believe but this is actually better! Decided to give my liver a break, and also, this stuff is better than soda pop...so what the hell. Nice pour that left a beautiful creamy head! WOW, I was surprised!! I showed my wife and told her ""LOOK, it LOOKS like a real beer!"" Nice dark gold/orangey color. Again, surprised. The taste...well, it resembled a light beer, and not really even Busch, from what I remember of that swill. Just a nice clean taste, really, that went well with chips/salsa and Monday night football. I'll tell you, if you're looking for an NA...I believe this is the all-around one to get. Very smooth and drinkable, cheap, and better than most all of the others out there. There was a hint of metalic flavor in the very beginning, but that went away quickly. Very consistent smooth, and malty taste. Nice spacer, if you're just lookin' for something that resembles the taste of beer...which I was...and to give the alkie a rest. I know, it's sad...but what the hell...gotta do it sometimes. OH, and it has only 60 g of calories, and 12.9 g of carbs! Much like a light beer, just a little higher in the carb department, but lower in the calories. This stuff is probably somewhat good for you too! Give it a try! You'll be surprised, I think. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Pours to a thin white head and pale yellow color. Aroma is mostly seltzer water and a weak adjunct-laden beer smell. Flavor is an extremely weak cheap beer flavor, not terrible but not that great either and too weak to satisfy. Virtually no hop character other than a faint bitterness. Finishes clean and dry. It drinks very easily--like water--which it basically IS. This stuff makes for a decent alternative to water for those who don't mind the taste of Busch."
"Busch NA pours an extremely pale golden color with a nice head that dropped quickly from a twelve ounce can. The smell is downright foul. Chemical is the only way I can describe it. Thankfully, the taste isn't quite as bad. A bit of adjunct is about all you get. If you hold your nose it's okay for a na beer."
"This beer is slightly drinkable, but beware of the sweet taste."
"Poured a pale yellow color with an initial puffy head that soon disapeared. Smell is a slightly sickly sweet scent that is not overly enjoyable. Taste is mostly unfermented malt, and not enjoyable. Not a very good NA. Almost completely undrinkable. I'm sorry I wasted money on a six-pack. There are much better NA's."
"I'm not one to poo-poo N/A beers or American macros just for the sake of doing so. I enjoy both from time-to-time. However, this wasn't very enjoyable to me. It's a nearly-no-character fizzy drink that vaguely resembles beer. There are far better N/A beers out there for those occasions where that's what's called for. I can't recommend it."
"Found this in my dad's fridge after he threw a party. 12 oz., ""born on"" 5/23/05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a dark yellow with few streams of carbonation and a 1/2 inch white head that leaves some lacing. Has a nasty metal/malt aroma. Has the same nasty taste with a below-average mouthfeel. There is no reason to drink this - which is why it's going down the drain."
"First of all, you can't compare this to others styles of beers, this is a NA. As for being compared to other NA's, this one is pretty good. I am really impressed. This brew tastes very close to an actual macro lager. I have had many NA's and a few from Europe, and I must say this one so far is the best tasting one. Much better then its O'Douls cousin. If you need a good consistent NA, then this is it."
"It looks like an average beer, and smells mostly metallic. It feels like an average beer and taste isn't much. Way more flavor than the Genny NA that has the distinction of lowest rated beverage I've rated. I could (and may) drink more of the Busch (because OM NA is scantly available in Cleveland) It is nothing like Busch as some of the reviews have stated. It's tolerable with a little of the adjunct flavor but still nothing special. It's an okay NA, and has a below average drinkability for lack of distinct flavors."
"Actually this isn't hat bad. Tastes better than many macro lagars even! Better than busch beers anyway. I wouldn't ever drink the stuff, but as far as na brews I've tried, this one ranks around the cream. Not much going on in terms of anything, but my rankings against the style. Try it if you're looking for a na."
"Bleech- who would drink this?! If you want non-alcoholic go with O'Douls or Rootbeer, Busch NA is absolutely repellant!!"
