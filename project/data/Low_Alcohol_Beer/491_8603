3.4,30.3,3,3,4,2,3.5,"It's a "brewed soft drink", not a beer, and bearing in mind that the alcohol content plays a major part in the overall flavour of a beer, this is a pretty good, refreshing substitute. This is no Grand Cru, but for its style - an "ultra-light" beer even minors can buy - it's worth the meagre price of 90c a can.","Weizenmensch","Beers"
