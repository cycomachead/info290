"O: Overall fairly sweet, and not really my cup of tea, but it seems to be about par for the course when rated based on style.."
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
"Overall- The best Low Alcohol Beer I have had."
""
""
""

"Pours out to a frothy white head that falls to a thin film. Golden clear color. Aroma is typical euro-lager with just a touch of that strange NA whang. Flavor is weakened Heineken, with a grainy front, sweet middle and dry, seltzery finish. Overall a decent NA brew that is close to the real thing."
""
"O. One of the better NA beers I have ever had. I’m surprisingly impressed. I recommend giving it a try, just remember not to discriminate because it’s an NA."
""
""
"Overall (1.39) : Stay away, unless you hate yourself. Drink a sprite instead."
"O: For the style, this is acceptable and a good starter beer."

"Clear golden liquid with some bubbles, little head nor lacing. No aroma to be had. In the taste, sweet euro pale malts and perhaps corn and other adjuncts. Has a light beery flavor and a bit of hop bitters. Tastes like an under fermented euro pale lager, which is what this is. Sweet wort and some hop, light watery body. If you like euro style lagers and can't have more than 0.5% abv, this is ok"

"The deployment N/A beer for the Army for years. I have had servings in cans and bottles. Overall it is not horrible when you are in T-Total country. It has good appearance of a regular beer. It pours golden with decent head but not much for lace. It smells like a pasture with tones of hay. There is sort of a stagnant bland flavor. It has a thin body with quite a bit of carbonation."

"Golden raisin with a strewn top layer of central and perimeter whites. Smells like skunked hops, some metal and maybe wheat chex backwash. Not impressed by the nose here. Taste is grain, corn, a bit of herbal hops, some sugar, metal. Again, not very good. Thin body with light carb and an off dry finish."
"Overall average with a slightly dry bitter finish. A little less sweet than most."
""
"Overall - This stuff is pretty decent. It's definitely easy to drink on."
""
"Light bodied, or more correctly, thin and watery. Light, lively carbonation. I won't try this again."
""
"Well, it's tough to like this one. Pretty poor all around."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty good compared to some of the other non-alcoholic beers out there but seems like it could use a little more hops."
""
"Overall, if I did not know this was non-alcoholic I would have thought it was a coors light. Glad I got to share it with my Grandma who likes the taste of beer but not the alcohol."

"o: shockingly complex for the style, and enjoyable - I think it's better than heineken."
"The palate has a blend of lemony and dusty Saaz, skunk and a touch of grain, all on an incredibly watery palate. No real sweetness is present, though a touch of corn and sugar are noticeable. Drying on the finish, watery and with a mild Saaz bite, there's actually a little lingering bitterness on the finish. Highly carbonated, this is quenching and refreshing. Fairly clean, there's nothing discernibly off here. This is not bad at all, and I would go as far as recommend it. It's significantly better than Heineken, and most macro lagers. In terms of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, I would say this is second to maybe good tonic water, as the lack of sweetness and the added bitterness really do help. I actually drank the whole bottle."
""
""
"Skunky, sweet, thin, grainy aftertaste, it reminds me a lot of a couple of adjunct lagers out there. Not worth a second look but it is not as bad as most out there. Fortunately my body can currently tolerate alcohol so Im going to go get a beverage that has some. NEXT!"
""
"O: I'm scoring this beer fairly well. While pretty mediocre as far as beer goes, I think this beer is stellar when compared to other NA's on the market. This one is about as close as I've come. So I'll meet in the middle on scoring. Not great overall, but great for the category."
"O: This is the first time I have ever had N/A beer, or less than 0.5% beer as it actually is. If I once was a serious alcoholic and could no longer have real beer due to health issues or whatever, I would gratefully drink this, but I would try the other N/A beers out there, they might be better. Either way it is pretty cool they at least make this so someone can enjoy a ""beer"" if they can't have alcohol."
"Dr: Obviously it's very drinkable as it's practically water, but it has no real alcohol content. I wouldn't have it again, but perhaps for the nondrinker it might be more worthwhile than Beck's or O'Doul's."
"Good god this is foul. Pours pale straw. White head. Nose is coked vegetables over fresh, raw skunk funk from fresh skunk roadkill. Amazing that they are able to sell this product. Would rather nose my Hanes after a long jog, with the socks too. Cereal grain sweetness is in there on the palate. Sweet corn & grainy finish."
"O - Stay away from it as much as possible. Anything including water is better than this."
"Poured a straw yellow with a quickly receding white head. Slight essence of grains in the aroma and not much else. Taste of skunk and stale grain juice. Like water in the mouth, and not drinkable for any reason."
"My first Non Alcoholic beer... Tasted more like beer than I had expected."
"D: This was horrendous. I wish I could give this beer a zero on the aroma. Wow...do not buy this."
"I don't have much to say. Skip it. Drink iced tea or something else if you really want non-alcoholic beverage. I just don't see the point of stuff like this."
"12 oz bottle into a tulip. Clear watery yellow with a rapidly fading head. Smells like roadkill, sulfur, metal, minerals, husky grain. Sweet on the palate, extremely thin and somewhat metallic. Signature Heineken skunk. Grainy, watery finish with a little astringency. This is pretty much awful."
"Pours a sickly looking pale straw color (a little hazed) with a thick soapy white head and a little lacing. Smells of carbonated water with some grain and a little corn in the background. Mouthfeel is a little thin but they are usually thin for this style. Drinkability is low, because the beer just isn't that good."
"D: Nice near beer. No real off flavours and it really feels like you're drinking something."
"All in all, on the higher scoring end of the N/A beers out there, and by far more focused in flavor. I can't think of another brew that hides its lack of alcohol content so well, that tastes as much like...well, generic European Pale Lager beer. I just wish the mouthfeel wasn't so heinous. Give it a try."
"Drinkability: If I wanted a beer in this style, I could have several of these. It tastes like beer with a sweeter ending. It tastes like an above average lager. Good for the style."
"This is obviously not my first choice when I reach for a beer, but for those times when I can't have alcohol, this is a worthy substitute. Best non-alcoholic beer I've had."
"Taste, like a BMC with better hops, slightly. Leaves nothing to grasp onto, you don't savor anything mouthfeel wise, you just want to hurry up and get over it. It would be better to just relapse if you were an alcoholic and drink a better real beer than suffer through this. Even worse, its pricey."
"D- Overall, this beer does the job it is intending to do. A very light bodied beer with very little alcohol. Worth a try."
"A very light beer in more than just taste, it was yellow in color and unnaturally clear with no head. It was litely carbonated, with aroma of grain, malt and hops. As for the taste there were slight malt and hops present. This is a super light NA beer with not much to it."
"Not so bad, it has merits, but not many."
"Out of a bottle this 'beer' was a crystal clear, light golden color with a ton of rising carbonation. The one finger head of white foam retained pretty well like a down comforter. The aroma was surprisingly beer-like, albeit macro beer, slightly stale and skunky with generic grains and a good malt/hop balance. The flavors were clean and crisp, though obviously stripped of the alcoholic gumption one hopes from a drink. Still, for a NA beer it was dry and smooth with only a hint of sweetness and cereal grains. The mouthfeel was fair enough, the body light/medium and the carbonation good. Would I order another one? Not unless I had to do NA. But if I DID, I would. For the style? Bravo."
"For an NA beer in that style, not bad. It didn't have that slick, almost sweet character that most de-alcoholized beers have. I'd rather drink this than Labatt NA, Gennesse NA, Coors NA, or Kaliber if I have to drink an NA beer."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This beer was largely grassy and earthy, but manages to balance out with some nice sweet malty flavor. Ive only tried a few of these low alcohol brews, but this one seems to be the best one that Ive had. I liked it's low key flavors, and awesome drinkability. All in all it's decent, and won't leave you with a hangover, you could drink as many as you want. Cheers!"
"Drinks a lot like Heineken Light out of a mini keg. I could see myself in a crowded place, dipping my arm in the ice bucket & drinking a couple of these before I realized what it was."
"Well, it is a non-alcoholic beer. Just thought that I'd try out this style and so far, not impressed."
"I can't believe I dirtied a glass for this."
"D - IF you have to go the N/A route, this is the way to go. I don't really like it all that much, but I think some people might, and I appreciate it's assertiveness."
"It doe'nst feel bad in mouth but good neither i have too i did'nt want the third ."
"Not too pleasant for beer, but not terrible for the style. Anyway, in most cases, I would pick water over this, but if you want something of a beer flavor without the alcohol, it's not a bad choice."
"Heineken has reason to be proud of Buckler. I doubt I'll ever buy it again, but it's one of the most drinkable low alcohol beers that I've ever had. It's certainly in the top three. It looks like N.A. Shootout (With Blanks) IV has a clear winner. Designated drivers never had it so good."
"Presentation: Packages in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I love this beer, it tastes great and mimics Heineken's regular brew wonderfully. Most importantly, introduce this beer to people who only drink O'Douls--I'm sure they will be delighted to see there are other good tasting and smelling non-alcoholic beers."
"About as good an N/A as I've had. What makes this one stand out is the hop character, which I'd compare to Heineken or Beck's. Not bad at all. Of course, for $8+ a sixer, it had better be good!"
"Buckler was my conscious-free answer. It's not good but it tasted enough like beer to be an okay alternative. Easy enough to drink but no mouthfeel at all. Reminded me of a poor Euro lager. Still better than not having anything at all though."
"($5.49 / 6-pack)"
"An oxidized like leather, and recycled paper smell; taste like yeast, and soft, the worst of the Na beers, serve in a shot glass or from the bottle, dont try with food, this beer had a 1% of alcohol then it has or it does not have alcohol?... 49% recommended."
"My wife will occationally buy an NA beer when shopping. Most are simply miserable. This one is actually drinkable. It pours like an unappealing macro lagerclear yellow with a fizzy, quickly falling head. The aroma is faint, but fairly nicegrassy, a hint of hops. The flavor is a bit sweet, with hops and grain present. Its thin, watery, and effervescent, but its also better than nearly all other NAs that Ive had. It wont hold a candle to a real beer, but Im actually pretty impressed."
"Wanted a ""non-alcoholic"" beer so I could drive. Some taste but funny aftertaste. Decent looking head though pale in the glass. Beer aroma masked by hint of apple. Bit dry and low in taste but passable in a pinch as carbonation gets you through it. Beats a soft drink!"
"Overall I judge Buckler to be a ""so-so"" non-alcoholic beer."
"Drinkable but supremely boring."
"Yoy! Big schpoonk on the nose, some underlying corn. The front is very light, with some grain/corn. The middle gets a little better... some malt pokes through the corn and there's a little tanginess to it. Nice. The finish is sweetish, but turns nicely dry. Overall, a good NA. There's plenty of flavor, and it's not too sweet or cloying. It's not my favorite NA, but it's close."
"It passes the test for a nonalcoholic beer. An appearance right on the average with no present or appealing smell. However, its not too bitter but rather has a good, full malty taste that is appealing. I wonder how come heineken does not simply add alcohol to it and label it heineken instead of its current (and terrible) latter."
"Sampled a friend's at Thirsty Dog. About what you would expect of a NA produced by Heineken I suppose. Light gold color with a thin white head. Little lacing. Aroma is faint hops with a skunky aspect as well. Thin and watery and fizzy, with very mild hops and a somewhat filmy finish. I'd choose Warsteiner's NA over this any day."
"Drinkability & Notes: The thin malt and processed hop flavour don't do much other than leave things bland. Don't bother with this one if you are desperate for a good tasting near beer. It was good to cook with and that is about it."
"Disclaimer - I have not tried any other NA's so I am simply comparing to light lagers such as Bud Light."
"Buckler is brewed by Heineken... This is a very nice Beer and Buckler comes in a brown bottle too, from Heineken, I just dont get it."
