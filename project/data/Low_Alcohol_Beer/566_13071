4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"If you told me this was a straight-ahead German lager, I would not have blinked - it sure as hell is, no qualms, no questions. Its NA status makes it all the more impressive, especially in consideration of its competitors' inadequacies.","biboergosum","Jan 31, 2012"
4.29,23.6,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O -- This is hands down the best NA I recall ever having. Even as it starts to warm, it tastes magnificent. Nice hop taste without the syrupy sweetness typical of the style. Balanced and highly drinkable -- no small feat for an NA. If you can find this, give it a shot.","fastrodney","Nov 15, 2011"

3.98,14.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured a huge creamy off-white head leaves a nice looking coat of lace. A cloud of carbonation erupts from the bottom of the transparent golden beer. Faint aroma of Pilsner malt sweetness and pungent herbal hops. The malt sweetness carries over into the flavor and is joined by some floral flavors from the hops. There is just a hint of artificial sweetness from the malt, but the flavor is heads of above most NA's. The bitterness kicks up towards the end and eclipses the other flavors in the finish. The body is solid; somewhere between a Pils and a Helles. The faint off flavor is barely noticeable and nothing to complain about. If you're looking for a non-alcoholic beer I would highly recommend this one.","HappyHourHero","0"
