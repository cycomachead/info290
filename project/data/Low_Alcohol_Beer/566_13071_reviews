"The only catch: I'm not a huge fan of German pils as a style. But beggars can't be choosers."

"330ml bottle. Pilsner glass. Gold color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, slowly dissipated crown & lacing on sides. Sugar, malt & hay aromas. Ripe peach juice at first sip. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Flavor profile displays artificial flavoured notes, cloying sweetness & very low bitterness. Fruity aftertaste."

"If you told me this was a straight-ahead German lager, I would not have blinked - it sure as hell is, no qualms, no questions. Its NA status makes it all the more impressive, especially in consideration of its competitors' inadequacies."
"O -- This is hands down the best NA I recall ever having. Even as it starts to warm, it tastes magnificent. Nice hop taste without the syrupy sweetness typical of the style. Balanced and highly drinkable -- no small feat for an NA. If you can find this, give it a shot."
"With alcohol less than 0.5%, this is not bad with more depths than typical NA beer."
"Overall, this is the best low alcohol beer I've encountered. It would pass as a half-decent normal lager."
"Poured a huge creamy off-white head leaves a nice looking coat of lace. A cloud of carbonation erupts from the bottom of the transparent golden beer. Faint aroma of Pilsner malt sweetness and pungent herbal hops. The malt sweetness carries over into the flavor and is joined by some floral flavors from the hops. There is just a hint of artificial sweetness from the malt, but the flavor is heads of above most NA's. The bitterness kicks up towards the end and eclipses the other flavors in the finish. The body is solid; somewhere between a Pils and a Helles. The faint off flavor is barely noticeable and nothing to complain about. If you're looking for a non-alcoholic beer I would highly recommend this one."
