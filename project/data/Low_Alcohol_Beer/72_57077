But then, there's Chinotto, and Sanbitter, or just straight lime juice, they're all nice bitter drinks that can suit this purpose.","laituegonflable","Oct 02, 2010"

The normal yeast character is still intact, with notes of banana and clove. I could drink this more often if beer with alcohol wasn't nicer.","Absumaster","Beers"
