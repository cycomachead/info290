"You gotta look at this beer for what it is and not compare it to your favorite full strength beer. Coopers could do a lil better but great for what it is."
"Overall a 3.5 because it's a decent shot at a NA beer. I think coopers could do better though."
"Pregnant women and recovering alcoholics watch out, I'd drink these on a hot day if I had to."
"A decent attempt at making an alcohol free beer taste ok, but only just ok."
"However for a 'soft drink' with a little bit of punch I think it is pretty good"
"I wil go most beers in the world before this one. With that being said, considering the market the company is trying to hit, I think its a great idea for those who dont or cant drink alcohol much and they have pulled it off pretty well."
"It's a ""brewed soft drink", not a beer, and bearing in mind that the alcohol content plays a major part in the overall flavour of a beer, this is a pretty good, refreshing substitute. This is no Grand Cru, but for its style - an ""ultra-light"" beer even minors can buy - it's worth the meagre price of 90c a can."
"yuk yuk yuk. all i can say is that somebody out there must drink this, lord knows why. id rather drink water. i have to stop conducting these sorts of experiments on myself. this birrell feels like it poses a threat to my wellbeing in some way. putrid!!!"
