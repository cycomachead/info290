"Smellls odd. Tastes stale. Doesn't hold carbonation."

"Pours to a generous white head that lasts and laces. Color is a pale straw. Aroma is weak with slight bread or corn smell. Flavor is weak and grain-forward but not metallic or offensive. Nice grainy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated and refreshing, not chalky. Overall not bad for what it is. Does not try too hard, so there's not too much to mess up."

"I tasted it! I'd taste it again, if and only if your pointed a loaded pistol at me while I was dying of thirst and promised me a Young's to wash the taste out of my mouth"

"That said, I rated this among its low alcohol peers. Sharp's is a decent, quality beverage. It's appearance is somewhat light, as is the taste. It is a refreshing beer, but it doesn't have any remarkable qualities. Its aroma is that of a typical American lager, again on the lighter side. It's slightly above average and makes what I like to call a good utility beer - good after mowing the grass, while out on a boat, or watching kids. It's a thin beer that could use more grain flavor."

"Overall a malt beverage with the emphasis on malt. I was hoping it would at least have the Miller High Life amount of hops but actually closer to an AB Natural Light N/A."
""
"Overall - I wasn't expecting much from this before I tried it.. but this is exactly what an N/A should be. It's delicious."

"This tastes like an ill-begotten dessert. The sweet bread flavor is not welcomed; almost like unfinished pizza dough. If it weren't for my curiosity I wouldn't have bought this. And I won't buy it again."

"It pours out a pale uric-yellow with a filmy head that's gone in an instant. Scent of field/rice paddy.Muted malt taste, like if you were to add MORE water to a stadium beer!It's nearly tasteless,but fizzy carbonation; leaves no aftertaste whatsoever! There are many better Non Alchoholic choices!"
"This is a good place to go if you ever need a low-alcohol beer."
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy/ricy. The taste is slightly sweet, and mostly watery, not much going on here. Light Body. Not Drinkable, just had to try this one."
"at my father in laws you will frequently find these N/a beers and in fact i have traded for a few to give him new choices. this one was just soo off though it was not even funny. pale golden and fizzy light yellow with a relatively absent aroma that only slightly gave a light corn and grain mix. flavor again was like carbonated water with a oxidized after taste. overall one of the lightest tasting and pracically non existent beers i have ever had."
"I don't know that I would let a stray dog drink this."
"overall, this is not a beer that I will sample again"
"Pours a sickly straw yellow with a thin white head and a complete lack of lacing. Smells of corn and grain and general dead things. Tastes like sweet corn with okra and some bitterness. Mouthfeel was very thin with too much carbonation. Drinkability was high because it has no alcohol, so go for it!"
"This began much better than Pabst NA, with nothing going crazy when I cracked open the CAN. It poured with a finger of bone white head that made like Houdini and disappeared before my very eyes! Magic. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was strangely vegetable-like, reminiscent of farmer's market while in season. I do not think that I have ever encountered anything like this in a beer. Mouthfeel was thin, approaching medium, with a slight bitter bite and lots of carbonation on the tongue. Man, I CANnot get past the smell every time I lift the glass near my nose. The worst part is that the beer does not taste like it smells! How did they achieve this? Finish was slightly bitter, kind of tasty, not bad, actually. Still, it is not going into my cooler any time soon."
"Reviewed from notes. Had this while visiting a friend of mine adecided to give it a try. Extremely pale color with a small white head which fades quickly. I detect some corn in the aroma, not much else. Has a corn / cereal taste which is unpleasant. The mouthfeel is light as expected, and there is not much of a reason to try this again. I had it this time out of curiosity."
"Overall. The same thing you would expect from a macro, just not filling in the least. Lets be honest, you knew what this beer was when you picked it up. For one, its miller, and secondly, its NA. there are decent ones out there, but this one is just...well...what you would expect."
"So disappointing. Need I go on about the mouthfeel/watery-esque nature?"
"Tastes very watery, has very little flavor to report. No reason really to drink this. There are other non-alcoholic/low alcohol beers that are much better than this one. Even O'Doul's beats this hands down."
"This beer was reviewed while on holiday in Tobago and almost ruined the whole two weeks! Very malty in the aroma stakes and a headless lager look about it, it is a malted barley, watery nasty."

"Miller Sharp's is exhibit 'A' is what is wrong with low alcohol beer. I can't believe that in this day and age, breweries can't come up with a process that results is something better than this. Of course, having tasted a good portion of Miller's lineup, maybe I shouldn't be so surprised."
"this looks like your typical macro lager and smells like one as well, meaning not much aroma period other than some malt adjuncts if you try really hard. if they're gonna do an n/a beer, why not bring something to the table, like hops? anyways, this actually has MORE flavor than bud light, which is really sad. you could drink and endless amount of these, but why would you if potable water is readily available?"
"Perhaps it is indeed impossible to make good beer without alcohol, which is a shame."
"Thirsty and don't want any alcohol? Drink water. Bad tap water tastes better, than this swill."
"Surprisingly good, or else I was really in the mood for a beer."
"Poured a pale yellow color with initial white puffy head that was very quickly gone. Smell is grainy and not very enjoyable. Taste is more grainyness and the taste becomes less tolerable as the beer warms. Finishes with a slightly unpleasant taste. Not very good."
"It would make a competent American Macro Lager if it had an alcohol content, but since it doesn't I won't come back. There are better near beers out there."
"For shits and giggles I ""borrowed"" one from a friend watching the seahawks game on championship Sunday. Apparently a recovering alcoholic he brought ""near beer"". I don't know about you but without the alcohol it loses its luster. To drink beer that tastes like crap and has no warming effect is pointless."
"If you must drink NA, find one other than this."
"Light, transparent, straw-like color with an unending parade of small bubbles. This brew looks like an average, everyday macro. The head is shallow and fleeting. The aroma is faint and of cereal grains. No hop presence at all. The first taste is actually a little sweet. Its watery and hollow. On the other hand, compared to a lot of other NA brews, this one has at least some flavor and notable characteristics. Its not great, but it is better than most."
"My first foray into non-alcoholic beers. Sharp's was among the cheapest. The beer is a very light platinum and the head is larger and more lasting than any other mass-produced American beer I can think of, alcohol or no. It's the typical smell, too, with a light vegetable and mineral quality. Reminiscent of sporting events. I was truly expecting the worst from this beer, but it actually has some good qualities. There's a reasonable amount of flavor and I'll be damned if it doesn't scratch that beer itch. It washed down a slice of pizza with aplomb. Of course, Sharp's is nothing to get excited about, but if you're abstaining from alcohol (as I am, due to painkillers I am taking for an injury) and are looking for a bargain, this is a good place to start. In fact, the prospect of no alcohol is not as bleak as I imagined. But keep in mind it's been a while since real beer has passed my lips."
"Ordered a bottle of this at a restaurant just for the hell of it, always wondered if it was a good tasting beer. Really not a bad idea, beer with out the tastes of alcohol. Too bad this NA beer tastes nothing of beer. Pours a flat yellow macro color with no smell to speak of, very weak. The taste is of water and really nothing substantial. Mouthfeel is light and putrid. Couldn't even finish the bottle I was drinking so obviously not a drinkable beer in my opinion. What was Miller thinking, do people buy this?"
"This Has got to be if not the worst, then pretty damned close. The colour was a clear straw yellow with little head. The smell was of corn. Have you ever had corn pops? That's what it smells like. The taste was watery. I could say that it had subtle hints of cascade hops and a nice balance of malts, but I would be lying. There was little taste except for corn and rice."
"pours out the lightest of straw yellow colours...lots of big and fast rising bubbles keep a fairly white, dense head intact. pretty typical unappealing light adjunct aroma. in fact it sort of stinks. well...there is basically no taste. i concur the with the pevious reviewers in that it tastes like bad tap water minus the carbonation. watery and thin mouthfeel. it's sort of drinkable basically for the fact that it's cold and wet. this is a bad carbonated beverage. don't bother."
"Notes: Hands down the worst NA beer in the world. A great gag beer  they should sell this one in the joke shops. Sad thing is that the joke is on me this time."
"Let's see, what should we name a really dull ""beer""? Sharp's! This is the most inappropriate name for a consumer product since the automobile Nova (translates to ""Does not go"" in Spanish). So maybe I am stretching a bit but the only reason is because I really cannot find anything worth mentioning about this flacid near-beer. Weak color, no aroma to speak of. Has the character of water after passing through a colander full of rice. Watery and pathetic finish. On top of all these wonderful attributes there is not even any alcohol content, which can sometimes be the saving grace for even the most putrid of beers (many of which are incidentally made by this very same brewer). If someone didn't leave one of these in my fridge I never would have bothered. Curiosity killed the cat in this case."
"Not entirely hateful, considering the style. Looks pretty much like an average American macro lager and smells about the same. The flavor is pretty much on a par with a macro, but the mouthfeel is thin and watery. The drinkability is dependent on the weather and could be used as a thirst quencher in a pinch."
"Pours a light golden color with a modest head and slight carbonation. Actually, the carbonation looks like it belongs with a well-made microbrew, lots of small, slow-rising bubbles. Aroma of cooked cereal and faint hops, not much else. Taste yields fairly sharp, spritzy carbonation, subdued maltiness and some watered down hops towards the finish. It would be fairly refreshing on a hot day, I think. Still, it is a non-alcoholic beer from a macro brewer. This, in my opinion, limits the possibilities of such a brew."
"Pours like a typical Miller beer. Slight head which goes away fast. Mild carbonation. Taste is of watered down grain (corn?) with only a slight hop taste. Malt is there, just barely. Finishes without any distinct aftertaste. Not bad for an N/A brew. If I took to N/A I might get to like this."
"Sharps is a tasty brew and I really wonder why Miller doesn't go on to make this one with some teeth."
