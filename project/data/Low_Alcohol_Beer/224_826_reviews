"Not bad for a NA brew. I mean, that's not saying much, since there's still no reason to drink it."

"Overall a good NA beer. A little expensive for what it is though."

"Better than average for this style but still not too pleasant."

"skunky flat tasting had ok color but if that is the best that I can come up with, you might want to pass on this brew."

"Got one for free for being a designated driver and this was my first NA beer. The appearance was a pale yellow and the smell was mostly rice. Good amount of carbonation though. The taste was mostly rice with some hints of malt although it had a bit of a metallic twinge to it near the end. The mouthfeel was average, but overall it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it might be."

"Pours to a generous head that persists. Color is pale straw. Aroma is skunky and rubbery to the point I almost gave up. There are some nice wort-like malt and noble hop aromas in there once the skunk dissipates in the nasal passages. Unlike most green bottle beers the skunk aroma does not decrease much over time. Flavor is pretty good with some sticky pale malt and noble hop flavors to make it enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light, slightly wort-y and not as rough as other NAs. Overall, good as NAs go but the mercaptans in the nose nearly killed the deal."

"St. Pauli NA is a way better beer than O'Douls . way better taste way better smell. I would prefer a heavy beer but they don't make NA stout beers but the most beer that is close to a stout is Kaliber which is made by Guinness also there is Malta which is supposed be a good beer."

"Overall - no thank you, I shall pass."

"O: As far as pale lagers go this is better than some of the alcoholic ones. A bit to sweet for me to love though, but I actually wouldn't mind drinking this again."

"Overall - I'm not so impressed by this N/A beer compared to the others I've tried."
"Best by 0913."
"Golden with a central dome and outward flowing bone white foam. Pretty good look for the style examples I've seen. Smells of light grain, some dough, some sweet bread, a touch of floral hops and a little bit of yeast character. Corn, grain, really sweet, slight bitterness on the back end. Nothing special. Thin bodied and moderate carb. Meh, not the worst, not the best I've had. It's funny though, I'm finding that the NA beers have the knack of never really seeming to skunk."

"O: This isn’t one of the greatest non-alcoholic beers but the taste isn’t that offensive and tastes better than some American Adjunct Lagers."

"This may come as a shock, but I've actually had worse beers than this. I can't say I *liked* it, but I sure didn't hate it either. The highs sure weren't high, but the lows weren't huge turn-offs. Just a pretty bland malt/apple soda, basically."
"It's a good change of pace for low-alcohol beers. It's a little too chalky for me, but it is still good."
"Poured from a green 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very skunky, could be the dreaded green bottle. Taste also has some skunk to it, somewhat sweet, lots of grains. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I wouldn't go out of my to find this one."
"OK, I admit,I'm only reviewing this to tick a style that I haven't done yet. I would never buy a sixer of this but came across a free single bottle, so here goes! As soon as I started pouring this into a mug it was nothing but skunk and dank pot. The area around me smells like bedroom in college. Taste is really sweet and grainy. Really wasn't expecting it to be this sweet, but it is with lots of grainy flavors, slightly floral, and no real hoppiness. It's actually not awful, but not really good either. Hard to get past the skunky aroma though, so I try not to smell it as I drink it. Mouthfeel is like a light lager. Meh... I haven't had an N/A beer in probably 10 years or more, and this really isn't enjoyable largely because there's no alcohol in it (well, a negligible amount) and it really detracts from the flavor. Beer really does need to have sort of alcohol qualities to give it it some more flavor... But anyways, not need to contemplate it this much. It's a beer, and skunky, sweet, grainy one at that. Not good but not horrific."
"Oh god, the nose... it is unyielding."
"Pours a pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice a nice one-finger white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy/ricy, slightly malty. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy, little malt note. Light Body. Not too bad, but still a shitty beer."
"Right off the bat, upon popping the cap, I got a whiff of either Saaz or skunk, either of which is possible, given these green bottles. My pour created just better than a finger of rocky, bone-white head that fell like a souffle when you bang the oven door closed. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, given that I could see into the future with it. Lots of CO2 bubbles were in evidence. Nose was Saaz-like, not downright skunked, so I am erring on the side of caution. Mouthfeel was medium but with a heavy metallic taste in the mouth. This was not skunked, but neither was it much good! Feh, I could taste Saaz hops in the background, but the metallic flavor up front was more than I wanted to deal with. Finish left me cold, at best. I just could not shake that metallic taste which seemed pervasive from start to finish. I'm sorry Todd had an allergic reaction and I would not foist this on anybody."
"The pour was decent, light color with lots of carbonation and a tow inch fizzy white head. Decent retention as well. The aroma was lots of grainy malts, light bready character with a hint of earthy hops. The flavor followed along nicely, smooth, crisp, clean. Not much depth here, but the style really does not require it. Easily drinkable and really not that bad at all. For my first low ABV beer, I was not totally turned off by it."
"D: Not at all. I'd rather drink an O'Doul's Amber or Kaliber if alcohol was an issue (which it is not)."
"D: I would need to be paid to have another"
"D: Ironically, I don't find this, or most other N.A. beers, to be very drinkable or sessionable. I have had my fair share of N.A. beers while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even then couldn't force more than two down on any given night. If I want something really drinkable with no alcohol in it, I'll opt for water."
"D: Easy to drink, and sweetness/bitterness is well balanced. Not great, but not horrible either."
"Drinkability: this stuff is just gross. I will never be having this beer again."
"Unfortunately, the sweetness doesn't seem to be from natural sugar, yeast or fermentation, but saccharin or something. What cracks me up is that it seems like it has the heat of a high ABV beer. Strange."
"its lite and sweet with a mild sulfur and a sticky back mouth. there is almost a wheaty aftertaste to this beer. i need to read my medication to figure out how long i have to go wtihout hte pills before its safe to drink a real beer."
"D - goes down very easy, especially if you can't have the alcohol but want the beer flavor."
"12oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a clear pale yellow with a good amount of carbonation rising through. A large white head caps it off. Popping the cap, I can smell the skunk right away. Why must they bottle in green bottles?! Maybe some adjunct grains in there, but it's too skunked to tell. The body is firm with a decent carbonation pop. This is really sweet. Lots of honey sweetness. Almost cloying. Can't really tell this is a beer. This is my first NA beer. It may be my last."
"D- Overall, I would avoid drinking this one again. The taste is downright terrible."
"D: This was certainly more drinkable than I had imagined, and actually tastes pretty decently like a typical lager. But still, I don't quite get the point of non-alcoholic beer. Quoting Quagmire from ""Family Guy"": ""It's like a snake without venom. It'd just be a... belt."""
"Currently on deployment in Kuwait. Purchased from the PX reefer. Only 0.75 cents a bottle. No glass available. Consumed directly from bottle. Although smelling directly from the bottle may not be most fair, I smell absolutley nothing popping out. I give the bottle a little shake. Nothing. Taste is nothing to write home about. I'm having a hard time picking out any distinct flavors. Overall, the best I can say is it is not overpriced at .75 cents a bottle. For out here and and NA, I'd drink again if no other choice. Otherwise, I'll spend my 3 quarters elsewhere."
"d- not good,wouldn't drink unless had too."
"D - Well, considering how watery it is, it should be drinkable, but it somehow fails at this too. After a few sips, I just couldn't bring myself to choke the rest down. Ground pour. Switched to iced tea since I couldn't stand to take another taste of crappy ""beer."""
"D - I think it is my favorite NA."
"Like most non-alcohol beers, the appearance is lacking. Pale yellow with a fizzy white head. No lace. It smelled of an odd caramel aroma and not much else. The taste is not terrible with a decent sweet caramel malt flavor but it lacks anything else. Mouthfeel was a little weak and a little watery. Not a great brew, but I found it better than O'Doul's."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 10.2009/L29889B. The pour is a thing pale yellow with a foamy, puffy, choppy white head. The aroma is atypical N-A malts. The texture is watery. Overall it tastes rather flat and stale like unsweetened malts. What do you want for an N-A?"
"D= if you make it past the Pepé Le Pew part, you're halfway there."
"Avoid like the plague. Regular St.Pauli Girl will do you much better. Hell, even water is more tasteful than this."
"D-Excellent NA that is better than some light beers. I think this tastes better than Bud light etc...Best NA I have had edging out the Beck's NA...both are really good for the style...biggest issue is this is 96 calories...most NA's are about half that...maybe that is why this tastes better...."
"This was nothing special, but it might be decent to cook with."
"Cheers!"
"Dammit man. I train for a Marathon and go dry for a month, but figured some NA Beer would get me done. This stuff had some maltyness to it, but it smelled and tasted like day old ass. I'm sorry. I tried it at a restaurant in the Houston airport, and again in an Orlando restaurant. Both times it was horrible and I had to force it down."
"Not only did I pour some of it down the drain, I will be throwing full bottles away."
"I got some of this for free, basically. So why not review it? Well it has trace amounts of alcohol < 0.5%. It tastes like sweet wert, but not fresh. Missing the alcohol bite. Swill to the max, but probably better than the other N/A's. Maybe I'll throw some yeast and sugar in the rest of the bottles and wait a bit. :)"
"Overall: One of the better NA beers. Though not a big fan of the style, it is well interpreted."
"I liked this beer. I have had regular St. Paulie Girl and enjoyed it. N.A. is a step down it seems. It had a decent color to it, almost a golden hue. So it looked promising. The taste seemed weak, about the same as an American beer. As i got to the bottom of the bottle it had a bread taste which was disturbing, so the last 1/8 of the bottle would go down the drain. Another thing was it was filling, so i wouldn't suggest having it with a meal but it goes will with hot dogs. But on a cold day it warms you good. I like it as a stand-by beer, even though it has it's issues, overall it's not bad. Best served chilled on a chilly day."
"Drinkability- Goes down decently but a little rough for a near beer"
"St. Pauli N.A. pours a pale yellow with a very thin white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky with some cereal in the background. Definitely some hop flavor in this one. More than I expected. This may be the best N.A. I've had. Not a bad choice if you're not drinking, it resembles beer more than any other N.A.'s I've had."
"I'm not so sure that this whole NA Shootout (With Blanks) thing was such a good idea. I'm sitting here with this horrible taste in my mouth trying to come up with synonyms for putrid. St. Pauli N.A. (even the 'Girl' wants no part of this dreck) is atrocious, even for a low alcohol product. You couldn't pay me to... no, wait, you could pay me to drink it, but I'd suggest winning the lottery before coming to me with an offer."
"One of the better N/A beers I've had. Nice."
"Not a bad beer for it's style, quite drinkable, passable for a night when I needed to drive and stay out late and not drink water or something sugary. Some satisfction. OK in all the categories although not to good an aroma. Mellow, but also a half year past due from Premiere Gourmet."
"I would drink it again if someone else were buying the beer, or I had to drive home and there were few other choices. I would probably pick it over Bud Light it those were only two choices."
"Not drinkable in my opinion. Not real flavorful and without enough malt to balance the bitterness level. There are many better NAs out there."
"$1.47 for a 12 oz single at Total Wine in Midlothian."
"Appearance is pale, pale yellow. (Excuse me, is this beer?) with some foam and little lacing. Aroma is not very pleasant s scent of hop extract followed by barley. Initial taste has your artificial flavors: hops, malt and flowers. Carbonation is okay (soda pop) taste of iron/aluminum and a dry, raspy finish. Why, oh why, would we need this beer added to the plethora of Lites? Reminds me of unpasteurized Coors."
"Almost as light in color as Mich ultra,but not quite. Crystal clear and good stickiness in head although it lacks retention. Herbal grassy grain husk aroma with some sweet worty notes. Pleasantly surprised by the flavor - kinda close to beer. Finish is a bit astringent and like carbon dioxide. Feel is wonderful, even compared to real beers. Extremely smooth soothing bubbles, light body. A nice surprise for a N/A."
"Notes: Coarse on the palate, too much hop and not crisp enough. Tastes similar to unfermented beer. There are better non-alcoholic brews out there for sure. Less than 0.5% abv."
"But there is nothing beer about this whatsoever. It leaves a harsh, lingering, biting taste not unlike licking a 9-volt battery. Finishing the bottle was almost agonizing. I see no reason why anyone should buy this ""malt beverage," ever."
"Holy Skunk-o-rama! I could smell the skunk before I even popped the cap (ok, I'm exaggerating... but not much). The skunk tames fairly quickly, though, leaving some hidden grains in the nose. The front is still lagery. The middle is a little corny, a little watery. The finish is dry, slightly hoppy-bitter with some toasted bread. There's a nice corny aftertaste. There are better NAs, but this is good. Quite drinkable."
"Crystal-clear light golden color with lively carbonation and a fairly large snow-white head that soon fades to a paper-thin layer, a little lace. Light malt aroma with mild floral hops and with quite a bit of green glass lager skunk, unintentional, I'm sure, but amusing, nonetheless. Taste begins with decent tart malt and lively carbonation, followed by some mild and lingering hop bitterness. The finish is a bit dry. All in all, not that bad for a non-alcoholic beer."
"After letting the beer air out (quite skunky) I realized, I I remembered correctly,  that it looked remarkably like Okocim Premium, radiant gold with a sticky white head. Malt and grains aroma with very little hops. The taste perfectly mirrored the aroma. There was a sweet pale malt taste, but no hops. The beer had a strange astringent bitterness to it, but it seemed not be from hops. With more of a hop bitterenss this beer wouldn't taste bad at all. Also, there was soemthing remarkably unfulfilling about this, and I don't think it was the lack of alcohol. The lack of bitterness left the taste buds feeling lonely and the beer watery. A nice hop bitterness would bring this beer a long way."
"My first 1.0 rate. I'll be honest, I've tried this three times over a period of time.This is the only brew I can't finish. I make it about half-way. The appearance is good amber-gold with a classic german head.Stop there and just look at it.The smell is alittle "" skunky"". Mouth is left cotton-like.Not impressed with St. Pauli, go for the other two offerings.My problem is I still have three of these left!!"
"I'm not sure why people drink NA beer. This one in particular. It's smooth enough and very drinkable but thin. No smell to speak of. It is awfully plain on the tongue."
"The points I gave it are for judging it as a NA. Man, from the review Jason gave I thing someone wizzed in the bottle and put the cap back on. I did not get any metalic flavors nor the astringancy. What I got out of it was a nice floral nose and a mild hop bitterness. Yes there was a bit of sweet (unfermented??) malt but I think that is better than none at all like the Bitburger or the Clausthaler (SP?). I haven't tried all of the NAs but this one at least has some redeeming quality to it. Luckily I don't HAVE to drink NAs but from the people I know that do this one ranks way up there. Now if I compared this to regular beers it would get a 1 to 1.5. I would still take this over a Bud."
"I actually had an allergic reaction to this beer."
