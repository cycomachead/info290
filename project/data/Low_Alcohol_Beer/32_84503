2.5,-12,,,,,,"O: Blech - not particularly nice. Looks alright, however the aroma and flavour are an unpleasant blend of cooked grain and stewed leaves. The hop bitterness stands out due to the light malt character, but is rather astringent as a result. Watery body. Decidedly mediocre - if you were looking to avoid booze why would you choose this? Not recommended; give it a miss.","jazzyjeff13","Jun 11, 2014"

3.18,12,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprising hop quality. This really helped balance the drink, which is tough for a lot of these nonalcoholic beers. The flavoring also stayed true to Beckâ€™s with their characteristic bitterness and metallic yeastiness. This is the best of the style we have had to date, when comparing strictly on flavor.","TheBrewo","0"
