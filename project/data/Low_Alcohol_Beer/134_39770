2,-1.5,2,2,2,2,2,"33 cl. can @ home. Procured from Carrefour. BBF 17/07/2014. Appearance is not bad, it looks comparable to a pale lager, golden, clear, actually a bit darker golden than quite a few pale lagers, head is soapy and vanished quickly, unfortunately. Nose is huge soggy grains, rotting grains and corn, heavier than a regular pale lager, sweet, nasty hop oil, this smells like an upped pale lager actually which is not a good thing. Taste is like low quality ice tea with slight soggy grains, cornflakes, cheap oily honey, quite a bit of olive oil actually, odd, sweet synthetic and plastic, slight bitterness in the back. Less carb. watery olive oil body. Well if you are looking for a NA Jupiler which is obviously what you want when you are buying this, this is actually not that bad. Tourtel is a better NA that I have tried. I have tried very little NAâ€™s. Compared to pretty much any beer & every other non-alcoholic drink this is frankly nasty to say the least. Given that it more or less lives up to the promises, I cannot really give it a lower score than I did, even if I do feel it a bit like that.","77black_ships","Jul 12, 2011"

1.89,-6.9,3,1.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"Pale gold color but virtually no nose except a little sugar. Oxidation slightly sticky, which is strange for a lager. Little or no taste. Just a grain and water with a touch of sugar makes the rather strong unpleasant drink. The finish is weak or virtually non-existent and it leaves a bit like the pearl sugar on the tongue. Simply disgusting.","ThaCreep","Jul 20, 2008"
1.31,-35.5,2,1,1.5,1.5,1,"oooohhhh. this is truly painful. Got this can from a corner shop across the way from the train station in Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium yesterday. Poured with a soap bubbly kind of off-white head and a little lace. The color isn't so bad (pretty tough to muck that up): clear yellow with no rising bubbles. Aroma was wretched - meat processing plant mixed with old cabbage. I should get the silver star for tasting it. As in many cases like this the taste wasn't quite as bad as the smell. hahahahaha still way sucked. Sweet with wet paper, some funky bitter thang, two day hangover with liver, cheese, and cadavers in my mouth. (don't ask). Most redundant question of the year: is it a session beer? hahahahaha if you're a grand inquisitor in the inquistion and asking a queree if they would like a little something to wet their whistle. Rack please!","drpimento","Nov 25, 2007"
