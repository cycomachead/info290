"For this style, there could be worse. But not much worse."

"Overall- Better than Coors NA, but that is not saying a lot."
"I guess this product is supposed to satisfy the taste of a cheap American brew?  It is horrible to the point that I couldn't even finish it!  I know... You are probably asking why I would even indulge in this beverage??? Well... ?  But I know I had the disadvantage of pouring this product into my glass for one reason or another.  It isn't even for the lack of alcohol, the taste is just plain bland and unpleasant.  I guess if you're looking for a substitute of a cheap horrible brew, this works?  Anywhooooo ... Avoid this!"

"Can."
"Overall, better than I expected.  The aroma was the high light of this tasting experience.  The flavor and the appearance were passable but a little diacetyl would have helped."

"tried it out of the can not so good. could not even finish it. would not recommend this. if you are looking for a NA beer St. Pauli NA ok but I like heavy beers like KaliberI wish they would make a NA beer. Kaliber is made by Kaliber should be a good beer. Malta is a good NA beer is has many good reviews."

"Extremely light bodied with average carbonation. I can't say this beer is horrible because of bad taste. It is horrible because it has no taste. I was curious to try this once and now I know. I will avoid in the future."

"O: Not one of my favorite Low Alcohol Beers - the strange chemical/medicinal quality to the taste of the beer is off-putting and I was not a fan of the honey addition. Would not grab another one of these."

"This was my only option when deployed and has a special place in my memory. Although not a primary choice for beer because of the lack of alcohol, I would recommend for any designated driver or for a fish and chips lunch when alcohol consumption is not an option."

"For those that are avoiding alcohol but still like to have a beer, I""m glad that there are offerings out there for them. This is probably one of the better ones (small sampling as it is) that I've had. Due to the nature of the style, it is incredibly light and has a very weak flavor profile. There is enough flavor however to give those that choose this style an inkling that they're drinking a beer."

"What beer drinkers drink when their not drinkin' beer."

"I reiterate: Who needs alcohol, anyway? Answer from earlier: everybody... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mineral water and dusty grain. The taste brings in some fruity funk for the sake of it, but that just makes things a touch less palatable, frankly. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, if you want such a non-alcoholic option for a beverage, just drink water or soda or something. It's just not worth it to opt for this shit just for the sake of saying you drank something that sorta/kinda had the vague appearance of ""beer""."
"From the green and silver can. I would rather drink this than the two ""bigger brothers"" from the same company. What a surprise."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but is rather watery and has done unusual hints of honey."

"hate to rag on an NA beer, because the fact these exist and are available for those who cant drink because of health, self control, or driving safe reasons is awesome, and i applaud it, but this is a terrible NA beer, and id rather just have water if i have to drive for the night. it pours from the bottle an entirely flat looking yellow wheat color with literally no head at all. the nose is sweet and extracty, corn syrupy almost. the flavor is about the same as the nose, very little redeeming at al about it, and it would barely pass as beer to me in a blind tasting. i dont hate the body, which is sort of medium to light, not watery as i expected, but te carbonation just isnt there. i try to keep a 6er of NA around for soem friends of mine who dont partake anymore, but i wont buy this again. i prefer ever single NA ive ever tasted to this one, how can a beer be this flat and bland? not fair to the sober guys."

"Probably one of the better n/a beers, but then what's the point?"
"It's not really offensive, but at this point you might as well drink a Soda. Not bad for the style though."
""
""
""
"O- it is what it is, however it was more tolerable than some of its light lager counterparts. It just taste more like flavored carbonated water to me. I didn't enjoy anything about this beer, but graded with the style in mind."
""
""
""
"Someone left this at my house so I figure I'll try it. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, coded bottle date. This pours a clear light yellow straw like color with a short lived fizzy large bubbled foamy head which different than most beers. The smells are of adjuncts, no real hop presence. The feel is thin and fizzy. The taste is okay for what it is, not my type of beer but it could be worse, like most other popular beers."

"Overall: ..."

"O: Honestly, not half as bad as some terrible macro light beers I've had. Could have fooled me as a macro light lager of some kind. That said, I'd never reach for it and only accept it as a courtesy to the host. If I couldn't drink at a party, I guess I could find worse things than an O'Doul's."
""
""
""
"When canned, it doesn't have as much flavor to it, and has more of a metallic taste. Bottles are easier to find of this, but since the taste has since improved, I recommend you pick up a bottle of this and give it another try."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some faint hints of grain. Taste is also grains, a touch of malt, actually more flavor than other beers of this style. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while I will be in no rush to have another, it ain't the worst of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was my first low alcohol beer and my expectations were somewhat met concerning it. The biggest disappointment was the smell. The greatest attribute was the heavy carbonation which successfully served as a helpful reminder that you were drinking a beer, despite its low alcohol content."
""
""
"O: Could have been worse, decent beverage for ""Duty Driver""."
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color with a weak white head. Smell is really absent, high carbonation. Smell light some barley malt, really watery mouthfeel. Good for a thirstquencher. It has a pleasent apsect. It is my first low alcohol beer. It is ideal for people that is trying to lower calories or alcoholic intake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Above average when it comes to low alcohol beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light fizzy yellow color w/ a sliver of a white head. Looks like soda to me. Nose is corn, grain, and malt. Very weak, and really not much there. Taste is mainly grain, with weak malt. Very weak, and fairly horrid. Feel is undercarbonated, fizzy and horrible aftertaste. Ugh. Overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone try this, unless you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This wasn't all that bad. Do a blind taste test with this and a number of beers like Natty Light and I bet you'd be surprised how close it is."

"Light bodied with good carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as seltzer water. The body has the consistency of Lipton Iced Tea. The carbonation is a good bit prickly when the beer is held in the mouth. After the beer is swallowed, a slight dryness comes out during the aftertaste."
"It's a very pale yellow in color, pours a decent but short lived white fizzy head,taste is crisp clean and better than most so called ""light"" beers. Good for when you've had enough of the real thing, but you have to stay til closing time!"
" Odoull's is very mild w/ gentle malt influence and slight seltzery quality from the high carbonation which verges almost on mineral with slight spice effect from the prickly bubbles that creates a numbing effect and more of a corn pop tinge as it warms w/ very dry finish. Overall this is not the first choice of beers I would have if looking for an non-alcoholic, but it was a good beer for pairing with a thick burger and seasoned fries"
"For a low-alcohol beer, this is quite nice."
"I get the low/non-alcohol beer thing. It's mostly for people who simply can't handle alcohol (you can call them alcoholics, if you like). It's noble and very much a life-or-death thing for them to stay away from alcohol. It's the light beer drinkers that are fooling themselves. In any case, this is not terrible...I've had worse 5% lagers, that's but sure. But still, there's got to be better low/non-alcohol beer out there than O'Doul's...I've heard the Germans have been doing some okay stuff in that department."
"O - Overall, shocked at this beer. I guess if you cant drink beers anymore this doesnt taste all that bad. I've had much worse lagers."
"For a non-alcoholic beer, this isn't too bad, refreshing and very similar to light beers. Also shares the problems of light beer where it's very watery, but that's expected. I'd recommend this if you had to get beer from this style."
"Okay, not too bad for a near beer and better than many full ABV cousins. I still see no point in these creations. I am one who drinks beer for its taste, while many NASCAR beer drinkers do so to fit in or to get a buzz. Getting that buzz relaxes them and allows them to fit in better. Note: I did say ""most"". I do realize some people like the taste of the beers advertised on stock cars. Everyone has their own taste."
"Seriously, I want my dollar back."
"Light golden straw color. Seems to be very carbonated. Foamy white head with moderated retention. Smell is very grainy. Lots of corn and straw and a bit metallic. Taste like a cheap mass produced beer. Actually this taste better than some other alcoholic BMC products Ive had. Sweet corn, hops barley pulls through. Mouth feel seems to be very carbonated and kinda watery. pretty much the only aspect of the beer that needs some work. everything else is typical. I cant remember when I last drank a NA beer. I don't remember it being this good. Not to say this beer is good or anything. Its just not horrible."
"M: The mouthfeel is malty clean, sweet at times. A malted drink, water with some heft."
"Overall... I didn't really like this beer, but it isn't a complete turn-off to the world of alcohol-free beer."
"Taste? Not much. Like many adjunct lagers (BMC) I get a stale musky, grain thing. Damp sweet. Thankfully not all that strong. Not sure why you would drink this. Taste? Hope not. But, that's what it is, I guess"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow, fizzy with carbonation, and a thin layer of fizzy bubbles for a head. Almost nothing in the smell, other than skunk and old grain husks. Taste is of stale Cheerios marinated in old bathwater, except thinner. Very light bodied, and pretty hard to choke down, especially when you remember that you won't get drunk at all by drinking this, so it won't get better with the more you drink."
"My dad used to have loads of this crap and Sharps. At .99 cent in the singles pile, figured this would be a good weekday beer. Boy was I wrong, it just left me all pissed off afterwards."
"I wanted to try this, honestly I expected a lot worse. This brew wasn't overly tasteless. It tasted like most American Lagers do. It has a golden yellow color, has the flavor of a regular pale lager. Surprisingly enough this beer is a pretty good choice for someone who can't have much alcohol. For me though, I won't need to seek this out again unless it's for a prank on someone or something like that."
"Just above drinking water/liquid bread."
"The CPJ"
"This is how I amuse myself in the slow moments. It is probably a good thing for society that I am usually kept busy. My pour created better than a finger of bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me of so many AALs that I have reviewed that I wondered which ""finest natural ingredients"" were used. At least no unnatural ingredients, like plastic (right, Minhas or should I say, the Cybermen Brewery) were harmed in the making of this brew. Mouthfeel was thin, not quite watery, but mot by much. It had a wheat-y, corn-y cereal taste in the mouth to the point that I thought it might have been liquid Chex Mix. Oh man, this was so boring that it could have put Muzak to sleep. Finish woke me up to tell me that it was leaving. What a snoozefest! Thank goodness that I am not consigned to a steady diet of N.A.s!"
"D- This beer is not bad for what it is suppose to be. My palate though after first sip started to feel this weird numbing feeling which is why I rated it as low as I did. Not a beer I want to visit again but glad I tried it at least once."
"D- I can imagine worse. I mean it's not much worse tasting than most light lagers out there... I just wouldn't ever drink it by choice."
"This was my first non-alcoholic beer, but I'm genuinely impressed with how much it was unlike regular beers in the American Adjunct category. Decent taste and mouthfeel. Not amazing but pretty normal really, which I would assume for this style is very good. I would have another one. Why not? It's not offensive at all."
"Pours a nasty looking piss straw yellow with a white head and lacing that isn't present. Smells like grain and a little corn. Tastes weak with a little corn and some grain. Mouthfeel is really super than and leaves much to be desired. Drinkability is high because it has like no alcohol."
"It gets bonus points for being water, but that's about it. It was actually not the worst tasting of the group at all."
"I asked before: is it good? My answer: not really. While it tastes like beer, that's because it SHOULD. After all why try marketing a beer substitute if it isn't going to resemble the real thing. O'Douls might compare to a light beer in flavor, but even then it's pretty weak. Better than the low carb beers for sure, but I have to believe there is better non/low alcohol beers out there than this."
"Definitely not something I want to drink ever again. I would rather have a glass of water than this."
"O'doul's pours a clear light straw with no head. The aroma is light and grainy with some hints of cooked corn. The flavor is thin and watery, with some grainy malt flavor. This is my first low alcohol beer, and overall I am not impressed, but if you told me this was light beer, I would probably believe you."
"Crystal clear, light gold colour with a quickly dissipating cap of white foam. A thin collar is supported by a constant stream of bubbles, seems highly carbonated, and there was a bit of transient lacing. Strong aroma of cooked veggies, very sulfury, quite unpleasant. Low bitterness with a sticky malt sweetness. Not much in the way of flavour beyond sharp mineral notes at the end. Light bodied and dry, watery and thin, with lots of carbonation. I didn't expect much and I wasn't surprised. I don't ever expect to have this again."
"I wasn't impressed at all, apart from its initial looks."
"even though i have reason to believe that this bottle was skunked, i couldn't or wouldn't willingly drink this again. it's too bad that alcoholics have to deal with this sort of punishment. yugh! im going to pour this out and grab a Bigfoot"
"Overall: A perfect beer to get drunk on...cough cough."
"Having gotten the bad out of the way, I'll say that it serves in what it is designed to do - satisfy a taste for beer when it's inappropriate to be drinking alcohol. It's certainly no worse than the domestic macrobrews that so many swear by (i.e. Budweiser, MGD, etc.) I'll buy it again when I need to keep my wits about me."
"D- I tried to review this beer for what it is. A light beer with very little alcohol. I was not expecting a huge complex beer or something that would knock my socks off. For what it is, it is a pretty decent brew to knock back a few of them in a sitting without getting a buzz."
"D: It was drinkable and I thank God that time has passed and now can fully enjoy real beers."
"Not bad at all. Looks dull, but if you're in the mood for slugging a few brews with zero chance of a buzz, this isn't a bad call."
"I see this beers better qualities. It does have some flavor, and it does do some characteristics good. I can't imagine it's easy (but I really don't know so I could be wrong) to make a N/A beer. I see this brew for what it is. I don't like it, but it is what it is."
"D - With the age on this thing I was expecting to be close to a barf. No joke. But it's not even ""bad"" per se. It can't be bad when there is nothing there to be bad really. It's totally devoid of any flavor! God damn prohibition must have been awful with legal beer like this."
"Pours a very light color with a not bad white head. The smell is somewhat earthy, but not in a good way--more in the way of an old basement. The flavor isn't really off in any particular way--perhaps a little bit of cardboard--but in reality there just isn't much there. Mouthfeel is light with quite a bit of carbonation. Drinkability is similar to seltzer water--just not much about it that would keep me drinking more, but nothing too horrible either."
" ~ I don't think this is a brew I'd care to sample much more than this one time. I feel sorry for my beautiful wife that she has to endure this as a beer-staple for the next five and half months due to our expecting a baby in late March. This is a true sacrifice."
"***Here's where this beer really gets crazy, though; the freshness date is September '08. This beer held up damn well considering the average life span of a macro is a little more than three months! Maybe it got better with age...?"
"Yes, it doesn't get you drunk. But aside from that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I guess this whole time I *have* actually been drinking beer mostly because it tastes good!"
"Typical nose of raw grain and with no negative influences. Touch of nondescript vegetal flavors don't deter. Flavor follows suit and is light and grainy without being too thin. Feel and drink are slightly better than average for the style though there seems to be little variation in that regard in my experience. Like many of the style this is best consumed directly from the bottle or added in short increments to a glass so as to maintain a crisp carbonation."
"Drinkability? I mean, it's not the worst thing ever, but there isn't much of a use for it. Although, I would put this on par with most bmc's. Slightly more drinkable even."
"Drinkability: While this might not be the worst thing in the world, I just kept asking myself: What's the point? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the taste of beer, but if it's not getting me somewhat buzzed, I just don't see the point. For pure taste, this isn't bad; for beer, I wouldn't drink it again."
"D: Nah, not even memories of sharing them with ol grand dad could make this one, one that I would buy again."
"This beer poured a clear yellow color with white foam that settled to a thin coat on the surface of the beer. The smell was not so bad, at least it was beer-like. There was some malt aroma and a touch of sweetness (corn?). The taste was lightly sweet (again, is this brewed with corn?) and a very low malt flavor. These give way to discernible hops at the finish. The mouthfeel was overall dry with very light body and low carbonation. A grain sweetness and faint hops linger in the finish. This was an OK beer for what it is, and if you are going alcohol free, it would be an OK choice."
"I can't totally pan this one."
"I'm no expert on near beer by any means, but this beer met my expectations and served as a fair stand-in for the real thing. I probably will buy it again in the future."
"overall one of the better n/a's."
"D Excellent but I will not be testing its drinkability anytime soon."
"Conclusion: What began (and failed, after about a month) as a Lenten exercise has now led me to drink NA beer a couple of nights during the week to save calories and money; they are what they are, I'm not going to argue that NA beers are super tasty or anything because even the best are mediocre by normal standards; that being said, this and Busch NA are about the only ones worth drinking."
"Eh, it's a non-alcoholic beer. What do you expect? It's inoffensive though. You'd pretty much have to drink a 30 pack just to get drunk. If that's your thing, then by all means, do it."
"This pours out a limpid pale pale gold color with no head. The nose is very bland, a touch grainy, with a little sulpheric note I think. Not too bad of a flavor, actually. It's too sweet, with hardly the slightest hint of hops, but it doesn't taste bad the way some some non-alcohol beers do. Very bland. More beery than Keystone Light!"
"dr: Okay. It's not flavorful, not really *good* beer, just a light weight (really light) beer when I want a beer w/ lunch before going for a motorcycle ride. A harmless self-delusion."
"D- OK for what it is. Not much going on."
"I'm not really ready to admit that this is a beer. Taste is completely below average and doesn't have any special characteristics. Very bland. Little head that dissipates quickly and a sub-par smell. Color is pale and mostly unattractive. Stay away from this one. As far as flavor is concerned, this ones a no go."
"D: Not bad for an NA. Pretty much Bud with the alcohol zapped out of it."
"M + D: It could ease up on the carbonation a little, though it does have a fairly decent density in the body - only in beer do I ever like my bodies 'dense.' It's a reasonable shot, though the rice aromas and flavours seem to be a bit of a move in the wrong direction when trying to reproduce the 'flavours of beer' without the alcohol content. Drinking something that hopes to reproduce such a flavour when not wanting alcohol always seems like a rather unusual idea, too, but that's just me. It was ultimately drinkable, and I wouldn't pour it down the toilet by any means. I just don't see myself going after it again any time soon."
"Pours a clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, little white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is grainy/ricey. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy/ricey. Light body. Not drinkable, not too much to this brew, not recommended. I guess some people like this brew, but not me."
"I admit I was always curious about what a NA beer tasted like, but I only picked this up at my Dad's request. Comes in a green bottle and pours like golden and thin with minimal head like so many of the classics. Very drinkable and similar in taste to some of the classics as well, except for one detail...the smell. This is the stinkiest beer I've ever had. As soon as I twisted off the cap the smell actually came and found me. I've heard of certain beers smelling ""skunky", but this one is the first I've had that perfectly fits that description. Even some of the aftertaste is skunk and if you dare belch, more skunk. Other than the smell, it goes down very easy, but why shouldn't it? There's nothing in it but bubbles. If you're in the market for a NA beer, try to sample them in small quantities before committing to a sixer. I believe Coors and Busch offer one."
"D - This actually isn't that bad, certainly not as bad as I'd prepared myself for. Of course there are other things, but for a non-beer beer, it's not half bad."
"Grabbed one from my buddies fridge as I was walking out the door one early morning. He bought it for his pregnant wife, but she thought it was nasty so it sat there in the back of his fridge. ""What a great opportunity to be able to check off this category without wasting any money"" I thought to myself so here I am drinking what is in essence a decent looking N/A brew that contains no taste and aroma. Pours a golden yellow color with intense carbonation and a frothy head that lasts. The appearance is very nice, better than Bud, Busch, and their light cousins. Aroma is non-existent the only scent I can muster is cardboard. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy but that's about it. The flavor is also absent from this one. Overall a weak beer, but I wasn't expecting anything special."
"That said, I've had worse. O'Doul's is not a complete disaster -- I would never drink it voluntarily, but it compares favorably to some mass-market light-beers and macro lagers."
"This was my first and only non alcoholic beer ever. I just can't justify this over water. It looks ok with a yellow color and faint tan head. Neither the nose or taste are anything worth while. Bland bitter grains. The body is light and fizzy like soda. I really will never drink this again."
"Not beer."
"clear, yellowish body that has no smell really. Taste is light and airy, a tad sweetness is overpowered by barley and water. This stuff doesn't dry out the mouth, which is good. Then again, that's because there is nothing in here except water and barley. I will take a soda anyday, but I guess I can see why people trying to quit alcohol but still like a cold ""beer"" here and there will spend money on it."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of pale yellow, with a light white head - nose of skunk, corn, slight banana, but barely smells like anything resembling a beer - taste of sweet white corn, some bitterness, and bubble gum- no body super watery, and with light carbonation  aftertaste of slightly bitter, and candy"
"D: Good if you want a beer but don't want the alcohol, easy to drink, since it is basically nothing more than malt-flavoured soda water, but I usually want something with a little more body and flavour."
"Could drink these all day because it is practically water with some barley thrown in the mix"
"This malt beverage pours with a slight tawny colored head, and crisp aroma. It has a light amber color and good carbonation. It has a light malty taste, with a slight hint of caramel without the bite of alcoholic beer. However, it does not have the full-bodied, robust flavor of alcoholic beer, which results in a somewhat weak flavor as compared to alcoholic beer."
"Pours to a thin white head and leaves bits of lace; clear yellow-gold color. Aroma is a welcome blend of noble hops and sweet malt, more like a European lager or a Michelob than a standard American lager. Flavor is mostly carbonated water and slightly grainy/malty with a surprisingly adequate hop balance and a noticeable absence of alcohol warmth and sweetness. It is ""dusty"" and dry both in flavor and mouthfeel--it does not feel like beer but rather more like club soda or tonic. It is relatively easy to drink and smells/tastes just like a premium U.S. lager at first sip, but the lack of substantial alcohol makes this beer taste less and less like beer and more like something other than beer as you drink it. It is a passable and ""safe"" alternative for beer when you want something to cool off with or wash down food. It is only 65 calories, so a good choice if you want to eliminate empty calories from your diet. The lack of alcohol is a welcome thing if you are a designated driver or on medication but still want to experience some malt and hops. It serves its purpose well, but it is still not quite the real thing."
"D - Not as bad as I thought it would be. It's by no means good, but this is actually better than Michelob Ultra or Bud Select, and those actually have booze in them. Not a bad choice when you can't drink beer...it's better than soda!"
"In all fairness, though, it IS a nonalcoholic beer. It would be like buying a Yugoslavian compact car and expecting Corvette performance. I guess it fulfills it's purpose. If you're a pregnant woman with no other option, a raging recovering drunk, or a tutu-wearing fourth-grade girl.... This is the beer for you."
"What an odd experience- this NA beer is absolutly the cleanest going down the throat of any beer I've had. There is no bite, like a old dog without his dentures. The smell is of light bread, and the taste is slightly corny, but also slightly bready, almost as if they had soaked Wonderbread in water and then bottled it."
"overall, i couldnt see drinking another of these, i thought i would try it though since my buddy offered"
""
"Drinkability - The style is insipid and the beer is nothing special. I guess one could drink this if one had to, but I don't."
"so i'm giving up beer for lent and figured i'd give a NA a try. i've never had an urge to try one of these brews but i figured what the hell. it looks like a regular macro lager and it actually smells better than most. as far as ab products go this one is definitly one of their better smelling. definite hop aroma and no skunk. the taste is similar to a regular macro lager but it almost seems seltzer like to me. i think it actually tastes like seltzer and beer mixed together with alcohol removed. not horrible but not great...i'll give some other NA's a try and see how this compares, but for right now i guess it'll suffice"
"Yeah, these NA brews tend to be a little watery, but I don't think this one is worse than the rest of the group. They are easy to drink, maybe a little too easy, because if you are buying at the bar or restaurant because you are driving, they aren't cheap. Spent 7 bucks on two of them last night."
"Really pretty unpleasant. A relative who doesn't drink alcohol left one of these at my house and I thought I'd review it. Ocassionally I've had one of these when I was on painkillers and couldn't drink. I'd say there were better low to non alcohol beers out there. Pours an extremely yellow color with lots of bubbles but no head. The smell is really awful, like the bottom of a trash can. Rotting vegetables. The taste is just beareable, with lots of corny flavors and a kind of soapiness. The mouthfeel is partly crisp,partly soapy with little body. Just barely drinkable- if you have to. If you are looking for a .5% beer, this will do in a pinch, but try a german or even kaliber for something marginally better. If you merely want a low alcohol beer, try a Berliner kindl weiss at 2.5%"
"Originally reviewed on September 24, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Barely yellow pour, with a huge head of white. Greasy skank aroma. Ive drank water with more flavor. Can I give this negative flavor points? Ill give it a 2, because its not entirely offensive. Finish hurts though, with stinging corn fusels. Damn glad to get this style out of the way."
"I don't know whether it'll be reflected in the score of not, but I think that O'Doul's is the best low alcohol beer that I've ever had. It's certainly the least offensive, and that's all that really matters when it comes to the impossible task of brewing good beer while leaving out one of its essential ingredients. Anheuser-Busch should be proud. They now have two NA Shootout (With Blanks) trophies to grace their corporate mantlepiece."
"D - It tasted like beer, just not like a ""typical"" beer. It's my first try at a NA beer so I don't have any grounds for comparison to other NAs."
"If your stuck with a non-alcoholic barley-pop situation, this isn't a bad way to go...right up there with St. Pauligirl NA. I wouldn't wish that upon you however!"
"It leaves a clean, but rather flat feel. I can see how someone who can't have alcohol for some reason might be refreshed by it. Considering its style, it's not bad. Actually, it's probably at least as good as most macro lights. Not something that I personally would go for though. (If I can't have a beer, I most likely won't. I based the scores on the style - not so much personal preference.)"
" Bottom Line is that this is easily the best near beer I've had to date, I'd reccommend this to any N/A drinker. I'm just reviewing this beer for the taste, not the alcohol level."
"Cheers!"
"But the bottle is very nice... Have I said it before? Sorry."
"I question why anyone would actually purchase this product (and admittedly, I've never understood the point of N/A beer). If you're the designated driver, then drink fruit juice, pop, water...anything...i mean, why this? Luckily, this one was free."
"Not a bad N/A beer. Like most, it's best ice cold. My wife drinks this and puts a lime in it; I have to say it's really not half bad."
"Pours a crystal clear straw, with a 1/2 finger of fizzy head that is totally devoid of retention or lacing. Clean nose, faint grainy adjunct and corn smell. The sweet taste of corn adjunct dominates the overall flavor. The aftertaste has a pleasent euro-hop skunk that fades before it become annoying and gives some degree of character to the beer. It's boring and extra light, but I'm sure thats how the brewers intended a NA beer to be; so I'd have to say it has a good balance. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel as well. Medium carbonation and a thin body that finishes mostly clean with a touch of dry euro-hops. Highly drinkable and nails the style."
"Some final notes: Not bad but I prefer the Amber. It is also sad that the best Aunheuser-Busch has to offer is N/A."
"($4.56 / 6-pack)"
"poured a very pale yellow color with a large head head to start that quickly left. Smell is very grainy with the same maltiness (somewhat unpleasant but possible to get used to) in other low or no alcohol beers. Taste is somewhat sweet and not enjoyable at first, but improves with subsequent tastes. Finishe is wet and kind of refreshing. OK for an NA."
"Well, it is a non alcoholic beer, I can not say much about it, but what it is for sure, is that it was not that bad, I mean, one have to be concerning that it is a low degree alcohol beer and you have to rate as one of it. But the colour was nice, the foam, just present, and the mouthfeel was not that bad, I would drink another one."
"This beer is one of the best beer of this worst brewer, may be is for the low in alcohol, is special for the mexican food, american food, buddies meeting, without the ""funny"" of the alcohol, is low in adjoincts aroma´s, very recommendable, taste over the average, drinkability in general is good"
"Eeeeek ghaaad.... The things I do for you guys....I've had this in the past but had to get it on tap to review for you guys as I feel its my duty. Chili's in westwood had this on tap for a short time and I'm reviewing this off notes, it still raises hairs. poured a flat super clear light golden color with high carbonation. I thought it smelled like a wheat festival. I know what this beer is trying to be but it is awful at acheiving any taste or body that is interesting at all. Drinkability is low as well because its not interesting in th least....no thanks."
"Crystal clear pale gold with a big bubble head that falls to a firm ring. Smell is corn and mild biscuit, no skunk on this one...lucky me. Taste is typical for a light beer...crispy, nearly flavorless, with a watery corn juice finish. Mouthfeel was thin but much higher than I anticipated. Actually, not a bad drinking NA. If you have to have one, you could do much worse."
"razor thin body and diet soda mouthfeel. if you can not drink beer, stick to water, it's better than this."
"Initial taste is that of a watery barley. One gets the impression of beer from this N/A beer but there is total lack of flavor and complexity."
"Tasting: Grass and grain were the predominant flavors across the tongue with this beer. I didn't detect much of either hop bitterness or malt sweetness. In actuality, it was somewhat flavorless. Mouthfeel was watery and plain, making this not very pleasant. It's possible that I would have another one, served ice cold."
"There simply isn't much to be said about this low alcohol beer... It's as clear as it gets, as pale as it gets. No other nose than boring cereals, carbonated water taste with an unpleasant aftertaste This is foul, devoided of taste, perhaps one of the less tasty beers I've ever had. Must avoid."
"Pours too big a head out of the bottle, like a heavily processed head-like aglommeration. Color is the usual Budweiser pale straw. Can't pick up odor at all, but I guess no smell is better than a bad smell, so extra points there. Taste seems sometimes nonexistent, sometimes like some mutant strain of sugar, and where the hell are the hops? That six of Clausthaler I had is really starting to look much better, in retrospect. Gassy as any other AB product."
"As the designated driver at a wedding, after a few Saranacs, I switched to NA beer for the evening. Ive had ODouls in the past, but this was the first time Id had it in years. Its yellow, very clear, and presents a moderate white head. The aroma reminds me of cereal grains and seltzer water. Theres not a lot of flavor, but it tastes similar to an average macro. Im not a soda drinker, and I wouldnt mind having this again, if I didnt have a choice."
"Drinkability is watery, better than some NA beers but, not quite as good as a Budweiser."
"Very clear... must be pale yellow on the pour. Head, I dunno, I drank it from the bottle. It's fizzy and slightly bitter. Hey it must be beer! Actually it wasn't that bad... Not the thinnest beer I've had, surprisingly. Not much taste though. The amber is much better."
"I prefer Goya's Malta soft drink, it's not brewed but made from malt and hops, they just don't add the yeast."
"Much, much better than I expected. If I were out and didn't want to drink alcohol, this would be my choice. It looked, tasted, and drank as good as any full-alcohol macro-light-lager. Good show."
"Extremely watery. No detectable aroma. No hop taste. Tastes like tonic water with a metallic twinge. They must've done something to increase the flavor in this NA as it has at least a semblance of taste whereas it didn't a few years ago. Very drinkable (due to watery nature). Not as good as the Amber version."
"Notes: I could have confused this with a regular light beer  perhaps one of the most beery NA beers around."
"I actually didn't buy this with any intention of drinking more than a single bottle of the six pack. I buy non-alcoholics specifically for the purpose of cooking with them, so I won't have to sack something I'd rather drink. If you must drink it, however, you could do a lot worse. It's certainly drinkable, which is what you're really looking for in a non-alcoholic anyway. A friend of mine claimed it tasted like ""watered down weasel piss," which is probably a fair assessment, but unfortunately that's just enough to make it one of the best of it's kind."
"When I poured this beer into my glass, it poured a large white creamy head with small-medium sized bubbles.The body was clear with carbonation and the hue was yellow.There was good lacing with this beer.The flavor was relatively smooth and the mouthfeel was watery and thin."
"Sickly pale gold, translucent, minimal animation, underdeveloped soapy white head, no retention, no lace. The nose is uninviting, husky, grainy funky smells like Science Diet dog food. Rather flavorless, husky, grainy with a minimal influence of hops or malt a whisper of cooked vegetables. Quick finish; empty no enjoyment in drinking this one. Moderate carbonation, medium-light body, this part of ODouls is decent. If you want an N/A try a Clausthaler Premium and if youre just thirsty, drink water."
"i really don't understand the point of non-alcoholic brew, but i'll try anything, so here goes: actually poured a nicer colour than expected. still piss yellow all the same but slightly deeper than the standard a-b piss yellow. that's the only thing going for this one, which isn't very impressive. the green bottle brought the exoected skunky flavouring, which prevailed over any other tastes here, which were pretty much non-existant save for a slight hint of maltiness every now and again. watery, watery, watery. not very enjoyable. kinda like (bad) beer flavoured seltzer water."
"Not a bad effort for a non-acoholic beer. Of course there is some acohol, but not much. Certainly not enough to add any flavor or body overtone. The appearance is not that bad, nor is the malty nose. The flavor is actually BTB, but not by much. An OK offering if you've got to have beer, but can't have the alcohol. But in all honesty, what's the point?"
"Light golden color with sparkling clarity, a small white head, lively streams of carbonation, excellent lace. The appearance is absolutely correct for a light American lager. Solid malt aroma with moderate hop notes. Taste begins with solid grain flavors and much less of the sticky sweetness often found in NA beers, carbonation stings slightly to good effect. The hops that are present in the aroma are largely absent from the taste, save for perhaps a whisper. Finish is clean and dry. The mouth feel is fairly good. Considering that this is a non-alcoholic beer, its a remarkably good effort."
"Pours dry like a typical N/A brew. Decent head with lacing abound. Taste is dry and smooth. Malt is there, mostly from grains and in particular, corn. This a decent example of the type. I would try this again for a good N/A American lager. Best if served ice cold."
"I've got to hand it to Anheuser-Busch for brewing one of the most authentic tasting NA's. Of course, it still tastes like a bland American lager, but what do you expect? On the other hand, it doesn't really stand out as not having alcohol. It doesn't have that dull and sticky malt character that many NA's have; or should I say it has it to a lesser extent where it's not continually noticed and distracting. It's got a nice golden appearance with a short and creamy bright-white head that immediately drops to a thin collar. That, of course, also happens with most standard American lagers! The aroma expresses some non-alcohol character with a starchy, semi-sweet, grainy note that's decidedly different than a regular beer. Once you get past that difference, however, it's actually fairly nice. There are no hops present, but again, we are talking American lager here. The body is light with a fine, median carbonation. It's lightly crisp and then mildly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is as might be expected from the aroma with a softly sweet grainy malt that's well-balanced by a mild, underlying hop bitterness. It finishes drying with some residual maltiness. Very nicely done and highly recommended amongst NA's of this style."
"I finally broke down and tried one of these they were giving away at the Convention Center in Anaheim during a reception. Any curiosity I had is now sated. I'll get more wine instead next time I have the choice. How could anyone like this? By definition this is not really even beer."
"Big full head with gold color. Looks like a typical Am. lager. Mostly sweet water aroma with some tinniness/metalic qualities, with some malt. Taste is non-distinct, yet somehow not excessively watery. Little less of sweet water taste than many. Some metalic tones. Seems a little less thin that many, with a satifactory carbonation. Other than being a N/A, there is nothing terrifically wrong with this. It'll do if a N/A is required, but the European ones are generally better."
"This may be the ugliest beer I've ever come across. It was so pale yellow, it almost looked a bit gray. Very strange. That aside, it had a thin, grainy aroma and a touch of floral hops. I was really impressed because AB gave their NA beer a hop aroma that their regular beers lack. The beer had a macro, super-carbonation, thin mouthfeel. It had only a very faint malt tase. The other flavor / aroma struck me as odd. It could only be percieved by retronasally. It was a very faint, soft fruit. It reminded me of Diet Snapple Peach Iced Tea. Very strange."
"Light straw with slight head and lace. Slight sweet aroma with dextrin cooked grain nose. Light and slightly fizzy.  Somewhat skunky taste, like beer that hasn't had enough time to ferment (duh, its a NA).  Finishes slightly cabbagy.  Still, not bad for a NA."
"They claim there is no alcohol, but there is. They claim it is a beer but I have my doubts. Is this brewed for 12 step programs or for giving to people you don't want at your party? I tried it and found it bland, tasteless. I think this is the water they use to wash out the brewing barrels."
"Odouls is a slight of everything Brew, no yummy malt, no well bittered hops bite, just a lot of gas (carbonation) and if you ask me, its a slightly boring Brew."
