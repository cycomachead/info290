The nose comprises mineral water and dusty grain. The taste brings in some fruity funk for the sake of it, but that just makes things a touch less palatable, frankly. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, if you want such a non-alcoholic option for a beverage, just drink water or soda or something.

It is ""dusty"" and dry both in flavor and mouthfeel--it does not feel like beer but rather more like club soda or tonic. It is relatively easy to drink and smells/tastes just like a premium U.S. lager at first sip, but the lack of substantial alcohol makes this beer taste less and less like beer and more like something other than beer as you drink it. It is a passable and ""safe"" alternative for beer when you want something to cool off with or wash down food. It is only 65 calories, so a good choice if you want to eliminate empty calories from your diet.

2.46,24.2,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Extremely watery. No detectable aroma. No hop taste. Tastes like tonic water with a metallic twinge. They must've done something to increase the flavor in this NA as it has at least a semblance of taste whereas it didn't a few years ago. Very drinkable (due to watery nature). Not as good as the Amber version.","proc","Sep 10, 2003"

1.78,-10.1,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,2,"I actually didn't buy this with any intention of drinking more than a single bottle of the six pack. I buy non-alcoholics specifically for the purpose of cooking with them, so I won't have to sack something I'd rather drink. If you must drink it, however, you could do a lot worse. It's certainly drinkable, which is what you're really looking for in a non-alcoholic anyway. A friend of mine claimed it tasted like ""watered down weasel piss," which is probably a fair assessment, but unfortunately that's just enough to make it one of the best of it's kind.","SetarconeX","Aug 04, 2003"

2.03,2.5,2.5,2,2,3,1.5,"Sickly pale gold, translucent, minimal animation, underdeveloped soapy white head, no retention, no lace. The nose is uninviting, husky, grainy funky smells like Science Diet dog food. Rather flavorless, husky, grainy with a minimal influence of hops or malt a whisper of cooked vegetables. Quick finish; empty no enjoyment in drinking this one. Moderate carbonation, medium-light body, this part of ODouls is decent. If you want an N/A try a Clausthaler Premium and if youre just thirsty, drink water.","bditty187","Jun 03, 2003"

2.2,11.1,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Not a bad effort for a non-acoholic beer. Of course there is some acohol, but not much. Certainly not enough to add any flavor or body overtone. The appearance is not that bad, nor is the malty nose. The flavor is actually BTB, but not by much. An OK offering if you've got to have beer, but can't have the alcohol. But in all honesty, what's the point?","AtLagerHeads","Apr 14, 2003"
3.23,63.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Light golden color with sparkling clarity, a small white head, lively streams of carbonation, excellent lace. The appearance is absolutely correct for a light American lager. Solid malt aroma with moderate hop notes. Taste begins with solid grain flavors and much less of the sticky sweetness often found in NA beers, carbonation stings slightly to good effect. The hops that are present in the aroma are largely absent from the taste, save for perhaps a whisper. Finish is clean and dry. The mouth feel is fairly good. Considering that this is a non-alcoholic beer, its a remarkably good effort.","Pegasus","Mar 27, 2003"
2.65,33.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours dry like a typical N/A brew. Decent head with lacing abound. Taste is dry and smooth. Malt is there, mostly from grains and in particular, corn. This a decent example of the type. I would try this again for a good N/A American lager. Best if served ice cold.","Rifrafboy","Mar 14, 2003"
3.33,68.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I've got to hand it to Anheuser-Busch for brewing one of the most authentic tasting NA's. Of course, it still tastes like a bland American lager, but what do you expect? On the other hand, it doesn't really stand out as not having alcohol. It doesn't have that dull and sticky malt character that many NA's have; or should I say it has it to a lesser extent where it's not continually noticed and distracting. It's got a nice golden appearance with a short and creamy bright-white head that immediately drops to a thin collar. That, of course, also happens with most standard American lagers! The aroma expresses some non-alcohol character with a starchy, semi-sweet, grainy note that's decidedly different than a regular beer. Once you get past that difference, however, it's actually fairly nice. There are no hops present, but again, we are talking American lager here. The body is light with a fine, median carbonation. It's lightly crisp and then mildly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is as might be expected from the aroma with a softly sweet grainy malt that's well-balanced by a mild, underlying hop bitterness. It finishes drying with some residual maltiness. Very nicely done and highly recommended amongst NA's of this style.","NeroFiddled","Jan 18, 2003"

2.96,49.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Big full head with gold color. Looks like a typical Am. lager. Mostly sweet water aroma with some tinniness/metalic qualities, with some malt. Taste is non-distinct, yet somehow not excessively watery. Little less of sweet water taste than many. Some metalic tones. Seems a little less thin that many, with a satifactory carbonation. Other than being a N/A, there is nothing terrifically wrong with this. It'll do if a N/A is required, but the European ones are generally better.","garymuchow","Nov 24, 2002"
2.4,21.2,1,3.5,2,2,2.5,"This may be the ugliest beer I've ever come across. It was so pale yellow, it almost looked a bit gray. Very strange. That aside, it had a thin, grainy aroma and a touch of floral hops. I was really impressed because AB gave their NA beer a hop aroma that their regular beers lack. The beer had a macro, super-carbonation, thin mouthfeel. It had only a very faint malt tase. The other flavor / aroma struck me as odd. It could only be percieved by retronasally. It was a very faint, soft fruit. It reminded me of Diet Snapple Peach Iced Tea. Very strange.","yen157","Nov 09, 2002"
2.3,16.2,2,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Light straw with slight head and lace. Slight sweet aroma with dextrin cooked grain nose. Light and slightly fizzy.
