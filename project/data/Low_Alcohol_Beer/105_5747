It is a refreshing beer, but it doesn't have any remarkable qualities. Its aroma is that of a typical American lager, again on the lighter side. It's slightly above average and makes what I like to call a good utility beer - good after mowing the grass, while out on a boat, or watching kids. It's a thin beer that could use more grain flavor.","mhck","May 17, 2013"

It poured with a finger of bone white head that made like Houdini and disappeared before my very eyes! Magic. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was strangely vegetable-like, reminiscent of farmer's market while in season. I do not think that I have ever encountered anything like this in a beer. Mouthfeel was thin, approaching medium, with a slight bitter bite and lots of carbonation on the tongue. Man, I CANnot get past the smell every time I lift the glass near my nose. The worst part is that the beer does not taste like it smells! How did they achieve this? Finish was slightly bitter, kind of tasty, not bad, actually. Still, it is not going into my cooler any time soon.","woodychandler","May 29, 2010"

The aroma is faint and of cereal grains. No hop presence at all. The first taste is actually a little sweet. Its watery and hollow. On the other hand, compared to a lot of other NA brews, this one has at least some flavor and notable characteristics. Its not great, but it is better than most.","Suds","Jun 14, 2005"
2.66,64.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"My first foray into non-alcoholic beers. Sharp's was among the cheapest. The beer is a very light platinum and the head is larger and more lasting than any other mass-produced American beer I can think of, alcohol or no. It's the typical smell, too, with a light vegetable and mineral quality. Reminiscent of sporting events. I was truly expecting the worst from this beer, but it actually has some good qualities. There's a reasonable amount of flavor and I'll be damned if it doesn't scratch that beer itch. It washed down a slice of pizza with aplomb. Of course, Sharp's is nothing to get excited about, but if you're abstaining from alcohol (as I am, due to painkillers I am taking for an injury) and are looking for a bargain, this is a good place to start. In fact, the prospect of no alcohol is not as bleak as I imagined. But keep in mind it's been a while since real beer has passed my lips.","Thrasher","May 07, 2005"

Too bad this NA beer tastes nothing of beer. Pours a flat yellow macro color with no smell to speak of, very weak. The taste is of water and really nothing substantial. Mouthfeel is light and putrid.

This is the most inappropriate name for a consumer product since the automobile Nova (translates to ""Does not go"" in Spanish). So maybe I am stretching a bit but the only reason is because I really cannot find anything worth mentioning about this flacid near-beer. Weak color, no aroma to speak of. Has the character of water after passing through a colander full of rice. Watery and pathetic finish. On top of all these wonderful attributes there is not even any alcohol content, which can sometimes be the saving grace for even the most putrid of beers (many of which are incidentally made by this very same brewer). If someone didn't leave one of these in my fridge I never would have bothered. Curiosity killed the cat in this case.","Dogbrick","Jul 11, 2003"

Actually, the carbonation looks like it belongs with a well-made microbrew, lots of small, slow-rising bubbles. Aroma of cooked cereal and faint hops, not much else. Taste yields fairly sharp, spritzy carbonation, subdued maltiness and some watered down hops towards the finish. It would be fairly refreshing on a hot day, I think. Still, it is a non-alcoholic beer from a macro brewer. This, in my opinion, limits the possibilities of such a brew.","Pegasus","Mar 02, 2003"
