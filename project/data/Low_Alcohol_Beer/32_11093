3.47,46.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"First things first - this is a non alcoholic beer. All comments should be interpreted through this lens. Becks NA is hoppy and tasty. Though there is not much of a head, it had a great flavor and goes down smooth. I could down one if these on a hot day in about 3 seconds. I should also note that I prefer NA beer when it is Ice cold. The one I am reviewing came from the porch at 32 degrees. Yum!! Cold, smooth, delicious!!!!","Chrispyhorne","Aug 25, 2013"

2.6,9.7,3.25,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,""For when you don't wanna even approach drunkenness with your beer..." Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises hard water, very light generic grains, and a twinge of the vaguest sense of flowers possible. The taste brings in more of the same, with the hard water leading the charge all the way. There's almost no flavor here, much less that of the "beer" flavor our grandparents always go on about. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a thoroughly watery feel. Overall, this doesn't seem all that much like non-alcoholic beer to me as much as it does beer-flavored water. If you wanted a Beck's without the alcohol, you'd be sorely disappointed here.","TMoney2591","Jun 15, 2013"

2.79,17.7,4,1.75,3,3.25,3,"Golden with a finger plus of whites that only slowly falls to a solid sheet of the same. Really the best looking N.A. beer I've seen. Smells like many of the others: corn, grain, sweet white bread, but this one has an odd squash (butternut or pumpkin) character. Taste is corny with some sugar and a slight grain cleanliness. Medium on light with moderate carb and a fairly dry finish. Not bad, don't care for the nose here.","harrymel","Nov 12, 2012"

This one looked alright, just like any macro would. The moment it moved from sight to smell and taste - it was a big let down. Very metallic, stale and lifeless. It was syrupy and unpalatable. Fizz, reminded me of stale and bitter ginger ale. I should've stuck to a Diet Coke or water.","BeerSingh","Sep 04, 2009"

1.71,-27.8,3,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Bottle: Poured a light copper color lager with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light skunk with some light medium sweet malt notes. Taste is also a mix between some light medium sweet notes with some distinctive adjunct and some light skunk notes (damn green bottles). I can't say that this is really a lot worse then a regular Becks but then the regular beer is not very flavourful to start with.","Phyl21ca","Mar 14, 2007"
1.57,-33.8,1.5,2,1.5,2,1,"Light golden pour with a surprisingly long lasting white head. Smell is similar to most other NA beers I've tried. Malty, gummy and a little odd, but not the worst one I've smelled. Taste is pretty sweet and malty. Corn syrup like sweetness and just cloying. This is like beer flavored soda. Undrinkable but not the worst NA beer.","JDV","Jan 29, 2007"
3.16,33.3,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured a tall, dense, bright-white head that left a beautiful coat of lace. Glowing pale golden beer holds a swarm of fast rising bubbles. Strong herbal hop notes are a bit pungent, and ride above a faint pale malt sweetness that is ever so slightly artificial. Faint flavors of spring flowers and tea ride a solid backbone of artificial sweetener and an acidic twang. Light crisp mouthfeel is dominated by the acidic taste. This beer has none of the typical NA off-flavors in the nose, and those in the flavor are less dominant then average. I don't mind the acidic flavor, but if there is one major flaw that is it. I'm on the fence with this one.","HappyHourHero","Jan 09, 2007"

1.86,-21.5,4.5,3.5,1,1.5,1,"Pours crystal clear straw with a soapy two finger head. Surprisingly good retention, active streaming carbonation, and rings of lace. Skunk aroma, with the possibility of pilsener malt. Sickeningly sweet taste, like splenda, and skunked noble hop aftertaste. High carbonation and light body fight a losing battle to slickness, and the finish is challenging. I like to be surprised by a good NA beer, but this one is dissapointing.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 17, 2004"
1.67,-29.5,3.5,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"I haven't yet put in the numbers, but it's obvious that Beck's Alkoholfrei/Non-Alcoholic is the better of these two products and is, therefore, the winner of the first NA Shootout (With Blanks). It isn't the best one of these low alchohol beers that I've ever had, but is drinkable in a pinch. Let's hope that I never find myself in that big of a pinch.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 02, 2004"

It pours quite a pale golden tone with a scarce head. The smell, faint and with no inviting elements, has some hops but almost no other feel. The taste, i can literally describe as biting into grass and chewing, a weak presence of malt and excess water topped by an awful excess of hops (bitterness) unappropriate for the beer's style. Oh, this is a beer gone bad.","Andreji","0"
