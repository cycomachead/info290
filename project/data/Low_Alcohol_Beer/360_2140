The maltiness is just so superior to many of the pale lagers out there - noticeable, enjoyable, and well, not boozy. So why can't a whole lot of the normals get that part right? No offense to Warsteiner - they've no doubt got their shit together, like many of their German kin.","biboergosum","Feb 02, 2013"

2.18,-9.9,2,1.5,2.5,3,2,"Pretty stinky stuff. The skunk and musty hops makes one nausious when blended with the sweet, cake batter, bready notes. Sugary toasted bread with skunk sprayed on it. Clear with hint of yellow, faint soapy head that fades fast and leaves spotty lace. Skunk ruins what could be some nice sweet bready flavors. Drain pour.","JayS2629","Mar 02, 2010"

2.39,-1.2,3.5,2,2.5,4,1.5,"The bottle caught my attention. This one for me was a drain pour. It pours to a greenish yellow color, kind of like flat ginger ale. Head was gone almost as soon as I stopped pouring. My best description for the smell, and sorry if it seems like I am ripping on the beer, but it smelled like leaves that had been in the gutter after a couple of rains, with a touch of sugar added. Medium bodied mouthfeel, not very carbonated which isn't too bad. Taste was kind of like it smelled to me, not a great aftertaste. Finish was smooth, it was more of getting by the taste, maybe it was just old.","whtguitarguy","Nov 28, 2008"
2.96,22.3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"For an NA beer, this one isn't bad at all. I poured it from a 50 cl can (with the Warsteiner logo in bright blue) into a footed pilsener glass. Very yellow and pale, completely clear, with a watery appearance. The head, though, is amazing....tall, thick, stable, and incredible lace. The aroma is a little odd...lots of very pale malt aroma...it's like smelling a can of pilsener malt exract. Small touch of sulfur as well. The taste is a little sweet, fairly malty, and a touch grainy. Sweeter than most NA's, and not quite crisp. Different than others that I've had. Of course, the brew is watery and a little skinny...probably more substantial than others of the style. Really, however, this one was much better than I had expected.","Suds","Aug 31, 2008"
3.48,43.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"The pour was decent, light color with lots of carbonation and a tow inch fizzy white head. Decent retention as well. The aroma was lots of grainy malts, light bready character with a hint of earthy hops. The flavor followed along nicely, smooth, crisp, clean. Not much depth here, but the style really does not require it. Easily drinkable and really not that bad at all. For my first low ABV beer, I was not totally turned off by it.","mikesgroove","Jun 22, 2008"
1.81,-25.2,3,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"It is strange to finish a beer and feel not the slightest effect, but that doesn't mean I want to drink more of these. Even in a driving situation I would greatly prefer an O'Doul's Amber.","semihobo","Jun 01, 2008"

2.81,16.1,3.5,2.5,3,2,3,"It is what it is - a very good beer for the style. Lots of hop character despite the low alcohol, but the lack of character and body is distracting. Honestly, this or O'Douls? No brainer.","nomad","Jul 16, 2005"
2.22,-8.3,2,2.5,2,3,2,"I didnÂ’t care for this one very much. It is not very drinkable. I would make the assumption that if you like Euro-Lagers but you need a beer with minimal alcohol, you might like this one. I purchased one 12-ounce bottle in Omaha.","bditty187","Sep 15, 2004"
1.88,-22.3,3,2.5,1.5,2,1.5,"Warsteiner Premium Fresh (I find it interesting that both beers use the word 'premium') is an unpalatable, nearly undrinkable, beverage. It loses this head-to-head competition, but then the winner is almost as bad. My first exposure to low alcohol beer has been a pleasant surprise in terms of appearance and aroma, and has been a serious disappointment in the all-important flavor category. I wonder what truly talented brewers could do with this style if they really put their minds to it.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 27, 2004"

1.36,-43.8,1,2.5,1,1,1,"Pours out very thin and watery, pale yellowish, the colour of canola oil. Managed to get a small head on the pour though, and it settled fast to a ring for the rest of the way down. Decent nose on this, to my utter surprise, sweet grainy malt and corn, it actually reminds me of an Alexander Keiths. But after one sip you know you've left flavour country for good, you're drifting on an ice floe in the opposite direction. There's a thin hint of graininess, but it's pretty damned apparent that you're a half step up from water, which is the consistency of the mouthfeel as well. I can barely drink this stuff, not because of a bad taste, but because of the utter lack of taste at all. Two words: plant food. There's nothing here to see folks, move along...","IronDjinn","Apr 02, 2003"
1.48,-38.8,2,1.5,1.5,1,1.5,"Pours a terrible golden colour topped by a very thin head that dissapears from hte first sip and leaves absolutely no lace on the glass. The aroma was horrible, as someone would expect from a non-alcoholic beer. Taste was quite bitter. Not a ""Premium"" beer as the label says. Definitely had better non-alcoholic beers...","ipogios","Mar 30, 2003"
2.71,12,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"The smell is a strange sweetish, grainy, bready smell. Not altogether unpleasant. The front shows some grain and malt. The middle is strangely sourbitter. The finish is metallic, becoming more corny at higher temps. There's a kind of cornsyrupy flavor in the aftertaste, but not sweet and cloying like many NAs. I'd say this is one of the better yellow NAs.","kbub6f","Oct 03, 2002"
2.5,3.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Light golden in color with mild carbonation and a small white head, fair lace. The aroma is typical for a NA beer, mostly unfermented wort, reminiscent of caramel with a faint ghost of hops. Taste begins with bready, tart malt and zesty carbonation; finishes dry with slight hops. All in all, unremarkable. Considering the quality of Warsteiner beers, I expected this to be better.","Pegasus","Aug 11, 2002"
2.54,5,2,3,2.5,2,2.5,"This was billed as ""non-alcoholic"" on the label of the bottle I drank. I was shocked that this actually had a decent flavor. As a matter of fact, it tasted better than any ""light"" beer I have ever tried. Unfortunately, for me, drinking a non-alcoholic beer is like drinking decaffeinated coffee. What's the point?","Dogbrick","Beers"
