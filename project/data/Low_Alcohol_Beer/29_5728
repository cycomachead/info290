3,37,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours to a generous white head and light amber color.  Aroma is weak caramel malt and a hint of hops. Flavor is a watered down but not unpleasant sweet malt and touch of hops and a nice seltzer finish. These NAs are not going to taste like real beer because alcohol is the glue that holds all the flavors together. But this is pretty damn close.","EagleTalon","Feb 27, 2015"

Clausthaler is too bitter and metallic, Kaliber is way to sweet and funky, Coors NA tastes just like Coors, and this tastes like a soft nut brown ale with cream soda.  It's not too sweet, but sweeter than normal beer with enough malt to remind you this isn't soda.","Every1sgrudge","Jan 13, 2015"

I know, I'm kinda surprised, too. The taste is grainier, like less polished bread, with a touch of vague fruitiness tossed in for apparently good measure. Then everything is watered down. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I'm not sure why they bothered to take out the alcohol here, except to save the company from being derided for releasing a really crappy beer that may actually be able to eventually get you drunk.

4.54,107.3,4,5,4.5,5,4,"Wow, the Crack was literally explosive on this gem! Man, I had liquid foaming everywhere and fortunately a decanting glass was ready-to-hand. The overly-fast Glug produced a finger-and-a-half of tawny head with not only decent retention, but the lacing was both quick to appear and very pretty. The color was a coppery, reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a unique quality, like roasting peanuts or chestnuts. It had a roasted malt quality not generally found in an Amber, but usually in a darker beer. Mouthfeel was actually ending to full and the taste was very malty, which is not my bag, but on the other hand, it was more tasty than other LABs in my memory. Finish was biscuity and frankly reminiscent of Fat Tire. I know that I will be dunned for saying so, but this was a fairly worthwhile beer for the style. I would definitely use some cooler space for my N.A./LAB friends and maybe even for me to take the edge off.","woodychandler","Oct 16, 2011"

I am not a fan of NA beers but if I had to choose this is the one that best emulates a regular beer so I consider it pretty good based on the style.

Thin fizzy head that fades quickly leaving a tiny ring and no lace. Nose of malt, diacetyl, and buttery toast. Taste is all malty with little else other than perhaps tap water. Slightly bitter finish. Mouth is thin and watery with no carbonation evident. Overall: While it looks OK initially, this beer devolves into what amounts to a glass of brownish malt-flavored water.

The taste was very light and non descript, but that is about what one would expect from a light lager.

Like bad mineral water...no traces of the label-touted "Two-row and specialty caramel malts" or hops of any sort. Body is not as thin as one might think for a 0.5% ABV, and has some decent creaminess to the carbonation, but the off-flavors and sour crispness are equal parts distracting and disgusting.

Anway, this one looked pretty good with a fairly dark golden brown color, a big frothy white head and even a bit of lacing on my mug. The aroma was OK too, a bit of brown sugar and wheat, clean. But the taste was far below some of the imported ones I have generally liked, like Haake Beck, St. Pauli's and Clausthaler. The immediate impression is with how thin and weak flavored this feels and tastes. It is well carbonated, very sprite and as a result can be called a refreshing drink perhaps, but the flavor implied by the aroma is quickly lost in a peppery and watery drink that has a metallic overtone It's very thin and just a hint of some wheat here. I thought the Amber might hold some promise but don't bother with this when there are much better choices for the no/low alcohol options.
