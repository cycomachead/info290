1.5,-46.8,,,,,,"Poured a clear golden body with two fingers of fluffy white head. The best part of the beer. Scents of skunk, apple juice and a bit of spicy Noble hops, honey and Pilsner malt. Overall impression is of a typical Euro Pale Lager aroma that is a bit lacking in complexity and brought down a touch by the skunk. Pleasant, but simple. Flavor begins with flavors of grainy malt, sweet Pilsner malt and honey. This moves into a skunky flavor of grain, grain husk, a bit of bitter, hop extract flavors, a chemical off-flavor, and a touch of honey. Finish is medium-dry with notes of grain, a chemical off-flavor, grainy husk and hop extract with medium bitterness. Aftertaste is grain, hop extract and a touch of honey. Overall impression is of a very grainy lager with a touch of hops and an off flavor that drags the entire thing down. It is not pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall impression is of a nice lager, the best part of the beer. Overall it is a pretty bad lager. The aroma is okay, but the flavor is terrible and the mouthfeel is standard. Not worth having, honestly if you want a low ABV beer drink a Lindeman's.","Auraan","Sep 13, 2014"

It smells like sweet malt and dough/bread. No hops that I can notice. The aroma is sweet, and non-offensive. No "off" or skunky aromas. The taste is the same as the aroma, bready and sweet. A little bit too sweet for my taste. With that being said, it doesn't taste bad, I've certainly drank worse beers (yeah, I know this is non-alcoholic). Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin but crisp. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. If I was somewhere that only had NA beers, I'd drink it again. For the style I think it's decent.","bluejacket74","Jun 14, 2008"

The color is a fine, high gold, with a reasonably good head and lace. The aroma contains a trace of green-glass Euroskunk, with some graininess and a pleasant bread-yeast. The caramel sweetness is unhampered by alcohol, so the cake and bread crust flavors are more noticeable than a traditional beer. Hops are tart and quite forceful. There is something off, though, an unpleasant chemical flavor. Like something plastic sat in the beer for a spell. It's a fake taste, which fits 'cause you could say this is a fake beer. Cookie and shortbread flavors struggle to the top and the beer ends up being sweeter than it should be. It's not awful; in fact, if this was the only option it wouldn't be the end of the world.
