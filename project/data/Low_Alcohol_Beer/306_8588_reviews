"People that hate Coors and Coors varieties will also hate this because it tastes, smells, feels, looks, and drinks exactly the same as Coors Light but with slightly more malt flavor.  It has that typical macro brew corn taste people come to expect from an American macro brew so in a way it's refreshing as it doesn't stray too far from the norm.  Looks like a normal beer, doesn't really smell like anything much except a macro beer faintly, tastes just like Coors Light, feels like water with little carbonation, but has standard head retention and lacing.  Personally, given the fact it even tastes like Coors Light is a plus for me, because the other two NA beers I've tried tasted like they came straight from a science lab."
"With a buddy who drinks na.  Good for him bad for me :)"

"Pours out to a decent half-inch head that surprisingly lasts and laces some. Color is a gold-straw color and brilliant clarity. Aroma is whole leaf noble hops and weak grains. Flavor produces some malt character and hop flavors. Dry, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is the best in the category. Overall the best nonalcoholic brew I've tasted. I would drink this stuff all day long. Seriously."

"Overall: Truly awful stuff. I wouldn't recommend this one under any circumstances"

"One of the better NAs. It actually smelled like a decent German Pilsner, but of course the taste was a huge disappointment."
""
"Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet corn, light powdered sugar, light wheat, and light sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mineral water. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, not much going on here, really. It's a basic NA beer, one that doesn't come across offensive in any way."

"Overall I enjoy it (as much as I can, which isn't really at all) as a beer substitute."

"O: A little less flavorful than the original but not by much, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, considering how close in taste (or lack thereof) this beer is to the original version, it’s not too bad, but overall it’s not very good either."

"I would suggest trying this first if you must drink a low-alcohol beer."
"O: I guess this is unoffensive and easy to drink, but I don't necessarily understand why you would waste the calories on something that basically tastes like flavored water."
"Drinkability: This beer wasn't good at all- the first low alcohol beer I've had and it's an experience I won't be rushing to have again anytime soon."
"Upon being cracked open, the beer poured without incident, creating a finger of rocky, bone-white head with low retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. A previous reviewer mentioned a sweet smell like creamed corn and I will see your creamed corn and raise you silage! It smelled like fermented corn cobs stored in a silo for later feed for farm animals. How in the flying monkey do you create something like this?!? Ooof. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with a barely detectable sweetness on the tongue. It was like drinking fizzy sugar water. The finish left me with nothing. I glanced at the glass to ensure that I actually had taken a drink. This was just a whole buncha nuthin! No way is this going into any cooler that I own. Next!"
"This is blasphemy to all things brewed. I got a few swigs in and had to pour it. Horrible by any standards."
"D- Overall, compared to other low alcohol beers, I would put this one near the bottom. Wouldn't recommend it."
"Again, the only reason I drink this is because there is no real beer allowed on deployment to Iraq. While I rate this beer higher than Becks NA, I still would drink the Becks over this any day. The beer is lager-ish in color, malty aroma as well as it posesses a maltier profile than other NA beers. No real hop flavor or aroma to speak of. Gagging sweeness of unfermented wort. This makes a horrible soda, but I suppose if one wanted the illusion of drinking without the intended benefits (ie: intoxication), this ""beer"" would do the job."
"Plain looking yellow lager..small white head. Doughy slight aromas..kinda neutral really. Taste is also sort of neutral..some doughiness, slight hint of what could be a hop!! Highly carbonated, dry finish on the palate. Overall not great even or a non-alcoholic brew. ODouls is much better."
"If you put this beer in a blind taste test I would be very surprised if someone were pick it out from other American Beers. It has a nice head when poured out of the 12 ounce bottle has a nice mouth feel and taste just like a normal beer. I recommend it if you feel like drinking but don't want to chance driving or getting a hangover"
"This is actually tolerable for a low alcohol beer. It's not the greatest but it doesn't have any awful flavors or aftertaste."
"Notes from: 12/12/06"
"D: Not sure I'd want to drink a lot, but probably couild."
"Drinkability - it wasn't that bad, but not close to being a regular purchase...honestly, even the teens chose to play with sour pickle juice instead of this NA beer"
"Hmm... looks halfway decent. smells like gooey band aid. tastes like kaliber, the only other NA beer i've had. I guess you could get used to the flavor if you really want to pretend to drink beer. Pretty unappealing from the standpoint of somebody that wants a normal tasting beer though."
"Overall, this is your average macro NA."
"D= if you're into NA beer for a while, it's worth the try, given the price, and you could probably drink all night with this stuff, although do remember that it is not ""alcohol-free," it still has about 1/2% ABV."
"Pours with a medium sized head, lacing is quite exceptional for an NA...very pale gold colour...smell is of corn....odd taste, but what throws me is that it is quite watery, even for a reduced alcohol brew...very bland...quite a disappointing beer. Its just not worth the time or effort to buy or even open the bottle."
"Coors NA pours a crsytal-clear, deep-gold body beneath a short head of creamy white foam that holds fairly well and leaves some spotty rings of lace about the glass. It smells like a standard American lager with a bit of sweetish cereal-like malt and some mild hops. In the mouth it's crisp and medium-light bodied. The flavor is slightly malty sweet and cerealish at first, but it quickly shifts as the hops step in and the flavor becomes more floral and spicy. In fact, it's so well done that I'd imagine that if you had more than one of these you might forget it was low alcohol. A low-key bitterness balances it, and it finishes fairly short and dry, although some sticky, cereal-like malt does linger. Regardless, it's one of the better NA's out there!"
"Bud Ice Light beats out Coors NA in this round, but must take on Olde English Malt Liquor to win the crown for the High-Low Invitation. Coming up next:"
"This is my first post here. Anyway, I just bought a 6 pack to taste since it's always fascinated me. Now that I bought it, I wouldn't recommend it. To me, it's like drinking cereal. It's the same colour as other beers, but lacking in everything else."
"An average NA beer. No more, no less."
"Poured a golden yellow color with nice white puffy head. Left nice lacing on the side of the glass as it fell. Smell is of a moderate sweetish mote that is not overly pleasant. Taste is malty, can't detect any hops. Finishes somewhat refreshing, but leaves a strange taste at the finish. OK, but not great."
"Beer without alcohol, amused without the heavy thing of the alcohol, similar to tourtel French, fragant scent to hops boiled and crushed, flavor to malt, clean, very soft; luminous yellow color, try with american and mexican food; serve in a pint glass, low fermentation; 80% recommended."
"Single 12 oz for $1.29 at Total Wine in Midlothian."
"Overall, for a non-alcoholic macro, this was not terrible in my eyes and was actually fuller tasting than most macro swills."
"From a can, this beverage pours a deep golden color. The head is a soap-bubble solution of thin consistency and zero life. Large bubbles of CO2 constantly float to the top of the beer. Almost no aroma at all, maybe a hint of grain. Ditto for the taste: carbonic water with a bit of grain and no hop flavor. Even when compared to other NA beers, this one is not worth the bother."
"Overall, not that bad. I wouldn't buy this stuff myself, but if you need an n/a 'beer', this is OK. Personally, I'd say just skip it all together and have a nice juice or sparkling water with lime."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 28JUN03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck-style bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"For N/A beer this is not bad. The taste is still weak and flat, but quit smooth and sweet. Pretty decent malt flavor. overall I don't consider this reak beer, in fact, you won't find the word beer on the can. You kind of drink it talking to the glass saying ""well taste, anytime your ready""..."
