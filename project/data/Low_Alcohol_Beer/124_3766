3,-5.1,5,2.5,3,3,3,"O: Overall, refreshing but a disappointment for an alcohol free beer. The typical hefe-weise flavours are not standing out as much as I would have hoped. The Krombacher version of this takes the cake by far.","patre_tim","Jan 23, 2012"

2.43,-23.1,4,3.5,1.5,1.5,3,"Notes: For a moment there this seems like a ""real beer," right up to the moment before it hits your tongue. Then everything fades back into reality. This might be a good beer substitute for someone on the wagon, but comes very short of being a good weiss. If I ever gave up alcohol, I don't think I'd go to NA beers, but get into something else instead. They just don't quite live up. That being said, I think this drink is probably near the top (if not at the top) of the NA list. Before drinking, it gives a good impression of being a real beer, which is really the point, isn't it?","BucBasil","Jan 03, 2005"
3.57,13,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"It looks pretty good. Tall cream colored head fades a little faster then I'd like, but not bad. Murky golden beer is duller then normal (I'm not sure that means anything, but it has a strange color to it). Smells good. Faint banana with hints of bubble gum and wheat. Mouthfeel is subpar for a Hefe-Weizen, but not totally lacking like most NA's. It's moderately light and fluffy, but it there is a strange faint lactic twang. The taste is almost absent. You get more flavor from breathing in just before you sip then you do from the actually liquid. There is an acidic flavor/feeling that dominates the flavor. There might be a hint of wheat underneath and a dash of lemon, but the yeasty/banana flavor is missing. There are no off-flavors or aromas, which is nice. With a touch of flavor this beer could be at the top of the NA list.","HappyHourHero","Beers"
1.89,-40.2,3.5,2,1.5,1,2.5,"I had this beer at a wedding, serving as Designated Driver. It was labeled ""Thomas-Brau"". Pours with a clear, golden color and a puffy, good-looking head. Aroma is of cooked vegtables and wet, uninspiring grain. Taste is hollow and empty, no real character at all. No mouthfeel whatsoeverÂ…slightly more appealing than soda water. ON the upside, it's better than O'Dools and other NA's. There is a beer flavor, and it's crisp and thirst-quenching. One of the best non-alcohol beers I've had.","Suds","0"
