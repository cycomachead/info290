"O: Tastes just like I remember shandy tasting when I first sampled it in the UK in the early 2000s and it is not really distinguishable from the versions that contain alcohol. Refreshing on a hot afternoon and easy to drink but not something I would rush out to grab again. The amount of sediment in suspension is really unattractive in this brew - makes me wonder how long this was sitting on the shelf."

"Lemon tonic water aroma, slight sweetness of lemonade. Authentic lemon juice citrus flavor, mildly sweet, with a pale malt aftertaste, and lingering lemon peel bitterness. Somewhat prickly carbonation without feeling gassy or fizzy. Overall very traditional without any artificial impression. Probably would work well as a mixer..."
"As an alternative to lemon soda it's quite ok. Not as a beer, or a shandy."
"This is pretty bad even for soda standards."
"The beer pours an orangish-amber color with a white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is ginger and lemons, smelling about like Lipton Lemon tea smells. The flavor is heavy on the lemon with some ginger notes. As expected, there is no alcohol or hop presence. Thin mouthfeel and high carbonation. This is not real similar to a beer, but it is easy drinking and would be nice on a hot day. For a thirst quencher, this would be a good choice."
