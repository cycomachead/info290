I could imagine drinking this on a hot summer day instead of a regular witbier as this is in fact better than some of its alcoholic witbier cousins. Coriander, curacao and yeast all typical ingredients of a witbier are not mentioned on the label and maybe not present. This is a bit suspicious, but I do not care as this is an almost perfect alcohol free emulation of a witbier.","safaricook","Nov 11, 2013"

3.22,-9.6,3.25,3.75,3,2.75,3.25,"Hmmm - unusual. It looks almost like the real deal, and the aroma is a decent mimic as well. However the flavour leaves something to be desired; it's too sweet and has bizarre artificial hints that spoil it. The body could also use work - where's the carbonation? That said, I suppose this is a fair stab at an alcohol-free brew. It's better than many low-alcohol lagers and does a reasonable job of imitating a wit. I'm still not sure I'd choose this if the situation demanded it; there are other alcohol-free drinks out there. Worth trying if you need to avoid booze.","jazzyjeff13","Mar 28, 2012"

3.17,-11,3.5,4,2.5,3,3.5,"O: Served ice cold (to scare most of that dishwater away) this is still a pretty special summer drink, and even though it doesn't taste much like beer to me, this is one of the most interesting non-alcoholic ones I've had.","stjaernstoft","Beers"
