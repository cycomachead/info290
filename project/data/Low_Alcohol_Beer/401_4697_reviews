"Bottle: Poured a super pale yellow lager. Aroma is bland with light sweet notes. Taste is also dominated by light sweet notes with bland aftertaste. Might as well drink water of you are going to be drinking this."
"I don't even know why I bother rating these crap beers.... The wonderfull clear yellow reserved for microfiltration...the nose and taste of sweet corn syrup with no flavor depth...like having sex in a canoe...."

"Sourcing: Purchased at Spec's in Texas in May of 2013. The price was $1.99 plus tax for a 16.9 ounce (500 ml) bottle."

"O: This beer doesn't taste that bad (especially when compared to other beers in the style), then again it doesn't taste that good."

"Dr: May please the teatotaller demographic, but I doubt they're on this site. Not a terrible beer, nor should it be disparaged merely for having low ABV, but certainly not a worthy beer."
"As far as non-alcohols go, Baltika's is a pleasant surprise."
"I am initially made dubious by its green glass container. What will it yield upon opening? I love the pop-top caps they use and it actually made a nice POP sound, followed by a release of either Saaz hops or skunk, in terms of smell. Once in the glass, I would say that it is heavy on Saaz as the smell is not outright skunked. I got a finger of rocky bone-white head with low retention. Color was a pale golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity (I could see into the neighbor's kitchen), along with lots of CO2 bubbles. Mouthfeel was medium with a light taste of malt and Saaz hops, like a dumbed-down Czech Pils. Finish had a slight cardboard flavor, but not so overpowering that it rated complete dunning. Frankly, in total, it was light, airy, slightly flavorful, but not worth seeking out. I still think that Busch N-A in CANs has been the best of the lot."
"Overall: Flavor is not half bad and the aroma is decent but everything else kills this beer. Not worth it."
"Taste is like a lemon-lime soda or perhaps diet ginger ale with malt extract added. Sickly sweet, unbearably so. Light graininess is really the only thing here that remotely resembles a beer. Even though at least half this bottle was a drain pour, I am not unhappy I bought it. Almost worth it just to see what happens to a 'beer' without fermenting grains present. For me, non-alcoholic beer is like kissing your sister - whats the point?"
"Very light colour with some sizzling head than reeks of cheesy hay. No taste. Yes its thin. Basically my main beef with this beer is it is undrinkable, similar to a bad flat seltzer. Best I can say is that the minimum alcohol allows one to have a proper beer afterward."
"Hey, it's non-alcoholic. What do you expect? There is nothing utterly objectionable about this brew. It's just not good. It pours pale yellow (tempted to say ""off clear"") with a big head that stuck around much longer than I expected, leaving a trace of lace. The smell is rice mash, just like Bud (the stuff with alcohol). Taste is elusive, but generally rice (label says there isn't any) or watered down malt. There is no discernible hop presence, and the mouthfeel is definitely watery. I've had better non-alcoholics - but I've also had worse beers with the good stuff left in."
