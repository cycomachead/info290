Highly carbonated, this is quenching and refreshing. Fairly clean, there's nothing discernibly off here. This is not bad at all, and I would go as far as recommend it. It's significantly better than Heineken, and most macro lagers. In terms of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, I would say this is second to maybe good tonic water, as the lack of sweetness and the added bitterness really do help.

The flavors were clean and crisp, though obviously stripped of the alcoholic gumption one hopes from a drink. Still, for a NA beer it was dry and smooth with only a hint of sweetness and cereal grains. The mouthfeel was fair enough, the body light/medium and the carbonation good. Would I order another one?
