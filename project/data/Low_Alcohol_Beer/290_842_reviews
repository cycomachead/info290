"I was surprised that I actually kind of liked the taste of this non-alcoholic green bottled beer. Crazy, Imagine that."

"For my first NA beer, this isn't that bad. If I had to drink more of this for whatever reason, I wouldn't be disappointed; it's actually pretty enjoyable to sip this and not worry about having to drive after I finish my glass."
"If this is the best NA beer out there then I will have to pick up some bad examples."
"Drink- For a NA this was actually pretty good. Unique to me how they can do this. Recommended to those who want ""some"" beer taste w/o a big ABV hit."
"Overall this is quite enjoyable for what it is."
"Pours a solid golden color with a decent sized white head that displays moderate retention and minimal lace. Smells of skunk, corn, light bits of caramel, slightly bready malty aroma. If it weren't for the skunk this wouldn't smell half bad. Taste is bready and caramel malty with a hint of earth. Again not half bad. Thin body, spirited level of carbonation, bubbly foamy mouthfeel. Lacks any kind of body, tastes okay, if it weren't for the style tick I would have never bought this. Not too bad for an alcohol free I guess."
"Overall / Drinkability : This is the first time I've ever had a low alcohol beer and I can say that it has a lot more flavor than I expected. Went well with food (pasta with basil + tomato sauce) but I can't see drinking it by itself. With food, pretty good. Without food, interesting, but the smell puts me off a bit. Glad that I could pick up a single and not a whole pack of thet stuff."
"Pours a light honey orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Random tiny spots and splotches of lacing dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grain and slight honey and citrus notes. Taste is of sweet grain, corn flakes, honey, and a citrus zest bitterness. The bitterness is pretty mild on the palate after each sip. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good low alcohol beer and the first I have actually ever had. To me this tastes pretty real and I would definitely get this again if I ever needed such a beer."
"Pours a clear copper color with a single-finger off-white head that recedes somewhat quickly into a thin cap. Some slight spotty lacing. The nose brings forward a good amount of caramel; it smells like like caramel malt after being milled. Not so bad at all. A bit of graininess there as well. The flavor is much the same -- tastes just like caramel malt, though there isn't much sweetness there. Just a touch actually. Medium body and good carbonation. Actually not a half-bad brew. Good job."
"Golden Amber as the name indicates. Small head that quickly diminished and clung only slightly. Smells somewhat light struck because of the green bottle (I've had fresher in the past). Thankfully no skunk taste. Taste is malty without being sweet. Finishes very crisp with no linger. There is a non-sweet honey taste in there that reminds me of wet sweet grass. IMO, NA beers, in a way, are like a batch of chocolate cookies in which one forgot to add one of the ingredients. Every bite, or in this case, sip, reminds me that Clausthaler is solid but lacks whatever flavor the alcohol would have imparted. I'd recommend this medium bodied brew to anybody who needs/wants to avoid the effects of alcohol."
"The pour netted me about a finger-and-a-half of rocky, tawny head with limited retention. Color was a deep golden-amber (talk about truth in advertising!) with NE-plus quality clarity (I could see into the future) and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose smelled strongly of Saaz hops underlain by a faint maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a slight astringency in the mouth, much drier than its Classic counterpart. Finish was mildly hoppy, slightly malty, nicely balanced. Once more, I felt that this was an N.A. beer that could easily have fooled me in a blind tasting. It has a well-deserved reputation as one of the better beers in its style. I would recommend this beer to anyone interested in this style."
"The beer pours golden amber, imagine that. The color is reminiscent of molasses. Very clear, not many bubbles. There's a surprising amount of lacing given the nonexistent head. A sweet, stale vegetable smell with notes of black tea and honey. This 'beer' gives an overall impression of lemony iced tea. There's some tart citrus and a raw malt flavor with notes of cornbread, sugar, and tea leaves. The lively, tingly mouthfeel doesn't really work with the flavor profile here. It feels more like they were aiming for an adjunct lager or pilsner. Overall it's drinkable and somewhat refreshing, though a little messy, I think."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze, although I'm not sure if I would have it again because of the unusual tea flavor."
"D-I finally found this one near me and I have to agree with its place atop the leaderboard here. I guarantee you could pour this for a lot of people and tell them it was a real beer and only true afficianodos would be able to tell the difference. A nice substitute when you don't want the alcohol. Not as good as most regular beers but better than some of the shit ones."
"D: This one of the better low alcohol beers out there. It's the finish that cuts this beer's score. The odd flavor in the end really detracted from the overall experience."
"Beer is heavier than the other one but lighter in flavor with a big aftertaste. The sweetness creeps up on you. There is a grainy aftertaste and almost no midpalate character. I think the Premium is better. This one is harder to drink (for me) and its got more sweetness, which is what I don't like about these beers, they are all too sweet."
"This has been my review!!!"
"Drinkability: This one almost tastes like a non sweetened iced tea. I get some beer, but not enough to make me want this again. Nice and dry for a beer in this style."
"D- Overall, not bad for a non-alcoholic beer. I would rather just drink a beer 99/100 times but I suppose this beer has it's time and place."
"D - Drinkability is not bad. It's much better than expected actually. The flavor is reminiscent of other European lagers I've had in the distant past. Would I have this again? Not if I can help it. Is it a good non-alcoholic alternative to beer? I would have to say yes. Yes it is."
"The best NA beer I have tasted so far."
"Maybe the best Low/Non Alcohol beer I have had, and still not very good, its a shame than there doesn't seem to be a good alcohol free beer alternative out there."
"Overall: Doesn't compare to alcoholic amber ales, but that isn't what it is trying to do is it? I am impressed."
"Surprisingly, I was quite impressed with this non-alcoholic offering. If I did not know any better, I would have guessed this to be a decent ""regular"" Euro lager. Definitely worth a shot if you want a beer but have to avoid alcohol."
"A pleasant surprise if you're into this sort of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Drinks pretty decent I must say. I'd much rather Respect Beer."
"Overall: I can appreciate a good N.A. but for me this one didn't do it. That weird metal taste stuck to me even though it did disappear midway through it still left it's trace on me. It upset my stomach a little and i wouldn't try it again."
"Taste follows the nose but in a less drastic way. Slightly chewy in a sense on the flavor though more so at the top of the mouth versus the back of the tongue. And yet a bit shallow, not a lot of depth here, yet not much expected. Decent feel with an almost cream soda-like finish, albeit without the fizzy carbonation. Fairly drinkable and tastes sweeter than the 75 calories it is."
"D - You know - this is a pretty solid beverage. I might be more inclined to have one of these instead of a soda. If I was the DD I wouldn't be totally embarrassed to drink this at a party. The carbonation gets a little bloaty but otherwise it's pretty easy to drink."
"Review to style this is quite good. A solid 4.0. light golden/amber with a small whispy offwhite head that dies but leaves a decent lace. Aromas of light malts, and faint, faint hops. Taste is grassy and slightly malty. Mouthfeel is spritzy, dry, and light. Drinkability is good. This is a refreshing alternative for your DD."
"Drinkability: for an NA beer, this may be as good as it gets for appearance, flavor, and aroma. Easy to quaff and the price is reasonable."
"If you enjoy a low-alcohol beer now and then, you simply must give this one a go! A package of glasses arrived today that I won on ebay. What to do? I cain't drank tonite! Along comes Clausthaler Golden Amber Non-alcoholic to save the night!"
"Nice biting crispness, very tasty beverage, and not just because its a N/A ... I fooled a couple of people with this, but it sucks once it warms up..."
"I don't really see much point in non-alcoholic beer, but this one has intrigued me for quite a long time, and today, I was given the chance to purchase a single of it. It poured a crystal clear copper colour with a white head that faded away almost instantly. The smell was quite sweet and reminded me of some German doppelbocks. Loads of sweet malts and that maple pancake syrup smell that Celebrator has. I certaily wasn't expecting that. Taste, too, was nearly entirely malt. Sweet malt. Mouthfeel was, of course, quite thin, but there was a decent level of CO2 present here, and considering what this is, I'm going to be rather lenient. Again, considering what this is, I found it highly drinkable. Would I rather have a St. Bernardus Abt.12? Of course I would, but if I had to choose a non-alcoholic beer for some un-godly reason, I'd choose this hands down over all that American garbage such as O'Douls and Miller Sharp and so forth."
"I'm impressed. Best N/A I've had so far. This is the first one that I'd go out of my way to pour in a glass."
"Impossible to find in PA. Asked local beer store to order and they were unable to find. Finallly located it in Delaware. Poured a nice golden color with nice head. Smell is not overally attractive but better than most NA beers. Taste is good for an NA beer, but the unfermented malt taste is still there. OK for an NA beer."
"This isn't a very dark amber lager; it looks like a Czech pilsner actually. It's the color of apple juice with a big, firm head (I've noticed all NA beers have lots of head). Lots of bubbles on the side of the glass which is distracting. Aroma pretty bland, flavor has some caramel/bread sweetness and a mellow but effective hop quality indicative of a herbal/mineral pilsner. It's tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but the beer quenches thirst very well and this is a worthwhile beer to examine if you're eliminating alcohol."
"Starts out kinda tasty as fizzy malt teas go. Pours amber under a thick head that looks slightly processed. A nice malty taste and, for once, a pleasing snootful of German hops. Then a strange barrage of off flavors and sugars sets in. It's nice that there's an NA beer that tries to make up for its weak malt profile by adding some hops, but this still needs some work."
"12 ounce bottle."
"One of the few Non-Alcohol brews I actually like."
"Overall a well-done N/A that I would drink again if a situation would call for it."
"Awesome NA. I'd actually drink this without so much as a complaint. In fact, I can think of plenty ""real beers"" that I'd chose this over."
"Pours out to a light, amber in the glass with a fairly, large head. There is alot of carboination present. Many bubbles in this one. The taste is a very, pleasant surprise. The caramel malt taste with a slight sweetness, really adds to the drinkability factory and it doesn't leave a dry mouth like most N/A's. If you've had an O'Doul's Amber, this is similar, but with profoundly more taste. This actually tastes like beer."
"Glowing amber hue with a thinning white head of foam and has nice stringy lace patches that hold well. Smell is light and caramelly sweet of malts. Taste is a bit more of the same with a sweet sensible caramel tone at first, carbonation is light and holds through to a floral fresh hop finish, not bad for a lighter beer. Feel is medium body to lighter feel with an airy dry finish. Played out a bit. I wasn't sure what to think of it due to it being NA, which is actually a surprising quality, cuz it really tasted like albiet weaker, lager styled beer."
"Deep amber color with perfect clarity and a large snow-white head; lace is truly excellent, carbonation is slight. Aroma is quite pronounced, with strong notes of malt extract and caramel sweetness. Taste begins with slight carbonation and pronounced caramel malts, towards the middle of the taste these assume a tart note. Finish is dominated by herbal hops; these balance out the sweet malts rather well. Mouth feel is excellent for a NA beer. Overall, this is the best non-alcoholic beer that I have tried. It certainly beats a soda for refreshment."
"The smell is corn syrup with some malt. The front is paper, giving way to a malty middle. Slight bitterness can be detected in the finish. I've tried a lot of NAs and this is one of my favorite."

"Notes: Actually not that bad for a non-alcoholic brew, more flavour than most NA beers … to sum it up, if you have to drink NA beer and you want flavour, this is your brew. Less than .05% abv."
