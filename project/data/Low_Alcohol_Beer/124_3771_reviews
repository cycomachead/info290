"Overall Drinkability - Horrible. Like a tea made from cardboard and artificial sweetener water. Doesn't really resemble a beer."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow color body, big white foamy head, lastingish. Grainy aroma, strong. Maybe corn. Corn taste, very grainy. Mineraly. Strong taste, fizzy. Not a very good aftertaste. Don't think I'd try again, but compared to Beck's, better."
"Delicate noble hops in the aroma along with a funky vegetal undertone. Glowing golden beer holds a few streams of briskly rising bubbles. Short bright white head fades to a scattered film. A few islands of lace cling to the side of the glass. The body is moderately light and mouthfeel is clean. Herbal hops are overrun by a strong flavor that tastes like a combination of cream of corn and steamed vegetables. The beer is not brewed with corn and it's good for another 10 months so I don't know what the problem is. I expected a Helles with less body and malt flavor, but what I got was a corny mess. I can't imagine why they would even sell this beer. Who the hell would drink this?"
"Fine Carbonation gives this a very clean mouthfeel. Pretty refreshing. Drinkability is good for an NA as well. The lack of overt sweetness keeps this drinkable. I would not rush out and get this, but if I had to drink an NA this would be up there with the other German NA's in quality. I guess the fact that they have been doing them longer gives them an edge over the other NA's"
"The smell is dominated by corn syrup, with just a touch of schpoonk. The corn syrup front is followed by a thin middle that starts to turn slightly sour. Strange. The sourness follows through to the finish, where a slight chemical note creeps in. Some grain and corn in the aftertaste. This is a pretty good NA, but there are several I like better."
"Crystal-clear medium golden color; the head is small and snow-white; there is an abundance of carbonation with really good lace. The unfermented wort notes dominate aroma, there are also some slight hops. Taste begins with sharp carbonation, then sweet honey-like malt notes, which fade into mild hop bitterness. Finish is dry, crisp, and clean. The mouth feel is pleasant, although not exceptional. Overall, this is one of the better NA beers that I have sampled."
"One of the most unique colors I've ever seen in a beer. You can see as you're pouring it that it's very light, and yet it has a bronze cast to it in the glass. The bright white head cannot hold, and quickly drops to a limited collar. It does, however, leave some spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma has the grainy malt aroma of most non-alcohol beers, but also includes a richer note - maybe a touch of Munich malt? The body is thin, and when coupled with a light - but very fine - carbonation level, the mouthfeel is lightly crisp. The flavor is very one-sided with just a dryly grainy maltiness and lightly herbal hoppiness. It finishes dry, with a light bitterness and a lingering grainy flavor. A very unique NA that I'd surely rank within the top 5 alongside Guinness' Kaliber and Anheiseur-Busch's O'Doul's."
