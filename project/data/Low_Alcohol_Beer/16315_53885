3.85,24.2,4,4,3.75,3.5,4,"Overall: Excellent for a low ABV, but a little disappointing once you notice that there's no body to back up the strong hops. Still, this is a brave attempt at making a tasty low ABV brew, and certainly the first one I've ever tried that has anything close to real hop flavour. An added bonus is that the beer isn't too sweet, which is a major flaw of many low ABV beers. This will certainly be a regular low ABV beer for me, although the cost is rather high compared to some of the competition (at least in Finland).","Arborescence","Mar 07, 2014"

Pours a solid brown with lots of chunky lacing - where it lacks is on head and liveliness but otherwise looks great. Nose is hoppy and I'd be fooled blind. Taste's great for next to no alcohol. Great brew and thanks for making this (and for opening a Brewdog pub in London).","Oakenator","Aug 07, 2013"

The lacing is really good on this, very sticky and maintains a great retention. The smell has a nice aroma of malts and hops. The taste of the beer is malty and hoppy also. The flavors are quite nice for a beer with a low ABV. The mouthfeel is drinkable. Overall the beer is good, I would easily say this is the best low ABV beer I've ever had.","Knapp85","Jun 03, 2012"

It looks great and smells nice, but falls down hard with the flavour and mouthfeel. Bonus points for effort - alcohol-free beer doesn't get much attention over here. Worth trying once.","jazzyjeff13","Sep 18, 2011"
3.28,5.8,3,2.5,4,3,3,"overall: Probably the most drinkable N/A beer I ever tasted and definitely more enjoyable to drink than a generic watery alcohol containing lager. Would not feel ashamed in bringing this to a party or event. Keep up the good work BD!","grapetonix","Aug 31, 2011"

2.88,-7.1,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"330 ml bottle, batch 189, best before 7/21/2011. Not sure how fresh this is, but I'll drink it anyway. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is grassy and a bit of citrusy (grapefruit) hops, and some bready malt. Unfortunately the taste isn't as nice as the aroma. It tastes like bitter grassy hops, but not much else. The bitterness isn't exactly nice, but for a beer that has just 0.5% ABV, at least it does have some taste to it. Moutheel/body is light/medium, it's a little bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. It was nice to try this brew, and would try it again if I had a chance to.","bluejacket74","Oct 31, 2010"

3.5,12.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"But...in terms of the beer I really expected nothing at all. Having heard the stramash a year ago about the immature reaction in releasing this beer and the fact that this was a toned down version I expected something totally forgettable. But it was a real surprise. A thin rust brown colour this beer impressed with its hop presence and gave the impression of being a much stronger beer. I will need to give Nanny State another go as I'm judging not just on memory notes but on two separate 2 oz samples as though I was ticking for Scotland. And that just won't do. Still, from my meagre 4 ozs this was very good for what it is.Just wish I tried the original 1.1% 200IBUs when it was avaialable. As a dare of course.","Zimbo","Oct 08, 2010"

2.6,-16.1,4,4,2,2,2,"This review considers the 0,5% ABV version. I like the appearance of it, aswell as the smell. Think hop juice, lots of tropical fruits, citrus, even a hint of licorice. The fun ends here. The taste i PURE hops, a light bitter liquid that leave a long aftertaste. Thats it really. I think it needs a bigger body and a bit more malt to be enjoyable. But it's certainly very interesting for a beer with 0,5% alcohol in it.","LillJoel","Sep 21, 2010"
4.06,31,5,4,4,2,5,"Rusty brick red with an amazing head, the kind that rises an inch above the rim of the glass and retains very well. There is a lovely full-on IPA nose with pine, lemon, lemongrass, pineapple, and orange blossom syrup, and a wholewheat bread aroma. I get some lemon as well. The flavor echoes the aroma, but the mouthfeel isn't quite up to scratch - weirdly thin and watery, which does no favors to the toasty, nutty, tea-like, and hoppy notes that are all individually assertive but harmonious and balanced in tandem, like a good jazz band. Defanged brandy, red and black tea, toast, and citrus are key flavors. I must say, the body here is generally too thin, but that doesn't stop it from being an excellent beer and a perfectly drinkable quaffer.","soulgrowl","Sep 02, 2010"

3.63,17.1,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Besides the fact that it looks great, it's got a bold nose, lots of great flavor, and a very nice creamy mouthfeel. The only real beef I have is that it is a little astringent on the finish, but that is also a product of its bitterness. This brew may not be as big and bad as some other IPAs, be as ""balanced"" as some, or have the flavors that the alcohol contributes, but as an attempt at ""reverse extreme brewing," for lack of a better term, this one is sure worth the effort. One of the better BrewDog achievements so far. Recommended.","Jeffo","Mar 07, 2010"
