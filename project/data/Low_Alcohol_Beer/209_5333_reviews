"Who reads a review of Kaliber?"
""
"When compared to other NA beers this is tops. So far its as close to real beer as I can find.  My wife can't have alcohol in the house so this hits the spot when I'm in the mood and don't want to head to the bar."
"As a recovering alcoholic it's tough to get a decent NA beer in my area.  I had the displeasure of having Clausthaler previously and almost quit searching for other NA beers.  Kaliber, unlike Clausthaler does not have that super disgusting metallic bitter finishing after taste.  More so, Kaliber is kind of sweet to a degree with the malty yeast, almost honey notes on the forefront of the taste.  Mouth feel is flat and liquid, but just having a NA beer that doesn't taste like your back yard fence is an achievement in itself.  I drank it straight from the bottle ice cold like it suggested.  I'll gladly continue drinking Kaliber until I can find one of those tastier NA hefes, wits, or IPAs."

"O: I tried Kaliber basically for the sake of trying a low alcohol beer (I don't dismiss anything out of hand). NA beers are unpopular for a reason, and not just for the reason that it won't get you drunk. This is a poorly made brew in all respects."

"330 ml bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/13/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers, Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cracker, toast, biscuit, caramel, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, toast, cereal, caramel, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, toast, cereal, herbal, and grass on the finish for a very short bit. Okay flavor balance and robustness of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a dry finish and zero lingering flavors. Pretty bland/watery on flavors but not horrible. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and dry mouthfeel that is good. Overall this is a pretty solid low alcohol beer. Solid balance and robustness of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Considering the style, this was pleasant and quite enjoyable."

"Pours a medium amber in color with a about a 1/2 finger of a foamy off-white head. Some spotty lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is mostly of stewed grains for the most part. The taste actually has more going on that the aroma suggests and is of grains, malt with a hint of caramel with a slight dry finish. Slight bitterness in the finish as well but not bad. Actually didn't know this was a 'Near Beer' brew like O'Dell's as I have never seen it before and was sold in another section. Overall, not my style or likes, not because it is a 'near beer' but because I wasn't a big fan of this one."

"O: I poured this one out pretty fast. Lots of tea and vegetables. And neither in a good way. Whew. One of the worst I've ever had."
"Best tasting NA beer I have had so far. way better than O dools and St pauls. my dad who likes Guinness tried it and like it. I would recommend this to anyone. it is a Good malt beer highly recommended they need to make more NA malt beers like this this is an amazing beer."

"Not very wonderful. I know alcohol-free beer is there to meet a specific need, but this is just gross. Looks decent - this is the best thing about it. The aroma and flavour consist primarily of sweetish stewed-grain and a hint of cabbage water. Watery body. Lacking in substance and character - if I needed to avoid alcohol I don't think I would choose this. Give it a miss."

"Overall a bit too sweet for my tastes. Has some apple juice like character."
""
""
""
"Given what this is, it seems a good example of “non-alcoholic” beer. However, it lacks most of what I personally seek from the experience of drinking beer."

"O: The beer looks impressive when poured but after that it’s all downhill. I wouldn’t try this again as there are other low alcohol beers that are much more palatable than this."
""
""
"This is very fizzy. It almost has the body of seltzer water with how light and fizzy it is. It goes down so quickly it takes more sips than usual to get at the flavors."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a nice medium to dark orange amber. Thin head, but some spotty lacing. Faint aroma of malt and yeast. Taste is sweet and malty with some light grain. I like the malt flavor in this and would consider this any time I wanted a no/low alcohol beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really sure how this compares to other NAs but it is extremely unpleasant. It's rather hard to force this swill down."
""
"Not good at all. Might be ok for a non-alcoholic beer but I have not tried enough to make a good comparison. Drain pour."

"Overall, for a near beer, this rates decently. It's flavors I've never experienced in a beer before, but to style, it's on point. Tastes almost like beer. I would still drink a light lager over this though."
"A nice little near beer, crisp, light, slightly sweet, toasted English muffin tasting brew. Another decent thirst quencher for the designated decoy. (Write me if you don't know the joke!)or for when you can't afford to get buzzed out! It is surprisingly beery in flavour, sort of watered down version of Harp."
"Pours golden with big head at first, frothy, but recedes to not much. Aroma of sugar cookies on the nose, quite prominent, with some herbal sweet tea. More sugar cookies on palate, simple grains, and light bodied. More sweetness on finish. Seems targeted at the youthful drinker."
"D: Maybe one of the better N/As out there but not for me."
"Ya know...this ain’t bad for a non-alcoholic beer. Certainly smells and tastes better than your typical adjunct lagers, that’s for sure."
"Poured a 2"" white head which dissipated completely. Clear straw yellow in color. Smell has a little hint of malt and grain but it also has a sort of soapy smell which turned the lady of the house off immediately. Taste has sour malt. The body is watery. Hey, this has much more flavor than the average non-alcoholic beer (and mind you, it does have alcohol, .5% of it) but it's no more than a shadow of real beer."
"Terrible. Don't know why anyone would drink this."
"if for whatever reason I couldn't drink alcohol, I'd just choose another beverage. This doesn't taste like beer."
"D: Nice Non-Alc. Best I've had."
"D: I need to look harder at the bottles I throw in my next random pick-6. Blurgh."
"Overall a ""not horrible"" non-alcohol alternative but I'd rather drink Coke etc."
"D: An solid low ABV beer, worth a shot, has a nice beer character."
"Well, this one actually isn't bad, and I'd take it if I was on some kind of diet or for medical reasons."
"Of all the non alcoholic beers on the market, this is the only that is actually enjoyable. It has a watered down taste, but I suppose thats part of the whole point? Anyways, if you gotta have a few brews but you cant drink the alcohol, this is as goos ad youre gonna get, or if you need a designated driver, but the DD wants to put a few back. 100 times better than O'Douls."
"This is my first ""near beer", and something tells me I'm not gonna wanna get many more...if any. This guy pours a clear pale golden straw with about a finger of thick, though short-lived, large-bubbly froth on top. Things look ""like a normal beer", as my BMC-drinking friends would say, so things aren't goin' too bad so far. The smell is overtly sweet, like corn syrup combined with maple syrup and cane sugar. A weak hint of puffed rice meekly tries to move its way up, but is hampered by the hordes of sweetness. Hmm. This sweetness does not follow into the taste too much, though some of the corn syrup does drip down there. Instead, a very watery though overarchingly mild bitterness reigns, though a tinny, hard water taste eventually owns the court. To simplify: Imagine a cold Coors Light, then water it down (even further). That's what this tastes like. Needless to say, I'm not a fan. The body is nice and light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a very watery feel. If you really needed to drink something like this, it probably wouldn't kill ya, but I would never intentionally put myself in this position if I could avoid it. I expected something better from Guinness."
"Beer is thin and watery. Kind of a lingering sweetness like a dilute Kvass. There is some notes of caramel in the mouth but overall its not pleasant."
"D: Meh, nothing amazing, but I could see how kids would want to drink this to ""pretend"" that they are actually drinking beer. On the flip side, this is not a good introduction to an actual good beer."
"330 ml green bottle, bought in Sweden. Crystal clear very pale yellow colour, big to moderate white head. Typical n/a beer aroma of over-boiled vegetables and baby maize porridge. Thin and watery mouthfeel. The flavour has notes of over-boiled vegetables and wet cardboard, hardly any bitterness. Terrible."
"If you're going to drink a lot of beer, drink good beer and get a designated driver. Skip the NA stuff."
"Mouthfeel = nothing desireable, maybe a bit of corn on the cob. Thin. Drinkability, this probably comes closer to drinking water than any beer I've ever had."
"D - All I can say is that I'm glad that I'm not trying to quit drinking because I don't think I could drink this on a regular basis I guess it's still better than a macro na beer"
"Drinkability? I bought a sixer and this bottle sure left the scene in a hurry. I'm not saying that I'd want to drink it every day but it does make for a good change of pace. I think this is a very good Malt beverage."
"This one was one of the better N/As I have had. It pours to a golden color, with little to no head. It has a sweet quality to it, a malty grainy corn like flavor. It is rather smooth, tastes like a beer at least when it is cold. Has a slight fruity note."
"Overall - if I want something fizzy and low alcohol, I will go with a soda, thank you very much"
"Light on the palate, with a grainy taste that dissipates in seconds. A soda tastes a lot better."
"It's trying to be a Harp, I guess. Not the worst NA out there, but there are better offerings."
"D: Horrible. Stomach turning. I poured it out after two sips. The N/A in the name might come from the brewer writing n/a on the sheet asking what type of beverage this is - the term beverage is not applicable."
"Flavor is not great. Kaliber does not taste like beer. Actually it isn't really beer because the fermentation, once completed, is reversed by evaporation. Tastes like extremely watered down bitter apple juice, with fizz. Mouthfeel is all bubbles. Not good."
"D - For an n/a it is a beer I can't say I was turned off by, just not something I can honestly say is satisfying or drinkable. I would probably take one if it was given since it is pretty good for the low alchohol style, though."
"Honestly, if its between this or no beer at all...I hope youre not too thirsty. Look for other options in NA Beer"
"This beer poured a light amber color with creamy, white foam that slowly settled to leave a thin ring on the surface. The smell was surprisingly good: dry caramel and molasses malt aromas. The taste was dry caramel and molasses with some woody and grain notes, and with good, aromatic hops at the finish. Not bad at all for a Non-Alcohol beer. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with light body and decent carbonation. The malty flavors and light hoppiness lingered. This was a surprisingly flavorful N/A beer, and I will look for it when the need arises."
"Of the NA beers that I have tried thus far, this definitely is the best. Imagine a Harp Lager minus the alcohol and you have Kaliber. Very malty aroma and flavor as it is sweet with a bit of hop bitterness. The lack of alcohol results in it being a bit over the top in sweetness. Still, this has flavor unlike the other major American brands; which taste like lemon flavored Perrier."
"D-I haven't had a low-alcohol brew in several years...this one was sitting in the fridge for awhile, but it was better than I expected and easy to drink."
"Out of a bottle this 'beer' was a pale amber color with good clarity and good rising carbonation. The head was two fingers of of-white foam that became a thin cap and left good lacing. The aroma was of cereal grains and sweet malt - think Product 19 Cereal. The flavors were dry at first and the yeast was distinctly similar to Guinness . Then it got sweeter with the cereal grains, a hint of toasted malt and a rather European taste like salt water taffy. The mouthfeel was semi-smooth, the body light and the carbonation medium. As far as the non-alcoholics go, this is probably one of the best."
"Conclusion: Since I'm still on my Lenten kick, this is (sadly) the only beer I get to enjoy on St. Patty's day...that being said, for what it is, it's not bad. The only other NA beer I've tried to date is Odouls; where Odouls is very similar to many light macro lagers (but fairly lacking in flavor), Kaliber has much more flavor but it's less ""beerish"" and more ""fresh wort"". All in all, not too bad for what it is."
"Pours a pretty clear orangish off-brown color body, with a small creamy off-white head. Funky aroma, some maltiness and some funk. Berry aroma. Blueberry. Strong ripe blueberry pancake smell. Tastes like blueberries, very carbonated. Thick carbonated taste, soda water harsh. Light sweet taste. Better than water? Maybe."
"D-I thought I really liked this at the bar the other day and it is fine...much better than a Sharps or O'Douls, etc...this has a nice sweeter flavor and if you try real hard you might be able to convince yourself this has some ""bock"" like notes. Overall though the thin body and watery texture keeps this from being a great NA...decent...not bad....a nice change up if you don't want the alcohol but I'd much prefer the Beck's NA which is actually very good."
"Overall: God forbid the human that like this shit. It is not good. There is a carbonation mouth feel with little to no finish except for that funky note."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep caramel copper with a 2 inch white head that left no lacing as the beer recedes. The aroma is pretty vacant from the beer. There is just a slight caramel note if you really focus. This beer is pretty void for flavor also. Slight toffee notes with a club soda flavor intermingled. The mouthfeel is dry and unassuming. This is probably one of the better beers for a NA but give me the booze. I think that the process of extracting the alcohol really took a lot out of the beer. Judging by the color, I actually thought I was in for a treat."
"Notes: Overall it had more beer flavor than I expected (similar to a weak watered down English Bitter) but I still wouldn't seek this one out."
"This bottle was left in my fridge by my father-in-law on his last visit, so I decided to pop it and see what it tasted like. Pours almost still with no real head. Light brownish amber. Smells like Wasa crackers, very crackery with rye and pumpernickel aromas. Dry malt. Light tasting with some grainy sourness, more of the crackery flavor and some mouthcoating sweetness at the end that is a bit cloying. Don't think I could drink a whole one."
"I had high hopes for Kaliber, since it's brewed by the makers of Guinness. Alas, I was disappointed. Kaliber boasts a strong, sickly sweet aroma of wort, kind of a hay-like barnyard smell. It tastes sweet too, with hints of corn, but mostly just like sugar water with hay in it. In a word: gross."
"Drinkability - This beats most low alcohol beer simply by providing something to taste. Doesn't exactly deliver much in the way of beer flavor - but you can't have everything. I'd pick this over the other low alcohols I've tried."
"A truly great beer... has a delicious flavour for a reduced alcohol beer .. the foam level is awesome, lower on the lacing ... flavour is good, even fooled a friend thinking this was a regular beer ... wonderful on a warm day when alcohol is not an option!!"
"Very pale clearish, orange amber color. Frothy white head that faded quickly. Oddly sweet malt smell. kind of plasticy bandaid-ish, medicinal sweetness. Tastes like a honey dipped band-aid. Strange, unnatural, and I would rather have a coke poured in a beer bottle if I wanted people to think I was drinking beer without drinking beer. Awful. I can't believe the ratings are even this high."
"The beer emerges from the 12 ounce bottle a limpid gold with a depleted semi-creamy white head that evaporates leaving a patchy coating of lace to almost cover the glass. Nose is sweet malted grain, fresh and crisp to the senses, start lightly sweet with a decent grain presence, top is light in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops present and light as one would expect, quite dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew for its type. Do to a recent recurring, medical problem, It satisfies my taste for beer, not the alcohol, I just like the taste, besides how much water and Gatorade can one person take? lol"
"D - Loads of carbonation (when combined with a near-freezing temperature) help this one go down easy. Easily the best NA that I've tried so far."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The appearance is actually surprisingly pretty good with a orange/amber color with a nice creamy white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is decent as well and a little better than expected with some malt and dark bread. The taste is pretty faint and watery with just a touch of malt. The mouthfeel is the one trait that really detracts from the brew as it is thin and fizzy like a soda. Overall, this is a beer that is decent for what it is but really lacking in the flavor department. I poured my bottle into a glass, but I think this beer actually may be a little better straight out of the bottle."
"This low-alcohol beer promises, but fails to deliver. Maybe because I am so used to fine imports and craft brews? Aroma is malty with a hint of sweetness. Color is a deep golden brown, so it at least looks like real beer. Flavor, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It scarcely tastes like beer - the flavor is thin and, though not nasty, barely mediocre. It feels watery, like a ""light"" beer. An ""A" for effort, but unfortunately somehow the brewers removed the taste along with the alcohol."
"It looks like Guinness has taken it on the chin in N.A. Shootout (With Blanks) IV. This isn't anywhere close to good low alcohol beer, although it isn't quite the worst version that I've ever had. Not only that, but the name has always reminded me of a brand of condoms for some reason. I'll refrain from any jokes about how flaccid Kaliber is. But it is."
"This non alcoholic brew has a clear yet dull copper amber color. There is light retention of a white head and light retention. There is plenty in the nose, unfortunately somewhat more than in the taste. There are smells of honey, nuts, substantial malts, with a bit of a grassy odor. The taste is very bready and grassy. There are no hope to speak of. This brew tastes kind of like wort smells, very malty and light. Tastes more like a beer themed refreshment than an actual beer. The mouthfeel is light and crisp. All that said, for the style, it's an ok non-alcoholic beer."
"HOWEVER, in the stores, this stuff is $8 for a six! I would drink it again if I want a n/a at a bar, but I'd never buy this at home. Still, one of the better NAs I've tried, but OMNA still wins for taste/value."
"Somewhat disappointing. Better ice cold and right out of the bottle."
"I like my beers to taste more, especially from hops. This was a bit tame. If I want a good non-alcohol beer I'd choose a Clausthaler or Jever Fun instead."
"Extremely tangy, sharp and crisp  to take your mind away from the off tastes. This was a real struggle to finish! But as the label advises: Serve Ice Cold . No argument there. I cant imagine people drinking this stuff to avoid alcohol  better to just drink a diet coke with lime to blend into a social situation."
"I was really looking forward to trying this as Guinness' NA beer. The color was golden with the scent of almost apple juice mixed with a little bit of beer. the taste was smooth with barely any beer falvor with an aftertaste that tasted like a corn soda. The afertaste stuck in my mouth all night even after I brushed my teeth and made me sick. Stick with Clausthaler if you must drink an NA beer."
"The carbonation is strong, almost sharp, and short."
"Dark brass with a big-bubble head. Nose is dirty dishwater that someone dumped a stale beer into. Taste is malty and sweet. Beer soda. The mouthfeel is quite thin and tastes like bad soda water. Not very drinkable...the sweetness is tough to deal with after a few sips."
"Why do I bother? Wait, I know...Wifey dosen't like me to drink during the week! Pours a nice golden color,with a better head and lace than some regular beers. This review is comparing to other NA's . Light mouthfeel with a better than average taste. Still has that sweet malt taste. If you have to have a NA,give it a shot."
"Taste is like an unboiled wort, sans hops. Purely of malt, and like licking the paddle after cleaning the container of light malt extract. It's rather boring and simple, and I get the feeling that if this were boiled down, you'd get the same ingredient that I would later pour in to my beer. I can only assume that the unfermented malt sugars are there to give it the characteristic of a good beer, and while it's a good idea, it just isn't that good."
"Not worth drinking even if u are driving, avoid"
"I guess this is no better than I could've expected, but at least it's a step up from, say, an O'Doul's. Pours a soda pop fizziness with no head. But I must admit, it does look a bit like an ale, and there's a slight ale smell, so points there. Taste is still weak and watery, but there are the remains of a slightly malty ale taste here, even a slightly floral hop note. If you don't compare it to real beer, it stands up as something you can drink for lunch that's still less than half the sugar of a soda."
"Drinkability - getting used to it right towards the end of the bottle. I could drink another actually. An adult, non-sugary soda pop that you can safely drink and drive on. I think it would surprise many at a blind tasting."
"Big, fizzy, active, noisy, white head leaves runny spots of lacing. Superclear beer with a dark gold color (almost tending toward an ambery color). Lots of carbonation. The nose is indistinguishable from corn syrup. Sweet cloying corn in the front. A surprisingly full middle is slightly tangy. Dries to a sparkling water taste in the finish. Total corn aftertaste with cracker-schpoonk burps. It's not a bad NA. There's lots of flavor, but it's almost all corn."
"I think this is my fav NA beer, handsdown. I discovered it from a friend who was on medication that wouldn't allow him to drink alcohol, so he got this stuff instead. I think that if you can drink this style beer, then you are a true beer lover. It's about enjoying the beer and not drinking to get drunk. Anyways, i was really impressed with the taste. It had a subtle citrus taste going on with the presence of malts. Looking at some other reviews leads me to believe I may have gotten a good batch of the stuff. Sure, it's no highly ranked beer, but it definately has it's pluses. The smell was simialr to most beers of the kind, but had most substance than most NA brews. Just like the taste, there was the presence of malts and citrus, but also had the element of some floralness. If you haven;t had it and are looking for a good NA beer, I say go for it."
"Lt brown color, medium head. Sweet, near fruity taste, somewhat cider like. Some malts, no hoppyness. Mouthfeel is thin. Very little flavor, taste is thin. There is an off taste, not able to identify. Finish is slightly sweet. Aftertaste has some maltyness to it. Not much to this beer, no alcohol and NO beer taste. BAD BEER!"
"What's wrong with just drinking water? Not enough calories? I could think of better things to do with grain, like, making bread for example."
"A crystal-clear, deep-amber body rests beneath a full head of frothy white foam. It slowly erodes to a thin surface covering ; but initially leaves some thin lacing about the glass. The nose delivers a touch of wort-like caramelish malt that's carried over into the flavor, and seems to be the main note of the beer. Otherwise it's clean, and delicately crisp in the mouth. One of the better non-alcoholic beers."
"Crystal-clear dark golden color with a quite decent cloudtop head, mild carbonation, good lace. Aroma of sweet malt, a bit like sweet horse feed and hay, not unpleasant, somewhat reminscent of malt syrup. Taste begins with a sight sting of carbonation, sweet malt flavors and grassy notes, towards the end of the taste some mildly bitter hops appear. The finish is clean and dry; the mouthfeel is a bit watery. All things considered, Kaliber is fairly decent, in fact, surprisingly so."
"Drinkability & Notes: Not bad for a near beer, I have memories of high school back in the 80’s of drinking this stuff just because of the taste."
"Clear amber in hue, which was a pleasant surprise as it wasnt a clear-yellow abomination, the off-white head was smallish, maybe a half finger, it was quick to dissipate. There was no subsequent lace. Strong tea-like nose, it is very noticeable that the alcohol is absent; there is little depth. Dry, tealeaf palate, malt is scantly discernible and there is little hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is not too light or thin, which is a plus, moderate carbonation. The finish is curt, slightly leafy and malty. Very refreshing, something Id recommend for those who cannot drink alcohol. Frankly, this brew is closer to iced tea than beer, I guess, at times, that could be a good thing. This was a one-time drink for me."
"Not something that makes me want to run and grab another, but it probably exceeded my expectation. When a NA is in order, this bears enough beer traits to do the job. There are probably better NAs out there, but there are certainly worse."
"Grabbed this one by mistake out of a friend's refrigerater. Immediately spit it into the sink. Did not taste like beer, but wather like a ""tea"" product. Avoid at all costs."
"Pretty bad, but slightly drinakble surprisingly, very thin watery texture, a bit fizzy and just not much happening in the end, sorry, its hard to write much about this one."
"Initially a pleasant nose with light malt and a very quick trace of hops, then it turns to a mix of sour and sweet.  Small head that's short lived.  Medium gold color, clear and lots of bubbles on the side of the glass, like soda.  Light taste overall and rather thin too.  Qualities of malt to flavor, a little sweet, with slight dryness in middle to end.  Virtually no finish.  Seems like something beerish to drink if for any reason alcohol can't be comsummed."
"A good brew to drink briskly, but no use in lingering.  Solid flavor, mostly beery, but taste falls off quickly.  Try one out, you probably will be surprised.  Cheers!"
