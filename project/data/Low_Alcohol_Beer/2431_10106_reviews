"O: Not bad for a low alcohol beer - has aspects of both a Pilsner and an American Adjunct Lager. Not sure I would get it with any regularity but it was worth trying."

"Not much going on here that I can appreciate."
"o: quite refeshing, like Clausthaler, this could easily pass for a decent pale Euro lager."
"Cheers!"
"It was only a buck, so I guess if for some reason I need it, this is what I would grab."
"Pretty easy drinking for the style, offering just enough body to keep things interesting and nothing to detract. Carbonation does empty pretty quickly however, lending almost tea like qualities to the bottom of the glass."
"Oh, and I see that I'm continuing my run of ironic milestone reviews. Number 100 was Corona Light, now 300 is an alcohol-free beer."
"If I was forced to drink this, I wouldn't be contemplating suicide. Is that a compliment? It'll have to do."
"This is the one area where the beer is fairly successful combining compotent carbonation without going fizzy and finishing somewhat thick in the mouth. This would be for the designated driver who really needs to feel like they're drinking with the crowd. Not very good but actually better than a number of mass-produced beers I've tried. Glad I've at least tried a non-alcoholic though."
"Quite nice. A little wort-y for me ideally, but pretty close to real beer in terms of aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass twistoff. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The biggish, foamy head is active, but not too fast. Creamy-whitish. The beer is a clear gold, hinting at being deep. Lots of spots of lacing. The aroma is very sweet: sugary corn. Man, that's some sweet corn. It carries over to the dusty front. The middle shows some caramel, but there's a chemical distraction. Finish is fairly bitter, never losing the sweet corn. This is an ok NA. The bitterness at the end is pleasant. Second tier."
"I wouldnt want to drink more than one of these..though its not truelly horrid."
"Really drinkable, the best NA brew I have yet tasted."
"A crystal-clear, deep-gold body is topped by a good-sized head of creamy bright-white foam that holds quite well and leaves splotchy lace about the glass. Standard-sized bubbles race towards the surface, obviously adding to its retention. A distinctly grainy malt greets you in the nose along with some skunky hops despite the brown glass bottle. The body is medium and its median level carbonation leaves it crisp on the tongue. The same rich, grainy malt appears in the flavor, although it tastes a bit cooked. It's worty, and similar to liquid extract malt. Some floral and spicy hops come through the malt, and it's backed by a bold bitterness. It finishes dry with just a thin layer of residual sticky malt. Served well chilled it passes as a fair substitue for a quality German pilsner. As it warms and the true flavor of the malt becomes more apparent, however, it loses some of its refreshing character and becomes a bit cloying."
