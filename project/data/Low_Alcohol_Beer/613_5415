Which seems to have a bitter coot, but not unpalatable as the thought Kunstmann and Brahma 0.0. Curiosity killed. Oh, and thanks to colleague by Kel birthday present!","denisconrado","Jun 20, 2014"

3.65,30.4,3.25,3.25,4,3.25,3.75,"Overall one of the better N/A beers available. Some real hops. Dry bitter finish.","Spikester","Dec 29, 2012"
3.54,26.4,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours light golden with a little central bone white foam. Brilliant clarity. Smells of light grain, a little corn, some herbal hops - actually smells like a decent pilsner! Flavor of grain, some astringent rice-ee-ness, a little bit of a apple pith character, pretty watered down pilsen style - I guess that's part of the product. Thin bodied with hi carb and a wet finish. Not bad, not bad at all. Beats soda pop at 90 calories per bottle.","harrymel","Sep 03, 2012"

3.17,13.2,4,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is thin but not sweet like most of them. It has a nice earthy hoppy bitterness at the back. There is a great pilsen malt flavor. The overall experience is kind of like a bad pilsner, boring pilsner but it is not a horrible sweet syrupy mess like most of these beers are. Like I said, the best I've had so far.","drabmuh","Mar 02, 2010"

3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a very light yellow with a small white head. The Aroma is filled with adjuncts, with the overall aroma being that of corn tortillas. The flavor is more of the same with some light hops in addition to the heavy corn. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The flavor of this beer is basically that of a major macro lager, only with none of the alcohol.","Mora2000","Dec 19, 2006"
2.76,-1.4,3,2,3,3,3,"Almost tastes like a beer. Grainy flavor isn't as bad as most N/As I've tried, comes close to a bad Pils flavor. Somewhat watery and seems to have some generic acidic balance rather than hop balance. Almost drinkable. Good N/A.","BeerZack","Dec 13, 2006"

2.62,-6.4,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,2,"I just drank this beer with dinner tonight. I was not impressed! It had little flavour but a strong aftertaste. It does go down alright but it does not live up to the Bitburger name. I compared it to some other ""Near Beers"" just to make sure I gave it a fare shake it was not my least favorite on but it was a close runner-up.","MTNboy","Apr 22, 2006"
2.16,-22.9,3,2,2,2,2.5,"Bitburger Drive traded wins on appearance and smell and managed to stay at least even on mouthfeel. Unfortunately, it lost the all-important flavor comparison and is therefore the loser of NA Shootout (With Blanks) III. I could actually drink this stuff if I had to, which is more than I can say for at least one of its fellow German low alcohol beers (cough... Paulaner... cough... ThomasBrau... cough).","BuckeyeNation","May 21, 2005"
2.43,-13.2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"This is the mirror image of most NA beers; it has too many hops for the malt. Interesting, and I've had far worse, but I wouldn't buy it again.","shererjt","Dec 09, 2004"
2.38,-15,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste like a beer, which is the objective of a low-alcohol. Unfortunately, like a macro lager. Still, it did the drink at the end of a warm long afternoon. Somewhat sweet and aggressive carbonation. Pale yellow, no head. Grassy, metallic. Thin mouthfeel.","Sammy","May 17, 2004"
3.67,31.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Compared to other beers, Drive tastes like an average continental pils. I rated it based on that. Compared to other non-alcoholic beers, though, it is absolutely one of the best. It feels like, smells like beer, and tastes like beer. If for some reason I had to stop drinking alcohol, this is what I would take as an alternative.","allengarvin","Mar 09, 2004"
3.44,22.9,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Bitburger Drive pours yellow with some big bubbles (probably the fault of my dirty glassware.) There's a loose head of foam that settles to pretty much nothing. The aroma is of fresh grains and sort of cereal-like and could be covered up with some hops. The body is a little more full than a real Bitburger and the hops are diminished somewhat. The finish is pretty dry. I'd like a little more hops; especially up front. Why else would want I want to drink an N.A. beer -- I want to taste malt AND hops -- but I can't have all the alcohol.","marcobrau","Dec 12, 2003"

1.91,-31.8,2.5,1.5,2,2,2,"Lotsa lagerfunk in the nose. The front is toast (not toasted grain, but toasted WonderBread). The middle is strangely bitter with a metallic finish. At higher temps, some grains show in the aftertaste. To its credit, this beer has none of the cloying cornsyrup of many other NAs. But even still, it's pretty awful. There are many better NAs out there.","kbub6f","Aug 11, 2002"
3.03,8.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Crystal-clear light golden color with a medium-sized snow-white head, well carbonated with good lacing. Aroma consists mainly of sweet malt, like unfermented wort, and a decent hop presence. Taste begins with a surge of carbonation across the tongue, followed by slightly tart malt flavors. A mild hop presence asserts itself soon afterward which rises to a slightly metallic note at the end of the taste. Finish is quite dry. The mouth feel, while nothing spectacular, is not bad. One of the better non-alcoholic beers, Drive manages to avoid the excessive sweetness often noted in these products.","Pegasus","Beers"
1,-64.3,1,1,1,1,1,"I bought this by mistake, thinking it was the normal Bitburger, pretty crappy, very thin and watery, in fact i might as well have been drinking water, at least it prolonged my night a bit being a non-alcoholoic beer(hehehe).","rastaman","0"
