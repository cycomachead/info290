"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15A). Bottle 50 cl - Batch L292104. AROMA: sweet aroma without the characteristics of a weizen. APPEARANCE: pale golden color with some haziness. thick moussy white head with good retention. TASTE: sweet aftertaste without bitterness, wheat flavour and the typical esters and phenols of a true weizen. PALATE: low, watery body with low carbonation. OVERALL: another alcohol free beer that tastes like alcohol free beer, without the flavours of the base beer."

"D - an acceptable but different example of the style"

"Carbonation is much too high, although I can see why it is so, considering the sweetness."
""
"Overall: I still don't get alcohol-free beers. They always taste poor. If i wanted to drink something non-alcoholic, I would have water, or juice or something. Not this rubbish - particularly not for AU$45 a case (2013)."
""
"Another rather tasty low to no alcohol offering from the big German brewers, though I get damned little wheat beer characteristics in this one - does the alcohol removal process also take out the same from the inherent malt? If so, an acceptable enough sacrifice, I suppose."

"O: This beer is rather flavorful considering it is non-alcoholic but it could use some more hops to balance out the malts, especially the honey-like flavors."

"Bleh - not brilliant. I admire the principle of offering low-alcohol beer to consumers, but in this case the natural weissbier character has suffered greatly. The result is sweet, bland and one-dimensional. Where have those tasty yeast esters gone? Unless you need to avoid ethanol for some reason, I would recommend that you avoid this beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light and weak, still fairly crisp. Overall as a beer, this is pretty average but for the style it is not bad at all. Compared to Coors Lite, it is a much better beer experience. I'm sure there are some circumstances where I might have another one of these."

"i saw an article in the paper awhile ago featuring this beer. it stated that athletes in europe drink this after sporting events, like americans dring gatorade, because it's enriched with vitamins and minerals. i figured what the hell i'll try it. pours a clear pale yellow with a huge billowy off white head. that leaves lacing that i wasnt expecting. not much for the nose and tastebuds, just a slight grainess. has a medium body mouthfeel to it with good carbonation. overall i was surprised by this. it drinks like everyother beer, nice and smooth. good clean finish. actually felt like i was drinking a real beer, not a near beer."
"I don't know why this beer gets such low grades, I think it's one of the best NA beers out there. A little high in the effervescence. A delicious faux-hefeweizen!"
"O - Not bad for 0% Alcohol."
"My hopes that this would taste good have all evaporated now. It is medium in body and really malty. It tastes like a shitty low alcohol beer and does not in anyway resemble erdinger. Oh well. Never again."
"Light and refreshing wheat beer but rather lackluster since there is no banana or clove note."
"It tastes sweet and malty, kind of like a beer pop. Which is probably the closest description I can make. Refreshing but I found myself returning to water after this (and not coming back)."
"D- very easy and not filling"
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some bad grain-like qualities. The flavor is corn and wheat, very macro tasting. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Not sure why this is called a hefeweizen since there are no banana or clove notes to it. It tastes like your average, not very good low alcohol beer."
"Another average alcohol-free beer. It does have a bit more flavor than others but otherwise, avoid."
"Overall, not much of a hef but not bad for a NA and fairly refreshing in its own right."
"D- Not a good beer, but it's not really beer so I can't complain to aggressively. Regardless, will not drink again."
"Hmmm....avoid."
"Better than expected but I didn't have high expectations."
"the only good thing i can say about this beer is it looked good in the glass. poured a slightly hazy light yellow with a four finger white head that held very well with some lacing. smells like the beer went sour. taste just as bad. i don't know how they can sell something that bad."
"Being it must have been fresh I was shocked that it was so bad. Stick to regular endinger and keep off the road instead. Don´t try to keep up with the locals that I´ve seen drink by thier cars before taking the wheel."
"Light cooked barley and grainy wheat balanced by light citrus acidity. Theres something else going on too, I wanna say it's like meringue or nutty, but its really more like cooked plastic. Despite the off characteristics, this is actually a drinkable N/A."
"D - Not bad but a bit too sweet. If you want light beer then this is probably one of the better options."
"Poured a huge off-white head that sat above a hazy golden beer. Freakish sweet aroma is a bit grainy and corny; sort of like a bowl of half eaten frosted flakes that sat out all day. Same thing in the flavor, but even more potent. It finishes rediculously sweet and with a slight bitter bite. This tastes nothing like any wheat beer I've head (no wheat, just pure unfermented malt flavor), and there is no excuse for that. I have had NA and low alcohol Hefe's that have the right flavors/aromas, and don't have off-flavors. The sweetness takes over the mouthfeel and ruins that too. Forget about this one, unless you like Malta and don't mind that this is labeled a Weissbier."
"I drank half the bottle, poured the remaining half in my glass, took one sip, and promptly poured the rest down the drain, along with the money I spent on this. Not at all drinkable."

"Great taste , smell, feel and apperance. 3 thumbs up!"
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden amber color with a tall, well-sustaining white head. A sugary sweet honey character dominates both the aroma and the flavor of this brew. It tastes a bit like a beer that is, well, unfinished. Whats more, I cant really detect too much in the way of hops. Sure there is a bit of that banana zest that youd expect from a hefe, but it doesnt do much for this beers drinkability. I cant say its horrible but it doesnt make you want another. However, there are two bright points here: one, brats simmered in this beer come out especially flavorful (dont ask me why) and, as I slowly but surely finish off the six-pack, this brew is starting to grow on me"
"Erdinger Weissbier Alkoholfrei is not a good low alcohol beer. Needless to say, it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with a real hefe weizen. In fact, this would have been a better experience if it was flavorfrei. I guess low alcohol beer is the only option for some. I feel bad that it isn't possible to make it more palatable."
"The beer dispenses from the 500ml brown bottle a limpid gold with a monumental semi-creamy white head that slowly evaporates leaving a fine coating of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is sweet malted grain, fresh and crisp to the senses, start lightly sweet with a decent grain presence, top is light in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops present and light as one would expect, quite dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew for its type, and as my medical problems sometimes curtails my consumption of high-end beers, this non-alcohol beer does satisfy my urge for a Bit-O-Hops."
"This is about as good a NA beer as could be hoped for, and in one of my favorite styles, Bavarian hefe. Now if only I could find a NA cask-conditioned bitter, I'd be set. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances which I won't relate here, I am temporarily confined to the alcohol-free portion of the beer spectrum, and it hasn't been nearly as unpleasant as I'd imagined. This beer gives crazy head. It takes about 10 minutes to cram all the beer and foam from the bottle into a weizen glass. Snowdrifts linger inside the bottle, and the glass never loses its thick layer of suds. The beer is golden, and hazy but not glowing the way some hefes can be. There is some wax, pepper and clove in the aroma; the smell is perhaps the most weizen-like feature. The taste is predominately sweet, with some light graininess and grapefruit hop. It's oddly reminiscent of an American extra pale ale, like Full Sail. Cookie dough lingers on the tongue. Winter spices are here also, weird but not in a bad way. I've noticed in NA beers a certain bread-staleness which is normally masked or preserved in regular beer by the alcohol. Here it is not too intrusive. It's a tasty beer, with a full if not sensuous mouthfeel, and good drinkability. It is, surprisingly, closer to my dreamed-of NA bitter than I would have expected."
"A tasty liquid for sure but it doesn't REALLY taste like beer, it tastes like bread. This would go great with brats and sauerkraut."
"Taste is simple and thin, however reasonably pleasant"
"I know this is an N/A, but if I were given it in a glass and told to drink it, I would've been hard pressed to know its was alcohol free. Pours out to a bright yellow, with a generous, fluffy head. Taste is that of a standard weiss, albeit a bit lighter. I detected bananas and clove in the taste. A gentlemen that frequents the local beer store I go to cannot drink alcohol and told me about this one. Tasty for an N/A believe it or not."
