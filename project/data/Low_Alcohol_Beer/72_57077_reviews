"O - Not the best LA beer around. Sweetness needs better management."
"I wouldn't drink this beer again, but if for some strange reason I desired an 'alcohol-free' beer, like I was desperate for something resembling beer... this might fit the bill. But then, there's Chinotto, and Sanbitter, or just straight lime juice, they're all nice bitter drinks that can suit this purpose."
"Not a beer for me. Very empty, bland and eventually unpleasant."
"Taste is not too bad for a non-alcohol beer. It is sweet, but considering the style, this isn't syrupy or too full-bodied. The normal yeast character is still intact, with notes of banana and clove. I could drink this more often if beer with alcohol wasn't nicer."
"D- The cooked vegetable was such a turn-off that I didn't finish the glass. This killed the drinkability for me."
