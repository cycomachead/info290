1.69,-29,2.5,1,2,2,1.5,"I do not even know what else to say and can barely hide my dislike even now. THin and sickly in taste like an adjunct lager but without the added benfit of getting you pissed and making you forget the taste.","DerBayer","Jul 26, 2008"
2.18,-8.4,3.5,3,2,1.5,1.5,"The taste, though, is very thin, light, and dry. It's watery and has almost no malt or grain character. It's not bland, though, because it has a strong, grassy-bitter herb hp character that completely dominates the beer in the absence of malt or grain. The resulting character is bitter green grass. I guess that this is about as good was one can expect from non-alcoholic beer, but it's still pretty rough.","Offa","Mar 13, 2007"
2.31,-2.9,3,2,2,2.5,3,"Taste is overly carbonated, a bit watery, but definitely beerish. I mean, you could drink a whole bunch of these without being upset at the flavor, but why would you?","Overlord","Beers"
3.22,35.3,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pilsner style alcohol free beer. Decently tall froathy white head fades briskly. Glowing golden beer holds a few dozen streams of tiny bubbles. Solid herbal hop aroma with a light sweetness from the pale malts. Mouthfeel is a bit soft and the beer finishes clean. There is a faint sweetness in the flavor, and an astringent bitterness from the hops that comes off as slightly chemical. It's has the typical freaky hop flavor found in most non-alcoholic Pilsners, but it's not too pronounced. It's fine, and better then the typical American Macro NA so if you can find this and want to save your kidneys for another day give this one a try.","HappyHourHero","0"
