There are some nice wort-like malt and noble hop aromas in there once the skunk dissipates in the nasal passages. Unlike most green bottle beers the skunk aroma does not decrease much over time. Flavor is pretty good with some sticky pale malt and noble hop flavors to make it enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light, slightly wort-y and not as rough as other NAs.

As soon as I started pouring this into a mug it was nothing but skunk and dank pot. The area around me smells like bedroom in college. Taste is really sweet and grainy. Really wasn't expecting it to be this sweet, but it is with lots of grainy flavors, slightly floral, and no real hoppiness. It's actually not awful, but not really good either. Hard to get past the skunky aroma though, so I try not to smell it as I drink it. Mouthfeel is like a light lager. Meh... I haven't had an N/A beer in probably 10 years or more, and this really isn't enjoyable largely because there's no alcohol in it (well, a negligible amount) and it really detracts from the flavor. Beer really does need to have sort of alcohol qualities to give it it some more flavor... But anyways, not need to contemplate it this much. It's a beer, and skunky, sweet, grainy one at that. Not good but not horrific.","KeefD","Aug 20, 2011"

My pour created just better than a finger of rocky, bone-white head that fell like a souffle when you bang the oven door closed. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, given that I could see into the future with it. Lots of CO2 bubbles were in evidence. Nose was Saaz-like, not downright skunked, so I am erring on the side of caution. Mouthfeel was medium but with a heavy metallic taste in the mouth. This was not skunked, but neither was it much good! Feh, I could taste Saaz hops in the background, but the metallic flavor up front was more than I wanted to deal with. Finish left me cold, at best. I just could not shake that metallic taste which seemed pervasive from start to finish. I'm sorry Todd had an allergic reaction and I would not foist this on anybody.","woodychandler","Mar 27, 2011"

All in all, not that bad for a non-alcoholic beer.","Pegasus","Mar 16, 2003"
2.56,13.3,4,3,2.5,3,1.5,"After letting the beer air out (quite skunky) I realized, I I remembered correctly,  that it looked remarkably like Okocim Premium, radiant gold with a sticky white head. Malt and grains aroma with very little hops. The taste perfectly mirrored the aroma. There was a sweet pale malt taste, but no hops. The beer had a strange astringent bitterness to it, but it seemed not be from hops. With more of a hop bitterenss this beer wouldn't taste bad at all. Also, there was soemthing remarkably unfulfilling about this, and I don't think it was the lack of alcohol. The lack of bitterness left the taste buds feeling lonely and the beer watery. A nice hop bitterness would bring this beer a long way.","yen157","Nov 09, 2002"

The appearance is good amber-gold with a classic german head.Stop there and just look at it.The smell is alittle "" skunky"". Mouth is left cotton-like.Not impressed with St. Pauli, go for the other two offerings.My problem is I still have three of these left!!","chilidog","Aug 30, 2002"

2.64,16.8,2,3,2.5,3,2.5,"The points I gave it are for judging it as a NA. Man, from the review Jason gave I thing someone wizzed in the bottle and put the cap back on. I did not get any metalic flavors nor the astringancy. What I got out of it was a nice floral nose and a mild hop bitterness. Yes there was a bit of sweet (unfermented??) malt but I think that is better than none at all like the Bitburger or the Clausthaler (SP?). I haven't tried all of the NAs but this one at least has some redeeming quality to it. Luckily I don't HAVE to drink NAs but from the people I know that do this one ranks way up there. Now if I compared this to regular beers it would get a 1 to 1.5. I would still take this over a Bud.","mattmaples","Feb 08, 2002"
