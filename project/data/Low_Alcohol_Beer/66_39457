3.32,33.3,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.75,3.25,"you have to take this in context of other NA beers, and in that context this is certainly one of the better ones going. authentically german, with a malt character similar to a becks or something like that, and beautifully carbonated and dry. if you told me this was a normal german lager, i might not know, at least after several ipas or something where my palate was a little cloudy, its pretty close. real pale in color, with a decent head and crystal clear. its got hop character in the finish, quite german as well, and the whole thing is real refreshing. my only critique of it is that it has in both nose and taste that classic import green bottle skunky thing going on, not a staleness, but a light or oxidation issue that distracts. its not subtle, so it gets in the way of me appreciating this all the way, but even with it, its one of the better NA beers going right now.","StonedTrippin","Sep 06, 2014"

2.59,4,2.75,2.5,2.5,3.25,2.5,"O: This beer is easy to drink but has the unmistakable flavor of a non-alcoholic beer that isn't very appetizing. Its best quality is its fuller mouthfeel compared to other beers in the style.","metter98","Sep 29, 2010"

3.55,42.6,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is very hoppy for a non-alcoholic beer. Spicy noble hops, grass, and minerals are all present. The isn't as bold as the aroma, but hops still drive the flavor. There more minerals in the flavor than in the aroma, and a bit less of the spiciness. The mouthfeel is very thin, and carbonation is a little too high. Overall, this is the best non-alcoholic beer I have had. However, if for some reason I couldn't drink alcohol I think I would simply forget about beer altogether rather than drink and NA beer. I probably wouldn't have tried this if a distributor hadn't given it to me.","KarlHungus","0"
