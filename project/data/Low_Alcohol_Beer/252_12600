3.14,-6.8,5,3.5,3,2,3,"O - Surprisingly good for a non-alcoholic beer. Easily as good as many macros.","dansmcd","Aug 01, 2011"

2.66,-21.1,4,3,2.5,2,2.5,"O: I'm not impressed, although I'm not an ""expert"" on weissbiers, I've had better non-alcoholic wheat beers. The traditional flavours are there, but it seems watered down, and the mouthfeel is kind of nasty. Perhaps it could work better with food.","stjaernstoft","Beers"

2.76,-18.1,4,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Bottle. Damned drink driving laws in Australia (limit is 0.05%) :-(. Was forced to have one of these at a German restaurant after downing its big brother first. I should have done it in the reverse order. Appearance is what what you would expect of a hefe, hazy luminous straw yellow with a nice fluffy white head. Smell was very much attenuated in comparison to real beer, although the bread, banana, clove combination was in evidence. Same goes for the taste, but slight latex and metalic notes where evident. Palate was a little watery and heavily carbonated. Damned good attempt at a LA beer, but beer without alcohol is just not beer.","hefevice","0"
