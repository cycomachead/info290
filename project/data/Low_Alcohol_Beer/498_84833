1.5,-39.5,,,,,,"Having said that, Bavaria 0.0% is perhaps *the* most heinous NA beer I've encountered. Sweet and corny and metallic and sour and just tremendously unpleasant in every way I can think of.","headlessparrot","Jul 06, 2014"

2.83,14.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Well, not really all that offensive, given the lack of the one true ingredient that might give one cause for giving a shit about this offering. It guess the straight-up graininess, without the gag-worthy sweet booziness (the usual Bavaria trademark) shows how things really could be, given a more deft hand at the controls.","biboergosum","Aug 27, 2012"
2,-19.4,1.5,1.5,2.5,1.5,2,"Bavaria Regular 0.0% is not the worst Low-Alcohol beer out there. But neither is it in the same league as what I consider good ""near-beers."" It has an appetizing list of ingredients, but turns out to be unbalanced and far too sweet. Give it a try, but don't buy a six-pack.","GMB","Beers"
2.16,-12.9,3,2,2,2,2.5,"Blech! Not good - if I needed to stay off the booze I'd drink something else. This is horrid; sweet cooked grain and off-notes. Flavour and aroma-wise it barely resembles beer. The watery body doesn't add anything. Imagine a macro lager, then subtract what little substance remains. Voila - you have Bavaria 0.0%! Avoid at all costs.","jazzyjeff13","0"
