3.03,23.2,3.5,3,3,2,3.5,"As a recovering alcoholic it's tough to get a decent NA beer in my area.  I had the displeasure of having Clausthaler previously and almost quit searching for other NA beers.  Kaliber, unlike Clausthaler does not have that super disgusting metallic bitter finishing after taste.  More so, Kaliber is kind of sweet to a degree with the malty yeast, almost honey notes on the forefront of the taste.  Mouth feel is flat and liquid, but just having a NA beer that doesn't taste like your back yard fence is an achievement in itself.  I drank it straight from the bottle ice cold like it suggested.  I'll gladly continue drinking Kaliber until I can find one of those tastier NA hefes, wits, or IPAs.","Every1sgrudge","Dec 31, 2014"

3.38,37.4,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/13/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers, Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of cracker, toast, biscuit, caramel, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, toast, cereal, caramel, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of cracker, toast, cereal, herbal, and grass on the finish for a very short bit. Okay flavor balance and robustness of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a dry finish and zero lingering flavors. Pretty bland/watery on flavors but not horrible. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and dry mouthfeel that is good. Overall this is a pretty solid low alcohol beer. Solid balance and robustness of bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. Considering the style, this was pleasant and quite enjoyable.","superspak","Oct 01, 2014"

Actually didn't know this was a 'Near Beer' brew like O'Dell's as I have never seen it before and was sold in another section.

This guy pours a clear pale golden straw with about a finger of thick, though short-lived, large-bubbly froth on top. Things look "like a normal beer", as my BMC-drinking friends would say, so things aren't goin' too bad so far. The smell is overtly sweet, like corn syrup combined with maple syrup and cane sugar. A weak hint of puffed rice meekly tries to move its way up, but is hampered by the hordes of sweetness. Hmm. This sweetness does not follow into the taste too much, though some of the corn syrup does drip down there. Instead, a very watery though overarchingly mild bitterness reigns, though a tinny, hard water taste eventually owns the court. To simplify: Imagine a cold Coors Light, then water it down (even further). That's what this tastes like. Needless to say, I'm not a fan. The body is nice and light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a very watery feel.

The flavors were dry at first and the yeast was distinctly similar to Guinness . Then it got sweeter with the cereal grains, a hint of toasted malt and a rather European taste like salt water taffy.

The only other NA beer I've tried to date is Odouls; where Odouls is very similar to many light macro lagers (but fairly lacking in flavor), Kaliber has much more flavor but it's less "beerish" and more "fresh wort". All in all, not too bad for what it is.","BedetheVenerable","Mar 17, 2009"

Overall though the thin body and watery texture keeps this from being a great NA...decent...not bad....a nice change up if you don't want the alcohol but I'd much prefer the Beck's NA which is actually very good.","ZAP","Feb 07, 2009"

2.14,-13,3.5,2,2,2.5,2,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep caramel copper with a 2 inch white head that left no lacing as the beer recedes. The aroma is pretty vacant from the beer. There is just a slight caramel note if you really focus. This beer is pretty void for flavor also. Slight toffee notes with a club soda flavor intermingled. The mouthfeel is dry and unassuming. This is probably one of the better beers for a NA but give me the booze. I think that the process of extracting the alcohol really took a lot out of the beer. Judging by the color, I actually thought I was in for a treat.","hwwty4","Dec 08, 2008"

Light brownish amber. Smells like Wasa crackers, very crackery with rye and pumpernickel aromas. Dry malt. Light tasting with some grainy sourness, more of the crackery flavor and some mouthcoating sweetness at the end that is a bit cloying.

In a word: gross.","dewalt","Jun 28, 2008"

Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops present and light as one would expect, quite dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew for its type. Do to a recent recurring, medical problem, It satisfies my taste for beer, not the alcohol, I just like the taste, besides how much water and Gatorade can one person take? lol","Gusler","Oct 16, 2007"

The appearance is actually surprisingly pretty good with a orange/amber color with a nice creamy white head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is decent as well and a little better than expected with some malt and dark bread. The taste is pretty faint and watery with just a touch of malt. The mouthfeel is the one trait that really detracts from the brew as it is thin and fizzy like a soda. Overall, this is a beer that is decent for what it is but really lacking in the flavor department. I poured my bottle into a glass, but I think this beer actually may be a little better straight out of the bottle.","cjgator3","Aug 26, 2007"

Color is a deep golden brown, so it at least looks like real beer. Flavor, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It scarcely tastes like beer - the flavor is thin and, though not nasty, barely mediocre. It feels watery, like a "light" beer. An "A" for effort, but unfortunately somehow the brewers removed the taste along with the alcohol.","Cyberkedi","Jul 03, 2007"

There is plenty in the nose, unfortunately somewhat more than in the taste. There are smells of honey, nuts, substantial malts, with a bit of a grassy odor. The taste is very bready and grassy. There are no hope to speak of. This brew tastes kind of like wort smells, very malty and light. Tastes more like a beer themed refreshment than an actual beer. The mouthfeel is light and crisp.

But I must admit, it does look a bit like an ale, and there's a slight ale smell, so points there. Taste is still weak and watery, but there are the remains of a slightly malty ale taste here, even a slightly floral hop note.

I think that if you can drink this style beer, then you are a true beer lover. It's about enjoying the beer and not drinking to get drunk. Anyways, i was really impressed with the taste. It had a subtle citrus taste going on with the presence of malts. Looking at some other reviews leads me to believe I may have gotten a good batch of the stuff. Sure, it's no highly ranked beer, but it definately has it's pluses. The smell was simialr to most beers of the kind, but had most substance than most NA brews. Just like the taste, there was the presence of malts and citrus, but also had the element of some floralness.

Dry, tealeaf palate, malt is scantly discernible and there is little hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is not too light or thin, which is a plus, moderate carbonation. The finish is curt, slightly leafy and malty. Very refreshing, something Id recommend for those who cannot drink alcohol. Frankly, this brew is closer to iced tea than beer, I guess, at times, that could be a good thing. This was a one-time drink for me.","bditty187","Jan 29, 2003"
