"Overall: This is easily the best low alcohol beer I have had, I just wish the mouthfeel was a little better.  3.75"

"Overall: Excellent for a low ABV, but a little disappointing once you notice that there's no body to back up the strong hops. Still, this is a brave attempt at making a tasty low ABV brew, and certainly the first one I've ever tried that has anything close to real hop flavour. An added bonus is that the beer isn't too sweet, which is a major flaw of many low ABV beers. This will certainly be a regular low ABV beer for me, although the cost is rather high compared to some of the competition (at least in Finland)."

"This brew is highly underrated. It should define a new category @ 0.5% ABV and needs to be scored respective of that. Pours a solid brown with lots of chunky lacing - where it lacks is on head and liveliness but otherwise looks great. Nose is hoppy and I'd be fooled blind. Taste's great for next to no alcohol. Great brew and thanks for making this (and for opening a Brewdog pub in London)."

"Sorry that was my first and last Nanny State."
"I am afraid it was quite watery given the very low alcohol. Some malt presence would help as well. Interesting as an experience and good alternative to beer juice drinkers (non-alcoholic)."
"This was pretty impressive, the beer poured out as a nice looking copper color with a foamy white head on top. The lacing is really good on this, very sticky and maintains a great retention. The smell has a nice aroma of malts and hops. The taste of the beer is malty and hoppy also. The flavors are quite nice for a beer with a low ABV. The mouthfeel is drinkable. Overall the beer is good, I would easily say this is the best low ABV beer I've ever had."

"O: I like weird experiments like this in the beer world, drinking this will never let you take for granted the role malt plays even in the most unbalanced of West Coast IPAs. For low alcohol beer though, this kicks the crap out of O'Douls."
"Not all experiments turn out for the best, but I must say I did like Nanny State...the beer, not the group of people made of ignorant control freaks. If I needed to quit drinking, this would be a great step to get there...or would it?"

"Well - it's a good stab at a low alcohol beer. It will end up damned with faint praise, but I doubt there's another low-ABV brew out there with so much hop character. It looks great and smells nice, but falls down hard with the flavour and mouthfeel. Bonus points for effort - alcohol-free beer doesn't get much attention over here. Worth trying once."
"overall: Probably the most drinkable N/A beer I ever tasted and definitely more enjoyable to drink than a generic watery alcohol containing lager. Would not feel ashamed in bringing this to a party or event. Keep up the good work BD!"
"Yes officer I have been drinking tonight as a matter a fact I have a fuck of a lot to drink tonight, I think 12 beers but I can't remember. Yes I will take a Breathalyzer and a blood test. Yes my breath does smell like hops. No your machines aren't broken, I forgot to mention the beers I was drinking are 0.5% alcohol by volume."
"Notes: Polemic aside it is actually a rather quaffable brew, full of hoppy flavor, so it is not for all palates, but it has a fun edge to it. I would not mind to have a few of these around. Funny how well I´m told this is selling in some places for people looking for the hops without the alcohol..."
"I am very grateful that it was available by the bottle at the new BrewDog bar in Edinburgh in the Cowgait."
"I would be very interested to know what the IBU count on this beer is. Probably not too high, but it seems very bitter thanks to there being bugger all malt for balance."
"Not a bad shot at a very low ABV boy but I won't go again."
"This beer is evidence that a sense of humour and clever marketing do not equal good beer. Under the circumstances, this is a pretty good brew; but this is the same as saying ""That girl's a pretty good ballet dancer, considering she hasn't got any legs."""
"O: This is my second Nanny State, and I can say that drinking from the bottle may ameliorate/hide the taste, but precludes this beer's best feature: the smell. Still, it has redeeming features (and it's low ABV can even be considered a virtue in some situations) and I would have another if the circumstance warranted. Very nice with spicy food. Only recommended for novelty value."
"This would work for the days you really want hops, but not alcohol, but compared to other IPA's, this does not make it."
"A really interesting beer and something completely out of the ordinary. A tasty beer and well worth trying even if only for the novelty."
"Interesting experiment."
"330 ml bottle, batch 189, best before 7/21/2011. Not sure how fresh this is, but I'll drink it anyway. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is grassy and a bit of citrusy (grapefruit) hops, and some bready malt. Unfortunately the taste isn't as nice as the aroma. It tastes like bitter grassy hops, but not much else. The bitterness isn't exactly nice, but for a beer that has just 0.5% ABV, at least it does have some taste to it. Moutheel/body is light/medium, it's a little bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. It was nice to try this brew, and would try it again if I had a chance to."
"I like the creativity here from Brewdog, but not a beer I would want to have more than once."
"Well, if you want a near-zero ABV, and want hops, this is probably as good as it gets. That does not mean it's good!"
"But...in terms of the beer I really expected nothing at all. Having heard the stramash a year ago about the immature reaction in releasing this beer and the fact that this was a toned down version I expected something totally forgettable. But it was a real surprise. A thin rust brown colour this beer impressed with its hop presence and gave the impression of being a much stronger beer. I will need to give Nanny State another go as I'm judging not just on memory notes but on two separate 2 oz samples as though I was ticking for Scotland. And that just won't do. Still, from my meagre 4 ozs this was very good for what it is.Just wish I tried the original 1.1% 200IBUs when it was avaialable. As a dare of course."
"Unbalanced. Pretty weird. Pretty fun."
"This review considers the 0,5% ABV version. I like the appearance of it, aswell as the smell. Think hop juice, lots of tropical fruits, citrus, even a hint of licorice. The fun ends here. The taste i PURE hops, a light bitter liquid that leave a long aftertaste. Thats it really. I think it needs a bigger body and a bit more malt to be enjoyable. But it's certainly very interesting for a beer with 0,5% alcohol in it."
"Rusty brick red with an amazing head, the kind that rises an inch above the rim of the glass and retains very well. There is a lovely full-on IPA nose with pine, lemon, lemongrass, pineapple, and orange blossom syrup, and a wholewheat bread aroma. I get some lemon as well. The flavor echoes the aroma, but the mouthfeel isn't quite up to scratch - weirdly thin and watery, which does no favors to the toasty, nutty, tea-like, and hoppy notes that are all individually assertive but harmonious and balanced in tandem, like a good jazz band. Defanged brandy, red and black tea, toast, and citrus are key flavors. I must say, the body here is generally too thin, but that doesn't stop it from being an excellent beer and a perfectly drinkable quaffer."
"Mouthfeel is as expected quite watery and just a little bit creamier than carbonated mineral water."
"D: I had it yesterday with some friends and one of them called it ""hoppy water"" - I can't find any other way to describe it..."
"Besides the fact that it looks great, it's got a bold nose, lots of great flavor, and a very nice creamy mouthfeel. The only real beef I have is that it is a little astringent on the finish, but that is also a product of its bitterness. This brew may not be as big and bad as some other IPAs, be as ""balanced"" as some, or have the flavors that the alcohol contributes, but as an attempt at ""reverse extreme brewing," for lack of a better term, this one is sure worth the effort. One of the better BrewDog achievements so far. Recommended."
"notes, nice option and nice to see a low ABV beer that tastes good, I know many people at pré ZBF, March 2010, were rather impressed with it. I had tried it initially out of mere curiosity, i was pleasantly surprised"
"As unbalanced as one can expect from a beer of 1.1% ABV and a said bitterness of 225 IBU."
"Fizzy, but not like a soda. Actually not too hard to drink, but really not something to get excited about. By far my least favourite BrewDog beer."
"Even if I judge this for what it is, it's still bad. The flavor lacks any positive characteristics. If poking at the government becomes more important than brewing good beer, it's no surprise that the quality suffers. This must be a joke, and I don't find it funny."
"Drinkability: I really don't like this at all. I'm a massive BrewDog fan but I think this is just a publicity stunt too far, it's about ""great tasting beer"" guys, remember? A brave concept or a pointless publicity stunt, either way, it's not a good beer."
"Overall - A pretty good experiment and definitely not as undrinkable as some people have stated... worth a try..."
