"Light yellow with etched surface bubbles. Smells like sweet grains, bread, a little hint of peppercorn. Kinda reminds me of the smell of a nice dry salami paper. Taste is cleanly grain, some wheat bread, some white grape juice, a little sweeter than I'd prefer. Touch of herbal hops and a little bitterness. Light bodied with soft for the style, albeit hi carb and a slightly dry finish. Not bad, a little sweet and reminiscent of cheap wheat bread, but hey, good enough."
"Very nice low alcohol beer, far better than everything else low alcohol that I have tasted."
"o: very good for what it is. it could easily pass as a decent Euro pale lager."

"Aroma is of bitter hops and biscuity.Tastes of bitter hops and malty sweet, but not very balanced. Bitter aftertaste.Fizzy because the carbonation is strong. For being an alcohol-free it is pretty good!"
"O: This is actually not a bad beer. For being an alcohol-free quite nice."
"This stuff will actually do in a pinch, although more enjoyable straight out of the bottle. At least it provided me a bit of a hop fix in the mean time. I'd pin it as someplace around German Pils territory style-wise."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable for what it is. The last time I had tried a non-alcoholic beer was about 10 years ago and I hadn’t manage to finish it off. I don't plan on making friends here but this one’s much better."
"Overall: The metallic bite is just too much. This is a drain-pour. Even my burps are metallic. Never again."
"Dr: If this type of beer is your bag, have at it, but leave me out of it. I won't have it again."
"An acceptable alternative to stronger beers, although more hops would probably improve it."
"Not my cup of tea but not too bad for low alcohol brew."
"widely refreshing. Final very weak"
"Edit: Scores adjusted slightly. After having tested a couple of these cans I must admit I'm a little less positive..."
"M & D : I couldn't finish a 330 ml can."
"It feels a bit more drinkable than others of the style that I've had. Then again, it's no gem and I'd still recommend that you avoid it."
"If you need to do an NA for some reason, this is definitely a top contender in that category."
"There are some drinkable German alcohol free beers out there but this ain't one of them."
"I always seem to see this one when I am in the Middle East. All in all it is not a bad near beer. It has a good straw yellow color. The carbonation is good. It has bubbles throughout the body with a nice head and lace. The aroma and taste are very pilsner like. Sweet and malty earthy and just a little bit of crisp and clean fruit tones. It is light and refreshing and not bad on a desert night."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full."
"Poured with a short bright white head that left a small wall of lace. A few streams of bubbles rise around the edge of the transparent sunshine colored beer. Spicy hops in the aroma are joined by a sweetness that is more artificial sugar then malt based. This seems to be typical for alcohol free Pils-ish beers. Wow, the body is awesome on this one. Moderately full with an infusion of fine carbonation. A bitter grassyness pervades the flavor, but there is again an underlying sweetness. Some of the sweet flavor comes off as pale malt in the middle of the beer, but towards the finish it becomes increasingly artificial/corny. After a few sips the finish resembles more unfermented malt then anything else (not that this isn't fully fermented, it just tastes like wort). If they could just tone down the sweetness this would pass for a good Pilsner or Helles."
