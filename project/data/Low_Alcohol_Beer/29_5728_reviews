"For what it is, it is tolerable."
"Drank as a joke... Tastes like dirty water."
"Pours to a generous white head and light amber color.  Aroma is weak caramel malt and a hint of hops. Flavor is a watered down but not unpleasant sweet malt and touch of hops and a nice seltzer finish. These NAs are not going to taste like real beer because alcohol is the glue that holds all the flavors together. But this is pretty damn close."
"Overall: I have tried four NA beers now as I vowed to abstain from regular alcohol, and this one is my favorite thus far.  Clausthaler is too bitter and metallic, Kaliber is way to sweet and funky, Coors NA tastes just like Coors, and this tastes like a soft nut brown ale with cream soda.  It's not too sweet, but sweeter than normal beer with enough malt to remind you this isn't soda."

"If my choices were the same again (Bud, Bud Light or O'Doul's Amber), I'd probably opt for a water fountain.  But if I HAD to have a ""beer"" from those choices, this would be the one."

"Not horrible. Enough said."

"Can."

"O: This beer doesn't have the chemical or ""off"" flavors you would normally expect from a low alcohol beer, but seems to taste more like a malty version of a cream soda compared to a beer."

"Got a single bottle on a lark. Wow, not twist off! Amber in color as advertised with big 'ol bubbles in the clear body. That's not barley I smell, is it? Sweet, bland grain. No hop presence. Smells challenging. Tastes less offensive than it smells, so I'd actually recommend swigging this from the bottle (wait, don't). Still, just a faint reminder of beer with mild hints of honey. Sweet is the prominent flavor, finishing with weird bitterness. This would be my first drainpour if I weren't such a glutton for punishment. I'm doing this dammit, but never again."
"This comes out more like a caramel soda than a beer. Even for NA brew, it really doesn't offer much, and it's just way too sweet for my tastes."

"O: Not much going on here with this beer - very light aromas and flavors along with a somewhat watery body."
""

""
""
"Overall- Pretty on par with BMC when it comes to the nose and taste. Nice body, but a failure in overall appearance. Mouthfeel is just a failure. Drinkability is pointless. Because of all this, it is beneath BMC overall. Poor beer. The only reason to try this is if you are a ticker. And I am. I can go back to regular beer now- this style designation has been had and reviewed."
""

""
"O - Bearing in mind the style, it's the best sample of the style I've tried, but it's certainly not something many would enjoy. If I'm the DD I'll drink this for fun, but apart from that I'd pass."
"Really? I've gotten to this level of ticking? I'm ashamed of myself, I'm about to drink a big BB aged stout I swear"

"Overall, I'm glad this was a ""gift"" (after I gifted this person a Rochefort 10)."

"It's amber, brilliant clarity and looks still after the quick dissipation of loose light cream foam. Smells sweet with some beefy character and a little tea quality. Taste is metallic with oxidized grains and some oversteeped red tea. Thin bodied with low carb and a astringently abrasive finish. No likey."
"Meh, who needs alcohol? This stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises warm, lightly-buttered bread. Yup, that's it. I know, I'm kinda surprised, too. The taste is grainier, like less polished bread, with a touch of vague fruitiness tossed in for apparently good measure. Then everything is watered down. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I'm not sure why they bothered to take out the alcohol here, except to save the company from being derided for releasing a really crappy beer that may actually be able to eventually get you drunk. This stuff, on the other hand, is purposeless."
""
""
"The odd metallic notes ruined any chance for this one. There's a nice attempt at a malt presence, but its sweet and there are no hops for balance. This was only $.89 for a single. I bought it for this review. I won't be buying another one."

"O: A little flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a fairly decent beer for the style."
""
""
"Worth a try, let this be a lesson why alcoholism should be avoided at all costs."
"Overall: It's not bad for a low alcohol beer. I've had a few, and none of them are great of course, but they can be drinkable at least. This one is about average."
"O: An adequate example for the non-alcohol drinker though is a touch to sweet to indulge in multiples. A clean brew, a bit light and watery at times but is to be expected per non-alcohol styles. Better then anticipated but certainly not a substitute."

"Thin, watery, not much carbonation. Just an abomination. How does anybody drink this as anything but morbid curiosity?"
"Overall this is one of the better LABs. I prefer it out of the bottle versus a glass. And this may be crazy, but it's better as it warms a little. If you like beer but not alcohol (or if you like alcohol too much) this is a very good better. Next to Clausthaler, this may be the best."
"Wow, the Crack was literally explosive on this gem! Man, I had liquid foaming everywhere and fortunately a decanting glass was ready-to-hand. The overly-fast Glug produced a finger-and-a-half of tawny head with not only decent retention, but the lacing was both quick to appear and very pretty. The color was a coppery, reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a unique quality, like roasting peanuts or chestnuts. It had a roasted malt quality not generally found in an Amber, but usually in a darker beer. Mouthfeel was actually ending to full and the taste was very malty, which is not my bag, but on the other hand, it was more tasty than other LABs in my memory. Finish was biscuity and frankly reminiscent of Fat Tire. I know that I will be dunned for saying so, but this was a fairly worthwhile beer for the style. I would definitely use some cooler space for my N.A./LAB friends and maybe even for me to take the edge off."
"It's an amber-red in color trying to replicate the Irish Red style, pours a decent but short lived white fizzy head,taste is crisp clean and better than most so called ""light"" beers. Good for when you've had enough of the real thing, but you have to stay til closing time!"
" The taste is better than I expected based on previous reviews and having sampled the Premium O'doul's recently. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the malt with some toasted and bready malt flavors which have a slight accent of caramel malt which gives a mild nuttiness as it finishes. I am not a fan of NA beers but if I had to choose this is the one that best emulates a regular beer so I consider it pretty good based on the style. It has a malt flavor which is more than most have to offer."
"I probably enjoyed this more than I should have, but when reviewing the wasteland of non-alcoholic beers, I have to place this one near the top of the list."
"From a 12 oz bottle with no visible freshness date into a pint glass. Dark-orange clear color with minor carbonation streams. Thin fizzy head that fades quickly leaving a tiny ring and no lace. Nose of malt, diacetyl, and buttery toast. Taste is all malty with little else other than perhaps tap water. Slightly bitter finish. Mouth is thin and watery with no carbonation evident. Overall: While it looks OK initially, this beer devolves into what amounts to a glass of brownish malt-flavored water. Might be more tolerable when swigged out of a bottle."
"This beer should just advertise itself as a kvass for the American palate. Sweet and carbonated, lightly caramely. Can i pick out many identifiers that would make me believe that this is a beer? Not really, if I couldn't drink beer anymore, I wouldn't drink this, this is no substitute for even a macro lager. Tastes fake and on e dimensional."
"Overall- Not a beer I will ever buy. I simply can't get passed the fact that it has no alcohol. Other than that it is very pain and one dimensional. I did not finish the 12oz bottle. 1/5"
"Overall: Not too bad but the watery malt gets old and this beer just doesn't cut it."
"Overall- Have to be honest, this is my first N/A beer and it wasn't bad at all! To tell you the truth, I enjoyed it! Not sure when I'll be having again but will definitely say this is an easy drinking and refreshing Low-Alcohol Beer!"
"Overall: Well, it is actually better than the lightest of the light beers. Not much else I can say."
"O (D) - Easy, unenjoyable"
"This one I think is better than the Lager version they make. Just just a little bit more to it. I suppose it's just the difference in using the roasted malts over a lighter kind. What else can be said about this brew. It's at least got a nice color to it."
"Poured into a lost abbey sinners glass. a pretty reddish amber with a good amount of white head. The head dissipates quickly but leave a bit of lacing on the glass. Honestly, not bad looking. There is almost no aroma though, some sweet malts but nothing else going on. A few sips of the sweet maltiness are quite enough for me. Its not awful... honestly, its way better than I was expecting... but its certainly not good... Decent mouthfeel and overall, better than I was expecting"
"Pours a clean/clear amber color, some carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is sweet, malty, and grainy. The taste is sweet, malty, not much going on here. Light Body. Not Drinkable, a drain pour."
"It looks and smells pretty good, but the body is, of course, very thin with nary a hint of mouthfeel. At least it's drinkable."
"I get the close-to-nil-alcohol idea for beer, but why the taste and body has to suffer so much, I have to wonder, and another thing - this thing still has 90 calories? Cripes. I can't believe that I'm suggesting that one should opt for a Coors Light or Michelob Ultra in its place."
"Poured a dull straw yellow with a big white fizzy head. Lots of visible carbonation, but the fizzy yellow water type, no lace. The smell was very faint, if there at all. What I could pick up was maybe a hay, or wheat smell. Again very very faint, and hardly there at all. The taste was very light and non descript, but that is about what one would expect from a light lager. A light grain, just enough of a taste to know I was not drinking water would be the best way to describe it. Decent feel, again just the cold well carbonated. Crisp, and a clean finish, no aftertaste. Overall this was totally forgettable, as I imagined it would be."
"D: Well there is simply nothing horrible about this beer but nothing good either. This will be my first and last NA beer for sure."
"D: This is my first nonalcoholic beer, but I've actually had alcoholic beers that taste worse than this. Still, this is by no means something I would like to drink again."
"Pours a medium amber color without head or lacing. Nose brings forth some light grain. Somewhat of a grain husk nose. Taste confirms this with some general bread flavors. Feel is light with too much carbonation. Drinks much like the overall experience--in an unimpressive manner."
"Conclusion: I have had ultra-low ABV beers before that were actually pretty good. This 'beer' is sad. enough said. On to better things."
"There isn't anything here that would make me want to buy it again, but for anyone who is in search of a good NA beer, this one has to be at least a decent place to start."
"Mouthfeel indicates that the beer is much thinner than its appearance. Becomes watery, loses any wood and malt feel it had. No hops at any point. Can't stand to finish even one, and can't believe the price of this."
"D: I suppose there is a point for some to drink non-alcoholic beer, but I just don't see it. I'd rather drink a soda if I wanted some empty calories, because at least that tastes good."
"D- Overall, I would recommend avoiding this one. The regular O'Doul's is much more palatable compared to the Amber."
"D - I guess if you're forced to drink a NA beer, this may be a good one. I'm not one that is willing to sacrifice taste just to pretend to drink a beer though. I would rather drink water or soda if I'm a DD."
"Oh man, this is awful stuff. Sourish minerals all across the tongue with notes of over-cooked frozen vegetables. Like bad mineral water...no traces of the label-touted ""Two-row and specialty caramel malts"" or hops of any sort. Body is not as thin as one might think for a 0.5% ABV, and has some decent creaminess to the carbonation, but the off-flavors and sour crispness are equal parts distracting and disgusting. My excuses? I guess I was curious, and the price was right. After all, this is my first Low Alcohol Beer review. Never again though...I learned my lesson."
" ~ The label reads, ""Rich & Flavorful"" but I beg to differ."
"(A little ashamed I'm praising an A-B product, but, hey, it is what it is. And it ain't bad, for that.)"
"Drinkability: This wasn't absolutely horrible or offensive, but with these Low Alcohol Beers, I just have to ask myself: What's the point?"
"D: One was enough. Yeah, I ticked the style, waddya want me to say? I'd prefer my beer with booze in it."
"Have a few cans of this left over from a friend. Poured into a glass this is a light amber color with a cream colored head that was here, then gone! The aroma was mild with some hints of malt. The taste was very metallic and watery at the same time. There was not much taste of malt and maybe a syrupy sweetness that was out right gross. NA is not for me!"
"Definitely not as bad as the rap it gets here. I wonder if you can legally drink it while driving?"
"Avoid unless you absolutely must drink a n/a beer. It has a bit more flavor than some n/a beers but not enough."
"Homever i can't give a good calification to a non-alcoholic beer."
"Not quite the worst thing, but generally quite unpleasant."
"Dr: Actually tasted pretty okay at first, but by the time I finished, not so much. I can drink a beer (kind of) without screwing up the numbers in Turbo Tax. I'll have another when I forget how the first one tasted."
"I think it's jes fine!"
"drinkability: light bodied, not so unpleasant...this is fairly drinkable. 2 problems: 1) too expensive to justify, and 2) who the hell would drink this in large quantities, unless you were on a post-atkins carb-binge??"
"D: And this is different from regular O'Doul's because? I stand by my initial statement. Passable, but not worth a revisit."
"I think this is O'Douls with a bit of red food coloring. It pours amber and has a short lived fizzy head. The body is light and again a bit fizzy. Not much flavor here. Just some light grains. The nose is like old cut grass. I don't think I'll be having this again, actually I'm sure of it."
"The drinkability is fairly low. Sure at .5% ABV it's ""sessionable' (haha), but it's just not enticing to drink."
"Awful. Purely awful."
"I thought I'd try this style just to see if it was worth the while. I'm glad I did, now I know to stick with regular beer or to get a coke."
"D: I get that this is a non-alcoholic beer, but when it repeatedly claims to be 'rich and flavorful' I expected much more. This has always been one of those creations I just don't get; it's similar to decaf coffee in the way it attempts to alter a beverage's 'bad' traits to make it accessible to someone who might not be able to enjoy it otherwise. Frankly, it comes off as a poor representation of any style (let alone an 'Amber') and, hence, has low drinkability for me. Glad, I suppose, to have tried this but I'd pass if offered another - even for free."
"I feel that nearly everyone who rates a NA has no clue, no one seems to realize the difference between a regular beer and a beer brewed specifically to be alcohol free (or close to it)... I sometimes have to drink NA's due to driving so i actually try to enjoy them and more so, appreciate them for what they offer... Now that I have that semi rant over...Pours a medium brown colour with a low- medium head, smell is of older malts and a strange maple syrup hybrid... taste is kinda pleasant, similar to Shiner Bock but not as off putting... a surprise actually, better than most imported NA beers and easily one of the more drinkable American NA beers! ..regular o'douls might be crap, but this at least has some hope!"
"Pours a dark copper color with thin lace of head that doesn't dissipate completely. Smells like a macro lager except with a little more malty aroma. The taste is quite surprising. I have to give it a five because even though it doesn't have as much flavor as a beer with normal level of alcohol, you can't get more flavor out of a low alcohol beer than this. It's malty and has a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is high carbonated and crisp. I would give this a higher drinkability rating, but you obvious can't get any buzz out of this."
"D - If you really need to avoid alcohol, then I guess this isn't terrible, but your better off just drinking half of a real beer."
"Had this at a neighbor's house when nothing else was available. Figured it would be interesting. I have had a number of these 0.5% ""beers"" and some I like fine once you get over the fact that they are never much like any real beer. I call them by the old fashioned term, cereal beverage. Anway, this one looked pretty good with a fairly dark golden brown color, a big frothy white head and even a bit of lacing on my mug. The aroma was OK too, a bit of brown sugar and wheat, clean. But the taste was far below some of the imported ones I have generally liked, like Haake Beck, St. Pauli's and Clausthaler. The immediate impression is with how thin and weak flavored this feels and tastes. It is well carbonated, very sprite and as a result can be called a refreshing drink perhaps, but the flavor implied by the aroma is quickly lost in a peppery and watery drink that has a metallic overtone It's very thin and just a hint of some wheat here. I thought the Amber might hold some promise but don't bother with this when there are much better choices for the no/low alcohol options. Sure you could drink plenty of these like any other of it's kind but why would you? Handy in the desert I suppose..."
"D: Since it is so low in alcohol, it can be drunk just like water, I had no problems drinking it, I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be revisiting this one."
"overall this isnt a bad example of a low alcohol beer"
"I'm actually impressed! Well done, and cheers to Anheuser-Busch for making a N/A beer that can be found in almost any bar in the world. There are a lot of temporarily (and non-temporarily) dry folks out there who still like to have a beer or two."
"Drinkability - I felt like a dork buying this. While this is better than O'Doul's regular, it's certainly not good. Possibly one of the better beers in its category, but the category is rather uninspired."
"In exploring the world of NA beers, I've found very few beers that satisfied me. This one is a step up from the lifeless regular O'Doul's, but not a very big step. The medium-dark amber color is a pleasant greeting, but it's all downhill from there. The fizzy off-white head quickly disipates, the smell is faint, grainy and a little metallic with absolutely no hops, the flavor is bland with a caramel sweetness that is at first not too shabby but quickly gets old on the tastebuds, and the worst is the mouthfeel. Just lifeless. Not worth getting again."
"Bottle from loblaws- Pours transparent amber,and a short lived, off white head. Zero lace. The aromas are faint, and it smells like other NA beers. Pretty cardboard-ey, but perhaps due to the amber designation, they did use some decent malting here, which is detectable in the aroma. Caramel and toffee nuances as well. Flavour is bland, mild sweet malt with some paper/pepper/fillers. Spritzy finish, completely forgettable. But its the official NA beer of the PGA."
"Thanks for the bottle Len... it's probably not something I'd ever buy!"
"O'Doul's Amber wins NA Shootout (With Blanks) II by a mile and wins it, essentially, by default. Like a politician who refuses to state his positions prior to an election so as to not offend potential voters, Amber doesn't provide much of any flavor so as to be palatable to those brave souls who are forced to drink it. No one gladly drinks this stuff, do they?"
"If you're the designated driver, or you find yourself in a situation in which you want a NA, I suggest picking the regular O'Doul's. It's not really good, but better than this. They tried something different that just doesn't work. Scores based on NA standards (and still low, even for style.)"
"Thin and bland. Eh."
"Just like every other low alcohol beer I've had, this isn't very appealing. I would have to say that I prefer it to the Molson and Labatt offerings though."
"drinkability was average but seeing as I'm a big time moocher, and seeing as it's what my friends have, i will most likely be having another very soon."
"Meh. Not entirely terrible."
"An above average representative of the style. Makes a nice substitute for the real thing when the need arises."
"Other than that, don't go for it."
"Poured a medium-amber color with initial white puffy head that was quickly gone. Smell is mostly a sweetness that is not especialyl enjoyable. Taste is sweet and malty, with typical low-alcohol notes. Finished with a not pleasant aftertaste. There are acceptable NA's out there, but this is not one of them."
"---"
"Sweet, and fake tasting. The hops that were barely there in the nose are completely gone. Light and fluffy. Drain pour."
"I wanted to pick up a six pack but I remembered I had to work in the early morning so I got some low alcoholic beer. This beer poors a brown/red hue with a small, but stoic, frothy head. The taste is pretty okay. Slightly sweet caramel malts, but not very hoppy. It is smooth but it doesn't exactly sit down. The most negative parts of this beer include the smell and mouthfeel. The smell is pretty bland, not giving any info on the beer itself and the mouthfeel seems watered down after witnessing the color of the beer. Typical of an AB product. On the whole it is probably the best AB product out there in my opinion that I have tried so far."
"IT was not very different from the O'Douls one, but was a little more dissapointed with the flavor, is alittle heavier, and it makes it a little more annoying, perhaps. The colour is more green than ambar, but anyway, it is yellow after all. The aroma is proper for a beer like this, and maybe with some limes would be better."
"Like the beers of anheuser busch, had an abuse of adjoincts in rice an other grains; poor in taste and mouthfeel, no comments inappearance, taste and drinkability, smell a little hops and malt, rice and corn; recommended if case on american food no try this beer with mexican, its flavor not go with powerful taste of this food."
"An attractive copper-amber color, with a nice effervescence makes this NA look appealing. Unfortunately, the head is fleeting at best. Smell of cereal grains seemed a little more pronounced that some alcoholic AB brews. Mouthfeel is light and empty, but about what is expected for the style. Almost no hops anywhere in the beer, save for a trace at the finish. This is a simple, unoffending, average NA beer. Id drink it over water or soda, but thats about it."
"Blah!! No good, and a poor substitute for real beer. If you must drink a NA for whatever reason, DO NOT make it this one."
"Summary: I thought this would be good at first, but after two, it's not a beer I'll get again. OM NA is still the winner for me. Funny how this looks better rated that some of the other NAs I've reviewed, I rate em like I drink em."
"drinkability: plain and simple- its not"
"Looks like a beer, pours like a beer... um, there the similarity ends. Fizzy head disappears faster than a 7up, smells like a sweetened Nestea. A halfway decent amber body for the ""style," at least, but it tastes like watered-down Malto Goya (a Mexican malt soda). I had a whole six of this I was using for cooking; only when I was down to the last bottle (and I was off beer for Lent) did I consider actually tasting it."
"Drinkable if I had to drink this, but I think I would drink a Budweiser first."
"I really thought, as far as nearbeers go, that this was a great beer. It's nothing that I would buy on a regular basis, but it's still noteworthy. I was expecting something horrid and nasty, but I got something a bit like a lighter version of Killians, but without the bite. The best thing about the beer was the awesome head I got in the beggining. The head was huge and frothy, and lasted a good little while. I would recommend this one to anyone looking to drink nonalcholic beer."
"overall- a decent nonalcoholic?!?"
"My N/A beer of choice so far"
"Very drinkable, though. Being a N/A beer, you could slam this one all night. Try it if you are in a situation where an alcoholic beer is not an option. This would be most excellent on a hot day, after some exertion. Alcoholic beers would dehydrate, but you could drop this one back almost like water."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Brew Fest:When poured into my glass, the head was small sized, ivory and contained fine sized bubbles.The body was clear with fizzy carbonation.The hue was amber and the nose was lightly malty.The flavor was lightly bitter and the mouthfeel was tingly, smooth and thin.This beer left no lacing."
"This is probably the closest you can get to beer in a non-alcoholic. Give it a whirl."
"Rather straightforward look to this brew for a macro brew, which is to say - amber, quickly exiting white head and no lace effect. The smell is of malt sweetness and this is repeated in the flavor that tends to be overly sweet with little to balance it out. The feel is thin, watery, thin, nondescript, did I mention thin? Not drinkable due to a total lack of redeeeming value."
"This is actually better than regular Budweiser."
"Bright amber colour though not much upstairs. Smells artificially sweet with some hop oil and malt sugar. The taste is even worse, sickly sweet with little hop to balance. Tastes like artificial caramel  perhaps the worst near beer I have had to date."
"Clear amber, a somewhat pretned adjunct-like head that barely has time to say goodbye. No lace. Just a slight bit of malt to the aroma, a bit of far-off ginger ale. The ginger ale theme continues into the flavor profile -- a slightly sweet and grainy mix of overcarbonation and slight acidity (not seeming to be hop generated) mix with a bare brown sugar. Misses on many beer-like qualities and its a little difficult to assess hop malt balance on this one (as in many NAs, who'ld have thunk alcohol helps here?). I won't bash it, it has better qualities and some malty huskiness not found in Michelob Ultra."
"Crystal-clear light amber color with an inch thick cloudtop head, moderate carbonation, quite good lace. Aroma consists of faint caramel and little else. Taste begins with tingling carbonation, followed by mild caramel and toasted malts, finishes dry and slightly sour. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, a fairly decent NA beer and worth a try."
"This is a premium non-alcoholic lager. Taste is dry, smooth and malty. A little bitterness is there, also. Mouthfeel is full bodied and substantial, but lacking in alcohol. I was waiting for hops that never showed up. I liked this, as far as the type goes. Too bad it is so expensive"
"The taste starts very light, metallic, a little corny. The middle is slightly cloying caramel. The finish is a little sour, coming back with somewhat skunky burps. I like this NA way more than the green O'Doul's. It's a good alternative to soda pop when alcohol is off limits."
"Rich medium amber with quick fading head and little lace.  Light to medium carbonation with quick rising malt sweetness. Slight malted flavor.  Very little hop aroma or flavor, but has slight bitter bite."
"I also found this NA ---ok. It comes in a nice looking bottle.It poors ok with a nice head that does fade-away to some but not much lace. The taste has a malty overtone, some carmal hint to it. This is a drinkable NA, I like it in the bottle while doing something else, say yardwork."
"This may be a high score for an N.A. beer, but in the world of N.A.'s, it's pretty decent.  Pours out to an amber color in the glass.  Taste is light, but there is a hint of caramel there.  I wonder what this would taste like if the alcohol was left in?  Drinkable, but not remarkable, but light years ahead of regular O'Doul's."
