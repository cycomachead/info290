"I really only tried this because I want to tried all BA styles of beer and I'm only a few short at the moment. I was surprised that I didn't hate this. It is a little bit too sweet but is far superior to the regular Labatt Blue. I could actually drink this which is not something I can say for the original, but maybe the original needs a revisit."

"I feel like I'm rating a little high, but for the style of beer (NA), it's a fine product."
"This is my first non-alcoholic ""beer"" so I'm not really sure if this is good or bad in the grand scheme of things."
"Pours out a yellow hue with a thin whitehead that has high carbonation, minimal retention and no lacing. This beer I could hardly smell anything, but based on taste it is very similar to a regular LaBatt Blue with some corn, sweet malts and a hint of hops. It has a nice smooth crisp clean finish to it and is good as a substitute for people that like LaBatt Blue but don't want the alcohol in their beer, but since I prefer some alcohol I probably will drink this stuff very rarely."
"Sucks."
"super light, light beer. i dont have much expierience with the style, nor can i really understand why anyone would want to drink this. by far the lightest, most watery beer ive ever had."

"Overall this is an average NA. I saw it on the shelf and quickly checked BA, which had it at a B+. So I picked it over two other NAs that I prefer (Clausthaler and O'Douls Amber). It's a very drinkable NA. But unlike other, better NAs, you can definitely tell something is lacking."
"This brew may not be for the ""traditional"" beer drinker but for those of us who can't have the alcohol, this hits the spot."
"I poured into a pint glass to one finger of white head. It is yellow in color. It looks just like an American adjunct lager. The smell is slightly sweet but not grainy like adjuncts. The taste is almost nonexistent. It reminds me of a light beer. The finish is clean with no lingering flavors. It is pretty watered down. This is probably the last non-alcoholic beer that I will consume. I just can't see paying anything for a beer that will not self medicate me"
