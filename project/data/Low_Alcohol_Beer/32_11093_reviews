"It might also mix well with some non alcholohic cider, I have tried this with some low/no alcohol beers and it made them more palatable, darkened the color a bit, and kept the bubbles going a bit longer... it made the drink more enjoyable."

"First things first - this is a non alcoholic beer. All comments should be interpreted through this lens. Becks NA is hoppy and tasty. Though there is not much of a head, it had a great flavor and goes down smooth. I could down one if these on a hot day in about 3 seconds. I should also note that I prefer NA beer when it is Ice cold. The one I am reviewing came from the porch at 32 degrees. Yum!! Cold, smooth, delicious!!!!"

"""For when you don't wanna even approach drunkenness with your beer..."" Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises hard water, very light generic grains, and a twinge of the vaguest sense of flowers possible. The taste brings in more of the same, with the hard water leading the charge all the way. There's almost no flavor here, much less that of the ""beer"" flavor our grandparents always go on about. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a thoroughly watery feel. Overall, this doesn't seem all that much like non-alcoholic beer to me as much as it does beer-flavored water. If you wanted a Beck's without the alcohol, you'd be sorely disappointed here."
"Once again, those Germans know how to make lagers, even the kind without an ingredient that readily defines beer. Not great, but drinkable enough, if you happen to be in the unfortunate position to make this sort of thing your regular go-to."

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce green glass Euro-style long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Too chemical-ish for me. ""Euro-skunk"" and a nice appearance, and appropriate carbonation, about sums it up. Not the most ""refreshing"" NA/low alcohol beer I've had."
"Overall if you like regular Beck's and need to avoid alcohol for some reason give this a try."
"Golden with a finger plus of whites that only slowly falls to a solid sheet of the same. Really the best looking N.A. beer I've seen. Smells like many of the others: corn, grain, sweet white bread, but this one has an odd squash (butternut or pumpkin) character. Taste is corny with some sugar and a slight grain cleanliness. Medium on light with moderate carb and a fairly dry finish. Not bad, don't care for the nose here."
"I’ve enjoyed it with snack foods like popcorn, beef jerky and kettle chips, as well as sandwiches and pizza."

"Man, I suppose this COULD be skunked, but can NA beers even skunk? What would've this tasted like in 2013?? Honestly hard to keep down."
"O: Easy to drink and could be sessionable (considering the negligible amounts of alcohol but I do not really see the point). Not a style that I drink regularly but I think that all of the beers in this style seem to be rated kind of low."
"O: This beer isn’t that bad considering that it is non-alcoholic—it has some flavors of bready malts but there seems to be some leftover chemicals from the process used to remove the alcohol."
""
"Why bother?"
"This is probably an above average beer for the style, I didn't really enjoy it all that much due to the lack of flavor but it was better than I expected."

"Give me a IPA or a Oktoberfest, Stout or basically anything else. lol"

"O: Easily more drinkable than many real alcoholic light lagers. Thanks to its surprising bitterness, there are fleeting moments that might lead one to think they were drinking something else. Because of its low carbonation and lack of outright offensive qualities, it makes for a decent enough sports drink."
"Overall this was a very bad beer! Not one I'd like to ever have again."

"I tried this beer on April 5, 2011 after purchasing from a local bakery (yes - a bakery). The beer poured a translucent medium gold with a huge frothy white head. The aroma grainy malt. The mouthfeel is very watery with almost no carbonation. The flavour is weak malt, and nothing else. Could quite possibly be a heavily watered down Beck's."
"Dr: You could down it all night, but it's just be empty calories and no drunkenness. Decently priced, to its credit - even by Irish standards."
"D- If I didn't know this was non alcoholic beer, it would be hard to tell the difference IMO. Perfect for those nights where you want a brew but just want to give the liver a rest from the booze. I'll probably get this again and don't have a problem drinking this!"
"Must be very drinkable at .3%, huh? Bullshit. No way should this trangression ever be done to beer, but it has been. At least I didn't buy it. A-V-O-I-D or forever disgrace yourself."
"Good option for a non alcohol beer"
"D - if you have to stay away from alcohol but still want the flavor of a beer, this one is ok."
"Poured in a bayen-pilsener glass. Look: Golden-crystal color, very bright, the foamy head is fat but disappear in seconds. Smell: Grains and mineral water, not unpleasant. Taste: Dry malt and some grass hops, the grain from the smell disappear. Mouthfeel: Very dry, tart, high carbonation and very light body, almost nonexistent. Drinkability: Excellent beer without alcohol but not my type of beer."
"All in all, not good at all. I can only stand to drink maybe two in one sitting on a good day, however Becks is still the best of the NA selection IMHO."
"Drinkability: A horrendous beer and a poor product all around, really. Why, it's bad enough to drive one to drink!"
"By the time I finished the 2nd NA beer I'd ever had, I was fully convinced that if you want to stay away from alcohol, have water / coke / soda. NA beer is a wrong number. This one looked alright, just like any macro would. The moment it moved from sight to smell and taste - it was a big let down. Very metallic, stale and lifeless. It was syrupy and unpalatable. Fizz, reminded me of stale and bitter ginger ale. I should've stuck to a Diet Coke or water."
"Still better than Corona."
"hey, for 50 cents it was cheaper than a bottle of water and sort of tasted like a real beer =)"
"D - Okay, here's the thing. If you really thirsty and it is hot, this stuff kicks butt. It's low in calories, and you almost feel like you are having a beer!"
"It certainly won't win any awards but if you can't have the alcohol in your beer, you're better off to stick to water."
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color lager with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light skunk with some light medium sweet malt notes. Taste is also a mix between some light medium sweet notes with some distinctive adjunct and some light skunk notes (damn green bottles). I can't say that this is really a lot worse then a regular Becks but then the regular beer is not very flavourful to start with."
"Light golden pour with a surprisingly long lasting white head. Smell is similar to most other NA beers I've tried. Malty, gummy and a little odd, but not the worst one I've smelled. Taste is pretty sweet and malty. Corn syrup like sweetness and just cloying. This is like beer flavored soda. Undrinkable but not the worst NA beer."
"Poured a tall, dense, bright-white head that left a beautiful coat of lace. Glowing pale golden beer holds a swarm of fast rising bubbles. Strong herbal hop notes are a bit pungent, and ride above a faint pale malt sweetness that is ever so slightly artificial. Faint flavors of spring flowers and tea ride a solid backbone of artificial sweetener and an acidic twang. Light crisp mouthfeel is dominated by the acidic taste. This beer has none of the typical NA off-flavors in the nose, and those in the flavor are less dominant then average. I don't mind the acidic flavor, but if there is one major flaw that is it. I'm on the fence with this one."
"Drinkabity- Alright. I wish I could give a little more detail but I am really marginal on this one."
"This is by no means great, but it's probably the best NA I've had yet. I'd buy it again if I was the designated driver and it was on sale."
"Pours crystal clear straw with a soapy two finger head. Surprisingly good retention, active streaming carbonation, and rings of lace. Skunk aroma, with the possibility of pilsener malt. Sickeningly sweet taste, like splenda, and skunked noble hop aftertaste. High carbonation and light body fight a losing battle to slickness, and the finish is challenging. I like to be surprised by a good NA beer, but this one is dissapointing."
"I haven't yet put in the numbers, but it's obvious that Beck's Alkoholfrei/Non-Alcoholic is the better of these two products and is, therefore, the winner of the first NA Shootout (With Blanks). It isn't the best one of these low alchohol beers that I've ever had, but is drinkable in a pinch. Let's hope that I never find myself in that big of a pinch."
"Overall: a plesant surprise for the location. Never really noticed the lack of alchol, flavor made up for it even in a mass market beer"
"It tastes, like nothing i've ever tried before, almost impossible to stomach...stay clear"
"This is truly an example of alcohol removal gone bad. A normal beer beck's is, this version is embarrasing to the brewery. It pours quite a pale golden tone with a scarce head. The smell, faint and with no inviting elements, has some hops but almost no other feel. The taste, i can literally describe as biting into grass and chewing, a weak presence of malt and excess water topped by an awful excess of hops (bitterness) unappropriate for the beer's style. Oh, this is a beer gone bad."
