1.5,-46.8,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15A). Bottle 50 cl - Batch L292104. AROMA: sweet aroma without the characteristics of a weizen. APPEARANCE: pale golden color with some haziness. thick moussy white head with good retention. TASTE: sweet aftertaste without bitterness, wheat flavour and the typical esters and phenols of a true weizen. PALATE: low, watery body with low carbonation. OVERALL: another alcohol free beer that tastes like alcohol free beer, without the flavours of the base beer.","titvs","Jul 17, 2014"

2.49,-11.7,4,2.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Bleh - not brilliant. I admire the principle of offering low-alcohol beer to consumers, but in this case the natural weissbier character has suffered greatly. The result is sweet, bland and one-dimensional. Where have those tasty yeast esters gone? Unless you need to avoid ethanol for some reason, I would recommend that you avoid this beer.","jazzyjeff13","Beers"
3.06,8.5,4,3,3,3,3,"Mouthfeel is a bit light and weak, still fairly crisp. Overall as a beer, this is pretty average but for the style it is not bad at all.

3.26,15.6,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Light cooked barley and grainy wheat balanced by light citrus acidity.

2.36,-16.3,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"D - Not bad but a bit too sweet. If you want light beer then this is probably one of the better options.","brendan13","Dec 17, 2006"
1.5,-46.8,4,1.5,1,2,1.5,"Poured a huge off-white head that sat above a hazy golden beer. Freakish sweet aroma is a bit grainy and corny; sort of like a bowl of half eaten frosted flakes that sat out all day. Same thing in the flavor, but even more potent. It finishes rediculously sweet and with a slight bitter bite. This tastes nothing like any wheat beer I've head (no wheat, just pure unfermented malt flavor), and there is no excuse for that. I have had NA and low alcohol Hefe's that have the right flavors/aromas, and don't have off-flavors. The sweetness takes over the mouthfeel and ruins that too. Forget about this one, unless you like Malta and don't mind that this is labeled a Weissbier.","HappyHourHero","Dec 09, 2006"

2.61,-7.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours a slightly hazy, golden amber color with a tall, well-sustaining white head. A sugary sweet honey character dominates both the aroma and the flavor of this brew. It tastes a bit like a beer that is, well, unfinished. Whats more, I cant really detect too much in the way of hops. Sure there is a bit of that banana zest that youd expect from a hefe, but it doesnt do much for this beers drinkability. I cant say its horrible but it doesnt make you want another. However, there are two bright points here: one, brats simmered in this beer come out especially flavorful (dont ask me why) and, as I slowly but surely finish off the six-pack, this brew is starting to grow on me","arguemaniac","Oct 03, 2005"
2.47,-12.4,4.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Erdinger Weissbier Alkoholfrei is not a good low alcohol beer. Needless to say, it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with a real hefe weizen. In fact, this would have been a better experience if it was flavorfrei. I guess low alcohol beer is the only option for some. I feel bad that it isn't possible to make it more palatable.","BuckeyeNation","May 11, 2005"
3,6.4,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer dispenses from the 500ml brown bottle a limpid gold with a monumental semi-creamy white head that slowly evaporates leaving a fine coating of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is sweet malted grain, fresh and crisp to the senses, start lightly sweet with a decent grain presence, top is light in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops present and light as one would expect, quite dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew for its type, and as my medical problems sometimes curtails my consumption of high-end beers, this non-alcohol beer does satisfy my urge for a Bit-O-Hops.","Gusler","Sep 07, 2004"
3.48,23.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is about as good a NA beer as could be hoped for, and in one of my favorite styles, Bavarian hefe. Now if only I could find a NA cask-conditioned bitter, I'd be set. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances which I won't relate here, I am temporarily confined to the alcohol-free portion of the beer spectrum, and it hasn't been nearly as unpleasant as I'd imagined. This beer gives crazy head. It takes about 10 minutes to cram all the beer and foam from the bottle into a weizen glass. Snowdrifts linger inside the bottle, and the glass never loses its thick layer of suds. The beer is golden, and hazy but not glowing the way some hefes can be. There is some wax, pepper and clove in the aroma; the smell is perhaps the most weizen-like feature. The taste is predominately sweet, with some light graininess and grapefruit hop. It's oddly reminiscent of an American extra pale ale, like Full Sail. Cookie dough lingers on the tongue. Winter spices are here also, weird but not in a bad way. I've noticed in NA beers a certain bread-staleness which is normally masked or preserved in regular beer by the alcohol. Here it is not too intrusive. It's a tasty beer, with a full if not sensuous mouthfeel, and good drinkability. It is, surprisingly, closer to my dreamed-of NA bitter than I would have expected.","Thrasher","Feb 29, 2004"
3.16,12.1,4,3,3,2,4,"A tasty liquid for sure but it doesn't REALLY taste like beer, it tastes like bread. This would go great with brats and sauerkraut.","Zorro","Nov 19, 2002"

Pours out to a bright yellow, with a generous, fluffy head. Taste is that of a standard weiss, albeit a bit lighter. I detected bananas and clove in the taste. A gentlemen that frequents the local beer store I go to cannot drink alcohol and told me about this one. Tasty for an N/A believe it or not.","proc","0"
