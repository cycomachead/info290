"Overall: Saw this laying out as a single and picked it up out of curiosity as I haven't tried a NA beer yet. As expected the flavor and body is very light. Not good but not terrible either although if I had to give up booze I doubt I would drink something like this much."

"What I purchased was fresh. I bought it cold and kept it cold. I had to really take a whiff to smell the malt - no skunk here. The flavor is sharp and the malt lingers in the wash. To makeup for the absence of alcohol there are mineral overtones - sodium is slightly pronounced. What I like about it most of all. I could tell the makers wanted to deliver a satisfying beverage for those of us who can't drink alcohol."

"Overall a well crafted brew but has almost no character."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a pale golden amber with a one finger white head that dissipated slowly, leaving light lacing. Faint aroma of sweet malt, not much else. Light flavor of sweet malt with a hint of light fruit juice and no noticeable hops. Light bodied. A light, but pleasant no/low alcohol malt beverage. A little on the sweet side and the malt is subdued, but quite drinkable. I'm a little surprised at other recent reviews: how does this compare to craft beer? Not well. But it is sold as a no/low alcohol brew. My ratings will be higher because I'm reviewing to style, not comparing to a high ABV craft beer. That being said, I've enjoyed the stronger malt flavors of other no/low malt beverages, but this was a nice low key one."
"Overall - If you like light beers like Bud and Coors light, which haven't much flavor, it would drink this instead , but I wont buy this again the price was a little too steep for what you get. At $10.99 a six pack this beer should be outstanding compared to what you will get for a craft beer here in the Pacific Northwest."
"O: This beer isn’t that bad for being non-alcoholic, although it could use some more hops to lend bitterness and cancel out some of the sweetness. The label says to serve this cold—and that’s how I consumed it—so I’m not sure if it would become sweeter after warming up. It’s quite drinkable."
"Had a six pack n my basement left over from during my wife's pregnancy. Opened one tonight just to give it a try. Poured into a small beer tasting glass. Bright orange color, some carbonation, but no head or lacing. Smell was somewhat skunky and vegetable-like. Taste was like malty apple juice. No hops at all. Mouthfeel was thin but slightly similar to a pilsner. Slight bitter aftertaste. I have had one other wretched low alcohol beer, and this I will admit was slightly better. At least this is German."

"Putrid Tasting beer, makes me winder if toilet water would be preferable in my glass. Pours golden with nice clarity but minimal head. Nose is skunky with a cooked vegetable character that is appalling. Foul cooked veggies on palate too. Some rice maybe."
"Drinkability - kind of low as far as beers go. Again, the taste was close to that of a German pils, but a little fake tasting. As far as repeat drinking, since one would have to be drowning in the stuff to get a buzz, I'd say it's safe enough to go back to a few times."
"D: The best near beer I've had though I haven't had many. This is a low alcohol beer that could fool a lot of people into thinking it was a light Helles blind."
"Pours a macro yellow color with a white head. The aroma is lots of corn with some malty sweetness. The flavor is sweet corn, it tastes like a very sweet macro lager. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is not very good, but it is not much worse than most of the large BMC lagers, even though it is a low alcohol beer."
"Longneck bottle poured into a tulip glass because that's how I roll. Ever so pale straw colored with an actually adorable white head with nice retention and lacing. Aromas of honey, pear, and some pleasant grains. I like the smell, it just needs some hops to balance it out. Tastes like apple juice, and a crisp mild bittering that gives it a semblance of balance. Touches of grain, no off flavors. The body is light, with moderate to low carbonation. The carbonation leaves quite fast after a few agitations and it is left being too watery. This is almost like a beer soda, which is exactly what I would expect from a non-alcoholic beer after all. This is a decent drink."
"note: I've enjoyed Paulaner Hefeweizen, Oktoberfest and Munich Lager, but ThomasBrau Non-Alcoholic Brew is pure sh*t."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down quite easily though, not filling at all, knowing that this is an NA I was not expecting much but was determined to keep an open mind, however this beer still disappointed, especially since I had previously tried some very good beers from this brewer."
"Color is extremely pale straw with not much carbonation in the body. Has a thin head but leaves some specks of lacing. Smells of pale malts with a touch of a grainy cereal twang that I like. The hops present give off aromas of herbs. Flavor is lightly sweet with a sizable dose of pale, crackery malts that remind me of a helles. Has a bit of hops toward the end that give it an herbal/grassy thing. Has a little weird sour note in the finish along with a seltzery wateriness. Mouthfeel is thin, light, and with a prickly carbonation. Highly drinkable and I could see myself throwing these back as some sort of soft drink but without the overbearing sweetness of a soda."
"I like NA's, call me crazy (my friends all do) but sometimes a low alcohol can be very satisfying! Pours a light golden colour, some foam but just under decent for a german NA .. a good clean taste but really could be better, there are better reduced alcohol beers out there.."
"Paulaner's ThomasBrau lost NA Shootout (With Blanks) II as soon as I got a whiff of it. I went through the motions of evauating the rest of its attributes though, despite the fact that I was repulsed each time I forced myself to drink a mouthful. I have a few other German NAs in my cellar, ready and waiting for future Shootouts. Let's hope they have some redeeming qualities because this dreck has absolutely none at all."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass euro-style longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Not recommended, this is a poor choice among non-alcohol beers."
"Disappointing beer for me as Paulaner is my favorite German brewery and I was hoping this would be a winner. Buy some O'Doul's instead and save yourself a few bucks."
"Unfortunately, this one suffers from the same problems that plague many other beers of the style: lack of bite or richness (no hop bite, weak finish, general blandness, etc.) plus an unappetizing, sickly sweet honey flavor and aroma. But relative to other low-alcohol beers, its pretty good. However, that expression in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king comes to mind"
"Well- I likely won't be searching for more NA brew unless there is a sleeper out there."
"A passable brew, somewhat better than the macros being served, but without the alcohol. Some lace in the glass, transparent and light yellow. Smells like beer, tastes like watery beer. Fizziness, drinkable. Dry aftertaste, little malt. Crisp, appropriate with the meal for a long night ahead."
