3.89,0.5,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"Overall - I'm not a sour beer fan, however, this must be my favorite; likely due to the fact it is barrel aged and the bottle itself is aged roughly 17 months!","DenverHopHead","Oct 27, 2014"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a tulip, the beer is a ruby brown coloring, with a tan halo of head. Nose of dark cherry, oak, old world fruit, booze, and tart sweetness. Flavors are tangy caramel, tart cherry, merlot characteristics, woody highlights, and a subtle acidic note. Robust and full-bodied. The aftertaste is tart cherry all over, with some merlot and cabarnet notes, with a dry, lingering, tart finish. Heavy brew.","GarthDanielson","Oct 27, 2014"

3.75,-3.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a pleasant sourness all around.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"
4.24,9.6,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"some of the best stuff to come out from funkwerks, and thats really saying something as all of their beer is outstanding. just getting into sours, this beer is quality beyond their newness. lighter brown in color with some amber hues and a soda head of clearish tan bubbles. the nose is tart as it is sour, with a richer malt base consisting of chocolate malt amongst others, not sweet but with a little richness to it. there is a lot of acid too, which pulls me from grain to yeast, almost fruity in nature, citric and lactic at the same time, subtle but leading. the flavor is just like the nose, although the acid is more forward than indicated. its all the way through, not just in the finish, and the carbonation being so bright makes it really come alive. dry in the finish, even though there is some heft to the darker grain, its all gone on the swallow. as carbonated as they come, its fizzy and almost loud in the mouth. i hope funkwerks keeps up with the sours, this is a heck of a way to make a splash in that world. i wish this was a little more available than it is, but a really nice american made example of the style.","StonedTrippin","0"

3.94,1.8,3.75,4,4,3.5,4,"O-This is a pretty decent attempt at a tough style. A little bit more sour/tartness would have paired well with the earthy flavors, but even lacking the pucker factor, I found this beer growing on me as I finished my first glass and poured my second. It manages to be complex, but approachable. A nice take on one of my favorite styles.","spoony","Dec 17, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a brown with a mahogany hue and a khaki head, that leaves very nice lacing on sides. Aroma offers some pomegranate and plum, some vinegar, coffee cake, caramel, and woody. Flavor starts off with the dark fruits which is then disrupted by some vinegar, there's also some caramel and brown sugar, a good does of some breadiness, and it closes out with the woodiness that offers a little bitter in the finish. More mildy sour than moderate. A fuller, heavy mouthfeel. Overall, Funkwerks with another winner. Would definitely drink this again.","denver10","0"
