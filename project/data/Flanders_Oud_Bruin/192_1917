Combining traditions of European style sour ale with American hops and home-country brewing, this beer deserves it's price and rarity. At 7 percent ABV, La Folie allows the consumer to experience the subtle deliciousness of an ale combined with the sweet and earthly-bitter fermentation of the wine barrel. Overall, this in one beautiful beer. I recommend it whenever and wherever you find it, even with the price it's set at. Make this an opener of a good night and enjoy, because an American brew such as this is rare and worth your time.","Jasonm2","Mar 04, 2015"

Drinking an entire bomber of this to oneself is not advised... still tasted great over the 2 hours it took me to finish, but my stomach took a beating. Before anyone asks why I was crazy enough to finish it off in one sitting: his glass was already poured, so it would have been silly to funnel it back into the empty bottle with a stopper (plus, no idea how well the stopper would keep it, especially after the transfer).

4.55,6.8,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"BOD 2014.  Beautiful clear dark ruby pour.  Held to light, it is a deep garnet.  Good head volume and retention for the style.  Lacing is quite good. The outstanding complex nose is light sweet red fruit - raspberries and cherries - with hints of apples and peaches, over a slightly tart and sour background.  Light medium bodied with a surprisingly creamy texture given it's carbonation.  Well carbonated with explosive effervescence throughout.  The flavor profile is simply World Class ( very intense amazingly complex and masterfully balanced ).  It begins with an assault of the flavors of the nose. Tart fruits, with a slightly sour note, slowly allow separation into their components (raspberry, cherry, tart apple) as the tart and sour mild puckering effect sets in.  The middle is where the masterful balance and complexity become evident as every flavor just ebbs and flows like a tidal action and oak notes become evident.  The finish is a slightly sweet flavor fade into a tart dry pucker that has crisp elements and hints of vinegar.  A 12 oz. format would be ideal, as a bomber is a bit much for such a tart ale.","tillmac62","Dec 12, 2014"

Sour vinous fruit nose ... red wine, raisin, tamarind, light floral vanilla, maybe a whiff of caramel. Mainly sour fruit though. Initial taste impression is that of sour cherries and grapes drizzled with light chocolate sauce and vanilla nougat. Over the course of a few sips the chocolate note becomes less salient and the sour fruit and vanilla notes take over, although the former never entirely goes away. Nice acetic red wine vinegar flavor that falls just shy of puckering, and something else a little goaty or salty-sweaty perhaps. Faint echoes of licorice and oak chips. I am noticing more oak on the nose about half way through. Feels prickly on the tongue yet somehow quite smooth at the same time, a fizzy yet soft paradox. Cola-like brown spice comes on strong late, nutmeg, peppercorn. Finishes sour, salty, and woody, with more of that prickly to soft caress transition described earlier. I understand why this style is sometimes described as a real polarizer. Like cilantro or molasses, you either love it or hate it. I am firmly ensconced in the former category, with relatively limited experience to date.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 28, 2014"

Smell is of cherries, pears, green apple, cider, and bread.   Taste is sour reminiscent of the nose,  surprise, but there was a nice undercurrent of malt, vanilla bean and chocolate that helped balance it out.  Picked up some wood/oak notes later on. Mouthfeel is interesting, below average carbonation, and it is not as crisp as other sours I have had.  This one has more dense, creamy mouthfeel.   Recommended, price is a little steep, but worth it.","Apellonious","Aug 29, 2014"

Lots going on in the aroma - dark fruit, caramel, red wine vinegar, with hints of biscuity malts and earthy, floral hops. The taste is tart - cherry and apple, earthy yeast, caramel, vanilla, and vinegar. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Finishes dry. Overall, a very drinkable Flanders ale.","JohnG190","Aug 03, 2014"

4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass; 2013 vintage, bottled 12/2/2012. Pours crystal clear dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, cranberry, green apple, raisin, plum, red wine vinegar, caramel, brown bread, hay, straw, grass, leather, toasted oak, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, dark malt, and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of sour cherry, green apple, cranberry, raisin, plum, red wine vinegar, caramel, brown bread, hay, straw, grass, leather, toasted oak, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, green apple, cranberry, raisin, plum, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, leather, toasted oak, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Flanders brown ale. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink even with the moderate acidity.

Nose is dominated by tart black cherry, definite sour notes, green apple also. Taste is sour, whoa, cheeks definitely puckered right off the bat, but then as my palate got used to it some more flavor came out. Sour cherry, red wine vinegar, and rhubarb are what I'm getting most of. Body is pretty full, finishes nice and dry, not too much carbonation, but it's BA so that's expected. Overall I like it and would purchase again, really into the sours right now and this is a good one.","slackattack","Jun 24, 2014"

4.24,-0.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"2014. Pours ruby red/brown almost tawny port like. Little to no head. Smells like tart cherries and green apple. Did not get much oak smell. Much like the smell, tastes of cherries and green apple with moderate sourness. . I get more of the oak flavor in the taste but not as much as I expected. Mouthfeel is a tad bit thin but leaves a subtle tartness leftover. Not the best La Folie (I feel like other years were better) I've had but for the price and availability still a great beer.","murphy1ryan","Jun 05, 2014"

It has a gorgeous light brown look to it with lots of carbonation bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass and not really any head. I get the smell of green apple skin, tart cherries, and barnyard funk, which are pretty typical of the style, but then there's a sweet fruit juice smell also coming through. The taste is puckering all the way down with notes of cherry, plum, lemon and funky bread yeast. It finishes very sour, like a sip of apple cider vinegar, but it's highly carbonated to keep the palate refreshed.","itsscience","May 25, 2014"

4.25,-0.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought that it was a pretty good example of a Sour Ale, it had lots of sourness to it, but somehow it kept from being too acidic, but I think it would be a little better if there was a little more complexity to it. This beer doesn't have the best drinkability, it was a little smooth, not too acidic, a little refreshing, too mouth puckering, but the flavor did a nice job at holding my attention, I think the high amount of sourness would prevent me from drinking more than half the bottle, I think half is the perfect amount for me and I think this would be a nice spring time and summer time beer. What I like the most about this beer was the fruity aspect, it made for a nice flavor and it was for sure the highlight of the aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the high level of sourness, it was just a little bit past my breaking point and I think it would make this beer just a little better if the sourness was toned down a little, i also think it could be a little more complex. I would buy this beer again, but because of the price I think I would only get one or two and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys sour beers especially the really sour ones. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, if it had a little more complexity to it it might be a very impressive beer, but as it stands I enjoyed it even though the sourness was just a little too much to for me, I still found myself quickly coming back for another sip to get more of those great berry flavors. This isn't my favorite sour, but it is up there as one of the better beers from the LIps of Faith series that I have had. Good job guys, this was a really nice beer, keep up the good and creative work.","StoutHunter","Apr 12, 2014"

Scents of sour lactic acid, apple cider vinegar, apple, cherry and barnyard funk. It's another rustic area, very wild and sour, with some classic fruit in the aroma. The fruity, funk and mustiness combine to make a very nice aroma. Taste follows the nose. Sour lactic acid, apple cider vinegar, sour cherry and dry red wine with a dry finish. Very sour and vinegar like, but quite good. Just enough complexity to balance the sourness of the beer. Mouthfeel was medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a drying finish. It puckers and drys the mouth enticing you to take another sip. Very well crafted. Overall this is an excellent, rustic Belgian sour ale. It hits a lot of very pleasant sour and fruity notes and balances them with a mouthfeel that plays to the beer's strengths. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 16, 2013"

This ale reminds me of Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I think its better than its foreign counter part and way less sweet and syrupy. A very complex ale in respect to its smell and taste. This beer goes down extremely smooth, especially for its level of tartness. I picked up several bottles with hopes of cellaring a few and it is down to one. I really enjoy this sour as a go-to.

4.81,12.9,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"Brewed in the tradition of a Flander Oud Bruin, the 2011 vintage pours a hazy, deep mahogany with red highlights around the edges. A quickly disappearing cap of light brown foam dies down to provide a solid amount of lacing. Powerful aromas of balsamic vinegar erupts from the glass and is joined with hints of oakiness and green apple. The nose of this brew leads the mouth to begin salivating in anticipation of the sourness awaiting the drinker! Some will complain that this beer tastes like vinegar, and we urge those people to take another sip. The depth of flavors provided in a sip of La Folie include tart cherries, oak, Brettanomyces, and green apple. All of these amazing sour flavors swirl over a base of light malt that provides enough sweetness to help reign in a touch of the sourness. Dry in the finish, La Folie is medium-light in body with a moderate level of carbonation.","phishsihq","Jun 04, 2013"

The smell was obviously a sour ale - very pungent and clearly it was going to be a sour. I was a bit suprised though, because I kind of expected the brown, dark color to lend a new taste to the sours that I know and love. I didn't notice any difference in the taste. I expected it to have the coffee / chocolate / dark malt taste, judging by the color, but I didn't notice anything really different from many of the other sours I've had. Either way, this was a very enjoyable beer which I will definitely purchase every time I see it.","BrianJohnson","May 26, 2013"

3.67,-13.8,4,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"The beer pours a dark candied brown, and sits in the glass as almost purpling brown with only a ring of sand-dune-colored bubbles as a head. The beer‚Äôs body is beautifully ruby colored in the light, and hazy with proteins and such, there is even a nice steady stream of miniscule bubbles working their way to the top of the beer. The beer leaves a lacing of splotchy bubbles that almost look like a crooked willow tree on my glass. The lacing is sticky and dry, but not dominant on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells nicely green apple tart with malic acid and funky with hints of malt vinegar. There are slight hints of oak, and definite cherry leather scents in the funk, though it does tend more towards the barnyard side of things. As I stick my nose in it more, I almost get a toasty note within the funk, which I assume is coming from the barrels, and which also hints at a molasses scent in the malts. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely acidic and with only a light touch of sweet sugar and fruit and a lingering hint of salt in the aftertaste. Flavors begin as puckering green apple, which grows into slight malt vinegar and green apple flavors. The tartness is a little oppressive on the taste buds, but there are light hints of cherry and light cleaning solution on the finish of the beer. The aftertaste mellows the beer out considerably and brings some lovely caramel malts into the tart cherry flavor alongside a less pleasant flavor that moves from appleskins to green apple and also shows hints of bitter tannin from the barrels the beer aged in. In the mouth, the beer feels medium light in body, but attacks the tongue oppressively with carbonation, washing away any sweetness that may have helped balance out the big tart flavors of the beer. The mouth is left puckering and a little burnt from carbonation, and wet from the spittle trying to neutralize the acid of the beer. Overall, this beer, like many American wild ales, is a little unbalanced in terms of acidity. It has some lovely complexities that get drowned in the harsh acidity of the beer. Perhaps with age the acid will mellow and the brettanomyces that I assume are in this beer will become more dominant, but right now I think the beer is a little too rough and acidic for my tastes, though certainly complex and well crafted. Maybe I got an off bottle.","Maxwell","Apr 20, 2013"

4.39,3.1,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"22oz bottle. 2012 vintage. Pours a deep clear ruby with a foamy off-white head. This maintains some robust ringing, leaving back thick sudsy swathes of lacing. Smells of oak and dark vinous character, with some acidic notes that singe the nose a bit at first. Some light backing sugars fill out the back of the nose. The taste is oak and wine with a somewhat heady sourness to the profile that puckers the tongue a bit but overall isn‚Äôt too overbearing. Sugars emerge more and more as this warms, helping even the flavors out. Dry and oaky on the finish with some lingering sweetness. The feel is medium with a sharp creaminess to the carbonation that blows up a bit in the mouth yet is undercut by some tannic slickness that helps keep this smooth. Alcohol feels right about where it should be. A little aggressive at first with the flavors, this balances out beautifully as things warm and develops into a tremendous example of a Flanders Red. One of the best from New Belgium and a great overall sour.","Kegatron","Apr 15, 2013"

3.96,-7,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,"Purchased at BevMo. 2013 is year on label. Very tart yeasty smell. Typical of style I've found. Slightly champagne like. Color is rich opague brown, with a frothy cream colored head. Flavor is very good. Sour and tart. Fruit is tough to differentiate. Strawberry I'd say. Very nice. Mouthfeel is good also, bubbly with a semi dry finish. This is a really good beer. New Belgium can be hit or miss with me but this one's a hit. The reason for a lower overall score is this is hard for me to finish. I almost got heartburn towards the end from the sourness.","Braz","Mar 29, 2013"

Mild carbonation is masked through a haze with very little transparency in the middle, lighting up a bit towards the bottom of the glass. Good lacing, not a bad looking flanders red. Aroma of tart cherry, apple, vinegar, oak, a sweet mild malt and a bit of alcohol. Dark fruit esters also come through bringing everything together. Taste follows well, sour fruits up front, nice toasty oak, and a subtle malt backbone. Feel is good, medium body which leaves my mouth salivating. Overall this years isn't bad. I don't know if it's whether I've gotten more acclimated to sours, but this years doesn't seem as strong as last years, despite having the abv kicked up to seven.

Not a cheap endeavor, but hey, you only live once. The risk was that I would really like sour beers, and that would get expensive. This was not the case. The La Folie has a glowing brown body with a reddish tinge if held to the light. The head is pretty thin, but hangs in there. The aroma tells you that this is not your normal beer. Sour apple is the outstanding note. As so it goes with the flavor. Definitely sour, definitely complex. Sour apple and vinegar are some of the notes in the flavor. It‚Äôs just SO different. Beers cover a big range from wheats to stouts and IPAs to Belgian styles, but all are recognizable as beer. The La Folie is definitely on the very edge of beer, if not beyond. The sour style is not what I would go for in an after dinner sipping beer. Maybe with certain foods, or a bit before dinner as an appetizer, a sour would work better. That anything like this comes out of a brewery is a testament to the brewer, I am sure a sour is hard to brew. But likewise, I think it will take time to acquire a taste for sour beer, and there are too many great brews to be had.","iSip","May 15, 2012"

This one was poured into a pitcher, kept on ice at the bar, and then served in a 8oz. wine glass. Dark, ruddy, reddish-brown color, nearly translucent; a few stray bubbles on top, but otherwise no real head to speak of. Aroma mostly of sour grapes, sour cherries, and a dash of vinegar. Taste was similar, with sour fruit notes, causing the salivary glands to tense up a bit; underlying that were notes of wood and nutty malts. Medium body, prickly and drying, pretty enjoyable in a session of sours and wild ales.","Rifugium","Mar 06, 2012"

The nose is sour, though sweet with a hint of vinegar and malty sweetness. The flavor is much the same. The sour character is dominate but not so much so that it overbears the malty sweetness, actually quite well balanced the beer has hints of oak, vanilla, and a touch of citrus. Mildly bitter. Finishes crisp and yet smooth. Good. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Overall, I missed La Folie. I will be back again and again.","hopfacebrew","Mar 05, 2012"

Not sure I detect any direct flavor from it but its a great base. Very crisp, with a enjoyable amount of carbonation to it, and lighter in body.

The alcohol is hidden exceptionally well. If I was to complain about anything, it would be too much malt focus in this. Compared to my last experience with la folie (2010) this just proves the wild nature of these brews. Last years was face rippinly sour, this one not so much. Overall still a quality brew.","stakem","Aug 15, 2011"
3.9,-8.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall - This is not my first Flanders Red, or my first venture into ""sour"" beers in general, but it does seem to be higher up the ladder. While it is mouth-puckering, if that is something you like or that grows on you, you'll like this beer. It's not TOO mouth-puckering, though. When it warms up, the sour seems to lessen, but maybe that's just me getting used to the sourness. For my overall rating this gets a 4.0. Good, not great. Could possibly be a ""gateway beer"" to sours, but then again, my first was Deschutes The Dissident and I loved it, so maybe I'm just strange like that.","matttttYCE","Aug 10, 2011"

4.35,2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - By far, my favorite sour brown ale out of the bunch due to how balanced it is between sweet/sour - above Rodenbach, Rodenbach Grand Cru, Duchesse De Bourgogne, Bourgogne de Flandres, etc. I'm very impressed how well New Belgium has pulled this one off and hope they continue making it. If only it was available in more than 22oz Bombers!","perilsofrosella","Aug 08, 2011"
4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D - Absolutely wonderful, reminds me of a more rounded out Duchese De Bourgogne. This is a beer that develops very, very nicely. We enjoyed a 2010 the night before opening this one and the differences were remarkable.","dubinsky","Aug 08, 2011"
4.4,3.3,4,4,5,4,4,"Piura a dark brown color with no head at all. Aroma typical of a Flanders, slight fruity with malt notes also lacto in the back. Taste is very tart in the best way possible.

4.57,7.3,4,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,"Overall most likely the best beer NB makes and one of the most intense sours on the market.","chumba526","Aug 06, 2011"
4.7,10.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5," This is just tremendously good I don't know how to begin, sour cherry -very tart taste with slight sweetness almost a toasted pie-like flavor. The cherry taste takes over and the sharp acidic lemony gives a slightly fruity mix, like cherry lemonade with so much going on it is sour times three. I love how aggressive it is, yet it still has some gentle sweetness to keep it in check, magnificent in every way, the yeast is doing most of the work making a very complex backdrop for the malt to mingle with. Overall I can't think of many sour beers that deserve the name as much as this, wild doesn't quite cut it. La Folie has that Rodenbach cherry yeast flavor but goes a step further, an exceptional sour brown. This has to be tasted to be believed.","Slatetank","Aug 06, 2011"
4.57,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall: Surpassed my expectations by a long shot. I would love another few bottles of this! A top notch american sour!","OddNotion","Aug 05, 2011"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a caramelized sugar brown with a 2 inch cap that leaves soapy lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma comes off as pie cherries mixed with oak and vinegar. The flavor is much the same with sour pie cherries leading the way. A little raspberry with woody oak and a nice vinegary bite. Tartness hits you at the base of the jaw with grapefruit. The mouthfeel is light and mildly prickly. Overall, I think this is the best American easily accessible sour.","hwwty4","Jul 27, 2011"
4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a good sour. Similar to Rodenbach in flavor. Not a beginner sour, but not the most complex one either. But a drinkable one if you like the acetic sort of sourness.","musicforairports","Jul 26, 2011"

3.5,-17.8,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Overall it's interesting, but not something I'm anxious to have again. It's a bit overbearing and could use to be a little less dry, especially considering how heavily sour it is. It's not my favorite Flander's red ale.","AlCaponeJunior","Jul 24, 2011"
4.32,1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer is a brown color with a thin filmy off white head. It smells of sour cherry cola with some vinegar. The taste has a lot of sour vinegar and cherry flavor with just a hint of sweet malt. The beer is super thick and chewy with low carbonation and a very dry sour finish, it really gets you on the sides of your cheeks. This is a great beer, I'm glad I finally tried it, split this with a buddy and I dont think he was quite ready for this.","JMad","Jul 23, 2011"

2.51,-41.1,4,1.75,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This was a fresh bottle from a reliable store that was kept refrigerated for about 3 weeks prior to consumption -- otherwise, I'd more strongly suspect it had gone bad. I let a dog sample some and he liked it, although it caused a long bout of sneezing.","chinchill","Jul 20, 2011"
4.09,-4,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"I think the 2010 vintage is pretty good also and I might come back later and review it next time I crack open a bottle, two 22oz Flanders bombers in one night is too much sour though.","DavidST","Jul 15, 2011"
3.9,-8.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"La Folie pours a deep mahogany, almost bordering on black. Ruby highlights are present, but (a little too) faint. There's a surprisingly solid head, about three fingers of khaki colored foam tops the beer. It all disappears quickly though, without any lacing left aside. The nose has the requisite notes of cherry skin and racy acidity, but it's a little bit too far tipped in favor of the latter to really be good. I'm not finding the more pronounced cherry influence in the flavor that I was hoping for, but there's a certain biscuit/caramel malt sweetness right at the open of each sip that does the job instead of balancing out the acidity of the beer. The mouthfeel is just about all I would ask for considering the style. Beguilingly light body for a beer with a definite malt presence, with carbonation that's clearly in the background, just enough to be there without becoming distracting or fizzy. La Folie really rounded out and came into its own as it finished warming up, but I can't see myself going through the effort of ever getting this beer again with Rodenbach Grand Cru so readily available.","axeman9182","Jul 13, 2011"
3.51,-17.6,3,2,4,4.5,4,"A great bottle to share, as I can never drink much of this. That being said, I thought it was delicious once it warmed up to room temperature.","ehammond1","Jul 12, 2011"

3.8,-10.8,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured a clear dark brown with an average sized light brown fizzy head that was gone before I took the first sip and had virtually no lacing to speak of. The aroma was kind of sweet with roasted cookie malts and a sweet yeast with notes of brown sugar, some dark dried fruit and a hint of sour apples. It tasted very lightly sweet and malty with a nice dried fruit note at first then WOW did it get sour real quick with a strong does of sour apple at the end. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and very dry in texture with a very lively carbonation. Overall as sour beers go this one is right up there. Very sour and very tasty. If you like sour beers this one is definitely worth a try...","KajII","Jul 12, 2011"

This beauty from Colorado is a dark brown mahogany color with a decent light tan head that thins out with very nice lacing. The aroma is a sweet sour malty brown sugar, skunky and aluring. The flavor is definite pucker-up sour with cherry malt and brown bread goodness. Vinegar, apple and a slight flowery hop in there, this stuff is a taste sensation if you like the style.

The brew tastes like tart and sweet cherries, vinegar, tart apples, plums and a bit of caramel and chocolate. It's mostly sour but the sweet flavors are definitely noticable. There's also a lingering tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with good carbonation. I think it's a pretty good overall brew.

It's initially sour cherry flavors with vinegar and delicious oak notes. Then it gets sweet with some vanilla and malt flavors. Then I get more tartness which finishes off with sweet cherries and a bit more oak. Very complex flavors in this beer. Mouthfeel is mouth-puckering and finishes nice and dry. Drinkability is high.

The beer is sour on the forefront when it hits your tongue, followed by a very brief hit of dark caramel-malty flavors, then quickly back to the sour. In between the sours, there also seems to be a flash of chocolate flavoring. The sours in this beer pucker the mouth, but amazingly don't linger long after you swallow. The aftertaste is all sour, but again, leaves the mouth quickly. A surprisingly smooth finish for such a sour, puckering, jaw clenching flavor.

The taste brings in the same basic elements, though the cherries come through more tart, and some port joins the party as a late-comer.

It then goes Sour Ale for most of the drink, and finishes with a smoky Brown Ale.

I get a good pucker with each sip, this one has some acidic super powers. Lacto and vinegar are running rampant with a solid amount of cherries to back them up. I can taste a bit of ""oaky"" smoothness on the top of my mouth as the sour train departs on its collision course with my stomach.

The sourness is almost crushing, but as it warms many flavors come through for some balance in the flavor. Little underwhelmed by the thick sticky mouthfeel, with less carbonation than I would like, and definitely not something that I could drink without palate fatigue after a glass or two, which isn't saying I wouldn't enjoy every minute of it.

The sweetness is quite low, but the flavor is just so prominent, especially with the moderate tannins, it reminds me of a wafer cream biscuit (the strangest thing, I know, but it brought to mind Pickwick wafers). In any case, though, this is a big blend of vinegar and vanilla with some brown sugar, simple in the number of flavors, but well done. Sour cherries are very prominent, this reminds me of the Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek in how juicy and fruity it is. Drying on the finish with an acetic character, this beer is light in body with high carbonation. Tannin character is moderate, though this still does have a wild, woody, moderately mushroom character to it.

Smell is tart, vinegar, sour cherries and apples. Taste definitely delivers on the aromas. Very tart with plenty of mouth puckering goodness, very enjoyable if sour beer is your kind of thing. All the lively/tart/sour characteristics in this beer contribute to a pretty dry finish, leaving some residual sourness long after each sip. Overall, I find this beer to be pretty drinkable.

Notes of cherries and vanilla. Just a light vinegar flavor in the finish. I think the things I like most about the flavor are the things the brewer chose not to do, being adding Brett and other funky critters. This beer does belong in the same conversation as Rodenbach and Duchesse De Bourgogne. The last thing I want in a sour beer is prickly carbonation and this is borderline but otherwise is good.

The taste was sour from the first sip, with cidery, green apple flavor dominating all. In fact had I been subjected to a blind taste, I might have been fooled into thinking I actually was drinking fermented cider. A woody dryness followed the sourness imparting some vanilla finish. The alcohol was a non-factor in the taste. The body was medium thick and nondescript, but the lightness added to the refreshing and quenching appeal.

Some on the most intense and convincing berry and stone fruit flavors I have ever encountered. The malt character is quite nice as well and does its best to balance out the unstoppably intense sourness. The only area where the beer shows a weakness of flavor is in wood character; aside from some toast and vanilla in the aroma I don't get much. Drinkability is, as always, a relative thing; with this level of acidity I begin to feel heartburn coming on after one glass and despite this beers superb complexity, I find that some other, less sour, examples of the style are more to my liking.

The flavor is firmly sour, but has a nice malt balance that provides an earthy chocolate flavor without being too sweet. Lemon and cherry come to mind when thinking of fruit tartness present.

There is a little bit of a fruit aroma also. The initial taste is very sour, it also has almost a citrus sour/bitterness quality. It is lightly fruity and woody, but mostly sour.

Tart up front but still very balanced, a lot of yeasty fruity cherry notes underneath a very forward woody oak flavor. Tart enough to keep me interested but relatively mild and somehow remaining soft and very drinkable. Dry, zippy finish. This would be a great beer to introduce someone into the world of sour ales.

Taste matched the smell, and the tartness of cherries and yeast came predominantly forward with a mild sweetness on the finish. Best in small sips over quaffs due to the strength of the beers flavor; would go very nicely with a savory meal or a rich dessert.

Still, I would have liked a hint more sweetness from the malt and yeast, as the puckering sour tartness quickly wore away at my tastebuds.

An excellent tasting sour, if not the best I have had. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy, but nothing to complain about. I don't think I could drink more then a 375ml bottle by myself before being overwhelmed by the lemon notes, but overall the drink ability is good.

After a few seconds, as the sourness subsides, some of the fruit flavors appear. Sour cherries, tart green apple. Sour aftertaste left on the palate along with a slight woodiness.

Seems like they were going for a bold, Rodenbach Grand Cru type of sour, but just didn't get that kind of complexity and was just a bit off putting in the type of sourness created.

As the beer warms through the drinking session the woody aroma becomes more apparent and even begins to take on some sweeter notes like clove and even the slightest hint of bananna. Taste is characterized by in intense puckering sourness, vinous, vinegary and tart tart cherry, tiny pin pricks of carbonation keep this thing from dying on my tongue, thought this beer would have a bit more of a bite to it apart from the intense sourness. Again, as things warm (or as your tongue adapts to the beer) the tarter aspects begin to subside an become smoothed over, almost creamy.

Good, but also not great. The taste? Strawberries! Wood! Tart! Cherries! Sour! Puckering! Pinch of acidic character! Hmmm. I think this is why people love this so much, and I have to agree.

4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This has been one of the more illusive beers for me. Finally had to go to the brewery to nail it down. This might have been my favorite pint during the GABF '08 weekend. The beer begins with a mouthwatering scent of extreme berry-like tartness with black cherries, vineous red wine, oak, nuttiness, a touch of vinegar and even a hint of chocolate. Mesmerizing by the scent and the sight. The brandy sniffer shows a dark ruby color with brilliant clarity and a glowing crimson hue. Light head formation lasts the session. The pungent, assertive aromas morph seamlessly into the flavors with the same intensity and balance. The beer is aided by soft vanillans from the barrels and with a light tannin dryness. Other textures that come through are initial wine thinness, but then with a mild, all-attenuated malty creaminess, and lastly with a tart astringency that balances the beer in the absence of detectable hops. Finishes with a cherry-berry fruitiness and sharp dryness. If the malt backbone could add more creaminess, it would surplant Duchesse du Burgogne as my favorite Flanders.","BEERchitect","Oct 17, 2008"

4.77,12,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Bottle I picked up in August at Beertopia in Omaha. Saved it for New Years. Poured a light terracotta and very clear, with hints of red. Nice egg-white colored head, quickly falling. Smells pungently sour. Tart cherries, red wine and hints of vanilla on the nose as well. Taste was obviously sour, but that came later for me. First is got a very woody, oak and vanilla taste, followed (and quickly) by the big tart cherry punch. Very sour, earthy and complex. Fruity like a cherry wine but without the rudeness of overwhelming alcohol to choke you. As it warms and i get used to it, more of the oak barrel flavors and a brett-barn floor and wet hay taste grow through. Effervescent enough to compliment the sourness, but not overwhelmingly so. Medium bodied. Overall, its great. A delicious, interesting beer. Glad to have tried it.","aforbes10","Jan 01, 2008"

Low but persistent head with good lacing. The aroma is the best part of this beer. It's like a summer pond - murky fresh, funky, sweet and refreshing. The strong smell creeps out of the glass. Strong notes of wood, cherry pie and baking crust. The taste is much more tart than expected. The front is big, tart and lactic and strong tartness confined to the finish. The flavor is very prevalent and drips off your teeth. I'm missing a middle maltiness that would provide a balanced sweetness but overall very impressive. The beer is dry but not puckering with a nice carbonation presence.

Negligible lacing observed. The smell suggests a sour tyrant with an underlying sweet apple malt. Highly carbonated, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied. While ""sour"" is the word, there is a solid complexity in the nose and mouth feel. The flavor is masked by the sourness. The first Flanders Red Ale that I've experienced; it's quite similar to the both of the popular New Glarus Fruit/Vegetable products...but IMO the drinkability of this beverage is far less superior than the similar tasting New Glarus products, even though they are different styles.","jjayjaye","Dec 06, 2007"

Consuming 12 ounces of beer is a rare feat for him these days.

Body is a slightly cloudy chestnut brown color, topped by a minimal amount of tan head that quickly recedes to a thin ring. Nose of tart red wine vinegar, dried apricot, light candy sugar, and a hint of Euro hops. Palate is mildly sweet up front, yielding only a small clue to the sour onslaught that hits mid-palate. Mild citrus flavors are embedded in a deep vinegary sourness, along with a touch of spicy noble hops. The sourness only increases as the beer warms, bringing out notes of sauerkraut and brine amongst the complex flavors. Body is robust enough to convey the complexity of the beer, while getting out of the way to provide a maximum pucker factor. The supreme sourness limits the drinkability of this beer, but it's not something you'd want more than one glass of in an evening.

Very tart with berry fruitiness and light vinegar notes. Woody and very lightly funky too. It started with some sweetness, but this disappeared by the end. The finish is long on tart acidity with a bit of lingering berry flavour. Quite dry, plenty of tannins, yet the texture stays fairly smooth. Full bodied with higher than average carbonation.

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I finally got around to opening my bottle which I bought from the brewery while visiting Colorado last November. It was corked, hand bottled (#7922), and had a very different style label than any of the other New Belgium beers. If I remember correctly, the person at the brewery said that this beer had only been brewed twice at that time. He also said they achieved the final product be a process of blending various barrels together. I liked the aroma...it has some nice Lambic characteristics to it. The color was deep, dark, red. The head was fairly small but creamy. I liked how the head lasted all the way to the end. It's been a while since I've had a Rodenbach, but I would guess this is closest in style to the Grand Cru. It has a great depth of flavor with a nice tartness and acidity. This may not be as sweet as the Rodenbach Grand Cru. (I wish I had one here so I could compare.) The flavors linger on the tongue long after each swallow. I have to say I like this beer. In fact, I really like this beer. Had this been a blind tasting, I never would have guessed this was made in the good ol' U.S. of A. Great job New Belgium! If you like Belgian red ales, you owe it to yourself to track this one down.

Secondary are sharper young balsamic twangs. Well rounded and appetizing aromawise. Barbed acetic acid and cranberry bitterness envelope the palate intially and linger. After a deliberation, hints of vinous sherry vinegar and faint caramel provide token sweetness. Red currant esters arise mid palate along with subtle notes of fresh hay and earth. ""Barnyard"" notes are virtually absent. Woody oak and sandalwood notes surface as the beer warms. Prickly, but enjoyably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly sour, with fleeting hints of fermented kumquats and ghostly dark caramel. La Folie, especially the 2006 version, is a stunning brew that's not for the faint of heart.

The aroma hits you the sour and tartness from the bacterial fermentation, yet there is a lingering sweetness that promises an interesting flavor to come. The beer hits my tongue, causing my mouth to pucker from the wonderful sourness, yet the sweet undertones balance out the beer so nicely, that you cannot refuse another sip. The beer finished with a hint of wine and the wood aged flavor while letting the sour bacteria prevail.

Did a gentle pour into my New Belgium snifter so not much head a ton of initial carb that slowly faded. It had a reddish copper color with a bit of alcohol haze in it. Looks like it has held up well over the years. The aroma was obviously heavy on the sour cherries with a bit of wine/champagne throw in there. The taste is really, really good. This is my first La Folie and since it's 2.5 yrs old I can't say how it compares to a fresh one but at this point it's a nice smooth drink. The cherries are just approaching being too dominant so not sure if that has increased or decreased over time. The mouthfeel is pretty good but considering the initial carb I thought there would be more of carb bite. Overall, the aroma and taste are amazing and highly recommend. I only give 4 on the drinkability because I'm still growing into the style and one glass is enough for me for now. Can't wait to try a fresh one and see how it compares.

The aroma is sour with black cherry or other dark fruit; quite enjoyable. The flavor is sour with some malt sweetness but lots of dark fruit. The wood aging seems to come through with the dryness of this but not in the flavor which is fine as it would overcomplicate thes beauty. The mouthfeel is dry, light and quite puckering.

Smells of vinegar, some malty sweetness in there and a hint of cherries. Taste was amazing. Vinegar sour start, followed by a hint of cherries and a nice sweet oaky finish. This is a beer with alot goin on. As it warmed up the oakyness came out a bit more and the sourness either faded or I just got used to it, either way I absolutely loved what it had to offer.

A bit of cherry, a bit vanilla, with amouth- puckering feel. Could be a bit intense with too much at once, but marvelous to clear the palate with dinner.

Plums, cranberry, apple cider, a little bit of malt, oak, and a citrusy cleanliness. Perfect. My fiance's mother stated that it was the most incredible flavor she's ever experienced, period.

The only reason that the drinkability score isn't higher is because 750ml is a lot to drink of this beer by one's self (that isn't to say that I wasn't able to...but still, it's a little bit much for one sitting I think). A fantastic beer...seek it out.","LuckySevens82","Mar 19, 2005"

4.8,12.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Dark, brownish-red in hue; I couldn¬ít tell this beer was hazy until I held it to the light. When backlit it emerged hazy with a coppery highlight interwoven into the afore mentioned color scheme. I¬ím fond of the color of the liquid; it is darker than I remember it. The head was off-white in color; the bubbles were small and tightly compacted. At the zenith the head was about two fingers in height. As expected the foamy mass was short-lived and it faded to a fizzy cap, thicker around the edges. Sadly the subsequent lacing was spotty, kind of clumpy but not very widespread. That is too bad; I wanted a more uniformed pattern. Maybe I¬ím nitpicking. I find the appearance to be striking, deep, and mysterious. Fear the nose. The potency is huge. The bouquet is inviting. I am impressed with the strong the oak aromas! When I had this beer on-tap at the brewery it was ¬ìfresh¬î and the oak was softer; I¬íve cellared this bottle since March 2004, it has aged well. The nose is deeper than I remember it and I loved it at the time. Sharp winy notes with a lactic twang and equally sharp sour cherries with an underlying note of grapes and melons. Balsamic vinegar. Not much malt in the nose. I¬ím a big fan of Flanders Red Ales, IMO, the nose on La Folie is unique because the oak aromas are so clean and sharp and the bacterial byproducts are energetic and crisp. It is inviting but more so intriguing, I really wanted to take a sip just to see if what I smelled was real. Fear the palate. If you don¬ít know what you are getting into don¬ít buy this beer. The first sip is tart and raw and prone to ripping the tongue right out of your mouth. If Flanders Red Ales are your drink, seek this beer out. Cherries offer a more natural taste on the palate; of course the majority of the cherry influence is sharp, acidic, tart with red wine-like qualities. Dry. Bready. Sweet towards the finish with a lactic twang. Mouth puckering. I¬ím drinking oak juice. I¬ím drinking bacteria infused oak juice. I¬ím drinking bacteria infused oak juiced spiked with some fucking tart cherries. There is plenty of smaller flavors like apples, grapes, citrus zest, balsamic vinegar, sherry, strawberries, hazelnuts, and bubblegum. This beer is wild. Kudos to New Belgium for taming this beer long enough to get it into a bottle. How many people were maimed doing so? It was worth it. Damn this was good. Mouthwatering. Complex. Funky. Juicy. Raw. Evil. Angelic. But the bottom line is simple enough: this is a great beer. Bring on the funky cheeses!! Medium/medium-full in body, the carbonation is big and lively, just like it should be. The mouthfeel is consistent with the taste, dry and sharp with prickly effervesces only interrupted with a blast of heat at the back of the throat right before the liquid is completely swallowed. Raw. For me this beer is very drinking and amazingly likable. There are no flaws with in its drinkability. A perfect quaff and like I said before bring on the funky cheese!! I purchased this bottle at the brewery. $18 a pop is a steep price tag. It was a treat. Highly Recommended.","bditty187","Dec 28, 2004"

4.54,6.6,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a hazy medium red color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing. The smell is slightly tart, with some fruit and oak just melding together. The aromas fit together like a puzzle. The taste is also slightly tart and sour, with some sweet cherries punching toward the front. Also has a good oak aftertaste as it warms. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, but smooth as well. The drinkability is great for the style. A big shout out to prAna for this treat!","SheepNutz","Oct 25, 2004"
4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a red/amber color with almost no head at all, so, no lacing either. The aroma is sweet cherry or raspberry with a wood and it's somewhat sweet. The flavor is sweet, cherry but is also a little tart and acidic. Not exactly what I had in mind, but I'm really not sure what I did have in mind. Might be a little chocolate in there. I'm not much of a fan of beers that have sour in them, but this one was very well crafted.","clvand0","Oct 25, 2004"
5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"The first sip begins with a sour cherry sweet/tart interplay that continues throughout the whole beer, every step of the way. There's a woody astringency through the middle and finish, but the real gem here is the biting sourness at the end. Hardly just sour, there's an earthy, organic bitterness that underlies it all, so while your mouth feels like it just got washed out with an acid wash, the actual drink feels nicely balanced and incredibly complex. Layers of flavor; sour; interesting; aromatic; delicate -- these are all the things I look for in great beers. And this is one of the best I've ever had.","marburg","Aug 31, 2004"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Amber-copper body is darker than I expected. Honest off-white head with above average retention for the style. Aroma explodes with oak wood character. Lova at first sniff you¬íll call it. Cedar, vinegar, wood chunks, it¬ís an obsession. I feel like walking in a forest right now. This is more than I can handle. All kinds of little red fruits provide these admirable fruit acids to marry the balsamic. Farmy taste, nostalgic, elegant, very fruity, cherry and raspberry reminding. And that oak, marvellous oak, wood among the wood. Blue cheese hints, cider-like dryness is explosive in the finish and adds just a bit more class to a drink that really didn¬ít needed anymore. Perfect level of acidity for the style. Perfect medium-full body with tongue-cleaning carbonation. Great stuff, mind stimulating. Kudos to an american brewer (not that he didn¬ít work with the best belgians before) to reproduce such a rare and beautiful style with such elegance. And kudos to hopsrus for providing this envigorating experience.","Rastacouere","Aug 01, 2004"

4.7,10.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The aroma is woody, as well as sour & wonderful. I could smell this beer quite a bit. My first thought upon tasting is that this is a bit more acetic, and a bit more earthy than Rodenbach Grand Cru. It is of course nice & tart, and there is a hint of caramel sweetness to it. It is fruity up front but still quite dry. The finish is dry and tannic with a nice woodiness to it. Sharp is a good description for this beer. This is a wonderfully put together beer, and I can't wait for them to get the ATF approval so that they can ship this to my local. Quite impressive, and I think that I like this a bit better than the Rodenbach GC.","Gueuzedude","Apr 01, 2004"
4.37,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The beer as it pours from the bottle a bemused reddish-amber color, the head smallish in size, creamy in texture and the color a winsome light tan color, with the lace a fine velum like curtain to drape the glass. Nose is tart and simply reeks of over ripe fruit with a pleasing oak and earthy aroma ¬ìWOW¬î what a treat for the old schnozzle, start is tart and nicely malted with the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, hops delightful and accommodate the fruity tart sweetness quite well, very dry and long lasting aftertaste, what a magnificent beer it is a real treat, and one I wish was more readily available, hopefully soon is what I here, can¬ít wait to put some of these in my cellar.","Gusler","Mar 29, 2004"

4.73,11,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"So I've hear so much about Rodenbach, and I've gotten sick of hearing about how good it is, etc. So then I try this lovely beer, made by ex-Rodenbach brewer. Poured into a glass, a very nice reddish colour, I like that red colour. It smelled like sour cherries, had a little of that lambic farm aroma to it, interesting... and good. The first sip- great! My eyes went wide I think, and I do believe I smiled, yes. Sometimes that just happens, you know? It had a fruity taste and sour tartness that almost made me make a puckered sour face, but then the sweet cherry returned and it was beautiful. Spicy, like pie almost but not as sweet, more on the tart sour side. I loved it and finally realised what all the fuss about Rodenbbach was about, if this was similar! Mouthfeel was very soft and silky and drinkability was also great. I want more!","erica","Feb 11, 2004"
4.97,16.7,4.5,5,5,5,5,"All in all: This is a masterfull achievment. A very belgian-style wood aged beer, with all the characteristics of a classic...but at $18 a bottle, I have to feel robbed, knowing that Rodenbach is basically, just as good!","francisweizen","Feb 10, 2004"
4.55,6.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is sour and malty. A sour Flemish Red. Malts are prevalent, but the sour/tart flavor shines through on this beer. Tannic with a touch of fruitiness, raisins and apples. Well balanced. This is so very close to a Rodenbach Grand Cru its amazing. Perhaps the only difference is the La Folie is a little bit thinner in body. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is tart and sour. YUMMY !!","beerguy101","Sep 04, 2003"
3.84,-9.9,4,5,4,4,2,"Drank this at New Belgium BC when on a tour, out of a reserved bottle. Slightly hazy orange with caramel accents, forming a light beige head with fair retention and lacing. Aroma is the best part of this beer...musty, extremely tart and sour, the parotid glands kick into hyperdrive and I'm salivating all over myself. Fermented with Brett, there is some wet horse, but it's rather mild. The taste is extremely sour, like sweet tarts with extreme acidity, particularly citric, contributing to it's astringent mouthfeel. Crisp, bright, and fizzy. Malts are very distant, hops are non-existent, and the sourness is so extreme, it's like swallowing vomit. This is an interesting beer, but a poorly done, completely unbalanced, minimally drinkable sour brown...try Liefmans Goudenband or some Pertotale Faro instead.","Mitchster","Jun 13, 2003"
3.98,-6.6,3.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Originally sampled on 28 February 2003. This is a beer snob's beer. It's not for the wimpy BMC types. Nice brown color w/ hints of orange, this is a great example of a flemish sour ale. It starts out quite sour, but finishes slightly sweet. This certainly is not for everyone; I could never drink it as a session beer, but once in a while, you need to drink a beer of this class in order to fully appreciate the beer spectrum.","jcalabre","Jun 10, 2003"
4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"An American wood aged brew in the sour brown style. Just typing those words are enough to make me believe the world is a good place and the USA is producing just about any historical style possible. Buy these beers everyone, we need to keep all these examples alive and well. This one pours a dark amber with small, tan head. The aroma is sour fruit, maybe some raisin and plum in the backround. The aroma and flavor says ""lambic"" but this is not Belgium. So, I would say sour lemon meets mild brown malt is the flavor here. It is refreshing with a light sweetness in the middle, finishing dry and lemony. The texture is light to middle and it fills out a bit as it warms to room temp, with a bit more malt in the flavor. This is a real nice version of a difficult beer style.","jeffboo","May 19, 2003"

It was poured into a small goblet and i looked longinly at the hazy raisin-brown hazy color and foamy head.  The aroma is huge and malty with a sour and oak character.  I have never tasted anything like it before. The bold, musty sour tangy flavor is backed up by a smooth malt body and obvious oak aged twinge.  It is hard to truly describe the appeal of this beer to justice.","beernut7","Sep 22, 2002"
