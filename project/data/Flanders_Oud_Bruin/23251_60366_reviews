"Very interesting beer and lots of complexity to explore. There are very strong whiskey and wine flavours in this brew, and lots of fruitiness which makes for a very enjoyable drink. Despite the sourness, and slightly dodgy smell, it was a very enjoyable drink."

"definitely the lighter side of the oud bruin genre, much more lemony lacto than dark malt in here. there is almost no roast character to the grain at all, i taste no chocolate malt either, more like a soured copper ale. smells and tastes about the same, less dynamic or intriguing than the other loverbeer stuff, but loaded with sourness. the oak is there in the nose, but it does little to temper the intense lactic acidity in the swallow. grain profile seems too light for the style, and too light for the texture, its maybe a summer oud bruin, if such a thing exists, but i think it lacks a little depth on the malt front, despite tasting delicious. it really pops on the palate too, effervescent carbonation makes it drink right down. lingering dried fruit and oak on the palate is neat for such a light bodied beer too. definitely the most sour beer ive had from loverbeer, but also the least unique. well made, but there are better examples of the style, especially at this price."

"Pleased I had it, but one was enough."
"I had this with fruit and cheese and it was a nice complement to the food. The price is the only negative factor here. I would not pay 15-16 dollars for this beer."

"O-This is a pretty good take on an oud bruin. The oak is very obvious and this is a complex brew, but found it a little too malty and earthy when compared against the best examples of the style. The interesting thing was that despite the earthiness, the beer was still pretty acidic. Odd....anyway, a good beer but probably not worth the steep price."

"Overall, pleasant, and good, but probably too expensive for what it is for me to buy it again."

"More damp musty wood in the flavor, can't say it really works in the beer's favor (though it can be a potentially positive trait in the right amount). Mild tartness, fruity with a touch of cherry, it finishes dry and fairly nondescript... kind of just drops off. Pretty unimpressed by this, and for the price I probably won't be returning to LoverBeer's lineup any time soon. There are far better Oud Bruins out there."

"Pour is a cloudy brown with a thin light tan head. Nose is dusty and leathery with a strong tart cherry and light acetic acid. Taste is the same but less vibrant and bright. A little thin and watery in the finish with a touch of peppery spice lingering. Body is light and soft, lower carbonation and an oily finish."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of oak with light tart cherries note with a light acidic edge and some sour notes. Taste is a well balanced mix between some oak with good notes of sour cherries with light acidic notes. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Well brewed with nice complexity while retaining a good drinkability level."

"Madamin is a masterfully brewed and melded ale that makes me want to taste more sourness and earth flavor, but even those characteristics in this ale is more daft than is typical for oud bruins."
""
"Medium bodies with a tart, puckering mouthfeel that's decently tart/sour without becoming overly acidic/acetic.  Lots of toasted oak, sweet malt and vinous fruit for balance.  Vinegar acetic quality throughout but its cut by vanilla sweetness and dryness from the oak.  Sweet malts provide nice balance along with vinous grape, a strong tart cherry presence and other dark fruits."
"The pour is amber in color with an off-white head. Rather sweet aroma for a sour beer. Lots of berries and grapes with a strange butterscotch sweetness, too. Quite a lot of strawberry flavor on the palate, which is actually enjoyable. Mild to moderate tartness and acidity, a little bit of oak and straw, and very high carbonation. Despite the sweetness of the aroma, I found this to be enjoyable."
"Pours a figgy cherry brown, almost like a diaphonous cola. Little surface foam is light tan and carries little appeal. Nose is dry oak, sour apple, hints of yeast (?) like a French yeast - a bit nutty. Interesting. Up front cherry, moderately tart and slightly sweet. The yeast character is in here as well, kinda suits the sweetness a bit and offers a more complex approach to the style than many Oud Bruin's I've had. Seems to cut the oak dryness and bitterness I sometimes experience and dislike in the style. Full bodied and almost creamy with a slightly dry finish. This is an interesting beer and nice to try."

"I really enjoyed this. A great treat that I find has exceptional balance. A lot of beers in this vain are overly sweet and vinegary. This has a great balance of tart, fruit and grains. Love it, and perfect for a hot afternoon in NOLA."
"Poured a clear copper/brown color with a small, feisty head. You get some good lacto sourness in the nose, followed by mild malt and fruit flavors. The taste is a bit less sour than the smell, a more mild and pleasant version of the lacto funkiness with some berry fruitiness emerging. Mouthfeel was mild and pleasant again, with medium carbonation. Overall it was a very drinkable beer with good tart and lacto character."
""
"O - Overall this beer started out so good. very nice appearance and aromas, but really really falls flat on taste and mouthfeel. Such a disappointment."
""
"Pours a murky chestnut/mahogany with a thin white head. Sour and funk on the the nose, semi sweet fruits faintly shine through. Sour apples/ a bit of grain, and sour cherries, lots of sugar on the tongue and finishes on a wood or nut like note. Medium bodied, low carbonation, very sour and tart. Overall, this is a good sour, way to pricy in my opinion, but not a bad drink at all."
""
"O-this is a really good beer. is the price justified? no, not really. after the first few sips, the complexity loses itself. even though thats true, this is a fun beer to drink all the way through. every sip is quite enjoyable. this is an average example of this style"
""
"Poured a hazy, dark mahogany brown with a small, dense cap of beige head that retained and laced moderately. Aroma was light, with notes of fruit and funk. Taste was nice and full of non-threatening sourness, a bit acidic, a bit funky, notes of cherry and peach and red wine; woody and leafy mid-palate with a drying finish. Light-medium body, went down very easy, and was quite enjoyable."
""
"The beer has a slightly sweet/sour nose, but nothing that knocks your socks off. The taste is a rather reserved, a little funk and generic oud bruin flavors ie sour cherries and such. Nothing is too pronounced except the carbonation (which is almost excessive), and therefore it seems to have relatively good balance. This beer wasn't disappointing, but I'd rather try other things next time instead."
""
"Overall this is pretty good but that cost again tends to bring my assesment down even though it shouldn't. But hey, I am not made of money."
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy, brownish amber with pretty good head retention and light lacing. Really don't get a whole lot on the nose... just some light sour funk and underlying cherry. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but has a bit more to it. The beer actually has considerable sour (at least for me), that marries well with the fruit and wheat flavor I'm picking up. Mouthfeel is fairly light, and drinkability is definitely high. While I wish this beer had a bit more flavor, it's not terrible, and in fact is fairly enjoyable. The low alcohol is a definite bonus."
"A very different tasting Flanders Oud Bruin, kind of neat rather enjoyed it."
"On tap at ChurchKey poured into sampler glass. Pours hazy medium to dark amber beer with a fizzy off-white head. The aroma is lightly malty, very lightly hoppy, lightly to moderately yeasty, with notes of grape, oak, cherries, perhaps a touch of berries and citric fruits. The flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, long finish with light to medium bitterness. Elegant, complex, with a perfect palate."
""
"Overall: not too much taste, just sweet sour."

"Overall this was an interesting beer but for the cost(20 dollars for an 11 oz. bottle) I would rather drink a Cantillon."
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Another subtle sour from Italy. Cloudy amber with surprisingly long head retention but no lace. Lots of oak and sour fruit in the aroma. Taste is fermented sour apples and a touch of oak. Light body and lively carbonation. Some malt in the middle and light hop bitterness and a bit of alcohol on the finish."
"D - Overall, a very good sour beer; heavy on taste and light on mouthfeel characteristics; smooth and easy to consume, would go great with some strong flavorful food, like pasta with anchovies and capers"
"A bit of sourness in the end."
"Overall this was a very solid beer - complex with everything present in very good levels. Well worth a shot if you see it around."
