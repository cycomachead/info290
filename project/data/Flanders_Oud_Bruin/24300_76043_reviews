"Not for everyday drinking; has some nice elements but it doesn't quite have as much balance as others of the style I've had."

"D - A bit empty and rough. Needs a bit more depth and complexity for the style."

"Poured a brown-ish color with no lingering head to Three Philosphers stemmed wear. Smell is pungently sour upon being poured, vinegar, red grapes, cherry and wood. I think the nose was my favorite part of this. The taste is obviously acidic, very sweet, cherries, red grapes, some oak tannins. the most off putting part is an almost ashtray like flavor, not a fan and very evident. Mouthfeel is like red wine like, minimal carbonation, almost flat like. I enjoy a lot of sours and I think one falls somewhere near the bottom in overall enjoyment."
"Overall: Without the urine smell and the cough syrup taste... I think that this beer would be really good. The off flavors and smell really hurt this beer the most. I am not a huge fan, but to each his own. I would pass on this beer if I were you. Glad this was a bottle that was given to me, I might have gotten mad at myself if I had bought this beer."

"A decent beer. I like the way the fruit comes together with the acid."
""
"Overall, it doesn't really work. It has such weirdnesses to it that aren't integrated or explained with the other characters or as a whole. Probably one of my least favourite sours."

"I really am enjoying this. Its very unique."

"500ml bottle. Flute glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Bright brown copper. Slightly cloudy appearence. Beige quickly dissipated crown leaves a lasting collar. Fruity aroma with hints of green wood & white grape zest. Smooth acid upfront. Mildy toasted malt flavors with hues of cherries & red fruits. Light body, medium carbonation. Fruity finish & cask-wood notes. Well balanced flavors. Easy drinkability. Nice spot of the Style."

"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller stemmed tulip. Poured a massively dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, vinegar, tart, and subtle fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, peat, dark fruit, tart, vinegar, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really have to be honest that I did not expect this one to have a peat characteristic in it. Usually I despise peat, but this one actually incorporates it fairly well with the tart/vinegar aspect going on. Really wish there were a little more sweetness going on in this one. Let this one warm up and the vinegar tone isn’t as abrasive, just a hint. Worth trying if you get the chance, but that’s about it."
"O- a solid brew, the flavor profile is very nice, I wish some of the malts were a bit richer, but overall it is a good brew, I wish the price was a little lower, but worth trying"
"o - Down the drain this went for mike, scott, and myself. i just learned that this one cost $26!!!! What!?! you crazy, this MUST be a joke."
"Pours a murky, rusty amber color with a wisp of a head and little lacing. A film does sit on top for a while. Aroma light with vinegar, stone fruit, cherry pie, and damp rotting wood. Tastes much of the same but in a less ""bad"" way than the smell. Body and palate was pretty good, smooth silky and nicely LOW carbonated. Overall, not a great example of the style as there was not enough funk in some areas, too sweet in others and a bit of a mess in yet some more. I will say this though, it may be a decent introductory to someone who has never tried the style as it is mild with many of the different flavors that are usually found in the style."

"D- decent drinkability"

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and would probably pair well with an Insalata Caprese."

"If you love sours steer clear of this it's not worth the price."
"O - Just OK. Somewhat of a balance problem. Sour start, but then super sweet finish. Price is just way too high."
