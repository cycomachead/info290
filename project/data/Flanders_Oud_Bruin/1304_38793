3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and some spice aromas. Taste is much the same with some fruity flavors and a mild spice bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice earthy and spice flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 13, 2012"

3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall Impression- Not quite what I was looking for in an aged Oud Bruin, but maybe this is what happens to some? Still very nice and easy sour with a light brown ale background. Very smooth and above average for the style. Would like to try some of this fresh to compare!","DCon","Feb 05, 2012"

4.1,8.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours an opaque chocolate brown with a thin off-white head that leaves some good lacing. Rich, somewhat barleywine-like aroma has malty, nutty and sweet tones along with a hint of caramel. Flavor is malty and rather sweet, with caramel, nutty and honey undertones. Texture is lively and fizzy, overall very pleasing.","Cyberkedi","May 23, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit. Not the sourest beer but I enjoyed the little bit it had. I can kind of see how this could be a dubbel or a flander, as I saw a bit of each in it. Would love to try again sometime.","mdfb79","Beers"

3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Like liquid fruitcake! Nice balance of honey-drizzled malts, bread doughy yeast and fleshy mango & strawberry puree fruitiness. Mouthfeel is fantastically creamy, so smooth. ABV is well hidden. Spot on with many of the 'Brune'-style beers I have had. Fruity dubbel is not too far off either. Tasty stuff, does Pelican brew any bad beer?","twiggamortis420","Nov 13, 2009"
3.65,-3.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: A bit too one dimensional for my tastebuds; it has a nice, sweet character that really works for a dubbel but lacks a yeasty complexity","brentk56","Mar 12, 2009"
4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit slick with a nice bite of carbonation; a bit oily, but still very nice.","paco1029384756","Apr 07, 2008"
4.42,16.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Whew, VERY nice dubbel. I've tried other Belgian-styled ales crafted by Pelican and have been impressed; this, however, is probably my favorite yet. Rare to the point I've never seen this beer before on tap and have only heard of bottles offered at the brewery in Pacific City. If you like Belgians and have a chance to try it, Le Pelican Brun is a 'must'.","msubulldog25","Sep 24, 2007"
4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is high, really loving this right now. Those who prefer a more peppery, grainy style dubbel won't care for this (e.g. polar opposite of the Bornem dubbel), but if you like em on the sweet side, seek this out...I for one know I need to get my ass back to Pacific City pronto and grab a few more of these!","ccrida","Sep 24, 2007"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"pint at the Brewpub, outside in the late summer sun , beautiful. Dark brown, slighty hazed,small tan head, that stays. Aroma is definatlly yeasty, but with hints of burnt brown sugar and coriander. Spicy,complex yeasty, malt driven flavours,also a noticable sourness, which is very pleasing, its almost to the point of a Belgian Sour, but not quite. Very intrgueing. Very nice palate, thick and silky smooth, nicelingering flavours. Overall a very nice beer and a nice surprise.","Reidrover","Beers"
4.06,7.1,3,4.5,4,4,4,"The abbey dubbel style is not commonly duplicated by northwest brewers. But its not surprising that Pelican would deliver a worthy effort. A paucity of suds was the Bruns only notable shortcoming.","RedDiamond","0"
