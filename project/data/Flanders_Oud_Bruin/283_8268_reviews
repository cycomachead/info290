"Overall, really it's very good indeed. There's so much complexity, especially on the nose and on the front of the palate, and the lightness on the back really aids the drinkability. For a 5% beer, it's impressive the amount of flavour that's packed in: it's a lesson to anyone who thinks that *only* is bigger better. I liked it a lot."

"Overall Impression: A darker and more malt driven brother of the Flanders Red. Skirts line between wine and beer with obvious dark fruit character but adds toffee and malt sweetness."

"O: a classic example of the style, not very complex, but clean and pure"

"Body is medium to medium-light with carbonation levels of fairly low intensity, resulting in a beer that is very smooth across the palate, allowing for the mild acidity to move this across the palate. Closes fairly dry, with little to no residual stickiness lingering on the palate."
""
"Pours a murky brown with very little head. Scant lacing down the glass. The smell is sweet biscuit with some vegetal notes. The taste is very nice: clean minerals, an earthy tang, and some robust sweet malt. It's a little under-carbonated, but very smooth. All in all a very fine example of the style. Too bad it's so hard to find."

"The Goudenband is a more sophisticated, complex expression, but this is a satisfactory, less expensive version."

"D - This beer finds the sweet spot between the overly sweet Belgian offerings (read: Lindemans) that many are familiar with and the more traditional sour Flanders Reds... Not the most complex Flanders, but a very approachable one that could appeal to the masses... A very nice beer all around that I would gladly drink again... (FYI - My wife was a huge fan as well...)"
"I dont really see a head at all. Its got a body reminiscent of cherry juice, and an aroma to boot. The smell is loaded with cherries. Sweetened sour cherries all the way. The taste follows suit. Sour cherries with a good bit of funk to come in late. This beer wants to beer sour, yet still wants to be a super sweet Kriek."

"O- Looking for more distinct flavors but overall it was a good beer."

"O: This beer is not good, but is also not entirely wretched. It lacks depth and substance, and is obviously not brewed with the fan of traditional Flemish oud bruins in mind. Most oud bruins are lactic and sour with just a hint of sweetness. This beer is sweet and oddly toasty with a subtle hint of vinegar sourness. I imagine mixing a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale with a traditional Flemish oud bruin would produce a very similar effect. If you have to try this beer, use it as an accompaniment to food. Otherwise, stick with Liefmans Goudenband and the sour brown ales brewed by Verhaege."
"O: The beer is easy to drink because it’s not overly tart or sour."

"The quintessential oud bruin?"
"Fruity tart flavor upfront, a caramel middle, then a dry finish. Light bodied, creamy and mildly tart. Feels a little dead, like flat soda in the finish. Tangy, not overly sweetened thankfully. Decent, not great. More of a ""training wheels"" Oud Bruin, not a lot of depth here, and pretty restrained sourness. It does attempt to be somewhat traditional, but still feels a bit over processed and watered down for the masses."
"Overall: Rather sweet when compared to other Oud Bruins I have tasted; not sure I would seek out again"
"Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D - I've yet to find a sour beer that was sessionable but this is fairly close. Given that I would probably drink this sparingly in order to better appreciate it"
"The beer gives me the impression of Sour Patch Kids candies where there's really two different sets of characteristics in the glass: there's a solid Sour Ale and then there's a malty sweet ale that seems a bit like Rochefort 10. But with only moderate intensity, neither are able to command the beer."
"O - I was really in the mood for something sour, but this didn't quite cut it. Nicely balanced, however, just nothing spectacular. It would probably make a nice gateway beer for getting into the sour realm."
"Overall: Smooth with a good amount of sourness. I enjoyed the fruit notes, reminded me of raspberries a little bit."
"Really drinkable especially at 5%. Balanced between the sweet and sour."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a vibrant red brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, wood, sour, tart, and very slight funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, wood, raspberries, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Definitely not my favorite from the style but still pretty good. I like how this brew incorporated tart cherry and raspberry into the flavor as this made it much more palatable than some harsher Oud Bruins I have had in the past. A definitely well done brew that I would definitely drink again given the opportunity."
"Overall: Never had this style before. Very nice and refreshing beverage."
"Beer is really thin and kind of flavorless, it is mildly acetic and has his sweetness to it, a little oaky but overall really boring. I won't have it again."
"Surprisingly sour and not very sweet; nothing like the nose. The finish has some sugar showing up and the sourness becomes more muted. The aftertaste is short-lived. The body is typical; the carbonation is on the lighter side."
"I thought it on the fizzy side, which I believe is not normal in this style, but it added a new dimension to the tasting, which I enjoyed."
"25 cl bottle with same label shown in the picture, got this in a trade over a year ago, poured into my Three Philosophers glass tonight, color is medium to dark red, 3/4 inch soapy off white head, some retention, not much lacing, aroma has cherries, red grapes, vanilla, sweet oak, cherries, sweet malts, brown sugar, and toffee, flavor starts off with a nice sweeet and sourness with crisp carbonation, slightly sour in the middle as well with lots of cherries, big fruity finish with a bit of tart but a more rounded sugary sweet taste, vanilla and sweet malts come out more as it warms, sweet, sour, and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate level of carbonation, taste lingers decently, could drink a lot of this stuff, went down very easy and was very refreshing, warmed up well and was smooth, one of the only beers I have tasted from Liefmans but quite good and wish I had more to try cellaring, would drink again, worth trying"
"D: I'd drink a lot more if I wasn't driving as much."
"A very nice summer beer that I wish was more readily available."
"Perhaps the best oud bruin I've ever tasted. Still not my favorite style, but there's no denying, this beer is impressive."
"Notes: Overall this was very enjoyable."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Flanders Oud Bruin."
"Pours a very dark chocolate brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is oaky and tart with a nice balance of chocolate maltiness. Nicely balanced, with a solid roasted maltiness complimenting the tart earthy oak sourness. Quite good."
"The beer poured a brownish copper color a 1/2 inch head that runs quickly. The nose was sour, slight citrus. Taste was damn fine. A refreshing sour Flemish red taste that I haven't had in awhile. Sweet in the mouth but balanced. The beer is on the light side and refreshing."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with pretty good retention. Aroma of sugar and tart cherries is quiet interesting. Taste is very refreshing with a well balance sourness covered by some sugar and some oak. Definitely not as great as Rodenbach Grand Cru but very interesting nonetheless and I would love to have access to this as a session ale for those hot summer days."
"Thick mattress of foam lasting on a dark brown color body. The smell is lightly tart for a oud bruin, showing more round malty notes and fruity notes, red fruits on one side and citrus in the carbonation in the other. In the taste too, the tart aspect isnt overwhelming. The maltiness is made more round by the fruity tart notes that appear after a second with light wooden notes. Mouthfeel isnt unpleasing, but a bit watery for the style. A oud bruin that seems to try to attract to the masses, and that succeeds."
"Exceptional drinkability. I wish I had a keg of this one. Much better than I was expecting, and quite similar to its kindred, Flanders Red ales, but a bit more complex with a noticeable malt underbelly."
"The aroma was promising, sour cherry, dusty and old. However there was an unexpected amount of sweetness in the aroma. Sweet chocolate, dark fruit to start, with only a hint of sour cherries or vinous characters. Not what i'd hoped for, but still tasty anyway."
"Good and drinkable, but weak. Where's my Rodenbach?"
"25 cl bottle."
"Not great compared to others of its kindred, but in a bar I would get a second round of this. Very soupy thin but drinkable because of it. This is not that bad of a beer."
"Pours with an average sized light brown head that reduces to a rather nice lace. The color is very brown with a few reddish highlights. Theres a very slight hazy. There is a slight malt aroma with no real hops noticeable. Aromas of cherry, wine, and oak are also present. Ive read someplace that this is used as a base for Liefmans Kriekbier, and if this is true, it definitely seems like it would lend itself to this task. The start is light and sweet with cherry notes. Oaky, wine notes pick up a bit and finishes tart and dry. The tartness of the finish lasts for quit a while. The carbonation is rather soft, and the body is somewhat watery at times. No alcohol is noticeable. A fairly drinkable brew, but not one that I would prefer to drink on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: I got this as an intro to the style. I'd say it did it's job well in that regards, but I'll think I'll move on to bigger and better. I didn't get tired of it and could have stood to have had another had I purchased one."
"Brilliantly clear garnet hue, topped by a meager, spotty,.soapy head. Laceless. Sugary caramel and ripe pruneish esters dominate the aroma, with cidery tartness and hints of sour, damp oak adding a secondary contrast. Akin to a sour ESB in aroma. Very odd. Mellow lactic tartness incipient in flavor is promptly superceded by obtrusive dark candi sugar sweetness, which overrides the understated tart, woody undertone. Lanky malt backbone manages a vapid bread like note. Horsey, enteric notes do manage to poke through the dominant sugar presence, lending a sweetened, soured old ale impression. Thin in body, yet with a sticky, sucrose rich mouthfeel that weighs on the palate. Finishes with a slight augmentation of lactic tartness that's too little too late. An odd, unbalanced brew, in which the addition of sugar masked most microflora derived complexity. As the palate adjusts, Oud Bruin falls short in delivery overall, but isn't wretched. My initial impression was that it was. Stick with Liefman's Goudenband and their lambics."
"The colour of this beer is a dark brown-red, with mahogany reflexes. A beautiful head, soft and compact, but not persistent. Smell of fresh must, grapes and even sour black cherry. These is a probable addition of sugar, and this spoils the complexity of the beer. Even at the taste, the sweet is too high. The taste is less ""strong"" the the flavour (maybe the sugar...). It results not well balanced. Maybe you can fell a very little note of tartness, but very very light..."
