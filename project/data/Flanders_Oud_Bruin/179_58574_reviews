"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, cherry, and funk aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour malt and cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is solid but fairly mild for a sour."

"Bright and easy. Fruit more than wood. A skilled take on a difficult style."

"Dope label - amber-orange body. Aromas of acidic and tart cherry, oak, funk. Not extremely sour - notes of vinegar, acidic fruit, cherry, wood, peach. Seems to have aged pretty nicely - nice tartness and solid oak/fruit interplay"

"Overall: This is a superbly drinkable beer, it is high on alcohol for the style, but still maintains drinkability. Although I did not have it young, I imagine one would find it to have aged well, there is very little to complain about with this brew."
"O: Glad that I picked this up. Definitely gets better as it warms. A tasty Oud Bruin, would love to try the cerise version."

"Overall, awesome brew! Maybe the best I have had of 2012. This brew is perfectly balanced w/ sour/sweet/spices."

"Poured a turbid ruddy brown with practically no head. Smell was acetic with notes of cherries and wood, slightly funky, but mainly leaning towards the sour side. Sour with a nice cherry profile, reminiscent of La Folie with the acetic acid qualities. Not overly puckering, but nice. Sour and fruit were definitely the highlights here. A very nice sour beer that would probably benefit from a little more time in the cellar. Starting to hit its stride, and very enjoyable."

"Overall, a decent beer with a lot of good flavors. Easy drinking. A medium level of complexity."
"O: A nicely done sour. I've wanted to try this and the cherry version, and was pleased that they were as good as I had hoped."
"Overall: A touch too acetic but good nonetheless."
"Le Serpent came to me looking bronzish/ tanned brown with some orange highlights, a bit of white foam on top, not much stick. Smell is of a bugged up beer. Lacto springs out along with some funk and berry scents. A bit of lighter citrus and wild yeast strains, alot of them. Holy moly this is sour. Le serpent has yeast, lacto/brett, with cherry, white grape, some vanilla from the wood and it's sour, bracingly so. There is alot going on, hard to nail it down. Feel is light but pretty spritzy and effervescent. kinda ruff, bitey and puckering. Even with the rough feel of this, i could drink a whole lot more of it."
"I believe this was the regular, non-cerise version. Poured rust orange with a medium head. Vibrant nose of berries, orange skin, lime, just a lot of pleasant citrus in the nose. Really bright flavor with great citrus especially lime, citric acidity. Sharp, bright, fruity, sour. In a way reminds me of some Russian River stuff with the light, champagne like body and refined citrus acidity. T20, even? Good stuff."
"This one gets a low (but virtually irrelevant) drinkability score due to the funky, sour, earthy, and dry character of the style. They really took the souring agents (brett and cherry) to the max. This took the gold in sours at the GABF and deserves it. Really pushes the envelope on what ""sour"" beer really means. I drank this beer while it was on tap and it was exceptional. It had a much more attractive tan head at the time so I thought it fair to judge the appearance based on that. Although, I just drank the bottle that I've had in the cellar for a year and the appearance had decreased. The Le Serpent has turned into an aromatic and flavorful powerhouse. The first sip was like a giant pissed off cherry punched me square in the chops. It definitely brings the funk on the nasty dunk."
