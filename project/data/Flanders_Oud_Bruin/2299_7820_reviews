"This was a strange one to rate. Started off awesome, big deep dark pour, chunky meaty head, smell was that nice vinegery (sp?) bitter nose, kinda getting pumped because it's smelling great....than the taste, light vinegar, big dry bitterness, very dry. But to be honest, it has that RR Supplication dryness, so if you like that, mixed with a Duchesse, your pumped, but for me, mouthfeel lost me, sorry."
"D- I can drink this stuff all night long- I guess another trip to Belgium is in order!"
"D: I didn't finish it."
"This is not a good Oud Bruin. There is far too much sweetness and is almost cloying rather than crisp, flavourful and tart."
"Bottle. $4.99 for a 11.2oz bottle. No date I could find on the bottle but the cap says 29-09-2014 which I am guessing is the best by date. Poured a fairly dark reddish brown with an offwhite 2 finger head that quickly dissipates down to about a 1/4 of an inch and then just flat out disappears. The aroma is not sour at all. The nose is actually pretty bad, not bad smelling, but there really isn't a whole lot there. Oh dear god, this is not very good. It has a subtle bitter taste that is off putting. Subtle fruit taste. Not sour really at all (did I say that already?) Can't imagine really finishing this one. Slight alcohol flavor at the end. Light/medium mouthfeel. I would avoid this one, especially at the price. Tried again and same results as above."
"Overall not bad, but certainly not the best in the style."
"D: Good example of the style, pleasant and drinkable."
"Overall, I don't mind this, but I wish this was more sour and more oak was present. It started out drinking slow, but as I worked my way through the bottle, it got a little better."
"M&D: very smooth, the soft carbonation lasts throughout the drink against a medium-plus body. This Oud Bruin is not quite stale like any well-aged ale or lactic/sour-fruity as my last bottle, ""Bockor Bellegems Bruin", but is deliciously fruity and still balanced with a pretty good dose of malts - overall, simply easy-drinking~~"
"this ale poured like a red ale dark copper and had the same appearance as one..the smell was of earth, oak , and peat and fruits.. hard to describe the style.. the taste was very good it was earthy followed by an oak and yeast hit with some fruit and some clove tastes..this was not an overpowering ale but a nice easy drinking ale at a low abv..will buy again only comes in the 750ml bottle where i live. a great style to try buy it if you can find it"
"This is only my second sour Oud Bruin, so I am fairly new to the style. The smell was a little ""off putting"" in the beginning, but as the beer warmed, it started to smell like sour candy and ripe citrus fruits. The taste was a bit similar, but more on the sour candy. It also had a nice warming feel as it went down the throat. This is one of those beers that the alcohol isn't very strong in it, but you would guess it's much higher than it is. I hope I can find more of these styles of beers around Charleston. I really want to start trying more of these."
"I am not sure how many of these I could drink but one or two would do the trick..."
"More or less a standard Oud Bruin, not too out of the box, but fairly enjoyable."
"nicely with just about everything except desserts."
"Drinkability: So much going on I didn't want to set the beer down."
"Served in a wine glass at Spuytin Duyvil in Brooklyn. Dark reddish brown pour with some nice burgundy red highlights. Very thin, white head that didn't stick around for long. To the unware, this looked just like a glass of wine. Strong dark fruit aroma with hints of balsamic vinegar. A little hint of a wine/oak aroma as well. This beer tastes almost exactly like it smells. Initially it was a pleasant sour vinegar flavor with some nice dark grape flavors. After the initial blast of sour was a perfectly balanced oak wood flavor. Slightly sweet too. Sooo delicious. Sometimes I find wood flavors to be a little overwhelming but this was great. Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with mild carbonation. Very drinkable as I had three of them that night."
"Big in flavor, but a bit thin in mouthfeel. I wouldn't want to drink much more than 25cl of this -- I could see it getting a bit cloying fast."
"Had this beer at Monk's Cafe on Sunday as part of the Michael Jackson Flemish Sour dinner. This was beer # 2. The beer poured a deep brown color into a wine glass. There was a slight tan head that ran away rather quickly. The aroma of this good looking beer was sour and funk. The taste was a nice sweet sourness and a bit acidic. After a few more sips of this I get some raisin and malts but overall this a sour beer that is enjoyable."
"Drinkability: while i didn't enjoy this beer, i must say, i was battling a small cold at the time. Definitley another sampling is in order."
"Overall: A reasonable effort at a Flanders Old Brown, and although it is made from 20% aged ale, it is still a tad too sweet for my liking. Maybe placing this in a dark cupboard for a year would lessen the sweetness a tad. If it did, it would improve the beer immensely. Still, it is a very nice example of a Flemish old Red/Brown that I would like to drink again if I get the chance."
"Carefully poured it's surprisingly clear, although there are flecks of yeast in suspension. The color is an appropriate reddish-brown with crimson highlights when held to the light. The thin, light tan head drops quickly to a modest collar, although it does leave some minor spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma is quite vinous with some distinct lactic sourness. The flavor starts tart and sweet at the front of the tongue and becomes quite fruity (currant, black raspberry) as it warms. In the finish a dull bitterness lays at the back of the throat amongst fading sticky & sweetish malt.These bottles have been aged quite for a few years and they seem a bit smoother than I remember. Quite interesting with a good level of compexity and a refreshing character."
