"Overall: probably the first Tired Hands beer I have been disappointed by. there are a lot of good flavors but it is lacking. the carbonation is low and this could but a bad effect on the taste."

"Overall: Really good and really interesting. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms and I still liked it quite a bit. Definitely worth trying if you're a fan of either mushrooms or sour brown ales."

"Wasn't expecting a lot from this, Im not a fan of mushrooms but tried it anyways.  WOW this thing is spot on. Smells like woods and slight amount of acidity.You get a lot of Earth and dirt coming through probably from the mushrooms. It's really well rounded and has great mouthfeel, pretty high carbed. No acetobactor coming through and no harshness at all just a straight tart pleasant sourness. Tired Hands nails it again with this one"

"This was just a strange beer. It was only slightly sour and then it had an earthy finish. It was a strange combination and as I got further down the glass it got worse. It was somewhat of a struggle to finish this off. I didnt really taste any Shitake in this beer at all either."
