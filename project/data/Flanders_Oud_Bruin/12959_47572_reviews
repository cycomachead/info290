"Batch number 4. Tasty tasty tasty!!! Tastes of sour cherry and tart raspberry. Delicious!!!"
"Batch 4. Brown and sanguine. Getting bing cherries, quality funk, grape must. Velvety smooth, flavor drops a bit but not bad."

"An okay sour. Biggest problem I have is that it doesn't have that much variety of flavor. It's straight-up sour, but a sort of dirty sour, with a bite to it that I don't like. Not my favorite, and not something I'd seek out again."

""

"One of the best sours I've ever had, it's really well balanced, and really complex."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but slightly one dimension in its sourness."

"O/D-I enjoyed Rosso E Marrone. It is sure to please any lovers of Wild Ales. I don't I will get to try this again but would absolutely love to sit down and nurse a whole bottle to see how it changes with some warmth."

"O. Sadly not what I wanted it to be. A good lambic impression but just a little off"
""
""
"Superb blend of Flanders vinegar, fruit Lambic and Brett funky feels. One of the most sour brews I can think of in recent memory. Feels like a great mix of a Lambic and a Flanders Bruin."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from this beer. I figured it'd be good, but it's great. I'd be hard-pressed to find a better Oud Bruin (not even just an american one). Truly phenomenal. I want more."
""
""
"Pours hazy ruby, small off-white head and decent lacing. Very beautiful in the glass. Aroma is tart lemon, oaky, cherry, vinous, funk, basement. Flavor is initially sweet and fruity with light tartness and a bit of oaky astringency. Dries out on the finish leaving oaky and vinous notes behind. Medium body, very low carbonation."
"O - Good Flanders ale with a good amount of tartness and not a ton of the copper and blood you sometimes get with a Flanders. Thought this one was well balanced and would have went well with some earthy cheeses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of sours with a big ABV and this is really no exception. Seems to clash with the sourness and funk a bit. Still a fairly enjoyable beer, but considering the price tag and the much better examples out there, I might pass on this in the future."
""

""

"Verdict: A very nice American interpretation of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Tart and tangy, but not sour and mouth puckering. Very complex and rewarding, but needs body. I can only imagine how wonderfully this will age. A very, good beer."

""
""
""

"The body was good, I, maybe, would have preferred it a touch more full, but it was still nicely solid across the palate. The beer had a semi-dry finish, with the tartness lingering. Drinkability was very good, I could see having these on a semi-regular basis if it were local to me. Overall, an excellent brew. A must try if you get the chance."
""
"M - Medium body. Dry. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
"This is a really well balanced beer with its tartness, oak, and sweetness. The alcohol is extremely well hidden on this."

"O: fantastic brew - tart, dark wet Flanders Oud Bruin wine-ified with grape and vineyard characteristics. Splendid; felt very much like I was drinking a very fine wine/rare ale hybrid."
"Overall an amazing Oud Bruin. A must try for any sour fan. Complex, tart and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A really nice Flanders style brew with the grape addition shining through almost like it was a wine hybrid. Really nice stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's thick for a medium body, pretty rich and with some depth. Crispness cuts through that, and carbonation is at a good level and just a little foamy at times. Oak dries it out a little, as well as the vinous nature, but the acidity doesn't thin it and it's fairly smooth, considering. All in all, this is fantastically tasty with so much depth."
""
""
""
""
"O- This wasn't the best Oud Bruin that I've had, but it was definitely a very good attempt at one. The grape must made a nice presence combined with a decently balanced cobwebby funk. Overall however the tastes just didn't appeal to me as much as other Oud Bruins have but I'd have to say this is one of the better American attempts out there. Definitely worth trying and I wish I had another to see what a couple years of age could do to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - interesting wild ale. If i had to guess i would think the carbonation will subside over time making this even more wine like. I've got a few bottles to test theory in a few years."

"Shared a bottle with my wife, pours red a deep red, very nice. The nose is tart apples, cherries and oak. The taste is very pleasant not over the top, in the sour category, tart and slight Brett funk, . The back is oak and a nice berry flavor. My wife loves this beer, it is nice"
"O- A very tasty sour, the booze is literally invisible, I would never have guessed it was as strong as it is. Captain Lawrence has really been hitting the acidity perfectly too, although this doesn't have the same level of complexity as Cuvee de Castleton, it's still a really good beer."
"O: A nice American Oud Bruin. More mellow than I'd like. I'm a fan of CL sours for their big oak and acid punch. Hopefully the acidity picks up on this one over time."
""
""
""
"O. A nice, mild oud bruin. I was expecting something a little more acidic but nonetheless this was quite pleasant to drink."
""
"Had the 2012 release. Just a very well balanced beer. Great tartness with an excellent grape taste. I am hoping this ages well. The color reminds me of many other sour type beers. Taste sits in the mouth for the right amount of time without leaving any aftertaste. Great beer to try if you can find it."

"M: High carbonation. Medium bodied."
""
""
"O: A fruity beer with a great sweet-tart balance and some oak character. Pairs very nicely with food, probably a great compliment to a rich meal. An excellent sour beer that is well worth seeking out should you enjoy yous beer a bit on the tart side. It's not so tart as to be out of line and is well worth consideration as a classic example of the style."

"The feel is ok, definitely sharp and under carbonated in some ways. Decent body to it. Overall decent beer but not amazing."
""
""
"Pretty yummy Flanders. Quite true to style. Great vinous notes. Grape skin tannins and some good slight grape juice notes plus some earthy wood and a nice vinegary tartness that isn't too intense."
""
""
""
"#1600 finally!! Seems like it took forever between 1500 and 1600."
""
"O: Overall this beer is pretty easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden considering the strength. Upfront there is a sharp acidic tartness but that fades a bit as the beer warms up."

"The beer is hazy chestnut brown with a thin tan head. Audible hissing as the head rapidly fades. The aroma is grand, offering plenty of sourness and funk, with prominent yeast, fruits, caramels, bread. Sharp and biting feel, but not unpleasant. Certainly acetic though. A nice beer to sip and savor with a friend or two. Double digit alcohol is disguised quite well. A really solid beer, though not for everyone."
"This is the style of beer that I LOVE and while Captain Lawrence got it right from the flavor, to the smell and appearance .. .the price is way TOO high. I figured I'd try it as it is locally brewed but you should save the cash and buy some Goudenband or Monk's instead"
"Trade bottle. Batch #4 and my first Captain Lawrence. Thanks!!! Pours a cloudy red with a big pink head that dissipates quickly. Smell is very sour cherry and vinegar. Beautiful sour cherry flavor with dry oak and a hint of sour grape. Much creamier mouthfeel than I have had from a sour. Prickly carbonation and a long lasting sour on the palate. No ABV content but there seems to be a bit of warmth on this. Good brew."

"Just a great beer. Refreshing and crisp. With a restorative dry quality that is wonderful I had it with pizza new and it was great, a spicy cheddar aged an it is superb. A beer for all seasons and reasons."
"Dark rusty-brown pour, with a small cap of foamy, off-white head. Lactic and acetic aroma, cherry, red wine, mildly earthy. The flavor reflected the aroma well, tart but balanced and not very puckering, sour cherries, red wine, tolerably acetic, not too woody, but there was a slight leathery quality to it, with subtle funk undertones and maybe even a dusting of cocoa powder (from the use of some darker malts, I'd assume). Medium body, moderate to low carbonation, and a nice drink overall."
""
""

""
"O: Excellent beer, wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not sure I'll ever fully love Oud Bruins, even though I love most sours and funky beers. There is just a harsh aspect to them, but this one is definitley one of the better ones I've had. Certainly worth a try."
""
""
"O: A very good Oud Bruin, right up there with La Folie for sure. Would love to have a bunch of this sitting around to open whenever I wanted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is still quite flat and has a significant sweetness compared to the dank, dry, acetone base I remember. There is also a bigger wine barrel presence and bitterness similar to an iced black tea. Different beer, I look forward to laying a few bottles down to dry out and age"
""
""
""
""
"O - Very unique and tasty, with a lot of depth. The 10% really doesn't make itself known. Luckily, the sourness makes you sip this one slowly anyway."
"Dry and cidery, grapes and acetic acid. Medium bodied, not all that funk forward or complex, but it's good. Would take La Folie or a similar Flanders over this though, not really worth the extra effort to seek out."
"O: I've never had an oud bruin that was this big and robust, but it drank like it was much lighter. Very solid and glad I was able to get to try this."
""
"O: eh. nothing special. out of balance. 3"
""
""
"Batch 3. Pours a murky reddish-brown color with a medium white head that diminishes very quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely red wine vinegar and nice tart aromas with some tart, red grapes. Quite funky...at least more funky than I was expecting. The Brett has done some good thing for the nose of this beer. Very sharp tart cherry/grape aromas with a good amount of wood/oak. Lovely nose. Taste is just as nice. At first it drinks like a burguny with some strong, somewhat tart, dark flavors. Then you get a good amount of sour grapes, which immediately turns to cherry sweetness. Very sour, vinegar-like beginning, with a smooth sweet cherry finish. Lovely oak flavors throughout, especially in the center of the palate. As the beer warms, the barrel really comes through with lovely oak flavors. You can definitely tell this is one of the higher ABV sour beers, but would never guess it to be as high as 10%! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a tingly, somewhat puckering carbonation. Drinkability is scary high for a 10% beer. Overall, this is a great Oud Bruin beer. Love the complexities of if."
"This is quite an excellent beer, and is full of complexity. The grapes, acidity and malt sweetness play well w/ one another, making a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Tasty and intriguing. The balance of cola, tartness and funk is out of control. A real winner from Captain Lawrence."
"Overall this is quite a good beer, don't get me wrong, but there is nothing special about it. It's super balanced, which I usually like in my beers, but for the limited availability, I was expecting it to pop a little more. While good, I cannot recommend this unless this style is your absolute favorite and you ""need"" to try every example you can find. There is just nothing special here for me to need to revisit anytime soon, good just didn't meet my expectations."
"O: Rough around the edges but I actually really liked the flavor. Gross looking beer though."
"Drink- I can't thank Chad and Josh enough for the gift for being a trustee. This beer was so damn good. Layers upon layers and it did it effortlessly. I want it again."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I haven't had a sour in quite some time, and this one took a little warming up to. I'd sat on it for a long time, because I read (somewhere) that, at the time of its release and shortly thereafter, it wasn't drinking ""as good"" as batch 1 had been. So I sat patiently on it for over two years, but with no point of reference all I can say is that this is drinking at about a ""3.5/4.5/4.0/4.5/4.0"" right about now. At 10.0% abv, 500 mL is just about right. Best sour I've ever had? Not close. Great beer? Most definitely."
""
"O - I liked this beer quite a bit. Easy to drink, has a nice flavor profile. If you're looking for a solid sour beer this one is quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark rusty red brown. Tart grapes and cherries. Wine barrel influence is strong. Some of the base brown can be picked out. Flavors are mostly mild sour cherry and oak. Lactic sour along with moderate vinegar. The brown comes through in the finish. The high ABV is hidden well. Medium body. Not bad but not world class in my opinion."
""
""
"Between this and CDC, I've become a full convert to the glory of Capt Lawrence. Not missing another release, that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"375 ml bottle. Batch 2. Thanks for sharing Phyllis. Pours a cloudy brownish amber with no head. The aroma is big grape, some light brett, some caramel sweetness, and some lactic acid. The taste is sweet and quite sour. Big grape, some lactic and acetic acid, and a light brett funkiness. The finish is moderately dry with a bit of earthiness. Medium body. Low carbonation. It definitely could have used some more carbonation. Not bad, but nothing special."
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer; another great sour from Captain Lawrence. Just a ton of sour red grapes and dark fruits, as wel as brett, which is perfect to me. Would love to get more bottles of this and will definitely be trying to go up to CL next time it is released. I think I prefer cDc a tiny bit more than this one, but this is probably up there with Barrel Select batch 1 as the second best CL beer I've had."

"Overall: This is a really tart sour beer. The taste was nice and smooth given the abv. Didn't really pick up any alcohol. The smell took this down a notch for me."
"Overall, Brett can be a funky proposition. I wish it were a little less prevalent here as it's slightly distracting. Otherwise, this is an interesting take on a Flanders Oud Bruin and an experience I'm happy to have had."
"Overall: This is simply delicious."
"O: yet another delicious sour that is out there. The abv seems a bit high than other comparable brews, however, the added ABV is not noticeable."
"(D)- Another great sour from Captain Lawrence. Would be fun to see how this ages, though I do not know when I will see another bottle."
"O: small but absolutely perfect doses. A shining example of the of the American Wild ale."
"I'm relatively new to sours and this is my second Flanders Oud Bruin, the first being Petrus Aged Pale. I was expecting it to be a bit more effervescent, with a giant head. Once I got past the appearance I really enjoyed this beer. I'm not a fan of wine at all, but Rosso E Marrone blends the taste perfectly in a great sour, I will seek this one out."
"Overall: Even with the bracing tartness this is a very good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's complex and delicious for those who like this style which has additional elements above and beyond a Flanders Old Bruin, especially the funk."
"Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one during one of our weekly tastings. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grape, sour, tart, earthy, funky, and must. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, vinegar, funk, earth, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one was definitely complex in both the aroma and flavor. The vinegar in this one added a very nice touch when coupled with the funky/earthy character here. A really nicely done brew that I'm glad I got the chance to try. I suggest you do the same."
"Overall, a great American interpretation of an oud bruin. The grape addition is a bit over looked by the acidic flavors that turn into more of a tart cherry flavor. Not overly complex but definitely delicious. Recommended."
"Rosso – murky brown, almost orange…very thin head. Sweet tart all day. Some other fruits, but mostly tart. Delicsious, but super tart. Very good, very good. Well crafted with a balanced body. overall worth checking out."
"O - Wow! I love this beer. I'm a big fan of flanders and oud bruins. This is just amazing. Extremely well made American wild. I've just got to appreciate the amount of time and dedication that Captn. Lawrence put into this beer. This is going back onto my wants list!"
"This beer pours with a cloudy reddish-amber hue to the body and a dirty white foam on the surface. The aromatics are stocked with lots of raspberry notes some dark fruits but there is a lingering tart smell as well. The flavor confirms the tartness, but I must say this rivals no fruit sours that I know. I must say that I rather enjoy this white grape flavor and raspberry plum tartness. There is a distinct finish here in my mind that says there is vanilla and brown sugar on the palate. Honestly I feel this is a well crafted beer. For it's style it has all the requirements. It's overall extraordinary because it carries a certain je ne sais quoi. Enjoyable and I would seek it out again."
"It tastes a bit more complex than it smells, grapes coming in with the cherries, both acidic and sweet. Medium carbonation, very easy drinking. I was very glad for the chance to try it, thanks again Mike!"
"O: Sours are not my go to style and I am a bit of a fish out water trying to describe them. But I found this to be an enjoyable drink, quite complex and while the sourness was present, it was neither overwhelming nor distracting."
"Batch #3. I've been looking forward to trying this brew for some time now. It pours a cloudy amber-auburn topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises tart raspberry, ruby red grapefruit, mandarin orange, very light caramel, light brown sugar, red grapes, blueberry, currant, cinnamon, nutmeg, and light white vinegar. The taste holds notes of sour raspberry, green apple, pomegranate, very light brown sugar-cinnamon, plum, and vinegar. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice brew, something very complex and interesting to drink."
"Late 2010 opened a batch 2 bottle, and it was completely flat and had these weird globs floating through the bottle."
"While I prefer a few other examples of the style, this has attributes of an Oud Bruin as well as an American Wild, a subtle originality which distinguishes it from its peers."
"Making an Oud Bruin is a difficult beer. It is hard to pull off in general and this is a great example of one. I really like this beer. It is thin and bright, acetic and tannic. Very nice finish, mildly dry. I'd have it again, looking forward to tasting the other vintages and releases."
"Overall- Great beer, love the wine flavor. But, I would prefer La Roja and a few others in the flanders and Bruin/brown ale style."
"4.5 D: This is a very good beer. Until now, I've never really been impressed by CL. Complex throughout with great flavors and a killer mouthfeel."
"O: Very nice, one of the best sours I've had recently."
"D - Pretty tasty, and the booze is well hidden."
" O- This is a high quality sour brown that CL has put together. Its soft and very complex. Wonderful example of the style."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink because the sour flavors are not that strong and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"SkÅL!"
"O: Great, awesome tart fruit, sour and wild funk with good malty balance."
"-GFunk"
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew! Could have easily drank another bottle or two myself. Glad I picked up my total alotment at the release, as some time in the cellar should tone down the sour and bring on the funk."
"(375ml bottle courtesy of zestar!!). Pours a cloudy red-brown color with thin off-white head. Aroma is funky with some basement and hints of some fruit. The aroma is definitely more like a Belgian sour rather than an American one. Taste is tart, but it has some vinegar, again more like a Belgian. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Dry finish. This is an awesome beer that seems to be a perfect hybrid of the vinegary, funky belgians and the fuller-bodied American versions. Really nice job!"
"Overall: I like it. I am very glad I got a bunch of these at the release. Certainly worth the drive and money."
"O- finally get to put this in. I've had it a few times and have been looking forward to really getting in to one. I'm all about this style and this is a cool twist on it. The captain does it right."
"o: tasting really good right off the bat. i am really psyched to see how this batch ages."
"O: Perfect level of sourness, not too heavy, a fleeting hint of alcohol, but the grapes added to this beer help it finish perfectly, leaving a great aftertaste."
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, dry and tingly across the tongue. Drinks really nice, excellent flavor, good level of sourness without overpowering the profile. I would drink this regularly if it was available."
"D - Very nice stuff. I would say batch one was the clear winner. The batch two seemed to be still developing a bit but I am not sure if it will ever get to batch ones level. Thanks again Dan for the chance to try these side by side."
"D: My first sour from CL and I'm impressed. Good combination of beer and wine. One of the highlights of the tasting"
"So Rosso is a solid, complex sour -- not the greatest I've ever tasted, but definitely worth waiting in line for once a year. But I can't for the life of me decide what a craft beer novice would make of it. There are other sours, particularly Oud Bruins, that rookies tend to like when I make them try one. But Rosso is odd. It's almost as if it's a different, sweeter style that somebody has painted over with a very sour brush. I guess I mean it's not as well-defined as some other sours, if that makes sense. Don't get me wrong, though -- it's a mighty fine brew."
"Thanks to Alex for cracking this one open. After trying Cuvee de Castleton, I've wanted to try more of Captain Lawrence's sours. Nose has red wine barrels, sweet malts and tart cherries. Big notes of vinegar kind of get in the way here. Same with the taste. Good beer, but too much vinegar and acidity. Clean crisp body has a dry finish. Not bad, but too much vinegar."
"Well I waited, patiently, it was a hard week and I diserve this. A brown color that tends toward garnett red when held to the light, initial pour appears with a half finger of white head that vanishes after minutes in the glass. Grapes, red wine, barrel, fresh cut wood, and just a hint of vinegar and acid hit the olfactory. Sour is on my tongue before this beer hits my lips. Grapey sweetness bounces to tartness and transforms to woody basement oak and a kick of brett funk, followed by more sour tart cherry and sour candy. The palate is left with scrubing bubbles of sour cleanliness. Feels like waves of mouth wash in a good way, puckering! I am so happy and sad. Happy I am having this great beer, sad it is leaving my cellar."
"Poured darkish mahogany/raisin color with a light tan head. Slight sediment. Wonderful aroma! Sour cherry, probably of the Ranier variety is most prominent. Touch of wood and earth, but balanced with much sweetness of lighter fruits. Maybe even some wine character in here. Wonderfully tart, but not overly so. There's that distinctive Brettanomyces coming out now that it has warmed a little bit to challenge the tartness. Hint of leather too. Bubbly carbonation makes for a nice, fresh feel. I would drink this all day."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the higher side. Drinkability is decent, I liked the grape sourness to it. It had some nice complexity to it with a lot of flavors going on. It was a nice beer to sip on during and after dinner this evening."
"This is the best sour I've had from Captain Lawrence so far and one of the better American Wild Ales I've had in a while."
"Overall this beer is good but there are some off flavors. Not sure I would go out of my way to seek it again, but I do enjoy it."
"Pours a deep hazy reddish brown with a nice head and some lace. The aroma is tart pie cherries with some booze and some farmyard cow dung on haystack with a sort of subdued horse blanket note. The flavor is intensely sour with lots of cherry and lemon rind with a nice bitterness for balance along with the earthy and oaky notes. This is pretty gosh darned sour and fantastic."
"D: I remember having a bottle of the first batch and thinking it was pretty good. However, this one didn't quite live up to that experience."
"D: It's decent, but I'm not that impressed. Batch 1 was showing signs of bad oxidation (cardboard), though I still enjoyed it. Batch 2 has some off flavors. I am not impressed enough to seek it out again."
"Rosso E Marrone is a rough US sour, not one of the greats, but worth a try if you can get it. Captain Lawrence is hit or miss on their sours for me, but for people who like theirs acidic and bold, this is recommended."
"This is my new favorite beer. Except for the appearance, there's so little wrong with this beer. Set a new standard for oud bruin for me, and beer in general. Damn."
"Notes: All the flavors are spot on and all the pieces are right, but they don't quite fit together properly. I think it's too dry for it to work. I had this one at one of the BA beerfests a few years ago and remember it being better. Was probably Batch 1. Soccerman7 told me that this batch was bottled with Champagne yeast which would explain the dryness and the crackly carbonation."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/3.5"
"The beer pours an amber-red color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get some licorice and tart dark fruit. The flavor is sour cherries, licorice, sour grapes, oak and some brown sugar that adds just a little bit of sweetness to the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made sour beer."
"M/D - very tannic and dry when it was straight from the fridge. Body really develops once it's warmed, carbonation is barely noticeable."
"Bottle: Poured a murky brown/red color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of weird funk is quite powerful with some sour and oak notes also noticeable. Taste is also overpowered by the weird funk notes which didn't agree with me (I usually did the barnyard notes but those were too much) and a sour lightly acidic finish. Body was quite full with medium carbonation. I had a hard time getting into this one - probably one of the worst from a usually excellent brewer."
"An above average oud bruin, very drinkable, nice wine flavors, nice wine flavors, light tartness, more could show."
"M: Medium mouthfeel for a Flanders oud bruin. Good carbonation and this one has not suffered from vinegar flavors that I dislike in some oud bruins."
"Overall, this beer was not rated #1 by Wine Enthusiast in 2009 for no reason."
"I just love this and will spend quite a bit of time with this bottle. Excellent beer."
"D- If it were possible, I would drink this on a pretty regular basis. I enjoyed it. Definitely not in the top group of sours that were opened though."
"Cheers!"
"D - Other than the rarity, pretty damn drinkable."
"Pours amber brown/red with fine carbonation creating a thin, rapidly fading head. Smell is so great. Tart cherries and funky brett goodness. Taste is complex mix of oak tannins, cherry and berry, sour grape punch and just enough tart zing. Somewhat dry, vinous, and cat-like finish. Mouthfeel is bright, clean and prickly tart. Overall, really enjoyable and would certainly seek out again. Glad to try this."
"Mouthfeel is light with good steady carbonation. Not overly sour but puckering enough to be a sipper overall. Pretty complex overall and very glad to have had the opportunity to sample this one!"
"Batch 1: Pours hazy muted brown with very little tan head. Aroma was very well blended with mild grape, a little apple and raisin. Flavor was incredibly complex and melded together. Great grape and vanilla flavor with great tartness. Medium body, and light carbonation and increidbly smooth finish. This blew batch 2 out of the water. 4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"D- Nice beer, I enjoy Flanders but I think that this beer just doesn't deliver in the appearance department, maybe with time. Nice might seek out more to age."
"Overall, very pleased with this one. Good overall."
"D: Great beer, not sure what the hype is about. Very complex with a pleasantly enticing sweet nose. However, the look of this brew is terrible and that lowers my expectations of it from the start. Mouthfeel is lively as it should be and really serves to separate the different flavors. Seek it out if you can but don't go overboard. Its not worth it."
"Ever since I tried CdC and SFTO Rum, I've been a big Captain Lawrence fan. This is the second time I've had Rosso. I thought I just got a poorly sealed bottle the first time, but no. All the things I didn't like about Nor'easter and SFTO Wine (infected?) were summed up in this beer. It lacks whatever it is that makes Oud Bruins one of my favorite styles."
"Was possibly expecting a little more from this beer, maybe it is my fault for pre-hyping a beer but this one let me down a bit...would like to try a batch2 and see if the carb level is better and perhaps the beer doesn't look like gutter water..."
"Overall, a very nice American example of the style. Like I said before, this reminds me of Saint Lamvinus, though for me not quite equal despite being a very good beer. Would gladly have more of this though and you should give it a try if you're into the style and haven't had it before."
"Overall, this beer soured a ton, especially when compared to the second batch. The complexity and fruit flavors that lacked here, were much more pronounced in the second batch as well. Guess what I'm saying is don't age this one. The fresher the better."
"Batch 2 served at 48 degrees in my Allagash chalice. Poured a semi-translucent mahogany with a loose, half inch head that quickly dissipated into a consistent soapy cap. Copious tiny bubbles adhered to the bowl of the glass after the initial pour, but quickly dispersed - only a few strands of lacing present during the tasting. Exceptional nose with great complexity - vinous and vinegary (red wine) with a hint of cork and wood. Taste consistent with nose; however, wood expresses itself as a buttery presence. Tannins and some citric acid also revealed; tart, but not overly sour. Perhaps a hint of cherries in the mix as well, but very much subdued. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a refreshing carbonation level and a slight acidity that stimulates the palate and salivary glands, culminating in a residual warmth in the mouth. Simply delicious. I've been waiting for the right mood to strike to crack this one and I am extremely happy with this beer. Truly top notch."
"A lot of the differences between the two batches are likely the product of aging. Nothing seems to be a recipe or barrel difference. Holding onto the rest of my batch 2 bottles for a while. If they age anything like batch 1, they will be superb."
"D-This is a good beer with a nice level of complexity. Tart and sweet with a touch of funk and a terrific feel."
"D- This is a high quality sour brown that CL has put together. Its soft and very complex. Wonderful example of the style. Glad to have been able to try this gem!"
"Really enjoyable beer - or beer/wine hybrid - overall."
"D - Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this beer, as sours tend to be hit or miss with me. Rosso E Marrone is sour to the core, but not ridiculously funky or farm-like, which enhances its drinkability."
"Overall, this is by far the best Flanders Oud Bruin I have had and an excellent example of the style. Big, bold, flavor that is nicely complex. The subtleties in this beer will have your tongue and your mind entertained for as long as you have some left in your glass. Truly a pleasure to drink. Great work Captain Lawrence."
"J"
"Even a sour hater like myself can appreciate this fine beer. Very, very impressive!"
"D - Another excellent offering from Captain Lawrence. Sad that this is only a 375ml bottle...could really go for a little bit more of this one. Really good flavors and quite complex. Definitely would like to sample again."
"d- best sour i think i have ever had, very original with straight up tastes of everything advertised on the bottle. no strange tastes or anything to detract from this beer. if you have a chance to try this, dont miss out."
"D: Enough complexity to keep me finding new things, but nothing really tying everything together. A very good beer that I'm glad I got, but not the best that I've had."
"The slight carbonation and medium body lend this beer to easy drinking. I could easily enjoy one of these on my own. The pleasant balanced sourness sits nicely on the palate and brings enjoyment with each sip."
"The smell is so floral, with some beautiful tart cherry flavors, and a really interesting slight bitter chocolate. Slight funkiness, unripened green grapes. Quite honestly one of the most complex wilds that I've ever had the pleasure of sniffin'. In the taste, the chocolate shines through sweetly. The sourness is more in the form of a mouthpuckering balasmic vinegar, not quite acidic. The vanilla and wine flavors are coming out great. Right now, this beer is a little bit too spritzy, and a little bit too overcarbonated. I'm hoping that this will curb with age. All in all, this has the potential to age into one of my favorite sours OF ALL TIME. Only time will tell."
"Batch 2. Again. As I craft my description of this beer, I'm astounded by how much it matches what I have above. Lemony, balsamic vinegar, musty grapes plenty of tannins and leather. Moderate sourness. Leather. Yum."
"Overall, an amazing sour that really captures every element of the style."
"Pours a reddish amber color with a small beige head that fizzles out quickly. Aroma is lactic and lemony with wine grapes and vinegar, berries. Nice subdued vinous flavor, very tart, acetic and lactic qualities, grapes and cherries, wood, acetone. Very nice and complex. Can definitely get lost in this one. Low on astringency, which is a big plus for a winey oaky beer. The body has some heft to it which is cut through nicely by the acidity. Very good sour."
"D: Wow i really wish i had more of this one. Seriously this may be the best sour beer i have ever had. It is very easy to sip on and at no point felt overwhelming. I was blown away by the rich flavors and and the dryness and wine like qualities. Well done"
"A waxed 375ml bottle - Batch 1. Uncapped and poured into my snifter glass. Rosso appears a somewhat murky crimson brown color with barely a finger of off white head. Nose and flavors consist of pears, grapes, oak, mild funk, cherries, currants, red wine, light sourness and vinegar, sweet dark sugar. Decent carbonation levels with very little alcohol; heat and at the very least, a medium body. Pretty well rounded after a year in the bottle. When I first sampled this last year, I thought to myself that 3 people could easily split a bottle. Now, I'd have no problems enjoying it solo."
"Drinkability: Going down easy for me."
"Overall, a pretty good sour, but nothing too special. I was a little bit let down by this one, but it was fairly drinkable."
"This is very drinkable but I'm happy doing it as sort of a tasting, which is where I am drinking it. Tasty treat."
"D - I actually think I prefer Red Poppy to this Flanders. I did enjoy this one, and wouldn't mind trying it again in the future. I think this has several more years of aging left."
"This is a very good beer and an excellent example of the style. It goes down very easily and I think the funk will develop even more over time. Nice."
"Wowza, great beer. Since this one has dropped bright in the bottle it's really come into it's own."
"It's a pungent, strong tasting brew but drinkable for all that."
"A nice take on the Flanders Oud Bruin style by Captain Lawrence Brewing. I would have liked a little more maltiness to add to the complexity, as I feel that was the Rosso's one real weak point. I hope CL makes another batch next year, as I'd like to see if they make any tweaks."
"D: The Captain does it again! I went into this expecting nothing short of greatness and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Many thanks go out to Javier for agreeing to this trade. I've been trying to put my hands on a bottle of this ever since it was released. I had one bottle break en-route to me (F.U.U.P.S.!) and a couple trades fall through/go nowhere. I'm really loving everything the Captain lays his hot little hands on!"
"D: If you haven't been able to tell yet I'm in love with this beer. Definitely one of the best sours I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"D- I took down my 12oz or so with no problem and loved every bit of it. This is a top notch version of this style. While being a wild ale the wildness is a bit tamed while the taste is wonderful. I think I just found my favorite Captain Lawrence beer to date, this was special. This has good legs for some aging, alot going on here."
"I think this one is highly under-rated and some of the low reviews did not rate to style. Personally I think this is the best beer for this style. Much better than red poppy."
"D: Very solid brew and definitely my favorite Oud Bruin by far. Easily drinkable and refreshing, hard to sip and savor. I do think a touch more funk with a drier feel and finish would benefit this brew."
"Overall a very well done example of the style here. Different, a little sweeter then I would normally expect, but amazingly complex. Very happy to get to try this one."
"D - I keep reaching for my glass - there's no reason why I couldn't kill a 375ml bottle of this on my own. The aftertaste is strong but not overwhelming and the carbonation and ABV are both pretty low. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle of this one - maybe batch #2."
"D: I'm not a big fan of the Flanders Oud Bruin style, but this is probably one of the more enjoyable ones I've had."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sour and tannic, a bit like grapeskin. Metallic mid-palate with some odd earthy funk. Heavyish body with low carbonation. The finish is somewhat mineral and oxidized, not entirely pleasant. Had this one side-by-side with Cuvee de Castleton, and thought that beer was far superior."
"Really tasty beer, glad I was able to try it."
"This is a very nice beer; the grapes add a nice complexity that is boosted by the oak character and the ample, but not quite overwhelming, sourness. This is a nicely balanced beer, though the aroma really needs to warm up quite a bit before it becomes nicely complex from the underlying Brettanomyces influence."
"D: Off the charts. This is right up there with the Cuvee for me. I don't think this beer is getting the hype that is deserves. This is a world class American sour."
"D: It's glandy. Almost 90% of where I want it to be."
"Pours a muddy brown with no head what-so-ever. With no head, you get no lacing...sad looking brew to be honest. Smell is pretty tart; ripe grapes, funky brett, and oak. Some malts and earth in the nose as well with a touch of vinegar. Taste begins with a puckering vinegar punch, fresh rhubarb, and sour apples as well. Midway the smooth malt and leather emerge with a light bretty tingle. The wine flavors really come forward in the aftertaste, and I like it a lot. A light to medium body with an almost lifeless feel in the mouth, although it seems to fit pretty well. I'm not a huge sour freak (yet), but this is just too easy to drink. Another good one from the Captain. Thanks again Todd!"
"Thanks again, Alan, for the chance to try this nectar of the gods!"
"Very nice beer, and certainly deserving of all the praise heaped on it. Top notch."
"Drinkability- This is definitely the most interesting beer I've had in quite awhile. The oak is fairly strong in the taste but mixed with those grapes it turns into an amazingly dry brew. This beer is very vinous and 350mL isn't nearly enough and that's my only complaint. Thanks much for the opportunity Mike!"
"This is very drinkable but I can't help but think it would age beautifully. A great sour but maybe the more generic wild ale category would fit this more than a Flanders."
"Waxed cap bottle, batch #1. Pours murky, cloudy medium brown, dark plum. Head is around for just a brief moment, then its gone, leaving behind just very few tiny bubbles and no lace. On the low carbonation side. Fruity (sour plums), sour, Brett infused nose. Initially fruit on the tongue, then quickly the sour comes in to play. Funk, grapes, wood, horsey, grapefruit juice, sharply sour, intensely complex. World class sour. Wish I had a few bottles to age for a few years. Yet another home run for the good captain. Well worth seeking out via trade, if you can find any...looks like I will have to wait for the next batch.."
"375 ml bottle thanks to Mike once again, thank you for sending me the second sour from Captain Lawrence, consumed on 2/22/09, reviewed from notes, poured into my Chimay goblet, color is medium brown with tons of red in it, 3/4 inch white bubbly head, goes down rather fast, some minor lacing, aroma is of cherries, grapes, red wine, brettanomyces, tart, other wild yeast, and mild vinegar, great smell, flavor has so much wood in it that the dryness almost takes over while served chilled, lots of red grapes in the middle, mild malt that is a little sugary and malty at the same time, finish is dry with even more oak, sourness from the brett, love how the tart settles as it warms, sour, fruity, and mildly sweet mouthfeel, medium body, crisp and strong carbonation, could drink multiple bottles of this stuff but its dryness can really affect the drinkability after some time, goes down easily mostly though, can even be refreshing, this was by far the oakiest beer I ever had, this baby spent a long time in the barrel, great brew that I wish was more accesible for us here in California, will be drinking more in the future, highly recommended"
"Medium bodied with a low level of carbonation and a vinous profile. A unique and thoroughly enjoyable beer from Captain Lawrence. Highly recommended."
"4 D - Great tasting now, I think it will only improve with age. 1 bottle at a time is enough, but it is definitely worth seeking out and experiencing"
"8/4/9/4/17 (4.2/5)"
"I could drink quite a few of these, although i think with some more time to develop, this is going to be known as a top quality sour."
"D - an awesome brew that I feel could compete with Russian River, though needs some time in the bottle to smooth out. Will try another in 6 months or so."
