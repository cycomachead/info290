"Complex and interesting. Only mildly funky."

"O- A very original take on a Flanders Oud Bruin.  Has a tannic red wine characteristic to it that you don't find as often in the style.  Surprisingly smooth for how strong and complex it is."
"Nice, but not as dry and refreshing as other dark sours."

"A nice sour that is light and maintains a little bit of fullness and sweetness."
