The sour, vinegar character is nicely balanced by sweetness and fruity notes. The glaring flaw is the lack of carbonation, which detracts from the mouthfeel but also affects the flavour. I'm sure that the experience on the palate would be different with greater CO2 presence. Nonetheless, this is an impressive effort from de Struise and one that I'm happy to have tried.

Nose has some black cherry, balsamic vinegar, currant, light vinous notes and a sense of sourness. There is a substantial sweet component to this as well. Taste has dark cherries and berries, light acetic tartness produced by similar balsamic notes and a gentle earthy maltiness. Light pucker in the finish, but again the sweet and sticky components of this beer make themselves well known. No alcohol on the palate and low carbonation, somewhere between still and gentle 'prickliness.' A nice semi-tart yet sweet Flemish Red, glad to have seen and had this.","liamt07","Jan 20, 2012"

4.09,4.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"11.2oz. bottle procured from the Struise webshop. Vintage 2008 (EM No. 7) served at 52 degrees in a tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a bubbly, loose, tan-colored froth around the shoulders which continues to dissipate into an oily skim and a thin, tight bubbly band. I love the nose on this beer - vinous, oaky, vanilla notes, dark fruits (plum, figs, prunes) and a suggestion of grape bubblegum. Taste is a bit more muddled. Vinous quality still presents itself, as well as some citric acid; however, there's also a bit of chocolate as well as more grape notes, a slight earthiness and prunes. Tannins are present, but the acidity pretty much buries the vanilla and oak expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a mild carbonation which is almost still. Acidity lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and lingers along the glands at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall - I really enjoyed this complexity of this beer and plan on cellaring a couple bottles to see how it changes over time. A slightly tart and vinegary FOB without being overly sour. I wish there were more efforts at this style readily available.","Jwale73","Oct 22, 2011"

4.01,2,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one during one of our weekly tastings! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a reddish brown with a very minimal light tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pure acetic acid, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, balsamic vinegar, fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. For some odd reason, I know I shouldn't, but I really liked this one. I'm a chemist for a living and work with pure acetic acid sometimes and I just LOVE the smell of it. This brew reminds me of said smell. During the tasting I even joked about pouring this over a salad to make the best salad ever... But anyways, if you do not like vinegar flavors in your brew, avoid this one AT ALL COSTS! If you do, get this on your palate ASAP!

3.82,-2.8,1.5,4.5,4,2.5,4,"The nose is utterly complex with interplay of sour, sweet, fruity and sherry aromas. The sourness takes after balsamic vinegar which is quite intense denoting an aged example, as do the obvious sherry-notes. The malt is quite rich with caramel and slight chocolaty character while fruity esters are reminiscent of raisins, plum and black cherries. Some brown sugar is noticeable as is the mild alcohol in the background. The malts, balsamic vinegar and black cherry produce rich tart-sweet flavor with intensity of a soy sauce. A very faint mushroom-like bitterness indicates that Brettanomyces has been used to add sourness to this one. The beer is said to be oak-aged and that's welcomed as it gives balsamic character to the vinegar, but unexpected because maturation on oak is typical to Flanders Red, not Bruin. Body is medium-full and smooth due to nearly absent carbonation and besides the poor appearance flat mouthfeel is the major flaw of otherwise excellent beer.","crnipeter","Jun 01, 2011"

It is balanced very well with a mix of flavors that seemingly evolve into something different with every sip. The biggest disappointment here is the complete lack of carbonation that would really drive this one home as a standout winning brew. While this isn't the best offering I have had from Struise, it most certainly is among the most complex and interesting.

Some mineral type earth notes in the taste as well. Some acetone present as is some sour/tart cherries. Not as fruitful or sweet as other sours/wilds that I have had.

The taste is a very nice balance between the sweet and tart flavors. There is a very subtle manure presence. Clean, crisp body suits the style well. Dry, acidic finish.

It's sweet, with lots of plum and dark berry, maybe a little cherry. Alcohol is only barely prevalent, but still more than I'd have expected. The more I drink it the more I taste plum, maybe even plum wine. I can't pinpoint what, but this beer really does make me love it with every sip.","tprokop7","Oct 18, 2008"

3.92,-0.3,4,4.5,4,4,3,"I had a bottle of this at the Kulminator in Antwerp, served in a de Struise goblet. The beer was murky brown-red color with a thin wet head. The smell was very good for a Flanders wild ale, lots of vinegary sourness but complemented by sweet cherry and wood. The taste was sour to the point of lip pucker, but you could imagine quite a bit of fruit flavors, maybe apple cider as well. I liked this a lot, but the drinkability score has to be average at best as the acidity keeps you from drinking too fast. Very recommended.","TurdFurgison","0"

Nose had some definite sour cherry notes and a tart character. Taste was wonderful. Cherry taste was fresh but yet there was a wood character from the aging. Nice sour tone all through the beer made this one hard to put down.","ggaughan","Sep 17, 2008"

The taste is surprisingly sour and yet creamy. The sourness isn't over powering at all. I've certainly had more tart/sour beers than what this offers. I also get hints of citrus, grapefruit taste in there. It's really crisp and doesn't much of an after taste. In terms of a Flemish sour beer this is definitely a drinkable beer.","edmedina","Jul 21, 2008"
4.54,15.5,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Pours a cloudy brown with dark ruby highlights when held close to the light. No head whatsoever even when coaxed while pouring. Smells of sour cherries, prunes, slight fusel alcohol in the background and maybe some phenolic in there as well. Tastes incredible! Lots of sour cherries, but not over the top lactic like some others. A bit of caramel malt midway through, some more sour then a bit of alcohol then some more sour leaving a slight puckering in the finish. Vinous flavors throughout. Medium in body with a sticky mouth. Carbonation is just about non existent, still almost. This might need some age to develop some carbonation. I do have time as the bottle says it is best before 7/2011. Great brew, I wish it was more readily available.","johnnnniee","Jul 17, 2008"
4.47,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle courtesy of Fonefan: Poured a deep cloudy red color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of oak with some sour cherries and some cloves and some very subtle light black chocolate notes. Taste is also a mix between some black chocolate covered black cherry with some clearly identifiable oak with a sour finish. A lot more complex then most traditional Flemish sours out there. This is definitely a beer I would like to try more often in order to try and decipher all of the characteristics.","Phyl21ca","Jun 15, 2008"

It was served in a wine glass, and had a hazy red/brown color. The thin head was a light brown. Incredible aroma. An extremely earthy, barnyard aroma, intense but pleasant. Somewhat vinous nose also. It had a sour, dark fruit taste. The earthiness translated into a yeast taste. The flavors intensified as the beer warmed. This was a deep, richly rewarding beer.","lordofthewiens","Apr 07, 2008"
4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Bottle, Stockholm, Sweden. Very dark, almost appears black in the glass, but pours a rustic brown. Full, very light brown head. Vinous nose with a variety of dark sour fruits. Flavor is very sour and acidic, with hints of wild red grapes, blackberry and hints of dried chocolate on the finish. A rich, flavorful beer, with an authentic character, a clean sourness and nice balance. Clearly immensely high in quality.","Crosling","Mar 24, 2008"

Hopefully I can get a hold of a carbonated sample of this brew as I have a feeling the carbonation would make this beer quite stellar. I certainly got hung up on the lack of carbonation at first, but the more I taste this beer the more impressed I am by its complexity and balance; I still think some noticeable if not effervescent carbonation would put this over the top though. I actually was a bit disappointed in this beer at first, but it has really grown on me, and in fact really needs to breath a bit before it comes into its own.","Gueuzedude","Jul 27, 2007"
5,27.2,5,5,5,5,5," 	The first thought that popped into my head when I tasted it was how rich it was. It started with a toffee like malt flavor. Not overly sweet or cloying but just enough young beer in the blend to balance the sourness or acetic character of the older portion. The fruit profile also changed from that of the aroma. It had more of a spiced citrus and raisins flavor. The finish seemed to last forever. It consisted of vanilla, woodsy phenols, wild bliss and a sweet and sour tug of war that made me want more and more.","granite","Jul 21, 2007"

Pours in drawn earth brown. Flavor incredible. Blows me away with sweet and sour cherry vinous complexity. A world of different and indecent cherry characters explode in a room filled with cork, toasted sesame and a lot of blistering sour orange peel and popping coriander seeds. Acidity is sharp, highlighting the drumming complexity of the fruit, earth and spice that dance forth from the glass. More strong cherries before settling to sleep in the grass with kaffir and coconut. Aged balsamic drizzle over a grilled piece of pineapple, cresting the oaken delivery on the smack. Astonishing unique complexity and character. Too be savored for sure.","CharlesDarwin","Beers"
