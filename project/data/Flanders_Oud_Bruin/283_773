4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for and I didn't think there was anything that was off or out of place about this beer, it was just a tasty example of the style.  This beer has nice drinkability, it's smooth, slightly refreshing, a little crisp, not acidic at all, not filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think one glass is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer was that it was really true to style.  What I liked the least about it was nothing, there wasn't anything I disliked or would change.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like the style.  I would buy it again, but I don;t think I would cellar it.  All in all I enjoyed this beer and it just about everything that I want in the style, but I thought it was still just a notch below Rodenbach.  It's not a favorite from this brewery or a favorite for the style.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Mar 16, 2015"

Smell: background green melon, caramel, bready note. In front is musty grain, cherry, green apple note. Taste: cola and soft melon notes, snappy grain, cherry juice, herbal and oaky, raspberry note, grape skin. Medium bodied, creamy delicate carbonation, drying mildly tart finish. Very tasty and well made. No date on the oddly stubby cork, cage lists 10/2023 as the best by date.","babaracas","Dec 10, 2014"

This is different than those English and American brown ale. After checking out the beer description on BA of the style fermentation actually produces a bi product called diacetyl which produces a sour flavor definitely a characteristic of the beer. Also gives the beer some buttery notes which reading up on diacetyl is used to artificially flavor buttered popcorn. Poured into a glass from a cage and cork with almost a mathematical precision of carbonation to body. Smell is overpowering sweet fruity esters. Cherry and oak flavors, very carbonated, sour, dark fruits coming through such as fig and grape. My first of this varietal but excellent nonetheless.","Ryanm1","Dec 25, 2013"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, raspberry, fruit, cherry, sugar, tart, earth, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, sour, tart, earth, raspberry, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. There was a nice sweetness going on in this one for the style that really helped to balance out some of the earthiness that one usually expects with the style. There wasn’t a big vinegar aspect that really made it easy to drink and quite enjoyable. The raspberry really made this one stand out and really refreshing.

I pick up some fresh figs on the taste, as well as dried oranges and golden raisins, it is a complex malt base here. the top notes are acidic and alcoholic, with the fruity bits taking a back seat to yeasty funk and tannic dryness. all of it getting more intense as it warms up. big body is made lighter by the acid, and by lively carbonation. I could se myself drinking this regularly if it were available. its a classy beer, a glistening example of the oud bruit style, and a beer I really recommend, especially at the 9 bucks a bottle steal we copped this for. it must be done.","StonedTrippin","Jul 15, 2013"

An aged Belgian Brown Ale, it is brewery-cellered for many months until it matures. Only then is it blended and bottled. Historically known as ""Provision Beer", Goudenband is superb for further home cellaring, allowing taste, aroma and body of the beer to continue to evolve. A delectable treat for the beer connoisseur.""","rickyleepotts","Jun 19, 2013"

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a light brown body with good head/carbonation that dies slow and leaves some lace on top of a mostly sweet aroma. The smells I am picking up seem to be light chocolate, toffee, touches of fruit ranging from cherry to grape and a good chunk of woodiness and hops as well, although not as noticeable as the malts. Light tartness is my first reaction, and my second is that this is a light-to-medium bodied beer that has great balance to it as the tart cherryesque flavors give way to sweetness from chocolate to toffee and then this balanced beer finishes crisp with a slight dry edge. Very pleasant sipper that ranges from both the sour and sweet spectrums and should be had by anyone who likes Belgian ales.","clayrock81","Apr 22, 2013"

BUT, this was before I knew anything about beer, or had any appreciation for the subtlety of flavor. I am sure glad I tried it again. First, this pour much, much darker than any other sour I've had. Brown and ruby with white, light head. Smell is fantastic, sour and fresh. Lime, some slight brown sugar sweetness, and cherries. The taste follows suit with the perfect amount of sour and bitter. The flavor is light and refreshing and absolutely none of the 8% ABV comes through. This beer has a lot of subtlety and picking out the many, many flavors is a pleasure (cherries, plums, oak, spice, lime, orange and many more). Great carbonation brings the flavors to life on your palate. Zesty, refreshing, and overall great. I am very glad I got a chance to revisit this beer, and it holds a place as one of my new favorite beers.","Samuel906","Mar 04, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, though the tartness is heavily exchanged in favor of sweetness, some mild red wine grapes are tossed in for good measure, and a general sense of caramel apple pervades at times, particularly near the finish. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish.

Dry with more grape juice and a smattering of wafer-like breadiness amongst some taffy and a limited ginger spiciness. There's a faint medicinal characteristic toward the end. Medium bodied with a slight alcohol heat. Puckering, but will not foment a grimace. The aftertaste lingers, and gets to me.

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 8/2010. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, prune, apple, red wine, grass, hay, light vinegar, earth, and funk. Very nice aromas with nice complexity and balance. Taste of tart cherry, apple, raisin, hay, grass, red wine, oak, herbal, earth, vinegar, and light yeast spices. Slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, light fruits, hay, grass, herbal, vinegar, and earth on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying at all on the finish. Not as tart as I wanted it to be though, but there is a fair amount of acidity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders brown ale. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth to sip on with a fair amount of crisp acidity. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Sep 25, 2012"

The appearance being a dark rusty brown color might not be the greatest thing you have ever seen but what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste. The smell is quite varied, you get oak, some acidity, and sour dark fruit. The taste seems to change and develop with both consumption and temperature, at first I get the oak presence, the dark fruits, vinegar acidity and then finally the much anticipated tartness. This beer is not too sour but has just enough lactobacillus to make me happy. It is priced reasonably and gives you the sour many of us crave until you can get your hands on 3F or Cantillon which seems to be more and more rare in my neck of the woods","Mitchill","Jun 29, 2012"

Pours a dull, plum-colored hue with a dense, one inch, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th inch consistent skim. Spots and slashes of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses tart vinous notes as well as a suggestion of vanilla and vinegar. I also get a general Welch's grape juice vibe. Taste follows nose; however, all aspects of the flavor profile are a bit more subdued than suggested by the nose. I also get a bit of lactic acid in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medum in body with a lively carbonation level. There's also a slight tartness that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Finish is somewhat dry. Overall, I enjoyed this beer; however, there's was just a little too much carbonation. I'd really like to try a vintage with about five years on it to see how it develops.","Jwale73","Feb 14, 2012"

This is one of those beers that the first taste of it I say, ""Whoa!"". Absolutely fantastic. All the flavors are mixed perfectly, and it's a fairly similar profile to the nose. I can't believe how well put together this beer is. I'm tempted to bump it up to a 5, but will refrain for now. The feel is magical. Tart, some sweetness, smoothness, medium body.

Lots of the same on the palate with a nicely integrated oak flavor and a tartness that is not overly sour. It is also a bit less sweet than I was anticipating.

The aroma was quite complex with a nutty dark grain malt, an herbal hop and a sweet earthy yeast with notes of cherries, apple, sweet dried fruit and a mild alcohol wine scent. It tasted sweet, malty and fruity with hints of cherries and dried dark fruit in the beginning then became very tart with a nice apple vinegar flavor at the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhere between light and medium in body with the texture being watery at first and finishing quite dry. The carbonation was lively and a little bubbly.

It isn't too sweet, isn't too sour yet appeals to both. Oh wow. Again it is a perfect compromise between the sweet and the sour.

In the taste, light sour, dusty drying malt/yeast interaction. Touch of iron adding to the acidity. Almost tart, a bit sour. The 8% abv is not noticeable at all. It is an appetizing brew and could stand up to fine cheese and desserts. Ever so slightly salty from the sodium bicarbonate water treatment. Multiple strain yeast adds a good deal of complexity.

I think that it is a bit over-carbonated, however, which washes away the flavor too quickly. It's good while it's there, but the staying power isn't so hot.

Surprisingly there's a decent amount of lacing. There's also visible sediment ""floaties"" in the glass. The aroma is sour, it smells like apple cider, vinegar, brown sugar and tart cherries. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also raisins, figs, and a bit of wood that I can taste. Great mix between tart/sour and sweet flavors. It's definitely sweeter than I expected it to be. Mouthfeel is medium, it's creamy and a bit syrupy with average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very easy and enjoyable to drink. Alcohol is well hidden.

Aroma of maple syrup and brown sugar with a hint of Tootsie Roll on top of a tart cherry sourness. The very definition of sweet and sour. Taste is very sweet, hints of cherries and apples, again with the brown sugar, a bit of molasses, and not quite as sour nor tart as I was expecting, but tart nonetheless. Very complex. The sweetness mixes nicely with the tart fruit flavors and is extremely well balanced. Very light carbonation tingle on the tongue, medium to full-bodied. The sweetness is somewhat cloying and the ABV is pretty high, keeping the drinkability low. This brew would be an excellent candidate for careful cellaring. I've read that Liefman's is or has gone bankrupt, so I'm very much considering buying a few more bottles of this before it's too late. My first Oud Bruin, and it did not let me down.

Nice, dark brown color with aromas of alcohol and big malts. A little bit of dark funk going on in the smell as well as vinegar. The aroma really improves as the beer warms to room temp (as most do). Whoa, the taste is funky, sour, strong, cereal, heavy cereal maltiness, vinegar again and glue, sour apples, tart in the back. This is sour in a puckery way but much different than the La Roja I had just prior. This is quite potent and much more of a sipper.

It's smooth and supple on the palate, not too thick, not too thin; carbonation is low, but more would amp up the sourness too much.

The flavors are intense and much more focused then what one sees in a typical fruit lambic for instance. While not my favorite style, even a dedicated sour hater like myself can appreciate this beer. The beer has a very nice mouthfeel with a long, lingering finish. On the other hand, a little bit of this goes a long way. The beer is pretty warming from the 8% abv., and the sweet/sour combination wears me out after a while. Still, this is a very good beer that I was very pleased to see on tap at Max's.

Aromas are classic Flanders, plenty of acetic acid comes through, dark caramel malts, plums and raisins. The aroma doesn't lean as far in the sour direction as other lambics I've had and does have a noticeable sweet smell. It also has a slight medicinal, band-aid like note. An incredibly mouth filling beer, the rich dark malts blend well with the bacteria with an overall pretty sweet feel. An overall syrupy feel with the moderate carbonation compounding that. Flavors of light citrus fruits but leaning towards dark fruits with a small amount of chocolate, really quite diverse.

Incredibly unappealing look from the excessive yeast/protein particles hanging out like stationary gel capsules. Taste is smooth, overly sweet, a touch alcoholic, and some nice sourness. Honestly tastes like a mix of brown ale and a cheap reisling wine.

It was fruity (cherry mainly) with a musty undertone along with oak. Really loved the aroma on this one. The taste was awesome as well.

It does mellow quickly and lead to variety of flavors including sour cherries, over ripe mellon, oak, ashey malt and silky molases. Although sour mouthfeel is dominate, it is not overpowering.

Definately more sweet than sour, and a beer thats rumored to have gone through numerous changes the past decade. Maybe this was once a classic, but that was before my time.

Smells of dried, chewy fruit, pomegranate, toasty malts, lactic acid, grapes, cherries, and a subtle woodiness. Sourness comes out more in the flavor, as well as wood characteristics, and it's all for the better. There is also a malty sweetness that anchors the sourness down so as not to run wild. Darker malts come forth in the middle amidst cherry flavors and, towards the end, a roast quality comes forth. Finishes with a sharp dryness contrasting to the sweeter middle. Woody tannins round this out in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is moderate to full with jumpy carbonation. Fantastic beer and well worth the money.

I have no idea what that is I'm trying to describe but that's as close as I come. It finishes dry, though, which is a much-needed and delightful balance. Nice, nice, nice. The mouthfeel is syrupy almost too much so but again, the finish saves the day. Light carbonation provides balance and saves the beer from veering into cough syrup territory. It is lightly but nicely carbonated. The drinkability is good, with the balances making the experience. This is a very complex beer with many sides to its personality.

Dusky mahogany, with bronze-red highlights and a thin but fine and dense sand-colored head. A few floating yeast chunklets made their way into the glass despite my best efforts at making a ""careful pour."" Sharp cidery notes in the aroma, along with a tannic green grape skin zest and a hint of barnyard funk. I also pick up a slight presence of candy-sweet caramel in the back. Definitely caramelly in the taste, which couples with a tart apple puckeriness to instantly get me thinking about Halloween during my childhood. Some funky wild microbes are also present to lend a nearly lambic edge. A bit of montmorency or some other sort of sour cherry flavor emerges as the beer warms. Light-ish on the palate, but the complexity of the sour-sweet flavor profile lends a certain heft to the mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated with an off-dry finish. A masterful creation, no doubt. 8% alcohol by volume is largely imperceptible. If not for its strength, this would make an amazing session beer. Highly recommended.","orfeu","Apr 01, 2007"

Complex nose, with hints of oak (but not American oak -- just a more subdued woodiness), must, sour cherries and funk. Really interesting. On the palate, tingly acidity and smooth malts pop up first, with some funk from the wood aging easily distinguishable, especially at lower temperatures. For fruit there's cherries, the sweeter side holds chocolate creme, and there are some nice earthy herbal notes in there too. The finish is a tad sweet and certainly tangy. Mouthfeel is silky in the malt component, but there's an acidic edge that evens things out and adds complexity. This is a wonderful beer. Everything is perfectly balanced, the flavors are nuanced and enjoyable, each part on its own merits and as a whole.","geexploitation","Mar 02, 2007"

Very similar to the flanders reds I've been drinking recently, namely Rodenbach, but with a bigger, sweeter caramel bend.

The flavour is sweet, malty, fresh, fruity (cherries, rasberries, apples, pears, berries) and complex at first then acidic, sour, tart and irony in the finish. Alcohol is wonderfully hidden. Medium bodied, fizzy and moreish. Obviously similar to Liefmans Kriekbier but with a more dry sour finish as opposed to the sweet cherry flavour.

The head builds a darkish tan to about one finger, and dissipates fairly slowly, leaving lots of lacing. Smell is a little medicinal, with a bit of sweetness apparent and some nice spiciness showing beneath the obvious sour plums and cherries. Taste is tart fruitiness upfront, with cherry and woody tones showing up alongside the funky yeast and hint of Brettanomyces. Then the sweetness comes through, a momentary reprieve from the intensely sour opening before the finish comes through, dry and fruity. Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated and sticky at the same time, though maybe a little thin, and drinkability is quite good. Very nice, quintessential example of the style.","Mandrake","Dec 30, 2005"

Aromas of fermenting cherries, rotted grapes, sweet malts, and a tartness that reminded me of children's candies from years ago. Taste was Exceptional. Flavors of cherries, grapes, sugarcane, malts, spices and herbs blend in a world of perfection. Mouthfeel is heavenly. Smooth, medium bodied, yet reserving enough to fill the palate and keep the drinker begging for more. Execeptional drinkability, I would drink this everyday if it weren't so expensive. The only drawback is that when poured toward the end of the bottle, I got clumps, literally clumps of sediment. Not very appealing, but this beer is so good I totally overlook this fact.

Beer is russett in color with garnet highlights, although too murky to see any carbonation. Aroma begins pleasantly like dried black cherries, but eventually becomes a cherry antacid humdrum. The nosefeel is initally vinous and only somewhat tart, progressively developing an inorganic, near-metallic bitterness that fills the sinus. The tastes are slightly more engaging: black cherry sweetness and dried cranberry sourness play off of each other, like preserves spread over a soda-cracker/bicarbonate base. Fruit pits show up and pull the tastebuds toward oaky wood and a dull mineral finish. Mouthfeel seems washy and only slightly tart, and too neutral to really interest me. Easy drinkability with no alcohol noticeable. So what's with all these people talking about being blown away by sourness and oak and vinegar?

But the taste was sour and sweet. Your first thought is that the beer has gone bad and then the malts take over. After the first shock of the taste, your brain will settle down and let the sweet and sour mix with each additional sip. The carbonation and complexity of the taste gave this a medium mouthfeel, coating all oral surfaces. I could drink a few of these on their own.

Following a slight tartness hits with some dark fruits, maybe figs or grapes which add a nice flavor to the beer. This beer finishes tart and refreshing with a slight sourness also and a warm alcohol note. Overall this beer is medium bodied and the carbonation is quite refreshing to the beer.

Funny, though, that I opened this bottle specifically to rate it, and it is different than the 5 or 6 of these I've had before (including once on tap at Lucky Baldwin's). What I remember from the others is an amazing balance of fruit, slight sweetness oak aged feel like a complex wine, balanced by a marvelous tart/sourness. This bottle had all the things I describe in the aroma, but the flavor was dominated by tart/sour/bitter much more so than in previous bottles. I don't know if this is because its a different vintage/age, if it has turned a bit, or if it was my palate. But this one seems to have some variability. The beer is a beautiful brown that hides ruby, port, and golden-reds in its complexity, much like the slight sweet fruity aroma hides plums, sour grapes, apples, and who knows what else. There is no head on this beer. The flavor is sour like a geueze/lambic with lots of other things going on that I can't put my finger on. The alcohol is no where to be seen except as a warming sensation. I'm not sure if this particular bottle was off or not, my scores are based on several tries.

Very unappetizing. Other than that it looks good. Light brown in color with a beautiful head with good retention. Smells great - nice malt character that is hard to place, no hop aroma to mention, but an earthy kick that promises an intriguing flavor. First thing I notice when drinking it is the fabulous mouthfeel - so soft and creamy yet a rather thin body. Taste has that lightly roasted malt with the undercurrent of yeast. A wonderful balance of flavors - nothing sticks out. I expected, and would slightly prefer, a bit more tartness/sourness. But the subtlety of the beer is its beauty.

Quite astringent. After the initial tartness there's a myriad of flavors to this one. Roasted malts, sweet fruits, woody base to it, and even some caramel. The finish is super dry and yeasty with some breadiness mixed in as well. Improved as it warmed but the beer in the end was overly sweet and the tartness just didn't hold together.

At one point I thought about chewing leather when I was a kid, a kinda nostalgic thing. I'm rather lost for words, the wrapping paper on the botle had comments from Michael Jackson about it being the best brown ale in the world.

Oak, acidity, funky barnyard and apple are all present in the bouquet, along with a touch of caramel. Goudenband's flavor starts off with a mouthwatering tartness that lends itself to an onslaught of oak, vanilla, green apple and perpetual acidity that lasts long on the finish. The carbonation is just barely in place, creating a rather elegant mouthfeel. Turns a touch syrupy as it warms. Quite refreshing while hardly showing any of its 8% alcohol content.

What I found was an extremely complex ale without the usual heaviness and thick mouthfeel. Vinous and full of more fruits than I can elaborate on, this brown was a revelation. As others have noted the sourness is the initial impression, but this recedes as other flavors explode on the palate. A cherry wine always comes to mind as a drink Flemish Browns and this is no exception. The sourness accentuates the intense fruitiness without overwhelming. Finishes tart and quick. Too much to handle for more than a few goblets though.","QXSTER1","Aug 03, 2003"

A large head of exceptionally creamy off-white foam holds exceptionally well, maintaining itself throughout the glass and leaving some noteable lace. The nose is quite complex with a variety of aromas that include oakish, vanilla-laced wood; honeyish caramelized sugars; dark fruits (plum, red grape, cherry); a mild touch of Brettanomyces; and a subtle hint of sweat-sock/old cheese hops. The light body is gently crisp and smooth in the mouth; but almost takes a backseat its the puckering, tart acidity. It starts tart and then fruity, but softens to reveal some sherry-like, earthy, lightly toasted and woody malt before ending in a dry finish. Quite exceptional!

Taste is primarily a heavy rush of sourness from this flemish brown with a vinous wine like tone to it and somewhat dry finish, and I must say this one is a palate killer just not much you can follow with it. Mouthfeel is low in carbonation with a light bodied mouthfeel rather thin, much fuller on tap in my opinion. Drinkability is one at a time due to the fact that this sour Flemish brown is just so overbearingly sour much more balanced and smoother in the bottle.","WVbeergeek","Jun 17, 2003"

The sour and raspy vinegar mouthfeel is not at all pleasant. Maybe I got a bad bottle? And the fact I detest the taste of vinegar cider are the reasons that I feel this stuff is absolutely horrible!

This is followed by a well balanced dark malt flavor intermingling with caramel and a spicy but mild hop finish.

There is no yeast particles, and there is no yeast in the bottom of the bottle (corked, wrapped in tissue paper, plain green bottle) The head is gorgeous...light tan, creamy in appearance with immaculate retention and some of the best lacing I've ever seen. The head sits atop small to medium-sized bubbles and seems to last forever. The aroma? Oh bliss, bliss and heaven. Gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh...sweet and sour, rotting cherries and oranges, natural apple cider gone bad, deep amber malts, a distant hint of clove, dirty socks, and a faint whiff of alcohol. This gets the parotids kicking into gear. Carbonation is mild, especially when compared to most other Belgian Ales. Mouthfeel is very mild, smooth, creamy, slightly cloying...the body is suprisingly moderately light. Taste begins with some musty puckering sourness, brown sugar, firm amber malts, and a brief note of alcohol. There is a metallic note, which is something I hadn't noted on my last tasting which was all of 10 years ago (Goudenband is hard to find in Michigan..I brought this bottle back home with me from Amsterdam for 2 Euro). The finish is sustained, earthy and (despite it's sourness) is only slightly dry with notes of dates, rotting fruits, and sweet dark molasses cookies. As it warms, this beauty breathes and the flavors evolve, making it exceptionally drinkable. One bottle leaves me with a warm pleasant buzz, but this is something I could drink all night...and all day, and all next week. Ahhh...Goudenband. Truly an exceptional beer, an absolute joy and a must to behold. I am left stunned with a shit-eating grin on my face...seek it out.","Mitchster","May 09, 2003"

Ripe cherries beats off sweet malt. The battle rages on in a long finish,only to bring a smile to my face. The texture is creamy and buttery, making the tastebuds tickle. This is a world classic.

Mild hints of cobwebs and earth throughout. Lively at first, this beer feels a little less carbonated at the end, but it hardly takes away from the quality of the beer. And perhaps one of the most impressive things about this beer is its amazing drinkability; this does not taste like an 8% abv beer.

Mellow vanilla-like oak, hint of carob, unripe plums and darkly caramelized sugar in aroma. Mild notes of wet horse Brettanomyces w/ trace cheesy hops become easily discernible as the brew breathes. Deceptively restrained aromawise. Assertive, nearly pucker inducing lactic tartness hits and envelopes the palate at first. Tartness then mellows slightly to allow earthy, mildly toasted oak notes to emerge concomitantly with a sweet & sour melange of kumquats and unripe cherry. Earth tinged wild yeast must emerges late along with an overshadowed, yet complementing hint of buttery, deeply caramelized malt. Smooth and softly dextrinous with an agreeably fluid, light viscosity. Both creamy, yet crisp in mouthfeel. Finishes with a abrupt snap of brown sugar sweetness, but otherwise well attenuated and cleanly tart with a continuation of overripe red currant tartness. Goudenband is a complex and delicious brew that morphs continually as it breathes. There's a tremendous depth of tartness overall slightly offset with a balmy caramelized malt presence. Superbly refreshing, yet satiating in nature. A true favorite of mine.","marc77","Jan 09, 2003"
