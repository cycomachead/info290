"Booze? It's here but like the hops. you'll never notice it. I haven't had much in the way of beers from Flanders or in a Flanders Oud Bruin style but this was much easier than I was led to have guessed and proof that more breweries should give something like this a go. The subtle complexity made me want more and if it was just a tad less potent, this would make for a fabulous session beer."

"The nose hints of wet horse blanket, light tartness, a blend of fresh and over ripe fruit. Pours reddish brown with a slight haze under a tan tinted finely bubbled 1” white foam cap. This is not as intensely sour on the palate as other Flemish Red Ales coming across a little sweeter and tamer with fruit, plums, cherries, and malt but no chocolate or roast and just a little tang with a sweet tart finish. It has a medium body and low medium carbonation."

"a little steep i think at ten bucks a go, but pretty cool beer here. is a flanders red type through and through, with its vinegar sour profile and sweet malt middle. this is interesting to looks at, not much head, very syrupy texture, and a lot of haze, even for the style. it smells nice, rich and fruity, almost gummy on the malt body, red malt transcends the caramel realm for dark ripe fruit, apple, and bread pudding. the flavor matches the nose, with moderate acidity balanced out by dried fruity sweetness. cherry and raisin come to mind, brown sugar, lemon. the sweetness and the vinegar are weird, and i am glad i am sharing the bottle, but the beer does appear to be quite traditional. have not seen this in out market here until recently. more body than the style calls for makes it linger a little too long and lose some of its refreshing qualities, but its mature beer, far out, and tasty on the whole, especially if you like the traditional belgian sour red types. Lots and lots of barrel here, if that's your thing"

"Nice, but would be better if it was more sour."
"Tangy. Tastes a little like a cross between a beer and a wine."
""
"Expected this to be a bit more sour"
""
""
""
""
"Not to my taste. A little too sweet and woody for me with the taste of the barrel."

"O: It's got some nice flavors but too sweet. It could have used a little bit more sharpness to finish it. Somewhat lacks the complexity of other oud bruins."
""
""
"O - Not as sour as some others I have tried (or are my taste buds adjusting?), but very tasty and well done."
""
""
""
"A little too syrupy.It's similar to Rodenbach."
""
""
"O – A flavorful beer, a little too heavily balanced toward the sweetness for me to love it. Good, but fairly unremarkable, especially for a style that tends toward complexity."
""
"Overall:  Very good Grand Cru with intriguing flavors, nice warm buzz from 6.5 Abv, will definitely get again.  Expiration April 29th 2019"
""
""
""
"Cherry's what I first said, then I read sour apple on here. I'll stick with the former. Pronounced, forward, anything but shy, like a tart dubbel. The yeast and malt are prominent. This is as close as I'll get to enjoying a sour. I can't ever really pick up the alcohol with sour's either."

"This was a pretty good Oud Bruin. It's probably a little sweeter than typical, but that's ok with me."
""
""
"Mild tartness greets the palate along with brown sugar, port and vinegar. Sherry notes from oxidation, along with a nice cherry flavor. Medium bodied, well carbonated, tart mineral finish. Musty oak, faint herb and grass, but moreso a pretty solid oud bruin ale. Cocoa like malt underneath a light tartness. Overall, pretty good beer here, Id reach for this again."
""
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Belgian style Flemish Red Ale, matured in oak barrels."
""
""
"O- Great beer. Will have again. The sourness is relatively mild and the flavor is not as heavy as others in the style. I will still have it again."

"The beer had a tart wine like aroma. Very little head on the pour/ almost none. Dark red in color. The beer starts with a fruity (plum maybe) tartness and ends with a hint of the oak. There is a malt backbone from start to finish. The tartness is really carried by the carbonation the bubbles have a very fine feel in the mouth."
""
""
"O: apart from the surprise explosion the beer is good, slightly less depth than others in the style, explosive carbonation is a drawback"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, there are better Flemish beers out there, but this is a pretty good representation of the beer in general, and cheap compared to some others."

"Very bland. I didn't know what to expect with this one. But I've had quite a few sours now - of various styles, including Flanders & Flemish Reds, Browns, etc. This one didn't have much flavor to speak of, no tartness, not very sour. Sort of like a flat soda without the sweetness. I actually only got through about 1/3 of my tulip, and I laid it on the arm of my couch, and it actually spilled over on top of me and my couch cushions, and I didn't feel too bad about it. I won't be buying this one again."
"O: Overall a very enjoyable beer. Good flavor, and tastes like it was the easiest thing in the world to make. Smooth, succulent and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Pours a clear mahogany with a medium tan head with impressive lacing. Aromas of vinegar, and super ripe fruit. Taste begins with some super tart cherry, followed by a hint of grain, then some woody, mouth puckering sour finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a nice sour beer."
"overall a solid example of a flemish red. very tasty and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light a fairly robust red wine with a light fizz to it. It's got a solid depth to it and flows very nicely. It has a pretty easy finish."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma and the mouthfeel. There is big perfume, funk, and sweetness from the aroma, hitting most of the necessary notes quite nicely. The taste, however, was a bit curious as none of the tartness (or substantial oak) lingers through the sip. It hits hard at the front of your teeth, but is all but indiscernible through the end and aftertaste, where basic cooked brown maltiness predominates. This is partially rectified by the soft, creamy slurp of the feel. In conclusions we did not feel that our bottle was infected. This beer marks a good representation of the style, but lacked enough jazz or cohesion to pull it to the next level."
""
""
"This is one of my favorite styles and I was happy to find another example I had never tried before. Not a bad beer, but the lactic notes kind of spoil it for me. There are far better examples out there."
""
""
""
""
"O - not an outstanding Flanders, but I enjoyed drinking it. Conservative without being weak and probably a good gateway to more extreme examples of the style."
"Not a bad sour, but I believe I'd reach for others first."
"Though brown in its color, I would better consider this beer to be a Flander's red ale rather than an Oude Bruin- It's much sharper and cherry-like that the must-friendly brown ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Murky brown color with reddish highlights, this beer has a thick, tan, small bubbled head. Lots of carbonation. The smell is of candy apple and earth. Musty, mixed with a tangy sweet scent. Lots of yeast scent as well. The taste is both sweet and sour, with a little slant to the tangy side. Not quite mouth puckering, but rather cleansing. Fuller in body than I expected. This is a nice beer, on style, and very approachable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as the taste goes this is definitely a sour ale with notes of cherry and a low but lingering bitterness. I will admit that sours are not top on my list of styles but this one was not bad."
""
""
"Overall- This has been a confusing beer to me. Not the best Oude Bruin, but a decent one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is not the best oud bruin I've had, it lacked complexity and punch on the tongue, and it was a touch over-carbonated for the style; but a little more sour-power and this thing might move up a few notches. That being said, the appearance and aroma were pleasing."
"Overall a beer I could really get into. Has the full fledge wild fermentation aspect along with a very realistic beer body. Perhaps a little sweet but that compliments the tartness."
""
""
"Tough to avoid the comparison here but, try it, and you may agree. It's a great beer, all the same."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I had never seen this on the shelf before and I'll never pass up the chance to try a new Flanders. I think I paid $6 for this bottle and it definetly wasn't worth that. If you literally had no other sour options fine but it is the definition of mediocre."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with mid-level carbonation that creates a fairly creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Finish is dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
"Overall it's basically flawless, and a pretty good example of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall – While it has some nice aromas and fruit flavors upfront, the very vinegary flavors sort of turn me off (this is not really my style of beer; so if you like sours it has some nice characteristics, but if you don’t like sours then….)"
"O - Pretty nice. Definitely an oud bruin, not a flanders. Would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Moderately malty, fruity, aged oakiness, slightly sour. Not the best, but certainly good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Nice. Enjoyed it as it captured the flavours I was expecting properly and fit the style. Balanced accordingly. Nice stuff."
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly dry, fairly light. Overall, it's not bad, but it's no Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"Appearance is a burgundy color with fluffy looking white head. On the nose, there is cherry, wood and sourness. This one looks like it is going to be fairly sour. Upon sipping, sure enough that aspect was there, along with more of those cherries. Some Belgian candy and yeast was also part of the flavor. Mouthfeel on this one was dry, nice carbonation. Some of that tart quality sits on your palate for a bit. Certainly one, to have some water and/ crackers afterwords."
""
""
"Overall - It's harsh and too oaky. The flavors aren't inherently bad, but the feel just cancels out all benefits."
"O: Very enjoyable and extremely easy to drink, this beer is not as tart/sour than some of the others in the style. This beer is very approachable and definitely one that I would like to enjoy again."
"Overall. A bit too sweet for me. Tasted good but I won't be in a hurry to drink it again."
""
"Great nose, good looking but the taste didn't rise to the occasion. Still a very nice Flanders that I probably should have held onto another year before cracking open. I'll go pick another one up."
"The liquid comes out looking dark reddish in hue with some brown strokes set within. A nice fuzzy coca cola like head skims up with some tightness and a off tan color to it. No stick on the glass. Smell is pretty much deep vinegar with some faint cherry scent and some grain. Trace amounts of caramel notes, but this one is all about the vinegar. Taste is sweet over sour and it's very apparent. Vinegar, cherry, cola, sweet malt, you get the picture. Very reminiscent of Duchesses. Feel is less than medium, a nice crisp carb and not acidic, not a pucker inducing beer, but pleasant, I just cant stand the vinegar. I could only drink 6oz of this before passing on it."
""
""
"O: I like it. to my lips it's as simple as a sour brown ale, and I normally don't like brown ales. I can't imagine drinking more than 12 oz of this, it kinda baffles me that so many sours are served in 750mL bottles... I'll finish the bottle happy that I tried it though."
""
"Verdict- I have mixed feelings about this beer. I definitely appreciate the aroma, the beer didn't seem too complex at first whiff but after about 4 more tries I started picking up the chocolate notes, it definitely surprised me how complex the aroma was. Still, the taste just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a little more sour and not so much sweetness. I'm not saying it was very sweet, but it did have that slight doppelbock caramel note I was not expecting in a flemish sour. I would try again if offered but Im not going to go out of my way to seek it out. I would rather recommend Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour for someone who is new to sours, it may not be as complex but it is definitely more enjoyable IMO."
"Overall; great beginers sour. Could be a sour you can have more than one of. Which might be what I do."
""
"Overall, this was a good drink, but it didn't set itself aside as something I'd pick up again."
""
"I forogt what I paid for this one-- under a 12oz bottle-- so $$$ per bottle is always a part of the equasion."
""
"Tastes like it smells. Very smooth and sweet for a Flanders--I split this with a friend as a way to preface drinking an Upland Gilgamesh, so he could see if he liked sour beers before I went and opened up an expensive bomber of a beer so tart it makes your cheeks burn. This--this was not a proper preface. Still, it was pretty darn good on its own."
""
""
""
"Ichtegem’s Grand Cru is easy drinking and enjoyable. However, the draught version I had yesterday was far superior."
""
"Older refrigerated bottle,2009, poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark mahogany amber with red tints. Half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing, looks nice. Aroma of cherry, light fruit, wood, lightly vinegar and sour. Flavor is sour and acidic, but balanced by a cherry flavored sweetness. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Nice interaction of the sour and sweet. I do not favor sour beers but this one works quite nicely for me. Worth a periodic revisit. Older refrigerated bottle, probably from 2009."
""
"Overall- Bummer. It started out great and I was really excited until I tasted it. I thought there was going to be more of a sour tartness to it. There wasn't. I also expected more carbonation. Bummer. 2.5/5"
""
""
"O: A good beer, not overly impressive but one I was glad to try. This one was a ""pick a random Belgian beer and buy it"" purchase and I'm not disappointed. I probably won't seek it out again though."
""
"O: Kind of a let down, this was not nearly sour or tart enough to satisfy that sour-ale addiction. Not a bad beer, but it's not the mouth watering sour ale that I (and many others) crave from this style."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a good, enjoyable beer. I’ve had examples of the style that are more complex and delicious, but this is one is worth trying."
""
"Pours a dark reddish color with a one finger cocoa head. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. Very dark and impossible to see through. The nose is nice- sour fruit, some grain, cherry, plum, and slight alcohol in the background. The taste is nice and tart, with some funk, sour fruit, and a definite bite to the aftertaste. Not quite as complex as I'd hoped, and a little on the sweet side for the style. Still, not shabby at all. Overall, this is a good brew for the style, but you can find better. Cheers."
""
""
"This is my first experience with this style and it has left we wanting to explore more Flanders red ales. A quality beer."
"Future outlook: I actually took my own advice to start drinking some ""Flanders"" type beers more often....good for me. Think it might be time to sock a few away for aging purposes..."
"Not bad. A bit less sharp than I like -- flavors are there, but a bit soft. Still, a very worthy brew. I'd have this again."

"(D)- A solid flanders. The taste and feel were a bit of a letdown when the appearance and smell were great, but this is still quite and enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"Overall this is great. Something totally different than what I'm used to, but very enjoyable. Now I""m on a quest to find other Grand Cru's aged in bourbon barrels."
"Overall Drinkability - Powerful but balanced. No off characters."
"Good sour taste, impressed, sometimes flanders come off a little weak in that department, especially when they're relatively cheap and available like this one. Really a good introduction that isn't watered down or so pase its lame. Cherry is the most fruit specific flavor that exists in it. Gritty acidic tannin like qualities to it. Mild woody flavor. Enough sweetness to it to approach balance. Ultimately finishes dry."
"O: Not a bad beer, would be interested to see if it gets more sour with time. It's not a bad beer by any means, the flavor has some off-tones and that's my primary complaint - it's in the finish that I'm put off."
"O - Great sour/dry Flemish ale with a nice background of natural cherry."
"Overall, this is a neat beer and my first in this style. I'm definitely interested in trying more."
"Drinks like a Flemish Red with no lack of delicious, funky, Belgian action."
"This beer pours a red heavy amber in color, between light and medium in body with a white lacing around the glass. It smells of lightly sour milk and of a stale amber ale. It's really, really subtle for the style and doesn't offer very much. It tastes of a sweet and soured malt. There isn't much complexity, isn't any vinegar, but it does have a light Miracle Whip component. It drinks light and is equally between sweet and an actual sour. It's mediocre all around. I expected more from a Grand Cru, despite the ratings."
"O: This was a bit of an awkward one, I think the oak was either far too young, or the beer itself is too young. It's quite different in many ways, but the acidity is really the most dominant aspect of the flavor. Unfortunately this one drinks more like medicine than it does beer; and makes you feel like the small bottle is more than enough."
"O: In the tearful words of Tyra Banks ""I was rooting for you!"" I really did want to enjoy this, but the light, funky flavor had me feeling ripped off. It's not an ""offensive"" beer, it just doesn't blow me off my swivel chair."
" All in all a nice drinking, lighter alternative to some of the heavy hitting sours. Won't blow your mind but shouldn't disappoint either."
"Pretty solid, nothing jumping out at me. Good level of sourness, though a little vegative mid sip."
"-not necessarily a big fan of this beer. with that being said, the front end taste of the beer i didn't mind. glad i tried it, but that's probably it"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for a sour beer that isn’t too sour."
"Overall -- I struggled to finish the glass. A menagerie of strange off-flavors with only a shadow of Flanders Red character. I was hoping for a cost-effective Flanders fix, but this ain't it. I'm glad I tried it only because I'm a big fan of the style. If you're considering tying your first Flanders Red, DO NOT start here!"
"A very sessionable Flanders Red. Not over the top like many I've had, but scaled back with enough to be typical of the style. Brown red and opaque, no head retention or lace. Sour fruit aroma and start. Not nearly as sour as many Flanders Reds I've had but still with the tartness and fermented apples taste reminiscent of the style. Very little bitterness in the finish. Light body and medium-high carbonation."
"Quite a nice example of a Flemish sour... didn't know that aged sours existed, but this one is quite worthwhile, though there's no oak in the taste."
"EDIT: The distributors confirmed that this beer and Strubbe's Flemish Red Ale Grand Cru ( http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2299/28420 ) are identical beers despite having different labels."
"One thing is for certain is that it's not a tongue slayer, nor a palate ripper, I's not going to punish with puckering. Perhaps ""Flemish Red"" on the front and ""our bruin"" on the back is a trifle misleading. If anyone's expecting Rodenbach or Jacobins, they'll be very disappointed. I've met some already who are…but not this guy."
"The preceding sips are the same. It is not my favorite Flemish red, but it is a good beer. Definitely worth trying."
"A good, clean, solid, honest, original beer. Smooth temptation. Exquisite with cheese."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a small 1/2 inch light brown head that fades to a film. Small amounts of random lace on the glass on the drink down. Smells of red wine vinegar, sour berries, and funk/must. Taste is somewhat sweeter than I was expecting. Grape juice, slight vinegar, unripe berries are the tastes I am getting from this beer. Better than average carbonation but it feels a bit lacking. Overall, a good beer but nothing I would seek out again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Opinion: This is a good beer, no doubt. Well crafted. It is bit light for my taste, but I really like Rodenbach...which has me jaded a bit. This isn't as much of an ""entry beer"" as others in this category, but it is a bit muted in the delivery for my taste. If you are going to go for it, knock me out. Otherwise, strive to be the Duchesse."
"O--It's a good representation of the style. It would be a good gateway beer into sours I believe. Not the best, but certainly not the worst."
"This brew was like a mix of sour cherries and apple cider vinegar. It was really tart and strong. This isn't something I'd ever drink an entire bottle of. I just can't get passed how sour it was. I love the red color that this brew has. Theres not much head at all. The mouthfeel is light and watery. I'm just not into the flavors this one has to offer."
"Taste is acidic, yeasty, with a lot of woody sweet-sour fruits, light woody-peppery bitterness at finish, hints of vinegar and metal. It's wonderful, engaging, and very drinkable."
"This one is easy enough to drink, but it lacks that fantastic sour-like nose, and the flavor is thick, rich and sweet and opposed to more crisp and sour."
"Cheers"
"Pours a bubbly 2 finger head of tan/reddish head. Body is a murky dark red. Smells of balsamic vinegar, pickles, white vinegar, touch of alcohol. Tastes sweet and malty, pickle vinegar, tart fruit(cherries, raspberries). Medium dry finish, medium/full bodied, medium/high carbonation. Quite nice overall. I'd like to have a bit more complexities in the taste and maybe a bit more in the smell too. Well balanced and I think I'd easily pick this up again at $3.50 a 11.2oz bottle"
"D - This is a good Flanders Red Ale. I've had better but it was certainly worth the selection from the store."
"D - a very interesting mix of fruit and beer. Is it the best mix I don't know."
"Verdict: Ok for the style, there are many better at this price point but a decent ale none-the-less."
"Overall a good, if not great beer."
"Not a fantastic Flanders Red but not awful either.... pretty mediocre."
"D-I could see this being a good gateway Flanders Red, but certainy not a great representation of the style."
"D: Pretty good, but this beer was kind of ""basic"". Not really what I was expecting. It's good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one. Not really worth the $4 for the 11.2oz bottle."
"It's subdued on the tongue, not terribly sour but rounded. Very vinous, white wine vinegar flavors hit the palate first. Mild acetic acid, mineral and oak, bit of a metallic twang mid-palate. The body is thin, carbonation surprisingly not excessive; guess most of it went to the head. Finishes with a mild metallic twang, some balsamic-like acetic acid and light oak tannins. Pretty nice stuff, easy to quaff or sit down and ponder for a while."
"D-Overall a light easy drinking sour with lots of flavor."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink because the taste isn't overly sour. I would definitely try this again."
"D - I like this beer a lot, and it will leave a nice suprise for you, its something a little different which I enjoy."
"Great moderately high carbonation creates a dry refreshing finish."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. A tingle of alcohol warmth is felt in the back of the throat. Easy drinking but a little bit of a mess. The cider verse sweetness didn't really do it for me."
"Drink - If sour and fruity is your thing, this one goes down no problem. More on the mild side of what can be accomplished with the style."
"Taste reflected the noise. Definitely sour, but not overwhelmingly so. Rather one dimensional, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"This beer is really nice, but it doesn't stand up to Duchesse, Goudenband, or Rodenbach Grand Cru...other killer examples of the style."
"It's a shame, because this beer promised a lot. But it eventually revealed itself as a pale imitation of the greats. It's not bad, and it's a tasty Belgian ale, but the style is so much better than this example would have you believe."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but far from the top of the class for this style"
"and another."
"D- Really disappointing. I wouldn't buy it again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Like I said before, if you would like a baseline for a decent flemish, grab a Rodenbach Grand Cru. For a nice complex oud bruin, grab a Haandbakk."
"A middle of the road Flander's Red. The punchy flavours of Rodenbach Grand Cru are not to be found but the overall flavour is okay."
"This is pretty tasty, a good example of the style. I would like a little more body and richness, but still quite good."
"All in all a good beer that I'm glad I picked up."
"D: Very drinkable for the style, I think. Not TOO high in alcohol and not so sour that you want to stop after one."
"Opaque dark red with a thin white head. Lovely wine-like smell with a strong vinegar essence. Delicious sour flavor that does indeed taste like cherries. Nothing like cough syrup or fake cherry flavor. A little too sweet, but still very good. Medium carbonation that was highly drinkable which really surprised me. This is the first beer of this type that I've had and I am really impressed. My belly warmed with each swig I took."
"11.2 ounce bottle, cap stamped with 29-09-2014. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is vinegar, tart apples and cherries, and some wood. However, the flavor isn't very tart at all. I can taste tart apples and cherries and vinegar, but there's also a lot of caramel malt and sweet dark fruit noticable. Don't get me wrong, I like the taste of this beer but the tartness isn't even close to what I expected. The taste is sweeter than the aroma would lead you to believe. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit coating with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent enough. I think it's a decent brew, but if you're looking for something sour I don't think this is the best choice."
"D-overall a great beer that may not be as strong as other beers but is extremely drinkable"
"Light lactobacillus tartness along with a mellow, slightly buttery and milky flavor. Malts are present and add weight, but not much flavor. Kind of lacks personality, but to its credit, there is nothing off-putting about this beer. Hint of oak in the dry finish. The mouthfeel was the best part, I thought. It was creamy, with a fine, cascading carbonation. Drinkability is good given the lack of intensity and relatively low ABV, but my overall impression is that this beer is missing something."
"Not a bad beer here, though not my favorite by far. Pours a nice ruby amber color with moderate sandy head. Smell is pretty normal for a Flanders Red Ale, though a but restrained. Lightly toasted malts with a hint of vinegar, some sweetness to it too. Taste follows, though the sour/vinegar flavors are really attenuated--I'm looking for a bit more out of this style of beer here. Drinks like a decent light brown ale, though I would have trouble picking it out as a Flanders. Dry on the finish, light and snappy. Decent drink, though I was looking for a bit more to this one."
"D: wish a sixer or four pack was cheap, this is very good and a nice change from the normal american craft."
"Ichtegem's Grand Cru is a solid representation of the Flemish Red. Worth trying if you're into the style."
"D: This is not a beer that could be pounded down in large amounts, but it is very enjoyable to sip on a bottle or two at a time."
"D - For this style, this is a very approachable and drinkable beer. If you have a wino friend that is looking for a beer, this is the one to give them."
"D: Overall another clunker from the sour beer crew, I had high hopes for this one."
"recommended if you love sours, its really a OLD bruin not sure why they keep added them to the red category, sure it s that on the bottle, but then contradicts itself in the native dutch go figure, who cares right? we drink more its good."
"D - decent sour. not interesting enough to pay import pricing."
"Deep red almost purple body, some carbonation rising from bottom of glass, very little lacing. Nose is dark fruit forward, dark cherries, no hops, a pretty dry nose despite the fruit character. Taste is cherries up front, tart and sweet, some hints of blackberries and concord grapes deep fruit flavor, minimal hops, and a wee bit of funk, some horseblanket funkiness on back end, a pretty complex tasting beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full for the style, a bit sticky, not a lot of effervescence. Pretty drinkable. More fruity than Rodenbach, IMO, wondering how the bottle version compares to this relatively rare keg."
"So, overall I enjoyed this. You have to be in the mood for something sweet, probably more so than with beers like the Dutchess or Rodenbach as there's less of the tart vinegar to balance things out. This was unique and I like beers that have distinctive qualities. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!"
"This is an above average flemish fed, worth trying to get different taste than the top two in this style but clearly a notch below."
"If you want a good entrance into the world of sour beers, this could be a good intermediate step. It doesn't overwhelm you with sour. The fruit sweetness might be a bit much, but it's not really cloying. The body is nice, but there are times when the tang reads as metallic on the tip of the tongue and the lips. Maybe it's something that was on my lips prior to my first sip."
"D)This is not my favorite style, however Ichtegem is an excellent example of the style. Those who like Flemish Ale will surely enjoy this one."
"D: While this is drinkable, this is not what I was expecting--thin and not nearly sour enough"
"Meh...enjoyable for what it offers; however, I probably won't go back to it."
"Decent but but monotone and fairly watery. I've been exploring the Flanders red style as of late and so far this is the most lackluster of the bunch."
"The taste is rather tart. Some cherry or plum and some grain in the background. A little sour and watery. This is a typical belgian taste."
"It's quite drinkable and not at all unpleasant, but a little underwhelming. If you're looking for sour/tart, go elsewhere."
"drinkability - a pretty bold red ale, complex, has some imperfections"
"Good, not my favorite Flanders ale by a long shot, but I like how it morphed halfway through. I'd have it again in the future, though one per sitting is sufficient."
"taste is carbonation, dark fruits, sour, and wild yeast, ends smooth and tart."
"D: Easy to drink -- given my analogy above to a margarita, this would be a nice beer to have as a cocktail before or during a spicy mexican dish. Not sure if I'd want to have more than one of two of these - I was ready to move onto something else after my first."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin considering the sweetness, drinkability is reasonable. I'll finish the bottle, but I wont buy another."
"I have now finished at 750 lm bottle and I still wouldn't say no to another one, even though this one took me some one and a half hours to finish."
"D - Too sweet for me, and it just overwhelms all of the intricacies that I look for in Flemish Sour."
"D: Nice and refreshing. A beer even for wine-snobs."
"I shouldn't have expected too much for this beer, but somehow I feel a bit disappointed and cheated. This is certainly not horrible, but to my preferences it is not sour or tart enough and it could use a bit more malt richness too, hell even some rustic funkiness would be welcome."
"Drinkability: I love the refreshing characteristics of sour ales. Ichtegem's Grand Cru is a solid, refreshing, tasty Flanders red that I could probably drink all day."
"D: As pleased as I was with the nose, I find the flavor to be a bit disappointing (to say the least). The fact that the beer is so heavily carbonated didn't do much for me either."
"This is a nice not too rabid, not too sweet Flanders Red Ale."
"Drinking one of these reminds me of a particular sparkling wine that many consume to ring in the New Year."
"D: pretty darn drinkable for the style... the modest flavors allow for a fair amount of consumption."
"D: A decent example of a Flemish sour ale, but not overly special."
"Poured into a tulip. Dark reddish brown with a nice tan head that retains itself longer than you'd expect with the acidity of the beer. Aroma is cherries, prunes, wood. Flavor is mainly a slimy cherry cola sweetness with some weird grapes and wood. It's got some tartness and acidity but no complexity or body. Mouthfeel is too carbonated and thin. Not buying this again."
"Hard to finish the 11 or so ounces I had."
"Nice citric limed malt finish. Hints of sour all around (and one almost wants it to be more sour) but very drinkable."
"D: Goes down fairly easy for a sour flanders, not drinkable, but good."
"bought a 750 ml bottle and shared with friends at a dinner..the color was a hazy brown /red with a great head and nice lacing it look good in the goblet and smelled of fruit mainly some tart cherries and some sourdough bread..the taste was delicious it was sour patch sweet with cherry tartness a hint of vinegar malt hops and some other fruit and spices..enjoy this one with friends like a bottle of wine or an aperitif before or with dinner"
"Drinkability is good. Easy-going and mellow with a solid fruit and barrel aged quality along with a solid profile. An all around good brew. Cheers!"
"Tastes of raisin, brown sugar, and a mild tart, mineral-like flavor to it. Not particularly tasty. Missing all of the tartness, acetic, or oak characters that I look for. Medium bodied, with a somewhat smooth medium level of carbonation. I finished the bottle, but was glad it did not come in a 750 mL size."
"D- I enjoyed the beer, and will purchase it again in the future. I have another bottle I want to share with a friend who likes the style."
"Procured from Red Carpet Wine & Liquor, Glendale, CA"
"D- Drinkable enough, but not my favorite Flemish Red/Brown... not as sweet as I would have liked, and not as sour as I would have liked either. All in all, this was a weaker version of the style, which left a lot to be desired."
"Lighter end of medium bodied and a bit watered down. I was expecting a fuller mouthfeel. Tart and puckering but much more of a vinegary sourness than expected. Lots of oak and vanilla character with a pleasant dark fruit flavor. Dark cherries, plum and raisin notes with a dry finish."
"Not a bad beer but doesn't nearly measure up to the better versions of this style."
"Although not a masterpiece, this isn't a bad rendition and only suffers based on comparisons with other, more established brews."
"Don't drink and review."
"A sweet, pleasing Flanders Red. This beer pours a brownish red color with a better than expected off-white head. The aroma is sweet and sour cherries with a touch of malt. The flavor is similar with a medium-light vinegar kick. My score is dropping as I go through my glass, which is never a good sign. There's a somewhat cloying syrupy character to the beer. I'm not good enough at beer tasting to tell if it's back-sweetened, but it tastes that way to me. If this beer was bone dry, I'd like it a whole lot more. As is, the sweet cherry flavor is growing acrid on my palate. It's not a bad beer, but I prefer a bit less sweet in my sours."
"A very drinkable example of the style. A malty complexity balances out the tart, though doesn't overwhelm it. Alcohol is very well hidden. It's not as strong as some others, but it has a nice uniqueness and is very drinkable."
"Served with very little head and no lace. Color is a dark, cloudy brown with some reddish highlights. Maybe a little light struck: some burnt rubber/skunk. Flavor's not quite as skunky as aroma and I get some of the nice tart malt with fruit in the background. Had another bottle of this here recently and it was much better - no skunk. Good mouth and carbonation. Skunk's gone at the end. Good finish. No sense of the alcohol at all. I'd try another"
"Edit: after looking at some of the other reviews, I wonder if I was served the correct beer, as my review doesn't sound like any of the other ones. I am reviewing from my tasting notes, and I left no indication that this one tasted sour at all."
"I was pretty disappointed here."
"The drinkability is high on my scale. The sour taste is such that it cleans my palate and tells me to keep coming back for more, yet there are enough other things going on that it never becomes too much. This beer will not blow you out of your seat in terms of sourness like some Flanders, but I think that it is still a nice representation of the style."
"Would go out of my way to find again."
"I found myself losing interest after the first few sips, knocking a few points off drinkability. It's an easy-drinking beer, but you simply find yourself bored with it very quickly."
"D: I must admit, I am not familiar with this style of beer. I typically do not enjoy Belgian beers for their lactic sourness, but this beer was different. The sourness, and I use the word sour for lack of a better term, was akin to the sourness or acidity present in wine, was well balanced, and was in no ways distracting or offputting. This was a very good beer. It was a pleasure to drink and paired well with food. I could not see it being one I could drink repeatedly as the unique flavor profile could be fatiguing, but, otherwise, quite enjoyable."
"d- If this was a little less sweet, and/or was a bit more sour this would be better. The sweetness lingers on the palate a bit too long."
"The aroma is sweet and sour with vinegar, fruit, and oak. The appearance is amber with a large head and floating particles. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. The finish is sour. Overall it's sweeter than most of the style but this is probably likable for many that like the style. I have had better."
"This might have been aged a little... but I'm not sure."
"D - Slight promise in appearance and smell but all down hill from there."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but frankly I prefer more acidity. Just had Rodenbach's Grand Cru last night so I've got a very fresh impression for comparison, and prefer that for sure. Still it's not bad, exceptionally smooth."
"Pours a clear brown with dark cherry tinges and a medium beige head. The foam subsides after a short period to leave a thin film and some lacing. Smells fairly sour, with some fruit notes coming through. Sweet malt in the background, along with some woody earthiness. The taste echoes this, with a sharp, though not overpowering, sourness at first. As the palate gets accustomed to this, some vinous notes become evident and the crystal malt comes through. Finishes dry and oaky. Smooth feel thanks to the medium body and low carbonation. A pretty decent oud bruin."
"This might be the most drinkable beer I've ever had. It is light, refreshing, and keeps begging for partners to follow. Great brew!"
"D: Certainly a different take on the style than the more lactic character in something like Rodenbach. An interesting experience, I think any sour fan should try it out."
"I had not heard a lot about this beer, but it was very enjoyable. It was quite a bit different, earthier and full-bodied, though less complex, than the Duchesse. Pick a bottle of this up if you happen to see it."
"D: At 6.5%, not one of the strongest of the style I've had. As such it is pretty drinkable and could probably have a couple."
"Slightly murky reddish brown with a thin cap of dark beige foam. The collar was a bit rocky with fine bubbles covering the beer. Light tartness in the aroma, berries and unripe fruits, a little earthy, very slightly acetic. Mild sourness with a bit of toffee amid the berry, cherry and red grape fruit flavours and the leafy earthiness. A bit more acidic in the finish as the other flavours faded. Medium to light bodied with lowish carbonation, a bit viscous. Easy drinking and probably a good introduction to the style for those not already into sour beers."
"This seems like a very simple beer, only very slightly tart/tangy and not much complex sourness or funkyness. Very drinkable."
"Nothing special about this, and I think I'll stick with the Duchesse."
"D- Nice easy to drink. Not a good beer to start some one with this style with but a nice version of it. Worth a try if you see it."
"Reddish with a little white head. Medium plus mouthfeel. Pleasant flemish red aroma. Easy drinking, to the last drop. Nice balance with a little vinegar and well done sweet offset.A moderate cherry. The mildest of oak. Tasty one.Understated carbonation."
"it pours a froathy brown, I didnt hate it but i felt like I was drinking a newcastle, and for the money I think it would rather just drink newcastle"
"D: This is fairly easy to drink, at least until you swallow this beer. I'm not sure I'll finish it, probably let it sit for an hour before i continue drinking"
"Overall: this one is deceptive, looks like a flemish sour and smells kinda like one, but does not taste like what I have associated with the style to taste like. Still very unique and approachable and would be incredibly food friendly."
"All in all, I'm starting to enjoy Grand cru's, and I found this one to be a little rougher then some of the others I have tried recently. I'm not sure how Grand Cru's age, but I'm thinking that with a year or two some of the tart and bitter flavors would mellow out a bit."
"D: drinkable but not worth $5"
"Moderate level of carbonation, but it has a filmy slickness at the end that is distracting. Overall it's a little too dull to pique sustained interest. Worth trying but not a repeat buy. Rodenbach buries this by a landslide, Oud Bruin or not."
"pours a murky brown with a red hue. very light brown head, small, no lace. smell is malty. light cherry. taste is quite doughy that has a oaky and vanilla like quality. strong lingering taste of oak on the palate. light fruit... cherry with hint of grape and black berry. there is some tart, but it blends with everything evenly. not very strong. very nice mouthfeel. easily passes for a oud bruin in the likes of a rodenbach."
"Overall I was impressed. I'm just now getting into sours, but I was a fan of the way none of the flavors were too overpowering in this beer. Certainly worth a shot."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's not a bad beer, but for the style it's inaccurate and boring."
"Mouthfeel was mild in the beginning with a zesty swallow."
"My local bar keeps this stocked, and I sometimes order 2 or 3 in a session. I ask for the gouda beer. Very good stuff."
"Super-dark, brown with red tints if you hold it up to the light. It smells pretty good, like sour vinegar and then sweet. The taste is slightly sour, very easy to drink. This is not nearly as intense as some of the other flemish red's like La folie or La Roja. Thanks to RBlWthaCoz for this interesting brew."
"Easy drinking, for the style and yet this is a sipping beer because there is plenty going on. I don't remember what I paid for my 330ml bottle. I know I purchased it in Council Bluffs, IA. If it is priced reasonably I'd buy more of this. While not the best of the style it is unique and that is good enough for me. Worth a try."
"Pours a dark, clear brown with a ruby hue and a thin creme head. Nose is mildly funky, fruity, and sour. Flavor is smooth but almost mild in a way. There's some cherry to it and some wood, but overall it doesn't really go crazy with anything. Feel is smooth on liquid and the carbonation is a bit lower. Overall an easier drinking Flanders."
"The sweet and sour aroma carried on into the taste, the Oak Barrels used to age this beer adds a cherry and almonds hint to everything. Easy to drink and pleasing in every way. This is an interesting beer and well worth finding."
"Taste is tart, but in a mild way. It does dominate the whole beer, but is not toothaching sour. The wood aging is oaky and dark. Again a nice spiciness coming from the yeast which reminds me of coriander and lemongrass. Body is medium. Although I am not a fan of sour beers, this beer is very well drinkable and once you get through the initial sourness of the first sip, it is a great thirstquencher."
"This beer might not be the most complex in its style, but it is a very refreshing and highly drinkable beer. I enjoyed it."
"D - I've been on a sour kick when I can get them on tap lately (started by Allagash Rosa) and this beer did not disappoint. Massively sour and funky. I really enjoyed it. I can see how this would not be for some, but I'd love to try more of these. Obviously drinking too many of these would probably have the same effect as drinking too many hop bombs (blown tastebuds), but I would've gladly had another."
"D: Drinks much bigger then its advertised 6.5%. A good desert beer that would make for an ample substitution of red wine at any meal."
"Mouthfeel was ok...not a beer I will buy again."
"Solid pour, brown color with amber highlights along the glass's edges. Off-white creamy head, one finger that slowly dissolves down to a quarter inch film and then holds. Nose only starts to come through once the beer warms up. Mildly sour, with salty malt. Light toffee sweetness, and lightly vinous. Not bad, but certainly not overpowering nor overly complex. Flavor is nice. Dry swarthy spiced sour malt up front. That sourness heats up as the beer goes on. Dirty, lightly roasted feel shows up as well. Light toffee sweetness. Mostly sour overall. Body is solid, appropriate to the style, and the carbonation works well with the sourness. Overall, I was in the mood for a sour brew, and this one hit the spot. It's not really blowing my mind- and I could do with some more complexity - but its a solid beer, if it fits what you're looking for."
"I applaud the COOP and Matt and Ashton for honestly getting in some truly unique beers into the market recently and especially in the last year.. Cheers to expanding Boise's palate."
"Feels medium bodied with ample carbonation. An interesting beer that is worth a try."
"A very nice beer. Didn't recognize it on the beer list here at Max's and thought I'd give it a shot. Glad I did."
"Ichtegem's Grand Cru tingles and pops. The very light carbonation really allows all the flavors and subtleties to be easily detected. Medium bodied, with a coating finish. I wish i could drink this rather often, but this one hurts the wallet. At 6.99 a bottle for a beer that is no longer produced i guess it is still a great deal none the less."
"Earthy, mushy fruit malt up front. Metallic cherry tartness cuts in. Slightly sugary fruit malt in the background. Some oak and vanilla before tartness and balsamic vinegar take over. Lingering cherry tartness and faint sweetness. Fruit skins in the finish. Nice. Different. I need to start drinking more Flanders Red Ales!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a subtle sourness that yields to the oak barrel aroma. It's well rounded with crystal and roasted malts; very nice. The taste is good. It has a subdued sour flavor that really works well with the oak aging. It's mellowed out and thus increases the drinkability. The malt content consists of some pale and roasted malts. It's doesn't appear to be too sweet. On the contrary, it's dry and quite light in the mouthfeel. It's a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer. I love the oak contribution. It tames the sourness to a level that most would enjoy."
"This Flanders Red is not heavy at all, and it does leave the mouth dry. A nice sipper though with some wine like qualities that one would not expect in a relatively low ABV beer."
"Poured a murky reddish brown with a thin head. Sweet fruity aromas followed by a dose of lightly acetic sourness. More sweeet than sour, but only slightly. There is also a slight vegetal aroma and some dusty smelling fruit. The taste is a little light, and once again more on the sweet than the sour side. Still, none of the unpleasant vegetal odors manifest in th taste at all. Mouthfeel is very fizzy, a little too much so. Overall, this beer is a little too sweet for the style for my taste and a bit out of balance. Not bad, but there are a number of better options."
"D- Easy to drink, but sadly nothing special. disappointing."
"complex. Worth a try."
"Maybe it's just a sour ale for beginners, but I liked it."
"D - I could have gone for another. The boldness of this one won me over after I got over the initial shock of it's peculiarity."
"Overall this was a fine example of the style and really nice sour ale; I had not had one in a good while so this was a nice treat. Very nice presentation and aroma, and the flavor more then backed it up. I would gladly have another one of these any day."
"It was worth a shot. Perhaps a younger bottle would've faired differently."
"Drinkability: Definitely has some interesting components and is very drinkable. However, it doesn't have as much in the way of sourness as others in the style."
"Drinkability: Again, a strange mix of flavors and probably something you won't expect will come ou of the bottle. I'd love to get some more just to see how another bottle would compare. I found it to be delicious and quite drinkable. The buttery texture and flavor is fun in a sour beer."
"Cheers!"
"drinkable?: needs more zing, its nice but it needs more sour power."
"Not spectacular, but quite interesting."
"Drinkability: Yes sir, Itchy Gems makes a pretty fine Flanders Sour Ale."
"I really enjoy tart beers, and this one is no exception. It is quite complex and easy to drink, but falls slightly shy of greatness. Nonetheless, those who enjoy this style should certainly give this one a try."
"Had this on tap. The sourness was very unique. I was not a huge fan of the sourness of this beer. Most times I find the sourness to be appealing, but this one I thought actually tasted metalic, but after drinking more I do not think it was a metalic taste but a weird aftertase from the sourness. I didn't think it was all that great as a flanders red, balance was not there and the complexity that I usually find in Flanders Reds was severly lacking."
"Was able to give this brew a try last evening. It is a style I really like but very infrequently have so this was a treat. The brew was poured to a dark reddish color with a creamy head that was medium in size and left nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. Nice berry aroma, mostly cherry I believe along with a slight vinegar sourness that is subtle but noticeable. The taste is very smooth with a tart berry flavor, to me the berries come out more clearly here with raspberries, cherries, and maybe plum? Has a sourness to it but does not seem to be a pronounced as in some other Flanders red offerings. Over all I think that this is a nice offering, very tame beer based on the style which has its good points. I would get this brew again in the future."
"This sourness of this one is unique. Try it if you like the style for sure."
"Smell is pretty non existant, not as much funk as I like. Taste is very good, only a light sourness unfortunately (I like to pucker), but it tastes great regardless of the sourness (or lack thereof). I could probably drink this all afternoon, and in fact may do just that. :)"
