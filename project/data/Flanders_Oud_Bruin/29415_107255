3.62,-2.9,3,3.5,3.75,3,4,"375ml bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into tulip. Beer is clear dark amber with a tall khaki head that quickly collapses to nothing. Aroma is citrus, oak, spice, dried fruit, and brett funk. Taste is tart/sweet citrus and dried fruit, woody/nutty bitterness, and just a touch of bourbon heat. Medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long drying, warming finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 21, 2015"
