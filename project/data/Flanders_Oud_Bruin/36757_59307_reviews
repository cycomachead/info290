"o: my only knock on this beer is the almost too harsh of a burn from the alochol, other than that I like it."

"O - This is a very good sour ale. I really enjoyed this ale."
"Overall, this was a decent sour, but I am beginning to release a lot of these sour browns/reds have a lot of similar flavors. They taste good, but they are becoming over populated. Decent drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, mild CO2, puckering but balanced and addictive."
