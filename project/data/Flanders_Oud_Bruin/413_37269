4.75,42.2,,,,,,"Amazing !   Dark in color, a deep copper with reddish hues.  Clear, yet thick.  No haze, no floaties, just deep rich color.  A decent foam head that fades a little quickly, but leaves a trace of lacing.  The malt aroma is great, sweet, with very mild hops aroma.  Flavor is rich and malty, some darker grain, good hop balance - more would destroy this beer.  Almost has a creamy element to it.  Mouthfeel is smooth with good texture.  No bite, carbonation is perfect.  I love this beer !  This brewery never fails to impress.  The beer has a good alc content without any of the ""winey"" off flavors, twang or sourness.   I could drink this all night -might regret it later with the 6% and 22oz bottles, but damn it is good !","Curtis","Aug 25, 2014"

3.74,12,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"I am really impressed with the appearance on this beer. A moderately aggressive pour down the middle of the glass produced a three finger fluffy off white head. It has slowly dissipated leaving half a finger of tight bubbles. Carbonation is streaming off the bottom of the glass. Color is a cloudy burnt orange at the edges of the glass becoming a deeper amber in the center. The nose is a little bland with Belgian yeast esters taking over most of the aroma. A slight caramel malty sweetness is detected as well as a mineral earthyness. There is maybe a tiny hint of funk. Taste is much better than the aroma. Up front I get caramel sweetness and a traditional Belgian ale yeast taste. In the middle of the palate I start to get the slightly sour notes. My mouth puckers for a moment, but on the back end it is taken over by an earthy bitterness that is a little overwhelming. Dry finish. I get where other reviewers have been coming from. I would have really liked the earthy bitterness to at the back end to have been replaced by a puckering sourness to complement the caramel sweetness. That said, a highly enjoyable and drinkable ale and perhaps serves as a good ""introduction"" to sour beers.","spark3148857","Dec 24, 2013"

Some wood like smells tingle the nose as well. Taste is weak, but some fruit like flavors are mostly present; apples, cherries, grapes. Aftertaste is a woody vanilla flavor. Not a whole lot more in terms of flavor, a bit one dimensional. Mouthfeel is a light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation.
