"Overall - Complex and flavorful. All the flavors are distinct and still work well together."

"D - A solid beer that's easy to drink. Not too acidic, nor too boozy, with sufficient complexity and depth, and good balance between the various flavors. I'd happily drink this again and hope Brad keeps making it."

"Nice to have tried it but won't be searching it out again."

"O: I love this beer. Sour cherry, tartness, and sweet toffee mix extremely well together. It's quite balanced and flavorful. I often find the acidity overtakes this style, but the sourness is mild and balanced by fruitiness and caramel sweetness in this beer. Probably the best beer I've had of this style."

"Another very good bottle from Jackie O's. Good complexity with a good mix of sweet and sour."

"O: One of the best beers in the ""sour"" family of beer I have ever had. This is one you just have to try to really get the gist of all the things that are going on with this beer. I don't give out ""5" ratings lightly, and imo this beer has earned that distinction."

"4.0 D: Tasty beer. I haven't had an oud bruin in a while and this was a good reintroduction to the style. Solid all around."
"O. A good oud bruin. Could use a little bit more pucker, but it hits the right notes."

"Smells tart and cherry heavy. A bit muddled. Pretty nice flavour profile. Lots of cherry, oak, tart but not acidic. Again a bit muddled but pretty tasty. Overall well carbonated and quite enjoyable"

"aroma is wonderfully balanced, just a fantastic blend of tart cherries, wood, light notes of vinegar, plums, all sorts of dark fruits and a wonderfully balanced sour profile. smooth and effortless each sip was truly a pleasure and really set this apart with its depth. hints of leather, tobacco, smooth fruit notes, a touch of vanilla in the finish, it literally had it all and really you could not ask for much more."
"Pour yields a dark reddish-amber-brown brew with a thin head. Light lacing as it went down. The nose has a good amount of cherry plus some light acid. Mild bread character. The flavor brings some nice lightly-sweet malt plus cherry, dark fruits, oak, and a bit of sourness. Light acetic character, though mostly lactic. Oak in the background. The fruit is a nice touch. Medium body with a good sourness that melds well with all the other flavors. A solid brew for sure."
"On tap at One Funky Afternoon. 2008 version. A whop in the nose with tart cherries and old funk. Color is a deep mahogany, very slick looking with minimal head and lacing. Cant get over the smell, very rustic and mature. The taste is superb, very complex with layers of chocolate and tart cherries, the sour unravels into a deep heavenly experience. Wish they had bottled this one for the release."
"D-Dry, tart and delicious! A totally solid, well done and interesting old bruin! Well done Brad!"
"Chinga's Old Bruin is an interesting beer, but it is not something that will astound you."
"D - Pretty interesting sour beer with a distinct herbal character, though I'm still on the fence with this one. I enjoyed the chocolate character and the tartness, but at times the herbal attributes we are bit harsh and the dryness overpowering."
"Medium bodied with a good amount of puckering, funky dry Brett up front that is quickly countered by the rich chocolate malt, earthy oak and vinous dark fruit. Puckering at first but not acidic at all. Again, the malt presence is stronger than anticipated but it provides a nice silky chocolate, toffee, hazelnut presence that counters the dry Brett, earthy oak and tart dark berries. The barrel aging and cherries added provide a vinous note with hints of grape, tart dark cherries, plum and raisin. Slight vinegar flavors adds a slight sour character to the finish but this beer is well balanced and very quaffable."
"Overall, not the type of flavors I expect from the style. It was ok, but it just had some off flavors in it. Not something I drank a lot of."
"D: I quite liked this beer, especially after having a couple of terrible Oud Bruins lately."
"I drank the beer right as it came out of the fridge as well as when it had warmed to room temperature. I think the warmer the beer got, the better it got."
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/4"
"D: Whew, a beautiful brew: so balanced and pleasing. Not the most tart/'Belgian' of Oud Bruins, but a sipper that warrants some time to contemplate. Among the 'rarer' beer I've enjoyed in a while (both style-wise AND distribution-wise - SEVENTY-TWO BOTTLES? sheesh) and certainly one I'd want to repeat; again, huge thanks to Sam."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol is almost completely masked which get points in my book. The oak is prominent and done well. The idea of an organic brown gone sour makes for a good brew. That being said, carbonation. Just not enough in this bottle and that takes away from what would have been a great score. Even a little more suds would greatly improve it. This is still a solid brew from a solid brewery. I'm gonna go ahead and recommend it."
"The cherry flavor nearly mirrors the aroma, though the tartness seems more cherry skin derived. Notes of wood and barrel tannins are evident. There's a low sweetness and a light roast. The finish is tart cherry skins with oak. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer...and one I'm glad Jackie-O's has created...it is in the style, and tastes wonderful. The high ABV is masked by the potent flavors here, making this a dangerously drinkable beer. Would have loved to bring home a growler, but this is one they are saving for just the bar. A great beer from one of my favorite old haunts."
"Overall, a fantastic oud bruin. Typically not a style of beer that I would be crazy for, yet this fits the bill. Definitely a must have if it's on-tap."
"Overall: Great. I want more. I want them in my town. Send bottles :)"
"Drinkability: I don't have much experience with sour ales, but this is great. The tartness of the cherries goes well with the sourness and the nutty malt seems a great base for the other flavors. Tempting to get a growler of it, but I don't know if my tongue could handle that much sourness."
