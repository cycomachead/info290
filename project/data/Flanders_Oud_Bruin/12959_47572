Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, fruit, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but slightly one dimension in its sourness.","UCLABrewN84","May 28, 2014"

An excellent sour beer that is well worth seeking out should you enjoy yous beer a bit on the tart side.

4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Batch 3. Pours a murky reddish-brown color with a medium white head that diminishes very quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely red wine vinegar and nice tart aromas with some tart, red grapes. Quite funky...at least more funky than I was expecting. The Brett has done some good thing for the nose of this beer. Very sharp tart cherry/grape aromas with a good amount of wood/oak. Lovely nose. Taste is just as nice. At first it drinks like a burguny with some strong, somewhat tart, dark flavors. Then you get a good amount of sour grapes, which immediately turns to cherry sweetness. Very sour, vinegar-like beginning, with a smooth sweet cherry finish. Lovely oak flavors throughout, especially in the center of the palate. As the beer warms, the barrel really comes through with lovely oak flavors. You can definitely tell this is one of the higher ABV sour beers, but would never guess it to be as high as 10%! Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a tingly, somewhat puckering carbonation. Drinkability is scary high for a 10% beer. Overall, this is a great Oud Bruin beer. Love the complexities of if.","DovaliHops","Apr 11, 2012"

Poured a hazy red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grape, sour, tart, earthy, funky, and must. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, vinegar, funk, earth, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This one was definitely complex in both the aroma and flavor. The vinegar in this one added a very nice touch when coupled with the funky/earthy character here. A really nicely done brew that I'm glad I got the chance to try. I suggest you do the same.","thagr81us","Jul 04, 2011"

The flavor confirms the tartness, but I must say this rivals no fruit sours that I know. I must say that I rather enjoy this white grape flavor and raspberry plum tartness. There is a distinct finish here in my mind that says there is vanilla and brown sugar on the palate. Honestly I feel this is a well crafted beer. For it's style it has all the requirements.

But I can't for the life of me decide what a craft beer novice would make of it. There are other sours, particularly Oud Bruins, that rookies tend to like when I make them try one. But Rosso is odd. It's almost as if it's a different, sweeter style that somebody has painted over with a very sour brush. I guess I mean it's not as well-defined as some other sours, if that makes sense.

Grapes, red wine, barrel, fresh cut wood, and just a hint of vinegar and acid hit the olfactory. Sour is on my tongue before this beer hits my lips. Grapey sweetness bounces to tartness and transforms to woody basement oak and a kick of brett funk, followed by more sour tart cherry and sour candy. The palate is left with scrubing bubbles of sour cleanliness. Feels like waves of mouth wash in a good way, puckering! I am so happy and sad.

There's that distinctive Brettanomyces coming out now that it has warmed a little bit to challenge the tartness. Hint of leather too. Bubbly carbonation makes for a nice, fresh feel.

Copious tiny bubbles adhered to the bowl of the glass after the initial pour, but quickly dispersed - only a few strands of lacing present during the tasting. Exceptional nose with great complexity - vinous and vinegary (red wine) with a hint of cork and wood. Taste consistent with nose; however, wood expresses itself as a buttery presence. Tannins and some citric acid also revealed; tart, but not overly sour. Perhaps a hint of cherries in the mix as well, but very much subdued. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a refreshing carbonation level and a slight acidity that stimulates the palate and salivary glands, culminating in a residual warmth in the mouth. Simply delicious.

The sourness is more in the form of a mouthpuckering balasmic vinegar, not quite acidic. The vanilla and wine flavors are coming out great. Right now, this beer is a little bit too spritzy, and a little bit too overcarbonated. I'm hoping that this will curb with age. All in all, this has the potential to age into one of my favorite sours OF ALL TIME. Only time will tell.","CoolJosh","Mar 28, 2010"
3.97,-6.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Batch 2. Again. As I craft my description of this beer, I'm astounded by how much it matches what I have above. Lemony, balsamic vinegar, musty grapes plenty of tannins and leather. Moderate sourness. Leather. Yum.","DefenCorps","Mar 22, 2010"

4.2,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a reddish amber color with a small beige head that fizzles out quickly. Aroma is lactic and lemony with wine grapes and vinegar, berries. Nice subdued vinous flavor, very tart, acetic and lactic qualities, grapes and cherries, wood, acetone. Very nice and complex. Can definitely get lost in this one. Low on astringency, which is a big plus for a winey oaky beer. The body has some heft to it which is cut through nicely by the acidity. Very good sour.","illidurit","Jan 26, 2010"
4.82,13.4,4,4.5,5,5,5,"D: Wow i really wish i had more of this one. Seriously this may be the best sour beer i have ever had. It is very easy to sip on and at no point felt overwhelming. I was blown away by the rich flavors and and the dryness and wine like qualities. Well done","mikey711","Dec 30, 2009"
4.2,-1.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A waxed 375ml bottle - Batch 1. Uncapped and poured into my snifter glass. Rosso appears a somewhat murky crimson brown color with barely a finger of off white head. Nose and flavors consist of pears, grapes, oak, mild funk, cherries, currants, red wine, light sourness and vinegar, sweet dark sugar. Decent carbonation levels with very little alcohol; heat and at the very least, a medium body. Pretty well rounded after a year in the bottle. When I first sampled this last year, I thought to myself that 3 people could easily split a bottle. Now, I'd have no problems enjoying it solo.","ClockworkOrange","Dec 16, 2009"

3.87,-8.9,3.5,4,4,3,4,"D - I actually think I prefer Red Poppy to this Flanders. I did enjoy this one, and wouldn't mind trying it again in the future. I think this has several more years of aging left.","Sean9689","Oct 30, 2009"

4.17,-1.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A nice take on the Flanders Oud Bruin style by Captain Lawrence Brewing. I would have liked a little more maltiness to add to the complexity, as I feel that was the Rosso's one real weak point. I hope CL makes another batch next year, as I'd like to see if they make any tweaks.","heliosphann","Sep 19, 2009"
4.6,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: The Captain does it again! I went into this expecting nothing short of greatness and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Many thanks go out to Javier for agreeing to this trade. I've been trying to put my hands on a bottle of this ever since it was released. I had one bottle break en-route to me (F.U.U.P.S.!) and a couple trades fall through/go nowhere. I'm really loving everything the Captain lays his hot little hands on!","GbVDave","Aug 27, 2009"
4.97,16.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"D: If you haven't been able to tell yet I'm in love with this beer. Definitely one of the best sours I've had the pleasure of tasting.","drgonzo3705","Aug 25, 2009"
4.55,7.1,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"D- I took down my 12oz or so with no problem and loved every bit of it. This is a top notch version of this style. While being a wild ale the wildness is a bit tamed while the taste is wonderful. I think I just found my favorite Captain Lawrence beer to date, this was special. This has good legs for some aging, alot going on here.","BARFLYB","Jul 18, 2009"
4.6,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I think this one is highly under-rated and some of the low reviews did not rate to style. Personally I think this is the best beer for this style. Much better than red poppy.","craytonic","Jul 10, 2009"
4.17,-1.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"D: Very solid brew and definitely my favorite Oud Bruin by far. Easily drinkable and refreshing, hard to sip and savor. I do think a touch more funk with a drier feel and finish would benefit this brew.","pwoods","Jul 03, 2009"
4.47,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a very well done example of the style here. Different, a little sweeter then I would normally expect, but amazingly complex. Very happy to get to try this one.","mikesgroove","Jul 03, 2009"
4.54,6.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - I keep reaching for my glass - there's no reason why I couldn't kill a 375ml bottle of this on my own. The aftertaste is strong but not overwhelming and the carbonation and ABV are both pretty low. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle of this one - maybe batch #2.","MasterSki","Jun 26, 2009"

3,-29.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Taste & mouthfeel: Sour and tannic, a bit like grapeskin. Metallic mid-palate with some odd earthy funk. Heavyish body with low carbonation. The finish is somewhat mineral and oxidized, not entirely pleasant. Had this one side-by-side with Cuvee de Castleton, and thought that beer was far superior.","largadeer","May 16, 2009"

4.26,0.2,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a very nice beer; the grapes add a nice complexity that is boosted by the oak character and the ample, but not quite overwhelming, sourness. This is a nicely balanced beer, though the aroma really needs to warm up quite a bit before it becomes nicely complex from the underlying Brettanomyces influence.","Gueuzedude","May 08, 2009"
4.92,15.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"D: Off the charts. This is right up there with the Cuvee for me. I don't think this beer is getting the hype that is deserves. This is a world class American sour.","aerozeppl","May 02, 2009"

4.36,2.6,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a muddy brown with no head what-so-ever. With no head, you get no lacing...sad looking brew to be honest. Smell is pretty tart; ripe grapes, funky brett, and oak. Some malts and earth in the nose as well with a touch of vinegar. Taste begins with a puckering vinegar punch, fresh rhubarb, and sour apples as well. Midway the smooth malt and leather emerge with a light bretty tingle. The wine flavors really come forward in the aftertaste, and I like it a lot. A light to medium body with an almost lifeless feel in the mouth, although it seems to fit pretty well. I'm not a huge sour freak (yet), but this is just too easy to drink. Another good one from the Captain. Thanks again Todd!","BeerTruth","Apr 25, 2009"

4.89,15.1,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability- This is definitely the most interesting beer I've had in quite awhile. The oak is fairly strong in the taste but mixed with those grapes it turns into an amazingly dry brew. This beer is very vinous and 350mL isn't nearly enough and that's my only complaint. Thanks much for the opportunity Mike!","younger35","Mar 07, 2009"
4.04,-4.9,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"This is very drinkable but I can't help but think it would age beautifully. A great sour but maybe the more generic wild ale category would fit this more than a Flanders.","sonicdescent","Feb 28, 2009"
4.39,3.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Waxed cap bottle, batch #1. Pours murky, cloudy medium brown, dark plum. Head is around for just a brief moment, then its gone, leaving behind just very few tiny bubbles and no lace. On the low carbonation side. Fruity (sour plums), sour, Brett infused nose. Initially fruit on the tongue, then quickly the sour comes in to play. Funk, grapes, wood, horsey, grapefruit juice, sharply sour, intensely complex. World class sour. Wish I had a few bottles to age for a few years. Yet another home run for the good captain. Well worth seeking out via trade, if you can find any...looks like I will have to wait for the next batch..","Billolick","Beers"
4.52,6.4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"375 ml bottle thanks to Mike once again, thank you for sending me the second sour from Captain Lawrence, consumed on 2/22/09, reviewed from notes, poured into my Chimay goblet, color is medium brown with tons of red in it, 3/4 inch white bubbly head, goes down rather fast, some minor lacing, aroma is of cherries, grapes, red wine, brettanomyces, tart, other wild yeast, and mild vinegar, great smell, flavor has so much wood in it that the dryness almost takes over while served chilled, lots of red grapes in the middle, mild malt that is a little sugary and malty at the same time, finish is dry with even more oak, sourness from the brett, love how the tart settles as it warms, sour, fruity, and mildly sweet mouthfeel, medium body, crisp and strong carbonation, could drink multiple bottles of this stuff but its dryness can really affect the drinkability after some time, goes down easily mostly though, can even be refreshing, this was by far the oakiest beer I ever had, this baby spent a long time in the barrel, great brew that I wish was more accesible for us here in California, will be drinking more in the future, highly recommended","Floydster","0"
