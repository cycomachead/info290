3.9,3.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, 41347 bottle code. Pours fairly crystal clear dark ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, black cherry, cherry skin, brown sugar, oak, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with big authentic cherry presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart cherry, black cherry, cherry skin, oak, clove, pepper, brown sugar, toast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart/black cherry, cherry skin, oak, pepper, clove, brown sugar, toast, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of cherry flavors with moderate malt/oak/yeast flavor balance; with a good tartness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian fruit beer. Plenty of great authentic cherry flavor with moderate malt/oak/yeast balance; and extremely smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 29, 2013"

The color was a hazy amber brown with ruby red shining through in the light. The nose did not have much to it: a faint vinous quality and the smell of cherry Kool-Aid, but I could smell the alcohol, so it was all too reminiscent of a Four Loko. It tasted like a red wine with Kool-Aid overtones along with a faint wood characteristic. The finish brought a moderate sour yeast taste. Mouthfeel was watery with medium carbonation. I didn't enjoy this one very much and I definitely won't seek it out again.","itsscience","Nov 09, 2013"

I would certainly recommend it for someone who was trying to transition from mixed drinks to beer, but I think there are much better takes on the Flanders Oud Bruin style.

You probably expect a highly oaky, dry, and tart beer with sour cherries and tons of vinous grape. Not exactly the case here. This is more of a sweet, cherry fruit beer. In that regard, it can be enjoyed more thoroughly. Looking at it that way, I much prefer this to, say, Founder's Cerise. As far as Oud Bruins go, though, it's not as hot. Still a decent thing to try for the cherry lovers out there.","tectactoe","Aug 04, 2013"

The flavor has a puckering sourness up front, accompanied by a strong cherry flavor reminiscent of cough syrup. There is also a slight oaken flavor that appears to struggle some against the cherry backbone. I'm a fan of Petrus, and of sour ales in general, but not so much of cherry. In this case, the cherry flavor is so predominant that it overrides my affinity for the style.

One of the best fruit based beers I had in a while. If it wasn't for the 10 dollar price tag I would have a bottle in my fridge every week.","DrDemento456","Apr 11, 2013"
