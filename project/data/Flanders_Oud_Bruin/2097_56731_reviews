"Super juicy. A little sweet but not cloying. Not sure why this needed to be 13%, though"

"This almost drinks mire like a high octane fruit beer than a Flanders red but I really liked it."

"This is an easy drinking beer with tons of complexity. A few others and I guessed the ABV of this beer at a tasting at around 7-8%. Quite surprised to find out the ABV."

"Sticky and heavy on palate; the body on this brew is as large as the alcohol content suggests, although it drinks insanely easy considering it's nearly 12% ABV. I love the authentic nature of the black cherries, I love the intense and unexpected sourness, and I love the overall execution of this unique and interesting brew. Like an intentionally soured and fruited up, cherry barley wine on crack. So, so dope."

"Deep brown, with burgundy highlights. No head, no lace. Nose of black cherries, currants, subtler chocolate covered berries and a light almost cranberry light tart note. Taste has more black cherry, light medicinal notes, chocolate covered cranberries, light tartness but a sweet Flanders Red-esque like malting. Sweet and sour, with a fuller thicker feel that appears less than 12.0%. A very drinkable Flanders Red/Oud Bruin."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some nice cherry and malt aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite tasty and easy to drink with the nice cherry aromas and flavors."

"Fuller medium body, lighter carbonation, sticky and full on the tongue. This is a little strong, but I really enjoyed the powerful sour cherry flavor."
"Overall: What this beer lacks in body, it certainly makes up for it in the smell and taste. As mentioned above, it's definitely a sipper with an ABV of 12%, and the flavors are so bold anyway, you don't need anymore than the single bottle, and that is something that could be shared with a pal, but I'm kind of greedy like that so I'll be killing it myself."
""
""
"O: Took me by surprise. Love it, absolutely glad I tried it, just really confused by it. New experience where I wasn't expecting it. 4.5"
"D - I like it but one is more than enough!"
"D and O: Drinks like a Flanders Brown, with a bit more of an alcohol bite, and body. A pretty big beer, but a nice one to have tried."
""
""
""
"Overall, cherry is a bitch in a beer. I am fussy when it comes to the flavor and this beer, like Mr. Cash himself, walks the line. Not the best and not the worst."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good but the cherry flavor is straddles the medicinal line. Way out of style, obviously, and very sweet, but worth a try."
""
"o - Overall a very nice flanders. Not super sour but very tasty, and definitely did not feel like 12% ABV. Would like to have it again."
""
"O: Not overly complex, but it does cherry very well with a nice balance between sweet & sour. Very drinkable, would never guess that is has 12% ABV. Also had this fresh on tap and thought it was a bit sweeter."
""
""
"Overall, this was a very nice offering from Kunhenns. The drinkability is insane for the alcohol. I feel like I'm drinking a 6% beer. I'd love to have a couple of these, but it's a little pricey. For what it is, it's a pretty good value though."
""
""
"O: Too bad there weren’t some more bubbles in this one. Flavors were rich but nothing too special. The cherry flavors were authentic tasting though, and not syrupy. I was expecting more oak, more tartness, more bubbles. Not a bad beer, and it was fun to sip on, but I don’t need to have this again."
""
"O: Very good beer. The bottled versio is much more sour than the tap version. The tap version tastes a lot more like cherry cough syrup."
"On tap at the brewpub, second night of the Winter Solstice. A nice drinkable beer, in the style but a little on the sweeter side than the best examples of the style. Reddish, lacy. Good cherry, very malted ameliorating the potential sourness I would expect and like. Worth a try."
""
""
"O - Knocking the sweetness down would elevate this for me, but still quite enjoyable."

"o - overall, a rather interesting beer. the booze is strong in this one, but the flavoring is nice."
"O: It's pretty good, but not great."
"Overall: This definitely falls on the sweet side of the spectrum when it comes to Oud Bruins, and it is higher than the normal alcohol range as well. The complexity was there, but I think I would have preferred it to have been toned down just a bit in the alcohol and sweetness department to let some of the other flavors shine through a little bit."
"O: Not sure how I feel about this beer. Very sweet with little malt backbone. I was not sure how to review this."
"O- Again, a little of this goes a very long way. One glass was sufficient for my party of 5 to all try some and be good. I liked it, but would have liked a bit more sour and a bit less syrup. Seriously though, huuuge Kudos on masking the alcohol- this drank like 5%... Crazy"
"O: huge flavors, a little on the sweet side for the style, some sourness but not enough, intense"
"O - Overall very impressed. Another successful venture into sours for Kuhnhenn!"
"O: Overall really not enjoying this one too much. Its tough to put back. But glad I got to try it non the less. The Marrón Acidifié I also got in this trade was a hell of lot better than this one. 3.0"
"A huge thanks to Schmittymack for generously sharing this one with us last Friday night. Poured a hazy brown color with a bit of tan foam on top. Aromas of sour cherries, tobacco and caramel. On the palate, this one was light bodied and tart, with huge cherry flavors along with light vinegar and caramel."
"Overall this is a big-time sipper because of the high alcohol and heavy sourness. But the flavor doesn't do enough for me to handle sipping on this for the hour plus that it necessitates. Sadly I don't think I will be finishing the bottle."
"(D)- A great Oud Bruin to say the least. Oaky, fruity, and sour with a great balance and drinkability. A great example for the style even though it carries a hefty ABV level for the style."
"O - This beer is what I imagine Quelque Chose would be like if it had carbonation."
"Overall- This beer was my hope for a good east coast/Midwest sour ale. I'm hoping there are better sours out in that direction. I feel spoiled with RR, LA and Cascade sours at my constant disposal but they are excellent for comparison. This one should be classified as a fruit beer because it is plainly sweet without a sour or tart quality. Glad to try it but disappointed."
"Pours a nice rusty mahogany with a silky tan head. Nose has tart cherries, ripe pitted fruits, sweet malts and acidic grapes. Taste is also full of fresh, vibrant cherries. Dry, acidic finish. Crisp, refreshing body. Another great beer from Kuhnhenn and my first sour from them!"
"Overall-- this is one I could skip the next time around... It isn't TERRIBLE, but is doesn't wow me in any aspect. I am sorely disappointed in this beet."
"D- This was an amazing beer that didnt look or smell like it tasted."
"D: This is about the most drinkable 11.5 abv beer I've ever tasted. I would keep a case of this in the cellar if I could."
"Slick on the palate, but light enough in texture from the low residual sugars, this is pretty much spot on in my eyes. While it could use more carbonation, the lack thereof does not really detract from the feel, though I do wonder if there wouldn't be a bit more complexity with some carbonation to open it up a little. Extremely enjoyable and easy drinking, this could be dangerous, as it doesn't show a hint of the booze."
"Drinkability - Insanely drinkable. I get just an ever so slight warming of the throat from this beer, and this is the 2010 version. I can't even imagine how drinkable this will be in a year or two. I am most definitely going to ISO this beer asap."
"D - 11.5%? Are you kidding me? This is by far the most dangerous beer I've ever had. It drinks like it's 4%, no problem. You could get someone absolutely wrecked off this beer. It's not too sour at all. This one has a scary drinkability level."
"Thanks to beefwolf77 for sharing"
"Mouthfeel is syrupy because of the low carbonation, but it never becomes sticky or reminiscent of cough syrup. That's saying a lot since this is such a cherry-driven beer. The drinkability is nice, especially since this is such a big beer. Very well done! I'm looking out for more next spring in MI!"
"D - I'm glad this is in a 12oz serving because I don't think I could drink much more. It's certainly a solid beer and provides some nice cherry notes but it's pretty thick and the finish leaves a flavor that I still can't decide if I like or not. I might pick more of this up if I had the chance so I could see how it ages."
"Drinkability is average. There is sour cherry in this beer, so Kuhnhenn does deliver that, but in a very one dimensional way. The high ABV is somewhat noticeable and the thickness for this style also cuts down on drinkability. Not necessarily a bad beer, but with beers like Rosso E Marrone in this category, this one doesn't come close."
"Overall I'm not disappointed. Glad I got to try this one."
"This was not a pleasantness."
"Dark brown with a dense tan head, retention is great. Nose has vanilla, brown sugar and plenty of it, like an oud bruin on steroids. I also get some burnt sugar, toffee, grapes and port. Palate opens sweet and wine-like, almost dessert wine like with brown sugar, vanilla, light acetic tartness but mostly, overwhelming sweetness. Long fruity finish with berries , this is full in body with light carbonation, almost exquisite in this aspect. Solid stuff."
"I think the sweetness is a little much here to allow you to enjoy an entire bottle."
"Overall, a very interesting and complex take on the style. As I said though, I found this to be rather sweet and lacking the tartness that I generally find in this style."
"As usual, Kuhnhenn really makes some great beer when there isn't a quality control issue. This is a hefty, sweet oud bruin with just enough tartness to keep things interesting."
"(Although it'd not applicable here, I've reviewed several beers which I'd categorize differently than the person who first reviewed it. I bet you have, too.)"
"D_Hard enough to choke down one. Perhaps better suited for a smaller serving."
"D- Low... there's a few flavors that draw me out of what has the potential to be a stellar beer. Needs some serious tweaking. Each sip I would tell myself it's not that bad, and then the stale flavors would hit me for a second, and then they'd be gone. A befuddling beer."
"Overall, found this to be a very unique brew, but also tasty which = high rating"
"Thick syrupy mouthfeel and no carbonation take away from my overrall rating, but still enjoyable IMHO."
"D - Very high drinkability considering the abv. It gets tastier as you go too, a very nice and tasty brew."
"This was almost still. The smell was like black cherry jam and booze. The flavor was a little more complex. It had sour cheeries that ended with a boozy cherry pit flavor. Alcohol is strong and this beer is syrupy and coats your tongue. I almost didn't want this to be sour but once my palate adjusted it felt better."
"D: A decent beer that gets much much better as the carbonation leaves and it warms a little. The fruitiness seeps through a bit more and this one actually becomes quite drinkable. Still, lacking the vinegary kick and real sourness that I've come to enjoy from the style."
"Cask as the Great Taste. Pours a rosy red slightly cloudy color with a slight tan head. Tart, sweet cherries just absolutely dominates the nose with some sour notes as well. Tart bite on the tongue followed by a full fruity taste of cherries with both sweet and tart tastes. Very well balanced. Light mouthfeel."
"This sour monster is firing on all cylinders and I would happily drink myself into a massive hangover with it."
"J"
"Pour looks so nice in a sherry dark red with of mild murk. Nose is intensely of cherry pie and the palate is back with so much nice malt that it just sits on your tongue. Although i must say it is a bit elixer like when it comes to the feel. For some the abv and the intense cherry richness may come off as tussin like. But its more meaty than that. Its has a nice english barley wine finish and hints of coconut sweet and thyme bitter. A nice one. Seek it out strong sour fans."
"Overall great beer glad i bought a couple of them i cant wait to see how it changes over the years."
"The body is thicker than normal maybe, not too thick but you can tell that lots of fermentables went into this (thus the 12% ABV). Too drinkable for the ABV, dangerous stuff."
"The appearance is a reddish brown color with a thin head that has a pink hue to it. Taking a whiff of it, presents scents of vinegar, cherry, alcohol, as well as some vanilla. It tastes very rich and sweet, along with the presence of malt and those tart cherries, not too sour. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation. Drinkability is very good for this midwestern oud bruin. I am glad that I had the opportunity to drink this & look forward to trying other beers from Kuhnhenn in the future."
"Awesome version of an Ode' Bruin. The cherry flavor really comes out but is not too powerful. I just wish it wasn't such a high gravity beer so I could drink more of it :)Get thaer and get yourself some while its still available. Has been going fast!"
"Hey Kuhnhenn, why aren't you in Philly yet, what's the holdup. Your in NYC and the surrounding areas up there, what's the holdup? What are you brewers, chicken? ya scared, get your beers down here and all is forgiven. Same goes for goose island, get your acts together guys. Come on, I know you want to."
"D- not a bit of heat from this beast of a sour. Sour but not to much sweet but not to much. Complex and enjoyable. I wish I had scooped another one of these."
"A very interesting and very tart change-of-pace beer."
"Pretty damn awful, one of my very few drain pours. A big disappointment."
"Overall, an amazing beer. So many fresh cherries. Very drinkable for the high abv. Really glad to have tried this on tap."
"Yet another great tasting beer from the guys up at Kuhnhenn. Keep 'em coming, please!!"
"It was nice to try this one, but it could have been better with more tart flavors and less sweet cherry."
"This beer appears a light brown hue with a tiny head that leaves no lacing. Aromas of cherries and alcohol are the dominating scents. The beer tastes very good, with a decent balance of tartness to sweetness. The cherry flavors, which are very forward, and the high abv make this beer too sweet for me to indulge in more than one serving. Perhaps a couple of years in the cellar would enhance the drinkability factor. Overall, this was a good beer, and one I would have again."
"D- This brew doesn't seem to meld right on the palate. Its not bad...somewhat drinkable-but it just doesnt blend right."
"D-pretty tasty and improves as it warms. notes of metallic phenol in the back when it was first served but faded. balanced, not bad."
"Beer is big and sweet with a quick acetic sourness that follows quickly. Cherry, very cherry, almost candy like flavors in the back, some tartness at the corners of the mouth. Beer is thin and there is low carbonation on the palate. Slight sour finish with a slightly dry back palate. Pretty good."
"Ruddy brown pour with a fine off-white head. Some lace spots and streaks as it dies to a film. Intense cherry and vinegar aromas alongside a good amount of candy sugar. Very sweet and intense, almost thick smell. Mindblowingly intense cherry, alternating between sweet and sour on the palate, with the sweetness eventually getting the upper hand and winning out. There's also an interesting fruit vinegar quality to this beer, along with a slight funk and touch of caramel. Slightly boozy. It's a thick, sticky beast, but one more than deserving of some of your time. Extreme for the style, but recommended."
"Drinkability: Decent but I'm not digging the mouthfeel."
"D: Not really sure what is going on here. This was not all that good and I'm sorry to say I would not want to try this one again."
"Drinkability- Kind of a strange brew overall but still enjoyed the shit out of it. The cherries are front and center just how I like em. Not sure if this will sour up a bit more with some age on it but I'm glad I enjoyed fresh. Thanks much Jeff!"
"I have to say, this is really good...but not at all what I expected for the style! Its not really a tart vinegar like beer...rather its a sweet/tart cherry flavor, slightly malty, booze is pretty well hidden, carbonation mild to low. Mouthfeel is medium body, and overall very drinkable. Another great beer from Kuhnhenn!"
"D: The alcohol is very well masked. I would have never thought it was 11.5% unless I looked on the bottle. However, the strong tart taste of cherry flavors makes this one a sipper."
"Drinkablility is good for such a big beer, it's hard to believe this beer is 11.5% alcohol."
"D: Drinks good but would only drink one due to the sweetness of the beer. I would definitely drink this again."
"I poured into my glass to absolutely no head. It is brown in color. The aroma reminds me of wine. It has a tart cherry smell and taste. I get a hint of vinegar in there, too. I get some cranberry on the taste. This is a new experience for me, and I like it."
"Overall, I thought this was pretty good, although others who shared it were not as keen on it. The fruit flavor was nice, but it wasn't sour like it claimed to be and was slightly medicinal. This detracted from the drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable. Not sure on the style classification, but another really impressive beer coming from Kuhnhenn."
"Poured right down into the center of the glass from six inches above and still no head, no lacing either. Deep muddy brown colored liquid, like you'd expect to find catfish swimming around the bottom of the glass, sort of yellows around the rims, curiously lots of visible bubbles inside yet no head. Sour pie of wild cherries, not the type of sweeter cherries you get in the store, you even get the flakes of hard crust, baking spices and a light blood orange infusion, before it's gone you get a damp kind of forest floor vegetation, that said, it's all about the cherries. Very full-bodied, dense and muscular mouth presence, the carbonation adds a tight tickle to stir the pot ever so slowly. Comes close to identically replicating the nose, those sour cherries have a golden honey dappled flakiness, haphazard flourishes of vanilla bean, ginger and chamomile. Here you get more white grapefruit than orange, takes the pucker factor to ""eleven."" Not as earthy or green as in the nose. Most effective when warmed up some, gains staying power in both the nose and palate. Admirable clarity of purpose here."
"Soft and fine carbonation is very nice despite the complete lack of a head. Not exactly a clone of my favorite Belgian versions of the style but a very tasty and enjoyable brew. This only my second beer from this brewer and the first I've reviewed but so far I have to say I'm very impressed."
"Enjoyed this one alone, but probably should have split it. I can easily drink all 12oz, but it really does get a bit sweet by the last few ounces. I'm sure it will age well and it goes down as another great beer by Kuhnhenn's for me."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/5 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight herb, (jello-like aroma), and cherries. Fits the style of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tartness and slight dryness. Tastes of tart malt, cherries, sweet malt, slight alcohol, and slight herb. Overall, a good blend, body, and aroma."
"Overall, decent, tasty but sweet and overpowering, not a bruin but worth a shot to split a bottle with someone."
"Sweetish cherry and balsamic vinegar up front. Woody edge. Some tart cherry and raspberry in the background, providing nice contrast to the sweeter flavors (sugary cherries and strawberries). Slightly medicinal and warming. Nice bite of tartness near the finish. Finish dries out a bit (woody), with the lingering tartness. Some fruitiness sweetness also sticks around. Warming and strong, but drinks more like 8-9%. Full-bodied, with a slightly syrupy feel. Not bad! Definitely a sipper."
"D - Really complex and tasty. Definitely a sipper and totally worth the money. Definitely try to get a hold of this."
"D - If anything, the sweetness might get a bit tiring. If you have a sweet tooth this would get you drunk pretty fast, as the alcohol is very hard to detect. Not really what I expect from an Oud Bruin, but a very good fruit beer instead. Maybe one of these days the Kuhnhenn brothers will take the plunge and make something more to style - it needs some lactic sourness and a bit more vinegar here guys."
"D: Good, tasty beer."
