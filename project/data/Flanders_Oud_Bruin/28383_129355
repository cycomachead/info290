4.5,6.6,,,,,,"Wasn't expecting a lot from this, Im not a fan of mushrooms but tried it anyways.  WOW this thing is spot on. Smells like woods and slight amount of acidity.You get a lot of Earth and dirt coming through probably from the mushrooms. It's really well rounded and has great mouthfeel, pretty high carbed. No acetobactor coming through and no harshness at all just a straight tart pleasant sourness. Tired Hands nails it again with this one","Evahflow","Jul 19, 2014"

It was somewhat of a struggle to finish this off. I didnt really taste any Shitake in this beer at all either.","Desp59","0"
