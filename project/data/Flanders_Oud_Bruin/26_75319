3.77,9.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Rich reddish brown body with minimal white head. 2nd bottling from Spring 2013. Definitely some acidity on the nose. Not much else on the nose. Nice malty body that helps round out the tartness. The beer is pretty one note in terms of acidity, but the Flanders body is there. Not a bad Flanders, but not very complex.","PHBoiler","0"
