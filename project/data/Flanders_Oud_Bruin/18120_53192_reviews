"surprised this is rated as low as it is, thought there was a lot of hype about it? anyways, the beer is darn good, yet not adding much to the genre, despite the addition of toasted almonds to the brew, which i wanted to taste a lot more than i do. while there is a distinct nuttiness amongst all the lactic sour intensity and acidic chocolate malt, that earthy vanilla milky complex never arrives. not much head or real carbonation to this, it could use about 25% more of these than it has, but other than that, the beer is great. nice acidity, some simplicity too for trinity, who is known for bizarre recipes, clay aging and the like. this is a bit more straight forward, very much in the oud bruin style, with all the sourness coming on the tail end. mild malt body, almonds flash in for just a second mid palate when i search for them, but a higher dose of that would set this beer apart."

"Jesus Christ! I don't know if a fresher version would have been better (the label states it can be cellared indefinitely), but unless extremely intense vinegar and sourness is your thing, this beer has very little going for it. It certainly hasn't aged well. This is a tongue ripper with an abysmal feel to it. The aroma is the best thing and almost seems promising for a wild ale, but the taste just slams you with a mouth cringing twang."

"Is this beer over done, yes. Is it amazingly delicious, yes. I highly recommend this beer for any true sour lover. Trinity nailed this blend, even-though I prefer batch #1 more."

"Overall this is a good to decent beer, definitely lacks in elegance but it does the job if you like sour beers!"
"Overall: Let down, big time. I've had typically pretty good luck with cellared beers, but I'm beginning to think my luck may have changed a wee bit. I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this and I'm disappointed because I was looking forward to a challenging beer. At least the bottle has a cool label."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some fruity and slight vinegar aromas. Taste is very much the same with a super acidic and puckering finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good sour with some great aromas and flavors."
"Bottle Numer 1209-11 Barrel Number SB2, SB4, NBB3 poured to NBB globe. The beer pours a thick rich brown with amber mahogany edges in the light. Flat though, not much of a head to report nor lacing or retention. The only thing about this beer that isn't welcoming or impressive. The nose is a pleasant blend of tart fruit character, sweet malt, oak, vanilla, and dark fruit - the former being most prevalent. The flavor follows suit with a pronounced tart sour character that dominates the flavor throughout: first flavor you encounter and lasts until it's the last thing you taste. The oak and vanilla and malty sweetness are much less prevalent than in the nose but the fruity character is a bit more bold. Finishes crisp and actually quite smooth. Medium bodied but nut much carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this beer! I am told each bottle tastes a little different so I will be heading back to pick more up. It's a bit pricey at around $25/bottle but I would cellar a few and save for a nice occasion. It's interesting to see people's reaction to the beer. I didn't pick up any of the unpleasant characteristics others commented on. Perhaps its this bottle or batch. I would recommend for sure."

"Overall quite sour - if you want a kick in the nuts then this beer will deliver. Unfortunately I want kids some day. Those poor Lorax..."
"Gotta love that Dr. Seussian artwork. Poured a murky, ruddy brown with a thin whitish head that receded to almost nothing. Aroma of tart cherries, acetic acid, and booze-soaked wood. Taste of tart and sour cherries, but not too lip-puckering (after reading other reviews, I have to wonder how long this bottle sat in the cellar, and if it indeed mellowed out a bit with time), more acetic acid / vinegar, chewy bread, and hints of citrus, oak, and wet grass. Medium-bodied, quite acidic, but still pretty tame compared to other members of the style, not to mention pretty low in alcohol. I liked this one. It's no RR Supplication, but it's still pretty good."
""
"Pours a cherrywood brown with no visible head, slight carbonation. Aroma of lacto, cherries, sour grapes and slight vinegar. Taste follows nose sweet and tart. Cherries up front with vinegar in the back. The sour sticks around and puckers well after the last sip. I love this beer, my only knock is I would like a little more carbonation."

"I like this beer even if it’s a bit too still. The flavor is something I never tire of and I really do hope I can get more of it in the future."

"Overall: A few ounces was too much, taste with a thimble."

"Beer has a subtle light sweetness on the front end, thins out immediately into a mixture of solvent flavors, strong acetic, tartness at the back corners, definitely vinegar and acetone in this one, it is hard to drink and burns so good. It wasn't bad, it was like a Consecration on crack in the middle of holding up a small grocery store because the trashy girlfriend he started hanging out with once he started on his bender thought it was a good idea, and Consecration on crack will do anything for that bitch. I might have it again."
"o - Poured myself about 5 ounces of this and it was about 3 ounces too much. This one is crazy tart and is like drinking vinegar; not something I'd seek out again."
"I have to admit that the bottom half of the bottle got tough to drink. The sourness is manageable at first, but seems to accumulate rather than dissipate. Even sipping slowly, this gets overwhelming. It needs a companion, like a good creamy cheese. My palate never seemed to adjust. The price tag is pretty crazy, as well. Not something I'd normally be able to afford. I remember when a $12 bottle was outrageous."
"O: Definitely one of the most sour beers, if not the most sour beer I've ever had. Pretty one dimensional, but I really am enjoying getting my sour fix. Interesting beer, and one that will be interesting to see how it ages."
"Bottle. Number 479-10, barrel number SB4. Bottle opens with absolutely zero pop and pours with no carbonation at all. Dark, clear rust color with no head. The aroma is strong acetone and nail polish with some dark cherry notes as well. Sweet start with a strong transition to acid like tart/sourness. Sourness sticks around and somewhat agitates the throat. Some cherry in there as well. Overall, one of the most sour tongue ripping beers I have had in a long time. I mean, this things will make you cough if you inhale through the nose to deeply when taking a sniff! Watch out!"
"Overall: This is the most sour beer I have ever had, bar none. It burns the taste buds off your tongue, feels like acid going down your throat, and dumps acid into your stomach. For some reason, I love it. I drank the dregs of the bottle, and they were delicious. At the same time, I understand why this is such a polarizing beer and most people do not like it."
" I could barely finish 2 oz of this beast. I was warned about this one, but unfortunately that’s also part of the reason I wanted it!"
"Really disappointed with this beer considering Trinity's consistently outstanding other offerings. I understand the experimental adventure typical of ""Wild Ales," but I have to say...brewing novelty beer that tastes this bad isn't really an achievement when thousands of years of experimentation have brought us to Brewer's Yeast as a means to an end. If ""wild"" yeast was the best form for brewing, we'd still be using it to brew Budweiser."
"O - If it's novelty sour you're going for, this one actually is a winner. Not a huge fan, as the taste just isn't all that good. was fun to try, but wouldn't be interested in getting this one again."
"As an aside, this beer made me think of the songs ""Unmercifully Beaten"" and ""Masochistic Rampage"" by the band Unmerciful."
"The warnings about the insane sourness of this beer are legit, but not in the enamel-melting lactic pucker that other sours are known for (e.g., Beatification Batch II, Veritas 004, La Folie). Instead, Old Growth resorts to a sour chemical burn as it hits the back of the throat. A leeching, green sourness plays off notes of leather and tart fruit juice up front, but the finish is all vinegar. Makes the cheeks sweat and the stomach churn a bit. Old Growth is fun to try, but I can't say that I personally would recommend it."
"Drink is very tough, its just so sour, tart, and acidic, a bit sweet but nicely dry, and a bit flemmy."
"Overall this beer was just as billed, it's one of the most tart beers I've ever had. If you have a bottle find some friends with whom to share it otherwise you'll be in for a long night."
"Wish I was closer to these guys so I could get more goodness like this."
"To be honest this is a really well made beer. Had it been blended with something young and fruity it probably would have been stellar."
"Pours a hazy, deep golden color with a minimal white head. The aroma is incredibly sour and acidic with hints of acetone. You can tell this one is going to assault your palate before even tasting it. The taste is very sour with lots of lemon juice and citric acid up front, pretty nice, really, but the finish takes a turn for the nearly unbearable with the sourness turning almost corrosive. This burns your esophagus all the way down almost like your swallowing nail polish remover. Extremely dry and acidic on the palate with a slightly thin mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty low due to the throat-burning, stomach-churning sourness. I've been wanting to try this for awhile, and I'm glad I was able to, but 2 oz of this stuff is more than enough and a bit of a chore to get down. Unique and interesting if nothing else."
"Aftertaste is lingering with bitterness for minutes after drinking - Wow."
"Yipes."
"Pours a medium amber color without much of any head action going on. Thin collar after the pour, but that's about it. The nose is almost nothing but sourness. A bit of chemical acid and some very, very sour SweeTarts candy, if I give anything to them. The taste isn't particularly good either and there is a ridiculous sour presence there. Paint thinner and all. Something about the level of sourness is enjoyable, but it's not how it tastes. Does not drink very well at all. Good to try and unlike the Santa Fe Wild, I actually finished a small pour of this."
"I liked it a lot, probably more than most that tried it at this tasting, and I would gladly get it again. That said, I know this will not be for everyone, this is as polarizing as a beer can be."
"I've had other bottles of this that were better - must be some pretty extreme bottle variation going on."
"Bottle thanks to Eric, drank from my Narke glass...Dark brown, hint of purple, not much carbonation at all...The aroma is super sour, in the realm of the Santa Fe Wilds but not quite there. The problem with is that the aroma is just bad, nostril burning rubber and gasoline...The taste is really good, super tart vinegar and cherries but with a nail polishing remover texture that is not good, really burns on the way down and for several seconds later. I actually like the taste but the aroma is terrible and this is not drinkable."
"Conclusion: I think this beer is extreme, and will continue to draw extreme opinions from the people who drink it. Some will accuse it as the worst attempt at a sour of all time. Some will bow down to its outrageous flavors and interesting characteristics. I fall in the middle. I enjoyed it much, but didn't like the flavors at all. I appreciate the thought that the brewers put into it, and their interesting experimentation. I got to meet one of the assistant brewers, and he said that one of the yeast strains in the beer was harvested from a raspberry in a canyon where Colorado Springs locals spend time hiking and bouldering. What a cool idea..."
"Overall, it is a decent beer, but I just can't drink a lot of it because of the vinegar. It is nothing like I remember it tasting. I used to love this beer, now I can hardly drink it."
"Crazy sour ale. Just insane. You probably can't handle this one, so leave it to world-renowned tickers like myself."
"D: Bam! It's dry but very drinkable with a wickedly low alcohol volume. I'm glad to have tried it."
"Consumed: 8/7/2010"
"D-this is almost too tart and acidic for me, the flavors are pretty big and there is an attempt to balance with some ripe fruit sweetness; but the centerpiece of this beer is acidity."
"This beer is a light brown color and appears pretty clear. There is virtually no head or lace. I think the sour monster scared them away, or worse. This beer is fantastically sour. Wow. It is reminiscent of a Flanders Oud Bruin, but vastly more tart. There are some nice woody notes in there, as well. Lip smacking, puckering, cringing sour goodness. Obviously, the finish is pretty acetic with some vinegar notes. What a cool experience. One of the sourest beers I have ever had. I don't think the review scores do this beer justice. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sour and wild ales."
"750ml bottle that was completely flat. Like, Lost Abbey flat...Dark brown color with a smell that let me know this was going to be sour, it smelled quite awesome. The flavor was intensely sour, possibly the sourest beer I have ever had, just vicious. It had a nice brettiness and apples and a bit of vinegar but really just an onslaught of sour. If this was carbonated it would probably be a better beer because it certainly isn't worth the $24."
"Too bad, this could have been a great sour. I guess that's the risk you take with such a"
"Overall, a very unique beer that it not for everybody. This profile of this beer is definitely turning more towards a vinegar type flavor. Luckily, I love me some vinegar!"
"D: I was initially not quite sure what to think of this beer. This is a sour beer that will test your endurance and the toughness of your organs, but I really enjoyed it."
"The body is moderately thick and there is very little carbonation, which hurts the appearance but lets the acidic notes sting the throat in its place. Nice to have a small glass of this and see what complexities I can pick up in something so intense. Sour as all hell, and acidic, do not open this without a small group to try it. It is too hard to drink more than a little bit though. Good in small doses."
"D: Not drinkable, but ohh soo awesome."
"J"
"Overall: Not the very best sour I've ever had, but... the most funky wild sour I've ever had. So much going on, but it works."
"Poured a hazy brownish color with good carbonation. Nose is vinegar, fruits, tart. Taste is vinegar, blacberry, a nce funky, sourness with booze. mouthfeel is big vinegar, sharp booze gets your attention. A differnt sour and me likey!"
"Very dry mouthfeel. The vinegar and sour notes make this one a slow sipper. Excellent beer."
"Sharp sourness in the nose, pleasant barnyard, rather acetic and balsamic. Similar in flavor, more sharp puckering sourness, it really delivers in the sour aspect. There is a passing resemblance to other Flemish ales (especially La Folie). Alternately dry and somewhat grainy, there is a basic malt flavor that lingers after the vinegar sourness has passed. Deceptively simple. A very clean sour that kept me coming back for more."
"Aged in New Belgian Brewing barrels that held La Folie, this is one funky, sour brew reminiscent of Rodenbach and probably includes a strain of such yeast. Dark amber in color, with no head, the aroma is of strong sour fruits, barnyard and balsamic vinegar. Flavors are similar and can be best appreciated by sour lovers. There's some sweetness, sour apple and persimmon notes, and an overall mouth puckering effect. I've had this at the GABF and at Trinity brewery with brewer Jason. Bottles are numbered. This beer was aged in oak barrels 12 - 18 months. Jason calls it a highly acidic Flemish inspired brown, bottle conditioned with champagne yeast."
"Pours a mahogany with a thin beige head. Nose has sour cherries, plums, oak, tart yeast and a subtle funky presence. Taste is very sour and acidic. Hard to drink. Also has some oak and fruity undertones. Medium body is lightly carbonated with a very acidic finish. Could use a bit of time to mellow out."
