I don't know if a fresher version would have been better (the label states it can be cellared indefinitely), but unless extremely intense vinegar and sourness is your thing, this beer has very little going for it.

4.26,17.4,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Bottle Numer 1209-11 Barrel Number SB2, SB4, NBB3 poured to NBB globe. The beer pours a thick rich brown with amber mahogany edges in the light. Flat though, not much of a head to report nor lacing or retention. The only thing about this beer that isn't welcoming or impressive. The nose is a pleasant blend of tart fruit character, sweet malt, oak, vanilla, and dark fruit - the former being most prevalent. The flavor follows suit with a pronounced tart sour character that dominates the flavor throughout: first flavor you encounter and lasts until it's the last thing you taste. The oak and vanilla and malty sweetness are much less prevalent than in the nose but the fruity character is a bit more bold. Finishes crisp and actually quite smooth. Medium bodied but nut much carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this beer! I am told each bottle tastes a little different so I will be heading back to pick more up. It's a bit pricey at around $25/bottle but I would cellar a few and save for a nice occasion. It's interesting to see people's reaction to the beer. I didn't pick up any of the unpleasant characteristics others commented on. Perhaps its this bottle or batch. I would recommend for sure.","hopfacebrew","Jan 31, 2012"

Aroma of tart cherries, acetic acid, and booze-soaked wood. Taste of tart and sour cherries, but not too lip-puckering (after reading other reviews, I have to wonder how long this bottle sat in the cellar, and if it indeed mellowed out a bit with time), more acetic acid / vinegar, chewy bread, and hints of citrus, oak, and wet grass. Medium-bodied, quite acidic, but still pretty tame compared to other members of the style, not to mention pretty low in alcohol. I liked this one.

Instead, Old Growth resorts to a sour chemical burn as it hits the back of the throat. A leeching, green sourness plays off notes of leather and tart fruit juice up front, but the finish is all vinegar. Makes the cheeks sweat and the stomach churn a bit.

You can tell this one is going to assault your palate before even tasting it. The taste is very sour with lots of lemon juice and citric acid up front, pretty nice, really, but the finish takes a turn for the nearly unbearable with the sourness turning almost corrosive. This burns your esophagus all the way down almost like your swallowing nail polish remover. Extremely dry and acidic on the palate with a slightly thin mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty low due to the throat-burning, stomach-churning sourness.

There is a passing resemblance to other Flemish ales (especially La Folie). Alternately dry and somewhat grainy, there is a basic malt flavor that lingers after the vinegar sourness has passed. Deceptively simple. A very clean sour that kept me coming back for more.","emerge077","Oct 06, 2009"
4.12,13.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Aged in New Belgian Brewing barrels that held La Folie, this is one funky, sour brew reminiscent of Rodenbach and probably includes a strain of such yeast. Dark amber in color, with no head, the aroma is of strong sour fruits, barnyard and balsamic vinegar. Flavors are similar and can be best appreciated by sour lovers. There's some sweetness, sour apple and persimmon notes, and an overall mouth puckering effect. I've had this at the GABF and at Trinity brewery with brewer Jason. Bottles are numbered. This beer was aged in oak barrels 12 - 18 months. Jason calls it a highly acidic Flemish inspired brown, bottle conditioned with champagne yeast.","DenverLogan","Beers"
2.38,-34.4,4,3.5,2,2,1.5,"Pours a mahogany with a thin beige head. Nose has sour cherries, plums, oak, tart yeast and a subtle funky presence. Taste is very sour and acidic. Hard to drink. Also has some oak and fruity undertones. Medium body is lightly carbonated with a very acidic finish. Could use a bit of time to mellow out.","rye726","0"
