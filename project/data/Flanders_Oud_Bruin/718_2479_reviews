"I don't really like it"

"2011 vintage. Really not much going on here, smelled like vinegar, tasted like carbonated water with a just a tiny hint of malt sweetness."

"Lemony cherry nose with traces of barnyard. Pours brilliant chestnut under a 2” fluffy tannish off-white cap that dissipates to a thick film. A tart lemony citrus cherry palate with traces of chocolate hints of fruitcake. Moderately high finely bubbled carbonation with a medium body. Juicy and refreshing."

"I would drink it again."

"Effervescent with a light medium body."

"This one was solid except for a slightly metallic aftertaste that I was not a fan of."

"Tart fruit and light brown sugar light vanilla and earthy woodiness. Great brew, I'm surprised I haven't rated this before."

"Finishing off my day at Firkin by revisiting a beer I vaguely remember trying way back in my NoVa days.  It pours a clear midnight tawny topped by a finger or so of dark khaki foam.  The nose basically reminds me of a jar (if one were to exist, of course) of maple syrup-laden malt vinegar.  The taste flips things a bit, having some tart vinegar tinging dry maple syrup, with a touch of muted brine making a brief cameo near the beginning of the finish.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, an odd beer, really, what with its inability to decide on a flavor path (vinegar-leaning or maltily sweet), but it still retains its drinkability."

"Interesting take on the oud bruin style, leaning towards the sour ales. Brown in color with minimal head, and some cider/wine aromas. Taste is tart, and slightly sweet. A good dessert beer."
""
"O: an approachable sour"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown tinted red, one finger of khaki colored head, settles to a thin ring, dots of lace down the glass. Smell: balsamic, cherry, brown sugar, note of soured stone fruit. Taste: sour peach, cherry, vanilla-ish note, blackberry, herbal...fair amount of herbal bitterness; not much acidity. Carbonation is a little high and aggressive making it feel unrefined for the style."
""
""
""
""
"It had a sourness that wasn't overwhelming and made me taste buds pucker but not for long. It's a unique sour beer that one should try to expierence the vast varitey of brews."
""
""
""
""
"As someone who is not well versed in sours, this is delicious! The sourness is there but not overbearing. Black cherries, sweet malt, nutty, some funk. Medium carbonation. It's pretty light and one dimensional. Clean finish. Although I can tell this is pretty tame for a sour, it's fantastic. A very welcome and unique departure from the usual of IPA's, stouts, and pale ales. Definitely worth a try."
"I hesitate to even review this, given that I don't think I like the Oud Bruin style (i.e. ignore the rating). That said, this seems to fit the style well. Strong, full aroma of oak and tannins, puckery mouthfeel, and a mild sourness in both the lead and finish. Persistent head, pretty red-brown color. Worth trying if you're into sour beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nutty and grassy, refreshing to an unusual degree for a tart brew. this is a great beer for people like myself who like sours, but haven't yet acquired the taste for the most extreme, puckering outer limit of the style. If that describes you, this beer is probably underrated."
""

"Good sour fruit flavors, cherries, maybe green apple, and grapes. I did not pick up anything from the wood. The finish is very nice with lingering flavors of grape juice.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My experience with all other Petrus offerings has resulted in them becoming my benchmark for sours. This did not go there. But I think it was not supposed to. As a brown, it really balanced the malty sweetness with what Flanders tends to bring with sour. This beer is ripe for pairing with hearty stew."
""
"Fairly underrated brew. The aroma does not nearly match the flavor. Melanoidins, sweet, toasted bread, caramel, dominate. Flavor is fairly dark malty and sweet, but there's a nice tart, lactic finish to contrast."
""
"Overall:  A pretty good standard sour.  Mildly sour, but not very complex in flavor.  OK at the right price point, but I would generally seek out other choices of this style."

"O- This may be a good sour for those just dipping into sours, but I expect a lot more from my sours. Good thing I didn't pay a lot for this in the ""sour power"" box."
"A delicious, classic beer."
""
""
""
"Brilliant brown pour with small tan head. Funky sour cherry aroma. Taste is initially sweet but soon tart and malty. Finishes dry. Soft mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation works well with the tart taste. The carbonation does not overpower the beer or accentuate it too much. In other words. The carbonation level is just about right. Drank at The Friendly Place in San Antonio, a cool casual place with a great selection and very knowledgable staff. A pleasant experience all around."
""
""
""
"Amber reddish hue with excellent clarity. A quarter inch of beige head rests on top. Aroma of tart Brett and horse blanket is moderately present. The flavor is somewhat restrained tart Brett and horse blanket along with amber malt. The mouth is fairly carbonated and refreshing."

"On tap at D’s Six Pax and Dogz near Pittsburgh. Pours opaque reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of sour black cherries, some sweet malts, not much going on. A or follows with tart black cherries, sweet caramel malts, just a bit of sour. Medium plus palate with low medium carbonation. Not bad but there are better examples out there. I’d happily have it again though."
""
""
""
"O: Probably a good representative of the style, but my taste for the style hasn't developed enough for me to enjoy this fully or to be able to rate it accurately versus other oud bruins for example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not as much barrel/wood type flasvour as I was expecting. Also not as tart/sour as most beers within this style. Flavours are nice though and it is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Not a bad beer, worth a try but wouldn't frequently purchase this"
"O- nice, actually, excellent."

"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Deep reddish brown, mahogany tints to the light. Beige froth shows nice retention & lacing. Oak, sour berry & grape aromas, tartar hues & slight sweetness. Tartar/sourness, fruity & woody notes over toasted malts on the forefront. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Silky palate, dense to watery texture. As expected from aromas, harsh tartiness remains in the middle & lingers into the finish. Thankfully, toasted maltiness holds it, making it refreshing instead of bothering. Grape & wood on the aftertaste. Sometimes I wonder if it is a malty wine –just kidding!, it´s a good job & nice spot of the Style. Suggested pairing with heavy spiced cooked beef meat."
"O- Good beer, surprisingly light and easy to drink. I would have liked more flavor , but it was good overall. I'd have it again."
""
""
"Aroma is almost inexistent. Nice head. Good carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it's tasty and tart (a little), solid beer but nothing special. Due to its widespread availability when the mood strikes it should be easy to find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"I can see this not being true to an Oud bruin style with it's curbing if the tart flavors.  However, it worked well for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not much there really. Very one dimensional and that one dimension isn't very memorable."
"Overall not the best oud bruin I've had but its clean. It needs more tartness in the taste and could do without the odd soapy character."
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed my first foray into the Oud Bruin style, and from what I can gather, this was a good label to start with. Though I much prefer a good sour Flanders Red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of the style, since this is my first Oud Bruin I'm not very familiar with this style, but this beer seems to be pretty in line with the description of the style on BeerAdvocate, but I think I'll have to revisit this beer once I try more of the style to get a better idea of where it stands. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too acidic, not too filling, a little refreshing, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think it would be a nice beer to enjoy in the summer. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, I thought it was very nice and I really liked how fruity and sour it was. What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste wasn't more like the aroma, I wish that intensity that I got in the aroma showed up in the taste. I would buy this beer again, I enjoyed it and it's priced pretty reasonably especially for a Belgian beer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fruity and tart beers. All in all i thought this was pretty solid, it's not the best sour and fruity beer I have had, but it was good for what it is and I thought it had pretty good drinkability. I'm glad i took a chance on this beer and I'll be on the look out for more Oud Bruins and more Petrus beers. Nice job guys, keep up the good work."

"O- This is new to me. Nice blend of a brown ale and a sour."

"2012 bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste- Starts smooth and silky with active carbonation adding to a light body, mildly sour with faint hints of tart cherry with subtle hint of vanilla (likely from the barrel aging). Compared to Oud Bruin from Verzet, this is far more refined."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: refreshing and drinkable. Would enjoy 2-3 in a sitting."
""
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 10/3/2013. Pours lightly hazy very dark ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grape, pear, apple, raisin, cherry, oak, clove, red wine, vinegar, herbal, hay, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of grape, pear, apple, cherry, raisin, red wine, vinegar, oak, musty funk, herbal, hay, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cherry, raisin, red wine, vinegar, musty funk, oak, hay, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast flavors; with decent flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Flanders brown. Nice balance/complexity and decent robustness of yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"A bit disappointing because the bold sour, vinagar taste is quite refreshing, but after that there really is nothing else."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"No sour. Decent ale great color and the last wasn't bad. Excited to try it. Just fell short. I have had others of there's and been very happy. I really think it's made the way you wanted the beer to taste. Just not my thing. Little bland. Kick up the sour to go with the wood and we have gold"

"Based on the above, one might think to write this brew off as dull or underwhelming, but that is not the case at all. Though mild, the flavor is sophisticated and admirably cohesive. It looks luscious, and I just feel classy drinking it. It probably won't knock your socks off, but it's hard to find something not to like about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: So not super impressed with this one but it's hard to knock it for anything besides the lack of flavor. A good one for someone who is new to the style. Would I drink it again? Probably not."
"Think: Flanders ... Belgium ... Sweet/Sour Big Boy Beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Friendly tartness, it could be a session Oud Bruin. Not at the same level as Rodenbach, but still very pleasant and a great option for who wants to venture in the world of sours."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. An Oud Bruin ""for the masses", but still a nice beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What's this doing in a sour beer pack? There's nothing super sour (acetic or lactic) about this! The oak definitely does a decent job (could do better), but this really has got to be one of the most purportedly ""complex"" beers that I felt like either pounding on a warm day or paring with food - which I did (lamb with veggies). If you want an extremely mild beer in the style, this is one to choose for sure. Just don't pay more than $5 for it or prepare to be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"A light-bodied brown, the tangy tartness gives off a dryness in the feel and almost a sort of juiciness on the tongue. It could use a touch more something, but it's good."
""
""
"O- There are far better examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Those who buy this beer expecting a tart or sour ale like the Petrus Aged Pale will be slightly disappointed, as this beer both more dry and sweet than tart, really. It really reminded me of a dubbel with some vinous additions an a touch of astringent tartness. Drinkable due to overall low acidity, but there are better shelf things you can probably grab for this style."
"Enjoyable and different."
"Overall: A decidedly good beer, but one that could be improved upon by measures to lower the acidity. Sure, all Oud Bruins have a required level of sourness, but this recipe seems to tip the scaletoo much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A reddish brown hue with medium lasting beige head on the pour. Some mild lacing. Aroma of sweet sour tart fruit, a bit of sour grapes, some caramel malt, oak cask and vanilla notes. Taste has some oaky sour grapes almost like a red wine flavor, some malt as well. Palate is a medium body, smooth, with sweet sour and tart flavors on the tongue, with some touched of caramel malt and vanilla. Finishes with a sweet tart slightly sour grapes and fruity notes, yeast, some oak vanilla, slightly tangy notes and caramel malt. Overall a nice combination of sweet, tart and sour fruitiness and good malt balance. A very nice flavorful and drinkable brew."
""
"Eh, it's alright. Doesn't particularly interest me a lot. Would have liked more character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is sour and malted but not too sour. A lingering bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from an 11.2-ounce bottle into my Petrus Chalice. Deep yet perfectly clear amber-red in color. Needs to breathe before tasting. One finger of foam gives way to slight lacing; mild malty sour taste, interesting; dry but not quite puckeringly tart like Rodenbach; I like it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice. I would drink this any day of the week, except in the winter. And Tuesday."
""
""
"Overall, an OK mild acidic sour that is more sweet than sour. Probably a good beginner sour."
""
"The aroma has a vinous character, where you notice wooden tones there. The taste is smooth, relatively well-bodied, carbonated... You can notice the sourness characteristic of the Lambics, but not the complexity found on them. This is a differential, as there is an exaltation of the malt here, which prevails in the aftertaste, after the initial impact of the tartness. It is a very refreshing and interesting beer."
"O: Different. Every time I go to try a 'sour' of the same style, it always turns out to be some slightly different style. I haven't had a single sour of the same style and this is my first flanders oud bruin. Not bad, but I wish it was either sweeter or tarter or less yeasty. Not terribly bad but not great."
""
"This is my second sour beer after the Petrus Aged Pale, this one however is a darker beer which is more my preference. This one is not nearly as sour as the Petrus Aged Pale and offers a nice mild sour and tart taste. Still not sure I'm a sour beer fan, but this one was much more enjoyable than the Petrus Aged Pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not the best Belgian sour I've had. With the exception of the smell, everything is a little weak. I would have loved some more tartness and complexity. It's not a bad beer but it doesn't really have the flavors to stand out from the crowd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad overall; my second favorite of the trilogy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Average beer, pretty good. The look is dark brown with a small head reducing quickly to a collar. Smell is slightly malty and a little sour. The beer is refreshing and very drinkable. It's very balanced but not particularly bold or complex. I won't seek it out but I'd enjoy a revisit later."
""
""
""
""
"Ruby-brown, clean and clear, fade-away head - more or less on... The first thing to notice is how it lacks the intense, smacking tart of their pale - not wrong to compare, as the (yeast-)flavor profile is certainly similar.... Even as you let this sit and sit, the aromas and flavors merely suggest oxidation and subtle lacto-tartness - nothing hits you over the head, no watering of the mouth.... In fact, this drinks with very much reduced (in this case, sour-cherry) fruitiness / maltiness to balance compared to other popular takes on the style.... Makes this a little less dimensional - it faintly fills on intake, feathery not dirty-silky, only to fade immediately, dry with only a delicate touch of malt in the finish.... If you are turned off by bold fruity/malty contrast in this style, this may be for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit understated in the sourness, which curbs my enthusiasm for this beer. Not bad but just too mild and not complex or flavorful enough. It looks nice but the taste just doesn't match the appearance. Try it, though. Maybe you'll like it more. Kind of average."
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink and enjoyable. Not nearly as wowing as their Aged Pale though, so I would probably not got for this one again if I were in the mood for an Ouid Bruin."
"O - A sour that does not go too sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:"
"Smells like its going to be a little tart, and there is a little tartness in there. It really has a doughy yeasty flavor, not much of anything in the back end of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent, but if you're looking for something mouth puckering, this ain't it. Rather, it's balanced and easy to drink, if unexciting. A good one to introduce sour newbies to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good flavors with plenty of dark fruits but seems to be underwhelming in it's style. Earthy wood comes out as it warms and creates another layer of flavors. This should be enjoyed at cellar temp or below."
""
"Not bad. Had others that were better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - my first Oud Bruin, and I love the balance between sweet-sour-bitter, none too strong, the flavors progressing through each sip; I agree this beer could be improved by having a bit more body"
""
"Overall, and since this is the first for me on this style, I would say it was a good one. maybe I have a long way ahead of me before I can appreciate the genre but this beer set me off to a good start."
"Petrus Oud Bruin pours out a murky brown with a decent head. There's vinegary sourness on the nose, followed by some cherries and malts. The taste follows the nose, but the sour is toned down and the cherries and malts are brought up more. Only a touch of sour character on the finish really. It's tasty though! The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, Petrus Oud Bruin is a solid quaff. Don't expect anything really sour though."
""
"textbook version of an oud bruin. pours real dark brown, radiant, with a finger or two of off white suds. the nose is quite sour, vinegary, but with some sweetness from the caramel malts and a hint of tart cherry juice. the sourness isnt as potent in the flavor, but there is still that sort of bacterial acidity that works in beautiful conjunction with the toasted malt and the fruity component that tastes less like cherries than it smells, could be some other red fruit, dried and semisweet. finish is a little puckery from the yeast, but not overwhelming at all. this is sort of the session sour for me, could gladly do several of these. there is a smooth feel, gentle carbonation is just right, but the body i find to be a little thin. i dont need it to be huge or anything, but a little more weight to it would support the complexity a little better. overall though a really nice example of the style, widely available, and reasonably affordable."
""
""
"This beer pours a dark brown with no sediment and a good head with tiny bubbles. It smells faintly of sweet malts and then a vinegar smell. It tastes faintly like sweet malts and the is overwhelmingly sour. IT SCREAMS SOUR! The after taste is....you guessed it... Sour. It has a medium body but for this particular style of beer I have to assume that is it full bodied. I would not recommend but I am not a huge sour fan but I have ha better sours."
"This is a decent beer. The only slight defect is the faint diacetylic creamy notes. Otherwise, this is a smooth, slightly tart, fruity beer. It's highly drinkable and very smooth. Anyone who likes the style or likes sours should definitely try this one."
"O: A good beer, but is just missi g something. It's a bit one-note once sipping and need to keep drinking regularly to get the flavor. Worth the try regardless."
""
""
"Subtle, unique, and quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sourness, slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hops, hint of dry hop, and hint of sulfur. Fits the style of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sourness, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of citrus, and hint of metallic. Overall, good appearance, sour level is appropriate, but body is lacking in quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not super tart or funky but that is okay because I don't think I would have liked an ramped-up version of what the nose was offering."
""
""
""
"O: Excellent Oud Bruin. One of the best I’ve had. Easily drinkable and excellent flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-An interesting brew. Some sourness, lots of oaky wood flavor and brown notes. Not overwhelming and pretty easy to drink. An interesting style for sure. I think this is the first oud bruin that I've tried so don't have anything to compare it with. First thought is it's a decent change of pace but not a style of beer I'll be craving, but time will tell."
""
""
""
"O: It's a descent beer in it's style, but certainly not the best in it's style"
""
""
""
"O-This is not a bad beer, just not a great one. It lacks the complexity and intensity that I look for in this style. I suppose the cherry/vanilla components of this brew would pair with some blue cheese or something similarly sharp, but I did not find myself wanting to drink more."
""
""
""
""
"overall, this is okay. i dont like the smell as i take more sips, but i think i can finish this bottle. i have seen this before, and thought i had tried it before, but a lot of their bottles look alike. i really like the petrus aged ale which is the true ""sour"". as i drink a few more sips, i decide i can do these (maybe apprehensive/worried about that last spoiled sa,pler pack?) and it's a decent brew. a little surprised it's only 5.5% abv, but i can respect that...."
""
""
"O= This thing isn't quite what I was expecting. A little light on flavor for me. Little flavor and sort of watery. Reminds me of a tonic water actually. Check it out and judge for yourself."
"Pours a deep reddish tinted brown, minimal head but active bubbles. Scent leads with dark, vinous fruit, some brown sugary sweetness with the faintest hints of earthy funk and damp wood. Taste brings the fruit but lacking in tartness or acidic sharpness expected in style, sugary sweet malts, but not overly powerful, light caramel, notes of damp oak and earth on the back end. Medium bodied, moderately bubble. Decent beer, but not the best representation of the style."
""
""
"O: not bad but not great. a bit too light in flavor for my liking a little too much old and not enough young"
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, lots of carbonation, fair head, but no lacing. Nose is woody and fruity. Flavor is a little bread, accentuated with a lightly acidic fruity tone. Light and fruity. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall, this is a very refreshing, though light-flavored, beer. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. A nice entry beer for someone just starting to explore the weird world of sours. I think I prefer Petrus Aged Pale better. The flavor of that beer is a bit more intense and interesting."
""
"O: This is a great, balanced sour beer. It not to sour and is great a example to introduce wine drinkers to a complex, flavorful beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a middle-of-the-road FOB, nothing bad about it but also not one I'll seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Good. I'd order another. Would buy again, but the $4.99 price point for one bottle is too steep."
""
""
"I’ll have another."
""
""
""
"O: its tasty, deffinatly not bad, but nothing to get overly excited for, the real turn off for me was the fact I was reminded of nail polish in the aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good example of the style. Sour but not overly sour. Nice mix of oak and malts with the sour fruits and sweet yeasts. Low alcohol, good starter into the world of sours and oaked beers."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Roasty and rustic that delivers delicate sweet and tartness. I liked this due to the aged and earthy flavors that brings the mixture into a more controlled state."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just about what you would expect- a crisp, refreshing sour brown ale. Very precise execution, and excellent balance. Still, it's borderline bland, which isn't something I look for in a $0.40/oz. bottled beer. Worth trying, but won't make it into my regular rotation."
"O: Not an overwhelmingly satisfying Flanders, but it hits some key notes of sour goodness. I’ll stick to the Aged Pale, but this was a nice expedition into lighter territory."
""

"This beer looked great and smelled nice, but was underwhelming when it came to the taste/body department. That said it is easy to drink and may be great to introduce others to sours before diving all the way in."
""
""
""
"An easy drinker. Good option for someone looking to get started in the world of sours."
""
"Mellow and creamy with a silky body and tight carb. A selling point. 4.0"
"Nice presence on the palate makes this a beer worth coming back to. I recommend this beer to anyone looking to get into sour ales and needs something not overbearing to start their journey from. I beer that I have overlooked for too long but will now be sharing with friends for some time to come."
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tulip, the beer is a dark brown color with ruby highlights and a thin, smooth coating of light brown foam. Aromas of dates, leather, raisin, and peat. Good earthy and sweet nose. Flavors are rich and layered, with a mocha coffee backbone giving rise to some slightly sour currant and wine-like characteristics. Tangy, old world fruit characters highlight the brew, such as plum, fig, and raisin. The light body and carbonation keep the beer crisp, and avoid the cloying mouthfeel. The aftertaste is a dark, rich sweetness with a subtle sour tang. Clean, slightly astringent finish that gives a touch of pucker in mouth. Good, easy to drink beer. This would make the perfect gateway beer for people venturing into the world of Flanders/sours."

"Overall this is a decent beer. My one complaint is all the flavors are too short lived. Nothing really lingers."
""
""
"High drinkability. I'd have another."
""
""
""
""
"O - not a bad sour per se, but there are so many that are leaps and bounds better."
"2.5 D: Not really impressed with this one. It's about as mild as I've had for the style. This is a shame considering I like the Petrus Pale."
""
"O - a nice surprisingly refreshing beer."
""
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer has great drinkability but might seem a bit watery to some. The body is slick and smooth and never sticky or coating. The carbonation is rather fizzy at first but becomes more creamy as the beer warms."
""
""
"Light body with some fine carbonation, lending to a smooth mouthfeel. Pretty easy to drink and refreshing, but not very flavorful."
"O- definitely one of the most sour beers I've had, however it seems pretty well balanced and makes for a good choice if you are looking to switch it up a bit. However, if you a not a fan of oak, this one isn't for you."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a very lively cap of dense tan foam. The aroma is a tart fruity affair. Dark fruit with a tinge of metallic character mixes in. The palate starts with a kiss of tartness. The sourness fades through the center and toward the end. A malt backbone pervades allowing the tartness to slip through. A hint of the oak barrels remains, but not much. Some interesting features to this, but I find myself wanting for more."
"Overall it's still one and done since the sourness leaves my whole throat so very dry... Glad to have a sour that drank so sooth."
"A decent beer with a not so great aroma. I'm not a huge fan of sour beers, but this one has a nice tartness, not an overpowering puckering sourness, which is nice. Haven't had a ton of beer in this style, but I would say there are better."
"First of style, nice n different."

"I like it. I don’t love it. But I like it. For a beer that has this much history and this much passion behind the process, I expected more. I wanted it to be thicker, and not to have as much carbonation. I do like the sour finish, but when that’s gone I don’t see myself checking back in for another drink. I like it… but I might not buy another bottle. I wonder if this beer gets better as it warms up…"

"Overall, this is a decent blend of barrel aging, sourness, and belgian candi sugar maltiness. Pleasant and enjoyable, but did not knock my socks off."
""
"Overall: This is a good beer. I like the aged pale by Petrus more but if you like this style give it a shot for sure. I'll probably pick this one up again in the future when I get around to it with the $$$ and flavor curiosity."
""
"I've been going through a bunch of oud bruins in the past few days, I was hoping to like this one more since I LOVE the aged pale. There isn't enough barrel in this and its not sour enough to be great for me, but its a decent table beer"
""
"Had at 7th Sun in Dunedin FL. Pours a deep Mahogany with brilliant red hues. The aroma is nice and malty with notes of leather and some ripe fruit. Some nice earthy malt flavors up front with some slightly tart notes in the back. The body is fairly light with a medium/high carbonation. A very nice wild ale, very mild. This would be a great beer to use as an introduction to sours."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you're buying this for sour factor, you're probably going to be disappointed, unless you truly like it as just one of the elements of a beer, as opposed to a dominant or appreciable element to any sufficient degree."
"Overall a VERY easy drinking Oud Bruin, with a noticeable sweet Welches grape character to it. THere is some mild tartness here, but a bit burried so it makes for a perfect starter ""sour""."
""
"O: Its kind of bland and doesn't really have a ""wow"" factor."
"This one pours a medium bodied Coca Cola brown in color with a frothy beige lacing around my glass. The aromas are pretty simple. All I can really pick up are slightly roasted malts and the interesting creamy sour sweetness typical for the style. I guess you could say some dark hard candy as well. It's not exactly a standout. The flavor too features the slight roast upfront then goes into a candied dark fruit sweetness with an ever so slight tartness. I prefer more acidity. It's also not very complex. It drinks medium in body but this beer doesn't really offer a whole lot for the style. The flavors are subtle and the sweetness is featured a little more than other Oud Bruins. This beer is a nice starting point for the style but not really worth it otherwise in my opinion."

"11.2oz. bottle served in my Weyerbacher tulip. Pours a deep, translucent mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that dissipates into a soapy skim and a frothy band around the edges. Nose expresses cider vinegar, oak, tannins, a vinous quality and a suggestion of vanilla. Elements of the nose are also expressed in the flavor profile; however, everything comes off a bit watered down. There's also a hint of oxidation; however, it's not at all unpleasant. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation, some acidity that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and a semi-dry finish. However, the overall impression comes off somewhat thin. All and all this beer is a somewhat lackluster example of an Oud Bruin. Not bad, but really missing the body and complexity I've come to associate with the style."
"O- Very different than the other Flanders I've run across and it's nice to have one that isn't so overly funky and sour. It's good for a change."
"Oak cask and lactic sourness build a delicious aroma above the dark ruby-brown draught. Grape, juice is the dominant fruit, and a little horse blanket rounds out the funkworks here, also caramel makes an appearance. Diacetyls lend a slippery mouthfeel, which is aided by a nice medium bodied backbone. I do enjoy this beer quite fully and would recommend it to a friend with a palate for sours. 5/10 sour scale."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer but there are better in the style."
"O: This beer is not good."
"Pours a brown color that resembles dark root beer. A light beige head tops the beer and recedes leaving slightly above average lacing. Smells of sour tart fruit highlighted a very slight oak note. First sip is a tad disappointing as there was more sour tartness in the nose than in the taste. There’s a bunch of dark fruits and cherries here. Surprisingly there is not as much oak at all and certainly not for a beer aged in oak barrels for 20 months. Roasted malts dominate the flavor when preferably it should be tart fruits and oak. Tastes watered-down even though it is well carbonated."
"Pours a murky cranberry-brown color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks and dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour fruit, balsalmic vinegar, funk, and some wood aromas. This beer smells very good. Unfortunately, the taste is nowhere near as good as the smell. There are some watery sour fruit flavors and only minor funk and vinegar flavors. I am pretty surprised and bummed out because of this. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am disappointed in the flavors compared to what I expected from the smells."
"Pours a dark brown with a one finger off white head. Decent carbonation and lacing on this brew. Very dark in appearance- impossible to see through. Nose is of wine, raisins, weak malt, prunes.. Fairly thin on the nose, I'd like some more complexity and funk in there. Taste is the nose profile exactly. Nothing amazing here.... Feel is fairly light, syrupy, and sweet/sour. Not much in the sour department though. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, it just doesn't live up to the style for me. A little too one dimensional/boring."
"O: Good, although it seems to me like it is a weird combination of roasted and sour. Nice but not something I would drink everyday."
"Found this beauty on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT. It shows a deep muddy brown color with a big bubbled bit of off-white head and great lacing. The aroma brings a nice malty apple vinegar. The tongue gets a moderate sour bite of more vinegar malt with a subtle touch of milk chocolate. There’s some hint of cherry as well. This mellows into a nice old ale, but not one of those ""off the charts"" tongue twisters. Not a power pucker. But that’s fine, it becomes pretty drinkable for the style, offering a medium light body and a low carbonation, slightly resinous but a generally aqueous feel. Very nice."
"Overall Drinkability - Not a whole lot of complexity. Sort of a bare-bones, skeletal variety of sour."
"D: Quite drinkable but as I've heard before from Dr. Bill Sysak: if it's a good beer, it's good enough to be sipped."
"This is a straightforward sour. Solid, but leaving me wanting for a bit more."
"Overall - It's a shame that the Aged Pale is so good and this one is so meh. Where's the tartness? I'm looking for something more than this, although what it has isn't bad."
"Overall: more sweet than I expected and no oak to spea kof for my palate despite the oak barrel aging."
"Not a bad brew, but some more sourness could make this a real winner; just seems overly malty at times."
"D -- Likely the most approachable Oud Bruin I've had to date. Essences and nuanced as opposed to a shock to the mouth, this is quite a good brew."
"Poured a massive 3.5"" head. Dark clear burnt umber brown color. Smells of dried fruit and the unavoidable sour of the style. Taste also has the dried fruit as well as caramel, and happily although the sour is present it is less so than their Pale Ale version I recently tried. I'll give the Oud Bruin the edge since I find it more approachable."
"O: This is my first oud bruin and I was not sure what to expect. I like the flavor and the fact that the sourness does not overtake everything. I would buy this again and I'm eager to try others in this style."
"- This is a great oakey, lightly bitter, lightly soured - slightly sweet brew. It seems to mix a lot of great brown ale, flanders, and oaked characteristics with an old school touch. Not bad at all. Worth the occasional purchase."
"Overall a solid oud bruin."
"O: I've never had this style of beer. I liked it. 4"
"Overall: a tasty beer which is very drinkable. If this were available on tap around here I'd be quaffing it all the time, no doubt."
"O: I expected something interesting, I got a drain pour. If this is a typical oud bruin, I guess I finally found a style I do not care for."
"The major problem I have with this beer, however, is that the sour notes--even though they seem light at first--prove overwhelming after the first mouthful, deadening the tongue to the point where subsequent sips are almost all sourness. I would have preferred a more balanced ale, or at least one that let more of the flavors come through."
"Tasty beer; I prefer their sour selections like the Aged Pale, but this one is pretty good. Nice started if someone wanted to start venturing into sour territory."
"I think this would really hit the spot on a warm autumn afternoon; the flavors kind of remind me of fall, and it's refreshing enough for fairly warm weather."
"O - Duch De Bourg and Liefmans Goudenband are far better examples of this style. Billy B's Dark Apple beer beats them all."
"O - Haven't tried many of this style, but this seems to be one of the better ones, and I would try again. Certianly worth a try for those curious."
"D-The taste is pretty one note for me, and I don't think I'd pick this one up again; very approachable for newbies to sour beer, however."
"cheers."
"The Reveal: Petrus Oud Bruin aged in Oak Barrels."
"Overall: I like everything about this beer except the mouthfeel. It's got good flavors and is easy to drink and its a pretty beer to look at as well"
"Overall - very interesting brew and brew style! Unique in taste, but not intriguing. That is, there's not a lot of variety within the tasting itself, but the taste itself is interesting."
"Fairly light in the mouthfeel. Very drinkable and enjoyable for the style. Would have expected a little more tartness in the flavor, but a good brew overall."
"Overall: Not thrilling, lacks sourness, and possesses a few off flavors. In areas that lack sour ales though (e.g. Fresno, San Luis Obispo), this provides a bit of relief."
"Pours a rusty amber color with a short off-white head and a few spots of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose carries some light bready malt and a bit of caramel. Amber malt. Some cherry and very light oak and acidity. The flavor brings some moderate malt and a touch of sweetness with light fruits. No real oak or acidity. Way, way off style. I don't get much of even a note of sourness out of this one. While I'm up for interpretation of styles, if you're going to call a beer an ""Oud Bruin," it'd better have something more than light malt and a touch of fruit going on."
"O- I have to say I'm definitely becoming more of a fan of this style, as I've enjoyed several of these recently. I think this is a quality brew, very approachable, and it is very delicate, I would pair it with food very carefully as any strong flavors could potentially wash it out."
"O- Pretty decent brew. i would like a little more developed flavor, as it seemed like a pretty basic Belgian flavor profile with a little tartness thrown in. I would have liked more sour-ness, but then i am probably looking to the wrong style for that. Not a bad brew, would drink it again but not one i would seek out (esp. at $4 for a 12 oz. bottle)"
"O- Overall this one surprised me. Very cool, very different but one I'll probably pick up again."
"Overall- WOW! Now this was a great beer I'm glad I came back to! Will be buying this again! Drinkability is easy and very different from any other Oud Bruin. I'm thinking that is why the Flanders is in front of it. Will be interested in seeing how other people react and give their two cents on this beer."
"Taste - Again, very soft and leaning more towards sweet than sour. A slight cherry flavour is present, but overall very restrained and reserved. Nowhere near as sour or complex as I expected from this style."
"Deep red color. Nose a little cellar, we feel that the beer comes from more than 12 months of barrel fermentation. Macerated fruit but also great power. Slightly tannic palate but without original flavors if not subtle acidity made ​​by some currants. It just also add persistence in the aftertaste that sounds a little card. So a good oud bruin but very foolish and unable to stand Liefmans standards."
"This is not a bad beer, but also not one I'd reach for when in want of an oud bruin."
"Verdict: Very nice and refreshing, but not top tier. A good beer that's worth trying, but I'd prefer slightly less vibrant carbonation."
"O: Good drinker and I thought this was a well balance and unique beer."
"overall, this is a bit on a average side. nothing really stands out."
"(D)- For the money, a great bang for your buck style-wise. Smooth and easy drinking, while still fitting the style well. Quite sessionable when you are looking for a Oud Bruin."
"A very easy drinker, and the least imposing ""sour"" beer I've ever had. The aroma had me pretty excited, but the flavor, while not bad at all, is very subdued from start to finish."
"Overall, it's okay. Not a strong sourness at all, which is a little disappointing, but I'm not too mad I got this. Worth a shot if you're into the style, but I wouldn't recommend going in with huge expectations. :x"
"O - This is my first flanders-style ale, and I wasn't sure I was gonna like it. I was pleasantly suprised. Smells more sour than it really is, rounds out nicely on the pallete. I'm not sure I will buy it again, but I will drink this one, and I'm glad I've tried it."
"D-Very Easy to drink, The flavors and booze combine well. Nothing really great about this beer but def. a nice drinkable beer"
"D - Interesting flavor and aroma. The body is a little thinner than expected. Still this stands out as a different style than your everyday stouts and pales. Not as good as the Petrus Oak Pale, but still very drinkable."
"Good carbonation and taste although it was a little weak compared to others of its kind. That being said I would like to try this again as it was drinkable and I need a second opinion."
"D: Easy to drink, yet wonderfully complex."
"That being said, it's got good carbonation and finishes clean. I could shotgun this. Does that make it drinkable? This beer was kind of a mystery and I wish it was more. Hrm."
"D: Pretty good drinkability but couldn't handle more than a couple at a time."
"Certainly not a bad beer, and certainly one I'd drink happily if it were available, but also as certainly not something extravagant and special."
"O: Very drinkable. I liked this one a lot. It might not have been super complex, but it was very well balanced and pleasant to drink. Comparable to Bellegems, maybe someday I'll have to do a blind tastings."
"Not sure what's going on with the metallic presence. Infected yeast? Regardless, certainly not as impressive as Petrus Aged Pale. Considering the perceived off taste, probably worth another try."
"Overall- Ok beer, but not a great example of the style. Does not have near the complexity of the better examples of the style. This is non-offensive, but even Monks Cafe is better steping stone into Oud Bruins."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured deep brown with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount fairly quickly. Maintains decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt and slight sour funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, slight sour, and fruit on the followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was pretty nice and smooth. Had a nice flavor, but the aroma was kind of weak as far as intensity. The flavor was very pleasing though and I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style without hesitation."
"D-well considering I wanted it to be over once I took my first sip...I'll say this isn't too drinkable. i feel this is a beer for wine lovers but not for too many beer lovers. a full bottle is difficult to finish."
"D - A drinkable beer but the carbination could be toned down and I'm intrigued to know if the tartness would dissapear with age and the sweetness would come through a bit more."
"T: Slightly sweet. Light and somewhat fruity with a bit of malt character. Finishes with brown sugar and some dark fruits."
"Overall, this was an okay beer, but I've had others of the style that I prefer, such as Monk's Cafe."
"Petrus Oud Bruin comes with a pop when the cork is removed. Pours out a dark red and becomes a dark brown when condensed in the glass. Some maroon spots with red showing towards the side. A nice sturdy dirty tan head billows above, ok lace. This bruin does not smell overly sweet and vinegar laden, thank god. I get big time cherry and plum, other dark fruits. Comes off vinious. Taste is superb, a great mix, starts off mildly sweet going into a slight sour twist with a aftertaste of cherry. Oak does not come out that much, and this spent like 30 months in the dark, that will tell you how fruit forward this is. Feel is a bit of a let down. While light bodied and easily drinkable, the finish comes off a bit rusty and bumpy, leaving a semi metallic taste afterwards, which is strange. All in all another drinkable beer from the boys at Bavik/Petrus. I expect them to send a ton of this to Philly as they did with the aged pale, they literally flooded the market with that one. I could drink a big bomber of this to the head, no problem. 5.5%, yep!"
"D- this is a solid sour and from them. Paired very well with some goose liver mouse."
"Overall this is another pretty good easily found and affordable Flanders but lacks a little special something to make it great."
"The taste is thin, yet satisfying. The dark color bespeaks a more complex beer, but the Petrus Oud Bruin delivers, with a pleasant sour finish. It's not a lambic, not a fruit beer; rather, a malty, tart treat. Probably not sessionable, but a pleasant drink nonetheless."
"D: this isn't as good as the Aged Pale. It is less assertive with the tart quality and falls short of being a great brew."
"Petrus Oud Bruin does not have the richness or complexity of other ales aged in wood casks. There's no hint of vanilla or, oddly, any wood flavor. Instead, it has the light bubbly taste and feel of a fruit beer."
"D - well, a bit unique and good for a change. drinkable yet not very captivating."
"D - An interesting beer that is worth trying. Can't see it being a regular though."
"A really toned down oud bruin good for beginners to the style"
"D: overall a decent beer for just drinking and not really thinking about it. If I'm reaching for a sour oud bruin this will not be my first choice or second or third."
"Bottle. Poured a dark reddish brown mahagony with a nice 2 finger head that slowly dissipates. Woody sour notes in the nose. Watery very slight sour taste is the first thought that runs through my head as I take my first sip. Fairly light mouthfeel on this one. Not really that good for a sour ale. Really not sour at all. Slight bitter end. Looks a lot better than it tastes or smells. Glad I only bought 1 to try it."
"Dark copper brew with a thin ivory head. Aroma is fairly sweet and grapey, like sparkling grape juice. Taste is like malty sparkling grape juice. Fruit, berries, oak, and bread, with a lemongrass finish. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, very good, but perhaps a bit too sweet. As it warms some darker coffee aromas emerge."
"D: goes down so easy you want more and more."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not the experience that I was looking for in terms of robustness in mouth, nose and feel; still, it's pretty refreshing and fine for the summer, but there are definitely some other beers that provide much of an experience."
"drinkable nonetheless. I was just expecting more bite though."
"O: not bad but seems dulled down/purposefully held back from its potential, strong raspberry, resembles a juice squeeze in some ways, gets worse as i have more, lacking complexity"
"Overall, this is an average beer at best, salvaged only by its mouthfeel and low ABV. I think it would be suited perfectly for somebody just starting to explore sours, but a well developed palate will find its missing in many areas."
"overall - reminds me more of NG old english porter than the (few) oud bruins I've had so far...although what do I know. needs more carbonation in the body, and its too sweet and malty."
"Carbonation is extremely high. Combined with the acidity this makes for a very prickly beer."
"D: the brew drank well but was expecting more tartness considering it was a flanders style beer. I think it needed more of sour punch."
"Drinkability -- While this was an easy-drinking beer, there wasn't much exciting going on. Sure, you could drink this all night, but why? It tastes thin and watered down. This was a bit of a let down. Next time I'll stick with their Aged Pale."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. A clear reddish dark brown. A thin head soon diminishes to a ring. The nucleating scores on the glass support an island of head in the middle. Dark malt smells. Very smooth. Malts give way to a very moderate sour finish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a bark beer. The carbonation brightens it up a bit."
"Verdict: I have to say, Petrus Oud Bruin is a bit of a frustrating beer to me. Clearly, the basics are in place, but the flavor profile is just too thin, like the beer has been watered down slightly and served extremely cold."
"Drinkability- What you'd expect from the style."
"Nice beer here - my first from Petrus. I'll be buying more."
"Not bad if you don't have Haandbakk available, and it has some character, but it doesn't have much of that powerful sweet & tart oud bruin richness to it."
"The beer pours a clear reddish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is dark fruit with some grape notes. I don't get much tartness in the smell. The flavor is very light tart grapes with a nice caramel malt backbone that adds some sweetness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer, but not near as good as the Petrus Aged Pale, which is excellent."
"drinkability: a nice sour with not too much punch."
"Taste is a little tart with some dark fruit. Not real complex but refreshing. Mouth feel is rather effervescent. Pretty drinkable but not worth seeking out again."
"Feel is light and prickly with decent carbonation. Somewhat dry, though not as much as what most people are saying. Just a good easy drink that has some nice flavors."
"Maybe my taste buds were overwhelmed by a bottle of Bashah I had earlier... but with an hour and a glass of water between the two, I doubt it."
"I'm just starting with sours and this is very approachable. Everything seems very subtle."
"Drank in a balloon glass at 50-55deg."
"Drinkability: The abv is almost session range and the beer goes down easily. I was worried about opening this 750 by myself, but quickly found the bottle empty."
"Taste of a very muted brown ale. I enjoy and nice brown ale and that is really the impression I received of this beer. Not so much a sour / oud bruin. Most who have had oud bruins would say this does not really match the norm for the style. As such I am giving it a lower rating, but it is not a bad brown ale all taken. Slightly dry and tempered, it is not a wild beer, more like a very slightly infected mild brown ale. Caramel, toffee match a light oak presence. Medium mouthfeel and a light carbonation."
"A miss."
"M- Lighter, dry and prickly"
"This one along with monk's Cafe are utterly forgettable examples of this style."
"It was surprisingly refreshing for a sour beer, and might be a great ""gateway beer"" if you wanted to introduce your friends to sour beers. While I was tasting it, I was thinking that it would go very well with chocolaty desserts, particularly brownies. Overall, it was a good brown ale with a bit of dryness and a hint of sourness."
"Lighter body, with a good amount of carbonation, giving a slightly creamy and fuller feel. Could be refreshing, but the harshness from oak and earthy flavors detracts a bit."
"D - fantastic. didn't know what to expect, but the description on my importer's label (which is somewhat different than what's pictured) was spot on: ""old brown ale aged in oak casks for 2 years."" a little of this, a little of that, the final result being something I could drink all night without getting bored OR drunk."
"What a great beer...I'll be drinking this again for sure."
"Overall a nice beer but if I am looking for an old Bruin, I am looking for more than this one. Still a nice example and one that is easily accessible."
"A decent flavor, again...nothing that really jumps out. Light, crisp mouthfeel...decent carbonation, not boozy at all(not expected at 5.5% ABV). Finishes a little dry, with a fruit aftertatse long after each sip. Flavor has some lager notes to it, which I find interesting. Oak and yeast are definitely prominant. Overall, a decent beer...and an easy drinker."
"D: The ""sourness"" in this beer is more laid-back and enjoyable, imho. It's much more drinkable than big sour beers such as the Petrus Aged Pale."
"D - Drinks nicely. Not my favorite beer for the style or sours in general, but still nice."
"Overall, a good beer that I wish was a little more extreme."
"D: This is very easy to drink. The unique flavor leaves me yearning for another."
"Drink this is a very drinkable beer and if the cost was less I'd get it a lot."
"taste is of sour malt, dark fruit, a touch of spice, and a little caramel, ends a little dry, somewhat sour, and a little bitter."
"D- Tasty and unique. Not as extreme as the Aged Pale alone but it is more refreshing."
"Feel/Drink: The mouth is nice and smooth. I can drink a couple of these and enjoy them. Lot of different flavors going on."
"D: a good example of the style, as well as a good intro to sour brews."
"D-Not a lot going on. Aroma is nice but everything else is kind of average. Would be nice if this had more of the aged beer in the blend."
"Taste follows the nose with a decent dose of malt and some light tart notes. Easy drinking but doesn't offer much of a tart bite. Pleasant feel and quite well carbonated though a bit dense for the style."
"Notes: Pretty good as far as balancing the tartness. If you want a lot of oakiness, there are probably better choices, it's always there but never outstanding. I liked this, it just seemed a little watered down flavor wise."
"D - A mild disappointment... Seems to lack any sort of complexity, especially in terms of taste and mouthfeel... This isn't a bad beer, but it's one that can easily be forgotten about, especially when compared to its Flanders Red and Oud Bruin counterparts..."
"Basically reminded me of a ""session"" sour ale. Kind of like a Monk's Cafe...I guess I may have been spoiled by Duchess."
"M - Thin bodied, foamy."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a new style Boulevard Chalice. Bottle conditioned. Brown with some red highlights. Sparse head. Not a lot of carbonation. Fruity aroma with some cherry. A bit of acetic sourness in the nose as well. Fairly sweet in the flavor however. More dark fruit and some caramel. Just a hint of sourness. A little metallic in the finish to start, but this faded. Didn't get much wood flavor. This didn't do a whole lot for me."
"D - Good and refreshing. Would definitely like to have more in the future."
"A good and very mild and approachable example of the style. Definitely a good introduction to the Oud Bruin style and maybe even to the entire world of sours. It has complexity and sourness but only just enough to let you know it is indeed a sour ale."
"D Fair to good. This is a fine beer but it lacks that nice sweet/tart punch that I like in this style. Also, it is quite expensive. 3.5"
"D – The saddest thing is drinking the last sip."
"D- Moderate. Complex, really took my time with this one, and enjoyed it. I'd buy it again, but couldn't have more than one per sitting. A contemplative beer."
"Just kind of blah. I think I was expecting more for some reason. Nothing bad. Though nothing I will get again when there are much better versions easier to get."
"This beer came in a variety six pack. The color looks a lot like coca cola and has a decent head. The first aroma I caught was of sweet apples. The taste is a little bit bitter, with the apples kind of in note form and not full flavor. The flavor is slightly alcoholic but I really like this."
"Good but one dimensional."
"It poured with a rich creamy head that as the beer warmed a bit released wonderful scents. One can smell and taste the dried fruits (raspberries, cherries, citrus) and a hint of oak aging on the tongue. The beer has acomplex flavor that lingers on the palate but it is not nera as tart as one would expect. Goes down smoothly with nice texture."
"D: Surprisingly pretty light and drinkable. Not much of an aftertaste. Many sour beers upset my stomach a little, but this one doesn't."
"Drinkability: This beer is now in my top 10. I love the sourness combined with the woodiness. I have not had anything that tastes like this before. This is my favorite sour beer post my Eulogy trip to Philadelphia. The low abv means I could have several."
"A-"
"Overall: A pleasingly complex Oud Bruin. I recommenced it."
"All in all a nice beer to visit from time to time. Drinkable and within sessionable strength. Also fits the definition of the style very well."
"Still, worth a try for sure."
"But the beer is not super sour, don't get me wrong, it is sour. Its just not tart. There are some cherry flavors, this beer is sour and not tart, that's the best way I can put it. It finishes comlpetely. It is a palate cleansing beer, completely. I did not remember drinking it seconds after I swallowed. Drinkability high. I had to keep drinking it to analzye it and it was gone, in a few minutes completely gone. Beer has a medium body and a nice mouth feel, hit all the right places on the palate before vaporizing."
"Malty up front, but thinning at mid palate due to the souring note going into the astringent finish."
"Ok, but by no means great"
"Glad I've had one, will not be having another."
"M/D - Palate starts a little acidic and tart, but finishes smooth. Medium body. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"Bottle claims aged 20 months, but palate doesn't quite have synergy as thought."
"Not my kind of thing."
"D: Moderate alcohol and an effervescent mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable. The flavors and aromas are good, but not great, so I doubt I will have this again at nearly $4 for a 330ml bottle."
"Very well balanced - nothing too strong, a hint sweet. Easily drinkable."
"D - This is a pretty good flanders oud bruin. Just a touch of sour makes a nice balance."
"Drinkability - not on my short list, but not a bad beer."
"Appearance was a dark, but very carbonated. Smells like a Flander with a slight hint of sourness in the nose. The taste is initially dominated by very high carbonation, slight sourness, and then a hint of molasses. All taste dissipates quickly. A little too thin for my taste, but generally drinkable. Not as rich and creamy as the Oud Bruin's I had years ago in Holland."
"An interesting beer and for those that like the sourness thing a winner. I'll wait until I go to Belgium before I have another"
"d: Not at all big and not all that complex. This is just very tasty and refreshing."
"Medium body, with nice, tingly carbonation. Not a difficult beer to drink at all. Not bad. Seems pretty neutral, and a good beginner Oud Bruin, so it turned out to be a good choice for me."
"D - The flavours are interesting but they don't work for me. This is not one of Petrus' best beers, not a scratch on the speciale."
"drinkability is good. the brew is mildly complex and catches the palate off guard with the dichotomy between the nose and palate. that being said, the beer is quite drinkable and not too sweet, which works to its benefit. cheers!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy dark reddish-brown, with a multitude of fuzzy, creamy off-white head, that leaves spotty lacing as it fades away. It smells of sour fruit - cherry, apples, and sweet grainy malt. The taste is mild earthy, sour fruit, and roasted caramel malt. The carbonation is moderate, the body a little thin, and it finishes with some lingering fruitiness. An interesting beer, but the advertised woodiness doesn't really assert itself, other than in the roasted malt character. The fruitiness becomes a tad cloying, without the hops to keep things honest - overall, a decent brown ale with a minor sour essence."
"Pours a cloudy brown. Aroma is slightly sweet with cola-esque qualities. On the palate, it is similar to Coca-cola as well. Hint of oak, vanilla, and prune. Not much tartness or depth which makes it a touch out of balance, leaning a bit too sweet. Enjoyable enough beer, but is seems like a pretty tame Oud Bruin. Entry level stuff."
"Drinkable but the flavors leave something to be desired. Good overall but not something I would go to great lengths to seek out. I think my girlfriend liked this beer a lot more than I did judging from her smile..."
"Drinkability is good, I wouldn't mind having a few more on a hot day to quench my thirst."
"The mouthfeel is crisp, nice transitioning between sweet and sour. This adds up to a very drinkable beer."
"a decent flanders with a proper look of dark red with a mild murk and a mild head. smell of tart, cherries, and sour apples. taste was a subdued version of that. a bit boozy with a weak malt character. not much horizon in the flavor. rather simple. tart is not assertive. a tad sweet. not much of a wood present either."
"Notes: A really nice sour brown. A good intro to the world of oud bruin. Not too exotic, not too extreme. Great balance with good carbonation levels and clean edges."
"Well, I don't have much experience with this style, but I'm definitely not averse to it and enjoy the various sour styles. This beer pours a dark but somewhat clear brown with a big fluffy beige head that stands strong for some time. The aroma is a bit strange. It smells a bit like a vinegary small brown ale, which I guess it is, but it doesn't pull it off quite well enough. The aroma is interesting but a bit thin and acrid. There are some interesting fruit notes in it and some malt nuttiness, but I much prefer the flavor. The flavor is surprisingly refreshing. It's sweet and sour with a bit caramelized malt. The fruits flavors really shine, like lemons, apricots, grapes and apples brightened up with a dash of vinegar. It's a shame that the bottle is so small and relatively expensive because it seems like an enjoyable pub beer to drink for an evening."
"I like this. I rarely see this style around much so it's always a treat to give it a try. Definitely easy to drink and enjoy."
"This is the second Petrus brew that I have tried after the Petrus Tripel. Poured into a Delirium glass, which produced a very dark brown color. The head was minimal and there was very little lace in the glass. Like many Belgian Ales, Petrus gives off a sour scent, but this attribute is only slightly present in the taste. After some initial sourness, the beer quickly fades off and doesn't leave any distinguishable mark. There is nothing offensive about this beer, yet nothing spectacular about it either."
"ever so slightly thin, but still smooth, with acidic texture at the end. crisp carbonation has moments of fluffiness."
"D - Refreshing, tasty and a something to it. This is a good brew which I am happy to drink a few of."
"Mouthfeel is nice: the body is not too thick or too thin, & the carbonation gently massages the palate. Ahhh. A pleasurable beer, complex without being overpowering. Could sit & sip this all day."
"Had on tap at Local 44 in Philly. Poured a purple brown into a tulip with a thick cream colored head. Smell was bitter fruity of raisins and bread. Taste was pungent and fruity similar to a brandy or whiskey. Mellow Belgian hops in the finish. Complex beer definitely worth trying but nowhere near as interesting or tasty as some similar beers."
"D - This one is alright. Probably wouldn't seek it out but not opposed to drinking one."
"D: This is a decent enough beer. It grew on me as I drank, but lacked that certain something the pushes a beer to the next level."
"Surprisingly smooth. Undeniably drinkable. Restrained oak and acidity, coupled with its slightly fruitiness make it a suitable match with say, smoked fish, or braised meat."
"Had a bottle with a steak dinner in Ghent. Appears a dark brown with a light tan head. This beer was disappointingly sweet, like big, candy sugar content sweetness with only a bit of cocoa. There's a too-mild sour tang (for the style). While it's not a bad beer, it's a pale example for the style. Still, it wasn't bad with my steak."
"M&D: I suppose the combination of a lack of more assertive sour fruitiness and an additional, unusual mustiness (maybe due to bottle-conditioning instead of just filtering as in most other counterparts) makes this ale stand out from the crowd as an unusual example of Oud Bruin; but this can also play against the overall enjoyment at the expense of expected complexity. All in all, this medium-bodied, smoothly carbonated ale is easy to drink but not as attractive in terms of overall performance."
"D: It's a surprisingly drinkable beer (one of my favorite beers is the Rodenbach Grand Cru, a Flanders Red Ale, and though I love it, you can't drink to much of it in a session--I guess I was expecting something similar). I think I'll definitely be buying this one again and I highly recommend it!"
"Very easy to drink and interesting enough to have again, but I was hoping for something legitimately sour."
"I wasn't too impressed with this as I've remembered others in the style being much more interesting."
"Nothing stellar here. I love Petrus Aged Pale, think I'll be sticking with that."
"HV"
"Drinkability suffers because of the fact that it just isn't my cup of tea."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Good acidity, low abv, pleasant tartness."
"A very good representation of the style. Taste and aroma may be just a bit one-dimensional, but it is fairly robust, very drinkable and quite appetizing."
"Pours with a good amount of head and only a little yeast left in the bottle. It's a pretty dark brown/red. Darker than any other of the style i've had. Head receeds disappointingly fast with little to no lace. Smell is light and pleasent. Cherry fruits and crisp Brett. Very nice but very subtle. Taste is similar, very slight sour with cherries and fruit that doesn't laste long enough. It is really a teaser beer and really leaves you wanting more. This is a great place to start with this style but I can't wait for red poppy!"
"All in all, not a bad representation of the style, but nothing amazing. Taste and aroma are fairly one-dimensional, and not quite as robust as I would have hoped. A nice sipper that kind of runs middle of the road. Not bad at all... if I really needed an Oud Bruin and this one was available, I wouldn't turn it down. Plus the 11.2oz bottle is a convenient size."
"Pours a very dark brown that glows red when held to the light; the head is white and frothy but dissipates quickly, leaving a lot of lacing down the glass. The smell seaweed, leather, and persimmon. The taste is loam, pear skin, and salty, tangy sweat. It's finely but not too highly carbonated, rather thin in body, and is quite quenching -- perhaps I'd enjoy this beer better on a hot summer day. It's not the best I've had in the style, but still is a pleasant drink."
"Feel is thin, pronounced carbonation, but smooth and very drinkable. I was ready for another, but only picked up one."
"D: It's a good one...a nice version worth sipping for a while. I've seen more of these bottles recently at Whole Foods, so it's one I plan to snag again soon for another taste. Recommended."
"D: On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. I'm not that familiar with this style, but it does seem like an interesting one."
"not particularly complex to my experience, despite the wood barrel aging."
"Not too much in the nose, fruit, spices, and a slight vinegar. Taste is sweet red fruits up front followed by a tartness and lingering sweetness. Light on the spices in this one, but still pretty good."
"Overall: A terrific little Oud Bruin treat: definitely will have again! Try with duck, game, or good cheeses. Next time, I'll use this in my Carbonnade a la Flamande."
"I'm not a huge fan of oak aged brews and would not describe this as a typical wood aged beer as there are far to many other flavors which ring much more strongly."
"Boring. Slight head that dropped quickly. Minor ring around the glass. Brown in color, opaque. No smell on this one. Highly carbonated on the tongue, taste is lightly sweet, very small hint of a sour on this one, likely due to the barrel/oak. This is drinkable, but not something that is highly appealing. I'd rather have a duchess for something similar. So far I'm not impressed with this brewery. :|"
"Pretty drinkable beer. Although mild and not terribly complex, this is still a tasty beer. I definitely prefer Petrus Aged Pale, which is one of the beers blended to make this Oud Bruin."
"This is a great mild sour beer for those who are not into sours or who would like to experiment with sours. or those that are into sours this is a nice Flanders sour. It pours a nice brown with a slight, silky, tan head. It kind of looks like a Belgian Dubbel. It's a very tasty drink and worth a pour."
"D: at 5.5% abv this is almost sessionable; was my first beer of the evening and paired it with an appetizer. worked well in that capacity. I wanted to move on to my next beer but I was enjoying this one so much, particularly as it got warm, that I took my time."
"Clear brown pour with a short tan head. Caramel, oak, cherries, and funk in the nose. Sweet and sour bite with oak, malt, and green apples in the taste. Not a really bretty beer, more of a sour mash/sour fruit combo without the buttery sweetness. Sour and dry finish."
"The taste is sweet but sour, tangy, with earthy molasses elements, yeast, red wine, and fruit, almost like grape soda mixed with beer. It has a sweetish, slightly grainy finish. It's ok, but too sweet-sour for me."
"Pours a dark brown color with a thin fizzy beige head that quickly dissapears without any lacing.. Strong aroma of oaky wood, chocolate maltiness and dark fruit. Tart and very sweet tasting., with the oakinees dominating and overpowering the other flavors. More sour than I prefer."
"While there's a bit of tart sourness to it, there's a sweet burn aftertaste I did not find appealing. Almost like a beer version of sweet and sour. Thin, not particularly enjoyable."
"overall just a nice semi sour brown ale that is good to have everyonce in awhile"
"Pours a reddish brown with a decent sized off-white head from the bottle, some lacing is left in the glass. Nice aroma of caramel, dark fruit, and a bit of wood. Flavor begins with a rich sweetness followed by a slightly sour finish. Solid full mouthfeel, a nice beer."
"Not a bad beer but I wouldn't buy more."
"At this point in my beer adventure, I'm going to have to get more used to sour beers."
"ajh"
"D - Drinkability is good. This one is really smooth and refreshing for the style. Alcohol is very hard to detect. It hits some of the typical flavors I expected for a Flanders. Aged in oak for 20 months? I have my doubts about that since oak doesn't really come through at all. Still a good brew though."
"I thought this to be a very nice and drinkable beer for those who dig the sour. I would recommend it. I bought his bottle at Beer Mania in Brussels."
"Overall this is a solid beer of the style. I probably won't be buying this again anytime soon, but it's definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of the style."
"The drink is medium in body with fine carbonation and a fluffy feel. Quaffable."
"D: good drinkability. Overall a good example per style."
"My first Oud Bruin seems to sit within the style guidelines. Not a bad beer, but not one I find terribly interesting, either. Perhaps this is one of those styles that just doesn't work for me. I'm glad I tried it, and will try another of the style at some point, but I don't think I'll be re-upping for this beer anytime soon."
"The taste fits in well with the style but I feel that it falls far short from being an oak aged brew. There is a nice carbonation that works with the beer. Not bad but also not a great brew. I'll stick to the other beers in the Petrus lineup."
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As previously mentioned Petrus Oud Bruin has a dry finish. The body is medium on this one. Carbonation seems higher than it actually is. It is very delicate and has an unobtrusive prickliness to it-not scrubbing and not extremely sharp...instead delicate, tiny bubbles that are long lived when held in the mouth. This is one to pick up, definitely give this one a try if you are a fan of Belgian beer. This beer has turned me on to a style that I would've previously probably not even found. Easy to drink, nice delicate beer. Very refreshing, not really heavy, or even all that ""dark"" tasting. This is one I could drink all night."
"The malty flavor makes this pretty interesting."
"This is a VERY easy to drink beer. almost as easy as water. This is one of only a few beers I could honestly say I could down a 750 by myself easily, except they dont come that big :)"
"Drinkability: This beer had the same flavors over and over again. The one new flavor that was new was metallic rust and that's not good at all. For me, this beer could have used more sour fruits, a little bit more charred oak, increase the sourness a bit, and get rid of the rust. Where it stands, it's an OK lightly sour Belgian beer. It's not my favorite beer from Petrus."
"Pours a dark brown color with a rapidly diminishing head and a bit of aslo rapidly diminishing lacing. Very malty scent, not strong in any respect, and has a slight roasty aroma. Nice taste, slight malt and slight fruity/tart tastes, but every taste seems to go away and leaves no aftertaste at all. It is quite smooth."
"Very quafable, I wish I bought more than one bottle."
"sessionable, yes, for its low alcohol and thin body allow it. but would you?"
"A passive beer and a recommended starter to the Flanders style, easy to drink...wouldn't mind seeing it on tap or at a more reasonable price, but certainly not exceptional."
"Drinkability- Very smooth when drinking it down. If I were swilling it back than I may not have noticed the flaws so closely."
"This beer is a conundrum of inscrutable potentialities. A snorter, if you will. In fact, I would almost go so far as to label the entire Oud Bruin category as such. The smell leads you in one direction, and the taste in an entirely different one. This beer really is everything I'd expect of an Oud Bruin: it's tasty, interesting, and perplexing. If you're a fan of the style, I recommend you give it a try."
"11.2 oz bottle with no date, nice dark brown with no head and no carbonation. Aromas of glue on leather and cinnamon. The taste is not nearly as sour as I expected. This tasted like a brown ale with the slightest bit of tartness. Interesting overall."
"I had this beer after enjoying an Earthmonk. This one, while still a good beer, pales in comparison. It was served in an oversize wine glass. Medium brown in color with a small light brown head that left a little bit of lacing. Aroma was mostly dark fruit with a little bit of malt. I seemed to taste mostly cherries and caramel. Medium-bodied and pleasant."
"Worth trying at a tasting with a group to better understand how to describe this beer."
"A good beer to sip and enjoy, but one is good enough for me."
"D - On the mild side and slightly boring with a lot more fresh ale taste than other Oud Bruin's I have tried. Not much oak aroma/flavor for being in oak for 2 years."
"An easy drinker, but really too tame in character. The beer just needs a lot more of what it already has."
"Not bad, certainly unique."
"I tried this beer on October 27th after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a nice dark brown into the glass with a 1cm tannish head. The aroma is slightly sour with some nut hints. The mouthfeel is medium and sour to the tongue with some mild carbonation. The flavour is sour with some malt tones mixed in."
" Champagne like mouthfeel and character with subtle sour fruit tartness, faintly sweet and finishing abruptly dry. Like the Special, a nice pallete cleansing table beer or sour edged session ale, but sort of a watered down, mass produced example of a classic style."
"Drinkability is good and probably the strong point about this beer; it isn't offensive in any way."
"Drinkability: Smooth and light, I could drink a bunch of these in a night. Worth a try."
"Flavors of mildly acidic tartness, hay, and white grape/cherry juice. Sourness is downplayed, but the finish is moderately dry nonetheless. Mouthfeel is thin and flat, like a Flanders Oud Bruin flavored tea. A little disappointing given the attractive aroma and appearance. Taste seems to dull toward the end of the glass. Next round calls for something different."
"D - Alcohol is not a factor is this almost sessionable oud bruin. I was hoping for more from this Oud Bruin, especially after catching a whiff of its wonderful scent. It would be nice to try to again and see if I had an older and less fresh bottle. Worth trying if you like Oud Bruins, otherwise there are better choices out there for your first taste of this delicious and unique style."
"Finish has unpleasant sour funk. sour should be good, but is funky here."
"D - Hmmm... I was expecting much more from this. If it weren't for that sourness I've come to love so much, I would have scored it much lower. Perhaps Petrus brewed this beer intentionally this way - I feel like I need to consume a lot to get 'my money's worth'. In short, it's the Bud Light of the Flanders imo."
"Not impressed overall, but it is a beer that I would drink again on a hot day."
"Mouthfeel - Light-bodied and semi-crisp. Very refreshing and easy to drink."
"D= I like this beer a lot but I think I like Duchesse De Bourgogne more. Still, this is a damn tasty beer!"
"A bit wimpy for the style, but not bad. A bit too vinegary, though has a nice sweet and sour character."
"Not the greatest, might be a good intro to the style, offering some decent malt but none of the challenging aspects of a proper example of the style"
"This is actually not a bad Oud Bruin, just nothing spectacular. I'll admit that I was given this bottle a few months ago, thanks Joey, but since I wasn't into vinegar/sour tasting beers I decided to leave this one until I developed a taste for this type (and Red Poppy certainly did that for me!). This one would be a good introduction to the style, not too overpowering."
"Dark mohogany color with tan head. The nose was of earthy Belgian yeast and some mild malts. Not very impressed here. Closer to an English than a Belgian. Lots of dried fruits but very little tartness. Classic crisp but full Belgian feel. Drinkable, but not the best example of a wonderfull style."
"D: This is a solid oud bruin. Nothing spectacular, but worth drinking. Probably not worth the price tag, but it's still a good example of the style."
"Bottle conditioned and purchased from the Ontario alcohol monopoly. This one pours a dark oak colour with a quickly fading white head. Smells of lemon and blue cheese. This is quite promising - I find lemon and cheese pairs nicely. Taste upfront is moderately sour, but this is toned down by aggressive carbonation. As the drink flattens, the sour tone is enhanced, and the beer begins to resemble a red wine that has started to turn (but in a good way). The mouthfeel lets this drink down, as the carbonation is too intense and overpowers the flavour, so I found myself agitating my glass to draws some of it out."
"D: Good, not great. The balance is a little off IMO as the tartness isn't there. Nice to drink and easy at that but I was expecting more. A good introductory beer to the style though."
"Pours a dark amber with little to no head. Not much to the nose at first, a little more noticable sourness as it warms, a touch of vinegar. Let this beer warm up to the specified temps. Taste is of slightly sour cherries, minimal tartness. I was not expecting a Flanders style beer from this one. Not bad though, a good ""gateway beer"" for introducing people to the style."
"Decided to pick this up the other day as I do enjoy the brown ales. This one poured to a medium brown hue with a surprisingly smallish head that broke down very quickly and left hardly any lacing. The aroma shows a nice malt scent mixed with a slight sour character. The flavors have a little more character to it than the nose did, nice malt, some fruit like flavor, maybe some wood like flavors as well. What I really like is the sourness, which is persistent but in no way overwhelming, gives this brew a real nice flavor that mixes well with the other favors listed. While not having a very good sized head it seems to have ample carbonation. Overall this is a fine brew, lots of flavors going on that really come out in the taste. Very easy drinking."
"Not really my thing, to be honest. It's more drinkable than stuff like Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I don't much care for sour cherries and this has too much of them to warrant another purchase from me. If you like this sort of thing give it a shot; it seems to be a decent example of the style."
"This is the last from the 6-pack from Petrus. The ""aged pale"" is by far the winner."
"On Tap at the Trappist in Oakland, CA. Nice dark amber appearance, great head retention. Cool sour wet horse blanket notes on the aroma that are mostly in aroma, not so much in the actual taste. Pretty low carbonation for the style. Much sweeter in the finish than you would expect from the aroma. Nice complexity when you want a balance of sweet/sour. Great complexity of flavors considering the alcohol content. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Though not a favorite style for me, I thought it was very good. I think serving it with a platter of cheeses in the spring/summer would be a great presentation."
"Quite drinkable with the alcohol hardly detectable. A nice sour beer that's sessionable, for sure."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It is very refreshing and full of complex flavors. I highly recommend it."
"Great tasting brew. Alongside of Goudenband this one is more mild. I enjoyed both of them tremendously and would revisit this one as well."
"Drinkability : bonne bière dans le style oud bruin (brune des Flandres)"
"pours like a Coke in colour, fizz and head. has a bakery smell of yeast, cinnamon and butter. Mmmm it tastes delicious but has a sour middle. i'm not sure about this one. I need another taste.yep this is very good, ginger and cinnamon. A good winter beer. I will buy this again if the LCBO keeps carrying it."
"D - Intense yet quaffable and complex w/ nice balance. I found this to a very fine brown w/ high drinkability."
"When poured from the bottle to my belgian glass, the beer displayed a clear brown color with hints of ruby. The head was tan. The aroma was sour with hints of grape. The one word I can think to describe it is ""fresh"". The flavor was very balanced. The light body character gave it a dry perception in my mouth. There was a definate grainy/cereal flavor. I feel like, in my opinion, this was a good example of an Old Bruin. I reviewed this beer with a side-by-side comparison to Liefmans Old Bruin and I lean towards Liefmans in preference."
"[postscript -- funny, I really didn't look much at the other reviews before writing -- purely by coincidence, I gave this beer the same breakdown as the reviewer before me. strange.]"
"Tastes of sour fruits, a bit wine like and some spices. Very refreshing and has a great mouthfeel."
"D: A very good Oud Bruin, though I haven't had many of the style. Not the most robust, funky sour ale nonetheless, but easy to drink, even though it is kind of pricey at about $3.50 a bottle at Hi-Times."
"Dark brown colour that looks almost black at some angles but has burgundy red edges where a bright light glows on the other side of the glass. One finger light brown head, bubbles disappated quickly but the surface remained wispy with good lacing. A swirl regenerated the head but little by way of visible carbonation. Smells of dates, figs, molasses, vanilla. The taste is sweet and sour, fruit cake, malt, tempered bitterness, nicely balanced. There is a rich mouthfeel that had a very smooth texture and a gentle finish of stewed apples and prunes. There was a degree of complexity here that I quite liked, I'll grab another of these next trip to the LCBO."
"I've got 1-2 more to try from Petrus, but this one is definitely a notch above the rest. It's no Westvleteren 8, or even close to the other Trappist dubbels, but it's no slouch."
"Drinkability - This is my first Flanders Old Bruin, so I don't know if this is good or not, so I'm just rating it average by default for drinkability."
"D- Not very drinkable because of the immensity of the sour melded with the sweet malt. It's a strange flavor."
"Maybe I'm being unfair. I was looking forward to this brew and it didn't live up to my expectations. Buy one thinking it's going to be horrible and maybe you'll like it. It wasn't bad, but it's a bit mellow."
"Overall: Occasionally, along comes a brew that seems to be one thing but is quite another. This is one of those beers; looking at the label, one might expect an oak aged dubbel or brown ale, but instead you have what amounts to a Flanders sour ale. If youre not familiar with the Oud Bruin style, you will be surprised. Actually as I have learned, the Oud Bruin style is a brown, not red Flanders ale, a slight distinction that makes more sense once you actually taste the beer. Once you figure out what youre drinking (I was seriously thrown a curve by the tartness), you can enjoy this brew. My suggestion is to serve it cool, not cold; its complexities really dont unravel until it warms even further than the suggested 50F. Otherwise, its a pretty decent sour ale, though too pricy for regular enjoyment."
"D-I am digging this beer. I have no frame of reference for the style but it is one I will continue to explore when i can. This is a unique offering, one in which you cannot judge the book by it's colour. Definitely let this one warm up, I changed my rating from a 3.5 in taste to 4 as it warmed."
"This beer had a brown/copper color with a thick head  light lacing and quickly dissipating. The aroma is sour and malty. The taste is fruity and sour. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Overall, I can say that this is a fairly drinkable beer  it is the first Ive had of this style and cannot comment on whether it is representative or not."
"The bottled variety seemed less metalic, but there was still a metalic aftertaste. I tried the bottle version as it specifically said ""oak aged"""
"D- This was interesting and very different. I'd order it again. Sweet and sour but not as intense as a fruit lambic."
"Inoffensive beer but it just tastes saccharine to me. I was expecting a nice tart refreshing brew but I got a fountain drink."
"Pours a very deep brownish color into a newer Petrus glass (I like the new ones better!), with a tan head. It has the aroma of sweet malt, and the taste has a dark fruit, cherries and a very nice tartness that lingers a bit after. A good beer to enjoy with a dessert."
"D: Lacking sweet malt character. I am not particularly familiar with this style so take this review with a grain of salt. Sour ales to me are not inherently sessionable. But to each their own. There is some confusion on this site as to what style beer this is and I think that it is also listed as a Belgian dark ale."
"D: I could definetly drink a few of these throughout the night (or day)."
"This will my first time trying an example of this style. I am not too big of a fan sour beers, but I still wanted to try the style. It poured into a small sampler glass a chestnut brown complexion, with a 2 finger white heading that faded into a small lacing. In the aroma was a soft sour presence, with hints of vinegar, cherries, grass, and other juicy fruits. Taste starts off a little sour, but quickly becomes sweet, then ends off with a very sweet caramel flavor. Specific flavors were apple, brown sugar and chocolate. Mouthfeel was light bodied. I could have a few of these in a sitting. I am glad I tried this style. Not too sour, not too sweet. Just good all around."
"Body is rather light, adding to the amazing drinkability. A great refresher, and a great intro into sour beers for the uninitiated."
"Overall: I was expecting a beer with more flavor especially considering the style. I wouldn't turn one down but it's nothing to go out of your way for."
"Overall I like it."
"Not a beer I would seek out..just bought it out of curiosity."
"Flavor is tart cherries backed by a dose of cider vinegar. Touch of pepper and oak on the finish."
"-Oelergud"
"One of the most disappointing, but not worst, beers I have ever tasted."
"Russet copper body is mostly clear. Topped by a small, frothy, light khaki head. Nose is a complex mix of brown sugar, molasses, vinegar, pepper, sour cherries, marshmallows, and vegetable matter. Taste starts off with tart, slightly bitter citrus peel. Toasted, slightly biscuity malts ensue, with some definite sour cherries. A hint of metal, oak, and smoke in an otherwise acidic, mildly tart, vinegary finish. Moderate to light bodied ale with zesty carbonation. I haven't had many examples of this style, but this seems like a good iteration. Not quite as vinegary or sour as a Flanders red ale, but still quirky and interesting."
"Still an excellent beer."
"Nothing really incredible or remarkable here. Glad I tried it. Didn't hate it. Ready to move on. Next."
"33 cL bottle with no freshness date, brought home from the Capital Ale House in Richmond. It pours a lightly hazy rusty/copper that thins at the bottom of the flute, and it has medium carbonation that leads up to an inch of tan head that never fully recedes and leaves nice sheets of lacing. The bouquet is sweet and tart/sour with hints of oak and mustiness. It isn't as tart on the palate as the aroma led me to believe, but it has some sourness with notes of sweet malts, leafy/green hops, and hints of red berries. The body is light at first, but becomes medium, with tingly carbonation, dryness from the tannins, and a medium to light finish. Not too bad, but as far as sour ales go, it is quite mellow - I wish it had more sourness on the palate, and that it were more robust in aroma and flavor."
"I think this is my first experience with this style, and I must say it's interesting. The dark, almost stout-like appearance through me for a loop, as I was expecting something more along the line of a traditional brown ale. The head was thick and just slightly off-white, as if a hint of gray was desperately trying to be noticed. A sweet, fruity aroma with a hint of malt awakened my nose as I leaned forward to sniff the brew. The tartness of bright cherries make me take serious notice as the first sip rested on my tongue. This is unlike any beer I've ever tasted, and I think I like it! So different, yet so delightful. I also appreciate the smooth, creamy texture, and the way the flavor lingers for quite some time. Sour beer, eh? I'll have to investigate more of this style."
"This is a good sour if you're not wanting to really get the pucker of a Flanders Red."
"Cheers!"
"Beef Notes: Sometimes I crave a sour beer like this and when I did, I used to go to Duchese. I think I'll be going the way of Petrus now."
"Enjoyable, not extraordinary, though one of the most drinkable of the sour Belgian ales. Easy to like, and probably a good one to recommend to someone just starting out with the sour spectrum of Belgium's beers. Only big complaint is the bottle size. 8.4 oz.? It ain't quantity over quality, I know, but just when you're getting into the beer, it's over. This is a quality beer, and I want a few more ounces of it."
"D - Great, this is a very drinkable sour beer, lacks the vomitesque nature of some of its cousins. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"And EXCELLENT beer."
"False."
"D - Easy drinking and accessible. Could be more flavourful though."
"Pours a clear, dark burgundy with no head, save or a tiny ring around the surface. Smells of cherries and wood, with hints of apple. Starts out sour in the taste, mellows out to a light syrupy sweetness and finishes with some more cherry sourness. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Very tasty and easy to drink, yet full of complexities."
"This one will pull ya a few different ways. Does it blend together nicely? Yes. It had my interest from start to finish. That warrants a future purchase at a minimum."
"5.) I would love to revisit you often, but you are an expensive date. Also, you can give me heartburn in too large of doses. But like they say, you've never felt hurt til you've felt love."
"Drinks pretty good, the tartness & dryness make we want to drink at least one more...Definitely one of those beers that made me love my visits in BE, very funky & out of the norm"
"Opinion: I think that this beer is pretty good. I guess that it is a Flanders Brown, and it fits that category pretty well. It comes across as a tad thin, but that enhances its drinkability. I like the sweet and sour contrast, and the fact that this beer has some age on it doesnt detract from the whole flavor profile. I was really careful not to pour the sediment from the bottom as there is quite a bit. This would have likely detracted since it has some age on it. All in all, I think that this was a pretty darn good beer, and one that I would like to try again as a fresher example."
"Overall, it was alright. Not an easy one to keep drinking, but a good novelty beer to have every now and then."
"D: I really enjoyed this one. A nice after dinner treat beer."
"This is a Petrus that I could drink a few of. I am starting to like the bitter/sour beers the Petrus put out."
"From the label: Old brown ale aged in oak casks for 2 years."" The oak shows and is counterbalanced nicely by the tart fruit."
"Cola colored- white head  faint nose of sour raspberries, maple syrup, green vegetation and mold  taste is initially malt then sour raspberries as one swallows, medium body  aftertaste short Cola colored- white head  faint nose of sour raspberries, maple syrup, green vegetation and mold  taste is initially malt then sour raspberries as one swallows, medium body  aftertaste short"
"Enjoyed on tap at Bryant Lake Bowl in Minneapolis."
"My first Oud Bruin, so I can't compare to others, but I'll look into the style more, though they are not very easy to come by."
"Some mouthfulls are better than others with this beer. None of the mouthfulls are really bad, but I wouldn't rate many as great. First beer of the style for me, I'd like to see more."
"I dont seem to taste the oak.. oh well."
"Overall Impression: Well crafted, aged, and balanced. The tart/sourness is balanced with the sweetness, hop flavor, oak, bitterness and the dryness. Definably worth trying. Great Oud Bruin!!"
"This is a good beer to initiate someone into Oud Bruins, but lacks the depth or complexity that I look for in the style. Quite light in body. Goudenband and Duchesse are better for sure, but this is an easy to drink example. Simple, clean, not bad."
"Tase is a light medley vinous fruit, cherry cordial, and green apple all pulled down by darker fruit tastes, slight anise, and a taste that sort of reminds me of finnel. Despite the flavors described this is a very light, smooth, easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is slick but light. I feel like having this beer without pairing it with some crazy food was a waste. It is a great one for the table, complex but easy-going."
"D: interesting. enjoyable. worth a shot for sure...dont know about much after that."
"I don't think I would drink this again unless it's from the brewery."
"Overall, a beer that I much enjoyed, most of all for the aroma. And it was a serious steal when I was visiting Louisville at $2.25."
"This beer is a steal @ BJ's for only $3.95 / bottle."
"A fantastic beer, Rich and aromatic, very pleasing for speacial occasions."
"Anyway, mouthfeel is light and refreshing, although nothing special. Aftertaste is pleasantly fruity without being overpowering."
"Taste; The oak flavors come out more than the aroma led me to believe they would. There's a nice sour fruitiness, with cherries, plums and maybe a touch of raspberries. It's a bit drying in the finish due to the oak barrel aging. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and is pretty easy to drink, even with the dryness."
"Im still on the fence with this one. Its a simple sour beer, but then theres that metallic finish. Its not my favorite, but I didnt have any trouble finishing it."
"I thought this was an amazing beer. For my first Oud Bruin Im impressed an look foward to trying more in this style."
"Drinkability? Hm. Of course, liking the beer helps this category. So, I have to vote low since it didnt go down easy."
"Pours a great darkened brown hue into the signature Petrus goblet, notes of translucent ruby red at the base of the glass. Makes a tanned creamy colored half inch crown that fades into a thin layer of long lasting finely packed bubbles. Funky tart barnyard aromas, sour cherries, slightly vinegary. Malty caramel and bittersweet chocolate, almost soured chocolate flavors with a subtle hint of tart lemony citrus, and spices, but is almost metallic in the finish. Light to medium palate, very crisp & strong peppery carbonation with a very dry finish. Looks good, smells good and feels good on the palate, but the flavor is a let down compared to the nose. Tasty, but doesn't leave me wanting more."
"Pours a dark amber color with a foamy head leaving a little bit of sticky lacing. Smells funky. Sour, overripe fruit: apples, pears, plums and grapes. Taste is pretty good, sour fruit, wood, and even a cola like flavor mixed in there as well. Light body, moderate carbonation, very dry. Cloyingly dry in the finish which really hurts this, it could be much better otherwise."
"Pours a deep clear copper color with a finger width light-tan cap that dissipated to thin lacings along surface. Malty sweet aroma with sour esters, raisins, brown sugar and spice. Alcohol is in the nose. Nice rich bouquet. The flavor almost transforms through noticeably different flavors. Flavor is brown sugar sweetness turning into sour cherry then brightens to a ripe fruit with hint of a banana finish. Bitterness is very mellow. Woodsy throughout. It has medium-light body with medium carbonation and finishes with a earthy-oak dryness. Very intriguing beer that can be enjoyably sipped and savored. This is my first experience with a sour ale, but will definitely be on the lookout for more like this."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"The beer makes good its escape pouring a deep clear brown, the head is bountiful, creamy in texture and a winsome light tan in color, upon its dematerialization, the lace formed is a tight seal upon the glass. Nose is musty, with hints of molasses, malt and a bit of citrus like tartness; start is mild in sweetness, fair to middling grain presence, and the top light to moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is sternly acidic, tart, quite dry and a magnificent beer."
"A light and pleasingly quenching drink. Somewhere between the belgian brown ale and sour red ale styles."
"a deep brown color, with creamy head. smells of malty chocolate and raisins; mellow and calm. rich but mellow, rather neutral flavors for the most part were a slight disappointment. very smooth. I was expecting more flavors; maybe I've had too many American IPA's to appreciate this subtle beer."
"The color is a reddish brown, very clear but dark. There is a decent head of foam that quickly reduces to a thick ring around the inside of the glass. I can immediately smell the storng fruity aroma of red wine after pouring. The taste is very fruity and tangy, like cherries or raisins. The sourness lingers a bit, but there is virtually no bitterness at all. This one reminds me of Kriek beer. Its quite thin and adequately bubbly on the palate. The overall drinkablility is suprisingly good."
"Despite the sourness and acidity, this is a smooth, easy to drink beer."
"Pours to a nice dark brown with a thin head with lots of lacing. Smell is a bit acidic, but not too offensive. Taste is quite acidic, flavors somewhat resemble malt and wine. mouthfeel is decent, no excessive carbonation and pretty easy to drink. This isn't too bad, would be better if it was not so acidic though."
"I think one of these is enough; not that there's a high ABV but the overwhelming tastes of the sour fruits and alcohol, combined with a puckering dry mouthfeel makes this a one a night beer."
"This brew pours a dark mahogany color with a billowing white head. The aroma tart and sour, but rather mild. The taste is also rather mild. There is some sourness, but really nothing else. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this beer is okay. However, I do not think I will drink it again."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew, and certainly a style I'd like to try again, but I was hoping for more with this guy."
"This brew was a pleasant surprise as I had never heard of it or tried anything in this style. If you come across it and want to try something new, I would highly recommend it."
"Wow!! I had no clue what to expect with this one. I had always wanted to try it out and just now got around to it. It poured a red/bronze/brown colour with about an inch and a half thick head of tightly knit off white foam. The smell is a dry tart like smell, if that makes any sense. Very sour and musty. The taste, too. In fact, this thing reminds me alot of a lambic or a saison. The mouth feel was very smooth and very easy to drink, finishing with a bit of a dryness. This brew is just all around good, if you're a fan of lambics and saisons and such."
"D: Very drinkable. Especially considering the style."
"My first Oud Bruin. Poured out to a hazy brown / amber red color with a short lived head and some lacing inside the glass. Medium high carbonation. Aroma of vinegar, dark fruits and flat malt are unobtrusive to the drinker. Taste was slightly bland and flat. Flavors of malt are weak and distant; sourness is present but noticeable degraded, likely to the ageing of the beer. Mouthfeel was soft and watery, but not undesireable considering the other aspects and qualities of this brew. Average drinkability, as this brew is not bad, but I don't really think it's got a whole lot to offer. I may not be revisiting this brew soon, but that doesn't make it bad. Worthy of a sampling."
"Drinkability: I like it. I like Goudenband better, but this is still good, not as big, but easier to drink."
"Very nice. Enjoy, please."
"No complaints about the mouthfeel, that I can recall. Fairly low carbonation, perfectly agreeable. Same for drinkability; overall, a great beer. Not one to be taken lightly or rushed, but it rewards a pensive consumption."
"D-I don't know if the long aging process really mellowed this beer but there is not a lot of complexity. I believe most Flanders browns are not usually aged in oak but it makes this one very smooth and drinkable. However a lot of the malt profile is just not there."
"Drinkability: Not overly sour, but has enough of a sour kick to provide an introduction to the style"
"The mouthfeel is a little less than medium, but it works with the citric flavors. Quite drinkable, especially during this Summer's never ending heat."
"Thin off-white foamy head atop a dark reddish brown beer. Vinous aroma along with dark cherries, sour and chocolate notes. Generally tasted of grapes, and perhaps blasamic vinegar. Dark cherry juice flavor as well. This beer was light in the mouth, but refreshing. A very good beer."
"It pours a nice ruby-infused brown color with a very light coating over the brew. The nose is nice. Sour cherries, light woody tannin, light creamyness. Very nice. The flavor is disappointing. Where is the sour? Where is the flavor in general. It is rather bland. I get a very light cherry and a light sour, but it just lacks the kick I want. Boo. The feel is a light moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, I wish this had a better flavor. The nose just teases me with anticipation that the flavor never delivers."
"Pours a rubied brown color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sour with some fruit tones and a little sweet. Maybe a touch of vegetable. The flavor is odd. Not what I expect from an old brown. The sour really isn't there. Little bit of sweetness and hints of fruit, but I get a lot of the vegetable character. It doesn't taste bad, but it's not what I want to taste. The body is moderate and the drinkability is ok."
"Drinkability- Worth a try if you can find it for a reasonable price. $3.50 was a bit steep when I can get the Duchesse for $2.99. Still, not bad."
"Pours brownish red, with virtually no head but a little bit of lace. Smells sour, but with a malty sweet aroma? Doesn't make sense but thats what I smelled. Taste is sweet malt, with a sour middle thats not overpowering. Body is rather full with good carbonation, a pretty decent beer although not really my style. Thanks DrJay."
"Pours a deep, mud brown colour with a decent enough head. I'd estimate 7/10 of foam, with whisps of lace here and their. The smell is sweet, malty, and a bit cheesy. I'm assuming from the yeast. The taste is simply too cheesy for me. Is the yeast strain okay? It reminds me of Velveeta. I don't like it. Asides from that, their is a definite sweet and sour taste. Malty, with a bittering, earthy and cheesy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and weak. Drinkable? Perhaps, if you like cheese. If not, I wouldn't bother trying this beer. The other two Petrus products I've had were considerably better."
"The smell is malty and somewhat sour. Bits of oak come through. The taste is also a bit sour. Malts also come through strong up front but seem to fall apart, bringing up a thin body. The drinkability is decent."
"Drinkability  Goes down pretty easy for a Belgian, interesting, complex and smooth. This would be a good stepping stone for someone who like the normal Trappist fare and wanted to move towards Lambics, it is sour but not overwhelmingly so. This is my first Oud Bruin and I enjoyed it, but not enough to go out of my way to find others."
"Mouthfeel is rather thin and crisp. Rolls over the palate nicely with good carbonation. This 8.4oz bottle is a tease...I could easily go for a 750 of this stuff. Incredibly drinkable and tasty. I will be seeking this one out again. Recommended."
"Like chopping wood this cream hairy beer fills your head with scents of old sap, fresh fungus, ginger root and decay. Citrus zest and vanilla escort a tart and fizzy mouthful down. A bit weighty, particularly when compared to its stronger sibling the Aged Pale but tasty nonetheless."
"Happy to get to sample this brew on tap at the Collins bar in NYC. Pours dark brown, with ruby hues on the edges. The nose was quite malty, with also a hint of must. Carboantion seems low, with a very slight head developed and limited lacing. Malt sweetness up front initially, then mid way lactic sourness picked up. Also a hint of cherry and vanilla. Not much yeast or hops characteristics involved in the mix. Basically a malty belgian with a sour undertone. Eh, not really for me, I'd classify this one as a middle of the road Belgian, worth a try but not of much more interest."
"Don't let the ""brown"" in the name fool you (as it is sometimes listed as Petrus Brown). The nose has an amazing blend of soft malt hints and big musty earth hits. The mouth-feel is active but not over-powering. The taste is tart and bold but balanced enough not to be one-noted. The yeast is wild, complex and inviting... The finish is simple enough to have you going back for more. Not for everyone...but definitely for me..."
"250 mL brown bottle with best before date printed clearly on the front label."
"There's no question that Old Brown grew on me from first sip to last. However, it wasn't quite able to win me over by the end. My expectations were probably both high and misplaced (it's much more delicate and subtle than anticipated), but, even so, I think that I've given it a fair shake. It was interesting and was enjoyable for the most part, but it probably isn't a beer that I'll look for again."
"poured with a big light coffe colored head that fades to a skim covering a deep brown red body that is clear around the edges and hazy/murky in the middle. soft sourness with of a vinious quality in the aroma. weel carbonated witha average mouthfeel. carbonation sleanse nicely against the mild soury tart flavors and then seems to explode in your mouth with a release of flavor. sour chaacter seems good although a bit restrained for me, still worth a shot if you have never tried oud bruin's before."
"Pours a medium brown, relatively clear, with a minor off-white head that quickly collapses. Ruby notes against the light. Aroma- sour, malty, slightly sweet, fresh brown ale. Raisins? Flavor: sharp off notes that I can't place, but it wasn't pleasant. It has the slightly sour flavor that I love in some other oud bruins and similar beers, but here is jsut isn't right. Can't recommend this one."
"An interesting beer to say the least. As suggested in the title, this beer is brown. Very brown, with no head. Barely see-through. The smell is very reminiscent of wine or grapejuice, and not very reminiscent of beer. Tastes very grapey, very very grapey. There's a bit of malt noticable, but it really isn't very prominent and I don't taste the hops in there at all. Seems to be a slight alcohol taste, not in a bad way, though I didn't know this beer was only %5.5 ABV. Hmmm. Very watery and light mouthfeel. This beer definately challenges my definition of beer and my impression of what a beer should be. There really are a vast array of styles out there, and this one is pretty new to me. Definately expanded my beer palate with this one, but I'm not sure I really liked this beer very much."
"Poured a dark brownish red, with a flufffy cream head, good retention and beautiful rings of lacing. Aroma reminiscent of red wine, berries and very tart. Taste was sour, with hints of berries, malty sweetness mid sip and ends dry. Creamy mouthfeel, and quite drinkable. Sour, but not to the point where it makes you cringe."
"Pours an opaque brown with a thick off-white slightly orange head the laces wonderfully, rather effervescent. Aroma of wild yeasts and some citrus, this is going to be sour! :) Taste was a refreshingly tart with a nice slightly hoppy finish. Not nearly as sour as I thought it was going to be, and has a nice light mouthfeel. This is new style for me and I was very pleasently surprised. I'd drink this all night if I had more."
"I'll be buying this again, and serving it to friends."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with Belgian ale yeast. It is very refreshing and fruity. You can smell hints of the oak barrels. The taste is great. It has a very refreshingly fruity malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes yeasty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good drinking brown ale. It has everything."
"Pours a deep amber color with a big foamy off white head leaving nice wisps of lace. the aroma is tart and floral with some sweet malt and vinagery notes. The taste is a rich and complex mix of malt notes and oaky tartness. Theres some iron, tannins and citrus as well. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick. This is a very interesting and crisp beer. Its not as sour as Rodenbach but its still really good."
"Lasting and slightly brownish head on a very dark mahogany color that looks ruby against the light. The first impression in the smell is of vinegar, but a bit soft, maybe more like balsamic vinegar. The tartness is not overwhelming and rather combined with some light citric notes. Hints of caramel too. The taste confirms this first perception. Oud bruin it is, but somehow subdued or attenuated. The winy oaky tart aspect doesnt punch you in the face, it kisses you on the lips. The finish is a bit sharper, but still very balanced. Some biscuity and even chocolaty notes appear. Maybe a hint of sweet fried plantain at one point, with a candy like sweetness. The light soda taste reminds me a Belgian stout. Hops get noticeable if you think about them, adding some thickness, but no strong bitterness. The body is quite consistent for the style, enjoyably round. I could have enjoyed more than this 25cl bottle."
"I've heard some nice things about Petrus so it's about time that I've finally tried one. To say that it was interesting would be an understatement. I made the mistake of pouring this beer way to cold (i am guessing around 38 - 40 degrees). Even so it poured a flat brown with absolutely no head. I've never seen anything like this before, there were even no bubbles around the edge. Smell was slightly tart, I struggled to pick up any other details. Initial taste was what a suspected a slight tartness surrounded by a sweet nutty maltiness. Very refreshing. Mouthfeel was a tad bit stale, but overall this was a very interesting beer which I'll try again. If only I could get my hands on their pale."
"Pours out a dark amber nearly brown ale with a creamy loking dark beige head. The aroma of sour fruit and spices rise up from the glass. The sour characteristic jumps all over your mouth at the start of the taste followed by a nice smooth sweet lightly malty finish. The sourness is the only reason for the lower drinkability score."
"8.4 oz bottle picked up from Riverside as part of a mixed sixer. The appearance is that of a standard brown ale, a ruby-tinged, translucent brown. The head and retention is decent, although it eventually recedes into nothing. The smell is very nice, vinous and sour, hints of brandy and cherry juice, and oak.yes, oak. Wow, this beer is not what I expected it all, it almost has the tartness of a lambic. Its nice and tart, with a sour cherry taste, accompanied by a bit of an earthy flavor. The finish is a sprinkling of a dull, spicy hop and woodiness. The mouthfeel is light and slick with very subtle carbonation. I enjoy these particular flavors a lot in beer so Im a fan of this one. Ill definitely pick it up again."
"Very good beer. I would describe this as a session sour beer. A bit of sourness but not an incredible amount. Tends to be watery in the mouthfeel, but not too bad. Flavorful. Came with a nice head and a lasting lace. Again, this would make a great session beer."
"I could see drinking a few of these with a somewhat hearty sausage centered meal. Actually, I did just that."
"This brew poured a deep dark brown color with only the slightest mahogony hue. A thin white head forms and leaves only a tiny lace. Aromas are very wine like, with a tart overtone, and a cherry finish that is quite apparant. Flavors to this brew to me, are quite similiar to a Flemish Red Sour ale. Initially there is a burst of sweet vinous grapes and cherries with just a tiny hint of tannins. Following this brew takes a turn towards being decently pungent, tart, and sour, with a slight oak tone in the mix, and a hint of vanilla. The finish is somewhat sweet, with a slight spice, a bit of malt, a strong grape like flavor and a slight sourness right at the end. There is also a warm finishing alcohol tone. Overall this brew is quite complex, quite smooth, and at the same time has a nice zinging carbonation. Definetly a nice try if you can find it."
"Pretty drinkable really. Dry enough to never be cloying, yet flavorful enough to keep you interested."
"Pours out a brownish red with a small amount of carbonation. Smell was surprisingly non-descript. I really couldn't make out any discernable aromas other than malt. Taste was almost non-existent, extremely dissapointing. I'm hoping I just got a ""runt of the litter""; I could hardly get through this one.."
"Not a big fan of the style, but this beer has some interesting facets. Good mouthfeel and an evolving taste."
"Bought in a ""gift pack""...3 Petrus brews plus trappiste tulip glass...pour reveals a slightly cloudy deep red-brown...aromas are articulated...cherry-grape-raisin and a slight alcohol wisp...Starts creamy right off..the body is remarkably clean (not viscous) for such a strong smelling/ tasting ale..it runs the gamut...grapes, cherries, raisins..some toffee and all in balance with this incredible souring that is not overly pronounced...not sweet not sour...lovely fruit tastes and a great finish of sweet/sour fruits with a nice smoky oak finish.., a nice specialty drink from Belgium."
"I passed on pouring it into tulip stemware and used my small Hoegaarden glass instead. In doing so I managed to get a beautiful large off-white head on the pour, thick and creamy, very dense. It leaves a decent sized cap all the way down the glass, and a fair amount of sticky lacing. The body is a deep murky walnut colour, but when held up to direct light it transforms into a stunning clear cherry oak hue, an absolutely enchanting work of alchemy. Sour cherry immdeiately hits me from the aroma, dates and currents and a vinuous quality to it. Malty dried fruit appear first in the flavour, but is soon overtaken by an undercurrent of sour cherry all the way to the finish, where a more black current flavour rounds out on the aftertaste, rounding the edges of the sharp acidity. Light creamy mouthfeel, but the jaggedness of the acidity doesn't appeal to me that much, I can now see how a wine glass may be more ideal to serve this in for more than one reason. Would make a lovely after dinner drink, but I couldn't see having more than one in any sitting. Even the 250 ml serving seems a little much for me. I could be content to hold the glass up to the light and gaze at it all day, and slowly work on it."
"Overall an easy to approach take on the oud bruin. While it lacks the overall complexity of the best examples of the style it still does a palate good."
"This was a dark reddish brown beer with very little head. The head that did apear dissipated quickly. The smells of red wine and cider stood out. The flavor was sweet and malty but not very flavorful. The oak barrel aging was evident. It was very smooth and easy to drink. All in all it is a good beer. It's just not as complex or interesting as I had been hoping for."
"Interesting beer to sip and review. Just what I imagined it to be from reading about these oddball beers. Not really sure what to drink it with or when to drink it."
"1.75 years later, lots of lace. Well malted and balanced cherry pie, easy drink. One standard deviation in complexity."
"Clear ruby brown body with a sticky off-white head. Aroma is balsamic with almost no barrel character though which annoys me when you display them on the label. Bready, yeasty. Taste is a little bland, very short aftertaste, restrained sourness and a little empty. I came close to writing plastic also, but that's pushing it far. Bitter finish, medium body, creamy and biting, too much actually. This may be the only unremarkable beer of the day, but trust me that you're in for something with their aged pale!"
"The mouthfeel was crisp and the caramel and mild sour tones lasted long after swallowing. This was medium bodied and the most drinkable bruin I have had (especially since this was on tap). Exciting until the last drop."
"25 cl bottle. Oud Bruin on bottle. Best before 17/06/04."
"style."
"Sour apples in the aroma. A nice fruitiness and some sour malt vinegar. The taste is refreshingly tart, but not overdone or puckering. Detect various things in this beer  cherry fruit, some caramel malt sweetness and a subtle nutty texture. The body is thin and light, but remains flavorful. A bit of a sour bitter finish. Pleasant and enjoyable."
"Lightly acidic, with a sweet malt center, and a bit of rustic fruit. Finishes off dry, with a refreshing sour twang that lingers & begs you to take another sip. Light body, robust carbonation."
"A dark amber with a thin tan head. It has a nice smell of raisans or grape tannin. The taste is very mellow with strong hints of wine, fruit (grapes and cherries), and fired malt. The finish has a fruity tartness to, but again it's very subtle. It gives hints of both a barley wine and a dopple bock, but doesn't go either direction. It has a light oily feel to it. A very interesting beer, I think I will have to try this again just to further explore the many tastes it gives. It seems every drink brings out a little of something else. The light tastes and low alcohol (5.5% ABV per the bottle) make it something you could drink several of."
"Poured a dark red brew with a nice head. Aroma of cherry (probably from coming from the oak) with acidic taste. Body is a bit light and no complexity. I would have appreciated a bit more spice or aftertaste. Overall, this is a very average oud brun and I won't be seeking this one anytime soon."
"Drinkablilty: better than the Triple and Speciale. not bad."
"When poured it showed a medium amber brown with very little foam. The smell of a spicy hop filled my nose which was the tops of this beer. The taste was of a tart sour beer that had be aged to long and saw the sink drain before the first sip settled on my palate. Blah, what an awful beer to put on the market. One on my 10 most awful beers on my list!"
"This beer is amazing. I want more."
"Too sour for my liking and too close in character to a cider. Not something I'd share with my friends."
"Mouthfeel has a syrupy cling as well which seems to be it's only drawback IMHO."
"Rich coppery-brown color with fluffy light tan head. Globule yeast cloud left in suspension. Tart and sour aromas mixed with a bit of not-fully-ripened bing cherry. Almost like opening a big bag of ""Sour Patch Kids"" at the movie theatre. Sweet, malty and a touch sour in the taste. The faintest taste of a mineral based water in there, too. The aroma's definitely bigger on the sour note than the taste. Oak barrel aging is most prevalent. Oak is pourous and allows oxygen to pass through which ""in essence"" adversely affects beer in a negatively way. It subsequentially creates lactic acid, which could be a serious off-flavor in most beers, but a Flemish Brown/Red is supposed to be this way. This example is a close-to-perfect style of this beer. I've enjoyed this beer on draft, but I feel the bottle has a slight edge. Very fine brew."
"Hazy garnet hue. Thin, but persistent light beige head leaves lace. Waft of lacto fermented prune juice like tartness hits the nose upfront. Acidity tapers quickly in aroma, yielding to a mellow suggestion of molasses sweetened pear cider and trace notes of tannic oak. Pleasant, but a touch one dimensional aromawise. Snap of acetic tartness initially in flavor softens abruptly, and couples with caramelized, dark candi sugar sweetness to lend a gentle, sweetsour citric character. Understated notes of dry cocoa and raisin surface mid palate, bolstering malt and fruit character, respectively. Lightly bodied overall, but sufficiently dextrinous in mouthfeel to lend an agreeably soft mouthfeel. Finishes slightly savory, with fleeting notes of wood and salt. A relatively simple, but enjoyable old brown. Shallow in acidity, but refreshing and light on the palate. Quite a tasty brew."
"Appearance: Very red, slight head, clear. Aroma: Intensely sour wood aromatics some malt sweetness. Flavor: Very sweet tasting. Woody sourness apparent in aroma is oddly very lacking in flavor-a surprise, and a big dissappointment. Finish: Blandly sweet finish."
"Drinkability  Ill stick with the Aged Ale."
"This is OK but could be a bit more flavorful."
"Possible over the hill bottle. Dark brown color, small head, vinous aroma. Full flavored brown ale, some oak character. Deep malt flavor. Very mild and smooth taste. Mouthfeel is a little thin, expected it to be fuller from the taste. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is vinous and a little malty. Note: There was a lot of soild yucky looking sediments in the bottom of the glass. Old beer or natural for this beer? Need to retaste."
"This beer was light bodied, had no nose and had a slightly nutty flavor. I'd recommend looking at reviews for others in this style, if you're interested in trying it."
"This beer is a murky brown to amber in color. Topped by a thin wispy head. Smells tart and vinuous. The first impression is that this beer is lightly sour, not as much as I was expecting from this beer. A fairly dry beer as well. At first, when cold, there is not too much flavor. It is lightly carbonated, with notes of sour plum in it, as it warms up. It does become slightly more sour as well, and it becomes a bit fuller in the mouth. Overall a fairly simplistic version of a sour Flemish ale."

"Even, subtle, cherry juice flavors together with burned graham crackers, chimney and rye cracker tease lightly until the all-too-soon finish of mineral water flushes the palate. Maybe I'm a sucker for the style, but it's a good beer. Watered down vis a vis Rodenbach or Liefmans but soulful nevertheless."
"Taste - sweet and malty. not very bitter and not to spicy with a hint of citrus. A bit woody making the beer nice and flavorful. the only down fall is that its a bit too sour for me once the sweetness wears off."

"Very good sour beer for those who would like to try a sour, but are not ready for the super sour beers like a Berliner Weiss style."
"I was excited to crack into this one as it came in a small 8.4 oz. bottle. I was expecting great things from small packages. The label claims the beer has been aged 2 years, interesting enough. Anyway, it poured with a pure brown look, nothing more or less. It smells of an old fruit covered cask, yum. I immediately sensed some candy-like aspects on contact. Sparkling sweet overtones layers nicely on a dull subtle cherry wood essence. This is a well planned, top notch brew."
"Overall, this is a great sipper and wonderfull treat after dinner, before dinner or durring dinner. It is also a wonderful introduction to Belgian beers and i cant wait to travel the long Belgian road."
"The only beer that I have ever tried to compare to this beer is the Goudenband, and I really didn't like it very sour. However, the Petrus Oud Bruin definitely found acceptance with my palate and found a spot as one of my favorite most unique beers I have tasted in awhile. Served in a nice sized goblet, this beer gives of a slightly tinted amber brown with an off white rising head. The aroma is that of fruit and malt sweetness, and I found no sourness at all to the smell. The first sip was very sweet, and the fruit and candi sugar sweetness complements with a tart apple sharpness that is very enjoyable. A well done belgium brew that I find may be on of the best, especially within it's style. A medium bodied brew with a pretty good drinkability leaves a nice dryness. The drinkability would be a lot higher, but the sourness may be hard to handle after a few of these."

"That said this is still a fine Old Brown Ale & very accomplished."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a thin cream colored head that leaves quite a bit of lace. Aroma is sour... with some apple and spice. Flavor begins with some vinegar sourness, and some dried prune, caramel, and apple notes... also has a peppery spiciness to the finish. Has a thin and spritzy body... almost like a sparkling wine. A nice rendition of a Flanders Ale, but not something I'm likely to seek out."
"This ale pours a striking walnut brown with a light tan head. The head is full of carbonation and clings to the sides of the glass leaving a nice lace pattern. The aroma is sweet and sour. Sweet malt vapors meld with strong acidic sour beer notes like that of a Belgian red ale. The taste starts with a rich maltiness that is quickly over powered by the oak sourness. The finish moves away from the sourness and has a blend of dry fruits with spice as its major taste components. The aftertaste is very dry with hints of sourness blending with malt sweetness. No hop presence here. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a slight effervescence on the tongue. This is a nice example of a Belgian Oud Bruin. A little more complexity in the taste and aftertaste and this would be a great Oud Bruin."
"Pours a dark reddish colour topped by a fairly nice head. The aroma of this beer is quite weird. It reminds me of half a dozen familiar smells but none of which i can name. The flavor was refreshing and a bit fruity."
"Burgundy to brown color. Thin, light, fizzy white head. Smell is sweet and sour combination of lambic like. Very sour apples smells, some subtle oak undertones. It went downhill from there. Taste was a highly carbonated, overly charged sour apples. Soda pop like feel, supercharged, just couldn't get anything going. Nearly lambic like in the sour carbonated finish. The label claims it is stored in oak casks for 2 years. This tastes like it was stored in an oak shoe and dirty sock for 2 years. To higly carbonated, thin, and flat out wierd tastes going on here. Very tough to finish, doesn't improve at is warms. I hope I got a bad batch. Not good."
"Medium dark reddish brown with fair number of suspended yeast particles. Light tan head is not sluggish but not excitable either. The arom is rose floral, brown sugar, wood and, for some reason that I have no clue of, ketchup. The flavor is clear and reserved with a slight fruitiness (apple?) with a mildly sour finish."
"Dark reddish brown body.  Fairly clear, but you don't see much through a color as dark as this.  Pours to a nice head, but it fades very quickly.  Some faint traces of CO2 present in body.  This beer smells heavenly, and my mouth watered as soon as I inhaled the aroma!  Sour fruity aroma dominates the smell, but there's plenty of sweet malt to back it up.  Slight grassy notes are also noticeable.  Taste just doesn't really deliver.  It's certainly not bad, but it's not what it could and should be.  Slightly sour tasting brew, with notes of raisins and cherries.  A bit malty, with a bit of oily bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is pretty solid - nice and smooth.  Overall, it's a good brew but I'll stick with Goudenband when I want an old brown."
"A beautiful pour, nice light brown color with a reddish tint.  Smell is amazing, musky and fruity with a sour note that is well balanced with the prune and raisin malt aroma.  Sourness in the flavor is very nice and complex.  Malt is in back but provides a nice sweet balance to the sourness.  Surprisingly the oak character doesn’t come through a lot, not nearly as much as rodenbach.  A very nice and drinkable sour brown."
"The sour/tart character of this beer might not appeal to everyone, but I found it a great change of pace for a late evening sipper.  The 8.5 oz. bottle is kind of small, but for this beer it is appropriate, as it is not something you would want to drink in bulk - this is a beer to sip and savor."
"This is not like any brown from the States.  Good carbonation and head, deep ruby red color.  Its aged 2 years in oak casks  and this must give it the sweet/sour viney taste.  Tiny bottle - 8.4oz for $2.69."
"Overall, this beer strikes me a a bit unbalanced on the sour side.  The contrast between sweet malt and sour esters can be pleasant, but here detracted from the overall drinking experience."
"Gorgeous transparent mahogany.  The head dissipates quickly.  Lovely nose of pit fruits, especially plums, with a mouth-watering sour note.  Thick and a bit sweet on the palate with a bit of a burnt sugar taste.  Nowhere near as acidic or tangy as the nose indicated, and a bit short.  This bottle-conditioned beer is probably a bit past its prime, but nowhere near the five and half years past its prime that its ""Best Before"" date of February 19, 1997 would indicate.  This beer has been in my wine cellar since purchase some 5+ years ago."
"Dark brown color with a slight red hue.  Tangy/fruity aromas in the nose.  Very little head that dissipated quickly and was heard to resurrect. Lighter bodied than other beers in the style.  Sweet and sour flavor leaning more towards the sweet.  Overall a good beer in the style, but not my favorite."
