There's so much complexity, especially on the nose and on the front of the palate, and the lightness on the back really aids the drinkability. For a 5% beer, it's impressive the amount of flavour that's packed in: it's a lesson to anyone who thinks that *only* is bigger better. I liked it a lot.","lacqueredmouse","Dec 30, 2013"

The taste follows suit. Sour cherries with a good bit of funk to come in late. This beer wants to beer sour, yet still wants to be a super sweet Kriek.","VncentLIFE","May 15, 2012"

2.39,-37.8,3.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,"O: This beer is not good, but is also not entirely wretched. It lacks depth and substance, and is obviously not brewed with the fan of traditional Flemish oud bruins in mind. Most oud bruins are lactic and sour with just a hint of sweetness. This beer is sweet and oddly toasty with a subtle hint of vinegar sourness. I imagine mixing a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale with a traditional Flemish oud bruin would produce a very similar effect. If you have to try this beer, use it as an accompaniment to food. Otherwise, stick with Liefmans Goudenband and the sour brown ales brewed by Verhaege.","mrfrancis","Nov 17, 2011"

Tangy, not overly sweetened thankfully. Decent, not great. More of a ""training wheels"" Oud Bruin, not a lot of depth here, and pretty restrained sourness.

3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer gives me the impression of Sour Patch Kids candies where there's really two different sets of characteristics in the glass: there's a solid Sour Ale and then there's a malty sweet ale that seems a bit like Rochefort 10.

3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a vibrant red brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, wood, sour, tart, and very slight funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, wood, raspberries, and subtle funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Definitely not my favorite from the style but still pretty good. I like how this brew incorporated tart cherry and raspberry into the flavor as this made it much more palatable than some harsher Oud Bruins I have had in the past. A definitely well done brew that I would definitely drink again given the opportunity.","thagr81us","Feb 15, 2011"

3.58,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Thick mattress of foam lasting on a dark brown color body. The smell is lightly tart for a oud bruin, showing more round malty notes and fruity notes, red fruits on one side and citrus in the carbonation in the other. In the taste too, the tart aspect isnÂ’t overwhelming. The maltiness is made more round by the fruity tart notes that appear after a second with light wooden notes. Mouthfeel isnÂ’t unpleasing, but a bit watery for the style. A oud bruin that seems to try to attract to the masses, and that succeeds.","tjd25","Aug 02, 2004"

3.45,-10.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours with an average sized light brown head that reduces to a rather nice lace. The color is very brown with a few reddish highlights. ThereÂ’s a very slight hazy. There is a slight malt aroma with no real hops noticeable. Aromas of cherry, wine, and oak are also present. IÂ’ve read someplace that this is used as a base for Liefmans Kriekbier, and if this is true, it definitely seems like it would lend itself to this task. The start is light and sweet with cherry notes. Oaky, wine notes pick up a bit and finishes tart and dry. The tartness of the finish lasts for quit a while. The carbonation is rather soft, and the body is somewhat watery at times. No alcohol is noticeable. A fairly drinkable brew, but not one that I would prefer to drink on a regular basis.","byrd","Aug 24, 2003"

2.73,-28.9,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Brilliantly clear garnet hue, topped by a meager, spotty,.soapy head. Laceless. Sugary caramel and ripe pruneish esters dominate the aroma, with cidery tartness and hints of sour, damp oak adding a secondary contrast. Akin to a sour ESB in aroma. Very odd. Mellow lactic tartness incipient in flavor is promptly superceded by obtrusive dark candi sugar sweetness, which overrides the understated tart, woody undertone. Lanky malt backbone manages a vapid bread like note. Horsey, enteric notes do manage to poke through the dominant sugar presence, lending a sweetened, soured old ale impression. Thin in body, yet with a sticky, sucrose rich mouthfeel that weighs on the palate. Finishes with a slight augmentation of lactic tartness that's too little too late. An odd, unbalanced brew, in which the addition of sugar masked most microflora derived complexity. As the palate adjusts, Oud Bruin falls short in delivery overall, but isn't wretched. My initial impression was that it was. Stick with Liefman's Goudenband and their lambics.","marc77","Beers"
2.43,-36.7,3.5,3,2,2,2.5,"The colour of this beer is a dark brown-red, with mahogany reflexes. A beautiful head, soft and compact, but not persistent. Smell of fresh must, grapes and even sour black cherry. These is a probable addition of sugar, and this spoils the complexity of the beer. Even at the taste, the sweet is too high. The taste is less ""strong"" the the flavour (maybe the sugar...). It results not well balanced. Maybe you can fell a very little note of tartness, but very very light...","stcules","0"
