I really have not had too many beers that capture musky mushroom essence more than this and I think this makes a good base beer but I am not sure i would drink more of them with many other options available.  Being a huge fan of the Flanders Oud Bruin style, I would much rather have an Aardmonik Earthmonk any day of the week (as if it were available :) )","alpinebryant","Feb 28, 2015"

4.14,6.7,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"a really beautiful and authentic oud bruin, its been far too long since i had a good one. this is just awesome, dark brown with some dark red shades when held to the light, and almost a full inch of lasting khaki head thick and airy. it seems real sour, lacto fermented, tangy, acidic, funky, with a rich and semisweet brown malt profile with minimal roast bitterness but lots of depth. the flavor is just like the nose, with a profound lemony sting on the swallow. the malt gives more body than flavor, while the acidity is the driver here. tartness and sourness both, clean through, and not a palate scorcher by any means. layers of dried fruit come in too, raisins and cherries to be specific, while the acidity never loosens its puckery grip. medium bodied and carbonated brilliantly, this beer comes across lighter than it is as a result. it really perks me up too, with a shocking sort of mouth eel, still elegant through. very very well made, i have overlooked this way too long. for six bucks there may not be a better example of the style out there.","StonedTrippin","Dec 16, 2013"

4.36,12.4,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"The beer pours with a fierce, hissing carbonation that forms a head of medium sized, off-white bubbles that quickly fizzles into nothing, leaving a clean and calm top of the beer without any head. Carbonation bubbles continue to tear to the top of the glass however, and appear reminiscent of highly carbonated soda bubbles. In color, the beer is a deep ruby brown, almost maroon, with a distinct ruby glow in the light. The beerâ€™s body is slightly viscous with a darkness that makes it opaque, though the beer appears clean of any particles or cloudiness. On the nose, the beer smells of green apples, malt vinegar, cherry fruit leather, and fresh strawberry jam. Rich funky scents cover the nose from this beer, blending with the light malt character to bring a touch of plum, raisins, and a soft trace of toffee. Touches of sherry coincide with the rich smell of strawberry jam, which is quite bizarre, yet inviting. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with lactic and malic acidity, traces of malty sweetness run across the tongue, and a very faint touch of roasted bitters can be sensed in the finish. Balance is slightly tart, but nice and not assaulting on the tongue. Fruit esters are strong and complex. In flavor, the beer begins as tart green apple, then cherry pie, then cherry fruit leather. Malt vinegar does work its way into the flavor along with sherry-like notes in the mid-palate. Just as the beer hits the back of the tongue, a sweet and sour sauce flavor can be sensed along with some of the strawberry jam from the nose. On the finish, the beer softens its tartness enough to bring soft coffee, caramel roast, and a touch of barnyard funk on the tongue alongside the fruit esters, providing a beautiful finish that lasts for quite a while on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with a middling carbonation that carries a bit of a prickle and a touch of astringency. Mouthfeel is smooth, and after the beer leaves, the mouth is left wet and gently puckering. Overall, I really like this Oud Bruin. This beer has a great funky character, a nice balance, and finishes with a great malt presence that really pulls together the beer and provides for a fascinating sip. I would love to pair this beer with richer meals to see how the acidity and malt play with food. This is a great beer with perfect complexity for the style.","Maxwell","Dec 01, 2013"

It is not really complex but it has a really good amount of interest to it, so I cannot complain too much. And the sour hit this delivers is... well, very well achieved. It does not hit with vinegar to cause the sour, it relies on other very high quality traits to lay it on you and that is what I appreciate and enjoy the most. No gimmicks. Just plain well achieved.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Sep 29, 2013"

Ripe red berries, yogurt and hints of balsamic vinegar in both the nose and flavor. Intensely sour, but deliciously full fruitiness rounds it out. Would definitely buy again, especially considering the modest price.","BeerZack","Sep 01, 2013"
