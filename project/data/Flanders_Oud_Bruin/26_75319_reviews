"Not very sour but balanced. Some slight off flavors."
""
"Overall: Despite the vomit-tomato-wateryness, I actually loved it. Kidding, horrible. two thumbs way down. I would turn down a taster of this every single time."

"Rich reddish brown body with minimal white head. 2nd bottling from Spring 2013. Definitely some acidity on the nose. Not much else on the nose. Nice malty body that helps round out the tartness. The beer is pretty one note in terms of acidity, but the Flanders body is there. Not a bad Flanders, but not very complex."

"O - FFF can do hoppy beers, they can do stouts, and then can do German-style beers. However, they can't do sours...until I try one that's half way decent, I'm sticking to my opinion. Pass."
"D - This isn't very good. I almost wish it was offensively bad, rather than bland, as it'd give me more party conversation material. A very dull beer with an unpleasant finish. Literally tastes like a homebrewer's first attempt at a sour brown."

"O: Terrible. I love Zombie Dust and Dreadnaught and Alpha King and Behemoth and others from Three Floyd's but every sour that I've had from them has been not good. Stick to the Hops. Sorry. I'm glad I didn't pay for this or 'Stache"

"O: An ok from FFF. Not overly complex by any standards, but it is easily drinkable and the flavors mesh well."

"Tastes like it smells. Way lots of smooth brandy and vanilla against a medium-strength vinegary sourness with some nice herbs backing everything up. The flavor is light when compared to most other FFF BA's, but it's super duper tasty."
