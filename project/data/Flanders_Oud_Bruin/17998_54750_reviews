"Overall, a crisp easy to drink oud bruin.  Sourness is mild enough that this could be a good introduction to someone new to sour styles."
"Not cheap but for good reason!"
"Prost!"

"Tart, vinegar-like aroma with an odd funk bordering on partially digested dark fruits. Berry, cider-like, sour flavor well balanced with a mild dark fruit sweetness. Hint of oak and cocoa. Dry feel. Sticky on the lips. Near perfection all around."

"Overall: Not to my tastes at all. I really wanted to like this beer, as I generally like dark beers and I generally like sours. That being said, I do not like funk. This was very too funky for me. In fact I did not even finish the bottle and tossed it. Other reviews have been much more positive - so maybe I got a bad bottle? Or maybe this is just not a style of beer for me."
"The taste has a nice sour tartness, cherry pit, nutty brown malt, slight saltiness possibly from a sodium bicarbonate water treatment. Faint bitterness, lemon rind and must. Perhaps more aggressively acetic than some, this hits the style nail on head but with authority. It has ample malts, and finishes with sweetness that loses its battle to the tart mid palate and hereafter. Medium bodied ale with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good Flanders style brown made in Switzerland. Color me impressed guys, keep up the good work!"

"an elite oud bruin, a bit more sour than some of the others on the market, this has a lot of flare though. the bottle is over 20 bucks, and unlike the framboise, i think this one is a lot closer to worth what it costs. dark dark brown, and rather clear until the dregs run down, not much head, but a shiny and radiant luster to this. the nose is insanely sour, lots of caustic acidic citric acid and lemon flavors, while grain tannins are robust as well. some roast, but not totally coca forward or bitter, unique brown grain bill that has some sugar before it stars getting weird. the taste starts with the richer malt, but moves rapidly into a classic oud bruin sourness. more than just lambic sour, this is unique and brutally intense, especially when it warms up. lemon sourness on a brown beer is unique and lovely, somehow delicate for being huge, and there is a long lasting dry burn on the tongue, which you dont always get with these. i love the fuller body, the depth of flavor, and the acid intensity, but its a tough bottle by your lonesome. it works a lot better as a share, since a ton of this will definitely turn the stomach all kinds of inside out. enough carbonation to be lively, very cool yeast profile, dry as they get for the style. top quality oud bruin, worth paying for if this is your style."

"A- dark brown with a tan head that quickly fades to a ring around the glass.%0A%0AS- very light aromas. Mainly of roasted malts and a hint of sour.%0A%0AT- lots of dark roasted malts that are overpowered immediately by great oaky sourness. Almost more of a sour stout.%0A%0AM- Nicely effervescent with the sour notes touching the tip of my tongue and my cheeks. Ending in a dry acidity.%0A%0AO- This is what I would expect if you mixed The Bruery - Tart of Darkness and Jolly Pumpkin - Madrugada Obscura together. Which is not a bad thing at all.%0A%0A"

"A really wonderful beer of the style."

"Flavors of tart cherry and caramel brown. Slightly sweet and nicely tart and puckering. Its not over acidic at all. This is fantastic. Trois dame really makes some amazing brews...sours in particular and this does not dissapoint."

"Compared to a Duchesse there's no vinegar or sweet fruit type flavors. Compared to many Cantillion or Crooked Stave there's no barnyard or horseblanket...this is very mouth puckering sour with tart, possibly unripe fruit flavors."

"I found this beer to be very satisfying, so much so that I had more than one. It was quite appetizing, and not at all too strong to enjoy several. I'm not too experienced with sours, but compared to some others, this pleased my palate in that it lacked the stronger vinegar-like bite, while still having a nice fruit tartness that was in balance with the malt notes."

"O: I found this to be quite enjoyable. It had a good sour smack to it along with the typical oud bruin flavors I enjoy, and the apricot added another level of complexity. I could easily have had more."
"Grande Dame is a much more sour beer than nearly all of the Oude Bruins that I have had the pleasure to try. But its the unadulterated vinegar overtones that provide all of the sourness and could use more complexity from earth and age or it could exhibit a more restrained sour balance for noticeable improvement."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is slightly sour with some dark fruit and slightly funky aromas. Taste is of tart dark fruits, slight vinegar, and slight funk flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it tastes better than it smells in my opinion."
"O: really quite good bruine. super drinkable. similar to red poppy."
"O: Quite good. Will buy again. Reminiscent of a couple of cherry barrel-aged beers, like Red Poppy Ale (which also have a lot of the oak and gingerbread flavors going for them)."

"O: Overall it is a really nice, very tasty beer. It is a super drinkable and wonderfully balanced sour."

"Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one with me! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a reddish brown with a two finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vinegar, wood, tart raspberries, and subtle tart cherries. The flavor was of sweet malt, vinegar, tart cherries, wood, sugar, and subtle raspberries. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. It was quite complex and enjoyable. I was really surprised that I was able to pick up on raspberries in this one, but it was definitely very welcome. The aroma on this one was top-notch for this style. A definite must try for any fan of the style or anyone curious without a doubt."
"The beer is dark, chestnut brown with hints of ruby. The beige head is thin and fades almost immediately. The aroma offers oak, cherries, sweet cherry juice. The flavor brings a blend of sweet and tart cherries, along with some oak. Tannic throughout. Low carbonation. Slightly puckering finish. A good sipping beer, similar to a nice wine."

"Overall: First Flanders Oud Bruin that I've had and I've got to admit that I dig it. It's the best of a sour and brown ale. I'm sold!"
"Overall Impression- What an Oud Bruin! I had to pass this one around the bar to let others experience this brew. Would throw this on my top 5 Oud Bruin Hall of Fame list without a doubt. Love to see if others note this sweet-sour battle all the way through the drink. Like nothing I've had before!"
"O: Great beer"
"I recommend aging this one."
"An enjoyable beer, if only for the fact that I like the style. Considering the rather hefty price tag, however I would not actively seek this one out again. There are much better options if you're in the mood for a Flanders Oud Bruin."
"Different than what I expected, but still good. I expected something more like Duchesse de Borgogne, or Monk's Cafe, a Flemish sour ale with hints of sweetness, but this has hardly any hints of sweetness. At first I thought it was almost too tart, but now I think it is well balanced enough that I would buy it again. No apparent head when I poured it, which is kind of disappointing. Little carbonation. The picture on the bottle is totally different, yet I assume it is still the same beer pictured."
"D: I liked the nose quite a bit, but the flavor was definitely a let down. Good, but not worth the rather hefty price tag."
"D- easy to finish and i find myself liking this beer more and more. it definitely exceeded expectations. a great balance of sour and sweet. check this one out if youre a fan of the style."
"d - I thought this was a very good flanders. Lots of oak and sour fruits in the nose and taste. Would like to have again."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. The aroma is tart dark fruit. The flavor is tart dark fruit, oak and vanilla. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice sour beer. Not as complex as some, but the beer is very drinkable. Glad I got to try this one."
"D: Beyond the norm. Could drink massive amounts of this - dry and easy to drink in large amounts. At 7.2% these are easy to crush!"
"An interesting version of an Oud Bruin, by a Swiss brewer. I am finding this pretty enjoyable, and the ABV is sessionable."
"D- Drinkability is somewhat limited overall by the pH of this beer. But for the style, I think it's still above average."
"Pours cloudy, but settles to the color of dark stained wood. The thin beige head dissipates quickly, leaving minimal, soapy lacing. Light aromas of oak and cherries, with a strong whiff of sticky sweet balsamic vinegar reduction. Smells fresher than your average Oud Bruin, with the brightness of fresh grapes. The yeastiness coming through is funkier than expected, reminiscent of a saison. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and a bit dry. Sweet notes of caramel and roasted almonds play nicely against mild flavors of tart fruit. The finish has a lingering balsamic vinegar sharpness"
"Bottle: Poured a dark redddish color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of vinous sour notes is well done. Taste is a nice mix between some tart notes with some oak and light cherry backed by a nice solid malt backbone. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no sign of the alcohol. Very well done and definitely underrated compared to some other beer form this style."
