"Overall: I didn't quite expect this beer to be anything like this. the name and label points towards a beer dominated by wild yeast and barrel character. but what it turns out to be is a refreshing and crisp kolsch with influences by wild yeast and cypress. nice touch to a good base beer."

"O: I found myself surpsised with this beer twice. At first I was surprised at the level of funk presence in both the aroma and taste. This was a disappointing surpsise. As I sipped through, I was equally surprised at how this beer grew on me. I would not say it overwhelms on any level. I will say that it is very drinkable, and one that I ended up enjoying quite a bit."
