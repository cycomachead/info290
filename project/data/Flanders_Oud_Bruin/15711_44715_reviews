"The gorgeous brown color and classic sour smell gave me high hopes for this beer. However, I found it to have a slightly unpleasant miso-like aftertaste and a little harsh on the way down. I like my $5 bottle of Vanderghinste way more."

"I was a little shocked by the fact that there was almost no head to this beer.  Almost none and it was poured from a freshly opened bottle.  Just a light brown skim around the edges.  Body is a murky brown pond of mystery.  Nose is beautiful and packed with tons of dark fruit and dusty sour notes.  This subtle sour feel is soft but full and wonderful.  Abruptly sour at first with the initial sip.  Dry and sharp with lemon zest and cherry skins all over the tongue.  There is a nice consistent robust feel that mixes with the sour to crate an incredible sour beer drinking experience here.  Really spot on for the style and unique at the same time."

"Draft @ Mikkeller Bar SF on 1/19/15.  Pours a red, brown color with minimal head.  Aroma is acidic, red grapes, malt, and brett.  Medium to thin bodied.  Taste is vinegar-like acidity with tones of cherry, grape and funk with a bitter finish.  Decent flanders red."

"Thanks! Pleasant at colder temperatures, but vinegar becomes overly potent as it warms toward room temperature, and acetone brings the beer down. Still, there are some pleasant vinous, oak, and oxidation notes. Firmly sour but tending too far toward the acetic end of the spectrum, even for the style. The beer was nearly still and I think some carbonation would have livened things up. I was told this bottle was a few years old."

"Absolutely incredible smell! The taste was barely a notch below the smell. A very rich, full, and complex drink. Definitely pair this one with some great food. The wine characteristics really come through. A little was left in the bottle the next morning ( I couldnt take the entire thing down by myself) and it still had that amazing smell."

"Can I just write sour over and over for this review? Because this was sour—intensely sour, mouth-puckering sour, battery acid eating my taste buds off my tongue sour… like vinegar, tart cherries, strawberries before ripe sour. It was –and I never get to say this—a little too much for me. Sour!"

"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas. Solid"

"Quite a bit of oxidation but in a good way, not ruined, but not quite optimal. A very unique creation and probably a sour heads oud bruin fantasy, but there's more to life than being slammed by the obvious."

"This has melded into a beautiful sour beer. The wood is super mellow but has left it's mark for sure. This was quite a surprise. If you like Oud Bruins this is a must try."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/10/2011. Pours slightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of blackberry, cranberry, cherry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, pepper, hay, straw, brown bread, leather, herbal, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt, yeast ester, and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of blackberry, cranberry, cherry, green apple, red grape, clove, oak, red wine vinegar, brown bread, light chocolate, leather, herbal, pepper, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blackberry, cherry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, herbal, leather, musty funk, and oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of malt, wine barrel, and fruity/acidic yeast flavors; with a nice malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with lightly slick and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders brown ale. All around good balance and complexity of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and wine barrel flavors; and nicely smooth to sip on with the moderate level of acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"I suppose we all have to start somewhere, and if this is indeed Norway's first spontaneously barrel fermented beer in over 100 years (!), there's definitely room for the industry to improve. The rustic flavors are great, as well as the dark, dried fruit notes, but the oak, or at least the blending process within, needs to improve. Not terrible, but definitely one of the least memorable of the night."

"Very excited to try this long-time want! Batch 343 - Total Bottles=2280. 500ml bottle served in a tulip. Pours slightly darker than mahogany with a loose, off-white head that immediately disperses into a soapy swirl - no lacing on this one. Nose is quite characteristic of the style - cherry Sucrets, tannins and perhaps the faintest trace of vanilla. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also some leather and tobacco notes in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a light, even carbonation. Additionally, the inherent acidity of this beer stimulates the sides of the cheeks and leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a solid example of the style. I really can't find any fault with this beer; however, there are other Flanders Oud Bruins that I feel are more nuanced."
"O- awesome. Second only to Cuvée des Jacobins as far as sours I've tried."
""
""
"Overall: Really good stuff. The wine barrel aging definitely adds lots of additional complexity to the beer and really helps to put it in the upper echelon of the style."
"O: The taste and smell of this beer is outstanding but the thick fell with extremely low carbonation makes this is something to enjoy occasionally and in small amounts. This is great for after dinner."
"Dark opaque reddish brown. Smell and taste are very acidic. There is virtually no carbonation and that really hurts the overall experience. More carbonation would lighten the acidity and it would be about right. With the lack of carbonation it is a bit too much for me."
""
""
"Overall the year in the cellar has added some more funk and possibly elevated the peat and smoke character. Enjoying this quite a bit and it's unique in that it tastes foreign. No American renditions I've had carry these types of flavors."

"Cheers!"

"O - I'm used to sours from RR. This is different, not that that's a bad thing."
"O- I'd like to enjoy this beer and it has a unique aroma but the wine barrel presence just reminds me of why I don't drink wine. It's an interesting combination but not something I'd seek out again."
"overall - had no idea this was a sour when i opened the bottle and poured it. boy was i surprised when i smelled this one! big fan of sours and this one is in the upper echelon. highly recommend that you pick this one up if you can."

"D: besides being lackluster to look at and lacking carbonation, not a bad brew. glad the wood is there with the all this acid. really starts to grow on you as you consume. I would recommend this to my sour-head friends."
"O - Quite a complex Flanders Oud Bruin, and offers plenty. The coffee hit is interesting. Given the fact that the beer was aged in old red wine barrels, I would have liked to have seen more influence of red wine. This is a very heavy FOB and may not suit all. It takes the standard style to a new level."
""
"Its more like wine than beer and I like it."
""
""
"O: Man, I poured a glass of this, and I don't know if I'm going to finish the glass, much less the beer. Too bad, I like this style."
""
"A little too much, maybe. Lots of spice/booze and maybe could have used a bit more fruit to complement the slight acidity. Nice, but just a little overcooked for me."
""
""
"O: This beer was a crazy surprise. I knew it was going to be good, but I didn't know it was going to be this good and this unique. This is the definition of a barrel-aged sour. It makes it even better that it has some local Norwegian history attached to it."
""
"HaandBryggeriet's Norwegian Wood is one of the best beers I've ever had. Haandbakk, not so much. The mouthfeel is thin and grape-juice like, which you experience after a completely unexciting pour with nearly zero head. The taste is okay, but far from exceptional. I bought this hoping for a lot but was sorely disappointed."
"Medium body, upper carbonation level, dry and lingering on the palate. Nice Oud Bruin, pretty aggressive profile, but a fun sour experience."
""
"O-The smell and flavor profile were outstanding with nice balance between oak and fruit, and sour and sweet. The finish lasted forever, too. The beer loses major points for the complete lack of carbonation, but I am willing to give this another shot because if I could find a correctly carbonated bottle, this would move up quite a few notches."
"Overall (4/5): Haandbakk is a very interesting, tasty brew. It is a rarity in that it is a strong sour ale. Impressively, the alcohol is very well hidden, allowing Haandbakk's outstanding tart, sour, winey flavors and mellow woody tones stand out unimpeded. This ale is unique among sours I have had, though I would not say it's anywhere near the top of that heap. Very good nonetheless."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy red color ale with a small bubbly head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of deep sour notes with light tart cherry notes also perceptible and some quite funky ester. Taste is a mix between deep sour and tart cherry notes with light smoke notes and some barnyard notes also detectable. Body is full with limited filtration and low carbonation. Quite extreme though acidity level is balanced. Not something I would have everyday bit interesting nonetheless."
"D: Very good. Delicious and drinkable. 8% alcohol is not present at all. I'd love another and would buy again. I don't want it to end!"
""
""
"Huge vinous and fruity flavors balanced against balsamic notes. Excellent example of the style, one of my favorites. Glad this is kind of a sleeper hit and hangs around for a bit on shelves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent, contemplative ale. A rewarding sipper. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall - So I actually think it's good to drink. Not my favorite, but nothing close to bad. A lot going on and maybe some of the flavors aren't my favorite. No vinegar, which I love."
"I really like this beer, its frankly a little weird with the chocolatey brown flavors along with the pretty intense sour characteristics, but I really like it. I've only had this old vintage though. Found it at a random store for about 8 bucks, seems like that was a good deal"
""
""
"O: This is a great Flanders oud bruin. HaandBryggerriet has really done this unique style justice with this brew. I would have no trouble recommending this to fans of the style."
"This one is on the level with the sour and tart woody funk permeating the experience. Those mature cherries are in the mix as well. This is the style at its best. You could certainly do a lot worse, but it'd be pretty difficult to do a lot better. The price is high, but the experience merits it. Nice job. Worth the coin."
""
"Kind of disapointed in this."
"It tastes almost like a sour smoked porter. But at first that isn't obvious. It starts sweet like black cherries. From out of nowhere come little flavors of dark chocolate and smoked malt, which turn out to be very complimentary to the style. The beer is medium-full bodied, with exteremly low carbonation. However, low carbonation alone isn't going to stop this masterpiece. This is just great beer."
"Thanks, mrmiles, for the opportunity"

"O: A brewery that I’d never heard of, a name I can’t pronounce, a beer that I didn’t expect, and yet a palate that I absolutely adored: that’s Haandbakk. The natural tastes that are found in this bottle would leave any Flanders fan deeply satisfied; what a superb beer."

"Haandbakk pours a light bodied dark cherry wood brown in color with no or lacing even in a somewhat still pour. The smells is of sour cherries, oak, soured dark fruits, plum, and red wine barrel. The flavors are nice too. You get plenty of red wine barrel, oak, tart cherry, and sweet grape. It is as interesting as can be for the style and has a nice, although moderate, level of sourness. The least impressive part of this beer are the body and mouthfeel. It poured almost flat and drinks flat, almost like a still lambic. Tis definitely takes away from the drinkability and desirability of this beer, good flavor or not. I like this beer a lot, for what it is, but it could be remarkable if it had the proper body."
""
""
""
"Thin-medium mouthfeel. Sour character is quite present but not overbearing. Acidic from fermentation not carbonation. Not scorching to the palate. Good stuff. Super unique."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes fantastic! A wonderful, two-stage sock to the face that is equally complex and variegated on each end. Up front, roasted, oak-aged barley that's nutty and biscuity, like a traditional English brown. In the back, intensely sweet and tart lactic acid cherries and apples. The stages are remarkably distinct, which mandates slow sipping, and the overall effect is one of the most interesting and well balanced beers I've had in ages."
"O: nicely balanced oude bruin, worth a try"
""
""
"I can't recommend this beer enough, if you have access get it. For the price it is amazing, and for being a year past it's stated best before date I think it was even better than the last time I had it."

"O: Overall this a great beer and one of my favorites in the style. If you like Oud Bruins or just sours in general I wouldn't pass this up."

"SkÅL!"
"Wonderful brew from Haand. This is a complex, delightful and exciting beer, that gives something unique to the drinker."
"Overall, my experience with this beer was a downward spiral starting with a pretty nice color and nose and tumbling to unpleasant tastes and feelings. given the rave reviews by others, I'd be willing to try this again but not for $12. I had a similar experience with ""Wild Thing""."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
"Overall: Very good and smooth. I was super impressed with this one, especially because I didn't know anything about it ahead of time. Would definitely have it again."
"A nice well balanced Flemish old brown, imaging a fat ripe hard cheese would be excellent with it."
"overall a nice sour beer. It has enough flavor to counter-act the strength of the sour."
"O: Surprisingly smoky. Really unique enjoyable sour beer."
"Cheers!"
"O- The bright fruity notes blend with some nice funk hints and a dry finish with hints of wood really add some nice depth to this beer. The beer takes on more vinous qualities and the body thins as it opens up. The bitter aspirin quality fades into more of a tartness as the beer opens aswell."
"Definitely one of the most complex Flanders I've had. Not into sours, but I can get down with the complexity here and appreciate it."
"This is exactly what I hoped it would be. The examples I've had from this style tend to be more vinegar-forward and the barrel aging clearly mellowed this one out a bit. Wish I had picked up one to cellar, this was quite a treat!"
"O- Can't quite put my finger on this one. At times, I loved it. At others, it was only slightly above average. Then again, when it comes down to it, I'd definitely buy it again."
"Cheers"
"Overall -- A well-made Flanders for certain. Very unique in the sheer amount of roast and cocoa from the malting, plus the wine barrel adds a nice woody/vinous note. Glad I finally got to try this. I'll be sure to pick several up next time it is available."
"Overall this is a unique Flanders--heavy on the barrel flavors, almost smoky, but still sour. Not my favorite, but I'm glad I tried it. It stands out from the rest."
"Very solid, one of the better oud bruins i've had."
"An amazing beer. A must try if you like sour beer."
"O: Good stuff, but still I found this one to be a little off. Maybe I just wanted more sour and less oatmeal cookie. Different strokes I guess..."
"Overall, I am very grateful for the opportunity to try a beer I have coveted for quite some time. An enjoyable brew, I would have this again."
"Definitely recommend trying this one at least once; not my personal favorite sour, but I can see a lot of potential for this to BE someone's favorite, and I'd it wouldn't be hard to understand why."
"O: This is quite the creative interpretation of the old farmhouse wilds of Norway. I have one more to cellar and look forward to revisiting it in the future."
"Opened a bottle of this beer to split with a friend of mine last night. The pour was of a reddish deep brown with no head on it and no lacing in side. Looks similar to a wine. The smell of wood, cherries, and plenty of funk on the nose. The taste right from the fridge was sour and gave off some elements of fresh tobacco and tart cherry in the aftertaste. As the beer warmed I feel that it started to become a little more balanced. The flavors didn't transition as much as when it was colder. The funk became less dominant as it warmed also. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth, not a lot of carbonation but remains a sipper based on how tart it is. Overall I think this is a pretty good attempt at a Flanders Red."
"Not my style of beer per se, but this beer was good and worth recommending to people who like a little sour pop in their beer."
"Nose reveals vinous notes, vinegar, dark fruits, cherries, wood, earth, light funk. Flavor follows suit, hefty malt body with toffee and earth notes to balance a rugged tartness. Cherries, grapes, red wine, vinegar, oak, vanilla, barnyard funk, loam, after reading the label I thought I could pick out something akin to rhubarb. Bone dry finish to accentuate a much rounder, fuller body than typical for style. Big and brash but it's not out of place, it all works together. A real treat."
"Deep red/brown with thin tan head. Initial aroma is sweet fruit, kind of strawberry like. Flavor is sour with a little fruit lurking in the back. Delicious! The sherry rhubarb wine from the oak has a subtle influence on the flavor. Very pleasant. Slight hint of oak as ii warms. I liken this beer to a fruitier La Folie."
"O/D-My god, I was recommended this and there was one left just sitting on the shelf. I had to shell out the ten dollars to try it. I feel pretty boss sipping this brew continuously via my Duvel tulip. This is up there for one of my favorite brews. As of this point its easily top ten worthy. I cannot believe the chocolate flavor, caught me off guard. Going through this bottle far too quickly. Awesome beer so happy I took the risk."
"Pours a one finger khaki head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy brown color. Nose is sour fruit and flavor is sour fruit and oak. Almost like a saison. Pricey at $10.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA. Label has ABV at 8.0%. Vintage 2009, bottled May 10, 2010."
"Wasn't sure what to expect with this one- a buddy snagged it for me from the Whole Foods in Roseville CA. Gotta say that I was quite pleased- a really nice example of an oud bruin. Surprisingly, my sour loving wife was not a fan though claims there is some weird flavor she is not fond of."
"This brew pours a murky cherry hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and very sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is nearly perfect for the style with hints of sour cherries,musk,fruit cake and old socks,it has a medium bodied averagely carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of very sour cherries,musk,soft lollies,oak and finshes with a wild berry sourness and overall a very interesting drop and to be quite honest i would buy it again cheers.."
"Poured into a Chouffe glass. Dark murky mahogany body with a struggling tan head. I might have poured it a little cold, but the head was still a little fizzy. Aromas of bran muffins, cherry cola, milk chocolate, light vinegar and alcohol. Second pour has a bit of ferrous character to the nose. Flavor is interesting, to say the least. The aroma suggests a malty oud bruin style beer but it tastes like an intentionally soured stout. Big helpings of roasty and toasty malts, a firm acetic sourness, and notes of dried fruit. A nice surprise since I can't stand oud bruins that taste like rotten Dr. Pepper. Dry but not astringent on the palate, lengthy finish, sorta thin. Pretty good but the dark malt + sourness thing isn't quite up my alley."
"Overall is amazing and I don't really know what I would change this in any way. Really like Haand beers and this might be my favorite yet."
"Pours an almost opaque dark crimson brown with a 1 inch light tan head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small spots of lace slide back down into the beer on the drink down. Smells of red wine vinegar, oak, and funk/must. Taste is exactly the same with the red wine/balsalmic vinegar, oak wood, and funk/must. The oak flavors are very noticeable on the aftertaste. There is a sour and acidic twang that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Mouthfeel is pretty flat which makes this beer a bit of a chore to drink. The sourness level would be better with more carbonation present. Overall, this is a good beer with nice oak notes in the taste but the carbonation issue leaves something to be desired."
"This bottle was a little heavier on the oak than my previous two experiences, but it was still a standout beer. Great version of this style and one you can take some time to admire. Very nice."
"I personally would stick with a Monks Cafe over this. A little more readily available and not as ""alcoholy"". A little pricey as well per bottle. Other than the boozy/nail polishy qualities to it, it's pretty much textbook Flanders Oud Bruin."
"O: Phenomenal mashup of a Flanders and a funky wild yeast fermentation. A truly well done ale."
"EDIT: Let this beer sit in the glass and breathe a little bit. This is about 45 minutes later and this beer is so much better once it spends a little bit of the time out of the bottle. The sourness is better and the end of the sip has this nice sweetness to it that sits in my mouth for a while. I am moving my taste from a 4 to a 4.5 and overall from a 3.5 to a 4."
"O/D - I could only have one but damn it was tasty. A style I'm becoming more fond of as the sour and sweet elements were balanced well and played off each other nicely making it easier to drink."
"If there's any beer that should hold up well after almost five years it's an oak barrel-aged 8.5% Flanders oud bruin and wild ale hybrid. This quite the experience, but it's almost too intense for all 500 ml to be enjoyable. My advice: find someone with an adventurous palate to share it with."
"O: Surprisingly good, I'll buy this if I see it again."
"Well I got this one in an awesome beer-it-forward from alewatcher, who, btw, is THE MAN. Great friggin' beer. I've tried and removed/replaced some beers received in trading from my wants list, curiosity having been satisfied. However, this one I'm going to leave on my wants list because it's friggin' fantastic! It really seems more like a wild ale to me than any other style, but then I'm no expert. No matter how you slice it, I really do love this beer! Thanks alewatcher!"
"In short this would be worth an A rating if it wasn't for the disappointingly unpleasant finish."
"At 8% ABV, I found this beer to be remarkably drinkable. Haandbakk competes with the best of the Flanders Oud Bruins."
"D - well balanced. great at displaying the ""beer behind the funk/sour"" as well, as the dark malts are actually very detectable. great peek at the style."
"drinks well. not overly sour, but tartness is plenty. acidity present throughout with fruit kept in the background. a very nice brew."
"D-A standout alternative to Belgian-made sours. Reccommended."
"(D)- A great Oud Bruin. Smooth, yet dry, tart, mildly sour and vinegar profiles. A winner for sure and easily enjoyable. More please."
"A good sour ale which while the tartness is high is very nice."
"D: Medium plus"
"D: Exceptional drinkable for the style."
"Overall- This is an extremely tasty oud bruin, though the aroma is a bit week. The flavors are layered very well, and has good drinkability all things considered. I would recomend trying this for any sour lover."
"Verdict: Very good and ALMOST worth the high price. You can find better in the style, but this is a wonderful and unique beer worth trying."
"Yum. Pours ruddy brown with a nice dense 1 finger head. Sticks around then fades to some foam and a thick ring. Aroma is strong acetic, vinous notes, sour cherry, leather, and musty used up oak. Great tart flavor, front, mid, and finish are tart! Musty too, but no overpowering Brett. Oak is clear and vanilla, rhubarb flavor and leather. Tingly and prickly mouthfeel. Pretty quafable for an oud bruin. Great, great beer."
"this should have been on my want list. I'm really enjoying how this is changing as it warms. Thank you for the chance to try this one. I'm really liking it alot. Thank you Richard for all of the beers you sent me. It really has been a treat."
"This might be one that would be interesting to taste again in a year or two. Not one that I would drink now - too heavy on the vinegar character; flavors just don't seem integrated and the ""sour"" is not ""sour;"" there is no brightness or pucker factor. Perhaps a bit of time will integrate this one. We'll see...."
"very good, a very nice approach to this"
"Beer is medium to light in body. Mild funk, dry finish, acetic and lacitc sourness. It's an easy drinking sour but dry on the finish. I'd have it again. It's quite good."
"this beer pours an intriguing dark mahogany color with a thin cocoa colored head that leaves the party very quickly. the color is awesome and immediately scores high points. one swirl wafes funk and chocolate covered cherries into the room. the smell matches the color perfectly and is almost exactly what i expected. i get oak cherries, vinegar, sweet mild chocolate, theres so much going on and i love every sip. its light and dark at the same time, where its so drinkable but the depth of flavors makes me sit and think about it every time i drink. the abv is nowhere to be found and id love to see how much further this brew could go if i lay a few down for a while. will definitely revisit again."
"D - Extremely drinkable; malty finish diminishes the normal wear and tear on one's tongue typical sours unleash"
"deep reddish brown with a great two-finger head that holds and leaves wonderful lace. nose and taste consist of wood, vanilla, earth, dark fruit, malty sweetness, tar, vinegar, spice and on and on... there are things going on here that really get the gears turning, and a lot of them are tastes and smells i've never experienced before. also a lot of shared characteristics between this beer and really old-world wines. tar (like road paving in the country) is the best way i can describe it. a lot of dark (not roasty; dark) flavors going on. everything is balanced well, with the vinegar notes playing with the sweet and spicy notes in a very natural, uncontrived way. taste is complex and a bit foreign. this beer is not for beginners. that being said, this was not (to me) an extremely drinkable beer, and even though i am a wild and sour lover, i was impressed, but not left wanting another."
"The overall complexity is almost too much for words. When you find it, buy two. I could drink this all night if it weren't so expensive ($10.99 per bottle)."
"D- an enjoyable beer now, but will probably be better with some time."
"D - Pretty good beer. Not as good as I was expecting but still a solid beer. Really reminds me of a soured bottle of wine. I heard that this was like Consecration's twin and I agree, it reminds me a lot of that beer. I'd pick this up again if I saw some but I won't go nuts trying to obtain it."
"Over a solid example of the style. That being said and given its somewhat large format I would definitely say this is a one and done endeavor."
"World class in my opinion... I don't drink a lot of sour ales but this beer has cracked my top 10 all time brews regardless of style.. I didn't want it to ever end... I had to drive a few hours to get this and this bottle has convinced me to pick some up on every trip... Truly an amazing beer...."
"Overall, I think it is a pretty decent beer. It is off the charts, but definitely above average and something I would drink again."
"Nice, complex beer unlike anything else I've had. Great mouthfeel with a bright body & plenty of carbonation. Great beer."
"Dark brown pour, with a dark cherry red tint in the light. Short lived beige head. Smell is nice musty cherry funk - quite nice. Taste follows suite, with the cherries nicely subdued. Something about this really clicks with me. Mouthfeel is smooth, light carbonation, and the higher abv does not really make itself too noticeable. I'd love to be able to get my hands on more of this outstanding Bruin."
"Pours a rusty red with a light tan head. Smell is sweet caramel along with a very strong lactic and acetic presence. Taste is very nice with chery and oak coming in as well. Mouthfeel is a bit of a drawback as the acetic character is quite strong. Drinkability is similarly affected. Do like the creaminess of the body."
"D: This is a wonderful beer, my favourite from the Haand Bryggeriet so far, complex, delicious, a must try in my opinion."
"Poured out of a 500 mil bottle into a flute. Dark coffee and cherry juice appearance, with very little head, though that may have had something to do with the drinking vessel. Smells of cherry, grapes (maybe pinot noir given the cherry scent), oak, and coffee/chocolate. Extremely tart and sour up front. Melds into a nice rich toasty chocolate flavor, then moulds into a Belgian Dubbel yeasty sort of note. Then the sour comes back with a vengeance, accompanied by cherry juice. Fantastic and complex beer. My only complaint is that it's a little hot for 8 percent."
"D- Not overly sour or tart. A very nice flanders that is complex, yet extremely drinkable. Very strong effort from Norway."
"Pours a nice mirky crimson brown with a soft white head. Smell is complex with dark cherry, oak, and trace basalmic vinegar. Tastes like a sweet tart with fruit and a throat clenching finish. Awesome. Reminds me of Rodenbach and Consecration, but even better. The oak tannin is prominently deep and robust. Big and rich mouthfeel with the combo tart and sweetness along with prickly carbonation and lasting acetic bite. Lots of sediment at the end. This is so enjoyable and worth seeking out."
"Overall this a good beer and worth a try but this one of the few sour styles that i am not so fond of"
"Mouthfeel is good. Well carbonated, but a bit thicker than I would like it to be, since it is not as ""airy"" on the palate. This also brings down its drinkability, though there certainly won't be any problem finishing it."
"D: This one is keeping me intrigued. I'm no expert on Oud Bruins, but I think this is an excellent brew. Highly recommended if you are interested in sour styles."
"A good beer that is teetering on the edge of greatness."
"Thanks again Mikeyv35!"
"D- average"
"D: A really nice oud bruin that balances the vinegar component well. I would definitely pick up another one of these."
"Awesomely drinkable and one I've taken for granted that we've had so readily available in Springfield, Mo for over a year now. Go Norway."
"I love that I have 2 more in the cellar that will hopefully turn more sour with some time."
"D: One of the most pleasantly drinkable Flanders Oud Bruins I've tried."
"Overall, I really liked this one. It was very drinkable for a sour ale. I still don't know how to pronounce the name of this brewery. Why can't they all be as easy as ""Stone"" or ""Bell's""?"
"D - Off the hook for those with the cojones to handle a powerhouse of a sour beer like this one."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip, dark brown with ruby edges, a finger of off-white/tan head that left some minute lacing on the glass. Nice aroma on this one, with the wood notes coming out first, followed up by a pleasant sour and earthiness with maybe a touch of lemon and cherry. Taste is very nice. A good dose of sourness is there, but it's not bracing or overbearing, with a solidly sweet and bready malt backing. There's even an underlying chocolate taste that keeps things very interesting, which melds nicely with the oak and sour. Not much in the way of funk in this brew, but I like that in a Flanders style ale. Light lemon and cherry that were in the nose can be found in the taste, as well as a dash of vinegar. Somewhat sweet at first, but a dry, and sour finish. This is a great starter sour, much akin to the likes of Rodenbach Grand Cru. Medium-full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Not too light, and not too prickly. Overall, this is a solid Flanders Oud Bruin and definitely a great place to start if you're new to sours. Not overly tart and tongue-trashing, but still sour and incredibly drinkable for the high ABV."
"Overall, a really good sour beer. Worth a shot if you see it and a must try for the sour fans."
"Very enjoyable beer here, not too sour but fully flavored. Would be a great entry level sour in my opinion..."
"Drinkability: A solid sour all the way through. I loved this beer! Can't wait to get my hands on another!"
"Drinkability - 8.5% is well-hidden. This is a very nice Oud bruin and a very enjoyable sipper. An outstanding example of the style. Not for the faint of heart!"
"D-This is a decent flanders red overall. The sourness has perhaps faded a bit but this is a great example of an oak aged sour. What is clear about this brew is that it has a higher ABV-which is blatant in the flavor and mouthfeel."
"D- awesome if this wasn't 12 bucks a bottle or I lived in norway I'd be drinking this day and night or up there sometimes just one or the other. 8.5 abv is unfelt. Baller shit for sure."
"Pours a murkey reddish brown color with a small and lasting brownish head. Very acidic in the nose, sour black cherry tartness and wood, lots of wood. A very oaky flavor as well, vinous dark fruits and very acidic, notes of coffee and smokey chocolate malt beneath the sourness. Full bodied, well carbonated for the style, but a bit hard to drink though."
"Bottle shared via fisherman34- pours a muddy brown , not much for head. Nose- big blast of vinegar, dark cherries and some wood. Taste- much more subtle vinegar/acidity in the actual taste, wood brings a nice balance to the sour. Some cherry flavour and malt sweetness. Medium bodied, nice carbonation. tasty stuff"
"D-this is a little hot and the alcohol seems to show a little more than I would prefer. The boddy is solid but sits in the stomach."
"D: I can see why this is a highly regarded brew and while it may not be for me, I have to give credit where credit is due. Strong and upfront with massive unapologetic flavors, this is no doubt a bold beer. Feel is amazing and helps to meld the outherwise out of control sourness. Highly recommended if you like sours but remember this may be unlike any other you've had."
"Overall, I'm glad I got to try this again (not sure what vintage the first one I had was). It's nice to see what this beer is like as it warms to room temp. too - the first time I had it was in the negatives outside!"
"Pours blood red, with a thin tan head. Looks pretty normal for an Oud Bruin. A little clearer than I expected, but, looks alright. The smell has old strawberries, which I've come to know in wild bacteria, but isn't exactly my favorite smell in these, with eggs and vinegar, not quite as vinegary as some in the class. Again, doesn't stand out, isn't particularly bad, and it has the right kind of characteristics, but not my favorite. The taste has oranges, the acidic, very citric part, with a slight bready toastiness, which is slightly unexpected, and nice. It's still very sour, very acidic, but not very tart - if that makes sense, maybe not enough sweetness. The old strawberries come back, which remind me of old food, old fruit, a bit of old cherries. And surprisingly, I can taste a bit of wood. I expected a little more of that pleasant tartness, like young/ripe cherries and strawberries (this tastes overripe, to reiterate), blended with a pleasant sweetness. This kind of works towards what I want, then kind of falls short in taste. Finishes very acidic, it's actually hard to tell whether it's sweet or dry, and that may be the main problem. The body is nice, medium-full, fuller than I expected, moderate carbonation, pleasant for the style. Overall, it's decent, I would maybe have it again, definitely wouldn't pay for it. It's not the most impressive, which means that if I were going to this style, I would probably go to something new, or something else that I like better. I think it may have been a little young, or could've used some blending with an older version."
"D: This beer has everything. Its in your face in the nose, but subtle in the nose. It is sweet, tart, and sour all at the same time. It is one of the most pleasant beers I have had. Its not crazy and its not going to get marks for that, but it will get marks for complexity and subtlety. Its wicked to be honest. It really assaults the senses and I dig that. I can see why Dave is all about this beer. Good stuff and worth the price of admission."
"Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Nice creamy texture, despite the soda-like carbonation, which I enjoyed. Very, very dry finish. Really tasty, and surprisingly drinkable."
"This beer sits like the Hindenburg in your stomach. Carbonation is average. Mouthfeel is a thick for the style. Drinkability is higher than nill just because I get two pours out of this and can finish them. Although I would be happy to drink this on another occasion, I could not drink a second bottle. I don't hate myself that much."
"Overall a great sour I'd happily recommend to anyone who likes sour ales. Oak barrel aging gives it a refined body."
"Introduced this to a friend during this sitting and he loved it. Even more amazing was when I had smoked pork neck with a sauce made from this beer at Olympen in Oslo."
"Man, what a wonderful beer. Don't serve this too cold."
"Pairs very well with food (this style generally does better as part of a meal in my experience) - in this case some goat gouda and a fresh baguette..."
"This is very nicely drinkable. It is sour enough to be interesting, yet not so sour as to pucker your face. The 8.5%abv is exceptionally well-hidden also, which sure doesn't hurt."
"M - Incredibly lively and fizzy."
"D: This was a really nice surprise and I found it very drinkable for a style that even with the best examples it is hard to drink more than 12 oz of. Heres to more wild Norwegian beers."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Definitely a beer worth purchasing"
"D- an interesting beer, but i cant help but think how much more i liked other beers of the style like goudenband. ill check back on this batch in a few years to see how it compares then. but for now this is one and done for me."
"D: I am definitely new to the style, but can find appealing elements to it but can't get past the acrid acidity. I enjoy vinegar and a good balsamic reduction when I'm cooking but don't find it all that pleasant to drink. I really loved the barrel-aged elements of the beer that gave it the earthy/wood like taste. A good representation of the style I'm sure, the sour is pleasant too."
"Tart and vinous with a very prominent dark fruit presence. Hints of plum, raisin and dark cherry with a dry lactic tart sour flavor. Nice earthy oak and subtle vanilla balance out the tart and sweet notes perfectly. While this beer is pretty funky it is very well balanced and the 8.5% ABV is excellently masked. Very complex and dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"50cl bottle brewed 10/10/06. Pours hazy maroon-brown with a small but persistent tan head. Smells quite sour, with both lactic and acetic notes. Very woody and slightly vinous, with some cherry esters. Direct, sour taste that is almost completely lactic with only a hint of vinegar--a pleasant surprise in an Oud Bruin. Again., oakey and tannic. Mineral character. Medium body that really coats. Warming finish, though no real alcohol taste. The best Oud Bruin I've had; ironic that it's Norwegian."
"D: a slow sipper; smooth but quite strong; this is quite drinkable or at least sippable for a sour"
"Haandbakk is a complex and enjoyable beer."
"T/M: Fruity and acetic; this one's got a massive vinegar character, but it's pleasantly balanced by the strong fruit flavors. Rhubarb pie, raspberry-balsamic vinaigrette and stewed cherries come to mind. Medium-full body. The high level of carbonation helps cut through the vinegar, but it never quite achieves a dry mouthfeel. Juicy, fruity finish with lingering balsamic vinegar. Pleasant stuff in small doses."
"drinkability is great. mellow, soft, and a sharp finish come together into a solid sour that creeps up on the palate. very drinkable and supremely drinkable. cheers!"
"A remarkable beer in my opinion. Wish I had more than just one and I will certainly be looking for more."
"Overall: One of the most unique and intriguing beers on the planet, Third brew ive had from them and they have all been unique and enjoyable at the least and fantastic at best. If you can find this buy it impulsively"
"Mouthfeel was zippy and puckering."
"i would have with rabbit... in a red wine balsamic redox with beets but thats just me dreaming."
"D- This is a very tasty beer. The acidity makes it a sipper but this one is welcome in my fridge anytime. Highly recommended!"
"500ml bottle, Batch 49, Brewed Oct 10, 2006. Best by date of April 30, 2011. Wow! What a fantastic beer. I love the all the nuances here and the deft use of oak. Pours a slightly murky brown with a fair head of very tight bubbles. Very nice combo of tannic oak and sour fruit in the nose. The bottle says it was aged in oak barrels previously used for Sherry and Rhubarb wine. You can definitely pick up some Sherry notes, and the use of oak that still carries some Rhubarb is brilliant- the vegetal sourness of the Rhubarb marries beautifully with the sourness of the beer and the tannins from the barrel. The taste is even more complex and intense. Starts out fairly soft and lightly sour, and then the tannins from the oak build into a spicy, woody, crescendo followed by a blast of Rhubarb, some acetic notes, and late barnyard laced with more wood tang. Just superb. The mouthfeel is quite oaky, but softer than you might think with the oak and the sourness in balance and a touch of creaminess to offset the woody blast. As intense as this beer is, I found the flavors so well developed, if not subtle, that I could keep on drinking this for a while. The 8.5% abv is extremely well hidden as well. Extremely well done this one, no shortcuts here. 3 years of aging in barrels with character shows through beautifully. Bravo."
"Pours a very cloudy brown, some reddish tint to it, thin tan head forms and quickly drops to a thin ring, no lacing on the glass but that's expected. Smell is great, very intensely sour, cherries, sugar and bready sweetness in the middle, oak, very acidic, lemons and orange, berries, earthy, crazy intense. Taste is just as good, sour cherries up front, very tart, nice malty middle, rhubarb, lemon acidity, fruit, oak, very earthy and woody, cherry pit bitterness, very sour finish, awesome. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carhonation, crazy good Oud Bruin. One of the better examples of the style I've had, this was great."
"drinkability is good. excellent balance, showing almost no trace of its 8.5% ABV. sourness and acidity are not overpowering yet still contribute well overall. a great flanders brown"
"D- I'm not a HUGE sour fan, which costs the beer some points on that alone, but this is as good as any of the sours that I've had. Honestly, for the money, this is as good as Concecration or even Cuvee de Tomme. Just can't see me drinking it (or Concecration and Cuvee de Tomme for that matter) very often."
"D - This is a highly addictive style, the Sour Ales are growing on me fast, and this one was great, only wish they were in high demand in this part of the country"
"D - The alcohol is incredibly well hidden - I had a bigger problem with the 5.9% Brian Boru earlier today than I did with this one. The aftertaste has a lot of wood to it, but it never gets to be too much. The carbonation is lively, but not bloaty. Love the 500ml serving size too!"
"D: An all-around excellent beer, among the best I've had of this or similar styles; HaandBryggeriet has one to be proud of with Haandbakk. High strength prevents this from the drinkability it might have were it in the 6% ballpark, but it's still so enjoyable...just requires more time (or sipping partners) to consume. Definitely recommended! (Great beer to bring along, Bryce!)"
"Overall, this is a great beer. Good example of a flanders and a great introductory sour beer. I highly recommend it."
"I hope more of this makes it into GA. I don't think my bottles will last me very long."
"Excellent beer to pre-day pre-funk for a day of sours."
"This is a world-class Oud Bruin, my favorite that I've tried. As a sour, period, this one is a success. I would highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a nice sour or wild ale."
"Overall: Admittedly, I'm just starting to get into sour ales. I can say that I really enjoyed this one a lot - more than the Avery Brabant. The major comparison I have thus far is that it's very close to the Jolly Pumpkin La Roja I had a few weeks back. It's fairly easy to drink, but is probably more suitable for sharing. The next time I drink this one I'd definitely love to pair it with some good soft cheese."
"Drinkability: A fine, enjoyable, comparable sour. Recommend provided you're a fan of sour beers."
"500ml bottle $11 (damn!). Dark, dark color, black almost, maybe. Small tan ring of bubbles. It smells like wood, cherries, malts, hint of rubber cement, smells about on par for the style. It tastes like an oud bruin but very subtle. Slight bit of sour, slight bit of wood and and it seems a little harsh to my tongue. I am a sucker for sour beers at this point so I buckled and paid the high price tag, I should have bought a La Folie instead."
"A nice sour ale from HaandBryggeriet. Pours a redwood color with a thin tan head. The nose has tart fruits, sweet malts, oak and a subtle musty funk. Tatse is a nice balance of the sweet malts and tart fruity flavors. Could use more of a manure/famyard presence. Crisp body feels full on the palate and has an acidic finish. Good stuff."
"This is a truly great beer. I am a huge fan of the style and this is one of the best I have had. Just blown away..."
"Picked this one up on my trip to florida as I had heard very good things about it. Cracked it the other night as I was in the mood for a nice sour. Served chilled in a tulip this one was consumed on 03/05/2009. The pour was very nice with a rich medium brown color and a nice light tan head on top. Nearly opaque with some light reddish touches to the sides and bottom. Deep horse funk on the nose with apple vinegar and ripe sour apples dominating the aroma with some light oak notes as it warmed. The flavor was crisp tart and very full. Ripe apples and sour fruits just ripping through the mouth. Puckeringly good here with a great carbonation level and really solid body all around. Some nice notes of oak as it warms and a rich sour ale really comes to life. Overall a fantastic beer I will gladly buy again."
"Drinkability: with it's masked alcohol (not tasted at all) this scores incredibly high with the drinkability, with it's only retraction being the lack of balance between the tart and the body."
"A very pleasant surprise. Excellent stuff. This rivals any very good Flanders Red I've had. I'll be buying more."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all the time, the flavor is awesome. The only place I fault this beer is consistency. Everytime I have this brew, it always tastes slightly different. I figure this is brew is done in small batches using multiple barrels, and each of those barrels have their own character, but this beer is all over the place. Some bottles - all from the same batch - have been more sweet and fruity, more sour, or more oaky. Overall, very tasty."
"Overall: Although their darkforce imperial wheat stout is my favorite offering this may take second place. It is a very interesting sour and I really enjoy what the oak-aging does for it. It's a little spendy but definitely worth it, my only regret is not sharing this with anyone."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with gorgeous red highlights. Thick lacing clings tightly to the glass. Smells of green apples, sour cherries, and juicy natural funk make for an amazing nose. First sip is puckering tart. The green apples and sour cherries combine with the wild yeast to create an incredible taste. Sherry and oak flavors support this beer and enhance the flavor. As it warms the sourness increases. The mouthfeel really stands out as the beer treats my tongue like a dance floor. I'm guessing this is bottled conditioned. I am grateful Norway's beer is better than her politics. Haandbakk is among my favorite sour ales."
"The balance of the sweetness in the taste makes this one more drinkable than many of the lambics I've tasted. Tasty."
"Overall I thought this was more along the lines of an Oud Bruin than anything, and a good one it was. Pick this one up if you see it around, and thanks again to ATLBeerdog for sharing this."
"Awesome."
"D - Spectacularly drinkable. I am quite partial to flemmish sour beers and this is one of the best that I have ever had. The sour, spicy aroma is spot on and the flavor is complex and satisfying in a way that makes me truly sorry I did not get another bottle of this when I had the chance."
"Batch 49. Brewed 10/10/06. Without a doubt, this is exceptional beer that has been brewed with the utmost care and skill. It is also seems like a fairly unique flavor even among sours, not that I've been lucky enough to have sampled too many. The beer tastes strongly of oak and is very tart. The tartness is sour cherry with a vinous character. I had a small glass of champagne earlier, and the flavor of this beer is closer to that than to a lot of other beers. You can just really taste the oak barrel, and that oak makes things quite dry. The pucker is much more complex than I'm used to. I imagine the beer would age incredibly well. The alcohol isn't felt in the least behind the enormous tart flavor. It's definitely a sipping beer. I have no idea what it could possibly be paired with, food-wise. I can barely taste anything but the beer after that pucker. It could be good as an ingredient in a dish rather than a pairing. It's an expensive beer, but it's good enough to justify the price. I mean I'm not going to go out and buy a case, but I definitely want to try as many different beers from this brewery as possible and it would be a great gift to any fan of sours."
"(3.7/5)"
"This bottle said this was batch 49, brewed on 10.10.06 and best by 30.04.11. It poured a dark brown with purple highlights and a small tan head that quickly turned into a ring. The nose has plums, a load of sour cherry, and I think there is some vanilla. The taste has a nice tartness without being puckering, there is a lactic twinge had a sweetness hidden in between the cherry tart start and finish. The finish is real dry with a hint of lingering cherry. Overall very tasty."
"D: Really reminiscent of a flanders and the alcohol is masked perfectly. A really refreshing brew, though you'd likely only want to share one of these due to the acidity."
"D- Very drinkable. The 8.5% is a tad high but i would have no problem drinking two bottles in a sitting. This brew does not get boring and i will be seeking it out in the future. Not sure if i would classify it as a unblended lambic, but what do i know."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle (Batch 49, Brewed 10.10.06) and served in a tulip. This beer poured a dark mahogany hue with a two-finger thick head of tan foam that lingered for a bit. Some slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma of the beer included cherry pits, wet oak, fermented fruits, cider vinegar, and also a touch of alcohol. The flavor consisted of caramel, rasins, sour cherries, and oak. While moderately sweet, there is a nice sourness that helps even things out. Slightly puckering. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had light carbonation. This is some fantastic stuff!"
"It's funny, I'd forgotten this was aged in rhubarb wine casks. The first thing that popped to my mind was a rhubarb tart! Moderately acetic with plenty of fruit, some red wine, a little bit of sherry, and a rather rotten meat-like character I've found in some Flemish reds. I don't typically care for this character, but in this minimal amount, it is compelling and enjoyable. The palate is a lot sourer than I'd like, with a clean red wine vinegar character, almost enough to clean the sinuses. The problem with some of these overly acetic beers is that a little bit of oxidation makes them feel flabby on the palate, as well as a little soapy. Sherry and rhubarb are noticeable, especially on the mid-palate. Drying, acetic on the finish with some strong lactic character as well, this beer is moderately carbonated. Too acetic for my palate, I wish I'd drunk this a while back. 4.5/4/3/3/3.5"
"Drinkability is pretty high, it's tasty and goes down easily. Still, it's on the sour, stronger side, and not something I can have probably more then a second bottle of in one sitting! Still, I'm glad I still have another, and wish more were available, even though it's not the best priced oud bruin out there."
"Note to self - take emerge077's advice and buy more than 1 bottle next time he recommends it."
"You can't tell the 8.5abv so this is a high drinkability brew."
"Add this to your want list!!"
"Thank you, Hand Brewery. Soft pound to you."
"mmm. . . . . did duchesse get married to the king of boon geuze??? i must brag that i am the first person in north carolina to sip on this sour, velvety goodness - well - he told me i was the first. it said ""sour", i said ""baby, please, i must have it. . . i love norway"" so all i have to say is i love it on this indian summer november night."
"This is a nice example of a Sour Brown; it captures the richness yet quaffability that is requisite of the style. Definitely quite tasty!"
"D: Whoo boy! What a beer. Almost like what a more tangy and sour version of New Glarus Raspberry Tart would taste like. I'm in awe!"
"Lambics are acidic, and if I found a lambic I could drink all day I probably wouldn't like it. After one of these 500ml beers, I don't want any more. But I still think it's wonderful. I'll have another tomorrow, please."
"2014; revisiting the 2013 batch... close to zero carbonation, though plenty of tannic oak, dried fruit and cheese rind notes. Really takes a hit due to the watery mouthfeel. It's good for what it is, straight from the barrel, but they could carb it up easily with priming sugar, etc."
"Overall, this is very good beer. One of my favorites thus far of this style."
