"Great sour.  The sour level is near perfect and then a nice brown ale base in there to round it out."

"Pretty bummed this guy was basically flat. Great flavor overall but always tough to really judge a brew without the proper mouthfeel."

"3.0 D: Hard to put this beer at anywhere other than average. It has potential and will probably be a lot better next time if they reuse the same barrels, but it definitely needs some more body, better carbonation, and a lot more time with the bugs."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its easiness and drinkability for the style. Starting from the aroma, from the very beginning things started out well blended. You get pretty much all the components at once, offering immediate complexity, depth, and warmth through all of the solid woodiness, sourness, and maltiness. I actually had to remind myself to take sips every now and again, in between having my nose constantly to the bottom of the glass. The flavoring followed beautifully, but was unique for the style in the sense of how clean it was. There was just enough residual dextrin sweetness to balance the immense pucker and bite of not only the yeast, but of the wood too, without tipping the scales in the overly malty direction. The soft slurp helped to ease some of this bitterness as well, making it undeniably palatable. This is a fantastic, well-blended beer, and we are so grateful to have gotten to drink it."
"a solid beer. post drinking reflection on this leads me to remembering its smell as its best feature. although there is a sexy semitransparent reddish color and oatmeal tinted inch of head, all I can think about is the nose, which was just so sour, acidic, and welcomed. been saving this one for just the right occasion, and finally it came today. id call this more of a Flemish red than an oud bruin, but whats it really matter? the nose is dry red malt, bacterial yeasts, and a sour cherry or raspberry touch that's more jammy than fresh fruit. plenty of acid in the feel, its obvious before any real flavor sets in, but there is plenty of oak, piquant yeast, and residual sugar in this beer. its amazing how drinkable this is, as the sourness doesn't suck all the moisture out of your mouth like some, and the fruit is way way back there, like you have to dig to find it. maybe a little too acidic in terms of feel, but the carbonation is right on, and at just past 7% abv, I could comfortably drink this all day. I think an exemplary version of the Flemish red style, so interesting that its listed otherwise, but that happens. nose is its best feature, but sensational all around. if squatters had better distribution this would be world renowned. nearly full marks."

"O: great surprise. By far the best offering from Squatters or Wasatch I've had. Very strong flavors that have an awesome complexity."

"We've been funkified! Lacto, Pedio and other wild beasts sat in a barrel with this beer for 529 days, and it shows! So complex and interesting. A damn fine example of the sour beer movement thatâ€™s currently tempting palates in the US today."

"Overall: I wasn't a big fan of this one. Couldn't make up its mind between a flanders red and an oud bruin, and the medicinal fruit character was detracting."

"O - Good overall, missing some of the fruitiness I'd expect in the style, especially the cherry aspects, but has a nice sourness/tartness, tons of funk (which I really enjoy). Fairly simple flavor profile overall, but still very enjoyable."
""
"This is an amazing beer, as good as any of the Oud Bruins I've tried. I highly recommend it to lovers of the style, and also to those wishing to discover this style at its most easy drinking."
"This is medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is a very sharp and acidic. There is lots of depth of flavor but at this time I dont feel like it blends together very well. I am a huge fan of sour/wilds but this one just didn't do it for me. I nearly couldn't finish my glass and even when tackling the rest of the bottle that noone else wanted, I still had a rough time finishing it after sampling a few other beers."

"Overall, a nice beer. A good amount of sour here. Decent drinkability."
"Flavors of apple butter, dried tart cherry, somewhat cidery but balanced with a mild sourness overall. Light oak dryness, wet straw, and smooth malty flavors blend seamlessly with it's fruity tart overtones. Low on vinegar/acetone if at all. Pretty clean and balanced. Drinkability is high, as the palate acclimates to the mellow sourness easily. Will seek out my own bottle in the future... a perfect beer for the autumn season."
"O- This was an enjoyable sour, really tasty and easy drinking, great palate cleanser for the epic tasting we were partaking in."
"Bottle. Pours a copper red color with a light tan collared head. Nice aroma of caramel, sour fruit, acetone, and oak. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Apple and cherry notes in the flavor along with some earthiness. Some white grape too. No real booze notes to mention which is surprising given the ABV. A real easy drinking sour. Nice."
"Thanks, douglas88 (from the other site), for the opportunity and to JohnGalt1, for the chance to re-visit"
"D-A solid Flanders Red for sure, especially for Utah! A bit muddled and could use some tweaking but quite nice as it is."
"O - This one was pretty good. It could use a bit more tartness but it really isn't a big deal. It is nothing mind blowing, just a solid Flanders."
"I'm starting to dig these sour offerings from Squatters. I hope they make some more."
"Well this seems like a good start, really enjoyed this unfortunately I don't have much else to compare it to. Very enjoyable experience though."
"Not a bad oud bruin, particularly for those who like them more sour. The champagne yeast gives it an interesting lighter character."
"Overall - After being a little let-down by the Root Cellar last night, the 529 was impressive. Not bracingly sour, this is more of a harmonious and balanced sourness. As mentioned above, the cork can be tricky, and mine was a (slow) gusher. Be ready with a glass."
"Bottle, thanks footbalm! Pours a copper maroon with a large fluffy head. Sour and funky, bretty, oaky nose. Red berries and light sweat. Quite sour in the mouth, a very upfront kind of sourness. A tad metallic on the finish. Sour cranberries and a bit citrusy. Nice mouthfeel, spritzy carbonation. A bit one-dimensional in its sour element, I would like to see more dryness with a cleaner finish. Some brett does shine on the back end. This is pretty good and is better than a fair amount of American interpretations on the style."
"An underrated gem."
"Reviewed on 5/28/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear light brown with a thick, foamy off-white head. Aroma of light fruits including cherry, a hint of oak, malty sweetness, and a hint of sour funk. Flavor of sour cherry and malt. Pretty drinkable and tasty, although not as complex as I would have liked. Solid sour though."
"Poured into a chalice a nice orange/red color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty/yeasty, with some oak notes, cherries. The taste is malty/yeasty, funky, nice cherry notes, with a nice touch of oak. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice tasty brew."
"D: An overall good beer. Not astonishing, and I do wish it was more tart, but enjoyable and almost necessary on a day like Black Tuesday."
"D - This was quite enjoyable. I refilled my glass and would definitely have this again. A pleasant surprise from Squatter's and competitive with other US Flanders Oud Bruins."
"M - Light, champagne-esk carbonation, fizzy, semi-dry finish. Overall, very solid and holds it own against Red Poppy and the like."
"Overall, an exceptional Oud Bruin that I most highly recommend if you can find it. You always hear that Utah is a beer desert with the beer laws,etc but this blows that perception away. Hell it makes me want to do a road trip and soon! Excellent beer and look forward to the other Squatters brew that he sent me. Not available here in TX - got from Matt. Rotation - if here and not a limited release, it would be in the sour rotation as a regular. As is, I'll need to get some more shipped before they sell out. [R;Y;ship]"
"3.5/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Tasted from 750mL bottle at Lush CBC event. Pours cloudy brown with sediment and a thin, lace white head. Nose is sour with some sulfur, brett funk, burnt rubber, and pitted fruit. Flavors are of sour apricot, peach, and red wine vinegar. Body and carbonation are medium with a great pitted fruit finish. The sulfur is a bit of a problem on the nose, but the fruitiness of this beer is awesome."
"As the beer warms up a very soft sweetness starts to become noticeable, it is mostly dominated by the tartness here, but does help to boost the fruit character just a touch more. A second pour sees me noticing more raspberry flavors than I did before as well as some more non-descript berry flavors. I am finally noticing the oak character in the nose as well with a general spiciness as well as a nice oak-plank woodiness. This is quite tasty, it is perhaps lacking a touch more complexity, but this is certainly no slouch. I like the subtleness of the oak here, it is quite well integrated and really accentuates the other flavors as opposed to showing them up."
"D: Wow, this beer is hard to not drink. I feel guilty for not sharing this with anyone, but at the same time will have no problem drinking the whole 750. The thing I like about this beer is that the sour is incredibly noticeable, but doesn't dominate the beer, the malt shines and you can even notice a few hops, which makes this incredible. Highly recommended, and I'm extremely happy I bought a second bottle to lay down. Great work Squatters!"
