Head remains throughout the majority of the drink and leaves a few lace lines on the glass.  Intense acidic aroma, mostly berries.  Nice touch of oak in the nose as well.  Flavor begins with a heavy dose of acetic acid imparting berry, vinegar and cider notes.  Just a hint of sweetness and cherry flavor mid drink.  Finishes dry with a gentle touch of wine and oak to mellow out the flavor.  Medium body and bone-dry feel with ample carbonation.  Perfect mouthfeel.  I don't even know where to begin with this beer.  It seems that every big purchase I make on a new sour ale turns into a home run and this one is a grand slam!  So much depth and complexity yet super well balanced and easy to drink. Just an all around stellar beer!","bnes09","Dec 01, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, caramel, toast, musty funk, pepper, light leather, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, caramel, toast, musty funk, pepper, light leather, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, caramel, toast, oak, vanilla, musty funk, light leather, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited wild ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 08, 2014"

In the taste, nice acetic sourness and plenty of depth to it as well. A solid base beer is behind the sourness, with sugar plum, cherry and berry notes. This plays nicely with the oak and the sour. Everything is in good balance and the flavor really pops. Body is medium and semi dry with a lingering sour note. Overall, this is a really nice American Wild or Flanders Red. It kind of reminds me of a kriek lambic, not a surprise due to the Michigan cherries employed here. Good to savor every sip.","Stinkypuss","Jul 16, 2014"

Expected tart, vinegar components but also loads of cherries and fruit as well. A musty, bready component is there as well. Love just holding my nose over the glass. Flavors are spectacular and I feel is far superior than previous batches. Long sweet cherry finish that outlasts the zippy sour flavors that hit up front. Great Brett component as well. I really like this and think the overall score is not doing it justice.","kingston2","May 23, 2014"

4.43,6.2,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I thought this was a great example of a Sour or American Wild Ale, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style, it was pretty sour, but it didn't seem too acidic and the complexity kept me coming back for more. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little mouth puckering, not too acidic, pretty crisp, not too filling and the taste did a great job of holding my attention, it was sour, but the flavors kept me coming back for more and I think this would be an awesome beer to enjoy on a nice summer afternoon, I think one bottle would be my limit and it's a good beer to split, but it tastes so good I'll have no problem drinking the whole bottle. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style and complex it was, it's just what I want in a good sour. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but the head and lacing could have been a little better, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I would for sure buy this beer, I will be trying hard to track down some of the new batch and I would love to try this fresh and have a couple for the cellar. I highly recommend trying this beer if you like tart and sour beers, I think it's a must try and I'm glad a friend recommended it to me, thanks Ben. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed, this is one well crafted beer and it really came through in almost all aspects of this beer. I'm glad I traded for this beer and so far I think it's right up there with Juliet and Lolita as my favorites from this series ans it's up there as one of the best sours I've had so far. This made for a great beer to mark 900 reviews and somehow I'm going to have to find a way to go even bigger for my 1000th review. Great job guys, this was one fantastic beer, keep up the awesome work.","StoutHunter","May 02, 2014"

There is also more acetic acid than I prefer (probably common for the style). The finish is a little short and mouthfeel a bit thin. However, the beer is very enjoyable and a decent representation of the style. The balance of sweet and sour is excellent and it is very sessionable. This one is worth a try but if you are saving this I would drink it now.","brianmandell","Feb 28, 2014"

4.64,11.3,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"the best oud bruin ive ever had, if we can even fairly call it that, and easily the most enjoyable brew from goose island for me, including a few bourbon county variants. special beer here. more red than brown in color, fairly light and see through, with soda like carbonation and an inch or less of off white fizz head. the nose on this is awesome, bretty, as funky as it is sour, the cherries are authentic but not too sweet, the base beer is true to style, and the cabernet barrels have left their mark with a fruity tannic kick. i also smell something uniquely floral, vegetal flowers, lush and in bloom. the flavor of this beer blew me away, my favorite in a long lineup of excellent beers. i do get the oud bruin malt profile, but its dressed up in tart cherries as bright as day, and mellowed with a refined oak profile that includes vanilla and all kinds of brett charcter. its sour sure, but not too acidic like some can be. its only a gentle sour, drying but not burning, elegant beer. i also get the floral thing in the flavor, like biting the head off a fresh bright red tulip, its vibrant and wet and the embodiment of captured sunlight. this beer is so complex, so layered, so intricately put together that its bringing me all the way back to the first time i had consecration. im not sure i have been as impressed with a beer since. i could not imagine a better flavor profile or feel. the cherries, the brett, the cab barrels, its all so well done. i will remember this bottle fondly for a long time, and eagerly await the opportunity to drink another one. this was the last in a night of maybe 25 beers, and it was so darn good it made me sober. mind blown.","StonedTrippin","Dec 30, 2013"

It's like a watered down, soured-down La Folie, which I believe is an almost perfect example of this style. It may have been the age (almost 1.5 years since bottling) that caused the cherry flavor to seriously fade. I think this one is better fresh based off its current score of a 98 here on BA. No hard feelings - I still love you, Goose Island. Cheers!","oN3xM","Dec 12, 2013"

Little head was produced by this one, as would be expected for the style. In the initial taste, one can detect bitter cherry, dry tartness, grape skin, and tart cherry hints at the back of the throat towards the end. The sour notes linger in the aftertaste but are quickly brushed away in the aftertaste by the carbonation. I never really detected much of the barrel aging in this one. It seemed more like a Flanders with more intense cherry notes. It is a better than average interpretation of the style.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 15, 2013"

This guy keeps things fresh and smooth to the end, with robust sourness to the nose and taste, but without going overboard.

The sweet cherries pack a bigger punch than expected cutting down dramatically on the beer's mild tartness. The taste plays out the same, except for providing a touch more oak and vinegar. It's definitely a tasty oud bruin that yanks on the standard subtle cherry characteristics of the style and makes them a true asset to the beer. The aftertaste is mildly drying, almost negligible by comparison, and leaves little flavor lingering. It's sweet body is cut by a mild tartness, but there very little Brett funk...maybe it's weakness is that it's a bit too mild, or possibly served a bit too cold. Regardless, it's redlined, drinkable, reasonable priced/available, and made by the lovely A-B InBev...who have never messed up a beer before.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 16, 2012"

Head stayed around for a bit, but there isn't much lacing. Aroma is mostly tart, the brew smells like tart cherries, wood, red wine, and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and pretty easy to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, definitely worth a try. But it is pricey at $15.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Nov 16, 2012"

There's a solid shot of tart cherries and lactic aromas and a hint of vanilla and vinegar. The flavor is sweet and a little brown sugary up front but that changes rapidly. Lactic tart and bready funk come in right away to sweep out and residual sweetness. Tart cherries and lemons are faint flavors but they are there amid a hint of oak and vanilla.

3.75,-10.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a deep candied brown with light ruby hints to it and a light eggshell-white head on top that fades quickly leaving little to no lacing. The body of the beer is dark and opaque; leaving one to guess what might be inside of it, though little carbonation bubbles can be seen dancing to the top of the glass. On the nose, the beer has some great sour cherry notes that hint at fruit leather and vinegar, and heavily remind me of the Bruery’s Oude Tart. Light notes of brown sugar and bready malt can be picked up, but are really faint in comparison to the sour cherry. Light spices can also be found in the sour smell. The initial sip of the beer begins with prickling sour that opens into big cherry and leather fruit notes before hinting at fruit-rollups towards the end of the middle and closing out as a faint sour tingle. The taste is actually surprisingly simplistic and I’m really just getting a lot of cherry sour with faint hints at the wine barrels that the beer sat in. The taste is lighter and less mouth puckering than other sours I have sampled, which makes this beer more acceptable for table pairings as it won’t ruin the tastes of the food. As it warms the beer also bring more of its malt character into play, and though it is still light it hints at caramel and bread notes. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, though I think that is actually helpful with this beer, especially in terms of making it a table pairing beer. Carbonation is quite prickly at the start but that dies down to just leave the tongue a little numbed but cleans the palate. The mouth is actually left rather neutral after the beer has left it, with a very slight sour lingering, and some saliva on the sides of the tongue while the middle sits slightly dry yet still moist. Overall my feelings are neutral on this beer. I have not had an Oud Bruin before, so my judgment of it comes more from the Flanders Red Style, which is supposed to be similar but sourer. I’m intrigued with how the beer allows for more pairing options with lighter food, but really the beer did not blow me away. A lovely sipper, and I great for the table, but nothing overly special with this beer","Maxwell","Oct 21, 2012"

It pours a dark faux-murky ruby-garnet topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. Not all that much to look at, though, until it was held up to the light. The nose comprises dank/slightly tart cherry, light caramel/maple syrup (I couldn't untangle the two), and a touch of general earthiness. The taste holds notes of sweeter-than-usual cranberries, light tart cherry pit, light earthy greens, and a smattering of vague sweetness running beneath it all. Honestly, this aspect let me down a little, especially considering the pedigree of her sisters. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, but one that just didn't live up to expectations. There was hardly any appreciable tartness of any kind, the cherries came through somewhat muted (even transmogrified at times), and the whole thing came across as just too sweet for its own good (and, mind you, this is without coming across as sweet in any absolute sense whatsoever, only a relative one based on the style/expectations/whatnot). It's still generally enjoyable, but nothing to really celebrate too much.","TMoney2591","Sep 27, 2012"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Muddy amber with red highlights. The small head dissipates completely after a short time. Nice sweet and sour cherry aroma, fleshy and earthy with a backing of earthy brett funk. Thin, dry body. Pleasant lactic sourness, some vinous fruitiness. Tart cherry finish, quite mild but very enjoyable.","largadeer","Mar 16, 2011"
4.35,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Very nice wild, cherry ale. Not very complex or aggressive.","JamnesCameron","Mar 15, 2011"
3.69,-11.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"O- Overall, this is a pretty good American Wild Ale. I found the serving size to be a bit much- would much rather see this in 12oz bottles. I would revisit this, but would not go out of my way to land another bottle.","ShogoKawada","Mar 14, 2011"
4.1,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Excellent brew from Goose Island. This is the best ""wild"" beer that I have had from them. I will be sure to pick up a couple more this week.","Neffbeer","Mar 14, 2011"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed from notes. Pours a nice reddish-brown with a good white head with nice retention and a bit of lacing. The nose brings forward a good bit of oak along with some vibrant cherries and a bit of citrus. Good lactic presence throughout. The flavor is equally a nice with the fruit really coming through alongside a nice complementary oak character. Feel is slightly tannic with some sourness and a dry finish. Really drinkable. Solid hit from the Goose.","Thorpe429","Mar 09, 2011"
4.15,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Easy drinking for a sour (but only if that's what you're into). This is a very nicely balanced oud bruin, and I really like that it's a little bit more on the sour side than a traditional Belgian (Rodenbach, Monk's Cafe, etc.).","stimulus","Mar 06, 2011"

3.97,-4.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Juicy and sour cherries, distinctly fruity, savory. Dry oaky tannins in the finish, a distinct cherry pit dryness. Lingering natural cherry in the aftertaste. Ample carbonation, it becomes creamy after the initial sour/tangy bite. Light and spritzy, nice for a Wild Ale, less so as an Oud Bruin. Very juicy and quenching, the dryness encourages frequent sipping. Age it longer to develop more Brett character, blend old and young batches, this will be a winner. Rodenbach Grand Cru still has a corner on the market though.","emerge077","Mar 03, 2011"
3.94,-5.5,3,4,4,4,4,"M/D - Medium body on this one that finishes about as dry as a beer can get. Lots of carbonation on this one but goes well with the dryness. Super easy to drink if you don't mind the palate getting sucked dry with each sip and the simplicity of complex ingredients make this beer a treat to drink.","VaTechHopHead","Feb 26, 2011"

4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"overall - very pleased with this, and happy i have another bottle to try in a couple years. at this point its nothing outstanding, but it is a very solid oud bruin.","levifunk","Jan 22, 2011"
4.17,0,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Goose Island has certainly taken a page from Allagash on their presentation of this bottle, looks nice. Poured into a rodenbach glass and presents itself an orangish red with brown around the edges and thin white ring of foam that leaves no lacing. Sounds better then it looks! Aroma is somewhat muted but complex. Vanilla, cherry, some acetic quality and light hay approach the nose. Round malty body, backed up by tart cherry and slight funk, but more acetic. A little vanilla and a touch of spice. I could drink mounds of this stuff, easy to drink with great quafability, thanks Goose Island.","pmlondrigan","Jan 20, 2011"
3.88,-7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"An Ouid Bruin style aged on cherries in cabernet barrels. To quote my buddy Andy, ""There's no nose on this rose"". Super dry with a funky oak and peat sourness. Lovely Brettyanomyces asserting a classic Belgian flare, but the clean flavor remains distinctly American.","burnheartsMKE","Jan 14, 2011"
4.1,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is quite drinkable. I can foresee this becoming better in a few months... Once the tartness opens up and the Brett kicks in more dry funk, this beer will certainly improve in all aspects... I cam only imagine how this review improves in a few months...","AleWatcher","Jan 06, 2011"
3.88,-7,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pretty good beer overall. Fruitiness could be intensified a bit, and the acidity could be toned down, but I still enjoyed this beer. Glad I didn't love it, cause then I'd have to try to find some more...","hawks10","Jan 02, 2011"
3.7,-11.3,4,4,3.5,3,4,"D - This is solid, not great. Fairly easy to get down, but wouldn't seek this out at the prices it is at.","AgentZero","Jan 02, 2011"
4.54,8.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Another stellar beer from the Goose Island Vintage Reserves. What strikes me most about this beer is its balance, everything is in harmony. While some Belgium beers of this style demonstrate more complexity you would be hard pressed to find a more pleasant drinking experience. Unlike the Juliet, I would be more comfortable ageing this beer as I think the secondary characteristics will balance nicely with the fruit.","TriGuy20","Jan 02, 2011"
3.82,-8.4,2.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"This isn't bad, a good tasting but plain oud, just nothing going on worthy of spending $29.","jrallen34","Dec 05, 2010"
4.63,11,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nice dark brownish red with minimal head. Slight aroma of cherries nothing intense. At first sip I am surprised as this was a "" brown ale"". It has a nice tangy cherry taste. Perhaps a little watery. Not too much fruit, not too much sour. Not a perfect brew... Seems like it is missing something just not sure what. overall tho Drinkability is excellent. Worth a try. I will have another please","FullObs","Nov 06, 2010"

4.57,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"drinkability is excellent. exactly what a flanders oud briun should be. this is a near perfect concoction of fruit, sour and sweet notes that is not overly concentrated or overbearing, but just right in all areas. cheers!","botham","0"
