"Tastes like your favorite Flanders Red, but a little bit thinner and paper-y.  Nice cherry, pleasant tart.  Was a 2012 bottle enjoyed early 2015."
""
""
""
""
""
"2010 consumed in 2015. Benefited beautifully from age. Mellow, tannic, still a great cherry presence, subtle funky."
""
"O: Very good rendition of a wild ale, but perhaps I should have aged it to give it funk/unique character. As it was, enjoyable, but middling as far as top-tier sours go."
""
""
""
"Tart cherry, faint wine presence and Belgian funk. A very good sour."
""
"D - Very easy to drinK!"
""
""
""
"A bit too much brett character for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When fresh, the aroma is sweet, floral, and somewhat subtle. Flavor is phenolic, with a respectable sour quality. Five years aging increases the sourness considerably, revealing an acetic acid dominance, with floral hops highlighted in the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had the 2012 vintage of this beer."
""
"Overall probably just a bit too lactic forward for it's own good. The tasty cherries and wine barrels are a bit drowned out by the sourness towards the end for me. Funkyness and sours are well done, however."

"Appearance is a blend of hazy orange, red and brown with a candy hue.  Finger of head after a moderate pour.  Head remains throughout the majority of the drink and leaves a few lace lines on the glass.  Intense acidic aroma, mostly berries.  Nice touch of oak in the nose as well.  Flavor begins with a heavy dose of acetic acid imparting berry, vinegar and cider notes.  Just a hint of sweetness and cherry flavor mid drink.  Finishes dry with a gentle touch of wine and oak to mellow out the flavor.  Medium body and bone-dry feel with ample carbonation.  Perfect mouthfeel.  I don't even know where to begin with this beer.  It seems that every big purchase I make on a new sour ale turns into a home run and this one is a grand slam!  So much depth and complexity yet super well balanced and easy to drink. Just an all around stellar beer!"

"On tap at Fleur in Las Vegas. I was surprised to see this on tap for $6 because I thought 750's were like $22, must be the only good deal in Vegas. Dark reddsih brown, short head. Nice smell of oak, tart fruit, definitely has a touch of funk. Flavor is mildly sour, tart, berries, wood. All in all this was a nice surprise."

"I've had this beer fresh and this one 2 years old. This one kills the fresh beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown color. Has a one-finger beige head. Big sour fruit and light vinegar aroma. Strong sour and tart flavor that lasts from initial taste to finish. Can taste dark cherries, wild berries, and wood. Medium bodied. Finishes sour but with a touch of yeast and earth. Really good beer and one of the best sours I've had."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/31/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, caramel, toast, musty funk, pepper, light leather, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, caramel, toast, musty funk, pepper, light leather, light vanilla, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, red grape, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, grass, caramel, toast, oak, vanilla, musty funk, light leather, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited wild ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, cherries, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This is probably the most actually sour, sour beer I have had from goose Island. Reminiscent of Rodenbach. Very, very good."

"D:  A fantastic Flanders and a great start for me into this style.  Simply magical much so that I really found no flaws here.  I don’t understand why this one doesn’t score higher in the ratings.  The balance of everything was in perfect harmony for me.  Perhaps the 2 years of aging has done this one proper.  I think I would gravitate towards the Madame over quite a few other wilds like say RR Supplication or Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus.  Would have this one over and over again if I could.  Permawant!"

"Pours a light reddish amber color with a white head. The aroma is fruity, sweet and sour and a bit oaky. Inviting and quality funky aroma. In the taste, nice acetic sourness and plenty of depth to it as well. A solid base beer is behind the sourness, with sugar plum, cherry and berry notes. This plays nicely with the oak and the sour. Everything is in good balance and the flavor really pops. Body is medium and semi dry with a lingering sour note. Overall, this is a really nice American Wild or Flanders Red. It kind of reminds me of a kriek lambic, not a surprise due to the Michigan cherries employed here. Good to savor every sip."

"Pours a deep ruddy color with light head that quickly faded to light lacing. The nose is so complex. Expected tart, vinegar components but also loads of cherries and fruit as well. A musty, bready component is there as well. Love just holding my nose over the glass. Flavors are spectacular and I feel is far superior than previous batches. Long sweet cherry finish that outlasts the zippy sour flavors that hit up front. Great Brett component as well. I really like this and think the overall score is not doing it justice."

""

"At over $25 a bottle, I found this to be quite good but not necessarily worth the money. The aroma is great, but I wanted more ""layers"" in the flavor profile, like more fruit and Belgian brown characteristics."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I thought this was a great example of a Sour or American Wild Ale, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style, it was pretty sour, but it didn't seem too acidic and the complexity kept me coming back for more. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little mouth puckering, not too acidic, pretty crisp, not too filling and the taste did a great job of holding my attention, it was sour, but the flavors kept me coming back for more and I think this would be an awesome beer to enjoy on a nice summer afternoon, I think one bottle would be my limit and it's a good beer to split, but it tastes so good I'll have no problem drinking the whole bottle. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style and complex it was, it's just what I want in a good sour. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, but the head and lacing could have been a little better, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I would for sure buy this beer, I will be trying hard to track down some of the new batch and I would love to try this fresh and have a couple for the cellar. I highly recommend trying this beer if you like tart and sour beers, I think it's a must try and I'm glad a friend recommended it to me, thanks Ben. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed, this is one well crafted beer and it really came through in almost all aspects of this beer. I'm glad I traded for this beer and so far I think it's right up there with Juliet and Lolita as my favorites from this series ans it's up there as one of the best sours I've had so far. This made for a great beer to mark 900 reviews and somehow I'm going to have to find a way to go even bigger for my 1000th review. Great job guys, this was one fantastic beer, keep up the awesome work."

"I'd like to try this one fresher. I feel that the fruit has fallen off and there is some oxidation. There is also more acetic acid than I prefer (probably common for the style). The finish is a little short and mouthfeel a bit thin. However, the beer is very enjoyable and a decent representation of the style. The balance of sweet and sour is excellent and it is very sessionable. This one is worth a try but if you are saving this I would drink it now."

"Overall pretty nice, great souring bacteria mix, nice dark soured malts blended with a fresher malt, nice balance of the malt vinegar and regular malt flavors with nice cherry, and a great barrel balance and flavor. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very, very good, not so sour, sour style beer. The cherries and Brett combine to provide a very unique flavor profile for the style. I think this one was probably more tart and sour when it was fresh, but by no means has this beer dropped off, it's just aged gracefully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too simple to be a world-class offering, but this still hits the sour taste buds like a champ. I imagine this would be more balanced (read: more cherry-forward) fresh; I'd certainly buy it again to find out."

"Good example of the style but nothing really jumped up a grabbed a hold of me."

"the best oud bruin ive ever had, if we can even fairly call it that, and easily the most enjoyable brew from goose island for me, including a few bourbon county variants. special beer here. more red than brown in color, fairly light and see through, with soda like carbonation and an inch or less of off white fizz head. the nose on this is awesome, bretty, as funky as it is sour, the cherries are authentic but not too sweet, the base beer is true to style, and the cabernet barrels have left their mark with a fruity tannic kick. i also smell something uniquely floral, vegetal flowers, lush and in bloom. the flavor of this beer blew me away, my favorite in a long lineup of excellent beers. i do get the oud bruin malt profile, but its dressed up in tart cherries as bright as day, and mellowed with a refined oak profile that includes vanilla and all kinds of brett charcter. its sour sure, but not too acidic like some can be. its only a gentle sour, drying but not burning, elegant beer. i also get the floral thing in the flavor, like biting the head off a fresh bright red tulip, its vibrant and wet and the embodiment of captured sunlight. this beer is so complex, so layered, so intricately put together that its bringing me all the way back to the first time i had consecration. im not sure i have been as impressed with a beer since. i could not imagine a better flavor profile or feel. the cherries, the brett, the cab barrels, its all so well done. i will remember this bottle fondly for a long time, and eagerly await the opportunity to drink another one. this was the last in a night of maybe 25 beers, and it was so darn good it made me sober. mind blown."

"O - I'm really disappointed with this beer. Goose Island's Juliet is one of my favorite sours, so my expectations were rightfully high for this one. It's like a watered down, soured-down La Folie, which I believe is an almost perfect example of this style. It may have been the age (almost 1.5 years since bottling) that caused the cherry flavor to seriously fade. I think this one is better fresh based off its current score of a 98 here on BA. No hard feelings - I still love you, Goose Island. Cheers!"

"Nice mix of flavors., but malt severely lacks to complement the tartness for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a very good (almost great) sour beer. The smell is especially inviting and complex, and the feel is very well-suited for the style. The taste is also nice, but a touch on the acidic side, which hurts drinkability. That criticism aside, this brew is on par with La Folie and one of the best Oud Bruins out there."

"Dry and oaky finish with only remnants of cherries and vinous grapes. Thin-medium bodied with a pretty smooth mouth feel that turns sharp in the end thanks to some hefty carbonation. Another very solid release from Goose Island's line of Belgian style ales. I'd like to see a little more sourness for the price, but overall, the beer itself was very enjoyable. I feel like a few years of age could take this one in a positive direction."

"Very good tart cherry taste. Was able to take care of a bomber myself without hating the tartness at the end. While the smell was hard to get the taste was right on. Opened it eleven months after the bottling date and it was excellent. Even though I have had it only this once, I recommend a year aging."
"Overall. A fine, easy drinking Flanders style beer with some nice real cherry flavour. Not too sweet like too many of the style."
""

"Overall: Pretty solid puckering beer. Tart, barnyard, bready, oakey, and delicious."

"Tastes a tart black cherry with a hint of sweetness very similar to a merlot with the tart after taste. The tartness is not overwhelming and they found a good balance that allows you to really enjoy this beer."
"Madame Rose is the most refined and elegant of all the girls of Goose. She's crafty, imaginative, and regal in her recipe formulation and brewer execution. She's perfect, even in her flaws."

"Hill Farmstead stemware - dark garnet hued brown body, minimal beige lace. Nice tart aromas, wood, tart cherries. I was a little surprised by this - I guess I didnt really realize what it was. An outstanding beer - tart (but not oppressive) cherries, brett, chocolate, dark fruity cabernet notes. I would like more of this."
"Overall - Very tasty and pretty authentic Oud Bruin. Nice sourness and a well blended cherry flavor."
""
"O: 4.5 - a really nice American example of a Flanders Oud Bruin/Flemish red that borders on experimental with the addition of Wisconsin cherries; to be honest, I am just getting into sours now, but I really enjoyed this one, which excited my interest to further explore the style with other Belgian and American examples"
""
""
""
""
"It's a very nice drinkable sour and tart cherry based beer. It was so sour and tart to keep your tastebuds entertained. It wasn't so sour that you made a sour pucker face every time you took a sip. A winner from Goose Island. I would drink this again if I was given another chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update on 3/26/15: Just drank a 2012 vintage bottled the same date as the above bottle. The aromas have drastically changed to more sour/tart/lactic, and the taste is more complex, just as sour, but more balanced. Age did this one very well!"
""
"Would rather drink rodenbrach grand cru for the price"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy reddish color ale with a large bubbly head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of tart cherries notes with some oak notes clearly identifiable with some funky yeast strain notes also perceptible. Taste is quite tart with cherries and oak notes mixing together very well with a funky yeast notes finish. Body is about average with good spritzy carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Easily drinkable with good restraint on the acidic notes with loads of complexity."
""
""
""
"O-there are some real similarities between this and Supplication. It doesn't age as well, but hit hard up front in the some way. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Really sad that I only have one more bottle of this little piece of GI infection perfection! I gotta grab some fantastic goat and sheep cheese to pair with this one on the next go round. Absolutely stunning!"
"Thanks, BlueOkie, for the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad but mot something I would go for again."
"This poured out as a deep brown color with a fizzy tan head on top. The head fades not leaving any lacing or retention. The smell of the beer is tart with cherries and has a subtle sweetness as well as plenty of oak barrel on the nose. The taste of the beer is tart/sour there is a good amount of cherry in the mix. The flavors are a little medicinal at times but it could be much worse. The mouthfeel is thin, with a sharp carbonation. The beer is dry. Overall it's a pretty good Flanders, worth trying if the price is right."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fairly good Flanders Brown is always and exceptional beer when I can get my hands on one. This one is somewhat above average for the style and Like that isn't too sweet, which is with the style just not my preference. This beer could definitely age well and i'd probably enjoy it even more in a year or two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a great Oud Bruin. It had a delicate and complex scent and taste. The body was a bit weak, but it was really easy to drink. Age or drink fresh. Recommended."
"A fixture upon the Nouveau Craft. Cherries, some contained sourness, and well balanced. A masterpiece. Capone’s restaurant acquisition. Well saved for Oscar night -no wine shall compete with you tonight. Reddish tinge and cherry and yeast aroma. Lasting head and lace. Smooth mouthfeel. A sipper and full drinkability with dessert"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into the glass, Madame Rose was a little darker than I would have suspected. For a Flanders it was a fairly dark brown with a sour aroma. Little head was produced by this one, as would be expected for the style. In the initial taste, one can detect bitter cherry, dry tartness, grape skin, and tart cherry hints at the back of the throat towards the end. The sour notes linger in the aftertaste but are quickly brushed away in the aftertaste by the carbonation. I never really detected much of the barrel aging in this one. It seemed more like a Flanders with more intense cherry notes. It is a better than average interpretation of the style."
""
"O: Moderately funky with some nice cherry tartness to it. The barrel is nicely integrated and it leaves a nice array of grape and oak in the background."
""
"O: An excellent sour beer. Definitely an acquired taste and a sipping beer."
""
""
"Overall this is phenomenal. A must try for any sour fan. Was very fortunate to get a bottle of it and hopefully you can be too. WIll seek this out for the rest of my life."
"This is not as sour or cherry-forward as I anticipated. But it does fit the weirdness I would anticipate from an Oud Bruin. Damp, musty, and bizarre. I'm curious what a fresh bottle would be like. Fortunately, I have one."
"A nice blend of tart and.juicy fruit sweetness. Oak is a bit heavy in the long run, but it doesn't really hurt it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As I stated above, I have no experience with this style, but it doesn't seem too much different to me than a Flanders red. A great mix of sour and sweet flavors with some red wine notes and oak character to top it off. And although this is a great beer, I probably wouldn't buy it again just based on the price. But a great beer that I thoroughly enjoyed."
""
"O: med body. Sour beer"
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable and refreshing. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle date 7/31/12, poured 1/19/13. Pours very dark red with a bit of brown and nearly no head. Smells of sour cherries and vinegar as it should. Yum. Very much vinegar on the flavor, with a robust and creamy flavor I am not familiar with for this style. Finishes dry. A bit on the heavy side for the style but it works and I like it. Another nice one from GI."
"2012 bottle poured into tulip glass. Pours a deep red almost purple with a thin light head that quickly disappears. Aromas contains an acidic cherry. Tastes less of cherries than the aroma lets on. Still a lot of tart character, little malt with a bit of funk to it. Moderately carbonated that tickles the nose. Overall, a solid GI brew but not quite up to par as her other two sisters."

"This is a delicious and unique, but very one-sided beer. I was expecting one-sidedness, but not this much vinegary sourness since the bottle only indicated that it was Belgian-style and not that it was a sour. I consider that to be very pertinent information and am baffled as to why they wouldn't mention it. I like the vinegary, unripe cherry flavour, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For me the best part of this is the smell- quite good. I think the taste needs the most work- It doesn't stand up the smell in complexity. I would not buy again at the $18 a bottle price."
""

"Definitely preferred last batch to this one....but perhaps my memory is just playing tricks on me. Cheers!"
"This is one of the more rare beer reviews from beerandraiderfan, as this review is being written immediately after consuming said beer this New Year's Eve, 2012. What can I say, everyone of drinking age isn't drinking anymore. In the end, its a pretty good and enjoyable beer. How many more will I continue to get a hold of? I dunno, there's one or two still in the cellar, it costs a little to get it shipped here, and its about the same price as Oude Tart, so prolly not much, but it doesn't mean this isn't a quality beverage here. . . man."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought it was just an average oud flanders but was still good and worth the try."
""
"O - Slightly one dimentional, although I do enjoy the tart cherry flavor. Madame Rose is a relatively tame sour. Worth trying this once but the $17 pricetag is a bit steep for what you get here."
""
"Good shit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid sour, Cherries taste great. Not much barrel flavor and a steep price but otherwise good stuff."
"[O] Madame Rose is a fantastic beer and I would gladly purchase another bottle."
""
"D/O: This is an accomplished, easy-drinking sour ale that compares well to other similar American wilds. Its most distinct quality is not from the barrel or the fruit, but from the brettanomyces yeast that dominates the smell. A complex combination of other appropriate qualities are present, but overall rather restrained. The flavor profile is particularly delicate; Russian River Supplication it is definitely not."
""
"Overall, what we like best about this brew was how smooth it drank for how sour of a punch it packs. You could drink this all day, unlike many of the style which may kill your palate and become a bit much by the end of a serving. This guy keeps things fresh and smooth to the end, with robust sourness to the nose and taste, but without going overboard. In that same vein, the cherry flavoring gave only mild sweetness to the back of this beer. This was both good and bad, as we wish that it had a bit more of that advertised flavor, but are thankful that they didn’t overdo it, overpowering the otherwise excellent flavoring."

"O- This is a a delightful beer drinking experience. The sourness is very well balanced. This is one of goose islands better sour offerings."

"M&D&O - definitely needs some time, I love sour beers, but this one was a bit different for some reason. The cherry flavor was exquisite, but sour needs to fade just a bit for the cherries to come to full power."

"O- this puppy needs more time. The flavors haven't progressed all that much, and everything seems very bland and young."
"Picked up a bottle at the Whole Foods down the street from Churchkey after Zwanze day. Poured into DFH tulip with a bit of head that leaves a slight lacing around the edge. Very nice dark burgundy in the light. Smell is wonderful, reminds me of Oude Tart a lot. Tart at first with the sweetness of the cherries a little at the end. Taste was a little hard to get into, I wasn't too keen on the cherries at first, but as the beer warmed a bit they really started to shine. Glad I picked up a bottle, will definitely drink again if I can find more."

"O: A solid Flanders brown, with plenty of the sour and funk that goes with the style. The cherries and wine barrels are both nice subtleties that make this beer nice and complex."
""
"Overall this is kind of a let down, it's one of my favorite styles and this has some great qualities but it feels like something is missing. Nothing more I can say."
""
""
"O- This beer has just a bit of a bite to the astringency that grows odd with the chalky note. I do love this style but this one was a bit lack lust especially for the price. The cherry flavor was good but it didn't have a lot of other flavor in the mouth."
""
"In the end, this beer reinforces my opinion that Goose Island can make a pretty bottle, but can't quite pull off Belgian styles."
"overall the price $18 kills any chance of me buying this again since there are better more affordable options"

"The beer pours a dull dark brown with almost no head except a thin tan halo around the edges. The beer smells slightly acidic, but is also fruity, oaky, and buttery. The sweet cherries pack a bigger punch than expected cutting down dramatically on the beer's mild tartness. The taste plays out the same, except for providing a touch more oak and vinegar. It's definitely a tasty oud bruin that yanks on the standard subtle cherry characteristics of the style and makes them a true asset to the beer. The aftertaste is mildly drying, almost negligible by comparison, and leaves little flavor lingering. It's sweet body is cut by a mild tartness, but there very little Brett funk...maybe it's weakness is that it's a bit too mild, or possibly served a bit too cold. Regardless, it's redlined, drinkable, reasonable priced/available, and made by the lovely A-B InBev...who have never messed up a beer before."

"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 7/31/2012. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a brownish/red color with about a half inch light tan head. Head stayed around for a bit, but there isn't much lacing. Aroma is mostly tart, the brew smells like tart cherries, wood, red wine, and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and pretty easy to drink. I think it's a good overall brew, definitely worth a try. But it is pricey at $15.99 a bottle."

"Pours a very opaque brown with a decent sized head that quickly dissipates. Smells a bit funky with some dark sugars and a lingering sweetness. There's a solid shot of tart cherries and lactic aromas and a hint of vanilla and vinegar. The flavor is sweet and a little brown sugary up front but that changes rapidly. Lactic tart and bready funk come in right away to sweep out and residual sweetness. Tart cherries and lemons are faint flavors but they are there amid a hint of oak and vanilla. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart puckering mouthfeel. This is a really nice American sour, but I think it needs a little time in the bottle for everything to come together a little better."
"This pours a reddish brown color with a carbonated head that reminds me more of a cola than a beer. The scent is rich with yeasts and fermented cherries. Initially the taste of yeasty fruit hints you taste buds with a complex blend of ingredients. As the taste develops, it grows into this sweet tart taste that lingers in you mouth well past the swallow. Interesting certainly high end in taste but I was expecting something a little more in the realm of New Glarus Belgian red since this is almost twice as much in cost."
"Overall, a really bright and fruity sour upfront that falls off after the initial fruit tones. A little sour, but that too fades. This is a really nice beer but the finish seems too clean and bland. Good not great."
""

"(O)- With a little bit of time, this could be really awesome. Will possibly get more sour and that with the presently great showing of fruit, oak, and subtle earthy funk will really drive this one home. Only time will tell."

"O - A very solid flanders oud bruin. Very subtle and simple with nice strong cherry notes and lactic acid working off of some really great barrels. I'd put this in the middle when it comes to three sisters though."
"Overall I think this is a solid beer, but not a great beer. With that being said, I wouldn't be afraid to buy more. Have a feeling this one could go the distance in a cellar if stored properly."

"O= This is a great brew. It actually has a nice lasting flavor where as while Juliet was great the flavor drops quick. This is a great oud bruin. Seek this beer out."

"I poured from a bomber into my kate snifter, dark reddish-brown pour, small white head. The aroma is tart, vinegary, lots of cherry notes. It is pleasanty tart, lots of cherries, very vinous, drying finish. It is slightly acidy, nice sipper, refreshing. Enjoyable brew, glad Iwas finally able to try it."
""
""
""
"O - If you like American sour beers, you have to try this at least once!"
"O: Wow, this was a fantastic beer by Goose Island. So glad to try it!"
"Dark fruits and bread, soured cherries, oaky wine barrel character. Pretty good taste given that I'm typically a cynic of the style. Enjoyable, but can't compare to Juliet."
"The price point did not bother me as this was gifted by a really good friend, but i would definitely buy again! :-)"

"The beer pours a deep candied brown with light ruby hints to it and a light eggshell-white head on top that fades quickly leaving little to no lacing. The body of the beer is dark and opaque; leaving one to guess what might be inside of it, though little carbonation bubbles can be seen dancing to the top of the glass. On the nose, the beer has some great sour cherry notes that hint at fruit leather and vinegar, and heavily remind me of the Bruery’s Oude Tart. Light notes of brown sugar and bready malt can be picked up, but are really faint in comparison to the sour cherry. Light spices can also be found in the sour smell. The initial sip of the beer begins with prickling sour that opens into big cherry and leather fruit notes before hinting at fruit-rollups towards the end of the middle and closing out as a faint sour tingle. The taste is actually surprisingly simplistic and I’m really just getting a lot of cherry sour with faint hints at the wine barrels that the beer sat in. The taste is lighter and less mouth puckering than other sours I have sampled, which makes this beer more acceptable for table pairings as it won’t ruin the tastes of the food. As it warms the beer also bring more of its malt character into play, and though it is still light it hints at caramel and bread notes. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, though I think that is actually helpful with this beer, especially in terms of making it a table pairing beer. Carbonation is quite prickly at the start but that dies down to just leave the tongue a little numbed but cleans the palate. The mouth is actually left rather neutral after the beer has left it, with a very slight sour lingering, and some saliva on the sides of the tongue while the middle sits slightly dry yet still moist. Overall my feelings are neutral on this beer. I have not had an Oud Bruin before, so my judgment of it comes more from the Flanders Red Style, which is supposed to be similar but sourer. I’m intrigued with how the beer allows for more pairing options with lighter food, but really the beer did not blow me away. A lovely sipper, and I great for the table, but nothing overly special with this beer"

"A disappointing beer from Goose Island. Tart and monotone my wife dumped hers but I finished mine with a meh upon last sip. Rose is more of a corner pimp than a madame. That was a stretch."
"Price point on this one is kind of high, and I would have thought there would be more of a cherry presence in the taste. This is a nice one to give a try though."
"Overall-While I can see that some are disappointed that it is not more sour or that the cherries don’t come out stronger, I think the beer is fine the way it is…hope it becomes even better once it has had some time to age. I wish I had a whole case in my closet instead of only two more bottles. Priced slightly high but still worth trying."

"Light to medium texture in the mouthfeel. Overall, a solid representation of the style with the nice oak flavor and aroma coming through."
"O: this brew was rather intriguing, as soon as the aroma hit the nose, I immediately began to salivate from the sourness. I was expecting a bit more of the cherries to come out so I was slightly disappointed in that. But nonetheless, this is an excellent sour brew IMO. I have to say that Juliet gets a slight edge as my favorite of the 3 sisters, but this is an extremely close second. Another excellent offering by GI."

"O/D-Awesome. Sweet and sour to the max. Balance is key. Worth every penny. This is one of those beers that may not be one of your favorites, but you will always remember it. Could be my favorite Goose Island brew though...yeah it is."
"2012 vintage. Well, hadn't seen my man VDubb and his lady in some time, so I figured I'd bring over a bottle o' this to mark the occasion. It pours a dark faux-murky ruby-garnet topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. Not all that much to look at, though, until it was held up to the light. The nose comprises dank/slightly tart cherry, light caramel/maple syrup (I couldn't untangle the two), and a touch of general earthiness. The taste holds notes of sweeter-than-usual cranberries, light tart cherry pit, light earthy greens, and a smattering of vague sweetness running beneath it all. Honestly, this aspect let me down a little, especially considering the pedigree of her sisters. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a pretty nice brew, but one that just didn't live up to expectations. There was hardly any appreciable tartness of any kind, the cherries came through somewhat muted (even transmogrified at times), and the whole thing came across as just too sweet for its own good (and, mind you, this is without coming across as sweet in any absolute sense whatsoever, only a relative one based on the style/expectations/whatnot). It's still generally enjoyable, but nothing to really celebrate too much."

"Medium-light bodied with carbonation on the high side. Clean and crisp drinking, refreshing, with a tannic, drying finish. Quite good."
"Medium body which is dry, very tart and puckering with lots of earthy funk, oak barrel and sweet fruit.  Prominent tart dark cherry but still sweet with lactic funk.  Subtle acetone presence at first that becomes a bit overpowering with a powerful, lingering vinegary/solvent finish.  A bit harsh on the acidity but decent amount of sweetness and oak countering things.  This had the potential to be a lot better but the acetic solvent character is just too strong for my liking. "

"Pours a bright cherry red color workout much of a head on it. Nose is cherries, vinous character, sourdough bread. Taste starts with cherries that move to a citric character. Some bready malts take the palate next and are overwhelmed by some more citric cherry flavors mixed in some vinegar that is ultimately drowned out by a lingering vinous flavor. Really nice complexity. Decent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I don't know if I would pay the price tag again for it, but wouldn't say no."

"pours a faded hazy mahogany red with a foamy looking bubbly head. The nose is ok, fair bit of oak with light vanilla and cherry as a moderate acidity and sawdusty Brett. Flavor is similar. Decent acidity in the finish, cherries are light and the oak is still most prominent with a fair bit of vanilla. Light body, assertive carbonation, semi dry finish and assertive but nice sourness. Decent, drink closer to room temp. Balanced but a touch flabby."
"Overall, a beer geek's wet dream. I would highly recommend pairing this beer with a soft stinky cheese, as the tartness cuts through that buttery cheese like a champ. I love the great balance that is maintains, as is ever important with a sour beer. The cherries are a welcome addition, and I think it would also do wonders for a cherry dessert, like a torte or Black Forrest Cake."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. I really enjoyed the cherry version of the 3 sisters - I hope to have this again eventually."

"Cherry graham with just a rim of foam. Smells like cherries, some lemons, some oak and a little cabernet character.

It is not overly complex, very clean and approachable sour."

"It drank just fine out of my Gouden Carolus goblet."
"bottle 1550. 10/10/10. pours the color of blood on mahogany. kind of a reddish brown amber with an off-pink head that shrinks to a collar and leaves a little lace. nose is buttery oak, cherry, plum, strawberry, spice, dark sweetness, brett and a tiny hint of leather. quite nice. oak seems pronounced but still blends with the other scents. taste is a very proper mix of the above, with wood and cherry shining through the harmony. notes of cola and that dark spice that brett can carry come out as well. great mix of sweet and sour/tart. medium full body that has a slight tickle/tingle from the carbonation. not prickly though. long, tart finish. overall, a very very very nice oud bruin. would love to try the rest of the group."

"Pours a ruddy red with a high white head, little lacing. The smell is vinegar, currants, toffee. The taste is rich currant jam, toffee, long tart cider-vinegar finish. It's fizzy and light. All in all a pleasant take on the style, though perhaps a little more sour than it needs to be."
"O: Fantastic. Really nice to see GI developing into one of the better breweries in the country, IMO. This is not just a solid effort, but a very good beer. Excellent use of cherries, their flavor is the star, but does not detract from the other flavors in the beer. Wish I could find this one on the shelves."
"Pours a hazy cranberry brown color with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin film. Thin streaks and dots of lace drip back down into the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries, funk, slight vinegar, and wood aromas. Taste is of sour cherries, funk, and lots of wood flavors. I am not really getting any wine in the smell or taste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice earthy and sour smells and tastes."
"Nice body, but I think a little more carb would be good. I love how the fruits tempers the sour vinegar aspects of this beer. Drinkable to a fault and truly delicious. I'm once again ISO."
"2010 Vintage. Pours an almost-clear, reddish-brown color with a small white head. Scent is heavy with oak and vanilla. Very nice cherry aroma with a sense of sour acidity. Taste is initially red wine vinegar, Lovely vanilla and cherry oak flavors. A lot of vanilla. Nice and tart, but not overly sour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pleasant, tart bite to it. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was AMAZING! IT was a great well-balanced sour ale that met all of my expectations."
"Overall: Very tasty. Perfectly sour, great cherry flavor."
"O: Definitely worth trying"
"SkÅL!"
"Overall I think the price comes into play. It's pretty good but not 25$ good."
"Of the 3 sisters, all of them are great in their own right, but this one least fit my preferances(high lactic, strong brett), but would be the most approachable for a new to sour beer drinker."

"Overall: This was pretty good, but I do not have a reason to really go after this again. Especially for the price, there are better options."

"Overall: I really enjoyed the use of the wine. The flavors went together very well. Smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall Impression- While getting the last bottle (a current trend I'm enjoying lately!), this was well worth the cost! Awesome sweet and tart Oud Bruin with tons of complexity. Easy drinking and enjoyed the hell out of this one. Hope to see this guy again (even though its so limited)."
"A good sour beer, if rather expensive. Worth trying once, though. It's smooth and has all the characteristics of a great sour -- not a lesser sweet, ""kind of tart"" beer -- without smacking you in the face."
"D-Not sure I'd call this one an Oud Bruin, but what do I know? A very complex and interesting beer that is highly drinkable. Now, I just wish I could get a bottle or two more of this one."
"The beer pours an orange-ish brown color with a small but well retained head. The aroma has that great dirty laundry character right up front with some lingering horseblanket and loads of cherry aroma. The beer smells mildly sweet but the flavor is fairly dry, not bracingly so but it is dry. The sourness of the beer is the most dominant trait, that and the loads of cherry flavor. The beer has a little bit of that cherry pie (ie with the crust a-la New Glarus Belgian Red) showing that this character carries well into a non-sweet fruit beer very very well. Absolutely delicious."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, fruit, and slight sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, tart, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Based on the aroma was I was expecting this one to be a little sour, but instead it was tart. This was a nice welcomed surprised as it worked quite well with the cherries in this one. While this brew wasn't very complex it was quite good with what it had as everything was in the right portions. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a red- brown color into my bruery tulip. Aroma of vinegar, cherries and Brett. Taste follows the nose, Brett is more present that other takes on this style. Sour but not overpowering. Cherries are amazing at the end of the taste. Smooth and delicious, no alcohol burn present. Great Sour!"
"4 - 4.5 - 4.5 - 4.5 - 4.5"
"The pour was very nice with a rich medium brown color and a nice light tan head on top. Nearly opaque with some light reddish touches to the sides and bottom. Deep horse funk on the nose with apple vinegar and ripe sour apples dominating the aroma with some light oak notes as it warmed. The flavor was crisp tart and very full. Ripe apples and sour fruits just ripping through the mouth. Puckeringly good here with a great carbonation level and really solid body all around."

"O- Very tasty beer, well balanced, puckers your lips, love the cherries and the oak flavors very solid sour from Goose Island."
"Overall, this was a solid sour. One of the better sours from the night. Easy drinking with some tasty flavors. I like it."
"Poured into a snifter glass a copper red color with a slight collared white head. Very nice nose of cherry, vanilla, and oak. Light mouthfeel. Sweet vanilla cherry flavors upfront with an underlying sourness but not mouthpuckering at all. Somewhat reminds me of New Glarus Enigma. Not overly complex at this time but pretty tasty. Curious to see what some time in the bottle will do to this."
"O - This is a unique style and quite enjoyable. Would try again."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink for the style because the sourness isn’t too strong and is fairly well incorporated into the overall taste."
"Dark amber red color with offwhite head. smell is of brett and wild yeast/bacteria, with a hint of fruit. the taste is tart, but smooth, with a nice sourness and sweetness from the fruit. Not a lot of ""funk"" in this one and that's a good thing with this brew. the mouthfeel is lively. Overall, outstanding wild ale. I like my wilds a little on the sweet side and this one delivers. Excellent."
"O: Well this was better than The Dissident for sure. However it was nowhere near being a great FOB. Maybe some age would do this one some good."
"Overall: A decent beer but it doesn't contend with the better options in the style category."
"O – This beer was a real treat for me. I was a bit hesitant but it is a very good sour. Great cherry flavor with some nice malt notes and good funk. (4.5)"
"Overall: A very ho-hum beer, below-average for the style. Points for a cool label I suppose."
"O - The drinkability here is good. It goes down easy and has great flavor. I could drink more than 1 bottle of this in an evening. Overall, I really enjoyed this one, and I would buy it again."
"Notes: The cherries take a back seat, or more accurately, they play a supporting role instead of dominated the palate. At first I was disappointed because I was hoping for more cherry flavor, but the more I think about it, the more I find this to be a well-made beer with great integration of the fruit and wood. Not my favorite, but a solid example of the style and worth seeking out."
"O: These first generations of sour beers from Goose Island have been pretty good, and I look forward to seeing them continue to improve."
"Overall - This is my second ""sour"" from Goose Island and I will admit, they are both a hint underwhelming. I do admit, however, they do seem to be improving from the Juliet I had almost a year ago. I'd like to see what this will do with a few years on it (which I am planning on doing - I have the full set of the ""three sisters"" back in IL and won't be opening those for a while I feel). Still, a solid oud bruin."
"Interesting beer that I would serve with apple, sausage and walnut-stuffed pork chops."
"Muddy amber with red highlights. The small head dissipates completely after a short time. Nice sweet and sour cherry aroma, fleshy and earthy with a backing of earthy brett funk. Thin, dry body. Pleasant lactic sourness, some vinous fruitiness. Tart cherry finish, quite mild but very enjoyable."
"Very nice wild, cherry ale. Not very complex or aggressive."
"O- Overall, this is a pretty good American Wild Ale. I found the serving size to be a bit much- would much rather see this in 12oz bottles. I would revisit this, but would not go out of my way to land another bottle."
"D: Excellent brew from Goose Island. This is the best ""wild"" beer that I have had from them. I will be sure to pick up a couple more this week."
"Drinkability: By the gallon."
"Reviewed from notes. Pours a nice reddish-brown with a good white head with nice retention and a bit of lacing. The nose brings forward a good bit of oak along with some vibrant cherries and a bit of citrus. Good lactic presence throughout. The flavor is equally a nice with the fruit really coming through alongside a nice complementary oak character. Feel is slightly tannic with some sourness and a dry finish. Really drinkable. Solid hit from the Goose."
"D: Easy drinking for a sour (but only if that's what you're into). This is a very nicely balanced oud bruin, and I really like that it's a little bit more on the sour side than a traditional Belgian (Rodenbach, Monk's Cafe, etc.)."
"Home run by Goose Island. I will be trying to find more of these."
"Juicy and sour cherries, distinctly fruity, savory. Dry oaky tannins in the finish, a distinct cherry pit dryness. Lingering natural cherry in the aftertaste. Ample carbonation, it becomes creamy after the initial sour/tangy bite. Light and spritzy, nice for a Wild Ale, less so as an Oud Bruin. Very juicy and quenching, the dryness encourages frequent sipping. Age it longer to develop more Brett character, blend old and young batches, this will be a winner. Rodenbach Grand Cru still has a corner on the market though."
"M/D - Medium body on this one that finishes about as dry as a beer can get. Lots of carbonation on this one but goes well with the dryness. Super easy to drink if you don't mind the palate getting sucked dry with each sip and the simplicity of complex ingredients make this beer a treat to drink."
"d. Wish this was distributed, i'd have bought a case."
"D- Very tasty with the alcohol pretty subdued, would have like to see a bit more of an appearance from the cherries being that its brewed with it."
"D: smooth and clean goes down smooth."
"D: So easy to drink. I loved that it wasn't sour just for sours' sake. This one's about balance and restraint. Fab!"
"O: Interesting beer, I'm glad to have another bottle on the way to age so I can see what happens to this one."
"overall - very pleased with this, and happy i have another bottle to try in a couple years. at this point its nothing outstanding, but it is a very solid oud bruin."
"Goose Island has certainly taken a page from Allagash on their presentation of this bottle, looks nice. Poured into a rodenbach glass and presents itself an orangish red with brown around the edges and thin white ring of foam that leaves no lacing. Sounds better then it looks! Aroma is somewhat muted but complex. Vanilla, cherry, some acetic quality and light hay approach the nose. Round malty body, backed up by tart cherry and slight funk, but more acetic. A little vanilla and a touch of spice. I could drink mounds of this stuff, easy to drink with great quafability, thanks Goose Island."
"An Ouid Bruin style aged on cherries in cabernet barrels. To quote my buddy Andy, ""There's no nose on this rose"". Super dry with a funky oak and peat sourness. Lovely Brettyanomyces asserting a classic Belgian flare, but the clean flavor remains distinctly American."
"This is quite drinkable. I can foresee this becoming better in a few months... Once the tartness opens up and the Brett kicks in more dry funk, this beer will certainly improve in all aspects... I cam only imagine how this review improves in a few months..."
"Pretty good beer overall. Fruitiness could be intensified a bit, and the acidity could be toned down, but I still enjoyed this beer. Glad I didn't love it, cause then I'd have to try to find some more..."
"D - This is solid, not great. Fairly easy to get down, but wouldn't seek this out at the prices it is at."
"Another stellar beer from the Goose Island Vintage Reserves. What strikes me most about this beer is its balance, everything is in harmony. While some Belgium beers of this style demonstrate more complexity you would be hard pressed to find a more pleasant drinking experience. Unlike the Juliet, I would be more comfortable ageing this beer as I think the secondary characteristics will balance nicely with the fruit."
"This isn't bad, a good tasting but plain oud, just nothing going on worthy of spending $29."
"Pours a nice dark brownish red with minimal head. Slight aroma of cherries nothing intense. At first sip I am surprised as this was a "" brown ale"". It has a nice tangy cherry taste. Perhaps a little watery. Not too much fruit, not too much sour. Not a perfect brew... Seems like it is missing something just not sure what. overall tho Drinkability is excellent. Worth a try. I will have another please"
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is high. Drinkability is good."
"All in all, this is not a good brew. Simply put, ok. It's a sour and I know I am not the best judge as I am not a fan of that flavor in beer. However, trying to judge without bias, this is not one of the higher end sours by any means."
"drinkability is excellent. exactly what a flanders oud briun should be. this is a near perfect concoction of fruit, sour and sweet notes that is not overly concentrated or overbearing, but just right in all areas. cheers!"
