4.04,1,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"A wonderful Belgian Flanders sour ale. I wish I had the larger portion of the bottle I shared. Pours a lovely dark burgundy color, minimal head. Cherry notes and a slightly woody/barrel quality in the aroma and flavor. Slightly tart and appropriately lactic finish accentuated by the carbonation. Very nice, and don't be afraid of the yeast sediment in the dregs if you're into that sort of thing.","dd43","Mar 26, 2015"

I'm a bit underwhelmed by the complex barrel aging protocol, which I imagined would be more apparent; I guess it's overshadowed by the tartness.

Nice white head with a light purple hue...stayed around awhile to a thin lacy head. A small swear brought a little 1/4 finger head back. The taste was what I was hoping for. Sour cherries up front that hits your back sides of your toungue. Then the tart barrel funky sour hits the middle of the tongue to finish...hanging on at the end is a dry almost earthy after taste.

It pours a dark dark red which one might mistake for a stout in the right lighting. Cuvee Freddy has little to no carbonation which gives it an interesting mouthfeel. The taste is reminiscent of lambic, wine, and whiskey due to the oak barrels in which it was aged. Friends of mine who like even the most bland of beers were blown away by the flavor. Its a shame I cannot find it at any local liquor store and have to pay $12 a bottle at the Ginger Man bar here in town. I hope they never stop carrying it!","LazFTW","0"

I like the bigger malt bill, but this beer needs a lot more carbonation to keep up with it. it comes across thin and watery as a result of inferior bubbles. overall not a beer I will race to drink again, but an intriguing take on a style that really doesn't make it to America in much variety.

But unfortunately, there is really no longevity to the ride, at least not as much as I would think is appropriate. Sure, it hits on the chracteristics of the style very well, but it's gone before you know it and just too thin overall. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, and it's nice. But if only it could have been just a little bit more, we'd be looking at an amazing beer.","RblWthACoz","0"

4,0,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I was a little disappointed with this brew. It had so much potential, but really slammed it hard with the acidity, steamrolling any true complexity or subtlety that might be there. While the elements themselves might be very pleasant, it fails somewhat as an overall package.","lacqueredmouse","Jan 09, 2012"

4,0,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy burgundy color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of sour and tart notes mix in with light sweet notes and some sherry. Taste is also a nice mix between some tart notes which are well balanced with some notes of sherry and port with a subtle vinous character. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very nice and not too one-dimensional on the sour side of things.","Phyl21ca","Nov 20, 2011"

3.45,-13.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: This is a decent enough Flemish brown, but I would have liked to see an even more intense, assertive flavor profile and a bit more chewiness in the mouth.

4.12,3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit stemmed snifter. Poured a massively dark brown (basically black) with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, acetic acid, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart cherry, caramel, wood, and subtle sour. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This brew really threw me off as it smelled as if it would be much more sour/tart than it actually was. This one did have the tart/sour aspect going on, but it was not the dominant flavor in it at all. The flavors that were present really did a nice job of working together and enhancing one another. Just wish there would have been a little bit of the acetic acid present that I picked up on in the aroma. Defintely worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Aug 04, 2011"
3.8,-5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall this was a very interesting beer and the most wine influenced beer I have ever sampled. I wish I got more of the base beer here but I enjoyed how the sour beer flavors worked with the wine barrel aging. Would have liked more body/carbonation but the wine mouthfeel is appropriate I guess for a red vinous tasting beer.","claspada","Jun 08, 2011"
3.72,-7,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Smells really good, but the flavor is a bit sloppy; it starts to be all-over-the-place. This is still a good surprise since this is certainly a beer I'd pass on if I saw it on shelves; actually I'd probably never notice it on shelves.","MbpBugeye","Beers"
4.07,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a medium bodied brew with a low level of carbonation. The alcohol is hidden very well, it never once felt even near 8%. It has decent drinkability and a fair blend of flavors, overall not bad.","stakem","0"

Iâ€™m in the process of trying to find RR replacements now that Iâ€™m back in IL, and this one may have to do for a Consecration Also wish there was a bit more carbonation.","SpdKilz","May 19, 2011"
4.04,1,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall -- This is really quite nice. Great roast malt base compliments the tart components. Well-balanced, no elements outpacing the others. I have a sneaking suspicion that I got an undercarbed bottle - will have to try this again. Definitely worth seeking out.","yeahnatenelson","May 01, 2011"

4.5,12.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Its drinkability is enhanced by the softening of the sour flavor in the drying finish. Let it linger on your tongue and you'll also notice hints of leather and dark skinned fruit. Overall, this is an aggressive and slightly acidic beer that serves as a noteworthy example of its style.","Keene","Apr 25, 2011"

3.95,-1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pour is a very dark brown with minimal head, though there is a thin collar throughout, and some spots form after a good swirl. The nose brings some slight roast along with a good cherry presence, some lactic acid, and a moderate amount of oak. The flavor is fairly acidic with a good oak and tannin presence. The darker portion of the blend is noticeable with some roast. The finish is fairly sour, but also has some good roast. A bit of acetone, though only in the finish. Not more than is worth docking .5 points for. Overall, really solid. Glad to see this on tap two blocks from home.","Thorpe429","Feb 20, 2011"

An interesting and tasty beer...grab a bottle if you see it just to taste it for yourself!","ShadesOfGray","0"
